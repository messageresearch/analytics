[52:00] definitely it's not only a new bro but
[52:03] it's gonna be a challenge to them they

[52:08] now God's gonna require more of them a
[52:11] man today than he did before then so the

[52:16] Paul and sister Kimberly and to the
[52:19] Saints not able to come today the Lord
[52:21] bless them
[52:22] so we'll see I was thinking maybe a
[52:25] ministry on a certain subject and I
[52:28] ministered on a many many years ago I
[52:31] think was an empire avenue the church
[52:34] that was there but maybe what we'll do
[52:36] first we'll hear the problem of God
[52:38] preached on it and know that I've
[52:41] ministered maybe a number of times on it
[52:43] back many years ago and the tapes might
[52:46] be in the basement
[52:48] because it was it was tapes they're not
[52:50] CDs and definitely not DVDs now we're
[52:54] living in a very changing world
[52:56] a man so we're pretty grace of God that
[52:59] it says the world changes we're changing
[53:02] he meant but we're changing from time to
[53:05] eternity the world is going from going
[53:08] from time to hell and we would pray the
[53:11] grace of boy because God says go make a
[53:13] new heaven and a new earth amen
[53:16] and I don't know but how many believers
[53:18] are really really looking for it but I'm
[53:21] hungry and thirsting for the new heaven
[53:23] and the new earth I'm tired of this one
[53:26] oh brother journal journal you're just
[53:29] getting old or brothers not it's not old
[53:32] age it's it's spiritual revelation you
[53:35] have the Holy Ghost brother as Jesus was
[53:39] only 33 years old and 33 yeah and he was
[53:43] longing to get out of here yeah and he
[53:45] was popular among certain above the
[53:48] disciples back then oh yeah he did
[53:51] science he did wonders never fall
[53:53] following Jesus or do this do this do
[53:55] this well come to the end of his
[53:58] ministry so I believe that we're coming
[54:00] to the end of the ministry again amen
[54:03] it was the end of new Thurs ministry the
[54:05] end of Wesley's ministry the end of
[54:07] William Booth ministry and many other
[54:09] preachers the end of the Pentecostal
[54:11] ministries but decay man in to the
[54:13] ministry of Malecha Malachi 4
[54:15] oh well it's in the bride now well our
[54:19] ministry's coming to an end
[54:20] yeah it's finished I received an email
[54:24] from a brother and he had listed all
[54:27] that all that's going on in the world
[54:29] negatively and all the people that have
[54:31] died with this died with that died with
[54:33] this die with that millions and millions
[54:36] of millions and I said Lord I said
[54:37] that's the germ warfare the Prophet
[54:39] warned us up they met and brother was
[54:42] not going to come it's here now and a
[54:45] number of years ago brother George Smith
[54:47] his sister Rebecca they did they did an
[54:50] article in the India monthly letters on
[54:54] the germ warfare and they said it's not
[54:57] going to be new new germs or new new
[55:00] this and new that it's going to be the
[55:02] old
[55:02] are going to come back a man and they
[55:05] are because they were highlighting
[55:06] certain things a certain number of
[55:08] people that had died as a result of a
[55:10] certain disease it was one of the old
[55:12] fashioned diseases but but they're
[55:14] coming back and man is getting less and
[55:17] less control over it yeah
[55:19] so the grace of God be with us brother
[55:21] let's make sure that we're under the
[55:23] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[55:25] not religious leadership but brother
[55:28] it's gotta be old ego spiritual
[55:30] leadership by the grace of God a man so
[55:33] we're going to hear brother ran on
[55:34] minister and it's just less than an hour
[55:37] and a half for short and minister on
[55:40] leadership and he preached it in

[55:46] couple of weeks before the Lord took him

[1:05:56] Kimberly in prayer and brother Paul and
[1:06:00] the Saints that are not with us today
[1:06:02] the grace of God be with them and also
[1:06:05] I'm asking you to remember our daughter
[1:06:07] Sharon in prayer understand that she's
[1:06:10] to have surgery within a few days and
[1:06:12] prayed the grace of God to be with her
[1:06:15] during that surgery and it's I think
[1:06:18] it's a cyst somewhere in her body that
[1:06:21] the doctors want to remove because it
[1:06:23] has increased in size so we pray the
[1:06:26] grace of God be with them and pray on a
[1:06:30] daily basis yes for Sharon pray on a
[1:06:34] daily basis for brother Mark's family
[1:06:36] and your own family that are that are
[1:06:38] not serving the Lord the grace of God
[1:06:40] pleading the token life of the blood of
[1:06:42] Jesus amen
[1:06:44] against the enemy that's influencing
[1:06:46] their lives amen
[1:06:49] so the Holy Ghost takes control amen in
[1:06:52] Romans chapter 8 and verse 1 there is
[1:07:01] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:07:05] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:07:09] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:14] I pray the grace of God that we walk not
[1:07:19] after our flesh and fleshly leadership
[1:07:22] but it's a spiritual only Ghost
[1:07:24] leadership for the law of the spirit of
[1:07:28] life is pray in Christ Jesus has made me
[1:07:32] free from the law of sin and death the
[1:07:37] enemy can't condemn us no more a man
[1:07:40] because in Christ he can only see the
[1:07:44] righteousness of God for what the law
[1:07:47] could not do in that it was weak through
[1:07:49] the flesh
[1:07:51] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:07:53] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[1:07:57] sin in the flesh that the righteousness
[1:08:01] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[1:08:06] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:08:09] spirit amen go with me to verse 14 for
[1:08:17] as many as are led by the Spirit of God
[1:08:21] they are the sons of God for ye have not
[1:08:28] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:08:31] fear but you have received the spirit of
[1:08:34] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen
[1:08:40] the grace of God be with us that we're
[1:08:43] led by the Spirit of God the sons and
[1:08:46] daughters of God crying father father
[1:08:49] the spirit itself bears witness with our
[1:08:53] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:08:56] amen
[1:08:58] a trust we have that that witness our
[1:09:01] trust we have that testimony that we are
[1:09:03] thus we're not religious or were just
[1:09:05] not members members of a Bible believers
[1:09:07] church we are the sons and daughters of
[1:09:09] God amen
[1:09:11] too many identify themselves there were
[1:09:14] just Christians and we go to church and
[1:09:16] we do this we do that now you've got to
[1:09:19] have the revelation that you are the
[1:09:21] sons and daughters of God if you are
[1:09:23] born again you're born by the Spirit of
[1:09:27] God amen so what what birth is more
[1:09:30] important is not your natural one it's
[1:09:32] your spiritual they may so the spirit
[1:09:37] itself bears witness with our spirit
[1:09:38] that we are the children of God and if
[1:09:42] children then heirs and heirs of God
[1:09:44] joint heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:09:48] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:09:51] glorified together a man God best his
[1:09:56] word amen
[1:09:57] the Lord bless you you may be seated as
[1:09:59] we go into
[1:10:02] the message on leadership preached in
[1:10:06] Covina California December the 7th 1965
[1:10:10] and again to remind you that it is the
[1:10:12] second last message that the Prophet
[1:10:14] preached and I believe it was
[1:10:16] significant and I believe it's important
[1:10:18] a man he acknowledges he says that it
[1:10:21] that what he was preaching was hard a
[1:10:23] man but he said that's the hour we're
[1:10:26] living
[1:10:26] he said we got we can't help it we got
[1:10:28] to do it a man her brother and and I
[1:10:31] believe message preachers need need to
[1:10:33] need to have that revelation because
[1:10:35] they're forever a time brother that we
[1:10:37] need to get ardor and ardour and ardour
[1:10:39] as we get closer and closer to the
[1:10:41] change amen closer and closer to the
[1:10:44] reality of the resurrection and the
[1:10:46] rapture oh yeah
[1:10:48] God through the minister is going to get
[1:10:49] ardor and put more pressure more
[1:10:51] pressure on the on the elect more
[1:10:53] pressure on the bride a man to make your
[1:10:55] calling and election sure God's grace to
[1:10:58] us amen Lord bless you
[1:11:12] I can't help being a more I just got to
[1:11:16] be what I am and we I don't mean to be
[1:11:20] different it's just that I I'm living at
[1:11:23] a changing time we're as long as you're
[1:11:26] building the wall one straight way it's
[1:11:28] all fine then the orbicularis keel right
[1:11:31] down the road but when you have to turn
[1:11:32] the corner that's where the time and
[1:11:34] we're not building a wall we're building
[1:11:36] a house to see so these terms has to
[1:11:38] come they come in the age of Martin
[1:11:40] Luther John Wesley in the Pentecostal
[1:11:42] age it's here again
[1:11:44] so we it's hard to turn the corners but
[1:11:47] I'm so thankful for to God even though
[1:11:51] hard too rough it's been the people has
[1:11:53] responded 100% so we're very grateful
[1:11:56] thank each one again and now before we
[1:12:00] opened the boot let's speak to the
[1:12:02] author if you will just a moment while
[1:12:04] we bow our heads
[1:12:07] dear gone we are grateful to you tonight
[1:12:11] for the privilege of knowing Jesus
[1:12:14] Christ our Savior your son in the free
[1:12:17] pardoning of our sins and to know that
[1:12:20] his blood is sufficient that's covered
[1:12:23] all of our sins and our iniquities
[1:12:25] they're so blotted out and put in the
[1:12:28] sea of God's forgiveness and his bride
[1:12:31] will stand at the wedding supper pure
[1:12:34] unadulterated to marry the son of God
[1:12:37] how we thank thee for this all
[1:12:40] sufficiency in the faith to know that we
[1:12:44] do not trust in our own merits but in
[1:12:46] his merit alone for what he did for us
[1:12:50] we're so grateful thank you for the the
[1:12:53] success that these brethren had overseas
[1:12:57] in the countries over there where there
[1:12:58] hungered and thirsting for God I pray
[1:13:02] Lord that if they go back again at those
[1:13:04] children that they brought into the
[1:13:06] kingdom will be great grandmothers and
[1:13:08] grandfathers of the children at they
[1:13:10] bring in also granted father bless us
[1:13:14] together tonight may the Holy Spirit
[1:13:17] give to us the things that we have need
[1:13:20] of close our mouths to the things that
[1:13:23] we should not say and open our hearts to
[1:13:26] receive what you would tell us granted
[1:13:28] father in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:13:33] now let's turn in the Bible to a little
[1:13:38] text that I would like to speak on for a
[1:13:41] while tonight and it's found over in st.
[1:13:45] mark the tenth chapter and I have a few
[1:13:49] years ago when I would speak I would I
[1:13:51] wouldn't even have to write a note I
[1:13:53] could remember it and I didn't have to
[1:13:56] take a pair of glasses to read down the
[1:13:58] Bible but since I passed 25 now twice
[1:14:04] some County a little hard for me to do
[1:14:08] like it used to do as like a war in our
[1:14:11] car but I'm still running I want to keep
[1:14:16] on chugging along till it's I go to
[1:14:18] scrap heap to be molded over
[1:14:21] that's the promise st. Luke the tenth
[1:14:24] chapter and began at the I believe I
[1:14:28] said the 21st verse if I can find it
[1:14:30] here some were mistaken his st. mark I'm
[1:14:36] sorry
[1:14:37] Saint Mark the tenth chapter and the
[1:14:41] twenty beginning with the 21st verse I
[1:14:44] want to read let's get to 17th first
[1:14:47] rather and when he was gone forth into
[1:14:51] the way there came one running and
[1:14:53] kneeling down to him and asked him
[1:14:55] saying good master what shall I do that
[1:14:58] I may inherit eternal life and Jesus
[1:15:04] said unto him why call us out me good
[1:15:07] there's is none good but one that is God
[1:15:12] I don't know what's the commandments do
[1:15:15] not commit adultery do not kill do not
[1:15:17] steal do not bear false witness defraud
[1:15:20] not honour thy father and mother and he
[1:15:24] answered instead of him master all these
[1:15:27] have I observed from my youth then said
[1:15:32] then jesus beholding him loved him and
[1:15:36] said unto him one thing that I'll like
[1:15:39] us gold our way and sell whatsoever thou
[1:15:42] has and give to the poor and thou shalt
[1:15:45] have treasures in heaven and come and
[1:15:48] take up a cross and follow me and he was
[1:15:53] said at that saying and he when we
[1:15:56] grieve for he had great possessions may
[1:16:00] the Lord bless the reading of his word
[1:16:02] now we're going to speak tonight on a
[1:16:05] subject I want my text to be follow me
[1:16:08] and a subject leadership that's a
[1:16:12] strange but I thought maybe today and
[1:16:14] praying now been so long and each night
[1:16:16] right down the line on the message that
[1:16:20] I have the Lord has given to me to speak
[1:16:23] on I thought tonight over in this new
[1:16:25] chapter I would approach it from a
[1:16:28] different standpoint and many times
[1:16:31] we've talked on this toilet the rich
[1:16:33] young ruler and many of the ministers
[1:16:36] share my brother no doubt if approached
[1:16:38] it in many different ways and I will try
[1:16:40] to approach it in a different way
[1:16:41] tonight and I ever had this of
[1:16:45] leadership this remember this that each
[1:16:49] one of us young and old your first step
[1:16:52] that you ever made in your life
[1:16:54] someone had to lead you that's right and
[1:16:58] your last step you ever make someone
[1:17:02] will be leading you someone has to lead
[1:17:05] god has likened us unto sheep and if
[1:17:10] anyone knows about raising sheep and the
[1:17:12] nature of sheep while you know that a
[1:17:15] sheep cannot find his way around he has
[1:17:19] to be led even in the slaughter pens we
[1:17:22] find that they bring the sheep there and
[1:17:25] he's led up into the slaughter by a goat
[1:17:28] a goat leads them up then when he gets
[1:17:30] up to the other chute he jumps out the
[1:17:32] sheep goes right on into the slaughter
[1:17:33] so they we find that a sheep cannot find
[1:17:37] his way around I remember an experience
[1:17:40] I had with one one time I was State game
[1:17:42] warden in Indiana and I've been out in
[1:17:44] the field and I heard something the most
[1:17:46] pitiful cry and it was a little lamb
[1:17:49] that lost his mama and he couldn't find
[1:17:53] his way to her and the mother couldn't
[1:17:55] find her way to the to the little lamb
[1:17:58] now picked the little fella up and how
[1:18:00] quiet he laid against me and I went
[1:18:02] along there my hands holding a little
[1:18:05] fella and crying and as I heard him hide
[1:18:08] and just snug his little head down
[1:18:10] against me it seemed like he knew that I
[1:18:13] was going to help him about all Rock of
[1:18:17] Ages cleft for me pick me up in the arms
[1:18:21] of the Lord Jesus just be content as I
[1:18:23] know I'm I'm going to go home to be with
[1:18:26] my loved ones
[1:18:27] now thought at the end of my life's
[1:18:29] journey just bring me in your arms Lord
[1:18:31] like that but I know I'll be carried
[1:18:33] across the river then don't the other
[1:18:35] side where there'll be no sorrows and
[1:18:38] sicknesses and things and I'll be with
[1:18:40] the loved ones that I've loved and if
[1:18:43] you study nature there's a great thing
[1:18:47] in nature everything that I that I look
[1:18:50] at and God has made he's the author of
[1:18:52] nature nature runs in continuity all
[1:18:57] nature runs about the same you notice
[1:19:00] everything as I have said I believe last
[1:19:02] evening at nature testifies of God if
[1:19:06] you never had a Bible you can still
[1:19:08] watch nature and know that this Bible is
[1:19:11] the truth I had the privilege of being
[1:19:14] around around the world I've read the
[1:19:16] different phases and I've seen different
[1:19:18] religions than Mohammed's and I've read
[1:19:20] the Koran and seemed to seeks the Jains
[1:19:22] and Muhammad's and the Buddha's and lot
[1:19:25] more but yet each one of them they have
[1:19:29] a philosophy and a book of Creed and a
[1:19:34] book of laws and so forth but our Bible
[1:19:39] is the truth and our God is the only one
[1:19:43] that is right because each one of them
[1:19:46] has support to aggrieve some where were
[1:19:49] their founder is still laying but
[1:19:51] Christianity ports to an open tune and
[1:19:55] can live in the presence of the one that
[1:19:57] was put in there he is alive it's not a
[1:20:01] God that was it's a God that is not a I
[1:20:05] was or will be but I am and all nature
[1:20:09] runs in continuity as I've said talking
[1:20:13] on our church ages which we have the
[1:20:15] books now it's coming out the water it
[1:20:18] out about my writing of the church ages
[1:20:20] and how that we see the church how it's
[1:20:24] matured come up just exactly like all
[1:20:28] nature does and we is talking the other
[1:20:31] day about how the Sun rises in the
[1:20:33] morning it's a little baby real week not
[1:20:36] much strength to it at all and as the
[1:20:38] day goes on it gets stronger stronger
[1:20:40] about eight o'clock it enters school
[1:20:42] like a young boy or young girl and then
[1:20:45] about eleven o'clock it's out of school
[1:20:48] and it's ready for its it's the service

[1:23:12] written here in some scripture now he
[1:23:15] said well this old man will go over
[1:23:17] seemed he's got a lot of horrors in his
[1:23:19] place he said but he's an infidel he
[1:23:22] said if he just about cursed us out if
[1:23:25] we went over there I said but we're not
[1:23:27] getting Oh squirrels here we've been
[1:23:28] camping two weeks and was dirty and
[1:23:30] beard all out on her face yeah he said
[1:23:33] well let's go over so we went a few
[1:23:35] miles down about 20 miles I've been in
[1:23:38] the country down there once before for
[1:23:40] three nights at a Methodist campground
[1:23:42] or they'd been some great things the
[1:23:44] Lord had did a great healing service
[1:23:47] amongst the Methodist people and then we
[1:23:51] went way back over some hills and
[1:23:53] hollers and ridges and you just have to
[1:23:55] know Kentucky to know it what kind of
[1:23:58] place you had to get into and while we
[1:24:00] went back there we come to a house and
[1:24:03] there said an old man - old man sitting
[1:24:06] out there with the old hats locked down
[1:24:08] or their face and and he said there he
[1:24:11] is and said he's a tough one said he
[1:24:13] hates upward of a preacher he said so I
[1:24:16] said well I just better set the car we
[1:24:17] won't get to hunt at all I said you go
[1:24:19] in and asked him if we can hunt so he
[1:24:21] got out started walking in he spoke to
[1:24:24] them and in Kentucky always you know
[1:24:26] it's coming in so forth and so he wound
[1:24:30] up there and he said I just wondered if
[1:24:32] we could hunt awhile on your place the
[1:24:35] old man sitting there about 75 years old
[1:24:38] to back over running down his mouth he
[1:24:40] said spit is it what's your name
[1:24:42] he said my name is wood he said are you

[1:24:47] sleep he said I'm Jim's boys that I'm
[1:24:50] banks yeah well they said old man Jim
[1:24:52] was an honest man said certainly help
[1:24:54] yourself he said I said are you by
[1:24:57] yourself he said naw I my pastor is out
[1:25:01] there he said what is that my pastor is
[1:25:05] out in a car said he's hunting with me
[1:25:07] he said would you don't mean you've got
[1:25:10] the lowdown to you have to told a
[1:25:12] preacher with you wherever you go
[1:25:14] is a rough old character so I thought I
[1:25:17] bring you the
[1:25:18] you know so I got up walked around and
[1:25:21] he said well and you're a preacher huh I
[1:25:24] said yes sir he looked me up and down
[1:25:25] squirrel blood and dirt and he said I
[1:25:29] said just don't look much like as well I
[1:25:31] kind of like that he said you know I
[1:25:34] want to tell you something
[1:25:36] he said I'm supposed to be an infidel I
[1:25:39] said yes you're understood there I said
[1:25:42] all the things much to brag about it Oh
[1:25:43] to you he said well he said I don't know
[1:25:46] he said I'm gonna tell you what I think
[1:25:48] of you guys I said all right he said
[1:25:51] you're barking up the wrong tree
[1:25:52] and how many knows what that means see
[1:25:55] it means it's a lying dog you see the
[1:25:57] coudé is not up there at all is he
[1:25:59] he said you're barking up the wrong tree
[1:26:01] I said that's two opinion and he said
[1:26:04] well he said look you see that all
[1:26:06] chimney stand up there yes I was born up
[1:26:09] there are 75 years ago instead I've
[1:26:12] lived right here in these hills all
[1:26:13] around through all these years and
[1:26:14] instead I've looked towards the skies
[1:26:16] above here and there
[1:26:18] and surely in all these 75 years I would
[1:26:21] have seen something it looked like God
[1:26:22] didn't you think so I Stewart depends on
[1:26:25] what you're looking at here what you're
[1:26:26] looking for
[1:26:27] he said well he said I certainly don't
[1:26:30] believe there is such a creature and
[1:26:32] I'll be you fellows just simply get out
[1:26:34] and swindle the people out of their
[1:26:36] money and everything and that's way it
[1:26:37] goes I said well you're American citizen
[1:26:41] you have a right to your own own
[1:26:43] thinking he said there's one guy one
[1:26:46] time that I heared of he said and I
[1:26:49] would sure if he ever get to talk with
[1:26:53] that person I liked it they asked him a
[1:26:55] few questions
[1:26:56] I said yes sir you said it was a
[1:26:58] preacher you might know it said he had a
[1:27:00] meeting up here and camels feel not
[1:27:03] uncle in a church yard a verb a
[1:27:05] campground and he said I forget his
[1:27:08] names that used to be Indiana and and I
[1:27:11] said oh yes sir and brother would say
[1:27:13] well I don't think and so he said I said
[1:27:17] what about him he said well he said old
[1:27:20] lady somebody up on the hill said you
[1:27:23] know she was dying with cancer and said
[1:27:26] wife and I would go up there of a
[1:27:28] morning to change your bed
[1:27:31] they couldn't even raise her up high
[1:27:32] enough to put her on the bed and said
[1:27:34] this had to pull a draw she and said she
[1:27:36] was dying she'd been to Louisville and
[1:27:39] said the doctors that give her up and
[1:27:41] said she was going to die and her sister
[1:27:44] went up that meeting said that preacher
[1:27:46] was standing up fell on a platform look
[1:27:48] back over the audience and call this
[1:27:50] woman by name and told her when she left
[1:27:52] she took a handkerchief and punted her
[1:27:54] her purse and called this woman's name
[1:27:57] down here 20 miles below here said how
[1:28:00] she was suffering with cancer water
[1:28:01] named wasn't all she'd been through said
[1:28:03] take that handkerchief and go lay it on
[1:28:05] the woman and said the woman will be
[1:28:08] healed of her cancer instead they come
[1:28:11] down here that night said honest I heard
[1:28:13] all four screaming up there I thought
[1:28:15] they had the Salvation Army turned loose
[1:28:16] on top of the hill up there said well I
[1:28:19] said I guess old sisters dead said well
[1:28:22] tomorrow we'll go and get the wagon and
[1:28:24] imma take her out to get to the main
[1:28:25] road and said so they can take her to
[1:28:27] the Undertaker and said that we waited
[1:28:30] no need to go up that time of night said
[1:28:32] it's about a mile up on the hill here
[1:28:34] said we went up there the next morning
[1:28:35] you know what happened that's an ulcer
[1:28:37] he said she was sitting there eating
[1:28:40] fried apple pies and drinking coffee
[1:28:42] with her husband I said you mean that he
[1:28:47] said yes sir
[1:28:49] oh I said naw mister you really don't
[1:28:51] mean that he said what bothers me is
[1:28:54] what how did that man in ever in this
[1:28:58] country and knew that and I said oh you
[1:29:02] don't believe it he said it's the truth
[1:29:03] I said you believed that these Easter
[1:29:06] won't go right up the only hill I can
[1:29:08] prove it to you he's preaching back to
[1:29:09] me now I picked up a apple and and I
[1:29:15] said can I have one of these apples I
[1:29:17] rubbed it on my clothes he said well the
[1:29:19] yellow Jacksons are eating him up I
[1:29:20] guess you can ant ones and I said well I
[1:29:25] bit into it I so that's a nice apple he
[1:29:27] said oh yes said you know what I planted
[1:29:30] that tree there or 40 years ago or
[1:29:32] something like at us or is that right
[1:29:34] yes sir and I said well uh and every
[1:29:38] year I said I noticed we haven't had no
[1:29:40] frost just early August and I said then
[1:29:42] leaves are far off the trees yes sir
[1:29:45] that's rice coming all fall be whatever
[1:29:46] early when this time I said yes sir
[1:29:48] change of subject and he said I said
[1:29:51] well you know on strange I said how that
[1:29:55] SAP goes out of that tree I said
[1:29:58] Nellie's falls off and yet there's no
[1:30:01] one there there having had no frogs to
[1:30:03] kill the leaf and he said well he said
[1:30:07] what's that got to do with what we're
[1:30:08] talking about and I said well on I just
[1:30:11] wonder your mama always said give a
[1:30:13] count up for open hanging itself you
[1:30:15] know son just give me plenty of rope so
[1:30:17] he 109 he said well yes what's that got
[1:30:20] do is I said you know God brings them
[1:30:23] apples up you enjoy those apples and
[1:30:25] le's he said the shades and so forth it
[1:30:28] goes down to follow the year
[1:30:30] I said comes back up again with the
[1:30:33] apples and with the leaves again and he
[1:30:36] said all that's just nature
[1:30:38] see that's just nature I said well of
[1:30:41] course that's nature I said that's
[1:30:43] nature but somebody has to control
[1:30:45] nature see he said you tell me now what
[1:30:50] does that he said well it's just just
[1:30:52] naturally nature I said who is it it
[1:30:55] says to that little leaf now and I said
[1:30:59] now the reason that leaf falls off it's
[1:31:01] because the SAP goes down into the root
[1:31:03] and what if that sap stayed up in the
[1:31:05] tree through the wintertime what would
[1:31:07] happen said we kill the tree well I said
[1:31:09] now what intelligence that runs that
[1:31:13] step down into roots let's get out of
[1:31:15] your now it's coming fall the year get
[1:31:16] down in the roots and hide and stay down
[1:31:18] into the roots like a grave and then
[1:31:20] next spring comes back up again brings
[1:31:23] up more apples and brings up more leaves
[1:31:25] and things he said that's just nature
[1:31:28] it'll do it said the weather the
[1:31:29] changing and old coming all fall I said
[1:31:31] said a book and water on the post out
[1:31:33] there and just if nature none sit down
[1:31:34] the vote on the poster brings it back up
[1:31:36] against it well he said you might have
[1:31:41] something I said think of it while we go
[1:31:43] hunting and he said well you said humph
[1:31:46] where you want to I said I want to come
[1:31:48] back if you'll tell me what intelligence
[1:31:51] runs that sap out of that tree down into
[1:31:55] the roots to stay all winter and come
[1:31:58] the next winner I'll tell you that's the
[1:31:59] same intelligence - told me about that
[1:32:01] woman up there said told Jim I said yes
[1:32:05] sir you said you're not that preacher I
[1:32:08] said would you know his name said yes I
[1:32:11] said Branham he said that's him I said
[1:32:13] that's right
[1:32:14] and you know one led the old man to
[1:32:18] Christ right there on his own testimony
[1:32:19] and a year later I was down there and
[1:32:22] pulled a car
[1:32:23] Indiana license owned in the yard they'd
[1:32:25] moved away hid died and still want to
[1:32:27] come back there stood his wife to really
[1:32:29] break the offer I thought I had
[1:32:32] permission to huh
[1:32:33] and she come out there she said can't
[1:32:35] you read us and she said did you see
[1:32:38] those signs saying no honey and I said
[1:32:40] yes ma'am but I said I have permission
[1:32:42] you do not have permissions he said and
[1:32:45] said we've got this peut place posted
[1:32:47] for many years I said well sister I was
[1:32:50] wrong and I'm sorry
[1:32:51] he said sorry nothing maybe Indiana
[1:32:53] license on there set up here you're the
[1:32:55] bulrush people I said could I just
[1:32:57] explain it I said she who gave you
[1:33:00] permission I said I don't know just I
[1:33:03] said it was an elderly man a setting hot
[1:33:05] guy on her porch when I was down here
[1:33:07] last year we was talking about God see
[1:33:10] and she look she said are you brother
[1:33:12] Branham I said yes ma'am she said
[1:33:16] forgive me I didn't know who you were
[1:33:18] should I want to tell you testimonial is
[1:33:20] last dying hours you raised up his hands
[1:33:23] and praise God said he died in Christian
[1:33:26] faith miss caraway to God if they hold
[1:33:29] their peace the rocks will immediately
[1:33:31] crime there's something in nature watch
[1:33:34] the birds watch the animals watch
[1:33:36] everything and you watch nature watch
[1:33:39] the little dove how he flies what a
[1:33:41] different birdie is see he he doesn't
[1:33:44] have any gold he can't eat like the crow
[1:33:46] can see he has no gall in him he doesn't
[1:33:49] have to take a bath in the water because
[1:33:52] he's got something on the inside of him
[1:33:54] it cleans me from the inside out
[1:33:56] see that's why the Christian is that's
[1:33:58] why God represent himself and and a dove
[1:34:01] deeper calls and the Jesus was
[1:34:04] represented as a lamb always in nature
[1:34:06] you'll find God and God liken us on to
[1:34:10] she
[1:34:11] that has to be led did you ever notice
[1:34:14] how a priestess terminology sometimes a
[1:34:16] goal that those dove coming down on the
[1:34:19] lamb to lead the lamb and it led him to
[1:34:22] the slaughter that that dove now that
[1:34:25] that dove could not have descended upon
[1:34:27] any other type of animal because they
[1:34:30] both had to be of the same nature see if
[1:34:33] the dog would have lit up on a wolf and
[1:34:35] he would have snorted or growl the Dove
[1:34:37] would have took its flight well that's
[1:34:39] the same way now and are your ways the
[1:34:42] Holy Spirit just takes this flight and
[1:34:43] goes away it's got to have the same
[1:34:45] nature the bird of the heavens the Dove
[1:34:48] the meekest animal on earth the land
[1:34:51] they can agree together and when the
[1:34:53] Holy Spirit comes upon us and makes us
[1:34:55] new creatures then he could lead us but
[1:34:57] we try to live the same alive it won't
[1:34:59] work it just won't work
[1:35:01] now the first step you've probably ever
[1:35:05] taken in your life speaking of
[1:35:06] leadership it was probably the hands of
[1:35:09] some kind own mother them hands maybe
[1:35:12] still tonight out there some cemetery
[1:35:14] somewhere but that was a hand that helps
[1:35:17] you to make your first step then at your
[1:35:20] mother taught you how to walk and you
[1:35:22] make a few steps then fall down and get
[1:35:24] up and you thought you were doing great
[1:35:26] things then she turns you over to the
[1:35:29] schoolteacher and then she begin to lead
[1:35:33] you to an education how what you must do
[1:35:36] and how you must learn and and so forth
[1:35:38] like that then after the school teacher
[1:35:41] got through with you then you returned
[1:35:43] back your father got ahold of you then
[1:35:46] when your father got older to eat touch
[1:35:48] you perhaps your business how to be a
[1:35:51] successful businessman how to do things
[1:35:54] right your mother taught you how to be a
[1:35:56] housewife how to cook and so forth like
[1:35:59] that then after they got through with
[1:36:02] you then your minister or priest got a
[1:36:05] hold of you but now who leads you that's
[1:36:09] the question now now we're all led by
[1:36:13] something tonight we have to be we
[1:36:16] relate notice now let's look at this
[1:36:21] young fellas
[1:36:23] what had influenced him let's look at
[1:36:26] the this young businessman we would call
[1:36:29] him because he was a businessman he was
[1:36:31] a great successful man let's look at his
[1:36:33] leaders perhaps first his mother had
[1:36:36] taught him as a little boy the things
[1:36:38] that he should do his father had mating
[1:36:41] such a fine success maybe lefted him and
[1:36:45] elect him an inheritance because he was
[1:36:48] a ruler himself perhaps his father was
[1:36:51] gone so he is a businessman he was uh
[1:36:55] let's call him today I like a Christian
[1:36:58] businessman or he was a religious
[1:37:01] businessman I think would be the best
[1:37:02] quotation this man was religious he was
[1:37:05] by no means an infidel and he had been
[1:37:08] taught by his mother how to do right how
[1:37:11] to walk how to dress himself he had been
[1:37:13] taught by his father a great business
[1:37:16] and how to be a successful man and his
[1:37:19] business was successful and father and
[1:37:21] mother had been raised up in the church
[1:37:23] and have pointed him to the priest and
[1:37:25] the priest had made him a real religious
[1:37:28] man therefore he was a fine cultured man
[1:37:31] he was a fine boy with good character if
[1:37:35] Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him
[1:37:37] there was something about the boy it was
[1:37:39] real right or the Bible said here we
[1:37:41] find out a mark and jesus beholding him
[1:37:44] loved him yes jesus beholding him loved
[1:37:47] him so therefore they must be something
[1:37:50] real outstanding about this young fellow
[1:37:54] he was I had a good character good
[1:37:56] character reading he was a man that was
[1:37:59] raised right intelligent smart
[1:38:01] intellectual successful in business and
[1:38:04] a religious man he had a lot of good
[1:38:07] characteristics that was outstanding so
[1:38:09] much that it attracted the attention of
[1:38:11] Jesus Christ the Savior but when he was
[1:38:14] confronted being successful in all these
[1:38:17] other things nothing had went wrong he
[1:38:20] was perfectly cut out right measured
[1:38:23] upright intelligent right education his
[1:38:26] success he's smart a fine businessman
[1:38:29] probably belong to a business man's
[1:38:31] group some were there in Palestine he
[1:38:34] might have belonged to a business man's
[1:38:36] fellowship like we have your
[1:38:38] no doubt he did because businessman has
[1:38:41] always had fellowships with another one
[1:38:43] with the other
[1:38:44] calls just like birds of a feather they
[1:38:46] have things to talk about and if this
[1:38:48] for the religious man they don't want to
[1:38:50] talk about the man that runs the barroom
[1:38:51] and all of that because they have
[1:38:53] nothing in common we've got to have
[1:38:56] things in common so Christians has
[1:38:58] things in common with Christians sinners
[1:39:00] has things in common with with sinners
[1:39:03] and societies and whatever they are they
[1:39:07] have things in common this young boy
[1:39:09] probably belonged to a business man's
[1:39:13] fellowship and he was religious as he
[1:39:16] could be because Jesus in questioning
[1:39:18] here he said I have kept these
[1:39:21] Commandments observed them all from my
[1:39:23] youth that's right see he had been
[1:39:25] brought up right taught right and
[1:39:27] everything but when he was confronted
[1:39:29] with the the thought of eternal life now
[1:39:36] I want you to notice of all this
[1:39:38] character that he had he knew he did not
[1:39:42] possess eternal life now all of our
[1:39:48] societies our church our membership and
[1:39:53] the things that we hold so dear are
[1:39:55] American societies and everything is
[1:40:00] very fine there's nothing to be said
[1:40:01] against that and our Christian
[1:40:04] businessmen society here is a great
[1:40:06] thing it's been an open door for me too
[1:40:09] oh my interdenominational thoughts that
[1:40:11] we are Christians there is no one no one
[1:40:15] denomination can claim us real
[1:40:18] Christians because you belong to God
[1:40:19] denominations are man-made and
[1:40:22] Christianity is heaven-sent but in all
[1:40:26] these things that we have as good as
[1:40:29] they are as fine as we come together and
[1:40:31] is nice of meetings as we have and
[1:40:34] social understanding that we have yet we
[1:40:37] are each one confronted with eternal
[1:40:40] life no matter how successful we've been
[1:40:45] in business how successful we've been
[1:40:47] and what a great church remember we are
[1:40:49] we work how we try to do things right
[1:40:52] still if it's not done in the right way
[1:40:55] it is a worship of God in vain Jesus
[1:41:00] placed that the same way as I stopped
[1:41:02] here for a moment he said in vain do you
[1:41:05] worship Me teaching for doctrines the
[1:41:07] commandments of man now thank a sincere
[1:41:11] honest worship with the sincerity of
[1:41:14] your heart to God and still be in vain
[1:41:18] it begin that way with Cain at the
[1:41:21] Garden of Eden sincere worship but was
[1:41:25] rejected very religious still rejected
[1:41:30] it's three-port last week week 4 last of
[1:41:33] the business man's meeting a breakfast
[1:41:35] hours several hundreds of people
[1:41:37] together I took two and a half hours to
[1:41:40] speak on doing God of service without
[1:41:42] being God's will no that sounds strange
[1:41:47] but we've got to channel ourselves into
[1:41:51] God's provided channel and God's Way of
[1:41:55] doing it no matter how much we think
[1:41:57] it's right
[1:41:58] it's got to be according to the word of
[1:42:00] the Lord or it's in vain Cain worship
[1:42:03] but it wasn't cording to the word of the
[1:42:05] Lord
[1:42:06] the Pharisees worship but not according
[1:42:09] to the word of the Lord and in this
[1:42:11] particular message to the businessman I
[1:42:14] taught this David he wanted to do the
[1:42:18] Lord of service and he was right and
[1:42:21] what he said he said is it right for the
[1:42:23] Ark of the Lord to be done let's bring
[1:42:25] it up here in the days of the king the
[1:42:27] other king and he succeeded he said it's
[1:42:30] not right they never consulted the Lord
[1:42:32] by the ark but we must do it now that's
[1:42:35] correct what they should he said we
[1:42:38] should go get the ark and we could
[1:42:39] consult the Lord and that's right he was
[1:42:42] down in another country so we got to
[1:42:43] bring it up here get up here and put it
[1:42:46] on I'll sure and worship the Lord now
[1:42:48] notice he went in the wrong channel to
[1:42:51] do it he consulted the captains of 50s
[1:42:55] and hundreds and thousands they all was
[1:42:58] consulted everyone see it was the will
[1:43:00] of the Lord the blacker it was the
[1:43:02] Lord the word of the Lord sometimes you
[1:43:04] had to put it in its right place or it's
[1:43:07] not the will of the Lord I'll let that
[1:43:11] soak deep and you'll get a general
[1:43:14] conception of what I'm trying to say I
[1:43:17] don't want the church to fall into the
[1:43:19] steps that you found over there in
[1:43:20] England long hair and painted face man
[1:43:24] and pervert we don't want that no matter
[1:43:30] how religious it sounds and how much
[1:43:32] Elvis Presley can sing religious songs
[1:43:34] he's still a devil I'm no judge but by
[1:43:37] their fruits you know them
[1:43:40] he's a Pentecostal that don't make a bit
[1:43:42] of difference me your fruits bear record
[1:43:45] what you are I'm at the screen comes up
[1:43:48] behind me because speak in tongues he
[1:43:49] gets out he could heal the stick in
[1:43:51] Jesus said many of them will come to me
[1:43:52] in that day Lord have not done this and
[1:43:54] that not say depart from me you that
[1:43:56] work iniquity I never even knew you
[1:43:59] we've got to be real genuine Christians
[1:44:03] and the only way we can do that is
[1:44:05] confronted with this question here of
[1:44:07] eternal life there's only one form of
[1:44:10] eternal life and that comes from God and
[1:44:12] he foreordained every creature that
[1:44:14] would ever have it just as you were the
[1:44:16] chain and your father he was a chain in
[1:44:19] God one of his attributes to begin with
[1:44:22] or you'll never be there you come forth
[1:44:26] in the bedding ground of your mother
[1:44:27] your father didn't know you you were in
[1:44:29] his lines and when you come forth in the
[1:44:31] bedding ground of the mother then you
[1:44:33] become a human being in the made in the
[1:44:35] image of your father
[1:44:36] now you can fellowship with him in the
[1:44:38] same thing by God if you've got eternal
[1:44:41] life the life that you come in the
[1:44:43] natural life physical life that was by
[1:44:45] your father and the only way you can
[1:44:47] come born-again is the only way is that
[1:44:49] has to be from your heavenly father is
[1:44:51] attributes all the father has given me
[1:44:54] will come to me you're here because your
[1:44:59] name were placed on the Lamb's Book of
[1:45:01] Life before there was even a foundation
[1:45:04] of the world
[1:45:05] exactly right you're a gene a spiritual
[1:45:08] gene out of your heavenly Father a part
[1:45:11] of God's Word that beast toys I've said
[1:45:14] then you must with Jesus when
[1:45:16] we share because he was the word you
[1:45:18] suffer with him died with him buried
[1:45:20] with him and rose with him and I was
[1:45:22] sitting in heavenly places in him notice
[1:45:25] David thought everything was fine and he
[1:45:28] consulted all these people and they
[1:45:30] everyone began to dance and shout and
[1:45:32] scream they had all the religious
[1:45:34] motions that there was but still it
[1:45:37] wasn't God's will to go down and bring
[1:45:39] the Word of God back to the house of God
[1:45:41] but you see God always in all ages worse
[1:45:45] through one wait his first decision is
[1:45:49] his only decision because he's perfect
[1:45:51] in his decisions he never does nothing
[1:45:55] except he first reveals it to his
[1:45:57] servants the prophets exactly that's why
[1:46:00] this the church age that we live in
[1:46:02] there's no church no Methodist Baptist
[1:46:04] Pentecostals or anything else can ever
[1:46:06] put this church into the bride it'll
[1:46:08] have to be the answering of Malachi 4
[1:46:10] for God to send a prophet to be revealed
[1:46:13] to calls that's the only way our church
[1:46:15] is denominated throw the thing into a
[1:46:16] mess and huddle it's like they've always
[1:46:18] been and God always sends the prophets
[1:46:21] and there was Nathan standing in the
[1:46:24] land of vindicated prophet before god
[1:46:26] and he wasn't even consulted and they
[1:46:29] went down there and calls a life of an
[1:46:30] honest man and so forth and took the ark
[1:46:33] instead of putting on a shoulders of a
[1:46:35] Levi stew packet they put it on a cart
[1:46:37] to pack it all together messed up see if
[1:46:40] you don't go according to the the will
[1:46:43] of God and the way that God has give us
[1:46:45] to go they always get it messed up and
[1:46:47] take it off in some organization
[1:46:48] denomination some message and there you
[1:46:50] go I think it's always been done that
[1:46:52] way that's the same thing that this boy
[1:46:54] was confronted with he come in in a
[1:46:57] member of maybe the Pharisees are
[1:46:59] Sadducees are some great order of
[1:47:02] that day he was religious as he could be
[1:47:05] he said I've observed these Commandments
[1:47:07] have been taught since there was a youth
[1:47:09] see and she's just love depart but he
[1:47:13] refused to be God he refused to accept
[1:47:18] the real leadership of Jesus Christ to
[1:47:21] give him each our life Norris he bleed
[1:47:25] there was something different than what
[1:47:27] he had or he remember said
[1:47:29] good master what must I do now see you
[1:47:33] want to do something self that's what we
[1:47:36] do we want to do something herself the
[1:47:37] gift of God is a free gift God give it
[1:47:40] to you don't do one thing for he
[1:47:42] ordained it to you and you're going to
[1:47:44] have it Hey
[1:47:46] notice he knew it was her he believes in
[1:47:48] it and wanted it but when he was
[1:47:50] confronted with how he had to do it he
[1:47:52] was different from his ritual he was
[1:47:54] different he could hold his money and
[1:47:56] blong onto the church that he belong to
[1:47:58] and so forth but jesus knew that annuity
[1:48:01] hoarded this money and he said go sell
[1:48:03] all you've got he'd give it to the poor
[1:48:05] and come take up your cross and follow
[1:48:07] me you'll have treasures in heaven but
[1:48:10] he couldn't do it there are other
[1:48:11] leaders and he had had in his youthful
[1:48:14] days had such an influence on him till
[1:48:16] he refused to accept God's provided wave
[1:48:21] which was Jesus Christ the only one who
[1:48:23] holds eternal life the only one that can
[1:48:26] give you not the church can't give you
[1:48:28] eternal life not your neighbor not your
[1:48:31] pastor not your priest not your Creed
[1:48:34] only Jesus Christ Himself can give you
[1:48:37] eternal life come on I good you are what
[1:48:40] you could do it once you start doing
[1:48:42] you've got to accept the person of the
[1:48:46] Lord Jesus Christ then when you do that
[1:48:49] he is the word and then your life fits
[1:48:52] right in the word and it manifests
[1:48:55] itself to this age that you're living in
[1:48:56] no one had to do that for the word to be
[1:48:59] manifested in his age
[1:49:00] now what if Moses come along said we
[1:49:03] know what Noah done we're taking
[1:49:04] no-one's word we'll do it this way Noah
[1:49:08] did it
[1:49:08] we'll build a Ark and float down the
[1:49:11] Nile River and go out of Egypt what
[1:49:13] wouldn't work see that was another age
[1:49:15] Jesus couldn't come with Moses message
[1:49:18] Luther couldn't come with the Catholic
[1:49:21] message the Wesley couldn't come with
[1:49:23] the loser's message the Pentecost
[1:49:25] couldn't come with the Wesley a message
[1:49:27] and a bride can't be farmed in the
[1:49:30] Pentecostal denomination it just can't
[1:49:32] do it
[1:49:32] that's exactly right she's done organize
[1:49:35] and went out here and there she sets
[1:49:36] just like the rest of it's a shuck just
[1:49:39] like the live comes up through the sea
[1:49:41] that rider is I spoke the other night
[1:49:43] that writer that wrote this book and not
[1:49:45] cause he criticized me so that said I
[1:49:47] was a devil if there was such a thing so
[1:49:50] he said he didn't believe in God he said
[1:49:52] that God could fold his arms and set up
[1:49:54] and watch them martyrs through the early
[1:49:57] ages and claimed I have power to open
[1:49:59] the Red Sea and let them women and
[1:50:02] children be tore to pieces by lines and
[1:50:04] so forth and then said he was a loving
[1:50:06] God so there's no such a creature see
[1:50:08] the fellow without inspiration of the
[1:50:10] word fails to see it the first part of
[1:50:13] wheat the bridegroom had to fall into
[1:50:15] the earth and order to rise again so did
[1:50:19] the first bride that was born at
[1:50:21] Pentecost had to go through that dark
[1:50:24] ages like any other seed be buried in
[1:50:26] they had to die they must do it but it
[1:50:30] started sprouting again and Luther in
[1:50:32] the first revelation it did look back to
[1:50:34] see that whenever was the light of that
[1:50:36] day the lost dog then went on into the
[1:50:39] tassel Wesley and from the tallest land
[1:50:42] of Pentecost the show when you see into
[1:50:44] the wheat when he comes forth the corner
[1:50:46] wheat a man that's raise wheat you go
[1:50:49] out and see that wheat farm in there it
[1:50:50] looks just exactly like the green but if
[1:50:53] you'll take a tweezer and sit down and
[1:50:55] take that wheat and open up there's no
[1:50:56] grain there at all it's just a choke and
[1:50:59] then what is its farm there to hold a
[1:51:03] green sea and then the first thing you
[1:51:04] know the life left thee there's the
[1:51:06] stock to go into the tow so let the
[1:51:08] Stossel go into the shop it leaves the
[1:51:11] ship and goes into the wheat three
[1:51:13] stages see of it and then forearms the
[1:51:15] wheat outside of the three stages Luther
[1:51:19] Wesley Pentecost exactly see no doubt
[1:51:23] you can't interrupt nature
[1:51:25] now look every three years add your
[1:51:28] message as went for sent from God they
[1:51:30] organized this has been 20 years there's
[1:51:34] no organization it won't see now the
[1:51:36] shuck has to pull away give the weed a
[1:51:39] chance to lay before the Sun to ripen um
[1:51:41] the message coming right back into the
[1:51:44] church again farming the body of Jesus
[1:51:47] Christ just like the first rich one that
[1:51:49] went into the ground now to see the
[1:51:52] eternal life the life sure that the
[1:51:56] stop back here carried the life
[1:51:58] certainly it did but to see when it
[1:52:01] become the stalk and it was finished the
[1:52:03] organization the life I got on it -
[1:52:05] Wesley come on out and once each one
[1:52:08] I've won a big blade don't look like the
[1:52:10] grain but when the little pollen comes
[1:52:12] like there on the shutter on this dog
[1:52:15] the pollen of the tassel it looks a
[1:52:18] whole lot like the green but when he
[1:52:19] comes down to that shook it's almost
[1:52:22] there did Jesus say in the last days
[1:52:25] Mathew 24:24 the two would be so close
[1:52:28] to it would to see they're very genes
[1:52:32] predestinated the elected ones if it was
[1:52:36] possible almost like the real thing so
[1:52:39] in the last days now you see it sweet
[1:52:42] time now it's getting harvest time this
[1:52:46] is not Luther's age this is not
[1:52:47] Pentecost age this is a bride and as
[1:52:50] Moses called
[1:52:52] a nation out of a nation Christ today is
[1:52:55] calling a church out of a jury you see
[1:52:58] the same thing a type take them to the
[1:53:00] glorious eternal promised land now to
[1:53:03] refuse that person that's doing the
[1:53:05] calling Christ no matter if you're a pic
[1:53:08] also Methodist loser whatever you are
[1:53:11] you've got to this age nothing against
[1:53:13] them not at all but in this age now
[1:53:17] you've got to accept like they did in
[1:53:19] that age the person of Christ which is
[1:53:22] the word in the beginning was the word
[1:53:25] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:53:26] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:53:29] dwelt among us the same yesterday today
[1:53:31] and forever in Hebrews 13:8 believe you
[1:53:34] must accept that person of eternal life
[1:53:39] and what life Luther had was
[1:53:41] justification Wesley had sanctification
[1:53:44] added to it the Pentecost had the
[1:53:46] restoration of the gifts coming back in
[1:53:48] an attitude but now it's completing in
[1:53:51] the body you see the three phases of it
[1:53:53] and out of that then when the
[1:53:54] resurrection comes to life that will
[1:53:56] leave to them Lutheran's this one out
[1:53:58] the life that lived in the Methodist and
[1:54:00] went up the life of one of the
[1:54:01] Pentecostals will all be raptured out of
[1:54:04] the ground in the body of the bride to
[1:54:07] be taken in before Jesus Christ
[1:54:09] glory to God oh it's exciting it's the
[1:54:15] truth
[1:54:16] we've turned a corner we're looking
[1:54:20] towards heaven watching farther come as
[1:54:23] a cap on the pyramid as we would say
[1:54:25] this coming back the church must be
[1:54:29] resurrected soon and we must get ready
[1:54:31] and the only way you can is not say well
[1:54:34] I belong to the same ways I belong to
[1:54:36] the women's Tunis or whatever it is all
[1:54:38] in there I belong to church you got that
[1:54:40] don't mean a thing
[1:54:41] our fathers shouted in dance that's
[1:54:43] perfectly all right that Missouri but
[1:54:45] today you're confronted not with the
[1:54:48] organization they made but with the life
[1:54:51] it's going on with you Jesus Christ this
[1:54:54] young fellow had done the same thing
[1:54:56] Moses wrote those Commandments but you
[1:54:59] see the same God that wrote the
[1:55:01] commandments by His Prophet was the same
[1:55:03] thing he prophesied the day would come
[1:55:05] I'll raise up a prophet like a nun to me
[1:55:07] it'll come to pass that all they don't
[1:55:10] hear him will be cut off back in the
[1:55:12] denominational shuts into All Souls they
[1:55:15] must go on July and today don't say I'm
[1:55:17] Pentecost I belong to this I belong to
[1:55:20] that that don't mean nothing you've got
[1:55:23] to accept the person right eternal life
[1:55:27] confronts every one of us don't forget
[1:55:29] that no other leaders you see it adds
[1:55:31] such a hold on their people says talk
[1:55:33] well we belong to this and we belong to
[1:55:35] that it had such a whole line but what a
[1:55:37] fatal thing to reject the leadership of
[1:55:41] eternal life now that life is present
[1:55:45] tonight that's right the Holy Spirit is
[1:55:48] here which is Christ in spirit born his
[1:55:51] spirit the anointing is sure a little
[1:55:53] while the world sees me no more yet ye
[1:55:56] will see me for I'll be with you even in
[1:55:58] you to the consummation to the in the
[1:56:00] world Jesus alone can lead you to that
[1:56:04] eternal life there's no church no
[1:56:06] denomination no preacher no priest no
[1:56:09] nothing else can lead you to it you must
[1:56:11] be led by him the only one that can lead
[1:56:17] you could you imagine lead you out of
[1:56:19] his word which that's him and if he is
[1:56:22] the
[1:56:22] and you're a part of him won't you be a
[1:56:24] part of the work the word that God wants
[1:56:27] to pour the waters of salvation upon
[1:56:30] today to identify him today
[1:56:34] like the apostle's identified like
[1:56:36] Luther like Wesley like the people in
[1:56:39] their days identified and this is
[1:56:40] another age it's the word the word said
[1:56:43] these things that we're seeing taking
[1:56:45] place now is predicted to take place in
[1:56:47] this hour so accept Jesus Christ and let
[1:56:50] him lead you through the eternal life
[1:56:52] though he to achieve this young fellow
[1:56:55] he had achieved all good things you
[1:56:57] school been fine as a good boy no doubt
[1:57:01] it been good as a real father and
[1:57:04] listening to his daddy in business he'd
[1:57:06] been a good a good boy good to his
[1:57:08] parents he'd been loyal to his priest
[1:57:10] he'd been loyal to his church he'd been
[1:57:13] loyal to the commandments of God but he
[1:57:15] lost the greatest thing and the rest of
[1:57:18] them that mean very much to him when he
[1:57:20] turned down the leadership of eternal
[1:57:24] life Jesus Christ
[1:57:27] notice this leadership confronts every
[1:57:31] one of us today the same thing as it did
[1:57:35] that young man we no matter how
[1:57:36] religious we are you may be Catholic you
[1:57:39] may be Baptist Methodist or you may be
[1:57:40] Pentecostals or whatever you are this
[1:57:42] same thing confronts you tonight eternal
[1:57:46] life
[1:57:47] that's acceptance of Jesus Christ we're
[1:57:51] given this opportunity some time in life
[1:57:53] we have to confront the thing just like
[1:57:55] this young man did because you are a
[1:57:57] mortal being and you're giving that
[1:58:00] you're giving the opportunity of choice
[1:58:02] you have a choice God made it so you can
[1:58:06] choose if he put Adam and Eve on free
[1:58:08] moral agency so they could choose and
[1:58:10] then they made the wrong choice and si
[1:58:13] can do two more to you than he did to
[1:58:15] them he's got to put you the same thing
[1:58:17] so you can choose our reject you have a
[1:58:20] choice let's look at some of them you
[1:58:22] have a choice as a young man whether
[1:58:23] year ago to have an education around you
[1:58:26] have that choice you can walk to abuse
[1:58:27] not have it you just reduce it you have
[1:58:30] a choice of your condom I'm going to
[1:58:32] hurt just a little bit here
[1:58:34] you can go out let your hair grow down
[1:58:36] and be a beetle or some of these
[1:58:37] ignoramuses or you women you can look
[1:58:40] like a decent human being or you could
[1:58:42] be one of these weird creatures that if
[1:58:44] you have out there that brood eyes and
[1:58:46] water head haircuts and things are
[1:58:49] completely against the Word of God which
[1:58:51] is absolutely contrary not even offer it
[1:58:54] could offer a prayer to be accepted
[1:58:55] that's true exactly right so what the
[1:58:59] Bible said but what's happened to your
[1:59:02] church you've seen so much television so
[1:59:06] much things the world is so easy for
[1:59:08] your ol atom nature to drift into that
[1:59:11] to act like the rest of them may I
[1:59:14] repeat this again in the kosha
[1:59:17] in the offering of the Tollman in the
[1:59:20] days of Moses when Moses brought the
[1:59:22] children out there was to be seven days
[1:59:25] that there was to be no eleven among the
[1:59:28] people anyone knows that in Exodus no
[1:59:31] eleven should be found in your tap at
[1:59:33] all seven days that seven days represent
[1:59:36] a full seven Church ages no eleven now
[1:59:40] what is that no Creed no world jesus
[1:59:44] said if you love the world are the
[1:59:45] things of the world the love of God is
[1:59:47] not even in you and we're trying to mix
[1:59:50] that you can't do it you've got to come
[1:59:54] to one thing to believe you're either
[1:59:57] gonna breathe God you're gonna believe
[1:59:58] your church you're gonna be the world or
[2:00:00] you cannot mix it together
[2:00:04] and you can't hold them all things that
[2:00:06] the other church before you did you've
[2:00:08] got to take the message of the hour he
[2:00:11] said what was left over don't let his
[2:00:13] state till morning to come into this
[2:00:15] other age burn it with father be
[2:00:17] destroyed that the age that you're
[2:00:20] living in the message of this age it's
[2:00:22] got to be brought out of the scriptures
[2:00:24] and vindicated and proved by God that is
[2:00:27] God doing so then you either he see that
[2:00:30] are rejected that's eternal life
[2:00:33] leadership of the Holy Spirit leading
[2:00:36] his church we can still know long time
[2:00:39] let's move just keep moving along the
[2:00:41] choice of your conduct you could you
[2:00:45] can't mix it now you're in a far god
[2:00:47] against God and that outward expressions
[2:00:50] shows exactly what's on the inside the
[2:00:56] cocklebur
[2:00:57] many of you think I got two badges only
[2:00:59] goes I'm going to heaven that don't mean
[2:01:00] one thing that you're going to hit don't
[2:01:03] sir you have the baptism the Holy goes
[2:01:04] to every hour in your life is still be
[2:01:06] lost and go to hell the Bible system
[2:01:09] it's exactly right look here you are a
[2:01:12] outside person you have five senses it
[2:01:15] contacts that outside body God gave you
[2:01:17] five states is not to contact him your
[2:01:19] earthly home see taste feel smelling
[2:01:21] here then you have a spirit on the
[2:01:23] inside of that and it has five outlets
[2:01:25] conscience love so forth
[2:01:27] five outlets that you contact the spirit
[2:01:29] world with that but with your spirit
[2:01:32] your physical contacts are physical your
[2:01:36] spiritual context is spiritual but
[2:01:38] inside of that you've got a soul that
[2:01:42] soul is that gene they come from God and
[2:01:46] like a baby farmed in his mother's womb
[2:01:48] when the baby comes into the to the
[2:01:52] mother's womb but the little germ he
[2:01:54] crawls into the egg it doesn't form one
[2:01:56] cell a human the next the dog the next
[2:01:58] to cap the next to horse it's all human
[2:02:01] self because it's building off of an
[2:02:03] original human self and when a man has
[2:02:07] been born again by the Word of God
[2:02:10] predestinated an eternal life called the
[2:02:12] elected it'll be worth a god Oh
[2:02:16] topper word word on words not a
[2:02:18] denomination creed and then a word to
[2:02:20] create what you can't have that lemon in
[2:02:23] it
[2:02:24] only one eternal life Jesus Christ the
[2:02:28] word in the beginning was the word the
[2:02:31] Word was with God and the Word was God
[2:02:33] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[2:02:35] among Brennan you feed my children
[2:02:38] you're saying the across the mission
[2:02:40] fields to the world to bring the message
[2:02:42] I got to be sincere with you what I'm
[2:02:45] looking at maybe you don't see that's
[2:02:48] what I'm here to try to tell you it's
[2:02:50] not because I don't love people it's
[2:02:52] because I do love people
[2:02:55] corrective when I see the slipping of
[2:02:57] the church going on say well we did this
[2:02:59] we
[2:03:00] and look around with the church to see
[2:03:01] them it just worked then look here the
[2:03:03] Bible it's got to be that with the Inza
[2:03:05] lukewarm lady of san church age putting
[2:03:08] Jesus out the word you never call you a
[2:03:10] goat culture she said as many as I love
[2:03:12] I rebuke a chest him taking the word and
[2:03:18] pound it on and telling you're wrong and
[2:03:20] that's reason I love you if you open the
[2:03:23] door let me in I'll come in and sup with
[2:03:25] you no church she don't put out of that
[2:03:28] she's headed for that kaminnikov council
[2:03:31] that's where she's gone right back into
[2:03:34] room where she come from Anna it's
[2:03:35] exactly I've got that ruled all paper
[2:03:37] from 25 years ago for 33 years ago and
[2:03:41] there it is not only that's ruled in the
[2:03:42] Bible from vision she's gone back he's
[2:03:44] no we're saving it's gone it's gonna be
[2:03:46] that way God's calling individuals I
[2:03:49] stand at the door and knock any person
[2:03:53] what individual out of a thousand it
[2:03:57] might be one out of a million as I said
[2:04:00] a few nights ago when Israel come up out
[2:04:03] of Egypt there were just two million
[2:04:06] people come and just to me I just want
[2:04:08] to people went in one out of a million
[2:04:12] do you know that Caleb in Joshua and
[2:04:16] Jesus when he was on that they said our
[2:04:18] fathers eat matter learners we're
[2:04:20] keeping the traditions and we're doing
[2:04:21] this we don't worry then he said I know
[2:04:23] your father's deep man on the winners
[2:04:25] and there everyone eternally separated
[2:04:28] they're dead when the spring comes from
[2:04:33] the male or female is the million aches
[2:04:35] comes his immediate germs come and out
[2:04:38] of all them little germs of the kind if
[2:04:41] it's a if it's from the male cow or the
[2:04:43] man or whatever it is there's just
[2:04:45] millions of germs a million germs
[2:04:47] working in there there's only one of
[2:04:49] those germs it's our danger life for
[2:04:53] these one egg or their fertile to meet
[2:04:55] it that's dry only one egg it'll be just
[2:05:00] like this body here sitting here and the
[2:05:02] germ comes from God
[2:05:04] what's that little germ come up among
[2:05:06] all these other germs and wiggle around
[2:05:08] and run all past them go over here and
[2:05:10] find that fertile egg and crawl right
[2:05:12] into it
[2:05:12] the rest of them dies what if it was
[2:05:16] that way with the church today one out
[2:05:18] of a million see where it would be
[2:05:21] straight is a gate areas away and few
[2:05:24] there will be that I'll find it most
[2:05:26] broad is the way that leads to
[2:05:27] destruction and many there will be it
[2:05:29] going there right
[2:05:30] is that Tris program I don't know but I
[2:05:34] miss quoting scripture now your are
[2:05:37] deign to live you see it if your our
[2:05:39] dynasty if you're not our daddy to sit

[2:06:07] the world by the churches as a fanatic
[2:06:09] why did you come the Holy Spirit led you
[2:06:12] yeah listen circumcised cut away the
[2:06:18] things of the world except the
[2:06:19] leadership of Jesus Christ or your
[2:06:21] parish assures the world you have a
[2:06:23] choice of conduct how you conduct
[2:06:26] yourself that's up to you you have a
[2:06:28] choice of life you go out and take your

[2:06:33] take what is complimentary to your to
[2:06:35] watch you or you plan your future home
[2:06:36] to be could you imagine a man a
[2:06:39] Christian man going out and taking one
[2:06:40] these modern Rick at us for a wife could
[2:06:43] you imagine what's the man thinking
[2:06:45] about what type of homes to go to head
[2:06:47] he takes a striptease a bonus all for
[2:06:50] the street out here a Street prostitute

[2:06:59] Sanitation Street prostitute oh you say
[2:07:02] no brother no tight skirts look like
[2:07:04] you're poured into Street prostitute
[2:07:06] Jesus then whosoever looketh upon a
[2:07:09] woman to lust after her has committed
[2:07:10] adultery with her in his heart then he's
[2:07:13] got to answer for that and what'd she do
[2:07:15] she presented herself who's guilty think
[2:07:20] of it you say they don't make any other
[2:07:22] goals they got Goods and sewing machines
[2:07:25] so excuse Ritchie and this is not a joke
[2:07:33] this is thus saith the Lord from the
[2:07:35] scripture it's exactly true friend I'm
[2:07:39] an old man I have got much longer to
[2:07:42] stay but I've got to tell you the truth
[2:07:45] if this is my last message it's the
[2:07:47] truth
[2:07:47] see don't sister don't brother and you
[2:07:50] fellows it's hanging on to a Creed and
[2:07:54] knowing the Word of God being vindicated
[2:07:56] right before you the baptism of the Holy
[2:07:58] Ghost in these realities that we have
[2:08:00] today and then because of your Creed
[2:08:01] turn away from it how can you be a son
[2:08:04] of God in there now the Word of God
[2:08:06] that's predicted for this last days that
[2:08:07] we're having here how can you do it how
[2:08:10] can the Bible call this as I said last
[2:08:12] night about a king one time down in the
[2:08:15] South when they had the colored I never
[2:08:17] sold for slaves well there's no more in
[2:08:19] just a used car market you get a bill of
[2:08:22] sales on alarmed in a little place I
[2:08:26] read when they were a broker come along
[2:08:28] goodbye Simon he said well now they're
[2:08:32] sad you'd have to whip them make them
[2:08:33] work because its way from home they're
[2:08:35] sold slaves and they in a foreign
[2:08:37] country they know nothing about and
[2:08:39] never be back home again and they were
[2:08:40] said you had to whip a make a board but
[2:08:42] this broker come by a certain plantation
[2:08:44] one young follower his chest out his
[2:08:46] chin up he didn't have to whip him he
[2:08:49] was right up he kept the morals the rest
[2:08:50] of the broker said I'll buy him he said
[2:08:52] he's not for sale
[2:08:54] don't go buy him because he's not for
[2:08:56] sale he said well what makes him so much
[2:08:58] difference then is he the boss arrest em
[2:09:00] said no so do you feed him different no
[2:09:03] he's a slave eats out there the galley
[2:09:05] with the rest of them so what makes me
[2:09:07] so much difference he said I wondered
[2:09:08] myself to have found out over in Africa
[2:09:11] or they come one where the Boers bottom
[2:09:13] and bottom over here sold for slaves
[2:09:14] over there his father is a king of the
[2:09:18] tribe and yet an alien away from home he
[2:09:21] knows he's the son of a king so he
[2:09:22] conducts himself that way
[2:09:24] what a rebuke of the Christianity we're
[2:09:28] supposed to represent God in eternal
[2:09:30] life there's only one form of eternal
[2:09:32] life and that's God he alone has eternal
[2:09:35] life and we are products of his because
[2:09:37] we're jeans of his spirit then we should
[2:09:40] conduct ourselves women in man like the
[2:09:43] Bible said for us to do not Jezebel's of
[2:09:47] the street and Ricki's of the
[2:09:48] organization but Christian gentleman
[2:09:51] sons and daughters of God born to the
[2:09:53] Spirit of God manifesting the light in
[2:09:56] our days is scattering it right how far
[2:10:00] we've drifted from watch the same thing
[2:10:02] this boy did here he rejected it refused
[2:10:05] eternal life because it would cost him
[2:10:07] his social standing it cost india
[2:10:10] slitters his luxury of money it cost him
[2:10:15] his fellowship in the church it costs a
[2:10:18] lot of things he no no I was go to cost
[2:10:19] him he was a sensible boy and he felt
[2:10:22] that he couldn't pay the price
[2:10:23] yeah he thought I used to trust my
[2:10:24] religion and go on but down in his heart
[2:10:27] he know there was something about Jesus
[2:10:29] Christ was different from their priest
[2:10:31] of that day coming a genuine born
[2:10:36] message of God is different from the old
[2:10:38] trend when I divine Healy went forth not
[2:10:42] long ago
[2:10:42] you notice how the impersonators
[2:10:44] followed it I never won everybody in
[2:10:46] them organizations stay in there did
[2:10:49] anyone know that there had to be a
[2:10:50] message follow that while God don't
[2:10:53] entertain us here trust our attention
[2:10:56] with something and when he attracts our
[2:10:58] attention then he's got his message look
[2:11:00] when he first first come on the earth
[2:11:01] and start his ministry Oh young rabbi we
[2:11:04] want your ear in our church we bring
[2:11:05] come on down here the young prophet oh
[2:11:07] he wants you over here come here
[2:11:09] but one day he stood up said I and my
[2:11:10] father are one Oh
[2:11:12] mix yourself card except you eat the
[2:11:16] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[2:11:17] blood you have no life in you he's a
[2:11:19] vampire we have nothing to do with that
[2:11:22] them apostles set right there thousands
[2:11:25] lefty but those apostles were ordained
[2:11:28] to life he said so they couldn't explain
[2:11:30] it they believed it they stayed right
[2:11:32] with you because said no man could do
[2:11:34] these works even the priest note that
[2:11:36] Nicodemus said we know
[2:11:38] Sanhedrin Council that no man could do
[2:11:40] these works except it be from God the
[2:11:43] Peter on the day of Pentecost of Jesus
[2:11:46] of Nazareth
[2:11:46] I mean approved of God among God was
[2:11:50] with him
[2:11:51] look at the Scriptures what the
[2:11:52] scriptures say but do Jesus let's search
[2:11:55] the Scriptures in them you think you
[2:11:57] have eternal life they are what
[2:11:58] testifies of me if you were to know
[2:12:01] Moses you know me from Moses wrote that
[2:12:03] I would come in the form that I would
[2:12:05] come in he come as the son of man he
[2:12:08] comes in three names it's God three like
[2:12:11] Father Son and Holy Ghost same God his
[2:12:14] three attributes now the whole sold
[2:12:17] justification and sanctification Luther
[2:12:19] Martin in the Pentecostal same thing
[2:12:22] three attributes three station Street
[2:12:24] Church ages same thing water blood and
[2:12:27] spirit August is you go along the three
[2:12:30] elements it takes you back into the body
[2:12:31] like it brings you from your national
[2:12:34] birth pipes your spiritual birth the
[2:12:36] babies born the first things water X
[2:12:38] blood and life that's where you come
[2:12:41] into the kingdom about the same way
[2:12:42] that's where the church comes in the
[2:12:44] same way same thing now notice on these
[2:12:47] three things God as formed is forming
[2:12:52] his body now we find that in here that
[2:12:55] you have a right in your choice you
[2:12:57] choose the girl you want a marriage
[2:12:58] extension all right then another thing
[2:13:00] you have a choice of whether you want to
[2:13:02] live or whether you don't want to live
[2:13:04] you choose now between life and death
[2:13:09] you can live that boy had that choice
[2:13:12] he's success and everything else a
[2:13:14] religious man but he's known that when
[2:13:17] he's fogarty himself I've observed all
[2:13:20] these Commandments since I was a youth
[2:13:23] but he note he didn't have eternal life
[2:13:26] see and he had a choice to accept it or
[2:13:30] to refuse it and he turned it down that
[2:13:33] was the most fatal mistake he could ever
[2:13:35] made the rest of it what the mountain
[2:13:37] doesn't mount unless you take that
[2:13:39] choice now let us follow him history and
[2:13:42] see warrior daddy to see where he's
[2:13:45] short on I look he was a his rich man
[2:13:47] he's a businessman he was a ruler and he
[2:13:51] was a religion
[2:13:52] man all that today we'd say boy he's a
[2:13:54] genuine Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal
[2:13:58] he's he's a real fella real nice boy fun
[2:14:02] nothing to say about it friendly nice
[2:14:04] sociable and everything
[2:14:05] Noah morals about him you didn't
[2:14:07] probably smoke drinker run around of
[2:14:10] shows and dances and whatever we call
[2:14:12] today is when classic Christian but that
[2:14:14] he's eternal idea daddy what we're
[2:14:17] talking about he might have been loyal
[2:14:19] to his church of what you probably was
[2:14:21] but you see and what did it lead him to
[2:14:23] great popularity let's say if he was a
[2:14:26] preacher he could have been got a better
[2:14:29] Church he could be in a state
[2:14:30] transmitter a vision it leads you to
[2:14:33] popularity and it ready to riches and to
[2:14:36] fame it might do the same thing today
[2:14:39] you have a great talent to sing I
[2:14:41] thought of that young man and while
[2:14:42] we're sing that song here I give that to
[2:14:45] the devil now I get that how differ
[2:14:46] between him and apples Presley and some
[2:14:48] of these Pat Boone in a group like that
[2:14:51] Ernie for God's grace singers and take
[2:14:54] their talents that god-given talents and
[2:14:57] use it to inspire them the works of the
[2:14:59] devil that's right some great singers
[2:15:03] selling their god-given talents for fame
[2:15:05] in this world to become somebody how
[2:15:10] could you become any more of a body and
[2:15:12] you could have been somebody than to be
[2:15:14] a son of God Oh kept you on the whole
[2:15:17] city the whole world and you haven't
[2:15:22] except the leadership of eternal life
[2:15:23] for the Holy Spirit Christ how you go to
[2:15:26] who are you anyhow you're a dead mortal
[2:15:28] dead estate of trespass religious as you
[2:15:32] want to be his faithless you want to be
[2:15:34] to the church preacher if you want to be
[2:15:36] in a pulpit but to turn down you die he
[2:15:44] was a great success he was a great
[2:15:46] success here in his life
[2:15:47] certainly we find him or we knows then
[2:15:50] we find this fella that he went we fall
[2:15:53] him a little bit we see he were gone a
[2:15:54] great successful and we were falling
[2:15:56] through the Bible we noticed that he he
[2:15:59] we find him a rich man he's got such
[2:16:02] great big places he is entertaining the
[2:16:04] judge did the mayor
[2:16:05] city er what board is up on top of his
[2:16:07] roof and he has great banquets and
[2:16:09] plenty of waitresses and women girls and
[2:16:12] everything else around and it's a
[2:16:13] beggarly at the gate named Lazarus he
[2:16:16] sweeps the crumbs off train we know the
[2:16:17] story the next thing it goes on
[2:16:20] successful just like the churches -
[2:16:23] they're getting a businessman sitting
[2:16:25] here telling me right here in California
[2:16:27] that the church has to tell the labor
[2:16:30] union what to do this time in church and
[2:16:34] state again it's right you seek your
[2:16:37] rowdy in there you take the mark of the
[2:16:39] beast not knowing it if you ever bought
[2:16:41] one of my tapes get this one I get when
[2:16:43] I get home the trail of a serpent and
[2:16:45] you see where it's that see where this
[2:16:46] ends up at going home now to speak at
[2:16:49] the Lord building it's about four hours
[2:16:50] so I couldn't keep it above the meeting
[2:16:52] like this I have to go up everywhere the
[2:16:53] church suffers with me Stallone
[2:16:55] patiently notice but now even listed to
[2:16:58] teach sometime in your home notice this
[2:17:01] now we find out that he was a great
[2:17:04] success
[2:17:05] then we find him later till he was a
[2:17:07] greater success until he said I have got
[2:17:09] so much boy year to made a real genuine
[2:17:12] God this day with me even my barns to
[2:17:15] swell down they're bursting I've got so
[2:17:18] much die said oh so take the rest but
[2:17:22] what he done at the beginning he
[2:17:24] rejected the leadership of Jesus Christ
[2:17:26] his church his intelligence his
[2:17:29] education and all relative to a success
[2:17:32] all the Jews loved him he give to them
[2:17:37] he helped them he might have done this
[2:17:38] sound the other but you see he rejected
[2:17:40] the through the leadership of Jesus
[2:17:43] Christ to eternal life
[2:17:44] and that the Bible said he said thou
[2:17:47] fool tonight your soul is required now
[2:17:52] we find the next place inhale lifting up
[2:17:56] his eyes and seeing that better that he
[2:17:59] turned out the street in the bosoms of
[2:18:01] Abraham what a fatal mistake how that
[2:18:05] the churches had had I've been alright
[2:18:09] in the way that they went but they still
[2:18:11] hadn't had eternal life it reminds me of
[2:18:13] a sermon I preached you're not long ago
[2:18:15] of thinking man's filter you've not a
[2:18:17] head it I was going
[2:18:18] walking through the woods a squirrel
[2:18:20] hunting this fall and look down and of
[2:18:22] course I can't call the cigarette
[2:18:23] company you dort and there later a
[2:18:25] cigarette pack laying there and I just
[2:18:27] passed by looking first in the woods I
[2:18:29] seen that package laying there look back
[2:18:31] again it said a thinking man's filter a
[2:18:34] smoking meds taste start walking through
[2:18:38] its and Holy Spirit said turn it pick
[2:18:40] that up now reach down it picked it up a
[2:18:43] thinking man's filter a smoking man's
[2:18:46] taste
[2:18:47] I thought American firm here selling
[2:18:52] this under disguise but to their own
[2:18:55] American citizens a faking man's filter
[2:19:00] you and a smoking man's taste I was at
[2:19:05] the World Fair with you Brian Hernan
[2:19:07] bring her name up there when he giving
[2:19:09] all that test now he put one secret draw
[2:19:11] the across the marble and took the rim
[2:19:14] wiped up the nicotine and put it on a
[2:19:15] rat's back a white red in his seven days
[2:19:18] just the four cancer he couldn't walk
[2:19:20] and they said you know we say a filter
[2:19:23] said it's a gimmick sells more
[2:19:25] cigarettes it takes so much nicotine to
[2:19:30] satisfy that devil it's right and when
[2:19:34] you take a filter cigarette it takes
[2:19:36] four cigarettes to take the place to one
[2:19:38] it's a gimmick to sell you more
[2:19:41] cigarettes you cannot have smoke unless
[2:19:44] you got tolerant are you got cancer sea
[2:19:50] otters and the blind Americans looking
[2:19:52] for a rabbit to come out of a hat
[2:19:54] somewhere they fall apart you can't have
[2:19:59] it it's death I don't care what you wear
[2:20:00] you go it's death anyway you go a
[2:20:04] thinking man's filter a thinking man
[2:20:06] wouldn't smoke at all he's got any
[2:20:10] thoughts at all well I thought that's
[2:20:12] just gonna comply to the churches I
[2:20:15] think as God got a filter yes in every
[2:20:20] church has got a filter it's right they
[2:20:23] built the ones that comes in and they
[2:20:27] let a lot of death into
[2:20:30] how could you ever draw a denomination
[2:20:33] through God's filter how could you do it
[2:20:37] how could you draw a bob haired woman
[2:20:39] through that filter tell me how could
[2:20:48] you ever draw a woman that wears slacks
[2:20:49] through there was the denomination for
[2:20:52] the put on a garment pertains to amazing
[2:20:54] see God's tiller would catch her out
[2:20:56] there it wouldn't let her come in but
[2:20:59] the church has got their own filters so
[2:21:03] I say that there is a thinking man's
[2:21:05] filter that's God's Word and suits a
[2:21:08] holy man's taste let's try to hold him
[2:21:12] in not a church man but a holy man's
[2:21:14] face the cause is pure holiness
[2:21:17] unadulterated Word of God there is a
[2:21:20] thinking man's filter and church member
[2:21:23] advise you to use that one cause it
[2:21:27] brings in the world and one lump of it
[2:21:30] is death one lump Levens or one little
[2:21:33] leaven leavens the whole lump whosoever
[2:21:36] shall take one word out of this or add
[2:21:38] one word to it his part will be taken
[2:21:40] from the book of life at the Garden of
[2:21:42] Eden what calls death and all this
[2:21:44] sorrow ever heartache every little dying
[2:21:47] baby ever rattling the throat ever amber
[2:21:50] screaming every hospital every graveyard
[2:21:52] was because Eve doubted one word not all
[2:21:56] of it
[2:21:56] it's just perverted now God said man
[2:22:00] there he was to keep every word of God
[2:22:02] now that's the first to the Bible in the
[2:22:05] middle of Bible Jesus come and he said
[2:22:07] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:22:09] every word that proceedeth out of the
[2:22:11] mouth of Ellen not as part of him
[2:22:13] everyone in the last the Bible
[2:22:15] revelations 22 Jesus give the testimony
[2:22:18] of himself the revelation of these other
[2:22:20] Bible is Jesus Christ and he said
[2:22:22] whosoever shall take one word out of
[2:22:24] here
[2:22:25] or add one word to it his part will be
[2:22:28] taken to the book of life now you go
[2:22:30] through that thinking man's filter
[2:22:31] you'll have a holy man's taste when you
[2:22:33] come out of there
[2:22:35] you'll have a saintly taste sister you
[2:22:38] that where are those clothes think of it
[2:22:40] you're going to you Stanford used to my
[2:22:42] husband I'm first used to my boyfriend
[2:22:44] I'm a virtuous girl but what about that
[2:22:46] sinner looked at you when he answers for
[2:22:48] adultery who did it guilty
[2:22:52] see written in the word so it's see all
[2:22:55] via peeking woman via Thank You mr.
[2:22:59] David my but what if it does happen to
[2:23:01] be that way he said so in one word Kate
[2:23:03] fail the great man told me not long ago
[2:23:07] call me into the truth so I'm go away
[2:23:08] hands on you brother brandy ruining her
[2:23:10] ministry preach the stuff safe
[2:23:13] I said Indian ministry that the Word of
[2:23:14] God will ruin all to be rude see he said
[2:23:18] I'll lay hands on he said you said to
[2:23:19] pray for this thing I said to you be
[2:23:21] those things brother he said no but it's
[2:23:23] not our business I said whose business
[2:23:25] is to then well he said that's a
[2:23:29] pastor's business I look at the
[2:23:30] congregation see every year I pass
[2:23:36] through preaching these things nothing
[2:23:38] sure they get it next year come back
[2:23:39] more than ever it goes to show that many
[2:23:43] are called but the leadership is the
[2:23:49] Holy Spirit frame it leads you and guide
[2:23:51] you into all truth when he the Holy
[2:23:54] Ghost has come now think of that take
[2:23:57] the thinking man's filter that's the
[2:23:59] Bible not your Creed not your church
[2:24:02] you'll be lost
[2:24:03] take the thinking mids filter that's
[2:24:06] where that boy didn't think he took the
[2:24:09] church filter
[2:24:10] he become popper great man but in hell
[2:24:13] he lifted up his eyes being in torment
[2:24:15] now you take the thinking man's filter
[2:24:18] Jesus Christ the word and you'll desire
[2:24:21] a holy person's taste because it'll
[2:24:23] satisfy that if you've got the Holy
[2:24:25] Spirit in you this satisfies it if the
[2:24:28] Holy Spirit is there you sell well I
[2:24:29] don't think that means any difference
[2:24:31] look what you've done right there same
[2:24:33] thing Eve done right back in the same
[2:24:35] place now let's go a little farther now
[2:24:37] let's take leave that man in there that
[2:24:40] didn't use the thinking man's filter he
[2:24:42] refused to accept the leadership of
[2:24:45] Jesus Christ to eternal life now let us
[2:24:47] take
[2:24:47] another rich young businessman ruler
[2:24:52] with the same opportunity this man had
[2:24:56] and except he accepted the leadership of
[2:25:02] Christ now there's two of them in the
[2:25:03] Bible that we're going to talk about
[2:25:05] that when we see that refused it now
[2:25:07] let's take this man another rich young
[2:25:11] businessman and a ruler and he accepted
[2:25:16] the leadership the Scriptures tell us
[2:25:18] about this fellow if you want to mark it
[2:25:19] down in Hebrews 11 23 to 29 Moses by
[2:25:25] faith refused to be called the son of
[2:25:28] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[2:25:31] suffer the afflictions of God esteeming
[2:25:33] the reproach of Christ greater treasures
[2:25:39] and all the treasures of Egypt he
[2:25:42] accepted eternal life Moses the Steve
[2:25:45] the the the reports of Christ greater
[2:25:48] treasures than all the treasures the
[2:25:51] world had Moses esteem that the greatest
[2:25:53] now this rich man didn't and Moses was a
[2:25:57] rich young ruler to become a pharaoh he
[2:26:02] was Pharaoh son it was heir to the
[2:26:06] throne he looked out to the impossible a
[2:26:09] bunch of mud dobbers a bunch of slaves
[2:26:12] but by faith he saw the promise of God
[2:26:16] through the word his people would
[2:26:18] sojourn in a strange land for 400 years
[2:26:22] but would be brought out by a mighty
[2:26:24] hand and he has seen that all the
[2:26:30] treasures of the Egypt for he forsook
[2:26:34] Egypt not knowing where he was going he
[2:26:37] was led by Christ he forsook and he had
[2:26:42] his foot on the throne and had been been
[2:26:44] the next Pharaoh in Egypt but he has
[2:26:47] seen the reproach of Christ the reproach
[2:26:50] to be called that odd one we call that
[2:26:54] phonetic that take his place with the
[2:26:57] mud dobbers and the fanatics because
[2:26:59] he's seen that the hour
[2:27:01] at the scripture was promised to be
[2:27:03] fulfilled was Darren Oh charts wakeup
[2:27:07] case you see the same thing tonight the
[2:27:11] hour has been promised is honest a steam
[2:27:15] the approach of Jesus Christ greater
[2:27:17] riches and all the fellowship of any
[2:27:20] buttocks father and mother Church
[2:27:22] anything else follow the leadership of
[2:27:24] the spirit let us follow this Christ for
[2:27:28] him if you have this the Moses for a
[2:27:30] little while that I did that let's watch
[2:27:32] his life the first thing what he
[2:27:34] accepted to take the reproach of Christ
[2:27:38] and forsake his education forsake all
[2:27:42] his wisdom he was taught in all the
[2:27:44] wisdom of the Egyptians and all of his
[2:27:46] popularity his throne his Sepulchre his
[2:27:49] kingship his crown everything he had he
[2:27:53] rejected and this other fella wanted it
[2:27:57] and refused Christ in this man refused
[2:27:59] that and accepted Christ and quickly
[2:28:03] what happened he had to separate himself
[2:28:06] hallelujah the word means praise our God
[2:28:12] it's too bad it we're forgetting it he
[2:28:16] rejected the Thrones and the popularity
[2:28:19] he could have had young girls for the
[2:28:23] wives by the hundreds and he could had
[2:28:25] separate curse under each it through the
[2:28:28] world the world laid right at his feet
[2:28:30] and he was aired every bit of it but
[2:28:33] looking in the scripture seeing the day
[2:28:35] he was living in and note that's
[2:28:37] something any the predestinated seat of
[2:28:42] God went to where I don't care how
[2:28:44] popper you could be or how this you
[2:28:46] could be you're gonna be a press were
[2:28:47] you could be a pastor you could be a dis
[2:28:49] than the other but at that word of
[2:28:51] eternal life but God's Word has been for
[2:28:54] our deigned into you and you see the
[2:28:56] thing at hand it goes to her movie huh
[2:28:59] start coming out then together and he
[2:29:03] refused to be called the son of
[2:29:05] Pharaoh's daughter because he esteemed
[2:29:07] the reproach of Christ greater treasures
[2:29:11] and all the riches of Egypt or the world
[2:29:14] steena watch what he done he father
[2:29:17] quickly he was ousted from his people
[2:29:20] the people that once loved him if I cost
[2:29:24] you everything you got he might cost you
[2:29:25] your home if I cost you your friendship
[2:29:28] it might cost you your sticks and so
[2:29:29] party it might cost you your place at
[2:29:32] the Kiwanis it might I don't know what
[2:29:34] it'll cost you but it'll cost everything
[2:29:36] that's where you're pertains to the oil
[2:29:39] you'll have to separate yourself you'll
[2:29:46] have to do it Moses laid everything
[2:29:49] aside and went into the desert with a
[2:29:52] stick in his he came days after days
[2:29:57] passed and what if he thought he made a
[2:29:58] mistake
[2:29:59] No many times people start out to say oh
[2:30:02] I'll do it door to god I said let
[2:30:04] somebody laugh at you make fun of me
[2:30:05] probably I was wrong
[2:30:07] he said they they cannot stand chaste
[2:30:10] Talmud or bastard children and not the
[2:30:12] children of God see there worked up any
[2:30:14] emotion see these seed that I've talked
[2:30:18] about a while ago
[2:30:18] that's so let us start with it was an
[2:30:21] owner with the spirit and he done all
[2:30:23] kinds of all you they and when your
[2:30:25] spirits anointed you can it's a real
[2:30:26] genuine Holy Ghost and you can still be
[2:30:28] a devil or you say brother been false
[2:30:31] prophets the Bible said the last days to
[2:30:34] be false prophets jesus said there shall
[2:30:37] arise false Christ's now Fox Jesus is
[2:30:40] now nobody stands still for that but
[2:30:42] false Christ Christ means The Anointed
[2:30:43] One
[2:30:44] Vamsi ignored they are anointed but they
[2:30:47] are false at the bottom of it do great
[2:30:51] signs and wonders speak in tongues
[2:30:55] thanks to the spirit preach the gospel
[2:30:58] judas iscariot
[2:31:01] simeon her no our bigger campuses
[2:31:04] prophesied Balaam the hypocrite
[2:31:08] sure done all the signs
[2:31:11] everything all the religious moves but
[2:31:14] you see you put a cover seat and a weak
[2:31:18] seat in the same bed and pour the water
[2:31:20] down upon them and honor them
[2:31:21] they are both rejoice they'll both grow
[2:31:24] by the same water there's sunshine so
[2:31:27] they're just
[2:31:27] they are just the rain falls on the
[2:31:29] Justin yawns oh but father fruits you
[2:31:31] shall know them how can you keep from
[2:31:33] lining up with the word you wanna meet
[2:31:41] the water falls under Justin young
[2:31:44] listen our jesus said they will come to
[2:31:45] me in that day said Lord Lord and not I
[2:31:47] cast out Devils have not done prophesied
[2:31:50] have not I've done great things in your
[2:31:52] name you stay you workers of iniquity
[2:31:55] depart from me I don't even know you go
[2:31:58] into eternal hell it's been prepared for
[2:32:00] the devil his angels see what a word
[2:32:03] falsely worship in vain striving envy
[2:32:07] what do you do that when you don't have
[2:32:09] to do it while take a substitute when
[2:32:13] the heavens is full of genuine you don't
[2:32:16] have to do that now we find Moses
[2:32:19] anointed nothing could turn you back his
[2:32:22] own brothers turning down that doesn't
[2:32:24] stop him one day out there he met God
[2:32:30] face to face with a pillar of fire
[2:32:31] hanging in a bush let Moses take off
[2:32:34] your shoes your ground you're standing
[2:32:36] on his holy for across my people and
[2:32:41] I've heard of their groins and I
[2:32:43] remember my promise of a word I'm coming
[2:32:46] down and would have sent you down there
[2:32:47] to take a mental certainly he met God
[2:32:51] face to face he talked with him he's
[2:32:53] commissioned by God God come right back
[2:32:55] that same pillar far and vindicated that
[2:32:57] prophet standing right there on the
[2:32:58] mountain proved that it was when he took
[2:33:01] his hands and performed all kinds of
[2:33:03] miracles and things oh they had the
[2:33:04] impersonators well sure there were
[2:33:06] chambers to chamber stood I've done the
[2:33:08] same thing they did but who was the
[2:33:10] original 40 to start from it had come
[2:33:13] from the ward was of the hour and you
[2:33:15] know that stained things promised to get
[2:33:16] in the last days as jammers and Janis
[2:33:19] wish to Moses solo these men of
[2:33:21] reprobate mind concerning the truth and

[2:38:04] treasures when the pyramids are dust is
[2:38:10] no more Egypt Moses will be a model

[2:42:28] then other sister as we see just with
[2:42:31] what's going on today now with your
[2:42:32] hands down just stay for a minute
[2:42:35] look let's take a place did you read the
[2:42:38] newspaper last week what that man in
[2:42:39] England said that crucifixion of Jesus
[2:42:43] Christ was only a fake it was only fixed
[2:42:46] up between pilots and him did you see
[2:42:48] what this American see Logan said he
[2:42:51] said that Jesus well just cut to sleep
[2:42:56] or Mandrake we do many of the lodges
[2:42:59] vote back here in Genesis were talked to
[2:43:00] the Mandrake we it'll put you to sleep
[2:43:02] like you're dead your heart hardly beats
[2:43:04] for two three days at a time and when
[2:43:06] they give him the dinner to regard they
[2:43:08] said that was Mandrake weed and they put
[2:43:10] him up there in a tomb any slip up there
[2:43:12] for three days of course 21 that does he
[2:43:13] found him walking right now could you
[2:43:16] imagine that theologians seminary make
[2:43:23] believe then how in the world first
[2:43:25] place the Bible said he refused it when
[2:43:28] they put the vinegar and gall in his
[2:43:29] mouth and another thing if that be so
[2:43:32] then why did those disciples who come
[2:43:34] and stole him wait why did they give
[2:43:36] their life and more than employee and
[2:43:38] falcão their stuff not even worthy to
[2:43:40] die like he died turn him upside down
[2:43:42] and sideways on the crosses and think
[2:43:44] and if they were no but he was a
[2:43:46] hypocrite and then one cells being
[2:43:48] hypocrites
[2:43:49] how would they give their life for him
[2:43:51] like that
[2:43:52] oh it's this intellectual day that we're
[2:43:55] living in education civilization and the
[2:44:00] modern trend of the day is all of the
[2:44:03] devil civilization of the devil yes sir
[2:44:06] the Bible said it is this civilization
[2:44:10] has dead when we have a civilization
[2:44:12] like this the other world no sir would
[2:44:14] have a different kind of civilization
[2:44:16] education all these things there are the
[2:44:19] devil science
[2:44:20] perverting the natural things making
[2:44:23] something else look what they've done to
[2:44:25] you now when young ladies and the
[2:44:27] Reader's Digest said week after month
[2:44:29] before last I believe us The Reader's
[2:44:31] Digest said that young men and young
[2:44:33] women go through the middle-aged women
[2:44:34] in menopause between 20 and 25 years old
[2:44:37] one more generation that being ugly but
[2:44:40] [Music]

[2:44:44] creatures are being softened monkey look
[2:44:48] at the Sun look at the spirit look how
[2:44:51] the spirit of the church has gone hybrid
[2:44:54] intermarried it to the world
[2:44:57] Oh our fleas children flee flee to the
[2:45:02] cross come to Christ let him lead you
[2:45:04] while we have our heads bowed our eyes
[2:45:06] closed and please bow your heart the
[2:45:08] same time when you order ask your
[2:45:11] question do you really look at yourself
[2:45:15] to God and do you feel that you're not
[2:45:18] were you you ought to be at this hour
[2:45:20] because the rapture could come at any
[2:45:22] time
[2:45:23] see it'll come there'd only be if if
[2:45:26] that statement I made a while ago is
[2:45:27] true there'll only be about 500 people
[2:45:30] in the rapture that's living you'll be
[2:45:31] changed or taking all Christendom
[2:45:34] together Catholic and all he's over 580
[2:45:36] people see it claims Christianity and
[2:45:39] one out of a million be 500 people
[2:45:42] there's that many people missing every
[2:45:45] day across the world that we can't even
[2:45:46] count for him see it'll come and you
[2:45:49] won't even know what people go on
[2:45:50] preaching and saying see and it'll all
[2:45:52] be passed like Jesus if they said to
[2:45:54] disciple said why don't say the scribes
[2:45:56] say at last must first come he said he's
[2:45:57] already coming you didn't know him but
[2:46:00] they did to him what they said they
[2:46:01] would do you know that you're not right
[2:46:03] with God and you'd like to be remembered
[2:46:05] to God that God would set your heart
[2:46:08] right with God would you just humming
[2:46:10] out and this very still moment raise

[2:46:48] dealing with spirits we got to make sure
[2:46:51] that we're under the right spirit make
[2:46:53] shaundra under the leadership of that of
[2:46:55] that right spirit amen the holy spirit
[2:46:58] by the grace of Almighty God brother
[2:47:01] again I was going to highlight some
[2:47:03] things concerning the rich young ruler
[2:47:05] and the prophet of God I lighted it much
[2:47:07] of it my brother
[2:47:09] I pray grace that we're gonna learn from
[2:47:11] it to make well we say make our calling
[2:47:14] election short make your leadership
[2:47:16] Shore Amen that you're under the
[2:47:19] anointing of the right spirit with the
[2:47:20] right attitude by the grace of God
[2:47:22] please in the name of Jesus don't take
[2:47:25] it for granted don't take it's just so
[2:47:27] it's just another message by William
[2:47:28] Branham and so on no it's one of the
[2:47:31] last messages he preached and a number
[2:47:33] of times he mentioned his own his own
[2:47:35] going they wasn't gonna live much longer
[2:47:38] and he was only but basically he was
[2:47:41] only here for about two two weeks after
[2:47:43] he preached this a man he preached this
[2:47:46] on the 7th and see I got a note here
[2:47:51] considering the date of the accident he
[2:47:55] preached another 7th on the 18th the
[2:47:58] Lord called no you know just think he
[2:48:02] knew he knew and he again like I said
[2:48:05] during the Easter of 1965 he said err I
[2:48:08] see myself I see myself he said my life
[2:48:11] coming to an end he said 56 years old
[2:48:13] yeah he had just celebrated his 56th
[2:48:17] birthday but he saw his life come to an
[2:48:19] end
[2:48:19] a man so brothers sister the grace of
[2:48:23] God to us and it was the Lord laying
[2:48:26] this on his heart concerning leadership
[2:48:28] well brother I tell you it is any
[2:48:30] message we need to do we need to hear at
[2:48:33] the end of a prophetic ministry of
[2:48:34] William Branham was leadership Amen
[2:48:37] because why because it is anything we
[2:48:40] need to be sure
[2:48:41] is the leadership we have in our lives
[2:48:43] today well leadership is not leadership
[2:48:45] leading us into a church leading us into
[2:48:48] a denomination or leading us into this
[2:48:50] doctor or that doctor but brother we
[2:48:52] need the leadership that's going to take
[2:48:53] us into what God is doing in this hour
[2:48:55] and what is it it's the resurrection and
[2:48:58] the rapture brother let's not be under
[2:49:00] the leadership of what the devil is
[2:49:02] doing what is God doing and am I am i
[2:49:05] under that leadership so God is using me
[2:49:07] to do what he wants to do a man he's got
[2:49:11] he's got to elect there somewhere
[2:49:13] predestinated for Dane in whom he is
[2:49:16] going to bring to bring into
[2:49:17] manifestation the resurrection and the
[2:49:20] rapture brother no wonder that that
[2:49:23] Jesus questioned Martha Martha believe
[2:49:26] us though this that he was the
[2:49:29] resurrection and he was about to delay
[2:49:31] of his life laid down but he said but do
[2:49:34] you believe this I am the resurrection
[2:49:36] and then he laid down his life and pick
[2:49:39] it up again amen
[2:49:40] so the grace of God to us brother to
[2:49:43] make our leadership Shore to make sure
[2:49:46] it's the court ended now how do we know
[2:49:48] that well then let the leadership lead
[2:49:50] you according to the word and according
[2:49:52] to what God is doing a man not what he's
[2:49:55] done brother when it comes to William
[2:49:58] Branham when it comes to the doctrine
[2:50:00] the mystery of the seven seals that's
[2:50:01] all history God did it but brother why
[2:50:06] did he do it brother
[2:50:09] listen Ephesians said it is by grace
[2:50:11] through faith we are safe and that not
[2:50:14] of ourselves that the gift of God faith
[2:50:16] is God's leadership God did what he did
[2:50:19] to give us the faith that would lead us
[2:50:22] into the resurrection and the rapture
[2:50:24] amen then the Prophet is highlighted the
[2:50:27] fact that what God has done he said what
[2:50:30] for he says to give us rapturing faith a
[2:50:33] man Luther got caught up with what God
[2:50:36] revealed to him Wesley got caught up
[2:50:38] with God God revealed to him and the
[2:50:40] salvation army as well and and then the
[2:50:43] Pentecostals they got caught up with God
[2:50:45] God was doing in their day the baptism
[2:50:48] of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the
[2:50:49] Spirit they live for it and
[2:50:51] died for it well though well we got on
[2:50:54] the private-eye lighters into this
[2:50:55] message now we've gone on so what it was
[2:50:58] God looking for us now Luther yes Wesley
[2:51:01] yes Pentecost yes plus the right age and
[2:51:05] what's in the right age the resurrection
[2:51:08] and the rapture hey man because as I
[2:51:11] said another message November 65
[2:51:16] invisible Union a man it is is the
[2:51:20] heavenly bridegroom coming down a man
[2:51:22] for his bride he remember he came and
[2:51:25] redeemed his bride a man but now he
[2:51:28] comes to get his bright and there's an
[2:51:30] invisible union of the heavenly
[2:51:32] bridegroom and the earthly bride and
[2:51:34] it's all praise the Lord it's going to
[2:51:37] be climax with the resurrection and the
[2:51:39] rapture to God be the glory
[2:51:42] please we're looking at the world we see
[2:51:45] this happening that happening this
[2:51:47] happening oh yes all brother and even
[2:51:50] just even though our weather it's not
[2:51:51] not normal no more because they're all
[2:51:53] they're all talking about climate change

[2:52:06] something going on up there what is it
[2:52:08] brother
[2:52:10] it's God bringing make it bringing make
[2:52:13] it an end of it he's God what is he
[2:52:16] gonna do he's gonna destroy the this
[2:52:18] evident this earth a man he sees all
[2:52:20] guys gonna have a new heaven and a new
[2:52:21] earth and the prophet of God said well
[2:52:23] basically he said God is going to put
[2:52:25] the the the old leaven and the earth he
[2:52:28] sits through the same thing he put you
[2:52:29] through and that's the new birth he said
[2:52:32] it'd be like a new birth a new heaven
[2:52:34] and a new earth I'm offering four I'm
[2:52:37] longing for it I'm thirsty for it I'm
[2:52:39] I'm sick of this old brother if you got
[2:52:42] God in you you got Christ in you you
[2:52:44] hate it you hate Jesus hated it like I
[2:52:49] said we're gonna had the same attitude
[2:52:50] Jesus said and what did you just say oh
[2:52:53] he said much longer what I'd be with you
[2:52:55] Oh can you imagine would be the
[2:52:58] influence said they had on Jesus for him
[2:53:00] to say that
[2:53:00] how much longer shall I be with you oh
[2:53:03] gee Oh
[2:53:04] faith and so on I found some notes that
[2:53:11] somebody had given me and they were
[2:53:15] trying to preach on or not preach on it
[2:53:18] but trying to show me that when it comes
[2:53:20] to the scripture we should you want to
[2:53:23] that we should practice this in the
[2:53:26] stresses in the scripture and that's the
[2:53:28] lane on Avance
[2:53:30] you know the lands on this one lands on
[2:53:32] that one and so on
[2:53:33] and there's all all kinds of Scripture
[2:53:36] in that they had written down and give
[2:53:40] to me to prove that we should be laying
[2:53:44] ants on one another laying hands on one
[2:53:46] another
[2:53:46] oh and I said well I said amazing but I
[2:53:50] suggest three or four scriptures here
[2:53:52] said they've overlooked I said the the
[2:53:57] faith that pleases Jesus that please
[2:53:59] Jesus wasn't a laying out of hands amen
[2:54:04] brother
[2:54:04] exactly the faith that please Jesus will
[2:54:08] speak the word only yeah it's like the
[2:54:12] like the met the Centurion he said Lord
[2:54:15] I'm not worthy you should come into my
[2:54:17] house but and what was it Oh brothers
[2:54:20] sister and it wasn't it one of his sons
[2:54:22] and wasn't the daughter was this waste
[2:54:25] that was sick it was a servant a servant
[2:54:29] but he had that he had that concern for
[2:54:32] his servant yeah he wanted his servant
[2:54:35] healed and he saw not worthy I'm not
[2:54:38] worried you come under my roof he said
[2:54:39] Lord but he says speak the word only and
[2:54:41] my servant surely shall he be healed and
[2:54:45] live and Jesus was amazed he said I have
[2:54:50] not found no so great faith he said no
[2:54:54] not in Israel oh that's what he was
[2:54:57] looking for and he said praise the Lord
[2:55:00] he said go he said as you have believed
[2:55:03] so you'll find hallelujah and his
[2:55:06] servants came but better as since your
[2:55:08] servant to see you he's healed he said
[2:55:11] what went and it was exactly the same
[2:55:13] time that Jesus spoke the word praise
[2:55:16] the Lord
[2:55:17] rather God we got to get away from the
[2:55:20] physical into the spiritual it's not the
[2:55:23] lane I'll advance naturally it's
