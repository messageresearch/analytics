[15:24] Just welcome everyone here this morning.
[15:27] Some prayer requests. Brother Mark has
[15:30] requested prayer. He's having a
[15:31] procedure done in the morning for a
[15:34] common irregular heart rhythm. He's had
[15:36] it before, but the pacemaker corrected
[15:38] it and but now it's back again. He's on
[15:41] medicine to help it. He's feeling really
[15:42] good. procedure is commonly done.
[15:45] They're going to defi defi defibrillate
[15:48] him to put him back in a normal heart
[15:51] rhythm again. By the grace of God, we
[15:53] covered your prayers for him.
[15:56] Also, uh for those of you that know him,
[15:58] brother Steven Dole in uh in Edmonton,
[16:01] he had a um is it a motorcycle accident?
[16:05] So, he's uh I think he's doing okay, but
[16:07] he's got some um he's got a slightly
[16:10] separated shoulder, concussion, road
[16:12] rash, small fracture of a vertebrae. So,
[16:15] I want to keep him in prayer. He'll make
[16:18] a quick recovery. Uh also, uh brother
[16:21] Abby Guy,
[16:23] um a prayer request for him. He called
[16:25] and and said that the ambulance was
[16:27] picking him up, taking him to the
[16:28] hospital, problem with his stomach, and
[16:31] he can't swallow. And then there was
[16:33] another update that they gave him some
[16:35] uh some graall on the ambulance ride in
[16:38] and he's been up all night. His stomach
[16:40] is like a brick. He's been throwing up.
[16:44] Um super nauseous, drained of energy.
[16:46] They put him on some fluids so he
[16:48] doesn't get dehydrated and something for
[16:49] his throwing up and now he's back asleep
[16:51] again. So
[16:58] Oh, I'm sorry. Not brother Abby guy.
[17:01] Okay, brother happy Guy is doing fine as
[17:03] far as we know.
[17:05] Forgive me for that. Uh my head went to
[17:07] brother Happy Guy. Um this is brother Ay
[17:11] in British Columbia. So I think but that
[17:13] makes more sense to me now. Brother Bob
[17:14] put in the prayer request. So there's
[17:16] too many brother Bobs for us here. So
[17:20] there was that need. Uh, also, um,
[17:22] Brother Dale, um, Sister Lori, I was
[17:25] speaking with my mother-in-law
[17:26] yesterday, and Sister Lori's been home
[17:28] now for a week, and she's, uh, my
[17:31] mother-in-law said she, you'd never know
[17:33] anything happened to her. She she
[17:34] doesn't look hagggered or tired, so she
[17:36] just looks like herself. Uh, she can
[17:37] move her feet and things, uh, but she
[17:39] still can't stand up, so we're just want
[17:40] to keep her in prayer. And also that,
[17:43] uh, they're fighting with the insurance
[17:45] company, which I I sympathize with them
[17:47] there. uh they're trying to get her into
[17:49] a rehab to help her uh learn how to walk
[17:52] again things. So just keep her in prayer
[17:54] and uh just trust him for a full healing
[17:57] for her. Uh the needs brother David
[18:00] mentioned and sister Cordella, Brother
[18:01] Nelson Guy Jr. Um let's sing that song
[18:07] uh 637 open our eyes Lord and ask
[18:10] brother brother Bob Hansen if you can uh
[18:12] open in prayer brother and we'll sing
[18:13] this a few times.

[44:01] the temptor's
[44:03] power is broken.

[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, how thankful we are
[46:49] this morning, Lord, that we've got a
[46:51] gospel testimony, Lord. A reality of a
[46:54] life that's been changed, Lord. Not by
[46:56] anything we've done, Lord, but by your

[47:06] thankful we're gathered under a promise
[47:07] that if we come in your name, you'd be
[47:09] in the midst of us, heavenly father. So,
[47:11] Lord, we're praying you'll take this
[47:12] message this morning, Lord, that you'll
[47:14] just open up eyes that have been
[47:15] darkened, Lord. that you'll open up our
[47:17] lives, Lord, that you'll help us to see,
[47:19] Lord, places we need correction, Lord,
[47:21] where we need to come up to a higher
[47:23] plane, a higher level. Lord, grant us
[47:25] grace this morning. We pray in Jesus
[47:27] Christ's name, we're asking it. Amen.
[47:30] Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would
[47:31] to the book of John, chapter 8. Book of
[47:34] John, chapter 8. Amen. Good to be here
[47:36] this morning. Good to see each one.
[47:38] Church is slowly starting to fill up.
[47:40] Just bit by bit. Seems like every month
[47:42] or two we get another person here,
[47:44] another person there, a family here, one
[47:46] there. So, we're thankful to see that.
[47:48] Amen. We trust the Lord would fill the
[47:50] whole thing if it would be his will.
[47:52] Amen. But we're not here for membership.
[47:54] We're not here for membership. We're
[47:55] here for souls. Amen. So, I'm so
[47:57] thankful for that. Just a few
[47:59] announcements this morning. Just want to
[48:00] reinforce what brother Paul sent out by
[48:02] email. And that is to let him know if
[48:05] you are going to camp and if you are not
[48:08] going to camp and if there are days
[48:10] where you won't be in camp and if there
[48:12] are meals where you won't be there or
[48:13] where people in your family won't be
[48:15] there. They need a very accurate
[48:17] headcount because we have way more
[48:19] people wanting to come than we really
[48:20] have room for. So we need every possible
[48:23] bed, every bit of food. We need to be
[48:25] able to plan for those things. So,
[48:26] please let them know by next Friday,
[48:28] July 18th, if you're going, how many are
[48:31] going, what days they're going to be
[48:33] there. Please confirm with them ASAP, so
[48:35] that they can move on and let those that
[48:37] are on the waiting list that want to
[48:38] come come if there are if there are
[48:40] going to be rooms or beds available.
[48:42] Amen. We also want to uh say goodbye to
[48:46] Brother Bob and Sister Joe. I know
[48:47] they're not gone yet, but they fly out
[48:48] tomorrow. So, we pray God's grace to
[48:50] them as they travel back home. Please
[48:51] bring our greetings to the church and
[48:53] the saints back there, your pastor.
[48:55] Amen. and uh we'll see you in a couple
[48:56] months, Lord willing. So, we're happy
[48:58] for that. Amen. Appreciate the special
[49:00] this morning. Always appreciate it when
[49:02] somebody has a a song on their heart.
[49:04] Amen. Amen. We're actually going to read
[49:07] uh we're not going to start at verse 32.
[49:09] We're going to start at verse 31 and
[49:10] read to 33. Just changed it a bit in the
[49:13] in the office back there. So, John 8 and
[49:15] verse 31 says this. It says, "And as
[49:18] sorry, let's say verse 30. And as he
[49:20] spake these words, many believed on
[49:22] him." This is Christ now. It says, "Then
[49:24] said Jesus to those Jews which believed
[49:26] on him, if you continue in my word, then
[49:29] are ye my disciples indeed." Now notice
[49:31] there's an initial hearing. But then he
[49:34] says, "You got to keep going." You can't
[49:36] stop with what you've heard. You got to
[49:38] keep going with the word. It says, "And
[49:40] ye shall know the truth, and the truth
[49:42] shall make you free." Now watch the
[49:44] response here. Because they said unto
[49:46] him, they answered him, "We be Abraham's
[49:48] seed. We're Abraham's children." He
[49:51] said, "And were never in bondage to any
[49:54] man, how sayest thou, ye shall be made
[49:58] free." What did they do? They went right
[49:59] back to their heritage. They went right
[50:01] back to their religion. Said, "Hey, we
[50:03] are children of the promise. We are not
[50:04] in bondage." How can you say you're
[50:07] going to set us free if we are in the
[50:08] truth? But he says the truth will set
[50:11] you free. Amen. You can have your seats
[50:14] this morning. This is where we're going
[50:15] to preach this morning. And we're we're
[50:17] we've been preaching on headship. And
[50:19] this is still certainly along those
[50:21] lines this morning, but I want to take
[50:23] just a different direction for a couple
[50:24] of services here and may maybe be a
[50:26] strange topic this morning called an
[50:29] echo chamber gospel. An echo chamber
[50:32] gospel. Amen. And then we're going to
[50:34] come back to our thought on absolute
[50:35] power after this, but it ties in and
[50:37] it's just a little segue from this to to
[50:39] to clarify some things that I've been
[50:41] preaching and to give us a little more
[50:43] insight in it. Amen. And the first thing
[50:45] we want to know is what is an echo
[50:46] chamber? because this is not something
[50:48] that's very common these days in terms
[50:50] of the physical element. Amen. But a an
[50:53] echo chamber is a room or a space
[50:55] designed or having features that cause
[50:57] sound to be amplified and repeated. A
[51:01] room designed to create an echo effect.
[51:03] So they have these around the world and
[51:05] this is actually a studio that's
[51:07] designed as an echo chamber. And so it
[51:09] has very solid surfaces but within that
[51:11] it has reflective surfaces that cause
[51:13] the sound to go back and forth as you're
[51:15] speaking in there. And then you have
[51:17] buildings that have this effect. And
[51:19] this is a a a cathedral in Scotland
[51:21] actually. And this is an unfortunate
[51:23] effect because when the preacher's
[51:25] preaching in there, his voice echoes the
[51:27] whole way. You remember how this
[51:28] building was when we first got it? It
[51:30] was an echo chamber. I trust by God's
[51:32] grace it's not an echo chamber this
[51:34] morning. But there's a there's a it's a
[51:37] place where what you say is repeated
[51:40] back to you over and over and over
[51:43] again. That's what an echo chamber is.
[51:44] You control the message in an echo
[51:46] chamber. It won't speak anything else
[51:48] but what you speak. Okay? Now, this has
[51:51] become more of a modern phrase today
[51:53] because they're designing buildings now
[51:54] not to echo. They're designing them to
[51:56] kill sound and then they pipe it back in
[51:58] traditionally with with audiovisisual
[52:00] equipment. But now we have the modern
[52:02] phrase of an echo chamber or an echo
[52:04] room. And it's a place where individuals
[52:07] are primarily exposed to information and
[52:10] opinions that confirm their existing
[52:13] beliefs. Okay. So this can be social
[52:15] media. It can be a group of friends. It
[52:17] can be a church. It can be a school or
[52:19] university. But the point is that you're
[52:21] going to a place to hear what you have
[52:24] already determined to be right. Your
[52:27] beliefs have already been established.
[52:28] And so you're looking for a group of
[52:30] people. You're looking for a place.
[52:32] You're looking for a hall of wisdom that
[52:34] that that affirms or confirms what you
[52:37] already believe. In other words, an echo
[52:40] chamber or an echo room is not a place
[52:42] for somebody seeking truth. It is a
[52:45] place for somebody seeking affirmation
[52:47] of where they are and what they believe.
[52:49] Amen. So, what it is is when you are
[52:52] looking for an echo chamber, you're
[52:54] looking for people to repeat back to you
[52:57] what you have already decided is right.
[53:00] Let me repeat that again. You speak and
[53:03] people repeat back to you what you speak
[53:05] and you believe their words because they
[53:08] are your words. Okay? And the abundance
[53:11] of people saying the same thing makes
[53:13] you believe that you're right. You're in
[53:15] a place where everyone believes the same
[53:16] thing. So you say, "Well, it must be
[53:18] right because everybody believes it
[53:19] here." That's what an echo chamber is.
[53:21] Amen. Sheer numbers convince you. Amen.
[53:23] And people are seeking today those that
[53:25] are shouting loudest. Those that have
[53:27] the most voices, those that have the
[53:28] greatest numbers behind them and saying,
[53:30] "Aha, that must be right. That must be
[53:33] true." Because that is what most people
[53:35] believe.
[53:36] That's the very definition of an echo
[53:38] chamber. It is not the definition of
[53:40] truth. Amen. Truth. The thing is this.
[53:44] Let me let me put it this way. If you
[53:46] think the way that everyone else thinks,
[53:49] you're wrong.
[53:51] That's that's the truth this morning.
[53:53] Okay, we're we're now preaching. We're
[53:55] take we're saying if you believe the way
[53:57] that everyone else believes, you're
[53:59] wrong by the word. You are wrong. And
[54:02] we'll prove it to you by the word this
[54:03] morning. Amen. If you're sitting in a
[54:05] church this morning and it preaches the
[54:07] same gospel that every other church out
[54:09] there preaches, you're in the wrong
[54:10] place. It is not the gospel of Jesus
[54:13] Christ. Amen. The truth is not common.
[54:16] It is rarely preached and it is not
[54:18] found in the common meeting ground of
[54:20] society and religion. That is not where
[54:22] you're going to find truth. Amen. The
[54:24] truth will make you uncomfortable, but
[54:26] Jesus said you'll hear the truth and the
[54:28] truth will set you free. Amen. The truth
[54:31] is, it stands alone. Is an absolute. It
[54:34] just is. It's not seeking people to
[54:36] affirm it or confirm it. The truth is
[54:39] just there. And it doesn't matter if one
[54:41] believes it, if none believe it, or if
[54:43] everyone believes it. It is not changed
[54:45] based on numbers. Amen. And you can't be
[54:48] set free this morning if you are
[54:50] convinced you are in liberty. And when
[54:52] Jesus was preaching to those Jews, they
[54:54] said,"We're not bound." And he was
[54:56] saying, "You've got to be set free. And
[54:57] if you'll hear my words and continue in
[54:59] it, it'll set you free." And they said,
[55:00] "But we're not bound." That's the worst
[55:02] place you can be is say this morning, "I
[55:04] have no bondage." If you haven't
[55:06] received the word, if you've received
[55:08] the word, praise the Lord, you're no
[55:09] longer in bondage. But I say we're still
[55:11] in bondage until we get out of here
[55:13] because we're in this body of death that
[55:14] holds us back. Amen. So, we don't go to
[55:17] the halls of education or religion to
[55:19] find truth this morning. We don't look
[55:21] for the biggest churches. We don't look
[55:24] for the greatest ministries. We don't
[55:26] look for the best speakers. Amen. The
[55:28] truth is out there somewhere, but it is
[55:30] not with the majority. It's never with
[55:32] the majority. Amen. It doesn't shout. It
[55:34] doesn't rant. It doesn't herang. It
[55:36] doesn't attract a lot of money. The
[55:39] truth just is. And it is it is the word
[55:41] of God as we believe it this morning.
[55:42] Amen. But look at what Jesus said. He
[55:45] said in Matthew 7, "Enter ye in at the
[55:48] straight gate." That word straight means
[55:50] small and narrow. He says, "For wide is
[55:53] the gate and broad is the way that
[55:56] leadth to destruction and many there be
[56:00] which go in there." So the majority, we
[56:03] could say everyone more or less is the
[56:06] has has decided that the road to
[56:09] destruction is the correct road.
[56:12] So if you're looking for the the the the
[56:15] commonality or the consensus of what
[56:17] everyone thinks is right, when you find
[56:20] it, go opposite.
[56:23] Go opposite because theirs is the way to
[56:25] destruction. Many there be that which go
[56:29] therein. Amen. Now he says, because
[56:32] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[56:34] way which leads to life, and few there
[56:37] be that find it. So that tells you that
[56:39] the road to life, the road of truth, the
[56:42] road of the complete gospel of Jesus
[56:44] Christ is with the minority. Few there
[56:48] be that find it. Amen. Look at Christ's
[56:51] ministry. Okay, this is a man that went
[56:53] to a people that by their own profession
[56:56] and by their own religion were looking
[56:58] for him and waiting for him with baited
[57:00] breath. Their every prayer was send the
[57:03] Messiah. And when the Messiah came, 120
[57:07] people out of millions accepted him.
[57:10] 120 out of the millions. And this was
[57:12] going to a a a group of people that were
[57:15] preaching him, that were seeking him and
[57:19] only 120 accepted him while he was
[57:21] there. What's it going to be like today
[57:24] when nobody's seeking him?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; When they're not preaching this, when
[57:27] they're not raised around it, how many
[57:29] are going to find it? It's going to be
[57:31] in the minority. Watch what he says now.
[57:34] He says, "Beware of false prophets,
[57:36] prophets, but false ones." Amen. Satan
[57:39] is cloaked in religion.
[57:41] He says, "Which come to you in sheep's
[57:43] clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
[57:46] wolves." So outwardly they look like
[57:48] Christians. They act like Christians.
[57:49] They talk like Christians. But inwardly,
[57:51] he says, they're ravening wolves. That
[57:53] word ravening means swindlers.
[57:56] In other words, they're in it for
[57:57] themselves.
[57:59] He says, "You shall know them by their
[58:02] fruits. Do man gather grapes of thorns
[58:04] or figs of thistles? Even so, every good
[58:07] tree bringeth forth good fruit. Period.
[58:12] Every good tree can only produce good
[58:15] fruit. Period. You got to give it time.
[58:18] It'll produce it. He says, "But a
[58:21] corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit."
[58:23] Period. I was listening to Brother Bram
[58:25] this morning. He said, "You can't start
[58:27] out wrong and become good." You can't
[58:29] start wrong and become right. You've got
[58:31] to start right to become right. You
[58:34] can't finish right if you've started
[58:35] wrong. He says, "Even so, every good
[58:38] tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a
[58:40] corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit."
[58:42] He says, "A good tree cannot."
[58:45] That is an absolute church. A good tree
[58:47] cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither
[58:50] can a corrupt tree bring forth good
[58:52] fruit. Every tree that bringeth not
[58:54] forth good fruit is heuned down and cast
[58:56] into the fire. Judgment is the only
[58:58] thing that awaits a tree that doesn't
[58:59] produce fruit or produces bad fruit.
[59:02] Okay? He says, "Wherefore by their
[59:04] fruits ye shall know them. Not
[59:06] everyone," now catch this, "not everyone
[59:09] that saith unto me, Lord, Lord," shall
[59:11] enter into the kingdom of heaven. But he
[59:13] that does one thing, he that doeth the
[59:17] will of my father which is in heaven.
[59:19] See, it's not in doing great works, it's
[59:21] in doing his will. Amen. Man's things
[59:25] are the great ways. God works in
[59:28] simplicity, but it has eternal and
[59:31] lasting results. Remember, they would
[59:33] talk about Billy Graham. Billy Graham
[59:34] would say, "I'll go into a city. I'll
[59:36] hold a great revival. I'll get 30,000
[59:39] converts and come back a year later, and
[59:40] I can't find 30."
[59:43] Now, was Billy Graham a true messenger
[59:45] of God? Absolutely. He was one of the
[59:48] two to Sodom. Remember, it was him and
[59:50] Oral Roberts. One to the Pentecostals
[59:52] and one to everybody else. Two angel
[59:54] messengers to them. He had a true gospel
[59:57] of repentance and salvation, but what?
[1:00:00] It never took the people all the way.
[1:00:03] It was a social gospel in the end. And
[1:00:05] it never turned their hearts back to the
[1:00:07] true word. They had a moment. They had
[1:00:09] an event. They had an experience, but it
[1:00:11] wasn't a lasting thing.
[1:00:14] What is it? It's not about the big show.
[1:00:18] It's about what will last. It's always
[1:00:21] about what will last. What will hold
[1:00:23] true. Amen.
[1:00:25] He says
[1:00:27] many, in other words, the majority of
[1:00:30] religious people will say to me in that
[1:00:33] day, what day? It's the day of judgment.
[1:00:34] Okay, this is the white throne. The
[1:00:36] majority of religious people will stand
[1:00:39] before the white throne judgment and
[1:00:41] plead their case with these exact words.
[1:00:44] Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[1:00:47] thy name? And in thy name cast out
[1:00:49] devils, and in thy name done many
[1:00:52] wonderful works. Now notice the phrase
[1:00:54] there, Lord. Lord, see everyone wants
[1:00:57] Savior, but how many want Lord? Because
[1:01:00] Lord means he's in control. He has the
[1:01:03] authority in your life. He says, "And
[1:01:05] then I will profess unto them, I never
[1:01:09] knew you. Depart from me, ye that work
[1:01:12] iniquity." Amen. So what is iniquity?
[1:01:14] It's to know what to do and refuse to do
[1:01:16] it. It is self-will rather than
[1:01:19] surrender. Okay? So he says, "You call
[1:01:22] me Lord, but you didn't treat me like
[1:01:25] Lord. I told you what to do and you
[1:01:27] refused to do it and you went and did
[1:01:29] something your own way. You got your own
[1:01:31] results and here you stand today." He
[1:01:33] never denies what they did. He says, "It
[1:01:36] was not according to my will." That's
[1:01:38] the crux of the matter. Now, I read this
[1:01:40] quote last service, but I want to read
[1:01:41] it again just as we get fired up this
[1:01:44] morning. He says, "The Holy Ghost is the
[1:01:46] action in you. It's a life, not an
[1:01:50] emotion, not some sort of fleshly
[1:01:52] evidence, but it is a person, Jesus
[1:01:54] Christ, the word of God, established in
[1:01:57] your heart, to quicken every word of
[1:02:00] this age. He says, watch the Holy Ghost
[1:02:02] in action, not so much in demonstration.
[1:02:06] See, it's not about the show. He says,
[1:02:09] but in action, what it does according to
[1:02:12] the word. And I spoke of this last
[1:02:14] service where I said, my life is here to
[1:02:16] prove the word. The word is not here to
[1:02:18] prove my life. Amen. It cannot be about
[1:02:21] me. It has to be about the word. When I
[1:02:24] go and I pray for somebody, it is not
[1:02:26] about proving that I'm a preacher or a
[1:02:28] mass a a minister of the gospel, but it
[1:02:30] is about proving the word works. That's
[1:02:33] what has to be. Our every thought is the
[1:02:35] word has the preeminence, not me. And
[1:02:38] too often demonstrations come back to me
[1:02:41] instead of the word. And it draws people
[1:02:42] to me rather than the word, to the
[1:02:45] ministry I'm speaking, of course. So
[1:02:47] when we look at this, this is the life
[1:02:49] of a person that is in God's will, not
[1:02:52] somebody that's inviting God into their
[1:02:54] will. And you see the difference there.
[1:02:56] Amen. Some of the most wholesome people
[1:02:58] out there, sincere, we would say
[1:03:00] God-fearing, good. Amen. They're going
[1:03:03] to bypass the rapture of the bride of
[1:03:05] Jesus Christ because they turn down the
[1:03:07] will of God.
[1:03:10] That's what he's showing there. That's
[1:03:11] what we read in that in that scripture
[1:03:13] is that they didn't do what he asked.
[1:03:16] It's not that they didn't do good
[1:03:18] things, but they didn't do what he
[1:03:21] asked. They meant what is it? It is
[1:03:22] people that are setting up their own
[1:03:24] lives and their own ways. And we would
[1:03:26] say it's good. It's clean. It's moral. I
[1:03:29] It's proper living. Listen, foolish
[1:03:32] virgins are still virgins.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The life that they live is in many
[1:03:37] ways wonderful, but their life and their
[1:03:39] lifestyle is of their own choosing
[1:03:42] rather than the will of God for their
[1:03:44] life. Amen. And so they're inviting God
[1:03:47] into their own decisions rather than
[1:03:50] surrendering themselves to the full word
[1:03:52] of God so that he could lead them by his
[1:03:54] spirit. Amen. I've I've met people and
[1:03:57] this this is not a a madeup group of
[1:04:00] people, okay? I have a a particular
[1:04:02] family in mind that moved into the
[1:04:04] middle of nowhere up in the Yukon if I
[1:04:06] remember correctly. And they their their
[1:04:08] profession was well, I'm going up there
[1:04:10] because it's away from the things of the
[1:04:12] world. that's away from the hustle and
[1:04:13] the bustle and it's clean and I'm in
[1:04:15] nature and God's there and there's less
[1:04:17] spirits out there and all these
[1:04:19] different things. And so they went and
[1:04:21] they had this beautiful cabin on a lake
[1:04:22] out in the middle of nowhere and it was
[1:04:24] just them and their family. That's it.
[1:04:28] And what happened
[1:04:31] in that place? They became a law unto
[1:04:33] themselves
[1:04:35] and they didn't attend church which
[1:04:37] meant they took themselves out from
[1:04:39] under the correction of the word and so
[1:04:41] they became righteous in their own eyes
[1:04:43] and they were critical of all other
[1:04:44] believers.
[1:04:47] Openly critical of all other believers.
[1:04:51] Amen. They didn't have local believers
[1:04:53] they could support and serve and help.
[1:04:57] And so what did they become? Selfish.
[1:05:00] And it was all about themselves. Amen.
[1:05:02] They were so focused on living in a good
[1:05:04] place that they forgot that there's only
[1:05:06] one good place and that is smack dab in
[1:05:08] the will of God. That's the only place
[1:05:10] you can be. Paul said, "I've learned to
[1:05:12] be content in whatever state I am." I
[1:05:14] mean, that's our confession this
[1:05:15] morning. That is if I am in the will of
[1:05:17] God, there's a peace, there's a rest,
[1:05:18] there's a contentment there for me if I
[1:05:20] have found his will. No matter how
[1:05:22] uncomfortable or comfortable it is,
[1:05:25] there's a rest of knowing that you're
[1:05:26] where he wants you to do. Amen. And so
[1:05:29] the God's will is always his word and
[1:05:32] the Holy Spirit is there to try and
[1:05:33] quicken that word to us. But when we get
[1:05:35] into an echo chamber, we start to make
[1:05:38] decisions. We start to say things and we
[1:05:40] seek out like-minded individuals to
[1:05:42] confirm that to us, we get into
[1:05:44] problems. Okay? And so these people, we
[1:05:48] call them good people, well-meaning
[1:05:49] people, they walked away from the word
[1:05:52] of God because they got an their their
[1:05:54] head wrapped around a particular facet
[1:05:56] or idea. And what is it, church? They've
[1:05:58] got a book that borrows from the Bible
[1:06:00] rather than is the Bible. They'll never
[1:06:03] say it that way, but that's the way it
[1:06:04] is, church. We're Bible based rather
[1:06:07] than Bible.
[1:06:09] That's where we can end up. Amen. What
[1:06:11] would have saved this family? Perhaps
[1:06:14] if somebody came up to them and said,
[1:06:16] "Brother, that's not going to work out
[1:06:18] well. You're going to forsake the
[1:06:20] assembling of yourselves together.
[1:06:22] You're going to be outside of a local
[1:06:24] body.
[1:06:26] you're going to be outside the word of
[1:06:27] correction. And people told them,
[1:06:30] but he had his mind made up. The father
[1:06:32] had his mind made up. They're caught up
[1:06:34] in their thinking. And they were focused
[1:06:36] on what made that life enjoyable rather
[1:06:38] than what made it according to the word
[1:06:40] of God. And what happened?
[1:06:43] What caused them to come to that place?
[1:06:45] I won't share the final outcome because
[1:06:47] it would it would identify them over the
[1:06:49] pulpit. And I'm not preaching against
[1:06:51] them. By God's grace, what happened was
[1:06:54] tragic.
[1:06:55] But the family recovered and got
[1:06:57] themselves out of that. But there was
[1:07:00] tragedy there.
[1:07:02] It was absolutely horrible. But what was
[1:07:05] the tipping point? What is the tipping
[1:07:07] point to be coming to a place where you
[1:07:09] have an echo chamber gospel? You walk
[1:07:11] away from the word of God. And it only
[1:07:14] takes one word, church. It only takes
[1:07:16] one church. Amen. Now, it's rarely
[1:07:18] obvious Satan will use hurts. He'll use
[1:07:21] offenses. He'll use emotions. He'll use
[1:07:23] worries. or he'll offer you the positive
[1:07:25] side. He'll give you the promise of
[1:07:26] liberty and freedom and clean living and
[1:07:28] separation from things that bothers you.
[1:07:30] And the thing is this, Satan knows how
[1:07:32] to tempt you. See, what tempts me is not
[1:07:35] maybe what tempts you, but Satan knows
[1:07:37] how to tempt you. Then his only
[1:07:39] temptation is to get us away from the
[1:07:40] word of God. And he'll do it through
[1:07:43] whatever appeal that we have in our
[1:07:45] flesh or our mind. That works really
[1:07:46] well. When we look back in the in into
[1:07:49] the the word of God and into these
[1:07:51] gentile church ages, Amen. There's seven
[1:07:53] church ages and we see in the very first
[1:07:55] church age they got into a problem and
[1:07:59] we see that their problem was that they
[1:08:01] stepped away. They fell away from
[1:08:03] something that they had. But watch what
[1:08:05] what was the tipping point here?
[1:08:08] He says unto the angel of the church of
[1:08:10] Ephesus, right? Unto who
[1:08:14] does it say unto the church?
[1:08:17] It says unto the angel. One man, one
[1:08:22] messenger, one message. That's it. Okay.
[1:08:27] Notice it's one man, one messenger for
[1:08:29] each age. Paul's the first one. And it's
[1:08:32] the same message for every single church
[1:08:35] age. As in it's preaching from the same
[1:08:37] gospel, but because the condition of the
[1:08:39] church changes through all of those
[1:08:41] seven church ages, there's a particular
[1:08:43] focus on a portion of the word for that
[1:08:45] age because that's the portion that's
[1:08:47] going to get them to overcoming. So
[1:08:49] they're all preaching from the same
[1:08:51] message. Amen. We are not preaching what
[1:08:53] we call the message this morning is not
[1:08:55] a new gospel. It is the message of Paul.
[1:08:58] It has to be. If it's not, we're in
[1:09:01] apostasy.
[1:09:03] Which is why we preach from the word of
[1:09:04] God. Amen. But what is it? Paul pointed
[1:09:08] us to Christ, the word. And every
[1:09:11] messenger after that pointed us back to
[1:09:14] Christ. Amen. Paul kept Paul set up the
[1:09:17] original church. Amen. He set the
[1:09:19] pattern for the New Testament church. So
[1:09:20] under the angel of the church of
[1:09:22] Ephesus, write these things saith he
[1:09:24] that holdeth the seven stars in his
[1:09:26] right hand, which walketh in the midst
[1:09:27] of the seven golden candlesticks. That's
[1:09:29] Revelation 1. It's Christ. Here's here's
[1:09:32] Christ's report card for the first
[1:09:33] church age. I know thy works and thy
[1:09:36] labor and thy patience, and how thou
[1:09:38] canst not bear them which are evil. and
[1:09:40] thou hast tried them which say they are
[1:09:42] apostles and are not and has found them
[1:09:44] liars and has borne and has patience and
[1:09:46] for my name's sake has labored and has
[1:09:48] not fainted. This is a wonderful
[1:09:50] testimony.
[1:09:52] We would say that's an a that's an A+
[1:09:54] perhaps. But watch what happens here.
[1:09:58] It says, "Nevertheless, I have somewhat
[1:10:00] against thee." He says, "I've got
[1:10:01] something against you because thou hast
[1:10:04] left thy first love." What was their
[1:10:06] first love, church? It was Christ. Amen.
[1:10:09] We'll answer this shortly, but look, it
[1:10:11] says, "You fell away from your first
[1:10:13] love. Your love changed." And Jesus in
[1:10:15] Matthew 24 would say it get to the point
[1:10:18] where the love of many will wax cold
[1:10:20] because of what? Iniquity abounds.
[1:10:24] Disobedience to the will of God.
[1:10:26] Disobedience to the word of God. Doing
[1:10:28] what you want to do rather than what he
[1:10:30] tells you to do. Why did they leave? He
[1:10:34] says, "Remember therefore from whence
[1:10:36] thou art fallen and repent and do the
[1:10:38] first works." So they had something.
[1:10:40] They fell away from it. They lost their
[1:10:42] position. They lowered themselves. He
[1:10:44] says, "And if you don't repent and go
[1:10:46] back to what I told you," he says, "I
[1:10:48] will come quickly, come unto thee
[1:10:50] quickly, and will remove thy candlestick
[1:10:52] out of his place except thou repent." He
[1:10:55] says, "But this thou hast."
[1:10:58] He's dealing with a spirit, church.
[1:11:00] "This thou hast that thou hatest the
[1:11:02] deeds of the nickelians, which I also
[1:11:04] hate. He that has an ear, let him hear
[1:11:06] what the spirit saith unto the
[1:11:08] churches." Oh, the spirit's speaking.
[1:11:09] The spirit's speaking. How is he
[1:11:11] speaking? Through an angel messenger.
[1:11:14] Only one. Only one. Remember what Paul
[1:11:18] said to Timothy? He says, "Commit these
[1:11:20] things unto faithful men that will
[1:11:22] repeat my message, not come up with
[1:11:25] their own." Because the deeds of the
[1:11:28] nickels is to come up with your own.
[1:11:31] Okay?
[1:11:32] He says, "To him that hath an ear, let
[1:11:34] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:11:35] churches. To him that overcomemeth will
[1:11:37] I give to eat of the tree of life which
[1:11:39] is in the midst of the paradise of God.
[1:11:42] Now look at what Paul said about this as
[1:11:43] the first church age messenger. Now
[1:11:45] remember what we said. Paul is the voice
[1:11:47] of the Holy Spirit to that age. You
[1:11:50] cannot escape that. That is the voice of
[1:11:53] the Holy Spirit to the age is through
[1:11:56] that messenger. Amen. There's no other
[1:11:58] age in that voice except Paul's message
[1:12:01] because the Holy Spirit spoke through
[1:12:02] him. It wasn't his message. It was the
[1:12:05] Holy Spirit's message and Paul was just
[1:12:07] a repeating microphone. Okay?
[1:12:11] Now, watch this key because it plays out
[1:12:13] through the seven gentile church ages.
[1:12:16] Time and time again, they repeat the
[1:12:18] same problem. Israel had the same one.
[1:12:20] Paul says, "I marvel that you are so s
[1:12:24] removed from him that called you into
[1:12:26] the grace of Christ under another
[1:12:28] gospel." He says, "I can't believe I'm
[1:12:30] amazed at how fast you've turned away
[1:12:32] from this gospel.
[1:12:35] From who? Who called them into the
[1:12:37] gospel?
[1:12:39] The Holy Spirit. They turned away from
[1:12:42] the Holy Spirit. How did the Holy Spirit
[1:12:44] speak? Through Paul's message. He says,
[1:12:47] "Which is not another, but there be some
[1:12:49] that trouble you and would pervert the
[1:12:52] gospel of Christ." So, what's the
[1:12:54] problem? Are they preaching a new
[1:12:56] gospel?
[1:12:58] Yes and no. They're preaching the
[1:13:00] original gospel, but he says they're
[1:13:02] perverting it and presenting it as the
[1:13:05] original. In other words, they're taking
[1:13:07] the truth and they're twisting it and
[1:13:10] repreaching it and saying, "But this is
[1:13:11] the true gospel." Amen. Now, catch this
[1:13:14] church. These are professing Christians
[1:13:17] within the body of believers.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] They're preaching something they call
[1:13:24] the gospel, but it's their own gospel
[1:13:26] modeled after the true gospel, but it is
[1:13:29] not the true gospel. Now, listen to
[1:13:31] Paul's warning. He says, "But though we
[1:13:34] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:13:38] gospel unto you than that which you have
[1:13:40] preached unto you, let him be accursed."
[1:13:42] That's heavy stuff. That's serious. God
[1:13:45] protects his word. You look in
[1:13:47] Revelation says, "If any man adds to
[1:13:49] this book or takes away from it, his
[1:13:50] name is out of the book of life." That's
[1:13:52] it. That's what the being a curse means.
[1:13:55] Amen. Paul says, "Even I can't change
[1:13:57] this message I brought." As the author
[1:14:01] supposedly, he says, "I'm not allowed to
[1:14:02] change it." Why, church? Because it
[1:14:04] wasn't his message. Watch what he says.
[1:14:07] And he repeats it. He says, "As we said
[1:14:08] before, so say I now again. If any man
[1:14:11] preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:14:12] that which you have received, let him be
[1:14:14] a cursed. For do I now persuade man or
[1:14:17] God? Or do I seek to please men? Or if I
[1:14:21] yet please men, I should not be the
[1:14:23] servant of Christ. What is the
[1:14:24] temptation of a minister, church? It's
[1:14:26] to preach what the people want to hear.
[1:14:29] And Paul says, listen, am I here
[1:14:31] preaching what you want to hear?
[1:14:34] Paul preached hard messages.
[1:14:37] Go read Corinthians. Both of them. Paul
[1:14:39] preached hard messages.
[1:14:42] He wasn't preaching what they wanted to
[1:14:43] hear. He was preaching what God told him
[1:14:45] to preach. And that's what would help
[1:14:47] them. That would take them. Amen.
[1:14:48] Because what happens is when we preach
[1:14:50] what the people want to hear, what does
[1:14:52] it create? An echo chamber gospel. And
[1:14:55] what does it do? It increases
[1:14:56] membership. It increases money. It
[1:14:58] increases our church size.
[1:15:01] And God leaves the building.
[1:15:04] Paul said, "Am I telling you what you
[1:15:05] want to hear? Judge me by what you hear.
[1:15:08] Am I here trying to convince you? Am I
[1:15:09] trying to convince God?" He says, "Not
[1:15:11] on your life." He says, "But I certify
[1:15:13] to you, brethren, that the gospel which
[1:15:16] I which was preached of me is not after
[1:15:18] man." In other words, doesn't come from
[1:15:21] men. He says, "For I neither received it
[1:15:23] of man, neither was I taught it, but by
[1:15:27] the revelation of Jesus Christ." Paul
[1:15:29] says, "Guys, this isn't even my gospel.
[1:15:31] I used to think I knew right. I wasn't.
[1:15:34] I got the new birth, and I still didn't
[1:15:36] know, right? God had to take me on the
[1:15:38] back side of the desert and put all of
[1:15:40] the scriptures back together. And that's
[1:15:41] why I preach this today cuz the Holy
[1:15:43] Spirit came down on the backside of the
[1:15:45] desert in Arabia and he gave this to me.
[1:15:48] I don't have anything in this that is of
[1:15:50] me. This is 100% from God to you.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; That's the word that we're believing
[1:15:55] this morning. Amen. Now, watch how Paul
[1:15:58] comes preaching. You say, "What would
[1:16:00] you do with a message like that?" Did
[1:16:03] Paul come with great fanfare, with
[1:16:04] trumpets, riding in a chariot? Did he
[1:16:07] come walking soberly into the meetings
[1:16:10] with a a priestly robe and a miter and a
[1:16:12] tall hat?
[1:16:14] Or did he come into a a beautiful score
[1:16:16] of music that would sway the people's
[1:16:18] emotions and doves let go at key moments
[1:16:21] in the service?
[1:16:24] Strobe lights, pulsing music, soft,
[1:16:28] gentle music. How did Paul come, church?
[1:16:32] Look at how they come and that'll tell
[1:16:34] you what they're bringing. The Bos the
[1:16:37] gospel does not come with great fanfare,
[1:16:39] with great sounds. It comes in
[1:16:42] simplicity
[1:16:43] because it's for a simple people. The
[1:16:45] scripture says the what? The common
[1:16:48] people heard him gladly.
[1:16:50] Paul says, "And I, brethren, when I came
[1:16:53] to you came not with excellency of of
[1:16:56] speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you
[1:16:59] the testimony of God." Paul's message,
[1:17:02] he says, was a testimony of God. The
[1:17:04] book of Revelation says that the
[1:17:05] testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[1:17:09] of prophecy. In other words, the message
[1:17:11] of every true prophet will point you
[1:17:14] back to Jesus Christ, the living word.
[1:17:17] That is the purpose of a prophet. Amen.
[1:17:19] It will not point to a man. It will not
[1:17:21] point to a ministry. It will point you
[1:17:23] back to Christ, the living word. And if
[1:17:26] it is pointing to the man, get out.
[1:17:30] That simple.
[1:17:32] If you're sitting under a ministry
[1:17:33] that's pointing to men, get out.
[1:17:36] It's apostasy.
[1:17:39] The purpose of a prophetic utterance is
[1:17:41] to take you back to the word every
[1:17:43] single time. He says, "For I determined
[1:17:47] not to know anything among you, save
[1:17:49] Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[1:17:53] And I was with you how? in weakness and
[1:17:57] in fear and in much trembling. In other
[1:17:59] words, the way that Paul presented his
[1:18:01] message was not something to inspire
[1:18:03] confidence in him. Okay?
[1:18:06] He was presenting Christ. He was
[1:18:08] pointing people to a risen Christ, not
[1:18:10] to a powerful minister.
[1:18:13] It's an easy test of ministry. Are they
[1:18:16] pointing to themselves or are they
[1:18:18] pointing to Christ?
[1:18:20] Come to me. Work with me. Support me.
[1:18:23] Believe me. No, they've got to point you
[1:18:26] to Christ.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll get tied up. Amen. Are
[1:18:29] they binding you to themselves or are
[1:18:32] they freeing you by the word? Brother
[1:18:34] Garfield and I were talking uh after
[1:18:37] service there a while ago and he was
[1:18:38] telling me about a ministry and I won't
[1:18:40] give the details, brother Garfield, just
[1:18:41] to protect the the innocent and the
[1:18:43] guilty perhaps, but he was saying there
[1:18:45] was a there was a church that focused on
[1:18:46] this one partic particular doctrinal
[1:18:48] issue and everyone there believed it and
[1:18:51] everyone went by it and everybody was
[1:18:53] hardcore about it. But what happened is
[1:18:55] that the minister that preached it was
[1:18:57] so authoritarian, what was he doing? He
[1:18:59] was trying to get a grip on people and
[1:19:00] what he ended up doing was getting a
[1:19:01] young sister pregnant in the church.
[1:19:04] Why? He was binding the people to
[1:19:06] himself. And as soon as he ch they
[1:19:09] changed out pastors,
[1:19:11] the rules changed and everyone started
[1:19:13] going in a different direction.
[1:19:15] What is it? They're binding themselves
[1:19:18] to men, not to the word. And the
[1:19:20] ministry is allowing it. Church, don't
[1:19:23] believe me because I'm saying it.
[1:19:24] Believe it because the word says it. And
[1:19:26] bind yourself to the word because I'll
[1:19:27] be gone one day. God forbid I fall away.
[1:19:30] Bind yourself to the word. That's what's
[1:19:32] going to hold you.
[1:19:35] He says, "And my speech and my preaching
[1:19:37] was not with enticing words of men's
[1:19:39] wisdom." In other words, there was no
[1:19:41] seduction with Paul's words. When you
[1:19:44] listen to Paul, he didn't pull you in
[1:19:47] with great great oration,
[1:19:51] manipulating his sound,
[1:19:54] strategic pauses like I'm doing now.
[1:19:58] Church, they teach it all today. how to
[1:20:00] be a great speaker. And what happens is
[1:20:03] we had a hillbilly from Kentucky that
[1:20:05] didn't know his ain't from his.
[1:20:08] And what did he do? He did what Paul
[1:20:10] did. Listen to this. He says, "I didn't
[1:20:12] come with enticing words of man's
[1:20:13] wisdom, but in demonstration of the
[1:20:16] spirit and of power." Notice he's not
[1:20:18] tempting you with what you can have for
[1:20:20] your life. He's pointing you to a risen
[1:20:22] Christ. He's pointing you to the reality
[1:20:24] of a gospel that is alive and has life
[1:20:26] in it, not a dead religion that will
[1:20:29] make your life good. Cuz it wasn't good
[1:20:31] in those days of whom the world was not
[1:20:33] worthy. Speaks of those ages
[1:20:36] living in caves, getting together in
[1:20:38] tombs,
[1:20:40] being killed, torn aunder, saw in half,
[1:20:43] eaten by animals.
[1:20:46] Paul wasn't calling you to a life of
[1:20:47] ease. He was calling you to a life of
[1:20:49] overcoming. It was an overcoming gospel.
[1:20:52] But Paul had heard the voice of the Holy
[1:20:54] Spirit time and time again. And as the
[1:20:56] book of Revelation was written by John,
[1:20:58] crying out to each church age, so we saw
[1:21:00] Paul coming into his church age and
[1:21:03] crying out the very words that were
[1:21:04] written by John in the book of
[1:21:05] Revelation
[1:21:07] about that falling away. And watch what
[1:21:09] he says. He says, "Take heed therefore
[1:21:11] unto yourselves and to all the flock
[1:21:13] over the which the Holy Ghost hath made
[1:21:15] you overseers to feed the church of God
[1:21:18] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:21:20] blood." Remember this moving forward.
[1:21:22] The purpose of an overseer is always to
[1:21:25] feed the sheep. It's to feed the sheep,
[1:21:29] not to fleece the sheep.
[1:21:31] What matters is that the sheep are
[1:21:33] healthy, not that you get your cut.
[1:21:36] Okay? It's not to develop a
[1:21:38] multi-million dollar ministry. It's not
[1:21:39] to get a global following. It's to feed
[1:21:42] the sheep no matter what. What matters
[1:21:44] is that the sheep stay healthy.
[1:21:46] He says,"For I know this that after my
[1:21:48] departing shall grievous wolves." That
[1:21:51] word grievous means burdensome, heavy,
[1:21:54] weighty. These grievous wolves will
[1:21:56] enter in among you, not sparing the
[1:21:58] flock. So these are destructive people,
[1:22:01] not life sustaining. Remember we
[1:22:02] preached out of Genesis that when you
[1:22:04] are under a godly authority, then it
[1:22:07] produces life. It brings order out of
[1:22:09] chaos and it brings blessing rather than
[1:22:11] hurt. He says, "These are not under the
[1:22:14] right authority because when they come
[1:22:16] in, they're going to fleece the the
[1:22:17] flock. They're not going to spare them.
[1:22:19] They're in it for themselves." Now,
[1:22:21] watch where they come from. Also, of
[1:22:24] your own selves shall men arise speaking
[1:22:27] perverse things. That word perverse
[1:22:29] means crooked, misleading things with
[1:22:31] the intention of turning you away.
[1:22:35] Why would they turn you away? to draw
[1:22:37] away disciples after
[1:22:41] this guy.
[1:22:44] Amen. Watch out. Remember, we're
[1:22:45] speaking on an echochamber gospel. And
[1:22:47] where do the problems come from, church?
[1:22:52] Right here. Right here.
[1:22:56] It's from within. It's professing
[1:22:58] brothers. Amen. It's people that are
[1:23:00] biting their time, waiting till they can
[1:23:03] put their hands on the steering wheel
[1:23:04] and say, "I'm the pastor. I'm the
[1:23:06] preacher. I've got control. I've got
[1:23:08] authority. I've got the tithes. I'm the
[1:23:11] one that's going to determine the
[1:23:12] direction. I'm the only one that can
[1:23:14] lead or save this church. That's what he
[1:23:16] says they're doing.
[1:23:18] What's their methodology? Separate the
[1:23:21] sheep, cause divisions, draw people to
[1:23:25] themselves, not to Christ, and set up
[1:23:27] their own church with their own
[1:23:29] leadership.
[1:23:31] Okay?
[1:23:32] Paul saw it happening before he left as
[1:23:35] churches started trending towards the
[1:23:36] leadership of men rather than the Holy
[1:23:38] Spirit. And we know God uses men church.
[1:23:40] He's got a five-fold ministry that is
[1:23:43] authorized that is dedicated to preach
[1:23:45] the word. But it is his message, not
[1:23:47] their message. And it's his ministry,
[1:23:49] not their ministry. And it's his
[1:23:50] leadership, not their leadership. But
[1:23:52] there are men that are under a false
[1:23:54] anointing that'll produce Christianity.
[1:23:57] So-called.
[1:23:59] He's speaking to the Galatians. He says,
[1:24:00] "You did run well."
[1:24:04] Who did hinder you? He didn't say what.
[1:24:07] He said, "Who?"
[1:24:09] He says, "You are doing so well." What
[1:24:11] hindered you that you should not obey
[1:24:13] the truth? What he says something's
[1:24:15] pressured you to get away from the word?
[1:24:18] He says, "This persuasion cometh not of
[1:24:20] him that calleth you." Notice what the
[1:24:22] hindrance is. It's a persuasion.
[1:24:25] It's a seduction. It's a call. It's an
[1:24:28] argument. It's a doctrine. It's a pull
[1:24:31] from man.
[1:24:33] Amen. He's saying God didn't start this.
[1:24:37] So God can't be in the finish of it. You
[1:24:40] can't start down a road without God and
[1:24:41] believe God's going to walk with you
[1:24:42] down this road. It won't end well. Now
[1:24:45] catch this. He says, "A little levan
[1:24:47] leavenventh the whole lump. A little
[1:24:49] lump, a little decision, a little
[1:24:51] thought, a little opportunity, a little
[1:24:53] promotion, a little relationship, a
[1:24:55] little bit of internet search.
[1:24:59] A little bit of dabbling.
[1:25:02] That's all it takes. Okay. Eve started
[1:25:05] with a casual conversation and she ended
[1:25:07] up in death.
[1:25:09] It started little, but in time, the
[1:25:12] whole lump of dough is saturated with
[1:25:15] that leaven because it grows and grows.
[1:25:17] Church, there's nothing we ought to be
[1:25:18] casual about today.
[1:25:21] Every time you make a change in your
[1:25:23] lifestyle, you add something.
[1:25:26] Check it with the word. Because the
[1:25:29] scripture says, Satan's going around as
[1:25:30] a roaring lion, seeking whom he may
[1:25:33] devour. He's not a roaring lion. He's
[1:25:35] pretending to be a roaring lion. Amen.
[1:25:37] And what is it? It is not. It's subtle.
[1:25:40] It's subtle. For people that are trained
[1:25:42] in the word, he has to be subtle because
[1:25:44] anything obvious will throw up flags.
[1:25:46] It's always subtle and it's almost
[1:25:48] always cloaked in religion
[1:25:50] or the idea that you can handle
[1:25:53] something,
[1:25:55] but it's against the word. There's a
[1:25:57] caution flag that ought to be thrown up.
[1:25:59] But he says, "I have confidence in you
[1:26:01] through the Lord that you will be none
[1:26:03] otherwise minded, but he that troubleth
[1:26:05] you shall bear judgment." Whoever he is,
[1:26:07] he says he's going to get it. These guys
[1:26:09] that are doing this, they're going to
[1:26:10] get it when it comes to the end. Amen.
[1:26:12] Listen to this. He says Jesus said on
[1:26:14] earth a little leaven leavenvens the
[1:26:15] whole lump and it's got to be perfectly
[1:26:17] right or it isn't right at all. And the
[1:26:21] plan of salvation has got to be exact
[1:26:23] and God's promises are exact and they
[1:26:25] work exact or there is something wrong
[1:26:27] somewhere. And if the church of the
[1:26:29] living God is not achieving what God
[1:26:31] purposed for them to do, there's
[1:26:32] something wrong with that system
[1:26:34] somewhere. He says there just has to be.
[1:26:37] He says not too long ago I asked a lady
[1:26:39] if she were a Christian. She said, 'I
[1:26:41] will have you know, sir, that I burn a
[1:26:43] candle every night. What in the world
[1:26:45] has that got to do with it? He says, I'm
[1:26:46] a Methodist. I'm a Baptist. I'm a
[1:26:48] Pentecostal. That hasn't got to do a
[1:26:51] thing to do with it. He says it is the
[1:26:52] Holy Ghost or parish. Let me tell you
[1:26:56] this morning. You say, "I'm a message
[1:26:59] believer.
[1:27:01] It's the Holy Ghost or nothing."
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; This morning, church, you cannot get in
[1:27:07] because you identify with truth. because
[1:27:09] you identify with an end time messenger.
[1:27:11] You got to get the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:27:14] the only way. He says it's the Holy
[1:27:16] Ghost or perish. Why? Because there's
[1:27:17] only one spirit that baptizes us into
[1:27:19] that body. And you don't join a church.
[1:27:21] You join a body. And it's only one way
[1:27:23] to get there, and it's through the Holy
[1:27:25] Spirit. He says, well, starting back
[1:27:27] there in the first church, the people
[1:27:29] got to thinking and reasoning how to
[1:27:32] improve on God. He says, the deeds of
[1:27:35] the Nickelians began showing themselves.
[1:27:37] Now remember what nickelia means. It
[1:27:39] means to conquer the lady. It means to
[1:27:41] get the people to do what you want them
[1:27:43] to do by taking authority over them and
[1:27:46] binding them to yourself. See when the
[1:27:48] Holy Ghost leadership is rejected,
[1:27:50] something else has to come in.
[1:27:52] The they say that nature abhores a
[1:27:54] vacuum. Well, guess what? You abhore a
[1:27:56] vacuum. And when God or the when the
[1:27:58] spirit of God is taken out, another
[1:27:59] spirit has to come in. Amen. And the
[1:28:01] thing is it'll be the leadership of men.
[1:28:03] And if there's one thing men do, it's
[1:28:04] they self-promote.
[1:28:06] They built up themselves rather than the
[1:28:08] people. Our nature is selfish and it'll
[1:28:10] never take us to a good place. He says,
[1:28:12] "Then a group formed and they drifted
[1:28:16] away." See, it's just a little bit. A
[1:28:19] little bit here, a little bit there. You
[1:28:21] notice how it happens, church? The bride
[1:28:23] is built up word upon word, line upon
[1:28:26] line, here a little and there a little.
[1:28:28] And Satan's bride is a but she's
[1:28:32] built the same way. But it's here a
[1:28:34] little and there a little in the wrong
[1:28:35] direction. It's a drifting away until
[1:28:39] you turn around. You say, "How in the
[1:28:40] world did we get here?" And you are flat
[1:28:43] contradictory to the word of God. And
[1:28:44] you can't explain how you got there.
[1:28:46] It'd only be the grace of God that would
[1:28:48] open your eyes to let you see you've
[1:28:50] drifted away.
[1:28:52] He said they drifted away from the
[1:28:55] pattern of the word. He says all it
[1:28:57] takes is just one word changed and that
[1:29:00] little levan then leavenvens the whole
[1:29:02] lump. He that offends him one point to
[1:29:04] the law is guilty of all. He said Eve
[1:29:06] just changed one word that will do it.
[1:29:08] Now catch this next phrase. And when
[1:29:11] that Satan centered group was formed,
[1:29:17] Satan centered church.
[1:29:20] Did you know Eve started with good
[1:29:22] intentions?
[1:29:24] We would call these good people,
[1:29:28] sincere people.
[1:29:31] But sincerity is one of the greatest
[1:29:33] traps that Satan has because sincerely
[1:29:35] wrong is still wrong.
[1:29:37] Satan centered group. What a statement.
[1:29:42] These are believers professing.
[1:29:45] He says it began, this group began to
[1:29:48] hate and to fight the true believers,
[1:29:51] insisting that they, the aliens, were
[1:29:54] the church of God. He says, notice how
[1:29:56] organization breeds hatred. It destroys
[1:29:59] fellowship. It makes bitterness. That is
[1:30:02] what myrrh means. This is what Smyrna
[1:30:05] was full of bitterness. A root of
[1:30:08] bitterness defiles many. He says, "So
[1:30:10] more and more defilement was coming in
[1:30:13] and every age would feel its scars."
[1:30:17] Church, when you have separation, when
[1:30:20] you have division and hate goes with it,
[1:30:23] what comes behind? Bitterness sets in.
[1:30:26] And notice he says it didn't stop with
[1:30:28] this people. It didn't stop with this
[1:30:29] church age. It rolled on and on and on
[1:30:33] throughout to the end of time.
[1:30:37] It's a domino effect. But we start
[1:30:39] today, church, it'll keep rolling. I
[1:30:42] say, let's roll with the right things
[1:30:44] cuz otherwise we have something that can
[1:30:45] keep producing and keep producing. But
[1:30:48] what is this church? Why does it keep
[1:30:50] rolling on after those people are dead?
[1:30:52] Cuz spirits don't die. Spirits don't
[1:30:55] die. And it's a spirit. It's an
[1:30:57] influence. It wasn't just a person. It
[1:30:59] was a false anointing on these vessels
[1:31:01] that caused them to produce this. Amen.
[1:31:04] Listen to what he says. One word of God
[1:31:07] displaced,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; not just taken out, but twisted,
[1:31:13] misinterpreted.
[1:31:14] He says spoils the whole picture. You go
[1:31:17] back to Eve and you see it. One word,
[1:31:21] twisted,
[1:31:22] the whole thing falls apart.
[1:31:25] What we see here is people that have
[1:31:27] turned to their own religious lifestyle
[1:31:30] rather than God's will and way. Amen.
[1:31:36] It's a religion. It's a God of their own
[1:31:40] making. Amen. And it's a spirit. It's an
[1:31:42] etern. It's an external influence that's
[1:31:45] operating in their life. And it is not
[1:31:47] the Holy Spirit. Amen. It's not the
[1:31:48] spirit of God. Now, that's hard to hear,
[1:31:50] but let me say it anyways. These are
[1:31:52] professing Christians,
[1:31:55] professing brothers and sisters
[1:31:58] potentially in the midst. Now, I'm not
[1:31:59] preaching to this church right now by
[1:32:01] God's grace,
[1:32:03] but I'm preaching on a principle
[1:32:06] because as we preach things here that
[1:32:08] are different from so many churches, the
[1:32:10] question arises, well, what about them?
[1:32:14] What anointing are they under? If
[1:32:16] they're what they're doing is wrong,
[1:32:20] then are they even Christians?
[1:32:23] Are you ready to hear it straight?
[1:32:26] If it's not the Holy Spirit, there's
[1:32:29] only one other spirit,
[1:32:32] the unholy spirit.
[1:32:34] There's only two sides. There's God and
[1:32:36] everything else. And if you are under
[1:32:39] the anointing of the Holy Spirit, it
[1:32:41] will always take you back to the word
[1:32:44] because it is the spirit of truth,
[1:32:48] not the just the spirit of signs and
[1:32:49] wonders and ministries. It's the spirit
[1:32:52] of truth. It takes you back to the word.
[1:32:55] And if you're under a spirit that takes
[1:32:57] you away from the word, that changes the
[1:33:00] word, then you're under the influence of
[1:33:02] an unholy spirit. You are under satanic
[1:33:06] influence
[1:33:08] in church behind a pulpit professing to
[1:33:12] be a Christian. That's hard, but it's
[1:33:16] the truth. Amen.
[1:33:20] Notice this has been there all the time.
[1:33:23] Paul's showing it in the first church
[1:33:24] age. John sees it all the way through to
[1:33:26] the end. Why? Because it's a spirit
[1:33:29] that's been working since the origin of
[1:33:33] mankind trying to get in, trying to grow
[1:33:37] another bride, another vine, produce its
[1:33:40] own thing. Amen. It's religious. It's
[1:33:44] subtle. It's self-serving. And it will
[1:33:46] contradict the word if you give it
[1:33:48] enough time every single time. It always
[1:33:51] goes that way. Paul says this, "Now we
[1:33:53] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[1:33:55] our Lord Jesus Christ and by our
[1:33:56] gathering together unto him, that you be
[1:33:58] not soon shaken in mind or be troubled,
[1:34:00] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[1:34:03] letter as from us, as the day of Christ
[1:34:05] is at hand." He says, "Let no man
[1:34:07] deceive you by any means. For that day
[1:34:09] shall not come except there come a
[1:34:12] falling away first and that man of sin
[1:34:14] be revealed, the son of predition." that
[1:34:16] what Paul's dealing with is that there
[1:34:17] was brothers coming in and saying,
[1:34:18] "Guess what? The Lord has already come
[1:34:21] and you missed it."
[1:34:23] Church, this is only what 10 years into
[1:34:26] Paul's ministry and they're already
[1:34:28] preaching. You missed the rapture.
[1:34:30] And so Paul has to come behind and it's
[1:34:32] not Paul, it's the Holy Spirit,
[1:34:34] remember? And he corrects this teaching
[1:34:37] there. And he says, "Listen, there's
[1:34:38] something has to happen before that day
[1:34:40] can come." Okay? He says the first thing
[1:34:43] is there has to come a falling away.
[1:34:46] And what did we see in the first church
[1:34:48] age? You fell away from your first love.
[1:34:51] You fell away from your original
[1:34:53] position. That word falling away. He
[1:34:55] says there has he says there has to come
[1:34:57] a falling away first. That word that
[1:34:58] phrase falling away is the word apostasy
[1:35:01] and it means to forsake the truth. In
[1:35:04] other words, they forsook the word of
[1:35:06] God. There has to come a falling away of
[1:35:08] the professing church from the word of
[1:35:11] God.
[1:35:12] Catch that. They will say they are
[1:35:14] preaching the word, but they will have
[1:35:16] fallen away from the word of God. And
[1:35:19] what happens in that time? Paul says the
[1:35:21] culmination of the falling away of the
[1:35:23] word is that there comes a man of sin
[1:35:26] and a son of predition that will be
[1:35:28] revealed at that same time. So in the
[1:35:30] fullness of this falling away, there's
[1:35:32] going to be a revealing of the son of
[1:35:33] predition or the man of sin and the son
[1:35:35] of predition. What does that person look
[1:35:38] like? He says this this person opposes
[1:35:42] and exalts himself above all that is
[1:35:45] called God or that is worshiped so that
[1:35:47] he as God siteth in the temple of God
[1:35:51] showing himself that he is God. What's
[1:35:54] he doing church? He's acting in the
[1:35:56] place of God. He's putting people in.
[1:35:58] He's putting people out. He's sending
[1:36:00] people to eternal life. He's sending
[1:36:01] people to hell. Amen. He's speaking for
[1:36:03] God. He's the vicer of Christ.
[1:36:06] Amen. We call him the pope. But we have
[1:36:09] to see that this is not a new thing, but
[1:36:12] rather it is the manifestation of
[1:36:14] something that's been there all along.
[1:36:16] It's the full revealing of a spirit in a
[1:36:19] man that has been through all the ages.
[1:36:22] Okay? It is not only the pope. See, the
[1:36:25] the denominations will say, "Well,
[1:36:27] obviously the city on seven hills is
[1:36:29] Rome. It's the Vatican. They're going to
[1:36:31] be destroyed." But remember, she is the
[1:36:32] the harlot and the mother of harlots.
[1:36:35] There's a whole system that dropped out
[1:36:37] from her. Not just Catholic, but the
[1:36:39] whole Protestant system is her
[1:36:41] denominational sisters
[1:36:44] and it's produced the exact same thing.
[1:36:48] They're acting in the place of God
[1:36:50] because they kicked him out.
[1:36:53] And all that's left is their own
[1:36:55] leadership. Amen.
[1:36:57] He says,"Remember ye not. When I was
[1:37:00] with you, I told you these things. And
[1:37:02] now you know what withholdeth that he
[1:37:04] might be revealed in his time. For the
[1:37:06] mystery of iniquity, there's two
[1:37:08] mysteries that are going to be revealed
[1:37:09] at the end time. There's the mystery of
[1:37:11] godliness, which is Christ in you, the
[1:37:13] hope of glory. And there's the mystery
[1:37:15] of iniquity, which is Satan manifested
[1:37:18] in flesh." Amen. And the thing is, it's
[1:37:21] going to surprise everyone where God is
[1:37:23] and where Satan is. Because Satan's
[1:37:25] going to be where they think God is and
[1:37:27] God is going to be where they think
[1:37:28] Satan is.
[1:37:32] That's truth this morning. That's hard
[1:37:34] truth. Amen. What is it? We see in
[1:37:37] Revelation 3 that Christ is outside the
[1:37:40] professing church. He's not in there and
[1:37:44] he's knocking on the door of individual
[1:37:45] hearts because the professing church
[1:37:48] kicked him out a long time ago. Amen. He
[1:37:52] says, "For the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:37:53] already work." He says, "It's going on
[1:37:55] right now. Only he who now letth will
[1:37:58] let that word letth or or let means
[1:38:00] hinder." So what's hindering the spirit
[1:38:02] of Satan, the the of this man of
[1:38:05] predition, the son of predition, this
[1:38:06] man of sin? It's the Holy Spirit.
[1:38:08] There's a spirit holding back the
[1:38:10] authority of Satan in that church, in
[1:38:13] that man, in that system. When is he
[1:38:15] going to be taken away? When is the Holy
[1:38:17] Spirit going to be lifted off the earth,
[1:38:18] church? when we go, God is holding back
[1:38:22] the tides of judgment of Satan's reign
[1:38:25] on earth until we get out of here. And
[1:38:28] as soon as the bride goes, right,
[1:38:30] Revelation 12, bride goes up. Revelation
[1:38:32] 13, Satan comes down. Now, the full
[1:38:34] power is manifested in the beast. Satan
[1:38:36] comes down knowing that his time is
[1:38:38] short. And what does he do? He now puts
[1:38:40] himself into a man.
[1:38:43] He embodies himself in flesh. Christ
[1:38:46] embodied in the bride is taken away.
[1:38:48] Christ comes down. He's got the whole
[1:38:49] world to himself except for those
[1:38:52] 144,000 Jews.
[1:38:55] What happens? The blood comes off the
[1:38:56] mercy seat and all that's left is
[1:38:58] judgment. What's judgment? You get what
[1:39:01] you've been believing.
[1:39:04] What a horrible, horrible thing. You get
[1:39:06] what you've been believing all along.
[1:39:08] You get what you wanted. You get what
[1:39:09] you set up. They finally reap what
[1:39:12] they've been sowing for thousands and
[1:39:13] thousands of years. He says, "And then
[1:39:15] shall that wicked be revealed whom the
[1:39:18] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[1:39:19] his mouth." What is it? It's the power
[1:39:21] of the spirit speaking the word. "And
[1:39:23] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[1:39:25] coming." Notice Christ in Revelation
[1:39:27] when he comes, he is called the word of
[1:39:29] God.
[1:39:31] His identity is the word of God. So what
[1:39:33] do we have today? We have a Christ of
[1:39:35] our own making. Not here. But you see
[1:39:36] what they're doing. The churches have a
[1:39:38] Christ of their own making. I saw a man
[1:39:41] in a in a United Church wearing a dress
[1:39:44] with with all the colors of his nasty
[1:39:46] rainbow in his hair
[1:39:50] declaring Christ.
[1:39:53] But the word wasn't there.
[1:39:56] When Christ comes, his identity is the
[1:39:58] word. And today, what do we do? We turn
[1:40:00] him into a creed. We turn him into a
[1:40:02] dogma. We turn him into a collective
[1:40:04] idea of what is right. He stands alone,
[1:40:07] church.
[1:40:09] He stands alone. We join to him. He does
[1:40:11] not join to us that way. We've got to go
[1:40:13] to him.
[1:40:16] He says, "And shall destroy with the
[1:40:17] brightness of his coming." The scripture
[1:40:18] says, "Out of his mouth goes a sharp
[1:40:20] sword." What's a sharp sword in the
[1:40:21] scripture? It's always the word. Christ
[1:40:23] will destroy all power of Satan by the
[1:40:25] power of the spoken word. He says, "Even
[1:40:28] him whose coming is after the working of
[1:40:31] Satan." In other words, all of Satan's
[1:40:33] manipulations and and all his efforts
[1:40:36] are have gone into this man, this
[1:40:38] antichrist that is identified. He is
[1:40:40] Satan's great achievement.
[1:40:43] He's the fulfillment of all that Satan's
[1:40:45] been trying to do throughout time. And
[1:40:47] he says he's going to come with all
[1:40:49] power and signs and lying wonders. Wow.
[1:40:54] Church, does Satan have power?
[1:40:58] Yep.
[1:41:00] Satan had power over Christ.
[1:41:04] How
[1:41:06] Pilate
[1:41:08] Pilate says, "Don't you know I can take
[1:41:10] your life or save your life?" He says,
[1:41:12] "You have no power except it were
[1:41:15] given." Satan has power, but it's not
[1:41:18] absolute. It's given. And with his
[1:41:20] power, he can do signs and wonders, but
[1:41:22] they're lying wonders. Remember, church,
[1:41:25] what is a lie? It's something that gets
[1:41:27] exposed eventually. It doesn't last.
[1:41:30] Pharaoh had magicians that match Moses
[1:41:32] step for step, but they couldn't undo or
[1:41:35] overcome the word. They could produce
[1:41:37] their serpents.
[1:41:39] They didn't want to produce fleas, but
[1:41:41] they couldn't get rid of them. Their
[1:41:42] power only went so far, but there's
[1:41:46] power there. You say, is there satanic
[1:41:48] power? Yeah. Meet somebody that's filled
[1:41:50] with the with the spirit of Satan one
[1:41:52] time that's under demonic control.
[1:41:54] You'll see power, church. We were under
[1:41:56] that power. We know he's got power. He's
[1:41:59] got power over lives and people. But
[1:42:02] what does he come with? He says he comes
[1:42:03] with all deceivableness of
[1:42:05] unrighteousness in them that perish.
[1:42:07] Notice signs and wonders, but he doesn't
[1:42:09] come with the word, no truth. Why? He's
[1:42:11] the father of liars. He comes with a
[1:42:14] false message. It's his own. He comes
[1:42:15] with religion, never with the truth,
[1:42:17] though. It says, "And because they
[1:42:19] receive not the love of the truth, that
[1:42:21] they might be saved." The reason people
[1:42:23] will believe that Antichrist message,
[1:42:25] that anti-word message, is because they
[1:42:27] didn't love the truth when it came their
[1:42:28] way.
[1:42:30] He says, "For this cause, God shall send
[1:42:32] them strong delusion that they should
[1:42:34] believe a lie." You know how they
[1:42:36] believe it? They preach it. They live
[1:42:38] it. They accept it. They promote it. And
[1:42:41] you look around today and we see that
[1:42:43] both the lie and the delusion are
[1:42:46] strong. The lie is powerful and the
[1:42:48] delusion is strong. And we see people
[1:42:50] today in the world in general that are
[1:42:52] believing nonsense and they are
[1:42:53] convinced that they are right. But then
[1:42:55] you go into a church and they're
[1:42:56] believing things that are 100% contrary
[1:42:59] to the word of God. I literally heard a
[1:43:01] guy the other day that quoted a
[1:43:03] scripture and flipped its meaning
[1:43:05] completely. You'd think it's such a
[1:43:07] clear scripture. There's no way he can
[1:43:09] do that. But he did it. Why? Because
[1:43:11] he's under a delusion.
[1:43:14] Their eyes have been darkened. Their
[1:43:15] mind has been given over to a reprobate
[1:43:17] mind.
[1:43:18] And so they can't see the truth. It says
[1:43:21] that they might all might be damned who
[1:43:23] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[1:43:26] in unrighteousness.
[1:43:28] This topic is way too big to fit in a
[1:43:31] single service and I'm going to start to
[1:43:32] wind it down here in a moment. But I
[1:43:34] want to talk about this man of sin or
[1:43:36] this son of predition. Now that phrase
[1:43:38] man of sin literally means the man of
[1:43:40] lawlessness. And that son of predition
[1:43:42] means the son of destruction. So it
[1:43:44] shows you where this is going.
[1:43:47] Lawlessness. You are no longer bound by
[1:43:49] the word. The word has no hold on you.
[1:43:52] And where does it take you? Destruction.
[1:43:54] For wide does the gate broad is the way
[1:43:57] that leads to destruction. This whole
[1:43:59] system is bringing people to
[1:44:02] destruction. Amen. And we'll see this in
[1:44:04] the coming services. If you can't make
[1:44:06] it on Wednesday night, please listen in
[1:44:07] because I'll be continuing this and
[1:44:09] you'll be left behind if we don't if you
[1:44:11] don't if you jump in again on on Sunday.
[1:44:14] Now listen. And this is Jesus speaking
[1:44:15] here. And he says, "While I was with
[1:44:17] them in the world, we're talking about
[1:44:19] the son of predition. I kept them in thy
[1:44:21] name. Those who thou gavest me, I have
[1:44:23] kept, and none of them is lost, but the
[1:44:26] son of predition that the scripture
[1:44:27] might be fulfilled." So who's the son of
[1:44:29] predition here? It's Judas. Amen. Judas
[1:44:32] is scary. He was a false apostle, but
[1:44:35] yet he was chosen.
[1:44:38] Jesus said, "I have chosen you, and one
[1:44:41] of you is a devil."
[1:44:43] The scripture said of Judas that he was
[1:44:45] a liar and a thief
[1:44:48] when Jesus chose him. Okay?
[1:44:53] People wonder today, how can people do
[1:44:55] things for God and yet not be real
[1:44:56] Christians? Here's your answer right
[1:44:58] here. Look at Balum. Look at Caiaphas.
[1:45:01] Look at Dayathan. Look at Kora. God will
[1:45:04] use anyone if they'll let him. But they
[1:45:07] need a full surrender for them to be a
[1:45:09] child of God. There has to be something
[1:45:10] on the inside, not just something that
[1:45:13] wants. And you'll find that all of these
[1:45:15] people wanted something for themselves
[1:45:18] rather than a surrendered heart to God.
[1:45:21] Catch us now as we're starting to close.
[1:45:23] He says, "Let me show you what I've been
[1:45:25] trying to teach all along about the two
[1:45:26] vines which come from two different
[1:45:28] spirits." He says, "Take the example of
[1:45:31] Judas. Jesus and Judas this time. Jesus
[1:45:33] was the son of God. Judas was the son of
[1:45:35] predition. God entered into Jesus. Satan
[1:45:39] entered into Judas. Now, if you look in
[1:45:41] John 13, what happens is it says that
[1:45:44] Satan put into the heart of Judas to
[1:45:48] betray Jesus. So, in other words, Satan
[1:45:51] planted an idea. He planted a thought
[1:45:54] and what happened was Judas accepted
[1:45:57] that thought and he acted on it. And
[1:45:59] then you go to Luke 22 and it says that
[1:46:02] Satan entered in to Judas.
[1:46:05] It went from an idea to an incarnation
[1:46:10] like that
[1:46:13] because Judas was willing to act on it.
[1:46:16] Satan entered into him and performed the
[1:46:18] final act of the betrayal of Jesus
[1:46:20] Christ in his body.
[1:46:24] A little levan leavenvens the whole
[1:46:27] lump. You open the door to that spirit.
[1:46:30] Look out. Amen. a thought, an idea
[1:46:34] turned into the very personification of
[1:46:36] Satan. He says Jesus had a full Holy
[1:46:39] Ghost ministry for good. God anointed
[1:46:42] Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
[1:46:43] and with power who went about doing good
[1:46:45] and healing all that were oppressed of
[1:46:47] the devil for God was with him. He says
[1:46:49] Acts 10:38 and it says, "For he Judas
[1:46:52] was numbered with us and had obtained
[1:46:56] part of this ministry." Acts 11:17.
[1:47:00] Matthew 10:1 says, "And when he called
[1:47:01] unto him his 12 disciples, he gave them
[1:47:03] power against unclean spirits to cast
[1:47:05] them out and to heal all manner of
[1:47:06] sickness and all manner of disease." He
[1:47:08] says that spirit that was in Judas went
[1:47:11] right along through the ministry of
[1:47:13] Jesus.
[1:47:16] This is a mystery, church. Catch it. He
[1:47:20] says, "Then they both came to the cross.
[1:47:23] Jesus was hanged upon the cross gladly
[1:47:25] giving his life for sinners and
[1:47:26] commended his spirit to God. His spirit
[1:47:29] went to God and then was poured out into
[1:47:30] the church at Pentecost. But Judas
[1:47:33] hanged himself and his spirit went back
[1:47:35] to Satan. Remember, you'll know them by
[1:47:38] their fruits. Give them enough rope and
[1:47:40] they'll hang themselves.
[1:47:42] Judas got to the point where he couldn't
[1:47:44] live with what he'd done.
[1:47:47] He says his spirit, Judas hanged
[1:47:49] himself. His spirit went back to Satan.
[1:47:52] But after Pentecost, that same spirit
[1:47:54] that was in Judas came upon the false
[1:47:56] vine that grows up right alongside the
[1:47:59] true vine. But he said, notice Judas
[1:48:01] spirit never got to Pentecost. It never
[1:48:03] went up to receive the Holy Spirit. It
[1:48:06] could not. He says, "But what did did
[1:48:09] that Judas spirit go for? It went for
[1:48:12] the bag of gold." How it loved money, it
[1:48:15] still loves money.
[1:48:17] You look at ministries.
[1:48:19] What is every minister out there wanting
[1:48:21] these days? It seems like more
[1:48:24] membership for more money for me.
[1:48:28] I see these guys, no offense to our
[1:48:30] Nigerians here.
[1:48:33] Profit after profit after profit, and
[1:48:35] all they want to be is like the biggest
[1:48:37] guy there that's got the Rolls-Royces
[1:48:39] and he's got the big watches and the
[1:48:41] fancy suits and people bowing down and
[1:48:43] kissing. That's what they all want
[1:48:44] because he's got it. That's their whole
[1:48:45] goal is to be like him. And what is it?
[1:48:47] It's the Mi Show.
[1:48:50] It's horrible. Listen, we've got it in
[1:48:52] America. We've got it in Canada as well.
[1:48:55] Me, me, me. This is what we're going to
[1:48:56] do. This is how it's going to happen.
[1:48:58] Watch God vindicate me. Watch God prove
[1:48:59] me. No, we're here to prove him. We're
[1:49:03] here to point to him. But it's all about
[1:49:05] me. And I see these guys, they say,
[1:49:07] "Shall I prophesy? Shall I prophesy?"
[1:49:09] They say, "Prophesy. Prophesy, prophet."
[1:49:13] What is it? It's taking us back to Ahab.
[1:49:18] prophesy. Thus sayeth the Lord, go up.
[1:49:21] And Jehoshaphat said, "Is there one
[1:49:23] more?"
[1:49:24] 400 prophets said, "Go up." Jehoshaphat,
[1:49:29] the child of God, said, "Is there one
[1:49:31] more? I need 401."
[1:49:35] And Micah didn't come back. We're going
[1:49:37] to preach on this. I'm getting ahead of
[1:49:38] myself. Micah didn't say, "Thus sayeth
[1:49:39] the Lord." He says, "Let me go ask."
[1:49:43] Prophesy, brother Micah. That's what
[1:49:45] they were saying. prophesy, brother
[1:49:47] Micah. Brother Brandham said, "I had to
[1:49:49] go to brother Neville and talk to him."
[1:49:51] He says, "Because people were coming to
[1:49:53] him trying to get him to prophesy over
[1:49:55] them." And he says the strain that was
[1:49:57] on him, he says it would have made him
[1:49:58] say something that wasn't true because
[1:50:00] the people were forcing him into it.
[1:50:03] Look out. You can't say thus sayith the
[1:50:05] Lord unless the Lord says it. And
[1:50:07] otherwise, you get into problems in a
[1:50:08] hurry. I saw one of them eventually what
[1:50:11] he did was he called up a woman and
[1:50:12] tried to speak over her and everything
[1:50:13] he said was wrong.
[1:50:16] And everyone just started looking around
[1:50:17] saying, "Where's the gift?" Why? Because
[1:50:19] it was all about himself.
[1:50:23] He says, "It went for the bag of gold.
[1:50:25] How it loved money, it still loves
[1:50:27] money. If it goes about in the name of
[1:50:29] Jesus, doing mighty things and holding
[1:50:31] great meetings, it still makes more of
[1:50:33] money and buildings and education and
[1:50:36] everything with the material concept."
[1:50:38] He says, "Just watch that spirit that
[1:50:39] has come upon them and don't be fooled."
[1:50:43] Are we listening, church?
[1:50:46] Are we listening? Follow the money. One
[1:50:50] of the greatest things you can do,
[1:50:51] follow the money. Who benefits? What is
[1:50:53] it? Quibono. I think I think that's the
[1:50:56] Latin. Who benefits? Follow the benefit
[1:50:58] and you'll find the influence.
[1:51:02] Because if we're not giving of ourselves
[1:51:03] up here and whether we're getting to
[1:51:06] ourselves, Kabad's written over the
[1:51:09] door. The glory of the Lord has departed
[1:51:10] and it's been replaced with my ministry.
[1:51:12] God forbid it ever happened.
[1:51:15] He says, "Judas went about as one of the
[1:51:17] 12 and he did miracles, too. But he did
[1:51:21] not have the spirit of God as his own,
[1:51:26] but he did have a ministry." Catch that.
[1:51:29] He did have a ministry. He never got to
[1:51:32] Pentecost as he was not true seed. He
[1:51:34] was not a true child of God. No, sir.
[1:51:36] And that is the way right now in the
[1:51:39] synagogue of Satan. Ouch.
[1:51:43] We're going to preach on this in the
[1:51:44] next service or two. The synagogue of
[1:51:46] Satan. Today we call it the church of
[1:51:48] Satan.
[1:51:49] The church of Satan.
[1:51:53] Can you imagine if you talk to a person,
[1:51:55] they say, "I go to the church of Satan."
[1:51:57] Now, there's some that do it. There are
[1:51:59] literal oult worshippers, Satan
[1:52:01] worshippers. This ain't who he's talking
[1:52:03] about. He's talking about pretended
[1:52:05] brothers, false anointed ones that have
[1:52:07] a ministry but won't go on to the full
[1:52:10] experience. He says it's the church of
[1:52:14] Satan.
[1:52:17] All of them
[1:52:19] churches of Satan.
[1:52:23] He says, "Don't be fooled. You won't be
[1:52:25] fooled if you are of the very elect."
[1:52:27] Jesus said, "You wouldn't be fooled." He
[1:52:29] says, "Yes, those folks say they are
[1:52:31] Christians, but they aren't."
[1:52:35] As we finish up, he says, "But we are
[1:52:37] bound to give thanks always to God. For
[1:52:40] you, brethren, beloved of the Lord,
[1:52:41] because God has from the beginning
[1:52:45] chosen you to salvation through
[1:52:47] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:52:51] of the truth." You say, "I've got the
[1:52:52] Holy Spirit." Is it leading you into
[1:52:54] truth? Or is it leading you to dancing
[1:52:56] and shouting and speaking in tongues and
[1:52:58] outward manifestations but not giving
[1:53:00] you the life of the word? Amen. That's
[1:53:03] what we're preaching on this morning.
[1:53:04] This is why we don't force people in or
[1:53:07] out. Brother Vichel, I hope I can speak
[1:53:09] of you this morning. This is why when
[1:53:11] brother Vichel came to our church, we
[1:53:13] didn't sit down and say, "This is how
[1:53:14] you got to do it, brother." What do we
[1:53:16] do? We preach the word. And if there's a
[1:53:20] seed of God in there, it'll accept the
[1:53:22] word of God. And if there isn't, it will
[1:53:25] go away. And we have to be okay with
[1:53:27] that because Paul says from the
[1:53:29] beginning, he chose you. And he prepared
[1:53:33] you to be sanctified for his spirit by
[1:53:36] his spirit so that you can believe the
[1:53:38] truth.
[1:53:40] If there's nothing in you to receive it,
[1:53:41] it doesn't matter how much I preach, how
[1:53:43] much I force, how legalistic I get, how
[1:53:46] much pressure I put on you. It ain't
[1:53:47] going to work.
[1:53:50] We didn't want a brother vichel that
[1:53:51] believes the way we do. We want a
[1:53:53] brother vichel that believes because
[1:53:54] there's something in him.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Not because we've convinced him because
[1:53:58] we put him in an echo chamber. But
[1:54:00] because he's received the same spirit
[1:54:02] that we've received and that leads him
[1:54:03] into truth rather than our pressure.
[1:54:06] Amen.
[1:54:08] The elect will hear the truth and the
[1:54:10] religious and godless won't. Why?
[1:54:13] Because we're not in religion, church.
[1:54:15] We're in Christ. And it takes the spirit
[1:54:17] of God to get you into that. Amen. We
[1:54:19] are joined to Christ, not a church. And
[1:54:20] that's why we don't have church
[1:54:21] membership. We don't have a roll call
[1:54:23] here. We don't have a book that lists
[1:54:25] all the members. No sir. If you got the
[1:54:27] spirit of God, you're a part of the
[1:54:28] church. And we don't get to decide if
[1:54:30] you're in or out. I say, "Praise the
[1:54:32] Lord." He says, "Where unto he called
[1:54:35] you by our gospel." Now, that's a
[1:54:38] mystery right there
[1:54:41] because it's the calling of God, but
[1:54:42] it's Paul's gospel. He says, "How does
[1:54:45] that work?" It only works if the gospel
[1:54:47] of Paul comes from God. Cuz it's not
[1:54:50] Paul's gospel then. It's the voice of
[1:54:52] the Holy Spirit. He says, "To the
[1:54:53] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[1:54:56] Christ." Church, I raised my hands in my
[1:54:58] in my room when I read that. Because
[1:55:01] Paul said, "I have not shunned to
[1:55:03] declare to you the whole word of God."
[1:55:05] He says, "I've told you everything he
[1:55:07] told me and it's not of me. It's not
[1:55:09] from me. I can't change it cuz you don't
[1:55:11] like it. I can't change it because it
[1:55:13] makes us uncomfortable. I can't change
[1:55:15] it because it puts people out because
[1:55:18] its purpose is to put people in.
[1:55:21] That's the goal of the word is to get
[1:55:22] people in. And that means it's going to
[1:55:24] exclude some people cuz they won't take
[1:55:26] it.
[1:55:27] It's a hard truth. We can't put them in.
[1:55:31] We can't put them out. All we can do is
[1:55:33] preach the word in its full truth and
[1:55:36] leave it up to God. Amen.
[1:55:39] He says, "Therefore, brethren, standfast
[1:55:43] and hold the traditions which you have
[1:55:45] been taught, whether by word or our
[1:55:47] epistle." What's this key to not being
[1:55:49] sucked into this system of the the the
[1:55:51] the man of sin and the son of predition?
[1:55:54] Paul says, "Stand fast. Don't move.
[1:55:58] There's already been an established
[1:55:59] foundation. Don't move from it. Don't
[1:56:02] get pulled into echo chambers. Don't get
[1:56:05] pulled in into this brother's ministry
[1:56:06] and that brother's ministry. stay with
[1:56:08] what you've learned.
[1:56:10] He says in all the traditions that have
[1:56:12] been taught, he says, if I didn't teach
[1:56:14] it, don't let some man add to you, cuz
[1:56:16] that's a grievous wolf. It's a heavy
[1:56:19] burden you're not meant to bear, and
[1:56:21] it'll destroy you, and it'll benefit
[1:56:24] them in your destruction.
[1:56:26] Stick with what's proven is what he's
[1:56:28] saying. Remember Hebrews 7 uh uh Hebrews
[1:56:32] 10:7 and 10:8 he says remember those
[1:56:36] that have the rule of you and their what
[1:56:40] their life their conversation and he
[1:56:42] says what is their life their
[1:56:44] conversation what is the end of their
[1:56:45] life he says it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:56:47] yesterday today and forever that's what
[1:56:50] we follow we follow a ministry we follow
[1:56:54] a a proofy ministry that produces Jesus
[1:56:57] Christ all over in not some doctrine of
[1:57:00] ideas about hair and dresses and
[1:57:03] headship and these different things, but
[1:57:05] we follow a living word that produces
[1:57:07] Jesus Christ all over again. It's not
[1:57:10] about legalism. It's not about dos and
[1:57:13] don'ts. It's about the spirit of Christ
[1:57:15] producing the wool of a Christian sheep.
[1:57:18] That's all that's all we're preaching
[1:57:19] here this morning. Paul's saying, "Stay
[1:57:21] with what I've given you cuz it's the
[1:57:23] only truth there is." And there's people
[1:57:25] coming are going to try and change it
[1:57:26] into something else. And when they
[1:57:28] change it, it'll lose its power and
[1:57:29] it'll take you into destruction.
[1:57:33] You know, we have these things called
[1:57:34] the generally accepted accounting
[1:57:37] principles. GAP. Amen. Brother Bob.
[1:57:40] Brother Bob. We have GAP. What am I
[1:57:43] preaching to you this morning?
[1:57:46] don't follow the generally accepted
[1:57:49] principles of Christianity because the
[1:57:52] world has taken the Christian world has
[1:57:54] taken this word and they've turned it
[1:57:57] into a message of destruction.
[1:58:00] Look at take the simple thing of God is
[1:58:02] love and look where they've taken that
[1:58:06] to where you've got men dressed in
[1:58:07] dresses with hair that's all the colors
[1:58:09] of their sick rainbow standing in the
[1:58:11] pulpit. That's where they've taken the
[1:58:13] love of God. church.
[1:58:15] I'm not saying don't love your neighbor,
[1:58:17] but they don't know what the love of God
[1:58:19] even looks like anymore.
[1:58:21] If you think that the majority have it
[1:58:23] right, open your eyes
[1:58:26] cuz wide is the path broad is the way
[1:58:29] that leads to destruction.
[1:58:32] As I mentioned, by the end of the
[1:58:33] seventh church age, Leodysa, Christ is
[1:58:36] outside the church. And church, I don't
[1:58:38] believe for a second that most of them
[1:58:39] intended it to happen that way.
[1:58:43] But they thought they could do it
[1:58:45] different. They thought they could do it
[1:58:46] better. They thought they could get more
[1:58:49] people in. And what did they do? They
[1:58:52] changed it into a disgrace.
[1:58:56] We look around today in Christianity.
[1:58:57] What we have is from that same spirit.
[1:59:02] And it started with Eve and the serpent.
[1:59:04] It's come all the way through. And it's
[1:59:06] produced a Christianity that doesn't
[1:59:08] reflect the life of Christ, but it
[1:59:10] reflects the leadership of a man of sin,
[1:59:14] of men of sin, if I could put it that
[1:59:16] way. What they have become, we'll get
[1:59:18] into this next service. They have become
[1:59:20] the synagogue of Satan.
[1:59:23] The synagogue of Satan. You say it can't
[1:59:26] happen to us. It can happen to us. It
[1:59:29] can happen to us. What happens? We lay
[1:59:31] down a line. We lay down a doctrine. We
[1:59:34] put up a wall. We say you can't be it if
[1:59:36] you do this or if you don't do that.
[1:59:39] Echo chambers.
[1:59:41] Doctrines preaching for doctrine. The
[1:59:44] teachings of men.
[1:59:46] And because everyone in the church
[1:59:48] agrees,
[1:59:49] it becomes the new rule. Come to Christ.
[1:59:54] Come to Christ.
[1:59:56] What do we have?
[1:59:58] Synagogues of Satan. We have the gospel
[2:00:00] of the Pentecostals. We have the gospel
[2:00:02] of the Baptists. We have the bos the
[2:00:05] gospel the bastardized gospel of the
[2:00:07] United Church and you got 30,000 others
[2:00:10] and they're all blasphemous names every
[2:00:13] single one of them. What is it? Remember
[2:00:15] the scripture talks about se in that day
[2:00:18] seven women will come to a man and say
[2:00:20] listen we just need your name.
[2:00:23] We just need you. We just need a portion
[2:00:25] of you. We'll take care of ourselves.
[2:00:26] We'll do everything else
[2:00:29] but just don't leave us out there in the
[2:00:30] cold. And that's the way the churches
[2:00:33] are today is they want Christ in name
[2:00:35] only. But they don't want his word. They
[2:00:36] don't want his banner. They don't want
[2:00:38] his love. They don't want his lordship.
[2:00:39] All they want is the word Christian. And
[2:00:42] they leave everything else behind. It's
[2:00:44] blasphemous names. It's harlots because
[2:00:47] Christ doesn't come in but says their
[2:00:49] fornication is with everybody else.
[2:00:51] Synagogues of Satan. This is heavy this
[2:00:53] morning. I know this. But I'm I'm trying
[2:00:56] to show you the simplicity of a little
[2:00:59] leaven and how far it goes if you give
[2:01:01] it enough time. You sisters that make
[2:01:04] bread, let's stand together. You sisters
[2:01:06] that bake bread, you look at what
[2:01:08] happens when you put that leaven in. You
[2:01:09] put it and you give it some warmth.
[2:01:12] It grows and it grows and it grows. Can
[2:01:15] you imagine if you left that there for
[2:01:16] 2,000 years? How big a loaf of bread
[2:01:19] would you have? It'd take over your
[2:01:20] house, wouldn't it?
[2:01:23] but it wouldn't resemble what you
[2:01:24] started with. And it's the same thing
[2:01:26] that's happened.
[2:01:28] You say, "Brother John, why are you
[2:01:30] preaching this way this morning?" I'm
[2:01:32] not preaching at you.
[2:01:35] But I'm saying it's real easy to get
[2:01:37] into an echo chamber, where our
[2:01:39] fellowship is only with those that agree
[2:01:41] with us,
[2:01:43] where we can't have our ideas
[2:01:46] challenged. You know the sign of true
[2:01:47] friendship?
[2:01:49] They'll tell you the truth.
[2:01:52] 100%
[2:01:54] they'll tell you the truth. A friend
[2:01:56] that'll tell you the truth is a real
[2:01:57] friend. And you know you've got a real
[2:01:59] friend when they'll disagree with you
[2:02:02] and you can walk away and come back
[2:02:03] together again and you're still okay
[2:02:05] with it. I have had bitter
[2:02:07] disagreements, strong disagreements
[2:02:10] with ministers in this message. And
[2:02:12] guess what? They'll still let me preach
[2:02:14] in their church. They'll still shake my
[2:02:17] hand. Why? Because they're real friends.
[2:02:20] real friends. That's what we need.
[2:02:23] People that'll tell us and
[2:02:27] slow down there. Let's take a look at
[2:02:29] this. Have you considered?
[2:02:33] Because otherwise, what do we come up
[2:02:34] with?
[2:02:36] An echo chamber. An echo chamber gospel.
[2:02:39] Amen. It's too easy to live a lifestyle
[2:02:41] in this. You know, we've got a lot of
[2:02:43] Christian lifestyle today. They live
[2:02:46] good lives, but Christ is not in it.
[2:02:49] It's Christlike, but it's not Christ.
[2:02:51] It's Bible based, but it's not Bible.
[2:02:55] It's surrendered, but not fully
[2:02:57] surrendered. It's whatever works,
[2:03:00] whatever makes life easier, inviting God
[2:03:04] in. Amen. I'm not here to force you into
[2:03:07] anything.
[2:03:09] But I'm here to preach the word every
[2:03:11] single service. Whether it hurts,
[2:03:15] whether it soothes and calms, or whether
[2:03:18] it raises our hackles. Amen.
[2:03:21] It's hard. I preached some hard sermons
[2:03:23] up here.
[2:03:25] But why?
[2:03:27] Cuz I want you to make it. And I want to
[2:03:29] break every single chain
[2:03:33] that binds us to our own thinking, our
[2:03:36] own traditions, to ministry,
[2:03:39] long-held ideas.
[2:03:42] I don't want anyone here missing on that
[2:03:44] wonderful morning. I want to look
[2:03:46] around. I want to say, "We made it.
[2:03:48] Every single one." I don't want a little
[2:03:50] levan
[2:03:53] to leaven the lump. Amen. God bless you
[2:03:56] this morning. Let's bow our heads.
[2:03:58] Heavenly Father,
[2:04:00] Lord, we've got a warning this morning,
[2:04:04] Lord. And I pray that you would take
[2:04:05] your word by your spirit this morning
[2:04:07] and run a filter through our lives,
[2:04:09] heavenly father.
[2:04:11] Lord, that you'd help us to see, Lord,
[2:04:13] where truth is,
[2:04:15] Lord, and where we're just sitting there
[2:04:17] yelling loudly so we can hear ourselves
[2:04:18] in an echo chamber. Lord, where we've
[2:04:21] surrounded ourselves with like-minded
[2:04:23] people, Lord, rather than the mind of
[2:04:25] Christ, Lord, where we're looking for
[2:04:28] affirmation rather than direction.
[2:04:31] Lord, I pray you help us not to get
[2:04:32] caught up in ministry or influence,
[2:04:36] ideas, popularity, following the crowd.
[2:04:40] Lord, I pray you give us a backbone this
[2:04:41] morning, Lord, to stand up on our own
[2:04:44] convictions by your word, Lord, and to
[2:04:46] let your spirit do the talking in our
[2:04:48] lives, Lord, that it would produce good
[2:04:49] fruit, Lord, that it would produce a
[2:04:51] life that's worthy of the gospel this
[2:04:53] morning. Lord, I pray you strengthen us
[2:04:55] for battle, Lord. I pray you keep our
[2:04:58] awareness up, Lord, that we'd have our
[2:05:01] guard up at all times, Lord, looking for
[2:05:03] the subtlety of the enemy that will come
[2:05:04] in and try and shape us and change us
[2:05:06] and get us offline.
[2:05:08] Lord, I pray you give us discernment,
[2:05:11] Lord, in faith to take you at your word
[2:05:14] this morning. Lord, be with your people.
[2:05:17] In Jesus Christ's name, we're praying
[2:05:19] it.
[2:05:20] Amen.
[2:05:24] This is always the hardest part after a
[2:05:26] hard service like that. So, you know
[2:05:28] what? We're going to sing the Hallelujah
[2:05:31] side.
[2:05:32] 4:25.
[2:05:34] Amen. Because in the end, can I preach
[2:05:37] for a moment?
[2:05:39] In the end, it's going to be worth it.
[2:05:43] But we're going to need molds broken,
[2:05:46] thoughts broken, ministries broken,
[2:05:49] churches broken, wills broken, ideas
[2:05:52] broken. But in the end, we're on the
[2:05:56] road to life. We're on the road to
[2:05:57] heaven. Amen. We're going to be on the
[2:05:59] hallelujah side. And I'll tell you right
[2:06:01] now, we don't always shout hallelujah
[2:06:03] when things are broken. Remember,
[2:06:06] everything that can be shaken will be
[2:06:08] shaken. And sometimes it's hard to have
[2:06:10] our lives shaken. But what is it? It's
[2:06:12] part of the refining process. And I'll
[2:06:14] tell you on that morning, Brother Bob,
[2:06:15] we're going to be screaming,
[2:06:16] "Hallelujah. It's going to be a
[2:06:18] wonderful time. It'll be worth it all."
[2:06:22] But boy, we've got some humbling to do
[2:06:24] day by day. We've got some surrendering
[2:06:26] to do day by day.
[2:06:28] Brother Jeremy Shriner shared something
[2:06:30] with some ministers. He says, "We've got
[2:06:31] to get back to praying." Brother Bram
[2:06:33] said, "We got to get back to praying to
[2:06:35] find out what God's program is and get
[2:06:38] with it." And he says, "Prayer is the
[2:06:40] greatest weapon given to man." Why?
[2:06:42] Because it puts us in alignment with
[2:06:44] God. Amen. So, let's sing this morning.
[2:06:46] Let's worship for a while. Let's say,
[2:06:48] "Praise the Lord if nothing else brother
[2:06:49] John's done this morning." And we can
[2:06:51] have some joy. Amen. Let's sing it.
[2:06:55] Oh, once a sinner far from Jesus. I was
[2:06:59] perishing with cold. But the blessed
[2:07:03] Savior heard me when I cried.
[2:07:07] Oh, then he threw his arm around me and
[2:07:10] he led me to his throne. And I'm living
[2:07:14] on the hallelujah side.
[2:07:19] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[2:07:22] hallelujah roll. Help me ring my
[2:07:26] Savior's praises far and wide.
[2:07:30] For I've opened up toward heaven all the
[2:07:34] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[2:07:38] the hallelujah side.
[2:07:42] Though the world may sweep around me
[2:07:45] with her dazzle and her dreams, yet I
[2:07:48] envy not her vanities and pride.
