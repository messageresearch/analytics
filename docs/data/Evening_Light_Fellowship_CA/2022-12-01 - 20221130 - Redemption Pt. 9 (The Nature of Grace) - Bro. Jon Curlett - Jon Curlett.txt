Ephesians chapter two amen good to be in the house of the Lord we have a smaller group here tonight I talked to brother Josh she says they're still not quite uh quite ready to come back to church yet so I said we continue praying for him I'm still not a hundred percent but I uh I told Brother Bob just because you have headaches that's that's a condition it's not sickness so we're here tonight and we're preaching amen just trusting the lord to bless amen as brother Bob point out brother brother Lowell can go to church with cancer and brother Ron Spencer can go to church with cancer then I should be able to get past a headache or two amen so trusting will be blessed this evening amen not because I'm here but because the Lord speaks amen Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where with he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ and by Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Amen you can have your seats to see me may the Lord bless the reading of his word and we're going to continue as you might imagine in our in our series on Redemption this evening and what I do love about this series is I could preach just about anything and say we're continuing on our Redemption Series so we may go to the left and the right here sometimes but I want to take a sermon title tonight of the nature of Grace amen as we're speaking on Redemption and maybe that's a bit of an odd title given we just spoke on the prevailing Lion and the fierceness and the focus of God and his unwavering you know dedication to bringing us to the the place that he put in the word that says what we are to be and what we're going to do in these different things but even in in that we've got to understand that the foundation for the Redemptive work is always Grace amen and so sometimes we look and we see that nature of God that is it doesn't let go and that's really the nature of Grace it's really the nature of Grace is it never lets go away men there's always more there than what you can do to it it always overcomes because it's a it's an overwhelming thing of God Amen is that nature of Grace but as I was studying this and I I felt that so often the the the the the thing that we struggle with is that we receive Grace one way and we give it in another amen and that's speaking as humans maybe not as Believers but certainly as as Believers I believe we struggle with this sometimes is that we receive Grace one way and when we give it we tend to give it maybe in a slightly different way or maybe more than a slightly different way than than we got it from God Amen but the thing I'm reminded as I said more than anything in this as we go through Redemption is that it's based on Grace it's based on Grace it's a Grace work that starts it and it's a Grace work that finishes it you know our kids just got uh their per their their report cards from school and sometimes the further you get into your walk with God you start to you start to get into a performance-based relationship with God and that's not what Grace is Grace is never Performance Based we don't get grades from God Amen it is a work of Grace and we'll get into it as we talk about Abraham and these different things but but where we stand in him is not because we perform well it's because of what he's done for us and that we are accepted in the Beloved him and so we don't get grades we don't get grades in our life you know what we get we get fruit amen we get fruit out of it and this is just that's it brother Jonathan but I believe that you get as much fruit as you want to get amen if you take in a lot of the word then it's going to push out a lot of the word if you take in a little bit of the word if you only drink a little bit then guess what you can only support so much fruit but the more of God you take in and the only one that limits that is you the more fruit that you can push out and still be a healthy believer and still maintain your your relationship with God and these different things amen but I sat down and and Sundays are actually the best time for me to study so I went home on Sunday night or Sunday afternoon and played some games with the family and then I went right back down started studying I have 50 pages of notes built up into this series at this point and I said where am I going to go from this and and the thing that jumped out it says if we don't settle Grace here very quickly then we're going to get off to the left or we're going to get off to the right because so many times that's where we we get into issues is that we we get past that initial moment of Grace where God Saves us and we see our failures and we see our faults and we see our sins and so we're very thankful and we're very appreciative and we're very conscious of Grace but after that we start to set expectations for ourselves and we stop looking at Grace and we started looking at performance like I said and we start grading ourselves against the word and we start to think that is why God blesses us or doesn't bless us or approves of us or doesn't approve us is because of our our ability to match up to the word or our failure to match up to the word and so what happens is we can either get to the point where we deserve Redemption because we're performing well or we think that we don't Reserve Redemption we don't deserve the things of God because we're not performing well amen we get into trouble if we think we deserve it and we get into trouble if we don't think we deserve it we get into trouble if we think we can add anything to it and then we get into trouble if we don't do anything at all and we sit there like a lump on a pickle now that sounds complicated doesn't it but it's not complicated the idea of Grace is that it doesn't have anything to do with you you can never deserve it Grace is unmerited favor with God and so it doesn't matter what you do that can never change Grace but what it does change like I said is your fruit it changes what God can do with you but it doesn't change who you are in his sight amen it's amazing because as we get further into our walk with Christ we start to say well I did this and I did that and so I don't deserve it and I don't deserve that and and he's not going to love me anymore and he's not willing to do this or do that and God's sitting there saying listen you are a sinner when I first saved you Grace didn't look at what you did then why do you think Grace is looking at it now we think that the grace that we that was there originally somehow disappears as soon as we accept Christ into our life as soon as we commit our life to him now it's about what we do and it's not that could not be further from the truth amen God has an expectation for our behavior and then God's going to deal with us as children he's going to discipline us and he's going to correct us and he's going to teach us and all these things but never let it think that your condition is going to keep you out of the presence of God in the sense of who you are and and the failures that we have amen we put this massive pressure on ourselves as Believers sometimes man I think the young people will face us more often as certainly as you're young I know I did and still do in many ways you know I I unfortunately or fortunately I've had to change in my life in the sense that I went from a lay member now coming into the ministry and guess what you got to have a lot of Grace for yourself in the ministry you've got to have a lot of Grace for yourself because you're going to make failures and you're going to have faults and you're going to grow and your growth is very public and your failures are equally public and so you've got to recognize that God has Grace and even if the people sometimes don't God has Grace and they'll pull you through these different things amen but guess what we're all in condemned bodies aren't we every single one of us and so you can have the Holy Ghost inside of you and you can be you can have the new birth and you can be baptized and you can have a heart that's leaned towards God but you're still subject to tiredness you're still subject to frustration you're still subject to weariness you're still subject to the emotions that are in this body you're still subject to having a bad day so don't let that ever stop you from coming into his presence amen amen don't ever stop and say we're not good enough for because we've disappointed him I can't do this or he won't do that because that's never going to be true so I want to start with this one quote from Brother Branham that'll kind of set the tone for this because if we can we can recognize and accept what he says here then Satan will never be able to hold that on you when you make a mistake brother Brown says this he says now God said take a red heifer now did you ever notice scientifically you take something real red and look through red at red and it looks wife the white rather did you ever know that red through red looks white now I don't have a red filter here but what he's saying is that if I write something on this board if I if I took this red here and I put a red filter over top of that you wouldn't even see those letters it disappears because red blanks out red and all you can see is the clear the clarity the purity of the board that's there he says so God knowing that man was a sinner by Nature knowing that he was wrong to begin with he made a preparation of the shed blood and God looking through the blood of the Lord Jesus sees you a red sinner white as snow he says you have no more sin so I want to say this God sees you in a way that you can't ever see yourself he sees you in a special way and even though God is omnipotent he's omnipresent he's all-powerful he's all these things he cannot see your sin if you're under the blood of Jesus Christ it's a it's a paradox that the all-powerful God cannot see your sin and as we spoke last service or the service before it's not your sin isn't even attached to you it's separated from you and he still can't see it and he still can't attach it to you amen he says you have no more sin and when God looks through the blood of Christ no matter what you've done how much sin you've committed see we've got big black sins and then we've got little white sins he says no no no matter how much sin you've committed what you've done if the blood of Christ has been applied to your heart God sees you perfect perfect as if what you never did it in the first place we've read that before and we'll get into a deeper revelation of that in the next few services but I remember as a young man and shortly after I got baptized and when I was a young man um not many people knew this of course the kids that maybe saw me at school knew this I like country music I like certain types of rock and roll and these different things and when I went and I gave my heart to the Lord and I got baptized guess what that didn't take away those desires because I didn't have the new birth what I had done was given my heart to the Lord I had committed my life to him I had said I wanted to serve him but that is not the new birth I had repented completely I have been baptized completely but I had not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so I had uh you know I came back and I was doing really well and then I fell back to something and it happened multiple times and there was a time where I got down by my bed this is a true story I'm telling you exactly as it happened I got down by my bed this is not the proverbial getting down by your bed I got down and I was kneeling by my bed and I was sitting there and I was just praying out and I was crying to God I was crying out I wasn't sitting in a chair I wasn't leaning back I was on my knees crying before God because I was so heartbroken I was so heartbroken because I'd failed him yet again I had a besetting sin there I had something that my flesh liked that I knew I shouldn't like but yet I kept going back to it from time to time and I was sitting there and I was crying out to God and I said God I'm so sorry I'm sick and tired of this and I was crying tears coming down my face and eventually what happened was at that time God broke through and he showed me that my failures will never keep me out of his presence that what when I put my life under the blood of Christ it covered me from the beginning to the end and that never changes that never changes the blood is there and it covers me forever until he does what gives me the fullness of my Redemption which is a new body and I go to be in his presence amen then we don't need the blood anymore because we're in his presence and we're accepted in the Beloved amen but what I realize that everything I do is already under the blood everything is under the blood and as long as what I have a repentant heart I can always come back in his presence my sin won't keep me out of his presence I'll keep me out of his presence because if I don't repent if I don't realize there's mercy and Grace there I can't go back in his presence he is always willing to receive me back into his presence if I come with the right attitude and spirit and I was and guess what it was that time that moment that exact moment that God gave me the Holy Ghost and I got delivered and so remember last Source we we sang that song where it said you know that a man was he could not conquer uh passion lust and pride that's what happened to me there as I conquered that that's what happened there as I conquered that because he took the desire out now it's not that I've never failed again in my life the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you never fail the holy ghost means you're sealed to the end and the blood covers you so that he doesn't seal your failures if anybody deals with you now as a son and a daughter of God Amen and what that the miracle aspect of the blood is that it covers the sin but it lets him see the need so he can address the need in your life without seeing the sin that tends to follow the the what we would call a fault he sees as a need there's no sin attached to it and so what's he doing is he's restoring we're in a Redemptive work he's restoring his Masterpiece which is what the bride that's his that's his Masterpiece in this age is going to be the bride so the fact that you have flaws and cracks and failures does not bother him because he's in a restoring work so he can see your faults without seeing your sins that's the amazing thing about the blood of Christ amen so that he can continue to work on me without attributing sin into my life amen and so from that moment on I haven't struggled with my faults and failures not struggle with them meaning I didn't have them but I haven't struggled to go back into the presence of God and seek forgiveness when I do mess up and I do mess up often and regularly amen but it's not my opinion that now keeps me out I remember there's a brother back in one of the churches that I used to be in and and he had never gotten the revelation of justification justification means you didn't do it it's not attributed to you and he went and it's a shame perhaps that he had never heard justification preached in the message and he went out and he heard a nominal Minister preach on justification he came to one of the deacons he said listen to this this is amazing the brother said yeah that's the first work of Grace he says I've never heard this before and he went out and that's what he followed for the rest of his days and he's still alive today and that's as far as he got but he had never gotten to the point and his conscience had bothered him all of his life because he'd never gotten to the place where he recognized that under the blood God can't even see your sins and so he was never free he was never free from his own failures and his own consciences and I know people today that have gotten to that place that got to the place where all they could see was their own failures their inability to live the life that was in the word and so they what they stopped right there they couldn't get under the blood they couldn't recognize the effect of the blood and today they're right where they always were unable to live it and so they're sitting miserable outside of the presence of God Amen let's go back to our opening scripture here and start to maybe open this up a little bit Ephesians 2 verse 1 says and you had the quick and who are dead in trespasses and sins we preached on this way back when we did the Joshua and Ephesians series amen but I want you to realize that every one of us were dead in trespasses and sin that's not for the the unbeliever that's outside of the message that's not the the person that was raised outside of a good Christian home this is every single one of us we're dead in trespassing sin the moment we were born we were dead and trespassing sin and our our intellectual ability to nod our head to what was being said behind the pulpit did not make us any less it dead in our trespasses and sins amen the Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God he says wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience again we've covered this before but our natural inclination is Disobedience to the word of God there is nothing in US Naturally Speaking that wants to do what the word of God says so he says every one of us are subject to the power of the air the Prince of Darkness and we are by Nature the children of Wrath it says fulfilling sorry yes among whom also we had all our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others amen so this is a spirit of Disobedience to the word of God and that spirit is a spirit that is proud because it cannot humble itself to the word of God and because it cannot humble itself to the spirit of God to the word of God it will always be proud and arrogant towards the word of God Amen it will always be about itself and it will never humble itself and therefore it can never act in Godly love so it is always a selfish motive that's going to drive a child of Disobedience it's always about me me me amen he says what we had our conversation that means our way of life our natural way is as a child of God's Wrath under the Judgment of God that's the way we naturally are until we get the Holy Ghost but I love verse 4 because it says but God who is rich in Mercy rich rich not just a little bit you don't you ever go to somebody's house and they only have a little bit of something what do they do they just give everyone a little bit God doesn't God doesn't have just a little bit of Mercy he's rich in Mercy he's rich in Mercy amen he wants to forgive you more than you want to be forgiven let me put it that way for with his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins I love that word even because that would mean although it's not typical or reasonable probably doesn't make sense but even because even in that condition when we were dead in sins he had quickened us he's made us alive together with Christ and it says by Grace ye are saved now I want to take this and I want there's a timeline of Grace that's built into this scripture here and I want to walk through this because I want to get this home it's something that the Lord's been dealing with me on personally and so I thought I'd bring it to the church as we did this so the timeline of Grace if we look at this is that we were first children of Wrath deserving of death right if you're under God's judgment then death is the thing that you deserve he says then what Grace is applied to us as a second stage and then because that Grace is applied we become the children of God we're accepted in the Beloved okay so if I were to to change this maybe into modern words I would say that we start out that the person is wrong they're deserving death still Grace is applied and they become a child of God but now that's how we receive Grace but I want to talk about how we give Grace because what often happens is that we reverse this around and so we say that someone is a child of God and we put a conditional requirement on our Grace if they're a child of God then we'll show them Grace if we believe then to be a child of God we'll show them Grace then the person does something wrong they're deserving of a penalty or judgment and and then Grace is applied but that's not Grace that's not Grace if we put a condition on who the person is before we do the right thing to them then that is not Grace it's far from it amen see so often what happens and I've talked to my wife about this and a couple others throughout the last week or so as God was dealing with with me on this so often what we have is we have a close friend close friends people we have good relationships with people we've known a long time and as we spend time with those people they build up a bank of Goodwill in our lives okay so let me pick brother Gerald since he's the oldest one amongst us brother Gerald could walk up to me and slap me across the face and I would forgive him you know why because brother Gerald has gotten to the place where he's done so much good in my life that it would take more than a slap in the face to ever take him out of my life or cause me to push him away but that's not Grace that's me taking all the value that brother Gerald has added to my life I'm treating it like I'm a banker now and he's built up a massive deposit of good things into my life and that what he does he comes in and with that one slap he says I'm going to take a withdrawal today so I say you've got plenty in the bank brother take your withdrawal and we forgive and we forget and we move on and nothing changes in our relationship right that's not Grace That's Good Will based on how much that person has done for me amen we're gracious and we forgive and forget but we're not actually being gracious we're just saying the value you put into my life is greater than the value that you're pulling out now in terms of what you're requiring of me and my Christian character amen but that's not the way it works Romans 4 says for If Abraham was justified by works he hath whereup to Glory but not before God what is saying that Abraham wasn't deemed that if Abraham was deemed not guilty or righteous because of his Good Deeds the neighborhood would have a reason to boast it says for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness so Abraham's faith in God is what God accepted and credited to Abraham's account even as if he had done the right thing all his life but we know that's not the case with Abraham Abraham did more wrong than right in his life in terms of what the scripture documents about his life he kept leaving the promised land he kept getting in trouble with with the different Kings and whatnot his wife kept getting taken away from him because he kept lying about her Abraham and his life did more wrong than right in terms of the major decisions of his life but it says God credited it to his account because he believed the promise nonetheless okay so Abraham he says did not deserve this by works but it was his faith that God said gave him credit and God deemed that as righteous he says now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt so this is the key to Grace that what it can't be earned so if somebody earns something from you then you can't be giving them Grace back that's not Grace that's just good will that's just you being a nice person that's just you saying that yes you've done enough to me that I'll look past this little thing amen guess what my point in this is if you try to earn Grace God can't give it to you if you try and go to God and say now I'm worthy of your grace he'll say I can't I don't have any Grace to give you because you're earning it so everything you've done I'll give you based on what you've earned but I can't give you Grace and guess what Grace is so much more than what I could ever earn with my Works choose Grace every single time amen now contrast that to giving Grace because when someone has done you all these good things will quickly forgive and forget because they've earned it and then we think we're being gracious we are being christ-like because he said turn the cheek you know do these things look back that I read in in Proverbs where I was talking about a wise man he says he covers Mischief he takes an insult okay you can be a Christian and do that but don't think you're being gracious you're just turning the other cheek so to speak if we go back it says but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justified the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described this blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works this is what Grace is church because the person is made righteous without being righteous amen purely because they have believed God and expressed their faith in their decisions and David said blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin so in other words blessed is the person that God won't ever credit sin to their account even though they've done things wrong that's what Grace is is when you've done wrong they won't credit it to your account they're not even looking at accounts because if they looked at the accounts they realized there was nothing there to draw on most of the time so they just say I'm not even going to look at the account I'm just going to respond the way you need to be responded to as Christ would amen we see that with Abraham like I said you see his major decisions he made a lot of bad Majors decisions and sometimes his decisions weren't bad is that they were incomplete incomplete we don't go all the way that's what he did remember God said pull him out leave your family what'd he do he took his father and he took lot and then his father died so that held him back for a few years and then he took lot and that held him back and he got into fights and then lot ended up going into a place he shouldn't have been in losing his wife getting into an incestuous relationship with his daughters so he messed up lot's life probably by bringing them along and then taking him to a place of great Temptation then finally he gets out of there and he starts going into the different lands and these different things Abraham's actions were not particularly great but in the end he believed God and that's what God accounted to him brother Brown puts it this way he says God's children unconditionally you don't deserve your healing tonight there's not a one of us in here deserves to even hear the gospel wow there's not a one of you deserves the grace of Jesus Christ none of us we're all together but God by Grace has did it anyhow that's right there's none of you deserve your healing every one of you ought to die me too all of us we're not deserving to live on the earth that's right we're not even deserving to look at God's creation but but God has promised us and he cannot lie he swore that he would do it healing belongs to us amen salvation belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven belongs to us now we are the sons of God now we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and there's nothing can harm us he says the same God was watching Abraham in his mistake the same God was watching brother Jonathan in his mistakes God made Abraham pay for it don't you think he got by with it but God didn't cast Abraham out he just made Abraham repent for it he says and you think you're not worthy to be healed tonight now the reason I'm saying this is because I know what you're thinking someone says well I'm not worthy I guess maybe I've done this get that out of your mind sure you're not and you'll never be but Jesus is and he's the one who gave it to you he's the one who paid the price whosoever will let him come and drink freely from The Fountains of the Water of Life it was so perfect that we sang on what there is a what a well there is a spring that never runs dry he says God has made an unconditional Covenant he swore by the death of Jesus Christ he sent the Holy Ghost back upon you to be a confirmation that the Covenant is made with you brother I don't want the devil to rob you out of that he said Jehovah Jireh says now he's making the abrahamic Covenant and the abrahamic Covenant according to Genesis the 12th chapter it was given unconditionally therefore it's Eternal because it's unconditional because if you look in contract law there are clauses that say if you do this then this contract is null and void we'll do this and you'll do that but if you don't do that then we don't have to do this but brother I'm saying because God said I'm going to do it and it was not conditional on you it is eternal because God's the only one that's got to do anything so it's Eternal because he is eternal amen not if you will I will he said I have I've already done it not I will done it do it I have done it he says oh that base is Faith see God is determined to save man if he makes a covenant if you will I will he'd break it he's talking about man would another one you will I will he broke it and that's what happened with the law with Adam and Eve all of us every time he says I'll do it if you do it we end up not doing it and that doesn't allow him to do it so he says I got to get past this so I'm going to make a an oath by myself man can't keep his Covenant so God Saves Man by his grace under a covenant that's unconditional an unconditional Covenant oh my never-ending that was all of it three Perfect Adam Noah and Abraham now that's the reason we are Abraham's children that Covenant can never end because it's unconditional listen to this now it isn't because you do something it's because God did past tense God did something not because you chose God God chose you and he says can you believe it amen we're here because we believe it this morning amen we're here because we have believed it and we believe that he's more than able to do what he's promised he was going to do amen listen but I say all this because we look at this and we see the great grace for us we see the great grace for us we we identify ourselves in here your amens as we said that identifies that you've been you you've received that Grace amen but then what happens when God forbids somebody does something to us and we put them outside of that Grace and what do we say Well they're not really saved they don't really have the Holy Ghost they haven't had a new birth they don't act the way I want to act they keep doing this they keep doing that and what do we do is we put conditions on what we're going to do when we respond to them amen and so what happens in these situations is there is no Grace there and we say the person's wrong and therefore death is applied that's what happens so often because what happens in catch this is we'll take that person and we'll say they're not a part of the body of Christ and we'll we'll pull Grace out of the equation and we'll hand them over to judgment that's not the way it works because even while we were yet sinners God died for us right the grace was applied before we were ever in a condition to what deserve it amen but what happens is we dehumanize and we de-christianize and we pull them out we spiritualize their condition so that what it can justifies to treat them in a way that maybe we wouldn't treat a True Believer in our heads amen now the first time it's easy now to do it the first time you forgive but let someone keep working on you for a while we're going to get to what the scripture says about that but let someone keep doing it 70 times seven times in a day and then see if maybe Grace is still sitting in this equation or if we jump to just there wrong and therefore they're under judgment that's the human nature is to do this is to take Grace completely outside of it amen now I know this is direct and it's direct because God's been very direct with me about this and I believe that the church needs to hear this because if he's dealing with one chances are he can deal with all of us if nothing else is a warning because we're all in the same bodies amen we still deal with these sorts of things because Satan loves to drive wedges in he loves to drive wedges in remember if he can break up the unity of a group of Believers then he's got us on the run the Sheep get scattered and all of a sudden he can pick us off one by one and where does he start he starts with our attitude if he can get your attitude wrong remember brother Brown said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass in your life guess what the wrong mental attitude towards any believer or promise of God will take it right out of your life as well so if he can get your attitude wrong he's got you whipped every single time so he loves to drive that wedge in and he starts with an attitude problem amen listen brother Bob says Grace is what God did for me works is what I do for God he says now they'll make a Doctrine out of it they think that works is what wins your marriage he says if it is it isn't a free gift Grace is what God did for you by Grace you're saved and works is what you do in appreciation of the grace that he showed to you and if you love him you like to do the works of the Lord certainly because then you love him amen now watch the attitude now because this is what it looks like in real life and I've read this quote many years ago I know but let's listen to it again tonight because here's the attitude of Grace a lot of people say now you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours yeah you do something for me and I'll do something for you that's not Grace now watch what Grace is Grace is if your back is itching I'll scratch it anyhow whether you scratch mine or not you can slap me on the face and say my back needs scratching I'll scratch it see that's it do something I don't believe in works I believe that works is Love Now catch this next line he says works is the manifestation that Grace has taken place I'm going to read it again works is the manifestation that Grace has taken place in other words how you act shows whether or not you've received Grace in the first place I don't live true to my wife because I believe she divorced me if I didn't I lived true to her because I love her so we see then that Grace is for what the person that has done nothing to earn a nice a good a soft response that has no banked value in your life that has no relationship to call on that's what Grace is for Grace is for the one that has nothing deserving in your life and yet you give the right response regardless amen as we said before Grace's unmerited favor and because it is undeserving it has to be Limitless yeah because it's undeserving it has to be Limitless that's what Christ was it was full of grace and truth we're going to read in a little bit amen he was full of grace you have to have that Grace to have the nature of God inside of you amen that doesn't mean we don't hold each other accountable amen that doesn't mean we let people run roughshod over us that doesn't mean that the word standard goes out the door and Grace means that you never you never say anything to anybody about anything no no no no no but how you say it is going to determine whether Grace comes forward and if your love is going to be that of Christ then there's going to be a difference in the way you approach it amen but we've got an obligation I've I've been reading through some of the things Paul said about church order and I'll tell you he was pretty rough when it came to church order Paul didn't play any games when it came to church order he says if you got an issue with somebody you go to him you see somebody doing something they ought to be doing you go to them he says and if they don't listen to you take another one if they don't listen to you then you take them before the church and if they don't listen to the church and kick them out that's pretty scary stuff remember when ananias and Sapphira conspired they said that whatever we sell this land for the prophet will give to the church then they came in and they held some back and what did Peter say why did you desire to why did you conspire to deceive the Holy Ghost and they both died right there it was it was scary in Paul's day he was talking about you know that young man that took his father's wife who and he said kick him out of the church kick him out of the church he says for what the the destruction of his body and for the saving of his soul and then he comes back in second Corinthians and he says oh I just I I did that in tears I didn't want to do it but you had to do it you had to do it for his sake but now go back and restore him go back and restore him you know what sounded so harsh but they said no go back and restore him he's learned his lesson so come back and bring him back in if he'll come in again you know but it was it was it was still harsh in those times and we we had to hold each other accountable in those times and I think we've lost a bit of that these days because we're too kind sometimes there we're too forgiving and what we end up doing is we let people go down a path that if we were maybe a little quicker in love to help them they wouldn't go down as far and they wouldn't get into such trouble as they do sometimes amen amen the bride is here as long as the bride is here there's Mercy there's blood on the mercy seat and so I believe that our every opportunity should be to offer mercy and Grace amen amen as long as we're here hey even in the end the end the Book of Revelation says the the spirit and the bride say one thing come she's always beckoning she's always trying to draw people in to the love of Christ amen let's go back to Romans 4. verse 6 it says and he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace how in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus remember we just read that works is the manifestation that Grace has taken places taken place so if we've receive the exceeding Riches of his grace what are our works to him and to others ought to look like amen I want to stop there because it and talk about that bit it says the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us because we see that in Christ time and time again regardless of his condition listen remember that they brought it to him the woman caught in the very Act of adultery the very act so there was no question at all that she was guilty remember and Jesus he gets down he Stoops and he writes in the dirt and from the oldest to the youngest they all left after they read what he wrote I'm really curious to know what he wrote there but after it was all done said and done we have a guilty adulterous woman there and we have Jesus Christ standing there and he says woman where are thine accusers she says there are none and he said what neither do I accuse thee go and sin no more amen he knew she was guilty but he also knew the word and the word said you had to have two or three witnesses to judge anyone so he wasn't enough and so he went back what with the kindest thing he could and said the word allows me to let you go I'm Gonna Let You Go don't do it again Dan what does he do he's on the cross he's on the cross he's an absolutely excruciating Agony and pain and suffering he's about to die he's nailed between two thieves one of them's giving him a hard time and the other one is saying Lord remember me when you're in paradise and what is he says he says remember you when you when you get your kingdom he says this day you'll be with me in Paradise that man was guilty listen he wasn't just guilty once you don't kill a thief because he steals once you kill a thief because he steals and he steals and he steals and he steals he never learns his lesson that's why they end up on a cross this was a thief of all thieves And yet when he showed the right attitude when he asked for forgiveness and he was kind to Christ Christ came back he says you'll have eternal life because of what you've done here amen that kindness is a the Hallmark of Christ amen I want to read a scripture here and if there's anything that you take out of this service it's this next quote it's the most amazing thing I think and if you've ever received Grace it'll really resonate with you brother Brown says that's the reason our sins today we'd everyone be condemned but God can't take us because if he does he hurts Christ we are part of him we are the bride don't you see so there it is now catch this he says Grace holds us in our mistakes until we can see better Grace holds us in our mistakes it protects us until we can see better he says I'm so thankful for that amen isn't that just the way it is I would probably maybe expect the older ones to know this more than the younger ones at this point but I remember as a young man and and so full of myself in so many ways and yet in all of my Folly and all of my naivety and all of my silliness and all of my high opinions and pride yet God didn't just come along and just whacked me across the head and say you stupid man he didn't he didn't he let me bumble along in my foolishness and tell him one day the grace pulled the scales off my eyes and I saw that there was so much more to be had than what I had there was so much more growth to be had there was so much more of God there was so much more of the word there was so much more of the Holy Spirit there was so much more Victory and overcoming and what did it do it humbled me so that he could actually start to work through me and use me but it was Grace that held me until I could see better as a young husband as a young father I wasn't raised with a good example in my home so I didn't know how to be a good dad I didn't know how to be a good father and what was it Grace held me until God could open my eyes and say you need to do better at this you need to do a whole lot more than you're doing right now bucko and it was Grace that opened my eyes it was Grace that held me and then in his time and in his place he opened my eyes gently so I could see it and I could receive what he had waiting for me so that I could grow in Christ it was Grace that held me through it amen what a wonderful thing it is to have Grace Hold Us until Grace opens our eyes to what he wants to do in our lives amen so that we can look past our Human Condition remember the laodicean condition is that they think they're rich increased with Goods have needed nothing and it's not just physical it's a religious spirit we're talking about a religious spirit and he says you can't see that you are miserable wretched blind naked and I'm speaking to myself and say there was early times and there are still times no doubt because if you're blind you don't know what you don't know you can't see what you can't see because you can't see and he's saying God's grace holds you and the blood of Christ covers you so that he doesn't look at your foolishness and your sin until the time is ready for him to bring that son or daughter up into another step into another plane into another level because he needs to use you now he needs to move you to another level so that you can have an effect in the local body so you can have the right effect in your family so you can have the right effect in your co-workers but as Grace that holds us there amen and then as soon as our eyes are open what do we do we say how did anion not see this before what held me back Foolish Pride usually Foolish Pride but his grace held me until he could open my eyes amen Grace holds us in our mistakes until we can see better Romans 4 8 says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not by works not of Works lest any man should boast so listen works is never a reason to boast is it if where we are where we are by Grace every single time then why are we boasting about what we've done for him it has no place remember Timothy warned us in the last time so what will come boasters remember proud that's what he would we would be dealing with in the last stage me me me me me I I I I I that has no place in the life of a Believer no place the works of William Branham and he ever all he ever did was he pointed the Christ every single time I can't do it I couldn't do it if I if I was left of my own thing the branhams they're alcoholics and they're they're this and they're that they're losers guess what branhams were losers half the curlets are losers too losers that's what we be without the grace of God Amen and that Prophet comes out of it and he says I could I didn't even have friends back then didn't even have friends he says and now I gotta run and hide away because there's so many people want to be my friend not because of him because of what God did through him amen verse 10 says it beautifully he says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so even the fact that you're walking the way you walk today is his grace and he's the one that ordained it you think I chose it no no no no man can come to God except God draw him first and they says you are created by his workmanship not your own you can't fashion yourself the statue the the Masterpiece can't carve itself out it has to be carved out by somebody else so we start to close I want to take us to John 1 verse 12. says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the Glorious of the only begotten of the father full of what Truth full of grace and truth amen now John's a special man amongst the four gospel writers because he's the only Prophet amongst them all and so John looks at things through an Eagle View he sees it he doesn't just see it from a little bit higher but he sees it from eternity to Eternity he starts his gospel with in the beginning was the word and he brings it all the way down to his time and then he pushes all the way past it even amen but he wrote insights that the rest of the disciples never grasped because he had a prophetic eye he had a prophetic Ministry so he wrote prophetically he could see things in a way that other people weren't and his description of Christ is that he was full of two things Grace and Truth grace and truth and that's a really amazing thing to me today because people that have the truth or believe they have the truth are rarely gracious and you only have to spend three minutes on social media to figure that out amen very few people have the real truth and the wisdom to share it properly to get it across so that somebody can receive it without beating them between the eyes or punching them over the head or something like that amen people are so bound and determined to be right today in their positions in their beliefs that it turns them into argumentative devils that's what we have today argumentative devils and it's it's in the workplace it's in the message it's in the church it's in families and it rips people apart it rips people apart it's it's amazing I read a scripture in Proverbs and in my devotions a week ago and it stuck with me because it relates so often to that issue of of having truth but lacking Grace and I'm mostly absent from those social medias most of you know I have accounts on a couple of them and I'm on there mainly to see what my family does and share my pictures I don't engage I don't really write things that don't do anything on there but when I read this scripture in Proverbs I said this is something to myself to remember when you're on social media and I shared it with my wife as well but it says this in Proverbs 3 verse 30 it says strive not with a man without cause if he have done thee no harm the Amplified says do not quarrel with a man without cause if he has done you no harm can I phrase it in maybe even in a better way don't fight with somebody that hasn't done anything to you personally so don't get sucked into somebody else's problems don't get sucked into somebody else's politics don't get sucked into somebody else's passions don't get sucked into other people's jihads you know what a Jihad is it's a holy war and it is when a person spiritualizes their problem because they won't recognize the problem lies within not without and so they come into a place of spirituality and they start to draw other people into it to try and protect themselves rather than deal with the issue jihads I've seen it in message Believers time and time and time again on social media it never works and people get sucked into it and it drags them down into it amen don't get sucked into other people's habits don't get sucked into other people's pain don't get sucked into other people's history and don't get sucked in to other people's issues because what you're fighting a battle with somebody that hasn't done anything with you and here's the other thing you never know what the other side is saying or doing all you're going by is one side of the issue and another place in Proverbs it says a man is a fool who judges and only hears one side and that's what social media is and guess what everything on social media today the algorithms are are designed such as to do what provide confirmation bias you know what confirmation buy says confirmation bias is when you only read things that agree with your personal opinion or belief and everything there as soon as you like one thing it goes to look for other things that match that and keeps feeding it to you feeding it to you and you think because of the abundance of information you're receiving that is suddenly right it's not right it's a self-fulfilling prophecy when you like the first thing then it it decided it was going to give you all the rest of the things and so you continue in it and you're convinced of it it'll never give you a dissenting opinion it's not meant to because social media thrives on what controversy if everybody on there was being lovey-dovey then it would fold in a week because there's only four people that are lovey-dovey on there instead of the billions that are using it worldwide amen if we truly believe that what we have is the church is the truth our attitude will be way different than what we're seeing on social media these days that's not that say that people aren't going to get offended in Matthew 24 Jesus said very clearly they're going to be offended and they're going to what betray you who can betray you there's only one people one set of people can betray you and that's those that are close to you in the first place isn't it family friends church members brother Joe let's talk about a judiciarian's pretended Brothers even those are the ones that are going to turn in the end is because they're offended because we stay with the word of God amen amen but let them be offended because we stayed with the word of God not because we preached it or we said it or did it in a way that was what mean harsh judgmental off-putting listen it's uncomfortable to be exposed under the light of the word and if you're living one way and the word says that's wrong then that's hard for somebody to do but if they can see that you mean it well then they'll maybe have a chance to accept it Proverbs 19 19 says this a brother offended is harder this is the Amplified now a brother offended is harder to win over than a fortified City and contentions that are separating families are like the bars of a castle now talking about our attitudes brother Brown says this think of it love and grace are sisters twin sisters you can't have Grace without having love that's why I said remember earlier I said that if we're under our natural inclinations we're under the the nature of the children of Wrath you can never act in God's love because you have to have Grace to have God's love and you have to have God's love to have Grace he says they're they're one and the same so once you receive God's grace if you're ever going to give it out you'll have to have the same Godly love that gave you the grace in the first place he says before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't wow you gotta love someone before you can show them Grace see so love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters that's all love and grace we can't see one without the other God so loved the world that's the love gave His only begotten son that's the grace he shed his grace and brought it in our hearts through the Holy Ghost see there's just nothing you can do without working one with the other the Grace Grace of God is what saves us so I read that to say this let us not say that our attitude is what offended somebody our approach is what offended somebody amen listen they're going to get offended at the word that's okay but let our not our conscience be triggered if our conscience is triggered let's make that right and then if our attitude if our approach was wrong even if our words were technically correct if our approach was wrong let us approach and say I'm sorry my Approach was wrong and I didn't help the situation when I did that amen listen people make accusations all the time the fact that there's an accusation out there doesn't make it true but when an accusation is made check your conscience and say is there any truth to it and if there is then go make the part that's wrong right amen amen John 1 says John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spoke he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received and Grace for Grace now I read that and I said what in the world does that mean uh Grace for grace and I looked in the amplifier and it's the most beautiful scripture it says for out of his abundance we have all had a share and we were all supplied with one Grace after another spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing and even favor upon favor and gift heaped upon gift amen haven't we received that can't you say that in one day we receive this sort of a Grace every day amen that he gives us good things and good things and mercy and Grace and gift after gift and favor after favor he's always working to lift us up up even when we're doing our best sometimes to go down down amen his Mercy his grace is just there continually continually renewing us washing us bringing us back into his presence reaching out drawing Us close wooing us closer even when we don't deserve it day after day his grace is there Grace is not a one-time event when you come in and you finally give your life to God and you resp and you realize what he's done for you but it's a it's a daily thing it's a lifetime thing where his grace is always there to work in our lives amen the fact that we have a sound mind today that's his grace the fact that we have eyes to see and ears to hear that's Grace the fact that we have eyes to see that we're not perfect is Grace that we would desire to have more of him and less of us that's Grace in our lives today amen that we want to move further than where we're at that we're not satisfied with who we are that we're not satisfied with what we are in the word but that we're looking to those promises and saying I want more of that and less of everything else in the cosmos that's Grace this evening every day the fact that you can keep pushing towards the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus is Grace because he put that inside of you to do it in the first place amen so if we've received it can we do what Matthew 10 says freely you have received freely give brother Brown would say this he says it's beyond any of our senses to comprehend what this means that we tonight are now seated in Christ every blessing that he died for is ours right now we have it oh God help us to have faith tonight to use your faith that you said it was ours and let us claim it tonight Lord every god-given privilege that we have for you have bought us and called us by Grace washed Us in the blood of thy son the Lord Jesus and has cleansed us up filled us with the Holy Spirit set us in Christ Jesus here tonight to claim anything any Redemptive blessing and our enemy tonight is just a bluff for Christ robbed him of everything he was at Calvary when he stripped him of everything every Power that he ever had for man was reconciled to God at that time through the blood of Jesus Christ when he fully paid the price and the full Supreme offering was made and God was pleased with it and tonight we're resurrected in him how we thank thee for this knowing this that no matter what comes or goes we're in him no matter what comes or goes we're in him those who he has Justified he has already glorified and the father in his own faith believing that we'll hold to our Redemptive blessings and the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ foresees us Yonder in eternity glorify together with him with glorified Bodies free from sickness free from death and to live with him as his dear beloved children through all ceaseless ages and Aeons of time to come that's Grace that's Grace to receive that the very Faith you have to claim it is Grace tonight the very Faith you had to claim your salvation was his grace in the first place brother Branham is speaking in this next quote of being fully persuaded talk about Abraham being fully persuaded of the promises of God he says it makes you act funny your decisions are odd to the world but it's a Believer no matter how strange it seems the Bible said that he was fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he said he would do that ought what to believe that God was able to perform it that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon God is able to keep every word that he said he'd do I don't care what the denominations say words days of Miracles has passed all this is telepathy and all this fortune telling it doesn't matter to me what they say I still believe if that gun is zero to the Target it'll Hit the Target and I believe if a Believer is zeroed with the word of God it'll hit the same thing if the word of God ever promised it it'll do it again I'm fully persuaded of that that when we see we're in this age when it's supposed to be here it's supposed to be here these things he says are supposed to take place that's the reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that Pride that'll take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace God promised it I don't care how much science and how many astronauts they signed up and everything else how many million miles they can see I don't care nothing about that there is a Heaven There is a literal Jesus Christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth God said so that's what Believers believe I want to close with this one last quote brother Brown says you're going to the wedding in the sky can you say with me you're going to the wedding in the sky and you are wearing the wedding band a predestinated before you could ever choose unmerited you didn't earn it Grace a wedding band of Grace a merited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there and put your name on a book amen God bless you let's stand this evening amen we're not standing because I choose to stand you're not standing because you choose to stand you're standing because he chose you before you could ever choose he saw you before you could ever see he put life into you before you could ever breathe and he said I'm going to take a bride out of this out of all this I'm going to take a bride and brother Bram says he put the predestinated unmerited ring of Grace on your finger the unmerited wedding band of Grace you couldn't do it on your own so stop trying to do it on your own do what he wants you to do surrender to him relax don't relax with Satan relax with God let him do what he's going to do sometimes we get so worked up like I said we're so Performance Based today was a net positive today was a negative I did more good than bad and what happens is we push the grace of God completely out of our life sometimes it's our failures that allow us to draw closer to God than we would if we just kept motoring along and everything was good and hunky-dory and we never did a thing wrong it draws us back into his presence it lets us know that we need to stay close to him every day not because we're so weak and pathetic and whatnot but because in his presence that's where we're strong amen it's when we are in the presence of his word is when we're in the presence of his anointing when it's in the presence of his love when we see him feel his mercy and Grace that prepares us to go give the very same thing out to those that we start to run into on a day in day off basis amen our failures prepare us to treat others the same way that he treats us when we fail amen if we're going to have Grace we've got to receive Grace I remember brother talked to me one time and he said you know so and so you know did you see what he he spoke on at this church a while back and I said I looked at a little bit and he said he said he was just so hard he said there's no Grace there the reason why he didn't have Graces because he hadn't recognized Grace in his own life yet you're hard when you don't receive it you'll see people are gracious when they're receiving Grace when they're aware they're self-aware of their failures and their faults they're aware that God's having to work with them too and then that gives us an opportunity to start allowing other people to have God work with them too rather than requiring a standard of them that we ourselves can't ever achieve amen so often we're more judgmental because we're not where we ought to be and so we project that on to the next person rather than saying he's got Grace for me in my condition I'll have Grace for you in yours let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what Grace what Grace Lord that you would predestinate us Lord before we ever did a thing good or bad Lord and then after we did bad Lord yet you gave your life for us Heavenly Father Lord Your Grace is new your Mercy's new every day Lord and we know that if we can come to you with repentant hearts Lord if we can just come back in and continue to claim that blood Lord Your Grace Just flows over and US day in and day out heavenly father but Lord we don't want to receive it and never give it and Lord that's the challenge for our day I believe is to hold that merciful Grace gracious and loving attitude Lord that the bride is supposed to have Heavenly Father Lord would you grant us that Grace to be gracious today Heavenly Father Lord that when there is none deserving your yet we give it out Lord when somebody pushes us past our limit Lord may we look to your grace and decide to just raise it up a little bit more Lord and give it right back to them Heavenly Father Lord let us not hold each other to a performance contract Lord even ourselves Lord but may we fall back into the perfect Grace that you gave us and trust that you'll take us through to the end Heavenly Father Lord give us victory Lord give us victory in our lives Lord over the things that hold us back Lord and give us eyes of Grace as we look at our brothers and sisters around Lord that we'd encourage them on the way Lord rather than judging before us Lord would you just help us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen let's sing that song new Mercy that I talked about it's it's 1062 but I
