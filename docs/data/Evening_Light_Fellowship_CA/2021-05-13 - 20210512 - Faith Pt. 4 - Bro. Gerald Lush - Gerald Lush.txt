lord amen [Music] hallelujah i am yes all that i am amen praise the lord amen thank you jesus grace by the grace of god amen amen yes praise the lord amen not all that i was is all that i am amen present tense god ever does anything he does it in the present tense amen he wants us wants us to believe now not not past tense belief not a future belief but now amen keep believing what he's what he's doing amen and that's going to indicate what he did amen and it's going to push us on to what he will do amen praise the lord so brother's not just saying i believe i believe and so on go on and on and on no no it's a faith that controls your life how you live how you think how you act how you react amen brother it's your actions and reactions proves your faith amen so i pray the grace of god that god has seen in you and in me amen the faith that pleases him amen and without faith it's impossible to please him this is amazing so brother it's important that we know the faith that god's looking for amen to know the faith that god will feed and the faith that god will bless amen brother oh my faith will always bring god on the scene true faith amen will always put god in control amen true faith we're trusting again the lord will help us to go a little further into the thoughts on faith amen and millions and millions in the world today believe they have faith but it's not the faith that pleases god and there's again many many around the world who own they feel well i've got faith i got faith i believe i believe this i believe that but yet are we believing what god wants us to believe are we believing what god is putting the emphasis on in these last days oh brother what an hour that we're living what an hour that we we need to know what god is looking for amen so that we're going to walk amen according as god would have us to walk by the grace of god we're going to believe what god wants us to believe amen not only that what we need to believe amen we're looking for a change amen we're looking to go from time to eternity okay good what's going to give us that faith because we're going from time to eternity it is a faith that will please god amen like we said there in ephesians we've been we've been resurrected and we've been caught up and raptured spiritually in christ and the word is being revealed there amen praise the lord so brother of you if you've experienced the resurrection you've experienced the rapture spiritually brother hallelujah you know what god wants wants in you you know the faith that god is looking for in you so i trust by grace that we're going to we're going to really really take it serious concerning what god has spoke to us on faith and brother how much how much more serious ought to be considering what jesus said considering considering the last days that when he came when he would come he said will he find faith on the earth what faith is going to be that god that bad lord yes it's going to be that bad amen so again i've emphasized it let me say it again this is even a greater reason for us to make our calling and our election sure by the grace of god amen a confirmation of our faith the faith that god wants us to have the faith that brother of all that god has done and the word he's revealed it's ordained predestinated to give us that that faith amen going beyond the faith in the first age going beyond the faith in in the way on down through luther wesley even the pentecostals amen we're going beyond that amen because brother god did it they believed it they lived it amen so now what has god done what are we believing what are we living amen and what are we living for i tell you like luther and lutheran them they only lived just to they went out what for to to reveal in there in their lives amen in their testimony what justification was amen it was god in simplicity praise the lord sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen brother leave it as the prophet said coming out of the seals now he said listen he said leave it the way that it is and he said don't make it bigger than what it is and don't make it smaller than what it is amen so brother all that god has done and what god has revealed what luther didn't didn't make it any bigger amen brother that was that was a simple faith a civil revelation that god gave luther amen oh it it shocked it shocked him and oh my he just kept going going going amen and brother he got to the place where oh he saw what god was he saw what the revelation of god the faith of god amen and of course we know he came out of the catholic church but there was a time when he oh my he he drew a big list oh of of false teachings of the catholic church and this and this and this he was pointing them to god in simplicity in the word amen oh yeah and that's another reason why they they brought them in they put them on trial in the church and oh yeah they were they were going to kill them they threatened to kill him but threatened to take his life and what did luther say amen he just stood there in all that oh luther you've got to you ought to be afraid you ought to get nervous well they said what are you going to do he said we're giving you a choice amen and what luther just stood there and he said here i stand he said i can do no other amen he wasn't going to compromise amen he wasn't going to turn away from what god had revealed to him concerning justification he was going to keep on sharing it amen and again brother praise the lord god has got friends in every age for his elect oh yeah god's got somebody there to protect them someone there to help them amen and father brother got to the place where the military in luther's day the military went over and got luther and took him into the wilderness while four to hide him and they wanted to save his life amen they didn't want nothing they didn't want the the church or anybody to do anything to harm luther no sir they appreciated what he did we appreciate what god reveals with amen so brother and sister the i tell you it's not necessarily man altogether but it's the devil knowing his time is short brother he's going to get come down amen and he's going he's going to fight us he's going to fight what we believe amen oh yes he's going to try but oh yeah by his works he's going to try to get us to oh yeah just just just get it in your head but not in your heart amen and again the problem god did bread they'd bring it out and he said oh yeah you got the you got the mechanics but not the dynamics amen the holy ghost and again and another in another message he said he said you're in the message but the message is not in you and he was talking to the believers in his own church oh yeah he knew that so brother what would he feel today what would god reveal to him today if he was here in this assembly amen that whether or not we have the real genuine holy ghost faith amen or do we have the intellectual knowledge amen of the letter of the word but not the spiritual revelation amen because if it's god if your faith is of god if your faith is from god amen brother if it's true true faith it's in your heart amen not that but it's a faith that controls thoughts words and deeds amen it's a faith that controls your motives and objections in life it controls you oh you see you see it's god in charge by faith by faith by faith you're looking for this and god will reveal this you're looking for this and god does this and you just stay with the lord amen by the grace of god you're not living for yourself you're not living for this church you're not living for william branham you're living for jesus amen praise the lord and no wonder that god took the prophet off the scene he had to amen because they were going to worship him amen not jesus oh yes they were screaming more and more and more amen as again that brother put that note in the prophet's pocket oh yeah when he was moving he was going up toward the pulpit and that brother come over and he and he put this note in his pocket and he ran back and he was he was doing the recording he was recording that service amen oh yes it's the brother that we would be familiar with if i mention his name amen and so brother branham when he got up there on the platform he took the he took the note out and read it amen and he said oh what william branham is my lord that was the note that was the note amen and the prophet when he come to the pulpit brothers he had to highlight it and he had he had to refer to it and he said he said our brother gave me a note he said and he took it out and and he read it and he said william branham is my lord he said listen he said you know what that does that makes me antichrist amen so he said no he said i'm not your lord no he was here he was here to reveal his lord he was there to amen to show him his lord amen in the word by the word and by the signs and wonders he said this is not me he said i can't do this amen he said i've got to get out of the way and again we have seen him on the films and we've heard him say it maybe on on on sermons or the tapes now he said i got to get out of the way so he can take over amen so jesus came in and and i'm sure in one of the films there and that with the deep color to the deep that he was saying the same thing and he was talking and talking and talking amen that's something they didn't understand you know because they felt it would be more emotional and more you know they feel this feel that good scream of this the scream of that no no he said now he said you know what i'm waiting for he said i'm waiting for him to come on the scene amen why he said because he couldn't do it well what they wanted it took it took jesus coming on the scene amen then all of a sudden that pillar of fire came in came into that room and the prophet of god saw it and he said oh praise the lord he said he's here he's there amen and what did he do after he was here he said now he said i take every spirit in this building under my control for the glory of god amen well the prophet did it now brother the bride the holy ghost in the bride is endeavoring to take every every spirit in this church under his control amen for the glory of god amen the preacher is there to any any studying and he's wandering and he's thinking and meditating to get this word out lord what is it you want me to preach what is it you want me to do how many of us coming to church got that burden that means coming to church it's prayed lord we pray you're going to be in control tonight amen and the going forth of the word lord we're praying that whatever whatever it is you want you want me to know i pray that you'll anoint it knowing the preacher so he's going to say this and he'll say that amen lord amen brother are you looking for god to say something to you tonight amen not just a general message not just a general revelation for all the church and all the believers no brother sister are you looking for god to deal with you are you looking for god to minister to you amen faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen so brother you're amen you come to oh my amen we come to church without with those revelations of the attitude i gotta have the motivational objective that i need amen brother oh lord i pray grace in the name of jesus help me to have that right attitude that right spirit right motive right objective so the lord you will minister to me and i won't miss it amen it's not just a preacher or the preacher of this to preacher that he said this he said that amen but was it god dealing with you amen was it god trying to get you to understand this understand that to acknowledge this and acknowledge that amen not necessarily acknowledge it to me not acknowledging to one another but to jesus amen thank you jesus amen for ministering to me tonight thank you jesus for giving me the revelation that i need tonight thank you lord for correcting me amen oh my do people want this revelation that revelation another revelation but how many want a correction amen oh my because because god god corrects us even even as parents correct children and they do this and do that amen as i and i i don't know i mentioned or not but the lord willing i would like to come and minister again on oh on on what god has the attitude that god is looking for and that god is working on in you amen oh god does this and god does that well brother i got to be honest when it comes to the word and we go through the scriptures there oh my lord my lord my lord oh lord that is the life of a believer oh some people think oh it's just going to be all happy oh hallelujah wonderful thank you lord amen amen but now they say well i need it yeah but again it's not no it's not needing this revelation and this of this doctrine and this teaching and this theology no it's we need correction amen we need the lord to work on us to keep anointing us up and amen and then to keep us in line with the word amen oh there's too many god there and all they were after and you know the prophet god knew it that there were many in the in the audience and all they knew all they wanted were oh we're waiting for the prophet of god to reveal this waiting for him to reveal that to preach this to preach that or another doctrine this theology amen no brother yeah but why why was he revealing it brother it was it was for you it was for me it was the teachers it was to encourage us it was to train us amen as sons and daughters of god amen and go forth as sons and daughters of god by the grace of god praise the lord so are we going forth revealing the revelation reflecting the revelation of our father [Music] don't worry about the the natural father because because that's only natural for you for you for you to reflect his attitude it's only natural for you to reflect well he is motors and objectives oh yeah you were born with that amen but the bible might praise the lord see your natural birth producer amen so that's why god ordained and predestinated a spiritual birth amen you must be born again amen by the grace of god hallelujah from now you're going to have the new nature of god in you in control amen and brother listen as long as we're in this flesh that the old nature is still there amen and we'll be dealing with that right on through to the end oh yeah that old nature fighting it amen with the new nature it's fighting that so you don't live don't live don't live based on the old nature no no don't go out and do this because oh yes i do that i do that no is it the will of god sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen praise the lord amen is god in control amen again as i said down through the ages and the revivals the revivals revivals whatever they did god was in control amen they were following his leadership and they're under under the under amen under his leadership under his anointing and god was controlling them in thought word and deed amen brother you consider luther and what he did and how he lived you consider john wesley what he did now he lived like i said the government came and checked on him because they were reporting he was reporting a lot of income a lot of income a lot of income people giving them money given this giving this and that oh yeah and but they were shocked of course when they got into his house amen oh something wrong here yeah john wesley one day said we we thought you me you had all this money well he said i just give it to the lord he said i and i did see in the in the gospel and so on because he only had one he had one table he had one chair i believe and he it said just one of this one of that one of that in his in his cupboards they said why he says all i need he said i don't need anymore amen because but all the blessings that god gave him he used for the glory of god amen so brother they were shocked at the life that john wesley was living amen considering all the money and the finances that he had access to oh this is he didn't bother with that didn't bother him amen a 10 or a college e-o-e-e yeah yeah i attend our college why should i care i sure john but you will say amen amen and when and when he would sing that if he if they could sing it back then brother it was it was a faith that he believed amen he really believed it in his soul amen yeah is this uh is this i like it like a brother said and i got it on tape maybe somewhere it might be in the basement here i can say tape some years ago amen yeah when uh you say oh yeah he said you know the biggest lies told are told in church yeah that's what he said all right and he said oh yeah he said i tell her a college wife should i care they're building a mansion for me over there he said is that the truth or are you singing a lie oh yeah just i pray the grace of god brother that that when god speaks his word to you and reveals it to you it's you're going to let that have control over you amen we go out it's not me that lives it's not you that lives it's christ living in us can you say you got that life can you say that the life you lived today was the life of jesus amen the life that you lived today was totally under the leadership of christ in his word amen oh yeah bothers you you're not going to do what you want to do you're going to be oh i pray god grace lord to give us that anointing that word so that we're all led by the spirit amen that the faith that pleases god is the faith that controls you amen the faith that pleases god is the faith amen that controls your thoughts your words your deeds your motives your objectives amen because you're well do i have to stop and consider this consider no well no because you've got the holy ghost you've got christ in you so it's all automatic amen and when you're going to do this and god comes down with a conviction amen oh yeah no no no don't don't do that and so you turn away you don't even you don't want to wonder or to be disappointed no no oh lord will your will be done amen by the grace of almighty god oh my how many of us are really truly honestly sincerely led by the spirit the holy spirit what you do and what you don't do god help us let god have control amen proving that brother is proof that's the proof that why that's why we're going back where we come from we come from eternity we're going back to eternity as jesus said it was tremendous he said he said no one is ascended up only he that came down even the son of man who is in heaven who is jesus you're here but he could say no i'm in heaven yeah there's another body weight in me because he's going death burial and resurrection was going to bring him together with that with that body into a glorified state amen by the grace of god praise god god help us brother sister amen sorry to keep you that long but let's stand and sing only believe amen a confirmation to our musicians amen

father that when the when our theophany just pulls away that we're going to humble ourselves to prayer amen humble ourselves to lord seek forgiveness to bring that theophany back to us again amen so the grace of god that you are in control father of our brothers and sisters here and online in the name of the lord jesus christ grace lord that you are in control that we are truly led by the spirit

that lives not my brother and sister that's living but jesus lord you are living in us you're living with us and lord it was your anointing that brings us here tonight for the hearing of your word and the increase of our faith amen by the word so grace o god i pray in the name of jesus christ be with us encourage us strengthen us amen to keep moving on for god in the name of our lord jesus christ for the glory of god amen and amen now i believe [Music] yes amen amen let's not sing a lie let's sing the [Music] truth all things are possible now i believe amen praise the lord amen our musicians can take a seat amen god bless them you know and to ask you to keep sister betty in prayer because she is still suffering with pain and agony when it comes to her back and her hips and and and her her legs the grace of god she's waiting a long time for to see a specialist and uh and of course it's amazing you know that that we have to wait so long for this wait so long for that and i guess one of the reasons is is because everything is free and the doctors want to do this they take so many in whereas one time they wouldn't do that so we pray the grace of god to help her to get to see the doctor amen and praying grace to increase her faith amen to believe that with his stripes she was healed remember healing is past tense it's done god help us amen and also again to it was mentioned by our brother bob i believe again to keep remembering our brother tom snow in prayer and again as i said there was it was a few days ago that the doctor's only given maybe three hours or maybe a week and he's he's long over three hours and and he's into a second week not a third one and not the first one rather so the grace to our brother tom amen and not and even the last time i saw him in his home and had prayer with him oh he was there and he was worshiping praise the lord amen everything was so real to him so i pray grace that as he gets closer to eternity it become more real well it will it will yeah and and others are amazed at his faith because his son ed snow he usually goes up when he's there he'll pray for pray for our brother tom and uh and for the time when when brother ed prays brother tom is there to raise his arms if he can do it or to say praise the lord thank you jesus amen oh yeah he's confused when it comes to the natural things of life but he hasn't forgotten the spiritual amen praise the lord god bless you and also uh and you were praying for brother gord snow's daughter again the second daughter yeah she she died and she was i think she was 52 years old and so we pray the grace of god and uh to our brother gord as they deal with this second daughter amen in such a short period of time amen and also uh today brother george smith called me on the phone and uh and so we were discussing the word and exactly what he's doing and what he can do but he still mainly i think he has visited and he's traveled to maybe central and south america but he's basically i don't think he can go anywhere else except in tennessee or in the united states he he did drive around tennessee to different churches and uh at the time i spoke with me i think it was in his plans to for that next day i guess that he was going to drive to i think south carolina north or south carolina and uh so he can do that so we pray the grace of god be with our brother and uh he also informed me that when it comes to the trips to israel that uh the trips that they've they made many many many years him and rebecca used to do it and after after rebecca went on to be with the lord of course brother george still kept going to israel maybe two or three times a year but it's it's now he said i feel brother that the trips to israel are over it's finished and they don't think that he'll be going there anymore of course our brother george himself is getting older and and maybe getting moving on to 80 years old he's 76 or 77 years old so grace of god be with brother george but it's in him to keep ministering and stay with the word stay with the message so and he asked me to send greetings to the saints here he said pass on my greetings he said brother and he said also he said keep me in prayer amen so god bless our brother george smith so he's living in he's still living in tennessee of course he goes to a church there i'm not sure the name of the pastor now but he goes to a church in tennessee and uh and he's he's living again of course for believers international that's that's that's their site and that's their their their ministry and it's providing people with different things even even books or booklets whatever and some of them of course wrote out there i'm not sure if there's any left out there now but i was going to order some more and that was the large books that uh that they printed for a number of years now and also uh brother george's son uh i'm not sure it was william or stephen in uh tennessee and his daughter and angel they call her and so they're there and his son and his daughter they are running or looking after believers international amen so god's grace to them amen and also again brother i pray the lord bless mother george in what he is doing in driving around different parts of the united states and ministering praise the lord so i think that's the news for now so we pray god's grace be with him and god's grace again with brother tom yes and sister betty brother bob said brother ron called you yeah sister yeah sister uh shirley called sister betty so she was taught in sister shirley for quite a while this afternoon so god bless them amen and so and also too to say have you ever felt to go to central newfoundland go see brother ron and sister shirley because you walk in there you're home yeah i've been there a number of times and to me it's home oh yeah you don't you you don't have to be strange or afraid of this afraid of that do what you would do in your own home amen and sister surely be there to help you and brother ron praise the lord and again as all due respect to brother ron but uh i told him i said brother when you die i said we're going to put it in the paper no flowers by request bologna he wants ballona so and so i said at the same time i said if we got to put you in a box i said we won't put no flowers in your hand we're blown in your hands yeah so that's that's brother ron's really uh what he's craving for in this world amen so and the lord has provided him with it amen if i go out there i can be sure one thing that we have to eat that's baloney amen so god bless our brother ron and sister shirley and the others in central newfoundland amen the grace of god be with us turn with me in your bibles to second peter chapter one again and maybe we've already read this but i had such a number of scriptures here and i'm not remembering which ones we read or didn't read so let's go back to second peter chapter one and beginning to read at verse one and just to share with you again some thoughts on faith and i will have to maybe sort of bring it to a closure either tonight or or on sunday morning we'll see what the lord would have us do because when it comes to faith there's so much to say and so much to explain that you can go on and on and on amen and on this side i maybe i could preach a few sermons and then turn it over to brother john jonathan amen let him take it and bring it bring it to a closure amen so the will of the lord be done in ii peter chapter 1 and verse 1 simon peter as servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ amen so peter referring to it as precious faith amen and that he received it it's not the intellect or the the letter of the word but by the spirit amen revealing the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ and he said grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus and of jesus our lord amen according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness amen through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue amen whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature amen through the exceeding great and the exceeding precious promises amen having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence and to your faith virtue amen and to virtue knowledge are we increasing in the character of god are we dying more and more to ourselves and the old nature and getting more and more of the new nature of christ in us amen add to your faith with diligence virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and her brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you amen amen if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen brother are we adding to our faith not not the not this doctrine of that doctrine this this idea and there's another idea no no let's add to our faith the righteousness of god amen let's start to our faith the character of jesus amen going from faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and god crowns it with divine love amen and to say again in verse 8 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen so can we say that we started with faith amen and as we matured in the lord amen matured how many are mature sons and daughters amen mature believers and brother you're to become mature you're going to mature into virtue and into knowledge and into temperance and you keep on maturing into patience godliness brotherly kindness and the anointing of the holy ghost amen brother this is what god is looking for and if we're if we're really born again and we got christ in us we got this in us oh yeah so i pray that we're going to die more and more to to to ourselves and become more and more alive to jesus it is christ revealing himself to his church and christ revealed himself to his bride amen oh praise the lord amen so that when he comes down to get to catch his bride away she's perfect amen she's in a perfect fate by a perfect revealed word by the grace of god amen brother don't don't don't let oh this idea i'm in the flesh and i still i'm still partly just just controlled by time no no brother what's in control now remember he came down to do this amen he laid down his life for us he shed his blood for us amen what else did it do oh jesus did this jesus did that yes but what's he doing now because he did that he did that and then he came back and shared it with you amen the life of the blood amen it's not the natural blood now that god that we want our lord give us the natural blood no we need the life of his blood amen and the baptism of the holy ghost is the life of the blood amen and it is eternity amen praise the lord because he wasn't born in sin no no you you the way he was born my brother's sister amen the the life in his blood was the holy ghost praise the lord and and when he laid down his life he shed his blood amen you come back to share us the life of that blood with you and me confirming that he's he's not dead he's alive forevermore amen and he is sharing with us the resurrection praise the lord amen so he said but he that lack of these things is blind i trust we're not blind amen he that lack of these things just think the problem of god preached it the stature of a perfect man and he that lacketh it is blind amen and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his o sins oh my lord grace that we're we're not in that situation amen that we're not in that with that attitude but believing lord that that god is in control by the life of the blood amen and he said again he has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins and wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure diligent intelligence amen you consider it every day with the father with god with jesus amen you want to confirm your relationship with him amen and you want to confirm that is the life of his blood is in you the holy ghost amen and again bear with me to keep keeping you all standing but brother it's like when it comes to blood no no we won't have no blood in the new body no we'll have the life of the blood because jesus said look when he came back he said he said oh this body doesn't doesn't have this he said there or whatever it was and he showed him he said he's got flesh and bone he didn't say blood he said flesh and bone amen it's eternity amen the blood we got the life of the blood that's what's important that's what we needed the life of the blood and the life of jesus blood was the holy ghost and a brother a preacher brother one time he sort of charged me on it and he was challenging me on it and he was saying he said brother he said when we get to get in into heaven we get into eternity and he said unto those glorified bodies he says it's going to be it's still going to be flesh and blood no brother i said it's not it's going to be like him flesh and bone and i said we won't need the blood i says the holy ghost has taken us back there amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah so brother he said again for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ amen just think that there's going to be an entrance ministered to us abundantly amen let's go let go and let god have his way abundantly in your life in your everyday living let him have absolute control amen praise the lord amen abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ and wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth god bless you might be seated amen established in the present truth i trust we're established in the truth amen and that word is established in you and me and that god is bringing that word to pass in you and in me it's not all the words going to come to pass this is happening that's happening amen we know what's going on out there in the world but what's going on here in us amen is god allowing that god's allowing this god permitting this god's doing this yeah what's he doing in you and me amen so what what what confirmation or testimony do you have on the inside of the inside amen amen brother whatever it is it's going to give us the revelation amen that god wants us to have and it is any revelation and faith that we need today it is the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen it is the revelation of a new heaven and new earth because we are in that hour we're in that age we're in that time amen god is causing us to blend into eternity amen to see what he has ordained and what he has prophesied that he's going to do in the last days brother he did what he did in luther and wesley and the pentecostals and other other groups amen what's he doing in us brother i pray god that we we can recognize what pentecost failed to recognize amen the part of god said pentecost recognized this rickard recognized that when it comes to the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit and he said it's still in the body and he said it's on the shelf there amen but what's god focusing on now just saying i know what he focused on in luther's age wesley's age and the old-fashioned salvation army amen and we know what he focused on in the in the pentecostal revival but what's he focusing on now what is god doing now brother we know what he did in william branham we know what he did in the opening of the seven seals amen brother is he accomplishing it in you and me amen concerning why god did it amen in revelation 10 in other scriptures there in the book of revelation and in the new testament what god prophesied he was going to do in the last days amen he did it amen so brother sister what he did is he'd be made flesh and you and me amen the grace of god amen do we truly believe it to the extent that it's now now christ in us bringing to pass what he did and what he's what he's doing amen what did he do what did he do all of this when it comes to luther and wesleyan and elijah but down here in in the up here rather in the last age it was the complete revelation of god amen according to revelation 10 amen the mystery of god revealed in the old me of the seven seals so brother yeah that was done but are we or is christ in us amen manifesting why he did it amen what was what is supposed to be the results of the opening of the seven seals what is the results of the of that messenger of malachi 4. amen what is the results of god doing this god doing that amen in william branham's life and man like i said there was the evangelist back in back in those days they they just they just couldn't recognize william branham's ministry amen they recognize oh he does this he does this when it comes to healing and signs and wonders but when it comes to the word they they couldn't recognize and there was there was a link one time on the internet and they had a site there and they said how do we reconcile they said the the the the signs and wonders amen and the miracles of william brown's ministry how do we reconcile that with what he teaches yeah because oh they they recognized this was god god and william branham god was doing this surely william brennan couldn't do it it was god in it but jesus had him they said this is amazing but yet they said consider what he taught and the things that he preached they said how do we reconcile that and say well brandon was a man of god and he had those kinds of winners it was god in him god with him amen using him but he said what about the teaching where did that come from because they didn't believe it and again that's why even oral roberts when when he he was fellowshipping with brother brown and he told brother about him brother branham you've got to stop preaching those things he told him and brother brown said no my brother if i don't preach it who's going to preach it he said the ministry is not preaching out there the pastors are not preaching it so he said so he felt that he had to preach it and god wanted to preach and he wouldn't stop amen and that's why eventually all the all the preachers pulled away from them the evangelists pulled away from them amen that's right and they began to crucify him yeah with their words amen so brother and sister amen but so it so is god accomplishing in us what he what he always ordained to accomplish through the ministry of william branham god did this through william graham god did that true william random but what is it accomplishing in us amen oh it just brought me out of denominations and i recognized him as a prophet and and he preached this and he preached that yeah well that's good why did god ordain it why did he preach all that amen well they they luther preached justification and there was a generation that was a church age that was justified and then in lutheran wesley rather a church age that was sanctified and then the pentecostals there was a church age amen that received the anointing of the holy ghost gives to the spirit amen right but still brother brown said he said what's wrong with pentecost he said they don't recognize the message amen they should have amen because god ordained it god predestinated for to to give us faith amen and not just a faith for justification and so on down to the other ages amen but the faith for the resurrection and the rapture amen how many of us are getting more and more into the resurrection more and more into the rapture and focusing more and more on what god's doing through the word that he revealed amen and not there just to condemn this one and condemn that one condemn this one and condemn oh yeah oh they believe in the trinity oh they believe in this they believe in that what do we believe well what your what the life you live proof what you believe amen what effect is the message having in your everyday living amen so that what you do when where and how you do it it's controlled by the holy ghost amen because you want to stay in line with the word amen and you want to keep walking in the word keep walking keep going amen but yeah oh yes this doctrine this type no no amen we believe it but maybe we may not understand it all oh yeah but we believe it amen but but are we keeping are we going on going on going on why because brother look up why the door is open in the glory amen and brother the revealed word for this hour is ordained to give us faith not to focus on the world amen but to focus on the rapture focus on the resurrection amen how many are really living for the rapture how many are really living for the resurrection morning noon and night you can't get away from it and i'll tell you this morning new tonight martin luther what was it not no but brother sister yeah luther what was it well it was just morning noon and night he preached it in the morning preached it in the afternoon he preached it in the night get up again early and go on preaching it again justification what like like i said the others are wesley sanctification and the old-fashioned salvation army the baptism of the holy ghost yeah and the gifts of the spirit and i'll tell you this and what and the prophet was right when he said they that the the methodists organized so quickly that god had to raise up william booth with red hot salvation to take them on to the pentecostal revival amen and i've got writings of their sermons and writings of what they were preaching and brother right near the end of their ministries they were preaching oh amen we thank god for you know justification sanctification but we're what we what we need now is what peter what did on the day of pentecost the army was saying that oh yeah the founders of the salvation army was pointing that this is what we need this is what we need amen and they saw this was happening that was happening and the church was becoming modern and and yeah amen and yes yes they noticed that they were coming worldly and yet they're still professed to be church and coming worldly to the extent that that our brother william booth and his wife when they preached they had to scream out listen they said your experiences are going to begin in your closet why because they noticed that that the brothers and sisters were getting modern in in what they were wearing and what they were doing and how they were living and so on amen so they preached it repent amen but god took them on to the pentecostal revival amen and the pentecostal revival went on and on and on but now where is it where is it amen but it's not there now like it used to be no siree it's not like it used to be even when when i was as i said raised salvation army and then when we moved my my family moved in here and we we eventually began to go to go to a pentecostal church it was on casey street i think or cashton avenue not far from the the sinclair hospital there down down the street there the building is still there but not a church anymore but i did go to that church there amen a few times and then i remember i said oh well they're they're fur they're they're gone further into the word than in the salvation army so lord i'll i'll stay here oh i stayed with them and when they built the new one and even that one is sold now they got another one i came out rolled and i i was in that that other new one there and i just kept worshiping the lord praising the lord amen and like i said in december 1965 the pastor baptized me but again it was in the name of the father son the holy ghost but it wasn't until early in 1966 that i i got the revelation of the message amen well i didn't get the full revelation no at that time but it was when i went back to gamble and fellowship with brother and sister burns amen and fellowship with the others that were there just a few of us in there in their room amen they said brother we got something to tell you and amen we got a prophet amen praise the lord hallelujah so brother the word began to take effect in my life amen to change me and to finally that i left pentecost amen because i wasn't wanted in pentecost they didn't want me there and so on because i would testify of this testify of that didn't want it amen they felt i was just leading those other pentecostals leaving leaving them astray and and i did to approach the one the one of the brothers that i was accused of for doing this doing that and he said brother it's not you he said you haven't done nothing to me you've helped me when it comes to the revelation of the word but he says he said it's them he said because he said they professed he said to be this to be that but he said where's god he said god's not with him amen oh yeah well thank god and brother i pray grace that we're going out in doing what we're doing believing what we're believing amen that we're going to reflect jesus amen that he's not dead he's alive forevermore and he has come back to prove to us amen as he did to martha i am the resurrection and the life amen brother and he relayed the word and laid the word into the prophet to give us faith in the resurrection faith in the rapture amen by the grace of almighty god grace grace grace amen so brother are we are we getting more faith for the rapture are you getting more less conscious of this world and more conscious of the world to come amen that is going to have such a control in our lives that we're going to feel the same way jesus felt when he said he said i am no more in the world and he went oh how when will i go how long will i will it before i go when i go out of here oh yeah amen see he he come from eternity but he wasn't born in sin he was still more and more conscious of eternity more and more conscious of where he come from and where he was going amen he was not born in sin born without sin amen to bring us to the revelation amen that he had the life that he had borned again a new creature in christ amen so grace that we're not just going to focus on old william branham and this teaching and that teaching and that teaching no we got to let it let god through those teachings give us the faith oh right amen praise the lord oh oh yeah praise the lord oh yes yes lord now i'm seeing more and more and more now i know what you've done but lord i'm seeing more now what you're doing yeah i thank you for what you've done in the ministry of william branham and the ministry of malachi 4 they owe me the word amen the breaking of those seals thank you jesus amen oh i'm getting more conscious and what about with all this cobra 19 issue how many times do you think about the rapture of resurrection through the day i believe jesus got to the place where he brother it was morning noon and night and he was thinking about where he come from and where he was going morning new tonight the bride if she's thinking about anything see where we come from and where we're going amen we're going to a marriage summer as the prophet said we're not going to a marriage he said we're going to a marriage supper he said we're married here that's why he preached the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen but how many are how many are really going to live in the life of the bride they got that attitude they got that spirit they got that anointing that i'm bright how many got that faith amen not not saying oh well i'm methodist i'm i'm this and i'm that yeah i'm lutheran or i'm pentecostal i'm salvationary no no no no brother god has given us or i i'm this around that god has given us through the word through what he's done he's given he's giving the bride the revelation of who she is amen no wonder he pre he preached invisible union how many got the faith of the invisible union how many got the faith that we i am married with him amen praise the lord not that i will be married to him i am amen and i'm going to a marriage supper and he asked what he that's what he preached in 1962 we were engaged we were engaged to him and he said he he was giving is giving his bride to be this this this this amen but then he said in 1964. he said now he said we're not going to a marriage we're going to a marriage supper praise the lord amen brother any any revelation that god wants us to have any faith that god wants us to have as a result of what he has done and what he's doing is to have the revelation that we are the bride of christ and that we're moving to a to a to a resurrection and a rapture amen but um and again he said the dead in christ he says going to appear to us and they're waiting on us and what long are we going to let keep them weighty oh yeah because i tell you brother sister like like the there's people that i've talked to witness to and they they they're saying oh they're dead they don't know nothing what i said no i said physically they're dead i said because i said that body was cursed dust thou art the dust shall thou return but i said he gives us a glorified body a new body amen oh they said but the bible says the dead know not anything i said you need to you need to go and get all the scriptures i should read what it says after amen i said yeah i said if you went on a read what what what what they said the next few chapters as you know they don't know anything about this world no no not this world amen but they they're they're very conscious of where they are i said remember oh i said remember i said the the rich man that lifted up his eyes in hell being in torment what and he and he's and he and he was calling on god go get get lazarus to go back and warn his brothers his natural family amen no no no and i said lazarus when he died oh he was lifted up his eyes in the bosom of abraham and that's when that person made a joke out of it oh abraham's bosom must be some big if all that if all the dating crises are gone there but they've been i said yes they're there they're sitting in eternity in glory that's referring to as it were the bosom of abraham eternity i said not this natural or physical bosom no it's faith amen because abraham believed god amen abraham had the faith that please god amen oh they still wouldn't believe what i was saying that's because the bible says if this tabernacle be destroyed we got one already waiting eternal in the heavens amen so i said it's theirs it's a it's a theophany body i explained it and so on amen but brother it's been 40 years since i've been preaching this message here it's been 55 years that i've been preaching this message in newfoundland yeah i must uh how much further have we gone forward into the revelation into the faith that pleases god oh the faith that pleases god oh yeah it's what brother brown preached concerning this concerning that no that's that's just to prepare you for for what he's going to do all of that together is going to give us a faith amen of the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen that we're not living for ourselves we're living for jesus amen oh i pray the grace of god help us brother too that we'll let go of the not the letter of the word and we'll get more and more into under the control of the revelation of the word amen and amen and if it does anything it's going to bring us into a greater and a greater relationship with jesus amen a greater and a greater relationship with our lord more and more intimate amen listen if it's all faith no love yeah he wants love amen love is thou mean more than these he put that emphasis on peter peter peter peter loveth thou me more than these amen do we love him more than we love anything else amen is the devil putting other things in our minds and in our flesh in our feelings in our in our intellect in our knowledge oh yeah he preached 1962 wisdom versus faith oh we're going to have wisdom in the word but what about the faith for the rapture we got wisdom for this we see this doctrine this doctrine this teaching that teaching yeah what about the rapture brother if there's anything anything left left for god to do now it's the rapture for the bride god help us amen lord give us that faith add to your faith amen no wonder the problem of god preached it 1962 and he referred to building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place the perfect man amen the perfect bride of christ amen to believe all not just not we're believers we're believers we're believers we're the bride we're the bride we're the bride amen god help us and remember again jesus said he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die what never die no never die and this is he was at the at the grave of lazarus with martha and he was talking to her he said though he he said though we're dead yet shall he live and he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die brother i pray grace oh i'm looking looking to die looking to die no i'm looking to live amen oh you're not going to die no i'm not going to die that's like again when when a sister died a number of years ago and at that time oh god god rest our soul for sure amen because of her testimony and it wasn't the message material it wasn't the message revelation that got her to come out of pentecost no no it's just that it was god working in her heart and her soul and she used to she used to go down and sit and fellowship with sister sister burns and they'd had a wonderful fellowship and like their spirits would blend oh yeah and she would express to sister barnes you know how that she didn't feel right when it comes to going to pentecost she said i don't agree what they're doing and how they're doing it and so sister barnes she said i know i understand she said sister lord bless you and eventually they've kicked her out yeah they kicked her out and she was one time she was in her house or outs out on the steps here somewhere and she was looking up and she could see at that time where the pentecost church was and and the parsonage and she could say oh or saw the office where the pastor was working on his notes oh she said he's he's doing this he's doing that and she quoted a scripture and what he was doing i don't recall it right now exactly but he said she's doing that but it was in the old testament there where where certain ones were doing a certain thing but it was false but they they did it they thought as it were for god i'm doing this for god but she said it's false it's a false doctrine a false teaching whatever he's doing she knew that that's before she ever knew about the message yeah but then she got kicked out she took her stand says no i don't agree with it don't do you're doing it let god do it that was her that was her challenge because she felt the man was too in control too much amen but she wanted god in control she oh they wanted to do this and especially to the young people and they had a lot of young people in the church there at the time they wanted to do this do this do this to keep the young people in church and she said you need to put them in the hands of god and he'll keep them in church amen no they wanted to do this want to do that so eventually they kicked her out amen amen and then she come down to brother and sister barnes oh and our spirit blended right in and she started to come to their cottage meetings more and more and more and again there was another service that we had a cottage meeting and and our sister was there and at the time we had a brother brother manuel he came from central newfoundland to minister to him in the college meeting and he was preaching and preaching and oh then all of a sudden he he talked about being being conscious of death and so on he said and he said there are those that are afraid he said when man says you're going to die you're going to die and he said this that and he said that's not bad it shouldn't be see if you've got faith you're not going to die you're going to leave and this sister was sitting in maybe the front seat there a chair and she lit out a scream and she said amen brother amen you're right why because she had she that her doctor told her that she was dying with cancer yeah and she did but she didn't fear she left it all with the lord amen oh no because i would go there and i would minister to them and she was there she was right into it not no all in the hands of the lord she lived she said one thing i am praying for she said brother gerald she says i'm praying for my husband i'm praying the grace of god to him for his salvation oh she said i'll leave all the rest with god or her going home well that's fine don't worry about that i'm not afraid of it she said amen and that's why when i i visited the funeral home and she was there oh in the in the box and uh oh he felt bad he felt bad i said what no i said brother she's better off now than she was when she was here what better off she's dead i said physically but not spiritually i said she got out of this body went into another one a theophany body and i explained it to him in the scriptures oh he said i didn't know that oh i said that's wonderful he said thank you so i don't know what he did or what he's believing now but amen we had that faith when we when we laid our sister our sister to rest amen to god be the glory amen brother if you had you got faith you got really got a genuine holy ghost faith brother i tell you this and god is working in you he's he's going to head to your faith virtue oh he will add virtue and he'll add to your faith divine knowledge the will of god temperance patience goodness godliness brotherly kindness and your life is going to be crowned off with christ christ in me the hope of glory amen so brother add to your faith how close are you closer to god now than than when you first came here or first came into the message 40 years ago are you more spiritual now than you were then amen do you love the lord now more than you did then you ought to because now you you've got a greater revelation of god you know him more oh yeah and the closer you get to him the more you're going to love him amen god help us amen come on where uh how far ahead are you more far ahead are you now than when you first started 40 years ago amen and when it comes oh it's getting more familiar with him amen not not the knowledge of the word not the knowledge the intellectual knowledge of the message oh i know this and i know that and he refers it again to that message wisdom versus faith are you going by the wisdom knowledge of the of the written word or are you going by faith that is giving you in your heart and makes you a new creature in christ amen grace grace in the name he said add these things to your faith how much has been added to your faith amen you started maybe with this and this but or are you still there well there are those we said we'll have that we'll have that just that measure and the stronger ones are support the weak amen but still even there they're sincere even with those with little faith they're still conscious of god they still love the lord they still love one another amen oh yeah because down through the years i i've met those sincere saints even though that even though that their faith was wasn't much but again they were sincere oh yeah and they wanted more do whatever god wanted to do amen well why do why would god allow someone like that in the church well to bring up what's in us amen god allows this god allows that amen oh well because i've seen i've seen brethren condemn brethren brothers amen look down their noses at them maybe even looking down their noses at brother girl yeah i remember first when i come to the message there are certain ones that would mock me and make fun of me because i was i was basically maybe the only one uh here in st john's because when i was baptized the brother that baptized me he said now i'm going to baptize he said he said a brother from saint john's and he said i want that brother to come now and so on it was referring to me although there was maybe i don't know how many people that was standing up on the on the hill there looking at the bishop falls rolling down rolling down and and and the baptism brother cater was there brother manuel ministered but the cater just played the music and so on amen yeah and i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ just a few months be after i was baptized in the name of father son holy ghost amen i don't know who was brought it out with his brother jonathan or one of the brothers here behind the pulpit no about the lord the name but not names name amen praise the lord he didn't i wasn't baptized in the names of the father son and holy ghost baptized in the name amen praise the lord hallelujah thank god grace brother let's judge ourselves by the word have you added this least to your faith amen he said there's given to us great or exceeding great exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises ye might be partakers of the divine nature and he said now he said besides all this give diligence and add to your faith and to your faith yeah the attributes of the of the nature of jesus the attributes of the character of jesus and he says make your calling and election sure and as i've said i'll say it again if we're living in that day wherein jesus said when he come will he have find faith on the earth how much more aren't we to make our calling an election sure again the prophet god did say there's not many gone in the bride living saints god help us amen is god going to let let time go on until most of us are taken off the scene i should it should put us on our guard when we consider what the scriptures say and what the prophet said that there's going to be few there are going to be very few amen living saints at the time of the rapture grace amen i know thank you turn with me to james chapter 2. i may have already read these before but let's read them again james chapter 2 and reading let's start at verse 15. amen thank you jesus love not the world neither the things that are in the world but there's too many getting caught up more and more with the with the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him amen if you're cut out more with the things of the world that you're living in the law of god's not in you not by any means for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever god's grace to us amen that we're doing the will of god through through this day through this week we're doing the will of god that yesterday you did the will of god yeah come on let's not get caught up with this whole world the dev the devil is going to make it oh beautiful wonderful just to attract your attention more and more and more oh yeah should the world pass it away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever grace of god to us amen that we be spiritual in our thoughts our words and our deeds spiritual you go and you live like jesus lived act like jesus act talk like jesus talk spiritual amen little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists and whereby we know that it is the last time amen they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would not no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not of us but ye have an unction from or anointing a man from the holy one and you know all things oh brother yes siree but don't don't boast of it stay humble amen i have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth god help us who is a liar but he that denieth that that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that deny it the father and the son and it says whosoever denied the son the same as not the father but he that acknowledgeth the son and the father also amen i pray we have an absolute complete relationship with god amen let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have re remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father amen the will of god from beginning to end and this is the promise that he has promised us even eternal life and these things have written on to you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and his truth as is no lie even as it taught you ye shall abide in him amen and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at is coming amen we have the faith that pleases god amen that is coming praise the name of the lord praise god he said don't reason believe amen no matter what the circumstances don't pay no attention to circumstances believe the word amen and he said wait just a minute and we'll go back to the seed again he said what was it the devil tried to do with wisdom make god's word say something that it didn't say amen that's right he tried to make god's word say something he didn't say so that's the way it comes today amen when they try to make god's word say something that it doesn't say well they say well i'll tell you brother branham you ain't got the right interpretation the bible said the prophecy of no private interpretation and why ain't it a private interpretation why the word of the lord came to the prophets it is interpreted by the prophet amen and that's why god sent a prophet in the last days because in the hour that we needed the interpretation of the word it's this hour amen because there's going to be so much confusion in these last days religious confusion spiritual confusion amen he said god's thoughts is as eternal as god is and he said that ain't skim milk my brother and he said he thought his thoughts is what he was and that's you too yeah your thoughts are going to reveal your nature yeah and of course your thoughts when you when you talk it's going to reveal your nature see again just to let our young people understand you know in their association with the worldly people the world especially as they're getting older that when this one meets you or somebody else meets you and you have fellowship with this one and all you you have friends with this one friends with that one do they do they recognize you as a christian do they recognize you as being spiritual oh they talk they talk spiritual so they say oh they talk religious you know they just know it by the way you talk the way you act and what you do and so on and what you don't do amen so brother sister i pray that we got that anointing in us hallelujah christ in us the hope of glory so they amen you oh yeah they know you're religious yeah again as i said when i worked for quite a while not quite a while i worked in the with the military in gander yeah and i was eventually i was made as a were the given control of all the others and so on and to get to get them to do this get them to do that when it comes to cleaning up everything and setting things in order i was in charge there that doing that by the grace of god and like i said then one night and i was telling people to do this do do this do this come on and tell that gentleman came by and as i said i don't know where he is now or if he's still here and he said excuse me and i said yes i said what is it i said no nothing he said i just wanted to let you know that that that i know that you're a christian i said oh you do oh yes oh i said well thank you i said i thank the lord for that oh yes yes he said i agree but he said i just know that you're christian that's the first time i ever talked to that gentleman that i that i knew of back then i haven't talked to him since and so on that many many many years ago and again at the same time uh when i worked with them i was walking into the kitchen there walking across the a certain area there and then this gentleman came up and he touched me on the shoulder and i said oh okay and he was much older and oh i said anything you you need or want knows that i just want to let you know that i know you're a christian so what yes he said you're a christian i just know by the way you talk and and and what you do and now you do it he said so he said i i appreciate it okay i said thank you don't don't uh you don't have to they have fussed over anything no no he said i'm just glad yeah and there's other other witnesses that i received as well so i and again it wasn't me it was christ in me so do they recognize that you're those that are dealing with you in your work or in your in your nature as living living where you're living your neighbors amen not that you're religious but are you christian amen god help us and he said that's he said when it comes to his thoughts is what he was yeah jesus thoughts is what he was and he said that's you too and it's what your thoughts are is what you are what your thoughts are is what you are amazing amen amen how many times that we have you through this week or through this day how many times have any of us said after a certain thought struck us get get thee behind me satan and then maybe some other thoughts to strike you thank you lord i needed that amen oh yeah you're you're dealing with the devil and with jesus oh yeah he's there working on your flesh jesus is working on your soul amen and again to let me explain what the prophet said about your theophanies he said he said it's not it's not 12 feet from you at any given time yeah and he said it's with you now he said if you sin and you do something wrong he said he'll pull away but not not much to her and that's when she rebuked the devil what earth theophany got real close to her amen oh yeah she says satan for the whatever she sent you for two hours whatever it was she said you've been you've been talking to me but she said now she said i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ and the darkness left the room and everything changed oh she was oh she was all so wonderful she felt the presence of god amen yes there's theophany getting closer to her amen praise god so he said no matter what you try to live by something else your thoughts is what you are amen you might go along and act like a nice fellow but in your heart you are an adulterer and he said whatever it is that's what you are your thoughts amen and god's thoughts was his word that was with him and in him it was god amen brother don't think i'm in the message so i don't have to worry this i don't have this don't have that i'll tell you what you're going to you've got the devil to deal with because god god is there with the positive the devil is there with the negative amen and i'll finish they say he said but i know that one day one day it'll be changed and she'll cast for cast forth her afflicted child the earth it will be changed one day he said faith believes that it is written and says the word as no flaws and did you ever hear of a minister say well i tell you the king james version the revised version or this here and he said it's just a little different it really didn't really mean that have you heard that oh my the world's contaminated with it but faith don't believe it faith believes god that can make me keep that book in order for me to live by amen if the god who made me is going to judge me can't keep his book in order then he's a very poor god i believe every word it's the truth what does it what does this do to believe that it gives faith a perfect resting place amen and brother brown is not talking you know like different versions of the bible because brother brown i was in his uh office in the church in tucson in his house rather in tucson and uh and he and the brother showed me some books in the books in brother brown's library and and there was a couple of them uh that were different versions of the bible and not only that there was another book there and it was absolutely of another religion that we i can't remember what it is now but i said oh that's brother brennan's yes he says this is brother branham's and it was it was the product of a certain religious cult that's what we refer to it as cult and i'm not sure what it was now and i said oh let me see it and he showed me the book and i said oh okay okay yeah i looked at it and so he took it and put it back with the rest of the books again oh yeah see god trusts us that we're not going to be led astray no god knows how far that we can go and do this and do that amen so god help us brother and uh oh yeah i believe i heard brother jonathan they use the amplified oh yeah well i got a i got a bible home and it's four versions it's the king james that's all i can remember it's the king james and and the amplified and then there's two more i don't know what they are now but there's four versions of the bible and when i open it of course you first most out of all of us got it but my bible there's got one two three four four places this is the bible this is the bible right there there well that's in that bible that i got this is the king james on the left on the right is the amplified then on the other side is the other other two versions yeah yeah so and you just i'll tell you this it won't deceive you because you're laid by the spirit amen so don't be afraid of it or i got to condemn this and condemn that no just leave it with the lord amen he said to believe the word gives faith a perfect resting place amen and he said what does faith do it believes he says just the way it is and that's the way god has preserved it down through the ages and he said here it is it's the word of god for me god honors it he gives a perfect faith in its trueness amen praise the lord hallelujah brother not under the influence of of religion but on the the influence of the holy spirit amen oh my he said look at cain and abel both of them was sincere cain took by his wisdom amen like his mother he took reasoning wisdom his own wisdom a beautiful sacrifice he had the flowers he had the foot of the field surely god will receive my sacrifice i built a lovely altar i have it so pretty so decorated just like this this easter will be and they'll spend millions of dollars across the nation to put easter flowers on some altars the altar wasn't made for flowers it's for sacrifice and he said you just showed the same old spirit of cain he said the same old devil from eden and he said what happened and he said you know that the man was sincere because it meant life or death to him and then people don't think they're hypocrites they're sincere yeah but sincerely wrong and he said that don't do it it's truth not sincerity amen then them women over there in africa sacrificed their little babies to gods the alligators are you that sincere that you would make that sacrifice listen he said you won't receive nothing but his word amen grace of god amen i'll finish with this quote people don't want to suffer and that's what's the matter today they come right now and believe this word if they didn't have to get out of their church if they didn't have to be laughed at made fun of no they want botany life some kind of a wisdom well this life is just as good as that and he said i'll show you where that comes from just a minute the lord willing able by what abel by faith came by knowledge but able by faith offered god the more excellent sacrifice by faith in what in god amen he had faith in the word because he wanted to know why he was out of that garden amen notice by faith abel saw the revelation and brought a living running blood because life was in the blood life is in the stem of the flower and it's botany life which has no feeling i i was in hopes that that would soak in amen able by faith staying with the word by faith not by wisdom by faith each seen that it was sex blood the blood cell comes from the male amen and he said adam know that it wasn't apples or peaches or potatoes or whatever it was that brought them out of the garden of eden he said it was sex blood and he offered blood back by faith he done it not by wisdom amen i was a man through wisdom going to understand when the whole bible and the whole church of god is built upon divine revelation by faith amen and will make him get away from his organization he's got wisdom so he just stays with it amen just one more quote i think amen he said you can have all the word and you can know that word from a to z and it will never work for you have you seen man take that word and try to make it work and say brother glory to god it just won't work you can't fool with the word amen no matter what you profess the word testifies of itself no matter what you claim the word gives testimony amen god help us if jesus defeated satan upon the faith knowing who he was he was predestined a predestinated creature what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ now you believe their brides predestinated and he said the predestinated bride of christ now amen he said the church the word seed amen everything that god promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it and he said everything's in order and the holy spirit's been given the seed's been sown and he said the evening lights have been shining the sign of sodom that jesus promised his ear malachi 4 a predestinated church and church of the living god here and on tape he said do you know where you stand do you know that you are called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart and every word of god is real to you amen thank god brother anything we stay with is the word anything we want more and more is the word amen brother if we got faith i'll tell you this we're gonna we're gonna live the word or if you've got real faith genuine faith you're gonna focus on the word what the bible say what's the bible say what's the bible say you'll always go back to the bible you always go back to the word amen it is written oh thank the lord amen thank you lord praise the lord so i pray the grace of god to give us the faith perfect faith in the perfect revelation of his word amen god bless you let's stand amen let's say 427 when
