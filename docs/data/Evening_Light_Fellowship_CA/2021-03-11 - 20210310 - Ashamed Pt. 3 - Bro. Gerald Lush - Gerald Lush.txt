grace of your presence to be with us and yes lord in us and the grace of your presence around us the grace of your presence moving here and lord moving among those that are online praying in the name of jesus lord that as we will be subject to you here that they will be subject to you there lord as they will know that you're with them there lord as we know that you are with us here and father amen it is by that simple faith of believing what you said amen that you would never leave us nor forsake us amen and believing lord that we're two or three are gathered together in your presence there you are in the midst and believing lord that you gathered us here you gather those in their homes tonight amen and help us lord to believe you're here help us to believe you are there amen you're there to hear our prayer you're there to hear our worship you're there lord to respond amen and to grant us what we have need of so we pray for that anointing in a soul body and spirit and lord there's not one of us without a need so we pray lord that you're there to meet that need father hallelujah father again lord and let it be according to the faith lord to the revelation that you have given them to the revelation that you have given us amen and lord that we believe what revelation you gave we believe what you have said we believe lord that you will not will be here you are here amen so lord i believe lord that you will not hear what not just so you might hear what we're saying you hear what we're saying amen so i trust lord by grace in the name of jesus by grace lord that we're offering our praise and worship and prayers unto you amen with the faith of your presence with the faith lord that you hear us amen with the faith lord that the promise is made that you never leave us nor forsake us so grace help us to move on and move forward in these last days that we believe god that we believe jesus amen lord you promised you'd never leave us never forsake us and lord is that faith that we have tonight amen whether it's the father just the four or five of us here and with us the others in their homes lord online in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray the grace of god and the moving of your spirit lord to meet our needs amen and to encourage us to keep pressing on grace grace in the name of our lord jesus christ and yes lord that grace to forgive us of our mistakes that grace to forgive us of wrong thoughts wrong words wrong deeds amen that will give you the glory the honor the praise in all circumstances in all situations all for the glory of god amen in the name of our lord in the name of our savior jesus christ amen and amen praise the lord god bless us amen and where there's those here or those online they would turn with me to the in the bible to the mark chapter eight as and against the scriptures we're reading that maybe we've already read them in a previous service concerning the message of a shame that the prophet preached in 1965 and i want us by endeavor by the grace of god to bring the thoughts on on the message to a conclusion tonight so be in prayer and bear with me as we go into the word amen and again yes those that are present and those that are online the grace of god and surely that they'll be more relaxed and that i oh yeah since they they're at home maybe i can preach longer amen because they they got everything around them to attempt to to uh keep them occupied so i trust that they were going to be more occupied with the word and less occupied with our surroundings by the grace of god so it's a tremendous challenge for the ministry whether it's me or some other brother brother preaching in ministry or brother jonathan my and we get up here and and we preach to two or three people three or four amen amen but by grace what keeps us moving is the spirit that's pulling on the lord and pulling for the word amen and he's here to bring the word where there's two or three here amen or and but again he knows who's listening he knows who will hear it amen maybe somebody online and maybe not just the members of the assembly but it could be somebody else in another country so we pray the grace of god to bring the word a reality to their souls amen as uh receiving an email from my brother again this week and he wanted to know this and this and this he said brother just if you could just explain it and i explained something and oh and then to me it was just a testimony like and they came back said oh praise the lord that's wonderful oh my thank god and i said well lord bless him i said that o lord that he'll have the same testimony i have amen of the grace of god amen and he wanted that he wanted to to know you know what do we do how far do we go in working with unbelievers and you know they're not christians they're not this they're not that and i said well come down the basics brother i said regardless of what they believe i said you're just going to live what you believe amen and keep your attitude right your spirit right amen and again and again he did i like the scripture and where it is written that you know where paul encouraged him to do this and do that and do what he say if you're working out there for unbelievers or for sinners he said you do it as unto the lord amen amen so that's the reason why you got to do this unto the lord i so you can reflect i said you're new you're a new creature now you're born again and you're going to do this not just for man you're doing it for jesus amen and you're going to play you want to please jesus because if you please jesus i said you'll please the one you're working for amen and that's the truth so god bless our brother and the brother that was in question is uh he's uh in india and i've been in contact with him for a little while but i pray god bless him and god give him more of the holy ghost in his heart and soul amen the amen about telling brother we're going to reflect christ in what we do brother we've got to have the holy ghost because it is christ in us the hope of glory and you know if we got the holy ghost oh praise the lord if he's in control of your heart your soul you're a new creature in christ amen brother it's just it's automatic i don't have to force the issue i just die die to myself more alive to to the anointing and amen if you've got the anointing and the anointing is in control you're going to reflect jesus amen most definitely you're going to reflect the salvation that you're claiming to have and to god be the glory amen so the lord bless us and be in prayer for one another lord help us don't let us get so caught up that we're going to hesitate in reflecting jesus that we're going to get to the place lord so caught up with the world that we're going to get to the place that we're just going to reflect the old nature no no that new creature is dead the whole creature is dead let the new creature have control by the grace of god and brother if he does have control and it's not just coming out with this doctrine that doctrine i believe this i believe this i believe that it's there if we all praise the lord the devil believes it but the thing of it is are you reflecting the life of that word amen so is he in you is he in control not reflecting doctrine it's reflecting jesus amen because he in the beginning was the word amen and he was the word and so on and the word was made flesh and the words may flesh on you and me amen brother let's reflect the word and the word brother it comes down to the will of god amen you're going to reflect the will of god for your life for this hour for this age amen so i pray grace that we're going to be truly truly dead to ourselves but alive unto him amen and that he is in control even in your net doing what you got to do in your natural life as as that brother was inquiring about about it his job and and and what does what did paul me mean there when he spoke to timothy about this and go out and he said well they said you you grow and you work yourself in this do you work in that he said as unto the lord why because if you're doing it it enters unto the lord i'm sure your boss is going to be pleased amen because why your heart is going to be in it by the grace of god i thank god for the witness that he has he has helped me to do amen as i've said you know i'm working and the people would know that i was christian there i don't know why because not not because of of anything religious that i was talking about not by any means but they they would look at and they would see what i was doing how i was doing it and so on and i remember one time that that i was just in in that area and that area that i was just stood up in a certain part of well it was a it was a store just a certain part of the store and one of the managers came out and says mr lush i said yes they said my i i'm shocked that i to see you just standing here you're usually always find something to do and you're always doing this doing that well i said now i'm getting others to help me and i said i tell them what to do i tell them what to do so now i'm just waiting for them to do it and i'll and i'll i'll go and compliment on it for them amen now well he said i'll tell you what we want now they said we want you to teach them amen the others in in in the the store there the business they wanted me to go teach them what to do how to do it when to do it where to do it so on and i said okay i'll do it no problem and so i just they just said all right take half of them into the room and talk to them okay i said as you whatever you need so brother it's reflecting the attitude of jesus it's reflecting the attitude of our lord our savior oh yeah you're reflecting his spirit what would he do amen brother oh yeah what would he do brother he would he would just live the word and go on and he was doing it for the glory of god and he's teaching us to do the same amen you got a job go do it for the glory of god amen and reflecting the christian life not that you're going to be witnessing about this witnessing about this doctrine that doctor no no brother sister if god is looking for anything he's looking for his life in you oh yes most definitely are you reflecting his life maybe he's even to your neighbor or whatever oh yeah again we thank the lord for the witness that we gave when we were living on that street they were in in uh yeah mockingbird drive amazing and uh and i was shocked that when others the others came back and said oh this they knew this they knew that oh yeah they said we knew we knew you were a christian and so on it wasn't because we're going to church on sunday or wednesdays or because why because of our attitude toward everybody else that would come and go that we would meet a man now of course of course too it's like i said in wintertime i'd go out and i would i would do not just my driveway i'd do four or five driveways you know and so on and they said what in the world he doing that for why i think that's what jesus would do oh yes jesus would do that if he had if he had the uh the the strength and the encouragement if he had the especially the equipment now he goes he do this he do this he do this amen amen it's doing it as unto the lord by the grace of god amen so let's be in prayer for one another that we let go and let god have his way amen and that brother it's christ in you amen brother i don't care what your job is he he's going to teach you how to do it amen and well brother he's going to get you to do it the way you should do it with the right attitude right spirit right motive right objective amen do it for the glory of god and i'm sure you'll be you'll be you'll please your boss amen god bless you again let's read in matthew no mark was it mark chapter 8 amen praise the lord amazing there are our emphasis on the word of god and we pray the grace of god that the word will live in us amen in mark chapter 8 and beginning to read you see they started to read at verse 27 and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am amen. and they answered john the baptist and some say elias and others one of the prophets who do they say that you are amen and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ amen and he charged them that they should tell no man of him and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again amazing that he had the revelation of who he was and where he came from and what he was to do and what was to happen to him amen brother he kept going that the scriptures be fulfilled not my will father time be thine be done amen and brother if you got the holy ghost you're gonna have the same attitude the same prayer amen not my will father thyme be done and he spake that saying openly and peters took him and began to rebuke him but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men brother because there was a came to a place in their relationship with jesus that they were ashamed of what was going on and they walked away amen but peter was there to deny him openly amen god help us that we're going to stay with the word amen scripture has got to be fulfilled in your life scripture got to be fulfilled in in this assembly amen and in whichever way god wants to do it let him do it we're not going to be ashamed we're going to take our stand for jesus amen so when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou saver is not the things that be of god amen the revelation of this revelation of that but not the revelation of what god was doing and how god was going to do it amen and again in verse 34 and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself amen anyone you've got to deny to serve christ is yourself to serve the body you got to deny self amen the devil is there to get you to pay attention on yourself you you you should do this you should do that make sure it's god's leadership not my will father thine be done amen and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself amen and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will shall lose his life for my sake amen and the gospels the same shall save it amen so that it's not you doing it it's god in you doing it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul amazing or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels you may be seated god bless his word amen trust me we're not ashamed of him lest he be ashamed of us amen and it is the grace of god in us to give us the the courage to take our stand for jesus it is the grace of god in us to give us the courage amen to take our stand for the word by the grace of god amen he wants us to focus on him but brother to focus on him is to focus on the word by the grace of god because he was the word and flesh and now he has come to make you and me the word in flesh by the grace of god amen turn with me to another scripture amen in ii timothy again chapter 1. i'm going to read the scriptures try to keep the comments down low so i can give you more and more of the quotes the things that the prophet said in the message ashamed amen well why why would he preach it well i believe god ordained it and i believe god permitted it and i believe that the prophet of god a man recognized the need for it a man not only just out there in the world but brother is needful around message believers amen because again the prophet of god was preaching this in tucson i believe he was given his a report first of his trip to africa amen and then he got into the word and yes he was ministering it to his own church it's amazing the things that brother branham ministered to his own church the ministry things that he ministered to believers and we we maybe would never think that that he would have to deal with that in his own church but i've already highlighted that there are other messages that he preached and they were strong and they were hard and yet boy he preached it because he was dealing with those spirits in his own assembly again somewhere that's amazing but they they all believe the old william branham was it was a it was a set of god he was a messenger from god and some i guess believed that he was a prophet but yet when he preached church order it's amazing the number that left brenham tabernacle and went on to another brother's church and it was about eight miles away now why in the world would you leave the prophet's church if you believe william if you believed in your heart that william branham was a prophet and that amen and what he was preaching was a god a man it was god in the prophet it was god with the anointing amen to to get the prophet to preach what needed to be preached amen and he knew that they needed it in his own church amen and again at the same time no doubt maybe that he knew that there is the end result of preaching that that message it was going to cause those to leave the church not all of them but it caused many of them to leave and again we know again as i said that our brother level not leaving no brother neville brother as i said when brother manuel and some other newfoundlanders went down to the to the united states to visit jeffersonville and to attend the branham tabernacle and brother neville took brother manuel out to out to a restaurant for a meal and of course he asked the question don't forget it he asked the question why did brother branham preach church order well the problem of god said well i guess he just he just wanted them to do this and wanted to do that and maybe they were leaving this out and saying brother no he said he preached church order he said to to to put those with with false gifts he said down why because they were during the song service they were speaking in tongues giving interpretation they were doing this they were doing that they'd get up they gave their testimony in the audience in the congregation and they would go on and on and on and and brother neville or or brother branham whoever was there to minister they had to wait and wait and wait until that's so that testimony meaning came to an end until they stopped giving all those gifts you know the the the message in tongues the message interpretation amen and he said to gracie that's why the prophet did it and he said because he said those that were proclaiming to have these gifts he said it was a false anointing amen and he said that's why the prophet was bringing it to an end and not only that they stopped testimony meetings because they had a testimony meeting amen and it would go on for maybe an hour maybe two hours and the preacher will be waiting amen i've experienced that myself amen in the in the tabernacle the church that was in central newfoundland it's not there now it's gone but again i've been there and not just not to preach but i've been there just to listen to the pastor and brother as i said that he be sitting on the platform there in a chair and he'd be sitting with his bible and his notes and wait and wait and wait amen and he may have to wait for an hour or hour and a half amen till the testimony meeting was finished amen why what were they doing well they would get up and they go on and on and on and on amen and basically they were preaching oh yeah they had this thought so they wanted to share it with everybody else another one had this thought wanted to share it with the congregation instead of leaving it to the pastor and again even when we had the open-air services and i remember approaching the brother that was or organizing that open-air service and i said brother i said don't have any testimony meeting i said don't invite anyone to come up to testify i said because they're going to take too long and i said that's not right i said to to have to express express this i said to them maybe the maybe a 100 or 200 people out there just gathered just for the for the open air service not believers but they were religious and i said so i said don't have a testimony meeting amen so i said have you got this to say and this to do i should do it but i said remember i said now i said only take a half hour and i said then i turn it over to the pastor for minister the word amen so brother again brother brown dealt with those things in his own church so he had to preach against this he had to preach against that he had to set this in order and that in order amen brother but again we can go too far the other way and not have anything to say and not worship god amen by the grace of god so i pray that oh yeah because i've experienced that too amen in in the churches that maybe that i i've ministered in and i'm not just talking about newfoundland but again i ministered as i said in in ontario i ministered in in new brunswick i ministered in even in alberta and so on and so and i oh yeah i i did give up and give a short testimony because i was invited to in british columbia but he wanted me to preach but i i said no i said i won't preach i'll just give you a few minutes amen amen so god help us that we're going to we're going to be led by the spirit and we're going to put our emphasis on the word amen whether it's the going forth of the word or the hearing and receiving of the word amen and this is what god's looking at in you and in me well for me he's looking at the going forth of the word am i surrendering to the leadership of the holy ghost and to want to speak the word preach the word that he wants me to preach amen so then it's not me it's him amen and and then god is also looking at you and god is judging you and not just those three here in the congregation or for amen but even though it's online brother when we get together for the hearing of the word get together to a man to worship god what are we putting the emphasis on we ought to be putting the answers on the word of god amen because through christ the word is revealed to us amen and that jesus is revealing himself to us through the word amen so brothers not just oh that's the preacher that's the preacher it's jesus amen this he is why because he has he has ordained it that god has said in the church these these these well it's for the ministry's sake and and but it's to reveal christ amen and to give us the faith that pleases god amen and not just sitting there and saying well i believe the message and i believe god said i prove it yeah but what's it it what's what is the effect it's having in your life amen does it have a control of you amen are you controlling it amen there are many brothers that in many a church they're controlling the word they're controlling the preacher they're controlling this this this they want it done this way they want to believe it this way but brother you got to believe that it's god in control and you're here to hear the word of god amen not just to think oh yeah oh yeah they don't believe that out there we believe it yeah what's it doing for you amen amen what effect is it having in your life does is the word controlling you amen and brother that's why god is doing it he fought for laying at the word lay out the word laid the word through a fightful ministry what for so that they'll surrender more and more to the word the word is going to control you the word is going to control me amen it controls what you do how you do it when you do it where you do it amen it's going to troll your attitude in your spirit amen but what is going to keep it all for the glory of god amen to keep you in the spirit to keep you under the control of the word amen sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen and now is the spirit going to delete us by the word amen he's going to get us to keep lining up with the word keep lining up with the word keep believing what the word wants us to believe and what is it god wants us to believe now until in this hour god wants us to believe for the resurrection god wants us to believe for the rapture brother luther had to believe what god gave him and wesley had to believe what god gave him the pentecostals had to believe what god gave them amen but now what's he given us is the revelation of the resurrect the end time and what are we going to see in the end it is the resurrection and the rapture amen brother and then and believers are going to be calling for the resurrection arming and thirsting for the resurrection but because i tell you luther and the lutherans they hungered and they thirsted for the revelation of justification amen as the others in wesley as the pentecostals i know it i experienced it back there back there many years ago that they were hungering and they were thirsting for the gifts amen and the baptism of the holy ghost and it was all for the glory of god brother back there in the early days when i was identified with the pentecostals then they weren't old brother they weren't glorifying themselves they were glorifying this glorifying that where they were giving the glory to god amen because the gifts came from god and the gifts came from jesus the baptism of the holy ghost was god himself amen acknowledging amen your faith and confirming your faith by bringing you into a new birth amen so that is not christ outside is christ inside amen it is the holy ghost on the inside of the inside amen brother he had control of you if you're reading he has control of you if you're doing this you're doing that amen oh yeah you can't forget him no way again as i said is i've i worked there and worked there worked there amen but i tell you i wanted jesus with me i said lord don't leave me don't leave me lord i need you so lord and and don't let me forget you and lord if if i go too long without thinking about you i said i pray for the conviction of the holy ghost in my heart amen and he's there to convict us you know bring us back to christ there to connect us to get to get to talking with him and pray by the grace of god see whatever you do again you're led by the spirit of god amen and we're anointed by the holy ghost to do it and to do it the way that god wants us to do it amen put your heart your soul your spirit into it and as i told that gentleman and i said brother i said listen i said i just went and just lived for god and i wasn't talking about god i wasn't doing this i wasn't doing that but again there are others that would come and say oh uh you're a christian are you yes but what do you mean oh he said not what you said it's it's it's your it's the life you're living here oh me yes you if they said i thought i knew you're a christian and i've had people where i was working and i've had others just come and one minute wait a minute yeah oh i said i wanna thank you for being a christian oh what oh brothers to god be the glory that the number of times that in those places where i work they wanted to identify and say look listen he's a christian don't worry he's a christian what are you what you want him to do he'll do it and he'll do it right amen so a brother to god be the glory amen and that is the truth i don't know how many people that have come to me when i worked oh you're you're a christian that's why you do this that's why we know you're different you're you're you're in your attitude and how you express yourself and how you you treat others and so on i said well i said i i'm i'm just doing the way that i feel that i should do it and it should be done and i said it's not me in control this is i guess it must be the christian spirit yes they said i believe that amen so he said keep at it we trust you and we we appreciate it yeah and they were they were from other churches and and there was one there was one of them that i was working for and he was manager and and i'm sure that is not very far from here that that he lived huh maybe i ministered to him online yeah and i worked with him for a number of years that's by the grace of god amen so brother i trust that they're going to see christ in you amen they're going to see the gospel in you they're going to see christianity in you brother's not not not into a christian church or he's a christian because he goes that church he goes no you're a christian if you're a christian you're in the word and the word is in you by the grace of god amen let's give god the glory amen as again as i said one time and there were there was some things going on in the place i was working in and they were worried about this and worried about that and they said listen i'm coming to you because someone said no you're a christian go to him oh what for oh well we got this problem what can you can you do i said well all i can do is pray i'll pray about it amen well good they say good good because we need it amen so they respected me so brother go forth and that you're not you're not you're not forcing this issue and that issue you're not getting trying to get them interested in this church in that church no you're pointing them to jesus amen and not pointing them to martin luther or john wesley or or william booth no or william branham no we're playing them to jesus amen and brother i'm sure that's what william branham wanted you to do that's pointing to jesus amen and that's sure that's that's what william booth wanted them to do plan to jesus i know that amen because amen by the grace of god i'm old enough to go back and i tasted of of the pet or the early pentecostals i've tasted of the early salvationists and this church in that church amen amen it was god amen or anointing and anointing them in that hour to give preeminence to him and give preeminence to his word it's not just to be a christian brother you got to come back and put it in the word amen so that so that they'll know they're not back here they're not in the middle of the book we're at the end of the book amen and brother he's got he's going to raise up a generation that knows it that believes it and that are living for it amen so brother i tell you that we're going we're going to have a greater hunger and greater thirst for resurrection than luther or wesley or the pentecostals amen oh yes because why because this is the hour when god has created that hunger and thirst because this is the hour of the resurrection this is the hour of the rapture but because the next thing in line for god and the gentiles is the resurrection and rapture amen the next thing in life for the jews amen is the mystery of god to call the 144 000. praise the oh brother are we living constantly with those thoughts and these revelations oh lord we believe it we believe it oh god hallelujah and we pay attention when we hear something going on over in israel we hear something going on here there amen brother we're going to hear it through the ears of god amen i tell you it's going to strike us in a way that it don't strike the world up there well they'll know this is happening that's happening amen but for the believer for a real question you look you heard you saw this it's the word oh lord it brings us back to the word oh yes not church oh not just the idea oh i guess i guess god's doing that yeah but brother if you're if you're of god you're going to know the word amen that it's not over here it's back here amen it's the end and brother with that revelation of the end it really puts us on our guard and we're serious amen oh yes we're not just out there at all praise the lord hallelujah one wonderful wonder no no we're going to be sober and serious by the grace of god yeah what god did for luther they could shout and scream and and do what they they felt to do because oh wonderful we've been lifted up and in the in the lutherans and methodists god left them up again amen the pentecostals they were closer to god amen i'm praising the lord more well i tell you the bride is closer amen we're closer to the resurrection and the rapture amen and the marriage suffered the lamb i pray that the rapture and the resurrection the marriage of the life is as real to us as justification was to martin luther amen sanctification to the others amen that brother that it that it's it's as real to us as as it was to win a booth this old-fashioned salvation army amen and it's real to us as the gifts of the baptism was to the early pentecostals praise the lord amen they lived it amen morning noon and night amen they were worshiping it praising god hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord for the baptism thank you for the gifts amen praise god lord it shows that you you're getting closer to us amen and we're getting closer to you yeah they were but the next thing in line they never caught the revelation amen oh the prophet what was what was he endeavoring to do oh brother go you go through 1965 64 63 amen and you just type in rapture and to see how much he's talking about and the resurrection see how much he's putting the answers on resurrection rapture because amen luther had put the answers on justification amen the pentecostals had to put the emphasis on the baptism and the gifts amen oh yeah but now we've gone beyond that we thank god for it praise the lord we got justified justified we're sanctified we're filled with the holy ghost we have access to the gifts the prophets of god he said god had cut the gifts they're still there he said they're on the shelf and he said if we need them we're there amen but pentecost put the emphasis on the gifts but now the bride she know she knows the gifts are there and for if god wanted to use this gift or that gift amen but what he wants us to do is put our emphasis on the rapture put our emphasis on the resurrection amen amen praise the lord brother god put the emphasis on on justification and brother morning noon and night they were praying they were crying for amen sanctification justification amen thank you lord thank you hallelujah because they were cut up amen that was the burden for the that they were bearing for in their in their age the burden of justification the burden of sanctification the burden of dying to self and becoming more alive to god and get the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost the day of pentecost amen that that was that was the anointing amen in their lives and that's what it produced what's it producing in us amen amen oh brother sister i trust amen that we come to this word recognizing the end time come to this word recognizing thus said the lord amen the prophet of god amen to call us out of darkness and into the light the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen amen yes justification saying the vacation the gifts of the spirit the baptism amen praise the lord but don't stop there amen you've got to go on if you're a bride you will go on amen understand this and and i'm thankful that it was such a blessing to some of the believers when i mention it that there's many called if you're chosen that's right but by the but the cult is not lost amen because we were led to we were led to believe oh and it was a teaching oh my you know if you don't believe this message you're lost no no you don't believe this message you're not predestinated to a resurrection and a rapture you're not predestinated to the marriage of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen and the marriage supper of the lamb no amen brother all praise the lord but the bride is going to go in and experience this the bride's going to experience that amen but the others are not lost no not by any maze they're going to be there brother sister oh my let's hear the word of the lord that the bible says oh yeah there was the marriage of the bridegroom and the bride amen and there were thousands upon thousands upon thousands who witnessed it amen and they're not lost amen the bible says they went back but it says after the thousand years they're gonna come forward again and they're gonna they're gonna be saved amen the bride is going to be in the throat in the city but they're going to be outside the city praise the lord amen why god's not willing that any should perish and yet you didn't you got you had christians and or if the person don't believe this don't believe that they're not here they're not there or they're lost no not lost definitely not god knows who they are amen just that they're not bright so i pray grace that we are bright i pray grace that we have received and are receiving amen the message that's giving us rapturing faith and go back again type in rapturing faith amen and you'll find out the prophet is emphasizing this end time message this end time revelation is to give us rapturing faith amen it's amazing the number of times that he is putting the emphasis on the revealed word putting the episodes on the revelation of the mystery of god amen brother because we got the revelation of god as our lord our savior amen yes the baptizer with the holy ghost our justifier our sanctifier amen and we got the revelation of him as our bridegroom amen oh yes amen not everybody got the revelation that he's their bridegroom oh he's my lord and he's my savior good praise the lord keep moving on amen but what is he to us he's revealed as our lord our savior amen and there comes in a closer relationship amen and he's revealed to me and you as our bridegroom amen that we are part of the bride amen and we we we were in engaged to him amen and god did this and god did that but then we enter into a relationship with him amen true intimate relationship amen uh praise the lord what does that relationship bring forth a revelation of him amen amen does not again it's like that brother approached me and people don't realize when it comes to a relationship that that's that's what they call it you know really sealed seal the relationship and the prophet of god said oh he said we'll we'll meet him there he said in the kitchen and we'll feed on his word then he said we go into the living room and fellowship with him amen but he said that's not the end the end is the bedroom amen where he said we're united with him and our relationship becomes one by the grace of god amen that's that's that's the reference to it most people don't realize that amen but brother it was to a lot of people oh he is my lord he is my savior amen but is he is is he your break room amen have you become intimate so that you're you're living for him amen and you got such a relationship you entered into a oneness and now you're reflecting is why he put his seed in you not deceived was in your heart but he put the anointing there to quicken the seed amen you needed the life amen to quicken the seed praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen so that amen identified us as the bride the bridegroom has a bride but not all are bright understand that again there is the wise virgin there is the foolish virgin and the prophet of god said and a brother did write me again a message believer for many years and he said got a question brother and he said is de bruyne is the wise virgin going to be in heaven and is she proud of the bride i said no she's not part of the bride but i said she's going to be in glory amen the bride is going to be in the city with the bridegroom the the i said that's the wise virgins but the foolish virgins are going to be outside the city and the problem of god said remember he said they're not lost amen he said praise the lord no he said they're virgins he says wise they got the revelation of the word amen then the foolish he said they got a revelation but only go so far they don't go as far as the bride amen god god gave it to us god gave it to the bride so that when the invitation came amen to enter into with them oneness in the bridal chamber amen praise the lord she entered in the wise she recognized what was going on amen but the others never recognized what you and i are recognizing amen but we leave them with the lord because they're the problem of god said and remember he said they're foolish virgins but he said remember they are persians amen and and those that are in this hour and this is the foolish virgins in this age he said they they'll be ordained to go on through the tribulation the great tribulation and they will lay down their lives amen for jesus amen but he said they're like they say they're not lost because their brother wrote emailed me and i said all right brother he said i got a question is the foolish virgins in the bride is the foolish virgin part of the bride no they're not pride the bride i said that is the wise amen but i said don't don't put the foolish one down because they're going to be there amen because it is it's recorded there in in the book of revelation amen that oh they're right there to to give the glory to the bridegroom and the bride when they're united yeah but the bible says now they're they're taken off the sea once it's done they're taking off the scene well the bride's going to well that'll be a great tribulation amen but the bride is going to go in the rapture amen amen amen god help us to believe who we are and why we're here and where we're going amen and again as it struck me when when our brother jonathan he made me made mention of the the problem of god having been gone for 55 years and so on i said yeah that's amazing 55 years amen and i said lord we're still here but lord i believe we're getting getting closer and closer to the end when we consider what's going on in the world now when we consider what's going on around the world concerning concerning the kobit 19 issue i said lord it's finished it truly is finished oh my brother no doubt the problem of god saw it not only that brother he saw a a lot of other things that's why he said he said when i go he said what he meant when he go go to his grave he said there will be a much in his heart that he won't reveal amen there are things that he knew was going to happen but he wouldn't tell us amen but he i believe that god would reveal it to us and god is revealing it to us and when it happens brother we got we got the holy ghost in us we know we don't have to figure this out figure that out it'll strike us lord that's another sign that we're at the end that's another sign lord that we're getting closer to the climax of the resurrection and the rapture amen and again be on your guard live in the spirit walk in the spirit so that brother you're going to be what when when the dead in christ begins to arise it kind of appear to us we're going to know them we'll recognize them yeah and again it's like i said they're about that that conversion that testimony that that the a child had went beyond the curtain of time eight or nine years ago i think and uh and he's oh yeah the rezeals was an accident and his father got killed in the accident but the boy got put into uh over he went off and unconscious in the hospital but his father was killed amen but then after after a number of hours or maybe a day or so and the doctor thought he was going to go told the mother he was going to die but then after a few hours things happen and they said oh no i think he'll he'll be back it seems like it amen but things were going on and he was having an experience and they they could see the movements or there's something going on but he wasn't conscious of them amen but when he came back he said oh he said daddy is in heaven so he must have known he got killed in the accident he wasn't surprised to him always that i saw daddy in heaven yeah and he saw this one in heaven that one and evan oh yes he said i saw my two brothers and as i said that was the two or a brother and sister and and that was the two that his mother lost as infant children infant babies yeah she was expecting them but when they came near the hour to deliver them they died and and she just gave birth to it but they were dead but the mother was shocked when he said i saw my brother and sister in heaven she was shocked because she thought they'd be out there in the grave somewhere no as i said you don't worship out there you've got to worship just thank god for the resurrection thank god for the rapture amen because i said they're not out there as just dust and dust you are so dust you shall return amen we're not interested in the dust amen but he said i'm going to give you a new body by the grace of god amen so brother i pray grace oh it was real to him i pray is that real to us amen brother no matter how old he is now he's not going to doubt it he's not going to wonder oh i wish dad was there no he wouldn't want dad to come back he wouldn't want his brother sister to come back amen to come back out of heaven to come back out of glory amen and into this whole world no brother there was a time when when they lived in this world and they just thank god for the revelation that they had in this world but brother as it went on and on and on they were hungry that the seed of god was longing and thirsting for more and more and more faith to finally there's they were their eyes were set on the resurrection set on the rapture amen oh lord we want it now we want it now amen and when they when this happened in the world that happened in the world it just caused them to look up and cry and hunger and thirst more and more for the change by the grace of god amen praise the name of the lord god help us in my prayer amen oh my first timothy again is it second timothy chapter one my i'm going to have to get into the quotes second timothy chapter 1 and verse 6. i think we read this before wherefore i put thee in remembrance amen and god is putting us in remembrance of of what we need to be we need to remember amen i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god stir it up say with the word pay more attention to the word amen stay mooring amen in fellowship with jesus amen and brother you'll stir up what he's doing in your heart amen and he said thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee but at putting on of my hands praise the lord for god has not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind amen sir brother he hasn't given us the spirit of fear concerning what's going on in the world amen but he has given us just the spirit of power of love and of a sound mind are we missing it or experiencing it amen the power of god the love of god and a sound mind we know where we come from we know where we're going do god be the glory we march on amen there are some of the world but i think you're crazy but that's all right just keep on going by grace amen and it says be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord brother don't be afraid of what god has done and what god is doing amen oh my there are those that would be ashamed because they feel over you know we're not living in that hour like that god wouldn't show us that god would just ask us to believe this and go on no god's asking you to believe it but hunger and thirst for it amen if you got the revelation of it in your heart you hunger and thirst amen because luther hungered and thirst for justification he added in his heart hunger longer and thirst for some sanctification amen so now god is working on the hunger and thirst for the resurrection and rapture that's what he wants us to call for and again again and again and again the prophet said amen you got to want to you want to go you got to want to go not just think oh yeah that'd be all right that'd be good no i want to god you've got to hunger for it you've got to thirst for it by the grace of god amen and he should be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord the testament of jesus for the bride is that he's a bright room amen he's our lord your savior but brother he's brought us into a more personal relationship with him amen that we are we are the bride and he's the bright girl oh my praise the lord amen so he said be not ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me is prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god amen brother wesley or luther he had the power of god in his heart justified he had the power of sanctification wesley and the and the pentecostals and the power anointing of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amazing why and he went on as you go on god is doing doing this god's doing this god's doing that in his seed amen they bring forth this they bring forth death oh and after the gifts and the anointing amen the baptism of the holy ghost it is christ coming down to become one with his bride amen in the baptism of the holy ghost we needed that and we need it amen now right on into the resurrection and rapture it's finished amen so be thou partaker oh my be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god are you going to oh you're going to pray god help me to be a greater and a greater partaker of the afflictions of the gospel amen that the more that the world hates it the more we're going to love it and take our stand for it amen who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose amen and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began amen praise the lord we're here not because of what he did in your life a few years ago we're here because of what he did before the foundation of the world it was predestinated as i said that pentecostal pastor oh my they come and he said oh brother he said explain to me he said predestination and the will of god and that way i said to that pentecostal pastor and that catholic neighbor asked me and so on and he said pastor he said listen you people preach predestination god predestinated this this and this he said you mean tell me god decided to send this person to heaven and the other one to hell no i said that's the choice they made it was based on god's foreknowledge before the foundational world he saw the choice you would make he saw the choice i would make and i said based on that choice he predestinated you through calvary he predestinated you to eternal life and the other one i said i had no respect for it so i said he predestinated that one to hell oh yeah i'll tell you when they wake up they're not still not interested they still don't love him they still don't want this and that oh it's like again the bible they're in the revelation and it says oh god these these rose up and they looked and and they saw jesus and they started to cry for the rocks and the mountains fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne amazing amen you think they'll be calling on him forgive us lord have mercy no they didn't love him no the spirit in them wasn't good wasn't right amen so i said brother god he's i said predestination is based on his foreknowledge i said what did he see you do before you did it before the foundation of the world oh oh he said brother thank you praise the lord he said that's wonderful he said i believe that i can see that yeah and yet another time i was in a pentecost church and i heard the bastard go up there and he preached about predestination and he condemned it oh yeah he said they're out there they're saying god predestinated this predestinated that he said ah he said that's not god oh yeah but he didn't have the that pastor never had the revelation of of foreknowledge i trust by grace brother he saw you and me amen and he sees and you know what before the foundation of the world he saw us here he saw us maintaining our testimony and our faith amen even even in the in the light of what's going on around the world yeah there are those that wouldn't bother amen and there are believers there there's many a believer today brothers that are lukewarm they're not hot they're not cold they're lukewarm in their faith amen or they they they're just like denominations out there they got that attitude got that spirit and again there are denominational people out there christians out there they got they got a better spirit and respect for the lord than believers you know because they're believers oh i just believe the message and i'll go on oh but they're not into it they're not hungry and thirsty like the lutherans did like the methodists like the old fashioned salvation army like the old-fashioned pentecostals hunger and thirst for the fellowship of the sons and daughters of god amen praise the name of the lord god help us amen so brother again let me encourage us not be not therefore ashamed don't be ashamed of the message don't be ashamed of taking your stand for the word don't be ashamed of laying your life down for jesus you're going to live for jesus live for jesus live for jesus amen you're going to do what jesus wants you to do amen you're going to do the will of god not your will his will amen so don't be ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me as prisoner but be the partakers of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who has saved us called us with a holy calling and not according to our works amen oh no but according to his own purpose amen is god using you to work out and manifest his purpose for your life amen why did god call you was why are you under the under the the message of the hour amen it because you you decided or did god bring you in there amen it's god when we consider our brother joseph and brother weissel it's amazing how those things happen god have mercy amen to god be the glory but he said again he said let us let us serve him he said him who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works it might be religious works but no but according to his own purpose it's not what we want to do what he what he wants us to do amen brother he has predestinated us for this purpose he's predestined us to be here he's producing us to be a witness of the message amen praise the lord amen and we're here because we're yielding to his leadership by grace he said according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began amen wonderful but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality amen to light through the gospel whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles for which cause i also suffered these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day amen our faith is in the revealed word of god our faith is in the calling of god amen not the calling of a church not the calling of a denomination amen not a religious calling but a spiritual call in our lives amen grace by the grace of god help us lord to go through and reflect the life of jesus and brother there are certain things that he will allow to happen in your life certain things he will allow to happen in in in the life of all believers he allowed it in william branham and brother he allows it in us to to test our faith amen to bring out faith in this situation are you going to go and just try to figure it out yourself or you're going to say lord i need your help and i need your wisdom i need your understanding lord what's the purpose of this help me lord if i'm out of your will help me to get back in your will you know oh yes you're going to deal with god on it he's going to deal with you and he allows these things to happen so the grace of god amen not my will father thine be done amen brother again don't wonder jesus said when when the when this sister said to jesus oh i want i want my my sons one of them to sit on this side and the other one sit on that side he said of your throne in heaven and jesus said you know not what you asked amen and and the and and the price and what god was looking for amen for that individual to sit on the left and on the right of his throne amen and he said can you drink of the can they drink of the cup that i drink of oh yeah well brother he tested it without the holy ghost without the baptism because the life of of his blood was still there it wasn't shed he didn't set it free yet amen so he said can you drink of the cup that i drink of amen we ought to now because why he is amen he has given us the life of his blood it's in us now amen are we going to pay the price that he paid because why after after jesus was betrayed where where was where was his disciples where they all go and and the there was one there we just recorded there was one there that was witnessing his is is his betrayal witnessing him is whipping and so on and like i said there was two or three of the of the of the religious people there and they said oh you're one of his disciples to peter he said no no i'm not and then another one accused him no he said i don't know him what what a testimony amen grace brother that we're not going to have that that weakness in our trial amen stay with jesus amen stay with the lord keep taking your stand for him oh just think of it and then another one came and said oh yes you're you want me to no he said i don't know him what don't know him i'll tell you there's going to be a lot of believers brother in when when the final test comes for the bride there's going to be a lot of believers amen they'll be ashamed of jesus peter was ashamed oh yeah he didn't want to identify with jesus what is jesus why don't you do this why don't you do that amen oh yeah because believers with their oh yeah thank god he gives us the holy ghost to know how to exercise the power amen oh yeah we got i'll give you unto power over all the power of the enemy amen and there are believers that are professing people believers oh they would do this and use the power against it if this one hit that one get behind me get behind no no if you got the holy ghost you want them to stand with you for jesus amen oh yeah that's why jesus rebuked peter wait for what wait until he would come with the anointing of the holy ghost amen and that's why when jesus came back from the dead and peter was there he said peter peter he said love us thou me more than these amen brother he's he's he's asking a lot of believers that same question do you love me more than these more than that one more than that one do you love me more so to the extent that you're going to lay down your life for me praise the lord amen well i tell you when peter got the baptism of the holy ghost oh he had he was a new creature he recognized jesus amen and he was going to give his life for jesus he wasn't ashamed of jesus not by any means amen he had a boldness for jesus to the extent that when they crucified peter he said please he said don't put me up like this he said turn me turn me down put me upside down he said i'm not worthy to die as he died i'm not ready but yet he was put on a cross but upside down his head was down and his feet were up amen amen he had the greater revelation of jesus amen what extr to what extent do we have of a revelation of jesus amen grace that we are not ashamed of the testimony of jesus we're not ashamed of the testimony of his word amen we're not ashamed to do what he wants us to do by the grace of god amen we're not ashamed to do it when he wants us to do it amen that's like there are those there's many and many many many an individual would consider it foolish for us to be coming here for this service oh yeah and it's only five what that's not worth it just stay home you know and pray stay home and read the bible stay home and do this they owe me to that no he said he said where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst amen. so i said that's what that's the promise that he's given and and if the government has narrowed it down narrowed it down because it all just to protect us from this and protect us from that well that's fine well jesus is our protection you should take your stand for him he'll take your stand for you amen god help us amen that no matter what the rule what the regulation we're going to take advantage of it what what god wants us to do not my will father thine be done amen it's going to come to that we know why that's fine i understand they're not dramatic and they say when it comes to churches they should also submit themselves to this rule because it's not it's not because they're against what you teach not they're not because you're against what you're preaching no but but it's for you it's for your benefit you know they're concerned over that for your benefit and for this for that and so that's why we're we we just submit ourselves to that rule and that regulation so they just got five five here maybe ten the weekend yeah amen praise the lord so so we can bring ten by the grace of god that'd be wonderful amen well god god will allow this to bring out what's in our hearts amen why what what will this do it'll increase our hunger and our thirst exactly brother amen it'll increase increase our hunger and thirst for god and for our brothers and sisters in the faith we want to get together again we want to get to worship god again we want to go hear the word of god again oh yeah god wants to bring uh that he's bringing out your thoughts your motives your objectives amen praise the lord that's why he has allowed this to happen because it's going to get worse amen because one day it's going to those rules and regulations are going to be against our faith amen why not not just everybody but you know if you're this and you're that oh no you got it you got to stop we don't want it then we take our stand by the grace of god amen i'll have to just give you some quotes and we'll consider it finished amen and the power of god is highlighting something that no doubt that we have heard and we know and we recognize and he's talking about he said a story of a bunch of drunkards yeah what was the story and he said when the drunkards were together and they were discussing different things and the subject of christianity came up and one man said there was no such thing as christianity amen but another man spoke up and he said i know that there is one christian that i know and he said that's my wife amen well the other gentleman said i don't believe it and he said well come and i'll show you. amen and he said he went up to at the house and he done everything they could do and told them cook them some eggs and then he throwed them out on the floor and he said you know better than to cook my eggs like that and he said carrying on in the house and they went over in the other room and fell down in a chair and they heard somebody out there sweeping it up not saying a word but singing a song to herself amen and she was saying must jesus bear the cross along and all the world go free there is a cross for everyone and there is a cross for me amen and this consecrated cross i'll bear till death shall set me free amen and then go home a crown to where amen by the grace of god and he said that old drunk said well he said what did i tell you he said she is a christian and they was only trying her and sometimes the world will try you amen to bring out your christian character amen are you going to when it comes to the things out there be trying you and testing you are you going to are you going to reflect your christian attitude or just your your worldly nature no yes god help us because a lot of things happen out there and instead of responding as a christian we respond as a sinner god help us respond as a christian amen showing that you are born again by the grace of god amen showing that you got a new nature yet you're a new creature in christ wonderful this is tremendous amen and he said she is a christian and they was only trying her and sometimes the world will try you amen god allow this to happen in your life that happened in your job that to happen in in in your home no matter what it is where it is brother sometimes it's god allowing it to test you and try you to bring out your nature amen oh yeah do you have is that is this is it jesus nature in control or is it your own born in sin nature tremendous amen thank god for the revelation of the new birth amen brother it's not a religious experience it's it's a real spiritual experience and it is a genuine experience on the inside of the inside amen you are a new creature amen amen i'll tell you this and not you know and your your family should recognize it and your friends should recognize it your those that you work with should recognize it amen oh you're a christian oh yeah well by the grace of god oh yes amen let's have the right testimony to give proving what you are praying your nature amen so he says sometimes he said the world will try you amen he said i never thought this would happen but last saturday night i believe it was or sunday night and he said the great speaker i don't don't submit to calling people's names but he's trying working exactly contrary and i'm trying to keep them churches out of that ecumenical move and this man is trying to put them there in there so he was speaking for the christian businessmen which i was supposed to have at the meeting in chicago and i thought i'd be in africa at that time so i couldn't take it and this man said go up there and said the greatest move the greatest thing in the earth now that had ever been all the churches are returning back to the catholic church yeah because they started it back just before the prophet was taken home and after the opening of the seals amen that those spirits began to come more and more into manifestation god held them held them held them back but then after the opening of the word it's more and more and brother the devil is there to tempt us to get into it that's right now you stay with the word amen so he said they are now returning back to the catholic church in the ecumenical move and the catholics will receive the holy ghost what a trap of the devil now yeah satan and he said this leader brother shakarian the president of the international businessmen stood up and said after the man sat down he said that's not the way we word it brother branham has told us this ecumenical move will move them all to the mark of the beast amen well yeah they're going to be deceived in it but they're going to do it will it willfully go that way because oh yeah that that's their that's their you know human fleshly thoughts of god god is this god is this god is this yeah but they don't have the revelation of god's nature they don't have the revelation of god's purpose his plan or his pattern no no they feel oh well we can love this and love that you know god god's god's a good god god's a god of love and so on but like i said love is corrective and down through the years god is with love he has corrected his sons and daughters amen grace trusting that we're here to be corrected by him brought in line more and more in line with his word amen and brother it just didn't start when you got baptized in the name of the lord no well it started when it comes to god bringing us to perfection but the devil is there to to to show you this and show you that get you to believe this and get to believe that do that do this and so on amen he's there to get you to think that that oh yeah the lord won't matt don't want mine because the lord knows this about you knows that about you amen so you know we just want you to keep you got to have a right spirit yeah but a right spirit is one that stays with the word amen it's not one that compromises amen you'll stay with the word but you'll still love the person and pray for the person amen but not compromise amen brother i i believe that there's many a believer that's ashamed of certain things that william branham has preached they're ashamed of certain things that he said and and you know he felt he felt this we should do this we should do that oh yeah you mean so many believers yeah there are believers that have left this message and gone back to their denominational churches there are believers that have left this message and gone back to the catholic church they did oh yeah well they came to the message they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and they said they believe this believe that but it got to a place where their faith was being challenged more and more and more and they they couldn't take this they couldn't say no no no yeah and that started a number of years ago a few years ago they started to leave and go back to the catholic church you know and what about again that that as i mentioned the last service that a certain believer that i have talked to on the phone a number of years ago and he's on the internet there youtube and he's and he's speak speaking for a hour and a half and a half 90 minutes telling why he left the message of william branham i said this is this is amazing i said lord i said troy that's grace that he's still sitting there it is well as i said i talked to i might have been him on the phone and i'm not sure it was him or his son and that was a number of years ago now and so after i corrected certain issues there he said okay all right brother lush i guess we'll stay away from message churches i said yes i said you need to so i said i'll pray for you no they don't bleed the message it's amazing and yet and you've got others out there in certain churches that have more respect for us and more respect for the message than then than they do amazing and there are there's a testimony of others there too i think that also are testifying of of why they left the message and so on yeah god had mercy on us amen brother and they they feel that this is what you this is evidence right here why god didn't agree with william branham god didn't approve of william brown god did this god did that well brother you could look you could go through the scriptures and see what the lord permitted in the lives of the prophets amen brother that's the truth oh but yet yet you believe he was a prophet yeah but look what the lord allowed to happen to him yeah we'll see again brother all that's for a reason it's like the brother that sent me an email he said brother i read the bible three times he said i don't believe i don't believe it he said that's not that's not god and i said brother is it because he's if this because of that because of that i said well brother i just got to let you know that the bible was written in that way for a reason what do you mean i said oh yeah god allowed it to be to be written this way this way that way and i said why and i said to number one i said to turn away the unbelievers i said and there's three kinds of believers you know i said which one are you and i said god wrote in such a way so it oh unbelievers to take it just move it control away don't want that it's just just a religious book and i said then i said it's the cause to make believer to stumble and because god's going to use them for a witness one way or the other and that's they'll stumble over it and they'll or they'll skip that and then they'll stumble over that and skip that oh yeah yeah i'll take that and stop over this and take that i said that's make believers and i said then i said that it's the true believer that believes it regardless amen and maybe don't understand it but they leave it with the lord and i said which are you i said are you a believer a make believer or an unbeliever he never responded so maybe he was an unbeliever but i pray that i pray grace i prayed for him i said i pray grace that he's a believer amen that lord that you're going to speak to him but i haven't heard from him since amen brother i pray god grace that we are believers amen we're not going to doubt anything the devil is going to highlight this and i like that get behind me satan amen and he said what a trap of the devil he said what for to influence people to go back to the catholic church or just to you know recognize them as any other church oh at the galaxy oh yeah well that's just catholic there's the salvation army that's the pentecost that's the anakin oh it's fine with me oh well for us it's the word amen stay with the word amen i'd love to try to definitely finish amen he shouldn't oh yeah i wanted to bring out this but i i don't see a i don't think i can right now and that was from page 25 for the next four or five pages the problem of god brings out the characters in the in the in the bible amen and he said noah let's consider noah we could consider abel and cain amen cain must have been ashamed of abel's sacrifice uh they came with ashamed of abel's church amen a church that was full of blood amen and look what he did he went and killed lamb you know did this and did that but cain thought he had a wonderful wonderful sacrifice of all that he had grown and he had brought it and laid on the altar but he said prophet of god said noah was not ashamed it seemed foolish to the rest of the world but not to noah amen and there's many a thing that we're taking our stand for that is foolish to the world what do you take this stand for why are you preaching this for why are you preaching that all they got to do is be believers all they got to do is believe in god you know and this and then they'll go to heaven no they want god knows the heart amen and then he said moses when he was before pharaoh he wasn't ashamed to tell pharaoh amen these things would happen because he had meant god and god told him in the burning bush amen he said that's what he had him what he had an impediment of speech he's moses stuttered and that's why god moses said lord you know i can't talk you know right so god called joshua it was joshua aaron god called aaron and uh and he was here to speak for moses yeah moses talked too but aaron was there to really talk normal amen because moses stuttered amazing those whom god chooses amen you would you'd never choose him as a pastor would you moses oh my no he stutters but he said there comes aaron and you be god to him and he'll be a prophet to you amen i know he can speak well but i'll be with your mouth who made man to speak amen he said i like that that's god who made man to be deaf or dumb and who made man to speak god amen praise the lord hallelujah we think god that's that that person's not called of god oh they got a problem they got a problem well that's god's choice what does god see man sees one thing god sees another amen amen boy god looks at the heart amen praise the lord praise the lord he said you know he said in the last days they're supposed to be them plagues repeat again and he said remember an adulterer in the bible time his penalty was death by stoning and the unbelieving church will be stoned to death with hailstones and issue was once god's way of punishment and he'll stone this unbelieving world he said this adulterous generation he'll stone it from heaven with hailstones weighing a talent of peace which is a hundred pounds amen the adulterous church will die the adulterous world he said will die under the punishment of god stoning amen get right with god turn back to god amen and he goes in to talk about elijah that he was not ashamed talked brings out the other characters there's david moses amen daniel and many other creatures in the bible shadrach meshach and abednego and he said john amen philip stephen peter amen praise the lord yes stephen as i mentioned he said a few minutes ago when he went through like a tornado he said he wasn't a preacher he was just a deacon and he said but he testified everywhere of the resurrection but he laid his life down and they stoned him but has death come on him he said lord forgive them for they know not what they do praise the lord amen praise the lord i'll let that bring it to a close finish now friends we come on down with man down through the age but we are past time but let me say this a man who has once come in contact with god which is the word and the word has been made plain and manifested to him he said there is no shameness about that word you are not embarrassed you are not ashamed he said doesn't embarrass me to say i believe every word it doesn't embarrass me he said when the lord says to to say something you go say it do it it doesn't embarrass me to say that i've been filled with the holy ghost they don't embarrass me to say that i have spoke with other tongues it don't embarrass me to say that the our lord has shown me visions it don't embarrass me to say that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen he said if a christian has been filled with the holy ghost amen you're wearing the testimony of jesus christ's resurrection amen you're living the testimony of the resurrection amen by the grace of god praise the lord we have authority by the resurrection of jesus christ and his promised word don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplex the last generation that'll ever be on the earth this sinful adulterous and full of all putrified source all everything that's been decent has become indecent national politics filth and nations are all broke up amen but there is a separation time is now taking place when god is calling a bride the devil is calling a church and he said but let me be a part of the bride amen the grace of god that we're not ashamed of the word of god the planned purpose of god amen not by any means because we are the bride of christ and the bride is not ashamed of the bridegroom amen god bless you amen our musicians can come and we'll just
