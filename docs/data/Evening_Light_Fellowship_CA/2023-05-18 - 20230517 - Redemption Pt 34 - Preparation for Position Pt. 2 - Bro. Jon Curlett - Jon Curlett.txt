to speak once again this evening Heavenly Father Lord that you would encourage instruct or correct Lord draw your children closer to you again tonight we pray Heavenly Father Lord though a small group Lord we're coming in with expecting hearts and souls Lord Lord eager Lord to find ourselves in your word once again nor would you just speak to each one that's here Lord remembering the many ones not

Paul at home God bless you if you turn you would in Hebrews chapter 12 amen Hebrews chapter 12. and small group I certainly appreciate my family at least moving up to fill up some of the pews here it's a it's a big church to have half the church here you know but but uh that's okay we've had far less amen through covid we had four people and me preaching at one point there and brother Gerald had to go through the same thing so this is still an upgrade a big upgrade amen ch1 here this evening Hebrews chapter 12 it's the favorite scripture for for believers we talk about chastising and chastening and everybody groans internally and says is this really what we're going to talk about tonight it is but we're going to talk about it from a from the right perspective hopefully and give us some encouragement tonight and help us to have some understanding in these things Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 5 says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening God dealer with dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not amen you can have your seats this evening may God bless his word men were continuing as you would imagine in a Redemption series and I want to take a second part on this idea of preparation for position and we're talking about adoption and we're going to be here for at least a few Services I I go and I write out my notes and it seems like the notes don't shrink at all because I keep adding as I'm as I'm studying and going through these things so this is this is really where the message is taking us that's what the message is all about is the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God it's it's about bringing us to our position in Christ to a real revelation of it of a reality of it in our life and so I think it's it's worth the time it meant for us to sit and dwell on the things that that'll take us to what we're supposed to be in this this life and I was talking to my wife about last service and and I did want to make a clarification you know I spoke about you know where I'm at in my professional life and how I had to go through high school and then I had to write tests there and then I had to go into University and then I had to write tests and then I came out of University and I had to write another big test and then when I passed that three years later I had to write another big test and then when that was done I was finally it I was a profession National engineer in the United States in Canada and I was fully graduated and accredited and I was saying you know I've I've arrived but then I brought that to to my role in the ministry and one thing I don't want you to think is that I've somehow arrived if you think that I have arrived if you think that I've arrived you just need to see the first week I had as Pastor I mean it's it's not that I've arrived or or anything and or or any of that amen I I where I am today and standing here today is because I have passed some tests and I've gone through some of the courses that God has laid out for my life but believe me it's there's a lot more tests ahead and they've hit from the very beginning and I've got to grow in those things and and as you can imagine pastoring's not a job you can actually prepare for Beyond a certain point you know as assistant pastor you you get involved in situations and you try and sort things out and you're you know you help a bit here and you help a bit there but you don't have the full weight of responsibility you don't have the full weight of of the leadership that you have to take you don't have the full weight of a preaching schedule the way that I do now you don't have people looking to you the same way it's very much a support role before this and so now now I'm sitting here or standing here and I'm pastoring people that are older than me people that are are further ahead in their walk to meet people that have had a more experienced Pastor for so long so believe me I'm very very aware of these things and and I understand what it's like to sit and listen to somebody that that is is younger than you and these different things so so I'm not saying I've arrived by any by any stretch of the imagination I I think if I would say this the work has only just begun amen I said it before I'll say it again I I have made mistakes I will make mistakes he's still working on me as Joel Hemphill said he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be and it's a process and so all I I say all that to say this keep me in prayer amen I'm not up here thinking that I've somehow got it all figured out and and so you keep me in prayer and you ask God to help me amen and if you feel that brother John needs to come up a step higher than pray that God will take brother John a step higher because I can only go as high as he takes me amen I can't pretend if there's one thing I've learned in all of this you can't pretend you can can't be something you're not and if you do then God will knock your pins out from under you so fast it'll make your head spin amen but if you'll wait on him and you'll trust in him and you'll dwell on him and you'll meditate on the things of God and these things and then he'll he'll do the work amen because I'm only here as a as a microphone I'm Not The Shepherd of your souls amen he is The Shepherd of your souls and so pray for me because my my desire is to preach a living word that brings a living faith and then the scripture says that Faith cometh by hearing and so what I want to do is preach a word that gives you faith not just a faith but the faith amen the faith of God that's that's what my goal is in all of this for sure so just trusting I I think everyone understood that but I thought I'd make that clarification this evening just to just to say you keep me in prayer because I've got a lot of growing and a lot of stretching and a lot of uncomfortableness to go through in these things amen now I opened up in in Hebrews chapter 12 and like I said we kind of just collectively grown whenever a minister opens up and he talks about chastenings and trials and these different things I remember when I was younger and I came here for special meetings and this was my opening scripture and and again you just look at the people's faces and they say we brought a minister from three or four thousand kilometers away and he's going to preach to us about chastenings you know praise the lord we don't we don't say that we don't feel that because most of us have gone through chastings and I believe we all have if you're a child of God if you're uh then you've gone through these different things but the point with all of this and I think that Paul is saying is you can't graduate unless you go to school and you can't finish you've got to finish your courses you've got to get through the tough times you got to get through exam week you've got to get through the tests in order to graduate and and God knows how to prepare people and then God knows how to get us ready for these things and as I was dwelling on these things it brought me to the idea you know we have these things called prep schools and what is it what does that prep short for it's short for Preparation and they're usually private schools and they have the best teachers and the best tutors and the best programs and the best equipment and you pay a fortune to go there and really rich people send their kids there to get them ready for the life that's ahead of them and guess what US US normal people don't get to go to prep schools because we don't have the money but I want to say that God has got a prep school for his children amen and it's a very exclusive School everyone can come but it's only his children that stick it out it's only his children that go all the way through to graduation these things and in those prep schools they push them harder than anywhere else you go to public school they'll let things skate they'll let things go but you go to a real prep school where you're paying you know a hundred thousand dollars a year in some of these places a hundred thousand dollars per kid to go to a prep school believe me they don't let things skid they don't let things slide they're teaching you the best way they possibly know how to brother Branham talks about this and he says our heavenly father he says I thank thee tonight because that we're living in the hour of preparation now here today in the hour of preparation we're living when you're preparing the people to believe all things we believe that's the message of the day the preparation time Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says and you're calling a people you have give them the Holy Ghost Past Tense you say brother John I've got the Holy Ghost good look what comes next you have given them the Holy Ghost and now present tense you're trying to call out that group of people that group of sons to adopt them future tense so it's a present work with a future goal of something you've already received and that's the Holy Spirit he says and we realize that the Old Law was that his son was born into the home he was a son but the Tudor raised him and then when he was of age if he'd been the right kind of son he was taken out they put a purple robe on in the ceremony and he was adopted he says and that's what you're trying to do to these Full Gospel people now listen to this he says to get them out to themselves somewhere where so you got to come out of something but where is he going to take you into he says I want to get you alone with you in faith to do what to adopt them into the kingdom and give them the right to go forth and to do the things that you did so he spoke last service so that the holy spirit is given first and foremost as a tutor or as a teacher and we've got to learn the first thing we've got to learn is to listen to the Holy Spirit that's the first thing you had to do and I think of you for anyone that's received a new birth or anyone that's got the Holy Ghost the first thing it did was bring you into obedience that's the first thing you've got to learn is obedience to the Holy Spirit and it will always point you back to the word always point you back to the word amen the first thing you've got to do is get it and then you've got to learn to listen to it and yield to it that's the path that God puts us on Amen the first thing we do is we listen to the word of God and we accept it by faith that's Acts 2 38 right we listen to what Peter said on the day of Pentecost and he said repent and we and we obey he says and what be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and so we go down into the water by faith and then he says after that you'll receive the Holy Ghost obedience takes us to that place but after that now you're a son but you're just a newborn baby a newborn baby can't inherit the Kingdom a newborn baby can't inherit what daddy is already prepared from so now there's a process that has to happen where you've got to grow and be taught and you've got to accept that training you've got to embrace that training and when you do that it takes you to the place now where you can step into Daddy's into Daddy's shoes and you can start to be a part of the Kingdom of God in the in the family business he says when a man is born into the body of the Lord Jesus and becomes the son of God the Son of God he says God has sought the heavens for the best tutor he knows of to put over his children and it's not a bishop but it was the Holy Spirit we think Bishop when we think Roman Catholic but there are Bishops in the scripture and that was the pastor so he's saying your your your actual tutor is not your pastor I'm here to facilitate I'm here to feed you the word but it's up to him to make it real to you it's up to him to bring it to you in a way that you can obey and produce what it's talking about he says it was the Holy Ghost and God put over his church to raise his church to do what to believe in spiritual things and the supernatural workings of God brother Mark was sharing with me some things that brother Jason Watkins was preaching on and he points here that it's a balanced approach that if we go too far into Doctrine it doesn't produce but if we go too far into signs and wonders that won't produce either they had signs and wonders in Azusa and where did it take them the Azusa Revival took them right into denomination and guess what science or or the Mysteries and these things have absolutely taken message churches into denomination and you look at those churches today and they are almost exclusively devoid of young people and it's all older people and those churches will die off in the next 20 years because there's no New Birth because it's cold and starchy but you look at ones that seek after signs and wonders and the thing is there's nothing that grounds them there's no skeleton there's no framework and so what happens is people get into an emotional high and when they lose that they lose the victory so it's two sides and neither one is right but if you've got that approach through the middle which is stay with the word and take the left the left and the right take it all together then you're going to get the results but we don't seek the left we don't seek the right we stay in the middle and say God will add to the church daily such as they're needed people signs wonders Mysteries gifts all of these different things right amen what are we seeking we're seeking The Life of Christ and everything else follows everything follows the life of the True Believer it does not lead it it always has to follow these things that's why Hebrews 13 8 brother Brandon would say that my message is to declare him that he's here here it was Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that is the portion for the believer today that hasn't been had since the day since the book of Acts is a reflection of Christ the word completely in flesh that's what he's training us into that's what he's bringing us into amen the holy spirit's here to raise us up to a point where we will completely reflect Christ as a body as a body that's what this whole thing is going to look like but it takes what a full surrender a full surrender will bring us to what the full token it'll bring us to the fullness of God in our lives amen that's what brings us Supernatural is when the supernatural God has control over the natural more natural this body is natural but we're super we're supernatural creatures having a natural life having a natural experience but we're stepping into the Supernatural and it's a blending of two a blending of two Realms because we're stepping out of the natural and into the supernatural but as John said I must fade away and he must increase I must decrease he must increase what's happening is the natural is decreasing in our life and the spiritual is winding up and so what's going to happen is we're in this blending time this transition time and that's the most difficult time when you're not completely one and you're not completely the other but you're trying to break out of one and you've got these clings clingings and these hooks that are there that are trying to hold you back that's the toughest time as a student amen Jesus it didn't come easy to him a very familiar scripture it says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered there's a revelation here at church because Jesus suffered yet he did not sin you say how is it possible that someone suffers under the learning hand of God and yet they did not sin that ought to tell you something that ought to tell you that if you're going through a tough time it's not always because you did something wrong sometimes we sit back and and the first inclination is to scour our life and to check our conscience and check our conscience against the word and that's the first thing a real child of God will do is is it me Lord that's what they said when Jesus was there in the upper room and and they said one of you is going to betray me and they said is it I then say Oh it's John John I knew John he's no they said is it I when issues arise our first instinct should be is it I is there something here in me that needs to be changed that needs to be checked that needs to be cut out that needs to be added in but if your conscience is okay then you got to say Lord this must be for your person and you've got to be able to go through it amen sometimes we suffer because we have to suffer to get the lesson not because we did something wrong now watch this here this is speaking of Jesus Christ it says and being made perfect we say he was born perfect no he wasn't born perfect he was born sinless he was born The Way We were supposed to be born but he was made perfect and it was a process because he learned and the scripture says he grew in stature and in wisdom in the eyes of God and Men Christ didn't start at a peak he started down here and he grew but what he did was he grew quick more quickly than any of us ever have but it says he and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all that that obey him he became the author his his purpose was to be the author of salvation but he became it he was drawn into it he was developed into it he matured into this he was born to do it but he was not it when he started he had to come into a place where he said where God said this is my beloved Son hear ye him and he had to step into his place of perfection IST thought now the prophet of God lays us out he says what do you think of him whose son is he why in birth he was wonderful remember scripture says he's wonderful counselor he says in his birth do you believe it in his birth he was wonderful in wisdom there was never a man that spoke like this man do you believe that but he says in sacrifice he was perfect in sacrifice he was perfect in death he was a redeemer so you see that his actions are tied to his state they're tied to his identification it says when he rose he proved that he was God hallelujah that's right he said he was when he was here on Earth he said he was God he looked like God he acts like God he preached like God he rose like God he was God he says hallelujah Emmanuel unveiled in flesh walking among men he was God Emmanuel he fulfilled the father he thrilled the hearts of The Poets and great men down Through the Ages he says and every man that ever amounted to a hill of beans was somebody who put their trust in him as the son of God but look at what he says there in sacrifice he was perfect he was made perfect when he sacrificed his total will to God that is where he reached his peak of perfection was when he was fully surrendered amen and within that surrender he looked like God he acted like God and then he died and we say how could that be God but then he rose again and it proved that it was God all along but in full surrender was when he was made perfect remember this as we move forward because remember Christ was the first of many Brethren the firstborn of many Brethren so the process that he goes through is the process that the many Brethren are going to go through but also the revealing of him is going to be the same way and it's in stages it's in processes it's in times it's in ages it's in sections and it's no different for the bride of Christ today he was God through and through but what was his time of perfection it was in sacrifice amen you would say it was when he healed the sick that's when he was perfect because that's what we would think because we're looking at the manifestation of the signs and wonders and Powers but before that he had to surrender and it was surrender all the way through he didn't just surrender what he was in in the Garden of Gethsemane but he surrendered all the way through like I said before he walked thousands of kilometers in his ministry and he didn't have a home I don't know if I don't know if I read it I heard somebody else saying it but but he said the scripture says he Sanctified himself for us I think brother Brown said along the lines of he could have had a wife he could have had a house he could have done all these things but he surrendered himself so completely because he was focused on fulfilling the word that was written about him and that is all he cared about and he surrendered himself to that he gave himself completely to that and that's where his Perfection was amen and then what he lays down his life and the greatest Victory he ever gets is after the greatest surrender he ever had the greatest surrender led to the greatest Victory nobody ever laid down their life and picked it up again some people lay down their life and God raised them up again but nobody laid down their life and picked it up again and his greatest Victory he had to surrender completely and Trust what was written about him before he went into that grave so you look at that and you say well that means I must surrender then I must I'm a sacrifice and we've all got a sacrifice but it's not going to necessarily be the life the way that he had to sacrifice it we're not going to have to go and lay our arms on a cross and and be crucified the way he was but the sacrifice has to be the same thing and the scripture says of him it says then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it's written of me to do thy will o God so Jesus Christ the man the human the body his purpose was to do the will of God and that's where his Perfection laid that's where his righteousness that's where God was displayed was when he stepped into the will of God his experience was completely surrendered to God everything about it was in God's hand and all he wanted to do was get into that Perfection of the word not adding to it and not taking away from it but letting God manifest himself through that human body but it's not just him the adoption of sons the manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God is Not Just For Christ we've got to see ourselves in these things and brother Branham says it this way he says now if you find your place sister not just brothers the scripture talks of the manifestation of the sons of God and brother Brandon would would focus on that at times and say well that's the ministry of the bride and he'd talk about men that are going to step into that Ministry but he says here now if you find your place sister sisters you're included in this there's an adoption for sisters you know the in the in the in the in the Old Testament they took women and they went from somebody that they were supposed to love and cherish and they took them and they turned them into chattel they turned them into property and then Paul comes along in the New Testament and he says there's neither male nor female neither Jew nor Greek neither Bond nor free says in Christ we're all the same thing and you see a prophet coming here and he's saying sisters don't forget you're a part of this you got a role to play you've got to be manifested Christ just as much as the men do not gotta be you're gonna be you're included in this he says now if you'll find your place sister don't let me hurt you or brother he says but you'll find your place in the word as a Christian not what the Creed said that's down here in this lower Cannon father that's going to be destroyed he says see you find your place as a Christian because your character is molded as Christ's you are Zoe the same as he was Zoe which is the life of God he says you're invited to come and take his character by having his character in you it molds you into the same mind that he was and his mind was always to do what the father had ordained him to do see we've got to follow what is ordained for us not to add to it and not to take away from it that's only a distraction and believe me Satan will try and add to it or he'll try and take away from it and get you to try and do something that the word doesn't say you're supposed to do he says his mind was always to do what the father had ordained him to do his mind was to stay with the father's word and the same mind that was in them was to be in us and if his mind is in us we'll do like he did and if his characters in us will be as he was so we'll do and will be amen it's not just works but the works have to be there but there's a being and that's the character that's the life that's the mind of Christ that's got to be us in the same way so Christ was made perfect and that means we've got to be made perfect Christ suffered so that means we've got to suffer and Christ endured so that means we've got to endure as well it's the exact same thing it's going to go the same way that it went through with him and so we opened in Hebrews 12 and I'm going to start a bit earlier to take us through this it says wherefore seem we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses we've got a crowd of witnesses don't we and they're not just 2 000 years ago we've had a great witness in this age and a prophet but we've got witnesses and Elders in our midst and and Ministries and these different things of what this works the process works the word works if you'll stay with it that's the cloud of witnesses around us he says he says seeing that we're surrounded by this great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us us voluntarily Paul is saying you lay it down don't wait for God to come over and start beating you over the backside to drop these things because Paul would say we've got a race to run and he said you did run well what did hinder you well I think sometimes what hinders us is that we've got too much on our back that we've been carrying and Paul says sometimes what it's going to be our habits it's going to be our relationships it's going to be our Tendencies sometimes it's going to be hurts and offenses and past experiences and memories and these different things family issues and whatnot Paul says Lay It All beside these things that keep tripping you up put it aside and just say I don't want it anymore and run with Christ because when if you're if you're ever in a long hike if you're ever traveling by foot I went sheep hunting many years ago in Alberta and the idea was to get every ounce out of that pack because when you're climbing eight and ten thousand feet every ounce counts and you're only carrying so much food and you only have so much water every little bit of sweat you put out every bit of energy that you put out is going to hurt you in the end so you've got to preserve your energy and so you reduce every bit of weight so you only take exactly what's necessary and nothing else Paul's saying that's the way you got to do this take everything that's unnecessary and shove it to the side and say I don't need to carry this on this journey and Satan's trying to pack it on pack it on pack it on brother Brandon would talk about he'd say we've got every modern convenience and yet we have no more time we've got less time than they did when they had none of it why because Satan's packing it on packing it on packing it on and we've got to be as quick to shovel it off as he is shoveling it on he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith I'm reminded we choose what we look at we choose what we look at and if we're going to look at Christ we know we're going to we're going to see the right things and we're going to dwell on the right things but it reminds me of a serpent stare and apparently there was an experiment they did where they put a a snake they had a serpent they had a snake in a in a container and they put a finch in there with it and they know that the snake wanted the finch and the finch went in there and it just was fluttering all over and they had some branches over in the corner and it went up and it stayed there and it was just all a flutter and nervous and the snake never moved at all it just sat there quietly didn't move didn't blink nothing just sat there and that bird started staring at that that Finch started staring at that snake and it just got down bit by bit who's looking at the snake and something about that stair got a hold of it and it walked all the way over to that snake the snake opened its mouth and the bird walked into the snake they closed and he had it didn't have to do a bit of work why the bird got caught in the stair we choose what we stare at listen you stare at evil it'll suck you in all the way all the way and you won't even know what's happening until it's too late so what happened with Eve so what happened with Eve she got off just a little bit and he sucked her all the way in amen you look at troubles troubles compound the more you dwell on them the more you look at them the more you look at situations you're more that you dwell on the impossibility of the situation of of how this can't happen and this won't work and that won't work guess what it won't because that's where your faith is going to be it's not Faith anymore it's doubt it's it's the opposite of faith and it builds it up to the place where you can't overcome it and all of a sudden you've got a great weight that's holding you back and you can't move the way you're supposed to he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand at the right hand of the Throne of God so Paul's pointing us to Christ he says look he endured he despised the shame he didn't dwell on the shame naked on the cross stripped bloody he despised a shame it wasn't even worthy of his attention he says and he endured and now he sat down at the Throne of God he was saying look at him to understand what he looked at and look at him to see what the roar roar was when he looked at the right thing when he dwelt on the right things he says for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be weary and faint in your minds now he's not saying you won't be weary and faint we're human we're going to be weary and faint but he's saying if you dwell on the weariness and faintness of it you're going to get into trouble he says look at Christ he's there to save the he's there to save the planet he's the hero he's the Messiah they've been looking for and the Very ones that he wanted to save that he was there to save were killing him he says and if you dwell on what the ones that you're trying to help are doing to you rather than the reason why you're doing it in the first place you're going to get into problems but he says he looked to the reward he was looking past the pain looking past the rejection and he was focused on what was coming he was looking on what the word said was going to happen because of this and that's where he dwelt on it and all of us got a reward because of it because what we were there we indicted him our sins were there we were there with that crowd saying crucify him crucify him crucify him our sins are what put them up there and yet while we were yet sinners God loved us amen and gave his life for us what's Paul saying he's saying put it in perspective put it in perspective and we're going to talk about about perspective in a little bit but he says ye have not right here there you go I always say that and it's right there he says you have not resisted on the blood striving against sin this struck me as I was studying it you know my sister Atlanta when the kids would come in and they'd say so and so did something to me or she'd say are you bleeding no then you're okay go away and Paul's saying are you bleeding because you've fought so hard have you resisted sin have you have you have you been so completely surrendered to your your walk with God that you're bleeding now Paul's saying come on guys we're not bleeding yes we're hurt yes we've been offended yes we've had tough times but he says we're not bleeding yet we're not bleeding in how hard we're fighting so he says come on let's put it in perspective what we're really going through Christ had his body completely mangled destroyed his face it was more Mara than any other man's he was he was wrecked in a way that nobody else Paul says compare that to where you're at and say is it really are we really in such a bad situation now reminds me of John I think it was John Wesley he didn't he didn't he pray so so long and so often that he had worn divots in the wooden floor by his bed and he would weep for so long that his eyes would be swelled shut and his wife had to lead him to the table to eat his meals that's commitment when's the last time we can say we did that that's the when's the last time I can say I did that that I I was in such fervent prayer that I was under such a burden for somebody that I would stay there until my eyes wouldn't open because of the weeping listen church we haven't resisted under blood amen there's a lot more we can do and in perspective I think we'll realize that it's not always as bad as we think it is he says ye have forgotten this is where we started you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him you know we especially uh with our children you you say something sharp to them they just kind of shrink away from us don't they now if it's warranted that's one thing but boy if you say it and it's not you know you're over the top with it they just wither before you don't they it's a horrible thing and we need to go and make those things right with them we need to apologize but he says listen don't faint when God rebukes you don't say oh my goodness this is so hard I can't take it anymore he says no no we're better than that we're stronger than that he says for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every song whom he receiveth that word receives there means to admit into the program to start on the training and learning program to set on the path towards adoption so this is for every one of us none of us get to escape this amen once he set us on the path we're going to have hard times we're going to have chastising we're going to have times where he speaks harshly to us where he speaks sharply to us where he's very corrective in a way that maybe we don't enjoy amen but the point has to come where our our flesh is second and our spirit says I want what the what he's got to give me we've got to enter into this willingly amen and we're willing to take the path to get the results it's like when we went into University I went in there and I endured the pain because when I got out I was going to have a degree and my life was better with a degree than without a degree I believed and that's why I went through the pain but we've got to have a revelation that what we're going through is leading to something that's better than what we'd have if we didn't do it amen I mentioned this quote when I was here last time about Michelangelo and he says if people knew how hard I worked to get my Mastery it wouldn't seem so wonderful at all and you look at at these chapels here and the things that he painted and it took him years and years and years you know and and you've probably seen that the church had that old video there about him way back when I mean he fell off the scaffolding and got paint in his eye and you know his joints are all crippled up from holding the that's that's what it takes to become a master you know today they say it takes 10 000 hours of practice active practice and to to become a master have we put 10 000 hours into our walk with God have we put 10 000 hours into into learning and growing and and committing our energy to him ten thousand hours is what they say it takes today listen to this Paul says if you endure chastening if you endure it you've got to endure it you've got to stick with it you've got to stay with it you've got to decide you're in it for the long haul you've got to say I'm in this until I get the results he says if you endure chastening God dealing with you as with sons for what son is he whom the Father chasteth the flip side of that is if the chastening keeps going it's because you're a Son of God it's because you're a daughter of God because what happens is God will chase him and then somebody walks away and Paul says if you walk away it's in verse 8 he says if you be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then are you bastards and not Sons so he says if God stops working with you that's a really bad thing because he only stops working with ones that aren't his children so he says if the chastening keeps going no matter what he says that's a good sign because it means God's still working with you because you are his son because you are his daughter I want to put you in perspective on this because like I said we look at this and we think it's about well I'm out of line and I did wrong or I'm not getting the lesson and sometimes it is sometimes that's what this is about but remember tests are difficult by Nature a test is supposed to be difficult I remember I did a I had to take electives when I was in university and one of them was uh oh man I forget that's how important it was anyways on my final exam you have to stay there for 45 minutes at the University when you're in a final exam you have to see stay in your seat for 45 minutes I was done that exam in under 20 minutes it was not a difficult exam and she did it for her sake not for my sake God doesn't do it that way God's tests are tough because he's trying to make sure you've learned the lesson so we're in a time and we've learned the truth and we've got the doctrine laid out and we know what we're supposed to do and then God gives us a test and the test is tough and sometimes it's because we've messed up sometimes it's because we haven't done the training we haven't done the study we haven't gone through the curriculum but other times it's because he wants to see what your attitude is going to be like because he's as interested in our attitude as he is in our actions because a bad attitude with the right action is still wrong so he's interested in in molding every part of us amen listen to this this this really did me good he said a brother met me today as I was going out and he said brother Branham he says financial troubles have burdened his heart he said after hearing about the poor people in India and so forth he said but yet every time said I've got good health and everything but he says but everything is always banging me down I said every son that cometh to God must be chastened of God he said every one we just have to be tried he said God's whip is laid on us seem like being innocent I didn't do anything wrong why am I getting a whipping why am I going through a tough time why is it so difficult I pay my tithes and yet I'm struggling financially I come to church and yet I'm struggling with my family you know we've Faithfully been here and now our kids are strong no no no he says it seems like you're innocent and yet the whipping is going on the hard times are going on catch us now he says God is doing that to prove that we are Sons not that you did something wrong not that you're out of the will of God not that you're you're you're hither and yawn all the time but he says it's proving that you're a Son of God the fact that you're being trained and tested and tried proves that you're a Son of God and your reaction now is going to prove whether you're a son or a daughter of God as well and he says those who cannot stand chastisement or illegitimate children or not true sons of God but that man or woman who can stand and take their whipping and everything going wrong everything going wrong have you ever had anything keep going wrong I've been there many many times and you say what is going on I've been faithful Lord I've been faithful I've been faithful I've been faithful and everything is going wrong listen to this he says everything's going wrong they'll still look up and say Lord I love you that's the one that's he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved he says now I love that don't you and knowing this that tribulation worketh patience and patient patience worketh hope and hope make it not a shame there you are see tribulation worketh patient be patient and hope maketh not ashamed we've got the hope tonight he says in all of our tribulations yet it works God knows how to what train a man God knows how to train a woman God knows how to bring us to where we're supposed to be he says in all of this getting a beating when you ought didn't do anything wrong he says and yet in all of this it works it gets the results it does the job amen he says tribulations make us patient waiting to the coming of the Lord what does it do it keeps us uncomfortable down here gets our eyes off of what's going on here and gets us to look towards a resurrection and a Rapture to look for a kingdom that in a city whose Builder a maker is God Amen that we don't get too tied down here sometimes he's making it uncomfortable just to get our eyes back to where they ought to be it reminded me of Joseph Joseph is the is the most perfect type of Christ that we have in the scripture I believe just absolutely a phenomenal young man and and yet he's born and he's born to be a provider he's born to be a deliverer of sorts and he's born with a gift he's born with a gift of Prophecy he's born with a gift of visions and dreams and these things and Joseph having done nothing wrong is hated is envied his brothers take them throw them down a well and then sell him into slavery Joseph having nothing done wrong now remember seemingly innocent he sold into slavery into Egypt he goes into Egypt and what about Joseph's attitude Joseph's attitude was wherever I am going to reflect the God that I serve and he wasn't bitter towards God he wasn't angry towards God he didn't Mumble and groan and complain and pout and go bury his head in his pillow no he served potiphar as he would serve God and God blessed him and then God let him get falsely accused and cast him into prison Church we're talking about the process of bringing you to the place where God wants you to be to bring you into what God has has for you in the future and then he puts him into prison and what's Joseph's attitude the same as always I'm going to serve God by doing my best here and pretty soon Joseph is running the prison and he's got his freedom within there he's doing the job for the prison Warden and then what happens he helps a baker and a butler and he says now when you go before Pharaoh you that's going to live you that's going to die you don't have to worry about it you that's going to live he says remember me remind Pharaoh about me tell him about me and that guy forgets all about Joseph so now Joseph has helped somebody he's done the right thing he's used his gift for their benefit and then they forget about him and he's still rotting away in jail church this is the Son of God being brought to the place of what God had in store for him and then after that after a while sitting there and waiting saying Lord you gave me the gift you used the gift for the benefit and now here I am still in jail all of a sudden work comes Pharaoh wants to talk to you and in an instant in an instant he goes from a slave in prison to second in the Kingdom where everything that he says goes he has pharaohs for Authority he has Pharaoh's full power he can write the checks he can empty he can fill he can take he can sell he can do all of these things in one instant but what did God do it all for because Joseph had to have the character to be able to handle that kind of power and Joseph really in a way is maybe a better type of the Bride because he was second in command he still answered to pharaoh and the bride still answers to Christ but she's got to have character to do what God has told her to do Joseph wasn't given all of this power just to go out and and amass a bunch of wealth for himself when he amassed wealth he said this is yours pharaoh because remember they got in there and they had all the years of plenty and everything was great but then as times got tougher and Joseph now is the only one that has the Grain and the corn people start coming to him and Joseph says well you can pay the money and they pay the money then they're out of money and Joseph says I'll take your land but he didn't take it for himself he gave it all the Pharaoh it's in Pharaoh's name it's in Pharaoh's name it's going back to the king it's going back to the Pharaoh because he's the one that I answer to what Joseph had character to not enrich himself with the gift but God put him through all of that completely innocent completely innocent and God put him through years decades of slavery and hard times and false imprisonment and people ripping his reputation apart all to prepare him for what God had in store for him amen Hebrews 12 continues and says furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much more rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure sometimes we correct our kids because it makes our life easier that's not that's not godly correction Godly correction is for their good not for our good and so often our response is because we just want peace we just want quiet we just want cleanliness in the house we just want somebody to stop saying and what we're looking for our peace he says and yet we reverence our fathers and mothers we respect them we're glad for them he says but what about God because he does it for our Prophet that we might be partakers of what his Holiness this is getting deep now this is this is where we're getting to the root of these things because it's not just about appearances it's not just about good or bad or right and wrong but it's about being a partaker of God what does that partaker mean a take apart a taker apart it means you're going to be a part of his holiness you're not just coming under an umbrella now but you're going to be a partaker you're going to take part in representing God's holiness so that's what all this is for is to make you a part of his holiness amen this is about a people that are just going to be like Jesus Christ he says now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous if you're enjoying it it's not God no chastening he says when God does it nothing is enjoyable he says for the see it says but Grievous and it's like it's like exam week at University or School nobody likes it even the smart people don't like exam week because it's stressful because you have to go back and you have to dig deep and remember all those things that were three months ago or four months ago or six months ago or whatever it is and you're going through it and you're just trying to get through to the end he says that's what it is with God it's like an exam week It's just tough all the time there's nobody going to enjoy it he says nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby so the ones that go through it he says it produces a fruit the Amplified says for the time being no discipline brings Joy but seems Grievous and painful but afterwards it yields a Peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it it's a harvest of fruit which consists in righteousness in Conformity to God's Will and purpose thought and action that's why I said it's not just about doing the right thing it's about having the right motive it's about having the right objective it's about the right reaction to the action it's about having what the very thought of God in these things he says and it results in right living and right standing with God verse 12 says wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees the Amplified says so then brace up and reinvigorate and set right you're slackened and weakened and drooping hands and strengthen your feeble and poised and tottering needs now my knees and arms are pretty good but what's he saying I'm so weak I can't do this anymore and you're just staggering right he's saying straighten up Lift Your Hands Up lift your hands up worship and praise a little bit he's saying you do it he's not saying God does it he says you go do it he says come on pick yourself up by the bootstraps scripture says gird up your loins like a man come on be a real child of God show some gumption show some Spirit show that you really believe him show that you really trust them don't walk around like a sad puppy with a long face all the time amen we ought to be the most joyous people in the world because we've got a reason for when things are tough the fact that it's tough ought to be joyous to us because we know it's for a purpose and it's for our good other people go through it because they're dumb because they can't listen to the word of God because they can't accept the word of God because you're going to call them done it's not that they're dumb they're ignorant is a better word and so they're going through things and they go through things and they go through things and you have family cycles and you have church cycles and you you have relationship cycles and it's going and going and going why because they can never come to an understanding of the word or revelation of the word but we're going through it and we're going through it for our benefit that's why we can be joyous even in a time of trouble amen he says make straight pass sorry it says so then brace up reinvigorate set right you're slack and then weakened and drooping hands and strengthen your feeble and palsied and tottering knees he says and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed and the Amplified says and cut through and make firm and plain and smooth straight past for your feet Yes make them safe and upright and happy happy pass that go in the right direction so that the lame and halting limbs may not be put out of joint but rather may be cured what is it that gives us these weak joints these loose joints if you ever walked in in the bush in Newfoundland in the woods it's tough to walk because there's brambles and there's dead trees all over the place and whatnot and you're on a path and it's got rocks everywhere it's Newfoundland we got rocks everywhere it's not a smooth past and you'll see it maybe with Samuel especially he's walking quickly and then just poop and he goes flat on his face why because it's not a straight path it's not a smooth path it's not a a ready-made path and so he struggles there because he thinks he you know we go down to the beach and we come down our road and it's paved and everything's smooth and then he comes over there and it's got dips and bumps and rocks and everything and all of a sudden just boom and he's literally flat on his face it's hilarious in a sad way but it's soft so he's always okay that's why it's funny but I'm always worried because what happens is he lands on the Soft Stuff see we make a wrong decision we trip up and we land okay and it's a small thing and we like well it's okay to make mistakes well then what happens is we go from the grassy top by the beach now to the downward slope where it's all dirt and then it goes to rock and when you fall on the beach you get hurt your knees get banged up your elbows get banged up your face gets banged up your teeth get knocked out and so he's got to learn how to walk in the rough stuff by going more slowly and more carefully and what Paul's saying here is he's saying you got a chance now you got a chance to make your path straight and smooth and easy to walk on and it's by the decisions you make every single day you make a decision is the path going to be smoother is the path going to be bumpy is it going to be crooked by our ins and outs and our ups and downs one day we're following the word of God the next day we're not one day it's a priority the next it's not what is it doing it's making your path bumpy and crooked and he says it takes an effect on your knees he says and now you can't walk straight and you start to totter and then you get pulled to the right and you get pulled to the left and you get pulled by a wind of Doctrine you get pulled by a Ministry or you get pulled by an influence or a habit that you thought you'd kick and all of a sudden you're all off the path he says you have a chance here you have a choice to decide what this is going to look like he's not trying to cut us down though Paul's trying to point us it'll be worth it it's worth it to do the hard work now you can make better time by building a good path up front and taking the time to do it rather than going and trying to fight your way through a messed up crooked path that's just going to take and sap your energy and you're going to get to the end of it and you're not going to even know where you are you'll be lost in the woods there's a benefit to doing it the right way amen yes God has a purpose in these different things but we've got choices to make all along the way and those choices decide whether we're making mistakes for our good or to be an example to others of what not to do because we're going to be an example one way or the other aren't we we're going to be an example for is it did they do right or did they do wrong I'd rather be the example for what to do right even if it looks hard amen Paul's talking about laying down those weights and what is it the habits of relationships entertainment the silly things that aren't going to help us I was talking to a couple today and that listen in occasionally and and I just shared some things that the Lord was doing with me and I said listen the things that are cut off that our weights are not always bad they just take up space they just take up time they just take up energy they're not bad in and of themselves but they take the place of something that's better and that's what I see God doing is he's sanctifying the life more and more and more because he's got to fit him in there and there's got to be less stuff to take up that room that he needs so that's what happens and and we'll get into it a little bit as we talk about the other things Paul said but what's the goal here what's the goal of making our our path straight and doing the harder work and making the the harder decisions today for the long-term goals what is it the goal is perfection but it's not Perfection of being without fault or mistake but Perfection is to be in the will of God that's what Perfection means is to be in the will of God is to be surrendered to the will of God and what is the prize he says to be partakers of his Holiness that's what the manifestation of the sons of God is it is to be a partaker of the very nature and express the very nature of God that's what the prize is for all of this but what's the cost the cost is to sit under the rigor the discipline of the Holy Spirit as your tutor and you've got to sign up for that and say I'm willing to do it I'm willing to go down that path Jesus had to go through it and we've got to go the exact same way watch how Jesus lines us up though he's talking to the disciples and he says I have yet many things to say unto you but you can't bear them now in other words he says you're not ready for it you're gonna be ready and there's a time and there's a season for you to be ready for but you're not ready for it now and sometimes that's the way it is with us is we're saying Lord I don't understand Lord I need more Lord I need more and he's just saying just keep walking I'll bring to you what you need when you're ready for it and when the time is ready for it amen sometimes he says you've got to wait because you can't handle it now that's what Jesus was literally saying to the disciples you can't handle what you're going to get now you're going to get it but you can't handle it now he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth what is the identifier for the Holy Spirit truth truth always the truth why because it's the word of God the scripture says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path amen it is always truth and God himself is truth the very nature of God is truth it's rightness Amen it doesn't lie it doesn't lead us to stray but I want you to realize your original position here this is for the Holy Ghost filled believer initially you will be outside of that truth you might have a bit of it you might have a head knowledge of it you might have some understanding of it but you won't have all of it because you need the holy spirit to guide you into it listen they've been around Jesus for three and a half years and he says I've got a lot to tell you you've heard a lot I've got a lot to tell you but something's got to happen in between now and then and it's got to be the holy spirit that comes into your life why he says you're standing in a state of partial knowledge of imperfect understanding and it's going to take the Holy Spirit to get you to truly understand and apply it the way you're supposed to he says for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come Jesus is talking to his disciples and their chosen men they're going to be the the pointy end of the spear they're the you know the the apostles they've got gates in that City that are that are named after them or representative of them and these different things they're the they're the the firstborn of the Next Generation Christ was the firstborn but these are the first of all of the new new children that are going to be born by the Holy Spirit and and Jesus is saying you got something and I've chosen you in your elect and you're predestinated and you've been given power in these different things he says but there's something else that's coming and you need that before you can go any further and everything is staged in in product development we have Gates and you've got to pass through one gate before you can get to the next stage and if you don't pass that gate if you don't meet the criteria if you don't meet the performance if you don't meet the specifications you can't go through that gate and go to the next phase and Jesus is saying you got to pass through a gate and that gate is the new birth it's the Holy Spirit and until you go through there we can't go any further in this he says to get where you're going you're going to need all truth and to get all truth you're going to need the Holy Spirit you're going to need the you're going to need the god of that of that word that's coming your way you're going to need all of the word but you're going to need the life of that God in you to be able to hand it handle it why they were in Mark 16 they were supposed to go and preach the gospel and all the world but to preach the gospel does not mean to do what I'm doing right now speaking it it's to show it it's to manifest it so they weren't just going out to speak they could have went and preached the gospel they've been preaching the gospel in their life in their time with Jesus but he says no no when you're going to do it now I'm going away and you're going to take my place and that means something different has to happen to you because you can't take my place right now he just told Peter a few days before get thee behind me Satan you have a lot Peter but you're lacking a lot too so he says you've got to be the gospel you've got to be the manifestation of the Gospel not just a pre-train word but a preacher in life and in demonstration of these different things so he says you need the Holy Spirit to do that now Paul would take this in in First Corinthians and and he would talk about it because we're in a in a state even today where we know so much but it's still only in part we only have a part we have an open Word but it's in a process we're in a process of bringing ourselves to the place where we understand and where we can become that word and Paul says for now we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away now you'll see that when you reach full maturity and you you know that as adults here especially tonight that when you came became an adult certain things had to go away you couldn't stay up till two in the morning anymore could you because you couldn't get up and go to work you couldn't go out drinking every night if you're out in the world even if you are in the world you can't do it and still hold down your job you have to focus on relationships you have to focus on family you can't blow all your money because now you got to have a house of your own you gotta have a car of your own you got bills to pay you got responsibilities you got to pay taxes all these things something has to change when you become an adult when you go from partially an adult as a teenager to fully an adult then that the teenager part has to die off and there comes a point where it has to be dead and you've just got to be an adult moving forward he says when you when you've reached your point of graduation when you become adopted when you've when you've hit what you're supposed to hit when you've reached that goal then everything behind you has to drop away and you have to embrace what's ahead of you now he said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things it's okay to be acting like a child if you're a child listen when you're when you're a new Christian when you're newborn and you just received the Holy Spirit you're still a spiritual child and though you are a son you're not ready to be an adopted son yet and so you're growing and you're maturing but if you've been serving the lord for 20 years and you're still acting like a spiritual child there's something wrong you didn't drop what you were supposed to drop the issue is not the Holy Spirit the issue's not the tutor it said you didn't choose to let go of something that was childish and so you can't move into maturity you can't move into adulthood you're delinquent not the Holy Spirit not the tutor he says for now we see through a glass Darkly in other words we're looking through dark glasses now most of you probably haven't experienced welding glasses but if you put welding glasses on in just natural light you can't see anything you have to have a really bright flame you have to have a really bright spark to see anything because it's shielding all of the the standard light so you can see the really bright stuff when it comes through and so you only see at best vague shapes and outlines when you have dark glasses on Paul says this is what it's like when you're a child when you have it in part there's no real detail there's no real understanding of what's going around he says for now we see through a glass Darkly but then when that which is perfect has come we will see face to face he says now I know in part he says but then shall I know even as I am known so Paul says it's not about understanding of the word or doctrines or anything he says but I'm going to know as I am known I'm going to know who I am and I'm going to know what it means and I'm going to know what the benefits are and I'm going to know what the costs are and I'm going to know what the responsibilities are he says all truly understand what it is to be a Son of God when I become a full adult when I become fully mature now I believe Paul was adopted and he's looking to the the fullness of his adoption which is what the resurrection and the rapture that's when we're going to see everything but there is a revealing there isn't adopting that happens here that points to who you are in Christ and the adoption is the son or daughter of God Amen he says but now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity so all of this training all of this teaching all of this chastising all of these drills all of these tests they're taking us somewhere and it's from in part children to Perfection adults that's the whole process that's what it's going through and like I said before that transition time is so tough and and maybe looking at uh Justine's not here but maybe you know even Selena and Irene they're in that transition from being young people to adults and so they know what is required of them as an adult but maybe they're not quite acting it in every way and that's the toughest thing is because you know what you're supposed to be doing but you haven't quite let go of everything yet and so you're half adult and you're still half teenager that's the toughest point is because you've understood what's going on you've understood what's required but you're still not quite ready to let go and oftentimes that's the toughest time for us as Believers is because we're not ready to let go of things but yet we know we need to let go we know what the right decision is but we're like oh I just I'm not ready yet I'm not ready to take my hands off the wheel I'm not ready to close that out that chapter of my life I'm not ready to be responsible in every way that's what adulthood is is really his responsibility you have a little bit of fun baked in there but it's mostly responsibility that's a that's a tough thing to let go amen it's like Samuel right now his his frustration with us is that he doesn't even understand why he's being disciplined he does but he doesn't understand the purpose of it he doesn't understand that if he does it our way things will be so much better for him and for us praise God so he doesn't understand that but now when you get to to Jonathan's Age and and Lydia's age they know what we're trying to do and they know why we're doing it and so there's an understanding and they realize life is better when I'm in obedience than when I'm not but they're still young people and so disobedience is still in there but then as you come up to the higher ranks and the 19 year olds in the 18s and the 20s now they're on that transition and they've just got to make that final decision they've just got to cut that last thing loose and step into adulthood and all of a sudden they'll realize it's better that way it's better that way what I've been looking for was waiting for me all along but I had to let go of some of these things that were holding me back and I didn't realize that's what was holding me back the switch doesn't flip what happens is the switch flips mentally and then it comes down through our life and we start to make those decisions and that's when you know people really have it is when the switch flips and they start to seek after that which is right rather than fight the trials that are trying to get them to do what's right we start to accept it we start to embrace it and I remember in in University the first two years we were doing things that were just the first three years we were studying things and it was like why do we have to learn this why do we have to learn this but it was the building blocks it was the basics for what was going to come later and if we didn't get that then we'd get everything else wrong that was coming later the last half of my education in University was way easier way more fun way more enjoyable than the first half but if I hadn't learned the first half I would have done very poorly on the second half and so what happened is I remember we had a math course and and this guy was teaching us and and it was it was mathematics in seven dimensions we only need four we only have four and he was teaching it in seven dimensions and somebody said you know sir why are we learning this is anybody actually using this I think I might have actually asked the question he says yes two people in the world are using this that we know of right now one in NASA and somebody doing some theoretical work like Stephen Hawking does and we said so why are we learning it he says because you never know if you might be one of the next two sometimes we're sitting there and we're looking at what's coming our way and we say do I really need that I'm I'm just this or I'm just that I'm just a wife I'm just a young person listen learn it if God's put it in front of you learn it because he's given it to you for a reason and it's for your benefit and you're going to need it down the road but once that switch flipped and we realized this is going to help us down the road boy we were a lot happier and then when we started getting into real life application we started doing work with our hands and we started designing things and Building Things and testing things we're like oh this is a lot of fun now but we had to go through the grind up front to get to the more enjoyable stuff later Paul would say this in Hebrews 6. he says therefore leaving this is how we get to the Perfection now he says leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection so here's what Perfection looks like it's not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead Works remember in Hebrews 4 it talks about we've entered into a rest and it says what it's we've entered into a rest we've ceased from our dead Works Paul says when you're entering into Perfection this should be far behind you you should be well past the point where you're trying to do things for God where you're trying to figure things out where you're trying to push your way into it where your thoughts your opinions your preferences have any play in it he says that should be so far behind you we should have left that a long time ago if you're coming into adoption you've learned to give up what you think what you feel is best and trust God to do it the right way he says so get rid of that he says and of Faith toward God now you say that's a wonderful thing to have faith to war God faith to war God is Acts 2 38. it's bringing you to the word it's it's taking God at his word but that's not where we want to end because Faith war God is just salvation but he wants us to bring us in Paul we'll talk about about it later that we're supposed to have the faith of God remember the just shall live by faith by the Faith by the faith of God so it's translating us now from looking toward God to now being partakers of the faith of God so he says you can't be you can't have your fingers in every pie you can't be trying to drive God you can't be trying to drive your life that's supposed to be behind you and he says and God can't be something that you're looking towards now it has to be something that's a part of you it's got to be with you he says now enough the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment these are all doctrinal things we've got to have Doctrine but he says if you're stuck on Doctrine now you're not ready for Perfection that has to go behind you got to have that stability you've got to have that structure in your life but that shouldn't be where your focus is anymore we ought to know what we believe in this church we ought to know what the scripture says we ought to be able to give an answer for why we believe the way we believe but that can't be where we stop he says and this will we do will go on to Perfection if God permits and then he says but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation through or though we thus speak so he's saying what getting saved is is a start but that's not where it ends so much in the world all they're trying to do is get them to Christ get them to accept the finished work of Calvary and then Paul's coming along and he's saying there are things that accompany salvation and this that accompany salvation is going to be your perfection so don't stop saying I've been baptized and I've accepted Christ as my savior I'm good to go no that's not it for a child of God for a son or daughter of God there are things that accompany salvation and that's what he's interested in that's what he's bringing us to he says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and your labor of love which ye have showed toward his name and that ye have ministered to the Saints and do Minister he said and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end and he talked about Abraham just before this I cut it out in the verses previous just for the sake of time but he was pointing to Abraham and he says Abraham was faithful all the way till the end all the way till the end when things were tough when things looked impossible when it looked like nothing was going right he stayed diligent and he didn't go back to the land of her he didn't go back and rekindle relationships he cut off he didn't go back and seek his former business partners but he's staying we're God had put him and he walked as God told him to walk and he held the faith until God brought it to pass in his life amen what's he saying stay diligent stay diligent to what God has promised and don't walk away from it before God brings you to the full Assurance the full hope the Fulfillment of what it is amen believe for full healing not just for medical intervention amen believe for full Deliverance not just the ups and downs and the ins and outs pray for our lasting Joy rather than one that's conditional on what's going on around you stick with it stick with it because there's a benefit if you do and it's that God will bring it to pass in your life he says that ye be not slothful but followers of them this is the cloud of witnesses who through faith and patient inherit the promises you'll see that Paul has this this key theme throughout this idea of faith and patience it's very rare in Scripture that faith has an immediate result sometimes it doesn't you saw it most often in the ministry of Jesus where somebody would come up and say I believe this Lord I'm asking you to do this and he would do it instantly but the thing is in those situations he wasn't working on adoption but now he's working on adoption and so he's got to train us and he's got to teach us and so he says you got to have faith and you got to have patience because you believe in your sincere and then you've got the Fulfillment over here but in between that is a gap and that's where patience comes in faith plus patience takes you through to the Fulfillment all the way in the End Amen your faith and Patience are always tied together and it will always be that way it's always been that way and and that's the the bridging of that Gap so often is you've got to have patience and wait on God and trust him to take you all the way through very familiar scripture in James it says knowing this that the trying of your faith the testing of your faith Works patience so in other words Faith produces patience there's always a period of waiting and you decide now if you're going to wait in doubt or in faith that's your decision it's our decision are we going to say that or are we going to repeat the promises of God are we going to repeat the word of God or are we going to sit there and say well maybe I don't know because if you wait in that kind of patience it's not going to be patients that produces faith and it's not going to be patients that produces a result it's reflective of no faith in the beginning I mean that faith is going to keep going all the way through to these things but he says but let patience have her perfect work perfect work we're talking about perfection that's what the trials The Temptations the chastising all these things is about it says let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire who wants to be perfect and entire I want to be perfect and entire I want to have everything God has for me he says let patience do it stick it out endure let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing now don't look at that as well you know speaking of myself well I'd like a portion I'd like a motorcycle and I'd like 300 000 a year and no no that's not what he's talking about he's saying that you'll be lacking nothing that you're supposed to have that the word says you're supposed to have amen let's keep our eyes focused on Christ we're not preaching a Prosperity Gospel here tonight maybe maybe on Sunday no this is our prosperity this is our prosperity here that you're wanting nothing amen That Word Perfect means brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary for completeness full grown adult of full age and mature that word entire means complete in all its parts in no part wanting or unsound if you're ever working on a car sometimes the parts there but it's not very good it's not working the way it's supposed to he says you're not going to be like a rusted out Newfoundland car you're going to be like a brand new one everything's in its place and it works the way it's supposed to it says whole of a body without blemish or defect free from sin faultless complete in all respects that's what patience does Church are we going to be praying for patience if we were looking at this scripture we'd probably say Lord give me the patience we're going to be in the trial we might as well get the patience and the benefits that go with it amen amen we're children of Faith that's they were children of Abraham that's that's our Our Heritage that's our bloodline amen but our Perfection is found when we have patience so that our faith has made sight that's what our Perfection is going to be amen our our entirety is found when we're nothing and Christ is everything that's where our Perfection is is when Jonathan curlette is completely out of the picture and it's Christ in every part of me and nothing less than that is going to do nothing less than that is going to do it that's what Perfection is and the only way I can get there is if I Surrender my will the only way you can get there is if you surrender your will every single day what is it it's Christ in you the hope of glory that is perfection that's what we're looking for it's a living word today brother Brown would say this as we're coming to a close he says did you ever know that every son that cometh to God must first be tried whipped child whipping correction it's not easy it's not easy it's okay to say this isn't easy it's good if you say it's not easy because that means it's God doing it and not Satan he says when God gives you a weapon you go out here and you say well I'll go mingle around a bit God will give you a real old-fashioned spanking for it and I tell you if we have more of that in the natural today we'd have better children he says God wants his household straightened out so he gives you a little whipping so you can get straightened up he says it makes you love him more that's when you start to be matures when you start to realize that that weapon was to get me back in line I was reading today in Isaiah and Isaiah is talking about and we'll go into this maybe a little bit more in the next service he's talking about the rebellious children and he says but in that day he says there'll be a voice that says this is my way walk ye in it when does The Voice speak he says when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left that's the voice of God and sometimes that little that's a hey you're not going straight you're getting off the path and that's all this is just a little corrective whip hey what was that this is my way walk ye in it he says it makes you love him more and if we do it right with our kids when it's all said and done they'll love us they don't love us in the moment Samuel when we do it he says bad daddy bad mommy because all he's concerned about is how he's feeling but now you get to the point where they're old enough and you just have to say something to them and they're corrected and they're okay with it and then when they come older and older they start to realize hey mom was a good mom dad was a good mom good dad it's harder to be a good parent than a bad parent it's easy to be a bad parent let them go do what they want but to be a good parent means that you've got to correct you've got to be on top of them you've got to be looking at the things they do you've got to be aware of what's going on in their life you've got to be engaged with them day in and day out and that's a lot tougher to do he says my father used to give me whippings and I thought oh my I wished I could call the old gray-headed father of mine back from the other lands today I would respect every weapon he ever gave me I never got even as much as I needed that is absolutely true we I'm talking to myself there are so many things that Mom and Dad didn't know that I did that if they did no I'd have got whipped we didn't get everything we deserved that's for sure he says though he didn't do right himself yet he wanted me to do right amen and he wants us to if the Earthly parents wants us to do well what about our Heavenly parent the Lord Jesus he has to correct us the scripture says if we cannot stand chastisement or a whipping child correction then we become illegitimate children and not the children of God see if you're really born again get it now if you're really born again there's nothing can separate you from God now see we look at that the scripture says neither neither life nor death nor principalities nor powers or things above or things below and we look at there's nothing exterior that can hold us back from God but Brother Brad is bringing it down he's saying you won't let God's whippings hold you back you don't get pouty when God doesn't let things go your way you don't get mad at God when he gives you a corrective sermon or when he takes things away from you that you really know you ought not to have you don't go and bury your head in the sand and or bury your head in your pillow and and just moan and pout and you know like brother Dwayne was talking about pick my lip up off the floor after a couple of weeks no he says you don't do that you don't let that come between you and God you don't stop having your devotions because things didn't go your way you don't stop reading your Bible because he hasn't provided in the way you thought you don't stop coming to church because things aren't the way you think they should be what is it you're mature and you love him regardless and you don't let the situations of Life stop you from your relationship with God because listen you're going to get sick aren't you brother Bob you're going to get sick and you didn't deserve to get sick what's it going to do are you going to are you gonna walk away from God because he didn't protect you we're going to go through financial struggles aren't we brother Matt and you say I've always paid my tithes why am I going through it did you walk away from God did you stop your devotions stop coming to church find another church find it no no no no you kept coming because you love him and then because you won't let life situations hold you back from the love of God he says that's right and then he goes into the exterior things neither starvation perils trials suffering death nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus he's saying you don't let those things separate you they won't hold God back but he's saying you don't let them hold you back either you've got a part to play now listen we're holding on to the hand and and it's his hand holding us that keeps us together but he says you're still putting your hand up there you're still wanting to hold on Amen though you cling the strength is in his hand but at least you're putting your hand out to cling to him that's what he's saying but he says now you say well I started to be a Christian one time and everything begin going this way and that way and I thought my I was better off going the other way and that way and that and I thought my was better off the other way he says you never did come to God brother if you ever really come to God and got a taste of the Heavenly gifts of God partakers of his divine nature why you know could no more become a sinner again unbeliever than a stalk of corn could become a cocklebur that's right he says it's your nature he says you're made up you've come the right approach he says if you're that way you've you've you're made up you're not a real Christian he says but you've come the right approach if you're the other way he says now you come your own approach so if other words if you think you're better off the way you used to be he says you didn't come God's way and you're not a child of God he says you come God's provided approach one time and see what happens church let me put it this way endure one time endure to the end Ure one time and it'll make it easier to go through the next one because at the end of every Godly trial is his word every time scripture says God is not a a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should repent of what he said or take it back listen God will fulfill his word but you've got to endure endurance is required of the believer you've got to be able to stick it out amen truly humble ourselves one time and say Lord I'm going to be still I'm going to shut up I'm just going to rest and trust that your word is real just once church just once do it all the way to the end and see what happens amen that takes surrender takes humility takes patience takes faith it takes look into Jesus every single day that's for sure amen once you get the results one time it's always easier than next the test isn't easier but you trust the results you trust that the end is going to be the same as the last one which is the word of God be manifested in your life amen it's we need to realize this message is not just about doctrines and and sermons and tapes and a prod God sent a Prophet this is about a Living Word it's about a living word for a living people that have got to reflect Christ amen speaking of Abraham in Hebrews Paul said this he says and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise brother Brahm says this as we close he says you can never be satisfied with the world's Goods you can never be satisfied belonging to a church you'll never be satisfied until you've found satisfaction in Jesus Christ the son of God Church we're talking about what when that which is in part is done away when that which is perfect has come he says you won't be satisfied with anything less than what I'm talking about here he says the only way you can ever be satisfied he says now he came to bring perfection he didn't come to do a halfway job he didn't come to leave us half in our sins and half not in our sins the other like we said before there's no half drunk he didn't come to make you a half Son of God a half daughter of God he'd make you a half Victorious believer he made you a Believer he made you an overcomer and that's what he's going to do but he says he came to bring Perfection and that's what we're going to go in over the next few Services amen God bless you let's stand each one looks like we're going to have an interesting oh here she comes that's good what's the purpose of this training why am I going through this why am I spending time on this we've got so much to chew off and and I've got to kind of bring it in bite-sized portions through these services and it's tough so many times because you don't get to to paint the full pictures you're you're seeing it but that patient enduring amen that patient enduring is what we've been talking about and Blanc and I were talking about this with Samuel yesterday and he was kind of just misbehaving a bit and and you know when he goes and he just kind of flops himself down and just pouts and cries and everything and he gets so frustrated he gets so frustrated because he doesn't understand why we keep doing these things to him as the hardest thing as a child of God is when you don't understand you don't realize what's going on and he's so frustrated with it and he can't get past that point of oh yeah because here's the thing what Samuel usually wants is food or fun or to be outside and all he'd do listen he wouldn't need food so often if he would eat when we we tell him to eat and eat what we tell him to eat and guess what we'll give him his his little snacks from time to time as he goes through the day but if he did what we told him to do he wouldn't be looking for those things on the side and then if he wants to go outside we've got a time for him to go outside and a time for him to be inside we've got a time from a play and a time for him to sleep in these different things and when he does all those things and when we hold him to what we know is best for him he's the happiest boy in the world when he does when he is forced at this age to do what we want him to do for his good he's a happier child in every aspect of his life but when he's disobedient and he doesn't do it it gets him out of the will it gets him out of the word and all of a sudden he's fighting to get what the parents would have given him if he would just be obedient that's where we've got to come to is we stop fighting the program now Jensen he doesn't worry about those things he's quick to obey and guess what he's way happier than Samuel he's way happier than Samuel because he knows that things work out well when he listens to Mommy and Daddy and guess what you still get your ice cream when you listen to Mommy and Daddy in fact you get it easier and more often than when you go and you kick out of a stink and you won't eat your broccoli and you won't finish your meals and whatnot why he's learned that the process works and when he goes with the process he's happier we're happier and the relationship is better that's where we're trying to get Samuel to is where he understands the process is better for me than my way and so he's got to go through chastising daily hourly minute by minute to get him to the point where the switch flips finally and he realizes it's way better to run towards them than to run away from them to not scratch people's faces and to not go and and put a tantrum in these different things but listen we look at him and everyone's smiling okay but I'm gonna bring it home we've all seen our kids do Tantrums and we laugh and we find it so funny sometimes annoying you know when our temperatures are short and and frayed and it's been a stressful week but we giggle at them sometimes because he goes in and like I said bad mommy bad daddy and you can't allow that so you go in and you say no you don't say that you give them a spank but you're just it's so funny because it what he's doing is so out of uh the perspective it's it's so blown up compared to the actual infraction that you did to him right it's so overblown and we laugh and we giggle at it but watch now we pray for something and God doesn't do it and what do we do we walk around with a hang dog face for the next three weeks we don't have a tantrum but our attitude is a tantrum towards God and our prayer life suffers and our devotion life suffers and we're not really engaged in church in any way and and what are we doing we're having a tantrum because we haven't realized I'm a Child of God and if my conscience is clear by the word then this is for my good and it's better if I go with it than if I fight it and it's better that I embrace it then I cry about it you can cry because it hurts listen we've lost people that we love to death to accidents we cry because it hurts you're allowed to say this hurts you're allowed to react to the pain but don't let the pain affect the relationship is what we're seeing don't let the pain affect the relationship you do that and guess what happens he just takes you back to the beginning of the chapter and we do it all over again church I don't want to keep doing chapters I don't keep one of doing I don't want to keep doing the same things over and over again sometimes we're doing it over and over again because we didn't give the right answer we didn't have the right response and so he says son you can't progress daughter you can't progress until you pass this test and I'm waiting for you to have the right attitude I'm waiting for you to have the right response before we go any further in this relationship and then sometimes like I said it's not that you did right or wrong like Joseph he's just saying what will your attitude be when things are tough and you've done nothing wrong anybody had a tough time and you feel like you've been so faithful to God absolutely we have what was our response when you've surrendered when you've given everything you give your time you give your energy you're committed to him and he pulls everything back it seems like even your prayers don't get answered nothing's there what do we do we stay the course it's the only thing the believer knows how to do stay the course amen keep pointing in the right direction listen brother Brown says sometimes God pulls back just to see what you will do and what's he doing he's trying to prove his children there's going to come a day you're going to write that final test you're going to pass that final little trial and it will be little compared to what he's got for you now he's going to say all right son daughter you've done it come up a little higher I've got some work for you to do now then the work really starts amen listen We're Not Gonna can you imagine Church think of this the resurrection has happened we've got sister coffee in our midst for 30 to 40 days are you going to be sitting there staring at sister coffee or are you going to be sitting there staring at the saints that have gone on before and say I really don't think he should have put me through what he put me through when you're flying through the air in a rapture changed in a moment are you going to say I wish he hadn't done that why because it worked brother Brown said about those tribulations he says those trials he says they just work they get it done Church we're not going to be sitting there saying he was too hard he held things back for me that I could have handled we're not going to be doing that we're going to be shouting we're going to be praising we're going to be screaming Hallelujah it'll be worth it all sitting around that great table get there and sit down and talk to Paul for a while Paul the Apostle I hope Paul's going to be there as well but Paulie Apostle is going to be there of that I'm quite certain you get a chance to sit down listen to them I tell you that man tell you what the Holy Spirit did with him on the backside of the desert and then talk to Daniel Daniel he let you go into the lion's den what about the three Hebrew children he let you go into the fire how are you feeling about that today talk to brother Branham took your wife took your daughter talked to those women that had to give their children up and they were eaten by lions and cut in half what do you think they'll be saying it was worth it he did exactly what he needed to do to get me to this side amen that's what we've got to do Church we've got to surrender to the process trust the process amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord it seems so difficult at times Lord to speak on these things and truly accept it but Lord we're looking to the author and finisher of our faith Lord if you did it and we've got the same spirit but it'll take us all the way through to that Perfection we're talking about or that Perfection which is Lord not without fault or failure Lord but that which is seen through the blood Lord that's doing the very works and will of God in this age Heavenly Father Lord that's our greatest aspiration this evening Lord that's our desire Lord not for ourselves Lord but it's to fulfill what you said we would do so Lord would you help us to trust the process Lord not just here while we're in service and everything seems good Lord but when we walk out that door and every gun is trained on us Lord as you bring us through the rigors Lord of your training process Lord as you pull us through the word Lord as you bring us to a place where we have to fight and overcome Lord may we just look to you and say Lord I'm in it for the Long Haul Lord I'm trusting your ways I'm trusting your will Lord when I don't understand I'll Trust you all the more Lord just let us keep our eyes on you we pray Lord would you grant
