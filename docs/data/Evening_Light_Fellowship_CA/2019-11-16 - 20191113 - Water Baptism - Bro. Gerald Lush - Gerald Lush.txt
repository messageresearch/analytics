had a small field a small number of voices there was a lot of voices it sounded like there was a big choir accompanying us sometimes but there are a we believe in the supernatural I why should it be

praise the Lord man [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord [Music] yes a man raise the name of the Lord god bless amen thank God for the gathering well it's the promised forsake not the assembling of yourselves together not just period but much more as you see the Day approaching a man and where we see the Day approaching and we recognize the need for fellowship because the hours come when we won't happen amen as the prophet of God said that you won't even be allowed to pray for the sick that's right and he said maybe they'll shoot you well brother that's not hard to believe considering the world we're living in and what's going on and what's what's happening from day to day so we thank God for the grace of a new heaven and a new earth rather we want to get out of this one and into the kingdom of God amen where it's going to be absolutely perfect man just think there's not gonna be no but it comes to seeing it's not me no thoughts of him no nothing absolutely nothing negative everything's gonna be positive like it's gonna be real it's right now it's something that's hard for us to comprehend you know what it's going to be like but it's going to be what we want it's going to be what we're hungry for what we're thirsting for on the inside of the inside by the grace of Almighty God amen so let's keep believing let's keep trusting that brothers sister that we are not far from the kingdom amen you know one legis but like our Lord and I violated it our Lord Himself being here and just think he was only ministering for three three and a half years what would he feel if he was ministry for over 50 years well I tell you he is experiencing it he's feeling it in in the ministry all the way down through by the grace of God and he can identify with the ministry feel for the ministry because well when he was here as God he was God in flesh and he was there you know and oh brother it wasn't it wasn't this was bothering him you know he said he had nowhere to lay his head they didn't bother you know and maybe he didn't have much when it comes to for food and that's why the devil tempted him speak to speak and turn this to breath turn the stones to bread and he's a mansion I live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God he put the emphasis on the word so he didn't have what you and I have when it comes to this world the comforts of this world know but yet he he had that faith of the world the kingdom of God he knew what it was like and brother after three and a half years of ministry he wanted to go back yeah how much longer sir shall I be with this faithless generation a man I wonder if that bothers you a lack of faith you know where people are trusting this trusting this trusting this were they that trusting the Lord a man through the grace of God to his brother my oh my oh my well what would we feel like if if we were like the woman that that wanted to this one of that jesus said is not me to give the tribbles bread to dogs and so on well she said her dog eats from the crumbs she said that falls from the master's table well when she answered like that and that she was acknowledging you know I'm no more than a dog who here is going to acknowledge her a dog yeah who's going to humble yourself and consider yourself well Lord yeah I thought I am I'm just a dog you know and because of that faith Jesus there's earning her faith just think a man and he knew that she was real she really meant what she said and oh my and he said go he said your fate your daughter's is well he meant she was she wanted she wanted prayer for her daughter jesus healed her daughter right because of that faith amen so what would Jesus do because of your faith recognizing your faith looking at your faith what's he gonna do for you and me so brother I pray oh god help us that we'd have the same attitude yet because of a faithless generation a man so he said how long shall I be with you how long shall I put up with you he said I can't stand it no longer amen see God and he and the sons and daughters of God are the same you can only go so long and bear bear with it so long then you want to get out of that atmosphere amen you're hungry and you're thirsting you're crying all you want faith you want the atmosphere of faith a man atmosphere of divine love by the grace of God and that reminds me that there's a couple of quotes I got here and and it's called don't take sides they met and it's in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen so it's a very strong this is a strong message and that is a strong quote a man concerning what God is looking for in you and me when it comes to our attitude and it's our attitude toward one another amen so let's be on our guard so you can have a copy of that quote on your way over tonight and I was I was blessed when when in fellowship with our brother Jonathan Kerr let that he had mentioned that that he was also in reading the book Christ as the mystery of God revealed a man 1963 I said you're reading that oh yes he said it just recently he said I've been going through it he may praise the name of the Lord amen so let's let's pay attention to what he said and let's let's by the grace of God keep the right attitude and the right spirit yeah if you don't have it you won't make it I tell you you're not cutting you the bride is going to have a right attitude and a right spirit amen and if you don't have it here you won't be there to have it that's true so let's make our calling and our election sure by the grace of Almighty God amen so grace of God and again I got away from the thought I was on mr. bender a man ages taken is totally yes sit yeah sister sadly told me a man that she felt that age was taking the stone amen a tree said was coming to its head that's what we're usually experiencing is in our heads amen so anyway the Lord bless us and keep us in the faith brother by the grace pressing on as our Lord looking for eternity not time one the world you wants to spend more time here for it's get let's get let's get out of here amen if our Lord brother and knowing the love that he had and the compassion that he had yet he just wanted to go a man but he was Pro pushing pushing pushing as I say it he got to the place where he was his face was was toward Jerusalem a man was right he stopped he stopped the signs and the wonders he stopped healing this to stop doing this to stop doing that it's but he's he was set toward Jerusalem and we are set toward the New Jerusalem by the grace of God a man because he knew that what he would experience in Jerusalem he was going to Aysen the day when he would go from time to eternity amen so grace of God to us brother we want to get out of here by grace amen I believe that's what God is looking for in you and in me because we can't stand it no longer this lack of faith amen so the Lord bless you and also to bring greetings from our brother Jonathan and no doubt maybe he is still in flight to British Columbia he's a long ways to go so God's grace to him and God bless him and he was absolutely shocked at the at the offering that we gave him and and he felt that I've got to give give some of this back to you that's he said that's what I'm going to do he said I can't take this I said well brother I said yes take it and I said don't give it back I said we gave it as I'm to the Lord amen and we thank the Lord I said for the word and we thank the Lord for our brother for his ministry a man so god bless our brother Jonathan amen and I pray the grace of God in his in his search for a home here in Newfoundland and I search for a job so the will of God be done for our brother Jonathan : amen and as they said I'd never dreamed maybe that brother Jonathan would come back this way again and with his family as I've said I preached to him when he was 2 years old now he's 40 years old preaching to us so god bless him a man and god bless the family amen for the not just his immediate family there but I'm referring to his mother and his and his and his brothers and his sisters amen grace so he thanks us for the offering and he expressed absolute shock over it and he wanted to give some of it back again but I told not to do amen yeah not many would do that no so I pray grace to our brother and also our brother John in Ottawa he sends his greetings to the Saints here and he said he said I will be at work tomorrow he said because they're waiting for me to set things up with them and he said he would update us later and he also sent greetings from his father in the Congo he said my father told me to greet you in the name of the Lord and he said to greet the church and he said he is very thankful he said considering what you did for me amen so I appreciate the help that we all gave him that we all stepped in to help our brother a man financially and of course spiritually as well so God blessed our brother John in Ottawa praise the Lord and also greetings from brother Chad he called this evening and he was on his way to Corner Brook and so we pray the grace of God with him he said he's not expecting the best weather out there and he said his it's very cold but he sends his greetings to the Saints here and he's praying for us and we'll pray for him that God give him a safe journey he's got a long ways to go amen and he said that his family is some of the members of his family is not well so we pray the grace of God to them amen again there's the promise amen that's right with His stripes we are eat by the grace of God so God help our sister Leah with those needs in the industry in the family and lay hands on them and proclaimed the promise amen because again this is this is hard there's a challenge to her faith as he said he said he can't believe in healing how can you believe for the rapture and there's too often too many is just just oh yeah that's right yeah yeah they go on it's just a thought in their head that's like brother Brown said concerning believing the message and he said he said but he said your your problem is he said you got a mental faith he said you got the message in your head but you don't have it in your heart and he brings that out also I think in this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed concerning mental faith versus spiritual faith intellectual faith versus spiritual faith and most today most believers today God got an intellectual faith but they don't have spiritual faith spiritual faith it's going to produce a spiritual life a man the life of Christ in their bright so it is it is serious just think about it don't don't don't just brush it off as just a quote just something the Provost said no no it's as God challenging our faith can we believe for healing or well it's a challenge are you believing for the rapture because why the rapture is a change of the body not just healing to the body it goes beyond that to a change a man we're going out of the out of the this body of flesh born in sin to a glorified body like is nuria's body how many here facing the challenge morning noon and night how many are claiming the problems not many God had mercy so that we're going to get beyond if the Provost said he said get beyond the intellectual faith he said in your head he said to a spiritual faith in your heart and many and he knew that in his preaching he knew that they were getting it in the head but they weren't getting it in their heart God have mercy that's why there's going to be very very few growing the rats they don't happy so grace of God be with us greetings to the Saints also from brother Chris and sister Ruth they were here and they enjoyed the services amen they were blessed amen so god bless brother Chris and sister Ruth amen so they are into the word and they walked the word amen so that's and brother why because fake off my hearing hearing by the word amen so grace of God that will get the word that God wants us to get and it's the word that'll give us the faith that pleases God and what is the faith that pleases God now really rapturing pay resurrection and rapturing fee amen that's what God is looking for in you and in me god help us also just to announce that by the grace of God I mentioned to brother Chad and he of course not surprising if I told you that he began to shout and scream and praise the Lord and I told him that brother Weiser I said is going to be baptized they said on Sunday morning I said 9 o'clock and he started to shout praise the Lord a man I don't know if anybody else heard of there but we heard him in here in in the city a man so being prayer for brother basil as we approach Sunday morning 9 o'clock at the tops of pong table some fine yeah tops that's upon troll yeah amen so and that's where we had the last baptism he meant right so be in prayer and as the Lord leads and that you that you will come and witness our brother Lazarus baptism they may have raised the name of the Lord it's been a long time since I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're going to deal with some of these things tonight and there's water baptism and we're going to hear the Prophet and he's just full remote maybe just over 20 minutes and he is ministering on water baptism and so we'll hear what he had to say concerning water baptism there's a lot of other things he gets into but we were bypassing that and just to get into what he said about water baptism and he'll be focusing on water baptism for about 20 just over 20 minutes so be in prayer and I pray God God gave not only for our brother by earlier but for all of us we need to be reminded of these things what is the significance of our water baptism what does it mean amen why is God requiring water baptism amen it is a manifestation of our faith a man what what faith repentance is a manifestation of faith it's a reaction to fate water baptism is a reaction to fate and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is God's response to our faith amen praise the name of the Lord so I trust by grace brother you what did you repent by faith did you get baptized in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by faith was it real faith a man and did God respond to that and give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost do you ever it's a challenge do you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Christ in me a man now Christ with me Christ it's Christ in me a man he said that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father and me I in you and you would be a man talk about a one brother through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and some received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's according to their faith before they're baptized and others received the baptism of the Holy Ghost after they're baptized a man we know that there is in in the book of Acts chapter 10 there there's the Gentiles that they receive what Peter was preaching to them and man and God responded to their faith and they were baptized with the Holy Ghost a van and Peter said can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized because they've received the Holy Ghost as we did and so on and so by the grace of God and so they were they were baptized in water the Gentiles a mayor to God be the glory so brother maybe brothers brother wise who have got the Holy Ghost God knows a man maybe you received it before you got baptized maybe you were some of you received it after you got baptized but I'll tell you this without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're lost why because God hasn't recognized your faith a man it is God the Provost said responding to your faith repent is your faith baptism is your faith amen your God looking at it see it's like George Beverly Shea when he came to the altar and repented and he and he just used there kneeling down on one knee and he had the other one up and he was up you know repenting and I think it was his father I believe it was or might have been his mother his father come by and says this get down on your knees too nice he says you're a sinner like everybody else and he and you need to repent a man oh yeah and he just felt you know I'm just gonna do this I'm gonna Lord forgive me yeah no he should get down and he's dead at home with yourself a man how many of us have humbled herself in repentance I remember crawling under the bed and got down to pray but I call them gonna be I should Oh God forgive me be merciful to me no amen Lord I'm repenting anymore please man grace of God yeah you repent you're really sorry for your scene yeah you're thanking God for what he did to redeem you through Christ as repentance again I like I like Billy Graham said remember that's the theme of this his ministry and the Ally's message was repentance and he said what is repentance he's repentance is he said you're going this way but then he said you hear the gospel you're here they got the message preached the word is preached and he says it and you're ordered to repent because you need Jesus as your Lord and Savior and then on the revelation of what he did he said you turn around if you're if you want to repent he's what you're doing if you turn around you're going this way but now you're going this way amen everything changes thoughts words and deeds amen your your your motives your your your desires objectives everything now you're not living for yourself no more you're living for Jesus not my real father don't be done amen repentance is changing your mind repentance is changing your thoughts you want his thoughts you want is will not your will amen praise the name of the Lord you're gonna do what God wants you to do when he wants you to do it where he wants you to do it and oh you want you to do that's repentance he meant it might be repentance that it brought our brother Elijah earlier oh yes amen doing what he wanted to do what God wanted him to do I believe that praise the Lord and praying that God responding to his fate gives him the Holy Ghost praise the Lord Alleluia so we're going to hear tonight the Prophet Minister for like I said just around 20 minutes over 20 minutes on water baptism and will share with you some Scripture but the round does go through a number of scriptures concerning a man and he begins don't get mixed up with without we're going to start a man and why I I skipped the previous paragraph but he went on and he highlighted this and then in the paragraph that we're going to start with its paragraph 38 and he said but to me he said I must be an old-fashioned Catholic well fast really old-fashioned and he now he's now saying Roman Catholic Catholic and he's not going back to the Roman Catholic Church he's going back to the to the Holy Ghost Church of the day of Pentecost so he said I must be an old-fashioned Catholic I must stay with what the early church did I must baptize according to the way the early church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and now should we try to keep that amen so understand he was referring to Roman Catholic by Catholic amen so the Lord blesses and God's grace to continue with us turn with me oh let's stand this thing only believe I'm sorry god bless yo stannis thing only believe and we have read a couple of scriptures Oh [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Oh hey man praise the Lord teacher [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen yes Lord we really are we pray for the movie to the spirit we pray for the anointing of the Holy Ghost we pray Lord for the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our hearts in our souls Lord a proof that you are in control father that we're not following again our leadership or the devil's leadership but we're following God's leadership nor we're following your leadership Alleluia according to your word Alleluia praise the Lord according to the anointing Lord amen of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Nord if there's ever anything that we needed it is the Holy Ghost father it is Christ in us it is Jesus in us it is God in us it is the father in a saint man it is a son in us father through the anointing of the Holy Ghost so I pray Lord that we have the witness we have the testimony then we have repented we have been baptized nor have we have received the Holy Ghost Father and again I proof nor that it is not me that lives in its Christ that liveth in me praise the name of the lord help us to let go and let God have his way help us to let go and let the Holy Ghost lead others to let go and let the Holy Ghost me in control amen praise the name of the Lord father giving us the revelation we need giving us the strength we need the encouragement we need amen it's all in the Word of God praise the name of the Lord so Lord we commit ourselves into your asking to God for the greater and jointing father asking for a double portion of the Holy Ghost Father in our souls a double portion of the Holy Ghost a man in our hearts all for the glory of God amen should we give you the preeminence hallelujah we're going to let you lead Nord we're going to consult the Lord in all circumstances in all situations through the power and 90 of the Holy Spirit we're gonna consult the Lord we're gonna seek your counsel your advice your leadership not my real father thine be done amen race I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ as father as we go into your word father I pray give us Lord grant to us the revelation the understanding and the wisdom that we need father so that it's not an intellectual faith in our heads but it's a spiritual Holy Ghost faith in our hearts granite Lord for your glory your honor I do so Lord that is not us living it's Christ it's the Holy Ghost living through us the only goes living in us for the glory of God hey bear Jesus in control granite Lord I pray for your glory your honor your praise amen encouraging us to press on to the resurrection press on to the rapture

you you love him amen he loved you and he loves you amen he said he promised in his law he said I'll never leave you nor forsake Amen hallelujah such law be said I'll be with you even in to the [Music] [Music] Oh praise the name of the Lord trusty Alleluia turn with me to the book of Job chapter 42 the book of Job chapter 42 a mad and beginning to read at verse 1 then job the Lord and said I know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be with olan from thee who is he that I did counsel without knowledge therefore a by others that I understood not a man he was wise in the eyes of the world but not in the eyes of God and God brought him to this place of repentance a man to change his thoughts the changes idea to move him from self righteousness to the righteousness of God a man-eater therefore a by uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not he's acknowledging it he's repenting and he said here I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me he said I have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now mine I see thee wherefore I am or myself a man yes sir he humbled himself to repent and brother the preaching of the word the revelation of the word gives us the revelation that we are sinners born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speak in lies in need of a savior in need of a redeemer sinners saved by grace unmerited favor hallelujah why is it unmerited because we were born dance in a man and we had no desire just just to do this just to do that but it was God's through the preaching of the word would change your nature a man to repentance praise the Lord he said now might I see at thee and where feiiow bore myself and repent god help us to have or ourselves o world i not Blake Joel oh yeah we're the same job most definitely a man we needed to get away from our self-righteousness to get the revelation of his righteousness so let's let's uh bore ourselves a man and he said and repent in dust and ashes a man he sought the Lord's forgiveness amen and yet just think right in there in the beginning of joke brother even he was very religious but not very spiritual a man he had a lot in his head but not in his heart and God wanted to deal with him conviction why because of the family that he had and Bible says that he was he was perfect and upright and one that feared God and aided evil yeah that's good but he saw that out there he saw God there he saw this there they evil there and all that but he didn't see it in here he didn't see it in himself self-righteousness and he said just think he said God loud all that to happen to Joel he said just to erase and wash away that little bit of self-righteousness what's he gonna do to you and what's he doing to you a man to get us to be humble oh he got job job humble himself he said I repent in dust and ashes a man I know where I come from he saw how we're going to go a man but yet he also knew he had a spiritual revelation not just physically yes spiritual and where he said with the sons of God shouted for joy the morning stars sang together and because God said where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth when this happened when that happened what job was there in the theophany a man you and I were there in TLC but and it says he feared God and eschewed evil but he didn't recognize the evil in his own flesh a man oh he offered sacrifices burnt offerings according to the number of his children for it is said it may be that my sons have sin curse God in their hearts and thus did Jobe continually a me but ah the devil come down so all but you're protecting him let me do this God said well go ahead he said but don't take his life now why would God permit the devil to do that because God saw something and joked at the rest didn't see a man God sees things in you then that others don't see and sometimes you don't see by God through the preacher of the word reduce it a man brings it out what for to keep us in a spirit of repentance I have repented and I repent and I repent you got the attitude of repentance humble yourself in the presence of God and job said I abhorred myself and repent in dust and ashes amen turn with me to the book of Acts and we'll go into the message of the Prophet we'll go back to chapter 2 and really we could go on for many hours just preaching on this when it comes to the book of Acts and the book of John and other scriptures a man concerning repentance brother the Jews felt only could do all they had to do was offer sacrifices offer this sacrifice offer that sacrifice do this then to keep their Sabbath and so on no they were still sinners and right and and the blood of the Lamb sacrifice only covered their scene it never took it away but just think of what the blood of the Lamb of God did with your sin it washed it away and it was went into the sea of forgetfulness what God doesn't remember it God doesn't see it no more as if you really got that true faith and then you're you really repented and you're reborn again you're a new creature in Christ he looks down a sees his son and his daughter a man you don't see no sin and no man can lay a charge against you I pray we got that faith amen we got that relationship with the Lord by the grace of God listen and in Acts chapter 2 that's read from verse 37 and when they heard this Peter had preached the word to them they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do they were convicted a man concerning the Messiah convicted concerning his death his burial and his resurrection they wanted to identify with him they said what shall we do and then Peter said unto them repent be sorry for what you amen and be baptized every one of you in the name not names in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins amen and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost and where was it yeah that's it receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and under your children and all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this on toward generation and then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 Souls amen we thank God for two or three now not 3,000 braise the Lord and again the miss understanding of the water baptism concerning they go baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Jesus said go teach to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost but I was only one name amen and the Prophet brings this out in this in these few minutes that he's got a ministry amen so it's about but just over 20 minutes amen concerning baptism and he explains every every detail and he gives scripture after scripture after scripture amen so listen don't just assume because I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't need to hear it we do need to hear it and thank God for the understanding and the revelation amen Lord bless you you may be seated amen but to me I must be an old-fashioned Catholic I'm a stable I must be an old-fashioned Catholic i'ma stay with what the early church did and I must baptize according to the way the early church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and now we try to keep that now that I might say this in Matthew 28:19 jesus said go ye therefore teach all nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and all the Holy Ghost bhana one of them he never said in the name of the Father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost he said in the name Sanger great scholars like Scofield knows in the original Greek all in in the all translations it's in the name not names or in the name of the Father in the name of the son it's in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost well father is not a name neither is Sunnat II and neither is Holy Ghost a name it's titles that goes to one name see there's one name that if the revelation that we are trying to bring to you surely must have been the same revelation that the Apostles had when they stood by listen at him give that Commission someone said well I don't care what the Apostles done Jesus said this if the Apostles disobeyed and then the Scriptures are wrong you have to make the Scriptures perfect are there not nothing it's every word right oh it's none of it right I don't know which would be right if at all isn't right if part of it isn't inspired than the rest of it might not be but there's not a contradiction in the scriptures so if Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and all after that was baptized the name of Jesus Christ and Jesus said go baptize the name of father son Holy Ghost that's a lie contradiction looks like but it isn't if you just know remember the scriptures are hid from the eyes of the wise and students did you know that and to be revealed the Scriptures doesn't contradicts itself it only declares itself now if you turn back if you're reading a story like you said John and Mary live happy ever after as some of you we all guilty of reading stories and if you didn't know who John and Mary was the only thing you could do is turn back to the first book and read through and find out who John and Mary was if Jesus commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost and father's not a name and Sons not a name and Holy Ghost is not a name we better go back and find out who Father Son and Holy Ghost is and what his name is so if you would turn with me to the first chapter of Matthew like you would have any book it said now the give me the geologist it said now the birth of Jesus Christ is on this wise when his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph engaged otherwise now I want to show you how look we're going to say this is the son Jesus this is the father this is the Holy Ghost now anybody knows and Jesus said that God was his father you believe that we'd have to the father of Jesus Christ was God I'm quoting scripture Matthew 1:18 the birth of Jesus Christ was on this one when his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before she they came together she was found with the child of the Holy Ghost and which one of these is his father and she shall bring forth the child they shall call his name Jesus notice she was and when Joseph her husband being a just man not willingly to make her a public example was minded to put it away privately on this one but when he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream in Saint Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee thy wife Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost but how could God be his father if the Holy Ghost is his father you'd have two fathers and what kind of a child would he be there's no tooth the Holy Ghost that God is the same thing see and she shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Jesus all this was done that it might be fulfilled which spoke to the Lord by the Prophet saying a virgin shall conceive and bear a child and he shall be called a manual which is why God with us now here's the son on the day of his baptizing in Jordan John Barrow records seen the Spirit of God like a dove coming and dwelling on him jesus said it's not me to do if the works it's my father that dwelleth in me now Father Son and Holy Ghost has one name then three titles and what did the Bible say that name was Jesus so that must have been the revelation that the Apostles had for that's the way they baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost is not a name none of them redeems the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost it was the Lord Jesus Christ that's the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost now I shall read some scriptures just before we I want to read first on the first occasion for the water baptism and that's found in acts the second chapter Peter at the day of Pentecost he'd been preaching and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises in the you and to your children for them as far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call then the next time we have baptism recorded is from Philip two days after each what down to sumerians and with Jews and then when there's only three tribes of people in the earth that's ham Shem and Japheth people Jews Gentiles and helped you and Gentiles Samaritan when Philip went out and preached to the Samaritans here's what taking place this one Simon the sorcerer was bewitching people by sorcery but when they believed Philip preaching the things pertaining to the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both man and women the next time baptism is spoke of is found in acts 10:44 248 at the house of Cornelius the Gentile there's the Jews at Jerusalem Philip that Samaria and here's Peter with the Gentile and while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word and they are the circumcision Jew which bully he were astonished as many as came that Peter because on the Gentiles was also poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God that answer Peter can a man forbid water that these should not be baptized and he commanded them who has received the Holy Ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord he prayed for them the next time baptism is spoke of is an acts 19 where they come up on the disciples of John this is Paul now this enclosed acts 19 and it came to pass while Apollo's is at carrieth Paul having passed through the upper coast of Ephesus he finds certain disciples and he said unto them I watched they were disciples they were believers Christians he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto Him we have not so much as heard whether there would be any Holy Ghost listen what he is listen to this essential question of this apostle an and he said unto them until what then were you baptized and they said unto Him under John's baptism now I had imagined this morning if either any of us have been baptized by the same man that baptized Jesus Christ we think our baptisms pretty well secured when you think so but you're as Paul says it isn't in the same hole of water by the same man that baptized our Lord Paul condemns that baptism now because it wasn't in the name of Jesus Christ now listen and he said until what then were you baptized now if you want to look at up in the Greek he said how was your baptized see and they said unto Him under John's baptism then said paul john barely baptized on the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him that's come that is on jesus christ notice this same group had been baptized in the Jordan with Jesus Christ when they heard this they were rebaptised they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ pauling his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied now the Saint Paul says here in the book of Galatians this is why hang to it Galatians the first chapter and the eighth verse listen I'm going to get this at the sixth verse speaking to the Galatians I'm marvelous she'd be so soon removed from him that called you unto grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and prevent the gospel of Christ but though we are an angel from heaven there would be priests Pope preacher whatever it might be though we are angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed and added and we said before so now I say again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received let him be accursed if we shall take one word away from the Bible revelations 21 or 22 and or add one thing to it knowingly the same will be taken out of the book of life for us therefore it is my convictions know disregarding two people who wants to be sprinkled poured or immersed and father son Holy Ghost that's deliberately up to you my dear brother sister I will not disagree with you on this you're God's servant but to me I must be faithful and true to the Bible therefore Paul commanded people that had been baptized some other way besides the name of Jesus Christ and constrain them to come and D read Tai's again in the name of Jesus Christ to preach that same gospel I've got to do the same thing the restraining to persuade people don't never leave your church stay with your pastor do everything you can in your own local church but follow the Bible instructions therefore we believe this morning that Jesus is coming and when I stand that day now maybe the creed book might be all right I can't disregarded it might be all right but and maybe the Catholic Church does have that authority I don't know and if you're Catholic Chur and you think your church has that authority this they say is their original book so will I take what some modern man said when Christ the founder of your church commissioned this when your first pope commissioned this let's follow the Bible where I believe that is the truth now while we are preparing I want those who are to be baptized to come forward and stand up here so we can show to the world that we believe that Jesus living he loved us dying he saved us buried he carried our sins far away rising he justified freely forever believe someday he's coming waiting for that glorious day and you're coming this morning to confess that that's sin that I've preached about this morning the sins of the world has been condemned and killed and you no more serve it to that thing but it's dead and you're coming to be buried in the name of him who died for you and kill sin for you and rose for your justification and you are complete in him not in no church not in the random Tabernacle not an association but you are complete and safe in Jesus Christ let us pray Lord this sometimes seems to be hard for I know that I have precious French air of the Catholic faith and some of the Wesleyan Methodist and no doubt many of the Trinitarian extreme we believe Lord that Father Son and Holy Ghost is the same God but three offices that the God of heaven served in one time for the Jews in the Fatherhood once then flesh as the sonship and now in the Holy Ghost in the church not three gods we do not believe father or you cannot deny your own Word when there's no other God except you you said I'm the LORD thy God thou shalt have no other gods and we believe Lord that this one true God lived in three different dispensations under the law under the Christian dispensation when crisis on earth in a body of flesh that was born of the Virgin Mary died rose again and has redeemed us the church and now in the form of the Holy Ghost the witness of the resurrection lives in our lives forgive us of our sins now pray that you'll bless every person here regardless of church affiliations or denomination there are human beings that live and eat and love and want to go to heaven they're like us all and we we are we are not trying to dishonor anything or any work that anybody has done in your name but we're only trying to give a statement of the hope that lies within us based upon thy word thy Word is truth so we pray father that if there be some here that you would desire to have them rebaptised let them come forward and those who have never made a Christian confession that's coming out to be baptized in the name of the risen Lord what a beautiful time to do it only Easter morning what makes baptisms because there was an Easter grant Lord that whosoever shall come may be blessed and fill with the Holy Spirit as they are desiring soul or we asked it in Jesus name Amen amen now those that have come for baptism would you just stand to your feet so we could get a general conception of who is to be baptized there will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 of them all right I got yours back there sister in the bank now I wished you all would if you would walk right barber here just a moment would you would you play for us sister I can understand your calling quietly as you can slowly and as I see coming down the line knowing the people's I'll see people from out of town from churches that would really think I was just a little bit off of line by baptizing people you move right out this way a little bit brother saw these back here about baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus but I have truly tried to make it as clear as I know how to make it now this is a nice group of people I wish I'll turn right around to the audience like this these people standing here are coming up on the basis that they believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God that he was suffered under Pontius Pilate and was crucified on Calvary died buried rose the third day triumph over death hell and the grave and ascended up on high setting at the right hand of the Majesty to make intercessions upon their confession they have now shown to you that they believe this solemnly with all their heart and have confessed their sins before God and are convinced that Jesus is the Son of God and has accepted him as personal Savior if that be so raise your hands all of you stand around like that it's raised there for some of them has been Christians for a long time some of those have been baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and they are convinced today that that the scripture and Apostolic way of baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they have come believing this and have accepted it and embracing this and will think that that's the truth because the scripture teaches it if such a standing in the line would you raise your hands you who have been baptized before and will in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost and now believe in the Lord Jesus Christ thank you O Lord creator of heavens and earth altar of everlasting life here stands man women boys and girls they have to lead here to this Easter tomb Oh God someday maybe this day yet I've got to stand with an at the judgment bar and when the great boss comes forward in his great kingly garments as a minister of the gospel I've got to stand before this open Bible and give an account for what I've talked to people ah dread Lord and fear godly fear unless I should teach something that was wrong and then all that I've done would be thrown away or you said till heavens and earth pass away not one word of mind shall pass away and you have said let all man's word be wrong and yours be right therefore Lord I am as the servant of yours and days gone by constraining them to come and be rebaptised again that I might say that at that day that I have done a hole that I don't know how to do the face of criticisms and want more but tried to live true to this Bible grant Lord if their life will be enriched and blessed and maybe they won't for nothing may the Holy Ghost come upon each of them that has not received him as yet may this be a resurrecting time that this group of people will be resurrected and this church will be charged with the power of the resurrected Jesus may we go from this building today saying good night our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the road grandfather is your servant but these material things are we go far burn out to obey your Commandments in the name of Jesus Christ your son Amy a man clearly explained I try to clearly believe it concerning water baptism that we're going back as he said I'm an old-fashioned Catholic and an old-time Catholic to go back not to when the Catholic Church started to go back to before the Catholic Church started because that's spoken of again as prophesied in the in the book of in the book of revelations concerning the church ages amen because God was discerning that spirit even in the first church age and have referred to as the deeds of the Nicolaitans a man there was a spirit on the move a man too to overcome that the control and leadership of the Holy Spirit amen there was another spirit to conquer the laity a man chose to put man in charge to put the priesthood in church to put a church in charge and you had to be subjected to that leadership a man but he said you hate those deeds of the Nicolaitans he said which I also ate but that spirit came more and more in any way and went from his just the deeds of the Nicolaitans eventually it became a doctrine of the Nicolaitans so we have traced that down through the church ages it was this it was this then it became a doctrine and then it came under yeah I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants and to commit fornication to eat things sacrificed unto idols and what was it it was the Catholic Church coming more and more in control it was man coming more and more in control it was orga they were it was organized religion amen and they were going again from the spiritual revelation to going back to the intellectual knowledge of the word in their heads amen and and the problem God I like this in the revelation of the seven Church ages beginning with the light of the revealed word on the day of Pentecost but the deeds of the Nicolaitans came they were they were there and this is what this dark little bit of darkness is an indication of the deeds from their claims are going on to a doctrine of the Nicolaitans till eventually it became an organized religion controlling a man controlling faith controlling religion a man but again there was always an a there's always a few that didn't that didn't go under them and stay with them or come under their influence but the majority they'd eventually come under their influence and it was organized religion but God promised that he was going to restore and brother in this organized religion there was something like almost 68 million that were martyred and they laid down their lives for the truth a man that they wouldn't they wouldn't go along with it they wouldn't stay with it no they're going to stay with the word stay with the revelation that everything started with on the day of Pentecost and then brother but again what did they wonderful things they change was was one of apt ISM a man and it went from of course eventually it went from adult baptism to - it to children baptizing babies dedicating yeah baptizing babies they were just pulled in water on their foreheads I've seen that done now not only in the Catholic Church and there are other churches as well amen but it became it became adding a denomination organized religion but there's always a few in every age that didn't didn't go along with their state away from it and many as I said laid down their lives they died for it amen they die they give up their land and they heard that ours coming again amen but the bride is not going to be not going to experience that she won't be so she wants off for that he's gonna take the bride out he promised that amen but there they're going to be those again mother been referred to them as the foolish virgins they're virgins but they're foolish a man and they and they lack the anointing of the Holy Ghost he meant because there did you went on with with religion religion religion but again they had an experience because he said they were virgins they were separated they were virgins a man and of course when they did they realize all the rapture well it already happened they didn't know it amen because they never had the extra lender into it I trust we got the extra please may you tell them make your call and election sure make your rapture short amen make sure that your your you're in the process to be changed from time to eternity a man and brother it's the HC anointing it's the anointing that God is giving us through the revealed word because God restored what was lost down through the dark ages and what was changed from from the the Word of God by the Holy Ghost and just changed to a denominational Creed and and a false baptism and a false this and the false that and then they they just did away with the name and they said just repent and be baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost amen oh yeah they put the name out they did away with the name but God said he was going to restore and bring it back again and that's exactly the truth and brother been buddy in the restoration of course there was Luther and Wesley and then of course the Pentecostal age and so on and with the penico with the Pentecostal age there was baptism but again they stayed with the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost I was in 1965 I was baptized in the Pentecostal church and they baptize me in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost now and it was again it was in June of 66 that I got the revelation of the name and in July brother Bill agate baptized me in the river in Bashar Falls he said according to the he said Lord according to your command he said to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost I baptized my brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen because this same Jesus was made both Lord and Christ amen to identify that it was it was God amen it was not just Oh this is just Jesus no but it was God in Christ and it was the Holy Ghost in Christ by the grace of God remember he laid down his life but he picked it up again to share the the Holy Ghost with you and me a man he come back praise the name he said I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you see again like I said that Pentecostal pastor that I said some books to any and he just sent back the books and and he said oh he said you don't believe the Trinity he said but he said read there he said there is a Trinity I Jesus I will pray the father - he said that he was saying you a comforter the Holy Ghost and that's the only scripture he gave me and like I told you I were I wrote back and I said brother you need to go on down and read a few more verses that same chapter Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you I said who's the comforter is Jesus and he said in that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father and me I in you and you would me so I said it's not three he's all one by the grace of God by the anointing of the Holy Ghost a man the father came to reveal himself in the son amen and then the son is revealing God through the Holy Ghost in the right and any sons and daughters praise the Lord but again God God God began to restore back that which was lost during the dark ages amen he got Luther out of it but then they organised and he got to Methodist out of it then they organized then they went on to others and others and others and they organized and so on - Bonnie come with the Pentecostals and they organized and even the UPC the United Pentecostals they organized come denominational any man and they wouldn't receive when God come on the scene with the revealed word they all turned it down they met they just didn't didn't recognize what God was doing or they recognize what God did in the end of apt ISM of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal what God did and Luthor's revival Wesley's revival yeah but at the third or fourth generation made a denomination out of it that's right and so God when it comes to the Lutheran's they made a denomination so God moved on and he wanted to reveal something else there's other things he had to restore but but man was so organized so God had to move on beyond Luther and beyond others groups did that maybe broke away from Luther but they were still organized still denominations and so on so God had to raise up John Wesley a mayor right and it wasn't wasn't the church wasn't a denomination no but after Wesley they organized they and no no they broke off again into different groups different churches but it's all denominational and so and the prophet of God said that's why God raised up with him move with redhot salvation yeah he was red-hot salvation a man what for he's because the Methodists had organized so quickly he said God had to raise up wouldn't move to carry the message on to the Pentecostal age yeah that's what he did amen and then of course didn't the Pentecostals came and it wasn't very long only three or four years after the Pentecostal revival that they organized they became denominated a man and they were focusing on this and focusing on that but but they wouldn't continue on in the word they wouldn't continue on in the revelation Amen and it was in 1933 that God brought the Prophet on the scene in 1933 that the the angel of God came down the pillar fire came down when the problem was baptizing in the Ohio River and and we were we were there three years ago I guess when our brother Joseph Paul was married down there and we went we went down to Jeffersonville area and so on and the brother took us to the part that part of the river and the Ohio River and he said now he said this is where the pillar of fire came down and so on and in 1933 voice it's amazing and and ordained and commissioned the Prophet that as John forerun the first coming he said you're going to forerun the second coming with his message a man that scripture that's not what why would we find that hard to believe brother he'd look what he did in his first coming he would do the same in his second coming that wouldn't that wouldn't be seemed seem hard or our contrary to the Word of God because again we know that it is Scripture because John was Malachi 4 but John did willfully at all and Jesus identified that John came and turned the hearts of the Jewish fathers to their credit costal children and now in the last days he said in that Malachi was going to he's going to send a messenger a prophet and what was he going to do turn the hearts of the Pentecostal children back to the father's a man right why because they got away from them from the original Pentecostal revival a man and the stand they took then and the life that they were living then and what they were the holiness they were teaching then they got worldly and and they got away from the the full revelation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal revival a man and so the prophet of God came on the scene a man what for the for rung the second coming of Jesus for the bride amen he came to redeem the bride now he come for the bride then he'll come with his bride amen to set up a ring upon the earth during the great millennial reign amen by the grace of God so brother that's Scripture it's like the prophet of God bring you know concerning water veteran scripture scripture father son Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ and so on a man from titles to the name titles to the east and it's one me in the name now names because if there's reached free persons it was plural and have you had to go baptize in the names of the Father Son and Holy Ghost if to the Trinity it's not a Trinity a man although even our brother Ray dear who did this Bible our mother Schofield he was credit area yeah but again but we see by the revelation of the word that it is not names it is not three persons it's one person see it's just amazing is this God doing this God doing that oh they knew him as this is Jehovah yeah then we then he then we came he came and he down and he was known as Jesus a man then he went back up and come back again in a different form and he's known as the Holy Ghost amen same one it is the same God praise the name of the Lord for that revelation amen and so God set problem promise to Malachi 4:2 for run the second coming a man and brother to forerun the second coming the mystery of God would be revealed in Revelation 10 and so on a man and an understand always and he's not in the church ages no he's in the bride age why because five of the seven ages were commanded to repent repent repent repent and so on and when he got to the seventh age he was put out don't put him out of your life but yet I know there are believers who got to put it it said that that there are so many believers they go to church on a regular basis why well I'm a believer what do you mean you're a believer oh I believe the message that God sent you William Branham that's all and and just a form of godliness they'll go to church and worship yeah yeah Lord yes right Lord that's what you revealed that's what you did Lord yeah thank you lord yeah and they go on when they go out it's forgotten oh if anybody were to question them or just I'm a believer I what do you mean your believer or we believe that God sent a prophet we believe that that he did this and he did that we that he revealed this you revealed that yeah but like brother Brown said it's all mental faith there are so many believers that are that have a mental thing it's all in their heads but not in their hearts because they won't still live their lives this way this way oh yeah they're again like the foolish virgin for virgins but they don't have wisdom of the wise no no no they're not allowing the message to govern everything they do oh yes the sister will still have long hair and and certain clothes and so on and the brothers will allow that oh I can't do that because I don't believe that I'm a believer I'm believer no you're a son of God you're born again that's what gives you a new creep the new new hunger thirst a man I think but no there's too many astir just going by the letter of the word they're going by the intellectual knowledge of the word and again like I said the prophet of God was identifying these things as he was getting near the end of his ministry and God was gonna take him off the scene yeah but he was he was God was leaving the warning to the people just saying and I think it's this message again crisis the mystery of God revealed where he talks about the intellectual faith in their heads versus the faith that God's looking for in your heart in your soul where do you have the revelation of this word in your head or in your heart why are you here because of intellectual conviction or it's a spiritual Holy Ghost conviction it said but again to make your car unless your Shores make sure you got it in your heart not in your head make sure you got it by your spiritual revelry and it controls you it governs you your attitude your spirit your actions and your reactions yeah you're not you're not like you used to be no more you know you're born again you're a new creature and and what are you reflecting they're reflecting the word - reflecting the message a man in your in your attitudes in your spirit not just by going to church not to pee by you having long hair or our sister having a certain clothes on you know our brother with this is they're short and so on and modest dinner there and modest there no no no no it is the anointing that controls your life your thoughts your motives your objectives everything now you're governed by the Holy Ghost even it's in your job but I don't care where it is it's the Holy Ghost it's God in control oh yes Jesus living in you it's like I've said whether I was a cook or a janitor or or working in in again in kitchens or whatever or in the retail business you know I was just did it for the Lord oh yeah the Lord was with me if I was there I wonder when I started one time in the in the Jannah in the business in it there's no stores that I was the insurance they put me in charge of the men's department then the boys department and then the footwear and and they just kept adding to it but I am me so much because I was there for a number of years until I became the manager of that store and they said to me they said are you a preacher oh I said I don't know I said I do I said AB encoding me sometimes I exhort the people or something not an over a preacher or not all I said okay we just we just thought you were you seem to be one so I you leave that impression with the people they know you're a Christian they know and now I'm not you're not you're not denominational they know that - they'll know that by the life you live but by why would you talk and how you act now you're wrecked and don't don't carry it carry on foolish not by any means no way because you're you're you're not what are you doing you're not you're not reflecting Christ the way you should reflecting Jesus the way you should by the grace of God so god help us brother in my prayer so make your call and election shore see if God is not only in you in church see if God is in you outside of church see if God is in you where you're doing your work see if God is in you in school oh yeah praise the Lord and again they knew that even in the school I attended and I'm not saying that for myself I've seen that for the Jude give the glory to God it's not me it's Christ and they knew that they knew what to say and how to say it they knew what they should not say and when I'm we're not when I was there or it she just changed the atmosphere and like I said I'll come it was the Lord for the for that that man to say what he said to me he said mister lush he said you're going to be a pastor I say I don't know boy yes he said you're going to be a pastor and I was only in great grade 11 or great and I'm not sure like I said I only got a diploma for grade 9 but he said yes and he wanted to know if I was going to take my course in Memorial University to be a pastor I said I don't think so I'll leave that with the Lord I said I said whatever the Lord wants me to do I'll do so ok said good and and that that man he's in his 80s are close to 90 now I guess but he still respects me oh yeah so I'm a I admit him and and witness to him by the grace of God praise the Lord so brother sister are you gonna rise in judgment against those you're working are you gonna rise in judgment against friends family or whatever oh yeah probably God said that's the way it's going to be see if you're living for grace and he said you live for this one in the in the presence of this one you reflect Christ through this ear and ear in here and he said one day when they rise in judgment and then they'll say well I didn't know this and I didn't know that no no no no I didn't see this and when else and and the Pavle God said and he said the Lord is flash it on the sky and he said what he said like a video he said of you he said the life you lived he said in the in the presence of that person the spirit you had and the attitude that you had and what you said in there for him the presence of that person hell I brought this I when I when I when I did sister burns us funeral and I said listen I said the Word was made flesh I said I lived in gamla I said yeah and I said even the neighbors there was coming to the judgment the judgment seat of God and I said God will say listen I was made flesh in gambler they said no I didn't see you and he'll funnel on the sky what sister burns and brother burns in that house everybody do oh yeah everybody in the Middlebrook knew that was that else was different almost definitely yeah they knew that and the atmosphere was different everything was different in that house amen as I said that even a child would go in there because he liked the atmosphere and there's just brother-sister burns or sometimes just sister burns yeah and even another clergy other than of a certain church would go in and pray with them because they liked the atmosphere because it wasn't their atmosphere was the Holy Ghost yeah and so glad by the grace of God that her brother Jonathan got cut that revelation that I was talking about sister burns his testimony and he went and told it to his church accident I said what yeah I said you should have struck me and he said so I went and I stirred a he was ministering in British Columbia and he told about sister burns and know that she was washing clothes in her pantry there and and and for two so many hours there the devil talked to her and the atmosphere got dark dark got darker and darker and darker and she was listening to the devil and he was just telling her the negative the negative two negative things about her life and so on oh yeah until finally he struck the seed she turned around she said Satan you've been talking to me for two hours and so on this and that now she said I got something to tell you and she began to rebuke him and she pleaded plead the blood of Christ and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ she saw I rebuke Satan and she said the atmosphere went from dark to bright light Amen hallelujah and he went told told it to his church and her brother was there you know the brother and he said sister Barnes and brother Jonathan said yes sister burns oh my said I was in that house yeah yeah so it was a Newfoundlander and he said I was in that house he said many years ago yeah and he and he knew both sister burns and brother burns they were spiritual praise the Lord brother I pray God that we have that anointing on us now yeah and remember if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you Creed you create an atmosphere you do oh yeah most definitely you could I've added those testimonies to where people were experiencing this experiencing that they say whoa when he come in everything changed or when that won't come in everything changed what the atmosphere change they went from dark to light yeah from heavy to light by the grace of God so brother grace make our calling and election sure amen oh the scriptures oh yes yeah as I said revelation to church ages five of those seven churches ages were commanded to repent a man they needed to turn around and not go the way of a church let's go the way of the word by the grace of God very penton's is not going your way is going God's Way Lord forgive me for going my own way forgive me for doing my own thing forgive me for thinking this and thinking that Lord forgive me please Jesus and you repent and you turn around and your everything has changed thought word and deed you're a new creature in Christ praise the Lord amen so brother sister what is water baptism or she's being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because I repented and then I heard the Bible said get baptized yes but what is it it's a it's a testimony of your faith in the death burial and resurrection of Jesus amen because as he died was buried so you're you repented no Lord I'm going to experience death amen I'm gonna be I'm gonna be buried because I believe that I'm gonna die to myself and die to the world and the things of the world how to new you I'm gonna become a new creature in Christ and I'm gonna rise again amen so you believe in the death burial and resurrection water baptism represents that a man so you're going to go in go down a man and by the grace of God and by you by your faith nor time I want to die to myself so I don't let her come a new creature in Christ when I rise up amen with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord we pray the grace of God to our brother by show we pray the gray I pray the grace of God to every one of us brother sister that we got that we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost God confirming your faith amen and if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah your spiritual in your thoughts your words your deed direct you act spiritually talk spiritual live spiritual a man giving preeminence to Jesus grace it's not me that leaves us Christ living in me and I not living for myself I'm living for the Lord a man and I'm living for the promises of God in his word lord help me to go out and be a witness of your word amen reflect your word the promise of your word whether as Luther witnessing about justification sanctification and Wesley and the of the batches when the Pentecostals for us now it is the resurrection and the rapture it is the coming of the Lord our lives amen Luther went out and reflected justification others when I reflected what God had revealed to them are we reflecting what God is and he's revealing to us that this is the end amen look up because this is the hour for the resurrection this is the hour for the rapture you're going down you're going to leave here amen so that our Amen so that our our faces are set to the New Jerusalem as Jesus was to the old Jerusalem oh yeah why he approached the revelation of the third pole and and what was ordained for him to experience amen so he would get out of time and into eternity and we've come to that place again to go from time to eternity this is the hour this is the time this is the end to get at a time back into the kingdom of God hallelujah brother you're living every day looking for the rapture every day looking for the resurrection every day a man this time when I'd been out and in in a mall or I see I see see crowds and I see individuals that I thought I could that I knew and I said oh Lord I said that's not sister so and so was it that's not brother so-and-so because the dead in Christ are going to appear to us are we going to be in the spirit to recognize it oh yeah you got to be in the spirit to recognize it feel what the Holy Ghost they're going to appear to us and then we're going to go step right into our theophany bodies into a glorified body and rise to meet the lord of the air by the grace of God see look at Jesus life look at Jesus ministry look look how he lived it look what he did and when he got to near the end of his earthly ministry and brother now is Christ in the bright are we going to act the same way Jesus act are we going to feel the same way Jesus felt are we gonna add the revelation that Jesus had concerning the end of his ministry cuz during the end of our ministry and the end of our witness and testimony that now as it was then Jesus laid down his light resurrected it picked it up raptured it amen and the Old Testament Saints raptured with him but now I see it it's the end just a Gentile saints of God brother they're waiting for the resurrections are waiting to get him to their glorified bodies by the grace of God and brother how much I must really how much of a hunger and thirst do we have to get out of here I pray that we lent the same anointing that Jesus ain't it caused him to cry are you cried and he cried and cried and cried amen he or he was so burdened so burdened he said I can't he said I want to go home he said I am no more in this world can you say that about you but still there's a lot of believers just there more in this world and the more conscious of this world that the air of the world to come but a closer we're getting to the end that will get more conscious of the world to come oh yeah by the whole baptism of the Holy Ghost by the grace of God amen so I pray grace god help us amen there with me I'll just read a scripture oh sorry amen praise the Lord he said there were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices and Jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all Galileans because they suffered such things I tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish anything God's looking for in our hearts is repentance God is desiring that we have a repentant attitude a repentant spirit a man even after you become a new creature in Christ you're born again we have that spirit of repentance he said if we sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous we have a repentant attitude repentant spirit morning noon and night Lord forgive me for wrong thoughts forgive me for wrong wrong words wrong deeds wrong actions Lord amen let these quotes challenge us don't take sides amen don't take sighs amen because sometimes it's self-righteousness the constant you to take a side against this against that against that person no no don't take sides no either leave it with the Lord by the grace of God amen just one more scripture when Jesus heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of Zebulun the land of Nephilim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people sat in darkness saw great light and to them we said in the region and the shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at an amen how much more can we say repent because the kingdom of heaven is that in amen the resurrection is that an the rapture is that a by the grace of Almighty God amen let's get ready to go from time to eternity to the kingdom of God not the kingdom of this world but the kingdom of God oh I'm longing to get there maybe God's just waiting on our brother of ISIL to be baptized amen amen never know then it might spark it might trigger the change he meant by the grace of God amen but so god bless our brother by show he may not thank God for his testimony thank God for his desire hunger but for to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen - good - what - bear witness to the world could we witness a man to the Lord he believes that Jesus died but rose again hey man and now I that brother we died to ourselves and we rise and experience the resurrection in the new birth praise the Lord it becomes a new creature in Christ hallelujah resurrection in our souls right the rapture in our souls yeah you at the quicken you as he resurrected you as he made alive who were dead in sins and trespasses and then he raptured us into every place was in Christ
