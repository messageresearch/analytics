Hallelujah Lord what security we have this evening lord it's not based on our performance it's not based on our family it's not based on our church it's not based on our ministry Lord but it's based on a finished work Lord we're already placed next to you as joint teirs Lord we just have to go through this little bubble of Time Lord I pray you just strengthen us this evening Lord that you'd encourage Us by seeing where we stand Lord in your presence Lord where our souls sit this evening Lord by the Heritage that we have as Sons and Daughters of God lord I pray that as the word would come forth Lord that it would Quicken our minds Lord it would change our thoughts Lord it would change our very bodies Lord and bring them into the subjection that your word offers Heavenly Father Lord Lift us up to higher Heights Lord anchor us a little deeper strengthen us encourage us Lord God I pray tonight we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you turn if you would to First Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 good to be back in the house of the Lord we certainly have some New Finland weather going on and then I was saying I left to go to Ed to Montreal in Edmonton it was sunny and 20 degrees and I came back and I don't think we've hit it since so I got the best before it left but we're certainly into uh the fall now amen couple announcements uh brother Mark will be taking the service on October 16th while I'm away in Charlotte Town PEI he'll probably finish up his redemption or or continue his Redemption uh teaching that he's been doing and I actually got some time to finish it myself there today really enjoyed it and had a number of scriptures already in here that we're going to touch on and maybe go into some more specifics than what he did but uh I just certainly enjoyed it and trusting that you all are as well I got good report anden sister Katrina but from Springdale sent us a letter uh this this week and and just wanted us to pray for her she said she she'd Fallen away and she's come back to the Lord and so she's living in Springdale and so I don't know if she's listening here tonight or if she'll listen but I say she's always welcome to come visit we have lots of beds available we have lots of houses available for fellowship and to host her so that all she has to do is get here and we can take care of the rest so God bless her amen I believe we're at the the very end of of time amen there's people that have to come back because when that last one's sealed then we get to go amen so just trusting that's one more that had to come in before we can get out of here so that means there's one less that has to come in church we're one less closer one more closer than we were before we uh before we came into service tonight amen so I think that's just a wonderful thing and I I just pray the Lord will bless her fill her with his spirit and just feed her by the word of God amen amen it's good to have sister Kimberly back with us I know she hadn't been feeling well good to see her back in church and of course young Wesley as well amen God bless you 1 Peter 1 and22 we uh we read this last service and we're going to continue from here it says seen ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and I I want to take a second one on what is the Holy Ghost and then a second or a a third on the Holy Ghost and then and then what is the new birth for a second service and we'll we'll kind of wrap this up this this evening on on what is the new birth and I I haven't gone exhaustively into it but I just want to cover this maybe more so for the young people in particular and and some of those that are listening online that wonder about this and we know we read last service when Nicodemus came to Jesus Jesus said the there's a requirement to be born again you have to have the new birth if you want to understand God if you want to understand the kingdom of God then you need to have the new birth it was a requirement and we know that the new birth is a a work of God from start to finish amen it's a work of Grace never think for a second that it's it's something you did or something that I did or anything like that we may have parts to play in it but I didn't find God God found me I didn't call to God God Called To Me amen I didn't reach out to God God reached out to me and then I just responded to that and that that's why I can have the new birth and that's why you can have the new birth today and and that's the security I have church that SEC security we have today is not that I started it it's that he started it because if I went to him then I can walk away from him amen if I reached out to him then I can pull back amen if I was the one that started it then I'm the one that can finish it but since he's the one that started since he's the one that called since he's the one that reached out then my security is in his actions not in mine amen cuz God never starts something that he's not going to finish we know Paul said in Philipp he says being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ now that means the work isn't done till we get out of here me that means that until the day we go then he's continuing to work on us and he's continuing to refine us and mold us and shape us and test us and try us to produce that character that's required of that end time bride amen that day of Jesus Christ is the day when he's United with his Earthly bride with his Earthly bride and so that's the resurrection that's the Rapture and until that happens he's working on us day by day but as soon as we go then that's it the work is finished and we get to go reign with him eternally but I want to step back a bit this evening as we continue on this last service to see what it means when we receive the Holy Spirit when we have that new birth and I want you to see it from the from the standpoint of what God has done and then what God is going to do because it's representative of a work that's already done and then it's representative of a work that's ahead of you and it's two different parts to this so if we look in Ephesians 2 and this is where brother Mark had spoken a little bit I'm going to take quite a bit more time on it this evening he says and you have he quickened that word Quicken means Made Alive who were dead and trespasses in sins so this is our original condition every one of us it's without life we're dead we're we're lost in sins and and even as good as our nature might be it's not good enough to satisfy God but it says here he quickened why who were dead in trespasses and sins this is not the quickening of the Holy Spirit here that's going to come later because he says wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world this happened way before we ever came to him and what is it it's a quickening it's a bringing to Life by the work of Calvary it's a it's a quickening by the by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we'll see what happens here he says wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world so we live the way the rest of the world did amen according to the prince of the power of the air so who's the influencer of this world it's not God it's always satanic amen we've got to realize that because if we can realize that then we realize we've got to need to come out of it we got to realize why we can't think the way they do we can't talk the way we do we can't act the way they do we can't get involved in the things they do because they're under the the influence of the prince of the power of the earth it says the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom we also had our conversation our life our living in times past in what the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others notice he says our nature is Children of Wrath we were under a judgment sentence from God bound to pay from from on what we did and who we were that's where we were sitting before we were quickened amen everything that comes naturally to us in this life displeases God even the good things that we do are not satisfactory to God that's not what he's looking for amen that's a hard thing to say but when you compare what a holy God is to everything we bring to the table it's never holy it's never pure it's never righteous it's never perfect it's always imperfect and therefore God can't accept it and so often even our good things are wrapped in selfishness or greed or a desire for rec recognition or influence or these different things and so it doesn't impress God and it certainly doesn't change him it doesn't incline his heart towards us those things won't do it but he says now but God who is rich in Mercy the start of our work is Mercy Church it's not good works it's not a heart turn toward him it says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us where am I in this verse Church where are you recipient only he loved me when I didn't love him he loved me when I didn't know him he loved me before I came into natural existence well see amen I don't have anything to offer I'm a worm I'm a sinner there's nothing here that that brings me into this it's his love for me he says even when we were dead in sins have quickened us past tense with Christ he says by grace are you saved now notice we've talked about quickening power we're going to talk about that a whole lot more in a future service we talk about we're quickened we're Made Alive by the Holy Spirit but I want you to see something here because this is a quickening by the for knowledge of God Alone it says while we were dead in sins we were quickened we were made alive that's something that's already happened we sang that song this evening I'm going to make it this is saying you've already ready made it you were already made alive way back when there was a changing of your Soul's condition from dead to alive and that's right there right now amen when God raised Christ from the dead he raised you with him he raised me with him he positionally placed us as joint HS with Christ even while we were yet in our sins physically that's where we're sitting tonight amen you when Paul's writing this to the Ephesians you have to realize that some of them would have literally been alive when Jesus was alive and then when he died at the cross and rose again and he's saying you are literally living in sin and at that moment that he died and when he rose again you Rose with him and you were quickened and you were placed into a place right next to him and you were living there you were fornicating you were worshiping Idols you were doing this you were doing that you were completely separated from him and yet you are positionally placed right next to Christ right then what a wonderful thing to understand church is that we've already been placed where we're going to be we're already sitting there amen we weren't even alive yet but we were placed the same way by the forign knowledge of God he says and ha past tense raised us up together and made us sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that means we were down here but now we come here amen we weren't in an elevated position but by the resurrection of Christ by his overcoming power we were raised with him and were placed with him and we're sitting now in Heavenly places right there with us amen church that's his work from start to finish I wasn't even there to do anything and yet there he says I was sitting there there I am sitting today right now that's where I'm sitting is in Christ amen it's not waiting on how good I'm going to perform it's not waiting to see how good a Christian I'm going to be I'm already sitting there in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus tonight amen church this is the not a physical work this is a soul work amen my soul is sitting there I was so blessed when brother Mark was talking about it brother Mark I don't know if you heard I listened to the last portion today and I got to where you're going I'm like he's already where I'm going but I'm going to go a little bit deeper this is a soul work your soul was what it was bound by sin it was bound by the Fallen nature but God when he Roose when Christ when he rose from the dead he took your soul and he took it out of the depths of where you were Bound by judgment and he placed it right up there with him and so I have representation you have representation by our soul sitting in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ today that's where you're sitting tonight church amen you're sitting here and you're saying how can that be but your soul is already elevated your soul is already resurrected your soul is already living in a place of faith in the presence of God and all that's happening by the new birth is this is being quickened to a work that's already done it's already finished that's the glory of this I can't lose I can't Can't Fail cuz I'm already sitting in a place where I've won I've already received my inheritance it's done that's the rest I have this evening is it's already done hallelujah whether I fall tomorrow whether I stand tomorrow whether I get the victory whether I fail and one more time I'm already there and I don't have to worry about it that's where you're sitting tonight and you've been sitting there for as long as you never knew when you were born you were sitting there when you fell you were sitting there when you received Christ you were sitting there and today you're sitting there and your position cannot change you're a part of him you Rose with him amen amen our soul has been redeemed already and it's this body that needs a change and it's this mind that is the conduit through which it's going to be changed because the spirit now starts to work in these different things amen Christ swapped places with you and I taking our sin he nailed it to the cross and he gave us his righteousness and our soul was now free to sit next to him in a place amen what a glorious place we're sitting in tonight Church Hallelujah but it's a soul work our body's here and our soul is there in terms of its representation in TS in terms of its Perfection that Soul as I said it's in the sphere of Faith it's in the sphere of love it's in the the very presence of God tonight but the body is stuck here in time remember what the scripture says it says the soul that sinth it shall die but then it says blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin that means there's a man there's a woman there's a child of God that he won't impute sin to and it's those whose souls are sitting right there next to him in his throne amen you see we we we're in this battle and we're in the Battle of Romans 7 and Romans 8 cuz Paul's sitting there seeing we're in these bodies don't you hate these bodies church I hate these bodies I don't like anything about these bodies they get in the way and Paul sitting there in Romans said and he's saying there there's this law that I found that when I would do good evil is with me and when I want to do good I do that which I don't want to do and when I do trying to do something good then I end up doing something bad and he says who will deliver me from this body of death what's he saying he's saying this body is unredeemed this body is sinful but then he steps right into the supernatural he steps right into the Heavenly spheres in Romans 81 and he says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ why because he's saying it's already a finished work my soul has been judged I've received my Liberty in Christ it's a finished work and so I don't have to worry about what's happening here it doesn't mean this body gets to do whatever it wants by no means we've got to bring it into subjection we've got to keep it down but the soul Works done and that's what the baptism of the holy spirit is is it's a sealing of the Soul first and foremost and it's bringing you into a recognition that your soul is already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and so so now what happens the Holy Spirit comes in and it starts to bring this body into subjection it starts to change your mind it starts to change the way you think the way you approach things and all it's doing is is bringing this into subjection into what's already there that's it that's what's happening I say that's it as if it's something simple it is simple but it's amazing it's supernatural where we're resting tonight he says what is this all for verse 7 that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus Remember Ephesians types the Book of Joshua so we're already sitting in Heavenly places but it's a spiritual place but we're stuck here with each other and he's saying it's going to be something it's going to take the exceeding Riches of his grace to transform this to what that is and so now he knows he's pointing he's saying there's a period of time here now where there's going to be a working of God and he's going to show his exceeding riches in you and you and you and you and every single one of us to bring us to the place where we are Body Soul and Spirit up there in his presence and seated in Heavenly places as a complete Unity amen it's seven Church ages is seen in Revelations 2 and 3 and those ages show the exceeding Riches of the grace of Jesus Christ amen why because his Works has to be done in an Earthly bride to reflect what she is spiritually in his presence he says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it it is the gift of God Church don't ever forget that this is never earned you cannot earn it and you cannot burn it you can't push it away you can't add to it you can't take from it it is what it is and it's by his grace it's God's work alone he says not of Works L any man should boast that doesn't mean stop working it just means don't rest on what you're working on amen he says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good Works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them we come to this place on this Earth where God starts to deal with us and he opens up his word to us and he starts to call us and he starts to woo us and he convicts us and he makes us unhappy with our life and the things that used to satisfy us don't satisfy us anymore and what's the purpose is to bring us out of those things he's trying to draw us out of our sinful sinful Natural State and bring us into a son and daughter of God's State that's what he's trying to do amen and he's supposed to trying to get us to to come to a place where we can live The Way We Were Meant to live to be what we were supposed to be not only that but here it says we've got a job to do where we are his workmanship in other words we what we will be what we're supposed to be is his work but he says we've been created in Christ Jesus unto good works in other words there's something that's supposed to be done each of us we are his workmanship we're individually created for what we're supposed to do on this Earth there are things that sister Leah can do that sister Blanca can't do there are things that Lydia can do that Elsa can't do there are things that my sons can do that I can't do they're individually created for a good work which is according to the will of God Amen that's what adoption is all about as we preached over this last year is bringing us to the place where he can put us to work he can get us to doing his will and doing what he wants rather than what I want that that's that's what adoption is about is you lay down what you want to do so you can start doing what he wants you to do amen and what God wants to do is called good works that's the will of God is good works and we've been ordained to it the world says they're doing good things but that is not good works because it's not God's will that's what happens when they come to him they said we did all these wonderful works and he says depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you because they didn't do what he said what did what did Samuel say to Saul he said obedience is better than sacrifice and so people are there and they're saying I'll do this and I'll do that you know what it is it's not a sacrifice when you make the choice of what you're going to sacrifice church when you come into Christ he has you lay down things that you would never lay down on your own there's no way you lay down family you lay down friendships you'll lay but when we want to do our good works we do it on our schedule with our time the way it works well for us and that's not it Jesus said except you got to what lay aside everything pick up your cross and follow me and then you're on his road and not your road anymore amen obedience is greater than sacrifice and God's trying to get people to him that instead of making a sacrifice of their own choosing they'll obey him by the leading of the spirit this is like brother Hank Snow said to me so long ago he says we're in a movie script and we just got to live it out and God's trying to get us into the movie script so we can do our part and when the play is done then we all get to go that's the way it finishes up amen but the part of this is is what is so the question is what is the holy spirit doing this what's its part what is the holy or or the New Birth doing this equation because it by Nature we're sinful we're Bound for Destruction and yet God has already placed us as joint ears with Christ so we have this gap between who we are in the flesh and who we are in the spirit Who We Are by our natural birth and then who we are in Christ and what has to happen is that has to be closed and that's the new birth it's the changing of you from the natural to the spiritual in our lives and we said last service our natural birth has nothing to do with our spiritual birth amen Christians are born into Christian homes Christians are born into rock and roll homes Christians are born into partying and drinking homes Christians are born into atheist homes Christians are born into Jane homes they're born into all sorts of homes that has nothing to do with it but whether you're born into a Christian home or whether you're born into a home that worships rock and roll both of you need the new birth equally as much as the other there is no difference we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity but something has to take us from what we started out as in time and what what it's trying to do is blend us back into eternity like brother Mark was talking about it's trying to bring us back into that condition amen and that requires us to let go of something so we can receive something you know they tell that that's they talk about raccoons and if you want to trap a raccoon you put something he wants inside of a log and you drive these spikes down in it so that his hand can go in it but as soon as he grabs something that's too big and he tries to pull it out and he won't let go and it captures him you don't have to shoot him you don't have to do anything you can literally go up and grab him by the Scruff of the neck cuz he won't let go of what he wants God's trying to say let go let go there's something I've got for you that's worth more than what you've been holding on to so long but remember we're in this Plan of Redemption and that means we were something and we had something and we're going back to that the Redemption is only for the children of God you can only redeem somebody that's related to you and so he's coming back for a group of people amen and we lost it by sin the blood of Jesus Christ paid that price and now by the grace of God we're coming back to what we were brother bam says it this way he says what's the Holy Spirit trying to do today he says to cut off all that unbelief he says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it's trying to bring the people back to the unadulterated word cuz for 2,000 years see what happened over the first 6ou or 4,000 years or really 3,400 I guess first 3,400 words years of the word of God what did they do they they preach for Doctrine the teachings of men and they brought them to the place where where they thought they were righteous by their works and then the word and flesh came in Christ and they rejected him and then now Christ comes and he gives a a new gospel he gives a New Covenant of Grace and he sends the five-fold ministry he sends a prophet Paul to preach it and then what happens is over the next 2,000 years what do the men what do the the the religious people of the world do they teach for preach for doctrines the teachings of men and what did they do they made the word impure they didn't make the word impure but what they preached was an impure word it was incomplete word and it had all these things added to it and blended into it and so many things got out of sink and so what God's trying to do is bring us back to the unadulterated word because that's where our Victory is that's where our overcoming power is is in a pure word he says where God said like it was in Eden before theology was ated bring it back to the way it was in Eden when man walked with God and if a treat didn't look right he said be thou plucked up and head over here the wind was blowing he said peace be still and it stopped whatever he was he could controlled all the animals everything on Earth it was his he was God over Earth he had controlling power in him now this is not the time where that is to be displayed we'll see elements of that we'll see portions of that and we even have testimonies of people that have had those experiences within this very church but our time is coming in the future this is a time for character not for display of big Power in this world Amen we got a new we've got a millennium coming then we've got a new heavens and a new Earth that's where the power will be displayed that's where it's meant to when we come back at the end of the Gentile or the Jewish dispensation these different things amen but now he's working on us in here it's a body work rather than an external work he says one came down sorry everything on Earth it was his he was God over the Earth he had controlling power in him that's our Eden condition that's what a Son of God a daughter of God is supposed to look like he says and then one came down from heaven in all this pollution and proved that that was God's plan for he was the son of God remember there was a first Adam and then there was the second Adam Jesus Christ for the first 30 years of his life had no advantage over Adam born sinless right in fact Christ was born into a worse place because he was born into pollution Adam was born into Perfection and still fell Christ came in and what did he do he proved that you didn't have to fall he made a choice he lived by the word and he overcame where Adam didn't and now what he's doing is he's got an eve that's got to overcome the same way but he realized there's got to be something different this time and what's it going to take it's going to take him inside of us it takes the holy spirit inside of every one of us but Christ he says was the firstborn among me many Brethren so our life is not supposed to be different than Christ that's one of the great failings I think of denominationalism is that they make us less than Christ and we are only Less in terms of the portion that we have but our life is supposed to reflect reflect exactly what Christ did it's the second manifestation of him in his bride he says and what did he do he died that we might come back and be purged through the righteousness of his blood and he represents us this morning so that's what the new birth is trying to do it's trying to bring us back to that Eed in condition but that's at the end of it all spiritually we're already there but this whole body and mind has to be brought into subjection and so that's what the new birth is doing is is it's Bridging the Gap between the natural and the spiritual man and woman in Christ amen and that's what so when we come to this and we talk about spoken word and we talk about all these different things that's where the mature son and daughter of God will be and that's near the very end if not at the End Amen but until then we've got all this time where we have to develop their character and these different things but we read this scripture last service and Paul said this he says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold how much becomes new in the New Birth Church all Everything Changes you cannot keep anything it remember it has to be by fire remember what John said he says I baptize you with water but the one that's coming will do it with water and fire spirit and fire it's got to burn everything there's got to be a total Destruction there's got to be a total change amen and that's a dramatic event you know brother Barry coffee shared some photos and and I've been seeing different things my sister shared some things about all the impact of hurricane Helen and they got this this river that normally crests about 1.2 feet I think or 1 and a half ft in flood season and it went over 22 feet 15 times 17 times more than it normally goes and wiped out everything in his path imagine a fire that destroys everything church it's dramatic the Holy Ghost when it comes into your life the New Birth when you experience it it's dramatic the way you think the way you act the way you talk your job how you spend your money your hobbies your friends your entertainment your music your dress everything it's a completely new way of doing things even if you've been raised in church because what happens now is the reason behind it makes what you're doing pure you can do certain things by obedience but now you'll do it because there's something in you that cries out for it and that alone is a huge difference that's the difference we want to do is where we do it by a heart's cry rather than by legalism amen that word creature he says if any man be in Christ he is a new creature that word creature means divine creation but remember what he said we were earlier he said we were children of Wrath we were Bound for judgment by our sinful nature and that wasn't of God's making or choosing but now of God's choosing is that we become a divine creature a Divine Creation in Christ amen and that's the way God intended us to be and it's a soul work that then starts to work its way out through our spirit and into our body amen and so we're trying to get back to that original image that he had for us and it comes by the new birth and we go from being a creation by the will of man to a Divine creation by the will of God born of the spirit of God born by the word of God and ordained to those good works that he talked about now in John 1 it says this but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name and I've preached on this many times and it's an often misunderstood scripture because they say if you receive Christ then he'll give you power to become a child of God and that can't be further from the truth you cannot receive Christ unless you are a child of God because there's brother V and I were talking about this it's like we've got a tuner built into US built to hear our father's voice says my sheep hear my voice and another will they will not follow there's only one voice that synchronizes with our internal mechanism here and it's the voice of the word amen that's the thing we respond to amen you can't receive Christ unless you're a child of God and that's the power to become a child of God is to receive the word and only children of God can do that when you receive the word remember what Jesus said my words are there spirit and life you receive the word and what happens is the spirit comes behind it and it quickens it because there was a word seed already there in your life that's all that's happening is that there was something inside of you and it comes to life under the preaching of the word and under the presence of the Holy Spirit and that comes to life and when something Eternal comes to life when the word comes to life it never dies once it starts there's no putting it down that's why Paul says you can't fall away you can't fall away if you fall away it's because you never had it in the first place so when people come back they need to realize they never had it in the first place and they need to go through the full works of Grace to get there something didn't anchor them but once that work is started in your soul then it's a finished work it cannot die eternal life has sprung forth out of it and it can't die amen it's a part of the word he says which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God born of what born of whose will Mom and Dad see so often we look at that we say well that was just Mom and Dad we just happened to have these parents and they came together and they happened to have a child no we were born by the will of God and our mom and our dad might have thought they had a say in it but God was using them to produce this physical body but there comes a day where God says no no you need the new birth so you can realize who's your real daddy and that's what the new birth is is it's getting you to recognize that you are a child of God you always were a child of God you always will be a child of God and you're born again and it's by the will of God and that's the birth that counts more than any other birth Amen brother Brown would say this he says and if it's the word of the Lord then it's his premeditated thoughts amen that's how we have eternal life because we were spoken into existence by God not joined into a church but born by the word the original seed that God said let there be and there was that's what why you're sitting here this evening church he said let there be and you came out and you received him you heard him you received him and here you stand tonight he says amen that's the way God births his children today in the womb of their heart with his word and his word takes root and grows how can a spirit in a human heart say it's of God and deny this word when the very God word itself is what's in the human heart amen he says if it isn't it's something else and it isn't the holy spirit in there amen if you are born to a great family today thank God if you're born to a horrible family thank God because it doesn't matter you are where you are today by a birthing of the spirit according to the word of God Amen every one of us has to be born again to be anything worth talking about it's that new birth that counts above all else brother Brown would say Christians oh you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a Son of God you must become relation to God he must be your father in order for you to be his son and only his sons and daughters are saved not the members of a church but Sons and Daughters there's only one thing that will produce that that's the new birth he says the new birth is the only thing that will produce relationship to God if you have something else then what will it produce relationship to the pastor the ministry the church the Christian Community all those things all good things but it's not Christ amen there has to be that one-on-one connection because there's going to be a day where the pastor isn't available the church isn't available the people in the church aren't available the five full ministry is not available and you're going to have to have a connection here that holds you we don't know how far it's going to go we don't know how far it'll go before they shut things down and I might not be able to come see you and we may not be able to have regular Services the way we do or we might only be able to have a few here and there we just don't know how tight The Squeeze is going to be we don't know if it's going to be political if it's going to be spiritual we don't know that squeeze is coming because there's a desperation that's needed to get us out of here I believe that church I don't believe we're desperate enough and I'm not saying that to put us down I'm saying it takes a time of desperation to draw people closer to God Amen but it'll be a relationship with Christ that holds us every time now we read this quote at the end of the service last time and I want to just start here for the last half of the service this evening just so we can see what it looks like when you receive the holy spirit in your soul and this is what happens when you can go out of church and the Holy Spirit stays with you when you can go beyond a feeling when you can go beyond an emotion where you can go beyond a church experience and you can walk out those those doors and live every day the same as if you were in here that's what a new birth will do because you pass from Death unto life now brother BR says we all know that any kind of a birth is a mess when a baby's born if it's on the floor if it's in a Shu pile or in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess he says but it brings life and that's what the new birth is it's a mess but it brings life it isn't a style or a put on or a declaration of Creeds it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the secret of the real believing Church Born Again amen he says it's a mess we read acts 238 last time and it says you had to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and then you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and he says this whole thing is a mess and you cannot repent truly and not cause a mess because we've got all these attachment to this world we've got all these relationship we've got all these Hobbies we've got all these ways that we spend our money and our interests and all these different things and you can't be a partyer and a smoker and a fornicator and a rock and roll listener and all these different things and then walk away from it and not cause some consternation and some issues anden if you got friends out there and you walk away you're going to offend them they're going to say oh you're too good to hang out with us now and they'll get personally offended because you've been called away from it it causes a mess you may lose family isn't that right you may lose family you may lose friends you may cause issues with your job and these different things your dress is going to change what you listen to how you how you talk your very nature is going to change and people aren't going to understand why and it's a mess and the thing is you don't often know like Abraham what you're walking into all you know is you got to leave where you are and that in itself can cause stumbles along the way and you don't know how far to go and in our Zeal sometimes we say things we ought not to you know and we when we repent we've got to go make things right and that's not always easy it just causes so many issues but the thing is this in the end your words aren't going to do you a whole lot of good it's your life that's going to make the difference in these things amen your life will do all the Talking for you when you're born again that's the simple truth you're Divine creation by the word of God Made Alive by the spirit and your life is going to show people What's happen more than any words you could ever say cuz you'll never be able to explain it you can understand where they're at and yet you can't explain how you got out of it all you know is something's changed Bram says this he says don't try to have any sensation or anything to take the place of the Holy Spirit you know our human nature is to want to feel it isn't it it's to want to feel it say I feel different but you don't have to feel it to get the Holy Ghost but let me tell you you're going to have some feelings at some point when it comes to the New Birth cuz you're going to have joy on unspeakable and full of Glory you're going to have love you're going to have peace you're going to have rest you're going to have faith you're going to have all sorts of things you didn't have before and guess what it's going to have an effect on these emotions and on this body but that doesn't mean it starts with those things he says when the new birth is come you are changed you don't have to do anything to prove it your life proves it as you you go to church as you testify as you shout and dance and speak in tongues as you walk as you live as you go day by day he says he doesn't say you have love he says you are love peace longsuffering gentleness meekness patience that's what you are and the whole world sees the reflection of Jes Jesus Christ in you you don't have to prove anything you know I I'm sure you've all had these experiences I've had many it seems like in the past while where people go through things in life and they'll go through a difficult life experience maybe they make mistakes maybe they backslide or fall away and what do they do they come back and they talk and they talk and they talk about how they're changed and how they're different now and you know what talk is cheap talk is easy and I don't care what you say what I'm looking for is the fruits meet for repentance I'm looking for the fruits of the holy spirit in your life if you're changed your life will say it I won't have to say a word you won't have to say a word we'll all see it and we'll all wonder what happened to her what happened to him and we'll know that there's been a change in their life amen the fact of the matter is if you didn't have it before and you have it now other people are going to do the talking for you they'll say boy have you seen how different she is oh she used to have that snarky attitude and she was always ripping people down and look at her she can't get enough Fellowship anymore and she just loves everybody she won't have to talk about it amen why because it's a dramatic thing the new birth is dramatic people might not agree with how you got it but they'll know you got it amen your life will be it amen so often that's what people get hung up on church is how we get it how we believe they don't understand they can't believe what we believe but they like the result results we ought to have a testimony that the results are there you know and this is just speaking for myself it's just an observation I find that the more that people change the less they talk about themselves that's just me that's just what I've noticed the people that have most of God they don't talk about it a whole lot because there's a humility that comes with the changing power of God because you realize what you were and you realize this is his work not my work amen and it humbles us and it makes us thankful and it makes us appreciative of what he's doing inside of our Lives John would say this for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith I love that word overcometh because it doesn't say whoever is born of God will overcome or has overcome it says overcometh that means continuously overcomes I'm over coming now I'm overcoming now I'm overcoming now I'm overcoming now and the overcoming never stops this is when you're born again the overcoming never stops it doesn't dry up it doesn't run out it doesn't hit a peak it doesn't maximize itself it just keeps going it's like the Energizer Bunning there is no end to the overcoming for the child of God that's born again amen listen I may not have overcome completely today but I overcome more today than I did yesterday and tomorrow I'm going a little higher up and tomorrow I'm going up a little higher the day after that and the day after that and it's just one step a little higher day by day and what is it it's overcoming it's footsteps is possession there's one more devil under my feet there's one more habit that I've kicked there's one more uh way that I've controlled my tongue there's one more person that was unlovable that I finally got around to loving it's just a bit day by day it's not all big victories but it's continuous day by day we're overcoming amen how he says by Faith by believing the word of God that's our overcoming we take God at his word he says who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God now be careful here because people will say that they'll say salvation is where you believe on Jesus but watch what John says here because you have to keep reading he says this is he so this is the one that believes that Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ so that's the first one he says not by water only but by water and blood and it's the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit of Truth he's all speaking of Christ here he says for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one the godhead is three offices it's all one and the same God you can't have one without the other amen they are the same being it's one God not three Gods under one framework or agreement that's what the Trinity doctr preaches is that you have three gods in agreement but we'll see here that the agreement is in verse eight on in the Earth the agreement's not in heaven they are one down here is where the agreement is but up there they are one it's amazing to me how they can take that and turn it into three persons and then somehow make them one again you can't make three one that wayen the scripture says they are one the agreement is down in our part he says and there are three that bear witness in earth the earth the spirit the water and the blood it says and these three agree in one so he that overcometh the world and believes in Jesus Christ has this verse eight it says there's an agreement there's a witness in the earth and it's the spirit it's the water and the blood it says they agree in one in other words they are not one and the same thing but they are complimentary they Point towards the same thing they're part of the same Works they're in agreement they're consistent they're in unity but they're not the same thing now brother BR would come and he would explain to us what this means he says in 1 John 5:7 he reads the scripture he says they're not one but they agree as one now you can't have the father without without having the son you can't have the Holy Ghost without having Father Son and Holy Ghost they are one they're Inseparable he says but you can be justified without being Sanctified and you can be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost you can be clean live a Pure Life have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof the scripture says he says it's the power of healing speaking in tongues and the great gifts of God and every one of them in there so you can have a Justified experience and not be born again you can have a Sanctified experience not be born again but when the spirit comes that's when the full New Birth is completely finished now we're talking about the new birth and we read that quote where brother Braham says it's a mess just like a natural birth and for those that have been there for a natural birth you notice that a new birth is not traditionally everything in one moment there are elements of that that is possible it's physically possible that you could have water blood and spirit it not instantaneously but very close but the water doesn't tend to break and then the blood come right behind it the water can break and it could be 12 hours before you really start to get into labor sometimes they have to induce it because the baby is in some distress so the water can break and then after a while you might have that blood come and then after that comes the baby and you may have 12 13 you may have 24 hours between the water breaking and that baby coming out the water breaking is a part of birth but it's not the birth the blood coming is the B part of the birth but it's not the birth but when that baby finally arrives that's when you have a birth but all of those elements agree that a birth is happening but the birth hasn't happened yet until the baby's out and a spirit enters into it amen so you can be birthing without a baby being born but when the baby's born that's when you finally have a new birth amen and I'm not going to go into all the Gory details but there's a reason why they have a janitor close by and a bucket and a mop and all these things readily available because it's hot it's sweaty it's loud it's stinky and it's really messy a new birth is a mess there's a lot of emotion a lot of emotion I'm glad sister Melody is not here tonight there's a lot of pain amen there's a lot of New Sensations but not a one of those is the birth it's just a part of the birth y'all remember this kind of a funny story when Samuel was about to be born and we went to the hospital and of course we're pros at this now you know our fourth child Blanca knows exactly how our body's going she knows when to go in you know that we don't spend more time than we have to in the hospital and all these different things and we go in and they we can't get the good room because there's a new mom in there and so we're in the smaller room with a smaller tub and these things and it was kind of a bit of a downer for us but we're in there and Blanca's just kind of doing her thing and no big deal you know and there are screams and yells going on and on from in this room and you can hear them all throughout the word I mean this and what it is it was a it was a firsttime young mother in there and she was letting us know this was not fun and then the nurse came in with kind of a smirk on her face and said she's at 2 cm dilated you know as most of you mothers would say it's like like it ain't even started honey like you're not even close to having a kid yet and you're screaming like that it's going to get a whole lot worse but she was convinced it's coming it's coming I'm going to have this baby soon we got to get it no she had had all the sensation she thought of birth but there was so much more coming and let me tell you I guarantee you she yelled a lot harder than she did when we were there what she thought the baby's coming cuz she had all the sensations but the baby wasn't being born yet I think in the end they sent her home that's how far away she was from having a baby they sent her home she wasn't ready we can be the same way with the new birth we can have all the emotions we can have all the sensations we can have all the jumping up down we can have pain we can have Elation we can have expectation we can have all these things but that is not necessarily the new birth it's just a part of it amen it makes us think it and the thing is we may be in a process of a new birth but that doesn't mean we're born again the scripture says the New Birth by water blood and spirit and they agree in one you don't have them all at the same time necessarily they don't come at the same time you can be justified you can be living above your conscience you can have your conscience that's been purified by the blood of Jesus Christ you can have a Sanctified life where you're staying away from the world and the things of the world and never have the Holy Spirit absolutely true absolutely true amen but when the Holy Spirit comes that's when life comes and that's what's going to make the difference amen it takes the spirit to bring life justification is just the F work first work of Grace of the Holy Spirit but it's not the receiving of the holy spirit it's a work of it but it's not it sanctification is a second work of Grace by the holy spirit it's the working of the holy spirit it's God working with you it's the god working with your conscience it's God bringing you under conviction it's God cleaning out your life it's a working of the spirit but it's not the spirit in you yet it's preparation for the entrance it's preparation for him to fill you you can have gifts and not have the Holy Spirit you can have gifts and not be justified or Sanctified because they're without repentance they're there whether you are in a right condition or not potentially now usually you don't realize what's really there until you come into a church situation you start to realize oh this is what's been going on my life and you start to sharpen and focus on these things amen all of these things agree that there's a birth coming but they're not the birth themselves they're part of the new birth but the birth part is the messy part the actual birth is the messy part and what is the messy part brother B says this he says the new birth brings a mess but it brings new life with it he says and that's right a plant anything a seed has to rot to bring out the new life of it a sinner has to die and rot to his own ideas this is the messy part his own life has to rot that the new life can grow out of it he says it's a mess but it's a glorious mess see here's the thing we are sitting there and we're holding so tightly to what we have and God's trying we're thinking I've got to let go and we think we're letting go we're not letting go what happens is going God is loosing us these are binding us we think we're holding it but in reality it's like this thing was wrapped all around me and it's binding me my thoughts my ideas my way of looking at things my personality whatever it is we think I've got to lay it down no what God's really doing by the spirit is he's loosing you from those things he's cutting them away we're thinking this is something good I need to hold on to it he's saying no no no once you let go of it you'll realize there's so much more than you ever had the new birth is loosing you and you think you're giving up something I think I'm giving up something I'm not giving up anything I'm being free from the thing that's held me back all this time that's what the new birth is that's why it's a glorious mess can you imagine if you were bound up in Chains and they were all R Rusty and you were holding on to those chains and you had to walk through life with these chains you you you've seen Jacob Marley you know in A Christmas Carol and he's walking he's walking and those chains are clanking and it slows him down and he can't move that's what we're like before the New Birth but we are somehow our mind has been warped by sin to think that those chains are helping us rather than hindering us and so when the spirit of Christ comes in our life and the word starts to work we start to realize that these are not things to hold on to they are things to get rid of because they're holding me back he says it brings new life that's what the church needs today but they're bypassing it with dogmas and so forth to try to escape the thoughts of dying to themselves they want to live to themselves he that lives to himself lives for himself and the devil that's it there's only two sides it's not Christ the devil and you you're either with Christ or you're against him and he says if you're living for yourself then you're living for the devil he says he that denies himself shall find his life in Christ and he'll be a new creature he'll be a new Divine creation he says that's the way you're a Christian that's how you become a Christian he says you are born a CHR Christian you're not joined into it you're born into it he says everybody is afraid of the birth again I'm glad sister Melody's not here because coming up to that I remember the first time and everyone's wondering is it going to hurt how bad is it going to hurt am I going to be able to take it how long is it going to be I've heard so many horror stories go talk to somebody that's had a new birth and they'll tell you it's a glorious thing but it ain't easy but after the pain over that's what the scripture says remember there's all this pain building up to the birth but once that child is born the mother forgets the pain cuz she's got life that's the way it is for us is we have something that's so much greater than everything we were so worried of Letting Go and we're happy even when it's hard we're happy because there's a satisfaction in our soul now he says they have some nice clean way of taking a little hand or signing a little card or a salt shake with some water in it that's not the birth a birth is a horrid thing a birth is an awful thing I don't care if it's in a pig pen a barn stall or in a pink decorated hospital room a birth is a mess and it makes a mess out of you have you been made a mess yet young people you ought to have been made a mess if you've received the Holy Spirit he says you don't want to give up you don't want this that or the other he says but the tears will wash the paint off your face and make you a different person if you're born again it'll make a mess out of you but you'll come forth a new creature see they don't want that they want some easy way you know and there are no easy ways as a song he said I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few he doesn't want to be a hothead plant you know we had a caterpillar that kind of uh nestled up in our front door and and he went in there as a caterpillar and it kind of you know he wraps himself in there and then there's some things happen in there and and then eventually we came and it was all gone but there was this pink goo there it was a mess but all that was left was the mess the mess is what you get to leave behind you come forth as a new creation you don't have to carry the mess with you you might have memory of it and Satan might try and put it on you but you get to say that mess is in the past it's a messy process but when you come out you're an entirely New Creation amen you know my wife and I were talking about a situation recently where where there were there there's a we we had there was a situation that needed help and support a and just some different things and in our heart we wanted to help but the thing is sometimes we've got to let people go through the hard work because otherwise we end up with what he calls here a hot bed plant if you make it easy it'll go easy as an easy come easy go that's what I mean there you make it easy for somebody then guess what they'll rely on you the next time and they'll rely on you the next time and they'll rely on you the next time but there comes a point where you've got to let somebody do the hard work so that they realize this is what it cost to get what we have here amen there's got to be an element of personal sacrifice at some point otherwise we don't grow in our character and we aren't strengthened and we aren't mature and we can't handle things and people get used to being given everything and they don't realize the effort that goes behind that gift every single time amen there's no free lunch and no matter what somebody gets somebody else has to pay for it I can't give you money that I don't work for I had to work for it if you want my money and I give it to you I have to work for it somebody has to work for it I don't just get to walk through the streets and gather money that's not the way it works I have to work for it everyone does I can't give you my vehicle to borrow without me paying for a vehicle amen I can't give you anything without paying a price of some sort and it's no different when we look at the new birth Christ paid the big price he paid the sin debt off he took care of that but there's a price to be paid amen and it shows that we value what he did and that's when we lay down our self-will that's the big price we're really talking about here amen it's our own thinking it's our thoughts we give up our fleshly desires all of those things but God doesn't just come and say make this heavy decision no that's why we need Ezekiel 37 he gives us a new heart and a new spirit that's what makes the transition from natural man and woman to spiritual man and woman easier is because he changes our desires he changes our mind he changes our way of thinking and that eases that transition from death into life and so we're willing to give it up because there's something inside of us that's calling for it in the first place you think a caterpillar wants to become a butterfly no but there's something built into it to go in and make itself uncomfortable and wrap itself up tight and sit still for a while and when it does that then there's a process that happens it has to pay a price though it has to pay a price and that's what we have to do we have to pay a price and it's laying down and dying completely and that means our self-will is the thing that we have to let go amen I'll tell you church when we put that down what are we doing we're putting our life in God's hands then you lay self-will down now somebody else has to lead now somebody else has to guide now somebody else has to provide and that's where Faith starts to rise up is because that's all we have left is when our self-will is gone we've just got faith in God's word and that's where we're proven and that's where we see our patience and we're trusting God to back up his word in our lives and fulfill it in our lives amen 1 John 5 says and this is the record that God ha given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that had the son had life and he that had not the Son of God had not life has him not just accepts the worth of Calvary has him this is a personal possession this is a personal indwelling this is a total change of headship and life is when we change our headship from me to him amen it's Christ coming into the believer personally it's not the third person of the Trinity it's Christ himself coming in amen and we'll see we're going to talk about this more in a future service that when Jesus goes away then what does he say he says I'm going to send you a comforter I'm going to send you the Holy Spirit and then he says I he doesn't say he he says he but then he says I he and I are the same thing it's not a third person of the Trinity it's Christ coming back into the believer it's a personal one because we've got to have the son that's where life is from amen he says I'll be with you I'll be in you it's a personal thing not a third person of the Trinity thing but the the Christian world has come up with this idea that we can believe Jesus we can accept Jesus and yet we can reject his word that that that's the nominal idea of Christianity Today is that you come and you accept the finished work of Calvary he forgives you for your sins and yet you don't have to actually obey the whole word of God they'll let you get away with anything they have pastors that are divorced and remarried they've got people that are living common law going to church serving in the church you can live any way you want and go to a Christian church today you can live an alternate lifestyle you can cuss you can listen to rock and roll you can go out to you if you've got a good enough reason you can go into a Catholic Church wearing your bathing suit that's where Christianity has come because what they're saying is take Christ and they've separated Christ from the word amen but you can't get the full impact if you don't accept the full package you can't you can't get into heaven as a Halfway Christian you've got to be an all the way Christian and that's what the Holy Ghost is here to do and I've been been reading in the church age book where where where brother bram's talking about he says and he's here to take you from partial realization into full realization and that's what the new birth is doing is it's taking you from a place where you didn't have have what you needed to bringing you to a place where you've got what you need now amen it's giving you Victory where you never had enough Victory it's giving you love where you never had enough love it's giving you Faith where you just never had enough Faith to get the job done and what's it doing it's taking you from a partial reality into the full reality of the power of God in your life by the word that's what the new birth is supposed to do it's taking us from that that that miserable condition of being a halfway believer of having a church experience into a god experience into a sudden daughter of God experience amen remember what we they it says about the the people on the on the day of Pentecost there it says then they that gladly received what his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 Souls it wasn't Peter's words they were receiving it was Christ the word see that's what we have to remember here is that we're not just reading a book we're receiving Christ the word there is no separation and they were receiving the word of God by anointed preaching and it brought them to the word of God indwelling them by the Holy Spirit they received the word and they became the word that's how it works people want to separate Jesus Christ in the work of Calvary from the word of God but Jesus said I am the word I'm the word made flesh so you can't separate those two things John 1 tells us that that he was and is the word of God from the beginning and we see at the very end here as it as time starts to wind down in Revelation it says and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he do judge and make war his eyes are as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God people say Christ is not he's not a judge he's not hard he's loving he's kind Church what's he coming with he's coming to make war he's coming in judgment and what is he coming as he's coming as the word of God his name his identity is with the word time and time again it's Christ the word he's coming back as the word and people are saying I'm relying on the sacrifice of Calvary the sacrifice of Calvary was meant to take you into the word not to just wash you over and then walk away from you it was to make you come into the Plan of Redemption so that he could finish a work that he started amen you can't accept Christ and deny the word they're Inseparable Inseparable they're one and the same so when you receive the word of God well and truly that is the start of the new birth that's when life starts to come in and it turns your world upside down Church why because leadership has changed now it's not me it's Christ Living in me now it's not what I think it's what the word says and it completely changes the Dynamics because now there's a new person in the control tower and it's not Jonathan klette it's not the DNA of Lanny and Sandy klet now it's Christ the word in there and that's what's controlling me and it turns my entire world upside down it has to because It hasn't been working under my leadership that's for sure brother B talks about Paul Paul is the epitome of the religious person and he says Paul was down here in the natural realm with his PhD see he didn't know he had an intellectual Faith but he didn't have a Divine Faith there's quite a difference in me having intellectual faith and a Divine Faith he says that's where you my Baptist friends failed to go on you get the intellectual Faith by that but it must be a divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you that takes sin out of the heart intellectual Faith's not enough that's all right but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit he says the holy spirit is a personal experience not a church experience not a mommy and daddy experience it's a the personal experience of the new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ the new birth is turning us into what we were before time began amen it's bringing us into the subjection of the word it's producing the word in our lives he said the working of the Holy Spirit the kingdom of God in you God sets on the throne of your heart in his control room controlling your emotions controlling in your powers controlling your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love he says and God fills you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature he says then in this you become a new creation in Christ hallelujah what a work he's done Church you say brother John I haven't recognized that yet in my life I'm saying it's available you may have it and not realize it you may have quenched it you may not listen there are sometimes things that we don't have because nobody's come and unlock them yet the word may not have unlocked it to you yet you may not have a revelation of it yet but as the Revelation comes as the word comes that's the day that's the day you get to say it's mine if you never knew it before but you know it now say today Lord I'm claiming it I've got the Holy Ghost I've received the new birth I'm claiming it for myself tonight as we start to close Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away when you become a part of the word you realize I can't fail when you realize you always were a part of the word you realize you never could fail in the first place Jesus said everything's going to pass away everything you see here is going to pass away except my words there's only one thing the word of God can do and that's be fulfilled that is the only Power it has is fulfillment it cannot fail it cannot fall away it cannot die out it can't time out it can only produce what it is amen that's what's holding me today church he says my words will never pass away I'm a part of it you're a part of it that's the security I have tonight is that when I beca when I was a part of his word that ensured nothing could happen to me except he allowed it and I've got a sure and faithful end that's coming he says now what is the word of God the word of God is God himself he says so God gave the believer himself it's God himself he gave the believer himself to attack the Enemy by in other words he's the father and the word is God then the word is our father we're born by the word and he's standing in the Forefront for his children amen he says there you are he's standing out there for his children what are we scared about if his words can't fail what are we scared about scripture says he's not given us a spirit to fear he says what are we scared about the Rapture is sure the coming is sure every blessing that's been promised is ours all belongs to us hallelujah what are we scared about church when doubt comes in that's when we get scared when we listen too long to the wrong thoughts when we feed too long on the wrong things what happens is fear starts to creep in and how do you push it back the word of God the word of God the word of God because he dwells in his word amen that's where your power lies is in the word quickened by the spirit last quote as we close he says the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence he says but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age he says watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstrations he says but in action what it does according to the word amen God bless you let's stand together I love how he puts it there there because so often what we're crying out for is the demonstrations isn't it wouldn't we love it I think as a minister speaking for myself I would love it if great signs and wonders followed every single service we had here if it was just one sign and wonder after another if there was tongues if there was interpretation if there was healings if there was visions and all of these things wouldn't that be an amazing thing I'd love it and it is available to us it's been put into the church but brother Bram says it's not in demonst ations that's not what we're anchored in he says but what it does according to the word that's what we're looking for is for the word to be fulfilled see the flesh loves the demonstrations it loves the signs and the Wonders what the flesh doesn't like is living by the word it loves for all the action to be out there and making life easier and taking burdens away and all these things but he says it's the the Holy Ghost what it does according to the word quickening the word in your life that's what it's supposed to do what's the New Birth Church it's Christ the word quickening the word for your day in your life it's the person of Jesus Christ inside you by the Holy Spirit making you live the word that's it you say brother John how do I know I've got the Holy Ghost you're living by the word that simple it is that simple and when you are living by the word then you will produce the fruit of the spirit you will live a life that reflects the one that's living inside of you and that's it you may never raise a person from the dead you may never lay hands on the sick you may never speak in tongues but if you live by the word it shows that there's a word living inside of you amen Changes Everything About You changes your life changes your desires change your mind changes your focus changes your priorities changes your likes and your dislikes all by what bringing you subject to this one book amen makes it live in you that's what the new birth is amen it doesn't stop it doesn't stop you say well I've been born again yes but the effect of the new birth is going on day by day by day I trust by God's grace I'm not what I was yesterday and I trust by God's grace tomorrow I won't be exactly what I was today it's a new birth it's bringing us into that full realization of the full manifestation of the word in our life everything we read everything we hear that's a anointed by the spirit it's there to produce that in our lives cuz he was the firstborn of many Brethren we're the next one that can't fall we're seated with him joint AES in Christ and all we've got is we've got this little bubble of time we've got to go through like brother Mark was talking about to prove I'm going to stay there I'm going to stand with it and the only way we can do it is by a new birth that takes us from an old creature to a new creature amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are that you've made a way Lord you paid a price at Calvary but you didn't stop there Lord but at Calvary Lord you gave us everything
