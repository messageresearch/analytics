daughters a man and he redeemed his children thank God and we're almost all by the grace of God and again so thankful that we have a few extra in the assembly here tonight this is amazing absolutely amazing again I don't know if we ever dreamed that we would experience this whether it's here or maybe even in the States and no doubt is even to our brother bid Nora it would be a something of a surprise that that the believers can't come to church but for the grace of God one day that we're going to we're going together a man so we I'm praying the Lord and bring us all back together again because I'll be honest true there's something else has been a burden on my heart and that I feel that we should be doing and it's been quite a while since we've done it and that's to have communion and as the Lord I said I pray grace that you're going to provide the way I said too for us to have communion again they may so be in prayer for that as well and I trust that by the grace of God if you got the Holy Ghost that you also have have felt the same thing and maybe looking for the same thing once again to get together with the brothers and sisters amen and to partake of the of the bread and wine amen and the foot washing by the grace of God but again we know what's going on in the world it is a sign that we're getting closer and closer to the end of all things amen well the hour is coming when it won't be justice this disease or whatever is going around the world whether the hour is coming when maybe even the even the government's will will try to stop us from getting together amen oh yes they will that hours coming amen so brother it happened in history it's going to happen again at the end and talk about a trial of our faith our feelings going to be tested amen are you going to take your stand are we going to take our stand as they took their stand down through the ages and the dark ages and as I mentioned I believe in the last service let's consider that sixty-eight million laid down their lives brothers sister and not just to lay down their lives or to to the natural things of life and and they they they forsook that for so fat no no they they they just willingly allowed themselves to be killed murdered for the Gospels sake they did it for Jesus sake amen well they were more than willing as ice wall smoking mode that that sister that was challenged back there many many many years ago and they and they threatened and they said listen lady if you don't forsake this and and what you're believing and all of these things they said we're going to kill your child might even a daughter or her son and she said I can't forsake it I can't give it up and they said well we're going to kill your child she said killed him and she said I'll meet them in glory a man just think she had to make that choice what would be our decision if we had to make a choice like that a man what would be our decision if we got to make choices about but even our jobs and then our homes and our vehicles and all that oh I pray the grace of God we're going to stay with the word amen so we'll lay down our lives and I and all that we're looking for in this world all that the world wants in this world that will be more than willing to sacrifice it for Jesus sake when we consider what he did and we consider what others have done brother god help us a man that will lay down our lives for the Gospels sake for the kingdom of God's sake will lay down our lives for one another amen so the Lord blessed us and we want to welcome our brother Ben nor odd to Newfoundland and a trustee said joy maybe the weather in Tennessee and we want we want to ask him to after weather or dewford land a man so we prayed god bless our brother Bednar odd he's been a blessing to us in the past in his visits with us and we believe that God is going to make him a blessing to us tonight and again through this weekend so being prayer for our brother bein as he comes to bring the word to us tonight amen hallelujah and then let's let's understand and let's believe that it's not the word of brother bein it's the word of the Lord a man and that it's not a man it is it is God a man God is going to use our brother God go to speak to our brother God's going to minister to our through our brother he's going to reveal himself to us through our brother Ben tonight a man so let's believe that with all of our hearts so we say again god bless brother Ben Neriah and God bless the going forth of the word hey man and pray the grace of God to our brother a man I'm not sure if he's in a church somewhere or behind the pulpit or in his home I assume that he's in a zone yeah I saw okay praise the name of the Lord so and again we pray God to bless us here with the going forth of the word but also to bless those that are online and there at home amen so brother ben is going to minister to them as well to Purdue God be the glory so again we want to assure our brother band that we welcome him and we thank God for his ministry and we pray the grace of God a man that he will minister to us through our brother man amen and God bless our brother and sister I don't know if they were to sing any specials of the night or not but we would we would welcome that as well if our brother and sister nor rods saying Amen because it was a blessing here and I can see them right

everybody hear me all right how about now brother Matt I we had a technical difficulty can you hear me praise the Lord all right well now III did all that talking I'm gonna have to repeat myself Anna anyhow I said thank you for the opportunity and the privilege of being here and being able to join you by way of the satellite and very thankful the Lord to have this opportunity I want to say thank you to brother Gerald especially for allowing us to arrange this he wrote me sometime back and said can we get a couple nights out of it and I I was so happy to do so I said I was just thankful the Lord to get the opportunity to do it and but I was telling the Brethren when they contacted me about the matter I said well I don't mind doing this but one thing has got to be perfectly settled in my contract it must state that after this is all over with I get to make personal physical visits to Dupin land after all this over with a bet I said that's got to be that way because I I'd rather be on a plane and they're hugging the neck and and seen you face to face ash or miss that but you know I think it's we're seeing some things taking place that we don't know but what this is possibly the phasing in of something we don't know you see how quickly the whole world shut up over one little virus and brother bream talked about we come to a spot to where meetings like what we've experienced will be a fond memory one day and we're seeing that more and more and more it behooves us of course to be ready at any hour at any time that we don't know what time Jesus would come people say well it could be years from now I think this virus has proven to us that just like that things could wrap up just as quickly as like flipping a light switch and the light coming on but anyhow we thank you brother Gerald we love you and sir good to see Bob is singing there in that platform and and I heard I heard Paul and I heard I heard Joe and I heard the music and and I heard something back there squalling I just a little I didn't think that was sister back there I figured she was holding something and there it is well praise the Lord look at that a man that's beautiful oh just beautiful how did you get something that pretty being married to Paul like that I just would praise the Lord anyhow well god bless you buddy and congratulations and we love you folks we love you so much now I'm gonna have to offer you my apologies right away Samantha's not here with me right now her mother just a few moments ago I'd say just a few hours back they had a pipe burst in their home and they're

because I'm so tall I almost get out of the frame but can you see me and hear me all right everybody see me and hear me alright good praise the Lord I got brother Matt here on the hook up right with me and if anything goes wrong he's gonna send me a message and and I'm gonna listen at everything he says except for if he tries to pull my coattail while I'm preaching I'm gonna ignore that text amen that'll be the only one I don't listen to but anyhow god bless everybody god bless you visible an invisible audience it's such a joy to come and preach and to be here in the service of the Lord so thank you again kindly for the opportunity to come and and speak the word of the Lord now you got your Bible Ephesians chapter one let's look at verse nine and I want to drop down through verses 9 10 11 and 12 then 4 verses if we can and and by the help of the Lord we're going to try to speak this evening I want to try to speak upon the mystery of his will the mystery of his will Paul speaking here in just a little bit about the mystery of God's will now how many knows that the will of God could not be revealed to us until this last day to this last time we're living and the will of God was something that was hidden in the mind of God for many many years it was hidden in the mind of God but now God's will has been made known to us and especially in the last day now of what God's mind is for us in this last time now let's read ephesians 1 pick it up verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according as to his good pleasure according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times notice that times plural he might gather together all right now Paul's telling us what this mr.zhou about right here in this verse gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him all right so the mystery of God's will was to gather everything together in one in Christ Jesus in whom also we have obtained an inheritance everybody say I've got an inheritance amen praise the Lord being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will of his own will all things are working according to the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ amen now let's let's ask the Lord to help us in the reading of the word if you just bow your head me just a moment let's pray together Heavenly Father what a privilege it is Lord to be able to come father into this place Lord as I was thinking about it just momentarily you said we're two and three are gathered you never told us exactly where that place was you just said if they were gathered together Lord some met in caves and catacombs some meeting great big buildings some meet little small churches some meet out in the country some meet in the city Lord and some of them will meet through these ethernet waves out of here virtually on these little places like Skype and zoom and all these other little programs and what more that's been made available for the world to communicate while sitting in their own home but Lord if that is a gathering place Lord and you promised if we gather two and three in your name you promised to be right here now father I'm amazed that when I sat down here and heard the music playing and brother Bob started the service already I felt the presence of the Lord right here in this little spot what it tells us Lord is that the third pool that real true move of God in the last day has nothing to do with being in a church building it's being in Christ and knowing who we are all about how we longed to assemble ourselves together as well so father we're praying that whatever the mind of God is for this hour and this time we're living in that you'll help us with it now and that you'll give us the strength that we need to be able to get through these trying times now father for tonight service may the Holy Spirit use me to speak to this audience and may the hearts of the people be open to receive that which the Holy Spirit will say we love you we thank you we pray you'll bless your word bless all that are listening and gathered together online and what more and maybe those that might hear it afterwards may the Holy Spirit in this blessing be with them in Jesus Christ's name as we commit the service now both speaker and listener in Jesus name Amen and amen amen god bless you you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good somebody asked me they said have you been doing a lot of preaching I said yes and no I said you know some of the shutdown has grounded me altogether and I haven't been able to preach and travel and things in different places but I've been doing a lot of virtual preaching just like this and somebody asked me the day brother Joe they say can you do it I said my goodness I'm an old dog I preached on the radio many many a year this is just old hat to me the only difference is I'm looking you in the face rather and look at it a microphone that's the only difference so III go back I might be young in the face but I I'm one of these old timers in that way I've done the old way of doing things and and and so I'm at home I'm at home so I don't want you to be nervous I'm not going to be nervous we're going to receive from the word of the Lord and if you pull remember your faith don't need a passport I can feel it sitting right here in my little place of worship while you're receiving out there in your little place of worship and remember this is in the days of the voice not the body not the presence but in the days of the voice that something would be accomplished in the last day and so here we are gathered under the voice of God in these last days now I'm a preacher you understand I'm a preacher and and my mouth is awful close to this mic so I'm gonna try not to shout you out of the building but you know maybe maybe the Lord will help me just to get the right tone but you know you're gonna hurt my feelings if you holler glory to God and hallelujah a man either and just be ready to worship the Lord because I think that's why we've taken the opportunity to gather like this so we can hear from the presence of the Lord and and I believe it's a wonderful opportunity what an age a golden age if you will time that we're living in and yes it's difficult lots of folks suffering and hurting and lots of things going on around us but remember Jesus taught us that in the last day it would get darker before the light would ever begin to shine and we don't look for this world to have any hope our hope isn't in trudeau our hope isn't in trump it's in the last Trump but not this Trump a man and it's not in any other thing our hope is in Jesus Christ in him alone and I'm so glad to be gathered together with the Saints of God under the auspice of this word of God I was laughing the other day by the jail I told a group when they were preaching sitting in their home I said I used to worry about preaching a long time I said but now you're in your Barcalounger and sitting there probably in your pajamas and I don't have to worry about you getting tired you already read relaxed and rested so we can take our time tonight a man but I just want to tell you how happy I am to be a Christian and I can't think of a better time to live in than this right now and somebody said to me the other day brother Ben how you holding out what's going on with you you know you're living and the money you make and things comes from the ministry and all that I said my goodness this has been the best vacation the Lord could ever give a guy Amen I had a wonderful time and I our needs are met God has been blessing us greatly they had just been paying our tithes and offerings like he told us and everything's falling right in our lap just the way we needed a man the Lord has blessed us greatly so we we want to thank you for your prayers for us and our family I made it through school I want to thank you for the prayers about that and and I said now the only person allowed to call me doctors my wife it's the only reason I've done it in the first place anyhow is whenever I want to put the hammer down I make her call me dr. Amen that's the way that goes but anyhow we we thank the Lord and and we appreciate God and what he's done for us and and this is a beautiful age a time that we're living like no other and I want to try to introduce to you if God will helped me for I don't know maybe 45 minutes to an hour we'll just kindly set a pace and see how the Lord will take us but I I want to try to dig in just a little bit if I can on what the mystery of God will is now before we go to what it is today remember Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever how many believes that say Amen all right now if he is the same yesterday today and forever then if we want to know what he is today if we want to know what he's gonna be tomorrow it's a good indication if we look into the past to see what he was if we know what he was we know what he is and we know what it will be because Malachi 3 I am God and I changed not he doesn't change so his way of doing things he has an unchanging method and remember what brother Branham said in the church age book he said the very reason that we could choose he said the messengers of each age was based upon the foundation that God never changes once he does one thing one time he holds that pattern all the way out through the ages but now remember as I preach to you many times before God slowly unfolded the mystery of God slowly unfolded the mystery of God letting out just little bits and pieces of what he thought of what his will was and if we go all the way back to the beginning we see that the will of God was housed in the words and it was cased in the words the day you eat thereof is the day you died the first time we find God declaring his will to the people upon earth Adam and Eve as they stood there on planet Earth God is evoking and he's impressing his will upon humanity said the day you eat is the day you die don't touch it and then don't have nothing to do with the tree of sexual desire stay away from that the tree which is in the midst that is the first inkling that we get in the Bible is Moses roaded of the will of God for Humanity now we see that and we claim that as being the will of God but I want to submit to you tonight that there was an even greater will behind that will because remember the Prophet tells us in spoken words original seed and don't forget this quotation because this will help you throughout tonight as you begin to see the message come together a little bit brother Branham teaches us that it was genuinely God's will and predestinated Eve to fall in the very now we've been through it sometimes they're the last three or four years of the church and taking that fall and really dissected it but just suffice to say tonight just to get the picture in your mind that it was God's will for her to fall so when God placed his word out there before him the day you eat thereof is the day you die we see presented God's mind for that situation but behind the words was a will that God wanted to see manifested even though him knowing they could not keep the word that was presented and the word that was presented would not be the thing that they would keep and God knowing that all along he placed the word out there as an instrument to work out the will that hung behind those words are you following what I'm saying this far alright now remember whenever he predestinate Siebe he predestinate sure that she would fall all right once she falls in the Garden of Eden then God's will is set in motion remember the Prophet said in Jesus Christ or in Almighty God we should say Amen because Christ wasn't created yet or Jesus wasn't created yet but in Almighty God Jehovah God Elohim was the attributes to be a savior to be a father to be a redeemer to be all of these things but remember there was nobody not one person anywhere that had the ability to [Music] God being a healer there was nobody sick so he couldn't there's nobody had the ability to be healed from a sickness when there was just perfection he's a resurrector so there was nobody dead so how could he resurrect when there's nobody dared not even a leaf withered in the Garden of Eden so God's will was that man would fall in the beginning that was God's desire in God's will so that all of the attributes that laid inside of him could be expressed are you with me so far all right now if you notice the way that this comes together then the Lord God would then reveal bits and pieces of his will as he would go out through time and down through the stream of time you would find that he would reveal bits and portions of his will so see in the Garden of Eden we see the serpent standing there he is a part of the original sin his arms and his legs are taken off of it and he's taken to his belly then we find many years later there's Moses standing there they standing with the children of Israel standing there in the wilderness and he's got a serpent on a pole a brass serpent on a pole which brass represents judgment showing forth that sin had already been judged in that serpent on the pole and God just slowly unfolding part of this mystery in bits and pieces then we come along a few thousand or a few hundred years later I should say and we find Isaiah saying that a virgin shall conceive in the last day is that right and then if she is to conceive in the last day in the last time remember it would come in the hour that Peter would describe in the last days when Jesus showed up it was the last days of all that Old Testament time you know when I was a boy my grandmother she loved to do puzzles and it was one of the greatest things to her she lived her life doing one puzzle after another and if you've ever done a puzzle you know that you don't get the full picture right away I know some people would like to see it happen that way just pour in the box out and there it is but you got to work at a little bit and what you have to do is you got to take one piece put it with another one put another with another with another spin them around a little bit do some investigation for a while find the colors that match the lines the spots that match and eventually the picture begins to come together now remember God had laid his puzzle pieces out through those Old Testament time periods through those Old Testament ages he would drop a puzzle piece here drop a puzzle piece here drop another piece here drop another piece here but then when the Lord Jesus Christ shows up then the picture of all these things is beginning to come together look at these little parts that was unfolding he said that a virgin shout conceived I never come right out and told us you know word verbatim what it was in the Garden of Eden but I say as words declare to us hallelujah what it was that took place in the Garden of Eden if a virgin needed to bring forth the Messiah then it must have been an unburden like act in the garden that put us in this mess in the first place can you say man now when we look at the puzzle piece begin to come together we look at the mystery of God's will notice that when in Exodus 20 the children of Israel stood there crying out give us a law give us along now we know God's original will had nothing to do with the law had nothing to do with keeping of law washing of pots and pans none of that was in the mind of God but God's Way was grace grace provided a prophet grace provided manna grace provided water from the rock grace provided the cloud grace provided the pillar of fire grace provided the quail grace provided everything they had need of but now here is man crying give us a law hmm in that right wanting something to do oh you know man ain't changed too much he's still in the same boat doing the same old things he still wants to try to make something happen in order to consider himself to be righteous but remember the law could never bring forth the true mystery of God's will because the law was even though the law coming from God had to be perfect this is why when Jesus showed up Jesus himself said that I didn't come to destroy the law of course not how could he destroy something that was perfect how could he destroy something that was already in God's mind as being a perfect thing anything that comes out of God is perfect even though man himself couldn't live it hmm even though man himself couldn't manifest it but yet if it come from God it was perfection as it come from God so then it would take one the Lord Jesus Christ then to come and complete the puzzle of it all now watch him when he shows up the mystery of God's will is that pillar of fire hung there between them cherubims and and those those wingtips come together and the pillar of fire would rest in between those wingtips and then here the priests would walk in sacrifice in his hand step in there with the blood and what more and the smoke of God and the fire of God would come down the people would say all the Lord has accepted us and if not they'd start crying for God's mercy God have mercy God help us Lord and be with us they only knew enough about God to know that God was merciful by the sacrifice that he was a judge that there was justice to be measured out if they did wrong and remember they knew him by the washing of pots and pans tastes not touch not handle not keeping a day's Sabbath moons all of that but remember the will of God had not been fully revealed in that Old Testament because the puzzle was still coming together yeah amen there was still pieces that had to be put together are you with me so far now notice when Jesus comes in here then the Lord Jesus Christ is going to become a master portion of this puzzle a lot of the picture is going to come together in the fulfillment and in the manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ but remember Adam was called the first man Adam by the Apostle Paul and Jesus was called the last man Adam notice he wasn't called the second man Adam because there had been a second there could have been a third but Jesus was called the last man Adam showing that after the first Adam fell in Eden that Jesus would be the last Adam well just like the first Adam he had an Eve as part of his picture a woman that come from him now Jesus Christ has a woman that is drawn from him in the last day the bride of Jesus Christ so Christ would make up all of the picture all of the puzzle pieces that would make up all of that Old Testament remember brother Brennan told us a masterpiece that he was building up the body in those ages and building it up through the prophets and he talked about the four corners of that pedestal that the statue sat on he talked about Joseph being perfection and Abraham being grace and all these others and he talked about how the prophets would build that body up but then here comes the Lord Jesus Christ who is the headstone hallelujah of all that was laying in that Old Testament hey man and now he sits down on the rest of the body completing that portion of the puzzle but there's still some things missing there's still some pieces missing in this great masterpiece because remember no matter how much the Lord Jesus Christ and all of his Grace and all of his mercy manifested himself remember even jesus said the son can do nothing but what the father shows him not even the Sun knows the day nor the hour at the returning of the Son of Man there were many things that Jesus could have said but was it permitted to say it because the mystery of God's will was not yet being revealed just yet remember even him coming he said I came not to destroy but I come to fulfill I come to set at variance father and mother and families and sister and brethren what more I come to bring a sword am i they must have thought well yeah that's what we want them Israelites looking for a fight all the time gets him Romans they thought the a break him sword Jesus that's what we want not realize them that the sword he was bringing was not a division from one of the other but it was a division between those that were God's seed and then the rest of the world that was the true division look at your own household some of y'all are believers and got family members when he walk across the street to go to church you know here we sit here tonight we're enjoying the presence of the Lord set in the house of God this little shutdown probably didn't disappoint too many folks around this message because they didn't go to church when they had the doors open you know I'm talking about but yet here we said we loved it we we just enjoy being gathered in the presence of the Lord because we love this word and we love what it stands for what it means to our hearts it goes to prove that God's will God's life was made up in Jesus Christ that's true but not everything was revealed when Jesus showed up now here comes Paul telling us that the mystery of God's will I want you to think about that a minute the mystery of God's will he said is now being made known to us all right well what was that mystery of his will all right first of all we know where the BAM tells us in the last day that there are two phases to God's will he tells us that there is a permissive will of God he tells us that there is a perfect will of God and he tells us that the permissive will will always wrap around somehow another until it comes back to God's perfect will so no matter how far we might stray little things that might come along one thing we can be confident of is that God's will will be done and life in my life no matter what may be sitting out there in front of us no matter what naysayers might say this or that the will of God will be done in you and I no matter what the world says about it God desires that we would be a people that would fulfill the very mind and the will of God now if he makes known to us what is the mystery of his will look at it again in verse 9 according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself well what was it that pleased God his purpose his purpose was pleasing to him and what was his purpose I certainly don't think God wanted to stir well between them cherubims and come and Thunder the mountain and shake the mountaintops and speak through prophets and things like that surely you don't think that's the only thing God had in his mind if you do you're missing the purpose of it because the real purpose of God wasn't to come and shake the mountain and scare the people to death and show that he's some kind of powerful being his purpose was so he could reveal himself to you in an intimate way in a way that you couldn't experience with the shaking of the mountain and the Thunder and the lightning you see I think that's one reason we get in such trouble around the ranks to the message we chase all these little old things and all of this supernatural fandangled everything and we miss the real genuine purpose of God which was Christ becoming intimate persons with us that was his whole purpose from the very beginning the whole reason glory he let Eve fall in the beginning was to become intimate persons with us so that we could have a relationship and then that relationship would bring us into a unity and bring us into an intimacy that could not be expressed through the washing of pots and pans taste not touch not handle not oh it's it's a beautiful thing when you look at it now talking about the mystery of God's will there is a permissive well that's what God was telling him when he told him don't eat well he knew they were going to do it anyhow Peter that he was going to do the things she done and act the way she acted he knew it matter of fact he planned for it to be just that way he allowed things to fall into the permissive side so that it could wrap back around to his perfect will because when this is all said and done and you and I are gathered in eternal bodies just imagine that we won't even need Ethernet hallelu we travel like a thought rather they think their internet is fast they never had God thought power before that's that's the fastest speed there is a hallelujah to be able to travel like a thought oh yeah that's coming to us one day yes sir this little measly thing we got down here on the earth it's only a type of what's getting ready to come down the way but God when we gather there it'll all right back to his perfect wheel because looky here but about him when he met them beyond the curtain of time there was no sex glands in the body then women were hugging him and crying precious brethren he didn't feel one sensation showing that the permissive was wrapping right back around into the perfect will of God the way God intended in the beginning however expressing all of his desires down here in time making himself a savior and a lord and a deliverer and all the things that he was so that we could come together in the newness of life and in the new birth as intimate persons with Almighty God now listen this and the adoption this paragraph 75 76 is part four but the mem said now look he has predestinated us unto his inheritance he said if I am a right inheritance of something he said if God is knocking at my heart and saying William Branham I called you a long time before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel I have an inheritance and inheritance of eternal life he said now God sent Jesus watch now to make that inheritance real to me how do they do you that was the purpose of Jesus showing up my inheritance was given to me before the foundation of the world I didn't come to the altar and all of a sudden get saved and get an inheritance no that was given to me before the foundation of the world but it wasn't real to me why wasn't it real to me cuz I didn't know what the will of God was I didn't know what the plan of God was how can you tap into the richness of God's way if you don't know what the will of God is for your life and Prince let's be honest that's where a lot of people struggle in this last day is what is the will of God well it's very simple the will of God isn't about having great supernatural visions and great big tent meetings and the thousands getting healed and and all that's wonderful thank God for every thing has been done to help humanity but the real plan and purpose of God was so you and him could become one they been somebody save [Applause] you and him become one one persons with Jesus Christ that you could become amen a partnership this is a co partnership amen I'm a joint heir with him I'm not a slave I'm not a subordinate we're co-heirs Co II that's right he is my Lord that's true but he's made me equal to everything now Jesus sent was sent to make that inheritance real and I watch he said there was nothing I could do to inherit it oh I'd like to get that through the heads of some of these people around here running around saying well I live good and I believe the message and I do thank you you may do every bit of it brother and you might preach and you might have the biggest Church in the message but there's nothing you or me or anybody else could have done to inherit this eternal promise of God if it could have been that way then the law was all we needed we should have stopped at the law but the law could not reveal the true will of God the law was a schoolmaster remember what Paul told us in the book of Galatians he said that we were trained like children under the schoolmaster the law was a schoolmaster teaching us to be obedient teaching us to reverence teaching us fear of God but all of those that was able to fear God yet some of them are the very ones when Jesus said would you walk off - from that time they walked no more with him they just kept going that's st. on 666 by the way that ain't no tattoo or some microchip in your wrist neither rejecting that word of God that's what that true mark is and people set right in the Pew sit right in the church that same mindset well I'll do I'll do all right if you believe this prophet of God right here he said there's nothing I could do to inherit that promise of God it was solely on the grace of God Oh church are you thankful for the grace of God or what are you that goes to prove Amen and and this is what I love otherwise so now watch this this is beautiful right here because there was nothing he said it was blank it was valid he said Mithen I could do but in the fullness of time God sent his son in his own good time glory Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation the Lord his blood was shed oh oh I like this brother bomb he said now that I may go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance everybody ready say many of you are to be a sonship to be a son of God a brother we get all hung up on on what the Sun gets I'd rather be the Sun first huh we hung up on what possessions does the Sun get you hear preachers preaching that day in this state all the bride's got the bride gets the bride has yeah that's wonderful thank God for every possession God gives to me but I'd rather be a son first and it free about what I get later because I Got News for You brethren I've said it a Newfoundland before and let me say to you Newfoundlanders again if I if heaven ain't nothing but a mud Shack Alleluia and the River of Life ain't nothing but a little trickle of water down a little muddy bank to be a son to be born again to be his child that's enough if I never speak the word with the big about that nowadays speak the word speak the word if I never speak a word amen brother Gerald if I never raise the dead huh now some of you and the invisible audience in your living rooms are where you are you better holler a man - because Amen it might get a little quiet in this church as I keep going here we have to thank church a lot of times we Gentiles remember Jesus talked about a wicked adulterous generation they run after signs but our inheritance is not a sign Church our inheritance is a sonship please that son son that is the mystery of God's will they had all of these virtues in how am I going to get this revelation of my sons how am I going to get the revelation of my sons now we're coming to the meat of what I want to talk about here and I hope you're followed my thought on this but how are they going to come to the revelation of mark 16 lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover if they don't recognize they're a son and a son has the attributes of his daddy and if his daddy was a healer that puts them in a healing position where they can lay their hands and be healers of course we know it is in our flesh or something like that course not but it's the it's the healing power that's on the inside of us remember how book of Acts declared it and let's not mince words I say it like the Bible said it the Bible said the disciples went around healing well where did they get that attribute from they were sons as sons and daughters the healing attribute of the Holy Ghost laid inside of them who I should have built me a little bit of bigger room in this little cubby I'm sitting in here I'm about to go shouting around a little bit hallelujah son to have sonship glory to God it puts us in a position brother don't worry about what we got worry about who we are first what Jesus said in Matthew 6:33 he said seek first the kingdom of God everything else would be added but seek first that kingdom you man and the kingdom of God came not in meat and drink and new wines and New Moon's and but it's the kingdom of power and sonship that's what we are Jesus come to make that sonship real to you and I oh yeah in that one hallelujah even you sisters can holler Amen on that son part because you part of a son someone another sure enough amen and at that son ain't sitting next to you he that's the son of God in heaven sure enough maybe some widow woman sitting out there well what son of my part of the Son of God amen the son the Esso in of God that's right don't not even the sisters out in this we talked about sons but don't forget daughters of God are part of this as well that's right to be what in and he said what inheritance to sonship to be a son of God watch this paragraph 76 now this may choke you to death thank me I hope after all these years we still ain't getting choked on this but did you know that men that are sons of God are a mature God's if you believe it say Amen how many ever knowed that how many knows Jesus said so the Bible said Jesus said did not the law itself say ye are gods and if you called them God's whom the word of the Lord come to him and he said which God said in Genesis 2 that they were God's because they had full domain dominion over the world praise the Lord he given dominion over all things he lost his God ship thank you that he lost his sonship he lost his domain Satan took it over but brother were waiting for the manifestation of the sons of color what is that manifestation alright if by losing it he loses his God ship loses his sonship loses his position loses his domain then cry let's just be very simple about it quite simply if if I've got these papers in my hand and I lose them what is the matter station that I've got of my work it's back in my hands you understand what I'm saying if I lose something what is the manifestation that I've received it it's back where it belongs that's what the manifestation of the sons of God is that's why a prophet in this last day spoke squirrel's that's why I spoke to storms that's why he controlled nature so I done this that and the other to prove to us that man's domain as a god was coming right back into him and his position was being restored through the revelation of the word absolutely now imagine this God knew before there was a star that there be a coronavirus God knew before there was a son that there'd be the bird flu God knew that there'd be the hog flu God through that time lasas gonna be everything from a horse flu to a you name it it ain't gonna get better it's gonna get worse the Bible tells us so prophesied to us he said little bride it's gonna get darker before it starts getting lighter and remember in the last hours when them plagues begin to fall don't forget little sons who was sitting there in the daylight while the rest of the world was dark [Laughter] why the red stuff why the rest of him was sitting out there in darkness lorry the sons of God was sitting over in Goshen and beautiful daylight and what far from there the other day that January we were sitting there in Egypt we was about an hour or something like that I think it was from the Fertile Crescent right up there in Goshen and and I thought as we were crossing through that land come and saw the pyramids and doing mission work there in Egypt and as I stood up and looked at the top of that Great Pyramid up here and didn't have no capstone on it I thought oh yeah that's true ain't she ain't got no capstone Enoch wasn't permitted to reveal the mystery of the will then know there were seven steps in the King's Chamber there were three pole pulls hiding in there there was all these different little places they tell me if you make another little turn there's a queen chamber in there as well oh yes all the mystery of that word was wrote right there in that pyramid but it had no capstone because it wasn't permitted to be revealed in that hour but all a little bride don't you realize where you're sitting right now you're sitting in the revelation of the capstone message the message that is revealing to us what that capstone was what is a capstone it is a stone a perfect stone in its perfect position where it belongs and where it was predestinated to be what is it for you and I it's the same thing as sons of God we have a position remember you don't get that position by going to the altar and jabbering in tongues or shouting a little bit or Haughton glory glory glory I believe the message for the RAM is a prophet that ain't where your positions determine your position was established if your bride before the world ever began now you just have to recognize what that position is all about that's right he lost his God ship lost his sonship lost his domain Satan took it over but brother we're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God lorry who will come and take it back over again amen waiting for the fullness of time remember Paul said times plural right here's the other fullness of time the bride fullness when the pyramid gets to the top listen to this when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out hallelujah says and take every power that Satan's got back from him yes sir it belongs to him that's right the full manifestation of sons alright let's talk a while what is those sons what does that look like what what is the manifestation of sons now friends I want you to get it out of your mind that our life's mission down here at this fulfilling of this age is to come to a spot to where if a storm is bothering us we can holler at it go away and it goes away get it out of your mind that God wants you to walk out into a field of a forest of a bunch of trees and start creating squirrels get it out of your mind that that's the purpose for your life now let me say to this this way to you this we will do if God permit sure baptized repentance laying on a hands break into the bread communion brother gerald these things like you spoke up a little bit ago of sharing the cup of the blood of Jesus Christ and fellowship that cleanses us amen as we walk in the light what more wonderful this will do if God permit but get it out of your mind that those are the things that we seek for give this expression it sounds rude but I think you all know me well enough to know I got no sense to be nice amen amen but any hypocrite can come up and take the bread in the cup any hypocrite can get baptized any hypocrite can set in church amen and partake of the blessings and the gift of God Hebrews 6 tells us so what is the manifestation of those sons what is that manifestation it's when you recognize your true position and then by recognizing that position you're not looking for any certain thing you just know as a son you have a confidence as a son that whatever comes your way you've got dominion over it be it cancer it's tuberculosis be it some other Alzheimer's some other kind of disease be it some kind of plague friends let's just be honest brother Brandon told us what these things would be he opposed it a quote here there today on the internet a few months ago when this all first started brother ben talked about these plagues falling said somebody would run down in their basement some would ride in a bomb shelters he said they would lock himself in their house put a mask on and put some disinfectant on it he said still won't make no difference you got to be born again [Applause] thrown off on brother branham he saw a lot more of that little kentucky and saw a lot more than what they gave him credit for and he told us in the last day that they would break this germ warfare out on the people of god so what is our ambition to rally up the spiritual muster to be able to go out there and say glory to god we're gonna take over coronavirus in the name of jesus it goes away well that'd be wonderful to you get your name on the front page CNN fox the rest of night might might tell your story right they might do it just by chance they might tell the truth about your story it may be but the fact of the matter is that's not what we seek for seek for the revelation of sonship is my position in the body of Christ and what does that look like and as a son when something comes to me or crosses my path in some way as a son or a daughter of God I've got authority over that thing [Applause] cancer comes in my body I can dismiss it I just miss you in the name of Jesus Christ leave my body huh that's what brother Brent all right so the mystery of God's will was in sonship right to understand what we are everything travels in threes right everything runs in threes and I remember he comes the first time to redeem he comes the second time to claim he comes the third time to restore this iteration takes place in the aged by the word but for the Millennium the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked and the third coming everything dies during that time of the tribulation everything goes down and the sons of God will step back upon this earth in psalm 37:11 the meek shall inherit the earth and that tells us that our inheritance then of what we gain of what we are given watch us now it isn't that I'm a son because I've got the earth listen to me this is what the Lord showed me a little bit ago and I tell you like to torment on pieces it's not that I've got the earth that I'm a son but because I'm a son I've got the earth it's not that I've got healing that makes me a son it's because I'm a son I've got healing talked about it he said any prostitute could walk up through the prayer line and it was simple faith believe God and be healed walk off maybe a greater thing would come on and later many of those people walk to brother Mannis pray line didn't always stay healed friends some of the people lost their faith went right back out into sin and everything else in the world not everybody kept their healing but don't forget brother sister the Spirit of God that lives and abides inside of your heart it is not healing or salvation or whatever that makes you a son because you are sons will Riddick garden hallelujah and hallelujah he said he sent forth spirit into your heart crying Abba Father because you are son soulful weaken an ultra generation goes around looking for signs well they're gonna be in trouble a lot of trouble so well glory to god I've got healing power look here look here oil running from my hands they said it said brother man talk about blood running from their forehead I didn't have nothing to do with sonship common faith can produce them things sure can common faith can produce divine healing or God honors faith are you it odd honors faith God will honor your faith anybody's faith don't matter who it is if they believe God he'll honor their faith that'll make him a son mmm that'll make him a son right now look here in Genesis chapter 14 verse 19 and 20 once you get there and your Bible right real quickly if you got a chance let's look at it together Genesis 14 19 and 20 now I want you to listen what God identifies when Abram comes by here after these Battle of the Kings and he's standing out here with Melchizedek and boy oh my my my you talk about a you talk about a thing get ready happen here now watch this God given it in pieces here's a puzzle peace I imagine the devil tried every way to row brother Bob spin this puzzle piece much trying to get to mystery of those seals and all that Mister God that laid underneath em seals trying to ever way in the world to put the puzzle together and fact miserably because reading the words ain't how it comes together takes revelation its population shorty alright Genesis 14 verse 19 any blessed him and he's still a blessing him today he's blessing his sons all the way down to this day - hallelujah and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God watch now possessor of heaven and earth now you remember what Paul said in the opening text Ephesians 1 he said that God through his purpose his mystery might bring together all things in one heaven and earth bring all things together in one with who you and me and him so if he is a possessor of the heavens in the earth and I am in him what's that make me in you Lauren what Fester's of the heavens in the air come on church yes turn right oh you come too late to tell me that the bride ain't nothing Lord she's on cloud 19 not 9 she's way on Bob 9 yes siree Bob look here and blessed be the Most High God right which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand he's doing the same thing today impatience fear depression turmoil sickness multitude sickness trouble discouragement all those things Ruggiero t he just delivers every one of them right into the hand of the elect of God that's right and he gives him eyes of all did you ever think of that what in the world did God need Abraham to pay him ties for he owned everything so why give him a tenth of what he already owned he was trying to prove something there he was trying to show with just a little bit of commitment just a little bit of reverence that God he was a possessor the heavens would honor you by paying tithes to the one that possessed and owned everything why got it he don't need it let me tell y'all brother son when he put the Sun and the heavens out there in that solar system he ain't never had to pay the light bill he don't the world is made up of thousands of different types of gases the Lord ain't never had to pay the gas bill that's right he'll owe all of it owns it a member the Gerald Oh should be the Lord Jesus Christ oh thank him out at church oh if we only knew where we were standing why paint eyes because God wanted him to show his dedication somebody said to me other day as I testified to you at the beginning of the service well I guess you're about starved to death I said I've gained 20 pounds Amen I I said thank God I learned a little bit about carpentry where I can widen my door a little bit of got the front door like this whole thing's over with right the Lord hallelujah yep no no a man that pays his tithes and offerings he don't have to worry again another God it takes some stone-cold Center let him walking up the street arm full of groceries let him get in the fuss with his wife and he just gets mad and sets him down on the road right in front of my doorstep and comes to stomping on well there's the grocery bill I don't have to worry about it the Lord sent Ravens to feed Elijah he knows how to feed me in you yeah he knows how to do it hey man and I I love the gas prices I made my cars getting two weeks to the gallon hallelujah praise the Father amen to the gallon that's right he called in the possessor of the heavens and the earth in other words God owns at all all right now when the battle is over this is adoption again but and what's the next thing we do after the battle is over we meet Melchizedek all right dropping down he said the same Melchizedek he said did Abraham after he got his position watch the same thing milk as that it did Abraham gets his position watches he set his men in order won the battle and come home and here come Melchizedek out with the bread and wine after the battle is owed will brother Gerald I believe you were led of the Lord to talk about that communion a moment ago because her right smack in the middle of it I mean she is and did you know the very place that Abraham and Melchizedek had communion is a very spot the new city will push right up out of the earth right on that very spots where the New Jerusalem will sit right down right on this spot right here he's definitely amen and what was it it was when he said the wedding supper will eat the in the wedding supper with the Lord Jesus in the new world he said blow blessed be the name of the Lord he said that's right after the battle is over Abraham got his position and you you understand it wasn't the blessings that made Abraham Abraham it was Abraham that made the blessings I've said this many times about a son of God and the daughter of God going through troubles they say oh I'm going through the greatest battle I've ever been in my life what am I going to do I said remember that you were a son and a daughter going through the greatest battle you've ever gone through in your life you're a son going through a fight it everybody going through a battle you're a son going through a battle and when a son goes through a battle the devil's got something on his hands now well yeah we get weak we get discouraged we get does all that kind of stuff like that you get depressed you get worried you get fearful then all of a sudden something from the inside hollers out hey boy wake up and see who you are Lauretta god yeah um you are a son straighten up Mac like a son oh [Applause] yeah I hope I ain't shouting you ad out there but I'm getting happy hey mannequin how about I get talking this way and it's just hard to hold back yes sir he got his position after the battle was over all right the mystery of his will all right look in that verse 9 remember in the dispensation of the fullness of time now watch but them said now we learn the fullness of time is waiting for what the fullness of all time is the time that sin will cease death will cease sickness will cease time will cease and I can't wait for it to get there somebody said I run out of time I said that's the whole purpose of serving God one of these days I'm hoping to run completely out of time into eternity heaven the time on all perversions and perverted things that the devil perverted will cease when time itself shall cease and inheritance somebody had to leave you something in order for it to be an inheritance he said now I didn't have any myself but God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world now Jesus come to purchase that inheritance he that's the logos that went out of God was the son of God made man that little God that's right he said then he said now he said I made you a god Moses he said Aaron's your prophet he said who I may act like a religious crepe but I'm not he said when your eyes come open to see those things he said all right he made man of God see a God in his domain and his domain goes from sea to sea from shore to shore he has control of it and Jesus proved it when the winds blow D said peace be still when he come to the trees said no man shall eat from you verily that's little gods you say to this mountain be moved on doubt in your heart believe what you said it shall come to pass and then maybe I could get a rebirth Brennan said Jesus when he was here on earth he was an example of what God will be when he returns in his son Christ Jesus when Jesus returns that's right then you have an idea if you know what he was then oh my then you have an idea of what he's gonna be today [Applause] example a pothead that's right when he was on earth as the son of God he was the first indwelling with the holy spirit did you know that Jesus was the first mortal to end well the Holy Spirit well that quad was poured into Christ not to gods no no not to but God manifests in the flesh Saint John 3:16 parallels and manifests first John 1st Timothy 3:16 for God so loved the world he gave parallels and connects completely with 1st Timothy 3:16 for God was manifested in the flesh well who else was it God the fullness of Godhead body was in him so if Jesus by his sonship Oh once you don't don't fail this what I'm getting ready to say to you this is a beautiful little things will stick out here now if Jesus when he comes there in mark chapter 4 verses 36 through 39 if you want to look at it later when the great storm arises Jesus stands out on the bow the ship rebukes the wind and the wind ceases and there's a great calm in mark chapter 11 that's verses 12 13 and 14 and then verses 19 through 23 he comes to this tree and curses it I noticed the focus of this revelation wasn't upon the miracle of the act that Jesus did why did the wind obey Jesus oh I hope you're here man cos he was a son and not just a son but these hallelujah why did that tree go out there and speak to that tree right now what Renekton the church go speak to tree slap it on the side of the Barkers and I curse you my little trees say look you you might thank you something but I listening it doesn't obey this part this part a what we're talking about no no but why did the tree the chemical reaction the chemistry of that tree changed son of God why Jesus was a son it comes with the son's life spoke power spoken were thority that comes with the sons life healing dynamics to raise the dead that comes with the son's life that's just a sight that's what a human does speech that's what a human does reproduction that's what the human life does eat it's what humans do sleep that's what humans do cast out Devils it's what sons do a Medic part of the son life and it's not because I do these things that makes me a son it's because I'm a son that these things follow me well I love this in queen of sheba brother brems said now what does he do yeah he doesn't give man power to heal neither to save no man can forgive your sins it's already said forgiven you just have to accept your pardon no man can heal you God has already did it you just have to accept it so that tells us that it's not in the flesh of this thing oh you said well I was born a Branham or I was born a coffee or born in nor odd or born a lush or whatever I was I because I come from a good family because I've got a church background that ain't got nothing to do with nothing we know that we know that that's not the part that does the healing this is only the instrument that packs the Esso in around let me see the real me you're looking at my face of what you say has been Nora but the real me is a whole lot different than what this look on the outside is and me ain't got no bald spot on the back of his head that's one thing I'm thankful about this camera look at me in the face you don't get to see my bald spot this time around hallelujah praise the Lord for that I think I kind of like that hey hey man I used to have hair I don't know where it went though hey man I had nieces I guess and children all right now the Pool of Bethesda brother Brennan said now our Heavenly Father you said whatsoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven you believe that whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven Lord that's in your word whatever sins you remit they're remitted whoever sins you retain they are retained that's what you promised you said now in obedience to your word I lay my hands upon my sister and bless her and to loose her from this trouble now that that sounds good that how comes sickness is obeyed why were they obeying the voice of a little Kentuckian all the branham's died with their boots on so what what difference did this Brenda make from another Branham hmm one was the Sun and one recognized his sonship may remember that when Jesus said whoever sins you remit their remitted whoever sins you retain their retain we have been given the ability to remit sins you know where that happens don't you in the baptismal pool and when we bury him in the water brother Gerald we lay them down and say i baptize you according to Jesus in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost which revealed to us by Simon Peter is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ i baptize you for the remission of your sins and what does that a son even but she tells us in spoken words original seed that life is passed through the body did you know you have the ability to pass eternal life from one person to another that's right you eat that big apple or that orange or that banana whatever you get where do you all reckon that come from it comes from the body when I was down to Nicaragua my first time I saw them big old banana trees and in boys climbing up there barefooted and I'm big hatchet on their back and they climbed at the top men whacking big stalks of bananas they drop down somebody catching them at the bottom with a big net like this and I looked at that big old tree they were climbing up through there and I thought yeah that's right that's the body that the life had to pass through that body in order for us to be able to enjoy that banana where does he turn a life pass today comes to you I listen why because you are a son that's where life comes from o all-praised amen if a dog produces a dog and a cat produces a cat tell me what a son produces and what God produces Jesus Christ I Paul said the Christ be formed in you amen I hope I born you a mat now watch now and in in st. John chapter 9 verse 1 Jesus passes by and sees a man blind from birth all right the disciples asked him who sinned they said neither not the man not the parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him now watch this in verse verse 4 he said I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world now watch what Jesus is saying the reason that this miracle is getting ready to take place is because as a son I am here to spread light sunlight in a dark age that's why it was doing the things he's doing look the lame didn't leap like a heart and the blind eyes come open and that's what made Jesus a son it's because Jesus was a son that the lame leap like a heart blinded eyes come open he was the light of the age Amen I think you're understanding the point I'm trying to bring to you right now now we see now that then the Holy Spirit I'm just gonna go just a little bit further we're gonna quit and save some of this for tomorrow night because we got we got a whole lot more here a lot of hay on the fort well I've been doing a lot of study and then get ready for this and I'm really excited about the next couple of days amen but now perfect strength he talks about now you Catholic people that's what remission of sin is you say the church has the power to remit sins he said how did the church remit sins Jesus didn't tell the church whoever sins you admit their remitted whoever you retain the root end retained but how did they remit the first the sins in the early church they called them to repentance and they baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins not under a confession booth but they repented before God in their heart and when they were standing there they believed and what did the Bible say to as many as believed are you already a v-power [Applause] to come the sons of God right that's how the church remit sins if I want to remit your sins I give you the power to become a son of God that's how I bring you to remittance now the Catholic people they bring them in a booth and set them down and say now my son tell me your wrongs and how many video games did you play this week and how many cuss words did you say and how many cigarettes did you smoke and what all did you do they matter whatever it might have been some little thing all right say 100 Hail Marys and go on about your way your sins are remitted but all of that is nice as it may sound to the human conscience it doesn't give power Amen it doesn't get power to become a Sun what does the elect of God do for those that are sons give other sons the power to become sons oh it's just as perfect just as plain as the nose on your face if you want to see that's what all this preaching is about this is the reason we preach the way we preach it's not to stand up here and educate people the purpose of preaching is to give sons the power to become a son the neck not not you said well we'll play a tape that might be all right the tape was given as as a support as a voice for us to take that voice and start breaking it down into a manner that we can give the sons the tools they need to win it if we leave them to their own devices let them try to figure it on their own rather let's just be honest you can hand some people a tent give them instructions give them a box give them poles give them steaks ask him to set it up in 45 minutes they've tangled up and they got their head wrapped that thing's wrapped around their head that they're choking to death they've done messed it all can't follow the directions and then we're gonna hand people's push play on a tape recorder and expect people to figure out how to become sons well some people can't walk and chew gum at the same time come on somebody huh come on preach to me a minute [Applause] [Music] some people can't even tie their shoelaces and yet we're gonna just play them a tape and all of a sudden they're gonna become sons hogwash nonsense trash on me right at the devil lies that's why the fivefold ministry brings the word in such a manner that we can take that voice that voice of God now not compromise that our muddy it up say it like you said it but take the word and apply it to the son's life where they can have power themself to become a son look sister you sitting out there you're not interested in the quotes about Rick Etta you're not interested in the quotes about rock and roll strip teasers and things like that you can hear brother branham say those things but and you can say man to them but they don't apply to you in 2020 though them sons getting up and just reading them quotes like that well I'm just gonna read it we've got a lot of good professional quotas in this message they go their professional quotas they sure are they know how to break quote that word boy what good does it do you if you don't give the people the power to become a son I like that I like that I don't matter to me what y'all think I like it they love you but I like it I do okay I don't know so much about that well you might be disagreeing that's all right maybe not you hear the invisible audience hear me you may not agree with some of that well brother been the real voice of God as I heard some poor fellas saying here the other day we these preachers he said need to have the strength to let the voice speak in the platform well that's what I do every time I preach I let the voice do some talking every time I talk that's why we pray and bow our heads say father bless the speaker and the listener because we're hoping the voice the voice gives us the power to become sons I mean what good does it do us to throw all these quotes and scriptures together if what we're reading and what we're talking about doesn't give you the power to become the son I think about a church let people get sick in the hospital what we gonna do walking in with a sealed book laid on their arm and say praise the Lord the first horse rider was the devil I rise and be healed I'm not throwing off but those are just words and remember there was a warning brother branham give every one of us that the Word of God must be positioned in its right place we can't disjoint it so just reading it word verbatim and saying exactly what the Prophet said that's wonderful thank God for it we want to listen to that voice and hear what that prophet said no preacher in this message is ever gonna have the authority above this message but our job is to give you power how delue you to become a son of God and if you're the ability to take that sonship and make it work in your daily life yes sir all right that day on Calvary what is he turn a life he said the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that oh brother man I wish you had this quote to put up where everybody could see this I I should have give it to you somehow another but anyways he said a son of God can what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others I'm gonna get it again just so you catch it can a man do that big question mark a son of God Kenny says Jesus said whoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whoever sins you retain to them they are retained he said that's where the Catholic Church I mean these others made their big mistake go out and say I forgive sins that wasn't it well then what was it rather random it was to be able to go out and call them to repentance take them to the water and baptize them in Jesus name and to them that believed Givi power to become the sons of God give you power to become sons that is the purpose of the Ministry of Malachi for that was the purpose of the message of the hour all together was to give us the ability to become sons what good the opening of the seals that the opening of the seals doesn't position you as a son right Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost about how they get their sins forgiven the Bible what can we do to be saved he laid down the prescription repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said there's the greater works I hope you didn't miss that there's the greater works that's what the preachers business to do well if you want to know what kind of business I'm in I'm in this business giving sons power I'm in the son given power business son given power to other sons incorporated praise the Lord yes sir that's right for them to repent to be baptized for the remission of their sins a little bit father won't quit alright because we've been going whole service beginning being here a couple hours and I don't want to wear yak because I know you got one time tomorrow alright whoever sins you forgive I'll forgive them to whoever sins you do not forgive hold it against them I'll hold it against them to that's what Jesus said that's right so in other words now watch coming to the third pool preach into the eternal Lost the church has the power to hold the sins against them how when they're called to repentance and they won't repent the church holds it against them what do y'all think is going to happen on the day of judgment consider this for a minute when they stand up around the day of judgment and we're called to the attorney box and the voice is played of repentance and preaching going forth to get himself right with God are you go Walker so no Lord they didn't mean to do it no no because they rejected truth in the hour of mercy that they had to receive it to receive mercy received the Lord in the time that you're supposed to be able to receive because they rejected him at that time then the church holds the sin against them I can't give you power to become a son of God you will repent you see it now you see what a place this third pool is will will preach to those that can not be saved you see why it is because the father's business of the last days gives sons power to become sons those that will not receive that power we hold that unbelief against them remember you have to be a guardian to the Tree of Life you have to guard the Word of God you cannot stand out there and say well glory to God and hallelujah and bless your heart and you know you've got a piece of brother brems suitcase and you was in a meeting and you slept on the pew as a message kid and nothing I'm not going straight for you hmm no if when the power is presented to become a son if it's rejected then whoever sins you remit their remitted whoever sins you retain their retained [Applause] that's right now that's hard I know we don't like that we don't like that kind of preaching I know we like them good one line or preaching bride's bride and gonna make it in heaven hallelujah new glory to God but there's a Judgment Day coming brethren we got to be able to look at this as sons of God mature all right can I show you an example of this real quick y'all got a few minutes well if you don't this is a good now see if there's ever a time you wanted to just turn me off now you just click the button that's all she wrote you don't even have to run me out of town you just turn to set off out there and be all right hallelu just blame it on a power outage or something like that you know I I don't know if you want to do baby watch here in Acts chapter 5 verse 1 but a certain man named Ananias and Sapphira mmm-hmm see where we're gone sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife is also being privy to it brought a certain part late at the Apostles feet but Peter said Ananias why has Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land why is it remained was not a tyonne and after it was sold was it not thine own power why stop conceived as staying in nine heart now it's not lied unto men but unto God in a nice here in the words brother member sakhi that was so great it caused him to have a massive heart attack right on the spot very soon the whole and he fell down and gave up the ghost now watching great fear came on all of them that heard those things then verse 9 how is it they have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband at the door and they would carry the out straightway she yielded up the ghost all right now that's the son that's a son in action retaining the sin you won't repent you wouldn't do right now if you read the verses right before that fifth chapter there you'll find out that there's a man right there in the Bible right just right before these verses kick in within and Isis of Sephora right where Luke the writer drops right into that about look at them last verses right before that chapter where the man that he refers to III was trying to think of his name anyhow I was looking at the other day but he goes in and says how that he's sold and says it a couple of times I sold and gave his possession out for the disciples and then immediately here comes this in chapter 5 with Ananias and so far they kept a part of it back showing that whatever sin was retained it would be retained alright next chapter 13 verse 7 they're in the country the deputy of the country is sega's paulius a prudent man who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God but elements the sorcerer for so was his name my interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith then Saul who is also called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost watch now said eyes on him amen the Sun set his eyes on another one and said all full of all subtility and all mischief now child of the devil well what have they been sitting there with her video camera their telephone in her hand taking this and putting it on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and all the rest and there'd be millions of YouTube comments who gives this man a right to call him a child of the devil I tell you we'd give him a ride he was a son and as son he was promised by Jesus whoever sins you retain they are retained seed our child of the devil verse 10 now enemy of all righteousness well thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and now I behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou shall be blind not seeing the Sun for a season and immediately there fell on a mist in a darkness and it went about seeking some to leave him by the hand and the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord what did it a son retained son retained the sins and then Paul says again in first Corinthians chapter 3 verse 21 therefore let no man glory and men for all things are yours praise Lord whether Paul or Apollo's are safe Cephas or the world or life or death or the things present or things to come I like that all are yours and here we go and ye are Christ's and Christ is God [Applause] [Laughter] praising everything who's he talking to brother Gerald son [Music] sons with full power you see this is the hour that the mystery the will of God is being revealed to us what was the opening of the seven seas let me say quickly and then is quit the opening of the seven seals very simply put was showing the position of the true manifested sons of the last day position in the word you remember last time I was there we talked about all those positions and things remember we talked about the future events last year and if you recall remember I told you at the opening of the seals you probably remember me remarking if you don't let me repeat it briefly but you remember remarket how that when the seals come open look how everything found its position now brother Brenham tied a lot of loose ends together Charles taze Russell talked about you know the hundred and forty-four thousand and these other things like that but yet when the seals come open look how brother bran plays 144,000 it was them Jews that remnant that's left here in the tribulation that will received a message than two prophets look at the foolish Spurgeon I call you no more Church he said I call you bride there's a church and then there's a bride even those kind and good to the Brethren even those living outside the city the nation's that stand for Israel they got a place and look at all these positions starting to fall in their place well if Israel knows who she is brother Gerald and if the rest I don't know who they are by the bomb then shouldn't also in the revelation of the will of God shouldn't there also be the revelation glory to God a food then sons are as well I tell you yen a man position of the sons has been revealed so you see it's like a great puzzle God in his way slowly unfolded the mystery of it Jesus made up a portion of the puzzle and all the pieces that made up his hour but then God finished it off by allowing the sons to find their position in the great economy of God and because you are sons will open with that tomorrow night the Lord will unless he changes my heart on it will open tomorrow night because you are sons he sends in his spirit crying Abba Father I want to take that and go a whole different direction try to expound and get a little deeper on some of these things because as you know Friday night we just lay the foundation on a couple of things to get the get the motor running and get the engine hot hey hallelujah but because you are sons Amen why does the church retain what gives me the right to stand at judgment say thus and though and though and though what gives me the right I'm a son you walk into a business and that man walks over and says you're fired get your stuff and get out of here well somebody could retort back what gives you the right he's the owner of the business it's business he owns it he's got a right hey man that's why healing is the children's bread because you are sons grace look all right Mary's gone I love it let's pray together can we stand to our
