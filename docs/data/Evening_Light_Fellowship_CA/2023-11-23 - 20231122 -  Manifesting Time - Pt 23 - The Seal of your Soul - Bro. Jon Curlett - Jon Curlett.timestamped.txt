[39:18] as well in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[39:23] amen amen God bless you turn if you
[39:25] would to Ephesians chap CH
[39:27] 4 Ephesians chapter
[39:31] 4 amen somebody asked me they said are
[39:34] you done with stature of a perfect man
[39:36] brother John I said no because we're on
[39:38] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost has so
[39:41] many things for us and means so many
[39:42] things for us and it does so many things
[39:44] for us that I said we're probably going
[39:46] to be on this one a little bit this idea
[39:48] of Charity this Divine love this a agape
[39:50] love which is Christ himself amen but we
[39:53] want to take a a different look at this
[39:55] tonight and a bit of a different angle
[39:57] than what we've been looking at perhaps
[39:59] amen so Ephesians chap 4 verse 22 amen
[40:02] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[40:04] this evening amen it's good to be in a
[40:06] warm building when it's cold and windy
[40:08] and snow it seems it's a little early
[40:12] amen I don't know who to blame but
[40:13] there's somebody out there I think so we
[40:16] ought to draw straws maybe like Jonah
[40:19] amen Ephesians 4:22 it's good to be here
[40:22] that you put off Paul says concerning
[40:25] the former conversation the former life
[40:28] the old man which is corrupt according
[40:30] to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in
[40:33] the spirit of your mind and that ye put
[40:36] on the new man which after God is
[40:39] created in righteousness and true
[40:41] Holiness if there's a new man that means
[40:43] there's an old man amen and if there's a
[40:46] a spirit that's renewed it means there
[40:48] was a spirit that there that you had
[40:50] before this began there was something
[40:51] you're coming back to so there's a new
[40:53] man and there's a renewing of the spirit
[40:55] of your mind he says wherefore for
[40:56] putting away lying speak every man truth
[40:59] with his neighbor for we are members one
[41:01] of another he said and be ye angry and
[41:05] sin not let not the sun go down upon
[41:08] your wrath neither give place to the
[41:11] devil that means don't give Satan an
[41:13] opportunity don't give him a chance
[41:15] don't give him a conversation don't give
[41:17] him the time of day don't let him dwell
[41:20] in your thoughts don't let them dwell in
[41:22] your life don't let them dwell in your
[41:23] habits don't open the door he says let
[41:27] him that stole steal no more but rather
[41:30] let him labor working with his hands the
[41:32] thing which is good that he may have to
[41:34] give to him that needeth let no corrupt
[41:37] communication proceed out of your mouth
[41:39] but that which is good to the use of
[41:42] edifying I believe if we did that every
[41:44] day it' change our conversations that
[41:47] everything we say would be good to the
[41:49] use of edifying edify means to build
[41:54] up he says that it may minister grace to
[41:57] the hearers he says and grieve not the
[42:00] holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[42:03] unto the day of redemption amen God
[42:07] bless you you can have your seats this
[42:09] evening and as I said we're turning it
[42:10] into a bit of a different thing we we
[42:12] spoke on the uh we we had a three-part
[42:16] series there that we just finished on
[42:18] coming into Perfection and now I want to
[42:20] talk this evening on the Seal of your
[42:22] soul amen the Seal of your soul and
[42:24] we've talked about this attribute of
[42:26] charity now for a few services and so we
[42:28] ought to know what it is by now and I
[42:30] don't want to cover that but I I I want
[42:32] to talk about what it means when we get
[42:34] the Holy Ghost what is God doing what is
[42:36] it signifying and and we've taught on
[42:38] this a little bit before and that's that
[42:40] we are a Triune being brother brandham
[42:42] Tau the scripture teaches us that and on
[42:44] the very inside of the inside we have a
[42:46] soul and then outside of that we have a
[42:48] spirit and then outside of that we have
[42:50] a body we've got three different Realms
[42:52] and we know that there's a battle
[42:54] between God and Satan for the the the
[42:56] control of all
[42:58] three that's what they're looking for
[43:00] they're looking for control in their
[43:01] lives and it's a battle between good and
[43:03] evil amen and and we've got these
[43:05] different areas and and brother BR would
[43:07] say that God took the soul and then he
[43:10] says but the devil took the Mind amen
[43:12] and he said brother BR would say and
[43:14] this is something that'll help certainly
[43:15] the young people perhaps but all of us
[43:17] brother BR would say the Temptation we
[43:19] face is not in your soul when once you
[43:21] get the Holy Ghost the Temptation is in
[43:23] your flesh it's in your spirit it's
[43:26] outside of the soul the soul has made
[43:27] its decision brother bam says you got a
[43:29] free will free moral agency to choose
[43:33] who comes into your life and when you
[43:35] receive the Holy Ghost it's because
[43:37] you've made your choice and he's
[43:39] accepted it and he's come in and he's
[43:41] received what you've done but the spirit
[43:43] he says is our worldly nature he says
[43:46] and that is
[43:47] unredeemed there there's nothing good in
[43:49] it it's a beast nature and so the spirit
[43:51] is at war with the
[43:53] soul as long as you've got the Holy
[43:55] Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[43:57] your soul and your spirit get along just
[43:59] fine because there's nobody in your soul
[44:00] at that point it's it's a place where
[44:03] things can come and go and reside and if
[44:05] God's not there then you're there that's
[44:07] the way it goes because remember what
[44:09] lives in the soul is the control tower
[44:11] that's the control tower for the
[44:12] believer so whoever's in there is the
[44:14] one that controls your life and if
[44:16] Christ is not in there that means that
[44:17] it's self-will that's there it means
[44:19] that you haven't died out to yourself so
[44:20] that he can come in amen but the
[44:22] Temptation that we get after the Holy
[44:24] Ghost is in our spirit and our in our
[44:26] flesh realm but brother R would say this
[44:28] he said in the Garden of Eden God and
[44:30] the devil chose their part of the man
[44:32] the devil took his head and God took his
[44:34] heart that would be his soul he said the
[44:36] devil tries to show him with his mental
[44:38] power some great something he can do
[44:43] Devil's trying to empower you with what
[44:45] you've got he says and he only wants to
[44:48] see with his eyes what he can see but
[44:51] God come in his heart and makes him
[44:53] believe for things he cannot see he
[44:55] Calles the scripture for faith is the
[44:57] substance of things hoped for the
[44:59] evidence of Things Not Seen he just
[45:02] believes it it's an amazing thing when
[45:05] you see somebody that first comes to the
[45:07] Lord and certainly we can probably think
[45:09] back to our original conversions and you
[45:12] believe things and you don't even know
[45:14] why you believe
[45:15] it why because there's something inside
[45:18] of you that's connecting with what
[45:19] you're hearing and with what you're
[45:21] seeing and with what you're reading you
[45:23] believe it because there's something on
[45:25] the inside that says that's me that it
[45:28] identifies with that he says so he just
[45:31] believes it because God said it he
[45:33] doesn't have to see nothing or no sense
[45:35] of his body has to declare it he just
[45:37] believes it in his soul where God lives
[45:42] that's a supernatural thing he says but
[45:44] the devil took his head and makes him
[45:46] smart figures himself out of religion a
[45:49] way of Escape it never works and yet men
[45:52] keep trying it men keep trying a new
[45:54] religion a new way a new technology a
[45:56] new process a new mental conception
[45:59] whatever it might be men keep trying it
[46:01] and yet they never Escape they never do
[46:05] I was talking to someone the other day
[46:08] we were talking about the The
[46:09] Temptations of the ministry and it seems
[46:11] like every week you hear of another
[46:13] Minister folling I'm not speaking about
[46:14] the message but I'm speaking in general
[46:16] because they've made a religion and
[46:18] they're trying to escape and they're
[46:19] trying to make a way and they themselves
[46:21] are captive and you can't free somebody
[46:24] if you're in captivity and you you see a
[46:26] falling and a falling and a falling
[46:27] because all they've got is religion they
[46:29] don't have Christ he says he figures
[46:31] himself out of religion a way of Escape
[46:34] but God wants to lead him to the path of
[46:38] worship not not not something you can do
[46:41] but bring you to a place where you
[46:43] recognize the god that makes all things
[46:45] possible Amen brother B would say the
[46:47] soul is the nature of the spirit that
[46:50] means it matters who's in control of the
[46:52] soul that means it matters who's in
[46:53] there amen The Anchor Point for the
[46:55] Believers the soul and that's the true
[46:57] control tower for us once we receive the
[46:59] baptism of the Holy Spirit but until
[47:02] then all the gates are open all the
[47:04] access points are open and any influence
[47:07] that's out there potentially can control
[47:09] you it can come in through your mind it
[47:11] can come through your conscience it can
[47:12] come through your memories it can come
[47:14] through your five outer senses the five
[47:15] inner senses whatever it is but Satan's
[47:18] access point is primarily through your
[47:20] mind and God's access is through your
[47:22] soul or through your heart and whichever
[47:24] one you listen to is the one that will
[47:26] determine the outcome it's very simple
[47:28] we make a choice every day as to what
[47:30] our condition's going to be in that day
[47:32] and in that situation and in these
[47:34] circumstances amen we read the the
[47:36] scripture last service that said we were
[47:37] born by the word of Truth and that means
[47:39] we're Eternal with the word of God and
[47:41] God's trying to get us back to that
[47:42] eternity that we came from that's the
[47:45] entire process of this but like I said
[47:47] the condition in which we leave this
[47:48] world the condition in which we live
[47:50] through this world is determined on
[47:51] what's controlling us for that day now
[47:54] your soul is sealed Paul said it's
[47:56] sealed to the day of redemption amen
[47:58] that's the that's the the day of the
[47:59] Resurrection that's the day of the
[48:01] Rapture that's sealed but everything
[48:03] else is now in a battle for who's going
[48:05] to control it the soul is sealed but
[48:08] your mind's not sealed so Paul said
[48:10] we've got to take on the mind of Christ
[48:13] and Paul said I Die daily there's
[48:15] something that's going all day every day
[48:18] and there's a battle there that's for
[48:20] control of our life but there's an
[48:22] eternal bit inside of us and when that's
[48:24] sealed it's a finished work work and
[48:26] we'll talk about that a little bit more
[48:27] this evening but everyday battle for the
[48:29] believer is this battle now between
[48:31] what's on the inside and everything else
[48:34] and sometimes what beats us up as
[48:35] Believers is that we sit there and we we
[48:38] have a a trial In the Flesh and we think
[48:40] that means we don't have the Holy Ghost
[48:41] no that just means you're human that
[48:43] just means you still have a fallen body
[48:46] amen but the fact that there's a battle
[48:47] means there's something on the inside
[48:49] that doesn't want to do what the flesh
[48:50] wants you to do and sometimes the fact
[48:52] that there's a battle is the greatest
[48:53] sign that you do have the Holy Ghost cuz
[48:55] nobody else is fighting what you're
[48:56] fighting amen but we covered this back
[49:00] in 2022 I had to look through my slides
[49:02] and notes but there's a gate that's
[49:05] between our soul and our spirit I'm
[49:07] sorry it's a little hard to maybe see
[49:09] there that's the coloration but you've
[49:11] got your soul on the inside and that's
[49:13] that's your your control tower for the
[49:15] believer and that's sealed by the holy
[49:17] spirit amen but everything outside of
[49:20] that is not sealed everything outside of
[49:22] that is not
[49:23] redeemed every bit outside of that is
[49:26] open to access points and we went
[49:27] through how brother Bram said that the
[49:29] mind is the gate to the spirit and it's
[49:33] the gate to the soul but once the soul
[49:36] is sealed it's a one-way gate you can't
[49:38] go into the soul anymore it's sealed but
[49:40] what's inside the gate can come out
[49:41] what's inside this the the the soul can
[49:43] come out and what's in there is what
[49:45] it's the word it's Faith it's love it's
[49:47] life it's light it's all of these things
[49:49] and so you have to push what's in your
[49:52] soul through the mind to get to your
[49:56] soul and your body or your spirit and
[49:57] your body or you have to bypass it and
[50:01] really that's what faith does is Faith
[50:02] bypasses the mind the the natural way of
[50:05] thinking and it goes and it it impacts
[50:07] directly on the on the on the spirit and
[50:09] on your body remember brother brandom
[50:11] said the right mental attitude towards
[50:14] any promise of God will bring it to pass
[50:17] why because what's in your soul is the
[50:19] holy spirit what's in your your soul is
[50:21] Faith is life and so when you go into
[50:24] your mind and you say I'm going to
[50:25] believe what the word says I'm going to
[50:28] confess what the holy spirit says inside
[50:30] of me then it bypasses and pushes away
[50:32] all doubt all thoughts all senses
[50:36] whatever it is and it says I'm going to
[50:37] be subject to the word of God now that
[50:39] can go into your into your spirit now
[50:41] that can be brought under control and
[50:43] all your memories and your conscience
[50:45] and these different things can be
[50:46] brought subject to the word and then
[50:47] when that's brought subject then it can
[50:49] ignore your five senses and it brings
[50:51] them under control and now the whole
[50:52] body is now under what subjection to the
[50:55] Holy Spirit Spirit subjection to the
[50:56] word of God but you've got to choose
[50:58] where that's going to go how that's
[51:00] going to go it never changes your soul
[51:02] but it changes how you go through day
[51:04] today in your life
[51:06] Amen brother BR would say or or job
[51:09] would say the thing that I greatly
[51:11] feared has come upon me and that of
[51:13] which I was afraid has come to me you
[51:16] watch what you're thinking and you
[51:18] definitely watch what you're
[51:20] saying because what you confess has
[51:22] access to you if you say I'm an no good
[51:25] believer guess what Satan has every
[51:28] access point to drive home to you that
[51:29] you're a no good
[51:30] believer if you say I'm sick he has
[51:33] every right to make you sick if you say
[51:36] I'm poor he has every right to make you
[51:38] poor if you say I don't have faith then
[51:41] he has every right to attack your faith
[51:43] every access point you give him will be
[51:44] through what the way you think and
[51:47] you've got to lock that out by the word
[51:48] of God and say I'm G to believe the word
[51:50] I'm not going to believe what anything
[51:51] else says you decide what happens so
[51:54] many times think right by putting a word
[51:57] filter on your thoughts and that'll
[51:59] change your your words that'll change
[52:01] your attitude and that'll change your
[52:03] body literal healing comes from inside
[52:07] brother B just says you're just letting
[52:08] the Holy Ghost do the work that it's
[52:10] supposed to do CU When you get the Holy
[52:12] Ghost you get everything that was in
[52:14] Christ you get Deliverance you get
[52:16] healing you get provision you get
[52:18] blessing you get joy peace rest all
[52:20] those things and all you're doing is
[52:21] saying I'm going to let what he put in
[52:23] me I'm going to let him in me
[52:25] take effect in my life and you do it by
[52:28] the way that you think and the thoughts
[52:29] that you think and what you bring your
[52:30] thoughts subject to in your life amen we
[52:34] control those things we have free moral
[52:36] agency as to what we're going to dwell
[52:38] on in our life and what we're going to
[52:39] say Amen but this soul is the parts that
[52:42] sealed and everything else is a battle
[52:45] to let what's inside of you have control
[52:47] and that's every day we'll never get out
[52:48] of it we'll never get out of it as far
[52:50] as I know because we're always going to
[52:51] be in this body that's imperfect until
[52:53] the day of our Redemption until until
[52:55] the day we pass from this life into the
[52:57] next one but listen to this brother bam
[52:59] says God has a new birth for
[53:04] you God has a new birth for you remember
[53:07] what Peter said in Acts 2 he said for
[53:09] the promises unto you and to your
[53:11] children and to all that are a far off
[53:14] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[53:15] call brother I'm saying everyone that
[53:18] hears the word that is a real believer
[53:20] has a new birth that's waiting for them
[53:22] God has a new birth for you he says but
[53:24] listen to his still Small Voice every
[53:27] one of you people who profess to be
[53:29] Christians get yourself quiet before him
[53:32] don't let the washing hinder don't let
[53:35] the work hinder don't let nothing hinder
[53:38] don't let nobody know what you're doing
[53:40] just go before him get up in the woods
[53:43] somewhere get out on the side of the
[53:44] road go into the secret closet and close
[53:47] the door he said when the kids go to
[53:49] school there get down on your knees he's
[53:52] leaving no excuse for us he's saying if
[53:54] you want the Holy Ghost if you want the
[53:56] new birth you let God know and don't let
[54:00] anything hold you back he says you've
[54:02] heard all kinds of voices everywhere but
[54:05] just get down and stay there until those
[54:08] voices are silenced and you begin to
[54:10] lift up he says it'll change you it'll
[54:13] make you different like it did this
[54:14] little Samuel he's talking about the
[54:16] still Small Voice that Samuel heard he
[54:18] says it'll do something to you if you'll
[54:20] just do it you got to let God know you
[54:24] got to let God no I want the Holy Ghost
[54:27] Lord I want you in my soul I want you in
[54:29] my life I want you to have complete
[54:30] control I want to be
[54:33] changed he says now it'll make you what
[54:35] you should be it'll make you the kind of
[54:38] Christian you ought to
[54:40] be I was just listening this this week
[54:42] and to to God is uh hid God hidden in
[54:46] Simplicity and revealed in the same and
[54:48] brother Bram said God can give you the
[54:50] holy ghost at any time you say well
[54:54] brother John it says repent and be
[54:55] baptized all I can say is in Acts while
[54:57] Peter yet spake these words the Holy
[55:00] Ghost fell on them that heard his
[55:02] words what brother bam says it's based
[55:05] on the condition of your heart that's it
[55:08] so while we've been preaching all of
[55:10] this about the the stature of a perfect
[55:13] man and the attributes in the end God
[55:15] knows what's in there and he'll give you
[55:18] the Holy Ghost when what's in there
[55:21] lines up with what he expects out of
[55:22] your life and he can do that at any
[55:26] time it's not for me to tell you when
[55:28] you got it it's not for me to tell you
[55:30] if you got it but you go to him and you
[55:33] lay yourself be before him we'll read
[55:35] some quotes about it in a minute you lay
[55:37] yourself you surrender you truly repent
[55:40] God is obligated to give you the Holy
[55:42] Ghost he can give it to you at any time
[55:44] he can give it to you in this service he
[55:46] can give it to you while you're driving
[55:48] down the road he can do it while you're
[55:50] kneeling by your bed he can do it while
[55:52] you're listening to music you could be
[55:53] doing anything and if your heart is on
[55:56] him I believe he can come down and give
[55:58] you the Holy Ghost brother Bram saying
[55:59] the same thing he says it'll make you
[56:01] the kind of Christian that you ought to
[56:04] be but I will say this as I've been
[56:06] studying this over the last few months
[56:08] there's one thing I came to realize and
[56:10] it's not that I didn't realize it before
[56:12] but it's that there are many people that
[56:14] think they have the Holy Ghost that
[56:15] don't have the Holy
[56:17] Ghost and I believe part of that is
[56:19] because of message culture because we've
[56:21] we've gotten to this point where we say
[56:23] well if you recognize a prophet for this
[56:25] and you believe his message you have the
[56:26] Holy Ghost and Jesus never said that
[56:29] Jesus said by their fruits you shall
[56:30] know them not by the fact that they
[56:33] attend church God's not looking for
[56:35] people to warm pews with their rear ends
[56:37] that's not the goal is to put rear ends
[56:39] in the seats it's to put living
[56:41] creatures that reflect Christ on this
[56:44] Earth amen so the more you get into this
[56:48] and and the more I study and I only
[56:50] bring the high points really and maybe
[56:52] that sounds scary that I'm only bringing
[56:53] the high points but I try and find you
[56:55] know the the most perfect quotes and the
[56:56] most perfect scriptures to to bring
[56:58] together these thoughts but the more you
[57:00] read and brother random gets into
[57:01] details and I'm not going to go specific
[57:03] with it tonight by any means but he gets
[57:05] into things and he says if you got this
[57:06] in your life and you're doing it you
[57:08] can't have the Holy Ghost and do those
[57:10] things you can't be certain ways and
[57:13] have the Holy Ghost he says it's
[57:15] impossible that that nature doesn't work
[57:18] that's not the Holy Ghost it can't be
[57:19] the Holy Ghost you need something
[57:21] greater than what you've got don't throw
[57:23] away what you've got but we may have
[57:25] exactly what we think we do brother BR
[57:27] puts it this way remember because we
[57:29] read the quote last service where he
[57:30] said you were one thing and now you're a
[57:32] different thing and it's a completely
[57:34] different thing and people know that
[57:36] you've been with Jesus they know there's
[57:37] been a change he says you thinking you
[57:40] have it and having it is two different
[57:43] things you might be able to try to say
[57:45] you have and you might be able to show
[57:47] some evidence of some emotion but he
[57:49] said unless your life is vindicating
[57:51] what you're professing to have you still
[57:53] haven't got it
[57:55] and we know what we
[57:57] are I say that by we know what's on the
[58:00] inside we see what nobody else sees we
[58:04] know what's going on when nobody else
[58:05] knows what's going on people can't read
[58:07] our thoughts but we know what's going on
[58:08] on the inside he says but no matter how
[58:11] many emotions how much you jump run
[58:13] Sensations speakings in tongues or
[58:15] shouting or whatever you might lay it
[58:17] upon it's all right I believe in all
[58:19] that too but unless your life copes with
[58:21] your testimony then you haven't got it
[58:24] cuz the fruit of the spirit vindicates
[58:26] what you are just like the fruit of any
[58:28] tree tells what it is Jesus said by
[58:31] their fruit you shall know
[58:33] them so I think that's why Peter said
[58:35] you know in in second Peter 1 in that
[58:37] stature of a perfect man after he reads
[58:40] through all or he lists all of these
[58:42] Seven Virtues and then he adds in
[58:43] charity he says for if these things be
[58:46] in you Faith virtue knowledge and such
[58:49] and the Holy Ghost and abound so not
[58:52] just a bit abounding means super
[58:55] abundant overflowing it says if these
[58:58] things be in you and abound they make
[59:00] you that ye shall neither be baren nor
[59:03] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[59:06] Jesus Christ you know what that tells me
[59:08] that means there can be a knowledge of
[59:09] the Lord Jesus Christ that is Barren and
[59:13] unfruitful that you can have an
[59:15] understanding you can have a revelation
[59:17] you can have an exposure and experience
[59:19] to Christ but it doesn't produce life
[59:22] cuz he says if you're not Barren that
[59:24] means you're producing life and if
[59:26] you're not unfruitful that means you're
[59:27] fruitful that means you're producing
[59:29] fruit you've got something that's coming
[59:31] out of this knowledge you have he says
[59:34] for he that lath these things is blind
[59:36] cannot see a far off and ha forgotten
[59:39] that he was purged from his old sins
[59:41] he's saying you're Justified and
[59:42] Sanctified but you've forgotten the work
[59:44] he did because you didn't go on all the
[59:45] way and you actually forget what it is
[59:48] you're supposed to
[59:49] be he says wherefore the rather Brethren
[59:53] give diligence to make your calling and
[59:55] election sure for if you do these things
[59:59] you shall never
[1:00:02] fail Peter is insane we'll never make
[1:00:05] mistakes I think with young people it's
[1:00:07] the the hardest thing is when you fail
[1:00:10] and guess what it never gets easier but
[1:00:12] when we're younger we tend to have we we
[1:00:14] tend to make a bigger deal of failures I
[1:00:16] think I think as we get older we find
[1:00:19] Grace and we realize the the the
[1:00:21] magnitude of Grace but I remember as a
[1:00:23] Young Man boy I could do just about any
[1:00:26] little thing and it would just about
[1:00:28] kill
[1:00:29] me because I thought that is not what a
[1:00:33] Believer ever does but guess what we
[1:00:36] lose battles sometimes and that's what
[1:00:39] the blood of Jesus Christ is for not
[1:00:41] just to forgive you of the sins you've
[1:00:42] done in the past but what you do every
[1:00:44] single
[1:00:45] day I me every single day we do these
[1:00:48] things but Peter's saying that we will
[1:00:50] never turn back to what we left behind
[1:00:52] we can't go back it's dead the old
[1:00:55] Nature's dead the desires are dead it's
[1:00:58] there's nothing to go back to you know
[1:01:00] we've talked about it before how the
[1:01:02] Vikings when they landed in a new land
[1:01:03] they burned their ships so they couldn't
[1:01:05] go back our ships are burnt there's
[1:01:08] nothing to go back to
[1:01:09] anymore he's saying if you do it this
[1:01:12] way if you'll let God do this work in
[1:01:15] your life you will never fail and if you
[1:01:17] go all the way not just justification
[1:01:21] not just sanctification but you come all
[1:01:23] the way and get the Holy Ghost you will
[1:01:25] never ever fail you can't fail because
[1:01:27] it's Christ in
[1:01:29] you but look at what he's talking about
[1:01:31] CU in Hebrews 6 it says for it is
[1:01:33] impossible for those who were once
[1:01:36] enlightened there are people that get to
[1:01:38] see the realities of God brother B would
[1:01:41] talk about this all the time he says and
[1:01:43] have tasted of the Heavenly gift and
[1:01:45] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:48] notice he didn't say they were baptized
[1:01:50] by the Holy Ghost they weren't born of
[1:01:52] the Holy Spirit they're not filled
[1:01:55] they tasted and they partook they got to
[1:01:57] experience the atmosphere they got to
[1:01:59] experience the effects of the Holy
[1:02:01] Spirit and the goodness of God that's
[1:02:04] possible he says and have tasted the
[1:02:06] good word of God and the powers of the
[1:02:08] world to come you say this sounds like a
[1:02:10] Believer brother John you want to put a
[1:02:12] name here put Judas name here because
[1:02:14] Judas tasted of the powers of the world
[1:02:17] to
[1:02:18] come he saw the good things of God he
[1:02:20] heard the word he heard the truth he was
[1:02:22] that selected group that Jesus revealed
[1:02:25] The Parables to everything that the
[1:02:27] disciples before the day of Pentecost
[1:02:30] got to experience so did
[1:02:32] Judas you can have all these things
[1:02:35] sitting in the message
[1:02:37] church but he turned back before the
[1:02:39] upper room
[1:02:41] experience it says if they shall fall
[1:02:43] away to renew them again unto repentance
[1:02:47] they can't find a place of repentance
[1:02:50] they can find a place where they know
[1:02:51] that something's off but like Cain even
[1:02:54] when they know what they need to do
[1:02:56] there's nothing in them to do it that's
[1:02:59] a sad place to be that you could
[1:03:01] experience all of the goodness of God
[1:03:03] and yet never get the Holy Ghost he says
[1:03:06] and what happens is they turn back he
[1:03:09] says they can't renew themselves to
[1:03:10] repentance he's not saying they didn't
[1:03:12] repent the first time he's saying you
[1:03:14] repented and you came up and you turned
[1:03:15] away from the thing that matter most and
[1:03:17] now there's no repenting from that
[1:03:19] you've turned it down he says seeing
[1:03:21] they crucify to themselves the son of
[1:03:23] God aresh and put him to an open shame
[1:03:26] God won't be mocked he's got a bride
[1:03:28] brother Braham says that will not flirt
[1:03:30] with the world she won't flirt with the
[1:03:33] things of the world she won't flirt with
[1:03:34] denominations she won't flirt with men's
[1:03:36] ideas and she certainly won't go back to
[1:03:38] it she'll keep herself separated from it
[1:03:41] why because she's sealed to him amen
[1:03:44] we're coming to the sealing portion amen
[1:03:46] and it's not just charity is an
[1:03:48] attribute but it's the person of God
[1:03:50] himself coming down into our soul and
[1:03:53] sealing our soul
[1:03:54] all the way to Eternity it's that
[1:03:57] resurrection and Rapture day that he
[1:03:59] seals us to that's when we're fully
[1:04:01] restored but until then we've got this
[1:04:02] battle every day and so I want to
[1:04:05] encourage you just because there's a
[1:04:06] battle doesn't mean you're not sealed
[1:04:08] and just because you struggle doesn't
[1:04:09] mean you don't have the Holy Ghost but
[1:04:12] stay in the battle amen cuz greater is
[1:04:15] he that's in you than he that's in the
[1:04:16] world Amen but until we're in this body
[1:04:18] chain until we get this body change
[1:04:20] we're still going to fight these
[1:04:21] shackles of this flesh every single day
[1:04:24] there's a reason brother brandham had to
[1:04:26] hang that cross in the rear mirror of
[1:04:27] his car cuz he was still a red-blooded
[1:04:30] American man that still faced the the
[1:04:32] the the desires and The Temptations that
[1:04:34] every one of us do amen but what does
[1:04:38] this ceiling look like what does it mean
[1:04:39] to us brother bam would say this he says
[1:04:42] now after you believe then you become
[1:04:44] Abram seed truly Abraham's seed he says
[1:04:48] how are we become Abraham's seed by
[1:04:51] being dead in Christ then were Abraham's
[1:04:53] seed and heirs with Abraham according to
[1:04:55] the promise he says after that's
[1:04:58] mentioned means a finished work after
[1:05:00] you believe after means something that's
[1:05:03] been something before that then this is
[1:05:05] a finished work the seal he says is a
[1:05:08] finished work it's proof of a finished
[1:05:11] work he says when you write your
[1:05:13] complete letter whatever it's going to
[1:05:15] be and seal it with your name after the
[1:05:17] package is all done up he says you seal
[1:05:20] it I used to work on the railroad with
[1:05:22] my daddy for a while when we all loaded
[1:05:25] the cars just as good as it could be the
[1:05:28] Box Car the inspector came by and he
[1:05:30] shook
[1:05:31] it he's saying we did our best job but
[1:05:34] it was up to the inspector to say if the
[1:05:36] job was good enough he says he went
[1:05:38] through and see if anything was loose
[1:05:41] and if anything is loose he condemned it
[1:05:44] notice he didn't condemn the package he
[1:05:47] condemned the
[1:05:50] packing sometimes God puts us through
[1:05:53] the Tes and we think he's rejecting us
[1:05:55] no he's not rejecting us he's rejecting
[1:05:57] the condition he's rejecting how well
[1:06:00] packed we are he's saying you're not
[1:06:02] stable enough to go to the next stage
[1:06:05] he's not saying you can't ever do it
[1:06:07] he's saying you're just not ready to
[1:06:08] move on yet he said if anything is loose
[1:06:11] he condemned it and that's what's the
[1:06:14] matter with the inspector going by
[1:06:16] tonight he goes by a lot of Our Lives
[1:06:18] the reason we don't get the Holy Ghost
[1:06:20] oh we might carry on and act like we got
[1:06:22] it but by the fruits we are known he
[1:06:24] says that's how you're known he says and
[1:06:26] he shakes it and finds a little loose
[1:06:28] place here of unbelief a little loose
[1:06:31] place here he condemns it and sets it
[1:06:34] back again he says it's got to be packed
[1:06:37] Tight cuz you've got a rough road to
[1:06:40] travel it's better to fix it now than
[1:06:44] down the
[1:06:45] road do you ever get in your car and
[1:06:48] something was just kind of rubbing a
[1:06:50] little
[1:06:52] bit and you ignore it but once you get
[1:06:55] on the highway you have a little
[1:06:57] vibration in your wheel it's not too bad
[1:06:59] at 30 km an hour when you're going
[1:07:00] through town but when you hit the
[1:07:03] highway and you're doing a 100 that
[1:07:05] little thing that's out of whack all of
[1:07:07] a sudden starts doing this and your
[1:07:09] whole car is shaking brother saying you
[1:07:12] got to get it packed tight before you
[1:07:13] get on this road because otherwise it's
[1:07:16] going to cause you problems down the
[1:07:18] road you got to get it settled up front
[1:07:21] you got to get it packed tight you got
[1:07:22] to get it built right you got to have
[1:07:23] the right material you got to have the
[1:07:25] right condition you got to be in the
[1:07:27] right place in your walk before he can
[1:07:29] give you the Holy Ghost cuz if he
[1:07:30] doesn't then it won't support it and
[1:07:33] it'll
[1:07:34] fail he says it's got to be packed Tight
[1:07:37] cuz you've got a rough road to travel
[1:07:39] remember brother Bram says if you think
[1:07:40] things are tough he says wait till you
[1:07:41] get the Holy Ghost because it only gets
[1:07:43] tougher after that because Satan knows
[1:07:45] he's sealed out he's got no access
[1:07:48] anymore and so he puts twice as many
[1:07:50] things pointed at you as he used to
[1:07:51] before because now you're identified
[1:07:54] he knows who you are and he's going to
[1:07:56] come for you with everything he's
[1:07:59] got he says when God gives a man or
[1:08:01] woman the Holy Ghost he shakes every
[1:08:03] loose feather in the mouth he's talking
[1:08:05] about the the little baby eagles you
[1:08:06] know he says you've got a ride coming
[1:08:09] amen glory he said see if she's packed
[1:08:11] upright what did he do he says
[1:08:14] justification he called her
[1:08:17] sanctification he cleansed her he says
[1:08:20] the Holy Ghost he sealed her so where's
[1:08:23] the calling
[1:08:25] justification he says sanctification he
[1:08:28] cleansed her that's where the shaking is
[1:08:30] justification sanctification that's the
[1:08:32] the shaking that's the see will you
[1:08:34] stick with the word and will you get
[1:08:36] everything else loose out sanctification
[1:08:39] is a much of work as you as it is God
[1:08:41] because God will give you the word and
[1:08:43] he'll say what are you going to do with
[1:08:44] it and you say Lord I don't want that in
[1:08:47] my life Lord I don't want that in my
[1:08:48] life Lord take that desire away and
[1:08:51] that's you saying Lord do the the work
[1:08:54] and it's the working of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:55] In Our Lives to clean those things out
[1:08:57] and it's shaking out all the loose stuff
[1:08:59] that would cause you problems down the
[1:09:00] road it's god making sure that your soul
[1:09:03] is settled on the word of God you've got
[1:09:05] a free will Choice here every day you
[1:09:08] got a choice of whether or not you'll
[1:09:09] take the word and when that's done he
[1:09:12] says packed in tight then they close the
[1:09:15] door cuz why cuz the inspector's name is
[1:09:17] on that seal they know who signed off on
[1:09:20] it and if his C his box cars that they
[1:09:23] kept pack kept coming with broken Goods
[1:09:25] they'd say you don't know how to do your
[1:09:27] job God knows how to do his job he knows
[1:09:30] how to get you to the end but he's not
[1:09:33] going to set you down the road until
[1:09:35] you're good and ready for it he says
[1:09:37] then what's the last thing he puts a
[1:09:39] seal on that railroad car to its
[1:09:41] destination he says not to the next
[1:09:44] Revival but to its
[1:09:47] destination I mean I think there's a bit
[1:09:49] of a spirit sometimes going around to
[1:09:51] where we've got to keep going to
[1:09:52] revivals we got to keep going to special
[1:09:54] meetings we got to keep doing this and
[1:09:55] we got to keep going to to that what to
[1:09:58] keep our our
[1:10:00] life no when you get the Holy Ghost the
[1:10:03] life goes with you all the time every
[1:10:06] time we love special meetings nobody
[1:10:09] loves it more than I do I love to hear
[1:10:11] somebody else preach instead of me I
[1:10:13] love to see what God's doing in another
[1:10:15] man's life in Ministry I love to see
[1:10:17] what God can bring to the people amen
[1:10:20] but I can't dwell on on those special
[1:10:23] times
[1:10:24] to keep me
[1:10:25] going I've got to go know that God's
[1:10:27] Alive and Well day by day I got to know
[1:10:30] he loves me day by day I got to know
[1:10:31] he's leading me day by day I he's got to
[1:10:34] be feeding me can you imagine if we had
[1:10:35] to if we could only get fed in special
[1:10:37] meetings no it's got to be a day by day
[1:10:41] by day hour by hour by hour relationship
[1:10:44] where we know he's with us every single
[1:10:47] day he says what we're sealed not to the
[1:10:49] next Revival not to the next Feelgood
[1:10:52] sermon not to the next hooping and
[1:10:54] hollering and dancing and shouting or
[1:10:55] anything not to the next big
[1:10:59] cry but what all the way to the
[1:11:05] destination he says amen whereby grieve
[1:11:08] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[1:11:10] are sealed until the he says the next
[1:11:12] Revival comes along no until you take a
[1:11:15] notion to join the other Church no he
[1:11:17] says until the day of your Redemption he
[1:11:19] says when God gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:11:22] it's a finished work work amen and you
[1:11:25] can rest your soul cuz it's done it's
[1:11:29] finished and he's the one that says when
[1:11:31] it's done sometimes we think we're ready
[1:11:35] delusions of Competency we call it at
[1:11:37] work we think we're ready we're not
[1:11:39] ready graduate from University I'm
[1:11:43] ready I'm in the ministry I'm ready no
[1:11:46] no God decides when we're good and ready
[1:11:50] he says when a baby comes forth what's
[1:11:52] the first thing in natural life water
[1:11:54] breaks if it's a natural birth what's
[1:11:55] the next blood comes what's the next
[1:11:57] love life comes the same elements come
[1:11:59] out of Christ as what we go through to
[1:12:01] get back into his body what was the
[1:12:03] first thing that come they speared aside
[1:12:05] and water came forth and blood came
[1:12:06] forth and then into thy hands I commend
[1:12:08] my spirit his Spirit came forth he says
[1:12:10] 1 John 5:7 said there are three that
[1:12:12] bear record in heaven the father and the
[1:12:15] word which is the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:16] these three are one he says but there's
[1:12:19] three that bear record in Earth the
[1:12:22] water the blood and the spirit they're
[1:12:24] not one but they excuse me agree in one
[1:12:27] he says you can't have the father
[1:12:28] without having the son you can't have
[1:12:30] the son without having the Holy Ghost
[1:12:32] but you can be justified without being
[1:12:34] Sanctified and you can be Sanctified
[1:12:36] without having the Holy Ghost but when
[1:12:38] it's finished both justification and
[1:12:41] sanctification the Seal of the Lord
[1:12:43] Jesus Christ by the baptism is put upon
[1:12:46] you that's a sign of his work of his
[1:12:50] acceptance of his
[1:12:52] approval and it's a sign that you're
[1:12:54] going to make it all the way it's a sign
[1:12:57] of where you come from and it's a sign
[1:12:59] of where you're going and it's a sign of
[1:13:01] who you
[1:13:02] are and what family you belong to and
[1:13:05] then there's an examination of your soul
[1:13:07] that happens here and that's where God's
[1:13:08] working that's where God cares about God
[1:13:12] cares about our soul more than anything
[1:13:14] how many times would brother B say a
[1:13:15] soul is worth 10,000
[1:13:17] worlds that's the only Eternal part of
[1:13:20] us is our soul cuz our spirit comes into
[1:13:24] our body and then it goes out of our
[1:13:25] body our soul is the thing that that God
[1:13:28] cares about amen our physical bodies
[1:13:30] he's he's not nearly so worried about he
[1:13:32] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:13:34] infirmities we know but his focus is on
[1:13:36] the Eternal portion cuz that's the part
[1:13:39] that came from him and that's the part
[1:13:41] that's going back to him over on the
[1:13:43] other side I've got a new name and I've
[1:13:44] got a new body but I've got the exact
[1:13:46] same soul I have here it's the only
[1:13:48] thing that carries over but in John he
[1:13:50] would say beloved I wish above all
[1:13:52] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[1:13:54] in health even as thy Soul prospered
[1:13:58] that means that the Soul's prospering is
[1:14:00] the greatest thing in the eyes of
[1:14:02] God brother Eugene Brun there's one of
[1:14:04] his things that that he taught that is
[1:14:05] stuck with me through all of my life and
[1:14:08] he said that agape love God's love is
[1:14:10] based on spiritual growth it's not based
[1:14:13] on physical benefits it's not based on
[1:14:16] natural blessings it's based on
[1:14:18] spiritual growth it's based on your soul
[1:14:20] prospering brother says I was passing by
[1:14:23] Museum not long here not long ago and
[1:14:25] they had a picture of a man's body in
[1:14:27] there that weighed 150 lb and said he
[1:14:29] was worth 84 cents in
[1:14:31] chemicals he said put a $100 suit on 84
[1:14:35] so it's about a you can you can multiply
[1:14:38] that by $100 today so $1,000 suit on a
[1:14:41] on a you know a
[1:14:44] $84 body if we put in today's money he
[1:14:47] says walk around with your nose up in
[1:14:49] the air like it had rained it would
[1:14:50] drown you thinking you're somebody he
[1:14:52] says you're not worth but 84 cents if
[1:14:54] you weigh 150 lb and you'll wrap a $500
[1:14:57] mink coat around 84 and won't even speak
[1:14:59] to your neighbor that's right he saying
[1:15:01] we put so much emphasis on
[1:15:03] this he says that's the ma what's the
[1:15:06] matter with the world today people are
[1:15:08] stuck up and
[1:15:12] starchy I I was listening this morning
[1:15:14] to again God in Simplicity and he's
[1:15:17] talking to he said a young
[1:15:19] man said you know I was enjoying your
[1:15:22] message brother Bram
[1:15:24] until they started shouting and they
[1:15:27] started
[1:15:30] screaming he said brother brah said you
[1:15:32] don't believe in that he said no he said
[1:15:34] it put chills up and down my back
[1:15:35] brother Braham said if they didn't do it
[1:15:37] it would have put chills up and down my
[1:15:39] back he said that man was a baseball
[1:15:41] fanatic and he said hey what was going
[1:15:43] on the other night there over in the
[1:15:44] stadium the guy said oh you should have
[1:15:46] heard should have seen it and this was
[1:15:47] this and this and that and this one was
[1:15:48] on the base is loaded and and he said
[1:15:51] cuz he called brother BR a fanatic and
[1:15:52] brother br said see you identify with
[1:15:55] that I identify with this he says but
[1:15:57] people become stuck what stuck up and
[1:16:01] starchy to where they can't even enjoy
[1:16:03] the presence of the
[1:16:05] Lord he says God will have to pour out
[1:16:08] the Holy Spirit and Wilt that thing down
[1:16:11] in you he says every one of us we're
[1:16:14] just exactly on the same level that
[1:16:17] means I'm no better than you and you're
[1:16:19] no better than me no matter what no
[1:16:23] matter
[1:16:24] what if the prophet of God were standing
[1:16:26] here he's on the same level as you and I
[1:16:29] he's just Fallen
[1:16:31] flesh he says God made us all out of one
[1:16:34] pattern no matter if you live in a
[1:16:36] better neighborhood go to a better
[1:16:37] Church you're nothing but what God's
[1:16:39] made you and who are you to Glory he
[1:16:41] said Glory comes to God yes sir a couple
[1:16:43] boys standing there one looked and said
[1:16:45] well John we're not worth very much are
[1:16:46] we I said look fella that's your body
[1:16:50] but you got a soul that's worth 10,000
[1:16:52] worlds
[1:16:53] that's right I said that body will go
[1:16:55] back to the dust some of these days but
[1:16:57] you got a soul that will live forever
[1:17:00] take care of that he says look at the
[1:17:03] value that Jesus Christ put on it to
[1:17:05] come down from Glory To Die to redeem
[1:17:07] you he says that's the
[1:17:11] trouble when he says that's trouble we
[1:17:14] ought to listen he says we look at the
[1:17:16] outside and take care of the outside but
[1:17:19] the inside we let it
[1:17:21] go it's a wonderful thing when God
[1:17:23] blesses Our Lives I I thank the Lord
[1:17:26] every day that I've got a house I've got
[1:17:29] a roof over my head I got vehicles to
[1:17:31] drive I've got clothes to wear I've got
[1:17:33] food on the table I've got money in the
[1:17:35] bank I thank God for those
[1:17:37] things scripture says I've never seen
[1:17:40] the righteous forsaken nor SE begging
[1:17:41] bread but I read this morning brother BR
[1:17:44] says man calls Prosperity sometimes
[1:17:49] religion in other words we turn our
[1:17:52] natural blessing blessings into our
[1:17:54] spiritual
[1:17:56] walk what we have and our provision
[1:18:00] becomes our religion and our
[1:18:02] relationship with
[1:18:04] God that's not what he cares about most
[1:18:07] he cares about what's in here he cares
[1:18:10] is the soul prospering and what brother
[1:18:12] bram's saying is we're looking at the
[1:18:14] outside and when the outside Prosper we
[1:18:16] say that means the inside must be
[1:18:18] prospering well if that goes then most a
[1:18:20] bunch of the world is prospering in
[1:18:21] their souls too because they've got as
[1:18:23] much and more than we do so the outside
[1:18:26] that we have is it can be a reflection
[1:18:29] but it's not necessarily a reflection
[1:18:31] brother R said man calls Prosperity
[1:18:33] sometimes
[1:18:34] religion we've exchanged the blessings
[1:18:37] of the outside for what ought to be
[1:18:39] happening on the inside he's saying we
[1:18:40] ought to be focused on what's happening
[1:18:42] in here for the change here for the
[1:18:44] blessing in
[1:18:45] here for the nature of Christ inside of
[1:18:48] our body amen these bodies are our
[1:18:50] greatest failures they're going to fail
[1:18:52] you know in science today they Health
[1:18:54] Science they say that the way how long
[1:18:57] you live is mostly genetics there are
[1:18:59] people that can smoke three packs of
[1:19:01] cigarettes a day and live till they're
[1:19:02] 90 and never get a stitch of cancer
[1:19:04] there are people that eat right and work
[1:19:05] out in the gym every day and they die
[1:19:07] with cancer at 55 why these bodies are
[1:19:10] built to fail it's a lottery Naturally
[1:19:13] Speaking there's nothing here that we
[1:19:15] should be focused on Amen but what I'm
[1:19:18] saying all of this is to ask what do our
[1:19:20] requests look like when we pray then
[1:19:24] is it focused on our
[1:19:25] bills on our vehicles on our houses on
[1:19:28] our cars on our jobs and our careers or
[1:19:31] is it focused on the
[1:19:32] soul because this is the thing he really
[1:19:34] cares about because if this is right
[1:19:37] everything else will go right right
[1:19:39] where it needs to be if this is right it
[1:19:42] flows out and it produces Christ in
[1:19:44] every aspect of our
[1:19:46] life remember what Jesus said to the
[1:19:49] disciples CU I'm saying as our prayer
[1:19:51] time spent more about the physical or
[1:19:54] the
[1:19:55] spiritual Jesus said take therefore no
[1:19:58] thought saying what shall we eat what
[1:20:00] shall we drink or what shall we where
[1:20:02] with shall we be clothed he says for all
[1:20:04] these things do the Gentiles seek we're
[1:20:08] Gentiles he says for your heavenly
[1:20:10] father knoweth that ye have need of all
[1:20:12] these things that's our rest right there
[1:20:14] he knows what we
[1:20:16] need he knows what we need and he's a
[1:20:19] good good father and so he gives us what
[1:20:22] we have need
[1:20:23] but he's more concerned about this than
[1:20:25] anything else so he's going to work to
[1:20:27] make sure we get what we need here above
[1:20:29] and beyond everything else that we have
[1:20:32] he says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:20:34] God and all his and his righteousness he
[1:20:37] says and then all these things will be
[1:20:38] added unto you you'll get the kingdom of
[1:20:40] God that's the holy ghost seek the holy
[1:20:45] ghost seek that in your soul and
[1:20:48] everything else that you have need of he
[1:20:50] says he'll give it to you he says says
[1:20:52] take therefore no thought for to for the
[1:20:54] moral for the moral shall take thought
[1:20:56] for the things of itself sufficient unto
[1:20:58] the day is the evil
[1:21:00] thereof what's coming is
[1:21:03] coming what's going to happen is going
[1:21:05] to happen we can't change it anymore
[1:21:07] than than we can change who we are he's
[1:21:11] saying don't worry about it seek after
[1:21:13] the things of God and God will take care
[1:21:15] of tomorrow God will take care of today
[1:21:17] God take care of everything that's in
[1:21:19] your
[1:21:21] future I've had a lot of trouble falling
[1:21:23] asleep the last few days and Sunday
[1:21:25] night especially and I was praying on
[1:21:27] some things and you know as I'm studying
[1:21:29] these things and you get deep into
[1:21:32] things and you start to see more and
[1:21:34] more into the heart of things I'll tell
[1:21:35] you it exposes things in your
[1:21:39] life and you say there's a lot more for
[1:21:44] my
[1:21:45] life there's a lot more in this word
[1:21:47] than I've got in my life right now and
[1:21:50] I'll tell you when you can't sleep start
[1:21:52] talking to God about the things you're
[1:21:54] seeing in your life one it'll humble
[1:21:57] you two it'll realign your heart with
[1:22:01] what God has for
[1:22:04] you you know it's it's easy to pray
[1:22:07] about the
[1:22:09] natural but when we come to the soul
[1:22:12] realm you get into the word of God it's
[1:22:14] impossible to see not to see that
[1:22:16] there's room for
[1:22:18] growth you can't look at it and not see
[1:22:20] it I mean I've just preached on the of a
[1:22:23] perfect man and half of it I feel like I
[1:22:25] don't have it's not that I don't have it
[1:22:27] it's that the deeper you get into these
[1:22:29] things the more you see the depth that
[1:22:31] there is to it and the greater revealing
[1:22:32] of it that is supposed to be coming
[1:22:34] through our lives and you say Lord take
[1:22:36] me
[1:22:38] higher and that means more of me has to
[1:22:41] die out every day and there's got to be
[1:22:43] a victory over this every single day and
[1:22:47] this drives us crazy this is our
[1:22:50] greatest enemy this is our greatest
[1:22:52] enemy and so I'm laying there and I'm
[1:22:53] praying Lord I see that there's so much
[1:22:56] more for
[1:22:57] me help me to seek
[1:23:01] that and not everything else help me to
[1:23:04] focus on those things in my life man
[1:23:07] remember uh Peter said if you do these
[1:23:09] things he says there comes a diligence
[1:23:11] with it because a revelation of our
[1:23:14] shortcomings ought to bring a diligence
[1:23:16] to ask God for
[1:23:17] it because it's not up to me to produce
[1:23:20] it it's up to me to ask the diligence is
[1:23:24] in the
[1:23:25] asking like that the remember the unjust
[1:23:28] judge and that woman that came and just
[1:23:29] kept knocking on his door day in and day
[1:23:32] night and that is a diligent woman and
[1:23:35] we ought to be the same way with our
[1:23:37] father say Lord you put it in me to do
[1:23:39] this now help me to do
[1:23:41] it because what happens we get into
[1:23:43] these these little moments you know we
[1:23:45] get into these little situations and
[1:23:47] what happens is we look in the word and
[1:23:49] we see what we ought to do and then we
[1:23:51] look at our life and we see see what we
[1:23:52] did and we see a gap
[1:23:55] there and it's God showing us there's
[1:23:57] more to be
[1:23:59] had you pass one test we just did a
[1:24:01] harder test and you fail that means
[1:24:03] there's room for growth here and so we
[1:24:06] get down on our knees or wherever
[1:24:07] whatever we do to pray and we say Lord
[1:24:09] give that to me help me to come up
[1:24:12] higher help me to die out a little
[1:24:15] more it's our job to be diligent to ask
[1:24:17] remember what the scripture says I think
[1:24:19] it's in James he says you have not
[1:24:20] because you ask not and then what you do
[1:24:22] ask you ask a Miss because you're drawn
[1:24:24] aside by your lusts what natural rather
[1:24:27] than
[1:24:28] spiritual our focus is on the things of
[1:24:31] life rather than life itself to come
[1:24:32] forth through
[1:24:34] us anden as I read the word of God as I
[1:24:37] hear the message and I go through these
[1:24:38] things what is it doing it's revealing
[1:24:40] God to me it's revealing the word to me
[1:24:42] in every aspect of it the promises the
[1:24:47] blessings the impact the fruits the
[1:24:51] experience all all of it is coming out
[1:24:53] as you're reading
[1:24:54] it and then you come up to a situation
[1:24:57] and you say Lord I need some of what I'm
[1:24:58] reading about I need more of what I'm
[1:25:01] reading about don't let me stay in this
[1:25:04] condition Church we're going in a
[1:25:06] Rapture
[1:25:07] someday and brother random would say
[1:25:09] time and time again it's later than you
[1:25:12] think where's the Cry of our
[1:25:16] heart what are we
[1:25:19] seeking is it a soul desire or is it a
[1:25:23] fleshly
[1:25:24] desire what's taking up our prayers
[1:25:26] these
[1:25:28] days is it Soul condition or is it just
[1:25:32] the everyday listen we're here and we
[1:25:35] trust everything to
[1:25:37] God the money in our bank our health the
[1:25:40] house whatever it is we trust it all to
[1:25:43] God but seek first the
[1:25:46] kingdom make sure that's sealed and then
[1:25:48] when it's sealed let's let what's in it
[1:25:50] come out through our lives and say Lord
[1:25:52] let that be the greatest aspect that of
[1:25:54] my testimony is that they can see you
[1:25:56] and me not just my finances or my home
[1:26:00] or these different
[1:26:02] things you know my kids ought to be able
[1:26:04] to look at me and see what they can
[1:26:06] do cuz they're
[1:26:08] me my daughter is half me and she's half
[1:26:11] my wife so Blanca can do it Selena ought
[1:26:14] to be able to do it and if I can do it
[1:26:17] Jonathan ought to be able to do
[1:26:19] it how do they know what they can do
[1:26:21] they see mommy and daddy do it how do we
[1:26:23] know what we can do the word shows us
[1:26:26] the word says this is for you this is
[1:26:29] you these are the attributes this is the
[1:26:32] nature this is the power this is the
[1:26:33] authority this is the position of the
[1:26:35] believer and we've seen it in Christ's
[1:26:38] life we've seen it around us we can look
[1:26:40] especially at our elders and see what
[1:26:42] the word of God can do in our life when
[1:26:44] it's sealed by the holy
[1:26:46] spirit that gives us hope God bless our
[1:26:50] older ones for the life that they live
[1:26:52] so we can see you can live a life above
[1:26:55] reproach that you can live above this
[1:26:57] world that you can stay aside from it
[1:26:59] and not be messed up and dirtied up by
[1:27:01] the things that this world tries to
[1:27:03] throw at us God bless you for it but
[1:27:05] we've got to look at what the
[1:27:08] word my kids look at me Jonathan thinks
[1:27:12] if I can do it then he can do
[1:27:13] it funny thing with him is that he
[1:27:15] thinks if I can do it he can do it
[1:27:17] better that's even that's a I love that
[1:27:20] attitude cuz I I believe I firmly
[1:27:23] believe that when I marry my wife we
[1:27:24] combine two things and two of those
[1:27:26] together make something greater than
[1:27:27] just me and greater than just her so I
[1:27:30] believe that all of my children have an
[1:27:31] opportunity to be greater than I am in
[1:27:34] whatever we call
[1:27:35] greatness because they've got the best
[1:27:37] to both of us I
[1:27:39] believe but we look at the
[1:27:41] word that's how we know what's
[1:27:45] possible that's how we know what's
[1:27:48] required that's how we know what's
[1:27:51] available
[1:27:53] but if we're not looking at the word how
[1:27:55] do you know what's in you how do you
[1:27:57] know what's available to
[1:27:59] you how do you know where the promises
[1:28:01] are if you don't read the promises if we
[1:28:03] want to be like Christ we've got to look
[1:28:05] at
[1:28:06] Christ I guarantee you
[1:28:08] listen chances are that one of my boys
[1:28:12] will be an engineer why because Daddy's
[1:28:14] an
[1:28:16] engineer chances are Levi is going to do
[1:28:19] something similar to Matt and one of
[1:28:20] Joe's boys or maybe daughter will go in
[1:28:22] his footsteps why they see what's
[1:28:25] possible and they admire it and that's
[1:28:29] what's supposed to be happening as we
[1:28:30] look at the word is we say this is me I
[1:28:33] come from this this is built into me
[1:28:35] this is a part of me and as we read it
[1:28:38] it starts to what show us what's
[1:28:40] possible because we've got to follow the
[1:28:42] same trajectory of all of those real
[1:28:44] Believers in the scripture we've got to
[1:28:45] follow the same trajectory as Christ to
[1:28:48] recognize who we are step into it and
[1:28:51] see the manifestation of the word in our
[1:28:53] life but how are we going to see it if
[1:28:55] we don't first see it you got to have a
[1:28:58] template there you got to have an image
[1:28:59] in front of you amen we've seen the word
[1:29:01] made flesh we've seen it in Christ and
[1:29:03] we've seen it come down again in a
[1:29:05] prophet and he was a first fruit he was
[1:29:07] a sheath offering before us to show us
[1:29:09] what happens when the word gets inside
[1:29:11] of you and the way it's meant to be in
[1:29:12] this age in the Omega Church age we've
[1:29:15] seen what happens and we become the word
[1:29:18] by looking at the word we become the
[1:29:20] word by feeding on the word be we become
[1:29:22] the word by dwelling in the presence of
[1:29:23] the
[1:29:25] word and it does a work inside of us
[1:29:29] amen Paul put it this way he said but we
[1:29:32] all with open face as in a GL beholding
[1:29:35] as in a glass the glory of the Lord a
[1:29:38] glass of mirror he says are changed into
[1:29:40] the same image from glory to glory even
[1:29:43] as by the spirit of the Lord the
[1:29:45] Amplified says and we all with unveiled
[1:29:48] face most of us have never worn a veil
[1:29:52] men
[1:29:55] especially but if you've ever you know
[1:29:58] hidden in the curtains from your
[1:30:01] siblings or something and they're the
[1:30:03] really thin sheer ones you can see
[1:30:05] through but you can't see all the
[1:30:06] details and you're just looking for
[1:30:07] shape or you're listening for sound so
[1:30:09] you can jump out and scare them but when
[1:30:12] you put a veil on you can't see
[1:30:14] perfectly you can see okay but you can't
[1:30:18] see the way you're supposed to and Paul
[1:30:20] says when we look at the word
[1:30:22] we don't have a veil in front of us it's
[1:30:25] completely open before us he says
[1:30:28] continually seeing as in a in a mirror
[1:30:31] the glory of the Lord we look at the
[1:30:33] mirror and we see him he says and when
[1:30:37] we do that we are progressively being
[1:30:39] transformed into his image from one
[1:30:42] degree of Glory to to even more Glory he
[1:30:45] says which comes from the Lord who is
[1:30:47] the spirit you want to become like God
[1:30:50] you got to look at God you want to
[1:30:52] become the word you got to look at the
[1:30:53] word and then what happens is you start
[1:30:55] comparing what the word is and where
[1:30:57] you're at and you see the
[1:31:00] Gap and all of a sudden you realize
[1:31:02] there's a need for a
[1:31:03] change cuz you're here and the word's
[1:31:05] here and you say Lord we got to do
[1:31:07] something about this cuz your word says
[1:31:09] I'm this but I can't lie I I feel like
[1:31:12] I'm here and what happens then is
[1:31:15] because we are children of God the
[1:31:17] spirit of God is on us and we go and we
[1:31:19] say
[1:31:20] Daddy Aba
[1:31:23] father I'm your
[1:31:25] child this is your program this is your
[1:31:29] life this is your word and I'm a part of
[1:31:31] it so I'm coming to you diligently
[1:31:34] seeking you to say make me what you said
[1:31:36] I
[1:31:37] am again the diligence for us is to ask
[1:31:41] and to surrender and it's up to him to
[1:31:43] do the work cuz we can't do it we can't
[1:31:47] do it in and of oursel what is it it's
[1:31:49] God shaking my life he's showing me what
[1:31:51] he
[1:31:53] is and then he's letting me see who I
[1:31:56] am and it's not to put us down it's to
[1:31:59] raise us
[1:32:01] up it's to raise us up now guess what
[1:32:05] sometimes he shows me him through
[1:32:07] somebody
[1:32:08] else there are people I admire just for
[1:32:11] the the nature they have the
[1:32:12] characteristics they have and I say Lord
[1:32:14] make me more like them cuz that's you
[1:32:16] and
[1:32:17] them but sometimes I got to go straight
[1:32:20] to the word but regardless what he's
[1:32:22] doing is he's showing us himself and
[1:32:24] saying be like me come up a little
[1:32:27] higher step out a little further die out
[1:32:31] a little more surrender a little
[1:32:34] more remember what he said I just quoted
[1:32:36] it in Galatians 4 he said and because
[1:32:39] you are
[1:32:40] Sons
[1:32:42] because you don't get the spirit because
[1:32:44] you asked you get it because you are
[1:32:47] Sons because you're children because you
[1:32:49] are Sons God has sent forth the spirit
[1:32:51] of his son into your hearts cried Abba
[1:32:54] Father other people don't cry out to God
[1:32:57] this way why cuz he ain't their
[1:32:59] dad cuz there's nothing in them but we
[1:33:02] got something in us and my what I'm
[1:33:04] asking you is what is it that you're
[1:33:05] crying out
[1:33:07] for Is It
[1:33:10] soul or is it Spirit or is it
[1:33:14] body because he'll let anything happen
[1:33:16] in spirit and body to get to your soul
[1:33:19] brother B said he'll lay you flat on
[1:33:20] your back
[1:33:22] he'll take you down to the bottom he'll
[1:33:25] strip everything away from you to get
[1:33:26] your soul and then once that's taken
[1:33:29] care of then he'll add back everything
[1:33:30] that you have need of but the soul is
[1:33:32] what he's coming after brother Brown
[1:33:34] puts it this way he says if you repented
[1:33:36] and are baptized then God's under
[1:33:40] obligation he says if your faith is
[1:33:42] right towards God to give you the Holy
[1:33:44] Ghost the minute that you obey his word
[1:33:47] he says believe that God will vindicate
[1:33:49] it to you if your hearts really right
[1:33:51] before God and you're taught right and
[1:33:55] believing it and walk up there with
[1:33:58] assur with the Assurance something's
[1:34:01] going to happen that's a reflection of
[1:34:04] your
[1:34:04] faith you go up in faith asking and that
[1:34:08] Faith get allows you to receive what
[1:34:10] he's got for you he said because God's
[1:34:12] more willing to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:34:14] than you are willing to accept it God's
[1:34:16] trying to press in but he's a
[1:34:19] gentleman he won't come in unless you
[1:34:22] ask but he says he's more willing to
[1:34:24] give it than you are to accept it God
[1:34:26] wants to heal you more than you want
[1:34:28] healing God wants to deliver you more
[1:34:29] than you want
[1:34:30] Deliverance he says but you got to go up
[1:34:32] with a faith that something's going to
[1:34:34] happen he says I don't believe there's
[1:34:37] any man or woman in any of the groups
[1:34:39] could ever face Jesus Christ and truly
[1:34:42] repent of their sins with a true full
[1:34:45] surrendered heart saying Lord I truly
[1:34:49] believe but what God would place on them
[1:34:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost right at
[1:34:53] that time I literally read today brother
[1:34:55] Bram says you don't have to T and T and
[1:34:59] T and
[1:35:02] T and he he reads that that scripture
[1:35:04] that I quoted earlier where Peter where
[1:35:06] it says that pet while Peter yet spake
[1:35:08] these words the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:35:10] that heard the words he says you don't
[1:35:12] have to T and T and T meaning you don't
[1:35:15] have to expect to
[1:35:17] wait but you T until you get it you stay
[1:35:20] until you got got it cuz that's the
[1:35:23] guarantee that you're going to make it
[1:35:24] to the other side but he says that's not
[1:35:26] a requirement for you to T it doesn't
[1:35:28] have to take forever you go you come in
[1:35:32] truly repenting truly surrendered he
[1:35:34] says truly repent that means you've
[1:35:36] changed your ways you can't say I
[1:35:39] repented and you're still doing what you
[1:35:40] are doing and then he says a true full
[1:35:43] surrendered heart that means you've died
[1:35:45] to
[1:35:46] yourself you've changed your ways and
[1:35:48] you've died to yourself acts 238 says
[1:35:52] repent and be baptized it starts with
[1:35:55] repentance and you know I I think
[1:35:57] sometimes as Believers we think that
[1:35:59] repentance was back then and we forget
[1:36:01] that it's an all the way through
[1:36:03] situation remember we talked about in
[1:36:05] the last couple of services in
[1:36:06] Revelation
[1:36:07] 3 that there's a zealous repentance
[1:36:09] that's required for Leo
[1:36:11] deia why because as the word is revealed
[1:36:15] glory is revealed to us we see the error
[1:36:18] of our ways we see the shortness of our
[1:36:20] life and we repent we repent because
[1:36:23] we've walked in ignorance and now we've
[1:36:25] got knowledge and we say Lord I'm sorry
[1:36:27] I was doing wrong in our ignorance
[1:36:29] nonetheless we still repent for that and
[1:36:32] if we don't see the error we'll never
[1:36:33] see the need for Change and if we never
[1:36:35] see the Need For Change we'll never
[1:36:36] repent but if we're being changed that
[1:36:39] automatically means that repentance is a
[1:36:40] part of our
[1:36:42] life because it means we were wrong and
[1:36:44] now we need to be made
[1:36:46] right it's a zealous thing it's a
[1:36:48] constant thing it's a it's an all the
[1:36:50] time thing brother B I just just read
[1:36:51] the quote to somebody the other day he
[1:36:53] said we backslide every
[1:36:55] day backslide every day listen to this
[1:36:58] one he says we are tempted all of us are
[1:37:01] tempted all of us sin there's none
[1:37:04] without sin every day we
[1:37:08] sin oh that's people that don't have the
[1:37:10] Holy Ghost no that's people with the
[1:37:11] Holy
[1:37:12] Ghost Paul said he had to Die daily he
[1:37:16] says and if we say we have no sin then
[1:37:18] the Bible said we make God to lie and we
[1:37:20] could not do that he said so we sin
[1:37:22] daily and it's Grace God's grace that
[1:37:24] saves us and as we confess our wrongs
[1:37:27] God is just to forgive
[1:37:29] them repentance is an everyday
[1:37:33] thing he said in your confession as long
[1:37:36] as it holds Good your salvation is
[1:37:39] perfect and then he says it's the same
[1:37:41] it is with Divine Healing it's your
[1:37:43] personal
[1:37:45] faith in a resurrected
[1:37:47] Lord when people tell me brother John
[1:37:50] I've repented Brother John I've been
[1:37:51] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:52] Christ and I don't have the Holy Ghost I
[1:37:54] say something's wrong
[1:37:57] then cuz if you done what he
[1:37:59] required then he's got to do what he
[1:38:01] said he'd do brother Braham said if
[1:38:03] anybody comes to God on the same basis
[1:38:05] as somebody else did they get the same
[1:38:07] results so if you say I've done
[1:38:09] everything I'm supposed to and I don't
[1:38:10] have the Holy Ghost then I say you
[1:38:12] haven't done what you said you did you
[1:38:14] might think you did but you haven't done
[1:38:16] it all the way you may not have repented
[1:38:19] right or you you may not have died out
[1:38:22] cuz remember baptism is symbolic of a
[1:38:24] dying out and when you do the baptism
[1:38:27] you think well that's it no no no you
[1:38:28] got to die out you got to die out not
[1:38:31] just get baptized you got to do what the
[1:38:33] baptism actually says you're doing die
[1:38:35] out rise a new creature a new nature a
[1:38:39] new spirit these different things amen
[1:38:42] why because the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:44] Ghost is the Seal of God that
[1:38:46] confirms that you come his way that
[1:38:49] you're in the condition that he requires
[1:38:51] so if you don't have it it's only
[1:38:53] because you haven't asked for it or
[1:38:55] you're not in the right condition to
[1:38:56] receive it there's only two reasons it's
[1:38:59] not cuz God holds it back for
[1:39:01] fun remember God wants to give it to you
[1:39:03] more than you want it so it's not God
[1:39:05] holding it back it's something in our
[1:39:07] lives that would hold it
[1:39:08] back but he also says you notice here he
[1:39:11] says it's your faith your personal faith
[1:39:13] you got to believe it's for you you got
[1:39:15] to believe it's for you you got to
[1:39:17] believe that it's not just for the
[1:39:18] person next to you but I I
[1:39:22] am supposed to get the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:24] then you go looking for
[1:39:26] it brother says and today when we say
[1:39:30] that we believe we can believe in a
[1:39:32] measure but when God gives us the
[1:39:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost he confirms
[1:39:36] our faith and seals
[1:39:39] us he says the Holy Ghost is the
[1:39:41] confirmation of your faith in God God
[1:39:44] has confirmed it and recognized it so
[1:39:47] and put the seal of approval on you he
[1:39:49] says that's what we want isn't it that's
[1:39:51] what the church needs he says that's
[1:39:53] what makes you
[1:39:56] alive he says in the way God is
[1:39:58] expecting us as an individual to
[1:40:01] grow he says it's the way he has brought
[1:40:04] his church in to grow Peter here says
[1:40:06] first seven things Faith virtue say he
[1:40:09] says seek Him Up knowledge Temperance
[1:40:11] patience godliness brotherly love and
[1:40:13] brotherly kindness and then the love of
[1:40:15] God he says the Holy Ghost Christ in the
[1:40:18] person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[1:40:20] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:22] and you've got all these virtues sealed
[1:40:24] in you then God lives in a tabernacle
[1:40:27] called the building the living
[1:40:29] Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling
[1:40:32] Place he says when a man possesses these
[1:40:34] kinds of things then the Holy Ghost
[1:40:37] comes upon him no matter you might speak
[1:40:39] with tongues you might impersonate any
[1:40:40] gift God has got you might do that but
[1:40:43] until these virtues here go into you
[1:40:45] you're still off the real true
[1:40:47] foundation of Faith but when those
[1:40:49] virtues grow in and you've added that to
[1:40:51] that he says then you're a living
[1:40:53] Monument you're a living moving Idol and
[1:40:57] I've read this quote before he says but
[1:40:59] when we not in an imaginary way but
[1:41:02] prostrate ourselves before a living God
[1:41:06] what happens
[1:41:08] life he says a living
[1:41:11] virtue a living knowledge a living
[1:41:15] patience a living godliness a living
[1:41:18] power coming from a living God makes a
[1:41:21] living man a Living Image in the stature
[1:41:24] of God you know what that tells me
[1:41:26] Church life is what
[1:41:30] matters brother Ram would say it time
[1:41:32] and time again by their fruits you shall
[1:41:35] know them what kind of a life are you
[1:41:38] living not just Doctrine you got to have
[1:41:41] right Doctrine not just right Ministry
[1:41:44] you got to have the right Ministry but
[1:41:46] your life has to be
[1:41:49] Christ that's what he's looking for this
[1:41:52] whole series I'm manifesting time is do
[1:41:55] you have the Life of Christ in
[1:41:58] you that's the only thing that
[1:42:00] matters it's the only thing he's looking
[1:42:03] for he says what's he doing this living
[1:42:06] man he says the same things that Jesus
[1:42:08] did walking the same way he walked doing
[1:42:11] the same things he did because it's not
[1:42:13] an imaginary thing there's a reality
[1:42:16] that proves
[1:42:17] it now let me say this
[1:42:21] we mature we grow you'll have a reality
[1:42:25] as a
[1:42:26] teenager that will grow into the reality
[1:42:29] as a someone in their 20s and 30s and as
[1:42:32] you go through marriage and family and
[1:42:34] all these different things your reality
[1:42:36] grows absolutely it does the things that
[1:42:39] God has done for my life now versus what
[1:42:41] he did back then completely different
[1:42:44] different ways different measures
[1:42:46] different
[1:42:48] expectations God has a higher stand
[1:42:50] standard for my life now than he did
[1:42:52] when I was
[1:42:53] 20 but God has revealed himself in a
[1:42:55] greater way now than one he has when I
[1:42:58] was 20 everything's growing everything's
[1:43:01] moving because we're going into a
[1:43:03] Rapture Ready condition we've got to be
[1:43:06] growing he says there's a reality that
[1:43:08] proves it he says now that is the house
[1:43:11] that God dwells in not a building with a
[1:43:14] big Bell on on top of it in a high
[1:43:16] steeple sea but a body hast thou
[1:43:18] prepared me a body that God can dwell in
[1:43:21] God can walk in God can see in God can
[1:43:25] talk in God can work in now see we're
[1:43:29] talking about things that are outside
[1:43:30] the soul now but what happens is when he
[1:43:33] sealed the soul now he starts working on
[1:43:35] everything else in a greater way to
[1:43:37] where you are Christ
[1:43:39] embodied he says amen the living
[1:43:43] instrumentality of God God walking on
[1:43:47] two feet in
[1:43:49] you
[1:43:54] if I said who in here is God walking on
[1:43:57] two
[1:43:58] feet what would you
[1:44:02] say brother Gerald would you raise your
[1:44:04] hand and say you're God walking in two
[1:44:06] feet he raised his
[1:44:12] hand it's God in Simplicity
[1:44:19] Church you you got to have that same
[1:44:22] Revelation not that you are what you
[1:44:24] ought to
[1:44:26] be but you've been
[1:44:28] changed you've been
[1:44:31] reborn and the life you live is not your
[1:44:33] life but it's Christ in
[1:44:37] you not that you would rest on where
[1:44:41] you're
[1:44:42] at but you rest on the finished work
[1:44:45] that's making you grow and mature into
[1:44:48] the fullness of an adopted son and
[1:44:50] daughter in Christ
[1:44:57] Christ
[1:44:58] wow God walking on two feet in you if
[1:45:05] you've got the holy ghost in your life
[1:45:07] in your soul you can put your name in
[1:45:11] that
[1:45:12] quote if Paul can say it as a holy ghost
[1:45:16] filled believer than anyone else in the
[1:45:19] same condition can put their name there
[1:45:21] as well the life that I live I live by
[1:45:25] the faith in the son of Jesus in the in
[1:45:28] Jesus
[1:45:28] Christ is Christ in you the hope of
[1:45:33] glory yeah our Epistles seen and read of
[1:45:36] all men the word made flesh we've got to
[1:45:40] be able to say
[1:45:44] it you know why we
[1:45:48] don't because we're not looking in the
[1:45:49] mirror
[1:45:52] we're not looking in the word as much as
[1:45:53] we ought to we're caught up with the
[1:45:57] challenges of life and the failures of
[1:45:59] life and the stresses of
[1:46:01] life and the kingdom of God has being
[1:46:03] put in second place in our
[1:46:06] minds and we forget who we
[1:46:11] are I like what somebody said a little
[1:46:13] while ago and I'll probably mess it up
[1:46:15] but they said you know
[1:46:17] Lord you know it's been a good day
[1:46:22] things have gone real well I haven't
[1:46:24] lost my
[1:46:25] temper haven't spoken ill of anyone good
[1:46:29] thoughts but I'm about to get out of bed
[1:46:33] now
[1:46:35] right help me
[1:46:39] Lord Church brother Braham said we're
[1:46:41] living below our
[1:46:44] privileges what the scripture say set
[1:46:46] your mind on things
[1:46:49] above
[1:46:51] where are we
[1:46:53] dwelling I say if you've got the Holy
[1:46:57] Ghost what's it
[1:47:01] doing because a sealed Soul has an
[1:47:03] effect on the rest of your
[1:47:05] life every single day you've got a
[1:47:09] victory that nobody else has you've got
[1:47:11] a source that nobody else
[1:47:14] has you got fruit that nobody else has
[1:47:18] you have a refuge that nobody else has
[1:47:20] has you have a healing you have a
[1:47:23] promise that nobody else has I'm talking
[1:47:26] in this world not not amongst Believers
[1:47:28] of course but you got something to
[1:47:32] that's in you you know we we we come to
[1:47:34] church and we talk about oh was a
[1:47:36] wonderful atmosphere you carry that
[1:47:39] atmosphere with you every single day if
[1:47:40] you'd only recognize
[1:47:42] it that you can have the same atmosphere
[1:47:46] you can cry you can shout you can be
[1:47:48] silent you can shake
[1:47:52] You Can
[1:47:53] Dance
[1:47:55] anywhere if that Holy Spirit is in your
[1:47:58] soul there is no limit to what it can do
[1:48:02] it's with you even in you to the end of
[1:48:06] the
[1:48:11] age you're a finished work in
[1:48:14] here now let that start working on the
[1:48:16] rest of your body on the rest of your
[1:48:19] spirit on the rest of your
[1:48:23] being that's where we're going to go
[1:48:24] over the next couple Services I think is
[1:48:26] what
[1:48:27] happens and the benefits and the effect
[1:48:32] of the indwelling of Christ in
[1:48:37] you he says God walking in two feet in
[1:48:43] you
[1:48:47] glory I don't think he said Glory That
[1:48:49] Way Church
[1:48:52] the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:48:54] ordered of the Lord God walking in
[1:48:59] you see remember what I said God in
[1:49:02] Simplicity you think it's not God
[1:49:04] walking in me but if you're walking in
[1:49:06] his light if you're walking in his will
[1:49:09] if you're walking in his plan it's
[1:49:12] Christ walking in
[1:49:13] you no
[1:49:17] difference he says for ye are written
[1:49:19] Epistles read of all men and if the life
[1:49:21] that's in Christ be in you you'll bear
[1:49:23] the life that Christ bore he says and
[1:49:25] now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in
[1:49:27] see and that brings the faith of Jesus
[1:49:30] Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the
[1:49:32] knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance
[1:49:34] of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus
[1:49:36] Christ the godliness of Jesus Jesus
[1:49:39] Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus
[1:49:41] Christ and the love of God which is
[1:49:43] Jesus Christ he's the head and controls
[1:49:46] you and your feet are the foundation
[1:49:48] Faith amen he says controlled by the
[1:49:49] head there you are there is the perfect
[1:49:52] man of God when he possesses these
[1:49:56] virtues and he's got someone in
[1:49:59] control he's got someone in the control
[1:50:01] tower what a
[1:50:03] picture what a
[1:50:05] position you don't just have attributes
[1:50:08] but you have Christ in those attributes
[1:50:11] you literally have Christ expressed as
[1:50:14] those attributes it's now a person not
[1:50:16] just an attribute it's a life not just a
[1:50:20] thing it's not just an emotion or a
[1:50:23] thought or a feeling or a conception but
[1:50:26] it's literally him working in every
[1:50:29] aspect of our life and the only thing
[1:50:31] he's looking for is people that'll
[1:50:32] surrender that's the greatest thing
[1:50:34] we've got to do church is surrender
[1:50:37] ourselves to him day in and day out and
[1:50:41] that comes with how we seek and what we
[1:50:44] seek that'll show you where your
[1:50:45] surrender
[1:50:48] is you know we look at
[1:50:51] that you know I I I've been reading the
[1:50:53] book of Acts again and you read what
[1:50:56] they do and you say
[1:50:59] Lord could it ever happen in my
[1:51:02] life but here's the thing if you're a
[1:51:05] woman you're not called to
[1:51:08] that not all our Apostles not all our
[1:51:11] ministers not all our men there are
[1:51:14] things that are reserved for certain
[1:51:15] things and it's not meant to be in your
[1:51:17] life but there are things that are meant
[1:51:19] to be in your life and that's what we'll
[1:51:21] get into as we get into adoption and
[1:51:22] these things is that we live normal
[1:51:24] lives most of us we're not
[1:51:28] special we don't have great Ministries
[1:51:30] most pastors don't have great Ministries
[1:51:33] they're simple men that are just feeding
[1:51:36] the
[1:51:38] flock then we're not all prophets we
[1:51:41] don't all have Global
[1:51:43] Ministries you know we've got mothers
[1:51:45] and we've got wives and guess what
[1:51:47] they're not out there spreading the
[1:51:49] gospel the way that min Ministry is
[1:51:51] they're not they're not walking around
[1:51:52] the globe the way that the prophet did
[1:51:55] they're not doing those things but yet
[1:51:57] you're supposed to display Christ and
[1:52:00] there's a life that you live and it's
[1:52:02] God in your own two feet walking through
[1:52:05] this world walking through this life and
[1:52:07] there's a way that we're supposed to
[1:52:09] live and brother Brandon would say it's
[1:52:10] in every type of Life there is you you
[1:52:13] you take whatever it is whether it's a a
[1:52:15] blue collar worker a white collar worker
[1:52:17] whether you're a mother at home whether
[1:52:18] you're in the office whatever it might
[1:52:20] be he says you're supposed to be true
[1:52:23] sons of God and Daughters of God in
[1:52:24] those roles and it'll separate you from
[1:52:26] everybody
[1:52:31] else I say are we
[1:52:33] close brother Braham said there's only
[1:52:36] one thing left and that's the going away
[1:52:37] of the
[1:52:38] church I think I said it earlier it's
[1:52:40] later than you
[1:52:42] think as I've been listening to this
[1:52:44] message on God and simplicity back home
[1:52:47] it just it strikes me and I know it's
[1:52:49] come through in some of these Services
[1:52:51] how that if we could only see what he's
[1:52:54] doing we'd have faith for what he's
[1:52:56] about to
[1:52:58] do because it's God in Simplicity it's
[1:53:01] never this great big thing it's the
[1:53:04] little things you know we we tend to
[1:53:05] ignore the little things but the little
[1:53:08] things are the Stepping Stones to the
[1:53:09] big things you know we want we want to I
[1:53:13] talking with a brother this week about
[1:53:15] this and and he listened to the service
[1:53:17] and he was kind of saying it really
[1:53:18] struck him how that that idea how you
[1:53:20] can't get to the perfection without the
[1:53:22] inart and what happens is we dis we
[1:53:25] dismiss the inart we dismiss the little
[1:53:27] things cuz we consider it
[1:53:30] insignificant but God's working in
[1:53:32] little things to do big
[1:53:35] things the little things add up and they
[1:53:37] become a big thing remember what Jesus
[1:53:41] said this the parable of the talents he
[1:53:43] said and so he that had received five
[1:53:44] talents came and brought other five
[1:53:46] talents saying Lord thou deliver to me
[1:53:48] five talents behold I've gained bes IDE
[1:53:50] them five talents more God gave him five
[1:53:52] and he got
[1:53:53] five his lord said unto him well done
[1:53:55] thou good and faithful servant thou Hast
[1:53:57] been Faithful over a few things I will
[1:53:59] make the ruler over many things enter
[1:54:02] thou into the joy of the Lord thy Lord
[1:54:06] what's he saying if you want to go to
[1:54:07] big things take care of the little
[1:54:09] things you want God in a big way then
[1:54:11] take care of God in the little way you
[1:54:13] you want God to bless you in amazing
[1:54:15] ways then take care of it in the little
[1:54:17] things he's given us cuz you can't go to
[1:54:19] unless you're proven in the
[1:54:21] small nobody makes a person a CEO that
[1:54:24] has no experience and nobody makes
[1:54:26] somebody CEO that comes straight out of
[1:54:27] school if they're in the right mind cuz
[1:54:30] what they've got to be proven in the
[1:54:31] small things before they can step in to
[1:54:33] the big things you know you think about
[1:54:34] our kids you know first thing is you can
[1:54:37] go out and you can start the car in the
[1:54:39] winter right we turn it into a
[1:54:41] treat and they can go out and they can
[1:54:43] start the car and they can turn the
[1:54:44] heater on you know maybe as they get
[1:54:46] older they then maybe we'll let them you
[1:54:49] know use this Scraper on it and they
[1:54:50] learn not to scratch the paint or do
[1:54:52] those different things and then maybe
[1:54:54] when they're 16 or 17 we'll allow them
[1:54:55] to move the car forward and backward a
[1:54:57] little bit as they prove them themselves
[1:54:59] in the small things we let them do the
[1:55:00] bigger things it's no different with
[1:55:03] God God does gives us a little thing God
[1:55:06] puts us in a little place of
[1:55:07] responsibility he gives us a little
[1:55:09] opportunity and he sees will we be
[1:55:10] faithful in
[1:55:12] it and then as we prove faithful then he
[1:55:14] raises us to the next level and he'll
[1:55:16] raise us as high as we're willing to go
[1:55:21] as much as we're willing to surrender as
[1:55:22] much as we're willing to obey as much as
[1:55:24] we're willing to do is how far he'll let
[1:55:26] us go and we're the limiter not God if
[1:55:29] we prove faithful amen he's got to prove
[1:55:31] us and as we come up to this idea of
[1:55:33] adoption and perhaps a well I don't know
[1:55:36] when it'll be at this rate but as we get
[1:55:39] to it we see it's a process of small
[1:55:41] steps leading up to big
[1:55:45] things Isaiah 28 as we start to close he
[1:55:47] says Whom Shall he teach knowledge
[1:55:50] and Whom Shall he make to understand
[1:55:52] Doctrine he says them that are weaned
[1:55:54] from the milk and draw from the breasts
[1:55:57] you know what he's saying baby
[1:55:59] Christians need not
[1:56:01] apply if you need to be spoonfed
[1:56:04] everything if you need to be padded and
[1:56:06] coddled all the time you're not going to
[1:56:09] get
[1:56:10] anywhere it's funny we were over at
[1:56:12] brother Paul and sister Kims
[1:56:13] and I knew I was going to be talking
[1:56:15] about babies that need to be
[1:56:17] weaned and you know there are some
[1:56:19] babies don't get weaned for
[1:56:21] years I've met babies that were 3 years
[1:56:24] old and still drinking
[1:56:27] milk cuz they refused to move on to
[1:56:30] something
[1:56:31] else they like milk they like nursing
[1:56:34] they like the contact they like the
[1:56:36] Comfort whatever it was they like the
[1:56:37] taste whatever it was and they refuse to
[1:56:40] try anything else cuz here's the thing
[1:56:42] how do you know when the baby's ready
[1:56:44] the parent knows best the parent knows
[1:56:47] there's a time to start introducing new
[1:56:48] foods when their stomach can handle it
[1:56:50] their digestion can handle it and so you
[1:56:52] start to what blend in a bit of more
[1:56:54] solid food with their milk cuz the milk
[1:56:57] is only meant for a certain amount of
[1:56:59] time and then after a while it's
[1:57:01] actually deficient of nutrients and they
[1:57:04] need something else but you'll get a
[1:57:07] baby that's
[1:57:08] stubborn and they'll refuse to be weaned
[1:57:11] and you know what happens they get fussy
[1:57:14] and then they get even more fussy
[1:57:15] because they're not getting what they
[1:57:17] need and they're the only thing that's
[1:57:18] holding them back
[1:57:20] mama is ready to give it to him she's
[1:57:21] tried them on food Daddy's trying to
[1:57:22] give them more solid food and these
[1:57:24] different things but the baby refuses it
[1:57:27] and the baby won't grow the way it's
[1:57:29] supposed to and it actually hurts the
[1:57:33] baby God puts things in front of us by
[1:57:35] the word how are you ready for more word
[1:57:38] he puts it in front of you how how do
[1:57:40] you know when you're ready to come up
[1:57:41] higher God calls you God gives you the
[1:57:44] opportunity he places the choice in
[1:57:45] front of you that's when you're old
[1:57:47] enough to do it that's when you're big
[1:57:48] enough that's when you're mature enough
[1:57:49] to come to a higher level is when he
[1:57:51] puts it in front of you that's it the
[1:57:54] parent chooses when it's time for the
[1:57:55] child to come up a little bit higher you
[1:57:57] know the disciples had a time where
[1:57:59] Jesus said I've got many things to tell
[1:58:00] you but you can't handle it yet but
[1:58:03] there came a time when they could handle
[1:58:04] it when they matured enough and he
[1:58:06] revealed it to them and they could step
[1:58:08] into the word in a greater
[1:58:10] way he says for precept must be upon
[1:58:14] precept precept upon precept it's one
[1:58:17] thing after another and you can't can't
[1:58:19] go to the next thing until you've done
[1:58:20] the first thing until you've settled the
[1:58:23] first thing you can't go to the second
[1:58:24] thing and until you've settled the
[1:58:25] second thing you can't go to the third
[1:58:27] and until the third you can't go to the
[1:58:29] fourth it's got to be fixed and then you
[1:58:32] got to build it up bit by bit then he
[1:58:34] says line upon line line upon line one
[1:58:39] at a time not all together God doesn't
[1:58:42] just do this big download on you he
[1:58:44] Build You Up bit by bit make sure it's
[1:58:47] steady make sure it's stable make sure
[1:58:49] you got got it and then he goes to the
[1:58:50] next bit and the next bit and the next
[1:58:53] bit he says here a little and there a
[1:58:55] little bit by bit as he determines it's
[1:58:58] what he did in Canaan remember he says
[1:59:00] and little by little I'll give you the
[1:59:02] land little by little he says lest it be
[1:59:04] overcome by the
[1:59:05] beasts if I give you the victory too
[1:59:07] quick it'll be worse for you you got to
[1:59:10] go bit by bit so you can hold on to what
[1:59:12] you've got it's like graduation from
[1:59:15] school you
[1:59:16] know I I I think this is the way it can
[1:59:19] some times feel within the message is we
[1:59:21] we've been given the whole
[1:59:23] picture and we know we're an end time
[1:59:26] bribe we know we're called for rapturing
[1:59:27] faith we no we're we're we're called
[1:59:29] into the third pole and all these
[1:59:31] different things the opening of the word
[1:59:33] and we see all this big
[1:59:36] picture and what can happen is we expect
[1:59:39] ourselves to do everything that the big
[1:59:41] picture shows us from day one from year
[1:59:44] 1 from year 10 whatever it might be we
[1:59:46] walk up and because we we know about it
[1:59:49] it we think we have to produce it
[1:59:52] immediately that's never in the
[1:59:54] scripture it's never in the scripture
[1:59:56] there's always a process of growth and
[1:59:58] development in for real Believers in the
[2:00:01] Scripture it always happens that way you
[2:00:03] go to school if they told you what the
[2:00:05] exam was going to be at the start of the
[2:00:08] Year you'd have no confidence you could
[2:00:10] pass the
[2:00:11] exam why because you haven't been taught
[2:00:13] precept upon precept line upon line
[2:00:15] chapter by chapter principle by
[2:00:17] principle but if you go through through
[2:00:19] the year and you do your homework and
[2:00:21] you do your quizzes and you pass your
[2:00:23] test by the time you get to the exam
[2:00:26] you've already you know everything
[2:00:27] that's in the exam and you'll pass it
[2:00:29] just fine because you've done the little
[2:00:30] by little precept upon precept all the
[2:00:32] way through it's the same thing with God
[2:00:35] just because we see the big picture
[2:00:36] doesn't mean we have to produce it all
[2:00:38] right now because it's little by little
[2:00:40] precept upon precept God drawing things
[2:00:42] out of our life God putting things into
[2:00:44] our life
[2:00:46] amen everything in this life is a
[2:00:49] test as Believers everything's a test
[2:00:52] every day is a test every every
[2:00:55] opportunity every thought every
[2:00:57] relationship everything we go through is
[2:00:58] a test to see what we're going to
[2:01:00] do and as we deal with those things God
[2:01:03] brings us to the next one and the next
[2:01:05] one and the next one and the next one
[2:01:07] until finally he says they're good to go
[2:01:10] and they
[2:01:12] graduate gives you the Holy Ghost takes
[2:01:15] you into
[2:01:16] adoption cuz you've been built up in the
[2:01:19] Most Holy Faith line by line bit by bit
[2:01:22] bit by bit and then what the seal so the
[2:01:25] soul is sealed then after that what
[2:01:27] happens and as we close on
[2:01:30] this he says first
[2:01:32] foundationally we're talking about these
[2:01:34] stages he says first foundationally is
[2:01:36] Faith second add to your faith virtue to
[2:01:38] your virtue Knowledge from knowledge
[2:01:39] Temperance from Temperance patience to
[2:01:41] patience godliness and from godliness
[2:01:43] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and
[2:01:45] then love being the Capstone he says
[2:01:47] seven of those things seven Church AG
[2:01:49] see and the Seven Stars of the church
[2:01:51] ages and all of it is tempered together
[2:01:54] by the Holy Spirit he says now that's
[2:01:56] what it takes to become a servant of
[2:02:00] Christ and everything before that like I
[2:02:02] said it's a test shaking it to see
[2:02:04] what'll come out and if nothing comes
[2:02:06] out then you move to the next thing and
[2:02:09] he shakes that and when that's settled
[2:02:10] then he moves on to the next thing and
[2:02:12] it's shaking shaking shaking
[2:02:13] everything's a test to see will you
[2:02:15] stand
[2:02:16] firm will you not lose your Christian
[2:02:19] it in the
[2:02:22] situation is your Christianity tied to
[2:02:24] how much money is in your bank account
[2:02:26] how good your health is how good your
[2:02:27] marriage is how nice your kids
[2:02:29] are how good the service was how good
[2:02:32] the service wasn't who's song leading
[2:02:35] what they're singing proving all of
[2:02:37] these things to see what kind of a
[2:02:38] nature is in there and what you're going
[2:02:40] to surrender to but then once that soul
[2:02:43] is sealed what does he do he takes us
[2:02:46] here this is what we had from way back
[2:02:49] back when and he starts now to push from
[2:02:51] in there and now the mind of Christ
[2:02:53] comes in and that's what's pushing out
[2:02:56] now into your spirit and now what's
[2:02:58] happening is the word is going into your
[2:02:59] imagination the word is going into your
[2:03:01] conscience the word is going to your
[2:03:02] memory to reason affection and then when
[2:03:05] he has those channels all cleared out
[2:03:07] then now it's moving out to your body
[2:03:09] and you'll literally see that what
[2:03:10] happens is the holy spirit is taking
[2:03:12] dominion over every aspect of your body
[2:03:16] and it's bringing you to a Rapture
[2:03:18] condition
[2:03:19] because when your spirit's done then
[2:03:22] it's the body and all it's doing is it's
[2:03:24] preparing that body to go and what
[2:03:26] experience a change it's just bringing
[2:03:28] you from glory to glory to the place
[2:03:32] that you're ready to
[2:03:33] go but you got to get this
[2:03:36] sealed once that's sealed God says it'll
[2:03:39] take care of everything else once that's
[2:03:41] done don't worry about the rest it it's
[2:03:44] almost like uh you know they have
[2:03:47] a yeah they have these things where you
[2:03:50] you know they've got a timer on it and
[2:03:53] when the timer goes off it opens
[2:03:56] up that's what this is it's something
[2:03:59] that's set and as soon as it opens
[2:04:02] there's no holding it back you don't
[2:04:03] have to do anything to it it's
[2:04:05] self-sufficient it's self- sustaining
[2:04:08] and it just starts to work in your life
[2:04:10] and it starts to bring everything now
[2:04:12] under a total Dominion to the word of
[2:04:14] God not just here a bit and there a bit
[2:04:16] but it's now bringing everything under
[2:04:18] the authority of Christ in your life the
[2:04:21] soul is settled the Integrity of your
[2:04:23] heart is known that's what he said to
[2:04:25] Solomon he said your father David served
[2:04:27] from the Integrity of his heart the
[2:04:30] heart was right and when that's right in
[2:04:32] there the soul is settled it starts to
[2:04:33] now work into our life and bring
[2:04:35] everything under the authority of the
[2:04:36] word and it turns you into a living
[2:04:39] Christ amen God bless you let's stand
[2:04:42] together if we
[2:04:47] would
[2:04:51] amen it's a
[2:04:52] fight brother Bram says it's a rough
[2:04:54] road you've
[2:04:55] got you know it's funny with modern
[2:04:58] technology we can do a lot but you ever
[2:05:00] look at what they did with those old
[2:05:01] train tracks and as smooth as it looks
[2:05:03] when you got moving pretty quick it was
[2:05:04] a rough ride he's saying it's a rough
[2:05:07] ride even with the Holy Ghost it's a
[2:05:09] rough ride there's a there's a reason
[2:05:11] why Paul called US soldiers I think
[2:05:13] because we're in for a rough
[2:05:15] time you know what's interesting about
[2:05:17] diligence when it comes to diligence
[2:05:20] there's two things that stand out as
[2:05:21] soldiers and athletes cuz soldiers will
[2:05:23] shoot and shoot and shoot every single
[2:05:26] day they perfect their craft because
[2:05:29] it's a matter of life and death if they
[2:05:31] get it wrong and for athletes the only
[2:05:33] way to win is to do more and be better
[2:05:36] than the person next to you and so every
[2:05:38] day they train they train they train
[2:05:41] they eat right they sleep right they
[2:05:43] dress right they have the best habits in
[2:05:46] in the world to make their bodies as
[2:05:48] perfect as they can possibly get it for
[2:05:49] competition for that Soldier it's all
[2:05:51] about you and the guy next to you saving
[2:05:54] lives and Taking
[2:05:56] Lives that's where diligence comes
[2:06:02] in we look at our prayer life we look at
[2:06:04] our our needs in our life and I'm asking
[2:06:07] tonight this is what I've been asking
[2:06:10] myself what are you focused
[2:06:14] on what is the greatest desire that you
[2:06:17] would have tonight
[2:06:20] if you could have anything tonight what
[2:06:22] would it
[2:06:23] be is it
[2:06:25] natural or is it
[2:06:28] Eternal I'll tell you what I want I want
