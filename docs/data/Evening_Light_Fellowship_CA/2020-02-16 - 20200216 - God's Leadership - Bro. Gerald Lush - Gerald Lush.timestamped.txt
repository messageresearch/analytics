[57:15] hallelujah amen hallelujah thank you
[57:18] praise the name of the Lord God bless
[57:21] turn with me to Genesis chapter 2 and
[57:30] again as the Lord leads to try to bring
[57:34] more thoughts concerning leadership to
[57:39] make our calling and election sure to
[57:42] make sure that we have a spiritual and
[57:44] spiritually inspired leadership by the
[57:48] Holy Ghost not just an uninspired or
[57:51] religious by the Satan's anointing but
[57:54] by God's a 19a men to believe that God
[57:57] is in control of the leadership in your
[58:00] life amen
[58:02] not my will then be done that's a
[58:04] tremendous statement a man to make what
[58:06] is the will of God for your everyday
[58:08] living amen grace to us in Genesis
[58:14] chapter to find the leadership of God in
[58:19] Genesis again to get the revelation of
[58:22] those that had his leadership and those
[58:24] that came under Satan's leadership amen
[58:27] and that's why we're here today a man
[58:29] doing what we're doing that's why we're
[58:32] trying to live that life and give
[58:33] control to Jesus because in the
[58:36] beginning there was one of them they
[58:37] gave control to the devil a man
[58:39] so the grace of God to us that we have
[58:42] that right leadership and in Genesis 2
[58:46] and beginning to read at verse 7 and the
[58:50] Lord God formed man of the dust of the
[58:53] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[58:56] the breath of life and man became a
[59:00] living soul and the Lord God planted a
[59:05] garden eastward in Eden and there he put
[59:09] the man whom he had formed and
[59:13] the ground made the Lord God to grow
[59:15] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[59:19] good for food The Tree of Life also in
[59:24] the midst of the garden the tree of
[59:27] knowledge of good and evil a man but God
[59:32] put it there for a reason and verse 16
[59:37] and the Lord God commanded the man
[59:40] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[59:43] mayest freely eat amen but of the tree
[59:49] of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[59:52] not eat of it they mad as it was then so
[59:56] it is now there are those things that
[59:59] God wants us to eat but then there are
[1:00:02] other things that God doesn't want us to
[1:00:04] touch a man and it is a tree of
[1:00:08] knowledge of good and evil a man and
[1:00:11] just think of it that it's going to be
[1:00:13] so close to the real that if a if
[1:00:16] possible would deceive the very elect
[1:00:19] so the grace of God brother that the
[1:00:22] tree of knowledge of good and evil today
[1:00:23] around the message is not going to
[1:00:26] deceive you a man but of the tree of
[1:00:29] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[1:00:31] not eat of it but I turn it is the
[1:00:34] greater majority of so-called believers
[1:00:36] a day are partaking of the tree of
[1:00:38] knowledge of good and evil amen so grace
[1:00:42] to give us eyes to see ears to hear the
[1:00:45] truth they met and grace to give us the
[1:00:48] revelation what leadership we're
[1:00:50] underneath under a man is a God's
[1:00:53] leadership the God of creation or is the
[1:00:56] god of this world the devil god have
[1:01:00] mercy on us but of the tree of knowledge
[1:01:02] of good and evil thou shalt not eat of
[1:01:05] it oh but it's good and evil we'll just
[1:01:08] eat the good but you're not gonna leave
[1:01:10] the evil that's the deception
[1:01:14] for in the day that thou eatest thereof
[1:01:16] thou shalt surely die die physically now
[1:01:22] they're gonna die spiritually god bless
[1:01:24] his words you may be seated
[1:01:28] just some thoughts if we go to another
[1:01:31] scripture in Genesis 3 but just to bring
[1:01:42] greetings from our brother car in New
[1:01:44] Brunswick and our brother car is as
[1:01:48] brother market for me turn 90 the like
[1:01:51] this week and but somebody told me
[1:01:55] somebody asked him what does it like to
[1:01:56] be 90s I don't know and and I believe it
[1:02:01] because he didn't when I spoke to him on
[1:02:04] the phone he certainly did it sound like
[1:02:05] someone 90 years old not sound like a
[1:02:08] teenager and and my brother is that his
[1:02:11] words and and now he talks and his
[1:02:13] actions are the same he's still a young
[1:02:15] man
[1:02:16] I said well brother you're not you're
[1:02:18] not ninety or nine you're just nine
[1:02:21] years old so I said I believe that I
[1:02:23] said you sound like it and so on so I
[1:02:26] pray God continue to bless our brother
[1:02:28] as he ministers at 90 years old a man
[1:02:31] and he was 89 I believe was in in
[1:02:34] brother in the assembly and Grand Falls
[1:02:38] new beer old assembly our brother
[1:02:41] Minister there might have been 88 I
[1:02:42] guess or 89 and he just came down here
[1:02:45] just to visit Newfoundland and just take

[1:05:52] his commitments so the god bless our
[1:05:55] brother Carmen as he comes to minister
[1:05:57] to us for three services during the
[1:05:59] Easter a man also to remind you
[1:06:03] concerning the storms we've had I was
[1:06:07] somewhat surprised concerning a report
[1:06:10] that I heard that that if we went around
[1:06:13] the world the storm that we had here and
[1:06:16] what we were dealing with here in the
[1:06:18] eastern new food land and it apparently
[1:06:22] had affected the thoughts of the world
[1:06:24] and because of what was going on here
[1:06:27] and to them again scientists of course
[1:06:30] are recognizing it as the climate change
[1:06:32] science knows that something is going on
[1:06:35] up there in the universe they know that
[1:06:37] and I trust that you and I got that
[1:06:39] revelation too and that understanding
[1:06:41] but don't take it lately you can look up
[1:06:43] don't look up for that look up for glory
[1:06:45] a man the kingdom of God
[1:06:48] and I don't know if you noticed it or
[1:06:51] not but during the reports on the of the
[1:06:54] storm that we had here and all the snow
[1:06:58] that we've had and so on that they refer
[1:07:01] to it as Snowmageddon I trust you
[1:07:04] understand that where that come from
[1:07:07] was Armageddon and that's why they
[1:07:09] called it Snowmageddon brothers just
[1:07:12] think the world is recognizing these
[1:07:15] things that you and I ought to have the
[1:07:17] revelation of four years the Battle of
[1:07:20] Armageddon and that's what that's what
[1:07:23] they are that's what they are comparing
[1:07:24] this past winter with the Battle of
[1:07:26] Armageddon
[1:07:27] Wyatt brother the real battle of
[1:07:31] Armageddon is coming before the nation's
[1:07:33] but brother now they're saying that
[1:07:34] we're dealing with it because of our
[1:07:36] weather rather we're closer to the end
[1:07:40] than we think it's over
[1:07:42] we better get more serious with what we
[1:07:45] believe a man we get it more serious
[1:07:48] with the promise concerning the
[1:07:50] resurrection
[1:07:51] how serious are you but it is just too
[1:07:53] many that are more serious with their
[1:07:55] families and caught up with their
[1:07:57] natural family whether they're certainly
[1:07:59] not caught up with the with the word and
[1:08:01] I caught up with their spiritual
[1:08:02] families
[1:08:03] no no so I pray grace that we're going
[1:08:06] to if we got the Holy Ghost of course we
[1:08:08] will be caught up with our spiritual
[1:08:09] family in prayer concerned and so on why
[1:08:13] because of the hour that we're living
[1:08:15] well this when we see this happening in
[1:08:18] our storms and so on brother sister we'd
[1:08:22] better look up get out of here amen
[1:08:26] they're recognizing the change in the
[1:08:28] world I trust we're recognizing his
[1:08:30] change not not just naturally but
[1:08:32] spiritually see it's having spiritual
[1:08:34] leadership not natural leadership if
[1:08:37] it's natural leadership and oh well I'm
[1:08:40] a mess I'm a believer so you and you'll
[1:08:41] go on and still keep me living the life
[1:08:43] you want to live kills to do what you
[1:08:45] want to do when you want to do it how
[1:08:46] you want to do it where you want to do
[1:08:48] it no it's got to be God in control a
[1:08:50] man trusts him by grace that it was the
[1:08:53] leadership of God for where our our
[1:08:56] sisters here from the United States that
[1:08:58] ended up to married to Newfoundlanders
[1:09:00] and so on and to move here raised
[1:09:03] there's a family here and so on
[1:09:04] so the grace of God be with them that
[1:09:07] that was God leadership in their lives a
[1:09:09] man to God be the glory amen so brother
[1:09:14] we need to get more and more spiritual
[1:09:16] by the grace of God amen so let's let's
[1:09:20] consider yes Snowmageddon but we're not
[1:09:23] gonna look for more snow we're looking
[1:09:25] for the Battle of Armageddon now and
[1:09:27] then who over over used Snowmageddon
[1:09:30] that's what was in their mind was the
[1:09:32] Battle of Armageddon and they feel oh
[1:09:35] the Bible says this the Bible says that
[1:09:37] about Armageddon oh this is what we're
[1:09:40] experiencing in the in the natural a man
[1:09:43] so grace to us is my prayer and God
[1:09:46] bless sister Kimberly and and the baby
[1:09:49] Michael and she's I guess they're home

[1:10:27] Michael a male so God be with us oh yes
[1:10:31] and of course brother Bob I would say I
[1:10:33] mentioned in prayer and that's remember
[1:10:35] our brother Ron Spencer amen
[1:10:39] the grace of God - brother Ron amen
[1:10:42] Lord blesses turn with me to Genesis
[1:10:45] chapter 3 Genesis chapter 3 I want to
[1:10:56] share with you again subscriptions
[1:10:57] concerning leadership and also some
[1:11:00] quotes and it's amazing again that I
[1:11:04] have highlighted by the round ministry
[1:11:06] on leadership in December the 7th
[1:11:09] shortly before the Lord called of all
[1:11:10] but to highlight also some other very
[1:11:14] significant messages that the Lord laid
[1:11:16] on his heart to minister and again it
[1:11:19] was the invisible union of the bride and
[1:11:21] again November 1965 and Christ is
[1:11:25] revealed in his own word August 1965 but
[1:11:29] I discovered some other messages as well
[1:11:32] the anointing was at the end time of
[1:11:34] course and god of this evil age they man
[1:11:40] and another one right here
[1:11:42] is Satan's Eden it's a warning to the
[1:11:45] bride it's a warning to the believers of
[1:11:47] what we're going to be dealing with
[1:11:49] before the resurrection and before the
[1:11:51] rapture we're going to be dealing with
[1:11:53] the god of this world were of this evil
[1:11:55] age and we're going to be dealing with
[1:11:57] it in Satan's eaten so I pray the grace
[1:12:00] of God that we're not going to be eating
[1:12:02] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:12:03] evil and again it said there's a warning
[1:12:06] there that it's really not of good and
[1:12:08] evil in these last days is going to be
[1:12:10] so close to the real it would deceive
[1:12:12] the very elect if possible oh yeah it's
[1:12:15] going to
[1:12:15] it's got you the tree of knowledge of
[1:12:17] good and evil is gonna be testifying or
[1:12:18] what testifying of the entire message
[1:12:20] testifying of the prophet tends to find
[1:12:22] of that oh yeah and that's like you'll
[1:12:24] be kept you got to be careful what
[1:12:25] you're looking at on online and on the
[1:12:28] internet most definitely because brother
[1:12:30] it's a tree of knowledge of good and
[1:12:32] evil don't because only that brother is
[1:12:35] a message preacher that was the message
[1:12:37] preacher makes no difference
[1:12:38] brother will come when it comes to
[1:12:40] message preachers brother the God had to
[1:12:42] deal with that in the in Genesis and
[1:12:44] Abel had to deal with the Cain had to
[1:12:46] deal with it
[1:12:47] and it comes on down so no doubt no and
[1:12:49] Enoch had to deal with it Noah had to
[1:12:51] deal with it and it comes on down
[1:12:53] through the prophets and so on and
[1:12:54] there's are many other examples that I
[1:12:57] could give you when it comes to
[1:12:59] leadership
[1:12:59] you're either under the leadership of
[1:13:01] God or you're under the leadership of
[1:13:03] Satan and again if you're you can be
[1:13:06] under the leadership of God stay with
[1:13:07] the word stay simple stay humble under
[1:13:10] the leadership of the devil a man oh
[1:13:12] yeah you're going to preach the message
[1:13:13] but again so close to a deceive the
[1:13:16] elect and we are warned Paul warned it
[1:13:18] before he's going I'll be may be Peter
[1:13:20] warned to say before the Lord took him
[1:13:22] home and brother again the problem of
[1:13:24] God has warned us in these last days and
[1:13:26] Jesus also warned us concerning
[1:13:29] deception and brother that's the Satan
[1:13:32] has been there since the Garden of Eden
[1:13:34] and brother he's still there in Satan's
[1:13:37] eating a man has gone from God's Eden to
[1:13:40] Satan's Eden a man and God is going to
[1:13:43] take his elect and his sons and
[1:13:44] daughters and his right out of here a
[1:13:46] man and brother well when God creates a
[1:13:49] New Eden as it were is doing there's
[1:13:51] gonna be no sin there's going to be no
[1:13:52] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:13:54] it's gonna be perfect by the grace of
[1:13:56] Almighty God so God Elvis brother again
[1:14:00] I ministered at on a certain message
[1:14:04] some time ago and it might have been god
[1:14:07] of this evil age and then I finished by
[1:14:10] asking you these questions and that is
[1:14:13] who are you are you Adam with Adams
[1:14:21] attitude Adams leadership are you Eve
[1:14:25] yeah so are you able or are you Kane
[1:14:31] well yeah Kane talk to God
[1:14:34] Kane I fellowship with God yeah okay a
[1:14:38] fellow sir was able and it killed him
[1:14:40] yeah so are you able or you Kane if
[1:14:46] you're guilty of killing somebody
[1:14:47] killing there's their spirit or attitude
[1:14:50] Kelly they're there their motives under
[1:14:52] objectives Kelly they're in their nature
[1:14:54] a man but there can be you can have the
[1:14:58] spirit of Cain let's make sure we don't
[1:15:00] have the spirit that Yvette to make sure
[1:15:03] we don't have the spirit that Cain had a
[1:15:04] man so are we Enoch or Noah both thumbs
[1:15:10] grace with God they may it but he Locke
[1:15:15] was raptured Noah went through the flood
[1:15:17] a man and I really am are we locked
[1:15:25] whose spirit do you have whose attitude
[1:15:28] do you have the attitude of Abraham or
[1:15:30] the attitude of lot and again it is
[1:15:34] Jacob and Esau do we have jingo spirit
[1:15:40] or a soul spirit oh yeah and yet Jacob
[1:15:46] was our Esau brother was entitled to the
[1:15:48] birthright but yet his spirit and his
[1:15:50] attitude wasn't right
[1:15:52] his motive an objective was right
[1:15:54] the reason they why he wanted it wasn't
[1:15:57] right a man so he was under he was under
[1:16:00] a false leadership and but Jacob oh he
[1:16:04] wanted that knowing knowing the
[1:16:06] significance of it knowing what it meant
[1:16:07] he wanted that birthright same thing
[1:16:11] with the Bride of Christ we want the
[1:16:12] birthright a man and it said Joseph are
[1:16:17] you Joseph or his elder brothers that
[1:16:21] betrayed him there are a lot of
[1:16:24] believers that are Joseph's elder
[1:16:26] brothers because they betrayed a lot of
[1:16:29] believers oh yeah
[1:16:33] now you Moses are you days and Cora will
[1:16:39] read that about them in a moment so I
[1:16:42] trust God the grace of God where Moses
[1:16:43] we're not dating
[1:16:45] we're not Korah no because the Bible
[1:16:48] warns us in the last days now yeah
[1:16:50] there's this these are going to be
[1:16:52] deceived that's going to be to see why
[1:16:53] because they got Dayton's spirit and
[1:16:55] chorus spirit and there's ministering
[1:16:58] Brethren with those spirits and
[1:17:00] deceiving the people and it says are you
[1:17:04] Jesus or are you Judas oh yeah there's
[1:17:11] nowhere that Judas stood out in the word
[1:17:12] as the disciple that he was false and he
[1:17:15] was dis and he was cruel and so on no no
[1:17:18] that didn't come out until until Jesus
[1:17:21] Camus was going to enter the third pole
[1:17:23] of his ministry then what was in Judas
[1:17:27] began to come out and what's in the
[1:17:29] believers today is coming out caught
[1:17:31] Elvis see it's more serious than what we
[1:17:34] think we just want a preacher to come
[1:17:36] and preach an old make us happy and oh
[1:17:37] we're glory hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:40] yeah the devil can do that and then
[1:17:44] blind people to the fact that they're
[1:17:47] under a deceiving spirit and I was
[1:17:53] thinking about it yesterday last night
[1:17:56] and I woke seven o'clock this morning
[1:17:58] and I couldn't go to sleep again it's
[1:18:00] just I couldn't get it get away from
[1:18:02] that anointing concerning leadership you
[1:18:07] know it's been on my thoughts I asked
[1:18:10] the Lord God help us and brother if you
[1:18:15] got a position in the church a position
[1:18:17] of leadership make sure you're calling
[1:18:18] an election is sure definitely so I urge
[1:18:24] you Jesus or Judas
[1:18:27] well Judas went on he was numbered with
[1:18:29] those that went out and prayed for the
[1:18:31] sick raise the dead healed the sick yeah
[1:18:34] Jesus anointed them and they come back
[1:18:36] as oh we did this we did that they
[1:18:39] didn't say Judas was separate none of
[1:18:42] the other disciples mentioned Judas
[1:18:43] saying he was this and he was that
[1:18:45] no the other side mentioned he's he
[1:18:47] negative of Jesus only when he betrayed
[1:18:49] Jesus or bro Judas rather only when he
[1:18:52] betrayed Jesus god help us
[1:18:59] as I said Jesus had more trouble with
[1:19:02] Peter than you did with Judas because
[1:19:05] Peter was constantly questioning God
[1:19:07] Peter was constantly stopping this don't
[1:19:09] do this don't do that the father Jesus
[1:19:11] said get that behind me Satan yeah
[1:19:13] repeat he was referring to the spirit
[1:19:15] that was influencing Peter was he under
[1:19:21] Jesus leadership or Peters leadership oh
[1:19:25] Jesus constantly asked him after
[1:19:27] resurrection lovest thou me more than
[1:19:31] these lovest thou me more than these oh
[1:19:34] yeah Peter was referring to human love
[1:19:37] Jesus did use human love but then he
[1:19:40] referred to define law my copy amen now
[1:19:44] figlio no divine love that's what God's
[1:19:50] looking for in you and me amen
[1:19:53] praise the name of the Lord brother I
[1:19:55] told you feel your love is one thing but
[1:19:57] I tell you a couple love is another amen
[1:20:00] what does couple love or old mine you
[1:20:02] lay down your life for your brothers and
[1:20:04] sisters as Christ lay down his life for
[1:20:07] us what motivated him divine love
[1:20:11] amen he loved us is there anything in
[1:20:16] you that he loves is there something
[1:20:20] there about you that that Jesus loves
[1:20:23] who did he laid his life down for who
[1:20:26] did he die for was it you then he loved
[1:20:31] you and he's looking to restore you and
[1:20:35] he's looking to do to become United with
[1:20:37] you in an invisible union of the
[1:20:40] heavenly bride bridegroom and the
[1:20:42] earthly bride
[1:20:44] god help us
[1:20:48] so are you Jesus or Judas many are Judas
[1:20:54] to betray the word of course you've
[1:20:57] betrayed the word with a kiss yeah oh my
[1:21:02] god grace to us that we be not deceived
[1:21:06] hey man that's right
[1:21:11] so are we
[1:21:12] wise virgins why are we foolish virgins
[1:21:16] oh yeah
[1:21:17] virgins but you're either wise or you're
[1:21:19] foolish are you wise believers or
[1:21:24] foolish believers some are foolish yeah
[1:21:30] and the problem of God did highlight he
[1:21:32] said now he said the wise and the
[1:21:34] foolish virgins remember he said they're
[1:21:36] all virgins you know but he said there's
[1:21:40] wise get wisdom but get understanding
[1:21:44] the Bible say it concerning what God has
[1:21:49] done what God is doing we need the
[1:21:51] wisdom of God the leadership of God and
[1:21:55] brother God leads us with anything as
[1:21:57] his wisdom hey man and he'll lead us
[1:22:00] with his understanding praise the Lord

[1:22:22] Church that's what the problem of God
[1:22:25] said they're unbelievers there's make
[1:22:28] believers and there's believers but the
[1:22:31] believers got no question it stays with
[1:22:33] the truth the whole truth nothing but

[1:24:49] life no matter what you're doing what
[1:24:51] you're thinking it's all him amen
[1:24:54] you're under his leadership to the
[1:24:56] extent that he's the one that's in
[1:24:58] control and he's the one that's there
[1:25:01] that's leading you
[1:25:02] amen brother Brown preach leadership I
[1:25:05] don't know if you're aware of it he
[1:25:07] preached it again or before he preached
[1:25:10] it here in Indiana it is the same or
[1:25:12] rather in another church there he
[1:25:16] preached it in Prescott Arizona
[1:25:19] leadership what was it it was a message
[1:25:24] to young people he was preaching to
[1:25:28] young people young brothers and sisters
[1:25:30] yeah why to encourage them to make their
[1:25:34] calling an election sure by making sure
[1:25:36] that they have the right leadership in
[1:25:38] their lives
[1:25:39] and that's where he highlights the fact
[1:25:40] you know that when you're born and
[1:25:42] you're under this leadership you under
[1:25:43] that leadership you're on the moms
[1:25:45] leadership you're under dad's leadership
[1:25:46] and then you under the teachers
[1:25:48] leadership but he said what leadership
[1:25:50] are you under now a man and he's
[1:25:54] bringing that to the attention of the of
[1:25:56] the young people to let him know that
[1:25:58] there's a leader in their lives a man
[1:26:01] and they need to make sure that it's
[1:26:04] it's Christ and in that message to the
[1:26:07] young people he said you've got a you've
[1:26:10] got a face one thing and he said eternal
[1:26:13] life and there's only one person who can
[1:26:15] give it give that to you he said mama
[1:26:18] can't give it to you pop okay give it to
[1:26:20] you your pastor can give it to you
[1:26:22] you're the leader can't give it to you
[1:26:23] he said everybody that gets eternal life
[1:26:26] as to come to Jesus Christ he is the
[1:26:30] only one who can give that part eternal
[1:26:33] life he said your teacher can give you
[1:26:36] education and teach you and you have to
[1:26:39] learn it your mother can teach you to
[1:26:41] walk and you had to learn to walk your
[1:26:44] faith father can teach you how to be a
[1:26:46] businessman and what you have to learn
[1:26:48] but he said only Jesus can give you
[1:26:51] eternal life oh yeah he said your priest
[1:26:56] your leader or so forth can teach you
[1:27:00] your religion and you can learn the
[1:27:02] message that we are trying to teach yeah
[1:27:07] you can learn that
[1:27:10] but the message but who's in control of
[1:27:14] your life amen
[1:27:16] why are you here today because you
[1:27:18] decided to come or was it the leadership
[1:27:21] of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:23] Christ in you and he said you can learn
[1:27:28] the message that we are trying to teach
[1:27:30] you can learn it oh yeah
[1:27:34] but still he said that one give you
[1:27:38] eternal life he said you got to accept
[1:27:40] the person Jesus Christ you got to know
[1:27:44] him not know about him and he says you
[1:27:50] understand that he said all of you he
[1:27:52] said got to accept the person Jesus
[1:27:55] Christ to have eternal life now and he
[1:27:58] said but sometimes other leadership in
[1:28:03] your life other leadership sin your life
[1:28:07] get so much influence on us till we
[1:28:11] don't know what to do when that time
[1:28:16] comes
[1:28:19] so what's influencing you today and I
[1:28:24] said what a fatal thing what a fatal
[1:28:27] thing it is to reject the leadership to
[1:28:31] eternal life amen brother is not just
[1:28:37] we're not looking for leadership Oh
[1:28:40] leadership to this revelation that
[1:28:42] revelation that revelation we're looking
[1:28:44] for leadership to the faith of the
[1:28:46] resurrection and the rapture that's
[1:28:49] eternal life
[1:28:50] that's Christ amen he said I am the
[1:28:54] resurrection believe us now this a man
[1:28:58] god help us to believe not to doubt and
[1:29:03] and again not make sure you're eating
[1:29:06] you the tree of life not the tree of
[1:29:08] knowledge of good and evil amen
[1:29:11] the tree of eternal life but there's too
[1:29:13] many believers that are still eating of
[1:29:15] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:29:17] amen oh no that's not messiest yes it's
[1:29:21] in the message it's right there
[1:29:24] and many are many as he end that brother
[1:29:28] that I was talking to on the phone a
[1:29:30] little while ago and he was interested
[1:29:32] in the message and he had met a believer
[1:29:34] but there were certain things about that
[1:29:36] believer that he questioned and I saw I
[1:29:39] understand you I said Jesus said the
[1:29:43] same problem I said the prophets have
[1:29:45] the same problem the ministry said the
[1:29:46] same problem as you're dealing with
[1:29:48] believers make believers non-believers
[1:29:50] oh yes he said that's right that's right
[1:29:53] he just felt that the word was right but
[1:29:55] something to do with that spirit of that
[1:29:57] brother wasn't right what he discerned
[1:30:03] the Spirit of Christ in you or just a
[1:30:05] religious spirit Amen sister that's
[1:30:09] right I've discerned sometimes the
[1:30:13] religious spirit in believers yeah but
[1:30:16] not the Spirit of Christ why they were
[1:30:19] in control of the religion but Christ
[1:30:21] wasn't in control of them that's the
[1:30:24] truth a lot of believers are in control
[1:30:26] the message and then they allow this
[1:30:28] they allow that they lots of Mel well I
[1:30:29] can't do this because that you know I
[1:30:31] read the message I've read the message
[1:30:32] yeah but where's that where's the light
[1:30:35] that is totally separated unto the Lord
[1:30:37] amen and you're not living for yourself
[1:30:40] you're living for Jesus amen so that
[1:30:44] your pity your children can see Christ
[1:30:46] in you hey well that's not just mom
[1:30:49] that's just not dead just not my grandma
[1:30:52] and grandpa no what do they see they see
[1:30:54] it something more in control of you the
[1:30:56] way you act the way you talk and how you
[1:30:58] counsel them and how you're encouraging
[1:31:00] them and so on
[1:31:00] hey man if Christ is in you your your
[1:31:04] yes your spiritual they'll recognize
[1:31:07] that in your life but it was just too
[1:31:11] many that are not spiritual just when
[1:31:12] they get in church and again they're not
[1:31:15] spiritual they're religious because of
[1:31:18] your spiritual it's in you now it's in
[1:31:20] you outside the door
[1:31:21] it's in you in your home it's in you no
[1:31:23] matter where you are even when you're
[1:31:25] working Alleluia its Christ in you
[1:31:28] anybody in crisis governing you oh this
[1:31:32] is serious we better make our calling
[1:31:35] and election sure make sure that we
[1:31:37] the right leadership a man so it's a man
[1:31:41] it's not not the devil
[1:31:43] no no the false scent of Christ is the
[1:31:45] true head of Christ that's leading me
[1:31:47] the Triad a crisis controlling me my
[1:31:51] thoughts my words my deeds my mother
[1:31:53] sent objects is what I want to do again
[1:31:56] when we're and out rather you repeating
[1:31:59] a lot of things yes because Peter said I
[1:32:01] got to repeat it because you're
[1:32:02] forgetful ears and he said I need to
[1:32:05] okay I used to know what I'm going to do
[1:32:07] is I'm going to keep bringing this to
[1:32:08] your remembrance a man god help us
[1:32:15] Genesis 3
[1:32:23] here with me
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:37] in Genesis 3 and verse 7 no sorry verse
[1:32:45] 1 now the serpent was more subtil than
[1:32:51] any beast of the field which the Lord
[1:32:54] God had made and he said unto the woman
[1:32:58] he got her attention
[1:33:00] yay and God said ye shall not eat of
[1:33:04] every tree of the garden and remember he
[1:33:06] wasn't a snake in the tree of knowledge
[1:33:08] of good and evil I seen pictures of but
[1:33:11] what they thought you know or a tree of
[1:33:12] knowledge good and evil and they had a
[1:33:14] serpent a snake in the tree and he was
[1:33:18] going to talk to Eve no he was an
[1:33:20] operator creature like a man yeah he was
[1:33:23] so close to man that they would mix yeah
[1:33:27] but when God cursed him all his legs
[1:33:30] come off his arms come off and he went
[1:33:32] down like a snake yeah that was the
[1:33:35] curse this thing caught for that
[1:33:38] understanding brother sister and we're
[1:33:41] dealing with the serpent even in this
[1:33:43] hour but the Bible tells us that even
[1:33:46] his angels are ministers even his angels
[1:33:52] have positions of leadership in the
[1:33:55] church Satan is not worried about out
[1:33:57] there they're born and seen a man with a
[1:34:01] sinful nature Satanist is after those
[1:34:04] who are looking to God and he wants to
[1:34:08] deceive them a man that's right brother
[1:34:12] so he was more subtil as he was then so
[1:34:16] he is now than any beast of the field
[1:34:19] which the Lord God had made and he said
[1:34:23] unto the woman yay and God said he
[1:34:26] quoted the word like people quote the
[1:34:31] message they quote the word they quote
[1:34:32] the word and then they'll add a word or
[1:34:35] they will take away word god help us
[1:34:40] yes God said ye shall not eat of every
[1:34:43] tree of the garden and the woman said
[1:34:46] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[1:34:48] of the trees of the garden but of the
[1:34:51] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:34:53] of the garden God has said ye shall not
[1:34:56] eat of it neither shall you touch it
[1:34:58] lest ye die remember was Satan's going
[1:35:01] to deceive us he's gonna he's going to
[1:35:03] do it on the basis of the word with the
[1:35:06] word a man with the word all people
[1:35:10] think Satan's gonna deceive me and get
[1:35:12] me to do this get me to do that no he's
[1:35:13] gonna get you to believe this and
[1:35:15] believe this and believe that he's
[1:35:17] focusing on what you believe
[1:35:18] he knows faith comes by hearing the word
[1:35:21] he knows so he's not gonna go there and
[1:35:25] do that to deceive you he's gonna be
[1:35:27] right he's gonna take what you're
[1:35:28] certain we were professing to believe
[1:35:30] and deceive you yeah you know take it
[1:35:34] and he misinterpreted you'll add to it
[1:35:37] you take away from it but again notice
[1:35:40] this again I keep reminding you that's
[1:35:42] gonna be so close it would deceive the
[1:35:44] very elect impossible grace that you're
[1:35:47] not deceived into doing what you're
[1:35:50] doing
[1:35:51] contrary to the will of God don't be
[1:35:55] deceived to do what you want to do
[1:35:57] no no Satan to do that well you believe
[1:35:59] the message you believe that yeah if God
[1:36:01] said yes God said yeah yeah okay a man a
[1:36:03] man a man and he was saying amen to what
[1:36:06] the serpent said amen
[1:36:10] that's what God said yeah if God said
[1:36:13] but he added a word to it
[1:36:15] so rather when when when you're dealing
[1:36:19] with the devil he'll quote the word
[1:36:20] he'll quote the message yeah yes God
[1:36:23] said but don't worry about that don't
[1:36:27] worry about this it's alright
[1:36:29] everything's fine you're good yeah
[1:36:32] I keep reminding you of what my father
[1:36:34] used to say two kinds of good he
[1:36:38] constantly reminded us of that his
[1:36:40] children he says you either good or good
[1:36:43] for nothing so he said what are you
[1:36:46] yeah he was challenging our faith let's
[1:36:50] be good for something this should be
[1:36:52] good for God hey man
[1:36:55] and there's none good but one praise the
[1:36:58] Lord
[1:36:59] as I said about that couple we met in a
[1:37:03] store there a few days ago amazing and
[1:37:08] we were sort of seemed like two others
[1:37:12] we were in line there to get checked out
[1:37:13] in a store and this lady and I was
[1:37:16] moving around and moving back and she
[1:37:18] spoke to something and she bought it oh
[1:37:20] my she said what a world were living in
[1:37:22] she says her and she said oh we don't
[1:37:26] have to worry with this natural foods
[1:37:27] natural this natural that she said every
[1:37:29] we bit we're blessed but she said people
[1:37:33] don't want to mind they don't mind
[1:37:35] talking about there's time with that but
[1:37:36] she said they don't want talking about
[1:37:37] Jesus I said I struck me I said that's
[1:37:44] right I said you're right I said they
[1:37:47] don't want Jesus they want this they
[1:37:50] want that but they don't want Jesus and
[1:37:52] when we discovered that she was a
[1:37:54] Christian I was a Christian whoa
[1:37:57] and her husband was there oh she said
[1:37:59] what church do you attend and I told her
[1:38:02] whoa
[1:38:03] we might be there sometime good she said
[1:38:06] because she said we go to this church
[1:38:07] over here just the one there on the
[1:38:10] corner of topsail Road and Paradise Road
[1:38:13] yeah
[1:38:14] I said well you go there yes she said
[1:38:16] yeah Oh ice appraised the Lord God bless
[1:38:19] you Oh wonderful to meet you stand when
[1:38:21] she saw sister Betty she went over and
[1:38:23] knocked her and put her arms around her
[1:38:26] and I said well Lord I said praise the
[1:38:28] Lord I said your will be done amen so
[1:38:32] the will of God be done that she said
[1:38:35] well we might come out that way
[1:38:36] sometimes she said and drop into your
[1:38:38] service well it got the Lord blessing
[1:38:41] ain't man she they were all mine she was
[1:38:45] right there to talk with the Lord hey
[1:38:47] man she was right there to bring Jesus
[1:38:49] into it Oh everything was busy busy busy
[1:38:52] I guess everybody was afraid that we're
[1:38:54] gonna have another storm and this was
[1:38:55] going
[1:38:56] happened that was going to happen so
[1:38:57] they were there to get these groceries
[1:38:58] these groceries and so on and when she
[1:39:00] should we leave it with the Lord she
[1:39:02] said EEPROM I said yes I said Lord will
[1:39:03] provide yes she says he's certain
[1:39:05] certainly will a man I said god bless
[1:39:08] her faith Lord a man her brother I trust
[1:39:12] a man she's following Jesus leadership
[1:39:15] oh yes she was she was he I prayed god
[1:39:18] bless her a man
[1:39:20] and again this be on our guard and verse
[1:39:30] three but of the fruit of the tree of
[1:39:32] life fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:39:34] midst of the garden God has said you
[1:39:38] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[1:39:39] touch it hmm solar separation don't eat
[1:39:45] it don't touch it just say I just want
[1:39:48] to look at it no don't touch it see yes
[1:39:53] God God requires that separation see
[1:39:56] it's like it's like when that brother we
[1:39:58] need two brother rounds office and he
[1:40:00] had a certain book there by a certain
[1:40:02] evangelist and he said brother I look at
[1:40:03] this yeah I said okay and he laid it on
[1:40:06] brother Browns Bible and went out and
[1:40:09] left and the angel said take that away
[1:40:12] don't put that on too on the work yeah
[1:40:15] and brother Brown removed it from the
[1:40:18] Bible and laid it aside
[1:40:19] yeah because it was false teaching and
[1:40:22] again another time when brother Manuel
[1:40:25] was there in being Jeffersonville many
[1:40:27] years ago maybe 1968 and he was in a
[1:40:30] brother's home and it was it was his
[1:40:33] wife the sister she was there she was
[1:40:35] the one to use to make brother branham's
[1:40:37] pot cherry pies that he liked and she
[1:40:40] was make pies for brother ran and so on
[1:40:42] and so they were sitting there in his
[1:40:45] home having fellowship when just all of
[1:40:50] a sudden the brother got up on the chair
[1:40:52] he moved over to where brother Manuel
[1:40:53] was and he reached to the end table
[1:40:55] there and there was there was a pan or
[1:40:57] something laid on the Bible and he took
[1:40:59] at me later the side took it off the
[1:41:01] Bible always said brother he said
[1:41:04] brother Brown would never
[1:41:06] never put anything on his Bible nothing
[1:41:09] and so he said I always keep my Bible
[1:41:12] clear oh I so that's good praise the
[1:41:16] Lord a man and I got the picture of that
[1:41:19] brother and his wife and and and a son a
[1:41:22] man don't thank God for their testimony
[1:41:25] brother you shall eat of it neither
[1:41:30] we shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[1:41:32] touch it lest she died we want to
[1:41:35] compromise a little here compromise
[1:41:37] there sometimes this family or friends
[1:41:40] or neighbors no don't compromise for
[1:41:41] them no no you take your stand and and
[1:41:45] if they got a right spirit they'll
[1:41:47] appreciate it
[1:41:48] oh yes they will it's like like I'd like
[1:41:52] with our neighbors oh yeah
[1:41:54] they've really appreciated your your
[1:41:57] spirit and your attitude we know you're
[1:41:58] doing things right so we've got no
[1:41:59] worries with this no worries with that
[1:42:01] and so on oh yeah and again one of our
[1:42:04] neighbors are saying where we moved at a
[1:42:05] paradise all my shoes I miss you I miss

[1:46:33] this wisdom and this understanding this
[1:46:35] leadership get wisdom get understanding
[1:46:37] by the grace of God yes that's the will
[1:46:40] of God let me read it to you again
[1:46:42] a man is tremendous
[1:46:48] it says he taught me also and said unto
[1:46:51] me let I nod retained my words keep my
[1:46:55] Commandments and live they stay under
[1:46:58] his leadership you'll do what you want
[1:47:01] to do don't do what your family wants to
[1:47:03] do you do what God wants you to do and
[1:47:06] it says get wisdom get understanding
[1:47:10] therefore the says wisdom is the
[1:47:14] principal thing Holy Ghost wisdom amen
[1:47:20] and it says get wisdom and with all thy
[1:47:25] getting get understanding and it says
[1:47:28] take fast soul of instruction letter not
[1:47:32] go keeper for she is thy life amen and
[1:47:36] amen
[1:47:37] how many you want to come under and make
[1:47:39] sure that you're under God's leadership
[1:47:41] now make sure
[1:47:42] oh well God's leading me cause me know
[1:47:44] me out but he God's going to lead you
[1:47:46] through the fivefold ministry it's like
[1:47:49] the brother when mother Branham told the
[1:47:50] brother that he you know you need need
[1:47:53] to be sit under a minute teaching
[1:47:54] ministry to be taught the word oh he
[1:47:57] said I don't need no teacher he said I
[1:47:59] got the Holy Ghost he teaches me the
[1:48:01] word well the problem of God said you're
[1:48:03] right but he said the Holy Ghost uses
[1:48:05] the teacher because he felt he didn't
[1:48:10] need the teacher because the Holy Ghost
[1:48:12] was gonna do it the scripture said this
[1:48:14] scripture said that the prophecy that's
[1:48:16] right but he said the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:48:18] he does it through the ministry a man
[1:48:20] and yet there's so many believers out
[1:48:23] there living for themselves they don't
[1:48:25] feel they got any it didn't need for any
[1:48:27] ministry as I said when I knelt at that
[1:48:29] altar years ago and that person next to
[1:48:32] me said old thank you Lord for bringing
[1:48:33] us out of the denomination and now we
[1:48:36] don't have to be under any man that was
[1:48:39] the mistake and I said Lord I said they
[1:48:42] don't have the revelation I said have
[1:48:46] mercy that's right they feel that we
[1:48:50] don't have to be subject to this
[1:48:51] ministry that ministry God has set in
[1:48:53] the church these god help us
[1:48:58] that's that's the false teaching of
[1:49:01] Christianity or you know now you're free
[1:49:03] it's just you and Jesus you and Jesus I
[1:49:05] tell you if it's you and Jesus Jesus is
[1:49:07] with you in the ministry see a teacher
[1:49:11] yes said in the church the fight for
[1:49:15] ministry god help us brother but he
[1:49:19] instead of coming under her husband's
[1:49:22] leadership
[1:49:23] she came under the Serpent's leadership
[1:49:32] and the servants it out of the woman you
[1:49:34] shall not surely die
[1:49:35] and God doesn't know that in the day ye
[1:49:37] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:49:39] opened and ye shall be as God's knowing
[1:49:41] good and evil now he's putting the
[1:49:46] question on God God knows but he hadn't
[1:49:49] told you this God's told us what we need
[1:49:52] to know well we don't need to know he
[1:49:55] don't eat he's not gonna tell us where's
[1:49:58] faith faith is believing the revealed
[1:50:01] word what God reveals what we need to
[1:50:03] know amen and when the woman saw that
[1:50:08] the tree was good for food it was
[1:50:12] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:50:15] desired to make one wise just think of
[1:50:19] it and she took out the fruit thereof
[1:50:24] and did eat and gave also to her husband
[1:50:26] with her and he did eat and the eyes of
[1:50:30] them both were opened and they knew that
[1:50:33] they were naked they sewed fig leaves
[1:50:35] together and made themselves aprons and
[1:50:39] it's the same thing in this day an hour
[1:50:41] brother that many are under the
[1:50:44] deception of Satan's leadership but yet
[1:50:51] so close to the word that it would
[1:50:54] deceive the very elect amen
[1:51:00] just to bring to your remembrance again
[1:51:04] and this is the truth he said take heed
[1:51:09] that no man deceive you be careful oh
[1:51:15] that's a message preacher that's a
[1:51:17] message Pragya but be careful they could
[1:51:20] preach 99% of the message and 1% not the
[1:51:26] message they could preach a hundred
[1:51:29] percent of the message and still add one
[1:51:33] percent add this to add that to it I'll
[1:51:38] tell it as many many believers are being
[1:51:40] deceived
[1:51:45] take heed that no man deceive you for
[1:51:48] many shall come in my name saying I am
[1:51:53] Christ and shall deceive many amen and
[1:51:59] again he said and because iniquity shall
[1:52:02] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:52:07] didn't say there was no love but it's
[1:52:11] cold it waxes cold the believers don't
[1:52:17] have the love they used to have not back
[1:52:21] years ago no not there
[1:52:25] very very few believers have it please
[1:52:29] let's be on our guard by eternity if you
[1:52:32] got his leadership in your life you got
[1:52:33] his love if he's in control you got I
[1:52:37] pray I'll tell you this he if he's in
[1:52:40] control love is his nature God is love
[1:52:46] praise the Lord because iniquity shall
[1:52:52] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:52:55] Nick woody unbelief doubt you know not
[1:52:59] saying they're guilty of this like I did
[1:53:01] like I preach you're going to hell not
[1:53:03] because of what you did because of what
[1:53:05] you didn't do
[1:53:07] that's right
[1:53:09] and Jesus highlighted that I preached on
[1:53:12] that going to hell because of what you
[1:53:14] didn't do
[1:53:15] jesus said in it's just as much you
[1:53:17] didn't do it to the least of my brethren
[1:53:19] you didn't do it to me
[1:53:21] he said therefore he said depart from me
[1:53:23] and durable lasting fire they went to
[1:53:26] hell because of what they didn't do
[1:53:28] their spirit wasn't right their attitude
[1:53:31] wasn't right amen
[1:53:36] but he said he that shall endure he
[1:53:39] endure these things to the end the same
[1:53:41] shall be saved
[1:53:44] it's a lot to endure it's not not easy
[1:53:49] oh no it's not it's not going to be
[1:53:52] getting getting better and better better
[1:53:53] it's going to get harder and harder and
[1:53:55] harder listen as it was for Jesus so
[1:54:00] it's going to be worth for us it's gonna
[1:54:01] get harder and harder and harder you
[1:54:04] know the probably God said it's in the
[1:54:06] church age book and he said he said now
[1:54:08] we're gonna stay here the Lord is gonna
[1:54:10] leave us there for a season four little
[1:54:12] yawns ooh we're gonna witness some of
[1:54:14] that Great Tribulation what for he
[1:54:16] should to try the testing and the trial
[1:54:18] of your faith to prove your faith the
[1:54:26] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[1:54:27] in all the world as a witness unto all
[1:54:31] nations and then shall the end come but
[1:54:36] he said except those days should be
[1:54:37] shortened there should no flesh be saved
[1:54:40] but for the elects sake those days shall
[1:54:42] be shortened and praise the name of the
[1:54:45] Lord go with me to Jude the book of Jude
[1:54:54] right next to Revelation there's and
[1:54:57] don't it's only one chapter
[1:55:09] praise the Lord verse 5 I will therefore
[1:55:16] put you in remembrance amen another
[1:55:24] place he's saying oh I going to bring
[1:55:25] this back to your remembrance though ye
[1:55:30] once knew this how they're the Lord
[1:55:33] having saved the people out of the land
[1:55:35] of Egypt afterward destroyed them that
[1:55:39] believed not amen and the angels which
[1:55:45] kept not their first estate but left
[1:55:49] their own habitation he had reserved in
[1:55:52] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[1:55:55] the judgment of the great day and even
[1:56:00] as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities
[1:56:02] about them in like manner he said giving
[1:56:07] themselves over to fornication and going
[1:56:09] after strange flesh are set for an
[1:56:14] example suffering the Vengeance of
[1:56:17] eternal fire as I said before concerning
[1:56:21] all this going on in the earth I said
[1:56:24] the fire is falling fire small yeah
[1:56:31] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:56:34] defile the flesh despise the minion
[1:56:39] speak evil of dignities and the
[1:56:42] dignities are the glorious glorious ones
[1:56:44] or the glorified ones and they speak
[1:56:47] evil yet Michael the Archangel when
[1:56:53] contending with the devil he disputed
[1:56:56] about the body of Moses he Durst not
[1:57:00] bring against him a Radian accusation
[1:57:02] but said the Lord rebuke thee keep your
[1:57:05] attitude rate your spirit rate and even
[1:57:08] Michael the Archangel kept his attitude
[1:57:10] and his spirit right toward the devil
[1:57:12] yea he rebuked him but the Lord he said
[1:57:18] the Lord rebuke thee a man it's in the
[1:57:22] hands of God
[1:57:23] but these be evil of those things which
[1:57:27] they knew not but what they know
[1:57:30] naturally as brute beasts in these
[1:57:32] things they corrupt themselves god elvis
[1:57:36] wall unto them for they have gone in the
[1:57:40] way of cain a man yeah he's talking
[1:57:44] about believers professing believers a
[1:57:48] man they got in the way of cain what oh
[1:57:55] yeah there's a lot of believers would
[1:57:56] would with challenged God as Cain
[1:57:58] challenged him thou shalt disbelievers
[1:58:02] as Cain challenged God you know it's the
[1:58:08] way of Cain and they says they have ran
[1:58:12] greedily and the way of Cain is opposing
[1:58:18] God's thoughts god's ideas cause
[1:58:21] leadership and it says and they have run
[1:58:27] greedily after the error of Balaam for
[1:58:30] reward
[1:58:31] yea the error of Balaam human reasoning
[1:58:37] a lot of people playing human reasoning
[1:58:40] to the word they are and that's why
[1:58:45] they're doing this to do this do this do
[1:58:47] that your mother we don't reason see we
[1:58:51] believe with a complete belief and
[1:58:52] there's no question no doubt no
[1:58:54] reasoning now if you got faith let's not
[1:59:00] be guilty of the way of Cain let's not
[1:59:03] be guilty of the error of balaam human
[1:59:06] reasoning for reward and perished in the
[1:59:09] gainsaying of korah denying god's
[1:59:12] authority and those spirits are still
[1:59:20] working among believers yeah they're
[1:59:23] opposing God's leadership in certain
[1:59:28] areas of their lives they and and
[1:59:32] they're denying and said we don't well I
[1:59:33] don't think lore don't mind this I don't
[1:59:35] think the Lord mind that let's forget it
[1:59:38] don't have to think
[1:59:40] just ignore it amen
[1:59:45] let's not deny God's authority in Gaza
[1:59:48] leadership in all circumstances and
[1:59:51] let's not give ourselves over to human
[1:59:54] reasoning as did Balaam and these are
[2:00:01] spots in your feasts of charity when
[2:00:03] they feast with you and feeding
[2:00:05] themselves without fear yeah feeding
[2:00:09] themselves without fear where's the fear
[2:00:11] of God in your life where's the fear of
[2:00:14] God in your heart your soul today that
[2:00:19] people are fearing made more than if
[2:00:20] you're God that's right there brother
[2:00:24] I'm sick of this whole world and sick of
[2:00:26] the politics of this whole world it's
[2:00:28] not normal no more absolutely not normal
[2:00:31] back years ago the politicians were
[2:00:34] normal and this was normal that was
[2:00:35] normal Anat anymore it's all insane the
[2:00:39] world has gone insane and the problem
[2:00:41] God warned us that the world was going
[2:00:43] insane and it is insane I pray God you
[2:00:48] recognize it don't let that spirit of
[2:00:50] insanity get
[2:00:50] you a man and there are believers who
[2:00:56] have their spirit and sanity on them God
[2:00:58] have mercy bear with me there's a lot of
[2:01:02] scriptures that I had but we won't get
[2:01:04] to them all
[2:01:05] go with me to numbers the Book of
[2:01:10] Numbers
[2:01:16] chapter 27 I just give you a couple of
[2:01:22] scriptures and then some quotes
[2:01:36] not here - sir - people with emotional
[2:01:38] preaching but err to get you to get the
[2:01:41] Holy Ghost to you with the revelation of
[2:01:43] the word a man there sometimes preachers
[2:01:47] did or they can stir you emotionally but
[2:01:50] not spiritually yeah if we get stir it
[2:01:53] up stir it up stir it up as all emotion
[2:01:55] yeah but why would the Holy Ghost is he
[2:01:58] stirring you and he stirs you by faith
[2:02:01] by revelation hey man
[2:02:04] grace in numbers 27 and verse 15 and God
[2:02:13] spake unto the Lord
[2:02:19] Moses speak unto the Lord saying let the
[2:02:22] Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh
[2:02:26] set a man over the congregation which
[2:02:30] may go out before him and which may go
[2:02:33] in before him and which may lead them
[2:02:36] out and bring them in he said that the
[2:02:41] congregation of the Lord be not as sheep
[2:02:45] which have no shepherd if she got
[2:02:49] anything it's a leader and it's
[2:02:52] following leadership oh yeah
[2:02:55] so it says again said a man over the
[2:03:02] congregation a man yeah led and it says
[2:03:09] this man it says which may go out before
[2:03:13] them and which may go in before them and
[2:03:16] which may lead them out and bring them
[2:03:19] in that the congregation of the Lord be
[2:03:22] not as sheep which have no shepherd
[2:03:24] brother as it was in the Old Covenant
[2:03:27] source in the New Covenant God had
[2:03:29] shepherds oh yeah they were sheep then
[2:03:35] were sheep now she bad shepherds then
[2:03:39] the Sheep got shepherds now and the
[2:03:41] Shepherd was to lead them according to
[2:03:43] the word then and the Shepherd's to lead
[2:03:45] us according to the word now
[2:03:48] amen and the Lord said unto Moses take
[2:03:52] the Joshua the son of nun a man in whom
[2:03:55] is the spirit and lay thy hand upon him
[2:03:58] and set him before Eleazar the priest
[2:04:00] and before all the congregation and give
[2:04:04] him a charge in their sight the
[2:04:08] responsibility of the will of God and
[2:04:10] thou shalt but some of them some of them
[2:04:13] honour upon him that all the
[2:04:16] congregation of the children of Israel
[2:04:17] may be obedient and he shall stand
[2:04:21] before Eliezer
[2:04:23] Eliezer rather the priest who shall ask
[2:04:27] counsel for him after the judgment of
[2:04:30] Urim before the Lord and his words shall
[2:04:32] they go out and his words shall they
[2:04:36] come in a man praise the Lord
[2:04:40] both II and all the soldiers are with
[2:04:43] him and even all the congregation amen
[2:04:47] and Moses did as the LORD commanded him
[2:04:50] and he took Joshua the son they set him
[2:04:53] before Eleazar the priest before all the
[2:04:56] congregation praise the name of the Lord
[2:04:58] and he laid his hands upon him and gave

[2:10:22] control but for a lot of believers Satan
[2:10:25] God is not in control I'll tell you
[2:10:27] Devils in control because your your your
[2:10:33] natural birth you're born in sin so
[2:10:36] Satan's in control of your own nature
[2:10:38] your feelings and so on but with Jesus
[2:10:41] you got to be born again

[2:11:10] he said bursaries again and he humbled
[2:11:15] thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed
[2:11:17] them with manna which thou knewest not
[2:11:19] and neither did thy fathers know that he
[2:11:23] might make thee know that man does not
[2:11:26] live by bread only but by every word
[2:11:28] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[2:11:31] Lord does man live by Raymond wax not
[2:11:34] all upon thee neither thy foot swell
[2:11:37] these forty years and thou shalt also
[2:11:40] consider in thine heart that as a man
[2:11:43] tasted his son so the LORD thy God
[2:11:45] chaste knit date amen therefore thou
[2:11:51] shalt keep the commandments of the LORD
[2:11:53] thy God to walk in his ways and to fear
[2:11:57] him god help us that were under that
[2:12:00] leadership that brings us under his
[2:12:03] control
[2:12:04] a man with his wisdom in the message on
[2:12:10] choosing a bride he should remember now
[2:12:15] he said a man in his way for one he said
[2:12:18] will you join yourself to a person like
[2:12:20] that if you would it would certainly
[2:12:22] kind of disappoint my faith in you
[2:12:28] then all about God joining himself to
[2:12:31] something like that a regular
[2:12:33] denominational prostitute he said do you
[2:12:36] think that he would do it
[2:12:37] he said having a form of godliness and
[2:12:39] denying the power thereof he would never
[2:12:42] do it he said she must and his character
[2:12:45] in Earth man must have his character in
[2:12:49] her and the real true born-again Church
[2:12:51] must have the character that was in
[2:12:54] Christ amen so what am I looking at
[2:13:00] brothers he's a brother Jesus sister
[2:13:04] Jesus why because the character I've
[2:13:08] seen is it's a character of Jesus it's
[2:13:12] not dad's character mom's character the
[2:13:14] grandmas and grandpas know their new
[2:13:17] creatures they were like mom and dad but
[2:13:19] they're not laid no more wood they used
[2:13:21] to act like mom and dad
[2:13:23] my mom and dad and no not anymore why
[2:13:26] now it's Jesus you know mom and dad was
[2:13:31] our leader but with yeah the teacher was
[2:13:33] a leader but now it's Christ oh yeah
[2:13:37] well we would respond to the wave what
[2:13:39] no we mom and dad would want us to
[2:13:41] respond or the way that the the teacher
[2:13:43] want us to respond not now now it's
[2:13:46] Jesus he's taking control amen
[2:13:51] and he said the character the real true
[2:13:54] born-again Church must have the
[2:13:56] character that was in Christ because the
[2:13:58] husband and wife are one amen and he
[2:14:03] said if Jesus did only that which please
[2:14:05] God and he said kept his word and
[2:14:08] manifested his word see not just to keep
[2:14:12] the word manifest to work he said his
[2:14:16] right will have to be the same kind of
[2:14:19] character as the breakroom this is
[2:14:23] amazing he said that it's too bad that
[2:14:28] we ever get away from real leader he
[2:14:32] said the real leader he said that God
[2:14:34] left us to lead the church he never said
[2:14:37] state procedures he never said a bishop
[2:14:39] a cardinal a priest or a pope he said he
[2:14:42] sent the Holy Ghost for the church to
[2:14:45] lead the church and when he the Holy
[2:14:48] Ghost has come he will lead you into all
[2:14:51] truth he will reveal these things to you
[2:14:53] that I've told you and bring them to
[2:14:56] your remembrance and we'll show you
[2:14:57] things that is to come amen
[2:15:01] these are the people of today he said
[2:15:04] choosing modern denominations and he
[2:15:06] said what it does it only reflects their
[2:15:08] poor understanding of the word get
[2:15:12] wisdom and get understanding but the
[2:15:15] right understanding and the way that
[2:15:17] they're acting today reacting today amen
[2:15:21] approach they have poor understanding of
[2:15:24] the Word of God
[2:15:26] and there's a lot of message believers
[2:15:29] they don't understand the message the
[2:15:30] way they should message is not in
[2:15:33] control the message is not in
[2:15:35] not their leaders no no it's the reveal
[2:15:39] word and this will be your leader oh
[2:15:42] it's the Holy Ghost is my leader but
[2:15:44] he's gonna lead you according to the
[2:15:46] word it's the poor understanding of the
[2:15:52] word and he said I don't mean to hurt
[2:15:54] but I mean to let it go deep enough so
[2:15:57] that you will look at it and amen god
[2:16:01] help us there with me just a couple
[2:16:05] folks these were made for Christ Christ
[2:16:11] wasn't made for us we are made for him
[2:16:15] and that is what we try to do today in
[2:16:18] our text books is try to make the word
[2:16:20] which is Christ
[2:16:21] suit us instead of us trying to make
[2:16:25] ourselves to suit the word amen
[2:16:31] he says be in Christ oh yeah I said make
[2:16:36] the word which is Christ suit us there
[2:16:40] Amen that's right
[2:16:42] let God be in control it's not you it's
[2:16:45] God in control
[2:16:46] it's not you well I'll do that the words
[2:16:48] that says I'll do this I'll do that no
[2:16:50] no if it's Christ in you it's not you
[2:16:52] doing it it's him doing it and that's
[2:16:55] what the problem is bringing out and he
[2:16:58] said it's it's Christ in you he should
[2:17:01] bring you in line with the word it's not
[2:17:03] you bringing yourself in line with the
[2:17:05] word then once you've been born again he
[2:17:09] takes over by the grace of God a man a
[2:17:14] man and a man praise the Lord
[2:17:27] listen
[2:17:30] he said this is exactly where the church
[2:17:32] stands today sold or word given
[2:17:36] character to Satan for our scientific
[2:17:39] man-made religion when she had the light
[2:17:42] at the right as the Church of God to
[2:17:45] stay with the word and have the Holy
[2:17:47] Ghost working amongst welding the body
[2:17:50] together with the word welding the body
[2:17:53] together with the love of God a man and
[2:17:57] a man and a man remember he said the
[2:18:03] true Church of Christ the bride his soul
[2:18:07] sold out to him and his promised word
[2:18:10] tell every mind that is in Christ is in
[2:18:13] you the modern church world church also

[2:18:22] pregnant to give birth to sons one of
[2:18:25] them a denominational birth is going to
[2:18:28] give one of these days at World Council
[2:18:31] of Churches which will produce to the
[2:18:34] world the Antichrist through a
[2:18:36] denomination brother let's not oh yeah
[2:18:42] it's amazing that the spirit of
[2:18:45] Antichrist is around the message oh no
[2:18:50] oh yes it is because I tell you a lot of
[2:18:54] believers got the same spirit as they do
[2:18:56] out there in denominations and the
[2:18:57] probably God I lighted that he and
[2:18:59] there's a quote summer I don't know
