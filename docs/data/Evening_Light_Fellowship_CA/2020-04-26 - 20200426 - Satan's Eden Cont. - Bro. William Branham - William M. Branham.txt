TRANSCRIPT
========================================
fivefold ministry will be pointing to the people and the bride on to the resurrection and the rapture whatever they're preaching is to create a greater hunger and a greater thirst for the resurrection and the rapture amen and if the Ministry of the word is not creating that in us then there's something wrong somewhere amen it's not just focusing on this and on that no no we when it comes to these doctrines and this over that brought us out of denomination what we're out now so now we've got to preach the word to get in by the grace of God and to get to create in the end the Saints a hunger and thirst to get out of time and into eternity by the grace of Almighty God he said remember I preached on God hidden and revealed in humility in simplicity and he said you Millett II he said always said don't forget that and he said remember when God predicts anything great to happen the people are going to so far away by their wisdom till they'll miss what happens that's right don't depend on ourselves just keep trusting the Lord and seeking the revelation of the resurrection rapture I'm green thirsting for it and if you're humming a thirsty for it God is there to give it to us by grace he wants that that's what girls look for in us do you want the resurrection do you want the right oh yes Lord what do you see what you're not hungry for it you're not thirsting for it if you're wanted you hunger for thirst for pray for it call for it look for it morning noon and night day in day of grace of God be with us amen there are other quotes in the seal book we'll leave God have mercy on us and help us is my prayer that we'll want to get out of Satan's eat let's not be numbered with those that the prophets said right here and I know we'll remember this or not but he said it's the truth he said listen he said to see the deceitfulness of the enemy he said we never had a day like this day that we are now living that's true it is the most cunning deceitful day he said when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toes today he said then he ever was in any age oh yeah because this is the end it's now or never oh yeah it's nice I'm moving on what God's going to do this no it goes finished it so great grace of God to get out of here into glory so be on your toes more because it's the most deceiving of all ages be on your toes and he said but now the cunningness of the devil now makes the people to believe that they are Christians when they are not and he making people believe they're believers when they're not why again I've mentioned it a few times recently where the problem of God said he said you are in the message but the message is not in you I pray grace that the message is in us us here the message is in those on line by the grace of Almighty God amen to God be the glory hallelujah let the musicians come and we're saying I love it return to our brother Bob raised the name of the Lord hallelujah amen there was a quote here I don't have it marked regarding about something to prophecy concerning the rapture he said the rapture is going on right now and he said the bride is being raptured or being caught away from this world and we're being caught into the rapture it was tremendous well I find that another time I'll share with the priests shared with it with the Saints amen Gracie oh he said here third seal he said the bride as an added revival yet there has been no revival no manifestation of God to stir the bride we're looking for it and look was it gonna take we got it now he said it will take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up again the bride hallelujah he will send it he promised it a man and his two at what is to wake the bright up and to give her the hunger thirst that she needs at this hour by the grace of God to get out of here god bless amen let's keep pressing on amen we're not going to stop we're gonna keep moving out by God's grace the Lord blesses and as to much longer we'll go on

great friend and I love this family Oh amen so falsely made they've taken me into their heart I'm so glad to be this brave amen I'm glad to be a part of the family to bless the Lord and I would say this that I was here the other day just working on defense and voter Chad and it's just early I pulled off as they saw me today they pulled up and one of the things that stood out we had in conversation probably a short period of time but it was it showed something brother Branham talked about and what you talked about too is that is the longing for each other and that's what really stood out in that conversation and I sense that that love and they were so glad to see a believer they were so glad to see somebody from the church and and the longing that I felt from the two of them was it was really strong and I said that's right that's exactly right and I've been thinking about that ever since and you know when we do see each other because we've been apart so much and they're longing gets stronger and and in talking to people over the phone the book that the believers over the phone the longing is getting stronger every day to come back and get in the house of God and worship so it really stood out God really showed me that that's what brother Graham said about you know people crying because they're not gonna see each other until the next service and that's what I came back to me you know so but I got rebuked though because Jared Jeremiah said I wasn't six feet apart from other chant don't I had i've been rebuked right so I'm heaven I gotta apologize in advance to the musicians but I'm having a brother mark moment here I don't know if you know one of you guys might know it's just a chorus is 810 updater man and it's ending I think it's in the record of D but
