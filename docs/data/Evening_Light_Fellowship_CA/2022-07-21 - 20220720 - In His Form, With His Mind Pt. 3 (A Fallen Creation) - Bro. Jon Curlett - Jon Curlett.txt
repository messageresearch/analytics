brother random did say that when the bride figures out who she is finds out who she is and the rapture will go but i realized that god knows who we are and the devil knows who we are there's only us left right one more just to bribe right and god will give us that victory over the devil the devil is trying to stop us but god will lead us into that rapture because he's going to have his bride no matter what he's going to have his pride who i am lord let's sing it oh glorious victory that day he set me free and he made my heart his very throne thank you lord my life is [Music] amen [Music] who

surrender lord a plane where we become less and you become more in our lives heavenly father lord may that song not just be something we say in church lord accompanied by music lord but may it be something that comes out of our heart every single day heavenly father lord that we would be recognizing lord the unity of christ in us lord that we would be able to see lord the word may manifest lord the word may flesh once or more in our day heavenly father lord it didn't stop with you it didn't stop with your prophets lord i didn't stop with a prophet in this day but lord you come down to be tabernacled in flesh among sons and daughters lord manifested by the falling of your holy spirit to bring us to a place of perfection lord under that righteousness of christ so lord we pray that you administer to each heart and soul that's here lord those that are online as well lord may you just speak into our lives lord draw us closer we pray lord forgive us forgive me where we fall short lord lord help us to just rededicate and commit our lives to you we pray in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen god bless you this evening if you'll turn the scriptures to genesis 6 thank you musicians i'm in genesis chapter 6 certainly want to welcome our visitors it feels a bit like special meetings amen we got a full church and we got people that aren't usually here and whatnot so it feels a little bit like acts too you know where they added to the church daily such as were needed we had some go out we had some come in so certainly thankful for that amen to have my sister jessica and her husband jonathan and silas and alexander here and then brother aaron and sister lydia oglesby and most of you know he's also a minister so lord willing he'll preach for us on sunday so we want to keep him and the services and prayer of course and then we'll also be having the fellowship of brother marks at four o'clock on sunday afternoon so just be in prayer for that amen i don't believe god sends us a gift without a purpose so if we got a minister coming here on vacation then i believe god sends him with a message for the people that he's vacationing with amen so we're trusting that god will be with you brother aaron amen genesis chapter 6 and verse 1 says and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be in hundred and twenty years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in under the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and have repented the lord that he had made men on the earth and it grieved him at his heart amen god bless you you can take your seats this evening and then we want to continue on this little series we've been preaching on called in his form and with his mind and i want to uh just do maybe a quick recap for those that are joining us like i said with every service i preached we've had somebody else come in new it seems so we've been preaching about the unveiling of god and we we started out how how god was it was the great spirit the great uh jehovah the self-existing one and and then he out of that he he brought out of himself a light and he stepped into that light and that light was called the son of god and it was the the presence of god dwelling in that light and it was visible so that his creation could see him and interact with him in these different things and and the nature and life of god was within that and we saw it in the many different forms from that original light which was the pillar of fire and then we saw it come down into melchizedek and the lord that spoke with abraham and we saw it in the the fourth man in the fire and we saw it again as the pillar of fire after knocked paul off of his horse and and brother brahm says that's the only god we're ever going to see is when it's manifested in the son of god amen it is the life of god inside of an outside form and we read the quote where brother branham says when that logos came out of him it said he took on his first form right what there are many forms that he would take on in in his purpose and in his plan but the first one was light and he says he always goes back to light when he comes out of one form or another but that form we call is the son of god and that's jesus christ it's the anointed one and that is the only god we'll ever see jesus said to philip he says philip if you've seen me you've seen the father right amen and then paul said the son declares the father i mean that's the only thing that we're going to see of god ever is in the sun and that's that's why we worship jesus is that's why we pray to him not just because he's the intercessor but that's the form that god has put himself into for us to to to worship in him and we don't believe in the trinity we know godhead is way different than anybody else believes in it and we're not going to go into that but we understand that the son is the expression of the father amen and that is his first and his original form and then then we saw the path how that adam as a son of god was created in god's image and it was first in spirit form and in that spirit form he couldn't see feel here touch in the way that he could naturally later on and nature could not see him that his the very creation that was made for him could have no interaction with him now brother brown says he could lead the animals as the holy spirit would lead in what invisibly that they wouldn't be able to see him but he could cause things to be influenced in the earth but he says then god put him into a body that he could interact with his creation with nature with as well so adam's following the same trajectory as the son of god as god himself followed and then he went from spirit form into a body visible form that could interact with with with his nature and with the creation and he did that because he had a purpose because god created a place for adam and we know that he was placed on the earth but he wasn't just placed on the earth but it says god planted a garden eastward for adam specifically and he took them and he placed them in that garden of eden and he was to have dominion over the earth and we saw that that didn't just mean over the animals but that was over the elements of the earth itself and in that position he was perfect and in that position he had the very same power that jesus christ had on this earth we see that luke records adam and in his lineage it says and adam was what the son of god there's only two that were ever called the son of god in the scripture until he comes up to paul talking about us and that is adam and that is jesus christ now we see here it says sons of god in genesis 6 but they're in a fallen condition but in their original condition the original condition adam was just like jesus christ was because why christ was the second adam adam was the first son of god that was put into flesh form and jesus was the second one but he was following the same trajectory that god did amen but we saw how adam had lost his position by tying himself to his fallen bride and he trusted that the nature that tied him to her was the same thing that was in god in the beginning and that god would tie himself to his fallen creation and find a way to bring them back amen he chose to accompany his bride into death separation from god so that what god would do the work that he he couldn't do in himself amen then we showed how he felt because she started what conversing as an equal with something that was under her dominion i mean that something that was beneath her that something that wasn't supposed to be able to to that wasn't even under the law that god gave her was sitting there and started to talk to her about it and fellowship with her and in the end he seduced her and he turned her mind completely opposite to what god said but it started when she had a conversation with something that was under her feet and then she hid it from her husband and she hid it from god because in the cool of the evening he come down and brother abraham says he'd he'd sit down under the tree and they'd lay their head on his lap and he'd stroke their head and he'd lay them to sleep and there would be that peace that passes all understanding in his presence and she never mentioned that she was having this conversation she never mentioned it to her husband who was supposed to be in unity with her and she never mentioned it to the god that told her not to do it in the first place and in doing so she fell because we know that seduction was over time it did not happen in one conversation did not happen in one moment but she kept it a secret from her husband and in doing so she allowed herself to fall out of the way amen but we started this whole scripture and or this whole series in philippians where we read that paul said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself the first thing that the mind of christ does for you is it humbles you to a purpose amen he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross but as we come back now to genesis 6 we see that adam had the mind of christ in the beginning amen he had the mind of christ and the prophet god says adam could not be turned adam could not be moved from that because what he was a part of the original creation he was the one that god had originally spoken to and he held firm to that and he had no time to talk to the serpent no doubt maybe the serpent tribe we don't really know but we know that it never had an effect on adam he stayed apart from it amen but eve when she started listening to another voice started getting pulled away man and when she fell and adam joined himself they lost three things now go through this quickly because we covered it four but the first thing they lost was eternal life and they lost it immediately because as soon as she sinned and as soon as adam joined her what happened they became fearful and they created a covering for something that they didn't know they had before which was nakedness amen the very first thing that came in was fear and we know that perfect love casts out fear we know that god is love and so the very thing that left them was love and the thing that replaced it was fear and it drove them into what deeper into the garden because they were scared of one thing and that was the presence of god amen they were scared of the presence of god they weren't just scared that he would find out but they were scared now to come into his presence and that's the first thing that having their mind take on a different a different tune was that it drew them away from the presence of god and what the love had to depart from out of their lives and now fear came in we don't know if we can go in his presence then they lost dominion in the presence of god he declared judgment on the man he says now you're going to have to sweat for it now you don't get to have spoken word authority now you don't get to speak to the elements now you don't get to tell the wind raise up here and drop down here in these different things but he says now you're gonna have to sweat just to live before he could just move it around before he could do whatever he wanted everything was given god said for him and he didn't have to strive for it but now he had to strive for these things and then the third thing he lost was fellowship with god because as soon as god pronounced judgment what happened was a cherubim with a flaming sword drove them out of the presence of god and he guarded that tree of life now with a flaming sword now what was that flaming sword the sword is always the word isn't it amen and it was a flaming sword and what did the law do the law kept them out of the presence of god it declared that they were ineligible to come into the presence of god except that one man once a year out of all the millions of israelites it guarded them from what the christ the anointed one it guarded them from the presence of god and so they had to come out now and and being creatures that were originally supernatural now they come into the natural outside of the presence of god and they've got to figure out how to make a living they've got to figure out how this whole thing works amen so if we're ever to get back to our original position then all three of these things have to come back we have to get eternal life back we have to get fellowship back and we have to get dominion otherwise we're not in our original condition amen now i believe adam and eve recognize this because we see when we're reading here in genesis 6 that the sons of god kept themselves pure for a while and when i say pure i mean they kept their bloodline pure because we know what the original sin was amen the serpent seed as we know and so they kept their bloodline pure you had the sons of men and you had the sons of god and the sons of men were what they were the original flesh that was blended with what the serpent so it was an impure line and they were called men there but they were sons of god on the other side that adam and eve and their lineage would have kept themselves pure from satan's line from cain's lineage and so they held themselves back for a while but as we look in genesis 6 1 it says and it came to pass that men when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all that they chose now notice we have two different groups we have sons of god and daughters of men now before that we definitely had daughters of god and that's who the sons of god would marry they'd marry daughters of god wouldn't they and they keep the line pure but there came a time that they did for a while they wouldn't mix they wouldn't mingle i think they learned perhaps from adam and eve that we don't mingle with that they understood what the original sin was and then they understood what had happened in that garden and so they kept themselves from that but after a while what happened they started to blend in prophet of god says that god kept them separate that they had somehow tied themselves to this idea that if we can keep our line pure maybe he'll come back and redeem us but they could only keep it for so long because why they were outside of the presence of god they were in a fallen condition and though they didn't realize it yet they haven't even experienced death yet in many cases yet they were in a fallen condition and there was nothing going to keep them moving forward into the presence of god again amen there was something that was going to have to happen amen but in that separation from cain's lineage they were as pure as you could ever get on this earth since the fall we're way beyond them now and we'll see it by the scriptures why but brother brandon puts it this way he says god had to separate cain's people from cess people he sent cain away he separated them so he could deal with his church he says now watch god separated eve's evil cain from adam's holy seth oh how did he do it through oh did he do it he says through an unlawful act this woman living with somebody else and brought a child god separated that child and his generations from righteous and holy man his children then he says it's the same thing today separating separated so he takes you out and then he keeps you aside doesn't he separating separated found them they were not in unity he says they can have no unity can night have unity with day can a believer have unity with an infidel can a man who believes in all the word of god have a unity with them who just believes part of the word of god he says god wants separators he said before that what to to get the token he says god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief but what happened was they started to do what they started to mix up and what did they do they looked over the fence didn't they that's always what gets us in trouble is when we start to look over the fence and see what other people are doing and what other people have and whether that might work for me that's always the problem is we get wandering eyes the grass is always greener on the other side and it's curiosity often that pulls us to the other way right and what did it lead to it led to a greater falling away they were in sin but now it led to what them doing the very thing that eve had done with the serpent they went right back to the very thing that drove them out of the presence of god in the first place but the battle says he says now cain was eve's son she said i have gotten a son he said but seth was adam's son and god separated them because they'd corrupt one another cain's evil children would corrupt cess good children that's right he says now watch and the same old devil that caused eve to disbelieve one word of god and told them to separate themselves from one another and to live different each one that same devil has got among them and brought them together again he says did you get it he says he brought them together under a false union an act against god's plan amen what is it blending the ideas or the appearance of what man thinks is good with what god thinks is good every time amen but i want you to notice here that we don't see the daughters of god looking at the sons of men i believe eve taught them really well don't go there i went there we're not supposed to go there that's why we're in the fall this is just me speaking i don't have a quote for it or anything but we never see the daughters of god falling away here initially amen but it was the sons of god that fell adam stayed pure he joined eve to join you know to stay with her but but he didn't follow by deception but yet here we see them falling by what something else he couldn't keep them pure what is it they're falling away from their original position more and more and more it's a progressive thing but when they start to slide we see how fast they start to slide amen reminds me that if we get out of the presence of god nothing good is going to happen is it amen we can be raised in good families we can be raised in a pastor's home or preacher's home we can be raised in a wonderful message church with wonderful anointed services and ministry and songs but if you aren't in the presence of god daily then something's going to happen between wednesdays and sundays isn't it when you get out then satan's going to start to work on you and he's going to start to blend in and you're going to start to have problems now blending in at church aren't you because he's got five days to work on you and god's only got you for the two that you're committing to him right we've got to stick with him day in and day out we're looking to practice the presence of god continually day in and day out not just on wednesdays and sundays prophet of god said it grieved the heart of god when he looked upon them in the days before the end of deluvian destruction that he ever made a man he says what happened the sons of god saw the daughters of men were fair it was a perversion the perversion was say was satan in a serpent blending with humanity and they looked at that and said that looks better than what we've got that's a scary place when we say we look at something that's not of god and say that looks better than the pureness that god's given me why because it's never going to appeal to the eye what god gives you right because remember eve saw that it was good to eat and then she took of it didn't she it was the eyes it was the lust of the eyes that drew her in that's not the way god draws us amen we don't look on crisis there's nothing about him it says that we would look on him to desire him amen and if it's that for the flesh it's going to be that for the word in any other way isn't it you're not going to look at it to desire it but there's going to be something in you that's calling you towards it and saying that's for me regardless of what it looks like to the person next to me amen he says it was a perversion it was a sex mix-up it was that thing that drove the children of god from the garden of eden it was that thing that drove god's judgment to bring peace upon the earth it was that thing that caused them destroyed it was that same mixing up between women and men that caused sodom and gomorrh to sink to the bottom of the dead sea every union or marriage that they did was replaying what the very same act that caused them to fail in the very beginning they were just doing it over and over and over again right to god's face they completely turned away from what he said don't do there's one thing he said don't do and they were doing it and doing it and doing it with the very one that had caused them to leave the garden in the first place amen that's what god grieves the most is when you replicate the very sin that kicked you out of his presence in the first place amen and what is it the sin is not sexual fornication it's not what he did but it was unbelief where she and maybe they looked over there and said we need some of that and they forgot that that was the product of what sin and unbelief and separation from god that was the product of separation from god amen but we do that very same thing so often as we look over at somebody else has something that may be speaking more to the young people right now we look at what our old friends used to do or our school friends are doing or we're walking around the mall and we're seeing what they're saying is good and great and wholesome or what is going to be popular or what is trending and we start to say maybe i could take some of that maybe i could take just a little of it i know it's all wrong but maybe i could add a little bit in listen the fashions as they move through should not be messagified if i can make it that way amen we don't go there and say let's put a message spin on a world trend that's never been the purpose of god was to take those things and say let's run it through the filter of the word so we can blend in but still meet the message criteria what are we going back to legalism we're going back to legalism every time amen listen he says the same thing the last quote i read he says the same devil that was working the same demon that was working in the sons of god then are trying to work in the sons of god now and every single man in here that owns a phone that has on social media that has anything to do on the internet knows that he's trying to do that every single day you walk through a mall you can't even look at what's in those stores you can't look at what's posted for advertisements because it's sick sick sick and everything is there trying to turn your head to get you to what not want to come into the presence of god right to get you to the point where you don't recognize you've got a problem and so you're covering it with repentance rather than deliverance amen where you're covering it with what a form of godliness but without the holy ghost to give you the overcoming power you need to get past amen to cause you to turn your head like a son of god will amen listen you don't even have to do anything on your phone or computer these days they have algorithms that will throw stuff at you to see if you'll click to see if you'll look and then what do they do they take you progressively further i can't tell you how many pastors i know you know why pastors are getting into social media so they can see how it works so they can see what their young people are dealing with that's why they're doing it they don't want anything on it but i found out things from ministers on social media that i've never experienced before and he says yeah we're finding out this is what the young people are doing to get past filters and and getting past this and getting past that because we're trying to protect them you know as as parents and whatnot and they're saying we've got to learn how it's working so we can see how they're getting past it that's a scary point when we're trying to figure out how they're actively working to get around the safeguards that we've put in it's the same thing eve did isn't it god put a safeguard in she found her way around it eventually right amen what is it we didn't walk away from the conversation and he's saying sons of god you need to walk away from the conversation you need to walk away from anything that's causing you to pull away from the word of god scripture says look if your eye offends you pluck it out you know what that means that means some men need to get a dumb phone not a smartphone that they can carry anywhere right listen he says it's a sex perversion he says that's the same spirit that's here today to draw the sons of god away why because we're in a sodom and gomorrah condition it's the exact same thing as the end of times it's the end of days for the gentile dispensation that spirit is here today and i don't believe there's a single man in here that doesn't know it that's on a computer because you don't have to leave your home now to get to get tempted you don't have to leave your home to to to help with an addiction you know to feed it you don't have to it's all right there any time you want what is it satan gets a toehold and then he turns it into a stronghold why because you won't go and get that taken care of right away you won't go confess the issue you have and get it taken off of you and like i said we cover it with repentance rather than deliverance god didn't give us the holy ghost so all we did was repent he gave us the holy ghost for what overcoming power amen brother brown says another thing he did back there we noticed it during the time of this great turmoil when men's heart began to wax cold and away from god women became such an idol that's today he says when the sons of god seen the daughters of men they were fair he says it became a sexual order so what men started to be led around by what their hormones and their eyes rather than what god had told them to do and to not do amen what is it they became beasts a brother ron said over the pulpit he says a beast is a man without god because that's what we are we're in beast nature we're we're tied in our blood is no longer pure we've got beast nature all over us don't we there's nothing pure in our bodies so we are a beast without the holy ghost it's the holy ghost that makes us a new creation or a new creature amen but what we saw that men were drawn to the women and then what we've seen is a turnaround now where the women have used that to what weaponize it against men to do what gain influence and power and we see that because what is the mother church it's a woman it's a harlot it's one that has leveraged her beauty to gain position power and influence and it's the same thing that's happening today he says look at it today what we're living in now he says not speaking against honorable women no sir they're god's instruments not just the men that are god's instruments in this bride amen it's women too he says but those who cares not for themself how there is so many on the opposite side going about marrying and giving them marriage god said so in the bible jesus said before noah's time at the end they were marrying and giving in marriage he says how the great turmoil is in the world today and we realized that and one thing that caused that the bible said that the spirits great spirits come down evil spirits and got into those people and done those things and we see the same evil spirits working in our day great spirits two hundred thousand thousand out of the river euphrates now what they were turned on the jews for a short while but now they're focused on the gentile bride because as soon as they go satan's kicked out and he knows his time is short so he's trying to slow this down every way he can every gun in heaven is aimed at one group and that's the bride of jesus christ today great spirits great spirits not little tiny demons these are big ones man brothers these are big ones aren't they we don't just have little battles anymore it ain't just little magazines it ain't just little shows or this it's everywhere anytime you want or he wants amen you're assaulted today with the sensuality of this world amen he says but what he starts to like you look at that and you say that's horrible and if we stop that quote right there you'd say who can stand great spirits who's going to win that every man's fallen since the beginning of time but he says now notice again then not only that he says when all hell turns loose all heaven turns loose also and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against it he says and those two forces is always showed at the junction so if you're at the junction and you're struggling recognize there is a power you haven't tapped into yet there is something beyond what you have grasped or you have a hold of in yourself and it's available to you if you will only look to the right person at that junction amen if the enemy is coming in with a flood that means god has something that can take you past it amen amen he fell at a junction the sons of god fell at a junction brother brown says you're at the same junction again same spirit same great spirits same struggles same trials but he says we've got a different standard now they didn't have a standard back then they didn't have something to fall on but he says what when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard amen amen you women have a battle too don't think you're not a part of this because it all got mixed up in the end you've still got to watch your fashions you've still got to watch the middle of the road and then you still got to be sober and then you still got to have a modest attitude and spirit around you not just your dress amen why because you're the literal personification of the bride you sisters are the greatest representation of the bride of jesus christ that's on this earth right now as a woman as a woman amen but how many are crossing lines today amen and the first thing we see is what outward but outward is just a reflection of the inward amen and so we see them and what are they doing the skirts are getting higher and the clothes are getting tighter and they're getting more and more trendy and fashionable and it causes me to question because here's the thing we all start at a different place in our walk with christ we were talking about this at the house the other day one sister may start at a higher level of modesty than another one maybe one's down here but guess what we don't care where you start we care where you finish amen and so the question is when you're making a change from modesty to immodesty what is it that influenced you there i preached this when we preached on the influence of another i don't care so much about the gray areas what i look at is the changes are you going from more modest to less modest because i've never seen the holy spirit guide someone into our modesty amen i've never seen the holy spirit guide somebody into taking them away from church right i've never seen the holy spirit guide someone into spending less time with believers and more with unbelievers or denominational christians so when i see the change towards something that is off the word then i say there's another influence coming in there a great spirit has come in and he's turned you or she it has torn you turned you away from the place that you're supposed to be going i don't care where you start i just care where you're headed and if you're headed towards satan then i'm going to say there's another spirit there's another anointing on you right the question is did the holy spirit tell you to change your clothing that way that we ought to be able to say that when we make a decision when we make a change we ought to be able to say the holy spirit told me to do that because why the scripture says sons of god are led by the spirit of god so when we do something then we're supposed to be able to say the spirit of god told me to do it because we're led by the spirit of god amen let me put it this far you ought to be able to testify of everything that you're doing with your life that sounds fanatical doesn't it but listen if sons of god are led by the spirit of god and what we're doing is by the spirit of god then that ought to bring a testimony in every aspect of our life and by that i mean how we spend our time how we spend our money how we spend our energy where we go who we're with what we're doing when we're with them all of that ought to be able to be testified about the next time you're with believers why because you're a spirit-filled son or daughter of god and you're being led by that spirit which means that there's potential for testimony in every single thing that you do because he's the one that's leading you amen but the question is do we have only certain people that we'll talk to about certain things we're doing and we say we let's just keep this between us right let's just keep this on the down low young people do we have a group of people that we talk to about certain things and we don't share that with the youth ministry we would never tell our parents or our pastor but there's a group of young people that we'll talk to and we'll do these things with the question is are those holy ghosts filled believers or are they backslidden believers or are they unsaved pretenders because if we can only talk about it with a certain group then it ain't the holy ghost it ain't the holy ghost if we've got to hide it and then if we've got to keep it in shadows it's not the holy ghost that's leading us to do these things amen you say that's fanatical take it to the scripture colossians 3 17 says and whatsoever you do in word or indeed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him so let me put it this way is there thanks being given to god for the things you're doing that's the standard he says paul says everything you do and say ought to be able to tie back to give glory to god that's a standard that's a standard i want raised in my life that's for sure amen and then you do it in his name that means you're doing it with his leading with his guidance not with his just his permission but with his leading and with his god he's taking you someplace he's directing you he's telling you to do things that these things amen because what is it we'll say well it's all about a personal it's all about personal conviction listen conviction is not our standard conviction is not our standard the word is our standard amen because you can come to a place where what your conscience is seared with a hot iron and you have no conviction and you say well i'm not convicted that doesn't make it right that just means you're not convicted the word is the standard that we're raising up in our lives amen amen what is it we're looking at the sons of god getting away from the mind of god amen and after this point in genesis 6 they are never called the sons of god again until we get to paul's messages there's never a son of god until christ comes and then after that it's us after this point they fall so quickly and so far away from the very mind and purpose of god that he doesn't even call them sons of god anymore it was a mixed multitude that grieved god and what did he do it says in the lord god and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years the early humans could live to 800 800 or 900 years we know over 900 years for methuselah and a couple of other ones right that was with that pure natural godline if we could put it that way it was still insane but not being mixed with the serpent it could live for quite a long time not quite a thousand years but god said that's too long for people that only think continually of evil so he says i'm going to cut them short he says and there were giants in the earth in those days listen if we were looking at the fruit of this from carnal eyes we'd say this was the right thing to do there were giants in the earth in these days and also after that when the sons of god came in into the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown brother brown said that civilization took off here and this is where your scientists were and the great things that came out of that and what is it satan now has full control over the minds and hearts of men and this is what came out of it men of renown great men i'd be curious to know what history they had for those up to the up to the up to the flood that they had you know what they achieved in those times but god wiped it all off it grieved him it says and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually no room for god god said there's nothing do you know noah's a part of this i'll prove it to you by the scriptures you say noah was a god-fearing man if he was then why did he need grace amen wasn't necessarily evil continually but he was no he was no wonderful man we don't see anything of noah we see how he felt when he got up there amen what this was not a man that was perfect this was a man that found grace there's a reason for it amen but i can say it says and it repented the lord that he had made men on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them and we're here again because remember he says i'm not going to destroy him by by a flood i'm going to destroy them by fire the next time amen the only reason he does is because they're right back to where they started at the beginning amen and we're not to the point where they'll let us be if we just let them be but they want us to accept it they want us to believe it and then they want us to fight their battles with them that's where we're at is they won't just allow a difference of opinion they won't allow a difference of belief but they want you to accept what they have and then get on their side and fight the battle with them amen but where's the mind of christ in all of this there's always a one there's always a group there's always somebody that god's got ready to be used amen satan's pressing more and more into humanity so what does that mean for the bride christ is pressing in yes do you feel it do you feel it because if he's not pressing in then something else has been pressing him out and you don't even realize it right now amen amen the prophet always pointed us back to this and i quoted it earlier in isaiah 59 says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him what's god doing when satan's pressing god's pressing back isn't he what does that look like but brahm says but now when we need it the spirit of god raises a standard what is it he is pouring in his spirit that's why we need the holy spirit not just once brother brahm said one filling many refillings that's why you need to be in the presence of god is because there's a standard that needs to be raised up to keep you against these great spirits that are coming amen this is fast becoming my my favorite quote you know why because this is a time when it's being raised this is a time when we need exactly this above and beyond when it's ever been needed before amen what is it when i get into a trial when i get into an uncertainty when i get into something where i don't know what to do when i get into something where i don't feel i've got the strength that i need what do i do i go to god and i say god i need more of you listen i need more of you here because i can't deal with this i don't care if you're a minister i don't care if you've been serving the lord for 40 or 50 or 60 years it doesn't matter the standard has to be raised because the enemy is coming in like a flood god has provided something that means there's a reason for it amen and it's because the enemy is coming in stronger than he's ever come in before well you say well i already got the holy ghost look in acts chapter 4 after they've been endued with power on high after they've had the upper room experience after they've been out fully obeying the gospel commission they got hauled in front of the priests the disciples did and they said you better not do this anymore or else and what did they do they went back and they had a little meeting with the with the other believers didn't they and they said here's what they're going to do if we do what he told us to do here's what what's going to happen to us if we obey the great commission and what did they do they shared the problem and a spontaneous prayer meeting broke out that's a group of believers when we come up against the need and what do we do we bow our heads and we go to the one that can actually do what make a change in the situation listen they were maybe even a week away from receiving the infilling of the holy spirit for the very first time in a group of people and they were coming back and they said we need more we need more a week after the very first and filling they're saying god we need more of you it says in acts 4 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost that happened back in the first and second chapter of acts but they were all filled with the holy ghost again what where they were assembled together you tell me it's not important to be around holy ghost-filled believers this is what happens around holy ghost-filled believers you get more of the holy ghost you get more of the word you get more strength you get more courage you get more of what you need to fight the battle when you walk back out that door amen it says and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spoke the word of god with boldness they started speaking the word with boldness on the day of pentecost peter stepped out with great boldness the man that denied christ denied it got up there and spoke and 3 000 people came to him but guess what even peter had some issues here he was a little worried he's like we've just started they're already going to kill us so what lord i need more and guess what god gives you what you asked for amen what is it god's not slack concerning his promises amen we'll go and we'll ask him for money we'll ask him for grace we'll ask him for forgiveness we'll ask him for our children we're asking for this and that and the other thing but listen you can never ask too much of him right 99.9999999 of the world wants nothing to do with him guess what he's got a people that he wants to be poured into and all he's the only thing that holds him back from us is how much we want him how much we're willing to let go is how much he's willing to pour in amen so don't sit there and say well we had a great service last time we had special meetings and a great minister so i can't go to god asking him for more i already got prayed for her i bel i'm holding him to his promise i'm confessing this and and that and the other thing don't stop there listen build on it build on it lord i got you i want more of you i need more of you i'm satisfied that you're answering prayer but lord don't stop there there's more that has to be fulfilled there's more deliverances i need in my life amen i need more of you and guess what he's not going to sit there remember jesus said if if you go a kid goes up to his his dad and says i want i want bread does he give him a rock or he says if he needs fish will he give him a serpent he says how much more your father in heaven brother brahm said god wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed and guess what there's no greater blessing than the personal presence of god in your life day in and day out in an over abundance that will help the person next to you as well amen amen here they got what they asked for question is what are we spending our time asking for yeah amen we have no problem asking god for the material needs how about our spiritual needs sometimes we just need the power of god to keep us and hold us there while he takes the time to work things out in our life sometimes we just need holding power don't we when things are coming in because it says what having done all the stand stand sometimes you just need strength to stand you don't have to move forward you just don't want to move back you've got to hold the ground that you've been given and that's oft times what happens at special meetings and special ministers coming in these things or you have a wonderful service and what do you do you take some ground and then satan comes in and he tries to what take back what you've taken from him and all you're trying to do is hold hold hold and then what god's gonna add line by line word by word experience by experiencing you're gonna take one foot step at a time brother brown says what footsteps is possession all he's trying to get you do is hold what you've got and then you'll take another step and another step and you see the romans what they do they block shields and then they do one step and then they'd stab stab stab and then they do one step and all they're doing was holding the line they take that initial rush and then they just start marching forward in lock step in unity not a bunch of people going helter skelter but lock together in unity what under the umbrella of the word moving forward and taking over satan amen brother brown puts it this way he says what we need is a good old-fashioned holy ghost sent revival men back to believing the word of god that god will take care of us like he did in the old days he will take care of us today he says do you believe that god will take care of us what we need today is another refilling another like the disciples amen but he can't do it for you if he's on the outside he can't do it if he's just a a happenstance in your life from time to time the occasional god is not the name he's known by by the believer amen right he's supposed to be the ever-present help in time of trouble isn't he amen he can't do anything if he's a part-time renter in your body he doesn't do that he's either in or he's out there is no half saved there is no half holy ghost half not holy ghost you're either sealed to the day of your redemption or you're lost and then you've got to come to that place where there's a peace and there's a rest inside that you have been sealed to your eternal destination and that he's going to take you all the way through and until you do you're just going to be back and forth up and down like we were talking at the house the other day why why are people so tossed about they have no anchor they have no security they the question has not been answered in their personal life where it comes to where they stand with god amen i was listening to the message you must be born again last week and at the very beginning the prophet of god is praying and he says this he says and we're grateful that we have hungry hearts to hear thy word are you grateful you're hungry he says continue to hunger our hearts for thee lord as david of old said as the heart pantheth for the water brook my soul thirsts after thee thinking of the little heart the deer as we would call him today that he's been torn by the wild dogs and he's bleeding he's losing his life and he must find water if he expects to exist but he says once he finds water his life is renewed he says may we be that thirsty lord that we must have christ if we exist we must have christ if we become the church that we're asking for we're asking for great power and great authority we want to fulfill the word we want to be the manifested sons and daughters of god he says lord may you help us to stay thirsty to bring us to that place amen if we live the lives that we are wanting to live we must have christ or we will die amen can you say that i must have jesus personally continually every single day amen why is it so necessary because if we're being drawn back to the mind of christ to the form of god to thinking not robbery to be equal with him to recognize who we are something has to draw us there and guess what it isn't our carnal nature and it's not our body's desires and it's not certainly the eyes of flesh that we have or the ears that we have or any of these things none of that will do to draw you back to eternal life amen what is it we can't make it happen on our own we can know about it we can be associated with it we can even acknowledge it verbally that we think it's true but that is not what's going to draw you all the way to eternity that is not what's going to restore you back knowing the truth has never been enough it's never been enough to know the truth judas knew the truth nicodemus knew the truth the rich young ruler knew the truth amen but where to take him didn't take him to eternal life did it it's got to be something inside of you amen that's drawing you to him amen so don't let shame or fear or disappointment keep you out of that presence that's the greatest thing that holds the believers back so many times as they're ashamed right and shame is just what an expression of fear that what you're not what you say you are you're not supposed to believe what you say you are you're supposed to believe what he says you are and then the experience in your life is supposed to reflect that the thing is don't do what adam and eve did try and make it better on your own try and cover it up try and give an excuse try and give a reason try and pass the buck to somebody else that's not what he's looking for he's looking for somebody that'll come back to him amen he's the great resolver prophet of god says it this way he says look what adam did as soon as he become a sinner he never tried to seek god it was god seeking adam he says he really represented the human race right there when he hid himself behind some fig leaves that he made himself like most people do today i belong to the church and i've got my fig leaf apron on i belong to a message church and i've got my fig leaf apron on yeah still a fig leaf he says but it was god seeking after adam and not adam seeking after god it should have been adam's streaming father father where art thou instead it was god saying adam adam where art thou and that's the same thing today he says so there's just not one bit of goodness about us that we could say we had anything to do with our salvation it was god calling us by election that's why i say noah had nothing in him that made him somehow what worthy to be saved noah was what he was a son of god and that's the only thing that was good about noah because why there's nothing good about me before he saved me there's nothing good about you before he saved you whether or not you're raised in the message there's nothing good in us brother braham says there's nothing there there's nothing there in us that has anything to do with our salvation except what the predestination of god by election that's the only thing that was in noah that brought him through we see what fell amen the sons of god turned their eyes away in their mind from the purity of god's word they got mixed up and they took the whole creation all the way down to hell amen but look at the next verse as we start to close here in genesis 6 it says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord did it say noah was a wonderful believing christian did it say noah had the victory didn't say noah was a great carpenter all it says was noah found grace and you know what grace is unmerited favor that means he didn't do enough to warrant saving he didn't we saw him he was a drunkard after that's right he wasn't necessarily the grace of believers but you know what when god came his way by faith he responded listen it doesn't matter where you are matters what you do when he comes your way listen zacchaeus zacchaeus he was the worst of the worst he was a traitor to his own people cheating them not just a tax collector for the romans but cheating them out of it and guess what when god came his way when christ came his way what did he do he says this days jesus said this day salvation has come because what do you do he says i'm going to give everything back times 4. he says i'm going to make everything right how he responded is what mattered there didn't matter that he was a cheat didn't matter that he was a traitor a turncoat what matters was what he did when god came his way man he's not looking for perfection he's looking for somebody that'll respond to his word when he comes amen amen noah was the son of god and god was never going to let that fall by the wayside amen they had great men and women come along all through the old testament amen godly people committed to the kingdom of god sincere in their beliefs taking the stand for god even doing miracles but it was never enough to bring us back was it god destroyed the earth started everything fresh and yet one is want to know his children came through and what he was the son of the serpent again and what happened was he just carried right on through and it all got as messed up as it was before that amen what not a single one could restore us back to where we needed to be there was no way we could do it why they couldn't even restore themselves much less the rest of us but brahm says god's intention for his creation man is to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by he says a word a life lived by the word would be the word expressed you say we want to be the manifested sons and daughters of god here you go a life lived by the word would be the word expressed he says that is true is it not but did adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there arose moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in anger to obey the word then there was also david the great king of israel a man after god's own heart and he failed by adultery when he was tempted amen david was a man after god's own heart and that still wasn't enough it was enough to get him grace it was enough to get him forgiveness but that's all he got yeah he still died what looking for the promise right certainly couldn't get us back to eden moses was the great prophet he says here what it was a prophet like unto thee was what jesus was supposed to be compared to moses that's how great a man moses was was that christ was modeled after moses can you imagine can you imagine if you were the one that christ was modeled after it's the other way for us but he says moses was so close to a god and a man that christ was modeled after him and yet what great signs great wonders great victories great prophecies great discernment great moving of the presence of god in the camp under his ministry and yet what it wasn't enough to restore them back was it still in a fallen condition what was it god using you wasn't enough to restore you being used of him did not mean you were restored just means you were used nearly perfect wasn't enough is what we're getting at we have no recorded faults of samuel yet it wasn't enough joseph a near perfect type of christ yet asked his father to lie that's the only thing we know that he did wrong it excluded him amen what is it they're in a fallen condition and when you're in a fallen condition you can't raise yourself higher than what you are right it's impossible to do it amen you can't make yourself sinless a sinful creature can't make itself sinless it's born in it it's shaped in it it's come to the world speaking lies the prophet would say amen you can't redeem yourselves from it brother braham says first we reckon ourselves sinners and worthy of condemnation that's where we start that's where we start with salvation he says and we are all born and sinned and shaped in iniquity there's not a sound parcel of us our minds are bad our soul is corruptable our constant thinking is evil every imaginary thought of a man's mind is evil a sinner and also that our body is weak and our spirit is no good and we're just full of corruption that's our original position as we come into the world today every single one of us doesn't matter where you're born message not message denominational atheist buddhist jane doesn't matter roll this he says and how could one corruptable thing bring another good thing out of a corruptable he says let me say this that in job the 14th chapter he said seen that man is born of a woman full of sorrow and trouble yet he cometh forth like a flower he fadeth away and on as the prophet goes on speaking he said who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean he says not one he says you stick your bucket down into the well and pull out a bucket of water and it's stagnant it stinks you look in it and it's muddy and little worms is in that water there's no way at all to put your bucket back and get a clean bucket the whole well is contaminated and the whole soul mind and body of man is contaminated with sin he's born in sin physically shaped in iniquity and come to the world speaking lies so that his own soul is contaminated nothing good one cannot redeem the other because it's all wrong and you can't take a bucket full of water here that's contaminated and another bucketful that's contaminated and mix them together he says you've got more contamination there's no purification in it i remember brother ed hammermeister when he was here and he was preaching remember and he was speaking of jacob he says the first thing jacob had to do to get anywhere with god was do what confess who he was because he says what's your name what was jacob's well we know jacob's name was jacob but what did it mean shyster deceiver cheater manipulator what he had to stand there and say this is what i'm coming as he lived up to his name didn't he and before he became israel a prince having power with god he had to say what i'm nothing i'm worthless i have nothing to offer you but yet i'm here asking for something amen do you know what my name means gift of god and guess what unlike jacob i don't match up to my name no matter what i did nobody was ever going to call me a gift of god until what god turned me into something listen we don't all have bad names most of them have pretty good names don't we but that's not what's going to make you good right you've got to confess like date like jacob did i'm nothing i'm corrupt amen that it's all contaminated everything in me it's just worms it's dead it's rotten nothing good worthless falling apart crumbling in the light of god the world may look at it and say you're very gifted well educated intelligent good luck i'm not talking about myself i'm talking about the group all of these things in the world could look and say you've got something to offer god said in the light of his glory and grace it all fades away doesn't it amen what happened through moses the law came do you ever happen to notice with abraham there was no law he had one law circumcision and everything else abraham did was by one thing faith by faith abraham did this hebrews 11 records of force doesn't it by faith abraham did this by faith abraham did this by faith sarah did this it was a life by faith by what personal leadership and relationship with god that's what he walked by but what happened when he came down sorry let me interject this here another brother brother ed hammermeister thing when he was he was here and we were talking he says if you add up all of the conversations that god had with abraham and read them out it adds up to eight minutes of conversation just reading so we speak faster than we read so abraham has less than eight minutes of recorded conversation with god over 24 years that's it lots of experiences perhaps but only eight minutes of conversation all pointing to the exact same thing with not a single shred of evidence to support that it was ever going to happen all the way up to year 24. that's what abraham did by faith was he left our pastor read it the other day he left knowing whether or not whether or not he went he didn't know he didn't have a clue where he was going and he didn't have a clue when he was going to get there and he left on the basis of a little conversation from god brother brahm talks about abraham and sarah's if they were what down their packing idols they were idol worshipers he says that's why i say noah probably was along the same lines because abraham was the same way too what it wasn't where they started that matters it was what happened when the presence of god came through their life and guess what he came down he says abraham get out there's a place i'm going to show you and i'm going to turn you into a great nation abraham said okay that was a very short conversation for somebody to pick up and move and move and move and have no enduring place they dwelt in tents the entire time no proof no proof of the resurrection a wife fading that was never able to have children his body getting older and older and weaker and weaker nothing there and then somebody came their way man and it all changed yeah but the thing i love about abraham is that he wasn't perfect in his actions wasn't perfect in his responses but he was always ended up pointed in the same direction that god told him to go he always came back listen he messed it up bad he messed up with ishmael we're still dealing with that but guess what he always came back to that promise and it was accounted to him for righteousness the scripture says amen but look what happened adam feared the presence of god when he'd sinned and you remember when the children of israel were out there and god says i'm going to come down on the mountain and they're going to see me and he came down and what'd they say no no no this is no good we're scared of the presence again that's right they said moses you deal with them that's right and so god says then guess what i'm going to deal with prophets from now on that's why we believe in a prophet because he deals with prophets amen but he what the men what happened was moses goes up on a mountain and he comes down with the law and what happened was men took that law and they replied used it to replace god the law became their god and they forgot that there was a god out there that was seeking what to have an effect in their lives above and beyond that amen what did it what was it it was a means of keeping their lives clean and helping them skip many problems listen you follow what the word says and you're going to have a better life regardless of whether or not you have the holy ghost you'll be saved from so many messes in your life if you just do what the word says but that's not the answer that's not the answer that's legalism from start to finishing man but what happened was this was a the law gave them a means of approaching god if only once a year they kept them clean before god every year that man would go in that priest would go in and he'd offer a sacrifice and that kept them clean for that one year that gave them potential access to god but what they turned that now into a god for themselves is that when god came they never recognized them hebrews 10 it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come they turned the shadow into god itself they turn the shadow they turn the negative into the image it says and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers their unto perfect for them would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sin he says but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year the law did not do away with what the conviction that they had and it did not erase the sins and merely covered them and guess what the bucket they were in was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger every year and it was building up to an unbearable load nothing could answer that that humanity had to offer him it but they got so stuck on the shadow of good things to come that when the good thing came they didn't recognize it you know what our shadow is today it's a prophet because what you look at that and you see that what there's a god projected through that prophet we are not deist by any means but we saw god use a man like he's never used a man since what the days of jesus christ that's right that's what we saw happen there and people will stop there and they'll worship that shadow and they'll say that's it and god's saying whoa whoa i i'm in a multi-member bride not a one-member bride i've got a people i'm wanting to work in and we're sitting there looking back at a message and we're looking at what he did and what he said rather than what getting under the effect that it was supposed to bring into our lives amen that's the modern day law for the message believers that you look at it as what it was and what he brought rather than the effect that it's supposed to have it stays as letters in your life and there's no life of the spirit behind it amen they got so stuck on the letter of the law that when the fulfillment of the law came they said no i'm happy with the law why because they got so good at keeping the law that they got comfortable with it that became their sign of outward piety that became their sign of of how close they were to god even to the point you know they have the phylacteries that they put on their on their foreheads and i don't know if it's the same they put on their arms but they'd have the specially shaped ones in certain sizes and everything it was all a reflection of how amazing they were as a believer that's what it became and even paul said you know he said in in there he says concerning the law he says i was blameless paul said look you couldn't come to me and say that your life doesn't match up with what moses brought us he says i did it all i was blameless under the law and that was what his religion that was his covering and that was their covering so when jesus came it exposed all of that and they said yeah right we don't want to have anything to do with that amen that's what we've got in the message today amen you've got people pointing to what the doctrines and the quotes and none of them are living in their lives it's supposed to have an effect that effect is what restoration amen i will restore saith the lord turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen why did god do it why do we have this message he's not taking us back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers brother braham says that's not enough for us we've got to go beyond that because what they had a purpose and their purpose was not to go in a rapture their purpose was not to go to rapture their purpose was to go in all the world our purpose is to go in a rapture so we've got to go beyond pentecost all the way back to what eden that's the restoration we're going in is that faith will take us all the way back past pentecost and take us all the way into the presence of god to where we stand what exactly as adam did as sons and daughters of god perfect blameless in what a new body because down here we won't have perfection the soul is sealed the soul is perfect but this body we're fighting has recovered many times amen a restoring message brings us all the way back to what they had in the upper room and then beyond that to a rapture and a resurrection it's got to that's our purpose here is to go in a rapture that's the overcomer for the age that's the proof of who is the overcomer is who goes into rapture it's not who went to church not who sang great specials preached great great sermons or attended church faithfully and paid their tithes for 40 50 or 60 years if you go on the rapture that's the overcomer in this age that's what he's looking for amen this message points us back to the experience of adam in the garden of eden not just paul and er and peter and those different ones amen it takes us past that because god used brother branham in a way different way than he used paul didn't he way different way and if he's the first fruit if he's the chief offering for this age then that's what we should be looking for in our lives is what that type of what ministry amongst us all not as brother branham as individuals but that thing spread out over the body so that the effect is the same because it's what the same god it's the same holy spirit the holy spirit didn't die when brother branham left the scene did it jesus told nicodemus that you had to be born again to even understand the kingdom of god he says you had to be born again to what understand what's going on you can't even do something for god really unless you're a part of that kingdom because you have to do it not only do the right thing but you have to do it with the right motive and the right objective you've got to have the mind of god when it comes to these things amen amen so thinking that because you're drawn to the message or you're around the message is not what's going to save you it's not what's going to take you into a rapture it's good i'll take that over anything else we've got out there but you've got to move beyond that amen having the information is not what makes us safe it never has i wasn't saved and i was raised in the message as long as i can remember but it had to move to beyond that didn't it had to come to a day where i said i'm nothing and i need something and that's what really changed my life amen paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believed they listened to peter and their hearts were pricked and said now what do we do they had the information that had an effect and then they said what happens now and he says you got to get the holy ghost because that's what's going to make you a believer that's what's going to bring you into the body of christ amen the priesthood they resisted so heavily because their religion was their identity you hear about identity politics these days this is what my party believes this is what my group believes and so this is what we're going to do and we won't listen to any other thing and that to that today listen we can get into that as believers you ought to know where you believe where you are where you're standing what you believe amen but your perfection is not in that the perfection is not in what you believe it's in what he's doing amen it's got to take you off of the pages that's got to bring it into your life that's the saving power of jesus christ amen is not to keep it on there so you can nod your head and say amen but it's to take it into your life so you can be yea and amen and then we've got to be a christ to a dying world amen the very first thing that's going to come with that like i said is humility christ humbled himself to the purpose of god amen that's the very first thing we're going to see in a believer as we go in i've got one quote left and the musicians can come if they want amen but the very first thing that he did was he humbled himself to the purpose and plan of god brother braham says this but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god then was satan foiled if you get the holy ghost this is what he's bringing you to to live by every word he says for here was one who lived by it is written and that masterpiece of god overcame by reflecting god's word you want overcoming power reflect god's word he says then he says then was this manifested perfect one given to the cross as the perfect lamb of god for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and listen to this and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of god amen god bless you if you would stand this evening amen under the law god gave them a way to come into his presence one time a year but when this happened what did he do he gave us 24 access to him personally where you don't have to go through a man you don't have to go through a minister you don't have to turn your eyes towards the temple you don't have to say a couple special words but you can take him with you every single place that you go amen what does the scripture say pray to the god that is within you i mean that's the place where we have to recognize who and what we are is when we say listen he's with me and guess what when we come into a big group then there's more of him here and sometimes he drops down in an even more special way man but this is the time and the place where these sorts of things can happen is when we recognize who we are and we're sitting here and we say hey my brother and my sister they got the same thing i got and so when we join our hands together what happens what we ask for because what the mind of christ is now what gathered in a body and they're working in unity and god does what he steps into his bride and he says whatever you say is what i'll give you why because you're so surrendered to the spirit that he's put in you that he lets you speak as if it was him that's where we're going amen that's the next couple of services as we go but certainly we want to be in prayer for brother aaron as he comes on sunday and then lord willing i'll pick this up again on wednesday man let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord we read about a fall today lord but we didn't just read about a fall but we read about a plan and a purpose to bring us back heavenly father lord and we spoke about the power that is available to the believer and lord we don't want to just run around out there saying your name and doing things in your name lord but until you've got that same kind of authority in our lives that bring us under subjection lord that humbles ourselves to your word first and foremost lord where you can bring us into alignment with your purpose and your will and your plan lord and where we'll sit still long enough to help you show us what you want done lord we pray that you would just help us or as we look at these things lord that you would lift our minds to a higher plane lord that the holy spirit would quicken the word for each and every one of us lord lord that we be quick to repent where we're wrong lord but in that repentance lord there's always going to be a may a way made lord for
