worship you in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you this morning if you'll turn the scriptures to Exodus 23 23 amen I want to Echo brother Bob's thanks and appreciation for having brother vaishal back with us again it's been a long time and I was starting to think he wasn't going to come back but uh but here he is and Faithfully at his post of Duty so we're certainly happy that good see Sister Baker here as well God bless you to see brother Chad back without anything fried or crispy after his truck fire trusting everything will work out okay I also welcome brother kingsley's Mother all the way from Nigeria come to visit us this morning amen God bless you Sister it's good to have you here amen Exodus chapter 23 verse 20 says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine Angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off Thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works notice that not just worship but don't do the things that they do those that worship idols live differently they act differently they speak differently he says don't serve them nor do after their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and you shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of the thing God bless his word you can have your seats this morning God bless you remember we're going to continue on our series on Redemption we're at part 26 now and I want to continue where we left off last service in this idea of preparing to inherit and as you can see we're using the types and shadows of the Redemption of the children of Israel to to show us where we're at today and and what it looks like for the believer and what inheritance awaits for us and we know that in in this scripture in Exodus 23 they're not even close to crossing over to the land yet and God's preparing them even as early as as 40 years before they're going to go in he's preparing them for what it's going to look like to inherit and what they need to be ready for and what they're supposed to be doing as they they lay the groundwork for this Redemption process and and their part in it amen so God took them out of Egypt with a mighty hand we know the scripture says and that was the going out part of redemption and then he took them through the desert and that was the preparing them for the going in part and then there's a going in part and and so this preparation to inherit this preparing to inherit is letting us know that we're about ready to go into something that there's something waiting for us that all this time that we've we've spent in all walking in the desert and this this Dusty dry land that we've been going through and the trials and tribulations we've been going through are there to prepare us for something that's far better than we've experienced so far it's a wonderful thing to be set free from your sins and to be justified as if you never did it and to accept the blood of Christ and then you have the sanctification of the desert the separating and these different things but there's something greater even than all of those things amen we're so thankful for what God has done for us that he's he's buried our sins in the sea of forgetfulness that we're under the shed blood of Calvary that he separated us from the things of the world and the ideas of the world but he says there's something greater coming and I want you to know I prepared a way and I prepared a person to take you even into what you're looking forward to amen so we want to move past the desert experience we want to talk about what awaits ahead of us and what this this whole Journey's been about so let's start as we go back to these scriptures here and it says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared now I want you to notice that this is not an angel this is really the angel because this is not little little a angel this is capital a angel this is the person of God this is the theophany of God in Angelic form that is leading the children of Israel that says he's going to take you into the land that I have prepared amen and we want to realize that there is a big Angel and there's a little angel for every stage because what happens is we know that people get stuck on the little a angel and they forget the big a angel if I can put it that way how many times has that Pastor said that brother Brown says they neglect to see the angel behind me he was an angel messenger but that was an Earthly messenger but there's always a supernatural Angel there's always the presence the holy spirit of God that's leading and guiding the children of God Amen we know that Moses was not this angel that that spoken of here we know that because he's talking to Moses Moses can't be the angel if he says I'm going to send an angel before you before the children before Moses before Joshua and these different things Moses spake of an Angel and Joshua spoke of an Angel and Moses met an angel and Joshua met an angel and so we know that that angel was not those men but it brings us to the idea of where we are in this age because in Revelation 3 it says and unto the angel the little Aid under the Earthly messenger of the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and then in verse 22 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so it says that there's something that's speaking and it is the amen it is the faithful and true witness it is the creation of God and then he says hear what the spirit is saying so this is nothing less this Angel is nothing less than the spirit of God dropped into an Angelic form that's what we're supposed to be looking at amen so in our her church age who is the inspiration what is the inspiration is it a man that we say was a prophet no no more than it was for Moses or Joshua but we're looking to what the amen the faithful and true witness the creation the beginning of the creation of God which is Christ himself that's who's leading us that's who's guiding us and we can't get stuck on the man but we have to recognize what the man is echoing and he's echoing a voice from eternity which is the spirit of the Living God speaking to you bringing you a message taking you what you need to take you into your inheritance he's delivering something from the Throne of God that is meant to drive you all the way to your Eternal destination people think we're looking to a man we're not looking to a man but we're looking to the Unseen voice behind the man that is calling us out of this world and into an eternal Place amen what are we doing we're looking to the amen the author and the finisher of our faith the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end because we're in him and that's what we're looking to as we've responded to a cry that was what just like what was inside of us there's a deep calling to the deep inside of our Lives amen so what was he doing our messenger came to turn us back to what the amen not to himself but he said turn you back to the fullness of the word to restore us to the word so that we could have the fullness of it inside of our Lives each one amen so an angel has to go before us but a man will speak supernaturally of that angel when you catch what the holy spirit is saying you speak as God speaks not just the man not just the prophet not just the messenger not just the leader not just the ministry but you as a Believer when the Holy Spirit speaks into your life that is the Angel speaking into your life and when you speak what he speaks you speak as God speaks that's how powerful it is church when you have the Holy Ghost leading you and guiding you amen what is it it's not me leading the church it's not brother Gerald leading the church it's not William Branham leading the church it's not any Minister that you like to listen to but it's got to be the angel of the church age that's leading us the capital A the spirit the Yea and amen it's got to be the life of the word the person of Jesus Christ amen what is it we've got to learn to listen because the angel was not there remember he says I'm sending an angel to lead you but now as soon as they Cross Jordan they're not going to see a cloud they're not going to see a pillar they have to follow a voice they have to follow an angel now and we've got to do the same thing we don't have the visible Pillar of Fire here anymore do we but the same angel that was in that pillar fire is here to lead us all the way we sing that song I know Jehovah is here to lead us all the way listen we've got the same Angel today and it's the holy spirit in the life of each and every one a believer of the Believers amen but the problem is that we know what's supposed to happen we know what's coming our way we've been well taught we know what's in here for the Believers of the last Church age we know it's here for the Believers it's the manifestation of the sons and God and Daughters of God comes into its fullness and so what happens is we try and get ahead of it we try and make it happen but we see here that he said what I'll send an angel before you to lead you we are not to lead but we are to be led we're sheep we're supposed to have a Shepherd we're supposed to have one that goes before us the angel goes before us to prepare a way and to keep us in the way that's what the holy spirit is here for is not to to to drive us but to lead us somewhere to follow I read a quote and will maybe preach on in the next service brother Brown says we don't use the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit uses us that's where we have to get to because what happens so often is we think we have something and we try and use it and know the idea is to get out of the way so that he can use you and then the supernatural can flow through you because it's him and you it's Christ in you it's the holy spirit in you that's doing the work it's not you that's trying to make it happen Paul would say this in Romans 8 he says for if you live after the flesh you shall die but there's a remedy you don't have to die he says but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live then he says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God the defining characteristic of a son or a daughter of God is that they're led by the spirit of God ultimately you may not be there yet But ultimately this is what proves the Son and Daughter of God is that they are led by the spirit of God and until the Holy Spirit leads us we will fail constantly we'll get halfway we'll get three quarters of the way we'll get somewhere and then it'll stop it'll fail because it's us trying to do the supernatural rather than the supernatural working through Us in the first place I was reading as I was studying this I came on this quote and brother Brown does this this really long sentence and I want to I broke it down because he says there's eight things that tell us when we're ready and this is not conclude you know this is not the only list or anything like that but but I want I broke it down into bit by bit so it would be more impactful here now watch this he says and when the Christian is he's talking about when you're ready he says and when the question is number one packed with the gospel filled with the goodness of God and all the good things of God are laying in him with an open heart ready to work willing to be positionally placed do anything that the Holy Spirit tells him to do is pass from Death unto life is Sanctified from all the things of the world and is walking in the light as the light comes to him moving on he's ready should I read it again when the Christian is packed with the gospel and with the goodness of God when the Christian has an open heart when the Christian is ready to work when the Christian is willing to be positionally placed when he's willing to do anything that the Holy Spirit tells him to do when the Christian is passed from Death unto life when the Christian is Sanctified from all the things of the world when the Christian is walking in the light as the light comes to him as it comes to him just because you can see it doesn't mean you're in it yet don't get ahead of the working of God he says when you've done all that when you have all of that then he or she is ready he says then God shuts the door of the world behind him and kicks it together like that and seals him with the Holy Ghost Of Promise hallelujah how long how long are you still church until the destination don't get him out here on the railroad track and break it open and see if everything's all right again it's all right just leave it alone the inspector has inspected it how long are you sealed he says until the day of your Redemption that's how long you're sealed listen there's lots of people doing great works today great Ministries great influence maybe you could say they've got hundreds and thousands and maybe even millions of souls that they've led to Christ supposedly but until you have the Holy Spirit leading you they'll all come to not because remember it's a scripture that I've quoted so many times that said in that Dale they'll come to him and say Lord have we not done many wonderful works in your name and heal the sick and all these different things and he says depart from me you that work iniquity I never knew you because you didn't listen to the spirit you did it of your own accord for your own glory for your own purpose for your own reasons and that's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for somebody that will be subject to my work which is by the Holy Spirit quickening it to us amen brother Brown talks about people that can't wait he says Adam's bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth he says it was an oncoming thing a promise this is the most dangerous place for believers when you see the promise and you say I've got to get it now she was not his wife as yet because he had never lived with her he says the bride of Christ is not his wife yet the wedding suppers to take place get it he says notice oh this is Rich she got in a hurry and what should she do what did she do she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent seat and when she did what did she bring she brought a child of death a child that she perverted every child after that notice an oncoming thing a promise a prophecy laying there that God had given her and she tried to bring it to pass her own way and all she did was make a mess and she brought to the rest of the rest he says and when the Church of Jesus Christ was perverted in the time of wrong after a virgin birth and was given to Christ at Pentecost what did she do she crossed herself with Roman dogma and the Protestant church has done the very same thing she can't wait a woman is engaged to a fine young clean man and before they come together what she's done she's found pregnant by someone else then her own body which is patrolled to her boyfriend her engaged husband is found full of seed of another man he says what a disgrace that's exactly what Adam found he says that's what Christ has found they couldn't wait that's the matter with people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position they've got to manufacture something work up something don't think we're excluded from this within this message that we preach we know so much we know so much we've had a Prophet come and show signs and wonders and we see them in part in The Bride today but everyone's trying to get there and the thing is you can only get there as God makes it real to you that's the simple fact he says that they work up something they try and manufacture something the initial evidence speaking in tongues what were they trying to prove we've got the fullness and so they made a sign of it and they said what is it it's speaking in tongues that's your proof everyone wants proof we want assurance we want Surety we want to know that we know that we know don't we as a young person we want to know don't we do I have the Holy Ghost am I sealed to the day of my Redemption am I going in a Rapture am I going in a resurrection if I go by way of the Grave that's what we want is that assurance and so what people do is they make up signs they make up ideas they make up the the checklist of their own making to make themselves feel that they've got it he says they they say initial evidence is speaking in tongues to get more members in the church all these kinds of Tommy rot instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ making himself known among the people she can't wait what did she do she went out and become pregnant with denominationalism first was Assemblies of God then come the Oneness then come walk after that he says now the so-called bride is pregnated with all kinds of Tommy rot a disgrace the women won't pay a bit more attention to what God's word says and nothing in the word and neither will the men or even the preachers he says then call that a bride what is it she's pregnant Christ's bride has become pregnant with the world dressing like the world acting like the world big churches fine what it shows what she is she is of the devil That's what Satan done in the first place was trying to build a big beautiful kingdom in the heaven and was kicked out for it and excommunicated from heaven he says that's what Christ's Modern Bride is she's kicked out because she's excommunicated from God because she is a and not a virgin he's not speaking of the real bride obviously but he's speaking of what the church the church natural the people that profess to be Christians christ-like and he says God is nowhere near her because she's been found pregnant by everything that Satan's thrown her way because she's trying to manufacture something he says it's deep but I hope you get it Adam's bride could not wait and she mingled her seat illegally he says we are supposed to believe God's word and that alone now Brethren do you see why I'm contending for the word word by word I've told you I believe that this is God's truth God has predicted that Bible he's got to judge the World by something through Jesus Christ which is the word and the Word was made flesh to become Jesus Christ I'm just letting it soak in he says remember the word and now he finds her all messed up you think he'd marry such a thing as that never he's holy and she couldn't wait and she's illegal that's the way today the bride today she wants to manufacture something glory to God she's got to work it up on the platform she's got to have everything see what is she's doing manufacturing something look where it's going you can see there's nothing to it it's a phony exactly right he says watch this if it wasn't this world would be a flame with the power of God the church will be on fire he says oh what the dead will be raised and all kinds of things will be taking place I believe we're at a time of transition globally globally because what we're at the end of the end time is wrapping up it's going to be a very quick short work and we're looking at it and we look in the word and we see our place and we see our position we recognize our day and we recognize its message and we hear what the holy spirit is saying and then brother Brown's saying don't get ahead of God let God lead the way let the angel the capital a angel let the Holy Spirit lead the church into this we've got some of the fullness we have some signs and some wonders we have some gifts we have some manifestations but we don't have them all do we brother Brown says if it did the world will be a flame with it you pick the greatest message church that there is and even then they don't have it all yet they might say they do but they don't because otherwise we'd see it why because the time's not ready yet because it has to be quick and short otherwise the whole world would see it and there'd be people that would be attracted to it it would make a mess of it all over again it's a quick short work and then we're out of here it's a quick short work it's always been that way God does it boom takes it and then everyone Falls away afterwards they mess it up and they do the and things but it won't be this time because he's promised he's going to take a bride out amen listen you can have something and whatever you have that's real that's wonderful but don't make yourself pretend that you have something that you don't that's the trial for the bride is to say I believe it and not necessarily have it all because if you look at what happened when they went into Canaan it took them 10 years to get everything that God promised and then there was still work for them to do individually promise was no different on the day they went in than 10 years later but there was a process of time for God to give them everything that they were supposed to get look what brother Brown says he says your priest Your Leader or so forth can teach you your religion you can learn the message that we are trying to teach but that still won't give you eternal life this message he says you've got to accept the person Jesus Christ you understand that all of you you've got to accept the person Jesus Christ to have eternal life he says now sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us till we don't know what to do then when that time comes that's not what a Ministry is supposed to be seeking as influence because if they're not there what are you going to do you've got to have your own influence it's got to be the great influencer himself Jesus Christ through the holy spirit in your life amen listen I believe that every gift is available to the bride of Christ today every single one faith and healings interpretation prophecy knowledge discernment Miracles Gifts of administration whatever it might be I believe every one of them is available to the bride today we know that the gifts were given back at the Azusa Street Revival they're available but that is not where we focus but they're available and I believe that as we need them and if we need them God will open them up in our lives and in our local body and these different things but we're being restored back to a word not just written not just written but a word person a word reality in the Holy Spirit a life in the Holy Spirit a power in the holy spirit that gives us overcoming victory in our life overcoming power inside of our Lives amen listen I'll take a simple humble Victorious Christian Life which is the sign of the Overcomer over gifts every day of the week but if there's a gift that's needed God help me to be ready for that gift and you to be ready for that gift heaven knows we don't want the Ministries to be doing it all right we want you guys involved we want everyone involved this is a body we're all supposed to be supplying these things amen but it's not gifts that we're seeking now but it's leadership and anointing because when you're anointed then God can use you for anything listen you can have a you don't have to have a gift of Prophecy to prophesy all you have to be is Sanctified and full of the Holy Spirit and God can drop down and use you in a service just like that then there are those that do it all the time Gifts of healing Gifts of Faith all these different things I believe that a brother or a sister can lay hands on somebody and pray for them and they can be healed they can be delivered they can do all of these things why because you're full of the Holy Ghost and it's using you to what do the things that are needed in the body each and every one of us just don't try to manufacture it like I said earlier brother Brad said we don't use the Holy Spirit it uses us and what happens is when we try and drive the agenda when we try and do things then what happens is we get ahead of it and we're going to fail miserably every time he says where is our faith to believe the simple word of listen scripture says that the the path the way to life he says is is so is so easy says that a fool won't err on it won't fall off of it he says where is our faith to believe the simple word of God just what God Said take him at his word god hides himself now in Simplicity in a humble little bunch he says but one of these days he'll manifest himself as he always has in the days passed by remember last year I was talking with another Minister kind of my age myself and we were talking about different Ministries and different men and different gifts and whatnot and he was sharing this story that a certain brother told him and I said I don't know about you but I've never experienced that he said neither have I and that was very refreshing for me because what happens so often is that a person has a gift or somebody has an experience and everybody wants to toe the line and come up and match them and so what happens and again you'll see this in ministers especially is that one man gets a gift of discernment and then everyone suddenly has discernment they say they say and they're this and they're that and they're this and they're that and I was refreshing for me that another man would say you know what I've never experienced that because he wasn't pretending and he didn't feel the need to pretend he didn't feel a need to lift himself higher than where he was at that point because what if he'll stay humble like that God will raise him higher than he is now if you'll stay humble that's what brother Gerald talked about on Wednesday night wasn't it how much time did he spend on humility so often we get lifted up in Pride because of what the word says to us rather than humbling ourselves to what the word says we ought to do let's humble ourselves to the word so that God Can Lift us up amen but like I said one person gets a gift one person gets a this or that and all of a sudden everybody's trying to do it and it makes a mess because only one of them is real and the rest are pretenders and that just leads to disappointment and failure for the people and for the Ministries themselves be what you are be what God made you to be stay in your lane stay in your land stay with your gifts stay with the thing that God's placed in your life and just stay simple with it and God will open it up if he needs to brother Brian says now just be yourself simple humble waiting for the coming of the Lord he says now we don't believe in glamor something's shining you know I always said Hollywood shines but Christianity glows there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing Hollywood shines with great class and society and glamor but the Christian grows with humility the way up is always down listen we have celebrities in this message whether you think it or not whether you believe it or not and it's not always because those men are lifting themselves up it's because the people will lift them up so often we've got Hollywood royalty in this in this message there are men that could do certain things and we'd let them do it because we believe so much in their gift and in their calling and that ought not to be every one of us is held accountable to this word amen a simple humble Victorious Christian walk is the son of the Overcomer not gifts not gifts listen gifts for one they're outside of repentance the scripture says so you can have a gift and never be sealed with the Holy Spirit so why would you follow a gift listen Cora had a gift and look what happened to him Balaam had a gift Balaam was a prophet and look what happened to him you've got to follow the word not these men amen secondly gifts will fail First Corinthians 13 says there's only thing that what one thing that doesn't fail what is it God's love it's the only thing he says where there's prophecy it'll fail where there's Visions they'll fail and tongues and all these things he says they'll always fail they'll fall away or the people that have them will fail but he says one thing that won't fail is God's love for you that's through in these things get back to Exodus what I'm saying is don't get caught up on a minor don't get caught up in a minor the major is always the word the major is always the word after that everything comes second Exodus 23 21 says beware of this Angel and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him how many times did the children of God provoke God children of Israel time and time again they provoked them and they provoked him and he's warning them before they get too far into the desert he says when you go when you cross over don't provoke him you see what happened after somebody provoked him what happened when Aiken provoked him everybody died in Aiken's family his wife his kids his animals everything they killed it all buried it and then moved on and went into victory God doesn't mess around when you cross over like that when he's Justified you when he Sanctified you once he crosses you over into the into the land of promise he says this is a different game now I need a different kind of people and you can't be wishy-washy you can't be up and down you can't be provoking by complaining you can't be provoking by looking back and saying I liked it better the old way then you've got to be able to move with him as he leads and guides what is it we've got to be able to trust God no matter what the picture looks like today no matter what the situation looks like that's what determines what we really think of him amen we're trusting him to take us to the good picture when even when it doesn't look so good right now first Thessalonians 5 8 says in everything give thanks in everything give thanks for this what everything is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you listen our attitudes towards God when things don't look so good is what really shows us what we think of him because in a relationship if everything's good and hunky dory all the time and you've got a great relationship that is no test or proof of your relationship if you've got all the money in the bank great health you know everybody's the the size weight and shape that they want to be and and everything's good and fulfilling that's not a hard relationship to be in but when things go south and all of a sudden there isn't so much money or or somebody lose gains weight or or the money's not in the bank or or their stresses in life and these different things and things change that's the real test of relationship I know a man that made a lot of money this is this is an actual story I know a man that made a lot of money and life was great and he had all sorts of trips and travel and good times and and all of these things and his wife was wonderful to be around she was so dedicated and and so good to him and so so happy and so contented and as soon as he lost his money and he lost every penny she said this isn't fun anymore and she left that showed what she really thought of him that she was there for what he had not for who he was and sometimes God will take away something we have to see if we're there for what he has or for who he is because when the chips are down when things aren't going so good the question is is this about him or is it about his gifts is about his provision is about his healing is it about all of these different things there's that song that says help me want to give her more than the giving and I believe that sometimes a test for the Believers is are you just looking for what he has rather than who he is I'm reminded of job what a believer in just a few a few short days or weeks God allowed job to lose all of his possessions and all of his children all of his wealth even his influence to where he was called a secret sinner when he had all of his wealth and when he had all of his family nobody would dare accuse job of that but as soon as he lost everything all of a sudden it comes out of the woodwork people are saying maybe you really are a sinner Joe maybe you aren't as good as we thought you were job but God took the lives of his children in a sudden tragic event and job gets all that news and I want you to look at what job does when he gets the news then job arose and tore his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground you'd say he's getting ready to mourn but what is he does what does he do and worshiped and said naked came out of my father mother's womb and naked shall I return there the lord gave and the Lord had taken away blessed be the name of the Lord in all of this job's sin not nor charge God foolishly when he's tearing his clothes and shaving his head and all these things you think he's really tore up about this and he was church it's never good when a parent buries a child and you say job was he's tore up about this he's really sad and he is but the first thing job does is he worships God he's lost everything Church everything and he falls on his knees and he worships God can we do that can we do that that's a challenge this morning when everything falls apart praise His name why did he worship why was the first thing he did worship job every day worship God do you know that and he'd sacrifice for his children job had a relationship with God and it was not based on the fact that he was wealthy or had great kids or had no issues in life that he had his health and all these different things he knew that God gave it to him and God would take it away and that didn't change a thing about God didn't change a thing about God whether God gave it or God took it away job loved God and he knew the reality of God in his life but listen when it was all said and done job did more than worship because he got a revelation he got a revelation that he wasn't just going to raise on the other side that those children were waiting for him over there that he hadn't lost anything he'd lost them here but he hadn't lost them over there and he says I know my redeemer liveth and all the the fleshwarms destroy this body says he says yet I know that I'll see him job never had that understanding he had that question before all of this and when it was all said and done he came out and he had the answer that he'd been asking his whole life and God allowed all of those things to be taken away from him just so Joe could get a revelation of the what the reality of the resurrection of the Dead if God could only let us see and we could catch and hold on to the revelation of what lays Beyond this trial what lays Beyond this world what lays Beyond this testing what lays Beyond these hard times that we go through and if we could hold on to that Revelation it'll carry us through what we're going through today amen we sing that song in the good times praise His name in The Bad Times do the same in everything give the King of Kings all the praise what's our response going to be Church they're going to be worship listen we're allowed to mourn we're allowed to mourn lost it's not wrong to do that just don't blame it on God say Lord I trust you I love you and I know you love me and I know you've done this for a reason it says in all this job sin not nor charged nor accused God foolishly in fact Exodus 23 it says but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries the programmers were no you used to have the if then statements if this then do that and God said this is so different if you obey his voice if you follow his leadership then I'll be an enemy to your enemy and I'll be an adversary to your adversaries listen I've said it before I'll say it again you can't be neutral there is no neutrality in this word in this world you're either for God and he says if you're not for me you're against me you can't stand there and see how it's going to play out you've got to make a choice you've got to make a decision am I for God or am I not because if you're not you're just as if you're fighting against them even if you're not doing anything you obey God God goes to battle for you that's the way this works you follow the leading of the Holy Spirit you do what the word says now God's got something to act on because your faith has manifested because you've taken a stand for the word of God and now God's got something to work with God's got his word to back up because remember God doesn't back up his children you'll never find the scripture where God says I'll back up my children he says I'll back up my word so you got to get with the word you got to get on his side so that he can back you up in these things amen how many times in the the last service I spoke did did we cover where God said stay with the word stay with the word stay with the word and we talked about brother Bradham and that vision of the bribe where he said stay in line stay in line stay in line why because if you stay in line with the word then God can battle for you but otherwise you're left to to do things on your own and that's never going to work out well don't give yourself an excuse to step away from it excuses we have many we have so many excuses church for the believer there's no excuse to step away from the word he says for mine Angel if you do all this he says mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee in you say praise the Lord and then watch what he's bringing you into the amorites Hittites parasites Canaanites heavites the jebusites he says but I will cut them off when you think of an inheritance and you know maybe our parents have done really well and and they say I've left you an inheritance when I die you're going to get an inheritance and we think oh it's a a lovely Cottage by the lake or by the Sea and I can go there and I can relax on the weekends and enjoy the outdoors and get away from it all and disconnect from from the networks and work and all these different things or maybe it's a wonderfully maintained home in the city where you know it's close to school and it's close to church and shopping and it's a place that's paid off and you say that's the kind of inheritance I'm looking for maybe it's a successful business and Daddy's just going to hand me over his successful business and I'm going to make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year or I'll sell it for millions and I'm set for life that's the kind of inheritance we all want isn't it if our parents are going to leave us we want that kind of an inheritance brother Bob we want a good one this this is God's inheritance I've given you a land and it's full of amorites Hittites parasites Canaanites hivites and jebusites not a whole lot of rest to relaxation initially for God's inheritance but it's still God's inheritance isn't it he says my angel is going to lead you into the middle of a bunch of people that want to kill you demonic powers unbelievers people that don't like you people that don't you want you in their business people that don't want you around people that don't want your testimony people that don't want your your code of conduct your dress whatever it might be to convict them he leads you into the middle of all of them and then he says I'll cut them up but your inheritance is in the midst what did David say he says Thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoint us my head with oil surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life Church God's inheritance looks a lot like work I'm sorry to say it but that's what it looks like and we're going to cover that maybe a bit in the next service or two brother Brian puts it this way he says now could you imagine God said there's a land over there that's flowing with milk and honey and I've given it to you it's yours and we say praise the Lord but now before you get into it you've got to knock down all the hivites and the jeopicites and all those other different ites before you got it got to it he says now that was strange wasn't it now the people today is that the same thing God has given you a promise of Divine Healing he's given you a promise of divine Health he's given you all these promises but you're afraid to face the enemy that's trying to Buck you off from it he says that's exact exactly right we're not serving a God that coddles us he's preparing soldiers he's preparing Warriors listen he's going to come back with ten thousand times thousands of his Saints in the Millennium and there's going to be war and we're going to be a part of it but you got to win a battle here and that's what this is all about amen he builds us up so that we can what get to the place where we'll trust him and he can trust us and then he'll start to use us for the victories that he intends amen God trains us always for a future purpose and even if you're in a battle now he'll use the battle now for the next battle later and the experience and the Victory and the lessons learned and all these different things to do what gets you to the place where you can take possession of what God has ordained for you in his word and in all of it he says nothing will stand before you nothing will stand before you if you follow that angel if you follow my word nothing's going to stand in front of you that's the promise he gave he says Now isn't it strange he says it's yours but it's full of Hittites and jebusites and Canaanites and all kinds of enemies in there they're rolled up heavy now it's yours go take it it's yours now I give it to you but you go get it now that's people today if you'd only see when I tell you about Divine Healing you'd say well brother Bradham look I was prayed for last night I can't move my hand anymore that don't have one thing to do with it not a thing it's yours go get it sure he says God gives it to you God didn't just get up there and take his brush and sweep them out loud and said now come in here you are sit down he says never did God do that you show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my work see you've got to go do it and you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have he said every man in here every woman in here that's born again of the spirit of God knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground until the mark with Satan listen it is a battle it is a struggle it is a fight to get anything that is good when it comes to the things of God you've had to fight for every inch of ground tow the mark of with Satan isn't that right he says friends this is not a picnic this is a Battleground see we never come here to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle listen cook eaters don't need the armor of God cookie eaters don't need a sword we need those things because it's going to be a battle amen he says the doctors say the mirac days of Miracles has passed I believe in doctors I find more believing doctors than I find believing preachers that's right more doctors believe in Divine Healing but there are some of them they've got some cracks we got them on both sides it's true but let me tell you that preacher or doctor or whoever it is that don't believe that almighty God can do all things set it aside God is Almighty we are Christians we believe the truth of God and we must stand for the truth of God and we must live the truth of God and every promise is ours that God gave to us he says let's go get it amen he's pumping us up but he's not also minimizing the work we're going to have to do but how many times did God say I've given it into your hands I'll lead the way I'll deliver you I'll cut them off I'll give you Victory I'll give you overcoming power I'll lead you and guide you into everything that you have need of just follow me just follow and you've got to be able to take that first step and then the next step and the next step as he leads and that's where you're going to find your victory he says Thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their image images listen sometimes we see things in battle that our flesh likes you get hanging around with certain people and you get in certain situations and guess what you can see something that your eye likes Aiken saw something he liked he liked the clothes he liked the gold and he liked the silver didn't he he liked that Babylonian garment listen we pick on the sisters so often not pick on them we we warn them because I believe the danger is greatest for them but listen we're getting to the place where we've got to talk to men about what they wear and the haircuts they have seen it in Preachers now Church where they're changing their hairstyles to match what the world is doing and I say what in the world is leading you to that what in the world is leading you do that what are you feeding on that makes you think that you need a new hairstyle now I've had two hairstyles in my life two on my face and two up top and that's based on how much hair I had that's what makes me change my hair stylist how much hair I actually have so I've got to cover the balding spots now right but listen the fact that we're having to talk to Brothers about stay away from the the clothing of the world and the hairstyles of the world and these different things God help us church God help us when we're having to talk to them the sisters I understand listen it's it's a lot harder to find clothes than these different things that are that are modest and whatnot but when our brothers are doing it I say where has the spirit of God gone where has the spirit of God gone I'm happy to see that we aren't changing here especially brother Chad amen amen but you know what brother Chad could do stuff with his beard and everything like that and make himself all this set and the other thing listen you want to find a way to be like the world you'll find a way to be with the world but he says listen when you're in the battle and you come across something and sometimes our flesh will respond to it I've talked many times about how I like cars anything with a motor guess what that's why I stay away from battles with motors just leave it away don't go down that road John because that's a weakness for me it's something that I can get caught up in if I start trying to deal with it too much so I just stay away from it and you've got your place stay away from it kill it now kill it now while it doesn't have any power while God's given you the victory kill it now and get ahead of it and destroy it completely and don't leave any strings or or anything attached to it that's the worst thing is when you keep those contacts you keep those friends you keep those inroads into where you used to be burn your Bridges get away from it destroy it while you have it amen listen we can get caught up in church Hannity too absolutely we can amen by that I mean we get caught up in what's happening in other churches and we try and bring it here you want something to happen in this church get down on your knees and pray to God for right here I heard a guy say you've probably all heard of this is it Asbury this revival thing that was going on in that college town they called the Asbury Revival it's just a bunch of worship there's I don't think they're actually preaching the word so we know it's not going to last very long if they're just singing all the time but he said he this lady said I drove 17 hours to go to the Asbury Revival and he said and you won't get on your knees and pray for 17 minutes what are you expecting you're going where somebody else has done the work and expecting to get the results you get the results by doing the same work that they did get down on your knees get serious with God sanctify your life get close to the word and the things of God and you'll start to see a change in your life you'll start to see a change in your church you can change the ministry just by what you're doing in your life absolutely 100 percent listen if God's giving you what you need through the ministry then as you grow then the ministry will grow to accommodate I can't grow brother Gerald can't grow until the people grow because what is the point of me growing if you can't keep up not that I'm ahead but you know what I'm saying the feeding of the people will be where the people are for that time so as you grow the ministry will grow with you so if you want me to grow if you want brother Joe to grow then you start growing and start driving it in your personal life in your prayer life in your devotion lives and you'll see that you'll start to get to a place in the word where you need a higher level of preaching and the ministry will rise to meet it because the holy spirit's there to take you where you need to go and walk in the light as he is in the light amen listen we can we can look at the different song leaders we can look at the different music Styles and everything they do and all of a sudden we can start be trying to be that listen we're a sovereign body we're a sovereign church with Sovereign gifts that God has placed here let's be Who We Are God has blessed us God has blessed us that we have who we have and what we have in the worship and in the in the music and these different things we don't need anything big what we need is people that are dedicated and led by the Holy Spirit that's all we need that's all we need how many times I mean you let me speak carnally for a second if I can put that way you listen to brother Brandon singing brother Brandon was not a great singer listen they didn't have great musicians there but how many of us can say that we've stood up in the and the piano kept playing the great physician now is near the sympathizing Jesus look I'll take that over somebody that can play anything in the world and then we want the holy spirit in our services not just gifts and Personalities in these things amen we want the reality of God in the individuals within this church amen because although above all those things we want the Gift Giver not that yes we want signs and wonders but I want the sign maker more than I want the signs and wonders amen that's what I want a reality and God says break down every Idol don't let their worship become your worship don't let the little thing that they have in their life become the little thing in your in you because sometimes as Believers we think we can handle it sometimes what happens is you're going through a battle and you're running across a believer that has given up on the battle you're trying to win and you say I don't need to fight because they don't have to fight they've accepted in their life that they're going to have this habit this problem the situation for the rest of their life and you can stop because they stopped that's churchanity that's a false idol that's something that they've allowed to creep into their life you don't have to stop because somebody else didn't get the victory if your heart is telling you to keep going on if your conscience says there's more if there's a cry in your heart for something greater you keep going even if they have stopped amen though none go with me still I will follow with a song says amen let's keep going as he leads us Let the Fire of God consume that failing in your life destroy it all break it down ashes hard to put something back together when it's in ashes don't get complacent amen but Brown puts it this way he says the first thing you know you go to petting your sickness around petting your little petties around and things like that because your neighbor don't believe in healing your neighbor don't believe in the Holy Ghost he says destroy the thing the thing let's go over and take the land Hallelujah God said it's ours and if he said it's ours it belongs to us the promise is unto you and to your children and to your children's children as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen he says that's what the matter with the church today we've got a wishbone instead of a backbone what we need is something in there that'll stand you amen every man that ever amounted to a hill of beans had to fight for what he if you're not fighting you're not moving forward it's just a simple fact of it because everything that God has is surrounded by the enemies it's surmounted by demonic forces it's surrounded by people it's surrounded by situations it's surrounded by decisions that you've got to make based on the word of God any man that ever amounted to a hill of beans had to fight for what he got God don't give it to you on a silver platter he said there's the promised land she's flowing with milk and honey but before you get there you're going to have to go through all these hivites and Canaanites and everything but don't you bow to one of them you destroy the things as you come to them stop building a fire on the enemy's altar amen oh I like that destroy the things as you come to them listen sufficient to the day is the evil thereof the scripture says don't be looking ahead and fighting what's ahead fight what's in front of you right now deal with the situation that's in front of you right now deal with the trial deal with the struggle right here don't borrow from tomorrow listen what you're dealing with 10 miles down the road don't worry about it because if you don't defeat what's in front of you today you're never going to get to what's down the road fight the battle that he has put in front of you because he's LED you to that battle because you can win it you're in the battle today that you can win so don't worry about the Battle tomorrow that's the battle for tomorrow fight the one that's in front of you get the victory today the Habit you're dealing with today fight it today don't say I got another habit I gotta defeat defeat the Habit that God has put on your conscience defeat the Habit that God you bowed down defeat the thing that's holding you back remove the hindrance that's in your life today and then we'll worry about the other one tomorrow and the one after that the day after and the week after and the month after once you get one Victory he'll move you on to the next Victory move you on to the next Victory move you on to the next fee man if you're led by the Holy Spirit the battle he wants you to fight and you'll get the victory every single time the time is going to matter it's going to be different for every time every battle is different every situation is different the battle you're in is the one that he's given you to be victorious soon as we close he says You Shall Serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of Thee you say brother John I got needs problems we've got struggles trials my spouse is bothering me I'm bothering my spouse weight issues whatever it is he says you serve the Lord your God I'll take care of the rest all you're asked to do Church follow the word obey the word seek the leadership of the Holy Spirit and he takes care of everything else he says I'll bless your bread I'll give you food to eat he says I'll satisfy your thirst and take away anything that's by that's it we read that quote earlier where brother Brown says can we believe or accept the simple word of God we've made it so complicated just obey the word seek the leadership of the Holy Spirit and God will take care of the rest that's it in quietness in humility that's it that's all he's looking for is a bride that'll seek Him and listen and he'll lead her exactly where she needs to go one more quote before we close he says God's here leading you that's what's talking to your heart and telling you to do it is the Holy Spirit now I can see the people as they went marching on but did you notice the angel of the Lord went into Jordan before them I like that the angel of God took Jordan first the angel of God will lead you every step of the way sometimes you think that the trials are hard God ain't in no hurry you're the only one that's in a hurry God let the Hebrew children go right in the fiery furnace he let Daniel get right in the Lion's Den and everything before he ever come he says just rise up and start walking by faith God I believe I'm Bound for the promised land god you promised it to me and here I come I'm following the leading of the Holy Ghost I'm going out of here tonight I'm going to prove to the world that I'm a Believer in Christ Jesus I accept my healing and I walk by faith right now I believe it he says I like that I mean God bless you let's stand when it was all said and done God told 601 000 men cross over he says and go to swinging go to fighting footsteps his possession how many times have we heard footsteps is possession don't worry about how many footsteps you take every day just take one get the one footstep every day and you'll eventually conquer your land amen don't fall back don't fall back keep pressing all you have to do he says is cross over and follow me and I'll be the one that gives you what I promised you I'll be the one that drives him up before he says I'll send Hornets before you I'll make their life miserable it amazes me how that when the when the spies went in the second time and they went into Jericho and they came in and everybody was scared of them everybody was scared listen when the enemy's scared that's when you know you're going to win because an enemy is already defeated when they're worried about what's coming their way and they went in there and they said and Rahab told him she says we've all heard we've all heard of what God's done for you and we know we're next and that gave them Faith to step up we ought to be able to listen to this and look at this and say listen Satan's more scared of us then we ought to be scared of him Prophet God said when the when the weakest Christian Falls to their knees all of Hell trembles something along those lines that's where you stand today Church when you get on your knees and you get in the presence of almighty God and you start praying and you start seeking and you start following his will Heaven is behind you and Hell starts to Quake because they know that they're about to get he's trying to get us ready to walk in the next Source we'll talk about what he's trying to get us into amen God bless you this morning let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we're asking for you to lift our faith Lord not in ideas that we make up Lord not in fantasies or or visions that we we conjure ourselves Lord but Lord on the simple humble truth of your word Lord as it's quickened to each and every one of us Lord Lord each one of us has a different battle maybe today than the other but Lord we pray you give us strength to step forward Lord to raise that Shield of Faith Lord to raise that sword of the word Lord and to just step forward one step at a time lord to take back the landlord to take hold of those things that you've promised to us Lord do not get ahead of you Lord but to just stay right in step with you Lord to let you lead us and guide us in these things Heavenly Father Lord we pray your grace for the many needs or we lift up our sister Betty once again Lord God lord home not feeling well and as she enters into her treatment sword in the coming days and weeks Lord may you just lift up her Faith
