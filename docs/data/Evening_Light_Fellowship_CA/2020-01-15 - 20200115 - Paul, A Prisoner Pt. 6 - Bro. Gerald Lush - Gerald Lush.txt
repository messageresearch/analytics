amen not what he's done nobody will do but we've gotta be a part of what he's doing Christ in our stuff [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] they by the grace of God be with us Lord bless you turn with me to the Book of Isaiah chapter 12 it's another there's another scripture I want to get into we will as we go to the words but I should have grace to pray for the service on Sunday a man we say Lord willing the weather permitting well as I say the way if the Lord is willing the winner will be ready a man he's in control but I want you to pray for the grace of God that we are able to have the communion service on Sunday a man I've been wanting to have it because of the the weather that we cancel it a couple of times and I never said anything about it but so we pray the grace I was going to have it last Sunday and I just know was it because of the weather and the forecast so we pray the grace of God that we'll see what this Sunday will hold the madness the Lord leads for the communion and the foot washing he said again like you know I remind you you heard me say it many times where the prophet of God I think they told that brother from Africa and he said there other he said maybe the Presbyterians are better than we are and I guess the brother was wondering why considering the revelation the word the problem of God was pretty and he said well he said they haven't even every Sunday and he said we only have it once a month and so he said maybe they're better than we're so we pray the grace is God out but because the Bible does say as oft as she do it she didn't say is - he didn't tell us that it was along he didn't tell us to do once a week but he said as oft as you do it do it in remembrance of me so god help us is my prayer amen in isaiah chapter 12 and again be in prayers of the saints and i guess a number that is missing tonight and the lord bless them where they are amen in Isaiah chapter 12 and the antigens the first six verses and it says in that day thou shalt say O Lord I will praise thee though thou was angry with me dine anger is turned away it's all because of Calvary and thou comforted me the old god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid a man god help us he said for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also had become my salvation praise the Lord therefore with joy shall he draw water out of the wells of salvation a man praise the Lord that's what we're doing with the revealed word there will be joy shall he draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall he say praise the Lord call upon anything declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted praise the Lord sing unto the Lord for he has done excellent things this is known in all the earth and it says cry out and shout thou inhabitant of Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee amen thank God for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated so the Lord when there's some thoughts that I want to share with you discern any subdeacon being a prisoner of the word what I want to share with you a quote that I majored in with you during the last service but just reminding us I feel that it's important that we not forget it I feel that it's important because we're going to need especially the clumps are closer to the resurrection and the rapture and as the world gets more and more control the devil good remembering again the saint is the god of this world he's not Jesus he's the god of the bride he's the god of the elect he's the god of his of his predestinated seat and they're and they're fewer and fewer if you remember we have come down now to the full manifestation of the wise virgins and authorities virgins a man it is the wise virgins a man that are going into the resurrection and the rapture as the right of the Lord Jesus Christ but it is the foolish virgins a man who are going into the Great Tribulation and they lay down their lives a man for of the word and the problem of God again I like to understand he said that they are virgins he said they are foolish me that they don't have the wisdom of the wise virgins so they're considered as the word maybe in the hands of God you're foolish and they deem an anointing of the Holy Ghost that is needed to take us out of time and into eternity they're lacking that Ananya of the Holy Ghost that takes us into the real word that gives us resurrection and reference faith by the grace of God so there's a brother already wrote me one time not long ago he's rather journal he said well he said there be anything why are foolish virgins he said around the message and I said yes brother I said they're not on the end of the air I said there's going to be those that are even around the message they're the icer there there's virgins at every age all the way down through foolish virgins and wise versus foolish and wise a man and I said what I said the thing of it is I bet the foolish virgins are going to come forward but I said those in the last States are going to lay down their lives and the Great Tribulation and some of them will no doubt eyes will be identified in the message they'll identify with the message maybe some professors say well I'm in believe there's a - you a man just a while concerning will are you really really really a believer a man of God said you believe in your head but only in your heart a man so maybe the problem was referring then to foolish virgins knowing that fewer and fewer and fewer a man so that when the rapture takes place and the dead in Christ rise first we which are alive and remain are going to come up with those new that are resurrected and we're going to go to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord but again with it when that happens there is going to be very very shoe so few that the world won't know where you're not so few that the world will know that the rapture took place they got you know that the Bible tells us there's going to be a generation I thought there was they're going to see the world in a man price sanctifying grace the gifts of the Spirit a man by the grace of God in Revelation in their faith day then they got a man focus on the gifts focus on the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but the faith that God is giving this generation is focusing on the resurrection and the rapture brother I pray God and a goddess don't believe God for it brother all the father gives me will come to me and I will lose none a man says what you say so brother it although when it comes to the bride when it comes to the elect of God all down through the ages every one of them thank God Jesus is going to be there in every age right now from the first age right on to this last age a man but again God my destination came to Jesus God by predestination 14 them for the resurrection and the rapture right into the last age a man but the thing that is happening anyway better predestinated alot in other ages but in the last stage in the bride age he has been not many predestinated to the master when it comes to the living Saints but I believe that both of them are gone on they made by the grace of God and the Father God also warned our brother told our brother me male they the older generation around the message would go on they would go back we worry because they would not easily they were judges women whether they even do the - to recognize it except that no they weren't already they were predestinated for it but there is a generation there is brothers and sisters a in the world today that are predestinated unto the resurrection and the rapture that a man economy may be that a reality in their hearts and in their souls a man Lord God have mercy my heart my soul with with a faith oh my brother my son can't you really believe in a resurrection you really believe in a rapture and you really believe in the kingdom of God a man can you really believe that there is another kingdom beside the Kingdom Batarian amen physically they can you really believe there's a kingdom where there is no sin and you ready buddy there's a kingdom where there is no there is absolutely no nothing concerning the world that you're in now a man there yeah there he knows also seeing no feelings no remembers have seen nothing but it's going to be an absolutely perfect Kingdom and absolutely perfect world that we're going to a man so God comes to me can you really believe that there is such a Kingdom can you really believe that there is such a world that you're living in this world you're experiencing this you're experiencing that and you see this you feel this you are you you you're thinking these thoughts a man but brother my son got to do through the review words for the preaching of the ministry today God is trying to get to the right a man away from this world and more conscious of the world to come away well this word on the more conscious of the kingdom of God away a brother sister from what we're feeling and thinking in this in this body are my natural rights brother he's trying to get us to be more and more and more spiritual a man he's trying to get us a brother they add the pain hey man brother Kenny when they were the prisoners of the revelation out of Egypt but they're also prisoners to the revelation into the Promised Land amen others were similar but when they're not challenged them about getting it oh no no no no just think where was their faith joseline hater wanna go in and all that came out of Egypt there's only true then they wanted to go in how the denomination how many really want to go into the resurrection how many really want to get into the rapture I mean are they really real in our heart that we have a real truly truly rather revelation already register do we really believe it hey do we really believe the rats were never there yes God is big enough concerning the resurrection nobody on Oscar Zoroaster or my brother so we gotta have a revelation it's gotta be really with us as it was to Jesus because Jesus mother agency said I am the resurrection when he's trillion student even if you were the tomb of Lazarus oh he's gonna rise again oh yeah you're right here we went at the resurrection he was all up there all up there a man buddy buddies and I am the resurrection and the life he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die and though he were dead yet shall he live Amen praise the Lord oh brother what a revelation that he had and brother in control me morning noon and night and controlled everything that he was doing and thinking his whole life was wrapped around the revelation of resurrection rapture hey he knew that he had come to that Chinese place he knew he had come to that time in his ministry brother brother sister and we ought to know now we have come to that hour either for the resurrection and the rapture father consumer concerning the message of the hour concerning is whether what God has done what God is doing brother told my brother sister god help us from the name of Jesus even a man mother katakana young economy young me what's going on you for what we're leaving for he's waiting on us because why because he has given us a revelation of the resurrection he's given us the revelation to register now that's why I got a trainee on us the dead in Christ or not a man or guns with a reasonably group of real oh yeah I get a letter to God in you it's going to Christ in you and Jesus said I am the resurrection and a decent life and so by now brother concerning what God has done in this are concerning the word that God has given us concerning the message that God has given us it ought to give us that revelation brother that that God is looking for in this thing that I direction I am that I will be I am because why because he came down in the Ministry of a prophet a man it was my name was a freedom rider who was Jesus and the prophet of God said now I can't do this he said he said I got to get out of the way so he can do it a man he got in the way of ruling brother Branham it was nice amen it was Jesus controlling with it random it's Jesus controlling you a man is jesus controlling me by the grace of God a man looking down to the natural bunch of the spiritual brother we're not living out of the natural plane we're not living about our natural things we're living by our faith a man is like knowledge through us what God has given us and what God has made real in our hearts and in our souls pain right and the public gods and those who are faith declares is more real than when our sensors declare but is most believers name therefore caught up with their secondary faint and it's an absolute truth because I knew that because there didn't happen by the natural people might more than they are the spiritual a man they're going war led by that and when it comes to why morning noon and night magazine or supper and my job and I got to do this what we gotta do is Virgil a man do the rest if the Lord willing a man the Lord will argue or do you want to do that I'm gonna follow his leadership a man not too intelligent and clothes not leadership and aggravating go by their senses now all they all the rest is ruined by their senses amen they went into the Promised Land whoever they saw it was exactly as Mark said it would be exactly a jarring handily a man but they loved the natural things to override their spiritual thing a man because they were looking at the big the big cities they were looking at that the drains in the land they're looking at all the soldiers in the land oh no no we can't do it what after all that after all that you overcome in Egypt after all that you overcome there and Carl Rogers have a name no wonder that God need a boy brought him out of Egypt he over the Red Sea and he give the victory here amen oh yeah even with the enemy was behind them anyway the pillar fire that was in front of the GED the Jews in front of the a lion and that Moses that had all these rights amen the pillar fighter was there and they were following that light the pillar for would be lead them a blend of the enemy amen oh brother sister so that what we have got is just am so with a God opened the Red Sea and they went across from the Red Sea amen then the pillar fire went with them hey man and even when the enemy tried to follow them they don't around that's right they all drowned brother sister the grace of God be with us to have us that we're not going to go by our senses we're not going to go by way by by the enemy I'm going to go by by all those that are caught with there were all the things of the world now we're going to go by what God has revealed to us in his word and as far as his son he said it is the resurrection rapture reallyyou is the kingdom of God really more you do you spiritual things that I have revealed concerning the kingdom of God a man and then the eternal dimension is a more real deal than the dimension you're living in right under this - the problem with war leader Joshua Caleb they need the Egyptian Egypt Akana hey why because this was the promise of God praise the Lord this was the promise of God and he said they're going to be in Egypt and he said in bondage for over 400 years and around 400 years with his Florida 30 or a hoarder 33 because of their unbelief that's right Godsey waiting for their cry yeah well why didn't God God told years but yeah but he's waited for the hear them crying he had a nickel on God asking you and you'll receive CQ pinnock will be open and read on the finally God said to Moses I've heard the cry of my people I come to deliver them amen but they let it go on for hundred years and they go on for another thirty four thirty years amen and that our God finally cried and God came down today and brother concerning you think after all that the signs wonders ministry that Moses said the signs and wonders Ministry of Joshua oh I believe I believe I believe yeah yeah got an approve that belief where there's into little or spiritual in a brother and the same thing there's power when when God's people was any in denominational bondage and God by the grace of God God promised he's going to deliver us I will restore say the Lord a man God wants to do this God promised to do that and he came down in the ministry amen like it was losers the ministry that was revealed in our Lord Jesus Christ amen anything with that ministry brother I'd say brother not naturally Luther's there Wesley there or even there are meta consoles but in this latter day why can't why that kind of tree because this ministry was ordained and predestinated English of pain that God was looking for with our faith it is impossible to please God a mayor and the Bible goes on and says buffet table by faith no by faith Enoch by Vedas one Mary God did them the faith that please God clear day and for their out right on down to Lutheran best we the pedicles now the braid brother God give us a peace baby never give Luther that he never gave even the early Pentecostal Sunday because what God requires of us is clear and for beyond what is required of them amen because they've gone on a man and the Bible says the dead in Christ will run first but they are waiting on us because the place although God said he said that in Christ is that are going to appear the lead Saints Oh are we walking the spirit are we living in the spirit to the extent Amen who this extract that delivered that the dead in Christ is gonna rise her to you you one of the conscious with that as I said this sometimes when I'm walking there somewhere and might have been in a more or go here going there and I see somebody oh it looks like submerged look at my brother burns oh you see sister coffee did that even come to heart come to your mind well the Bible says she wouldn't leave be going to be living in expectation there's we got to live in an expectation of the dead in Christ are paralyzed whether we got to be local something and I'm not just saying well looking will the rapture know you're gonna get a Christ rise first a man and we're gonna miss the resurrection of the dead in Christ will miss the rapture a man and brother and well how are we going to rise first how are they going to appear to it it's according to our faith it's according to a faith by the grace of Almighty God but I plan but if there's anything that God has done and God will do is history in word in this hour and that word brothers not revealing this mission this mystery of that mystery or this doctrine of this doctrine doctrine this organic is all gonna agree character catch them and as a worry with the with your the love of God yeah the divine little projects race and grace gives us faith that pleases God amen ray that's Ephesians amen the Novo God projects v Birds extra grace of God and the grace of God is the faith that God wants us to have amen and it's by grace through faith were saved and that number ourselves it is the gift of God and brother what God today is not our ourselves as not me it's not yours God's gift to us it was God's good to Israel in Egypt right and it got him out of Egypt but now God's always proposed to give them faith brother pay cometh by hearing hearing by the word God Joshua I can't hurt it amen I know that maybe even even when they're in Egypt they knew they knew the promise and they were claiming the promise are there was a generation raising they claimed the promise of God Lord he told Abraham you told him that would be in the bondage for 40 years when he wanted to lose a mate and take us into the Promised Land oh they got out but when they when they when they faced with the responsibility of going into the Promised Land they couldn't accept and the generation of believers can't accept the responsibility of going into the Promised Land no no no you God you do it you got you to listen they got it they want God just to strike them and you're going out of here and you're nowhere you are brother God is revealing it now I tell you this Josh like he knew we were amen cuz he know oh my because the Lord that God gave the promise he said every place sole of your foot your trend he said give it you hey man Oh Lord we're just waiting for you to do it know you could want I'll be with you amen so is the same thing now they replaced the soul your phase your foot your treads pearly Amy so that you are more spiritual more natural oh yeah I believe that brother beginning getting was getting that way more and more and more as God's leading him to what lead him up to the revelation of the seven seals and the mystery of God oh yeah hey just no matter what he was doing where he was he just could he was just visions visions visions visions and this and felt this anointing and that anointing a may even if he went out there in the wilderness and he was fishing or he was hunting whatever he mom publish with oh yeah God was there in the tree table with her in the animals God was there and this God was there that a mare to finally the coming of word the other word the reveal dirt amen what was God doing God was revealing the ministry Oliver but God was bringing the bringing with him brighter more and more into the into the mystery of a prophet 18-under finally after the oldman of shales he said here i go back into it ilysm a merit and then he knew - God was gonna take as like I said when he turned 56 years old he said I am he said I'm going home he said the Lord's gonna take me and he knew that oh yeah that was when he turned 56 in a poor around March or April of 1965 and then in December God took him he knew a man and it was real when brother Perry green walked in and told him woody what bug Billy bring brother Brandon what he saw during his flight to - to put to see brother Branham in the hospital a man and brother Brown raised his hand yeah boy you was going home yeah and he saw a soldier brothers sister God took him now with God now he's in the bride a man god supposes but where was he he was a Joshua Kate amen and the generation that would follow Joshua kill him in to possess the promised land where's he now he's in the braid to go here possess the reservation direction to possess our glorified body amen to enter into fellowship again with the Saints were gone amen but you gotta want it if you'd want it you're not going to be a part of it I can guarantee you Hey God gives us by the Holy Ghost God gives us I'm gonna fish for righteousness is anything righteous you want now brother is to get out of this election into a glorious body amen we want to get name righteous to get out of this on righteous world into a righteous one the kingdom of God and to do that brother we have the prisoners to the word where they press for the revelation that God has given us in this hour and in this age president of the revelation a man and a prisoner to the Word of Revelation of gonna this hour you're going to you're going to be under the control of the Holy Ghost the little the Holy Ghost wait so that God is going to do what he wants to do and what does God want to do well what do you want to do well the will of God well no I'll be honest as a lotta leavers don't they'll say they want the will of God but they don't know no they don't listen to him under our system coming in coming here to church I said oh Lord oh Lord and I ended me of what Jesus said not my all thine be done amen and I said Lord I said have many builders are are really living in that atmosphere how many believers are living under they know that anointing I said garner so what what do what they're faced with in this life Lord not my will done so you're not working according to the natural things of life I gotta do this and you're focusing on that no the Lord we yeah Lord your your grace there I committed you help me Lord but you're going to focus you're going to what gonna do along literature because I think I did it if there's anything we didn't need to help us in the natural is the spiritual amen other the only thing is gonna take a stroke the natural your spiritual experience with God is our spiritual experience with geez let's get a D I must order do we want to stay almost longer do we want the experience to see all this going on out there in the world and as or do we want to see things like what's going on in Australia how much longer to see that things that are going that did that happen in Iran and I know they're in other parts of the world as well amen people that are be killed murdered they're doing this is going on Satan is they control where's God where is God brother one day there when when there was room there were revivals and gobbling that revival that remember that revival and brother they don't mind the power the anointing the Spirit of God you could sense it in the atmosphere and it was all around the world all over the earth amen and there was this revival that revival there a million hey man and brother they all the evidence was there and their testimonies to this to this generation the generation testimonies through that part of the earth and that part of the world ain't no but now there's nothing they're dead spiritually dead it is no enough no not all of them because there's still some of them we know that a lot of the motor hood comes through when it comes to the foolish virgins and so on believe that with the Lord a man because remember what did they lack the extra oil without a double portion we needed the divorcing a made the wise virgin knew that he would need a double Porter's they carried the ex-royal amen by the grace of ID God do you have the extra is it keeping you it's a strengthening you encouraging you is it keeping you spiritual in your mind spiritual in your thoughts spiritual in your words spiritual in your deeds I tell you if you're the right of Christ your spiritual thought word and deed by the great yes brother it's more and more and more serious don't deceived because if there's anything the enemy is going to do is try to deceive the elect and brother you've deceived them out there one thing but here D deceive believers with another because he knows he can't to see what would deceive a church over there with or denomination out there you're a bright boy you'll come around and take the message and leave you with that oh yeah I believe the message but many believers feel they believe what's being pre because oh I'm a believer I believe the message that's right oh they're sausage but how many professing believers are applying it to their everyday living many will vote and say oh I'm a believer because I believe this and I believe that but does it control you does it control what decisions you make in life does it control the decisions you you decide to do this decide to do that sad to go here decide to go there oh is that your is that the Holy Ghost in you again remember if it's real were you where we say not me to live since Christ they live within me think oh price later than me oh he could eat just there - easier to give me the word he's just there to reveal this to me and so they'd like me to see with this relation or that you know I know that there's no Trinity I know there's not this I know there's not it's gonna be this way in that way so on yeah you know he's going to deceive you with her things cuz brother if your devil is going to try to deceive you with in it that's a revelation of the resurrection and the rapture if he's going to try to distract us from this revelation or their revelation it'll be the lesion of the resurrection the way that God wants it the rest of Revelation of the rapture the way that God wants it another grace to be spiritual remembering this you don't go by feelings you're going by faith it came to the place where with Joshua nailing a prisoner of the word of the revealed were prisoner of what God was was doing doing it and got what God did been and would do I mean concerning the promised land brother they were prisoners to the word for the day for their hour and brother it was more real to them oh it was more real to them with the revelation of coming out why didn't need that one now they came up God brought him out now God was gonna take him in good praise the Lord Hey God brought us out what we're going in the devil is there to deceive us and to say all your doors are focused on that you don't have to worry about that you don't have to do this you don't have to thinks way or that way don't worry with that God with the Escada do that yeah that's that devil what about what the devil will do Spadaro doing what's the devil doing around this word what's the devil doing around this a man he's deceiving a lot of people other with their thoughts that's right brother I prayed the grace of God that our faith I thought that God said he said what faith reveals is more real to other than what our senses are tested but again God is telling us a son how much do you want to get out of here and into Magnum that's revelation do you have a real the kingdom of God to you is the king of God the revelation of making more real to you than the revelation that we are living in well the relation of the problem was more real than Joshua and Caleb wilderness you've definitely reeled in Egypt because out of it again you don't you don't let your faith weaken because you're out of denominations oh I'm not I'm not in my heart of a denomination I'm not part of this I'm not part of that Amen brothers to thank God but you brought out for them to be now all Joshua was focusing on was oh good we're going to go to Brahmas land now praise Lord this is wonderful we already went in and we already saw this we saw that praise the Lord is exactly as much said it would be man it's a land boy with Melanie in Seoul and escovitch through this and rich with that aim and when they came back out of the land of spice oh my they had their said that or the fruit of the land what for to proved that it was rich as good a good land but they said can't take it because of the enemy well surely weren't even grit in Egypt or Farrell not by any means and if God did that to Egypt and fell and his soldiers what could God do to those in that land brother if he brought you out he could take him so brother if God has brought it out and is not just to be a church no he brought his head of the church to be the brick grace I've got to us amen so are you bite or just on the church member remember again as he said he could be out of it still a part of it because you got to submit he's you you can you can come out of a church I said and he said you can still be a part of it because he's why he speaks you still got the beard of that church yeah brother I pray the grace of God let's move on into the Holy Ghost the spirit of the bride the bedroom in the bride for those erection and rapture don't just be part of it brother and coming oh and the Lord and say oh brother sister you got the spirit of that church you spear that church get rid of that let me take control of you not to spear that church and you got to spread that church you'll have to to that church the same attitude you had when you were there the only thing changes your doctrine oh I leave this and I believe this I didn't believe that a church but I believe it now yeah but you still had this for that church and yeah it'll control you the same way just make sure we got the Holy Ghost see God brought Luther oh my he got it he got another spirit on him and it not out in him you got a sort of no I don't know anything here the air by the grid of God revealing to him he would have to fight through our Lord Jesus Christ hey my old brother he did this in the Catholic Church that in the Catholic Church but when he got out all it was different it was absurd ever when a coach to the Lutheran's they all thought they were crazy why because of the way they worshipped and praises the Lord a man Alan a man the same name with the Methodists andand and especially the pentose so he really thought the Pentecostals weren't saying any merit but again the Pentecostals came out of it all God's Finney in this dead church that church that church that church Hebrew mall out and the I fight with the Pentecostal revival not a picasso denomination not by any means a man but the revive and then from there God calls a bright now the bright oh yeah they were known as this this rebuttal that revolver that revival now brother all day and again there was bride all the way through thank God was working on and again as I said was what virgin that's the bride but there was also some foolish version that's why I say keep your wretched right keep your spirit right keep your motive objectives right yeah the public God see if you're going out there and you meet somebody he said you can talk to about this and that and he said if they don't need don't don't enter into it and they can't grasp these it would just change your conversation and what all rather what does he mean keep your spirit right keep your ready to drop that's like I said I've seen so many I say Lord I prayed their grace onto that that brother I pray the grace of God that sister I see Lord as you guys for me grace for them amen oh don't think oh they're this they're this through that listen it's grace race grace I say grace Laura me you look at your life none righteous not one amen the only one waitresses don't get that by the oldest comes into you this is tremendous amen they're God's Jesus Christ brother hallelujah wonderful we're rich scriptures I believe word this morning or or emotion there this morning or whatever it was and it was amazing the prophet of God was Eileen the fact all when it comes to Jesus brother I dare to this there's none race only him any righteousness you got Jesus if it's your thoughts it's Jesus if it's your motive your objectives words your dad's it's Jesus if it's your answer to your actions or Exorcist Jesus if we're born again it is Christ that lives here if you are a prisoner to the word it's Jesus he knew oh yeah brother I mean you got no worries of a mom and dad you got no worried about Grandma and Grandpa know the Holy Ghost comes in he takes control anyone is it he subdues they all nature what for so you can live the new nature amen so I pray the grace of God brother you know you not reflect mom and dad I'm on grandpa or the great ones whatever no you're reflecting Jesus because you've been born again but it's of God god help us brother in the our brother I pray God we got with the experience you got an experience that I can experience amen it's not in your flesh is in your soul but it reflect in your flesh it reflecting your thoughts words your actions your motives and your objectors your spirit did it that could have been done on the turkey test yet that York rolled by the whole ghost your control it's the Holy Ghost it's the life of the blood remember they crucified what Nana Kosovo but they killed lambs in the Old Testament but but it was the blood of animal and they couldn't come back to a human being the life of it but Jesus came the lamb rod a Mary and sandless and the life of his blood could like to you and me and his eternal life a grace of Almighty God brother this is tremendous are we a prisoner to this truth are we a prisoner to Jesus amen grace if you're a prisoner Jesus me say it again he controls your thoughts your words oh my and there's a lot of leavers I know that read I have controlled their thoughts words and deeds actions and reactions still have that nature oh yeah sometimes you see the man if there's old nature and that all nature in in in their inner in their admitted under under this stress under that stress under this prayer that pressure they're managing the old nature be still know that I am God god help us brother listen it's one thing to hear the word well they they say I believe that's done seed yeah but God's looking for more than that you know what's looking for he's looking for you to apply the word to your life God is looking for you yep to judge us by that word yeah or is that me Oh Lord that's true that's that's real Lord a man or thank you thank you for the work now lord please I pray help me to yield to it I may let go and let you have your way now let go and let the word I've control when it comes to the word Dean preach brother the people will judge this person just brother judge this sister oh that that brother that's that sister what about yourself I tell you this if you're gonna just the airing of the word oh that's so other so that citrus tone so this one that's that oh you're not hearing it the way you should because you do your point to yourself oh yeah do you apply the word that you're hearing do your to your soul do you apply the word to your life and say is that me but I think it is you got to look at yourself the prophet of God said he said he said what's going on now he said God is judging us and he said the poor but hear this the pervert is the judgment seat it is I was judging you by the word and he said it is where God's power ought to be preached in the pulpit he said God is judging us he said that's what's going on right now God's judging you wrath oh yeah he is custom your attitude your spirit and motives your objectives thoughts words leads again again it's unfortunate that people just take the preaching of the word the preach of the message and they applied or that's the message and you know William Branham brought us all to that night your Lord for that yeah it's in the book but brother is it in you man God's not looking for it in the book do it in you when we go to glory it won't we won't bring books it's gonna be made flesh a merit by the grace of God praise the name of the Lord so buddy said the pulpit is the judgment seat it is we God's power ought to be preached amen that's exactly right he said judge yourself see the thing of it is let me ask you this question is the Word made flesh in your life not in your head his word made flesh in you see that's why the prophet of God nearing the end of ministry he knew when he preached to his own his own assembly preachers in church they said he said you got it in your heads but he says not your heart he's history they didn't I know many people I remember I got I said I can remember back there 1965 96 many believers added their heads but he'd never had it in their hearts hey man I knew that by their spirit by their attitude that's right then listen all due respect and that's why many times that I would go in church into fellowship back years and years and years ago almost 55 years ago and I would sit there and they would always wonder why why does that brother you know because I was I was a stranger to them and I was sort of odd because I I was to them all that that's the brother from st. John's could we lived in here at the time my family did and just as a 90 years old I go out there sometimes I not with oliday weekends or service and I I would sit just right over to himself and they didn't understand they said why does he do that I would start to praise the Lord and worship and so on and an a mister one time just recently an elderly sisters she's brothers she said I remember you as a young boy she said sitting over there she said in the church and she said oh yeah she said you stood out among the people well thank board and and your testimony and your witness and so on yeah but again I was discerning the spirit of a lot of this a lot of brothers sisters there and that's why like I said when I burn I preached and I know if I call preaching or not he just asked me to to get up and speak until it got dark why because they had to get dark for brother cater to show the fit on the prophet because the end that old the old fashioned one the big big real and so on and like I said I preached on Matthew chapter of D was five or six there and the last four or five verses it love them which love you what reward have you and just what back there in nineteen on a tional one it was but I preached ninety sixty six sixty eight whatever and and I said remembered you got to keep your attitude right you got to keep your skirt right I said even toward those out there I said there goes but for the grace of God amen grace for young grace for them yeah yeah and I guess said people have always remembered those things that I preached and many people would play from me because of what I was saying why because they were guilt of a wrong parent they had a wrong attitude and wrong shirt wrong mode along objectives oh thank the Lord for bringing us out of denomination see oh yeah thank you Lord we don't we got no more we don't have the command or control of a man anymore they didn't David they didn't believe the word God brought him out front under that control but he brought them under the troll of a ministry sure for God has said in the church for the perfecting of the saints for this for this for this yeah yeah I said lord I said they need the ghost they came out why believing the message being what the Prophet was saying about denominations and church but they weren't applying it to their own lives they were Jain those but they weren't judging themselves as the lord thank you for your growth in my life help me to humble myself as your son and daughter thank you for bringing me out a lord your grace to take me in a man so brother judge your help is the word my flesh in your life is the message flesh Union are you going out and in your thoughts and your words and your deeds actions and reactions are you reflecting the word the mess of the hour not rift in the church you come out of spirit and that anointing no not by any means it's one thing here it's one thing to intellectually agree with the word in your head but it's more real to you if you apply the word to your everyday living does it control you when you're at work y-yeah I don't care what time you're in you need that you need the word to be there and the engine and the spirit of the were with you to control you although matter what job I got involved in brother head I had to go listen whatever you do the Bible says they you know the believers they walk in the spirit and they live a spirit and brother I'll tell you this even if you're even if you're just working here work there working somewhere else you walk in the spirit you live in the spirit ethics of God amen but they're spinning dude this is walking this but when it comes to their doctrines and theology but when it come to the natural things of life there's walking in them in the flesh that's the truth our brothers got to be if you're better it's your sons and daughters of God it's got to be controlled by the Holy Ghost oh my I think there's not many not many under that aging not me with that kind of a baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls not many listen are you a prisoner to word brother it's me say it again it's one thing to end it actually agree with what's being expressed yeah oh yeah that's Mitch I believe a seat yeah but judge yourself by it play to You Lord does that mean you're going to yeah sometimes you know that the Lord is ministry and he'd be talking to this person talking to that person and you think the preachers say something else in this study else and they say something else is somebody else yeah oh yeah don't think he just from the message most don't won't like though ministries today no this is it is one thing to intellectually agree with the thought being excess but how many are applying the word to their everyday live don't apply it to the ministry and Jada ministry from applied to other brothers and sisters and judge them a play it to yourself judge yourself and as the prophets say you judge yourself amen by the grace of God this come make sure make your calling and election sure make sure your to the word by the grace of God amen oh my grace listen I've shared it with you the last sermon share with you again because I think we need we need to get the reality of this revelation the melody of the hour that living the reality of what God is doing the reality of the apse here that we're living in by they said God amen like it gets it's it it gives me understanding and not just understanding but he give me peace no oh this is what this is what I'm experiencing this is what I'm seeing around this is more and more and more and again now I'm talking with Messi's churchism understand this again he said a fine minister a fine minister said a while ago he said brother Branham if I could sled the joy of the Lord in my heart a man why the spirit revival was gone they Bible was one thing the bride revive was another and this be still and know that he's God and that he in control and brother venom responded to this brother this Minister and his son the revival is over now he said the stabilisers has been put on the ship we don't like stabilizers most don't override me I need freedom don't know stabilize me well we need to be stable us be soul and know that He is God in your life stabilizers has put on the ship it's just leadership so you're not being tossed the air and there you're stabilized straight you're going right straight Amen to keep you in training in light the stabilizers has been put on the ship grateful waves are here before us we know just beyond that wave yonder are nearing the shore and it is oh yeah the great fearful ways like I've witnessed over the years he said just stay stable just aim the word stay with God he said no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word he's let it stay stable a man he said we see great big clouds around us storms are coming yeah brother what are we seeing well we're seeing is getting worse and it's going to get worse the only thing that's gonna take us through it is are if they don't lose your faith I think you're gonna keep us in it and encourage the Senate keep moving on is our faith okay but again as I said God is changing our fate in the resurrection God has challenging our faith in the writer to read believe in the resurrection do you really believe in the rapture do you really believe the kingdom of God the king the land was more real Joshua and Caleb than Egypt you know what because just in Egypt saved out of Egypt but in the promised land God with her a man with a promise to bless him pray the Lord but yet Egypt was more ritu the other Jews than the promised land all should have left us in Egypt let's go back to Egypt what after all they experienced they want to go back to Egypt yeah thinking that maybe they went back to Pharaoh be more cut with no Saints till the God of Egypt saying we still truly need you and Satan is the god of this world but our real is it to us see those things got to get more and more wood you don't you don't get the layers together just to do it and used to it and used to this spirit used to that shirt used to all these things foolish things are going on in this world no no God allowing all that he gives us the revelation of it to know what it is or for the creating us a great hunger and a greater thirst for eternity greater hunger greater thirst for the kingdom of God we're in right now were physic we're in the kingdom of the devil he's the god of this world and he has come down with great wrath he knows time is short how many Christians favours know their time is short a man he says stay stable saying the word they with God no matter how you feel what are they are they right with the word let us stay stable and he said when you see all these could big clouds around us storms coming atomic buffs and everything else they're talking out but our stabilizer is straight in the word he said God said it would be here and will crest every one of them yay said we will go right at the top of them and they said they can't sink us the and Ronis you put us in the grave and we'll come out again amen he said there ain't no way in the world to keep us down there God helps is my prayer to recognize to significance of our see in world don't take it for granted don't you to get them say oh well yeah well we're in the end so those things are going to happen I said this the Bible said that yeah yeah but what what is it what a reaction not to bring in you and me it's not just Bible Bible didn't know Oh hallelujah what is the reaction God is looking for comes to the relation of all this going on in the air what is reaction to God reunion is in the Bible is yeah it's in the Bible the Bible says when you see these things look on how many are looking up bolsters are looking up and looking around but how many are really in their souls looking up and they just can't get away from it because one with it they can't ignore it oh no no it's so real what I do suppose should endure living in Augusta yeah it's that real yeah I get out of it Lord I can't forget it I can't oh lord help me well first there to strengthen us and encourage us son keep moving on looking up amen don't look to the side don't look this way look that way keep looking keep looking straight oh there's a revelation I brought some years ago to the assembly and it turns it concerns a vision that somebody had of going bring the glory and what God required what he had to do what I wanted to do brother and he kept looking towards this is where you go okay now he said don't look to the left or to the right moving forward yeah because why he noticed there were others there on that path and they were going this way they were going that way and they were going out here went out there yeah but he said you keep going forward why yeah it's it's it's the truest the planning of the Lord by when God plants it it goes on top goes on top goes on and caused by God's looking for is is what it's going to bear the fritters gonna bear laughs ooh God looking for a new and me what fruit is God looking for in you when it comes to your experience with the world your experience with other with us family friends neighbors what are looking for keep looking forward or you don't take your mind of it it says all this one's gonna go that that was going to go that way but you keep going keep going till you come to the fruit at the top why the Justina nationalism going off this way going off that way going off this one off that way but God God seed is going right on right on the list going right on right on why tell family hallelujah not the late not the leaves it's not it's not the literally leaves are the limbs no no it's got a go on on no no no tell what - listen tell each other brings forth fruit if God's looking for anything now what fruit is gone looking for now they're resurrected and the rapture don't a devil divert it this way or divert true that way oh yes but you're still lived by the life of the tree still living by the luck but all your producing his leaves well what Gosselin for his fruit exactly turn with me to chapter 6 still haven't got I thought I would finish first or finish the message Paul a prisoner will get it not maybe not tonight Paul a prisoner but you isn't her our prisoners are the word brother I'm her prisoner to the message of the now that the message is a prisoner to me a prisoner is a message it's not you controlling the message the message continue in Luke chapter 6 verse 43 for a good tree bringeth forth corrupt fruit and neither another corroboree bringeth good fruit whole brother God looking for the tree and the good fruit amen it's a real word yes but it's the resurrection and the richer for every tree in owned by his own fruit all right but as others think of you when they sorted you're buried in your everyday life when they see the fruit that you're bearing in where you're working and where you're living where you're where you're going to soar having an education yeah no matter what you do how you do it brother sister they're gonna recognize that you're different that you're a Christian they won't understand all the things but as I said that when I was working with military even and people would come over to me and say oh we're Christian aren't you well by the grace of God yeah oh you are I just know that by the way you live and the way you had we talked I said okay well thank God for this the glory of God you know somebody who knows like I said it's sitting in be just we were just taking a break and they would say it yeah and again another time I was I was just walking through a search area they're doing something and someone campus just give me I just want to tell you just remind you this is the Lord for you your you're a good witness so what well you're a Christian yeah I always said I'm I just want to let you know it's I said what's the grace God yes he said but I just want to let you know thank thank you we thank the Lord for you and your fruit for your testimony yeah I'm time we know we had another break and we're all sitting around able and just talking to Nolan it got spiritual you know why I guess old they said brother we know you're Christian because of your attitude in your spirit they're your we know that we appreciate that I said well I said does thank the Lord I said just I just keep my attitude right in the spirit right yes they said you do and they said there's some about there are Christians he said and and they're just against everybody yes I said and that and they said they got you know they don't know right attitude yeah but they said you do appreciate it we thank you yeah well I said thank the Lord and just let the testimony talk to you oh yeah you know they knew they would they were shorted islands me on certain things yeah by the grace of God to gup-b glory I it's because if the you're under the anointing your cold by the anointing it'll bring forth the fruit of God different of the Christian not that you're perfect but East perfect Christ is perfect no we're not perfect in ours in you know anything you realize the Lord I'm a sinner saved by grace yes son you just keep laying aside nah let me let me control the grace verse for tour for every tree is known by his own fruit so what do they know you who do you bring you for natural physical fruit of a sinner some born has born a sinner or are you bringing forth the fruit of someone born dinh by the Holy Ghost I'll tell you if you're born again you're screwed or you're gonna be spiritual thought word indeed you're gonna be spiritual no matter where you are no matter what you're doing no matter who you're with you're gonna be spiritual and you know can you lay it aside can you take it away no no no it's your it's your born-again your nuclear but I tell you the O's that are not not really their so-called believers but not born again because why they're still living the only they're still living the old life that they were born listeners well yet there's others that are you touch it you watched them and did their spirit is totally different not the old nature no more it's a new nature why now they got better of their Heavenly Father by the grace of God praise the Lord every tree known by his own route and it can brothers not the limbs as not thieves it's the fruit you might have limbs and leaves of the what about the fruit for the thorns for up thunking do not gather figs nor other bramble bush gather the grapes a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth foot that's as good see do you have a good tread in your heart the Holy Ghost so a good man of the treasure of his heart bringing forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringing for that which is evil for all the abundance of the heart is out speaketh a man brother before that you're under the control of the Holy Ghost and you would have a right attitude and a right spirit no matter what the circumstance no matter what the situation you're not to condemn them you're going to encourage them and pray for why call you me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say you know for sure ever comin to me and II rely Saints and do them I'll show you to whom II is light see listen goodness to them is not by your words or your mouth is by your life too often people try to witness but the billabong but the words I did say this I got telling this that this is right this is wrong you know they do that they do that yo live it amen he said whosoever cometh to me and here with my Saints and do with them I'll show you to whom he is like it's like a man he said which built a house and dig deep and laid the foundation on a rock Alleluia he laid the foundation on the rock of the real world amen our Lord Jesus Christ and when the Rose de stream beat vehemently upon the house and did not shake it for it was founded on a rock but he said he that error than do not he said as the command that it without a foundation building house upon earth against which the dream did beat the eminently and immediately it fell and room of that house was great that was like what where is the other one was Abraham they meant the grace of God brother the grace of God that we're going to build house upon the rock not just among you're not just a Bunner and our natural our natural being but upon the nature in Christ amen by the race of God and no matter what comes what happens it or not your faith you believe God you stay with the Lord by the eggs of God wait on the Lord I'll finish with this ol trade here it's Paul prisoner and listen again as I said many feel that they believe what secretes because they're believers in the message again they believe in their heads but not in the heart but the thing that is that whatever is being reach the first they do is take it and apply it to your own if you don't condemn the others you'll plot yourself by the grace of a man and brother if you want to be a witness to others if not thing to say o condemned them condemn them no leave your life for them you want to let them know they should or shouldn't do didn't you do it in real it in your flesh your attitude your spirit your words actions your reaction oh yeah if there's anything that they seek they people will see that and they'll know if you read this way and you talk this way back this way or yeah they don't know who do you draft her you should have lost her father no I don't yeah I turned after my heavy father oh yes they would believe that yeah because you're really company father's attitude that's how much your faith make your calling and election sure how make sure you're born again he's Paul he was trained by the hollows to wit on the word he was trained by Holy Spirit to wait upon the Lord no matter what his ambitions were or going to I hope by the Holy Spirit show you Sonny now he said let's take an instance one day Paul and Silas come down a street in a certain city he said where he was only in a Bible and a little demon possessed girl kept following him crying out after him and Noah but what Paul knew that he the authority as an apostle to rebuke that evil spirit out of that woman but did you notice he waited day after day oh he could have turned around says you don't come out of her no he waited on the Lord he made it there's a reason that he had the wheat and he said until all of a sudden he said the Holy Spirit spoke to him and he said this is the hour and he said though spirit come over she knew to wait on the Lord how many of us are going to wait on God or that God taught you grace wait on the Lord now many of waiting on God to go and do what they want to regardless wait on the Lord wait I say on the Lord hey man there is were so many people he said na he sir bring a reproach upon word he should they go out there with ambition and how many rivals have been left flat because of a thing like that because the Evangelist doesn't wait to see what the Lord's got to say yeah how many I won't mention a name but I only have been deceived by a certain evangelist out there for 40 over 40 years he's been ministry over 40 years he's been deceiving the people well 40 years begging as it were for their finances into the billion dollars in 40 years and it and having such a such element of people to the extent that he oh I've see for years on certain pictures or films or whatever and he go over there all over the congregation and all over the audiences people and go and oh they fall down they gonna fall down one time I saw where he did it did it did it oh ma it was a you talk about a pile of human people one one foot lane back onto your lane back on the other as if they were there I laid there leaving the impression they were laying by the Holy Spirit they weren't I guarantee you that and now just over the last few years a relative of that evangelist has been preaching against that he says that's not God he preaching against it because he was also a part of it and he said he said there were others he said if they were really really sick people he said oh yeah they were there were there were those there maybe he might on one of them and they will let those real sick people go and go in the prayer line just people that we could walk in the laner or they if they wanted to experience this experience that oh that's it yeah brother what they wanted was he I know there was times when on her in any Costard there were Jewish brothers and sisters that were slaying my spirit my brother it wasn't the preacher did it God did it because I remember even even in when I was in Pentecost and we gathering up around the altar and I was one of them up there around the other we were praising the Lord and and I was raised and I noticed this sir came up and she walked up and she just she just stood in front of the altar then all of a sudden nobody touched her she she fell back off or she was slain by the spirit oh yeah and after a while then she was stirred she'd come back again yeah I remember years and years ago when I was just home and even even one time my grandmother my father's mother and and she and she was in in the Salvation Army and when all of a sudden she was up around the altar I believe at the time and all of a sudden she went up and they thought she said yeah that's what they thought because they works to that but she was slain by the spirit only yet they took her and they held on to her and order to finally she came back to her off again yeah slaying by the shirt but this evangelist for forty over forty years he's been even even that's been a witness of him well then if that's this evangelist a very righteous but now one of his own relics is condemning it he said that's not God he said like this eyewitness said and they which they would not allow real real ski with a net prayer line and there was one woman there that that they interviewed and and that she was one of those that went to go into that Beuerlein that wouldn't let her go oh no she wasn't it was really something wrong with her in your chair and even the way that she was she was she was formed and so on and no they know they would say just take her sides they where the Lord bless you the grace of God to you that's it yeah yeah even today as many many years ago but even today she still did the wheelchair she said notion they wouldn't let me go into light he said I know now she wasn't gone so I leave it with the Lord yeah grace of God to her oh yes she still in the wheels she still formed like that I thought but she's still pressing on her faith in God oh my brother god help us is my prayer so don't get to see by that yet I guess that evangelist might might be a millionaire oh yeah many many many millions that he got from the people Oh send this send this this he goes sometimes goes around the world God have mercy on us pray god help us amen and I know some time some years ago years ago a certain evangelist sent me sent me pictures like that and it wasn't that of that that preacher and it was this preacher in a certain country and he sent me on it to me and I saw this and I saw that they were doing this they were ruined that in that country and I said brother dear brother please don't smiie those things again i said that is not scriptural I said the Bible tells us that when John the Revelator saw Jesus he fell as one dead before fate and I said Jesus didn't leave him there Jesus reached on us to stand on you know he said I'm doing I'm this and that I said he does he's not there to do this not there to do that I see it there to give us life I saw on I said brother don't you go preaching those things would you go teaching those things that's not scriptural God is not going you didn't see that in the menís Ministry of William Branham you didn't see that in the Ministry of War Roberts and other evangelists no no way not by any means no they come into line God we got prayed they pray for them and God healed them they went on praising the Lord everybody out in the praising the Lord Amen to God be the glory they're giving the glory man but not to God amen so brother Paul he waited on the Lord and he said there's where amid so many people they bring a report on the word they go out with ambition should how many revivals has been left flat because of a thing like that because the Evangelist doesn't wait to see what the Lord's got say and he says some of them say come over here and go right now because the Association says go the Holy Spirit was same thing different yet the ambition of the man easier to become the staff press better or to become or something ornery says some elder some big or he said you eat he's the Holy Spirit saying go here yet is Luke 2 is organization and he is prisoner to his organization but it is joke to Christ he led by the Holy Spirit is yoked a prisoner to Christ they did am any difference what anything else says it's a sounding brass a tinkling ship he hears the voice only the voice rod and he speak only when it comes out he says nothing amen grace he said brother branham your convene what you said sunday about you and waiting all this time but you remember it was the Holy Spirit that spoke to me up here on the room and said I'm sending you back among the sick of the afflict man this was God instructing brother met him to go back to evangelism because when it comes to the call of his life for the Ministry of the word and the old the mystery of God the seven seals it was a niche it was done and God let him go on for other two years because there were still some things he did say he said another revelation on this on the Bevan seat and so on this revelation that revelry then when Gaul finish he took him off the scene now brother yes what is it now God has laid it in our lap the Prophet is not here no more but God has laid the revealed word in the lap of the bride what's she gonna do with it and God after all these years God has proven what we're doing it and God is watching and I was looking to see what we're doing to see it's controlled in our lives by the grace of God are we prisoners to read a word grace let's take the character of Moses he was born a deliverer but before I say about Moses he said like to make this statement that God always has to take any man that will serve Him truly to be prisoner a man as to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is everything is life his soul his body and his hill and his ambitions and everything else and become a pleat prisoner to Christ who is the word he wants you to serve God you might walk country to your better judgment God is looking for prisoners amen that will get to give themselves completely completely totally over to the control of the word so it's not new that leads Christ that lives in you by the grace of God there's a prison to the Lord you're a prisoner to his word amen and you're taking the word not applying it Jelena just with this one or that one or somebody else taking the word in a plane it yourself you are lining up with the word brother not you lining somebody so it's dog lining you amen and you take the word and apply it to yourself first and foremost he won't judge somebody else what the Prophet you judge yourself first you want somebody else well make sure you're lined up with the word and you reframe it so that the word living in you will judge them now what you say is the word is the life you're living if you're reflecting the word thought word need actions react reflect them by the grace of God amen bless you let's stand amen praise the name of the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah they sing the last model of the way if I walk in the pathway of duty if I were to close of the day I shall see the great king in a beauty when I've gone the last mile of the way praise the Lord where brother it seemed like we're in the last mile and
