that we have need of according to your word we pray Lord help us to catch the Simplicity of it Lord let Faith rise up under the hearing of the word we pray and we are asking it in Jesus name Lord we give you the glory the honor and the praise Commit This service to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you each one turn if you would to Revelation chapter 1 amen sure appreciate our musicians and our song leaders you know I think we don't realize how often how much work goes into these things and it can it can be difficult at times you have a long day you have a hard day hard week hard month sometimes is the way it goes but every every service they've got to be there and faithful and it's a Ministry amen and it's a commitment that they have and we thank the Lord for each one of them amen God bless you this evening want to wish sister Priscilla a happy birthday today and I think brother Levi had a birthday yesterday so we want to wish him a happy birthday as well amen Revelation chapter 1 getting right into the word this evening oh brother Joe Adams did ask me to say hello and and just greet the Saints and send his love towards you I I just I uh texted with him a little bit this this afternoon and he wanted to be remembered and and just to to pass on his greetings so God bless you from brother Joe Adams amen Revelation 1 and verse4 familiar scripture after the last few Services he says John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirit which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and ha made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and as you can imagine we're continuing on this series on manifesting time and I want to take yet another six service on stepping up amen and I I'm trusting that this is starting to hit home after 53 portions of adoption I hope that we're starting to gather what it is to mean to to be an adopted son an adopted daughter of Christ and we want to speak again of kingship this evening and last service we talked about it the the kingship has to start in that we can't be the kings of our own lives we have to give over that to Christ and we have to let him be king and when we let the Holy Spirit come in now we come under his Dominion we come under his Authority and that's by the word of God and then from there his Dominion starts to take effect in our lives amen and before we can have effect on others we've got to let him have an effect on us and it's it's God within us now working and doing these things by the Holy Spirit and our lives are driven by the Holy Spirit and tonight I want to focus on what that was last service we we kind of ended on dominion and we we spoke about it generally but I want to go into the details of dominion and what that Dominion looks like in our in our personal lives as individuals sitting here this evening uh listening to the word and I want to pick up with a quote that we read in the last portion of service on Sunday brother Bram says this he says we are Kings spiritual Kings he says oh we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom that means that our battles are going to be spiritual amen that it is not flesh and blood but it's against principalities and powers and darkness and all these different things he says right now right now today church we reign with Christ having dominion over these four things he says we have dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil but what is it that's doing this he says it's showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure that means it is his will it is his pleasure that we would have dominion over sin that we would have dominion over the world that we would have dominion over the flesh that Satan couldn't put one over on us at any time that is his will and that's his good pleasure for the believer tonight he says yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we have dominion over these things and I want to just do a quick refresh this evening and we read last service that Dominion means supreme authority not just Authority we see in a in a country we see in a company we see people that have authority but in every one of those places there's somebody that has supreme authority every answers to them and it's usually the CEO or the president of the company the owner of the company here in Canada it's the Prime Minister but above the prime minister is actually the king if we wanted to go that far and everything comes back to him the buck stops with him or the buck stops with hers the case may be but there's a supreme authority and this Dominion that the the scripture is talking about gives us supreme authority it means that that is what is available to our lives but there is sovereignty and we understood that that was self-rule nothing can force us to do something we don't want to do now that's a key because oft times what we have going on in our lives is because we allow it and because we choose it even when we fall away sometimes but we allow it and when we decide we don't want it that's when God goes to working but if we want it in our lives then it's going to stay there Satan's got every right cuz we're the ones that opened the door to him and then that third thing was absolute ownership and we talked about that because it's property rights it's the abstract title deed that we don't just own the land we owned everything everything above the land everything on the land and everything below the land nothing can come on our property unless we allow it and we've got Holy Ghost rights we've got word rights to push off anything that comes on our property but as we move on this series on adoption and as we start to close it down I know I keep saying it and it just keeps moving on and on but we'll be talking more and more about the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost we've talked about it it makes all the difference this is the key to all of this is going to be the Holy Ghost and when we recognize that it's the Holy Ghost in US that is Christ in us and we are submitted to Christ then we have dominion we have supreme authority over everything that comes against us but I want us to realize that sometimes the battle is not over what comes against us it's what's in us already and it's that self-will it's that human nature it's that flesh it's the Mind battles and these different things but it's the power of the holy spirit that overcomes in every situation by the word of God now I want to talk about what this looks like and in Ephesians 1 it says it says that the god of Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him we're talking about Dominion now he says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word we could say toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power now we've talked about this before this word power is dunamis and it is a reference to the power of the holy spirit in The Believer it is the literal literal powerful attributes of God in The Believer amen and notice that Paul says here in verse 17 he says that God did would not just give us a spirit he said God would give us the spirit amen it is the holy spirit it's his his Spirit itself of wisdom and Revelations and what do those things do it says here that it opens our eyes our understanding is enlightened the eyes of our understanding would be enlightened Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would lead us into all truth what you have need of he'll give you if you need it he's going to give it to you that's the truth that's required for our lives but not only that we would know it but notice he says here that we would know the the hope of his calling not that we would have hope but that we would know the Hope in other words that we would have the reality of a living Christ in our lives day by day it's not not just a knowing by by understanding but it's a knowing by experience that the believer has and then he says we would know the hope of his calling and the riches of the glory of his inheritance hey I'd be happy with just an inheritance but he says there's glory and there's riches that come with this inheritance it's a wonderful thing that he's offered us tonight church but not only in verse what he has in verse 18 you know with these things but he says now it's not just knowledge or understanding this isn't an intellectual Dominion I was telling my wife I was watching a man that that was trying to turn away acts 238 and he said that was only for the Jews because as soon as we see everybody else they don't get it the way the Jews did and I guess he completely ignored what happened to Cornelius I guess he completely uh ignored what happened to to the Samaritans but he said he went to the to the story of the unic in The Chariot where Philip was caught up in the spirit and he said that man was saved when he believed and then he got baptized and that's the path for the Gentiles but then we go see Cornelius who's a gentile and while he's yet preaching the Holy Ghost falls on him and it was exactly the way it was on the day of Pentecost why because he was trying to fit his Doctrine his church into the word what the truth could not come into him because he's satisfied where he's at he's satisfied with his church experience but I thought how sad that that man he's a PhD of Theology and he doesn't understand what sister Lydia understands this this evening how sad it is but the Holy Ghost is there to Open the Eyes of our understanding you know why that man doesn't believe in the Holy Ghost because he doesn't have the Holy Ghost you know why we believe in the Holy Ghost not just because the Bible says it but because we have it because we've experienced what this does in our life and that's what we're going to talk about this evening is that I can testify that there is a holy ghost available to the believer today because I've got it and I've seen what he does in the lives of men and women that that can accept it amen but because he says here that this is not just understanding and this is just not intellect but he says it's the exceeding greatness of his power in other words it's an experience and he says now it is not something you're doing but he says it's something I'm doing because it's my work that's doing this ministry of the mighty power it's him inside of us that's doing this notice the holy spirit is power but I want to say it this way tonight you don't have power the power has you amen that's the key to this is that we are surrendered and then it works through us and it looks like we've got power but remember what they said to Peter and John they said how did you do this they said we didn't do it it was the power of God that did it's through faith in jesus' name that did it they don't have anything it's something had them and it used them and it operated them to produce a healing in that man brother Ram said I'd heal you if I can but he says I don't have any healing power but I can take you to the one that has healing power amen it's the working of the power in us the key is not that we have power the key is that the power has us and it's using us and it's working through US day by day God's trying to do it and it says it's an effective work when he does it it's an effective work that word means it says according to the working the effective operation of his mighty power God's trying to do things in our lives church but you know the first thing he does he gives us a test so he can give us a testimony so we can go tell somebody we've got Mighty power working in our lives we've got a living God that's working in our lives day by day what are we going to talk to people about are we going to go talk to our our our our work colleagues about the the the opening of The Seven Seals that goes right over their head but you when you say God heal me God deliver me God show me what to do God warm me God preserve me that's something they can identify with that's the effectual working of the holy spirit in the believer's lives is it gives them a testimony that they can share with other people and so often we shrink back from those trials instead God's trying to show us what he can do in our lives when we'll just understand understand that he's there amen Our Testimony is the evidence of what faith will do in in a believer's life amen look what he says in verse 20 he says which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places the holy spirit is resurrection power amen remember we die first in this in in our souls and in our spirits and we die and we are born again as new creatures in Christ it's a resurrection power that's only the first fruits though of what's coming when these bodies go by way of the Grave or they go in a Rapture and we get a glorified body in a moment in a in a change in a twinkling of an eye amen this is the setting of us in places that we couldn't come to before we sang that song I thought it was so perfect when I couldn't go to him he came to me and now he's taking us to where he is because he came and took our place he made a way for us to go and so now we are seated in Heavenly places right now and that is where our Dominion is it's under the hearing of the word it's under the revealing of the word where is this place it's far above Hallelujah far above listen as humans I think we're satisfied with just enough but God is not a god of just enough God is a god of superlatives he is a god of exceeding he's a god of far above and he says where he has placed us is far above that's Dominion that's overwhelming superiority in in in in fighter battles in in in when you're you're flying jets and that altitude is the the key to Victory the one that's highest gets the victory when they have land battles the one that has The High Ground usually wins and he says we are far above we're not just above we're way higher way above it's not even close we're far above all principality and power and might and Dominion that means there's might out there that means there's Dominion out there Satan has some power Satan has some Authority he has some Dominion but we're way above it that means we're going to face battles because there are mights and dominions coming against us but we are far above it we are more than conquerors amen tonight he says we are that might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come you know I think about that and you know what we don't we don't put a name on it anymore of Satan but you you know what comes against us cancer amen high blood pressure heart disease family genetic traits and there's names that we put on these mental diseases everybody's got a mental disease these day everybody can be diagnosed with something if they spend enough time around medical professionals and we put names on them and all it is is satanic power that's trying to come into our lives we read last service about that box of rattlesnakes don't you take the box of rattlesnakes of a name that Satan tries to give a disease that he's trying to put on you don't ever confess that don't ever confess it cuz that's you taking it into your personal possession now he says and he hath put all things under his feet remember Dominion is supreme authority that's why he says all things are under his feet because he has Dominion amen he says and gave him to be the head over all things to the church there's our King there's our Dominion is right there it's Christ he says but let's see our place now because he's talking about Christ as all his Dominion but now he says what and has B ba him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth All In All We Are the fullness of the one that fills us look at what it says here it says which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all now here's our description Church here's our Dominion for in that body lives the full measure of him who makes everything complete Hallelujah who makes everything complete you say brother John I'm lacking something tonight you've got the god in you that makes everything complete he says and who fits everything everywhere with himself he makes us compatible with him and he makes us compatible with each other brother Braham said all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily today the bride is the fullness of Christ bodily on this Earth that's where we are today amen without you without me the body of Christ is incomplete so we've got to be in our place and position but I want you to come back to the quote that we read at the start of this service and I'm going to read it again because brother branam is placing us into Ephesians 1 which we just read and it's this quote that we read here he says right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure he says yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what's he doing he's pointing to Ephesians 1 and saying everything that comes against us has already been defeated every weapon's been broken every enemy's been defeated every wall has been torn down and all that's left now is a bluff that's all Satan has left for the believer is a bluff because if we believe the word then everything he's brought against us has already been defeated amen amen it's Christ in us doing these things and we're going to talk about how we can sometimes get our eyes on ourselves instead of him and that's where we fail but it's Christ in us but I want you to see that this whole world is groaning and and and just in labor for us to come into our position that's what the world is looking for and we know that that won't happen in its fullness until the millennial Reign when there will be peace for a thousand years and the lamb and the lion will lay down together and these things but there's a man estation of the sons of God now and there's a groaning now but it's in a spiritual condition and the world is groaning for the manifestation of sons because without the sons then the rest of them can't get their help sons are needed to produce more Sons not that we produce them but we go and we find them amen it starts with one in this church with brother Mark and then it moves to Sister Moren and brother Bob and sister Brendan meanwhile it's brother Gerald over here and what happens is they come together and where the spirit of God is it produces other Sons and Daughters of God so comes to one and it brings to others and so as we're in our workplaces as we're in our school groups and schools and these different things people are crying out and they're needing help and they don't know where it's going to come from and they don't know where to go and they've tried doctors and they've tried Psychiatry and they've tried medication and they've tried drugs and they've tried entertainment and they've tried money and all these things and nothing satisfies and there's a groaning within and it's only going to come sometimes through the Sons and Daughters of God that have found their place and they can say I can help you not by what I give you but where I can take you to the one that I can point you to we know many people and I know in talking with many of us we're talking to people that have great needs and they're searching and they're seeking and some of them are are are professing Christians very faithful and yet they're seeking for something that they don't yet have that's why we need to be steadfast and sure on what we believe to hold fast to have that meekness to have that humility to have that love to have that care for those that are around us because they're groaning trying to find what we've already had to F to get our satisfaction in this life but we've only got one answer and I said it last service in the service before were broken records there's only one remedy come to Christ and let him change you let him change you there's no promise that he would change situations but there's a promise that he'll change me and he'll change you into whatever we need to be to come through it people are crying out for help people have family traditions of failure we know them people that have been bound by by by family fults for generations and they're trying to break it and the only one that can break it is Christ amen people that are bound by addictions people that are bound by situations people that are feeling hopeless no choice whatsoever and the Only Hope they've got is that a son or daughter of God comes their way and says I've got a remedy for you cuz he's he's delivered me from those things brother Braham says what's everything wor waiting on what's the whole creation waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God it's waiting for the church to become into its position who was the son of God Adam and where was his domain the Earth he had domain over the Earth is that right and all the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested he says is that right it's waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through it just takes one one that he can work through like this saying there's my spirit flowing freely there it is that I can work he says here get another one over here and place them I can place him he says it's adoption placing manifesting take him out here and put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel tell him something he says now if he's told the truth now if he's just making up something that won't work no that won't work we've had a lot of that but he says I mean the manifestation of sons of God when God manifests himself and God say him out we need to know we've met with God you don't have to be a minister to meet with God you just need to know that he has come to you and revealed himself to you personally amen he says he sends him out he says and when then he goes forth and what he says is truth what he does is the truth what he does he manifests Christ he says and how do you judge him by by the way he stays with the word right with the word see that's how you know all man is by the way he stays with the word he says if they speak not according to the word there's no light in them says the B Bible That's Isaiah 8:20 if you're wondering he says leave them away what's God trying to do he's trying to show himself through surrender Believers it's not people that want to go do things it's people that are led to do things amen the scripture says sons of God are led by the spirit of God and what we end up doing we take what God gives us and we go running with it rather than waiting for him to send us out brother brah talks about those those two preachers that were out there and they got all aggressive with a brother and trying to convert him to their way of believing and brother says those two men need to be tied to the snubbing post and the snubbing post is what you tie a horse to so that it can't pull away and it keeps it tight so it can't get into trouble remember they said when when they finally got the Holy Ghost and these these denominational Brothers they said to brother Bram do we go seeking our gifts now he says no stay there just be humble and God will give to you what you have need of and then he'll send you out don't just run out let's wait on God let's see what he would have us to do I'm wanting to find his will because when I'm in his will he backs me up every time CU I'm on his path not on my path now that's where I have faith that's where I have confidence is where I've taken the time to meet with him and figure out what he wants to do in my life but I want to take us back to that thought on Dominion that quote we read and brother Bram says it's four things it's sin the World the Flesh and the devil that we have dominion over and I want to start with dominion over sin tonight you know and we want to turn sin into smoking and drinking and partying and all these things but we know there's only one sin and that's unbelief in the Garden of Eden sin was found in Eve because she disbelieved the word and everything after that was based on her disbelief her lack of belief in the word she got out from under that she acted on her unbelief and that brought forth the fruits of sin anden It produced the it brought a product of sin in our lives in our lives but we are not to be like Eve we're not supposed to fall that way we're supposed to stay true to the word but I want you to see here and I don't want to preach you know it can be my nature sometimes to preach these things as law but I want to preach them to you tonight as promises amen when I go into the word and and especially under a Grace Covenant I don't look at this as law I look at it as promises if there's a requirement the requirement is a promise that he'll help me to live the way he wants me to live not you must do or you must do or or else or else or else but rather if he requires it then he's got the power to make me live it the way he wants me to amen so let's listen as promises tonight I don't want to put any pressure on you but I want you to see the promises of God and I love the Books of John you know John was the one that was close to Jesus he was he was the one that laid on his on his chest and these things and we see there that John has a wonderful revelation of what the love of God does and I think it's a great place for the believer to be resting tonight he says whosoever abideth in him sinth not Hallelujah if I'm in Christ then there's no sin found in me he says whosoever sinth had not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous and he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning that means that those that Sin Sin from the beginning as well because they're of the same Source he says for this purpose now the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so we had an original manifestation 2,000 years ago but now it's Christ being manifested again and what's the purpose of the second manifestation to destroy the works of the devil in you and I he says now catch this this is our promise whosoever is born of God does not commit sin he says for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God and if you're not born of God it's like the scripture we read earlier he that committed sin is of the devil why because the seed of the devil is in him and it remains in him but I want to stop here and dwell on this because we're talking about dominion over sin and John says right here that he who is born of God does not commit sin John says it's impossible to commit sin but if I were to start from the oldest to the youngest tonight and walk down the the pews and say brother so and so did did you sin today did you think a wrong thought did you have a wrong attitude did you do something out of self-will instead of God's will did you do something in your own interest instead of your brothers and sisters each one of us would slowly have to raise our hand and say yes and the devil will point at us and he'll say gotcha John 1 John 3:9 says that whoever sins is is is of the devil and whosoever is born of God doesn't sin and you just sinned is what he'll say but the word of God can't lie church amen the word of God can't lie and if we are born again of him then the scripture says we cannot sin but yet we have this this now our reality is bumping up against the word and which one's right well what's right is the word and what's wrong is our understanding and Satan is always wrong because he's a liar amen so when he comes against you and says you've sinned therefore you're not a child of God you point him back to this scripture and then listen to these quotes that I'm about to read to you tonight he says who was the sin offering Jesus Christ who died for us Christ what did he die for our sins he took my punishment is that right and then how do I get into him by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and when in this body we're covered by the blood and free from the judgments that's step one he who The Sinner cannot sin why because there's a blood sacrifice laying for him da and night he says hallelujah he can't sin he has no desire to sin if he does do something wrong he don't mean to do it amen I say praise the Lord then brother Ram takes us to the scriptures he says the Bible says in Hebrews the 10th chapter for if we sin willfully after we've received the knowledge of the truth he says and he is the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin he that despised moses' law died under two or three Witnesses how much more sore punishment supposed so worthy those who TRS who's trod the blood of Jesus Christ under his feet and counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified with an Unholy thing and done despite to the works of Grace he says how can he says if they were judged under the law of Moses and now you knowing all things and You' been under the blood come and do that again he says you've Rec crucified him he says you made him out worse than he was he says it can't be done but we're at this disconnect then because we make what we would call we do sin every day that's the way we would look at it isn't it in our human mind we would say we sin but brother Adams he's refuting this and he's showing us the meaning of 1 John 3 he says for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and we are free from sin and we cannot sin what he's saying is if you're in Christ there's no sin in that body so no matter what you think about it it cannot be there he says there is an atonement waiting for us now catch this he says if there's still desire in your heart to sin you have never been baptized into that body because you are dead and your life is hid in Christ through God and sealed by the Holy Ghost that's a checkup quote do I have what I really say I have but catch this he says Christians don't sin what do they do brother bradam they make mistakes but they don't sin amen he says that's the reason they don't for he cannot sin he says' if I go down through the city here and the mayor of the city says Mr Brandon I know that you make sick calls there are speed limits the highest speed limit in the city is about 30 m an hour but I'm giving you permission to run 90 if you want to cuz I have faith in you that you wouldn't do it unless you had emergency call or somebody dying Yonder in a wreck he says I'll give you permission as the mayor of this city that you can run any red light do whatever you want to just go right on now catch what he says here he says how could a little two- bit officer ever arrest here arrest me out here making 40 mph in a 30 m Zone he says he can't I can't break any speed laws in this city because why he says I'm above the speed laws he says amen I hope you see it now I'm going to I'm going to explain this in a minute because that sounds like we can do anything we want we can do anything we want but with the Holy Ghost it'll be the right thing every time but he says and when we are are dead he's saying what does this look like now in our lives what's this Above the Law look like he says when we are dead God has recognized our repentance he's recognized our baptism he's recognized the blood of his own son which by faith has been applied he recognizes his for ordination and he knew that I do it and has recognized me in Christ dead he says and Christ died in my place when he was slain before the foundation of the world my name was put on his book as a Christian Hallelujah he says Christ died my death Christ is my sacrifice and God could not impute to me sin anymore he's given me the Seal of the Holy Ghost as a witness that I passed from Death unto life he says phw that does it I've been talking about the Holy Ghost and we can't escape this fact that that's what makes the difference it's the holy ghost or nothing it's the holy ghost or nothing but what is he saying here he says are we he says we are above the law is that what he's saying are we Above the Law I won't ask you to ask but I want you to answer answer it but answer it in your own mind are we Above the Law tonight he said we were but what does that really mean what we're Above the Law because we're no longer under the law we're under a Grace Covenant amen that's what it means Christ fulfilled the law at Calvary and now we have his righteousness attributed to us we've got a blood that covers over any mistakes we make and we've got the holy spirit in us in a sign to prove that God has accepted us God's not dealing with us under the law that's not where we are there the holy spirit's our proof our token it's our ticket to speed if you want to put it that way that Satan Can't Hold Us bound to something that Christ has already fulfilled cuz that's what the law is it is something that had to be fulfilled and once it's fulfilled the law is broken the law is broken it never applied as soon as Christ died then the law was broken and we came under a Grace Covenant so Satan can't now pull out the law and say you're lost because you broke this law we look at that and say Christ fulfilled that that law doesn't even exist on the books anymore I'm under a blood Grace Covenant now and here's my token and he's got to let us go the law doesn't have any ability to enforce on us because we're under grace now we can do whatever we want but you turn it into disgrace and it proves that you never came out in the first place we don't abuse these things notice what the scripture says the scripture says the wages of sin is death but we have Christ Living on the inside we have eternal life on the inside so we can't be living under sin which is the law and under eternal life at the same time brother Bram saying the Holy Ghost is the seal to prove that you pass from Death un life that you pass from law into Grace and so the law doesn't apply to us anymore what we became his Perfection and we cannot sin it can't be attributed to us because there's no sin in his righteousness there's no sin in him at all it's all given to us amen but like I said in the last service I don't listen to rock and roll anymore I don't listen to country music I don't go hang out with certain types of friends I don't watch things or read things of a certain nature why because those desires have been T out taken out I can say that genuinely tonight young people if you got those desires I'm telling you they can be taken away you know how I know because I used to love those things I used to do those things I used to be bound by some of those things I've talked about it I make no bones about the things that Satan had in my life but they're not there anymore but I don't feed the flesh because the flesh will love that every time you know brother B talk about rock and roll he says you put rock and roll in front of a baby and what do they do they start moving around don't they they love it because the flesh loves those things you put anything of Satan's in front of you this flesh will start loving it if you give it enough time right the black dog starts to overcome the white dog in your life and you'll start to get those things in there so if we're longing for the world on a daily basis it's for two reasons one of two reasons one we've never gotten the holy ghost or two we're feeding this flesh and that's causing us to think and dwell on those things that we ought not to do it's the only two ways because if you've been born again those desires have been taken out and so all it is is you've lost a battle with your flesh and the flesh is rising up and the only way the flesh Rises up and has Dominion is when we feed it that's it it's it I mean I've learned that a long time ago if I feed my flesh the flesh starts winning if I feed my soul then the Soul keeps winning and it's that simple every day amen but as Believers we can't disbelieve this word that's why we're called Believers is because we believe it sin can't reign in us we're built to believe we're built to accept it now we can look at our lives and I look at my own life and we can say but I only believe it so far today you'll believe it as much as you need to to make it through the next portal through the next gate through the next stage of your life God will raise up the faith to meet the challenge so often what we're looking for is the challenge for tomorrow while we're walking in today we need to just be where God places us and say Lord you've given me cuz what sufficient to the day is the evil thereof the test thereof we'll have the faith we need when we get there church we can sit there and you know I've talked with people recently about certain situations and I said I don't know that I have faith for that but I believe if God calls me to that situation I'll have faith when I get there amen I don't need to borrow trouble I don't need to tear down my current experience by a future possibility let's just dwell on what God's given us let's well on the blessings on the calling on the faith that he's given us for today amen but we're ordained to believe we're ordained to overcome we're ordained to make Satan's works of n effect in our lives that's what we're built for we're built for overcoming amen don't worry about how long it takes that's the that's the human side of us that's the flesh side of us amen is that we get caught up in time in instead of the word that says he'll do it that's the great trial for all of us it's a test of our faith is the time between the believing and the actual occurrence brother BR would talk about Sin we're talking about dominion over sin brother BR would say he says if you want to kill something he says you don't start on the limbs or the extremities he says you go for the head if an animal attacks you if one of us was was attacked by an animal or we wanted to kill it all you do is you get it in the head and that's what kills it brother says that's what he did at Calvary was he wounded the head and then the rest of it falls apart I saw a a a clip of a of a wildlife photographer and they were out walking and they had this Osprey that they saw in the water and it was in the in the side of a river there and he kept struggling and when they got closer they saw that he had tried to to catch a snake and the snake had coiled itself around him so he couldn't fly away and the snake was trying to drown him but when they got closer what they saw was that the snake was was was pierced through the head with the Talon not in its brain but enough that the snake couldn't do anything else except hold on and what they did is they had to unwind that snake and as soon as they did that snake to have wanted nothing to do with that Osprey anymore it just wanted to get away but it couldn't get away cuz it was held by the head I've gone after snakes when we were in Texas with with the way back when um back when I was quite a bit younger and and my cousin said hey let's go look for snakes and So eventually they caught one and I wouldn't catch one but they said you want to hold it and so you hold them up by the tail because they can only support so much weight so as long as you keep them out here that head can't get you but when they went to kill it they didn't cut off the tail they cut off the head that's what we need to understand is that when Christ cut cut off the head when he took the keys of death Hell In The Grave everything behind that died as well so all of the sickness all of the worry all of the stress all of these things that Satan's trying to impose on US are as dead as the head that Christ struck at Calvary so when he kills the head then none of those other things we have to let into our life anymore the head's dead the rest of the body has to die and rot with it amen we talked about dominion over the Flesh and I'm not going to you know Paul says that I Crucify My Flesh daily it's a daily thing and so I don't want to dwell on that so much this evening but I want to go into this one of he says we have dominion over the world and we know that the world is a big trap amen it is it is designed to trap us into things with a false promise of what it can offer and then every time it disappoints Us by what dangling the carrot just a little bit further you've seen that thing where they put the carrot on a stick and they put it in front of an animal and that animal will go wherever that carrot is in front of it it can never get the carrot and that's what this world is it's a carot that we never get it's always there this flesh can never be satisfied what Satan offers can never satisfy us and so we have all these things and we want recognition we want a career we want money we want stability we want a great work life balance whatever it is and Satan says I can give you that and it's just a carrot that's dangling and we never get to fully taste the carrot it's not wrong to want those things it's not wrong to want peace in our life it's not wrong to want stability it's not wrong to want to have money in the bank account but how we seek after it is what's going to determine what's really leading us amen Christ said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will add he'll add unto us amen otherwise we're going to be seeking a satisfaction that we can't get I remember now I think it was with purpose that this happened but when my wife and I we were in Edmonton and we were making good money and and we had no real debt and and and just everything was good we had our health we had finances we had a great job I had good career prospects and all these different things and we kind of just looked at each other and said if this is all there is to our our walk then this is silly it's pointless it's not that we weren't uh uh children of God it's not that we didn't have the Holy Ghost but these these things of the world are not satisfying you can have all the money in the world you can have no debt you can have money left at the end of the month you can have great health you can have all of these things but there is no satisfaction in those things for a child of God there not not there I mean there's there are those here that have a lot and there are those of us that have little or less than that but regardless I found you know my wife and I were were talking about it and when we lived in Texas you know I just finished my engineering degree I was making $32 $34,000 a year we were like this much money left at the end of the month it was so tight but you know we found that even in those times God was still good God was still God he was still Jehovah Gyra amen he was still the god of our lives and I think sometimes God will hold us back a little bit just to see if we'll be Fai faithful when we don't have much when we'll still be faithful in our time in our commitments and these different things if we won't complain so that he can bless us with more because he knows that we appreciate what he's done for us already Paul says this in Galatians 4 we're talking about dominion over the world he says even so when we were children we're in bondage we are slaves we are servants we are addicts under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman and made under the law to redeem that were under the law them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons he says and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father church we need Holy Ghost anointed ministers we need Holy Ghost anointed parents we need Holy Ghost anointed friends and family but you know what we need more than that we need to be holy ghost anointed and we can surround ourselves with those things but until it happens to us it does us no good we don't get the full benefit of it amen we can be surrounded by Victory but until we get the victory in our own lives it's not going to do us a liqu of good we're on the outside looking in and we won't have the fruit of the spirit we won't have the the peace The Joy the rest the victory the love all these things that we crave as children of God but he says when he sends forth that Spirit when it comes into your your heart he says after that he says wherefore thou are no more a servant you're not bound to what you were bound to before it doesn't have any hold on you he says but now you're not in bondage to the world but you're a son you recognize you're a son and if a son then you're an heir of God through Christ let me tell you we're in leoda and leoda is all about what you have now it's we know it's a religious spirit but there's also a a carnal Spirit that's there so there's this the the this Spirit of trying to get stuff everybody's trying to get ahead every everybody's trying to get what the person next to them have Envy ambition jealousy these different things are great Tools in Satan's hands and we love stability we love to know that we've got enough to make it through the month or through the year and these different things but it's not just the young people that get caught up in that it can be us in the middle-aged side of things where we're trying to get more and trying to come to that stability rather than walking by faith day by day amen the Walk of a Christian is a walk of Faith always because he can take it at the drop of a hat and what are we going to do then our faith cannot be in our bank account balance it cannot be in the security of our job I had such a great job in Alberta I thought I was intouchable we had done tremendous things to grow the bottom line we had grown the business hugely we had great success we had a great model that was working really well and then in a drop of a hat some idiot made a decision that they could manage everything from 12 and 1 half hours away over in Australia and laid off a bunch of managers and in a moment like that for the sake of saving a few salaries they destroyed all the work we did and it took them s years to realize the mistake they made but what was it doing God was getting me out of my comfort zone to where I would now step into what I needed to be and do which was Ministry not to become a president or a CEO or a VP or these different things but to get me focused on where I needed to be so my hope then could not be in my bank account in my career prospects in my education in my experience My Hope had to be that I'm a child of God and God is leading me and he'll provide for me no matter what in the good times and in The Bad Times amen it's all a part of the Walk that we have you know when we get comfortable that's when Satan tends to slide in because comfort means we don't need God we need him but in our mind we'll say what do I need God for and what happens is our devotions cool off Church attendance cools off that fire inside burns down and we get cold we get cold when we're comfortable the leans we're comfortable people we're living in an age that seeks comfort and we've got churches that are full of comfortable Christians God help us if we only preach what will Comfort amen there's some there's certainly some checkups this evening that we're going to get into but Peter would say this he says be sober be vigilant take things seriously and always be looking around ground he says why because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour now you say I'm still coming to church I'm still paying my ties I'm still faithful but is he devouring your time is he devouring your energy is he devouring your fellowship see we can we can be in here and do our forms and our habits of Christianity but if we aren't living an overcoming life then he's devoured something that belongs to us you know we he says here he's as a roaring lion walking around and we think well it's going to be obvious if it's a roaring lion if he Roars over there I'm going to go over there but you notice when a lion roars it's not because the Lions you're looking out for or where he is see we run away from the Roaring line and you know what happens we run right into the lions that are waiting in Ambush that's the way the Lions Hunt is they have some sitting quietly and some that are moving you towards the thing that you don't even know is there it's the Lions we don't hear that are going to get us but it's the fear of the one that we can hear that runs us right into the thing that we don't see many times Satan's subtle that's what I'm trying to get to is when you see the big things you run from it and then you forget the little things Satan's religious he has to be because he's sitting literally in the Churches of God being worshiped as God the scripture says he's subtle and he's religious he didn't get Eve by coming up to her and he's not going to come into our lives and say hey how you doing I'm Satan I've got something that's going to make your life miserable today he does not identify himself the scripture says that they come as angels of light that's how subtle he is that's how religious he is so Satan comes in and it's very subtle we've got to be vigilant we've got to be sober we've got to be careful we've got to be always on guard because he's trying to get in all day every day Satan doesn't take breaks he's always trying to get in at us but B would say this he says but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this we're now Living Church that means listen up no day has been like what we're living in today he says it is the most cunning deceitful day he says and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toes today than he ever was in any age we're supposed to overcome the world to do that we've got to see that it's going to be the subtle things it's the small foxes that spoil spoil a grape vine it's the little things that he brings in that slowly erode our Christian experience and bring us to a place where we're cold and formal and we don't even know how we got there Jesus would say this he's talking about the parable of the S he says and some fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up and choked it and yielded no fruit see Jesus said that your fruit would remain was his purpose he says but this it only got up so far but it didn't come all the way to yielding fruit and then they go and they ask him they say what does this mean and in verse 18 He says and these are they which are sown among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful notice what he says here the first thing that gets him is the cares of this world remember what I said last service I said when we say we don't have a choice what it means is we've already made a choice and something has dominion and our choice determines what that Dominion is we always have a choice and the choice is the word of God or everything else and if it's not according to the word of God we can wrap it up in a skin of religious whatever but if it doesn't match the word of God it's just Satan being subtle again amen we can't serve God in man we can't serve God in money we can't serve God in career we can't serve God in education we can't serve God in family we serve God and everything else comes beneath that that's the only way it works but I was looking up this word before we go into the cares of this world that word world is not the one we typically think of which is Cosmos it says but the cares of this age this is literally a leody Dean scripture for us the cares of this age in other words the challenge of the age the problem of the age the anxieties the stresses the issues overcome the people and what happens is it overcomes them by their five senses and it completely pushes the word away but notice it doesn't say that the hearing of the word is the problem these people have a witness of the word these are people sitting in churches where the preaching of the world of the word is so don't put it on denominations tonight this is people that are hearing the full word but he says what happens is the cares of this world Amen and it chokes the word it takes the life out of them it takes the effect of the word out of them it takes the life of the word out of them cuz the life was there to start but it chokes it out and they can't produce the fruit of the spirit they don't go all the way they come so far and then what happens is things take over and you see what's taking over people today we've got high taxes We've Got High Cost of Living cares of this world right climate change social media social justice issues we've got all these things we're just half of us are just struggling to make ends meat and it's so consuming and people are so wrapped up in it that they forget that there's a God that provides our every need and so we make [Applause] choices based on the cares of this world rather than the kingdom of heaven and what does it do it chokes out the effect of the word in our lives what happens is we get cold that's all we get cold we get formal we still come to church we still pay our ties but we know that in our lives there's not the same thing that used to be there anymore it's Satan that's come in and just slowly eroded what we had brother Braham says this check up moment number one he says now we find there's trouble what's the matter he says something's taking place the ship is rocking the wind is blowing Satan is buffeting the ship blow after blow wave after wave Satan remember the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a what a flood Relentless isn't it sometimes it is Relentless he won't let us rest that's when we've got to be careful because we can make up an excuse for why we're not doing the things we ought to do too busy don't have time to slow down don't have time for this got to do that no no no no he says and all hopes is gone to have another Revival testimonies are dying out they'd rather stay home and see television see no more Wednesday night testimony meetings and Things No More prayer meetings see the ores are broke the mass fell and the helm all's gone the winds have knocked all the sails down he says and the cares of this world will soon knock all the testimony out of you too he says you feel ashamed to get up why he says you know you know what you're living He says you know you're not living up to that he says and then I tell you what we need is a Revival never let where you're at stop you from coming to him sometimes we just get cold church but the thing is say how did I get here and if we look in sincerity I believe in the word and we go in prayer before God God will point us right to where we walked away from where he wanted us to be I've seen it in my life many times and he's always waiting right where you left him he's faithful he's like the it's like the prodical son he's waiting to see you a far off if you're coming back to him and he'll meet you he'll meet you but we've got to say Lord I've grown cold Lord I've fallen away Lord I've lost some steps I've lost some possession in this land brother BR would say this he says the great Royal seed of ab Abraham his spirit is here tonight his promises are all true he fulfills everything that he said but then he ask this question why is it that some setting will be healed and others will fail it's a good question he says just because that you try to keep a little bit of the world around you a little bit just a little bit he says turn loose everything then what do you do be simple and look to God and believe it with all your heart hold on to it he says it's got to come to pass God promised it there's nothing can keep it brother B remember coming through the prayer line if people had something in their lives the Holy Ghost would call it out and he'd call him aside and he'd say you got to make something right you got to change this you got to do this you can't come through until this is finished till this is fixed and they go make that right or he'd say will you do it and they'd say yes and then he pray and they would almost always get healed but sometimes the things that's holding us back is things we're holding on to and we've got to let go of that we've got to lay it aside so that Christ can come in and do something deceitfulness of the cares of this world but then he says the deceitfulness of riches and that's the layout of see and curse I've got everything I need therefore I am blessed that's not proof of the blessings of God the fact that I've got a bank account full of money that I've got a nice house I've got a nice car I've got a good job I've got a good family that is not proof of the blessings of God because what the layer to Sea and age is the greatest that is self- deceived it's a self- deceiving age we've got to line ourselves up with the word not just look at our lives and say I've got everything I need listen there's people out in this world have more than we do and they don't have anything of God so why would we say that because we have it we're we're in a perfect place that's not it brother Bram says it's not the sunny skies that are proof of his Blessing nor the Cloudy Skies proof of his disapproval Life Is Life and he brings things our way as we need it amen but these worldly riches aren't Christianity I've been broke and I've been well off and through it all God was good and we saw the working hand of God and the provision of God in many times and I've told the testimony of coming to church and we needed $90 to make our payment for our insurance and we've been away and and uh and there was nothing coming in it was a Sunday nothing nothing hits the bank on on Sundays on the weekend and we needed $1 and something dollars $90 or something like that and we pray about before service and then when we came out brother Bob handed me an envelope and said this came for you in the mail cuz they were holding our mail while we were away in Halifax and we opened it up and there was a check for hundred and something dollars so we had enough to pay our insurance bill we deposited that afternoon went into the bank so we didn't have an overdraft which is a huge deal when you're a student and we had enough to go to Mary Browns and buy N9 for $9.99 which you'd never do today that would be $34 I think what he knows what he's doing and listen Church whether he's providing the $107 that we needed or he's providing in the $50,000 you need for whatever it is brother Chad he's a God of all situations I'll tell you what we learned then we were desperate we're poor students we can't afford the 40 bucks that they charge you every time that you go into overdraft we'd already had that happen to us and God had already known seen and provided the answer that's it sometimes the greatest things that happen in our life is when we have so little cuz we see what happens when we trust God cuz we know we can't do it on our own but that's the secret whether we have more or whether we have less is that it's all him no matter what and we'll see as we get into this that's one of the things that Satan tries to hold us back with is we look at ourselves instead of looking to him amen but we've got a promise we've got a promise that these things won't hold us back we've got a promise that we've got dominion over the world and the things of the world and we come back to First John again he says ye are of God little children and have over come them have it's a finished work listen when he wrote in Revelations 3 to him that overcometh I'll Grant to sit on my throne for the latest in church age that was in recognition that there are going to be Overcomers we're written right into the Bible there he says ye are of God little children and have past tense overcome them who the Antichrist Spirit Satan's working in this age he says why because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Listen the victory I have cannot be greater as he that is in brother Mark or greater than he that's in Sister Lydia or greater than he that's in brother Dale or sister uh Kimberly it's got to be greater as he that's in John klet I've got to see it that way I can't see it as in somebody else I've got to see that he's in me otherwise I'm going to lose the victory every time brother says this a very familiar quote I know but it Bears repeating overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks what be sober be vigilant be on the lookout he says a lot of people says there's no devil it's just a thought he says don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil but don't just say I've got an an adversary I've got somebody that's fighting me I've got an enemy I've got something that's holding me back that's trying to hold me back he says then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you that doesn't give you overcoming power that's discernment but you got to have more than discernment I can tell when somebody's shooting at me but that doesn't help me keep them from hitting me it doesn't keep me safe to know somebody shooting at me he says he says and when you recognize him know he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome this is what's our part he says You must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him he says and by his what Grace by his grace you are more than a match for him he says amen that's real overcoming when you recognize see sometimes that takes a while remember we read that quote brother B says it takes sometimes it takes a Son of God a while a while to realize he's a Son of God sometimes it takes us a while to realize that greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world but we got to remember it's in me it's god in me that's doing this work it's not me that's doing it that's why we have to feed our faith daily and crucify the flesh daily it's two sides of the same coin I'm putting one down and I'm building up the other so that there's no room for Satan to come in amen that's why we stay close to God every day is because we've got to recognize there's something going on in me there's someone living through this life that I've got so that when the battle comes we're built up and we're ready for it to say hey not any step further you're not allowed in this house you're not allowed in my life you can take that box of rattlesnakes back to where you got it but watch this okay Prophet God saying okay you got to recognize Satan recognize every one of his tricks that's step one to overcoming two recognize that greater is he that's in you now watch how he shows us how Satan tries to keep us from doing that he says you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that what looking at your faults and your failures and saying because of those I don't get to overcome he says then no he says you're defeated but what's the antidote to this he says but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he says then then you realize that you've overcome when you can get past your conscience when you can get past these things that Satan brings up about your past even about your present and say that's not what I'm trusting in I'm trusting in the Holy Ghost that's indwelling my life in my heart today he says then you realize that you've overcome and you know that he's a devil you can't say I got a sickness and I don't believe it's a sickness he says oh yes it's a sickness you got cancer but you don't believe it's a cancer it's a cancer he says but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you must must must must recognize realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already already overcome this thing he says and he's in you and you can overcome by him he says that's exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture is written overcoming what is it you've got to know that you know that you know that the Holy Ghost is inside of you church and when that is settled everything else will be settled in time in time don't think that it suddenly makes you able to overcome every single thing because we've still got a develop character we've still got to prove our faith God's still got to give us a testimony you will never see anywhere in scripture where every single person any person walked through life and never had a moment of a trial of their faith where there was a gap of time between when they believed and when they received it even Christ had to wait three days before he was raised from the dead amen we all have a trial of our faith don't let the time barrier hold you back from believing you got the Holy Ghost amen first John I'm loving first John for whatsoever is born of God how do we get the New Birth by one Spirit he says for whatsoever is born of God overcometh you know what I love about that that means continuously overcomes not just yesterday not just tomorrow right now forever whatsoever is born of God overcomes continuously Moment by moment day by day you've got victory in your life he says overcomes what the world he says and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith what it's our personal revelation and this is not just human Faith this is just not personal faith this is the faith of Jesus Christ Paul said he says I live the life that I live I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen that's our day-by-day faith church this is not like I said a law this is a promise this is something we can go to God and say God I'm looking for you to enforce this in my life I'm looking for the Holy Spirit to give me overcoming power day by day by day don't put pressure on yourself put pressure on God if you you want to put it that way and say Lord I'm living my life as clean and as as close to you as I can and when I do that then the rest is up to you I can only do my best the best is not what overcomes it's the power of the Holy Ghost Inside of us that overcomes because we're born of God we're born of the spirit brother B says this he says the holy spirit separates us from the things of the world from the cares of this world and our whole affection set on Christ Jesus whether we live or die what do we do we serve him and we love him and we go forward go forward go forward go forward he says doing all that we can to Magnify Him unto the people do we have dominion over the world church we are more than conquerors we are more than Overcomers through Christ who died for us amen he says we have dominion over the devil now this is the big bad wolf isn't it see it's one thing to talk about demons it's one thing to talk about sickness it's one thing to talk about life's trials and tribulations but now we're talking about the personality the very one of evil the son of predition the origin of all of these things it's one thing to fight a Philistines it's another thing to fight Goliath isn't it this is the Goliath now coming out this is the big dog amen this is the head of all principalities and powers on this Earth and you know what he's extremely logical and extremely reasonable that's what makes him so difficult so many times is he makes so much sense that's why he got that's how he got Eve he got her into reasoning instead of stain behind the protection of the word of God brother Braham says God gives us the greatest weapon that you can have and he says it's the word of God and as soon as we lay it down Satan's got us because he's way better at logic and reasoning than any of us could be he's subtle he's not obvious he's smart he knows how to reason but I want to read our portion in Hebrews 2 says for as then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also likewise took part of the same he says we go through Flesh and Blood realities we live life in flesh and blood and so he came down to do the same thing we do but he came for a different reason and with a different effect it says that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil so what Christ did destroy the power of the devil it didn't just destroy the power it destroyed him says that is Christ's Dominion because he took Satan's best shot and he rose on the third day and he came up with the keys to everything that Satan held a bunch of broken weapons in a house that has no lock that works anymore he says and what does he do he delivers them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage remember we read in the scriptures we were that we're no longer servants we were in bondage to the things of this world he says but now we realize we're children of God we're not bound by fear that's Satan's tool is fear it's always fear that's why we make decisions against the word of God is because we fear what could happen rather than what could happen by the word We Fear Satan's effect rather than believe God's effect that's the things that jump out at us speaking of Christ he says at the age of 33 Jesus owned everything he made the world he says he was in the world and the world knew him not he never made himself a reputation he never gathered any military man he never or organized any churches he never made any great names for himself he never come forth with any boasting degrees of Doctrine Theology and so forth he never had a record of him ever going into any School of Theology he says but he had God you'd think today with all of the Mega Ministries that they'd have God but it's the one thing they're lacking and you see it in the effect of their Ministries is they've got everything except him they've got wealth Fame Fortune influence and they don't know anything about Christ he says and at the age of 33 he had conquered every devil that stuck his head out of hell he conquered sickness he conquered superstitions he conquered Devils he conquered death and when he died at the cross he descended into the Bottomless Pits of hell and conquered hell and on Easter morning he conquered the grave why catch this he played the rules of the game right running with the message we have to stay with the word for our day we we can't overcome by somebody else's word somebody else's message we've got to run with the message of our day he says he was and he gone go God sent him and he had a message to tell them and with the message that God gave him he conquered the powers of Satan remember what brother BR would say he said he conquered him by three words it is written he said showing that even the weakest believer can conquer anything that Satan brings against them it is written we conquer by the word we conquer by the word and then what enforces the word the Holy Spirit that's it if the only words that come out of your mouth are it is written Satan won't stick around for long because there's no reasoning there's no logic there's no arguing with somebody that only does the word if everything that comes out is it is written it is written it is written Satan gets real tired of that real easy because you're under the umbrella of the word he can't get to you he can't touch you as long as you stay there he says he with the message God gave him he conquered the powers of Satan he conquered sickness conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave why because he went go tell I always do that which my father shows me to do I do nothing but what he tells me to do but watch this he says then before he died he said even as the father has sent me so send I you not to build Men by military strength not to put all your time in who will be president that might be essential but it's not essential in this the world is gone so don't get tied up in it he says we've got one message that is Jesus Christ this raised from the dead and he's the same yesterday today and forever you know the scripture says that there'll be a famine of hearing the words of the Lord in the end time it's sad to see how people have painted them into a into a box of unbelief by taking the word of God and making it of no effect my wife shared something with me there's a pastor named Dwayne Miller and they didn't have video of this I would have loved to see the video especially since it happened in this Modern Age but it was on recording when what happened was he had a a a disease in his throat a condition in his throat he'd been to many doctors many specialists they couldn't do anything about it and he's literally talking about the the Isaiah 53 I think it is with by his stripes we are healed and he was saying now that doesn't mean that God will heal every person and I agree with that because we see that God doesn't heal every person but I believe that he heals the Believers I do believe that brother Bram taught us that the scripture teaches us that he says but I also don't believe that God that as they say today God doesn't heal anymore he says we can't put God in a box God we leave the sovereignty of those decisions up to him but as he's talking about this so he's saying I believe God heals that's his confession is I believe God heals I don't believe he heals everybody but I believe he heals and he's able to heal even today and as he's talking his voice starts to change and he doesn't realize what's happening until he's literally completely healed and then he starts to choke up and he says I don't know what's happened he says I don't know what to do I don't know what to say because he has just experienced the supernatural Sovereign healing of the Lord Jesus Christ in his body what a wonderful thing to see but then we've got the vast majority of churches preaching that was only for the day of the apostle and nobody gets healed because what there's a famine for the hearing of the words of the Lord they made the word of no effect and we see here that he conquered every single devil every sickness everything that comes against us he conquered and we're supposed to have a taste of that victory in our very lives today and people are preaching it's for a different day what a shame we read this earlier in 1 John 3 but I want to highlight it again from a different aspect says cuz we're talking about dominion over the devil we're starting to close he says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning but for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil Dominion is destruction of anything and everything that opposes total Destruction supreme authority Supreme destruction it's a finished work it's a total Deliverance brother Brandon would preach about we sometimes stop so much earlier than we have to we're satisfied with our progress rather than a total deliverance and God never promised a partial he said kill everyone destroy everyone he came to destroy the works of the devil does that mean that we would hold back and say no we'll deal with a little bit of it no it's the same manifestation today it's the same Spirit of Christ it's meant to destroy the works of the devil he it says and whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God we read that earlier about the law we're under grace and there's no part of the law in it that's the beauty of unmar favor there's nothing I can do to make me worthy of it and there's nothing I can't do to make me worthy of it I have no part in it it's all a work of Grace amen the only law is the Covenant that he bound himself to that said there be a bride there that's without spot without wrinkle perfect unblemished before him that's the only law is that he promised and he holds himself to that when he took our place when he took our place he gave us his place his righteousness his Perfection his position all of those things and he sent down the Holy Spirit as a down payment as a seal as a proof of what is available to the Believers and the finished work that he's in the process of doing in our Redemption today you know under before Pentecost men live great lives but not a single one of them could could Ascend up to where he was they had to wait but as soon as he went down what did he do he rose those Saints with him and he took them off to be with him their perfect lives under the blood of bulls and goats as good as they were and I would say many of them were better than I and maybe better than you it could never take them into their into God's presence it took his death his burial his resurrection his blood his Perfection to restore us back to that and in that time Satan had a right to accuse we see there that Satan's Up Before the Throne of God and he's accusing the Brethren he had a right to brother Brown would say it's because the the sins were covered not erased there was still something there he still had something but as soon as that Holy Ghost came down on the day of Pentecost what did it do it took away Satan's rights because now we're standing perfect and accepted and God won't allow anybody to stand there and impune the good nature of his bride he won't stand for it anymore that's the down payment of fully destroying the works of Satan what's the finished the scripture says the final thing that'll be destroyed is what death we go into Resurrection we go on a Rapture that's the last thing that'll be destroyed but everything beneath that will be destroyed in our lives before we get out of here that's the dominion over Satan that's the dominion over the devil that we have today and we get to experience that it starts in our soul the first place is always a soul but that Holy Ghost starts to do a work then on the spirit and it starts to work out into the body until this whole thing is bound up in the power of the Holy Ghost and Satan is bound he can't touch us it's the temple of God he has no place there he has no right there and a People is holding that token deed that title deed that Abstract title deed and saying you got no right to be here Satan and we defeat him by the power of the Holy Ghost Inside of us brother R puts it this way as we close he says on the day of Pentecost he sent down the Holy Ghost to continue through the Gentiles to take out a seed of promise to give to the Gentiles the offcast to give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring them into the promise he says now we have a right to conquer all sickness that's a lot of pressure he says we don't have to conquer it it's already conquered we just have to claim the promise and go take it it's already conquered death is conquered hell isqu conquered sickness is conquered temptation is conquered all Devils is conquered hell is conquered death conquered the grave is conquered he says we stand in the gate taking it don't have to fire a shot it's already been paid for he says his enemy he'll possess the gate how many he says thousands of millions he'll possess the Gate of his enemy which one every enemy he rose from the dead we possess it because what he gave it to us it's all a free gift and besides that and everything that he has done and conquered every gate he conquered sickness and took the gate the only thing we have to do is walk up to the gate and say in the name of Jesus Christ the Conqueror amen he says and we who are dead in Christ are Abraham's seed and we are more than conquerors through him who conquered everything for us no reason for us to have to overcome anything because it's already conquered he says The Last Enemy sickness death Temptations all things are put under his feet and we are the Seed of Abraham being dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed what does this look like church marching on Victory to Victory to Victory holding God's promise out before us and going on he says Abraham SE with a swarm Promise by Jehovah God that he will possess the Gate of every enemy what are we afraid about what are you afraid about what am I afraid about this evening can I tell you where I get afraid when I say I don't think I can do it when I say I don't have it I don't have enough I've never done this before I've never tried this before this is bigger than me this is bigger than anyone else that's ever tried it what is it I'm looking at me I'm afraid of me I'm afraid of my capability I'm a of afraid of my strength I'm afraid of my discipline I'm afraid of my lack of those things that's why I'm afraid is because I'm looking at me remember what happened when Goliath came sorry we'll leave that alone when they went into Canaan what held them back from Canaan Church they said compared to what's waiting for us to battle us we are like grasshoppers we're little itty bitty nothings compared to the giants that are waiting for us over there and only two said we are more than able to take it why because they said he promised us it's for us they looked at the promise not themselves and that is how they overcame they overcame because they looked at the promise not themselves we get afraid when we say you've got to do it we'll never do it not a single believer has ever overcome by themselves he says what are we afraid about possess the gates we have God's promise do you have his promise he says we have his word do you have his word he says we have his holy spirit that's the only question that's left the word is here you tell me your problem I'll give you a word promise so the only question is do you have the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that would hold us back we're afraid we don't have what we say we have he says the angels are encamped about everything's in order every wall can be taken down he says it's already taken down look at look at Elisha or Elijah whichever one it was and he's out there and he's on the city walls and the the Chariots are all around them the Army's all around them and gahaz is standing there and he's saying we're in big trouble now and the prophet of God says there's more with us than there are them and he says what are you talking about and he prays and he says Lord Open the servant's eyes and he opened his eyes and he saw flaming Chariots of Fire in all the hills around them and he says there's more with us than there is with them that's what we've got to recognize the battle's not ours battle belongs to God not by might not by power by my spirit he says the every wall can be taken down it's already taken down there's more of us with us than against us he says the Son of God goes before us His Banner are waving and there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to meet a promise of God death can't stop at the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it we are more than conqueror sickness is conquered for you friends death is conquered for you habits have been conquered for you praise the Lord habits have been conquered amen I'm a testimony that habits have been conquered temptation's been conquered he says you say I got a temper I can't get over it it's conquered he already conquered it the great final Seed of Abraham there's no more conquering to do now he conquered for us now we by his grace through his promise just believe and hold on he says that's all we do it's already finished our sickness our transgressions he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we were healed amen God bless you let's stand if we would the musicians would come what hinders us dominion over sin flesh the world devil what hinders us when we forget who we are when we doubt our experience when we doubt our baptism of the Holy Spirit when we forget the works of God in our life it's always been a Marvel to me how the was talking with somebody about this the other day a Marvel how the children of Israel could forget that God was with them when he literally had a sign over them day in and day out Pillar of Fire by night and a cloud of fire and a pillar of cloud by day Mana falling every morning every need supplied your clothes don't wear out shoes don't wear out everything provided and yet they forgot all about him we've got to feed our Experience day by day keep reminding ourselves of who we are you know what gives me faith when I read about others that did the things that I'm looking to do cuz you know what you'll find is that they're just regular people like you and I we think that there are these great people that have these great gifts and these great things but literally the vast majority are just simple people that stood up and took God at his word that's it that's all God asks us to do see what he says we by his grace through his promise we just believe and hold on that's it set your mind and say Lord I'm not letting go like Jacob I'll not let thee go until you bless me Lord until you give me what your word says I'll hold on now if he tells us to make some changes we'll make some changes amen sometimes we got to do some letting go of some other things before he can give us what he wants if he wants us to change he'll make those changes he'll let us know but otherwise all he's looking for is somebody that'll hold on say God I believe you at I'll take you at your word and every day say Lord I'm taking you at your word and you keep reminding him and you keep reminding Lord I believe you Lord I'm trusting you Lord I'm expecting you Lord I'm going to testify of you and you wait and see what he does it may take years Church it may take a split second I think of that man Dwayne Miller and while he yet spake the Lord healed his voice like that there are things that I'm believing for for people that I believe would just happened just like that this the way God works so many times he terries for a while but when when he moves it's a sudden quick work and it's a finished work and we finally get to see the the fruit of our faith amen but we've got to hold on we're Believers we've got to believe the only way I can get there church keep feeding on this the more I read it the more I believe it the more I see it the more I say that belongs to me that belongs to this congregation that belongs to every son and daughter of God that's been born again amen let's believe it let's feed on it God bless you let's bow our heads Lord God Lord I'm asking you to open our eyes Lord to the place of Victory Lord to the place of dominion that we're resting in tonight not in our own Works Lord not in our own righteousness not even in our own Faith Lord but it's the finished work of Calvary it's the power of the Holy Ghost Lord and it's a quickened word in our lives that does it Lord I pray you help us to feed on those things Lord I pray that you'd help us to just draw closer to you day by day Lord that as we read of your word that we read of your promises Lord that we see our position Lord that we would say that is yay and amen and call other all other things as lies of Satan Lord let us not get into reasoning and logic Lord help us to just take you at your simple word Lord you don't make it difficult you don't hide these things from us Lord but Satan comes in and he tries to argue and tell us that they're not for us Lord I pray you'd help the people tonight Lord I include myself Lord I include myself Lord help us to see what you have for each and every one of us Lord that when you gave us the Holy Ghost you gave us everything we have needed to take us all the way into eternity Lord God lord may we let the power take hold of us Lord let us not wrestle with it or direct it Lord but let us yield to it and let it have its full and complete way in our lives in our bodies in our minds Lord in our habits in our temperament Lord wherever it is the need is Lord I pray that you would have your way in our lives this tonight Lord be with your people in the coming week Lord I pray your special Grace to each one Lord those that are sick Lord those that are in need Lord those that are cold Lord those that are feeling lost Lord
