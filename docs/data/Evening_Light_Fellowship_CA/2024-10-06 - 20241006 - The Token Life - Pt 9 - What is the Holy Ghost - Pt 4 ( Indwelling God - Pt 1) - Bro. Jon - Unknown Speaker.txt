your people Lord grant it this morning we ask Commit This service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you each one let's turn if we would to John chapter 14 good to see each one here this morning Nadine back again with her family and got sister darling guy here from Central and brought a another sister with her amen God bless you both it's good to see you both and then we lost two and we gained two so that's okay amen I spoke with brother Chad briefly this morning morning and he's with brother Dale langstaff at the church there in Southern Ontario so I asked him to pass on our greetings as well but uh amen it's been a good week I've had some things going on in my personal life that have been a challenge but I was just sitting in the office this morning and I was just so happy just God's given me some wonderful opportunities to witness and to talk to people and your heart gets full when you do that your heart's not full when you make a bunch of money your heart's not full when you get your new house or your nice car your heart's full when you find yourself walking in the will of God and he can use you that's the most fulfilling thing that you can have as a Believer is to do what God wants you to do and everything else just kind of Fades away when you do that and troubles and trials and concerns and these different things when we can say I'm about the father's business then everything else just kind of it just goes out of view doesn't it it goes out of focus and you're able to just you're content with life amen you're content with life and that so my heart's very full this morning very thankful to God for his grace amen John John chap 14 and: 16 this is Jesus speaking to the disciples this is the night of the Passover he's in the The Upper Room at the Last Supper he says to the disciples and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you amen God bless you can have your seats this morning we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and I want to we've been speaking on what is the Holy Ghost and I'm going to take a thought this morning there's no way we'll get through it in a single service and I'm trying to be a bit time conscious because we have communion and foot washing I know but I want to speak on indwelling God the indwelling god this morning and I know we're speaking on what is the Holy Ghost but really what we're talking about this morning is who is the Holy Ghost it is not a thing amen it is a person amen and it's important to answer this question because there's so many people are thinking there are many different things and I trust by God's grace not maybe not here this morning but we have to see what it is that that and who it is that that is dwelling in our lives this morning and you know we go back to the Old Testament and we see that the people were separated from God by a sin barrier God could come to us by his Sovereign will and he could cross over that barrier but we could not go to him amen there was no way we could go to him but God made a way that we could approach him and it was by the shed blood of an innocent animal and we were sinful the animal with sinless and he says I'll take the substitute I'll take the blood of that animal and that will allow you to approach me but only one man once a year could approach the presence of God where he dwelt in the temple of God and the holy of holies and so that man came in and he always had to come in with blood for himself and then he had to come in with blood if God accepted that then he came in with blood for the whole group and and and then after that then they could make their sacrifices and they could approach God in these different things but only once a year could somebody come in the presence of God that's all they had that's all they had and it was only everyone was left outside and really they were trusting the experience of that one man to let them know God's still alive God still cares God's present still with us in these different things but as brother Mark preached on a couple Wednesdays ago there was a way that was made amen and God Made A Way and it was through a kinsman redeemer and Christ came down and he was born a man he was born human he was just like you and I were except he was sinless and because he was human he could be a kinsman redeemer amen he could be a a price for us he could pay by his life and pay off that sin debt and it cleared our sin debt and it didn't just clear sin up to that point it cleared sin forever it's cleared sin in the past it cleared sin in the present and anything and everything we would do in the future it paid that sin debt for eternity amen when he came down that's the purpose of Christ coming to Earth the first time was to pay the price so that we could now come back into fellowship and relationship with God personally so we can become truly a part of the family of God like we were intended to from the very beginning now listen to this quotes he says when Jesus died at Calvary he settled the sin question forever forever before the father you know what that means Church it means when Satan comes to you and you have given your life to Christ and you've received what's at Calvary he cannot say you are sinful this morning that's the freedom we have this morning I'm not saying I didn't do it I'm saying he says I didn't do it and that's the one that counts is what God says not what I say so when Satan comes and he tries to convict me of things if I have repented if I have placed it under the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't belong to me anymore it doesn't exist anymore it's not on the books he can't see it and Satan's let there stuttering in the presence of God trying to accuse me because there's nothing there to accuse he's saying I know I've got it somewhere I took it on my iPhone I saw what he did and then he goes to his iPhone and the video is not there it's erased by the blood of Christ the sin question is settled forever so don't let Satan put sin on you that you put under the blood of Jesus Christ insincere repentance he says he settled the sin question forever before the father because he was a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was our kinsman redeemer now Jesus didn't come down and die just for me or die just for you rather he settled the sing question but it'll never do us any good until we accept it it's your accepting of him as your personal savior it's by faith that you receive it and believe it he says now in Hebrews 3:1 the Bible said that he's the high priest of our confession now he's sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions for us Upon Our confession Church doesn't matter what you say it matters what you say it matters what you confess it matters what you speak before the presence of God he says now remember it isn't how much you cry it isn't how much you repent it isn't how loud you can cry to God it isn't how sincere you can be it's how much Faith you have when you come to him he doesn't save you on the merits of your prayer he doesn't save you upon the merits of your righteousness he saves you upon the merits of your faith it's by faith you are saved he says and that's through Grace scripture says by faith through Grace are you saved and that not of yourself it is the gift of God it's something that comes from God in the first place but we can get to this place even in our prayer life where we think we have to say something in such a flowery flowery or eloquent way and all God wants is a sincere and honest heart before him that's all he's asking you to do you don't you know some some people pray and it's intimidating when they pray because they just seem to be able to string it together and it sounds beautiful and you're like God just loves that doesn't he it's so wonderful God doesn't give a flip about how you say it he cares about whether there's sincerity of heart behind what you're saying and all you have to say you know there's things I pray about and I say Lord You've you've heard me thinking about this you see what's In My Heart Lord can you deal with it I don't even have to spell it out because sometimes I can't even spell out what's going on in my life sometimes but I just take it to him and I say Lord you see my life you see my thoughts you see what's going on Lord will you take it and will you move in my life and will you change me and will you help me to do what I'm supposed to do I don't have to come up with some great THS and thises and no no no just a simple conversation in simple humility before him and say Lord you see what's going on here I am do your work in my life that's all he's looking to do but our faith is always shown by our works it's what James said he says he he says you got to show me your faith by your works and so if we come and we say we've accepted Christ as our Savior by faith and we keep on living the way we did before then there's a problem with our faith because the blood of Calvary is not just to to justify us to to take away our sin but it's to cleanse us it's to take away the desires of this flesh it's to bring these things into subjection and so if we say we've accepted Christ by by faith and nothing has happened in our life to change us then our faith is not valid we've got to keep going we've got to keep pressing we've got to keep believing we've got to go get something until something really happens inside of our life because a changed life always follows a faithful and true acceptance of Christ always we have to be changed how can you accept something that you didn't have before and your life not be changed it has to be a changing that goes on but we can look in the Old Testament at men and women that had the spirit of God upon them amen and it's true that they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they had the spirit of the Lord upon them what is the spirit of the lord it's the holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost they had no less of the spirit on them but it was not a sealing of their soul like we have today but it was an anointing upon their body upon their flesh even upon their mind but it wasn't necessarily permanent and it wasn't necessarily life-changing but yet it had power and authority with it amen I'm just going to read a couple scriptures to show you what I'm talking about to set a pattern in the scripture because that's where we ought to get our patterns from and speaking of Gideon it says but the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Gideon and he blew a trumpet and a beeser was gathered after him so God sends down his own Spirit upon Gideon and what does it do it takes Gideon from a place uh uh being a wimp from being a coward to being a warrior to being able to act upon what God wants him to do doesn't change Gideon's life forever but it gives him courage amen then we come down to Samson it says then Samson went down and his father and his father and mother to Timnath and came to The Vineyards of tinth and behold a young lion roared against him and what happened the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him this is a mighty anointing this is a powerful anointing and he rent he tore as he would have torn a kid as a as a baby goat and he had nothing in his hands he literally ripped that lying in two with his bare hands so the spirit of the Lord on Samson makes him supernaturally strong he didn't have that power without the spirit of the Lord he was as if you were I we see that because remember when the spirit of the Lord leaves him he literally becomes as you or I he says that's what happened if you'll cut my hair I'll become as weak as other men and he was but when the spirit of the Lord is upon him when the need was there an anointing from the Lord would come upon him and he would become super naturally strong then we have Saul talking to or Samuel speaking to Saul and it says and the spirit of the Lord he's he's he's prophesying over Saul he says the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man and Saul goes to the school of the prophets and as he comes in there the spirit of the Lord falls upon him and he starts to prophesy have never done it before and then the people said is Saul also one of the prophets but it wasn't SA was a prophet rather the spirit of the Lord came upon him and it caused the supernatural to happen in Saul's life amen he'd never done that before he does it one more time in the future but he doesn't have a changed life he just has an anointing on him and it does something that God does Amen that God does in a person the scripture even says God gave Saul a new heart did you know that it says go God gave Saul a new heart in preparation for the kingdom but it took the anointing on him to achieve anything that shows good intentions are not enough people will go to hell with good intentions because they don't have the power to act on them I never meant to or I wanted to I always tried but I could never do it that's not going to be enough it's going to take something greater than that then we see we go into a little further in first Samuel and now Samuel's before David it says then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so s DAV David receives the spirit of God upon him as an anointing that's the king anointing amen and David had that anointing on him all the days of his life amen we see the spirit of God what it was on these men and even in somebody as as as Fallen as Samson and Saul got to their life in their lives yet we see what a glorious thing it was when the spirit of God comes upon a person it does wonderful things amen but you'll see that an anointing upon you is for action rather than for change anyone can literally have the spirit of the Lord upon them and they can do Mighty things under that Supernatural anointing and so it is an anointing for works but it is not life-changing and it is not the working of a soul God would send his Spirit on people to do something that needed to be done he would bring Deliverance he would bring change he would bring judgment he would do all these sorts of things but those people were not changed eternally or completely under that anointing amen it was an anointing of on them but it wasn't in them and we would maybe treat it like a coat or a jacket where the anointing of God would come on them and so it's like if this was a super jacket and as soon as I put it on I get super strength and so I put it on and all of a sudden I can go down and I can lift up these pews without anybody's help and that's God coming down because the Pew needs to be moved and then that anointing goes away and I go to try lift that Pew and what happens nothing why there's no anointing to do it there's no anointing to do it God would send down anointing on people with purpose amen but we see that David under this anointing had an affair with a married woman and then went and killed her husband and nearly killed nabal amen we can look at Samson Samson goes down and visits a prostitute and then walks to the gates of the city and Picks Them Up by Supernatural strength the anointing had nothing to do with his soul had nothing to do with his good heart it was God had anointed him for purpose and that was to judge the children of Israel and to bring uh deliverance from the Philistines but that's not where we're at today that's not where we're at today amen I preached it before the anointing on King Saul was the spirit of the Lord and the the the anointing on King David was the spirit of the Lord it was the exact same anointing and it had completely different results Saul had victories the anointing gave him victories but it did not change his life and even with his new heart Saul could never come around to the place where D was where it was about the people and serving people and deliverance rather than self-image and preservation and pride and all these different things the exact same anointing why because they had different motives in their lives David's anointing David's motive was to what Serve the People and serve God and Saul just wanted to promote himself and that's what that's what led to his downfall amen but many wonderful Works done by people with an anointing on them and yet no Heart Change no soul change no life change none of these different things amen and so what happened is as they even these people these great Heroes of the faith when their lives came to an end they could not go into the presence of God and so they went to a waiting place they went to paradise and they waited there until Christ died and then as soon as Christ died scripture says that the graves were open there was a resurrection and they came forth out of it it talks about it in Matthew 27 and they went and they they they walked among the people for a while and then they were caught up into the presence of God it took the blood of of Christ even with people that had a wonderful anointing of the spirit on them to bring them into the presence of God Amen why am I saying this church I'm saying this because people will go on and on about the presence of the holy spirit in church and in their lives and the anointing of the Holy Spirit on your flesh will not take you into heaven it won't do it it won't do it it can't do it we see it in the Old Testament we see it in the New Testament I was talking with a friend last night at our house and he said and he reminded me he says Caiaphas the one that condemned Christ prophesied under a true anointing of the Holy Spirit and that man went to hell he crucified Christ he called the word as something of Satan but yet under that anointing he could prophesy and he prophesied 100% correct under that anointing amen like I said Samson's the greatest example of this that a man that could go and visit prostitute after prostitute and yet he could have the spirit of the Lord upon him for Supernatural strengths and Feats but yet completely flawed completely flawed and yet God was with him amen so we see that an anointing upon you is to put you into action whereas an anointing in you is to change you so that you can be trustfully used for action in the future amen one is to do with character the inside is developing that character and changing the will and desire the one upon you is God just needs something done so he puts it on whoever he will and that's his choosing that's the sovereignty of God God that he would do those things but I'm saying that because today we can sit and we can have a great church service and we can have shouting and we can feel the presence of God and we can have worship and all of these wonderful things and we love it don't we we love it when we can genuinely feel literally feel the presence and the anointing of God here and then what happens is we can walk right out that door and do things that Christians should never do why because it was something on us not in US amen it didn't go out the church door with us it didn't get into our car with us it didn't go into our homes with us rather that presence was here because God was fulfilling his word where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be there but when we go out the door there's got to be something in us not something on us if we're going to hold ourselves throughout the week that's the only thing that's going to do it amen we can have an anointing on us today you can come into church and you can be somebody who is not a prophet but an anointing can come on you this very day and you can prophesy you're not a prophet has nothing to do with your soul but the anointing of the Lord can come on you and you can prophesy you can speak in tongues you can go lay hands on somebody and they will be healed by your prayer just an anointing it's an unction it's a moving of God in the congregation for the edifying of the body but that has not one thing to do with your soul that's just your somebody that made himself available and so God can come down and do that that's it and guess what there's lots of people available for power cuz we love the power we love the anointing we love those things when they come but how many people want the surrender cuz that's where you have him in cuz he can only come in by surrender you can't just put on a jacket of God and walk out and Conquer everything you need him on the inside because the first one he's got to conquer is me not what's out there amen so God was using his his children with to do great things you look at Moses Moses maybe the most phenomenal man in the Old Testament the signs and wonders and and the relationship he had with God God spoke lip to ear with him God revealed himself to Moses as he did know other man in the Old Testament it wasn't until Paul came that God would reveal himself maybe in a similar way in fact Moses was the pattern for Christ that's how amazing Moses was and yet he did not have the Holy Ghost Inside but he could do wonderful things with these things and so what happens is there was an anointing on people but under the law they were in a holding pattern they had come out of something but they couldn't progress because they had this sin barrier there and so they're in a holding pattern of works works works works and it never held them the anointing on them never held they'd have judges come in and the judges would get things right and then the judges would die and the people would go right back into their sins the law never held them amen sin was a barrier they couldn't cross and they were in that place where they couldn't go back cuz they've been called out and they couldn't go forward because they couldn't cross the barrier they couldn't cross the Gap into the presence of God so they had this wonderful place of obedience without a life-changing experience that's a rough place to live church that's a rough place to live but that's what a religious EXP experience is is it's obedience without the Fulfillment of what you've been believing amen it's by your discipline rather than that but God said there's going to come a day where I'm going to cross that barrier I'm going to I'm going to take and I'm going to make a way across that Gap there's going to be a door open and you're going to be able to live the way you've been trying to live all this time amen and it was a time where he would dwell in his people rather than just rest upon them or be above them even as the case was you'll notice the presence of the of the pillar of fire never made the people serve God they still had their whinings their complainings they had their idolatry they had all these things all these things and the pillar fire right there the presence of God in their midst why because it takes them in here to really do the change now we read this before and so I'm going to I'm going to go through it quickly this morning but it's part of the foundation here and it's in Ezekiel 36 again and and and it's God speaking to the children of Israel but this is speaking to the to the spiritual seed not just the natural seed amen it's to the spiritual children he says then when I will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you this is preparation it's not the finished work but it's preparing for the thing that's coming he says a new art also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh so notice now that they've been cleaned they need an attitude change they need a mindset change they need a desire change and they need to be open to what's coming at the end of this so God is making them amenable to him he's making them friendly towards them him he's making them open towards him amen so that they could get along with God in a way they never could before so it's preparation but it's not the finished work yet but then in verse 27 he says and I will put my spirit personal pronoun my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and you shall do them see before they were doing works but they couldn't keep the law they couldn't fulfill the word but he says when I put it within you it will cause you you won't be able to help it when you have my spirit within you then you can't help but identify with the word you can't help but obey the word because his word is written in your heart it's living in your heart now and you can't get away from it your conscience won't let you get away with it you're the most unhappy person in the world when you know you're outside of the word of God it was it it was interesting talking to again this friend last night and he was saying you know there was a I was struggling in my life with with I had a desire to do right and I wasn't doing it and and it seemed like I do the things I didn't want to do much like Paul in Romans 7 and he says and I was talking to another another coworker and he says you know what do you do with that you know when when you want to do something but you know you shouldn't do it and the guy said what are you talking about he said and that's when I realized not everyone has something inside of them that checks them not everyone has a conscience the way a Believer does not everyone has something on the inside that says whoa hold on a second here do you really think you ought to be doing this and he said it was just a a mindblowing moment that there are people out there with no checks and balances in their life how blessed we are this morning we have checks and balances church amen but that's what that's what happens to a child of God is that God has put something in us that says hold on a second and not everybody has that the tears don't have that the weeds don't have that only the wheat has that amen it's the children of God that have that you always see scripture after scripture like we read the spirit of God Came Upon so and so and it was temporary and it was not an internal work but it was an external Force bringing them to do a great work and they could do those extraordinary things but their heart wasn't changed their life wasn't changed and that but you'll see this yet that never stopped the anointing of God their flawed personality their flawed human traits their their weaknesses and those things church God is Not held back by our failures and our faults and our weaknesses in fact his strength is made perfect in them amen but here's the thing neither is his strength made any Greater by our strengths amen it works both ways we add Nothing by our negativity and we add Nothing by our positivity it's God and God alone that's doing the work inside of our Lives amen that's sometimes the hardest thing is when we think we've got something to add and God's like are you kidding me compared to me what you have is nothing the greatest thing you have is nothing compared to the wisdom the knowledge the strength the the power the understanding of God but if we can surrender it now God can work through it and God can expand it amen but whatever God needed those men and women to do when that anointing came on them they could do it and Samson would go and he would tear a lion in half can you imagine tearing an animal in half a four or 500 lb Lion in half with your bare hands you can't do it those of you that hunt the Moose just trying to get into a hide with a knife is hard enough and he took that line and he just went then he goes and he kills a thousand Philistines with a Jawbone of a donkey against swords against heavy armor shamgar the spirit of the Lord comes upon him and he kills 600 people by himself 600 train Philistines with an ox goat a prod a piece of wood a staff of wood with a brass or an iron tip on it and he kills 600 Philistines with it when the spirit of God comes on them and man Gideon with 300 men destroys 120,000 enemy soldiers that's what the spirit of God on you can do and most of us would stop there and say praise the Lord I've got it and all they had was something that left it left and they were left with their own hearts and with their own desires and their own faults and their own failures and these different things but remember God came into all of this and he's got this Plan of Redemption that's the key through scripture I will restore I will bring you back I'll bring you back to your place I'll bring you back to your position I'll bring you back to your inheritance I'll bring you back to me I'll restore the unity that we had before this all began and so God comes behind and that's what Ezekiel 36 is amen is that it's God restoring his people back and what is he doing he's bringing Gods back to God we've said this before dogs produce dogs cats produce cats what do gods produce God produces other gods they're his children they are not the fullness they are not the all in all but nonetheless the scripture says that we are Gods right here right now we are not because we're in a time of character development but our inheritance is that we rule and Reign and we sit in the throne with him we sit in the throne with God ruling and reigning that's our original position amen why because Sons and Daughters of God have the nature of God in them and that's what he's bringing out it's the character the nature of God he's tying us to the word of God in this life so that we may move on to the next one when we go into the millenni and then we we live for eternity after that what do we see we have the character to do that because we've been made one with the word we don't see all that reality now but when we go to be with him that's when we receive the full elements of of our of our inheritance as Sons and Daughters of God and church it's going to take more than a church experience to do that amen a church experience will not return you to your position in Christ it'll make you feel good it'll make you feel safe it'll make you feel warm and fuzzy but it will not change you it will not listen we don't like character development anybody here like character development no good we're we're in an honest mood this morning it's good nobody likes character development because it's trials and tribulations but when we come out on the other side we love it we love it when we see that there's an element of God inside of us but what did it take to bring it out trials and tribulations we hate the work but we love the effect amen again speaking with this friend and he says I think it was Peter that talks about he says we go through these things and if we're exercised by them we get the benefit in other words if we realize what's going on and we embrace them rather than try and speak them out of existence rather than try and Escape them if we can Embrace what we're going through then it can do the work that is needed and we can get out of that trial and tribulation that test whatever those things are going through amen but it takes more than a church experience it takes more than the law it takes more than an anointing in the building the anointing in the building will bring you to a New Birth but it is not the new birth itself amen it'll take more than just an anointing Upon Us it'll take a greater experience than Moses had Moses got to see the back of God he was in the very presence of God God came down and spoke into Moses ear that's how close he was and yet that wasn't enough Moses was a Son of God but he needed the Holy Ghost he needed a covering of his sin before he could come into the presence of God what will it take Church it'll take verse 27 that's the only way we're we're going to get back we've got to have his Spirit within us to change us from the inside out and that'll produce the word in our lives amen see when we have an anointing upon us the anointing is not there trying to change us it's just trying to get us to do something that's all the anointing on you is to just put you into action amen and you can't change a person from the outside in can you brother Mark we were talking about this the other day that's what people are trying to do is they're trying to force it in by theology by Doctrine by a church experience by outward signs and wonders whatever it might be they're trying to get people to be something but you can't be what you're not you can't be what you're not and we can wrap it up in a cloak of religion we can wrap it up in a in a cloak of the presence of the Holy Spirit we can wrap it in a cloak of signs and wonders whatever it might be but in the end that doesn't change your heart it doesn't change your life and none of those things will will happen as needed remember what David said he says Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against the remember they have those what are they uh uh it start I don't want to say the other word because it means something completely different but remember they put the Jews would put it on their arms and on their foreheads they'd have a little box there and they put the word of God in there that won't change you carrying your Bible around won't change you they were what they were doing an outward work trying to represent the righteousness that they couldn't achieve on their own they didn't have it but they wanted to look good and so we can do all the these things amen but what would David say he says I've got to get your word in my heart and that'll get me to walk right that'll get me to live right that's what's really going to have a lasting effect is not on what I can say and do but if I can get the change in here it will force its way out because what you are is what you will be and if it's on the inside then that's what's going to come out amen you know let me stop here for a second I don't know your thoughts this morning I don't know what you've dealt with this week I don't know your mindset I might know your attitude a bit by having some interaction with you amen but we go through life it when you're born again those things will change and you will know it I won't know it for a little bit of time because it takes a while for the inside to come out out on the outside but what you will know is you know when your thoughts change you know when your desires change you know when your attitude changes and then that comes out in Works later but you know it so you say brother John how do I know when I've got the Holy Ghost I'll tell you one thing you'll notice a change on the inside your mindset your approach your desires will be completely changed because now it's Christ on the inside not you not the old man not the old woman that was inside of there and so you can sit here and I can sit here all day long and say I've got the Holy Ghost but in the on the inside of insights I know what I am and I know what I'm not and that's where my rest is is that I've had a personal experience regardless of what you might think about me now it matters what you think about me amen we're supposed to be able to see that we're Believers that we're Christians by the lives that we live but sometimes there's a lag between who we are and the change we've had and what it comes out cuz there's an undoing of all the mess that we've been stuck under all the mud that's piled up in our life it takes a while to dig out of that sometimes but then what comes through is life and we say oh my goodness wow wow what happened to her what happened to him what is it it's the Holy Ghost Inside of them changing their lives what's on the inside has to come out same thing if you're not converted if you're not born again we can wrap ourselves in religion all we want to but in the and your temper is going to snap your words are going to come out your response is going to be the way it's not supposed to be and people will say whoa what happened not that we never lose our temper not that we never make mistakes that's not what I'm saying but the general trajectory of our life is Christlike with the occasional wind going to humanity sometimes more than we want to but I'm saying that to say this if you want to see a change in your life don't seek the fruits don't seek the gifts don't seek the effects seek the change seek the change on the inside everything else will follow after that if you change what's in here everything has to change amen it'll change our heart it'll change our mind our thoughts our approach nature everything sometimes the biggest change that's needed in circumstances is me not the circumstance speaking with my wife as we were walking the other day and just talking about a certain situation I said when we approach these things the first first thing we have to do is say Lord what is it in me that needs to change not the circumstance not the person not my finances not my health Lord let's take a look at me first let's put me under the microscope in honesty and humility and insincerity and say Lord where's the work here cuz so many times church if he can change me he doesn't even have to touch the other person right that's where I'm at Lord start with me we sang that song Today send a Revival start the work of me first thing that starts Revival church is repentance and humility and you say I'm not where I ought to be take me there and that's what Revival is is it brings it to life in your life amen Jesus said in Matthew 12 he says wherefor I say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men this is the only sin that can't be forgiven and what is it it's when you call something that is of god and say that's of that's of Satan you say something is of God and you and then you say no no no that's not of God Amen there's a Grace for ignorance and Christ comes here amen and he's talking to the priests and they're saying Jesus cast out Devils by the spirit of Satan Jesus said that that that can't work a kingdom divided against itself can can't can't can't stand if I'm fighting in my own household how is my household going to stand he says I'd be destroying my own kingdom if I did that but he didn't come with judgment he says and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him Jesus is here as son of man that's always a prophetic Ministry so Jesus is here as a prophet and church what always happens to prophets they're rejected so prophets can't judge you for rejecting them because that's the way it goes the word they bring is what judges you but that man does not judge you cuz they know they're going to be rejected by 99.9% of the people so Christ is there as a prophet and he's there and with forgiveness and even to the point of his his last breath he says father forgive them they don't know what they're doing cuz prophets are always rejected and he's there he wasn't there to judge he was there to forgive he was there with Mercy amen he says but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come you start speaking against things of God you're on very very very dangerous ground amen sometimes that's why we need to shut up when we're speaking with people and if there is a resistance to what we're speaking what do we do Church stop do not push because what happens is in their ignorance or anger or whatever it might be defensiveness they may speak out against that and God would have to judge them if you ever feel them pushing back stop just stop and say that's okay brother that's okay sister let's just leave it there for now cuz you don't want to judge them the bride is under a mercy anointing not a judge judgement anointing the Judgment comes later the bride is always under grace and mercy there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat there's still Blood on the Judgment seat that makes it a mercy seat amen so that's our anointing it's not to judge it's not to destroy it's not to do all these things rather it's to draw people unto him amen but Jesus says this because he's he's saying you guys you're not making sense he says either either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit he says guys make up your mind you say Nicodemus come says we know you're of God cuz only a uh God man can only do this if God's with them and he says you guys I know what you're saying in the back rooms you're saying God is with them but then you come out and you say but God wasn't with them here and God wasn't with them here he says make up your minds either make me good or make me bad but I can't be good and bad simultaneously you don't get two kinds of fruit out of one tree that that's not the way it works amen he says I can't be of God and I can't be of Satan at the same time it's got to be one or the other it can't work that way he says oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things now he's putting it back on them he's saying now you think you're so good but you're a snake so how can what comes out of your mouth actually be good if you're a snake nothing good comes out of snakes he says for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh he says you're talking like this but you're going to find in the end that what comes out of your what comes out of your mouth is what's in your heart and what was it it was condemnation it was judgment for Christ it was denial of who and what he was and that's when their true hearts showed through in that they're calling him they're saying you're not of God he's saying see that's what's in your heart is that you can't recognize it when you see it he says a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth things now he's talking this in a similar way in Luke 6 and I just want to get to the end of this because he goes through all of this but I want you to see something he says for a good tree bringeth forth not forth corrupt fruit neither do a corrupt fruit bring forth good fruit what is it that makes fruit good what's on the inside of the tree that's it it's already determined before the fruit comes out whether it's going to be good or bad you can't spray a thorn with some sort of special concoction and turn it into an apple tree doesn't work that way you can't move on the outside to change what's on the inside in other words right you can't let me put it in in the words we've been using you can't put the spirit of the Lord upon a thorn and turn it into an apple tree it's still a thorn he says for every tree is known by one thing his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes you never go to thorns and say where are the grapes it's a it's it's brambles it's Thorns he says a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh and then he says these words and why call ye me Lord and do not the things which I say here we get to the Crux of the matter and Jesus says you acknowledge aspects of my Ministry you see the power of God you see the signs and wonders you see the feeding of the 5,000 you see the feeding of the 4,000 you see the raising of the Dead all these things you recognize it you see all the creative works that are going on some of you have seen me walk on water all these different things he says and then you call me Lord and then you don't do what I'm telling you you recognize the works that I do but when the word comes behind you've got no place for it and you won't do what I say and that's the problem that God has even today and it's always been the problem is that people will say all sorts of wonderful things about God about Jesus about their savior about Calvary and then when it comes time to put the word into action they say no thanks not interested I have enough and that's just the way they go amen they will accept him as Savior but they won't accept him as Lord they won't do what the word says they'll live by their feelings they'll live by their Church's interpretation they'll put a filter on the word through through the the social and normal practices of today and they won't go back to the word itself and Jesus speaks of them and and he he points them back to this he says wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips to honor me they talk a good talk he says but they have remove their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of man in other words they fear God because they've been taught to fear not not godly respect they've been taught to fear and what are they trying to do they're trying to save their soul from Hellfire but there's nothing in them that actually wants to serve God all they want to do is save themselves but there's no desire to serve or obey God Amen they obey be because they feel that they have to not because they want to and it's a spirit of fear not the spirit of Liberty which is the holy spirit amen and you'll find that a spirit of fear never holds you because a spirit of fear takes you to self-preservation every single time and self-preservation remember what Jesus said if a man save his soul he'll lose it you give up your life you'll gain it you you lose it that's when you'll keep it and when we try and self-preserving in situations or circumstances in life you know what happens we take a step back because God's not in it amen we always default back to self-preservation and that's what God dealt with God dealt with this for thousands and thousands of years with Israel that they would talk a good talk they would come to church they would do the sacrifices they would show up for the high Feast they would do all of these things but then they'd go home and they'd live a completely separate life that had nothing to do with with God and they were relying on the blood to keep them in good standing and the problem is is when you do wrong that the strength of the law is Judgment right when you do wrong God has to put them into a cycle of judgment because he has to fulfill his law otherwise it's no law if there's no repercussions if there's no consequences and so God couldn't change that and so they're in this cycle of judgment Mercy judgment Mercy judgment's Mercy around and around the same old mountain time and time again in their lives never getting to move forward amen but in Ezekiel 36 as we read what's he trying to do take them out of the spirit of fear and now bring them into the spirit of Liberty and he says I'm going to do it in a way that you can't even stop it your own Hang-Ups your own problems your own issues your own intellect your own raising your family your DNA your family traits and traditions whatever it is he says none of that will stop me when I get in your heart when I put my spirit within you that's going to be the Difference Maker Luke 4 says this Jesus this is at the very start of his ministry it says Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him through all the region about him now notice Jesus receives the Holy Spirit at Jordan at that point he was the son of God he was all human but he was not yet the fullness because it takes God in him to make him the fullness amen so up to that point he was just as Adam or Eve were he was just as you and I were except sinless he was all flesh all human it was all there but as soon as the spirit dropped on him he became fullness because God was in him the fullness of the godhead bodily in script in a man God dwelt in flesh God robed in flesh God hidden in flesh amen and so after Jordan This is now God in human flesh that's it you're looking for God he was walking down the road down the road with a pair of sandals and and a Rob on and long hair not very attractive probably short nothing about him that would draw you to Him scripture says there's no cless to him there's no handsomeness there wasn't you know this rugged nature no no no he was a nobody and it was God in flesh the anointed one Christ amen but that's a key thing to realize because if you can see who he is you'll see who you are cuz it's the same process and it's the same spirit that has to be in you and I and if that's what it does to him then what does it do to us if that was God in flesh then what does it do when we get the Same Spirit it may not be the fullness but it's no less God in flesh amen it says and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor so he has an indwelling but there is an anointing on him to do if I could put it that way he's got it on the inside but there is now a something that is driving him to do something God doesn't give us his spirit so we can sit on couches he gives it to do it's supposed to put us into action when we're finally changed he's wanting to put us into action he's wanting to put us into the work for the kingdom he says the the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor oh preaching wonderful no no no and he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted that's to deal with emotions that's to deal with pain and suffering that's to deal with with hurts that you've experienced in your life he says to preach Deliverance to the captives there are all sorts of things that bind us they can be mental they can be intellectual they can be Financial they can be religious they can be the the the health of our body they can be relational he says I'm here to free you from every single thing that holds you everything he says and recovering of sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised I look at that that them that are bruised that's people that have had a rough life he says I'm here to set you free what a beautiful thing I'm here to set you free from the effects of everything that's bound you to this point it says and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and I love he sat down that does me so good that he could sit down under the greatest anointing there ever was and preach a service like that and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this sorry let me go back I miss something I missed something I ver Miss verse 19 he says to set at Liberty them that are bruised and then he says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now you got to remember Isaiah had said this 7 written this 700 years ago the anointing the Holy Spirit comes upon Isaiah and 700 years ago he writes down the acceptable year of the Lord what's the acceptable year of the lord it's the time that God determines for this to happen so everything that's written in this word there's a time appointed there's an acceptable year there's a time when it has to happen and so he says I'm here to preach when that time is oh this is wonderful when is it going to be Jesus and then he sits down and at the end he says this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears in other words he says today is the acceptable day this is the acceptable year this is the acceptable time if you need healing this is the time if you need Deliverance this is the time if you need chains broken this is the time if you need to see here it is it's all available now now is the day for this to be fulfilled and he sitting down in a robe and sandals what an anointing and they try and kill him after this church you make too much of yourself Church we're going to have to do something that gets us to see we're more than what people think we are not out of Pride not out of Pride but because we're anointed in our souls to be and do something for the kingdom of God Amen Hallelujah all all we have to do find our place and stick with it that's it find your place in the word and stick with it and don't move and while that happens then is that anointing is there to say now is the acceptable time and you just stay there until it happens that's all you have to do amen Jesus says we're in the season of setting people free and they tried to kill them he could have completely set them Free Church and instead they said that's too much for us to take we know who you are we know who your family is we know where you come from we know the stories that surround you yeah no that's too much they went to kill him and what happened is he walked right through them because it wasn't his time to die amen he's talking about all these things and he says whatever binds you whatever's held you back I'm here to set you free from it man not just natural blindness but spiritual blindness anden the Liberty he wasn't offering was it wasn't just signs and wonders it wasn't just the big axe but it was when he would go to marry ma to to to Mary she had seven demons he set her free from things that had bound her that way yes he goes and he heals the blind and he raises the dead but you notice church that for 99% of those people it never changed their life yeah it changed how easily they walked through it but it never converted them thousands upon thousands were there for the breaking of the fish and the Loaves and the multiplication of it and we don't see him on the day of Pentecost do we 10 lepers are healed miraculously one comes back he goes over to the gines and heals a demoniac and they say can you please leave you're causing too many issues you caused this financial room but a man got saved and he went and he spread the gospel all throughout his area the signs and wonders never convert people they never save people they never hold People Israel had the supernatural every day in the wilderness for 40 years and two came out of that original group it doesn't save us amen they are there for the benefits but they could not receive his word we know that in all of it God has an elect group but it's always a little group it's always a tiny group even in his own disciples we preached on this last service or two he had the 82 he had the 12 that he chose and then he had the 70 that came to him and yes they healed the sick and raised the dead and cast out demons and preached effectively and all these things but when it came to The Showdown what did they turn down see they love Christ the Healer Christ the provider Christ the powerful but when Christ the word came their way what happened not interested and what they didn't realize is that the power was in Christ the word they turned down the very thing and what happened Church they lost their Ministries they had to go back to what they had left because that's all that was left for them they're a Jew if you didn't accept Christ then you had to go back to what Judaism they went back to dead sacrifices they went back to a temple where the shik of Glory left nothing they had nothing and they lost it all because not because they turned down the signs and wonders because they turned down Christ the word God's grace that we realize the word's what matters more than anything amen but Jesus comes down at the very end of his ministry and he's preached these hard services and and then he comes up to the last supper and it's like we're at today he's at the communion and the foot washing and he's sharing about what's going to happen to him and he says I'm going to have to go away and they're going to kill me and and by the way Peter you're going to fall and oh everybody else you're going to leave me too and and and they're kind of in a depression we're going to lose him we're not going to do so well and then he comes to John 14 John 13 he's giving them all the bad news but we come out to John 14 and and this is where we sort of started this this morning and Jesus says let not your heart be troubled Peter saying Jesus you told me I'm going to fail he says don't worry about it Jesus we're going to go through hard times you're going to die you're going to be crucified they're going to beat you to a pulp and Jesus says don't be worried about it Church we're in rough times we're at the worst of times we're at a time time where Satan is in the synagogue of God being worshiped as God there is no light in the natural Church Christ is outside the church knocking on the door we're at the worst of times in the previous six ages he could still deal with them in the seventh age he is completely out we're in the worst it will ever get and the only thing coming after this is Judgment because this is the worst it can get and what's he saying Shalom fear not have peace there's difficult times coming but I've made a way through he says ye believe in God believe also in me he says in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself he's not going to do all that work and then not have somebody there to take it he says that where I am there ye may be also he's saying the whole purpose of this is Redemption is to restore you back to where you were and this is him speaking now of the second coming of Christ of for his bride it's the resurrection it's the Rapture of the elect of God he says now whether I go where I go you know and the way you know he says you know where I'm going and you know how to get there and all the Deep spiritual men at the table said amen Jesus except for Thomas Thomas said Lord we know where you're we don't know where you're going and we don't know the way I like Thomas for his honesty he was honest about his doubt and he was honest about what he didn't know he says Jesus what are you talking about we don't have a clue where you're going and we definitely don't have a clue how to get there and Jesus said unto him I personal pronoun I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so there's the way he does not say the father is the way he does not say the holy spirit is the life he says I am it's all in Christ Church it's all in Christ there is no third person of the Trinity there is no first person of the Trinity he says it's all through me everything that's happening it's through me the whole walk the path the doorway it's all Christ it's Christ from start to finish he says if you had known me you should have known my father also you words he says if you truly know who I am you'll know who the father is he says and from henceforth you know him and have seen him he says from now on I'm showing you who he is and you'll know it and you'll continue to know it he says if you really realize who I am then you'd realize it but now I'm about to show you who it is and now Philip has maybe caught some courage from Thomas and he says Lord show us the father and it suffice sufficeth th in other words he's saying if you just show us the father that'll be enough for us that's all we need to see you don't have to show us who you are just show us the father father and not watch now what Jesus says he says and Jesus saith unto him have I personal pronoun been so long time with you and yet thou Hast not known me Phillip he says he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show me the father he says Philip if you've seen me you've seen God the father so why are you saying show us the father now we're not preaching on godhead this morning but you really cannot touch on it a little bit and Jesus says when you see me you're seeing the father and you can take that back to Colossians 1:15 where it says that he is the image of the invisible God but then we can go back to Isaiah let's take the wings of Old Testament and New Testament where it says that Jesus is the Mighty God and the Everlasting father you've got a son who's the father now how do you explain that through the Trinity you can't do it that's a real tough scripture but Christ is God made flesh it's God made visible it's God in a body it's God indwelling human flesh that's who he is he says believest not thou that I'm the father that I am in the father and the father in me he says the words that I speak unto you I don't speak them of myself but the father that dwells in me he doeth the works that's a really tough one for a trinitarian when you say let's do it like a glove okay Christ is the glove or Christ is the the hand and God is the glove he says I'm in the father and then he says but now the father's in me well how do you put a glove inside a hand you can only have one inside the other if they're two separate things that's the only way it works but now he says I'm in the father and the father's in me so now you have a hand and a glove and a hand how does that work doesn't work physically it doesn't work logically it doesn't work amen you've got these two separations of things and it doesn't work and Jesus is saying listen it's not me thinking and it's not me speaking it's the father that's in me amen and we see now that Christ is the perfect expression of the indwelling God he is the exact picture that we need to understand godhead it's right there in front of them amen and that's where the inspiration for this service comes this morning it's God indwelling human flesh he says believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake he's saying if you can't wrap your head around how this works then just believe my works because I can't be doing those works and be lying to you about who and what I am so just take it really what he's saying is if you can't grasp it lay it on the shelf and just keep believing and in due time you'll understand but he doesn't stop there oh I love this he says believe me and if you believe me what happens is verse 12 he says verily verily I say unto you in other words he's saying I'm not lying this is really true he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also whoa wow what Jesus did you're going to do Phillip he says not only that and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father now that word greater doesn't mean you're going to do more than he did in terms of the the might or the Majesty or the power it means you're going to do more by number why because there's 12 of them well really 11 and there's one of him and they're going to go in all the world they're not going to be limited by three and a half years of ministry some of them are going to live for decades some of them aren't but he says you're going to do more because there's a bunch of you now with the same thing inside of me see we talk about people that say well I believe on Jesus here's the scripture we ought to point them back to if you believe on him then you'll do the works that he does you'll live the life that he lives you'll have the words that he has and you'll have the inspiration for what you do and speak the same that he did that's those that believe on him is that they have the Life of Christ that's the proof amen so let's take the whole scripture rather than the cherry-picking one that says if you believe on him you'll be saved if you believe on him it'll have an effect he says and what whatever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son what about that one you believe on Jesus Christ then when you speak nothing happens when you pray nothing happens there's a problem why because you don't have the mind of Christ yet you don't have the holy spirit inside why because if we believe on Christ then we believe the word that he is and brings then we speak by his will by the word and God backs it up and he says and if you shall ask ask anything in my name I will do it Hallelujah now John would come later in 1 John 5:14 and say if we ask anything according to his will oh see we got to take the whole scripture again otherwise we' run around and I'd be speaking brand new cars and no problems with Newland power and and filling the pews with Holy Ghost filled people right I'd be speaking Roma into Newan land I'd be speaking my my sister back into the message but that's not the way it works we've got to have the mind of Christ and speak according to that not according to my will and that's what Jesus said I don't do this by my will I do it by his will amen but he says if you ask it in his name how do you ask it in his name Church you ask it because he's in you you have his name by marriage my wife can ask anything in my name and get it as long as the bank account's there for it she's got a right to it she's missing Jonathan klette she can't go into the bank and they say I'm sorry Blanca neis no they say h Mrs Jonathan klet you have full access you can take it can't stop her that's the same thing for us we're United by marriage really we're in the same Unity that Christ has that's really what we're getting to this morning and then he says now if you love me keep my Commandments oh I love Jesus what are you doing how you living remember what Jesus said he talks about the parable of the two sons and the father says hey go work in the fields one guy says no I'm not going to do it but then he went and does it and then the other one says sure Dad I'll do it and then he doesn't go do the work and Jesus said which one really love the Father the one that initially said no and then did it or the one that said I'll do it and then didn't do it and they all said the one that did it yeah but he was disrespectful he was rude doesn't matter he did it he loved his father he respected his father and he ended up doing what he was supposed to to do same thing with us we can't say we love God and then disobey his word he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever now listen Jesus is their comforter right there he's the one saying let not your heart be troubled he's their current comforter he's trying to set their hearts at ease he's trying to show them and he's saying don't be troubled I know hard times are coming and all these things now he says now he's going to send you another comforter oh now we've got a second person of the godhead here there's somebody else coming besides me who is it he says it's the spirit of Truth a comforter and the spirit of Truth you know what there's a real freedom in truth scripture says the truth will set you free because it cuts through the fog it cuts through the Mist it cuts through the the Wonder and the worry and it lets you st oh it lets you walk on a sure Foundation it lets you see that your feet are safe where you're going amen amen your truth the truth will anchor your soul it'll set your mind at ease it'll give you freedom and peace in a time when all around you is falling apart because you know that the truth cannot fail amen he says the comforter you'll know him because he brings you truth see we want the the fuzzy the the hugs the warmth he says the truth is what will make you feel good it'll set you free he says whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him catch that Jesus is saying the comforter is here right now the spirit of Truth is here right now but the world can't have him the world can't receive him because they can't even see him they can't recognize him they don't know who he is so in other words the one that's coming is already there in their midst right there amen and he confirms it he says but ye know him for he dwelleth with you in other words he's right here in the room now is what he's saying he says you see him you know him and he's with you who is it it's Christ himself amen but now he says and he shall be where in you not upon you that's already happened he says now he's going to be in you they've all had this ministry they've had this comforter they've had this Spirit of Truth all the time and who is it it's Jesus Christ and then he says he he he leaves no doubt church he does not say he will come to you he says I will come to you who's the spirit of Truth Jesus Christ who's the comforter Jesus Christ he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you personal pronoun not a third person of the Trinity it is Jesus Christ himself amen there's a spirit of Truth coming there's a comforter coming it's the same thing it's the same person Jesus says it's not something different why he says you're going to recognize it when it comes because you'll see it's just like me it's not just like me it is me that's how you'll recognize it now some people would look at that scripture and say well yeah he's pointing to the long future where he comes back in a second coming and there's a resurrection and a Rapture but Jesus doesn't put it that way he puts in verse 19 he says yet a little while and another words shortly cuz why within 24 hours he's dead yes he's going to rise again but after that they've only got the 40 days or 37 days and then he's gone again he says let a yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me now he says because I live ye shall live also in other words How I Live is how you're going to live the reason I can live is the reason you're going to live the way I can do this is the way you're going to do that there's no difference listen to this quote we're almost done I'm going a little longer than I expected this morning but that's it's okay it says and then God became material in a man called Jesus Christ which was his son became material now watch Hallelujah this son gave his life that he might bring what other sons that God might become tangible working all in all when you you receive the Holy Ghost Church it is God being tangible to this Fallen word listen God's tangible Hallelujah God's tangible God's tangible sister brother Dale God's tangible this morning it is not some foreign entity something that's so spiritual and high above us that we cannot reach it but God comes down and he comes to a little girl he comes to a little girl and people can shake her hand and they're shaking the hand of Jesus Christ no difference no difference except it's a portion instead of the fullness but then when we get us all in a group here what happens it's more of the fullness it's a greater part of the fullness coming together and people can come into our presence and it's not me it's Christ that's living in me and they can lay hold of eternal life by the life that we live in the witness that we give through our day-to-day words and actions that's where we're at this morning the tangible God now not in three in hundreds in thousands maybe in millions only he knows the tangible God we're speaking on the indwelling god this morning don't look out there church Church look in the mirror look in the mirror of the word and then say God let me see it in the mirror of my bathroom in the mirror of the door when I check myself to go out into public Lord let them see the Christ in me that that's the hope of glory amen and he says this because he said it yet a little while what is it he's pointing to a little while in the future he says and at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me oh he's adding and I in you what is it on the day of Pentecost he says there's going to be a little time and then in a single day in a single moment you're going to have a realization of what I was talking about here what is it their theology will become reality that's really what it is you'll have the experience of what the godhead is you'll have an experience of what it means to be one for whatever reason in the last couple weeks I've had a lot of discussions with people and on the Trinity and these different things and people sending over things and whatnot and I want to stop here because there's a there's so much more to unpack here but Jesus is throwing a wrench in the godhead because we look at this and he's saying he's not just putting three in the godhead now if you see this if we're going to read it the way it says it he's not just putting three cuz he starts out and he says I and my father are one so there's a Oneness so a a a equals B okay then he says now myself and the Holy Spirit the comforter are one so now a equals b and b equals c okay we remember our math so then he's got two Oneness there so at most you got two people right but if a equals b and b equals c then a equals c so now you've got the three of them are the same so now you have a Oneness amen of Christ in the father Christ in the spirit and them in him and then he comes and he gives us John 14:20 and he says by the way you're in this as well so it's no longer a trinity if it's just brother Mark we've got a quaternity if nothing else but here's the thing on the day of Pentecost they added 120 to this so you've got three plus 120 and then 3,000 are added that day and then he goes to the house of Cornelius and then he goes to Samaria and every single one of them get the exact same revelation of Christ in their life so if you do all the math you got 3,500 people now added into the Oneness of the godhead I'm not preaching heresy I'm saying if you believe that it's three individuals now you've got more than 3,000 you doesn't work that way you've got to understand Oneness a different way and the thing is you got to be able to see what it is for real because if you can't see that you won't see you you can't do it cuz the new birth reveals the exact same thing that Christ was in your personal life that's where we're sitting this morning two quotes and we'll close I promise see when he came descending from Heaven not another three people way up yonder talking but they saw the spirit of God like a dove that's who the spirit was not the third person talking it's not three Gods he says there's three offices of the same God God the father and the pillar of fire god the son in human flesh he says God the Holy Ghost in you the same god wow he said Jesus said that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you and you and me God trying to get back of fellowship with his create with his creature that he created in the Garden of Eden that's how he's going to do it not by might not by power but by my spirit it's how God does it he says I'm talking about the identification of the token Jesus Christ raised and where in us now identifying who himself to revindicate his promised word of this day amen he says then you and Christ are one God and Christ are one that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father in me I in you and you and me he says there is God made manifest in human flesh showing himself alive after 2,000 years he says that's the token amen God bless you let's Stand Together the musicians could come the deacons will start to prepare for the communion and the foot washing my I love church I love this when you can see it's not just something outside of you it's something in you amen that you're a part of it you're not external to it you always were a part of it like Jesus said I come from God I go to God we come from God and we go back to God and we have that same origin we have that same source and we're going back and we're being restored to that amen what is it it's just God revealing it's just God revealing himself over and over and over again God revealed himself through Moses god revealed himself through through Samuel through David he even revealed himself through Samson he revealed himself through prophets he revealed himself through Mary John the Baptist he Paul the apostles all these different ones it was Christ it was God revealing himself through anointed Sons and Daughters of God Christ was just the first of many Brethren he says and there's a bunch more coming behind it that are going to produce the same life amen you know I was thinking on this that God is the only thing the only one that can divide himself and not be diminished when God divided himself remember what we know it says God pour all that God was he poured himself into Christ and then what all that Christ was he poured himself into the church but his power is not diminished God does not become less of a God because brother Paul has a portion of him or brother Bob has a portion of him or sister Justine has a portion of him he's still God he stands outside of space he's outside of time he's outside of matter he is not bound by the laws that we look at he's God he's everywhere he's everything and so when he gives himself to somebody he is in no way diminished and yet he's missing a part of himself it's a paradox that he he's missing something and yet he hasn't lost anything and that's what we're going through is in these things amen it's the Simplicity of God being revealed in you and I in humility it's an indwelling God in flesh All Over Again by the Holy Spirit that's where we're sitting that's where we're sitting this morning and this is a spirit that's going to take us into character it's going to take us all the way into a resurrection and a rapture you've got eternal life dwelling in you the very life of God inside of you this morning if you've got the Holy Ghost what a wonderful place we are and it's all because of what he did that day at Calvary and so when we come here this SE this morning to to eat the bread a and to drink the wine what are we saying we're saying thank you we recognize the price that he paid the horrible disfiguration the pain The Suffering The Agony that he went through so that you and I could stand in and sit here this morning and say I'm a child of God and he has confirmed it in my life by the indwelling presence of his own spirit amen hallelujah amen God bless you this morning let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how wonderful your word is Lord how wonderful you are Lord that you came down and you dwelt in flesh Lord and you went to a whipping post and you got beaten and Thorns pushed into your head and Lord you got Nails driven into your arms and your feet Lord and your side was pierced and you you stayed on a cross Lord naked of your own free will and died and gave your life and spirit back and your blood to cover us Lord and your word to wash us so that we could stand here this morning as free children of God Heavenly Father Lord let us not take it for granted this
