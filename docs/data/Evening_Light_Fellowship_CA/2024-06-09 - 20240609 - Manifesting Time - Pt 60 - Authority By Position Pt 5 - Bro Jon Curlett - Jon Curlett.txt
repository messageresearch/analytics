encourage Us in the word Lord strengthen us for war we pray Lord work in our lives we ask Lord we're inviting you this morning Lord to have full control full prence or full Authority in our personal lives each one Lord and we'll ask it in Jesus name giving you the glory amen and amen God bless you this morning turn if you would to Psalm 84 me Psalm 8 84 it's good to be here certainly enjoying the warmer weather and the sunshine this weekend and maybe maybe spring is here amen God bless you certainly enjoyed the song service this morning brother Josh it was wonderful amen the song service doesn't have to line up with the with what's preached it did this morning but it doesn't have to but it's to prepare your heart for the hearing of the word amen it's to open up the people put them in a state of worship and to invite the presence of God here amen but I certainly appreciate appreciate it when it lines up with what we'll speak on in the service amen God bless you each one Psalms 84 and 11 says this for the Lord God is a son and shield the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly let's read the 12th verse as well oh lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing our usual series and our our title we've had on Authority by position and we're going to take a big leap forward this morning we're going to go to the story of Esther and I want to look at the approach that we take and the attitude that we have when it comes to our relationship with God and we're talking about adoption we're talking about being placed into a position of authority but we have to see that our Authority always comes through him amen we do not stand alone in our Authority it's not something that we just get to choose and do in these different things but for the sake of time we're not going to read all the scriptures we are are going to start in Esther chapter 1 and you can turn there if you want to and keep your Bibles and Esther we be reading a lot of scriptures this morning but I don't want to go through everything but I I want you to see how Esther starts because we know that Esther becomes the queen of the land but I want you to see how she starts because how we start usually determines how we finish up amen if we start on the right uh line if we start in the right direction if we start the right way then it all works out but if we start just a little bit off then what happens is we're left picking up the pieces and we wonder what went wrong and so we'll see with Esther that she comes in and and the way she starts is the perfect way and it's a type of the Bride that we're looking at this morning so Esther 1 and verse 10 says this on the seventh day when the heart of the King was merry with wine he commanded these seven men the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of H hasar the king to bring vashy the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on the king is wanting to show her off she's the most beautiful woman in the land according to him and so he wants to show her off but watch her response now verse 12 it says but the queen vashi refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very RW and his anger burned in him now carnally we can't blame vashi what what woman in her right mind will want to go prance around a room and show off her beauty to a bunch of drunks you know carnally speaking we can identify with vashi but vashi forgot her position right or wrong she forgot her position and so if we jump down to verse 15 then then then what happens is is the king says what can we do now she has disobeyed me she's made me a fool in front of the people so what am I allowed to do he says what shall we do Under the queen vashi according to law he says because she had not performed the Commandment of the king a haar by the Chamberlain noticing the king is asking what do I have a right to do he's saying what in my law allows me to do something about this he's not wanting to just make up something but he's saying according to the laws that everyone has to live by what options do I have with this amen he's asking as wise men what are the decrees of the Kingdom what is it that I'm allowed to do according to what I make the rest of you do amen and we see there's a type of Christ here no type in the scripture is perfect but we see there's a type of Christ here because he's saying what does the word allow me to do to an Unfaithful wife and then they said in verse 19 if it please the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the mees that it be not altered that vashi come no more be before King ah hasar but let the King give her Royal Estate unto another that is better than she so what they're saying is you can have a decree of divorcement it's allowed by the law for you to put her away and she can't come before you anymore she's Dishonored you she's disobeyed you she's made a fool of you she has not come under your Authority and the law says you can divorce her and we know that the followup is that the king does and he divorces vashy he puts her away and he moves on with life but of course being a king and being a man he gets lonely and eventually he says this isn't it's not good for a man to dwell alone I don't like being alone and so he says what can we do about this situation okay the law says I can divorce her but what does the law say I can do now and so it says in Esther 2 and 1 it says now after these thingss that the wrath of king of haaris was appeased he remembered Vash and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king's servants and ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers and all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of heg the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given in be given unto them so he said listen we'll find you another wife and we're going to go throughout the land and we're going to find the fairest of the fair and let them come in but notice what it says here let their things for purification be given them you couldn't just come in the presence of the king the way you were you were not acceptable the way you are you had to go through a process of purification and it was his process it was his process that would make you acceptable in the king's presence it says and let the maiden which pleases the king be Queen instead of vashi and the thing pleas the king and he did so now in shusa and the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mori the son of jir the son of shim the son of Kish a benjamite who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity which had been carried away with jonia king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom morai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so they came out in the Captivity and she's not even his daughter she's a distant relative to him says so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shusa and the palace to the custody of heg that dester was brought also into the King's house to the custody of hegi Keeper of the women now catch this every single of pretty lady in the Kingdom has been brought in but it says here that the maiden pleased him and she obtained one thing kindness she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification and such things as belong to her and seven maidens which were meat to be given her out of the King's house and he preferred her and her Maids unto the best place of the House of the women so notice the character of Esther here yes she's a pretty face but there's something something about Esther that gives her grace in the eyes of those that she meets up with there's a character element here that he has not seen among any of the other beautiful women and what does it do it brings her to a place of kindness she gets something that maybe the others don't get and he puts her to the front of the queue he says I'll get you purified first you're the one that I think the king's going to want and so he prefers her above all the others it says Now esther had not showed her people nor her kindred for Mori had charged her that she should not show it so she hasn't told anyone she's a Jew she's just another pretty face says now in verse 12 now when every maid's term was come to go into king of haar after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to it six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women so there's a type here of sanctification of the believer but remember you see here there's two times there's a time to take everything out and then there's a time to put things back in and what he takes out he has to replace with something good so what they do is they put them in this mix and what it would do is it would draw out all the impurities from their skin so it would take care of the acne it would take care of the blemishes and the rashes and these different things and it would take out all the things that were impure but then what happens after that is they get put into perfume and that perfume would soak into that woman because the thing is this amen she's got to be acceptable in the eyes of the king now not to get too carnal but he doesn't want a hairy stinky sweaty woman that's not what he wants he wants a woman that is perfect and so the purification process is to perfect the person that's going through it to bring them into the presence of the king amen it wasn't enough to be clean she had to embody cleanliness she had to embody pureness she had to embody holy she had to be it and so she didn't just smell like perfume when she came in she was perfume she didn't have to wear perfume she had been so saturated in this that she naturally smelled wonderful that's what would bring you into the presence of the king what she had to be the real deal she couldn't just put something on she couldn't just prop things up and make herself look good but she had to literally be pure and beautiful you know what scripture says in second Corinthians 5:21 it says we are made the righteousness of God we don't just put this on yes it calls us we say we have the white robe of righteousness but we are literally the embodiment of his righteousness we're the EMB embodiment of the purity of the Holiness of Christ that's what she's going through and that's what brings her into the presence of the king it says then then thus came every Maiden unto the king and whatsoever she desired was given to her to go out of her out of the house of the woman under the King's house and in the evening she went and on the tomorrow she returned unto the second house of the women to the custody of shash Gaz the king's Chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name he didn't just have to remember the event he had to remember who you were cuz otherwise it was just a nameless set of faces a nameless set of bodies that the King was going through they'd all get one night with the King and they have one night to make an impression and then either he fell in love with you or he didn't fall in love with you and then they would be sent to the second house but catch this it says now when the turn of Esther the daughter of of abah the uncle of morai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what heate the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all that them that looked on her remember when Esther first came in she obtained kindness but now she says it's my time to go into the house of the king it's my time for one night with the king and you know what she doesn't do she doesn't say well I want blue cuz blue makes my eyes pop and I want gold clips and I want a little mini Tiara to make him think that I'm already a queen no she says what does the queen what does the king love what does he like to look at what kind of clothes does he appreciate what are his inclinations what is it that will make me have favor in the king's eyes and as soon as she does that she gains favor in everybody's eyes cuz Hester's going in differently than anyone else she's not going in with an idea of how she's going to seduce this King she's saying what makes the king tick what does he like all go in the way he likes I may not like the way it is but as long as he likes it that's what matters that's what matters amen it says so Esther was taken under king of hasar into his house in the 10th mon month which is the month tth in the seventh year of his Reign and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained two things grace and favor grace and favor remember this for later she obtained grace and favor in a site more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of ashy now the prophet of God says this he says like Esther when Esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't Adorn her herself with all the things but she adorned herself with a sweet Meek Spirit he says that's what the bride is adorning herself with with all the fruits of the spirit's following in other words it's not just an act it's not just a put on now I don't want to get too carnal this morning but you'll find today with women everything is fake everything is fake they've got so much makeup on you don't know what they actually look like they got everything pushed and prodded and pulled and supported and all these things you don't know what their body actually looks like their hair is half of it is fake the color is wrong they've got things Blended in there is nothing real about most of the women today they're trying to hide who they are brother R I'm saying when we're talking about the bride of Christ she comes in with one thing and that's a Meek humble a Meek sweet Spirit there's no put on with that and then the rest is what it is amen he says what does she have she is assembling together in The Fellowship of the word and what does that look like he says it's Amen uh fellowshipping setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus tonight one Accord one place one Spirit one mind one hope one God one purpose seven things what is it it's getting in line with God's word and plan she's dressed to please everything is about his plan his purpose amen see there you are every time the Bible says anything we say Amen punctuating every word with amen he says let them Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit not only the women but the men too Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit he says then you're becoming ready for the bride sweet reverent and then he says Esther made her heart clean she's walking in completely different from those women we see no indication from Esther that she wants to become the queen we don't see her playing any political games we don't see any one-upmanship we don't see her stabbing other women in the back to get them out of her way we don't see her scheming she's merely acting according to her nature which is I'm going to do what pleases the king and if he likes me he likes me and if he doesn't he doesn't but I'm going in according to what he wants her objective was not selfish her objective was to please the king brother Braham says this Esther purged her heart before God walked up with a Meek and humble Spirit he says it's the church that's going to be the bride of Christ now remember Esther refused the worldly adornment remember the scripture says the bride has made herself ready and what is she wearing she's wearing the robe that he gave her she's wearing what the white robe which is the righteousness of saints which is the righteousness of God she's going in with his Merit and his favor not with her own amen she's wearing the Garment he provided not the one she thinks looks best she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king it's a sweet kind reverent Spirit reverent Spirit to the word of God she's Washed by the Water of the word and the word in you it's washing the church needs a washing a Full Gospel washing that's right not just a part washing but a Full Gospel washing cleaned up and made new creatures in Christ Jesus he says Jesus brought is not a dirty bride he wouldn't have his bride dirty amen what is the reason why we would be dirty because we choose what we wear we choose how we look we choose how we act that's what makes us unacceptable we've got to go in his provided way and we're seeing the right approach here with Esther and it's approach that she maintains even after she is Queen and she always comes in with the right attitude and the attitude is what would please the king amen sure she has issues sure she has needs even as a Queen she's got issues even as the bride of Christ we have issues amen we've got needs we've got concerns we've got life and death situations sometimes but no matter what is on Esther's heart she always comes in to give the king worship and to make him feel good she's always putting him ahead of her and what brings Esther into Authority is the right approach and the right attitude that is a thing that takes her into the presence of the king and keeps her in the presence of King is her attitude and her approach now now we know the rest of this story and again I'm not going to read a ton of those scriptures this morning but we know that the king had an adviser named uh hmon and he's a a wicked man he's a schemy man he's all about himself and he's power hungry and we see that he he gets the king to make him the prince of princes anden that's we see a type here of Lucifer who's always you know he was the head of the Angels but he fell because he talked he he focused on himself and he says I will rise up and I will and I will and I will and hmon we see he fools the king and he's declared worthy of honor and when he's walking or riding through the streets everyone is supposed to bow down before him and that's the law of the king is that they're supposed to give Mori or or they're supposed to give hmon this this honor but we see that morai refuses to bow down and so hmon gets mad and he goes to the king and he says there's a certain people we're seeing today there's certain people amen you're labeled a certain way and they believe this and they believe that and they don't do this and they don't do that and they're not good for society and they're holding back the uni you know the unity of the churches and that there's always somebody that calls us certain people and he goes to the king and he spins a lie and what does he do he says King there's a bunch of law Breakers in the country he says and I'll pay you 10,000 gold pieces if you'll let me take care of them just give me your give me your word give me your Authority and I'll go take care of them now here's the thing according to the law hmon had a right to say that according to the law Satan has a right to accuse us amen we did wrong by the law Mori had broken the law he had refused to Bow before hmon that was the law but notice now that what Hon's trying to do is destroy an entire People based on the actions of one person can you see the type and he's coming in he's saying they've broken the law and therefore they have to be destroyed and the King rubber stamps it and he says sure go ahead and do it but I want you to see something that Paul talks about and we're only going to read the first half of this verse we'll read the second half later he says moreover the law entered that the offense might abound and man we see that that what Hon's doing is he's taking one issue and he's magnifying it over the entire people and what's he trying to do he's trying to bring us into Des disrepute before the king he's the accuser of the Brethren he's standing Before the Throne and he's saying look at what they did look at what they did look at what they did and by the law he's right that's why he has a right to stand there church that's why we still need a mediator today amen that's why we still need a mediator today but here's the thing the king doesn't know that Esther is a Jew he doesn't know that she's now put under the law because you know the law says Jews it doesn't just say a certain people it's going to Define who it is amen and so the king's trusting Hon's judgment and and he has no issue with what's going to happen and of course Mori and the rest of the Jews they're horrified their heartbroken they know that there's a day and there's a time where they're going to have to pay and that they're going to die and they're going to give their lives and the thing is this the law is the law and when you look in those times when the king gave a law he couldn't just come and strike it out the law was held by the king himself and he could not just do away with it the word is the word you can't do away with it you can't sidestep it and say I'm the bride it doesn't apply apply to me in and of itself the law applies to you the king could not take back his own law we saw the same thing with Daniel remember they said oh King nobody's allowed to pray to anybody but they have to pray to you and whoever doesn't do that whoever prays to another God they got to get thrown to the Lions and so the King was bound by his own law and he threw Daniel into the lion's den but we see there that there's another law Hallelujah there's another law but he's bound to this law amen but we see that their only hope is that they can go to Esther and est's access to the king will save them let me stop and say this church we're not where we are just for ourselves there's an entire nation there's an entire group of people that is trusting that Esther can get into the king's presence we're here to save others we're here to intercede for others we talked about this when we talked about priests and Kings remember when we're looking at adoption adoption is not about me adoption is about you it is not about selfishness it's about service and Esther has been put into a position to serve her people amen they may be co-workers it might be family may be lost Ones maybe loved ones whatever it is and they're outside of the blood of Christ they don't have access to him the way that we do but we can go and we can intercede on their behalf that's what we're here for in an adopted State amen Christ did it this was the embodiment of adoption was Christ walking on this Earth and everything he did was for our sake never did Christ do anything for his sake even when he clean his life he kept it clean he says I sanctify myself for their sakes the things that I don't do I do it for their sake because under him anything was lawful he could do anything he wanted he could have got married he could have had children he could have had all of these things could have went and just sat and become a carpenter lived an easy life but he says what I'm doing the way I'm living my life is for their sake not for myself amen that's what we're looking at amen and as long as that blood's on The Mercy Seat and it is as long as there's a mediator than were to stand in that place and where to go and intercede for others amen we're there they're the only ones that can do it watch what brother Bram says though he says he he's talking about coming before God he says now my motives right so therefore he said say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt and it's the will of God for me to do it or he'd have never sent me he says there you are you get everything working right and your motive and objective right you can say to anything and as long as it's the will of God it'll do it he says but I want to say to be some big stuff shirt to make me a great program somewhere put me on some telecast Universal or something now that's wrong amen adoption is not about me he says it's about something else it's about being in the will of God he says and Jesus lacked one thing he says you know what it was Showmanship he wasn't a showman wasn't trying to put on a big Affair wasn't trying to draw attention to himself wasn't a me monster that's Lucifer Lucifer is i i i i and me me me me me but what does he say no I'll go and I'll seek the will of God and when he tells me what he wants me to do then I'll go do it and then it's going to happen because he told me what to do but we think that looking at Esther and I know we know the story but I I want to dramatize this a little bit because you'd think that Esther would think nothing of a request to go talk to the king if somebody came to you know maybe they had an issue and only the pastor could solve it you know and they'd maybe say to my wife could you talk to Brother John about this my wife doesn't have to get psyched up to come talk to me about it she's my wife she can come into my presence anytime we don't treat it like that you know come into my presence no I'm her husband she can come talk to me anytime anywhere and no matter what I'm doing she's going to take the pre the Precedence she's my wife she's my first love amen but we see here that there's a problem with this plan and in Esther 4:10 it says this again Esther spoke unto hatch so there's this back and forth between Mori and Esther through this man hatch and gave him commandment to Mori and said all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live she says but I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days so there's a law that's block blocking the approach of the presence of the king at one time even the elect Church could not approach God he cast them out of his presence but there is a way made we know that but when you choose to approach him he has a law and he can say death or he can say life and it's completely on him it's completely on him amen we see so many types and shadows in the Book of Esther and we'd be 20 or 30 Services if we were preaching on it but I want to say one thing there was a law holding us back from the presence when we were kicked out of Eden we could not go into his presence and he had to choose to come down and when he came down that was his Sovereign Grace but we could not put ourselves into his presence he had to come down to us he had to lower himself to our place amen but what did he do he extended his Royal pardon by his Sovereign will and said I'll let you in I'll come to you it says now then Mori commanded to answer eser and says think not with thyself that thou shalt Escape in the King's house more than all of the Jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then there shall enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed he says and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this Mori says listen Esther the law is the law and whether you die today or tomorrow the next day you're going to die under this law because you're a Jew and as soon as they find out he's got to kill you but he says now you're going to die and when you die your whole family dies with you you're the last of of of your family he says but us we're going to get delivered he says we're the we're the we're the children of Abraham we're going to get delivered but you'll die because you didn't work on our behalf You' got something to do but catch what he says he says but maybe you ought to consider that you've gone through everything you've gone through for this moment I want to step back a bit this morning because when we look at Esther when we think about what she's gone through what a trial it's been she goes and she's taken by Nebuchadnezzar out of her home her parents are killed so she has early childhood trauma she's now put into a foster home with relatives distant relatives she's taken away from church she's taken away from Believers she's in a foreign land and then she's living there that seems to be okay but then she's removed even from that and she's placed a bunch among amongst a bunch of worldly women everyone's trying to become Queen everyone's political everyone's trying to get ahead and she's just some little simple believer and all she wants to do is go home and she's put in this place amen and she doesn't even want to be there in the first place she doesn't want to be in Babylon now she's in the King's house now she's going to be forced into intimacy with a man she doesn't know and love she's put through a year six months of painful process to clean her out and then she's put through six months to make her beautiful and while she might like the effect of what they've done because she's prettier than ever she's still living way outside of her comfort zone there's nothing enjoyable about this life that she's living in and of itself and then she's brought into a king and he can do with her whatever she he wants and she can't say no now he falls in love with her and I believe Esther falls in love with him because we see her character continue to come through this because no matter where she is she holds fast to how she's been raised she doesn't become worldly she doesn't become backstabbing and conniving she doesn't become manipulative she stays Meek and humble and quiet the whole way through nothing changes her but it hasn't been fun she's isolated she's alone she has nothing except the occasional message that Mori s her that's the only out uh you know contact she has with the outside world and so she's living in the midst of a a total worldly situation much like Daniel and the three Hebrew children and he's saying you've gone through this for this sometimes we're sitting there and I've been through things in my life and and seasons of life and I find they are seasons church if you're struggling this morning if it seems like nothing is happening like nothing is going to take place place that you've prayed and you've prayed and nothing's happening let me tell you it's only for a season it's only for a time but God has a purpose and I've been in seasons of life where I was sick where I was injured where I struggled for spiritual food in due season where I felt alone where I felt people didn't like me where I needed personal deliverance and no matter how much I prayed it seemed like nothing was happening and yet in it all God never left me God was always there through it all amen and what I found is in the end that he works all things for our good amen and so what he was he was doing there was he was bringing me to a place where he could use me more where he could clean me more purification is never easy Church some things are Dee rooted some things are genetic some things are familiar some things are church and God has to break that out because he wants a pure bride and sometimes he's got to lay us flat on our back physically financially emotionally maritally whatever it might be and he's got to take us and break us down and get all those things out so that he can build us into the beautiful holy bride that he's trying to get us to be I don't care where you're at this morning you can say nobody knows what I'm going through nobody's been through it church every single person that's a child of God is going through something at some given time why because we're all growing we're all maturing in Christ and that means there's a constant work that's going on in our life to draw out those things so don't look around and for Pete's sake don't look at me and say brother John doesn't have any issues I got issues every day I've got issues I've got attitude issues I've got time management issues I've got relational issues of course we do every single one of us deals with things cuz we're growing in Christ but anything I've gone through I've learned it's always for purpose God's got something at the end of it and sometimes the only thing is that I can tell somebody else I've been where you've been and he brought me through it he delivered me from that he can heal you from that he can give you what you're asking asking for sometimes people just need to know there's an answer at the end of that tunnel that the darkness will give way to light at some point sometimes we just need to be there to encourage the next one that's coming down the exact same path to say he's more than able amen he's got us in the palm of his hands amen he puts us through those things to help the ones that are coming behind us to support the ones that are around us amen and it's to give us Grace for those that are where we used to be oh my church some sometimes we get so caught up in our religious nature and we forget there goes I I used to be there or sometimes it's there go I but for the grace of God and that attitude's got to be kept in check and we get dried out when we get dried out we get religious that's the way it works listen to what the prophet of God says he's talking about remember he has that experience in the diner where there's uh uh you know there's there's a cop that's playing the slot machines and slot machines are illegal in the state so he definitely shouldn't be doing it and he's got that the cop is got his hands all over this woman and there's an old woman that's dressed like a prostitute and he says Lord why don't you just wipe it off the Earth and then he takes him back and he sits him down he shows him a vision and he shows him what he did and brother Brown would say this after all this he says it's your attitude towards things don't condemn others if they do wrong be good to them anyhow just look over those things well they ought to know better brother John doesn't matter you look over those things he says because God's had to look over a whole lot for you and I he says that's right God help us to have that attitude always in our hearts he says you pray for me that I'll never look upon people like that no more no matter what they're doing that'll always look up on them that they're creatures of God and that God sent his son to take their place that's the attitude we need to have day by day no matter how much that person ought to know better say Lord forgive them and help them to grow and help them to mature and help me to be there to do anything I can to help them along the way sometimes what we do is we separate we need to be there to support Amen to look past those things that what's that's what maturity looks like is it looks past those things as parents we look past the shortcomings of our children that we can help them grow amen that we can teach them that we can bring them along the right path of life so Esther sees mori's wisdom and she says yes this is what it's all been about out but watch what she says here she says then Esther B them return morai this answer go and gather together all the Jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my maidens will Fast likewise and so will I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish remember what I said even the elect couldn't approach God at one time God had to come to them but God made a provided way Hallelujah God made a bridge over the law that could bring us into his presence and it's a way of his choosing and if you come his way by his choosing that's where your Assurance is come his provided way says in Esther 51 it says now came to pass on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal House house over against the Gate of the house I want you to see something here lots of women could dress up to go before the king but only one could dress like a queen only one had the king's dress only one had the queen King's apparel only one had the crown that the king had given her everyone could act like a queen but there's only one that is the queen there's only one bride there's a bunch of denominations that are saying this is what I think he likes but there's only one bride that's got the wedding Gard garment on and the wedding garment is always his word it's always his word she's dressed in his word it's his righteousness amen she's the only one that that could say my clothes came from the king that's the only one that's the only one that could say it she's the only one that could have the crown given to her by the king she's the only one that has those things everyone might try and please the king but she's the only one that's been chosen by the king to please him amen there's only one bride and then there's a lot of Pretenders but she's dressed in his word and she's got his spirit in her heart and that's what makes her pleasing in his sight amen why because he's made us acceptable I didn't make myself acceptable this morning it's not me it's his doing it's his making it's his spirit it's his clothing it's his Meek and Gentle Spirit that's on me that makes me acceptable this morning brother says this he says the hour has come his bride has made herself ready she laid aside all of these things now he says remember Esther was chosen remember the law said only who the king chooses Esther was chosen and the others were rejected and only those that's born again that's got the spirit of God will be the chosen that day that the Crown of Glory will be set upon her head and the others will be rejected that's going to be a sad day you missed it and you didn't even know what happened knocking on the door finally find out the truth but you've missed your day of visitation that's a horrible day Esther comes in and now she's dressed in his robe she's got his crown on her head she's purified she's his chosen bride and watch what happens as she comes in now and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the King held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand and so Esther Drew near and touched the top of the scepter Church we're talking about Authority by position Esther has a position what she forgot was the authority that came with it and as soon as she comes into as soon as he sees her he says to the front of the queue come up right now come up my love come up my bride come up my queen you can come up and talk to me anytime and he extends his scepter of grace and mercy you don't die when you come into my presence you're invited into my presence how I missed you being in my presence she's all psyched up she's all worked up she's had to get all prayed up to come into the presence of the king and the king is so overjoy to see her that he extends a scepter and brings her up immediately her life was never in danger why because she had been chosen by him she did not choose him he chose her he chose her what was she worried about the law of the king said you've got to be called and Esther forgot you've been called not only have you been called you've been chosen you've been chosen you've been dressed you've been placed you share his bed with him you are his wife you are his Queen she completely forgot she got so caught up on the Old Testament that she forgot there was a new testament that brought a different path why she's in relationship now she's not under the law she's in relationship she has something that nobody else can claim I am the queen I am the wife of the king she's sitting there she's saying what if he turns me down what if he doesn't accept a scepter what if he doesn't show me mercy and Grace what if he does church that's so often what Satan's doing is he's pointing us to the law you did this and you did that and you you got a pimple here and you got a blemish there no you're already accepted what if he says yes what if he's already said yes what if he's already chosen what if you're already accepted and nothing you do can take that away so often we're waiting to make ourselves ready and he's saying I've already made you acceptable in the Beloved come into my presence so often we're wanting to make everything right before we come in no make it right in his presence come in Just the Way You Are why he's said you're my chosen bride I've accepted you amen he loves it when his bride comes to him and says Lord I need you I need you I want you I have to have you there's something that only you can do somebody was telling me about the that story of the man that came to the king and he asked him for a little thing and the King said no and then the next one came and I'm making up numbers here you know maybe one came and said I need $1,000 will you give it the king said no and then the next one came and said can I have $10 million and the King said yes and they said why would you give him 10 million and not the other one the Thousand he said because the guy that asked 10 million asked me something worthy of a king sometimes that's all God's wanting you to do is recognize what he can do for you he's not some prime minister he's not some present he is almighty God and sometimes he just needs you to recognize he can do way more than you could ever ask or think so ask and think of what he can do for you Paul said it this way in Romans 8 he says we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called the law said you had to be the called Church you're the called you can impress you can come into His presence at any time because you're the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified he just keeps doing and doing and doing and moving you forward and forward and forward and closer and closer and closer and it's a finished work it's already done it's already done in his eyes looking from eternity we are perfect we are acceptable in the Beloved he says what then What then shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us church this is not a moment by moment thing this is all the time it's already done God is for us because he's placed us as a part of his word and therefore we don't have to worry we don't have to wonder we don't have to psych ourselves up because that just leads to fear but if we can just say he's already accepted me and I know he's accepted me because of everything he's done in my life so far and he's going to finish what he started our rest is in the finished work not in the ongoing work he starts it and that means he's going to finish it but it's finished from eternity amen watch this nature there's a way to approach God and we see that Esther shows us that way she has authority to enter but she comes in meekness yielded to the will of the king she has authority to enter but she's seeking his will amen we're not demanding we're not a a petulant housewife we're yielded respectful appreciative we think to have authority we got to be all just ordering people around and do this and do that no to have authority we need to find his will and then the will of the king is behind us and that's our Authority the will of the king is what's going to get things done in Esther's life not cuz Esther has Authority but because the king is behind Esther and she stepped into his will and his way he says what did I say they were in the beginning actors he says quit acting religion get an old-fashioned experience of regeneration and be born again my Lord he says he longs to see you he's waiting for you he says but he takes the little place in the corner and he never rebukes you for it he loves you he says you go to church once or twice a month and you think you've done your duty he says oh if you only loved him you'd go every night and every day somewhere and talk with him if you loved him he says but the trouble of it is you just act Church act religious he says what a Pity it's too bad that we still have it church if this is the only time we spend with God something's wrong something is seriously wrong you're acting we're acting amen if this is the only place where the Bible is read if this is the only place where we sing and worship if this is the only place where there's the hearing of the word or the reading of the word we are acting he loves to spend time with you brother Braham says he'll sit over there in a little corner and wait for you to come to him he says God you know he says God's a gentleman he won't Force his way in he'll sit there and he'll wait and he won't rebuke you for it but when you come into His presence then he'll love you for it but the thing is once you get a taste of the presence of God Church you never want to go back to anything else you know why we love special meetings is because we get the feeling of his presence so many times but that doesn't have to happen only in special meetings by no means I'm a witness of it not to lift myself up but I'm seeing nodding heads here because we know what it's like to get in the presence of God and there everything just melts away the worry the fear self- condemnation sorrow disappointment depression all of those things they just melt away just one touch from him they sing that song Sweet Hour of Prayer sometimes I think we need to get an Hour of Prayer when's the last time we prayed for an hour where we laid everything aside and said Lord I just want to talk to you for an hour and and let him talk back and wash away those things that have been holding us back we need to stop acting religious church I'm not condemning you I'm not saying you're doing it I'm saying let's not be found in that place amen watch this nature of the king his Queen has come before him his chosen bride and she's risked her life in her mind and the king is like what are you worried about come up here come up here what would you have of me we've talked about Esther's nature let's see the nature of the of the bridegroom now he says then said the king unto her What wilt thou Queen Esther and what is thy request it shall even be given thee to the half of the Kingdom church if that's what a natural King will say what does the spiritual King say what does the king of kings and Lord of lords say he says I'll give you half of everything I have if you want you want it just ask and it's yours if that's the nature of a haist what about Jesus Christ who gave his life for us what would he hold back what would he hold back it says and Esther answered if it seemed good unto the king let the king and hmon come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him Esther saved she's alive she's found grace and favor and what does she do does she fall Weeping at his feet and and say you don't know what I've been through there's bad people after me I've been sick with this for 7 years no she says you've had a long day I want to wash your feet I want to take you away from the demands of your life I want to be an oasis for you I want to worship you I want to give you a good time just come with me and I'll I'll just make it everything just wash away let me do something for you King let me do something for you have you ever noticed in the Lord's Prayer it starts with acknowledgement of who he is and then it goes into worship and it goes into thankfulness and then it comes to our needs sometimes we're so rushed to get to our needs that we stop and forget he's God he's worthy of our worship he's worthy of Our Praise scripture says I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart and I will enter his courts with praise that's what Esther's doing here let me do something for you let me lift you up let me do something that benefits you the weight of the state is on your shoulders the weight of the kingdom is on your shoulders let me wash that away I've got a wonderful meal I've got a cool place for us to just sit and talk for a while but BR says it this way he says here's a woman that touched His Garment she was healed with a blood issue a soldier spit in his face face and put a crown of thorns on his head and felt no virtue he says it's your approach the attitude is what it takes we are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but it's your attitude that brings the results it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics are here and so is the Dynamics he says if you can just get started God will do the rest how do you get it started church right attitude right approach Lord I believe you're God lord I believe you've got the power Lord I believe you've got the will Lord I believe your word and I'm here to stand on your word and simple faith will start that thing rolling but you've got to come with the right attitude so often what we come my sister the one that's not serving the lord she said you know when I get to heaven God's got to answer to some things for some things to me you know what you'll never get to heaven with that attitude sometimes we're saying Lord you've done this to me and you've done this and you won't do this and you won't do that you know what you don't get anywhere with God like that be still and know that I'm God my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are not like your thoughts my ways are not your ways you can't come in complaining you've got to come in and say you are God and I know you've got all things in your hand and you got a plan and a purpose but you also have a word promise and I'm here to claim the word promise but help my attitude in the meantime help my attitude in the meantime we know the story Esther prepares a banquet specifically to please the king and at the end he asked her he says well what do you want nobody does this for me unless they want something so what do you want she says come again tomorrow and we'll do this whole thing over again then the next day he says to her what do you want and here's what she says he says the king said to Esther on the second day the banquet of wine what is I put ition Queen Esther and it shall be granted thee and what do I request and it shall be performed even to the half of the Kingdom he doesn't back away he says I'll give you whatever you want all the way to the half of the Kingdom we come back to our opening scripture in Psalms it says for the Lord God is a son and a shield newfinland we know all about the sun and the shield we need a shield from the daily weather and all we want is the Sun to get us away from the daily weather he says I'm both he says the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly nothing no good thing will he withhold what's a good thing something that's in his will for your good amen says and Esther the queen answered and said if I have found favor in thy sight oh Queen oh King and if it pleased the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request for we are sold I and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we have been sold for bombman and bombom I had held my tongue though the enemy could not countervail the king's damage I had no clue what that was talking about so I had to go to the Amplified and what that means there it says but if we had been sold for Bond men and bond women I would have held my tongue for our Affliction is not to be compared with the damage that this will do to the king so even in all of this Esther is saying King your law is going to hurt you not just me and I'm worried she says if we were just going to be sold into slavery I'd have been fine with that but we're going to be killed and this is going to be the second wife that you're going to lose and it's going to hurt your reputation she says so I'm here to keep your reputation intact it's not all about Esther Esther says King you've been through a lot you don't want to lose another wife so I if they were just going to put me away that' be fine she says but I'm going to lose my life and it'll be according to your law it'll be your fault and we don't want that you don't want that it says then the king of haaris answered and said unto Esther the queen who is he and where is he that does pres presume in his heart to do so and Esther said the adversarii and enemy is this wicked hmon then hmon was afraid before the king and the queen you know hmon had everything going right he had the king's seal he had the king's law on his side he had honor and favor he was the prince of princes and then he goes and tells his wife I'm invited to a banquet for the queen and everything's great except for this guy morai and she says 'w just build a big Gallows 50 cubits High that's about 65t uh sorry 75 ft tall that's a big a big Gallows she says and then hang Mori on that when the day comes and so he does that and the scripture says his heart was merry I think or something like that he's all happy but the very night so between these two Banquets what happens is the king he's something triggers his memory and he says didn't somebody help me with an assassination a while ago who was it that did that and he couldn't remember come to find out it was morai and so he calls in hmon and he says who's around that can tell me what to do with this man they say well Hon's outside he says brings hmon in he says heon what do I do to a man that has pleased the king so wonderfully and hmon thinks it's all about him he says well dress him in your robes and put this on him and do that and let him ride the king's horse and let him walk through the streets and have one of your princes you know lead him along and and treat him like the king so Hon's like thinking he's at the peak and things can only get better and the King says wonderful go do that to Mori and Hon's life just starts to unravel church so long we're facing things and we're dealing with things and it seems like it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and nothing can stop it Satan's got so much momentum he's got such Dee rooted things in our lives and we think it's just getting worse and worse and worse and in one night in 24 hours hymon went to from second in the Kingdom to dead in his own trap like that when God moves church he moves and Nothing Stops God and Hon's whole world starts to unravel and so he starts his day off by Leading Mori through the streets and bringing honor and glory to the man that refused to Bow the knee to him so then he's like well at least I can go to the Queen's banquet and then there he finds out that he has threatened the Queen's life scripture says he he literally jumps on he jumps on her to try and plead he's so he's just trying to grab onto her to to plead for Mercy plead for his life and the King walks in with him while he's got his hands on the queen church God does not take things lightly when Satan messes with your life he'll allow certain things for a while but in the end you don't want to be on God's bad side and he says take him out what do we do they say oh he built these Gallows for Mori Mori now now you're going after the guy that saved my life and you want my queen as well he says just hang him there and he hung him right there and that was it in one moment Church everything gone done and we're sitting there saying where is God where is God where's my authority where's the power get into his presence see what he's got to say about it and he'll take care of the rest but notice now Hon's gone he's the henchman he's he's the the ring leader of this whole thing but the law is still the law the law says the Jews can be killed the law says that people can go after them and take their things and take their lives in all of these different things the Jews are still under the law of death and so Esther comes back and it says and Esther spake yet before the the king so she comes a day or two later and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the Mischief of hon the agagite and his device that he had devised against the Jews so she comes into the king's presence yet again it says then the king held out the golden scepter towards Esther what does the scripture say his mercies are new every morning she didn't use up his good will she didn't use up all of his love and favor and Grace he does the exact same thing again amen he says so Esther Rose and stood before the king and said if it pleased the king and if I have found favor in his sight and the things seem right before The King and I be pleasing in his eyes she says if you want it and if you like me and if you find me pleasing and if it's in your heart to do it she doesn't say this is what I want she says if it's your will that's what she's saying if it's your will she says Let It Be written to reverse the letters devised by hmon the son of hamadaa the agagite which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's Province I want you to catch something here because we're all about not we the Royal we the thought of adoption is we're just going to go around and we're going to speak this and speak that and speak that but you see this whole process and its attitude its approach it's the will of God it's knowing the time knowing the season knowing the purpose right motive right objective there's so many things baked into this and we want to say that people go down the water come out and all of a sudden they're going around having adoptive power doesn't make any sense doesn't make any sense Esther is in this for what the king thinks best even if it costs her something even if it costs her something Church Brothers I can guarantee you you're going to have to pay a price for serving Christ sisters you have to pay a price for serving Christ and sometimes we've just got to say that goes with the role that's it his will is greater than my will his vision is more than my vision his thoughts are higher than my thoughts we don't go in and use this just because brother Bram says this he says see we don't use the gift of God for commercial gain we look at all these Ministries and what are they trying to do grow big churches get more money get bigger programs get more influence and it usually comes down to money the scpt scripture says the love of money is the root of all evil we don't use what God gives us for commercial gain if I'm behind this Pulpit to make money I need to be out if this church never paid me a salary I should still be here because I'm not in it for the money he says we don't use the gift of God for commercial gain no no he says he could tell me where I was at but I don't have any need of it he's talking about oil in Kentucky and he says there's oil in those Hills and they said well brother brandom tell us where it is and then we'll go and we'll start an oil company and we'll give you royalties off of that place and we can do we can fund your campaigns and you won't ever have to worry about it he says no we don't do this for commercial gain I'm not here to make money just because he says see he says I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him see if I had a need of it I believe if I'd ask him he'd tell me but first you see your motives and objectives have to be right you have to have reasons for this God doesn't give you those things just because you ask he's not a doting grandfather remember how many times would the prophet of God say that he's not a doting grandfather kids love to go to Grandma and grandpas n and Pops don't they because they get a lot more than they get at their mother and father's house God isn't that way he says God doesn't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that to be in the will of God now that narrows it down quite a bit doesn't it John would say we know that we ask him anything he'll give it to us if we ask it in his will Prophet says see if you want to be well what do you want to be well for he says if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get healed see you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God he says and that's when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith in there then it's over watch Esther now she's saying How Can I Endure to see the evil that shall come upon my people or How Can I Endure to see the destruction of my Kindred she says I can't endure it this will be too much but she has said if it's in your will then make it go away Jesus said the same thing let this cup pass but nevertheless not my will but thine be done we see the exact same nature in the bride here I don't want to go through this but if that's what you want I'll go through it I don't think I can do it but I'll go through it it says then the king of hasar said unto Esther the queen and Mori the Jew behold I have given Esther the house of hmon and him have they hanged upon the Gallows because he laid his hand upon the Jews we're speaking about Authority by position now here's your Authority write ye also for the Jews as it liketh you that means write whatever you want speak whatever you want I've given you authority to correct the situation speak and go forward he says write ye also for the Jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring what does the scripture say let all that we do be done in in the name of Jesus Christ that's not a a catch all phrase you know there's that song that says I speak Jesus you better make sure Jesus wants to be in that situation in the way that you're talking about because it's not this willy-nilly thing where we just go around and start rubber stamping things in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we need to go into the presence of Jesus to find out if it's in his name or not but he says you've come in and I'm telling you that what you want to do is in my will so now he says go and do it in my name go and do it in my name with the king's Ring he says for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's Ring May no man reverse I was listening to be certain of God and he says that God he he says when you have met his requirement you have met his obligation when you have cleaned yourself up everything that Esther did he says then he says God obligates himself to his word to his word you've met his requirement now he meets his requirement amen and what is it his word is a benefit to us always and so Mori wrote in the king of haar's name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent Letters by posts on Horseback Riders on mules camels and the young dromedaries he says wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy and to slay and to cause to perish you know what that's three ways of saying your toast destroy slay and cause to perish to me they all mean the same thing obviously they don't to God three different things all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for prey this is not just defense now church this is offense because the law is there that's saying you can kill the Jews now he gives a law to the Jews saying you can can kill anybody that would want to come against you no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every place that the soul of your foot shall tread belongs to you one of you shall chase a thousand the Jews are outnumbered the Jews are outnumbered but he gives them a law that says you don't have to take it you can choose to stay under the law and die or you can step into my grace and favor and you can destroy the works of the devil your choice jump down to verse 16 Church what happens when we get Grace the Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor says and in every Province and in every city withersoever the king's commandment and his decree came the Jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day and many of the people of the land became Jews for the fear of the Jews fell upon them they got converts to this when they saw the grace and favor of the king what did he say to the disciples go you onto all the world and preach the gospel in my name you cast out devils and lay hands on the sick and they shall recover do all these things what are they doing they're showing the grace and favor of the god the king that's behind them amen hmon thought he'd use the law against God's chosen people people God said I'm going to fulfill the law and I'm going to give them a Grace law that allows them to overcome everything that you place in front of them but I want you to finish this verse this morning as we start to close we saw that scripture and we we attributed it to hmon it says moreover the law entered that the offense might abound he says but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound I've got lots of problems brother John I've got situations I got issues in my life yeah there's Grace though that's bigger than that we sing that song greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses is the blood that still sets me free to do what worship him to come into His presence there's an abounding Grace that's offered this morning and your Authority is to come in and say I'm here for Grace brother B would say have you met Grace have you met Grace this morning or as hyon as the law sitting they're saying you're not worthy You Can't Raise Your Hands In Worship You can't come up for prayer you can't claim the promise because the law says you're not worthy or do you say he's extended that scepter of unmerited unwarranted you don't deserve it favor and said come in anyways and take what is freely given to you amen we're under the authority of Grace now church and our position brings us into a place to expect that it will abound abound above which we could ask above what we could think do you ever notice the second time that Esther comes in she doesn't have to psych herself up she doesn't have to fast for three days she doesn't have to lay everything aside she just knows now I'm chosen I'm accepted I'm the Beloved and she walks in in humility and bows at his feet and she gets an immediate audience and I don't believe Esther ever had a problem going into the king's presence again sometimes you got to get past that first little barrier amen when I gave my heart to the Lord I felt unworthy and since then I have felt unworthy so many times cuz I fail myself much less him but yet his mercies are new every single morning and I am bidden I am invited I am compelled remember Church we're not the you know the you got the the parable of the of the wedding supper where were in the highways and the byways we were in the hedges and the ditches he is literally dragging us into his presence why are we fighting we've got authority to go in by his invitation enter ye into the joy of your lord Esther learned that law didn't apply to her she was in a Grace relationship now and she could come in any time with any need and he'd have an answer for her might not be the answer she wanted but he'd have an answer for her every single time and it would be for her benefit let's stand as we read one last scripture James 4:6 says this but he giveth see grace we we think grace is enough because Grace isn't warranted Grace is not deserved but he says he gives more grace and more grace and more grace and more Grace it's tied to Mercy we don't deserve it but we can have at any time it says wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you he says cleanse your hands ye Sinners purify your hearts ye double-minded make up your mind are you in or are you out are you bride or are you not are you a Christian or are you not are you his a chosen elected seed or are you not remember what Joshua would say or or Elijah would say or Elisha up on the mountain Elijah how long will you help between two opinions how long will you listen to the law Grace is here and there's more grace and more grace let it apply to your life and recognize you've got authority to come into His presence to get an audience with the King amen he says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up and man if you've been holding yourself back from him you've got a right to enter in humility in meekness but also in expectation that you can have an audience with the King amen nothing's holding him back you just got to say Lord I want to be in your presence do we know that song in your presence that's where I belong can we play that quietly just as we start to to close here you got a need this morning you got a situation this morning and it's been there and it's hanging over you like a sword over your head you just need to get in his presence you say I have a need I have a need you know in Alcoholics Anonymous the first thing they say you have to admit what you are you have to admit where you are and we can sit around and we can act religious I'm a Christian I'm a preacher I'm a deacon I'm a mature believer I don't have problems I don't have situations or we can say Lord I'm in need of you this morning amen you got a need let's bow our heads each one he every head bowed you got a need you just lift your hand to him nobody's looking you say Lord I got a problem Lord I got a situation Lord I've got a desire in my life and it's unfulfilled but Lord I believe your presence is here this morning and I've got Authority as your chosen elect bride to stand before you and say I'm in need of more Grace I'm in need of a touch from you I'm in need of healing I'm in need of Deliverance and Lord you're the only one that can do it this morning amen let's go to him in prayer each one Heavenly Father Lord so many hands up Lord my hands are both up Lord we're in need of you this morning Lord and we started this humble service Lord with pour your spirit out on me Lord and in your presence is where we belong and we're
