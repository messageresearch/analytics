[36:56] them we ask in Jesus J Christ's name
[36:59] amen amen God bless you turn if you
[37:01] would to Ephesians chapter
[37:03] 1 Ephesians chapter
[37:07] 1 amen good to see each one here
[37:10] tonight and I'm going to try and preach
[37:13] tonight my voice was good enough to yell
[37:16] at my youngest to come in the house
[37:17] before church so if I'm good enough to
[37:20] do that I should be good enough to
[37:21] preach for a while as long as I don't
[37:23] get too excited amen so we're just
[37:25] trusting the Lord tonight amen good to
[37:28] see each one good to see brother Chad
[37:29] back in service and he survived another
[37:31] round another battle amen amen it was so
[37:35] good to be in there and just hear him
[37:36] start to to praise the Lord and it's a
[37:39] good thing you know I was reading in the
[37:40] church age book this this afternoon and
[37:44] you know it was uh brother Brown was
[37:46] talking there about how we forgotten the
[37:47] goodness of God and what it means to be
[37:50] free in the spirit and he was talking
[37:51] about the the the the spirit of the
[37:53] nickan what it did was it took
[37:55] everything away from the people and put
[37:56] it into the man behind the pulpit it put
[37:58] it into the officers of the church and
[38:00] these things and what they lost with
[38:02] that was not just the moving and the
[38:04] leadership of the Holy Spirit but they
[38:05] lost the effect of the holy spirit in
[38:07] their Worship in their praise and all
[38:09] these different things and he's pointing
[38:11] out that we're all one in Christ and
[38:13] that means when the holy spirit moves we
[38:15] all move amen we're all caught in it
[38:18] we're all going with it and I think it's
[38:20] a good thing that if we can be free in
[38:21] our worship if we can be free in our
[38:23] praise to express what God's doing and
[38:25] what he's saying and how he's leading us
[38:27] and providing us in our lives so amen
[38:30] it's good to have each one of you here
[38:31] God bless you richly Ephesians 1 very
[38:34] familiar scripture verse three says
[38:36] blessed be the God and father of our
[38:38] Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with
[38:40] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[38:42] places in Christ according as he had
[38:45] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[38:48] of in him before the foundation of the
[38:50] world that we should be holy and Without
[38:52] Blame before him in love having
[38:55] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[38:57] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[39:00] according to the good pleasure of his
[39:02] will amen God bless you you can have
[39:04] your seats this evening
[39:06] and we're continuing on our series on
[39:08] manifesting time and I want to take a
[39:10] second service on the revealing of the
[39:12] son and last service we focused a great
[39:14] deal on the Eternal part of God and and
[39:17] why we are children of God and how we're
[39:18] coming to a place and why we're coming
[39:20] to a place and I had to kind of Rush at
[39:22] the end because my voice was going very
[39:24] quickly and so I just want to to to just
[39:27] back up just a second and just kind of
[39:28] close that off before we get into our
[39:30] thought this evening amen so I started
[39:33] in Ephesians 1 and I want to just
[39:35] continue there a little bit tonight
[39:36] we're just going to teach by God's grace
[39:38] and it'll be easier on my voice amen but
[39:41] it says in in verse three blessed be the
[39:42] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[39:45] who ha blessed us with all spiritual
[39:47] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ I
[39:52] think that's a beautiful scripture when
[39:53] it says all spiritual blessings amen I
[39:55] want everything that God has for for me
[39:57] and there's nothing that is held back
[40:00] from the children of God when they step
[40:02] into his plan there's nothing that's
[40:03] held back we preached remember on the
[40:05] the benefits the blessings of being a
[40:07] child of God there is nothing that he
[40:09] has held back from us in this time and
[40:10] in this season everything in his word is
[40:13] for us now remember when they went into
[40:15] Canaan there was nothing held back he
[40:17] says you go in there you take it
[40:19] everything that's in there is for you
[40:20] and God is no different today he's
[40:22] saying everything in here if you can put
[40:24] your name behind those Scriptures it
[40:26] belongs to you it's yours and you can
[40:28] have it amen it's for the children of
[40:30] God by faith just like Abraham had but
[40:32] verse four says according as Heath
[40:34] chosen Us in him in him now I looked at
[40:38] at that and and we say that's in Christ
[40:41] yes that was in Christ and and we came
[40:43] out of his side at Calvary and these
[40:44] different things but when you go back to
[40:46] the original word that word in is the
[40:48] same as a woman who's pregnant where she
[40:51] has a baby in her it literally means
[40:54] that there's a life inside it means that
[40:56] he chose us he carried us inside of him
[41:00] and the inference there is that he's he
[41:02] he put us there with purpose and he's
[41:04] going to bring us to life the same way a
[41:05] woman would bring a baby to life when
[41:07] she has a full pregnancy and everything
[41:09] goes through the way it's supposed to so
[41:12] it says according us as he had chosen Us
[41:13] in him in Christ
[41:15] when when we acted on the word when we
[41:18] finally got our lives together when we
[41:20] we finally started coming to church no
[41:23] before before everything before
[41:27] everything we were chosen in him amen
[41:30] before the foundation of the world and
[41:32] look at the effect of that choosing of
[41:34] being in him not the effect that we make
[41:36] the effect of his choosing now it says
[41:39] the effect of his choosing is that we
[41:41] should be holy like he is that we should
[41:44] be without blame that we would be free
[41:46] of judgment before him in love amen the
[41:49] driving force the the very character the
[41:51] very nature of God is love which means
[41:53] it is for our benefit so everything that
[41:56] he's provided for us is for our benefit
[41:59] it's to make our lives better not worse
[42:02] but our lives are better in his kingdom
[42:05] not in this Kingdom amen the the the the
[42:08] greatness of his life is not expressed
[42:10] here it's really when we go to the other
[42:12] side and then we come back to a new
[42:13] Heaven and a new Earth amen but his his
[42:15] purpose is that we be holy and blame
[42:18] blameless before him in love verse 5
[42:21] says having predestinated us unto the
[42:24] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[42:26] himself according to what again our
[42:29] great lives our great actions our great
[42:31] faith our great acceptance no according
[42:35] to the good pleasure of his will now
[42:39] remember when I said that children of
[42:41] God are the only ones that don't get to
[42:42] choose where they go here's your proof
[42:44] of it he has already decided where we're
[42:47] going to be because we were with him in
[42:49] the beginning we have to be with him
[42:50] there in the End Amen we're
[42:52] predestinated and we've got to go back
[42:54] to our origin and that's his will not
[42:56] our will I said before you can go the
[42:58] hard way or you can go the easy way you
[43:00] can go Kicking and Screaming remember
[43:02] like Paul when the when when the pillar
[43:04] of fire knocked him off his horse he
[43:06] says Paul it's hard to kick against the
[43:07] Pricks Paul's conscience was bothering
[43:10] him Saul's conscience was bothering him
[43:12] as he was called at that time and Jesus
[43:14] said it it's easier to just go the the
[43:16] way I've called you to go like why are
[43:18] you fighting so hard against the thing
[43:20] that's inside of you to do I've said
[43:22] this before over the pulpit I've said it
[43:24] to people if I'm wrong in what I believe
[43:27] believe I'm happy where I'm at because
[43:29] there's something in me that identifies
[43:31] with this so whether it's right or wrong
[43:33] I can't change it I'm identified with it
[43:35] amen and it has changed me and it has
[43:37] made me who I am and it's the same for
[43:39] children of God Amen is that there's
[43:41] something in us that responds to the
[43:42] word of God and it's not by our choosing
[43:44] it's not by our intellect it's not by
[43:46] our family bloodline it's not because of
[43:48] the ministry we're under but rather it
[43:50] is the election of God that predestines
[43:52] us to come back to him in his time and
[43:54] in his season it's according to his will
[43:58] not according to my will amen then he
[44:00] says in verse six as we'll continue on
[44:02] says to the praise of the glory of his
[44:05] grace I think Amazing Grace is going to
[44:07] be the theme song in in heaven because
[44:10] it's not going to be anything I did
[44:12] it'll be there because of his
[44:14] predestined grace and favor that I am
[44:17] there that everything I have that
[44:20] everything I've been given that
[44:21] everything I do will be because he put
[44:24] me in himself before the foundation of
[44:26] the world Amen our glory is not in
[44:28] oursel our glory is in his grace amen
[44:31] that has brought us to the place where
[44:32] we are today and where we're going to be
[44:34] in that great time to the praise of the
[44:36] glory of his grace wherein he ha made us
[44:40] accepted his grace makes up us accepted
[44:43] not my works not my righteousness not my
[44:46] Sanctified life not my my work as a
[44:48] minister or yours as a Believer whatever
[44:50] it might be but it is what his grace
[44:53] that has made us accepted in the Beloved
[44:56] in whom we have Redemption through his
[44:58] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[45:01] to the riches of his grace yet again
[45:03] it's Grace Grace Grace wherein he had oh
[45:07] I love this he has
[45:10] abounded sometimes Jesus said you have
[45:13] not because you ask not ask that your
[45:15] joy may be full he's abounded in us
[45:19] there's an abundance there's an
[45:21] overflowing of what he's willing to give
[45:23] us and the measure that we get is only
[45:25] limited by how much we're willing to
[45:26] take not by how much he's willing to
[45:28] give his grace is endless his mercies
[45:30] are endless his forgiveness is endless
[45:33] it it's all there and all that limits us
[45:34] is our faith to take it and come to him
[45:37] amen as he's he's made us accepted he
[45:39] says he has abounded toward us in all
[45:42] wisdom and Prudence why wisdom and
[45:44] Prudence because we need it we need it
[45:47] what is wisdom wisdom is knowledge put
[45:49] properly into
[45:51] action and you know what is we're taught
[45:53] very well but the test is really what
[45:55] will we do when we have to put that into
[45:58] action amen he has all experience he
[46:00] knows all things he's he's the
[46:02] omniscient God he knows everything and
[46:04] so when we have need of something the
[46:06] scripture says if any man lack wisdom
[46:07] let him go to God who abrath not but
[46:09] giveth unto every man as he wants so
[46:12] he's given us all wisdom Prudence means
[46:14] understanding so we can have we can have
[46:17] leadership we can have guidance on what
[46:18] to do and we can have understanding
[46:20] about what's going on behind the scenes
[46:22] as well he's holding nothing back from
[46:24] his church nothing back from his bride
[46:26] nothing back from his his children and
[46:28] we saw what he did with the disciples he
[46:30] says to them it's not given but to you
[46:32] it's given he says they're servants but
[46:35] you're my friends you're my brothers
[46:36] I've opened up the Mysteries to you I'm
[46:38] showing you what God's doing in this
[46:40] time it says and then it says he's he's
[46:43] having made know unto us the mystery of
[46:45] his will the mystery of what why we're
[46:48] here who are we why are we what we are
[46:50] what's our part to play in it why you
[46:52] why me we have all of those answers
[46:55] today in principle
[46:57] but specifically it's going to be for
[46:59] each one of us in our individual walk
[47:00] with God as he shows us his purpose and
[47:02] his plan for each one of us he says
[47:04] having made un note unto us the mystery
[47:06] of his will according to his good
[47:09] pleasure we don't get to pick he's
[47:12] already determine what we should be and
[47:13] how we should live this life according
[47:15] to his good pleasure which he had
[47:17] purposed in himself that in the
[47:19] dispensation of the fullness of times
[47:22] this literally means that in the
[47:23] stewardship of the Season where all
[47:26] things are f filled he is the great
[47:28] Steward he's the one that's managing it
[47:30] he's like if you look at Joseph in
[47:32] Pharaoh's Kingdom Joseph was the steward
[47:34] of all things Pharaoh said go do it and
[47:36] he did it he said you don't have to tell
[47:38] me how to do it just do it this is the
[47:39] way Christ is is he's taking care of the
[47:41] entire situation and he's bringing it
[47:43] all together it says that in the
[47:46] fullness dispensation of the fullness of
[47:48] times he might gather together in one
[47:51] all things in Christ so everything that
[47:55] was in him before the foundation of the
[47:56] world has to be with him at the at the
[47:58] ending of the world and when things
[48:00] become new and all these different
[48:01] things he says both which are in heaven
[48:03] those that have gone on the saints that
[48:04] have gone on by way of the grave and
[48:06] which are on earth amen those that are
[48:08] alive and remain at his coming it says
[48:10] even in him so it's all in him it
[48:13] started with him it finished with him
[48:15] we're the product of his pleasure his
[48:16] will his desire and we do not have a
[48:18] part in determining those things it is
[48:21] completely of him and it's the grace of
[48:23] God Amen he chose us before we ever
[48:25] chose him and that gives me great
[48:26] satisfaction because even when I don't
[48:28] feel like serving him even when the
[48:31] feeling's not there when the emotion's
[48:32] not there when you're just not feeling
[48:34] it yet we continue on because he chose
[48:37] us and there's an anchor that ties us
[48:39] and that anchor is the predestination of
[48:41] God that we are as children look at how
[48:43] Jesus chose his disciples when he walked
[48:45] on Earth so you got to realize that some
[48:47] came to Jesus under preaching they heard
[48:50] the word and they came but when Jesus
[48:52] chose the disciples he didn't preach to
[48:53] them what did he do he walked by and he
[48:56] said follow follow me and he walked by
[48:58] another one and he said follow me he
[48:59] chose them he said I have chosen you
[49:04] amen he went out and he called them and
[49:06] he chose them in the condition they were
[49:08] in that's the beauty of it am man I'm
[49:10] reminded of brother Mark he calls
[49:11] himself you know a raw Heathen living
[49:13] under a mushroom and then God speaks to
[49:15] him and it's
[49:17] like and he realizes he's a Son of God
[49:21] in his condition a backsliding Catholic
[49:25] at best no knowing nothing of the true
[49:27] word of God what happens the spirit of
[49:30] God comes his way and says follow me and
[49:33] without it making a lick of sense
[49:35] brother Mark you did it not knowing what
[49:37] you responded to and each one of us has
[49:39] to come to that place where when he
[49:41] calls we answer you look at them they
[49:43] didn't we don't see anything about them
[49:45] saying well let me see we do that we do
[49:48] hear that from the ones that never
[49:50] followed him remember let me go back and
[49:52] bury my father and let me go back and
[49:54] say goodbye those ones never followed
[49:56] him but the ones that followed him were
[49:58] the ones that were called and he goes to
[50:00] Peter and Andrew and they're fishing he
[50:01] says follow me and the scripture says
[50:03] they left their Nets and went right away
[50:06] then he goes to backslid and Matthew the
[50:08] the the the traitor to his people the
[50:10] tax collector and he says follow me and
[50:12] Matthew leaves a great job to go and
[50:15] follow
[50:16] Christ and these were not the Great Men
[50:19] of the time these were not the wonderful
[50:21] Scholars the scripture says that Peter
[50:22] and John were ignorant and unlearned men
[50:26] but he took them where they were how
[50:28] they were because they were his
[50:31] children
[50:33] amen remember John 15:16 Jesus said you
[50:36] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[50:39] and ordained you he does not choose us
[50:42] without purpose or without plan he says
[50:44] he's ordained them that you should go
[50:46] forth and bring forth fruit and catch
[50:49] this that your fruit should remain
[50:52] because you can look at Judas and he had
[50:54] fruit for a while but after a while what
[50:56] happened it went away I'm going to start
[50:57] preaching if this keeps up his fruit
[50:59] went away it didn't stay because he was
[51:02] not a child of God Jesus said I've
[51:04] chosen you and one of you is a devil he
[51:06] had to choose him because of his purpose
[51:08] he was
[51:10] ordained to to betray Jesus but the
[51:13] others he said I've chosen you that you
[51:14] would produce fruit and that your fruit
[51:17] would remain then there's a
[51:20] pause remember there's the semicolon or
[51:23] the full colon there I can't tell my
[51:24] eyes aren't so good I'm like screen but
[51:27] then he says and after a while then he
[51:28] says that whatsoever you shall ask of
[51:31] the father in my name he may give it to
[51:32] you he says there's a time for your
[51:34] fruit and then your fruit to remain and
[51:36] then after that is adoption you're going
[51:39] to ask things in my name and I'll give
[51:40] you whatsoever you ask because you ask
[51:42] according to my will you come into a
[51:44] season where you're mature let's not
[51:46] just look at the men look at the women
[51:48] that followed him you look at Mary the
[51:50] mother of James and Martha the the
[51:52] sister of Lazareth spiritual women good
[51:54] women that followed him that were very
[51:56] obedient to the word then you have Mary
[51:58] Magdalene that was full of sem demons
[52:00] and the one of the first things he did
[52:02] was he delivered her of that but she was
[52:04] as chosen as Mary the mother of James
[52:06] and as Martha the sister of Lazarus look
[52:09] at he goes to that woman at the well one
[52:11] of the most beautiful stories in
[52:13] scripture of the predestination of God
[52:15] and and this woman at the well was
[52:17] overcome with life's problems she has
[52:19] already married and divorced five men
[52:21] she's living common law and she comes
[52:24] and she meets Christ at the well and
[52:27] he's not there by happen stance he goes
[52:30] out of his way to meet this woman the
[52:33] scripture says he must needs go by
[52:35] Samaria in in literal point it means
[52:38] that he had to go to Samaria it was
[52:42] necessary why because there was a child
[52:44] of God that didn't know she was a child
[52:46] of God but when the word of God would
[52:48] flash across her life what would happen
[52:51] she would realize I am a a child of God
[52:53] I'm a daughter of God and it freed her
[52:55] from everything that was holding her
[52:57] back the Revelation that you're a child
[53:00] of God when you truly get it will put
[53:02] aside everything that Satan has against
[53:03] you this
[53:04] evening as soon as she realized who he
[53:07] was and that he had come to
[53:10] her it freed her from everything and she
[53:13] could go back and testify and in an
[53:15] entire city heeded her words and came
[53:17] out and they accepted Christ for who he
[53:20] was what an amazing testimony of what
[53:22] happens when predestinated Sons and
[53:24] Daughters recognize who they are and
[53:26] recognize that God is for them and he's
[53:28] not against them and he's got good
[53:30] thoughts toward them to bring them to an
[53:31] expected end that's why we are here
[53:33] today that's why you're here today
[53:35] that's why I'm here today is that there
[53:36] is something inside of us that he placed
[53:38] inside of us before we ever came on this
[53:40] world Amen it was in the thoughts of God
[53:43] and God came in every day each one of us
[53:45] we have a day where he says you're
[53:47] mine and sometimes we fight like Paul
[53:50] like saled and sometimes we heed right
[53:52] away but there's got to come a day where
[53:54] we say I am a child of God and we start
[53:56] to live like it because he's given us a
[53:59] revelation of who we are brother br will
[54:01] put it this way he says now in the
[54:02] beginning way back way years ago before
[54:04] there was a time began you if you are a
[54:08] born again Christian tonight you were in
[54:10] God then your father that's why when you
[54:13] come into this life here and profess
[54:14] Christianity well everything going wrong
[54:16] you've wondered why this is and all this
[54:18] if you've wondered at it but one day
[54:20] something struck you what was it that
[54:23] life that was down in there from the
[54:26] beginning you can't add it in and you
[54:28] can't take it out it's there or it's not
[54:32] and that sounds hard but it's true there
[54:35] are some that are chosen and then there
[54:37] are some that are just drawn and the
[54:39] chosen are the elect predestinated
[54:41] children of God and that's the mystery
[54:43] that's been hidden all through this time
[54:45] is is what in the dispensation of the
[54:47] fullness of times what happens is the
[54:48] mystery of God's Redemption plan comes
[54:50] into its fullness and we see what it was
[54:52] all about we see who's a part of it we
[54:54] see our part in it we see all the things
[54:56] that God's trying trying to do but
[54:58] within that mystery of redemption we
[55:00] have the mystery of adoption we have the
[55:02] mystery of his coming we have the
[55:03] mystery of his will we have the mystery
[55:05] of his the Resurrection The Rapture and
[55:07] it's all a part great of the great
[55:08] mystery of God that he's trying to
[55:10] reveal in us and through us and to us
[55:14] it's all through us now amen Paul said
[55:16] this in Hebrews he said wherefor seeing
[55:18] we are also compassed about with so
[55:20] greater cloud of witnesses let us lay
[55:22] aside every weight and every and the sin
[55:25] which does so easily beset us and let us
[55:28] run with patience the race that is set
[55:31] before us I was reading in the Ephesian
[55:33] Church age this morning or this
[55:35] afternoon and and he was focused on on
[55:38] this idea of repentance he says if
[55:39] you've seen the word and you've walked
[55:41] away from it come back do it while
[55:44] there's still repentance available do it
[55:46] while there's still a spirit of God with
[55:48] the mercy there to receive it and do it
[55:50] quickly because there comes a time where
[55:52] there is no more repentance available
[55:54] let's he that's filthy be filthy and let
[55:56] him that's holy be holy still amen
[55:58] there's a time when it's get cut it gets
[56:00] cut off it says and let us run with
[56:02] patience the race that is set before us
[56:04] looking unto
[56:06] Jesus oh if we can catch this Revelation
[56:09] the author and the finisher of our
[56:12] faith we sing that song something keeps
[56:15] holding me it is not myself that holds
[56:18] me he is the author and the finisher he
[56:20] is the Alpha and the Omega he is the
[56:22] beginning and the end and everything in
[56:25] between is him and his work we look to
[56:28] him to finish this he started it I I've
[56:32] said it before I didn't want to be a
[56:33] Christian because I didn't think I would
[56:35] like it and I wanted to have freedom to
[56:37] go and become a doctor and and have nice
[56:39] cars and live a nice life and all these
[56:41] different things I didn't want to be a
[56:43] Christian but something in me wanted to
[56:46] be a Christian but I didn't want to be a
[56:47] Christian and I fought it for so long
[56:49] and eventually I gave my heart to the
[56:50] Lord because I was more miserable not
[56:52] being a Christian than potentially the
[56:53] Christian that I thought I didn't want
[56:55] to be and all I found all I found out as
[56:57] soon as I gave my heart to the Lord was
[56:58] I love being a Christian why because I
[57:00] am a Christian I am a Son of God you are
[57:03] a daughter of God you are a son of God
[57:04] you'll find yourself so much happier
[57:06] when you give in to what God has for you
[57:09] amen and there's a fulfillment that
[57:10] comes with it there's a peace there's a
[57:12] rest he says looking unto Jesus the
[57:15] author and finisher of our faith he's
[57:17] telling us this for a reason who for the
[57:20] joy that was set before him endured the
[57:22] cross despising the shame and is set
[57:24] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[57:26] God Paul's Paul's telling us look to him
[57:30] as your example look to him as your
[57:33] anchor look to him as your strength
[57:35] because you've got a path that's going
[57:36] to be like his and he did it because he
[57:39] saw what was waiting at the end and
[57:41] you've got to be able to see that
[57:42] there's something at the end of all this
[57:43] trouble at the end of all this trial at
[57:45] the end of this persecution of this
[57:47] hardship that we go with
[57:50] amen that's where I was going last
[57:52] service that's a a grand wrap up of it
[57:54] but I want to talk about Jesus's morning
[57:56] and and his life and his adoption
[57:58] process and how it worked and how he
[58:00] came to a place of adoption and in Luke
[58:03] 2 it says and it came to pass that after
[58:05] 3 days they remember they left Jesus
[58:07] they they they they'd gone there for the
[58:09] feast and they left and they were gone a
[58:10] couple days and they couldn't find him
[58:11] in the Caravan and so they had to come
[58:13] back and find him and they're all mad
[58:14] and upset and worried and it says and
[58:16] they came to pass that after 3 days they
[58:18] found him in the temple sitting in the
[58:20] midst of the doctors the doctors of the
[58:22] law both hearing them and asking them
[58:25] questions and all that heard him were
[58:27] astonished at his understanding and
[58:29] answers 12 years old who's 12 here I
[58:31] think Gabe's
[58:32] 12 Gabe would have been astonishing the
[58:37] ministry that's how far Jesus had
[58:39] progressed the 12
[58:41] years and when they saw him they were
[58:43] amazed and his mother said to him son
[58:45] why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold
[58:48] thy father and I have sought thee soring
[58:50] we're worried why'd you do this to us
[58:52] and he said unto them how is it that ye
[58:54] sought me whing not did you not know
[58:57] that I must be about my father's
[59:00] business but if you strip this down we
[59:02] look at the father's business and we get
[59:04] a certain idea that but if you go to the
[59:06] original language Jesus says don't you
[59:08] know that in my father's house it
[59:10] behooves me to be
[59:13] me he says I'm in my father's house I've
[59:15] got to act like my father when I'm in my
[59:17] father's house in other words he saying
[59:20] I'm coming to a place where I've got to
[59:22] display who I really am it's going to
[59:24] come to a place where I've got to let
[59:26] the world know who I am amen and we're
[59:28] at the same place Satan's Children are
[59:30] definitely being revealed nothing's
[59:33] hidden amen the son of preditions been
[59:36] revealed what about God's children if
[59:39] they're being revealed clearly then the
[59:41] children of God ought to be revealed
[59:42] clearly as well but he confounded them
[59:45] here and it says and they understood not
[59:46] the same which he spake unto them and he
[59:49] went down with them he never explained
[59:51] it but he went down with them and came
[59:54] to Nazareth and was subject unto them
[59:56] but his mother kept all these sayings in
[59:58] her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom
[1:00:01] and stature and in favor with God and
[1:00:03] man without the holy spirit in him this
[1:00:06] is a child of God this is a Son of God
[1:00:08] continually growing and maturing gaining
[1:00:11] favor with the people around him and
[1:00:13] with God and yet without the Holy Ghost
[1:00:16] how obedience to the word purely
[1:00:19] obedience to the word but I want to
[1:00:21] focus on that phrase the father's
[1:00:23] business because this is a theme that
[1:00:24] comes up time and time again with Jesus
[1:00:27] and we know he was the firstborn of me
[1:00:29] many Brethren he's the first of many
[1:00:30] he's the first of the rest of us and so
[1:00:33] when people come to to godhead people
[1:00:35] say well Jesus speaks of his father and
[1:00:37] that's obviously two separate people but
[1:00:39] you have to remember there is a flesh
[1:00:41] man there's a flesh man there and that
[1:00:43] is Jesus the flesh man that was born and
[1:00:45] that man had a nature and a personality
[1:00:47] just like you and I he was just like
[1:00:49] Adam in the garden he had a personality
[1:00:52] he had a mind he could choose he could
[1:00:54] do all these things he was born sinless
[1:00:56] which is why he's called the second Adam
[1:00:58] and so he wasn't tainted by sin but he
[1:00:59] was surrounded by sin and he was
[1:01:01] surrounded by Temptation yet he never
[1:01:03] gave into it he was as human as you or I
[1:01:06] but he was not in sinless in sinful
[1:01:08] flesh he was in sinless flesh amen and
[1:01:11] up until the Jordan of river experience
[1:01:14] he was he was a Son of God but he was
[1:01:16] not the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:01:18] cuz God was not yet dwelling in him it
[1:01:20] was a body
[1:01:21] prepared it was a body prepared the
[1:01:24] scripture says we're no different were a
[1:01:26] body prepared amen a body as th prepared
[1:01:29] me and then we see a Jordan what happens
[1:01:31] is the holy spirit comes into him and
[1:01:33] what is it that's the fullness now of
[1:01:34] God dwelling in a body he was born the
[1:01:37] Son of God just as you and I were born
[1:01:39] the Son of God but he was not placed as
[1:01:41] the Son of God until
[1:01:43] Jordan why because the Son of God had to
[1:01:46] have the spirit of God inside of him
[1:01:47] that was his placing that was his his
[1:01:49] recognition in terms of of who he was
[1:01:52] amen but the same up to that point he
[1:01:54] was the same as you and I before the new
[1:01:56] birth he overcame purely by staying with
[1:01:59] the word he had no Supernatural power or
[1:02:01] authority granted to him amen and even
[1:02:03] at the tender age of 12 years old he was
[1:02:05] confounding the the scholars in the in
[1:02:07] the church you know it's interesting
[1:02:09] when when my wife and I or my wife and
[1:02:11] kids went to California Jonathan was
[1:02:13] confounding
[1:02:15] them because he was talk they were
[1:02:16] talking about the Holy Ghost on the day
[1:02:18] of Pentecost and you know that was for
[1:02:20] that day and Jonathan saidwell what
[1:02:21] about the Scripture it says it's for you
[1:02:23] and your children as many as the Lord
[1:02:24] Our God shall call and they saidwell
[1:02:27] we just don't believe that it confounds
[1:02:30] them not because we're great
[1:02:33] intellectuals but because we have a full
[1:02:35] word that's been open to us and it is so
[1:02:37] simple to us it is so simple to us the
[1:02:39] things that we believe that even a child
[1:02:42] even a child being well taught by a
[1:02:44] family at home and by our Sunday school
[1:02:46] teacher and the ministry here and these
[1:02:47] different things can go out and can
[1:02:49] confound the wise of this world with the
[1:02:51] Simplicity of the doctrine that we
[1:02:53] believe amen
[1:02:57] but I thought it was so beautiful that
[1:02:58] Jesus said I've got to be about the
[1:02:59] father's business he says I've got to be
[1:03:01] who I really am and he came up to the
[1:03:04] place where he was going to show that
[1:03:05] all that God had made him for you know
[1:03:08] we've got to find the same place in our
[1:03:09] own lives we've got to find what's God's
[1:03:11] will for us and everything that Jesus
[1:03:14] did was building up to what is the
[1:03:15] Father's will for me that's all he was
[1:03:17] focused on and he knew that if he stayed
[1:03:20] with the word his purpose would come to
[1:03:21] him his time would come to him the
[1:03:24] revealing of of the plan of God for him
[1:03:26] all of these things was being revealed
[1:03:28] in him as he studied the scriptures and
[1:03:29] as he stayed with him the word of God
[1:03:31] started to come to fruition and we've
[1:03:34] got to we've got to handle it the same
[1:03:35] way amen we've got to be able to trust
[1:03:37] that we are where God places us with
[1:03:40] purpose that we're just not sitting here
[1:03:42] that we're not just in Newan land we're
[1:03:45] not just in Newan land we're not just
[1:03:46] sitting in this church building by
[1:03:48] happen stance or by our choice but it's
[1:03:50] because God has placed us where we're
[1:03:51] supposed to be you know I look back at
[1:03:53] my own life and there are times and
[1:03:55] places I thought why am I here or why am
[1:03:58] I still here cuz it made no sense you
[1:04:02] know maybe Ministry were have fallen off
[1:04:03] you most of you know what happened in
[1:04:05] Texas we had no Pastor for a year and
[1:04:07] you're sitting there and you're you're
[1:04:08] trying to keep things together and you
[1:04:10] don't have a regular Ministry and the
[1:04:12] church is fracturing and falling apart
[1:04:13] what's the point of staying in there but
[1:04:15] I had to get a crash course in
[1:04:18] Ministry CU I only had 16 years to
[1:04:20] prepare to come back here and so God
[1:04:23] gave me a crash course in Ministry in
[1:04:25] church
[1:04:26] in Clicks in
[1:04:28] gifts in in men that got ahead of
[1:04:31] themselves and men that took too much on
[1:04:32] themselves youth versus age you know
[1:04:35] older age all these different things and
[1:04:37] I had to learn above all else that God's
[1:04:39] word takes preeminence because I had
[1:04:42] multiple situations and I had to humble
[1:04:45] myself and say the reason that this
[1:04:47] situation could get as far as it did is
[1:04:49] because I put the person I put the gift
[1:04:51] I put the ministry I put their feelings
[1:04:53] I put respect over the word of God and
[1:04:57] that's a humbling experience especially
[1:05:00] when your family has to get dragged
[1:05:01] through something and it's because you
[1:05:04] me I'm talking about me because I didn't
[1:05:07] hold the word in its full preeminence
[1:05:09] and God had to do that to me a number of
[1:05:11] times just to get me to say all right I
[1:05:13] get it stay with the word above all else
[1:05:16] and I have had the privilege of meeting
[1:05:17] some wonderful men with some wonderful
[1:05:19] gifts and there's not a single one of
[1:05:21] them that gets to act above the word of
[1:05:22] God in my life now and I say that with
[1:05:24] all all humility and all honor to those
[1:05:27] men but the word of God takes
[1:05:28] preeminence and I don't care how great
[1:05:30] your ministry is I don't care how great
[1:05:31] your church is I don't care if you can
[1:05:33] see visions and dreams I don't care if
[1:05:34] you've got a direct line to the throne
[1:05:36] of God if it doesn't match up with this
[1:05:38] it does not matter balam had a direct
[1:05:41] line to the throne of God and look what
[1:05:43] happened to him Judas had it too
[1:05:45] Caiaphas had it at one point as well all
[1:05:48] false anointed ones
[1:05:51] amen Jesus spent the first 30 years of
[1:05:54] his life putting the word of God first
[1:05:56] and we have no indication what his life
[1:05:57] looked like we have no idea what that
[1:06:00] looked like but we know it wasn't easy
[1:06:01] because he looked 50 by the time he was
[1:06:05] 33 he had a tough life he had a rough
[1:06:07] life he had a rough
[1:06:08] upbringing but look at Philippians 2 it
[1:06:11] says let this mind being in you which
[1:06:13] also was in Christ Jesus who being in
[1:06:15] the form of God thought it not robbery
[1:06:18] to be equal with God now that's a
[1:06:20] mouthful and we're supposed to have the
[1:06:22] same mindset Paul says he says let this
[1:06:25] I'm being you he didn't think of robbery
[1:06:28] to be equal with God he says you
[1:06:29] shouldn't think the same thing either
[1:06:31] we'll hit this in another service it
[1:06:32] take us too long to go through it
[1:06:33] tonight it says but in that Revelation
[1:06:37] he made himself of no reputation and
[1:06:40] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:06:43] was made in the likeness of man and
[1:06:45] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:06:47] humbled himself I guarantee you in those
[1:06:50] 30 years he learned to Humble himself a
[1:06:52] great deal it says and he became
[1:06:54] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:06:57] the Cross now brother BR would say this
[1:06:59] he says now watch what God did when his
[1:07:02] son was born he let him go for 30 years
[1:07:05] testing him and trying him what was he
[1:07:08] doing preparing him for his role as the
[1:07:12] Son of God preparing him for his role as
[1:07:15] the expressed image of God as the
[1:07:16] fullness of the godhead bodily preparing
[1:07:18] for his ministry preparing for him to
[1:07:20] redeem the world preparing to step into
[1:07:22] his ordained position but what did those
[1:07:24] 30 years look like
[1:07:26] we this scripture is silent
[1:07:28] specifically but we know that Paul
[1:07:31] talked to Timothy as a Young Man
[1:07:33] preparing and Timothy became the bishop
[1:07:35] he became the pastor in Ephesus as we
[1:07:37] know and Paul prepared Timothy for his
[1:07:39] ministry and Paul or Timothy was just a
[1:07:41] young man but Paul knew God had a plan
[1:07:43] for Timothy had been revealed to Paul
[1:07:45] what Timothy was going to do and so he
[1:07:47] was constantly encouraging Timothy to
[1:07:49] prepare for what's coming your way and
[1:07:52] we see in 1 Timothy 4 remember the
[1:07:54] scriptures given to show us insight into
[1:07:56] all things and you say we don't know
[1:07:58] what happened to Jesus but we know what
[1:08:00] the what the word says that other young
[1:08:01] men were supposed to do in preparation
[1:08:03] for Ministry I believe this is insight
[1:08:05] into what Jesus life looked like and I
[1:08:08] believe it Bears witness based on the
[1:08:09] scriptures we've already read Paul told
[1:08:11] Timothy he says let no man despise thy
[1:08:13] youth I preached on this many times you
[1:08:16] know the young people will say you can't
[1:08:18] look down on me as I'm as a young person
[1:08:21] the scripture says you can't despise me
[1:08:22] because of my age but how many of them
[1:08:25] will repeat the rest of the
[1:08:26] Scripture it says but be thou an example
[1:08:29] of the Believers that's why you they are
[1:08:32] not supposed to look down on your
[1:08:33] despise your age is because you're an
[1:08:35] example of the Believers how in word in
[1:08:39] conversation that means in living in
[1:08:41] charity in spirit in faith and in Purity
[1:08:46] so Paul told Timothy he said be an
[1:08:47] example of a Believer to the Believers
[1:08:51] that's how you prepare to become a
[1:08:52] minister is you live the life
[1:08:56] before you ever take authority behind a
[1:08:57] Pulpit you've got to prove yourself
[1:08:59] first respect is earned it's not given
[1:09:03] you don't take it they have to give it
[1:09:05] and you have to earn it and how long
[1:09:07] does Timothy have to do this till I come
[1:09:09] Paul says give attendence to reading to
[1:09:13] exhortation and to Doctrine young people
[1:09:15] don't ever let anybody tell you you
[1:09:17] don't have to know your Bible that you
[1:09:19] don't have to know what you believe and
[1:09:20] why you believe it you need to have an
[1:09:22] anchor and a foundation in the
[1:09:23] scriptures that everything you do is
[1:09:25] according to the word of God absolutely
[1:09:27] amen and everything that we preach we
[1:09:29] ought to be able to preach directly from
[1:09:31] these pages I shouldn't need quotes to
[1:09:33] preach anything that we believe because
[1:09:35] it's the word of God revealed amen it's
[1:09:37] an open word to us now amen like I said
[1:09:40] before some of our older kids can
[1:09:42] confound those Selena has had many
[1:09:44] discussions I know at work and these
[1:09:46] different things with with co-workers
[1:09:48] and and the Simplicity of the Gospel we
[1:09:49] believe staggers people but it's also
[1:09:52] the Simplicity of how we believe we
[1:09:54] literally just believe and if you don't
[1:09:56] like it that's fine if you like it it's
[1:09:58] fine if you agree disagree that's okay
[1:10:01] we're not combative about it why because
[1:10:03] if you don't want it you don't have to
[1:10:05] have it but we've got it and it's done a
[1:10:07] work in our lives and so we'll hold on
[1:10:08] to it amen so I believe this is what
[1:10:11] Jesus life looked like and we see that
[1:10:13] because the scripture says he grew in
[1:10:14] wisdom and stature and in favor with God
[1:10:16] in Man how he proved himself as a Young
[1:10:20] Man showed himself to be a real Son of
[1:10:23] God Amen he was about the father's
[1:10:25] business business he was getting ready
[1:10:26] to fully Express what God had for him
[1:10:28] amen and it was a great mystery in his
[1:10:30] day and almost everyone missed it can
[1:10:32] you imagine those that got saved on the
[1:10:35] day of Pentecost when they realized they
[1:10:37] missed the opportunity to have a
[1:10:39] conversation with the word made flesh
[1:10:42] with their lord and savior their God
[1:10:46] that he walked amongst them and they
[1:10:47] crucified him what a shame most miss it
[1:10:51] most miss it but what Grace do we have
[1:10:53] what Mercy do we have that if we miss it
[1:10:55] yet he can still reveal it to True
[1:10:56] children
[1:10:57] amen but what a lost opportunity if we
[1:11:00] don't realize what's going on all around
[1:11:01] us they had all sorts of signs with
[1:11:03] Jesus he said look if you don't believe
[1:11:05] my words at least look at the works I do
[1:11:06] because they testify of me never a man's
[1:11:09] done what this man's doing but yet they
[1:11:11] missed it all but we see even what
[1:11:13] happened with them at the River Jordan
[1:11:15] and Mark 1 talks about it says and it
[1:11:17] came to pass in those days that Jesus
[1:11:20] came from Nazareth of Galilee and was
[1:11:22] baptized of John and Jordan and
[1:11:24] straightway come up out of the water he
[1:11:26] saw the heavens opened and a spirit like
[1:11:28] a dove descending upon him and there
[1:11:31] came a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art
[1:11:33] my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:11:36] pleased and the immediately the spirit
[1:11:39] driveth him into the Wilderness now I
[1:11:42] want to focus on verse 11 here quickly
[1:11:44] because this is a bit of a point of
[1:11:46] contention for many people including
[1:11:48] those inside this end time message
[1:11:50] because the phrasing there says that I
[1:11:52] am well pleased and we're taught that
[1:11:54] when God God says he's pleased with you
[1:11:56] that is the time of
[1:11:58] adoption but the time of adoption is not
[1:12:00] when he says he's pleased the time of
[1:12:02] adoption is when he takes you out for a
[1:12:03] ceremony because God is pleased with us
[1:12:05] throughout our lives as we come in
[1:12:07] alignment with his word as we submit
[1:12:09] ourselves to his word as we act on his
[1:12:11] word as we believe on his word that's
[1:12:13] pleasing to God but there's a time where
[1:12:15] he says I'm pleased enough I come to a
[1:12:17] place where I believe you're ready to be
[1:12:19] adopted amen and it would seem like this
[1:12:21] is the place of adoption where the
[1:12:23] father says you've met my requirement
[1:12:25] I'll adopt you and place you
[1:12:27] positionally but there's just a problem
[1:12:30] this is not the only time God says I'm
[1:12:32] well pleased and he says it later and he
[1:12:35] adds a phrase to it that shows adoption
[1:12:38] versus just pleasing God Amen and it's
[1:12:41] in a completely different circumstance
[1:12:43] under with a completely different aspect
[1:12:46] to it so watch how the prophet of God
[1:12:48] phrases it we we started this quote and
[1:12:50] I'm reading the next bit and then I'll
[1:12:51] read the next bit a little bit later he
[1:12:53] says now watch what God did when his son
[1:12:55] was born he let him go 30 years testing
[1:12:57] him trying him he says then he gave him
[1:13:00] 3 years of hard trial so it was tough
[1:13:04] for the first 30 but now he he ratchets
[1:13:07] up the pressure he makes things even
[1:13:08] more difficult why because he's got to
[1:13:10] know if that son can hold up to what's
[1:13:13] coming his way cuz the ultimate test is
[1:13:16] going to be to lay down your
[1:13:17] life to lay down your money to lay down
[1:13:21] your health to lay down your influence
[1:13:24] lay down whatever it is is that you
[1:13:25] value most the challenge is will you lay
[1:13:28] it down or will you rear up and use what
[1:13:31] God's given you to to preserve
[1:13:34] yourself
[1:13:36] amen he was pleased in Jesus enough to
[1:13:38] dwell in him but Jesus hasn't been fully
[1:13:42] proven and we know that because verse 12
[1:13:45] says immediately the spirit driveth him
[1:13:47] into the Wilderness that word driveth
[1:13:49] means cast out expel in other words the
[1:13:52] spirit of God in Jesus forcibly took out
[1:13:55] into the desert for 40 days why to test
[1:14:00] him if the son is adopted why is he
[1:14:03] still being tested you can't be adopted
[1:14:06] and tested in that way adoption is after
[1:14:08] the testing doesn't mean you won't have
[1:14:10] trials and and difficult times but
[1:14:12] adoption is after you've proven yourself
[1:14:15] and here's the thing Jesus now is the
[1:14:17] fullness of the godhead
[1:14:18] bodily amen the spirit of God is in him
[1:14:22] without measure now he's got power
[1:14:26] the Holy Ghost is power remember Jesus
[1:14:28] said you had he told them the disciples
[1:14:31] he says go and wait until you be indued
[1:14:33] with power the Holy Ghost is power and
[1:14:37] it's authority Jesus now has been gone
[1:14:40] stay Stayed faithful to the word for 30
[1:14:43] years but he had no Authority he had no
[1:14:46] power but now the Holy Ghost comes on
[1:14:48] him without measure now he has power and
[1:14:51] what has to happen with power character
[1:14:53] has to be proven amen so what happens
[1:14:57] God gives him power and what's the test
[1:14:59] now what are you going to do with it
[1:15:01] amen and he takes him out in the desert
[1:15:04] and Jesus has to win not by using his
[1:15:07] power Jesus overcomes in the in the
[1:15:10] wilderness by thus saith the Lord it is
[1:15:13] written it is written it is written no
[1:15:15] Supernatural power no Supernatural
[1:15:18] Authority he could have called 10,000
[1:15:20] angels He could have done everything
[1:15:21] that Satan wanted him to do but he
[1:15:23] couldn't do it he had to completely
[1:15:25] defeat him by the word of God remember
[1:15:27] the prophet of God he says the word of
[1:15:29] God will defeat the enemy anywhere
[1:15:32] anytime that's it you stay with the word
[1:15:35] and that'll defeat him but remember what
[1:15:37] were the Temptations from Satan we're
[1:15:38] talking about Jesus coming to adoption
[1:15:41] the first was that he would use his
[1:15:42] power and authority for carnal needs he
[1:15:45] says make these stones into bread
[1:15:48] preserve yourself save your own
[1:15:51] life what did he come do he came to
[1:15:53] minister not to be ministered to brother
[1:15:57] Braham says I can't use my gift on
[1:15:59] myself it's for you it's not for me he
[1:16:02] could lay hands on somebody and God
[1:16:03] would honor the prayer of faith but he
[1:16:05] couldn't lay hands on himself and heal
[1:16:06] his own body why the gift was not for
[1:16:08] him and Jesus knew this gift is not for
[1:16:10] me and he proved it on the first
[1:16:12] Temptation then what did Satan try to do
[1:16:14] he tried to get him to prove who he was
[1:16:17] prove you're the Son of God if you are
[1:16:19] the Son of God then throw yourself down
[1:16:21] off the temple and they'll catch the
[1:16:22] angels will catch you you won't even
[1:16:23] stub your toe any of these things right
[1:16:26] it was to what let your pride respond to
[1:16:30] the challenge of the
[1:16:31] enemy that has nothing to do with it
[1:16:34] prophet of God said God doesn't play
[1:16:36] around God doesn't play around with his
[1:16:38] gifts God doesn't play around with his
[1:16:39] power we're not here to answer Satan's
[1:16:41] challenge we're here to take back our
[1:16:43] land if he's on our land we'll use the
[1:16:45] power and authority of God if he's out
[1:16:47] in his own kingdom leave him alone when
[1:16:49] he comes to us that's when we bug him
[1:16:51] that's when we're a pain in his neck but
[1:16:52] if he's going to stay out there leave
[1:16:54] him be that's not our kingdom that's his
[1:16:56] kingdom and then the third one was what
[1:16:58] he tried to get him to take the easier
[1:17:00] path to achieve his Earthly purpose he
[1:17:02] said if you'll bow and worship me I'll
[1:17:04] give you all the kingdoms I'll give you
[1:17:05] all the people in them you can save the
[1:17:07] world Jesus all you have to do is Bow
[1:17:09] Down and Worship me and Jesus said get
[1:17:12] thee behind me Satan defeated him by the
[1:17:15] word by the word by the word it is
[1:17:18] written it is written it is also written
[1:17:21] because remember Satan will use the word
[1:17:23] but he won't never use the full word
[1:17:24] because the full word will expose him
[1:17:26] every single time it'll expose the
[1:17:28] spirit that's behind him amen but we
[1:17:31] come back to this phrase of the father's
[1:17:32] business and Jesus has been preparing
[1:17:35] for it and now he's ready for it and
[1:17:36] he's passed his last test and you would
[1:17:38] say well then obviously he's ready to be
[1:17:40] adopted he's shown his character no now
[1:17:43] he's got to go use it according to the
[1:17:45] father's will he's proven he won't use
[1:17:47] it for himself but will he use it
[1:17:49] according to the father's will as he
[1:17:51] goes out there brother Brown would say
[1:17:53] this he says we find immediately after
[1:17:54] his temptation he went straight to the
[1:17:57] father's business he says what was the
[1:17:59] business preaching the gospel and
[1:18:01] Healing The Sick remember the scripture
[1:18:03] says where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:18:05] there is Liberty Jesus had to go fulfill
[1:18:07] Isaiah
[1:18:08] 61 he had to do that that was part of
[1:18:11] the father's business but that was not
[1:18:13] his adopted position that's what a Son
[1:18:15] of God will do but that is not what the
[1:18:17] Son of God had to do it was just a
[1:18:19] portion of his ministry and he comes out
[1:18:21] of the desert and and and he immediately
[1:18:23] goes and and he turns the water into
[1:18:25] wine and then he goes and he heals the
[1:18:27] the dead boy of the Widow of Na and then
[1:18:29] he's going around and he goes and and
[1:18:31] and he goes into complete crowds of sick
[1:18:33] people and every single one of them are
[1:18:35] healed and demons are cast out and all
[1:18:37] these different things and the thing is
[1:18:39] that we look at that and we say well
[1:18:40] that's the actions of an adopted son of
[1:18:42] God no those are the actions of a Son of
[1:18:46] God see we lost it all Adam had all of
[1:18:50] that before we ever were here before sin
[1:18:53] ever came Adam could control control
[1:18:55] everything on this Earth and all Christ
[1:18:56] was doing was proving he was the second
[1:18:58] Adam he was proving who he was but he
[1:19:00] wasn't in his full position it was just
[1:19:02] a portion of his ministry he came to
[1:19:04] fulfill the word that was written about
[1:19:06] him for that time so he had to fulfill
[1:19:08] Isaiah 61 amen he had to come and and
[1:19:11] Free People from from prison he had to
[1:19:13] come and bind up the Brokenhearted he
[1:19:15] had to preach to the meek he had to do
[1:19:16] all these different things because that
[1:19:18] was a portion of the word written about
[1:19:20] him but that was not his ultimate goal
[1:19:22] that was not his ultimate reason and if
[1:19:24] that is the position of an adopted son
[1:19:26] then what do we do with the fact that
[1:19:28] the the the disciples did all of those
[1:19:29] works as well before the day of
[1:19:32] Pentecost they went out and they cast
[1:19:34] out demons and they healed the sick
[1:19:35] great signs and wonders following them
[1:19:38] before they were even converted Judas
[1:19:41] did it so the signs and wonders are not
[1:19:44] the proof of an adopted son of God it's
[1:19:46] proof of faith in the word of God and
[1:19:48] it's that simple because you will see
[1:19:50] false anointed ones that can operate the
[1:19:52] word of God by faith and God honors
[1:19:55] faith God honors Faith it's that simple
[1:19:58] you may not be a child of God but if you
[1:20:00] take him at his word he'll honor your
[1:20:01] faith and we'll see that in scripture
[1:20:04] but remember what Jesus said in Matthew
[1:20:06] 7 he says wherefore by their fruits you
[1:20:08] shall know them remember he told his
[1:20:10] disciples he says I've ordained you that
[1:20:12] you will have fruits and they'll
[1:20:14] remain it's a continuous thing it's a
[1:20:17] constant thing amen the Holy Ghost
[1:20:19] doesn't come and go you've got the
[1:20:21] fruits of the spirit all the time
[1:20:22] because the holy spirit's in you it's
[1:20:24] not just in church it's easy to be a
[1:20:27] Christian here it's a lot harder to be a
[1:20:29] Christian out there amen he says by
[1:20:32] their fruits you shall know them and not
[1:20:34] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[1:20:36] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:20:37] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:20:40] which is in heaven remember he's
[1:20:41] revealed to his children the mystery of
[1:20:43] his
[1:20:44] will it says many will say to me in that
[1:20:47] day many a lot most Lord Lord have we
[1:20:51] not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[1:20:54] name cast out devils and in thy name
[1:20:56] done many wonderful works and he doesn't
[1:20:58] say no you didn't he just says then will
[1:21:01] I profess unto them I never knew you
[1:21:04] depart from me ye that work iniquity I
[1:21:07] loved how brother Andrew did it when he
[1:21:08] was here and he says there's a
[1:21:10] difference between meeting somebody and
[1:21:12] knowing somebody and he talked to
[1:21:13] brother Chad and he went up to brother
[1:21:15] Chad he said brother Chad do you know me
[1:21:16] well he says I met you what's your name
[1:21:18] Andrew what do you do you're a minister
[1:21:20] he says what else do I do I don't know
[1:21:21] how many kids do I have I don't know why
[1:21:23] cuz you don't know me
[1:21:25] and I don't know you that's the way it
[1:21:27] is with Christ see they'll take only the
[1:21:29] one element that they want and they
[1:21:31] forget about the entire relationship
[1:21:33] that's supposed to be coming in behind
[1:21:34] it and they're about their will their
[1:21:37] plan their purpose their gain their
[1:21:39] influence their Kingdom rather than the
[1:21:41] will of God Jesus says I never knew you
[1:21:44] I was never intimate with you we never
[1:21:45] had a relationship you just came and
[1:21:48] took what you wanted from this Kingdom
[1:21:50] and you went out and you abused it for
[1:21:51] your own sake you can put Judas there
[1:21:54] like I said you can put balam in this
[1:21:56] scripture you can put Caiaphas the high
[1:21:58] priest that
[1:22:00] prophesied accurately prophesied under
[1:22:02] the spirit and that was because he was
[1:22:05] in the high priest position a false
[1:22:07] anointed unsanctified vessel yet truly
[1:22:11] the spirit of God was on him but not in
[1:22:14] him remember the rain falls on the just
[1:22:16] and the unjust we can come in under the
[1:22:18] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and there
[1:22:20] can be signs and wonders and prophecies
[1:22:22] and tongues and interpretation all of
[1:22:24] these different different things and
[1:22:25] that does not make you a
[1:22:27] Christian what makes you a Christian is
[1:22:29] that you've got a life that is according
[1:22:31] to the word of God
[1:22:34] Amen he continues he says notice him now
[1:22:37] the first thing he begin when he come
[1:22:38] out of the Wilderness he began to preach
[1:22:40] and to pray and heal the sick that's
[1:22:42] right he began with a great ministry of
[1:22:44] healing and not just Healing The Sick
[1:22:47] many people begin to come to him and he
[1:22:48] would pray and lay hands on them and
[1:22:50] they get well great things were
[1:22:52] accomplished in his ministry he came to
[1:22:55] minister but that was not his adopted
[1:22:57] position and for three years Jesus does
[1:23:00] this for three years he focuses on the
[1:23:02] service part of his ministry because he
[1:23:04] didn't just come to redeem our souls
[1:23:05] like I said he came to set the captives
[1:23:07] free to mend the Brokenhearted to preach
[1:23:09] Good Tidings to the meek there is all
[1:23:11] these scriptures that he had to fulfill
[1:23:13] before he comes into his adopted
[1:23:15] position but I want you to understand
[1:23:17] that being about the father's business
[1:23:19] does not mean you're adopted it means
[1:23:22] you're ready to be adopted it's a pre
[1:23:24] cursor to being adopted because you've
[1:23:26] got to prove yourself in the little
[1:23:28] things before he can give you the big
[1:23:29] things and to be in the little things
[1:23:31] you still have to be about the father's
[1:23:33] business you've still got to be showing
[1:23:35] yourself faithful to what he's asked you
[1:23:36] to do because adoption is placing you
[1:23:38] into a role of higher authority and
[1:23:40] higher responsibility but leading up to
[1:23:43] that you've got places of lower
[1:23:44] Authority and lower
[1:23:46] responsibility remember God will give
[1:23:48] you a little
[1:23:50] thing to see what you'll do with it and
[1:23:52] if you're Pro faithful in the little
[1:23:54] thing
[1:23:55] then he says he'll give you more
[1:23:56] adoption is the more but as a child of
[1:23:59] God he'll give you the little things and
[1:24:00] if you abuse it he'll just let you go
[1:24:02] with that and you'll never come to a
[1:24:03] higher
[1:24:05] level amen a son in those days could be
[1:24:08] a helper around the the farm he could be
[1:24:10] a stable helper a laborer he might even
[1:24:12] manage a small group of of men or
[1:24:14] laborers or something like that but to
[1:24:15] run the whole family business he had to
[1:24:17] prove himself in a lower role before he
[1:24:19] got the big role brother BR puts it this
[1:24:22] way he says but what if the child was a
[1:24:23] good child
[1:24:25] what if the child was just about the
[1:24:26] father's business then oh how gracious
[1:24:29] the tutor was he'd come he' say oh kind
[1:24:31] sir your child is just a chip off the
[1:24:33] old block he's just like you he's just
[1:24:36] he's only about your business you'll
[1:24:39] never find a better businessman for your
[1:24:40] kingdom here than that child and how the
[1:24:42] father must swell up and say oh that's
[1:24:44] my boy oh yes he's my son he said that
[1:24:47] to
[1:24:48] Jesus he says but how about that holy
[1:24:51] spirit standing in the presence of God
[1:24:52] and says this man he is a real son he's
[1:24:55] about your business he's not adopted but
[1:24:58] yet he's about your business he says so
[1:25:00] how do we say we're about his business
[1:25:02] this is his program preach the word
[1:25:06] preach means to speak and
[1:25:08] demonstrate in other words live it don't
[1:25:11] just talk it amen he says if I be lifted
[1:25:14] up I draw all men to me how that he must
[1:25:17] feel great and feel happy so a good son
[1:25:21] is already working in the father's
[1:25:22] business before he's adopted
[1:25:25] why he's proving himself faithful in the
[1:25:27] little things amen that's where the
[1:25:29] greatest testing and trying is amen
[1:25:31] because you remember he's been under
[1:25:32] tutors and they've been teaching him and
[1:25:34] giving him all this knowledge but now
[1:25:36] he's got to put all that knowledge into
[1:25:37] practice and prove he's got wisdom not
[1:25:40] just knowledge he's got to have
[1:25:42] understanding not just facts and data
[1:25:44] and these different things he's got to
[1:25:45] be able to take it and put it to use in
[1:25:48] the father's
[1:25:49] business now remember what Moses
[1:25:51] said Deuteronomy 18 Moses said this he
[1:25:55] says the Lord thy God shall raise up
[1:25:57] unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[1:25:58] thee of thy Brethren like unto
[1:26:01] me and then it has the semicolon there
[1:26:05] right a period of time and then it says
[1:26:09] like unto him shall you hearken so he's
[1:26:12] going to raise up a prophet like unto
[1:26:13] Moses and it's going to be for a period
[1:26:15] of time and then you're going to hear
[1:26:18] him in other words he's the one you're
[1:26:20] going to have to
[1:26:22] heed so we take that back to the
[1:26:24] scripture then we see that Jesus has a
[1:26:26] three-year Ministry proving he was the
[1:26:28] Fulfillment of Deuteronomy 18:15 he
[1:26:30] proved he was a prophet like unto Moses
[1:26:33] but he wasn't like unto Moses because a
[1:26:35] greater than Solomon is here a greater
[1:26:37] than Moses is here Moses as we said last
[1:26:39] service he failed in the Temptation when
[1:26:41] his temper got the better of him and he
[1:26:43] struck the rock twice instead of
[1:26:45] speaking to it for the water to come out
[1:26:47] and what did he do he elevated himself
[1:26:49] into God's position he took glory to
[1:26:51] himself and Aaron did as well and God
[1:26:53] says because you didn't glorify me
[1:26:55] before the people you can't go into the
[1:26:57] land
[1:26:59] amen Moses had Authority as a prophet
[1:27:01] and what did he do he abused it but God
[1:27:04] would not dishonor his prophet in front
[1:27:06] of the people but he judged them
[1:27:10] nonetheless sometimes what happens
[1:27:11] behind scenes is far worse than what
[1:27:13] happens out in front in
[1:27:15] public we see with
[1:27:18] Elisha he's a prophet he's got twice the
[1:27:20] anointing of
[1:27:22] Elijah and those young people come out
[1:27:24] and 42 children make fun of him and they
[1:27:27] make fun of his master Elijah that went
[1:27:29] up in a chariot of fire thou Baldhead
[1:27:32] thou Baldhead go up and in Anger what
[1:27:35] happens is he calls out two she bears
[1:27:37] and they kill them he failed in his
[1:27:39] authority he abused it his temper got
[1:27:43] the better of him Christ had to go there
[1:27:45] and he had to be rejected he had to be
[1:27:48] completely uh humiliated his family
[1:27:51] turned him down the ministry turned him
[1:27:54] down
[1:27:54] down so many turned him down they loved
[1:27:57] the the works but when he started to
[1:27:59] preach the word they all turned away he
[1:28:01] had to be completely rejected and not
[1:28:03] lose his
[1:28:04] temper not use his authority not use his
[1:28:07] power to what do something that would
[1:28:10] satisfy his feelings his human nature if
[1:28:13] I could put it that
[1:28:15] way Moses Authority was nothing compared
[1:28:17] to Jesus Authority and and what was the
[1:28:21] first thing that Satan challenged Jesus
[1:28:23] to do abuse his authority the first
[1:28:25] thing he did abuse it because that's how
[1:28:27] he got Moses and that's how he got so
[1:28:30] many was he had them abuse their power
[1:28:32] that's what he did with David David
[1:28:33] abused his power as king to take another
[1:28:35] man's wife he did it because he could do
[1:28:38] it and that's the challenge for every
[1:28:40] Son of God every daughter of God is what
[1:28:42] will you do with what God gives you will
[1:28:44] you use it for yourself will you use it
[1:28:46] to put people down we use it we can call
[1:28:49] judgment don't think for a second that
[1:28:51] we can't call judgment if they did in
[1:28:53] the old Testament there's no reason we
[1:28:55] can't do it here but what ought our
[1:28:56] response to be forgive them Father they
[1:28:59] know not what they do while there's
[1:29:01] Mercy let's offer Mercy to every single
[1:29:03] one amen but Jesus had to walk around
[1:29:05] for three years of hard trial scorned
[1:29:08] rejected harassed
[1:29:10] unappreciated how frustrating must that
[1:29:12] be the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:29:14] and nobody appreciates what you're doing
[1:29:16] you go and you heal people by the
[1:29:18] thousands maybe the tens of thousands
[1:29:20] for all we know and in the end they walk
[1:29:23] away
[1:29:25] and then what did God do
[1:29:27] though he saw that that body was subject
[1:29:31] to the
[1:29:32] spirit and it proved itself and it had
[1:29:34] humbled itself and it had surrendered
[1:29:36] itself and we see in Mark 9 the response
[1:29:39] it says and he said unto them Jesus
[1:29:41] speaking says verily I say unto you that
[1:29:43] there shall be some of them that stand
[1:29:44] here which shall not taste of death
[1:29:46] until they have seen the kingdom of God
[1:29:49] come with power now what is the kingdom
[1:29:52] of God we've said this before Jesus said
[1:29:54] to Nicodemus he said the kingdom of God
[1:29:56] is within you it's the Holy Ghost it's
[1:29:58] the new birth amen it is literally the
[1:30:01] life of God producing a life of the word
[1:30:03] of the hour inside of a human body it is
[1:30:06] God in surrendered unselfish humble
[1:30:09] human flesh that's what the kingdom of
[1:30:11] God is in power and it says after six
[1:30:14] days Jesus taketh with him Peter James
[1:30:16] and John and leadth them up unto an high
[1:30:18] mountain apart by themselves now I'm
[1:30:20] going to jump over to Matthew 17 because
[1:30:22] it gives us more detail than the other
[1:30:24] Gospels it says and he was transfigured
[1:30:26] before them and his face did shine as
[1:30:28] the sun and his reignment was white as
[1:30:30] the light and behold there appeared unto
[1:30:32] them Moses and Elijah talking with him
[1:30:34] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[1:30:36] Lord it is good for us to be here if
[1:30:39] thou Wilt let us make here three
[1:30:40] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[1:30:42] one for Elias and while he yet spake
[1:30:46] Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them
[1:30:49] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:30:51] which said this is my beloved Son in
[1:30:53] whom I am well pleased we've heard that
[1:30:56] before in the River Jordan When the
[1:30:57] Spirit came down but now it says hear ye
[1:31:01] him remember what Moses said he says
[1:31:04] there's going to be a prophet like unto
[1:31:05] me unto him will ye hearken here's the
[1:31:08] Bible saying hearken unto him hear him
[1:31:11] listen to what he says now amen so
[1:31:14] adoption is not just receiving the Holy
[1:31:17] Ghost it can't be else God would have
[1:31:20] what not held back some Authority from
[1:31:22] Jesus but we see here he held back some
[1:31:25] Authority he didn't say hear ye him at
[1:31:27] Jordan he said hear ye him after three
[1:31:29] more years of even harder testing and
[1:31:31] trying and proving and only then did he
[1:31:34] say he speaks for me that's the only
[1:31:37] time he could do it why because there
[1:31:39] was a perfect tested Unity
[1:31:43] there I and my father are one I do
[1:31:46] nothing except the father shows me will
[1:31:48] my meat is to do my father's will he was
[1:31:50] perfectly surrendered to the spirit of
[1:31:52] God inside of him amen and what did God
[1:31:54] say God said he speaks for me whatever
[1:31:56] he says I'll back it up whatever he says
[1:31:58] I'll do whatever he says is right
[1:32:01] whatever he says is the word why because
[1:32:03] the word was there the word was made
[1:32:04] flesh and the word could only speak the
[1:32:06] word we know these things he says I'm in
[1:32:09] him he's fully surrendered he speaks for
[1:32:11] me listen up brother B puts it this way
[1:32:14] he says and when he came to the place of
[1:32:16] coming of age the father saw the son had
[1:32:20] progressed
[1:32:22] progressed amen and he was a worthy boy
[1:32:24] everything he did was right and he was
[1:32:26] right up with the father's business he
[1:32:29] wanted everything just right for the
[1:32:31] father and he had no selfish
[1:32:34] motives that's a lot see he's given the
[1:32:38] Holy Ghost but he's got to prove how is
[1:32:40] he going to use it so he says he was
[1:32:42] right with the father's business he
[1:32:44] wanted everything just right for the
[1:32:45] father and he had no selfish motives
[1:32:48] then the father took the son out into a
[1:32:50] public place and the father took the
[1:32:52] very son that was born in his family and
[1:32:54] adopted his own son that's what
[1:32:55] Ephesians said we're adopted
[1:32:57] predestinated to the adoption of sons by
[1:32:59] Christ in other words he adopted him he
[1:33:02] placed his son positionally how did he
[1:33:05] do it he says then that son's name on
[1:33:07] the check was just as good as the
[1:33:09] fathers because he was in
[1:33:13] position the father had Vindicated and
[1:33:15] had placed that son in position he says
[1:33:18] I hope you're getting this and then that
[1:33:20] son was an heir of what the father had
[1:33:22] and we are what God has we're joint airs
[1:33:25] with Christ if we are sons of God
[1:33:27] positionally placed in the kingdom and
[1:33:30] holding our places holding our places I
[1:33:33] can't be in yours and you can't be in
[1:33:35] mine but we've got to be in our places
[1:33:37] he says now watch what God did now he's
[1:33:39] speaking about what happened on Mount
[1:33:41] Transfiguration when his son was born he
[1:33:43] let him go 30 years testing him trying
[1:33:45] him this is the quote I've read twice
[1:33:46] but I'm opening it up each time then he
[1:33:48] gave him three years of hard trial and
[1:33:50] then at the end of the hard trial when
[1:33:52] he saw his son was about the father's
[1:33:54] business Mount Transfiguration The Book
[1:33:56] of Luke he took Peter James and John
[1:33:59] three Witnesses and went up on top of
[1:34:00] the mountain and there God performed the
[1:34:03] laws of adoption they looked up and they
[1:34:05] saw Jesus and his clothes shined as
[1:34:07] white as the lightning and a cloud
[1:34:09] overshadowed him and a voice come out of
[1:34:11] the cloud and said this is my beloved
[1:34:13] Son hear ye him all sit down now and
[1:34:17] have no more to say what he says is Law
[1:34:20] and
[1:34:21] Truth now I'll be honest I've always
[1:34:24] struggled with the idea of what was
[1:34:26] jesus' position of adoption because if
[1:34:27] you look at his actions they look like
[1:34:29] the actions before this of an adopted
[1:34:32] son of God today that's what we would
[1:34:34] expect generally speaking an adopted son
[1:34:37] of God to do was to go and continue the
[1:34:39] works of Christ amen we look at those
[1:34:42] those great signs and wonders he did and
[1:34:44] we say that's what God is doing that's
[1:34:45] what God does in our lives that's what
[1:34:47] adopted sons and gods do but we forget
[1:34:50] that adoption is about positional
[1:34:52] placing it is not about signs and
[1:34:54] wonders it's about being in your
[1:34:57] position and then whatever he wants you
[1:34:59] to do that's what you do which includes
[1:35:02] signs and wonders absolutely 100% but
[1:35:06] don't confuse the signs and wonders with
[1:35:08] being in position again Judas had signs
[1:35:11] and wonders balam had signs and wonders
[1:35:15] so that is not the proof of it the
[1:35:17] disciples had signs and wonders and they
[1:35:18] weren't even converted yet they were
[1:35:20] without the Holy Ghost and denied Christ
[1:35:23] so the signs and wonders is not the
[1:35:24] proof of adoption it can be a part of
[1:35:26] adoption but just because you got signs
[1:35:28] and wonders following does not mean that
[1:35:30] you're a son that you're an adopted
[1:35:32] child of God Amen it's about Authority
[1:35:34] it's not about a public show it's not
[1:35:37] about a public show and you'll see what
[1:35:38] Jesus does is as he comes into this now
[1:35:40] he's just talking to the disciples and
[1:35:42] he pulls them aside and he's telling
[1:35:44] them all the things that are going to
[1:35:45] happen he's not telling it to the rest
[1:35:46] of the world he's only telling it to his
[1:35:48] children he's only telling it to the
[1:35:50] elect
[1:35:51] amen so signs and one ERS can be a a
[1:35:55] sign of an adopted son and daughter of
[1:35:57] God but it's not definitive amen we
[1:35:59] don't want to throw those things out of
[1:36:00] course we don't we want everything God
[1:36:02] has for us if I'm in Christ I want
[1:36:04] everything that Christ has for me in my
[1:36:05] position but I want to be in my position
[1:36:07] more than I want to have those things
[1:36:09] because that's where I can be a blessing
[1:36:11] that's where I can be of of good to the
[1:36:12] kingdom of God he says then he takes him
[1:36:15] out to a certain place the father does
[1:36:17] and he sets him up in a high place like
[1:36:18] this and he has a ceremony and they all
[1:36:20] come around and he said I want everyone
[1:36:22] to know that this is my child and I
[1:36:24] adopt my son and I want anyone to know
[1:36:26] from henceforth that his name I dress
[1:36:28] him up a special dress on him I want you
[1:36:30] to know that his name is just as good on
[1:36:32] any check as my name is he's my child I
[1:36:35] adopt him into my family although he's
[1:36:37] been my son since he was born it doesn't
[1:36:40] change his bloodline but it changes his
[1:36:43] position since he received the Holy
[1:36:46] Ghost he's been my
[1:36:48] son he says but now I'm going to place
[1:36:51] him positionally in Authority what he
[1:36:53] fires is fired and what he hires is
[1:36:56] hired notice he puts a separation
[1:36:58] between receiving the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:01] positional
[1:37:03] placing he says and I'll read this quote
[1:37:06] probably in the next verice brother brah
[1:37:07] says you've got the Holy Ghost but I'm
[1:37:09] talking about adoption he makes it very
[1:37:12] clear that those two are not necessarily
[1:37:13] one and the same they can be as we'll
[1:37:15] see when we go on the scriptures but
[1:37:17] just because you got the Holy Ghost
[1:37:18] doesn't mean you're adopted how could it
[1:37:20] be he goes into a he goes into uh you
[1:37:22] know Macedonia or these different places
[1:37:24] he goes into a place where it's raw
[1:37:26] heathens and they get the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:27] you're telling me that can be an adopted
[1:37:29] son of God how can it they haven't been
[1:37:31] proven to be adopted you've got to be
[1:37:33] proven you've got to be tested you got
[1:37:34] to be tried and you can't hear the word
[1:37:36] one time and that be your proof for
[1:37:37] testing because many follow Jesus until
[1:37:40] the real word came and then they fell
[1:37:41] away it takes a Time adoption requires a
[1:37:45] time of
[1:37:46] proving
[1:37:48] amen but he says what he fires is fired
[1:37:51] and what he hires is hired you want to
[1:37:52] know who has auth in a business they're
[1:37:54] the ones that hire and fire the people
[1:37:57] that just manage that things and manage
[1:37:59] people and situation no no no it's the
[1:38:01] ones that hire and fire those are the
[1:38:03] ones with real Authority that's where
[1:38:04] the buck stops is the ones that bring
[1:38:06] people on and put people out amen so
[1:38:09] it's not just casting out demons and
[1:38:10] Healing The Sick amen this is authority
[1:38:12] to speak and things happen and it's a
[1:38:15] completely different thing amen Judas
[1:38:18] never had
[1:38:19] that but Peter had it John had it and
[1:38:23] Paul had it why adopted sons of God they
[1:38:27] went all the way with the word they
[1:38:29] proved themselves they stayed there
[1:38:31] until they got power and their character
[1:38:33] was proven to use that power
[1:38:34] appropriately amen this isn't just Faith
[1:38:36] now this is Authority because you know
[1:38:39] who you are and that you are where
[1:38:41] you're supposed to be and you're about
[1:38:43] the father's business perfectly amen his
[1:38:46] actions are your actions his words are
[1:38:48] your words his thoughts are your thought
[1:38:50] his will is your will and so when you
[1:38:52] speak it's him speaking it's him
[1:38:53] thinking it's him doing and so what
[1:38:55] happens things move things change that's
[1:38:59] what it means to be an adopted son or
[1:39:01] daughter of God Amen Jesus had all the
[1:39:03] important elements of of an adopted son
[1:39:06] early but that's not adoption adoption
[1:39:08] is when you're placed into position amen
[1:39:11] it's not just being about the father's
[1:39:13] business it's about proving yourself in
[1:39:15] the father's business so he can place
[1:39:16] you in your real position which is in a
[1:39:19] place of authority but I had struggled
[1:39:21] with what is Jesus Authority or what was
[1:39:23] position of authority what was his
[1:39:24] positional placing and I had searched
[1:39:26] the scriptures and it's there in in
[1:39:29] hindsight it seems so obvious but I
[1:39:31] searched a message and and brother brand
[1:39:33] would say time and time again that he
[1:39:34] adopted him on Mount Transfiguration but
[1:39:36] adoption is always positional placing
[1:39:38] and my question was what is the
[1:39:40] positional place then what was different
[1:39:43] about Christ after the mount
[1:39:44] Transfiguration than before what
[1:39:47] Authority did he have but after that he
[1:39:48] didn't have before I came across this
[1:39:51] quote And as far as I know it's the only
[1:39:53] one where explains this it says but
[1:39:56] before Peter got through speaking about
[1:39:58] those three different
[1:39:59] Tabernacles you notice God wouldn't let
[1:40:01] a denomination start that's what he
[1:40:03] stopped there he stopped a denomination
[1:40:06] that's how quick our unsanctified
[1:40:08] unconverted thinking does things will
[1:40:10] start a denomination at the drop of a
[1:40:12] hat Peter the man that's going to have
[1:40:15] the keys to the kingdom is trying to
[1:40:17] start a denomination right here it says
[1:40:20] but before Peter got through speaking
[1:40:22] about those three different Tabernacles
[1:40:23] The Voice spoke out of glory and said
[1:40:25] this is my beloved Son hear ye him Moses
[1:40:28] was gone the laws gone the prophets are
[1:40:30] gone but this is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:40:33] him no matter where you are hear ye him
[1:40:36] no matter what anything says what mama
[1:40:38] says what papa says what the law says
[1:40:40] what anything else says hear ye him he
[1:40:42] says he is the Everlasting voice God
[1:40:46] positionally plac him as your mediator
[1:40:49] as your father as your God he said this
[1:40:53] is my beloved Son hear ye
[1:40:56] him this is the fullness of
[1:40:59] adoption remember he says this is the
[1:41:01] kingdom of God coming with power this is
[1:41:03] Jesus showing us what our full adoption
[1:41:05] looks like because he's standing up
[1:41:07] there and what does he have a glorified
[1:41:09] body remember what Paul says he says we
[1:41:11] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:41:13] adoption to it the Redemption of the
[1:41:15] body the fullness of the adoption is a
[1:41:17] glorified body Jesus is standing there
[1:41:19] the fullness of the godhead bodily full
[1:41:21] of the Holy Ghost and what does he have
[1:41:23] a glorified
[1:41:28] body what's he showing he's showing us
[1:41:32] the fruits of the resurrection and the
[1:41:34] Rapture he's showing us the fullness of
[1:41:35] the Holy Ghost I spoke of this at sister
[1:41:37] Ed Brenton's F
[1:41:39] funeral that what she saw up there
[1:41:41] remember what what brother braham's wife
[1:41:42] saw up there and then what he saw when
[1:41:45] he went there he looked around he saw
[1:41:46] all these people on the other side of
[1:41:48] time in glory and he said what is this
[1:41:52] and the voice said this is the Holy
[1:41:54] Ghost this is what you preached about
[1:41:57] this is the fullness of adoption this is
[1:41:59] the fullness of the Gospel as you back
[1:42:01] in position in a glorified body restored
[1:42:05] to full Fellowship that's what this is
[1:42:07] so Christ is showing this here and he's
[1:42:09] showing us the the glorified body he's
[1:42:11] showing us the position that we have
[1:42:13] amen that when we leave this body
[1:42:16] whether it's by death or by a rapture we
[1:42:18] receive that glorified body brother
[1:42:20] Braham says this as we start to close he
[1:42:22] says and first thing you know
[1:42:24] they looked and Jesus was glorified
[1:42:25] before them what did he do he dressed
[1:42:28] him in the robe of immortality what the
[1:42:30] fullness of the Holy Ghost the fullness
[1:42:32] of the Holy Ghost is a restoration back
[1:42:33] to your full position in Christ it's
[1:42:35] eternity it's eternal life it's it's the
[1:42:38] life of God in you brother BR would
[1:42:40] would talk about this robe and he'd say
[1:42:42] he would be robed in the Holy
[1:42:44] Ghost in the fullness of it see what am
[1:42:46] I robed in today I'm filled with the
[1:42:48] Holy Ghost but I'm robed in flesh that's
[1:42:51] the problem Christ was robed in immortal
[1:42:53] morality it was a glorified body we're
[1:42:55] robed in flesh this is the thing that
[1:42:57] has to give way to an immortal body a
[1:42:59] glorified body a holy ghost body
[1:43:02] amen it's a body that's built for
[1:43:04] eternity and he said his reignment shine
[1:43:07] like the sun and a cloud overshadowed
[1:43:08] them and Peter and John and them fell on
[1:43:10] their face and they
[1:43:12] looked and there stood Moses and Elijah
[1:43:14] talking to him and Moses had been dead
[1:43:16] and buried in an unmarked grave for 800
[1:43:18] years and Elijah took a chariot ride to
[1:43:21] Heaven 500 years before that what were
[1:43:23] they telling him Church you know the
[1:43:25] scripture tells us what they talked
[1:43:28] about it says that they were telling him
[1:43:33] what was to happen in
[1:43:35] Jerusalem they were telling him what was
[1:43:37] going to happen and what it would
[1:43:40] accomplish his position is mediator his
[1:43:43] position is now Redeemer he's coming
[1:43:45] into the Lamb of God that's what he's
[1:43:47] coming in remember he's going to come
[1:43:48] back as a lion he's only a lamb as long
[1:43:51] as there's mercy and he's coming here as
[1:43:53] the lamb he's coming to give his life
[1:43:55] he's coming to redeem his lost bride and
[1:43:57] so what they're doing is they're saying
[1:43:58] you've got to go to Jerusalem now now is
[1:44:01] the time and we see after this that the
[1:44:03] scripture says and Jesus turned his face
[1:44:05] toward Jerusalem they had told him
[1:44:07] here's what you're doing you're an
[1:44:08] adopted son now you got to go do exactly
[1:44:12] what you were brought here to do and he
[1:44:14] turns his face towards Jerusalem and
[1:44:15] that's how he that's how he tells the
[1:44:17] disciples everything that's going to
[1:44:19] happen to him in detail is because
[1:44:20] they've told him now this is exactly
[1:44:22] what's going to happen but what were
[1:44:25] they saying they're saying this is the
[1:44:26] word that's written now you've got to
[1:44:28] fulfill it but realize there's joy at
[1:44:31] the end of it he knew the scripture says
[1:44:34] for the joy that awaited him he did it
[1:44:37] he got a revelation of exactly what was
[1:44:39] going to happen and he turned his face
[1:44:41] to Jerusalem and what did he do he
[1:44:42] accepted his purpose we read it in the
[1:44:45] communion scriptures so many times we
[1:44:46] don't read it but maybe we do but
[1:44:48] remember Jesus says scripture says and
[1:44:50] Jesus knowing the father had given all
[1:44:52] things things into his hands and that he
[1:44:55] had come from God and went back to God
[1:44:58] all things he didn't have to go to
[1:45:02] calary
[1:45:03] Calvary as in he had a
[1:45:05] choice but being the word made flesh he
[1:45:08] had to fulfill the word so he couldn't
[1:45:10] do it but he surrendered himself to it
[1:45:12] and if you want to know how hard that
[1:45:13] struggle was even in the Garden of
[1:45:15] Gethsemane he says if it's possible
[1:45:17] don't make me do this and he prays three
[1:45:20] times and on the third time he says
[1:45:22] father not my will but thine be done
[1:45:24] that's the man talking but the god in
[1:45:27] him was the one that was taking him all
[1:45:28] the way through
[1:45:33] amen where we at the robe of
[1:45:38] immortality it
[1:45:40] says they were there but few they were
[1:45:42] still there there where they were
[1:45:44] talking to him see he had taken up Jesus
[1:45:45] to see them to see what it was all about
[1:45:49] this is what we were just talking about
[1:45:50] to see what was going on it was giving
[1:45:53] Jesus a preview of what awaited him
[1:45:54] after this horrible death after this
[1:45:56] horrible 3 days he was going to go
[1:45:58] through it says they taken Jesus up to
[1:46:01] see them to see what it was all about to
[1:46:03] see there and show him these things and
[1:46:05] they talk with him and had a
[1:46:06] conversation with him then as soon as
[1:46:08] Peter looked back again and the
[1:46:09] glorification was off of Jesus they saw
[1:46:12] Jesus only and a voice come from the
[1:46:14] cloud and said this is my beloved Son
[1:46:16] hear ye him his name's just as good as
[1:46:18] mine now hear ye him he says that's it
[1:46:21] adopted or placed Sons like I said this
[1:46:25] was the Lamb of God position before this
[1:46:27] he's that that chain breaking jail
[1:46:29] busting sin killing disease healing
[1:46:32] demon removing delivering Son of God but
[1:46:35] now he's stepping into his ultimate role
[1:46:37] and it's to lay down his life now his
[1:46:39] power is found in
[1:46:42] surrender not in kicking out Satan his
[1:46:45] power is in now completely yielding
[1:46:48] himself to the will of the father even
[1:46:50] to the giving up of his life and having
[1:46:52] faith in the word that was in him that
[1:46:54] he would rise again on the third day his
[1:46:57] overcoming power was to overcome himself
[1:46:59] at that point in a way that nobody else
[1:47:01] will do these days it was to use his
[1:47:03] power and position to pay a
[1:47:05] penalty for us to restore us back to our
[1:47:09] position see the confusion with us is
[1:47:12] that our role is not mediator and so we
[1:47:14] look at his Works before his adoption
[1:47:16] and say well that's what I'm going to do
[1:47:17] as an adopted son that's what I'm going
[1:47:19] to do as an adopted daughter no no no
[1:47:21] that's just what sons of gods can do
[1:47:23] but your role doesn't look like his and
[1:47:25] so his looks it's far greater and so
[1:47:28] what he had to go through is is way
[1:47:30] worse than anything will'll have to
[1:47:31] because he had to be brought to a place
[1:47:32] of total surrender where he would lay
[1:47:34] down his physical life in expectation
[1:47:37] that if he didn't rise there was going
[1:47:38] to be problems cuz remember if he died
[1:47:40] and didn't rise we're still
[1:47:42] lost cuz the power that's in him has to
[1:47:44] come into us that's a resurrecting power
[1:47:46] that's a rapturing power amen and the
[1:47:49] signs and the Wonders they were all a
[1:47:51] part of it but let me say it this way if
[1:47:53] he only did the Miracles we'd still be
[1:47:55] lost
[1:47:57] today amen if all he did was come and
[1:48:00] heal the sick and and make the blind see
[1:48:02] and make the lame walk we'd still be
[1:48:04] lost so the signs and wonders are not
[1:48:07] the signs of an adopted son but it was
[1:48:08] his Redemptive position that made him an
[1:48:11] adoptive son and that's what brought us
[1:48:12] back to our place even today amen we get
[1:48:15] the Holy Ghost like they did on the day
[1:48:17] of Pentecost our works tend to look like
[1:48:19] his before his adoption why cuz we're to
[1:48:21] continue his work
[1:48:25] what was it Mark 16 go you into all the
[1:48:28] world preach the gospel in my name you
[1:48:30] cast out Devils if you lay if any are
[1:48:32] sick in you you lay hands on them anoint
[1:48:34] them with oil and all these different
[1:48:35] things if any deadly thing bites you or
[1:48:36] you drink it it won't harm you that's a
[1:48:39] continuation of the works of Christ but
[1:48:42] his work was to give his life ours is to
[1:48:44] take his life and live Amen to continue
[1:48:47] his Works among each each and every one
[1:48:49] of us remember we talked last service we
[1:48:51] said God wants to
[1:48:53] Express his attributes fully that's what
[1:48:56] adoption is is the expression of the
[1:48:58] attribute of God inside you it's the
[1:49:01] word of God living out in your life
[1:49:03] specifically according to what he's
[1:49:05] placed in your life and you're going to
[1:49:07] look different than I'm going to look
[1:49:09] and I'm going to look different than the
[1:49:10] next one and the next one and the next
[1:49:11] one because we each have positions and
[1:49:14] places God's a god of variety just like
[1:49:16] a body is a there ain't nothing the same
[1:49:19] on this even two legs aren't exactly the
[1:49:21] same amen everything here is for purpose
[1:49:24] and it's the same thing for the body of
[1:49:26] Christ what happened was he was the
[1:49:27] fullness of the godhead bodily Christ
[1:49:29] was and on the day of Pentecost he
[1:49:30] poured that fullness into the church and
[1:49:33] now we are his body we're continuing his
[1:49:36] Works amen we're continuing to fulfill
[1:49:39] the word for our day what is it's the
[1:49:42] thoughts of God coming into fruition in
[1:49:44] human flesh and you've got to be able to
[1:49:46] see the same God in you that you put in
[1:49:49] Christ you've got to be able to
[1:49:51] recognize that you're just as much a
[1:49:53] part of the word as he was and that
[1:49:55] you've got the same power and authority
[1:49:58] backing you up backing you up in your
[1:50:02] position as a son and daughter of God
[1:50:04] Amen let's stand together if we would
[1:50:08] what's God waiting
[1:50:10] for to the time where he can trust us
[1:50:12] fully where we've got a proven character
[1:50:15] a surrendered heart a nature that yields
[1:50:19] to the Holy Spirit that's what he had to
[1:50:21] prove with Jesus is that he would yield
[1:50:23] to the Holy Spirit and he never laid a
[1:50:25] foot wrong we lay our feet wrong we go
[1:50:28] down paths we get flustered and
[1:50:30] frustrated sometimes amen but that's
[1:50:32] what the blood of Christ is there for
[1:50:33] that covers Us from all these things but
[1:50:35] God's bringing us to a place we don't
[1:50:37] have full Authority like Christ did
[1:50:40] we've got Authority commensurate with
[1:50:41] our position but our position is to be
[1:50:44] in the word of God it's to take every
[1:50:46] word that he gives us and stand on it
[1:50:48] and say that belongs to me and you got
[1:50:50] enough power and authority to enforce
[1:50:52] that
[1:50:53] anytime anywhere amen amen God bless you
[1:50:57] this evening let's bow our
[1:50:59] heads Heavenly Father Lord how beautiful
[1:51:03] is your word Lord how beautiful are your
[1:51:05] promises Lord how great is your plan
[1:51:07] your vision Lord your purpose for it and

[1:51:14] each one of us Lord I pray you help us
[1:51:17] to read Lord with new eyes as we look in
[1:51:19] your word Lord as we we come into Church

[1:51:24] we're in prayer Lord may we seek the
[1:51:26] mystery of your will the secret of your
[1:51:28] purpose your plan your position for each
[1:51:30] and every one of us Lord God Lord let us
[1:51:32] not put ourselves down Lord let us not
[1:51:35] take away from the greatness that you
[1:51:37] had in calling us lord it's you it's
[1:51:39] your grace from start to finish but Lord
[1:51:42] let us not hold ourselves back with our
[1:51:44] failures or weaknesses Lord but let us
[1:51:46] see through your eyes the position that
[1:51:48] you've called us to Lord that we're in
[1:51:50] Heavenly places right now Lord that
[1:51:52] you've Justified us you've Sanctified us
[1:51:54] you filled us with your spirit Lord
[1:51:56] You've placed us to be a wrecking ball
[1:51:59] in Satan's kingdom Lord we're here to be
[1:52:02] restored Lord we're here to be redeemed
[1:52:04] Lord and every word that you've given to
[1:52:06] us Lord we want to fulfill it Lord help
[1:52:08] us not leave anything Lord on the ground
[1:52:11] anything in that Bible Lord let us not
[1:52:12] leave it on the pages Lord but let it be
[1:52:14] in our hearts and our minds Even in our
[1:52:16] mouth and lives Lord that we would take
[1:52:18] your word and say this belongs to me
[1:52:20] because he called me to it Lord you
[1:52:22] chose chose us and Lord when you chose
[1:52:24] us you placed us you ordained us Lord as
[1:52:26] Sons and Daughters of God Lord help us
[1:52:29] to realize it Lord as just every day
[1:52:32] Lord it seems like things are opening up
[1:52:33] more and more Lord but things are
[1:52:35] closing down in this world Lord time is
[1:52:38] coming to a halt I pray you help us to
[1:52:40] see the hour we're living in Lord let us
[1:52:42] be more serious than ever before Lord
[1:52:45] and even as Paul said Lord Lord Us's lay
[1:52:47] aside the sin that easily besets us Lord
[1:52:49] and focus fully on the race that set
[1:52:51] before us and run with patience Lord
[1:52:54] grant it Grace thank you Lord for
[1:52:55] helping me through this service with my
[1:52:57] voice Lord you're so good Lord thank you
[1:53:00] for answer prayer Lord would you just

[1:53:16] song was so beautiful you know we think
[1:53:18] about where we are today but you have to
[1:53:21] think about what he gave us
[1:53:23] Amen to bring us here and we sing this
[1:53:26] song God comes down perfect puts himself
[1:53:30] in flesh ages suffers pain and hurt and
[1:53:34] rejection and death suffers the feeling
[1:53:38] of sin the blackest smuttiest most
[1:53:43] horrible things that a holy God could
[1:53:46] never feel and yet he felt it and it
[1:53:50] separated him from the very presence of
[1:53:51] God
[1:53:53] and he died for
[1:53:55] us why cuz he saw the joy that awaited
[1:53:59] him what was the Joy Church it was you
[1:54:02] it was you it was this whole body this
[1:54:05] whole bride that he had come back to

[1:54:12] died the way he did and bled the way he
[1:54:15] did and was beaten the way he did
[1:54:16] because there's a joy that he wants to
[1:54:19] have with his bride again amen let's
[1:54:21] sing it in thanks to him this evening
