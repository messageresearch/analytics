[42:00] flow
[42:01] amen god's looking for the truth in our

[42:26] let me know if
[42:27] i'm not then just bring conviction in my
[42:30] heart
[42:31] amen by the grace of god amen so the
[42:34] lord blesses
[42:35] and praying the grace of god be with us
[42:37] tonight as we go into the word
[42:39] and usually one preacher but it's going
[42:42] to be two tonight
[42:44] and uh uh it'll be
[42:47] me and it'll be brother branham amen
[42:50] so we're going to hear a tape by brother
[42:52] branham a message
[42:54] and that was streets many years ago and
[42:56] is entitled by faith
[42:58] moses amen so we're trying to bring that
[43:01] series
[43:02] of faith to a conclusion and i noticed
[43:05] online there's a certain
[43:06] message pressure and he's he's preaching
[43:08] a certain
[43:10] topic there and it goes on and on and on
[43:12] and on
[43:13] amen a lot a lot of sermons it's like
[43:16] one time someone said brother
[43:18] there's no way he said you you can you
[43:19] can match
[43:21] brother uh lee vale
[43:24] i said oh why is that oh he said
[43:28] you you just preached you know this
[43:30] sermon part one part two three four five
[43:32] something like that
[43:33] he said but level goes on and on and on
[43:36] and on
[43:36] and and i did notice that there was
[43:38] sermons by lee vale too
[43:40] where you go on to part 50. you know
[43:43] and so i said well i just finished the
[43:46] series i said home i said that was part
[43:47] 60.
[43:49] so i said does that entitle me to be
[43:51] compared with brotherly veil
[43:53] and so they were surprised that i would
[43:54] go that far but i do
[43:56] well and not only that i don't recall
[43:58] the name of it the the title i was using
[44:00] of that sermon
[44:02] but the sister kissed a coffee
[44:05] and god bless her and god rest her soul
[44:07] sister gabby was saying brother she's
[44:09] that was the best sermon i heard
[44:11] she said in in what she was in dealing
[44:13] with in our services
[44:15] so god bless her amen by the grace of
[44:18] god because i went on as i said to about
[44:20] i saw sure it was clear close to 60
[44:24] part 60. this is the title part 16. amen
[44:28] so to god be the glory amen why because
[44:31] it's the word
[44:32] and you go on and on and on and on amen
[44:35] this is the word that's the word that's
[44:36] the word amen
[44:37] what are we hearing well it doesn't make
[44:40] a difference when it comes to the
[44:41] subject
[44:42] it's it's it's the word amen it has that
[44:45] again
[44:46] it's like our brother jonathan there
[44:47] going through all these scriptures
[44:49] good wonderful amen and then go
[44:52] go through the quotes by the grace of
[44:53] god wonderful amen
[44:55] it's the word brother and we're feeding
[44:58] on the word
[44:59] amen and again it's like preachers of
[45:03] years ago
[45:04] oh my you know they would go and preach
[45:06] and preach and preach and preach
[45:08] and but the people weren't looking at
[45:10] watches thank god that not many had to
[45:12] watch back then
[45:14] amen they weren't looking at this
[45:15] looking at that and they just go on and
[45:17] on
[45:18] and on and i remember one time that our
[45:20] our our brother john wesley
[45:22] he was ministering usually he he would
[45:24] go to a
[45:26] iron ore mines where they were they were
[45:29] doing work there
[45:30] and he would preach to those that come
[45:31] out and then he would preach to those
[45:33] that were going in
[45:35] to the mines over and over and over
[45:37] again another time that john wesley was
[45:39] preaching
[45:40] oh my they could they he was he was in
[45:42] the cemetery outside the church
[45:44] and why because the church wasn't big
[45:46] enough for the crowd that had gathered
[45:48] to hear
[45:48] john wesley and what was this what was
[45:51] this
[45:52] is the thing that he was using to
[45:55] pulp it oh it was it was a tombstone and
[46:00] he went and he found a tombstone there
[46:01] somewhere
[46:02] and he got up on the tombstone and they
[46:03] preached from that amen
[46:05] praise the name of the lord it's not not
[46:07] like today where preachers want this and
[46:09] they want this they prefer this and
[46:11] prefer that
[46:12] oh brother amen the most important thing
[46:15] is not the pulpit it's the word amen
[46:19] so i pray grace again for the word going
[46:21] forth over the pulpit
[46:23] amen and then the broader god said the
[46:25] word is god it's true the word god's
[46:26] judging you that's right
[46:28] god knows your faith god knows your
[46:30] thoughts god knows your feelings toward
[46:32] toward what you're hearing amen oh yes
[46:35] so let's be on our guard
[46:36] by the grace of god that we're here for
[46:39] the word
[46:40] by the grace of god why because we
[46:43] recognize our need for the word
[46:45] amen it's not not not doctrine of a
[46:48] church or
[46:49] the creed of a church and this and that
[46:50] no we need the word we need thus saith
[46:53] the lord
[46:54] because why because it's ordained by god
[46:57] to give us the faith that pleases god
[47:00] amen praise the lord
[47:02] because there's many that will preach
[47:04] but it's not giving them the faith that
[47:05] pray that pleases god
[47:07] no no is it they're just preaching their
[47:09] creed you know well

[47:12] they're gonna preach with this this
[47:14] title and that title and
[47:15] oh yeah it's gonna line up with with our
[47:17] creed and so on
[47:18] no sir you gotta line up with the word
[47:20] of god amen thus saith the lord it is
[47:23] written and i'll be honest there's a
[47:25] i've mentioned to a couple uh of the
[47:28] saints

[47:34] internet
[47:35] and i'll tell you brother you think oh
[47:38] they represent this church or that
[47:39] church
[47:41] but they don't they don't act like that
[47:43] and they don't talk like that
[47:45] they're not they're just bound by by the
[47:47] creed of the church they're representing
[47:49] no
[47:49] bound by the word amen and they they'll
[47:52] sing and sing and sing
[47:54] and and they'll keep coming to it to you
[47:56] with the word the word the word
[47:58] the the bible says the bible says the
[47:59] lord said the lord said
[48:01] not church it's the lord amen and i said
[48:04] well god bless them and because they're

[48:11] world
[48:11] are tuning in and they are being fed
[48:15] by that word amen so glad that that

[48:42] i said bless them i said for what
[48:44] they're doing and they stand they're
[48:45] taking for the word
[48:46] and remember again brother we need this
[48:49] understanding we need this revelation

[48:56] for the bride
[48:58] that's for the bride but what about
[48:59] those outside the city

[49:03] god warned us he said now we want
[49:05] now that we won't get the message to
[49:06] everyone but to the right
[49:08] amen and all down through the ages god
[49:12] has chosen this
[49:12] and this and this amen and some of them

[49:18] the lord

[49:59] flesh

[1:01:17] back there the pentecostal age no
[1:01:19] we're in the bright age by the grace of
[1:01:21] god
[1:01:22] so god help us and brother is like the
[1:01:24] power of god said
[1:01:25] he said when the holy spirit the pillar
[1:01:27] of fire came into the room
[1:01:29] in in uh branham tabernacle when the
[1:01:32] prophet of god was preaching this series
[1:01:34] right here
[1:01:34] and he was coming near the end of it and
[1:01:36] he said the pillar fire came in
[1:01:38] and he saw he he was people
[1:01:41] was looking at the reflection of the
[1:01:43] light but brother brown was looking at
[1:01:45] the bill of fire
[1:01:46] amen and he came in and he went over and
[1:01:49] uh on that side and oh
[1:01:52] and he what did he do he drew this this
[1:01:54] is what he put on the wall
[1:01:56] amen above the windows they look you
[1:01:58] know this is this they saw the seven
[1:02:00] church ages
[1:02:01] but and the problem god said he said you
[1:02:04] remember it he said you'll notice this
[1:02:05] one
[1:02:06] he said there was no light there he said
[1:02:08] it was all
[1:02:09] black it was all dark and he said i put
[1:02:12] that there
[1:02:13] to represent the bright age amen the
[1:02:15] calling of the bride
[1:02:17] by the grace of god because again the
[1:02:19] bible says
[1:02:20] when the son of man comes will he find
[1:02:23] faith
[1:02:24] amen that's how serious it is so i pray
[1:02:27] the grace of god
[1:02:28] that we have faith we believe we believe
[1:02:31] jesus
[1:02:32] did do what he did and he came back and
[1:02:34] he was resurrected
[1:02:35] amen and jesus has come back again now
[1:02:38] to unite with his bride
[1:02:40] amen did it brother brown refer to it as
[1:02:43] the invisible
[1:02:44] union of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:02:47] earthly bride
[1:02:48] amen brother i trust that he's in
[1:02:51] control
[1:02:51] and you feel bound to him as your mate
[1:02:55] amen in deuteronomy chapter 32
[1:03:00] amen and verse 15
[1:03:05] but jesus
[1:03:08] waxed fat and kicked
[1:03:12] thou art waxing fat thou art grown
[1:03:16] thick and thou art covered with fatness
[1:03:19] and then he forsook god which made him
[1:03:23] and lightly esteemed the rock of his
[1:03:26] salvation lightly esteemed it
[1:03:30] and they provoked him to jealousy with
[1:03:33] strange
[1:03:34] gods with abominations
[1:03:37] provoked they him to anger
[1:03:41] and they sacrificed unto devils not
[1:03:44] to god this is amazing but the life
[1:03:47] you're living sometimes
[1:03:48] either not not us by the grace of god
[1:03:51] but
[1:03:52] i know that it out outside there
[1:03:54] somewhere there they're the make
[1:03:55] believers amen they're sacrificed unto
[1:03:58] devils
[1:03:58] not to god amen and he said to gods whom
[1:04:02] they knew not
[1:04:03] and in new gods that came newly up whom
[1:04:06] your fathers
[1:04:07] feared not of the rock that beget thee
[1:04:11] thou art unmindful and has forgotten god
[1:04:15] that formed thee amen and when the lord
[1:04:19] saw it he aborted them because of the
[1:04:22] provoking of his sons
[1:04:24] and of his daughters and he said
[1:04:27] i will hide my face from them i will see
[1:04:31] what their
[1:04:31] end shall be for they are
[1:04:34] in fair a very forward generation
[1:04:39] children in whom is no faith
[1:04:42] god have mercy amen
[1:04:46] and they have moved me to jealousy with
[1:04:49] that which is not god
[1:04:51] they have provoked me to anger with
[1:04:54] their vanities
[1:04:55] and i will move them to jealousy with
[1:04:58] those
[1:04:59] which are not a people
[1:05:03] amen i will provoke them to
[1:05:06] anger with a foolish nation amen
[1:05:10] the fire is kindled in mine anger and
[1:05:12] shall burn
[1:05:13] unto the lowest hell and shall consume
[1:05:16] the earth
[1:05:17] with her increase and set on fire the
[1:05:19] foundations
[1:05:21] of the mountains god bless his word
[1:05:24] amen you may be seated
[1:05:31] turn with me to the book of hebrews
[1:05:33] chapter 4.
[1:05:41] hebrews chapter 4
[1:05:44] and reading first couple of verses
[1:05:49] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[1:05:52] being left us of entering into his rest
[1:05:55] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:05:57] it
[1:05:58] amen for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:06:03] as well as unto them but the word
[1:06:06] preached
[1:06:06] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:06:10] faith amen brother
[1:06:15] god's looking for faith not the word in
[1:06:18] your head
[1:06:18] he's looking for the revelation in your
[1:06:20] heart amen
[1:06:22] so we're praying the grace of god that
[1:06:25] we be we're here because we have
[1:06:26] something in our hearts controlling us
[1:06:29] amen not because we think all the the
[1:06:32] that message is good
[1:06:33] and i believe that's the right one this
[1:06:35] is right you can have all that in your
[1:06:36] head but where is it in your heart
[1:06:40] amen and are we going forth and out of
[1:06:42] the heart reflecting the word
[1:06:44] the word made flesh in you the word may
[1:06:46] flesh in me
[1:06:47] amen shall i pray the grace of god
[1:06:51] that we're going we will be we we will
[1:06:53] be a witness to the world
[1:06:55] of the world of the word made flesh amen
[1:06:59] as the prophet of god said and he said
[1:07:01] that this one will go up
[1:07:02] and they say i didn't i didn't see jesus
[1:07:04] i didn't know jesus
[1:07:06] you know was he in my day was he living
[1:07:08] in me in that hour
[1:07:09] and the brother ranu said oh yeah and
[1:07:11] god is going to open the heaven there
[1:07:13] and he said he's going to flash it on
[1:07:14] the screen it'll be your witness
[1:07:17] and your testimony it might be a friend
[1:07:19] it might be a neighbor we don't know
[1:07:21] but god was was a witness to the world
[1:07:24] through you
[1:07:25] amen through the life that you lived
[1:07:27] through the attitude that you had the
[1:07:29] actions and the reactions
[1:07:30] your brother brown said you'll show it
[1:07:32] on the screen right there
[1:07:34] amen and say well this was your neighbor
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:37] see what he was reflecting see what he
[1:07:38] was doing amen
[1:07:40] he was reflecting god reflecting jesus
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:44] yeah and then what that's why the
[1:07:46] prophet of god said he said god's going
[1:07:47] to judge them by you
[1:07:49] you better be on your guard amen you
[1:07:52] better walk in the spirit live in the
[1:07:54] spirit amen
[1:07:55] let the spirit control you amen because
[1:07:58] god's going to reflect it
[1:07:59] and show you the witness of god the
[1:08:01] witness of his word
[1:08:03] amen by the grace of god amen
[1:08:07] again verse 2 for unto us was the gospel
[1:08:09] preached as well as unto them
[1:08:12] but the word preached did not profit
[1:08:15] them
[1:08:15] i trust that it's profiting you oh yeah
[1:08:19] grace why because it wasn't mixed with
[1:08:23] faith
[1:08:24] amen what believe in it not in your head
[1:08:28] believe it in your heart
[1:08:29] amen you're responding out of your heart
[1:08:31] to the word
[1:08:33] amen hallelujah oh there's something on
[1:08:35] the inside of the inside
[1:08:37] saying amen that's the word of god thank
[1:08:39] you jesus amen
[1:08:41] but again it might be in their heads
[1:08:45] and that's not salvation salvation is
[1:08:47] when the word is in control in your soul
[1:08:50] amen and you're a new creature you're
[1:08:52] born again
[1:08:53] and if you're born again you've got the
[1:08:56] nature
[1:08:57] and new nature of being born again
[1:09:01] amen it's the nature that controls you
[1:09:03] by the grace of god
[1:09:05] amen so what nature is in control of you
[1:09:07] is it your natural mother and father
[1:09:09] or is it jesus amen verse of moses the
[1:09:13] nature of jesus controlling the old
[1:09:14] nature
[1:09:16] well he's here he's here to control it
[1:09:19] amen you're going to go forth and not
[1:09:21] just reflect oh you know
[1:09:22] your natural mother and father you're
[1:09:24] going to reflect jesus that's in control
[1:09:26] oh yeah he's there to control the old
[1:09:28] nature
[1:09:29] amen in some instances to change the old
[1:09:32] nature
[1:09:32] some instances amen to rip out that old
[1:09:36] nature
[1:09:37] so that he takes control amen
[1:09:40] grace to his brother brother because why
[1:09:42] what we believe
[1:09:44] has to be mixed with faith so he said
[1:09:47] for we
[1:09:48] which have believed to enter into rest
[1:09:51] praise the lord as he said as i have
[1:09:54] sworn in my wrath
[1:09:56] if they shall enter into my rest
[1:09:58] although the works were finished from
[1:10:00] the foundation of the world
[1:10:03] for he spake in a certain place of the
[1:10:05] seventh day on this wise
[1:10:06] and god did rest a seventh day from all
[1:10:10] his works amen and in this place again
[1:10:14] if they shall enter into my rest amen
[1:10:17] seeing therefore it remaineth that some
[1:10:19] must enter therein
[1:10:21] and they to whom it was first preached
[1:10:24] amen entered not in
[1:10:25] because of unbelief amen they never had
[1:10:29] the faith that please god
[1:10:31] praise the lord i usually recommend
[1:10:35] saturday keepers read hebrews 4.
[1:10:39] amen i said you want to know who you who
[1:10:42] the true sabbath is
[1:10:43] what it is i read hebrews 4. amen i said
[1:10:46] our true sabbath is jesus
[1:10:48] and as i said then i i i mentioned it to
[1:10:51] a
[1:10:52] saturday keeper and when i met him and
[1:10:54] he was he's much older
[1:10:56] and i would say he's in his 80s for sure
[1:10:59] and
[1:10:59] uh he always said you're you're a pastor
[1:11:02] now
[1:11:03] because he told me when i was in in the
[1:11:05] i remember in the
[1:11:06] in the school and in the in the room
[1:11:08] there where the grade 11
[1:11:10] was being taught and he said oh
[1:11:14] mr lush he said you know you're going to
[1:11:16] be a pastor do you
[1:11:18] i said i don't know i'll leave that with
[1:11:19] the lord. and he felt oh yes you'll be a
[1:11:22] pastor
[1:11:23] and that's what he felt in in his
[1:11:26] experience
[1:11:27] with me and so i met him many years
[1:11:29] later
[1:11:30] many many years later amen and
[1:11:33] he recognized me he come over to
[1:11:35] introduce himself to me
[1:11:37] and and i told him about the church
[1:11:39] always you
[1:11:40] you got you you're pastoring yes i said
[1:11:42] you told me yes he said
[1:11:44] and he said oh he said what day do you
[1:11:47] worship on do you worship on saturday or
[1:11:49] sunday
[1:11:50] i said no i said we worship on sunday
[1:11:53] but i said when it comes to
[1:11:54] the day you you i said it's in honor of
[1:11:57] the resurrection
[1:11:58] but i said any day will do i said you
[1:12:00] cease from your dead works of sin
[1:12:03] i said not one day a week i said you
[1:12:05] cease from your dead works of sin
[1:12:07] seven days a week and i said you enter
[1:12:09] into god's sabbath jesus
[1:12:11] amen and i'll tell you his eyes popped
[1:12:15] he was shocked he said i never heard
[1:12:19] that before
[1:12:21] i said well i said just want you to
[1:12:23] think about it
[1:12:24] consider it okay thank you oh yeah
[1:12:27] so we pray the grace of god brother you
[1:12:30] should have this revelation
[1:12:31] that jesus is god's sabbath amen not
[1:12:34] saturday not sunday
[1:12:37] amen but i should cease from your dead
[1:12:39] works of sin seven days a week
[1:12:41] and enter into the sabbath of god jesus
[1:12:45] and it's he couldn't he said i've never
[1:12:46] heard it before so i said well go to
[1:12:48] your bible
[1:12:49] hebrews chapter 4 i should read it amen
[1:12:52] praise the lord let's go to
[1:12:55] see first john chapter 5
[1:13:02] amen
[1:13:06] and verse 1
[1:13:12] whosoever believer that jesus is the
[1:13:14] christ
[1:13:15] is born of god amen and everyone that
[1:13:19] loveth him that begat
[1:13:20] love of them also that is begotten of
[1:13:22] him amen

[1:13:26] children of god
[1:13:27] when we love god amen you love god
[1:13:32] if you love god you love you love the
[1:13:33] brothers and sisters of the faith
[1:13:37] oh yeah no way you can do away with it
[1:13:38] it's there it's just all of them
[1:13:40] it's the in control amen
[1:13:44] for this we know that we love the
[1:13:46] children of god when we love
[1:13:48] god and keep his commandments for this
[1:13:51] is the love of god that we keep his
[1:13:53] commandments
[1:13:54] and his commandments are not grievous
[1:13:57] for whatsoever is born of god
[1:13:59] overcometh the world and this is the
[1:14:01] victory
[1:14:02] that overcometh the world even our faith
[1:14:06] amen praise the lord we got we don't
[1:14:09] have to worry about it we got the faith
[1:14:11] so the holy ghost is there to meet any
[1:14:13] challenge
[1:14:14] amen he's there to give you the victory
[1:14:17] amen he's there to manifest the victory
[1:14:20] go on my son don't worry about it one
[1:14:21] sister's daughter go on
[1:14:23] oh yes thank you lord amen so glad that
[1:14:26] i experienced that
[1:14:28] and and it didn't influence me i think
[1:14:31] that god in me
[1:14:32] influenced it amen thank the lord what
[1:14:34] is this tremendous
[1:14:36] let me read it again for whatsoever is
[1:14:39] born of god overcometh the world
[1:14:41] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:14:43] the world

[1:14:54] directly to the prophet of god
[1:14:55] and let him minister amen as i said his
[1:14:58] two two preachers
[1:15:00] so we'll hear the first one and
[1:15:03] pray the grace of god not not to anoint
[1:15:07] the second one amen god bless us
[1:15:12] brother matthew amen
[1:15:18] the 11th chapter of the book of hebrews
[1:15:22] wednesday night we were speaking on the
[1:15:25] seventh chapter of the book of hebrews
[1:15:28] of
[1:15:29] mel cassidy being without father
[1:15:33] without mother without beginning of
[1:15:36] days are ending of life
[1:15:40] and i thought maybe this morning it
[1:15:42] would be appropriate
[1:15:44] to open again this wonderful book being
[1:15:47] that we have the backgrounds to what we
[1:15:49] wish to say
[1:15:52] in the former readings
[1:15:55] and skipping over the 10th chapter in
[1:15:57] the ninth chapter which is the
[1:15:58] sacrificial laws we would come into a
[1:16:01] spot
[1:16:02] of faith
[1:16:05] and here in the book of
[1:16:09] hebrews 11th chapter and beginning with
[1:16:11] the 23rd
[1:16:12] verse we read it like this
[1:16:17] by faith moses when he was born
[1:16:20] was hid three months of his parents
[1:16:23] because
[1:16:24] they saw he was a proper child
[1:16:27] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:16:30] commandment
[1:16:32] by faith moses
[1:16:36] when he came to years refused to be
[1:16:39] called the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1:16:43] choosing rather to suffer the affliction
[1:16:48] with the people of god than to enjoy
[1:16:52] the pleasures of sin for a season
[1:16:57] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[1:17:01] riches
[1:17:03] than the treasures of egypt
[1:17:08] and had recompensed unto the reward
[1:17:12] by faith he foresuck egypt
[1:17:16] not fearing the wrath of the king
[1:17:19] for he endured as seeing him who is
[1:17:22] invisibling
[1:17:26] i want to take the subject this morning
[1:17:30] choosing by faith
[1:17:33] and i want to take for a text the first
[1:17:36] three
[1:17:37] words are the 23rd
[1:17:40] uh chapter by faith
[1:17:44] moses
[1:17:48] and choosing by faith most everything
[1:17:51] that we
[1:17:52] do we have to choose by
[1:17:55] faith and all that we find that
[1:17:59] moses did that's worth repeating
[1:18:03] was by faith
[1:18:06] not by sight but by faith
[1:18:11] and the reason that i have selected this
[1:18:13] this morning for the church
[1:18:15] in this state has
[1:18:18] been that in our even our schools and
[1:18:22] around we have had so much of
[1:18:25] scientific teaching
[1:18:28] because of this we have drawn the people
[1:18:31] away from
[1:18:33] faith now faith is not proved by
[1:18:37] science faith is what
[1:18:40] science doesn't see
[1:18:43] and we if we ever lose this
[1:18:46] great faith then we are
[1:18:50] totally in darkness
[1:18:54] it no matter how well we are educated
[1:18:58] how we could explain the word of god to
[1:19:02] suit our
[1:19:02] own way of believing there
[1:19:06] is no way to ever please god
[1:19:09] only by faith
[1:19:12] the scripture plainly states it that way
[1:19:17] and it's by faith and without
[1:19:20] faith says the scripture
[1:19:24] it is impossible to please god
[1:19:28] so if faith disagrees with science
[1:19:32] and science disagrees with faith
[1:19:36] that puts them at age and each other
[1:19:40] then we must take a choice
[1:19:43] as moses did by
[1:19:47] faith we believe now
[1:19:50] if we lose faith then we will
[1:19:54] never get a prayer answered by god
[1:19:58] for he that cometh to god must first
[1:20:01] believe that
[1:20:02] he is and a rewarder of those that
[1:20:06] diligently seek after him
[1:20:09] so if we lose faith our prayers are
[1:20:13] in all we get nowhere
[1:20:18] so it's all that we can
[1:20:21] think of this morning is to hold on to
[1:20:25] faith then if we lose
[1:20:28] faith all our hopes is gone
[1:20:33] and if we lose faith all our
[1:20:37] spiritual reality is gone
[1:20:41] for you cannot have faith in
[1:20:44] things that you see for the things that
[1:20:48] you see
[1:20:49] are all perishable
[1:20:53] if we look at some great person
[1:20:57] a great minister our great congregation
[1:21:02] they will all perish someday
[1:21:06] and if we look at a great nation our
[1:21:09] great
[1:21:10] weapon they'll all perish someday
[1:21:16] and then we must live by
[1:21:19] faith of those things that science does
[1:21:22] not declare
[1:21:24] it's by faith that we believe
[1:21:29] now we lose our glory
[1:21:33] if we lose faith now
[1:21:36] if we get away from faith then we take
[1:21:38] the church into an intellectual
[1:21:41] realm and many times
[1:21:44] it's been thought amongst people
[1:21:48] that because a congregation was
[1:21:51] large and they had
[1:21:55] great uh churches
[1:21:59] great steeples and a great
[1:22:02] lot of well dressed and groomed peoples
[1:22:06] and a lot of uh finances that they
[1:22:10] could afford such things we
[1:22:13] many times thought that was inspiring
[1:22:17] that this certain church must be
[1:22:20] inspired
[1:22:22] or we've often referred to different
[1:22:24] ministers
[1:22:26] who get out on the field and have great
[1:22:29] gatherings of crowds and we think
[1:22:33] sometimes that they
[1:22:34] are the signs of inspiration
[1:22:38] but that's not altogether the truth
[1:22:42] that's human inspiration
[1:22:46] but the real inspiration comes by
[1:22:49] doing the will of god see whether it is
[1:22:52] a
[1:22:53] one or just a handful
[1:22:57] whether it is a big church or a small
[1:23:00] church it matters not
[1:23:03] whether he is a great eloquent speaker
[1:23:06] or
[1:23:07] just a man that hardly knows his abc's
[1:23:10] it doesn't matter
[1:23:12] it depends on the message that he's
[1:23:15] bringing
[1:23:16] whether it is inspired by the word of
[1:23:19] god
[1:23:20] or is it inspired by intellectual
[1:23:23] conceptions of human inspiration
[1:23:27] some people can be inspired because of
[1:23:29] an eloquent speaker
[1:23:32] that doesn't make it right sometimes
[1:23:35] they're inspired because the man is so
[1:23:37] trained he could put his point over it
[1:23:39] that doesn't mean
[1:23:40] that it's of god see
[1:23:43] it's only through god's everlasting
[1:23:47] eternal blessed word can we receive
[1:23:50] inspiration and that's given by the holy
[1:23:53] ghost
[1:23:55] by faith we receive it
[1:23:59] now we would think of moses
[1:24:02] and this great time of
[1:24:05] his life and we read back of his birth
[1:24:09] and how that god had cured foreign
[1:24:13] but there cometh time in moses life
[1:24:17] to where there had to be a choosing time
[1:24:21] amen if we read right we find out that
[1:24:25] he
[1:24:25] was the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1:24:28] and it was the heir to the throne
[1:24:32] and would have been the next pharaoh in
[1:24:35] egypt
[1:24:37] so he would notice as he
[1:24:40] looked around after he'd become of age
[1:24:43] and other
[1:24:44] accountability and there would be
[1:24:48] those slaves working out in the
[1:24:51] slime pits and moses
[1:24:55] as he looked through the windows of the
[1:24:58] palace
[1:25:00] upon the same slaves that pharaoh
[1:25:04] looked down
[1:25:08] but what a difference there was in the
[1:25:10] looking
[1:25:13] i want to base that thought this morning
[1:25:16] for a few minutes
[1:25:18] and may the god of heaven drive it home
[1:25:22] to every heart here
[1:25:25] it's how you look at anything what makes
[1:25:28] the difference
[1:25:32] the great evangelist john sproul which
[1:25:35] was a
[1:25:36] convert of brother bosworth's ministry
[1:25:39] who many of you remember years ago of
[1:25:41] the old glory barn
[1:25:44] he said one day he was taking a trip
[1:25:46] before the deceasing of his
[1:25:49] beloved companion and wife
[1:25:52] they were in la salle reigns france
[1:25:57] and i had the privilege of visiting the
[1:25:59] same place
[1:26:00] and the god was taking them out through
[1:26:03] the gardens and
[1:26:04] showing them the different things and
[1:26:08] they come upon a certain statue of the
[1:26:11] lord
[1:26:11] jesus the crucifixion
[1:26:14] and mr sproul was standing off looking
[1:26:17] at it he and his wife
[1:26:19] and in their hearts were criticizing
[1:26:22] what the artist must have had in mind or
[1:26:25] the sculpture rather
[1:26:27] when he hewed out of a stone
[1:26:30] such a horrible looking thing to be to
[1:26:33] represent the
[1:26:34] suffering and the love
[1:26:37] and the pity of the lord jesus
[1:26:42] and how it was all cruelly and
[1:26:45] chopped up looking and the god
[1:26:48] came to mr sprole and he said sir
[1:26:52] i suppose that you are criticizing this
[1:26:56] statue of the lord jesus
[1:27:00] and he said i am
[1:27:04] and he said i am not a bit surprised
[1:27:06] because most people
[1:27:08] that look at it first they do criticize
[1:27:10] it
[1:27:12] and mr strong said well i can't see
[1:27:15] any pity or any
[1:27:18] inspiration from looking at such a thing
[1:27:22] so i'm
[1:27:23] wondering why the sculpture every made
[1:27:26] it like
[1:27:27] this and
[1:27:31] the sculpture said mr spell
[1:27:35] this statue's all right
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:38] and the sculpture had the right thing in
[1:27:41] his
[1:27:42] mind but where the
[1:27:45] trouble is is with you
[1:27:49] it's the way you're looking at it
[1:27:54] and he took he and his wife by the hand
[1:27:56] and led them down
[1:27:57] to a altar at the foot of the
[1:28:01] said cross and he said now mr sproul
[1:28:06] look up now and when he looked up
[1:28:09] he said his heart liked to have failed
[1:28:12] him
[1:28:14] what a difference it was to stand off
[1:28:16] there and look at it that way
[1:28:19] and to get down and look at it the way
[1:28:21] that it was
[1:28:22] made to look at amen
[1:28:26] and that's the way that god is
[1:28:29] that's the way that faith is
[1:28:33] it's the way you look at it
[1:28:36] if you look at it as some sort of a
[1:28:40] historical bible
[1:28:43] of something that was in the days gone
[1:28:46] by you will never
[1:28:49] be able to get the real value of the
[1:28:52] bible
[1:28:54] you are supposed to get on your knees
[1:28:59] and obey the commandments of this bible
[1:29:03] and look at it through the eyes of the
[1:29:05] holy spirit
[1:29:09] i would ask this audience this morning
[1:29:12] what good does a historical god do
[1:29:15] us today if he isn't the same god
[1:29:20] what good does a god
[1:29:23] that would take moses and do the
[1:29:26] miracles with him that he did what good
[1:29:29] would it do us to read of such a god if
[1:29:31] he isn't the same one today
[1:29:36] what good is a god that could deliver
[1:29:38] from the fiery furnace
[1:29:40] the hebrew children if he isn't the same
[1:29:43] god today amen
[1:29:47] what god is the god that would judge
[1:29:49] between right and wrong
[1:29:51] in a day gone by and praise the wrong
[1:29:54] and
[1:29:55] bless the right if he isn't the same god
[1:29:58] today
[1:29:59] what do we go to church for
[1:30:02] why do we abstain from things of the
[1:30:05] world
[1:30:06] if he isn't the same god of the same
[1:30:08] judgment
[1:30:09] and the same opinion that he always was
[1:30:13] what good would it be for a god
[1:30:16] who could touch a woman's hand with a
[1:30:18] raging fever
[1:30:21] and the fever stop if he is of the same
[1:30:25] god today
[1:30:29] what good would it be to serve a god who
[1:30:32] could call his friend from a grave after
[1:30:34] being dead for
[1:30:35] days if he isn't the same god today
[1:30:42] by faith we believe that some glorious
[1:30:45] day he shall call us from the earth
[1:30:48] though we
[1:30:48] be a spoonful of ashes again hallelujah
[1:30:52] how do we prove it we do not prove it we
[1:30:55] believe
[1:30:56] it we are not asked to prove
[1:30:59] anything we're asked to believe it amen
[1:31:03] by faith moses did such and such
[1:31:09] as moses as a young man looked through
[1:31:12] the palace
[1:31:13] winter at the slaves
[1:31:16] he saw the same bunch of gravy
[1:31:20] dirty muck-ridden slaves that
[1:31:24] pharaoh saw
[1:31:27] and when pharaoh looked upon him and the
[1:31:30] egyptians
[1:31:31] they wasn't nothing but a bunch of
[1:31:33] slaves
[1:31:35] that's all they were good for just to be
[1:31:38] human mud daubers to make muddy bricks
[1:31:43] for the benefit of the cities that
[1:31:47] pharaoh was building that's the way
[1:31:50] mo the egyptians and pharaoh
[1:31:54] looked at the slaves
[1:31:58] but moses when he looked at him
[1:32:03] it was a different look moses had
[1:32:07] when he was seen passing by the window
[1:32:12] the great ditches in their face
[1:32:16] the tears that run down their cheeks
[1:32:20] and their bit bodies
[1:32:24] he looked upon them as the people
[1:32:27] of god amen
[1:32:32] he didn't look upon him as slaves
[1:32:35] he looked upon him as the chosen people
[1:32:39] of god amen oh
[1:32:42] as i go about from country to
[1:32:46] country and from nation to nation
[1:32:50] preaching since i
[1:32:53] left the doors of this little tabernacle
[1:32:56] that's an interdenominational
[1:32:57] institution
[1:32:59] with no law but love no
[1:33:02] book but the bible no creed but christ
[1:33:06] i've tried to look up on god's children
[1:33:10] and upon the rejected as
[1:33:14] being god's chosen and elected people
[1:33:18] i don't ask them if they belong to the
[1:33:20] venom tabernacle
[1:33:22] i don't ask them if they're methodists
[1:33:24] or if they're presbyterians
[1:33:27] or if they are pentecostals
[1:33:31] our nazarenes are pilgrim holiness
[1:33:35] i just want to look upon them as
[1:33:38] a people of god i'm
[1:33:41] seeing their doings and their actions
[1:33:44] that they are the servants of the lord
[1:33:48] god and my heart desires fellowship with
[1:33:51] them
[1:33:53] no matter what brand they got
[1:33:56] i just long for their fellowship
[1:34:01] i love them because i know they are
[1:34:04] people of god when i
[1:34:08] see a woman coming down the street
[1:34:12] with the long skirting her hair done up
[1:34:15] neatly in the back and
[1:34:17] and a decent looking dress on
[1:34:21] and i see another young lady maybe the
[1:34:24] same age with a
[1:34:26] little pair of shorts on
[1:34:29] she may be in looks twice as pretty
[1:34:32] as the woman with the long hair
[1:34:34] according to the looking
[1:34:35] of the world but i take my
[1:34:38] side with that girl that's dressed like
[1:34:42] a christian
[1:34:45] though they'd be laughing at her and
[1:34:47] calling her a fanatic
[1:34:49] yet i take my side
[1:34:53] she might not be as pretty as the other
[1:34:55] girl featurely
[1:34:56] but she sees something by
[1:35:00] faith she sees him who is invisible
[1:35:03] who is guiding her life
[1:35:06] when i see the man on the job being
[1:35:09] called
[1:35:10] deacon our teacher
[1:35:14] are a fanatic because he refuses to
[1:35:18] smoke and to
[1:35:19] drink beer and to go to dances like the
[1:35:24] rest of them
[1:35:25] and he's called a fanatic my
[1:35:28] heart goes out for him he is my
[1:35:31] brother am i
[1:35:35] down in this egypt soils
[1:35:38] that makes our heart long to embrace him
[1:35:43] and say brother we are
[1:35:46] pilgrims and strangers of this land and
[1:35:49] i
[1:35:50] long to fellowship with you
[1:35:54] moses had to make a choice
[1:35:58] choosing by faith
[1:36:01] how many young men would have jumped at
[1:36:04] the opportunity
[1:36:06] to become the son of pharaoh's
[1:36:10] daughter how many young men would have
[1:36:13] jumped at the opportunity
[1:36:16] that moses had to enjoy
[1:36:19] all the pleasures and the glamour
[1:36:23] of the world to become the king of
[1:36:27] egypt to have the whole world
[1:36:31] at his feet what a foolish thing
[1:36:36] that the young man of his days must have
[1:36:38] thought
[1:36:39] when moses chose to
[1:36:42] take his place with the afflicted and
[1:36:46] suffering people of god amen
[1:36:51] why did he do it by faith
[1:36:56] when he lifted up his eyes he looked
[1:36:59] beyond the
[1:37:00] grammar of this world
[1:37:04] he looked beyond the pleasures of sin
[1:37:07] and the bible said that he endured as
[1:37:10] seeing him who was
[1:37:12] invisible by faith and he made a
[1:37:15] choice to serve that
[1:37:18] god regardless of what took
[1:37:21] place it has not changed
[1:37:27] many of us could go to what we would
[1:37:29] call a better
[1:37:30] building we could enjoy
[1:37:34] maybe the fellowship and pleasures
[1:37:38] of setting in a better pew
[1:37:42] we might be more popular to drink and to
[1:37:46] smoke and to
[1:37:47] dress and to act like the world
[1:37:50] well what's the matter you've lifted up
[1:37:53] your eyes
[1:37:55] and by faith you see him who is
[1:37:57] invisible
[1:37:58] and took your stand with the rejected
[1:38:01] and so-called holy rulers of the day
[1:38:05] for by faith we see him who is invisible
[1:38:10] choosing to suffer the persecutions and
[1:38:14] the afflictions
[1:38:17] i wouldn't say to people that they
[1:38:19] should choose to
[1:38:21] be afflicted i don't say that you should
[1:38:24] choose
[1:38:24] suffering it would not be the human
[1:38:27] thing to do
[1:38:29] but if suffering lays in the path of
[1:38:31] duty
[1:38:33] then let's take it as it comes
[1:38:35] [Applause]
[1:38:38] i don't want you to do something for
[1:38:40] somebody to make fun of you
[1:38:43] i wouldn't want you to say uh uh
[1:38:45] different things that i'm uh
[1:38:47] i belong to a church that doesn't
[1:38:49] believe in so and so in the worlds and
[1:38:51] things like that
[1:38:53] just to get people to make fun of you
[1:38:56] you're bringing that on yourself i
[1:38:59] wouldn't say for you to get out here and
[1:39:01] carry on and do something that was
[1:39:03] radical
[1:39:05] i wouldn't want you to do that so that
[1:39:07] somebody
[1:39:08] would say that you are a fanatic you
[1:39:11] bring that on yourself
[1:39:13] but if it lays in the path of your duty
[1:39:16] towards god
[1:39:17] let the world say what they want to say
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:23] you make a choice every man and woman
[1:39:27] has to make this
[1:39:28] what if pharaoh could have saw what
[1:39:31] moses saw he saw the sufferings of the
[1:39:35] people
[1:39:36] he knew what the price was to pay but by
[1:39:39] faith
[1:39:40] he chose it rather than to have the
[1:39:43] pleasures of sin
[1:39:46] it's maybe a little young lady sitting
[1:39:48] here that's glamorous young women
[1:39:51] the world would like to say to you do
[1:39:53] dust and dust
[1:39:55] you are beautiful your body is so
[1:39:58] pretty shape you should show that
[1:40:03] but my sister raise up your eyes
[1:40:08] and look beyond that to him that said
[1:40:11] it's an abomination
[1:40:13] for a woman to put on a garment that
[1:40:15] pertains to a man
[1:40:21] if the man of the people in your
[1:40:23] community
[1:40:25] if the women that you associate with
[1:40:28] said
[1:40:28] cut that long hair off
[1:40:32] it would be cooler it would be this that
[1:40:35] or the other or it would become you
[1:40:37] better don't you listen to that
[1:40:41] you lift up your eyes and my face saw
[1:40:44] him that said
[1:40:45] the woman's hair is her glory and she
[1:40:48] shall not cut it
[1:40:52] if they say it would be popular you
[1:40:54] would stand in better with your
[1:40:55] job or with your boss if you take a
[1:40:58] sociable drink
[1:41:00] if you would smoke cigarettes like the
[1:41:02] rest of the women you were standing more
[1:41:04] sociably in your neighborhood
[1:41:08] by faith raise your eyes and look to him
[1:41:11] who said this
[1:41:12] foul this body and i will destroy it
[1:41:17] by faith we believe those things
[1:41:20] it's nothing that you see it's something
[1:41:23] you believe by faith
[1:41:26] moses did and in this faith walk
[1:41:30] there comes a time there has to be a
[1:41:32] choice
[1:41:35] lot made that sad mistake
[1:41:40] that we make a lot of times we choose
[1:41:43] for our own
[1:41:44] good we choose things that would be
[1:41:48] a better sometimes if a little squabble
[1:41:50] comes in the church
[1:41:52] and someone would say well the deacon
[1:41:54] are the pastors on this side
[1:41:57] don't look at that look at what's
[1:42:00] righteous
[1:42:01] get that thing out and bring it both
[1:42:03] together that's godly
[1:42:08] there's a choosing and we choose for
[1:42:11] ourselves
[1:42:12] we choose something that's for our own
[1:42:14] good but moses
[1:42:15] chose the affections and the disgrace
[1:42:18] that he might
[1:42:19] walk with the people of god
[1:42:22] think of it now listen to it
[1:42:26] chose the afflictions of the people of
[1:42:29] god and
[1:42:30] counted it a greater treasure for he
[1:42:32] endured seeing him who was
[1:42:34] invisibly now
[1:42:37] lot one time had to make a choice
[1:42:42] and it may be this morning
[1:42:45] that there will be men and women sitting
[1:42:47] here
[1:42:49] that'll make your final choice
[1:42:53] you are today worry gone in the rapture
[1:42:57] because you made your choice today but
[1:42:59] you've got to choose
[1:43:00] and don't look at what you see choose
[1:43:03] what you see
[1:43:04] by faith that's the only
[1:43:07] thing that will count is what you choose
[1:43:10] by
[1:43:10] faith lot
[1:43:13] as he had to make a choice abraham give
[1:43:17] lot his
[1:43:18] choice and god gives you your choice
[1:43:23] choose you this day who you shall serve
[1:43:25] amen
[1:43:26] in the garden of eden there was a tree
[1:43:28] of of knowledge and a tree of life
[1:43:31] man was given the privilege to choose
[1:43:33] either one he desired
[1:43:36] and so is it today you're giving your
[1:43:39] privilege as free moral agents to choose
[1:43:42] whatever you want to choose
[1:43:45] my advice to you is don't look at the
[1:43:47] modern things around you
[1:43:49] and the popularity and the glamour that
[1:43:51] you could be
[1:43:54] but choose rather than the glamour that
[1:43:56] you could be
[1:43:58] but choose rather by faith him that give
[1:44:02] the promise that someday he will come
[1:44:06] and will write in all wrongs and will
[1:44:09] give you eternal life and raise you up
[1:44:13] no matter if you take the despised way
[1:44:15] with the lord's few
[1:44:17] make that choice
[1:44:20] if there is troubles in the hand if
[1:44:21] there are troubles in the land if
[1:44:22] there's troubles in the church
[1:44:24] if there's troubles in the home
[1:44:27] no matter where it is make your choice
[1:44:30] by
[1:44:31] faith i'll serve god
[1:44:34] i'll humble my heart and his presence
[1:44:37] i'll
[1:44:37] take the way with god's children i see
[1:44:40] them despised and rejected and drove
[1:44:43] out and made fun of it i'll still take
[1:44:45] my post of duty
[1:44:47] amen i'll stay right by and when they
[1:44:50] cry i'll cry
[1:44:51] with them and when they're
[1:44:54] sorrow i shall sorrow with them
[1:44:58] the way they live i'll live like me
[1:45:01] almost said aru said to me alma
[1:45:05] your ways be my ways my ways be your
[1:45:08] ways
[1:45:08] where you live i live where you go i'll
[1:45:11] go
[1:45:12] the god that you serve will be my god
[1:45:15] take that choice though it pulls the
[1:45:18] very skin off of your conscience
[1:45:22] of thinking that you're somebody skin
[1:45:25] yourself down
[1:45:26] and take your away with the lord's
[1:45:28] despised you
[1:45:30] and stay live on the field
[1:45:34] of service and at the post of duty
[1:45:38] lot looked around he said i got a choice
[1:45:42] and he looked towards sodom
[1:45:46] he saw the good grassy fields were
[1:45:48] better
[1:45:49] than what abraham saw and where abraham
[1:45:52] was
[1:45:54] he saw the opportunities to graze his
[1:45:56] cattle i have
[1:45:58] fatter and better cattle
[1:46:02] i hope i'm not hurting anyone's feeling
[1:46:06] but that's been the stand of too many
[1:46:08] preachers
[1:46:11] to compromise with the gospel
[1:46:15] thinking if they get more money out of
[1:46:16] it
[1:46:18] a meal ticket i'd rather live in the
[1:46:21] barren land
[1:46:23] drink from a bridge and eat soda
[1:46:25] crackers
[1:46:26] than a compromise upon the conviction of
[1:46:28] my
[1:46:29] faith in the word of the living god
[1:46:32] i'll take my way some of them said billy
[1:46:36] what's the matter with your meetings as
[1:46:38] there's too many pentecostals
[1:46:40] ahead a great denominational minister
[1:46:43] said that
[1:46:44] i said will your denomination sponsor my
[1:46:46] meeting
[1:46:49] not long ago in the look magazine i
[1:46:51] believe
[1:46:52] there was an article and the writer said
[1:46:55] there's
[1:46:55] talked about the pentecostal people he
[1:46:58] said the pentecostal church
[1:47:01] is the fastest growing church in the
[1:47:03] world today
[1:47:05] why it's because men and women has
[1:47:08] raised up their eyes
[1:47:10] they look far off and the writer also
[1:47:14] complimented the pentecostal people
[1:47:16] oh of course he said there were some of
[1:47:18] them that went radically and so forth
[1:47:20] but the methodist worship a creed they
[1:47:22] worship god by a creed
[1:47:24] the baptist does the same in the
[1:47:26] presbyterians but the pentecostal
[1:47:29] worships by his
[1:47:30] bible by faith we see the promise
[1:47:36] i'll take my lot with them no matter how
[1:47:39] much they're despised i'm still around
[1:47:41] them
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:44] though they be made fun of and have
[1:47:45] their ups and downs as
[1:47:47] israel did i'll never want to stand
[1:47:50] with the false prophet on the hill side
[1:47:54] of balaam and try to curse what god has
[1:47:57] blessed
[1:47:58] because in that camp is a smitten rock
[1:48:03] have a bloody sacrifice and a pillar of
[1:48:06] fire
[1:48:07] no matter what they're in it's leading
[1:48:09] them home to victory and they've got to
[1:48:11] come to it because
[1:48:12] they are the promised people that's
[1:48:14] walking by
[1:48:15] faith though they be not a denomination
[1:48:17] they were wonders around and so is the
[1:48:19] people of god
[1:48:20] but i want to take my way with them
[1:48:24] join up with them in their ranks not in
[1:48:27] their denomination
[1:48:28] but in their fellowship around the
[1:48:31] articles of
[1:48:32] god's eternal spirit which by faith i
[1:48:35] have received
[1:48:36] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:48:39] god help me to always have that attitude
[1:48:43] notice as they moved on
[1:48:47] we find that launch saw the
[1:48:50] opportunities
[1:48:52] for a fatted cattle many see the
[1:48:55] opportunities of a fatted pocketbook
[1:48:58] man he sees the opportunities of a
[1:49:00] better social standing
[1:49:03] he saw the possibilities of a few extra
[1:49:06] dollars
[1:49:07] he saw the possibilities of being the
[1:49:09] mayor of the city
[1:49:11] being a stranger and a pretty smart man
[1:49:13] as he was
[1:49:14] maybe i will become the chief man of the
[1:49:17] city he saw the possibilities
[1:49:19] because they were laying before him
[1:49:23] but he did not see the fire that was to
[1:49:26] destroy the land
[1:49:29] he did not reconcile himself that the
[1:49:33] land was full of
[1:49:34] sin and god had to destroy it
[1:49:37] and today people try to reconcile
[1:49:39] himself and say are you i say are you a
[1:49:41] christian they say i'm an american
[1:49:44] that has no more to do with it and try
[1:49:46] to say to a crow that he was a frog
[1:49:49] it has nothing to do with it
[1:49:53] she's going to be destroyed because god
[1:49:56] is
[1:49:56] just amen and if america gets by with
[1:50:00] her sins
[1:50:01] the just and sovereign holy god will be
[1:50:04] duty boundary
[1:50:05] to resurrect sodom and gomorrah and
[1:50:07] apologize to them
[1:50:09] for bringing him up because of their sin
[1:50:12] he lets us get by with him if he lets
[1:50:15] you get to heaven
[1:50:18] on your injustice works
[1:50:22] you'll have to raise up ananias and
[1:50:24] survive and give them another
[1:50:26] opportunity
[1:50:29] he certainly would but he's just
[1:50:33] and i saw his money peter saw christ
[1:50:42] oh my lot didn't see the destruction of
[1:50:45] these children in that place
[1:50:48] many of you they holding around these
[1:50:49] old formal creeds and things
[1:50:51] you don't see the juvenile delinquency
[1:50:53] and the destruction of your children
[1:50:56] you don't see your daughter in a
[1:50:58] prostitute house you don't see your son
[1:51:00] a drunkard or at a card table somewhere
[1:51:03] because she's well watered in sin is not
[1:51:06] touched
[1:51:10] he didn't see his wife the head of all
[1:51:12] the societies turned to a pillar of salt
[1:51:14] when he was looking
[1:51:17] he didn't see him escaping only by the
[1:51:19] edge of his teeth
[1:51:21] to a little city somewhere for his life
[1:51:24] he didn't see that because he only
[1:51:26] looked at what he saw
[1:51:27] in front of him but
[1:51:32] abraham
[1:51:34] didn't notice the well-watered lamb for
[1:51:37] he lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:51:39] tomorrow
[1:51:42] for he had inherit all things
[1:51:45] the real christian today lifts up his
[1:51:47] eyes and sees the promise of christ
[1:51:50] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:51:52] inherit all things
[1:51:54] they shall be heard here we are the real
[1:51:57] christian by faith
[1:51:59] looks up and sees that him what you want
[1:52:01] to
[1:52:03] he lifted up his eyes
[1:52:06] and when he did that god said abraham
[1:52:08] walk through the land
[1:52:09] she's all yours amen amen by faith
[1:52:13] abraham did this
[1:52:16] the same faith that moses had
[1:52:19] it was wrote by one commentator that
[1:52:21] said this i thought it was most
[1:52:23] beautiful words but
[1:52:26] abraham moses took the best
[1:52:30] of the world and put it in one scale
[1:52:34] and the worst out religion and put it in
[1:52:36] the other scale
[1:52:38] and the worst of religion outweigh the
[1:52:41] best of the world
[1:52:44] so is it today that if we be called
[1:52:47] anything we want to be called fanatics
[1:52:49] or
[1:52:50] divine healers or holy roma or whatever
[1:52:52] they want to call
[1:52:53] the worst that we are will outweigh the
[1:52:56] best the world can afford
[1:52:59] you want to be called old-fashioned old
[1:53:02] fogey fanatic
[1:53:04] it'll outweigh the best thing that the
[1:53:06] devil's got to offer you
[1:53:08] amen it most surely will
[1:53:12] moses esteem
[1:53:15] the reproach of christ he foresaw christ
[1:53:19] later he spoke some mighty inspiring
[1:53:21] words about him
[1:53:23] see the lord your god shall rise up a
[1:53:25] prophet like unto me
[1:53:28] he knew he's foresaw him and he esteemed
[1:53:32] his reproach greater riches than all the
[1:53:35] glamour of the world
[1:53:38] christian friend today can't you do that
[1:53:42] but all the glamour and popularity of
[1:53:44] the world by
[1:53:45] faith we see him who promised
[1:53:48] and the worst of the church today in all
[1:53:50] of its condition
[1:53:51] yet it'll outweigh everything the devil
[1:53:54] can offer you
[1:53:56] if we are tore up if we are broke to
[1:53:58] pieces
[1:53:59] if we are confused and broke up into
[1:54:01] nominations and fanaticism
[1:54:03] it'll outweigh anything the devil can
[1:54:06] offer
[1:54:07] certainly he has seen the reproach of
[1:54:11] christ
[1:54:12] greater riches than all the treasures of
[1:54:14] egypt
[1:54:16] then he had to do something he forsook
[1:54:19] egypt
[1:54:21] oh i love that word he forsunk egypt
[1:54:26] see he was looking through the same
[1:54:27] window but he was looking different from
[1:54:30] favor what a pharaoh could have seen
[1:54:31] he's in
[1:54:32] what if pharaoh would have seen his
[1:54:33] nation drowning moses saw it how
[1:54:37] by science by faith moses saw it
[1:54:41] everything that he did was by faith
[1:54:45] because god promised abraham
[1:54:48] his father that he would he would visit
[1:54:51] this nation after 400 years
[1:54:53] and would bring him out and by faith
[1:54:55] moses believe the word that god said
[1:54:58] and note himself as by faith to be the
[1:55:01] chosen leader
[1:55:02] to bring them he knew where he was
[1:55:05] he took his place in the slime pits as a
[1:55:08] mud dauber
[1:55:10] and counted the reproach of christ
[1:55:13] greater riches than to settle the throne
[1:55:15] of egypt
[1:55:17] he never just said i sympathize with him
[1:55:19] he
[1:55:20] took their place and went with them
[1:55:23] amen
[1:55:26] he took their place we went with them
[1:55:31] no one of the inspired writers said i'll
[1:55:34] take the way with the lord's despised
[1:55:37] you

[1:55:42] through
[1:55:44] i'm on my way to canaan's land
[1:55:49] sure moses
[1:55:52] it was said by one that moses
[1:55:57] had rather when he could have been the
[1:56:00] son
[1:56:01] of payroll and had the clamor of the
[1:56:04] world
[1:56:04] he'd rather be a son of abraham
[1:56:08] than to be the son of pharaoh amen a son
[1:56:11] of abraham to despise
[1:56:13] that it be son of pharaoh the king i'd
[1:56:16] rather be the son
[1:56:17] of the lord jesus and his fellow
[1:56:20] servants
[1:56:20] and take my place with the rejected
[1:56:22] people of this world
[1:56:24] and to be president of this great united
[1:56:26] states of america

[1:56:39] stand to be in a
[1:56:41] a mary pitford or some great movie star
[1:56:44] some glamour girl
[1:56:45] take your way with the lord's despised
[1:56:48] you i'd rather be a preacher in the
[1:56:51] pulpit
[1:56:52] preaching the unsearchable riches of
[1:56:54] christ than to be a hollywood movie star
[1:56:57] or the greatest person on the earth if i
[1:56:59] had to eat
[1:57:00] meager bed or whatever i had to do i'll
[1:57:03] take my way with the lord's people
[1:57:06] by faith i do that
[1:57:10] i've been offered opportunities but by
[1:57:12] god's grace

[1:58:19] feared
[1:58:20] not the wrath of the king
[1:58:23] i humanly he had a right to fear the
[1:58:25] wrath
[1:58:26] he had a right to fear the wrath of the
[1:58:28] king but he didn't
[1:58:30] he did not do it because he had a job to
[1:58:33] do and he was in a line of duty

[2:05:35] stronger that's right brother
[2:05:38] and god required it again even of him
[2:05:40] back there what does god require of us
[2:05:43] to stand he took that stand what stance
[2:05:45] should we take
[2:05:46] now i tell you brother sister that
[2:05:48] there's a lot more going on there now
[2:05:50] than was back in 1958 oh yes
[2:05:54] and yet he saw so much that he just took
[2:05:57] his stand
[2:05:58] by faith moses just thinking
[2:06:02] that god took took that subject by faith
[2:06:05] moses and he expanded on it
[2:06:07] expanded got it bigger and bigger and
[2:06:10] bigger
[2:06:11] he brought out this about moses amen but
[2:06:14] then he applied it to that hour that he
[2:06:15] was living
[2:06:16] we can apply to the hour that we're
[2:06:17] living oh by faith moses did this by
[2:06:19] faith moses did that
[2:06:21] brother and the faith that moses had god
[2:06:23] requires of us
[2:06:24] to stand that moses took god requires it
[2:06:27] of us
[2:06:28] in these last days again and of course
[2:06:31] we're living in a different hour
[2:06:32] different age
[2:06:33] and and brother what moses endured is
[2:06:37] one thing what you and i would have to
[2:06:39] endure as another
[2:06:40] oh yeah so as he went on and on and on
[2:06:44] brother and by faith what what do you
[2:06:46] mean
[2:06:47] well he had that faith and did this well
[2:06:49] he just went as the lord led him as the
[2:06:51] lord revealed this to him lord reveal
[2:06:53] that to him
[2:06:53] he just went on and did it amen he
[2:06:56] didn't he didn't
[2:06:57] he didn't mind this he didn't mind that
[2:06:59] whatever the will of god was
[2:07:01] but now lot was different totally
[2:07:04] different
[2:07:04] because lot was looking for oh looking
[2:07:06] for oh
[2:07:08] a good life natural life he want he
[2:07:10] wanted riches he wanted god to do this
[2:07:12] god do that god bless me here god bless
[2:07:15] me there
[2:07:15] and that's why when uh oh that when god
[2:07:18] god
[2:07:19] remember god would not deal with moses
[2:07:22] until lot was taken away and a lot was
[2:07:25] taken out of his presence then god came
[2:07:26] down
[2:07:27] oh yeah then god came down and and spoke
[2:07:30] to moses
[2:07:31] he said moses come up here and i want to
[2:07:34] show you look
[2:07:35] i'm going to give you all this land and
[2:07:37] so on that was after a
[2:07:39] and and moses separated so brother i
[2:07:42] pray grace in the name of jesus
[2:07:44] that we're not going to not going to rob
[2:07:46] ourselves of the blessings of god
[2:07:47] enter the blessings of god why because
[2:07:50] we're going to get too involved with
[2:07:51] this too involved with that to involve
[2:07:52] with family or or friends you know
[2:07:55] oh yeah but you got to take your stand
[2:07:58] because it's like when back
[2:08:01] years ago as as i was in in the word in
[2:08:05] the message and
[2:08:06] you know feasting on the lord feasting
[2:08:08] on the word and feasting on the message
[2:08:10] we when we travel we went to see this
[2:08:12] brother this sister this one believer
[2:08:14] and that believer and so on
[2:08:16] and and we have fellowship and and in
[2:08:18] particular
[2:08:19] let me mention that brother and sister
[2:08:21] burns and so on
[2:08:22] oh my the times that we would go and
[2:08:25] visit brothers in the barn visit brother
[2:08:26] sister burns
[2:08:28] but yet
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:32] there was a natural part of my family
[2:08:34] that was jealous of it
[2:08:36] and rebuked me that
[2:08:40] oh yeah when you come by you just drop
[2:08:42] in for to see us and so on
[2:08:44] but then you go on down to mr mrs barnes
[2:08:47] you're spending all your time with them
[2:08:49] and so on and and they were saying oh
[2:08:52] but
[2:08:52] where your where your family naturally
[2:08:55] exactly
[2:08:56] they were but not spiritually even
[2:08:59] though
[2:08:59] they were christian and professing
[2:09:01] christian and go to a certain
[2:09:02] denominational church and i i didn't
[2:09:04] blast anything like that among them we
[2:09:06] just we
[2:09:07] if we had fellowship we go in and
[2:09:09] fellowship with
[2:09:10] with them or maybe have a meal with them
[2:09:12] but then we get up and we go on
[2:09:14] to brother and sister barnes why because
[2:09:17] our relationship was it was eternal
[2:09:21] our relationship with them was spiritual
[2:09:24] whereas our relationship with the other
[2:09:26] members of the family was just natural
[2:09:28] just natural and we were witnesses yes
[2:09:31] they knew our stand
[2:09:32] and so on and so but still we stayed
[2:09:35] with
[2:09:37] brother and sister burns oh yeah and i
[2:09:39] remember one time
[2:09:41] that we went out and visited them and we
[2:09:43] took a our pet
[2:09:45] it was a cat with us oh yeah
[2:09:48] and and we we decided to stay i might
[2:09:51] have been staying at night
[2:09:52] with with that family natural family
[2:09:55] and so on but the pet we had the cat
[2:10:01] wasn't at peace it wasn't at rest oh i
[2:10:04] it was just
[2:10:06] going around and just couldn't couldn't
[2:10:08] couldn't find any peace or any rest
[2:10:10] anything at all in that in that place
[2:10:14] so but the next day we did when we got
[2:10:16] up and after everything was done
[2:10:18] and greeted them and so we moved on to
[2:10:21] our brother and sister burns
[2:10:23] oh yeah and we went in yeah and
[2:10:26] we were in no time we we also had our at
[2:10:29] our pet
[2:10:30] there and our cat and all of a sudden
[2:10:32] the cat was missing
[2:10:34] i said where is he we all went looking
[2:10:36] for her
[2:10:37] and she was on the chesterfield sleep
[2:10:40] she found rest
[2:10:41] and peace there just think even an
[2:10:44] animal
[2:10:45] knew the difference even an animal
[2:10:47] sensed it
[2:10:48] oh yeah because in another place nor
[2:10:51] couldn't could for some time
[2:10:52] for something that she could the the pet
[2:10:55] couldn't couldn't
[2:10:56] rest oh yeah but when we got to brother
[2:10:59] sister burns oh my
[2:11:00] the atmosphere was different by the
[2:11:03] grace of god
[2:11:04] amen so brother oh yes i'm sure that we
[2:11:07] could
[2:11:08] that the brother brennan would say hey
[2:11:09] man brother i agree with that
[2:11:11] you know amen so you know brother if
[2:11:15] and if if an animal would discern it and
[2:11:17] recognize it
[2:11:18] how much our way to recognize
[2:11:21] amen that presence by the grace of
[2:11:24] almighty god
[2:11:25] amen and i still we still have
[2:11:28] company with our families natural
[2:11:30] families and they enjoy it they're glad
[2:11:32] and so on
[2:11:33] and as i said if we were to go in and
[2:11:35] they oh they were glad to see us coming
[2:11:37] and
[2:11:38] if they had their television on they
[2:11:40] turn it off yeah when we come in and
[2:11:42] they
[2:11:43] just leave it off as long as we're there
[2:11:45] or they weren't offended but
[2:11:46] they weren't offended by that they were
[2:11:48] just glad to have our have some time
[2:11:49] with us
[2:11:50] amen and we were there just just to be a
[2:11:52] witness
[2:11:53] by the grace of god and not necessarily
[2:11:56] with the message or doctrines of this
[2:11:58] no by the life you live by the spirit
[2:12:01] and attitude that you express and that
[2:12:03] you have oh yes
[2:12:04] they'll recognize that oh yeah your
[2:12:07] natural family
[2:12:08] they'll know that your spirit is
[2:12:09] different your attitude is different
[2:12:11] your motives and objective is different
[2:12:13] but at the same time they know that you
[2:12:15] respect them for who they are naturally
[2:12:17] and so on
[2:12:18] so i pray the grace of god help us
[2:12:20] brother don't let
[2:12:22] those things amen interfere with your
[2:12:24] relationship
[2:12:26] with with the word listen
