Lord that that were not going to lose the revelation in the name of Jesus that were not going to lose what our relationship with you but praying grace of God in the name of Jesus that the Holy Ghost is present a man Parrinello to to increase an increase in increase our relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ our relationship with God our relationship with the word so what irony that we truly be the sons and daughters of God led by the Spirit of God Alleluia so we committed all into your care and asked for the grace of God with us here the grace of God with our brothers and sisters online the grace of God with the Bride of Christ around the world father as we near the end of all things father knowing Lord that we're approaching the change nor that we're approaching the resurrection we're approaching the rapture we pray the grace of God in the name of Jesus that we will not lose the faith amen that you have given us in this hour a man to do what you want us to do with this hour a man so there's Alleluia to bring it to pass Lord the Word of God that the dead in Christ will rise first and we were trying remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air so lord

the world and our greatest need Lord is the resurrection our greatest need is the rapture grace O Lord to move us on for your glory your honor your priests in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen lord I believe Lord I [Music] yes [Music] amen Lord bless you turn with me to first Corinthians 13 a familiar scripture that I want to read and connect back to some of the things that our brother Ben has ministered to us over the weekend on Friday Saturday and Sunday and God bless our brothers ministry amen wherever he might be at this time Amen we look forward to having our brother eventually visit with us a man and des Minister personally face-to-face and not just not just online so the grace of God be with us for the glory of God and ask you yes to continue to remember the Saints in prayer and a to remember brother cars assembly because they understand there might be two in that assembly that does have the covet 19 problem in their in their beans so we pray the grace of God to our brother car at this time and our brother Carmen whose brother cars assisted right there and brother car as I say 90 or 92 but he's still ministry and he's still active well it's amazing now if you saw him online that he wouldn't look like someone 90 years old but he is a nanny and not talking like somebody 90 years old but he is so pray the grace of God to brother to brother a car and also to brother Carmen and we have been hoping to get our brother Carmen to come visit us but because of the Cobra 19 issue he had to cancel his flight here and there was also I think as three other places that he was planning to go and he had to cancel them as well so when this is passed we pray the grace of God to open the way for our brother Carmen to come and minister to us and just keep him in prayer and I'm not sure it was once somebody there might have been his wife and Mary Lee sister Maryland sheds I think she was supposed to have surgery whether or not she's still at it or not I'm not sure but we pray the grace of God to Mary Lynn and also the others their brother Mark mentioned as well that at surgery and in your sister at surgery twice and brother Barry twice well the grace of God be with them a man so keep them in prayer because listen because brother sister this is the hour for for healing sure because the prophecy if you can't believe it for healing how you going to believe for the rapture a man so god help us to believe for the healing of our bodies question what for were believed for the change of our bodies by the grace of Almighty God so let's let's press on and fight the devil amen and it is the devil not early he know he knows this is the time for the resurrection he knows this is time for the rapture that's why yes and he's tried to hinder it he's trying to stop it so brother sister remember when we experiencing those things is Satan a man so get away get thee behind me Satan a man he was tempting Jesus he tempts them right to a man so the grace of God be with us is our prayer so we're not looking for Satan to do this Satan to do that well I can do this and I can do that and I'll give you this now I'll give you that yeah well look for look for God's blessings not the devil's a man so the grace of God be with us and yes to say that we welcome our brother Chad yes because we've missed him quite a bit since this this issue has been going on and and we've only had five in the service here and then now it Stan a van and and even if everybody goes up to 20 I don't know if we can arrange that because you got to be still going to be six feet apart and so on so we're gonna leave it all with the Lord a van or we'd have to go rent another church amen because many of the churches are are there large churches especially are they are closed they don't have five people gathered there or ten people gathered there they did some of them are closed and I spoke with one gentleman and he said always said I went to visit two churches and he said there wasn't nobody not not one person there and even though they're allowed to have five 1.10 at another point but no they just closed it but I prayed but the Bride of Christ doesn't want it closed a man by the Christ as our brother prayed brother Chad prayed that's right yeah right we want the fellowship all to get to come back into the church and we want the fellowship with one another amen by the grace of God so god help us is my prayer and Anna yes brother brother because why - you can't fellowship with Jesus unless your fellowship one another its Christ in Christ in the earth flesh a man is Christ in my flesh he's revealed in you reveal of me and a fellowship of me and I got a felt straight with you of Mebane fellowship with Jesus a man for the grace of God be with us amen to really have the revelation that God wants us to have in this hour do we have it in our heads and I just been not just our heads but in our hearts a man what God wants us to have a man so God is looking at the Holy Ghost in us and not just not just a whole not just in our ain't my entire our souls rather but in our heads so that he's in control amen is the Holy Ghost in control that's the question we want to answer tonight and I've got some scriptures that we want to break bring out to show you if the Holy Ghost is in control this is the life you live a man so brothers you talk about an hour an hour that we need to make our colony on electric shore is this hour amen brother you what you want to be sure you're going into resurrection we really need to rapture make our called an election shore because it is it is the elect or I called to go into the rapture amen by the grace of God a million and you're not oh don't say tell me yours brother brother ben was bringing it out don't tell me you're elect just because you're saying oh I'm in the message and I believe that what the Bible says about the rapture I believe this I believe that no no no it's got to be in you a mayor it's not just you and the message you the message guardian you see I brought that quote out where the problem of God said always would you say you're in the message yeah he said but he said the message is not in you and he was preaching that to believers a man and I tell her this very few on the earth tonight we're in the the messages in there many in the message and I would say maybe I remember hearing our brother Perry green Greg give a give a quote of a number then he said there's a route 2 million people he said around the world that are professing this message that was many years ago how many is it there tonight a man there might be three million but I tell you it's not 3 million going in a rapture god help us those who make their calling and election sure are going into rapture god help us anybody it's more than just saying I'm in the message brother the message the word is made flesh in you a man is it well that's what you've got make your call and election short that's what you're doing making sure that the word is fleshing you not just in your head but it's in your heart and controlling you receivers controlling you because if if it's in your head your flesh controls you it was in your heart the word controls you will see who's controlling you our brother Benton was bringing those things out and it was good I thought well Lord praise the Lord and he was confirming as a word vindicated some things that I was already preaching a manner I already bleached old lately a man so I thank God for that a man so god bless our brother Ben and God bless the word that he ministered I pray in your art he meant not in your head in your heart amen in 1st Corinthians 13 and verse one though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity which is divine law many of the message but they don't have divine love many in the message but they don't have the baptism of divine love and though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity or divine love I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal a man-god elbows that were not sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal a man and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries amazing and all knowledge make our calling and election sure and though I have all faith this is amazing this is absolutely a challenge to our relationship with God and though I have faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor just think I'm nothing yet in our eyes we think were something in our eyes everything was spiritual in our eyes we think we believe this we believe that but it's only in our heads pray Grayson it's in our hearts by divine love and he said though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing amazing because why because charity suffered long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up definitely not if charity does anything it humbles you divine love and it says does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked and thinketh no evil the grace of God read it again verse 5 it does not be behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil God grant us divine love a double portion and it says rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth amen we're not going to rejoin them no matter who it is whether we're not going to rejoice over this one feels good that one feels good and it might be the result of sin in their life on belief in their life but we're not going to rejoice in that we're not going to all praise the Lord that's wonderful God has blessed you this god bless you there and so on no no no no better make your calling and election sure so he rejoiceth not in iniquity or unbelief but it rejoices in the truth and a beareth all things Oh God have mercy on us beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things by the grace of God charity or divine love never faileth but whether they be prophecies they shall fail whether to be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away grace God is bringing us to perfection why was that by a perfect faith as the prophet of God preached the message perfect faith and he said it's ordained for what it's ordained he said we got to have it he said because he said we're going to need it for the rapture amen so God has given us perfect faith not just for justification or sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost but for the rapture a man the crowning of what God has done down through the ages praise the Lord but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known God helped us and now abideth Faith Hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity god bless his words you may be seated the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine love amen charity and not in our heads but in our hearts by the grace of God turn with me to the galatians chapter 2 and in Galatians chapter 2 verse 16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ a man so brother I got to have the faith of Jesus Christ a man to believe God and to believe the word as Jesus believed a man why - because brother sister a man because what he did in the flesh 2,000 years ago he's going to do now a man when it comes to he laid down his life for us and he picked it up again now we're gonna lay down our lives for him and pick it up again in resurrection and rat-free glory praise the name of the Lord so knowing this that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified amen but that's why I've got to be in Christ and Christ in me because God is looking for that faith that perfect faith that pleases him and Jesus came and manifested that faith a man and that and brother he laid down his life and picked it up again and all those for the age of the prophets that faith paid faith they did this they did that but they lay down their lives but they didn't pick it up again because they were born in sin a man and not able to manifest the faith that God was looking for that God would come in flesh and he would manifest that faith himself a man that he would be the example that he would be that he would expect to see in the end time bride they met because he said I will restore save the Lord I'm going to do this I'm going to do that he started out with it in the in the first ages that were and oh yeah they believe this is they believe that a man they're looking for the resurrection looking with a rapture but a man but the enemy God so this darkness there and increase it and increased it increased it but God did gave a promise he said I'm going to restore a man and God allowed it and God permitted it priestly a man this is not just just don't think oh that's the devil he did this he did that brother the devil can't do anything without God's permission a man but a God God is going to let him do this God's going to let him do that and brother even in our in our day to day living brother you got are you got to deal with the devil and sometimes God is going to allow Satan to tempt you here tap you there what for is to bring out your faith a man is to bring out the faith of Christ in you a man just raised for me is not neither lives as Christ liveth in me by the ground he's going to prove it amen hallelujah brother he experienced this he experienced that when he was in the flesh himself Amen praise the name of the Lord oh yeah brother I tell you this just just assured that it was God in flesh brother when he would when he went out there at 30 years old and the devil came and tempted him and the devil did the devil tempted where they attempt him with that and he should need to get thee behind me Satan though shall not tempt the LORD thy God amen Oh Ted God the Father no there with him God was in the flesh a man the father came down and they in the form of the son though should not tempt the Lord they got a man or if you're this if you're there you can do this you can do that amen he knew who he was and he was trying to get Jesus to do it there to do this and do that he's a choice authority over Jesus a man but Jesus had authority go for him he bad sir brother sister and he allows Satan to come and attempt you he allows this to happen maybe in your life sometimes he's allowing something to have it in somebody else's life exactly to bring out your spirit to bring out your attitude a man a man sir do you have the Spirit of Christ do you have the attitude of Jesus amen hello sister this one he like that and that was something that says something else is somebody else a man brother sister why godly God knows this just read this in you and he's going to manifest it a man whether it's a spirit or whether it's the devil and who's influencing you more and more than anything else in this world is it going to be Jesus or is it Satan a man sir brother I pray the grace of God that we got the anointing of the Holy Ghost same again brother if you got the anointing of the Holy Ghost you got the wisdom of God amen it was in your heart you got the wisdom of God and I just seen your head because if you're Eve is in your head a man the devil will cost you two reasons you remember that cuz that's a prophecy he said this is the devil's Watchtower he said it's your brain and he said the soul the heart he said this is God's Watchtower amen so brother what's in control is your hater your brother your soul is it your reasoning up here in the head or a series of their faith in the soul the revelation of the will of God on the inside of the inside brother there's many a believer brother this guy's got one God and God the anointing got the word got the message up here but they don't have it in here amen that's the part of God said you're in the message but the message is not a you a man sir but I pray the grace of God that we got it in our hearts not in our heads a man we cast down reasoning the devil one of Jesus the reason the devil wants us to reason and that's why God allow this and now that judges to get us a reason a man and all the flesh we feel this we feel that we know this we know that we got knowledge but again we read it there and you know you could have all knowledge to understand all this you can have all faith to do this and this or this but if you don't have divine love it's all vain a man this is absolutely amazing brother and again there's things that I want to bring out when I get to that message on the anointing ones at the end time but it because when I went back to that message and I begin to think on things in that message and and the focus on what the prophet of God was saying I salute my lord I say this all my lord I said helpless Oh Lord Alba's I say that we're going to have the true anointing of the Holy Ghost and not only in our heads were have it in our hearts and oh hey man and Lord that our motives are gonna be right or objectives are go to right hey man and Lord brave man so there your your that your the Lord you're controlling it a man and not not our feelings your control you're not the devil you can add the true and knowing of the Holy Ghost and brother you can be under Satan's influence that is the absolute truth oh is that true is that right did the prophet of God really say that yes he is warning the people and he feel absolutely felt he said I fear Lee and his message was in July of 1965 and he actually felt lit of the Lord he because it took to get here take this truth to the Saints to give this to the professing believers because he felt that they whether we needed to know this we needed to understand this right should be on our guard amen and to make our County and election sure not to grow to say well I got the Holy Ghost because I was baptized in his name I got the Holy Ghost because all I do this and I do that and I wouldn't do this and I wouldn't do that by the way sure where we'll see what you would do wouldn't do it's right there in the word oh yeah our brother then made reference to to to it not not not he didn't take it all but he just made reference to it to one article there but there's many a man and we'll see we'll see if we really got the Holy Ghost in control of us in our hearts oh yeah again like I said the part of God is bringing it out in the anointing ones at the end time that you can have the anointing in your head you could add the anointing in your flesh and he said you could have the Holy Ghost she said on you he said you know where you could have experienced the Holy Ghost 24 hours a day he said I go to hell Amen so if I got the Holy Ghost and it's just outward twenty-four hours a day amen what if what is what I said what influence does the Holy Ghost had on me amen you'll have a certain amount of influence but not all amen and Satan he said we'll be there to control pet influence amen oh my god the Holy Ghost but he said the God will allow this to happen God allow that to happen a man just to bring out whether it's in your head or in your heart a million with a man and what's authority and control do you have over Satan now much controlling a fairy and there's oh it's a Satan have over us as individuals brothers sister the grace of God because God said I'm going to restore he said because it because the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God was leaving and then the influence of shame was getting greater and greater and greater and so great that brother sister with me I like this again that the public god brother sister when the pillar of fire drew this on the wall in Brenham tabernacle when the proud of God was preaching the church ages the pillar fire came in and he went over to the truth of the wall there and he drew this on the wall this is where the power of God got it yeah and but he said I don't know and the people did see the light but they were looking this way and the problem of God said no he said he said you're looking the wrong way so you're looking at the reflection a man he said but he said the pillar fires right here oh yeah and many there's many brother looking at the reflection of the message not the real thing hey man and brother and this is what they a day a true on the wall but but they were looking over here and he was over there the pillar of fire was drawn on the wall of the seven church ages and the brother God said I said but I want you to sit notice he said that when he drew this he said it was all black amen anyway he said brother bound put that in the areas of the red to represent the brain age he put that in there to represent of the revealed word and what God was promising in these last days through Malachi 4 and he said there was really a little bit of they're what for it is to give the Buried wrap tree faith it is to give us the revelation or you can understand this and you can understand that you can believe that God sent a prophet you can believe that the stable seals are open and you can believe the mystery of God is revealed and go to hell amen why because it all comes down to Christ in you Christ in Nate the hope of glory amen it comes down to us not me that lives this crease that liveth in me amen amen soul body and spirit that is Christ liveth in me amen oh boy oh you mean to tell me you're not going to make no mistakes yes you'll make mistakes but again it crises and yeah you're going to do be right there to repent right there to call the Lord forgive me I want to keep pressing on Jesus amen you'll forgive you you'll be there amen if Christ is in your heart amen and you do sin and you do this all you would have a mighty conviction amen maybe and there will be a tremendous repentance by the grace of God so brother God was real it was restoring it and bringing it back and bringing it back and bring it back the light through through through through Martin Luther and so on and on down I had to bring it by Louis before brother Gant our brother but you been we're bringing it up and he talked about just st. a justification strain to the occasion baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen oh well praise that all I got the bathroom of the Holy Ghost and I got the gifts of the Spirit I could do this and I can do that well brother we just read it in in 1st Corinthians 13 you can do this and you could do that but you don't have the baptism in your soul divine love the bedroom of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine love because God is love a man and game what does love project log projects Grace and well there's grace project faith amen so brother no no it's not just say I got I got this faith I got their faith and to us faith is a revelation I got this revelation of that revelation not all it is more than that let's go back to see where that revelation is coming from and is it out of your soul or is it out of your hand amen Israel you're just gotta get you were just there and when the anointing comes down and you get this and you get that yeah there's one brother there got the anointing in his soul and the other one is sitting next to him got it in his head oh yeah and they're both rejoicing over the word oh yeah that's wonderful I believe that I believe that yeah but he won't let the Holy Ghost when he further than his mind not into his soul but for the true believer it go down indeed your suburban dust goes down into the soul by the grace of God amen so brother sister again as our brother beam was bringing out because she are sons God does this because your sons God does that because your son's God is going to test you God is gonna try you God is going to bring out a man the attributes of true sons and daughters of God he made he's not going to God's not there just to make everything good and everything easy for you and he could to bless you and he's gonna do this sometimes he'll put you right down oh yeah they're there those that you love raise up well yeah well that's they got that anointing they got that spirit they got that attitude but then there's others even though they're sons of God God got a deal with this spirit that spirit and he'll dropped you and drop you and drop you hey man but then after a while he knows your seat of God he's gonna bring you back up a mate he's not gonna leave you down no no is there a reason see brother sister see summer tempted this way summer tempted that way summer tested this way other attested that way amen it seemed like we wonder Lord why is it that I'm tested so much like this and that brother is not tested that sister's not tested love like that but yet they still got that faith that pleases God amen and got to attest to us some digest you or test somebody else or tested just me look for you get us get us two more and more they trust him more and more love him more and more servant die more and more flesh and they come more and more alive to Jesus amen but we need even more and more sensitive to God more and more sensitive to the Holy Ghost and less and less and less sensitive to the feelings of our body hey man brother that's the truth amen and I believe our brother our brother Ben was hitting on those things and he was bringing out those things because he brought out certain scriptures but we'll read those scripture said but not just one one he just referenced it but not not bringing out and reading does this verse from this verse and this verse a man will do that show you what's in control of your life yours is it oh it's the Holy Ghost yeah but it does he have full control out of your heart or is it just in your head and giving you revelation this this yeah her brother brought that out when he showed us the books oh yeah should they believe this they believe that yeah but it's in the book about in their heart yeah it's the same thing where there's a lot of things here in the Bible but if you're baptized with the Holy Ghost in your heart amen what you believe is on the inside of the inside and it is eternal life amen and again this night you two lives is Christ living in you amen in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us hey man in other words made flesh in US a man oh god help us brother sister to get more and more and more amen under the control of the word under the control of the Holy Ghost in our souls oh yeah because a Dina Esther don't be an adjuster of false anointed one and brother a foster 91 it's not the Ananya's false no no not the Ananya false is the teaching amen father God brings it out oh yeah yeah they got they got a true anointing and he got this and he got that but all of a sudden he said you find they're teaching what they're teaching is not right it's a false teaching a man and brother we got a lot much of a brother in every age God God has had to deal with it God revealed the word and there was Luther but after Luther became those that made a denomination out of it oh yeah and they went on preaching justification justification amen but then God had move on move on and there was Wesley and the public Gossage is just three generations later and he said they'd innominate yeah three generations how many generations as their bed since they're going to the Prophet and there's mid there's many around this message that are denominated it's no more than the denomination it is not a resurrection and a rapture in faith it's just the denomination amen and as I've said this is their Creed brother and again our brother being made reference to it this is the Creed oh we believe this we believe this yeah the denominations are there they got their Creed and this is our Creed we believe this we believe this we believe that and so on not and so brother there's many a church around the message not minutes not much different Amen for brother how many what do you believe it's my life amen where are you going resurrection where you going the rapture amen by the grace of God you're pressing on amen so understand again that you can add the anointing if it's not in your soul you could go to hell amen oh yes most definitely Oh brothers sisters it's gonna be tremendous when we bring out some more revelation concerning the false anointed once a man because of poverty light false Christ's false prophets now he said not singular it's plural a man not a false christs false christs they men and he said anointed once yeah with Paul's teaching cardi office amen you got power to do this powder do their as a part of God also made sure that was he said they that sister that was healed and he said you can have the Holy Ghost in your flesh 24 hours you can be healed and go to hell yeah because it's all over all flesh is not your soul god help us Amen this beatless made seat making your kali in elections for is to make sure you got it in your soul not in your head make sure it's controlling you from the inside out amen not from the outside in amen glory hallelujah amen in Galatians chapter 2 and verse 16 again knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law or by the word of the message well I believe this I believe that no you become the word you become the message manifested in flesh he said but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law amen the faith that God wants us to have is increase and our brother and if I got Christ in me God sees that faith hey man praise the Lord hallelujah brothers make no wonder that that without him were lost a man he is our righteousness he is our salvation he is our hope amen he is our faith hey man whatever God's looking for he and his sons and daughters is in Christ praise the name of the Lord Christ in us the hope of glory and he said not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found sinners is there therefore is therefore Christ the minister of sin no righteousness God forbid for if I build again he said the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor frights through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I got a die to that for Christ to come in and raise me up with razor with resurrection a man not just physical brother will break it out for me to experience a physical resurrection I've got to experience a clear spiritual resurrection and we'll give you the scripture because there a spiritual resurrection as I said I preached in that church one time certain church and it was two or three hundred people there and I said I just want to let you know I've been resurrected and I want to let you know I've been raptured oh it was quiet everybody got quiet they were looking at one another and they're all looking at their pasture to pasture were looking at them and shaking his head I said I'm gonna prove to you by the word that I have been resurrected I have been raptured I will read the scripture just shortly amen brother god help us to have faith brother everywhere not resurrected spiritually I can actually be late for a physical resurrection a man a man a man god help us brother and yet there's many a believer doesn't they they don't recognize that they've been resurrected they don't recognize her they've already been raptured they've already been changed they don't recognize that but I got to have that experience in me for it to take control one day a man it'll take control and that all be changed in a moment give an eye for the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive remain shall be caught up together with them raptured to meet the Lord in the air I have been I will be by the grace of God amen praise the name of the Lord I'm going to tell you a certain thing I saw one time when I was I was on my way to our brother burns as a sister burns his house for a cottage meeting and when I looked up I turned I looked up to the sky it was dark but hold the light thy seen o I said Lord I said my I said that's the resurrection that's true that's the rapture Lord all there we're gonna get caught up and and eventually after more after a minute or two it began to fade at faith a man and God now I tell you it's coming it's not coming no it's here it's here it's there it is the light of the revealed word brother there's anything any racer that God did what he did in this horror any reason that God did he we did reveal what he has revealed as our brother it is because of the resurrection of the rapture the prophet of God brings it out well yeah and I are they I lighted it in the message on perfect faith in the message and then then he preached the rapture and he said God did this and God did that the mystery of God was what was the mystery of God revealed for he said that was revealed to give us rapturing faith the Obie of the seven seals Amen well what is rapturing faith brother headwraps repay all the others get caught out get caught out but brother before you can add that pain you got to have a revelation of the mystery of God revealing the endtime revealing that it's over revealing that this is key this has come to pass this has come to pass this prophecy is fulfilled their prophecy is fulfilled now look up because your Redemption draws nigh now I brother if you're not looking up spiritually even I look it up for the resurrection rapture you haven't got the revelation as you should have it because when you see this when you see this and even what's going on in the world right now sir when you see this having good look up but true many are gonna look out there look at this look at that this is what's going on that's what's going on look up not look out there don't look down look up spiritually in your heart in yourself for the change for the rapture my lord my lord I pray grace no matter how long time goes our that we will not lose the reality of the rapture we are now notice the reality of the revelation of the resurrection amen that we're not going to just go to a passive graveyard and feel that all they're all dead to need man they're all dust and so on Oh Lord that's what you said no you're not there if they're dating Christ are not there during another dimension that's the prophet of God said me say it again he said they're waiting on us for what Rhianna us for the resurrection the Old Testament Saints were waiting on Jesus look what he did know they're the new judgment straights are waiting on mrs. Jesus Christ because the powder God said Christ is made flesh in the bright the fullness of the Godhead bodily said is now in the bright brother/sister God Elvis what are you do you really feel like that do you really feel that that you are the fullness of the Godhead bodily you really fail in your spirit and in your soul as Jesus felt just think Jesus went went knowing who he was he didn't doubt who he was he knew what he had to do knew what I knew what he had to accomplish and how he had to do it that's right brother that's why he went into the Garden of Gethsemane and he got down and he cried and he cried and he cried knowing what he had to endure in the flesh for your sake and mine it struck me a couple of days ago that by grace through faith I'm saved you don't want to struck me grace grace I said Lord what it want will I'm sorry no Lord me I said me sit with you and your throne no Lord no no I'm not worthy for sure me I would born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and Lord Who am I sure maybe Elijah or maybe brother branham maybe this brothers sister that's this world that wouldn't but not v-- heart what struck me was the revelation of grace well I said this is what grace is all about the public guard recognized it Just's all about it now with the father God said he wanted to introduce us to Jesus but he said he said then he said he wanted to get it out and crawl up now walk up crawl up and touch his feet and yet there's so many so-called believers oh they want to get up there and all the changed us thank you thank you Jesus what you did to show your appreciation a different attitude to different spirit a humble attitude and a humble spirit that's right oh it struck me in oh it was heart it just knocked me down I said grace Lord that is grace for me to sit with you and your throne that had to be grace absolutely grace I said to to me yes and to all of us Lord especially in these last days because he said when the Son of Man comes will he find faith on the earth well how bad is it gonna be how much time behave it's gonna be in control if Jesus said when he comes will he find faith on dear grace to us don't don't puff yourself up don't think you're this near that stay humble amen if God does anything with his word and the revelation of his word the revelation of Clary is to Humble us it's hard I don't think I'll never forget it no when I consider what I am Who I am what we are who we are and to think that II want each going to sit we're going to sit with him and his throne I said Lord me I suggest to many around the world a lot better than me I said god bless on my sister wherever they are wherever they are grace they'll sit with you and your throne grace grace to you please don't let us take things for granted a man don't let us take it lately oh yes Jesus I know you did it yeah but Jesus looking for a right attitude the right spirit in you what is your action where is your reaction to what he did just to many believers oh yeah going on that's it yeah thank you Jesus you yeah thank you Laura all mine oh I appreciate that Lord you with the Calvary and Lord and you laid in your life for me now I got eternal life praise the Lord I'll see you Laurie Lord but I men are going to really repent yeah how many are really repented it's like get a certain brother I trust he's gone on to glory yeah a world-famous person and still famous still known around the world George Beverly Shea yeah he used to come down in his kit in his house when he was a teenager and a boy and he sit down at the piano and he play and his mother say played this and he played me sing a hymn but he still wasn't saved he wasn't a Christian until he went to her to a meeting and the preacher gave an altar call and he went up to the altar yeah but he knelt down on one knee and his father come up and his father's his son he said but both knees down he said you're a sinner like all the rest he said put both knees down and ask God to forgive you oh he said he repented he may praise the name of the Lord and he asked God to forgive him and God forgave him amen and God blessed him so that he's are known around the world but he humbled himself oh yeah right on true till he was even a hundred and some-odd years old that was the last time he's saying a man the I believe he was 104 when the Lord took them all yeah again as I've maybe mentioned before that Billy Graham said he told cliff barrels he said when I always said I want I want to sing like he said like like brother George he said when I get to heaven and cliff barrel said he said well he said brother brother Billy he says Corte happen to do it he said you had to be in heaven he said this thing like George hey man why because he is per his voice was so he was a world-famous singer and he still is a man the god Elvis had that right attitude and that right spirit brother man that we're gonna do as he did brother when he came to the altar he humbled himself not just said his merry but he humble himself in his soul he humbled himself and now repent in his body he repented in his soul they made it because brother we need Christ on the inside of the inside by the grace of God and the power of God violated that he said mister he said not just here now and I just seen your spirit he says got to be in your soul if you could have the anointing in your purse you can have the anointing in your spirit and he's gonna go to hell you got to have the anointing in your soul amen there are those that have the experience and they feel God oh I'm saved no you're not and then others who stay there longer and they got the Ananya in their sport oh I'm saying no stay there longer till you got the baptism in your soul of the Holy Ghost it is Christ in me the hobo glory brother our brother Ben I think was plenty us to that listen it's not this it's not that don't just put your faith there your faith there let's go let's have your faith in your heart hey that is on the inside of the insight and the power of God highlighted that not your body not your flesh not your spirit but your soul and there's many got the Nanyan their flesh they got the anointing and they're smart but not in their souls the devil has deceived them oh that's alright you got it praise the Lord you got it thank God yeah you get them you'll get them to worship yeah oh yeah worshiped God he got up deceived thinking that they got it when they don't have it or to probably God warned us concerning the anointed ones at the end time God Elvis amen oh my forgive me he said verse 17 he said if why we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found sinners if there is therefore Christ the minister of said no god forbid he come to redeem us from seeing a man for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make my supper transgressor for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God how many are living under God so that each controlling your thoughts your spirit your soul oh yeah not just not just your thoughts and not just your your even your spirit he's got to have controlling your soul why so they is living in you you can add the powder God is warning us you can have it in your head you can have it in your spirit and Satan being control still in control of your senses oh yeah grace to us he said I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God amen and verse 20 he said I am crucified with Christ any man I trust I am I trust you err because if you're crucified with Christ you are dead to sin a man I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live and yet not i but Christ liveth in me is that true I remember it's not just if Christ has hidden you in your soul is your just not just say oh I believe the message I believe this I believe that so does the devil yeah but there is a life that Christ in you is going to reflect there's an attitude that Christ in you is going to reflect there's a spirit that Christ in you is going to reflect and we will show you now in the scriptures that life that spirit and that attitude how many got it I'll tell you this after the prophet of God was taken off the scene a Roman Catholic priest or whatever he was in the church there he said listen he said I tell you what William Branham he saw tell you this he said if you ever met him he said you knew he loved you yeah he had divine love again first Corinthians 13 you know oh he knew this and he knew that he had this and he had this being a prophet he had this gift and this anointing so on yeah but he had a greater 90 in his soul of divine love search should annoy that even those out there said oh if you've met him you knew that he loved you if somebody met you would they sense that you loved them would they discern that that you had a loving spirit yeah not an attitude spirit life god help us I've met a lot of believers but I didn't I didn't sense love no they're just religious and they're believers oh I believe the message I believe this yeah and they could talk your blue I'm gonna come to the doctrine now but they never had divine love I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me the life that I now live and this at you don't just because you're believers say yes brother that's me no no you can always say yes brother that's me if it's vindicated in your life on a day-to-day basis hey man you have the vindication oh yes brother I believe that because brother he's with me today he's with me tomorrow he's with me through the day when I meet this one when I meet that one brother he's there and it's not me he said it's him when it comes to my attitude my actions my reactions it's not me it's Jesus what hold brother what a statement yeah it's Christ do others that you meet recognize that you're you're different and they recognize oh that part that person is good they got a good spirit they got a nice spirit oh yeah their attitude is good and their actions are good bro it's good and they seem real not a put-on but real oh so that is not you let live this Christ living in you amen Christ wasn't putting it on a man he wasn't putting it on he it was his nature it was his nature soul body spirit oh it was Jesus it was the word in flesh again in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now he's made flesh on us and brother he wants to live the same life in you that he lived 2,000 years ago grace a right attitude and a right spirit right action reaction god help us amen even whether when he stood before Pilate oh how many of us would stand there and hold our peace and maybe we'll stand there and say nothing just be quiet they're going to crucify you and add some we'll fight for their lives fight for their attitudes fight for their nature fight oh yeah brother I turn to this if the word is in flesh in you and you're not listening to the devil he'll crucify you you'll be out there to get this one to condemn you can get this one to find fault with you and focus on it but I tell you this if you got the Holy Ghost you're not gotta focus on that in no matter who it is if it's your brother your sister this one this one no no you have the Holy Ghost and you believe that they got the Holy Ghost grace let me read it again I am crucified with Christ are you are you that dead nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God oh my living by the faith of the Son of God the revelation of the Son of God god help us he said who loved me and gave himself for me he loved you and he died for you brother god help us to love him and lay down our lives for him amen so they II will reveal himself in you turn with me to Ephesians chapter 2 it's just the next book Oh amazing brother god help us that we're going to seek the perfect will of God not permissive will our brother been brought that out there are many a believer that's in the permissive will not the perfect will oh yeah they throw their do you believe this they believe this they believe that but Christ is not in control of their nature Christ has not in control of their attitude their actions and their reactions god help us and brother he's got to be in control in Ephesians chapter 2 okay and verse 1 you as he quickened it is what the scripture I gave it to that church when I told him I was resurrected I said I've been resurrected in my soul I was dead but now I'm alive in my soul and you and they quicken who were dead in trespasses and sins I trust you got the revelation of Resurrection that trust you got the experience of resurrection and that you're a new creature in Christ he changes your nature oh you're still you're still dealing with that old nature because it's in your flesh and the devil is there to get you to try to focus on that but no God has given us a new nature in our souls what for the soul is to control the spirit and the Spirit is to control the flesh amen so I pray grace that you got the anointing power of the Holy Ghost in your soul to control your spirit because that's a prophet of God brought out he said that your flesh has got five senses and he said your soul has got five senses the instincts of your spirit of your flesh is case feel smell and here yet what you're hearing but the instincts of your spirit is imagination conscience memory reason affection the instincts of your spirit a man and the anointing in your soul will control the instincts of your spirit and the instincts of your spirit will control the instincts of your flesh and if you born with a worldly nature in your soul you're still there it'll control your spirit and your flesh and you'll live like the world but if you're born again and you got a new nature in your soul a man well it's going to control your spirit it's gonna be an oligo stin fluence in your spirit and that's going to be influencing your flesh by the grace of God hey man oh brother grace that we're resurrected in our souls you as a quicken who were dead in trespasses and sins we've been made alive we were dead but now we're alive we're you know we were dead to God cut off him and now we're united with God we're in back in fellowship with God because why we are sons and daughters of God a man we're in times pass he walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience are you will be inter disobedient or eyes goes beyond just water baptism goes beyond just so I believe in the oneness of the Guardian I believe what the prophets said there and so on I believe in the invisible Union but are you experiencing it one thing to say I believe what the what he said about the invisible union of the evany bridegroom and the earthly bride yeah but are you experiencing it there's many believe it but they're not experiencing the invisible union with Christ God Elvis this is we're in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience yeah I see that worldly spirit working in a lot of believers yeah among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh yep fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're but and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others for God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins as quickened us together with Christ we've been resurrected spiritually amen by the grace ye are saved and as raised us up together and made us sit together we've been raptured amen we've been raised up into heavenly places raise us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen I've been resurrected I've been raptured a man I would resurrect it in myself and rapture him my soul into a heavenly place in Christ where the word is revealed part of God say what's going on in heavenly places in Christ he said the word is being revealed amen so it's not me that lives it's not you that leaves us Christ living in you oh yeah he's living in you in your house he's living in you in your home he's living in you and your job oh yeah you're you're doing it now you're doing there's not there not as an unbeliever you you go work as a Christian yeah you talk as a Christian you you you think as a Christian you do the work as a Christian as Christ would do it it's not you doing this and then always just Christ is just with you Church Oh crisis just with you when you when you say to prayer see or your Greece in your home crisis just there you know it's oh no no he never let he never leaves you you never forsake you he shall be with you even in you to the end of the age I'll never never lead you the brother no matter what you're doing he's not he's not going to leave you if you're a Christian you will have a right spirit and a right attitude right action right reaction I've given you different witnesses and different testimony but it's not me because I feel that I'm not righteous it's he's righteous not me but yet if your spirit is right in your attitudes right others were some not not everybody but some will recognize it all right they recognize it in Jesus they'll recognise it in you now grace of God he has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus brother we have been resurrected spiritually we've been raptured spiritually we are in heavenly places in Christ brother how can you live any other kind of life or have any other kind of an attitude if you've been if you got resurrection in you and you got a rapture a spirit in you how can you you can't there's no way you can get away from it because why you're one he is one with you you're one with him so again as we read in the scripture there is he says Christ in you the hope of glory he's not you there not me that lives it's Christ that liveth in me amazing how you met did you manifest Christ to it to the ones you work with do they do they recognize you as being a Christian do they know that you take your stand for this and you're standing for that and they reverence you and respect you most will not all but most will and he said why we've experienced this with the experience that that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus and again the familiar verse for by grace are you saved through faith not just grace well I say by great no it's grace through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God amen praise the name of the Lord one other scripture and then we love to try to bring it to a conclusion Galatians chapter 5 the challenge of our faith as sons and daughters of God did this be a challenge to our faith to us who profess to be borned again to us who believe that it's not me that lives as Christ that liveth in me this is going to be a challenge Galatians chapter 5 and verse 16 this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh regardless of what you do when you do it where you do it how you do it you've got to do it in the spirit a man oh yeah no matter if you're a job no matter what you're doing you're doing it in the spirit you're controlled by the Holy Ghost you do it as as Christ would do it amazing not me that lives not you the lives as Christ that liveth in you and if Christ is living in you when he's doing it oh yeah he'll bless you if you're going to if your spirit is right and your attitudes right you'll bless you or did I don't mean you got to be religious it's just a right spirit a right attitude right actions right reactions ain't man there are others they just reckon all you're a good person now some might recognize you if they got that discernment they might recognize oh they must be Christian you don't have to be in the sense of Christian - you got it you got to say this and say that say no no your life is going to reveal it if Christ is in you he'll make yourself known and some will look at your said well Lee he's a good person and moving that's it others look and say oh he must be a Christian I think that brother that that that man rather or that woman is a Christian
