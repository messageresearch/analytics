[41:12] amen because they they got everything
[41:15] around them to attempt to
[41:16] to uh keep them occupied so i trust that
[41:20] they were going to be more occupied with
[41:22] the word
[41:23] and less occupied with our surroundings
[41:25] by the grace of god
[41:26] so it's a tremendous challenge for the
[41:28] ministry whether it's me or some other
[41:30] brother
[41:30] brother preaching in ministry or brother
[41:32] jonathan my
[41:34] and we get up here and and we preach to
[41:36] two or three people
[41:37] three or four amen amen but by grace
[41:41] what keeps us moving is the spirit
[41:43] that's pulling on the lord
[41:45] and pulling for the word amen and he's
[41:47] here to bring the word
[41:49] where there's two or three here amen or
[41:51] and but again
[41:53] he knows who's listening he knows who
[41:55] will hear it amen maybe somebody online
[41:58] and maybe not just the members of the
[42:00] assembly but it could be somebody else
[42:02] in another country
[42:03] so we pray the grace of god to bring the
[42:06] word
[42:07] a reality to their souls amen as uh
[42:11] receiving an email from my brother again
[42:13] this week and he wanted to know this and
[42:15] this and this he said brother just if
[42:17] you could
[42:17] just explain it and i explained
[42:19] something and oh
[42:21] and then to me it was just a testimony
[42:24] like
[42:24] and they came back said oh praise the
[42:27] lord that's
[42:28] wonderful oh my thank god
[42:32] and i said well lord bless him i said
[42:34] that o lord that he'll have the same
[42:36] testimony i have
[42:37] amen of the grace of god amen
[42:40] and he wanted that he wanted to to know
[42:43] you know
[42:44] what do we do how far do we go in
[42:47] working with unbelievers
[42:48] and you know they're not christians
[42:50] they're not this they're not that
[42:52] and i said well come down the basics
[42:54] brother i said
[42:55] regardless of what they believe i said
[42:58] you're just going to live what you
[42:59] believe
[43:00] amen and keep your attitude right your
[43:02] spirit right
[43:03] amen and again and again he did i like
[43:06] the scripture
[43:07] and where it is written that you know
[43:09] where paul encouraged him to do this and
[43:10] do that and
[43:12] do what he say if you're working out
[43:13] there for unbelievers or for sinners
[43:15] he said you do it as unto the lord amen
[43:18] amen
[43:19] so that's the reason why you got to do
[43:21] this unto the lord i so you can reflect
[43:23] i said you're new you're a new creature
[43:25] now you're born again
[43:26] and you're going to do this not just for
[43:28] man you're doing it for jesus
[43:30] amen and you're going to play you want
[43:31] to please jesus because if you please
[43:33] jesus i said you'll please the one
[43:35] you're working for
[43:36] amen and that's the truth so god bless
[43:38] our brother
[43:40] and the brother that was in question is
[43:41] uh he's uh
[43:43] in india and i've been in contact with
[43:46] him for a little while
[43:47] but i pray god bless him and god give
[43:50] him more of the holy ghost in his heart
[43:51] and soul
[43:52] amen the amen about telling brother
[43:55] we're going to reflect christ
[43:56] in what we do brother we've got to have
[43:58] the holy ghost
[44:00] because it is christ in us the hope of
[44:02] glory
[44:03] and you know if we got the holy ghost oh
[44:05] praise the lord if he's in control of
[44:07] your heart your soul
[44:08] you're a new creature in christ amen
[44:10] brother it's just it's automatic
[44:12] i don't have to force the issue i just
[44:14] die die to myself
[44:15] more alive to to the anointing and amen
[44:18] if you've got the anointing and the
[44:19] anointing is in control
[44:20] you're going to reflect jesus amen most
[44:23] definitely
[44:24] you're going to reflect the salvation
[44:25] that you're claiming to have
[44:27] and to god be the glory amen so the lord
[44:30] bless us
[44:31] and be in prayer for one another lord
[44:33] help us don't let us get so caught up
[44:35] that we're going to
[44:36] hesitate in reflecting jesus that we're
[44:39] going to get to the place lord
[44:40] so caught up with the world that we're
[44:42] going to get to the place that we're
[44:43] just going to reflect
[44:44] the old nature no no that new creature
[44:47] is dead the whole creature is dead
[44:48] let the new creature have control by the
[44:50] grace of god
[44:52] and brother if he does have control and
[44:54] it's not just coming out
[44:56] with this doctrine that doctrine i
[44:57] believe this i believe this i believe
[44:59] that
[45:00] it's there if we all praise the lord the
[45:02] devil believes it but
[45:04] the thing of it is are you reflecting
[45:06] the life of that word
[45:08] amen so is he in you is he in control
[45:11] not reflecting doctrine it's reflecting
[45:14] jesus
[45:15] amen because he in the beginning was the
[45:18] word
[45:19] amen and he was the word and so on
[45:22] and the word was made flesh and the
[45:25] words may flesh on you and me
[45:26] amen brother let's reflect the word and
[45:29] the word brother
[45:31] it comes down to the will of god
[45:34] amen you're going to reflect the will of
[45:36] god for your life
[45:37] for this hour for this age amen so i
[45:40] pray grace that we're going to be truly
[45:42] truly dead to ourselves but alive unto
[45:45] him amen
[45:46] and that he is in control even in your
[45:49] net doing what you got to do in your
[45:50] natural life
[45:51] as as that brother was inquiring about
[45:53] about it
[45:54] his job and and and what does
[45:58] what did paul me mean there when he
[46:00] spoke to timothy about this and go out
[46:02] and he said well they said you you grow
[46:04] and you work yourself in this do you
[46:05] work in that
[46:06] he said as unto the lord why because if
[46:09] you're doing it it enters unto the lord
[46:11] i'm sure your boss is going to be
[46:12] pleased amen
[46:14] because why your heart is going to be in
[46:15] it by the grace of god i thank god
[46:18] for the witness that he has he has
[46:21] helped me to do
[46:22] amen as i've said you know i'm working
[46:25] and the people would know that i was
[46:26] christian there i don't know why
[46:28] because not not because of of anything
[46:31] religious that i was talking about
[46:33] not by any means but they they would
[46:35] look at and they would see what i was
[46:37] doing how i was doing it
[46:38] and so on and i remember one time that
[46:41] that i was just
[46:42] in in that area and that area that i was
[46:44] just stood up in a certain part
[46:46] of well it was a it was a store just a
[46:48] certain part of the store
[46:50] and one of the managers came out and
[46:52] says
[46:53] mr lush i said yes they said
[46:56] my i i'm shocked
[46:59] that i to see you just standing here
[47:02] you're usually always find something to
[47:03] do
[47:04] and you're always doing this doing that
[47:06] well i said now i'm getting others to
[47:08] help me
[47:09] and i said i tell them what to do i tell
[47:11] them what to do so now i'm just waiting
[47:13] for them to do it
[47:14] and i'll and i'll i'll go and compliment
[47:17] on it for them
[47:18] amen now well he said i'll tell you what
[47:20] we want now
[47:22] they said we want you to teach them amen
[47:25] the others in
[47:26] in in the the store there the business
[47:29] they wanted me to go teach them what to
[47:31] do how to do it when to do it where to
[47:32] do it so on
[47:34] and i said okay i'll do it no problem
[47:36] and so i just they just said all right
[47:38] take half of them into the room
[47:39] and talk to them okay i said as you
[47:42] whatever you need
[47:43] so brother it's reflecting the attitude
[47:45] of jesus
[47:46] it's reflecting the attitude of our lord
[47:48] our savior oh yeah
[47:49] you're reflecting his spirit what would
[47:51] he do amen
[47:53] brother oh yeah what would he do brother
[47:56] he would he would
[47:57] just live the word and go on and he was
[47:59] doing it for the glory of god
[48:01] and he's teaching us to do the same amen
[48:03] you got a job go do it for the glory of
[48:05] god
[48:06] amen and reflecting the christian life
[48:09] not that you're going to be
[48:10] witnessing about this witnessing about
[48:12] this doctrine that doctor no
[48:14] no brother sister if god is looking for
[48:16] anything he's looking for
[48:18] his life in you oh yes most definitely
[48:21] are you reflecting his life maybe he's
[48:23] even to your neighbor or whatever
[48:25] oh yeah again we thank the lord for the
[48:27] witness that we gave when we
[48:28] were living on that street they were in
[48:31] in
[48:32] uh yeah mockingbird drive amazing and uh
[48:36] and i was shocked that when others the
[48:38] others came back and said oh this they
[48:40] knew this they knew that
[48:41] oh yeah they said we knew we knew you
[48:43] were a christian and so on
[48:44] it wasn't because we're going to church
[48:46] on sunday or wednesdays or because why
[48:49] because of our attitude toward everybody
[48:50] else
[48:51] that would come and go that we would
[48:53] meet a man now of course
[48:55] of course too it's like i said in
[48:56] wintertime i'd go out and i would
[48:58] i would do not just my driveway i'd do
[49:00] four or five driveways
[49:02] you know and so on and they said what in
[49:04] the world he doing that for
[49:06] why i think that's what jesus would do
[49:09] oh yes
[49:10] jesus would do that if he had if he had
[49:12] the uh
[49:13] the the strength and the encouragement
[49:15] if he had the especially the equipment
[49:16] now
[49:17] he goes he do this he do this he do this
[49:20] amen
[49:21] amen it's doing it as unto the lord
[49:24] by the grace of god amen so let's be in
[49:27] prayer for one another
[49:28] that we let go and let god have his way
[49:30] amen
[49:31] and that brother it's christ in you amen
[49:35] brother i don't care what your job is he
[49:37] he's going to teach you how to do it
[49:39] amen and well brother he's going to get
[49:41] you to do it the way you should do it
[49:42] with the right attitude right spirit
[49:44] right motive right objective
[49:46] amen do it for the glory of god and i'm
[49:48] sure you'll be
[49:49] you'll be you'll please your boss amen
[49:52] god bless you again let's read
[49:56] in matthew
[50:02] no mark was it mark chapter 8
[50:06] amen praise the lord
[50:09] amazing there are our emphasis on the
[50:12] word of god
[50:14] and we pray the grace of god that the
[50:15] word will live in us
[50:17] amen in mark chapter 8
[50:21] and beginning to read
[50:24] you see
[50:29] they started to read at verse 27
[50:33] and jesus went out and his disciples
[50:37] into the towns of caesarea philippi
[50:40] and by the way he asked his disciples
[50:44] saying unto them whom do men say that i
[50:48] am amen. and they answered
[50:52] john the baptist and some say
[50:55] elias and others one of the prophets
[51:00] who do they say that you are amen
[51:04] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[51:07] that i am
[51:08] and peter answereth and saith unto him
[51:11] thou art the christ amen
[51:17] and he charged them that they should
[51:19] tell no man
[51:20] of him and he began to teach them
[51:24] that the son of man must suffer
[51:27] many things and be rejected
[51:31] of the elders and of the chief priests
[51:34] and scribes and be killed
[51:38] and after three days rise again
[51:43] amazing that he had the revelation of
[51:46] who he was
[51:47] and where he came from and what he was
[51:49] to do and what was to happen to him
[51:52] amen brother he kept going
[51:55] that the scriptures be fulfilled not my
[51:57] will father time be
[51:59] thine be done amen and brother if you
[52:01] got the holy ghost you're gonna have the
[52:02] same attitude the same prayer
[52:04] amen not my will father thyme be done
[52:08] and he spake
[52:11] that saying openly and peters took him
[52:15] and began to rebuke him
[52:19] but when he had turned about and looked
[52:21] on his disciples
[52:23] he rebuked peter saying
[52:27] get thee behind me satan for thou
[52:30] savers
[52:33] not the things that be of god but the
[52:36] things that be of men
[52:38] brother because there was a came to a
[52:41] place in their relationship with jesus
[52:43] that they were ashamed of what was going
[52:45] on and they walked away
[52:48] amen but peter was there to deny him
[52:51] openly
[52:52] amen god help us
[52:55] that we're going to stay with the word
[52:57] amen scripture has got to be fulfilled
[52:59] in your life
[53:00] scripture got to be fulfilled in in this
[53:02] assembly amen
[53:04] and in whichever way god wants to do it
[53:05] let him do it we're not going to be
[53:07] ashamed
[53:08] we're going to take our stand for jesus
[53:10] amen
[53:12] so when he had turned about and looked
[53:14] on his disciples he rebuked
[53:16] peter saying get thee behind me
[53:20] satan for thou saver is not
[53:23] the things that be of god amen
[53:27] the revelation of this revelation of
[53:29] that but not the revelation of what god
[53:31] was doing
[53:32] and how god was going to do it amen
[53:37] and again in verse 34 and when he had
[53:39] called the people unto him with his
[53:41] disciples
[53:42] also he said unto them whosoever will
[53:45] come after me
[53:47] let him deny himself amen
[53:50] anyone you've got to deny to serve
[53:52] christ is yourself
[53:54] to serve the body you got to deny self
[53:57] amen
[53:58] the devil is there to get you to pay
[53:59] attention on yourself
[54:01] you you you should do this you should do
[54:02] that make sure it's god's leadership
[54:04] not my will father thine be done amen
[54:08] and when he had called the people unto
[54:10] him with his disciples also
[54:12] he said unto them whosoever will come
[54:15] after me
[54:16] let him deny himself amen
[54:20] and take up his cross and follow me
[54:25] for whosoever will save his life shall
[54:27] lose it
[54:28] but whosoever will shall lose his life
[54:31] for my
[54:32] sake amen and the gospels
[54:35] the same shall save it amen so that it's
[54:39] not you doing it it's god in you doing
[54:41] it
[54:43] for what shall it profit a man if he
[54:45] shall gain
[54:46] the whole world and lose
[54:49] his own soul amazing
[54:53] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[54:56] his soul
[54:57] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[55:00] me
[55:02] and of my words in this adulterous and
[55:05] sinful generation
[55:07] of him also shall the son of man be
[55:11] ashamed
[55:12] when he cometh in the glory of his
[55:15] father
[55:16] with the holy angels you may be seated
[55:19] god bless his word
[55:20] amen trust me we're not ashamed of him
[55:24] lest he be ashamed of us amen
[55:27] and it is the grace of god in us to give
[55:30] us the
[55:30] the courage to take our stand for jesus
[55:33] it is the grace of god in us to give us
[55:35] the courage amen to take our stand for
[55:38] the word
[55:39] by the grace of god amen he wants us to
[55:42] focus on him
[55:43] but brother to focus on him is to focus
[55:45] on the word
[55:46] by the grace of god because he was the
[55:50] word and flesh
[55:51] and now he has come to make you and me
[55:53] the word in flesh
[55:55] by the grace of god amen turn with me to
[55:59] another scripture amen
[56:04] in ii timothy again
[56:07] chapter 1.
[56:11] i'm going to read the scriptures try to
[56:14] keep the comments down
[56:16] low so i can give you more and more of
[56:19] the quotes
[56:20] the things that the prophet said in the
[56:22] message ashamed
[56:23] amen well why why would he preach it
[56:26] well i believe god ordained it
[56:27] and i believe god permitted it and i
[56:29] believe that the prophet of god
[56:31] a man recognized the need for it a man
[56:34] not only just out there in the world but
[56:37] brother
[56:37] is needful around message believers amen
[56:41] because again the prophet of god was
[56:42] preaching this in tucson i believe
[56:45] he was given his a report first of his
[56:49] trip to africa
[56:50] amen and then he got into the word
[56:54] and yes he was ministering it to his own
[56:56] church it's amazing
[56:59] the things that brother branham
[57:00] ministered to his own church
[57:02] the ministry things that he ministered
[57:04] to believers
[57:05] and we we maybe would never think that
[57:07] that he would have to deal with that in
[57:09] his own church
[57:10] but i've already highlighted that there
[57:12] are other messages that he preached
[57:13] and they were strong and they were hard
[57:15] and yet
[57:16] boy he preached it because he was
[57:18] dealing with those spirits
[57:20] in his own assembly again somewhere
[57:23] that's amazing but they they all believe
[57:26] the old william branham was it was a
[57:27] it was a set of god he was a messenger
[57:29] from god and some
[57:31] i guess believed that he was a prophet
[57:33] but yet when he preached church order
[57:35] it's amazing the number that left
[57:37] brenham tabernacle
[57:39] and went on to another brother's church
[57:41] and it was about eight miles away
[57:43] now why in the world would you leave the
[57:45] prophet's church
[57:46] if you believe william if you believed
[57:48] in your heart that william branham was a
[57:50] prophet
[57:51] and that amen and what he was preaching
[57:53] was a god
[57:54] a man it was god in the prophet it was
[57:57] god
[57:58] with the anointing amen to to get the
[58:00] prophet to preach
[58:01] what needed to be preached amen and he
[58:04] knew
[58:05] that they needed it in his own church
[58:07] amen
[58:08] and again at the same time no doubt
[58:10] maybe that he knew that
[58:11] there is the end result of preaching
[58:13] that that message
[58:15] it was going to cause those to leave the
[58:18] church
[58:19] not all of them but it caused many of
[58:21] them to leave
[58:22] and again we know again as i said that
[58:24] our brother level
[58:27] not leaving no brother neville brother
[58:29] as i said when brother manuel and some
[58:31] other newfoundlanders went down to the
[58:33] to the united states to visit
[58:34] jeffersonville
[58:36] and to attend the branham tabernacle and
[58:40] brother neville took brother
[58:43] manuel out to out to a restaurant for a
[58:45] meal and of course he asked the question
[58:48] don't forget it
[58:49] he asked the question why did brother
[58:52] branham preach
[58:53] church order well the problem of god
[58:57] said well i guess
[58:58] he just he just wanted them to do this
[59:00] and wanted to do that
[59:01] and maybe they were leaving this out and
[59:02] saying brother no
[59:04] he said he preached church order he said
[59:07] to
[59:07] to to put those with with false
[59:10] gifts he said down
[59:14] why because they were during the song
[59:16] service
[59:17] they were speaking in tongues giving
[59:18] interpretation they were doing this they
[59:20] were doing that
[59:21] they'd get up they gave their testimony
[59:23] in the audience in the congregation
[59:25] and they would go on and on and on and
[59:28] and brother neville or or brother
[59:30] branham whoever was there to minister
[59:32] they had to wait and wait and wait
[59:34] until that's so that testimony meaning
[59:36] came to an end until they stopped giving
[59:38] all those gifts
[59:39] you know the the the message in tongues
[59:41] the message interpretation
[59:43] amen and he said to gracie that's why
[59:46] the prophet did it
[59:47] and he said because he said those that
[59:49] were proclaiming to have these gifts
[59:51] he said it was a false anointing amen
[59:54] and he said that's why
[59:55] the prophet was bringing it to an end
[59:58] and not only that
[59:59] they stopped testimony meetings because
[1:00:02] they had a testimony meeting
[1:00:03] amen and it would go on for maybe an
[1:00:06] hour maybe two hours
[1:00:07] and the preacher will be waiting amen
[1:00:09] i've experienced that myself
[1:00:11] amen in the in the tabernacle the church
[1:00:14] that was in central newfoundland
[1:00:16] it's not there now it's gone but again
[1:00:18] i've been there
[1:00:19] and not just not to preach but i've been
[1:00:22] there just to listen to the pastor
[1:00:23] and brother as i said that he be sitting
[1:00:26] on the platform there
[1:00:27] in a chair and he'd be sitting with his
[1:00:29] bible and his notes and wait and wait
[1:00:30] and wait
[1:00:31] amen and he may have to wait for an hour
[1:00:34] or hour and a half
[1:00:35] amen till the testimony meeting was
[1:00:38] finished
[1:00:39] amen why what were they doing well they
[1:00:42] would get up and they go on
[1:00:43] and on and on and on amen and basically
[1:00:47] they were preaching
[1:00:48] oh yeah they had this thought so they
[1:00:50] wanted to share it with everybody else
[1:00:52] another one had this thought wanted to
[1:00:53] share it with the congregation
[1:00:55] instead of leaving it to the pastor and
[1:00:57] again even when we had the open-air
[1:00:59] services
[1:01:01] and i remember approaching the brother
[1:01:03] that was or
[1:01:05] organizing that open-air service and i
[1:01:07] said brother
[1:01:08] i said don't have any testimony meeting
[1:01:13] i said don't invite anyone to come up to
[1:01:15] testify i said because they're going to
[1:01:17] take too long
[1:01:18] and i said that's not right i said to to
[1:01:20] have to express
[1:01:21] express this i said to them maybe the
[1:01:24] maybe a 100 or 200
[1:01:25] people out there just gathered just for
[1:01:28] the for the open air service not
[1:01:29] believers
[1:01:30] but they were religious and i said so i
[1:01:33] said don't have a testimony meeting
[1:01:35] amen so i said have you got this to say
[1:01:37] and this to do i should do it
[1:01:39] but i said remember i said now i said
[1:01:41] only take a half hour
[1:01:42] and i said then i turn it over to the
[1:01:44] pastor for minister the word
[1:01:46] amen so brother again brother brown
[1:01:49] dealt with those things in his own
[1:01:50] church
[1:01:51] so he had to preach against this he had
[1:01:53] to preach against that he had to set
[1:01:55] this in order and that in order amen
[1:01:57] brother but again we can go too far the
[1:02:00] other way
[1:02:01] and not have anything to say and not
[1:02:03] worship god
[1:02:04] amen by the grace of god so i pray that
[1:02:08] oh yeah because i've experienced that
[1:02:09] too amen in in the churches that maybe
[1:02:12] that i i've ministered in
[1:02:13] and i'm not just talking about
[1:02:14] newfoundland but again i ministered as i
[1:02:17] said in
[1:02:17] in ontario i ministered in in new
[1:02:20] brunswick i ministered in
[1:02:21] even in alberta and so on and so
[1:02:25] and i oh yeah i i did give up and give a
[1:02:28] short testimony
[1:02:29] because i was invited to in british
[1:02:31] columbia
[1:02:32] but he wanted me to preach but i i said
[1:02:35] no i said i won't preach i'll just give
[1:02:37] you a few minutes
[1:02:38] amen amen so god help us that we're
[1:02:41] going to
[1:02:42] we're going to be led by the spirit and
[1:02:44] we're going to put our emphasis on the
[1:02:45] word
[1:02:46] amen whether it's the going forth of the
[1:02:48] word or the hearing and receiving of the
[1:02:50] word
[1:02:51] amen and this is what god's looking at
[1:02:53] in you and in me
[1:02:55] well for me he's looking at the going
[1:02:56] forth of the word am i surrendering to
[1:02:58] the leadership
[1:02:59] of the holy ghost and to want to speak
[1:03:02] the word preach the word that he wants
[1:03:04] me to preach amen so then it's not me
[1:03:07] it's him amen and and then god is also
[1:03:10] looking at you
[1:03:11] and god is judging you and
[1:03:15] not just those three here in the
[1:03:16] congregation or for
[1:03:18] amen but even though it's online brother
[1:03:20] when we get together for the hearing of
[1:03:22] the word
[1:03:22] get together to a man to worship god
[1:03:26] what are we putting the emphasis on we
[1:03:28] ought to be putting the answers on the
[1:03:29] word of god
[1:03:30] amen because through christ the word is
[1:03:33] revealed to us
[1:03:34] amen and that jesus is revealing himself
[1:03:37] to us
[1:03:37] through the word amen so brothers not

[1:04:25] want it done this
[1:04:26] way they want to believe it this way but
[1:04:28] brother you got to believe that it's god

[1:04:43] life does
[1:04:44] is the word controlling you amen and
[1:04:47] brother that's why god is doing it he
[1:04:48] fought for laying at the word lay out
[1:04:50] the word laid the word
[1:04:51] through a fightful ministry what for so
[1:04:54] that they'll surrender more and more to
[1:04:56] the word
[1:04:56] the word is going to control you the
[1:04:58] word is going to control me amen
[1:05:00] it controls what you do how you do it
[1:05:02] when you do it where you do it amen
[1:05:04] it's going to troll your attitude in
[1:05:06] your spirit amen
[1:05:07] but what is going to keep it all for the
[1:05:10] glory of god
[1:05:12] amen to keep you in the spirit to keep
[1:05:14] you under the control of the word
[1:05:16] amen sons and daughters of god are led
[1:05:19] by the spirit of god

[1:05:27] keep lining up with the word keep lining
[1:05:28] up with the word
[1:05:29] keep believing what the word wants us to
[1:05:32] believe
[1:05:33] and what is it god wants us to believe
[1:05:35] now until in this hour
[1:05:37] god wants us to believe for the
[1:05:38] resurrection god wants us to believe for
[1:05:40] the rapture
[1:05:41] brother luther had to believe what god
[1:05:43] gave him and wesley had to believe what
[1:05:45] god gave him
[1:05:46] the pentecostals had to believe what god
[1:05:49] gave them
[1:05:50] amen but now what's he given us is the
[1:05:53] revelation of the resurrect the end time
[1:05:55] and what are we going to see in the end
[1:05:57] it is the resurrection
[1:05:58] and the rapture amen brother and then
[1:06:02] and believers are going to be calling
[1:06:03] for the resurrection
[1:06:04] arming and thirsting for the
[1:06:06] resurrection but because i tell you
[1:06:07] luther and the lutherans they hungered
[1:06:09] and they thirsted
[1:06:10] for the revelation of justification amen
[1:06:14] as the others in wesley as the
[1:06:16] pentecostals i know it

[1:06:35] themselves they were glorifying this
[1:06:37] glorifying that where they were giving

[1:22:13] there is the wise virgin there is the
[1:22:15] foolish virgin

[1:22:57] they're virgins
[1:22:59] he says wise they got the revelation of
[1:23:01] the word
[1:23:02] amen then the foolish he said they got a
[1:23:05] revelation
[1:23:06] but only go so far they don't go as far
[1:23:08] as the bride
[1:23:09] amen god god gave it to us god gave it
[1:23:12] to the bride

[1:23:27] but the others never recognized what you
[1:23:29] and i are recognizing
[1:23:30] amen but we leave them with the lord
[1:23:33] because they're
[1:23:34] the problem of god said and remember he
[1:23:36] said they're foolish virgins but he said
[1:23:38] remember they
[1:23:38] are persians amen and and those that are
[1:23:42] in this hour
[1:23:43] and this is the foolish virgins in this
[1:23:44] age he said
[1:23:46] they they'll be ordained to go on
[1:23:48] through the tribulation
[1:23:49] the great tribulation and they will lay
[1:23:51] down their lives
[1:23:53] amen for jesus amen
[1:23:56] but he said they're like they say
[1:23:58] they're not lost
[1:24:00] because their brother wrote emailed me
[1:24:02] and i said all right brother he said i
[1:24:04] got a question
[1:24:05] is the foolish virgins in the bride
[1:24:08] is the foolish virgin part of the bride
[1:24:10] no they're not pride the bride
[1:24:12] i said that is the wise amen but i said
[1:24:15] don't
[1:24:16] don't put the foolish one down because
[1:24:18] they're going to be there
[1:24:19] amen because it is it's recorded there
[1:24:22] in in the book of revelation
[1:24:24] amen that oh they're right there to to
[1:24:27] give the glory to
[1:24:28] the bridegroom and the bride when
[1:24:30] they're united
[1:24:31] yeah but the bible says now they're
[1:24:34] they're taken off the sea
[1:24:35] once it's done they're taking off the
[1:24:37] scene well the bride's going to
[1:24:39] well that'll be a great tribulation amen
[1:24:42] but the bride is going to go
[1:24:43] in the rapture amen amen amen
[1:24:46] god help us to believe who we are
[1:24:50] and why we're here and where we're going
[1:24:53] amen and again as it struck me when
[1:24:58] when our brother jonathan he made me
[1:25:01] made mention of the the problem of god
[1:25:03] having been gone for 55 years
[1:25:07] and so on i said yeah that's amazing
[1:25:10] 55 years amen
[1:25:13] and i said lord we're still here but
[1:25:16] lord i believe we're getting
[1:25:17] getting closer and closer to the end
[1:25:20] when we consider what's going on in the
[1:25:22] world now when we consider what's going
[1:25:24] on around the world concerning
[1:25:27] concerning the kobit 19 issue i said
[1:25:30] lord
[1:25:30] it's finished it truly is finished oh my
[1:25:34] brother no doubt the problem of god saw
[1:25:37] it
[1:25:37] not only that brother he saw a a lot of
[1:25:39] other things that's why he said he said
[1:25:41] when i go
[1:25:42] he said what he meant when he go go to
[1:25:44] his grave he said there will be a much
[1:25:46] in his heart
[1:25:46] that he won't reveal amen
[1:25:49] there are things that he knew was going
[1:25:51] to happen but he wouldn't tell us
[1:25:53] amen but he i believe that god would
[1:25:56] reveal it to us
[1:25:57] and god is revealing it to us and when
[1:25:59] it happens
[1:26:00] brother we got we got the holy ghost in
[1:26:02] us we know
[1:26:03] we don't have to figure this out figure
[1:26:05] that out it'll strike us lord
[1:26:07] that's another sign that we're at the
[1:26:09] end that's another sign lord
[1:26:11] that we're getting closer to the climax
[1:26:13] of the resurrection and the rapture
[1:26:15] amen and again be on your guard live in
[1:26:18] the spirit walk in the spirit
[1:26:20] so that brother you're going to be what
[1:26:22] when when the dead in christ begins to
[1:26:23] arise it kind of
[1:26:24] appear to us we're going to know them
[1:26:26] we'll recognize them
[1:26:28] yeah and again it's like i said they're

[1:35:05] of what he did
[1:35:05] in your life a few years ago we're here
[1:35:08] because of what he did before the
[1:35:09] foundation of the world
[1:35:11] it was predestinated as i said that
[1:35:14] pentecostal pastor oh my
[1:35:18] they come and he said oh brother he said
[1:35:22] explain to me he said
[1:35:26] predestination
[1:35:29] and the will of god and that way i said
[1:35:32] to
[1:35:32] that pentecostal pastor and that
[1:35:35] catholic
[1:35:35] neighbor asked me and so on
[1:35:39] and he said pastor he said listen you
[1:35:42] people preach predestination god
[1:35:44] predestinated this this and this
[1:35:46] he said you mean tell me god decided to
[1:35:47] send this person to heaven and the other
[1:35:49] one to hell
[1:35:50] no i said that's the choice they made it
[1:35:53] was based on god's foreknowledge
[1:35:56] before the foundational world he saw the
[1:35:57] choice you would make
[1:35:59] he saw the choice i would make and i
[1:36:00] said based on that choice he
[1:36:02] predestinated you
[1:36:04] through calvary he predestinated you to
[1:36:06] eternal life
[1:36:07] and the other one i said i had no
[1:36:08] respect for it so i said he
[1:36:09] predestinated that one to hell
[1:36:11] oh yeah i'll tell you when they wake up
[1:36:14] they're not still not interested
[1:36:15] they still don't love him they still
[1:36:17] don't want this and that oh
[1:36:19] it's like again the bible they're in the
[1:36:20] revelation and it says
[1:36:22] oh god these these rose up and they
[1:36:24] looked
[1:36:25] and and they saw jesus and they started
[1:36:27] to cry for the rocks and the mountains
[1:36:30] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[1:36:33] him that sits on the throne
[1:36:34] amazing amen you think they'll be
[1:36:38] calling on him
[1:36:39] forgive us lord have mercy no they
[1:36:41] didn't love him
[1:36:42] no the spirit in them wasn't good wasn't
[1:36:44] right
[1:36:45] amen so i said brother god
[1:36:49] he's i said predestination is based on
[1:36:51] his foreknowledge
[1:36:52] i said what did he see you do before you
[1:36:54] did it
[1:36:55] before the foundation of the world oh
[1:36:58] oh he said brother thank you praise the
[1:37:01] lord he said that's wonderful

[1:37:12] he condemned it
[1:37:14] oh yeah he said they're out there
[1:37:16] they're saying god predestinated this
[1:37:17] predestinated that he said ah
[1:37:19] he said that's not god oh yeah but he
[1:37:22] didn't have the
[1:37:23] that pastor never had the revelation of
[1:37:25] of foreknowledge
[1:37:27] i trust by grace brother he saw you and
[1:37:30] me

[1:48:41] against what you teach
[1:48:42] not they're not because you're against
[1:48:44] what you're preaching no but
[1:48:46] but it's for you it's for your benefit

[1:51:54] a song to herself amen
[1:51:58] and she was saying must jesus bear the

[1:52:48] the things out there be trying you and

[1:53:32] and he said she is a christian and they

[1:53:42] life that happened in your job that to
[1:53:44] happen in
[1:53:45] in in your home no matter what it is
[1:53:47] where it is
[1:53:48] brother sometimes it's god allowing it
[1:53:50] to test you
[1:53:52] and try you to bring out your nature
[1:53:56] amen oh yeah do you have is that
[1:53:59] is this is it jesus nature in control or
[1:54:01] is it your own
[1:54:03] born in sin nature
[1:54:07] tremendous amen thank god for the
[1:54:10] revelation of the new birth
[1:54:13] amen brother it's not a religious
[1:54:16] experience
[1:54:17] it's it's a real spiritual experience
[1:54:19] and it is a genuine experience on the
[1:54:21] inside of the inside
[1:54:22] amen you are a new creature amen
[1:54:26] amen i'll tell you this and not you know
[1:54:29] and your
[1:54:30] your family should recognize it and your
[1:54:32] friends should recognize it

[1:54:35] recognize it amen
[1:54:37] oh you're a christian oh yeah
[1:54:40] well by the grace of god oh yes amen
[1:54:46] let's have the right testimony to give
[1:54:49] proving what you are praying your nature
[1:54:52] amen so he says sometimes
[1:54:56] he said the world will try you amen
[1:55:02] he said i never thought this would
[1:55:04] happen but last saturday night
[1:55:06] i believe it was or sunday night and he
[1:55:09] said the great speaker i don't
[1:55:11] don't submit to calling people's names
[1:55:13] but he's trying working exactly contrary
[1:55:16] and i'm trying to keep them churches out
[1:55:18] of that ecumenical move
[1:55:20] and this man is trying to put them there
[1:55:22] in there
[1:55:23] so he was speaking for the christian
[1:55:25] businessmen
[1:55:27] which i was supposed to have at the
[1:55:29] meeting in chicago
[1:55:30] and i thought i'd be in africa at that
[1:55:32] time so i couldn't take it
[1:55:34] and this man said go up there and said
[1:55:37] the greatest move the greatest thing in
[1:55:39] the earth now that had ever been
[1:55:42] all the churches are returning back to
[1:55:45] the catholic church
[1:55:48] yeah because they started it back
[1:55:52] just before the prophet was taken home
[1:55:54] and after the opening of the seals
[1:55:56] amen that those spirits began to come
[1:55:59] more and more into manifestation
[1:56:01] god held them held them held them back
[1:56:04] but then after the opening of the word
[1:56:06] it's more and more and brother the devil
[1:56:09] is there to tempt us
[1:56:11] to get into it that's right now you stay
[1:56:14] with the word
[1:56:15] amen so he said they are now returning
[1:56:19] back
[1:56:19] to the catholic church in the ecumenical
[1:56:22] move and the catholics will receive
[1:56:24] the holy ghost what a trap of the devil
[1:56:30] now yeah satan
[1:56:33] and he said this leader brother
[1:56:35] shakarian the president of the
[1:56:37] international businessmen
[1:56:38] stood up and said after the man sat down
[1:56:42] he said that's not the way we word it
[1:56:44] brother branham has told us
[1:56:46] this ecumenical move will move them all
[1:56:49] to the mark of the beast amen well yeah
[1:56:52] they're going to be deceived in it but
[1:56:54] they're going to do it
[1:56:55] will it willfully go that way because oh
[1:56:57] yeah that that's their
[1:56:59] that's their you know human fleshly
[1:57:01] thoughts of god
[1:57:02] god is this god is this god is this yeah
[1:57:05] but they don't have the revelation of
[1:57:06] god's nature
[1:57:08] they don't have the revelation of god's
[1:57:09] purpose his plan
[1:57:11] or his pattern no no
[1:57:15] they feel oh well we can love this and
[1:57:17] love that you know god god's god's a
[1:57:19] good god god's a god of love
[1:57:21] and so on but like i said love is
[1:57:22] corrective and
[1:57:24] down through the years god is with love
[1:57:26] he has corrected his sons and daughters
[1:57:29] amen grace trusting that we're
[1:57:32] here to be corrected by him brought in
[1:57:35] line more and more in line with his word
[1:57:37] amen and brother it just didn't start
[1:57:39] when you got baptized in the name of the
[1:57:41] lord
[1:57:41] no well it started when it comes to god
[1:57:45] bringing us to perfection
[1:57:46] but the devil is there to to to show you
[1:57:49] this and show you that get you to
[1:57:50] believe this and get to believe that do
[1:57:52] that do this
[1:57:53] and so on amen he's there to get you
[1:57:57] to think that that oh yeah the lord
[1:57:59] won't matt don't
[1:58:00] want mine because the lord knows this
[1:58:03] about you knows that about you
[1:58:04] amen so you know we just want you to
[1:58:07] keep
[1:58:08] you got to have a right spirit yeah but
[1:58:10] a right spirit is one that stays with
[1:58:12] the word
[1:58:13] amen it's not one that compromises
[1:58:16] amen you'll stay with the word but
[1:58:18] you'll still love the person
[1:58:20] and pray for the person amen but not
[1:58:22] compromise
[1:58:24] amen brother i i believe that there's
[1:58:28] many a believer that's ashamed
[1:58:30] of certain things that william branham
[1:58:31] has preached they're ashamed of certain
[1:58:33] things that he said
[1:58:35] and and you know he felt he felt this we
[1:58:37] should do this we should do that
[1:58:39] oh yeah you mean so many believers yeah
[1:58:42] there are believers that have left this
[1:58:43] message
[1:58:44] and gone back to their denominational
[1:58:46] churches
[1:58:48] there are believers that have left this
[1:58:50] message and gone back to the catholic
[1:58:51] church
[1:58:53] they did oh yeah well they came to the
[1:58:56] message
[1:58:57] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:58:58] lord jesus christ and they said they
[1:59:00] believe this believe that
[1:59:01] but it got to a place where their faith
[1:59:04] was being challenged
[1:59:06] more and more and more and they they
[1:59:08] couldn't take this they couldn't say no
[1:59:10] no no yeah and that started a number of
[1:59:13] years ago a few years ago
[1:59:15] they started to leave and go back to the
[1:59:16] catholic church
[1:59:18] you know and what about again that that
[1:59:21] as i mentioned the last service
[1:59:22] that a certain believer
[1:59:27] that i have talked to on the phone a
[1:59:28] number of years ago
[1:59:31] and he's on the internet there
[1:59:34] youtube and he's and he's speak speaking
[1:59:37] for
[1:59:38] a hour and a half and a half 90 minutes
[1:59:42] telling why he left the message of
[1:59:46] william branham
[1:59:50] i said this is this is amazing
[1:59:53] i said lord i said troy that's grace
[1:59:57] that he's still sitting there
[1:59:58] it is well as i said i talked to i might
[2:00:02] have been him on the phone
[2:00:03] and i'm not sure it was him or his son
[2:00:06] and
[2:00:07] that was a number of years ago now and
[2:00:10] so after i corrected certain issues
[2:00:12] there he said okay all right brother
[2:00:14] lush
[2:00:15] i guess we'll stay away from message
[2:00:17] churches i said yes
[2:00:19] i said you need to so i said
[2:00:22] i'll pray for you no they don't bleed
[2:00:25] the message
[2:00:29] it's amazing and yet
[2:00:32] and you've got others out there in
[2:00:33] certain churches that have more respect
[2:00:35] for us
[2:00:36] and more respect for the message than
[2:00:37] then than they do amazing
[2:00:41] and there are there's a testimony of
[2:00:43] others there too i think that also
[2:00:45] are testifying of of why they left the
[2:00:48] message
[2:00:49] and so on yeah god had mercy on us
[2:00:52] amen brother and
[2:00:55] they they feel that this is what you
[2:00:58] this is evidence right here
[2:00:59] why god didn't agree with william
[2:01:01] branham god didn't approve of william
[2:01:02] brown god did this god did that
[2:01:04] well brother you could look you could go
[2:01:07] through the scriptures and see what the
[2:01:08] lord permitted
[2:01:10] in the lives of the prophets amen
[2:01:12] brother that's the truth
[2:01:14] oh but yet yet you believe he was a
[2:01:16] prophet yeah
[2:01:19] but look what the lord allowed to happen
[2:01:20] to him yeah
[2:01:22] we'll see again brother all that's for a
[2:01:25] reason
[2:01:26] it's like the brother that sent me an
[2:01:27] email he said brother i read the bible
[2:01:29] three times he said i don't believe
[2:01:32] i don't believe it he said that's not
[2:01:34] that's not god
[2:01:36] and i said brother is it because he's if
[2:01:38] this because of that because of that
[2:01:40] i said well brother i just got to let
[2:01:42] you know that the bible was written
[2:01:44] in that way for a reason what do you
[2:01:47] mean
[2:01:49] i said oh yeah god allowed it to be to
[2:01:51] be written this way this way that way
[2:01:53] and i said why and i said to number one
[2:01:56] i said to turn away the unbelievers
[2:01:58] i said and there's three kinds of
[2:02:00] believers you know i said which one are
[2:02:02] you
[2:02:03] and i said god wrote in such a way so it
[2:02:05] oh
[2:02:06] unbelievers to take it just move it
[2:02:08] control away don't want that it's just
[2:02:10] just a religious book and i said then i
[2:02:13] said it's the cause to make believer to
[2:02:15] stumble
[2:02:17] and because god's going to use them for
[2:02:18] a witness one way or the other
[2:02:20] and that's they'll stumble over it and
[2:02:22] they'll or they'll skip that
[2:02:24] and then they'll stumble over that and
[2:02:25] skip that oh yeah yeah i'll take that
[2:02:28] and stop over this and take that i said
[2:02:30] that's make believers
[2:02:32] and i said then i said that it's the
[2:02:34] true believer that believes it
[2:02:36] regardless
[2:02:37] amen and maybe don't understand it but
[2:02:40] they leave it with the lord
[2:02:42] and i said which are you i said are you
[2:02:45] a believer
[2:02:46] a make believer or an unbeliever he
[2:02:49] never responded
[2:02:51] so maybe he was an unbeliever but i pray
[2:02:54] that i pray grace i prayed for him i
[2:02:56] said i pray grace
[2:02:57] that he's a believer amen that lord that
[2:03:00] you're going to speak to him
[2:03:01] but i haven't heard from him since amen
[2:03:04] brother i pray god
[2:03:05] grace that we are believers amen
[2:03:08] we're not going to doubt anything the
[2:03:10] devil is going to highlight this and i
[2:03:12] like that get behind me satan
[2:03:14] amen and he said what a trap of the
[2:03:17] devil
[2:03:18] he said what for to influence people to
[2:03:20] go back to the catholic church
[2:03:22] or just to you know recognize them as
[2:03:25] any other church
[2:03:26] oh at the galaxy oh yeah well that's
[2:03:28] just catholic there's the salvation army
[2:03:30] that's the pentecost that's the anakin
[2:03:32] oh it's fine with me oh well for us it's
[2:03:36] the word
[2:03:38] amen stay with the word amen
[2:03:42] i'd love to try to definitely finish
[2:03:47] amen he shouldn't oh yeah i wanted to
[2:03:51] bring out this
[2:03:52] but i i don't see a i don't think i can
[2:03:55] right now
[2:03:57] and that was from page 25 for the next
[2:04:00] four or five pages the problem of god
[2:04:02] brings out the
[2:04:04] characters in the in the in the bible
[2:04:07] amen
[2:04:08] and he said noah let's consider noah
[2:04:11] we could consider abel and cain
[2:04:15] amen cain must have been ashamed of
[2:04:18] abel's sacrifice
[2:04:19] uh they came with ashamed of abel's
[2:04:22] church
[2:04:23] amen a church that was full of blood
[2:04:26] amen
[2:04:26] and look what he did he went and killed
[2:04:28] lamb you know did this and did that
[2:04:31] but cain thought he had a wonderful
[2:04:34] wonderful sacrifice
[2:04:36] of all that he had grown and he had
[2:04:37] brought it and laid on the altar
[2:04:40] but he said prophet of god said noah was
[2:04:42] not ashamed
[2:04:44] it seemed foolish to the rest of the
[2:04:46] world but not to noah
[2:04:49] amen and there's many a thing that we're
[2:04:51] taking our stand for
[2:04:53] that is foolish to the world what do you
[2:04:56] take this stand for why are you
[2:04:57] preaching this for why are you preaching
[2:04:58] that
[2:04:58] all they got to do is be believers all
[2:05:00] they got to do is believe in god
[2:05:02] you know and this and then they'll go to
[2:05:04] heaven no they want
[2:05:05] god knows the heart amen
[2:05:08] and then he said moses when he was
[2:05:11] before pharaoh
