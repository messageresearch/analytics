Brother Ed cater and sister Rosalie amen they called us last evening amen yesterday sometime and they're on their way I think from Alberta area and how I'm going down onto Ontario I believe so and maybe they're on their way back to Newfoundland today I don't know but brother Ed and sister Rosalie so they were traveling and they were having Fellowship uh in in other areas in Canada and no doubt maybe they might have stopped in Ontario to have fellowship with their brother Alan and of course he's in brother Danny Olsen's Church in Ontario so we pray the grace of God to brother Aiden sister Rosalie and they just they said pass our greetings on to all the saints Amen in the church so the Lord bless brother Ed and sister rosely cater amen in the book of Acts chapter 20 and let's begin to read at verse 28. and again God bless us and we welcome all of our visitors again so the Lord bless us amen amen take heed therefore unto yourselves and do all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which eth purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock this beyond our guard also of your own selves shall mend the rise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them amen therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears amen and now Brethren I command you to God and to the word of his grace amen if there's anything the message of the hour testifies it is the grace of God Amen brother it was the grace of God all the way down Through the Ages it was the grace of God in Luther's age Wesley's age the Pentecostal age amen it is the grace of God in the bright age amen and was by grace through faith that they are saved it is by grace through faith we're saved brother I give them the give them the faith to move on move on move on but brother what is the faith that is giving us amen it's just not moving on to another age is moving on to Eternity is moving on in the resurrection and the Rapture so brother as they believe what God revealed then are we believing what God has revealed now do we believe amen they believed in justification sanctification amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit brother sister now we're believing that plus amen because why because the the judge certification leads on to sanctification sanctification moves on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit and brother now what's that going to lead us on to it's going to lead us on to the resurrection and the Rapture amen because God has revealed it God done this God did this God did that but now what's he going to do there's only one thing the only another thing left for him to do and that's the resurrection amen that's the Rapture brother I thank God for what he did and for the and the saints that were there to believe it amen but they were putting the answers on Resurrection Rapture no no no but now and even the Pentecostals only that they were putting names on the gifts of the Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and some of them in the early maybe 100 years ago they thought well maybe this is going to lead to the to the resurrection this is going to lead to the Rapture amen but then brother God brother God sent a messenger with a message amen not just not just wondering and maybe it is amen it is leading to the resurrection it is leading to the Rapture because brother is oh yeah well thank God for the faith of Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals but I praise the Lord what he's done in this hour in this age is giving us a greater Faith amen oh yeah faith for that yes praise the lord we believe it we believe it yeah but now now he is revealing something else now he's doing this believe us now this Amen brother this is what Jesus went in with oh praise the Lord he said I am the resurrection of the life and he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die and though we were danger surely live Amen brother now he's asking us to Billy why that was the first coming now in the second coming amen he's asking us to believe the resurrection and the Rapture Believers thou this amen We believe We believe what he did in the previous ages plus what he's done in this hour and in this age we believe the praise the Lord amen what an hour and what what what a revelation brother that God has given us in this hour thank God for justification sanctification it was an experience but brother and brother is leading on to a greater experience of a resurrection brother it's to experience what Jesus experienced and to experience what Jesus did amen he laid his life down he picked it up again praise the Lord now we don't have to lay our life down we can pick it up move on amen into the resurrection and the Rapture amen he required this of Lutheran Wesley and the Pentecostals but no brother it's a bride in the bright age amen and it's the time of the Resurrection is the time of the Rapture brother we got to look for it we got to pray for it we've got to be calling for it we got to be expecting it amen brother as in all other ages they were looking for it expecting it praying for it what God was going to do in their age amen but now brother what's God doing in our age and brother in the ministry of Malachi 4 what did he do five times brother the the resurrection was was revealed manifested the dead was raised five times amen that's the grace of God brother brother there was the gifts gifts in Pentecost my brother's going beyond that now and I was going now God's asking us to believe in the resurrection God asking us to believe the Rapture yes justification sanctification yes amen the The Bachelors of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit yes amen well we're moving on amen now what does regard require of us that yes praise the Lord but that's not what he's looking for manifestation of what he's looking for now is resurrection but we're not we're not well brother we don't go back Pentecost no brother where the the Lutheran or the Methodist didn't go back to the lutherans no they just kept moving on amen the lutherans moved on the the method has moved on Amen indicate the Pentecostals amen and they kept moving on around the world Amen and well they just knew that God did this God did that praise the Lord amen and just just some of them not not all of them some of them was wondering maybe this is going to lead to the coming of the Lord amen but they didn't preach that no no they just preached the gifts the restoration of the gifts God did this God did that amen but they weren't born exactly pointing to what the resurrection or the Rapture amen because they're why because there was to come another Ministry that was to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen they had the faith for for what God did in their age now God's given us the faith of what he's doing in this age amen believe us thou this amen hallelujah he was challenging Mary and Martha concerning Lazarus amen concerning that the raising and raising from the dead oh yeah he'll raise up there no now you raised now the presentates brother Jesus wanted to believe in the present tense Resurrection he was the resurrection he is the resurrection and he's asking us to believe in the present tense Resurrection amen and the Rapture by the grace of God Amen Brothers not just a Doctrine not just theology it's an experience amen it's an experience bear with me the justification was an experienced sanctification and experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gift was an experience but I was leading on to a greater experience amen boy why because the whole thing from Brother what what were they looking for from Genesis and the fall of Man they're looking for Resurrection they wanted to get back where they come from amen but because of sin we got trapped here and God alerted so he could reveal himself to us and bring out what's in us and sort of he's going to see the love of God in you and me amen brother sister that we're going to go back where we come from amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise brother hallelujah we're not going back to a strange place no we're going home oh you won't recognize this you won't recognize that oh yes you will oh we're home amen as I said if you went around the world after a while you were maybe in this country that country you want to get back to Newfoundland and you want to get back to Canada amen I Define you oh I'm home all home oh yes because I remember praise the Lord amen if I could just give you this experience that we had during our trip to Israel amen and when we you know we we go to that southern Israel we do you drive all the way up to Northern Israel and then you go across and that's where we stayed in the in the in the city there and in a hotel there amen and you can see the city of Galilee oh yeah amazing and there were those there were some of those in the hotel there and brother and we could get up in the morning go look out the window and they'd be out there swimming in the Sea of Galilee oh yeah they were oh yeah amazing but we were looking for something else we went on a cross and we went to Jordan and we went on down very down to Southern Jordan amen praise the Lord and other issues right there but then we came back up from Jordan what drove all the way up from Jordan oh yeah oh but just different it was a different spirit yeah but when we drew when we got up north and we went across to in in into Israel again oh on the bus and everybody was breathed they said we're home what going yes everybody was saying we're home and then most of us were from different parts of Canada or whatever amen but we fell home in Israel or it was absolutely amazing brother when we even when we cross the border and we're between Israel and Jordan there the spirit of the people that we were dealing with dealing with it was so different oh they were just um they weren't friendly no no but when we got when we moved out of that that and on into Israel the atmosphere changed and the people that we were meeting those that were working there and and to welcome you into Israel they oh they they were smiling and oh one welcome back good to have you yeah oh it was totally different and that's why we all breathed and said we're home amen we felt home in Israel well that's that after the truth to God be the glory amen so brother we're going home by the grace of God that's where we come from that's where we're going amen back to Glory again with our Lord Jesus Christ amen so again brother just to remind you of verse verse 30. one therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears amen God bless his word you may be seated term with me to Second Corinthians chapter 11. second Corinthians chapter 11. amen I'll try not to be too long we will see well we get to Eternity we won't feel we won't feel bored amen and in second Corinthians chapter 11 and beginning to read at verse 13. and just to share some thoughts with you concerning the messenger the message and the end amen what the messenger is pointing to the what the message is pointing to amen and what we're experiencing and in second Corinthians 11 and verse 13 for such a false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no marble for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light beyond your guard amen and therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works and brother we'd sometimes would would apply that maybe just to denominations and and to this out there and that religious and this religion there and so on but brother we're experiencing these things even now around the message Amen brother exactly but because the same spirits that were there listen brother when it comes to Jesus brother it wasn't out there somewhere among the scribes and the Pharisees it was right among the disciples amen and it was it was even even Judas and he was he was considered a disciple and brother he was considered oh well they said would you consider would you choose Jesus or Judas as the disciple and so on I don't think I got it here let's see I did have got it in there she and expressing what why they would choose this one why you would choose that one but amen they felt that they wouldn't add this one as a disciple no wouldn't have that one why but but Judah said all the positive attitudes see so brother sister God help us amen so we're not going to choose Judas choose Jesus amen by the grace of almighty God because I tell his brother Brown said even the even the so-called judaistarians he said they're they're going to be among us he said and they're going to be there to deceive us yeah he said they'll be there well he warned us and he referred to them as judicitarians oh yeah somewhere somebody one of the books there I I met one of the message books I read it and he warned us to vote the judicitarian spirit and brother we're dealing with that and since I've been in the message for the last almost 50 years that and you see you've been around the message for 50 years well I came to the message and in 1966 so as many many many years ago and brother we've been dealing with many spirits even back then and I remember even when I when I first preached it just 18 years old and we were gathered in a church in central Newfoundland and the the pastor there asked me to get up and speak and that's the first time I ever spoke publicly amen and I was I was about 18 years old because we were going to see the film of brother Branham and we're waiting back then you had to wait till it got dark and uh we're waiting till it got dark so we could watch the films so the brother got up and he said I'm going to ask our brother here now and uh because I was visiting them from from St John's and he said I'm going to ask our young brother he said from St John's to come up and speak for a few minutes he said until it gets dark and so on so that's when I got up and and ministered to him concerning the message of the hour and even back then brother I would I felt that I was dealing with with certain Spirits denominational Spirits amen and oh well they all profess to believe the message well so does the devil and I kept I I've been challenging them ever since ever since all the Believers and say you believe us as soon as the devil I said he has come down with great rat knowing his time is short so I said I already know which time is short I said by the word now you know it's time to short by the message I said he sees this he see that and your profession to see it so I said you better you better make sure your anointing is Right amen by the grace of almighty God and just saying he he was a part he came and he deceived even even the disciples two thousand years ago amen when he betrayed Jesus and he betrayed Jesus now amen and brother Branham preached the message I in the indictment I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Christ brother I can indict I can indict a generation now for the third crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and brother again I'm not going out there and I show you that see you there see over there they're crucifying the Lord no it's around the message amen it is Jesus influence even around the message amen that many message Believers are crucifying Jesus and crucifying his influence in their lives amen that's right it's crucified the the influence of Jesus Amen in the bride of Christ amen they judge oh they're they're well just lowering it and and and undermining the the the the the fullness of the word of God and and the impact of the word of God brother listen we are we are in this word this message is ordained and predestinated to give us resurrection and rapturing faith Amen brother the message gave Lutheran him the lutherans to that that Revelation that gave the Methodist that Revelation the Pentecostals that Revelation but brother what Revelation is it giving you and me amen praise the Lord and brothers not just going back and picking up what they had no no brother we gotta in this hour we gotta look up amen because the Bible tells us that it's right there in in the gospel and they say oh they look at this look at that and they saw they saw this in that group and they saw that in another group oh this is oh this is the influence and so on and they said oh let's look up amen we had to look up amen because they knew they knew that they they had seen this seen this seen this now where are we we're we're at the time that what did God want now justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost gifts of the Spirit what does God want to do now he wants to resurrect and raptures Amen brother what he wanted to do he gave them the faith and they believed it and ministered and God did it amen right on into the Pentecostals amen God gather the faith and they believed it and God manifested the gifts of the Spirit amen and he went around the world but brother that's what God did then but what's God doing now brother it's not it's not just to take us back or to to become lutherans to become methodists to become Pentecostals or this or that no he wants us to add the revelation of what he did then Plus let's move on Amen it is the revelation of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen now it's the revelation of the revealed word to give us the faith for the rapture amen hallelujah oh well we believe what God did we believe what God did amen do we believe what God's doing what is God doing Amen brother God is resurrecting and rapturing his bride oh yes all that God has done and all that God is doing amen through the revealed word of this hour amen it is giving us a resurrection and a rapturing faith amen if there's anything that we ought to be doing amen that God is looking for in you and me he's looking for us to look up amen he's looking for this his sons and daughters amen what are they doing are they acting how are they reacting oh they're looking up what are you looking out for oh Lord we're looking for the resurrection we're expecting the resurrection now we're expecting the Rapture Lord amen so brother let's not put the emphasis on justification or sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost not put the emphasis on the gifts of the in the Pentecostal church it's put the emphasis on the Resurrection The Rapture amen if there's anything that God is requiring of us it is Faith for the resurrection it is Faith for the Rapture Believers thou this amen when he was here to raise Lazarus from the from the grave oh yeah Martha said oh yeah he'll rise in in the resurrection that is to come Jesus wants to bring it into the present tense amen he said I am the resurrection amen and he that liveth and believeth in me though we were dead yet shall he live amen praise the Lord and maybe if they're living and believing to me they won't die Abraham hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Brother let's move on to the resurrection and look up brother let's not be looking back and oh that was you know the brother Branham was there and he did this and he did that and God did this and God did that yeah what's he doing now brother did their past tense when it comes to the lutherans and the methodists and the Pentecostals and all the others that God God gave them revivals and they're still looking back amen and there's too many around the message that are still looking back amen they see what God did amen and oh yeah God did this God do that God yeah and they're worshiping and praising the Lord for what he did but what is he doing brother he did that to give us the faith for what he's doing amen Believers thou this are you focusing on the resurrection are you focusing on the Rapture Amen brother as as we have emphasized that that he in other ages in Luther's age Wesley says Pentecostal age oh in in the oh they put the emphasis on what God was doing what God did what God did what God did God sent Luther with justification Wesley was sanctification and you know they instead of just moving on moving on moving on they just stayed with it and made a denomination out of it amen and the Pentecostals and the gifts of the Spirit oh brother sister there was a time when they were just looking at it and Moving On Moving on but then they stopped amen and they just wanted to owe you in this church and in that church in that church no no let's move on no no and when God moved on when they give him a greater Faith No they wouldn't believe it oh no we we believe that Pentecostal message well God wants you to believe it plus amen well we believe God sent a prophet good he wants you to believe that plus amen Plus brother you're going to add to it no I'm not going to add to it no God's Gonna add to my faith amen there's too many to still saying oh yeah uh they're Believers and God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet yeah but why did he send the prophet what about the message what did the prophet say amen what was the what was the the emphasis that the prophet was was putting on in in his ministry in his preaching brother he was putting the answers on the resurrection and on the rapture he was getting used to what he wanted us to get to look up look up look up amen oh yes indeed the brother in his ministry we know that he had the three pulls of his ministry but we know that the first two polls was to put emphasis on the third amen believe us thou this amen amen oh yeah he got their attention oh yeah he did this sign he did that sign just to get their attention amen what for for the hearing of the word amen and then when the word went forth Allelujah it was the attention to the bride and to give the bride Resurrection right from faith oh brother not to take us back to the pentecostos no no no no no no no no well thank God that we got what they had Plus oh yeah we got one Lutheran Plus amen oh no no don't don't add to the word god added to it amen so we got one Lutheran plus we got where the Pentecostals had plus amen what would we do what are you going to add to it the bride message there's a Pentecostal message amen and there's still too many that are focusing on Luther's message and and the men and the and the yellow and all the other messages in the Pentecostal message but how many are focusing on the bride message [Music] what is the bride message God's not a prophet no no no no no the right message was the message that God gave us through the prophet amen amen I'm here focusing on the message and you know what God has done and what God is doing through the message it's not just again it's not just you know we'll just say oh well let's Malachi 4. and God did this and God did oh yes and he opened up the he opened up the revelation of the the seals the seventh seals that were sealed and they're all open yeah you can believe that and go to hell oh yeah you got to believe that and go on with it because what is what is the only of the word what is the revelation of the Seven Seals what's it ordained and predestinated to do it is to give the bride Resurrection raptory faith Amen brother it's not just oh well it's this Doctrine and it's that Doctrine oh he preached this and then he preached this and then he preached that and and like I said you know what this is to to a lot of Believers this is just a Creed oh I believe this yeah oh I believe this yeah yeah I believe this amen but brother do we read the revealed word and what it's ordained to do what is the ordained to do it's ordained to give us Resurrection rapturing faith amen God help us please our young brothers and sisters in the name of Jesus don't let don't let a denominate your spirit come on you and think that that oh this is just a part of your Creed oh we believe this uh oh yes we believe that and so on and unfortunately to too many it is a Creed that's all they can go into into their libraries oh yeah brother's no different from what they would get in in a church concerning the the Creed the the Pentecostals believe this we believe this we believe that and there's too many this we believe this we believe this and really they don't believe it brother are we do we have the faith that God has given us in this that's what God's looking for amen oh brother we can go and with the with the revelation of perfect faith we can go with the revelation of uh oh Jezebel religion and so on we can have this Revelation that Revelation but brother what about the faith what about your faith is it increasing your faith and not only just Faith to believe in God but Faith to believe God for this hour Faith to believe God for this age amen Faith to believe what God has done but Faith to believe what God's doing amen amen Faith to believe what God's pointing us to amen so brother are we moving on oh praise the Lord I'll tell you this Luther moved on in that faith of justification oh they were experiencing justification justification and he went all around everywhere preaching preaching preaching oh yes and as I said it was either Luther or what Wesley was it he would go down to the mines where the where the men would go into the minds of work and come out and and he would be there to preach to those that were going in and then he'd wait for the Elder to come out and preach to them and he preached John Wesley he preached five times a day and we oh don't mean to offend oh yeah one time we meet every day we meet we'd have service every night oh yeah Believers would get together and fellowship oh yeah praise the Lord and of course then it got down to just uh maybe four or five times then three or four times now it's two or three times Fellowship yeah why under honor the anointing when when it first came oh no we look forward to Fellowship we just we would oh get together you know at our homes and we'd have our meals and we then we we'd all we're going to visit brother so and so now we're going to visit brother sister so-and-so NFL she will every night every night yeah every night but now it's that denominational Spirit that's on the people and it's just religion God help us Amen brother God help us that we not got not that is religion but it's something spiritual that God has given us by the grace of God Amen amen well the Lord bless you said it wasn't second Corinthians no uh second Peter chapter 2. huh brother what God has ordained to do is he doing it through you and me brother what God ordained to do through Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals he did it oh yeah they went forth preaching it by the grace of God and how did John how did John John Wesley get the revelation of sanctification I told you that there recently he was in a cottage meeting that a group was having based on Luther's teachings oh yeah he was in the cottage meeting and and they were they were administering this and they were singing and praising the Lord and oh yeah justification justification and John Wesley it struck John Wesley concerning sanctification oh yes and he was he was in one of those Cottage means and he raised his hands and started praise the Lord the Revelation struck him now brother sister what Revelation is striking us what are we looking for now what are we expecting now what are we calling for now are we really really really calling for the resurrection I mean really calling for the rapture um do you want to go amen sister do you want to go I'm sure unfortunately there's not many want to go they don't no yeah here they do but not here see it's in the heart said one time Believers got together and they're looking for the resurrection looking for the Rapture praise the Lord we're living in that hour but then that Spirit of that Revival left and just became a Creed doctrines teachings that's all oh yes and to many many so-called Believers today it's just a Creed that's all as I said this is a Creed they believe this but it's just a letter not not the spirit of it the letter oh they read it oh yeah we believe it we believe that we believe that yeah throw the book out see if you still believe it I'll tell you this regardless of what it is whether you got the book or not you still believe it Oh yes most definitely amen whether you got the book of don't add the book I tell you if you're into the revealed word of what God has done and what God's doing you you're looking for the resurrection you're looking for the Rapture let's get out of here Kevin how how much longer you want to stay in this whole world mostly want to stay in this insane world and it is insane it's not normal no more no listen if our grandparents were to come back they wouldn't want to stay that's true and and so like I said my grandparents that were they were old-fashioned in this church or that church or whatever but if they came back they wouldn't want to stay why they would see the way people were dressing they would see the way people were after him see the way they were eating this world gone crazy they would if my grandfather came back sure he would want to stay you want to go on because they were living in an insane world you're talking about uh you know where they let it go on because why because the the so-called Mental Hospitals are not big enough to take everybody oh yeah because I tell you that they when it comes in in the mind of God they are crazy it's a crazy world it's an insane world oh yeah and brother God's going to throw a lot of them into the Great Tribulation I pray Grace for us for the resurrection Grace for the Rapture boards get out of here and God's God's going to change it and God's going to wave it all off amen praise the Lord amen was the second Peter chapter 2. almost an hour and verse 1. but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you yeah and there's many a false teacher around the message be on your guard please this be simple let's be sincere with the Lord don't make it bigger than what it is don't make it smaller than what it is leave it the way it is amen leave it the way it is but there are those that want to add to it then they'll take from it oh you make it bigger than what it is make it smaller than what it is no leave it the way that it is and I'll tell you God by the Holy Ghost will Quicken it to your heart so again there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring them upon themselves Swift destruction God help us and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of yeah amazing brother let's be sincere and there's many a so-called believer that's brought reproach on the word because of their attitudes because of the way they've lived because of their actions and reactions oh yeah well as I said over the years I've had to deal with with a lot of spirits yeah and I I do recall Ministry many times in in other churches and Believers would what's his problem what's he preaching about why because their spirits that were on them oh yeah and they thought I was just criticizing finding fault no no I was trying to bring correction amen because because there's different believers who had different spirits on them and they catch this and they run with that and they run with that they get fanatical with it I said oh God I said have mercy on us please oh yes I've had to preach it many times in different churches message churches yeah and I've as I said I preached it one time and the pastor was on my right and he was sitting in the front and the certain things I preached and he turned around and looked at his audience and there was about maybe over 200 people there and he turned around looked at his other shook his head no no and so what I had to do I knew I said oh Lord so I would go back and prove it by the word I give the scriptures oh yeah so Lord God help us why because a lot of them just say oh God sent a prophet so we believe the message they don't believe the message they don't because they believe God sent a prophet and that's it my brother is more to it than that most definitely so again verse two and many shall follow their own their pernicious Ways by reason of whom they the way of truth shall be evil spoken of see the way they're the way they're living oh yes I went into a bank some years ago and I was doing some banking there and the the teller looked at me and they said oh what religion are you so I explained to them they said oh but this is you're different they said we we have other customers here and they they seem to be professors believe the same thing but this is we don't believe it because of their attitude and because of the way they they act and I said oh you really believe that oh yes they said and they identified certain ones and I know who it was and I believe I also I understand I said I know what you're what you're talking about why it was the witness that those Believers gave turned them away from the message but the witness that I was giving brought their attention to the message and their attitude was different so what what are what are what is their reaction to you to your Witness because some are really really fanatical you know when when they're going to witness for this and say this and say that you know you gotta have a right spirit you got to say it with the right Spirit a right motive right objective right attitude amen and they'll discern that they'll know always most definitely brother and that's why that's why many have been turned away from the message and I'll tell you those that turn them away because their attitude wasn't right the spirit wasn't right they're going to answer it the day of judgment keep your attitude right keep your spirit right that's why that that the disciples questioned Jesus and why Jesus would do this and why Jesus would fellowship with this one and especially when he was dealing with that woman at the well yeah and then there's Believers we could would condemn you for fellowshipping with this one a fellowship with that one or allowing this one in your church allowing that one to do in your church yeah because we've been we've had we've had believers stop supporting us why because of uh we've all certain brothers and sisters came into the church and we referenced them we respect them and so on oh yeah yeah and because I but maybe some of you know what but that that certain brother that we Reverend some respect and yet there's other believers stop supporting us because they felt we should you know step on that person no according to their faith God bless him see s self-righteous attitudes self-righteous Spirits no no don't do that brother I tell you because if there's anyone could have a self-righteous Spirit could be Jesus to you yeah so don't turn them down because because the Lord will turn you down keep your spirit right in your attitude right but he said many shall follow their own their pernicious ways and by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of oh yeah as I said many many of so-called Believers they've been out there being Witnesses or witnessed or witnessed and to bring a reproach on the word instead of bringing people to the word they'll turn them away because of their spirit and their attitude amen and he said through covetousness shall they with thin words he said make merchandise of you whose judgment now of long time lingers not and their damnation Slumbers not the grace of God be with us brother sister listen more and more Ministries around the message are preaching filler around the message and they are making the people feel convenient and comfortable like their denominational brethren the teaching is keeping them separated from their denominational Brethren but they're not getting into the prophecy of rapturing faith and the rapture they're into Doctrine and theology but not rapturing faith brother every message that God has ever brought was predestinated and ordained to give us a faith to please God the Pentecostal Revival giving them the faith for the gifts of the spirit amen and on down through there was different different revivals to give them this Faith give them that faith and they will grow they would live it amen they go out and they testify of it amen what about the faith that God has given us in this hour brother it's for the resurrection and for the rapture believes thou this God help us many recognize the end time and the message to separate them from denominations but faith they're not really recognizing the faith to comprehend the faith for the rapture they think it's oh the message oh yeah we're against denominations we don't believe this we don't believe that brother the message was ordained to give us the faith for the rapture faith for the resurrection Faith to get out of here faith for a new Heaven and a new Earth but too many are caught up with just Doctrine this Doctrine oh this is the message this this doctor it's this Doctrine no no brother God the faith of the message that God gave Luther he went forth Justified yeah the faith that God gave Wesley they went forth sanctified and the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit they went forth living that life what about message Believers there's too many just caught up with the letter of the word the letter of the message the doctrine but not the life there's it's a life brother there was a Justified life a Sanctified life a life that had the gifts of the Spirit access to the gifts of the Spirit oh yeah the prophet of God said he said when it comes to the gifts of the Spirit under the Pentecostal Revival he says right there he said he said it's still there he said God didn't take it away God didn't take away justification God didn't take away sanctification and he soon when he restored the gift of the spirit and he said they're right there on the Shelf he said and if you want him he's concealable he said but God is moving on to the to the to the revealed word and to give us Resurrection rapturing faith but he said we're not denying this we're not denying that no no no it's it's God it's justification plus sanctification and his justification plus sanctification plus the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen God doesn't do away with it amen now it is the faith of the Resurrection the faith for the rapture praise the Lord is not taken away God's not going to take away and throw it away no no no God's going to move you on putting in a more emphasis on something else amen oh yeah and you need and really to to get it the way you you need to get it to have it the way you really need to have it believe it the way you really need to believe it you need to believe justification you need to have sanctification you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord so you keep moving on Amen now people think well that was back there I don't need that what does she do you need it you need you need the revelation of justification you need to know Betty you've been Sanctified and you need to know that you have access to the gifts of the Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen oh yeah God's there to bless you God's there to give you this God's there to do this for you amen and what when we were going on with a greater Faith greater glory religion greater Faith pray to God the Resurrection The Rapture we're going we're going amen amen oh we're going not we will go we're going oh he has let's believe in the present tense Resurrection the present tense rapture brother the the born-again life is resurrection if you were born again you've been resurrected amen and not only that we've been raptured oh it was there definitely definitely definitely there as I said when I preached that in another church there and and the preacher was looking around us didn't agree with it I maybe felt maybe different when he he was different when I gave the scriptures and I said oh yes I said we've been resurrected oh yeah I told him I said I want you to I want to let you know I've been resurrected and that's where the Pastor said no you're not Resurrected oh yes I said I said I've been resurrected and not only that I said I've been raptured and because they were you know and everybody was pulling back from the from the response to the ministry I said I'll prove it to the by you by the word as you want to know I should go to the Bible Isaiah is right there I said Ephesians chapter 2. he said well yeah I said you at the Quicken Resurrected I said I'm not saying physically I said in my soul I said I've been resurrected and knowing that I said I've been raptured they said you have yeah I said you as he quickened you as he made alive you as he resurrected who were dead in trespasses and sins amen now I said just go on down I said and you'll find I said right there and I said it says and he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places I said I've been raptured amen I've been ruptured you know what's going on there the prophet is answer the question he said he said we've been caught up into Heavenly places in Christ he said what's going on there he said the word is being revealed amen I said see I said I've been raptured I hope you are amen I've been resurrected I've been raptured amen I said in my soul and I said brother and my body is on its way amen I've been cut off in my soul caught up spiritually amen now I said I'm going to be caught up physically I've Been Changed I said from the inside out I said God is working out what he worked in amen what he put in your soul Through The Bachelors of the Holy Ghost I said he's working at Heaven on a daily basis till one day there's going to rise the generation Hallelujah that's going to experience the change in their body in their soul and in their body amen again the prophet said remember your your you gotta you got your your soul your spirit and your body he said you had that three full part of you and God he said move God starts in the soul and he works and through the soul he said he'll influence your spirit and through your spirit he said he'll influence your body the prophet said that yes he said it he explained amen yeah he's moving on moving on to one day the chain he's going to so influenced the body that is going to be changed and the glorified body don't lose please don't lose the revelation it's not me that lives it's Christ that liveth in me amen brother eat the Wonders living the life now and to oh yeah he's leaving it morning noon and night to one day as we go on we go on we go on to one day he's going to change us into a rapture and so when I explained it to him thank the Lord the pastor oh he smiled and raised his hand oh he said that's right apparently he had he had not noticed it he had never heard it before amen and I said he has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and again to remind you what the prophecy is going on there he said what's going on there he said the word is being revealed amen amen he said we're caught up in a Heavenly place in Christ the word is being revealed but for to give us Resurrection Rapture faith hallelujah thank you Jesus I trust they believe it now amen again it was second Peter and I'll try to oh my just share a couple of thoughts or quotes with you and just finish this scripture right here verse 2 again in second Peter 2 many shall follow their own their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of and through covetousness shall they with thin words make merchandise of you whose judgment not now of a long time lingerth not and their damnation slumbereth not for if God spared not the angels that sin but cast them down to Hell and delivered them into the chains of Darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spirit not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly amen Grace Grace Grace again the teaching is to keep them separated from their denominational Brethren but they are not getting into the prophecy of the rapture the faith of the rapture they recognize the end time and the message to separate them from the nominations but not really recognizing the faith for the rapture brother how many really realize that in all that God has done and all that God is doing through the ministry of William Branham that is to give us rapturing faith not just to get us out of denominations but to get us home it says they recognize say it again they recognize the end time and the message to separate them from denominations but not really recognizing the faith to comprehend the faith for the rapture like Israel's Faith to bring them out of Egypt but Falling short of the Revelation to give them Faith to possess the Promised Land there's one thing to get out of Egypt another one to get into the Promised Land oh yeah they were following Moses to come out but they questioned Joshua about going in yeah God help us amen they fell short of that Revelation to possess the Promised Land oh brother there's many that are that are that have come out brother Brown referred to it as Egyptian denominational bondage that's what he called it that's what he called it he said Egyptian denominational bondage Israel was brought out but then they had to go in to possess the land we've been brought out well that's good thank the Lord but now God wants us to go in and possess the land and there was a generation of the Jews that came out of Egypt but didn't wouldn't go into the Promised Land because they felt oh they are bigger than us oh we can't do this we can't do that and Joshua said if God before us who can be against us brother we come out of the nominations what about going into the resurrection what about going into the rapture God help us as it was then so it is now many in this spiritual wilderness are doing God a service without his will make sure you're in the will of God and unfortunately many are falling under the indictment of the crucifying of crucifying the word and it was the message I indict this generation for the crucifixion of Christ what about you I pray Grace you're not crucifying Christ in your life you young brothers and sisters be on your guard don't crucify Christ in your life again for the moms and the dads don't crucify Christ in your home don't crucify Christ in your job God help us unfortunately many are falling under the indictment of crucifying the word in the message indictment the prophet said notice he said they the worshipers The Men Who had looked for the promise The Men Who had looked for it through years and ages with nothing to do but in that constant Seminary but he said they had divided the word according to the teaching of the Seminary and it said they had missed their very truth why because they took what the Seminary said not what the word said and it says they the priests the ministry of that day there at their headquarters the ministry of that day was killing the very God killing the very lamb he said the very one that they claimed they were worshiping they were killing don't kill the one you profess to worship don't kill his influence in your life he's worked it in now let him work it out and today he said I indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their Creeds and denominations they are crucifying to the people the very God that they claim that they love and serve I indict these ministers in the name of our Lord Jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days of Miracles this past and that the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted creeds I indict them as guilty and the blood of Jesus Christ upon their hands for crucifying afresh the Lord Jesus the second time don't crucify him in your life let him have control unfortunately there's many a Believers as continues to crucify Christ continues to crucify Christ's influencing their everyday living he wants to control this for you he wants to control that don't crucify let him have control he said listen up on any of these words that they have substituted Creeds for I indict them as guilty and the blood of Jesus Christ upon their hands for crucifying afresh the Lord Jesus and he said you read the same Bible that any other man can read but you've turned down the spirit of God till the Bible said you be given over to a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by it you actually believe that you are right and the Bible says that you would believe it and be damned by the same lie that you believe to be the truth therefore I indict you by the word of God you are teaching the people a hearer and crucifying the principles of Christ he said you're crucifying the principles of holiness and the life above he said that the person might walk out on the street and be a different person he said more and more Believers are becoming intellectual and less and less spiritual in thought in word and deed and I have found that over the years as I've said over 50 years of experience around the ministry I have witnessed many have become more and more intellectual they believed this they believed that but it's all in their head but about in your heart let's be more spiritual less religious amen let's be spiritual in our thoughts spiritual in our words and in our Deeds by the grace of God amen turn with me to final scripture right here first John chapter 2. amen Grace he said listen he said we see that the Protestant organization yet blindly as the same nature of the Catholic Church yeah the Bible calls the Catholic Church a and caused the Protestant church arlets and he said that the was the mother of harlots and he said and this people that's a hill Fame woman who doesn't live true to her marriage vows and we all claim to be the bride of Christ and yet so untrue what would make the entreueness by living contrary to the discipline that God has laid out for his bride to live by amen just think are you living contrary to the discipline of the word and I'll tell you there's many a congregation doesn't like disciplined preaching oh yeah they want to oh good good good preach this preach this good good this doctrine that Doctrine oh yeah but what about laid it in at a personal way to get you to line up with it that's different there's one thing to come out there's another thing to go in yeah oh yeah they wanted to come out because they were slaves purely wanted to come out oh yes yes they got out oh yeah God fed them in the wilderness oh yeah but what about going in Joshua took in some and they went in and looked around the promised land always a good land wonderful land oh but the inhabitants they got afraid of the inhabitants no we can't go we can't possess they're two they're two powerful why they're big and so on they didn't matter Joshua Joshua kept saying well he said if God before us who can be against us let's go yeah so brother we come out I will go on in there's one thing to come out of denomination another thing to go in to the promised land and many oh yeah is like I said when I was at church one time years ago and we're at the altar praying and that believer next to me prayed as and I heard heard them saying oh Lord thank you forever bringing us out of denomination now Lord we don't we don't have to be subject to any man anymore I said Lord I said they need a revelation I said because you brought them out from there plus you you bring them in here you still get they still got to come under a minister but that believer felt no we're free we don't have to oh yes there's many a Believer felt like that years ago maybe some still feel that way no no God will bring you out from that but he'll bring you under another Ministry they left for the ministry of Moses but to come under the ministry of Joshua God still requires it on you make your calling and your election sure please make sure your spirit is right and your attitude is right he said by living contrary to the discipline that God has laid out for his bride to live by he said the Bible and he said it is the infallible word of God and he said therefore we find out that the Protestant Church in order to have an organization separates itself even from the scriptures easy to make its organization oh yeah God help us he said I dare anybody to come under the blood of Jesus Christ and claim any promise he's a God's obligated to take care of it but they won't do it he said they'll come and say oh Lord I want to do something give me a great gift Hallelujah Lord glory to God I believe I got it Allelujah it'll never work he says you might bring forth a lot of psychology but it won't work he said God's got to recognize that repentance God's got to do that and he said we could say a lot along that line is I hope you are understanding amen brother foreign for a Revival everywhere and now you're going to have a Revival when the word itself can't work for the people let the word work through you in your home in your job yes in your church he said I'd like for every for somebody to answer that for me how can it do when you deny the very Revival itself well did the prophet speak of them or well did he speak of them form of godliness amen Grace that we don't have a form of godliness and his Believers that have forms of godliness it's not the real life of Jesus but they have a form of godliness Professor to believe the message he said listen they are crucifying the effects of the Gospel upon the people by their creeds he said that's the crucifixion and that's where the public is set in these big morgues called churches and draw a line of a Creed and he said the word of God can't have an effect upon them because they condemn the very things that God Christ said would take place it just don't come according to their Creed and neither did Jesus come according to their understanding of his coming amen he said they have crucified the effects of the word don't crucify the effects of the word in your life it's Christ that worketh in US willing to do
