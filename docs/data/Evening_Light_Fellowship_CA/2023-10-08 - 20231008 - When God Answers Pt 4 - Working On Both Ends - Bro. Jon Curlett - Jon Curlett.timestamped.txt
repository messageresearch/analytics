[42:41] Father Lord You're a rock in a weary
[42:44] land a shelter in a time of storm Lord
[42:47] in a world that is in chaos that is Lord
[42:50] spiraling Lord into the gutter Lord
[42:53] You're a shelter Lord You're a place
[42:54] where we can go Lord You're a a firm
[42:57] foundation Lord You're a steady anchor
[43:00] that holds Lord Jesus and Lord we're so
[43:02] thankful to have that this morning Lord
[43:04] that when all around us seems chaos and
[43:07] nothing seems to be working right Lord
[43:09] we know that yet you are the God in the
[43:10] midst of the storm Lord and that you
[43:12] hold your children in your hand Lord and
[43:14] nothing can pluck you from it Lord we're
[43:17] praying you'll just settle our hearts
[43:18] Lord our minds our souls this morning
[43:21] once again Lord as your word is preached
[43:23] Lord may it just reach into our lives
[43:25] Lord may it give us that settled feeling
[43:27] Lord regardless of how the circumstance
[43:29] looks Lord may we trust that you are in
[43:31] it all we pray Lord bless your people we
[43:34] ask Lord Just Have Your Way this morning
[43:37] we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[43:40] amen amen God bless you turn if you
[43:42] would to Jeremiah chapter 10 Jeremiah
[43:44] chapter 10 want to welcome again sister
[43:47] Kimberly's Father Anthony all the way up
[43:49] from the United States just got a chance
[43:51] to spend some time with them at our
[43:53] house on Friday night so God bless you
[43:54] good to see you here amen we've got
[43:56] brother Kingsley who's headed to Nigeria
[43:59] Lord willing to bring his wife home so
[44:02] we want to be praying for that we want
[44:03] to be trusting that the scripture says
[44:05] that God looked at man and said it's not
[44:07] good for man to dwell Alone brother the
[44:09] Kingsley has a a perfectly acceptable
[44:11] wife I say that the Lord needs to bring
[44:13] her home so we trust that we trust that
[44:15] God will do that so keep praying that
[44:17] her immigration paperwork will go
[44:18] through and just resolve it beautifully
[44:20] so he can bring sister Melody home with
[44:23] him as well amen want to welcome our
[44:24] visitor as well this morning God bless
[44:26] you just trusting that uh God will touch
[44:28] your soul this morning amen Jeremiah
[44:31] 10:23 says this l oh Lord I know that
[44:34] the way of man is not in himself it is
[44:37] not in man that walketh to direct his
[44:40] steps I took that to the Amplified it
[44:42] says Lord I know that the determination
[44:44] of the way of a man is not in himself it
[44:47] is not in man even in a strong man or in
[44:51] a man at his best to direct his own
[44:54] steps amen God bless you you can have
[44:57] your seats this morning and we're taking
[44:58] a a final service on this thought of
[45:01] when God answers and I'm I'm taking a
[45:03] subtitle this morning of working on both
[45:05] ends and I was talking to someone after
[45:07] last service and I said I don't know
[45:08] what I'm going to preach on Sunday I've
[45:10] got one quote left and this is the one
[45:13] quote service so this is what happens
[45:15] when God does it and I was just dwelling
[45:16] on it and and just it seemed to open up
[45:18] to me and and I just wanted to to bring
[45:21] it this morning to the church so
[45:22] trusting it'll be a blessing but I
[45:24] opened up with this this scripture in
[45:25] Jer
[45:26] Jeremiah for a very particular reason
[45:28] because we're talking about when God
[45:30] answers and and if we look at the
[45:31] Scriptures it says that there's nothing
[45:33] in us that is capable of leading Us in
[45:36] the way that we ought to go and we look
[45:38] around and we see many of us and and
[45:40] maybe some of us are gifted
[45:41] intellectually some of us are gifted
[45:43] physically we've got genetic things on
[45:45] our side maybe we're born into wealth
[45:46] we're born into a family that is very
[45:48] successful and I'll tell you what we can
[45:50] do okay for a while but in the end what
[45:52] happens is we always go overboard in
[45:54] some area and that's what what takes us
[45:56] over and and you can go overboard in
[45:58] what is nominally a good area and it'll
[46:02] be too far and it'll get you out of
[46:03] balance and you'll run all the way down
[46:05] and all of a sudden you're out in the
[46:06] middle of nowhere and things have fallen
[46:08] apart and you say what happened I was
[46:09] only doing what I ought to do no you
[46:11] went too far because there's nothing in
[46:13] you the checks and balances of a
[46:15] Christian the the checks and balances of
[46:16] a word are not there to keep us amen but
[46:19] we we're speaking on when God answers
[46:21] and I believe as Christians as Believers
[46:23] we know that there's nothing in us that
[46:25] can get us through the way that God can
[46:27] amen that we go to him for answers
[46:29] because we know that we've tried our
[46:31] answers and our answers just don't work
[46:33] they just don't take us to that to that
[46:35] place amen and you look even around this
[46:36] world and you look at the richest and
[46:38] the the wealthiest and the most famous
[46:40] and they are usually the most miserable
[46:42] people on the world the most gifted ones
[46:44] that are out there and what happens is
[46:46] they have such great gifts but because
[46:48] they can't control it they go overboard
[46:50] and they're the ones that are usually in
[46:51] the greatest addictions because they
[46:53] can't manage themselves they can't
[46:55] manage manage the wealth they can't
[46:56] manage the fame and these different
[46:58] things and you know you know we talk
[47:00] about Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
[47:02] and usually they end up truly famous for
[47:04] all the wrong reasons you look at Elvis
[47:06] Presley one of the most gifted singers
[47:08] ever he came from a Pentecostal
[47:09] background he was gifted to to to sing
[47:12] the gospel and he turned it into rock
[47:14] and roll and what did he do he ended up
[47:16] dying on a toilet with a drug overdose
[47:20] that's where he ended up a gift given to
[47:22] him by God and he couldn't handle it and
[47:24] Satan took it and turned him into a drug
[47:25] addict in the end bloated heavy all
[47:27] these different things amen but we know
[47:29] that even as Believers we know that
[47:31] things sometimes seem to take a turn and
[47:32] they go sideways and they spiral and it
[47:35] seems like things are out of control
[47:36] seems like God hasn't answered that God
[47:38] hasn't provided but I want to take a
[47:40] just this thought as I said this morning
[47:42] on working on both ends because I want
[47:45] to show you how God is working sometimes
[47:47] and and how our need is often the answer
[47:50] to somebody
[47:51] else's that God can be doing something
[47:53] to you for the benefit of somebody else
[47:55] but before he comes back around to meet
[47:57] your need or he'll meet your need in
[47:58] meeting their need even as the case may
[48:01] be let me say this this morning there's
[48:03] nothing so beautifully crafted as the
[48:05] plan of God for your life you know we've
[48:07] got Hollywood today and they're trying
[48:09] to always write a new a new script and
[48:11] we've got authors are trying to write a
[48:12] new book that can somehow give a Twist
[48:15] that nobody has seen coming but I'll
[48:17] tell you God knows how to put twists
[48:19] into our life that we don't see coming
[48:21] and that's where we have to believe and
[48:23] trust by faith that God is in it even
[48:25] when we don't see the twist coming when
[48:27] we can't see a way out when we can't see
[48:28] a way through when we can't see a way
[48:30] over or under And yet when it all
[48:32] happens all we do as we look back and we
[48:34] can only say How Great Thou Art Lord you
[48:37] had your hand in it all the time you
[48:38] knew what you were doing and I just had
[48:40] to trust you all the way through God
[48:42] knows how to write a script amen the
[48:44] beautiful thing is he's given us the
[48:46] CO's notes he's given us the the the the
[48:48] Junctions he's given us the pivot Points
[48:50] all of it is in here if we'll only take
[48:52] it and trust it and believe it amen but
[48:54] I want to take this thought of working
[48:56] on both ends and I'm going to start in
[48:57] the book of First Kings chapter 17 very
[49:00] familiar story we know and it says and
[49:02] Elijah the tishbite who is of the
[49:04] inhabitants of Gilead said to Ahab this
[49:06] is the king he said as the Lord God of
[49:08] Israel liveth before whom I stand there
[49:10] shall be no do or rain these years but
[49:12] according to my word in other words it's
[49:14] not going to rain you're not even going
[49:15] to get due on the ground until I say so
[49:18] and the word of the Lord came to him
[49:19] saying get you hence and turn Eastward
[49:21] and hide Yourself by the Brook Cher
[49:23] that's before Jordan and it shall be
[49:25] that you shall drink of the Brook and I
[49:27] have commanded the Ravens to feed you
[49:29] there so God has gotten him to pronounce
[49:32] judgment and then he says I've prepared
[49:34] a place of Refuge where you can have
[49:36] food and you can have water he says go
[49:38] there and so Elisha did exactly that he
[49:41] went to where God said he says and he
[49:42] went and did according to the word of
[49:44] the Lord for he went and dwelt by The
[49:46] Rook Chariot that's before Jordan and
[49:48] the Ravens brought him bread and flesh
[49:50] in the morning and bread and flesh in
[49:51] the evening and he drank of the brook so
[49:53] God told him I'll provide and then God
[49:55] provided it says and it came to pass
[49:58] though after a while Supernatural
[50:01] provision the Ravens are bringing him
[50:03] food every day it says that the brook
[50:05] dried up because there have been no gra
[50:07] no rain in the land you can live without
[50:10] food for a while you can't live without
[50:11] water and it's the water that dries up
[50:14] and so now Elijah's in a pinch this is
[50:16] the plot twist we didn't see coming God
[50:18] said go here I'll provide for you you
[50:20] get there and then God pulls the
[50:23] provision prophet of God has done
[50:25] exactly what God has told him to and yet
[50:27] now God has yanked his provision away it
[50:31] says and the word of the Lord came to
[50:32] him saying arise get thee to zarap which
[50:35] belongeth to ziden and dwell there in
[50:37] other words go to zarap and stay there
[50:39] he says behold I have commanded a widow
[50:42] woman there to sustain thee now let's
[50:44] stop for a second because Elijah's in a
[50:45] tight spot here the land's had no rain
[50:47] in years he's leaving what was a source
[50:50] of water he's going out into the land
[50:53] there's a price on his head no nobody
[50:55] likes this judgment that he's called
[50:57] down from God on them he's a he's a man
[50:59] that is unpopular and now God says leave
[51:02] here go to zarapa and go to a widow
[51:04] woman God's not catering to his needs
[51:07] God has put him in a tight spot and now
[51:10] he's out of God's favor it would seem
[51:12] and God saying now go to a widow
[51:15] woman God no doubt Elijah is thinking
[51:17] God you've stopped providing for me and
[51:20] it was all of a sudden we don't see this
[51:22] idea that the brook dried up gradually
[51:24] one day it was there and the next it
[51:26] wasn't he had it and then he didn't so
[51:29] this thing just happens in a in a moment
[51:31] and and it would seem that God is pull
[51:33] back his hand of favor from Elisha or
[51:35] Elijah rather and then he says now go to
[51:37] a widow
[51:38] woman you you want to you want to go you
[51:42] know go into somebody's house you want
[51:44] to take their food and water a widow
[51:46] woman seems the wrong choice you know
[51:49] Lord why don't you send me to a wealthy
[51:50] family that has a nice air conditioned
[51:52] home they've got plenty of money in the
[51:53] bank they've been able to survive real
[51:55] well I won't be a burden on them but he
[51:58] says no I have commanded a widow
[52:01] woman let me tell you that widow woman
[52:03] had no idea a prophet was coming her way
[52:06] but God says I've commanded because when
[52:08] it's in the heart of a child to obey God
[52:10] whatever God tells him to do they're
[52:11] going to do when it comes their way amen
[52:14] it it made no sense but this is only
[52:16] Elijah's side of things now Elijah has
[52:19] all Faith Elijah's not worried don't get
[52:21] me wrong but he's sitting there and it
[52:22] looks like he's done everything right
[52:24] and then God pulls back his hand of
[52:25] favor now let's go to the other side and
[52:27] listen to this quote he says now there
[52:29] was a woman in the land now neither one
[52:31] of these people know each other he says
[52:34] but she must have been an honorable
[52:35] woman she must have been the type of
[52:38] woman that Elijah was a man because God
[52:40] chose that woman out of all the woman
[52:42] that there was in Israel to entertain
[52:44] his prophet he never would have chosen
[52:46] an immoral woman to entertain his
[52:48] prophet and that woman was a widow woman
[52:50] the drought was in the land and she
[52:52] started out after death of her husband
[52:54] she had a little baby rais she was
[52:55] struggling to try and make a living for
[52:57] the little fellow and finally the bread
[52:59] begin to cease she sees the the the Slow
[53:03] Hand of Death coming into her home cuz
[53:07] she can see that she's getting less and
[53:09] less oil she's getting less and less
[53:10] flour every day and it's dwindling bit
[53:13] by bit and she can see the end coming
[53:16] it's this agonizing death that's
[53:17] creeping towards her and her little boy
[53:20] it says and it came to pass to a place
[53:22] one day when she went to look at her
[53:24] little fellow she saw saw his little
[53:25] sleeves out torn up she must have looked
[53:28] at herself in the mirror seen how she'd
[53:29] left the table with something on it for
[53:31] the baby and her own cheekbones was
[53:33] sticking out her little frail looking
[53:34] arms she didn't mind it for herself but
[53:36] the little boy she was trying she just
[53:39] didn't want to see him die so finally
[53:41] one day she went to the meal barrel and
[53:43] there was just one handful of meal left
[53:45] she goes over to the cruise to see how
[53:46] much oil and just about a good
[53:48] tablespoon that stood between her and
[53:50] death he said I suppose that night there
[53:53] was an allnight prayer
[53:56] meeting he says isn't it strange how God
[53:59] lets us get right down to the end of the
[54:02] road no doubt but she checked up said
[54:05] Lord God I've served you I've done all I
[54:07] know how to do I've met your
[54:08] requirements and here I've got one
[54:09] handful of meal a spoonful of oil
[54:11] between death for my child and myself
[54:13] all night long she must have prayed and
[54:15] when the little fellow would wake up and
[54:16] turn over and say mama would you just go
[54:18] to the cupboard and see if there's just
[54:20] a little bit of that bread left she'd go
[54:22] back cry a little then she would come
[54:23] back give him a little little water to
[54:25] drink for she knew she had just this
[54:28] little bit and it and it had to maybe
[54:30] make the next day and the little fellow
[54:32] would couldn't sleep good because of
[54:35] hunger what a place this is the
[54:38] provision of God for his Prophet coming
[54:40] her way he says and the woman as she
[54:42] seen those that crucial hour coming no
[54:45] doubt she checked up and said Lord I've
[54:47] done all I know how to
[54:48] do he says when you've done everything
[54:51] you know how to do and met every
[54:52] requirement that God has required that
[54:55] that's where Faith takes a hold that's
[54:57] where faith comes in if you've met every
[54:58] requirement that God required you to do
[55:00] then sometimes God tests your faith to
[55:03] see what kind of a reaction you'll have
[55:05] on your action oh he's good at that it
[55:08] just proves whether you really believe
[55:10] what you think you believe he says you
[55:13] know he does that many times but she was
[55:15] certain she'd walked upright before God
[55:18] and God proved it by inviting his
[55:20] Prophet to live with her see God
[55:22] confirms things so the morning was
[55:24] breaking the birds begin to sing as Dawn
[55:26] began to break she looked at that little
[55:28] fellow again she patted him she knelt
[55:30] down and said Lord God he'll be getting
[55:31] up in a few minutes I'll go prepare the
[55:34] last thing I've got and give it to him
[55:36] and then I'll take him in my arms and
[55:37] we'll die
[55:38] together he says she went out and got a
[55:41] handful of meal he says now meal the
[55:43] meal offering which means Christ the
[55:45] word and when they ground that meal
[55:47] offering in the days of the Bible they
[55:48] used a certain bur that ground every
[55:51] little bit of bit every little bit of
[55:53] meal just exactly the same there's no
[55:55] difference in it it was all the same
[55:56] size it was very fine he says that types
[55:58] this that means Jesus Christ is the same
[56:01] yesterday today and forever and when God
[56:05] ground his life out of him at Calvary he
[56:07] gave it to the church that he be the
[56:09] same yesterday today and forever we
[56:12] don't believe in just a historical
[56:14] Christ but we believe that he's alive
[56:15] and well today that he's working in his
[56:17] church that he still heals that he still
[56:19] delivers that he still provides he does
[56:21] all of these things the way he did Back
[56:23] Then he said and then she goes and gets
[56:26] the oil the oil represents the spirit
[56:29] that's why we anoint with oil it
[56:31] represents the spirit she put the oil
[56:33] and the meal together and began to
[56:35] prepare it he says and when the spirit
[56:37] and the word gets together something's
[56:39] going to take place she was at the end
[56:42] so she got the word and the spirit and
[56:44] began to mix it together now it's ready
[56:47] for baking now we got a story the plot
[56:50] thickens amen the prophet has no food
[56:52] because God has turned off his
[56:55] Supply why now Elijah doesn't know why
[56:59] all he knows is God's going to provide
[57:01] for me but God has turned off Elijah's
[57:04] provision so that he can go and provide
[57:07] for a widow the need of the Widow has
[57:10] turned off Elijah's Supply cuz she needs
[57:12] Elijah she needs the god of Elijah to
[57:15] come into her life and without it her
[57:17] and her child are going to die so God
[57:18] puts his profit in hardship so that he
[57:21] can go and help a woman amen what is it
[57:24] she had a heart for God he says he
[57:25] commanded her she had a heart for God
[57:27] and whatever God would tell her to do
[57:30] she would obey it whatever it was amen
[57:32] her willingness to believe God was the
[57:34] same as him commanding her to do it
[57:37] wasn't optional to her she's a Believer
[57:38] she's a Christian and so she's going to
[57:40] take God at his word it says so he arose
[57:43] and went to zarap and when he came to
[57:45] the gate of the city behold the widow
[57:48] woman was there Gathering of sticks and
[57:50] he called to her and said fetch me I
[57:52] pray thee a little water in a vessel
[57:54] that I might drink now we go back to the
[57:56] story it says she goes out in the yard
[57:58] to pick up two sticks did you notice the
[58:00] Bible said two sticks if you notice the
[58:02] two sticks represented the cross and he
[58:04] says now self sacrifice now she'd mixed
[58:08] the word and the spirit together and was
[58:10] ready to put it to the fire and she goes
[58:12] to pick up those sticks and perhaps she
[58:14] got the last one in her hand and was
[58:16] starting back to the house and she
[58:17] looked at the gate and there was this
[58:19] gentle looking old man perhaps
[58:21] baldheaded Whiskers hanging down
[58:23] standing leaning across the gate and he
[58:25] said would you just fetch me just a
[58:27] little drink of water she looked at him
[58:30] and thought well I've got about a half a
[58:32] gallon in the house that the poor old
[58:35] fell looks so thirsty I'd be willing to
[58:36] divide it with him and she might have
[58:38] said yes kind sir I'll get you a little
[58:40] of the water cuz the Springs have dried
[58:42] up and everything all the water's dried
[58:43] up and she started to get the water and
[58:46] he knew so her actions her response to
[58:49] his request told him this is the woman
[58:52] you're looking for all right he he says
[58:55] you see God answers on both ends of the
[58:59] line now listen now he's putting a
[59:01] timeline on this two hours before we're
[59:05] coming right down to the wire Church
[59:07] she's at the last of her flour and oil
[59:09] she's going to die after she eats this
[59:12] and Elijah has everything he needs and
[59:14] then God turns off the Taps two hours
[59:17] before everything was good until it
[59:19] wasn't
[59:20] good right Elijah's need comes on
[59:22] suddenly she's had this long slow
[59:24] agonizing March towards hunger but they
[59:26] both have the same need she needs food
[59:30] he needs water she's got water he's got
[59:33] food but neither one knows it neither
[59:37] one knows it all right he says he says
[59:40] two hours before that the brook had
[59:42] dried up on top of the mountain where
[59:43] Elijah was and he said Elijah go down to
[59:45] the city keep walking till you find a
[59:47] woman with two sticks in her hand she's
[59:49] going to find you he says God does
[59:51] things real church we believe that that
[59:54] God does things real I'm going to share
[59:56] with you some real things that God has
[59:57] done in the last couple weeks in this
[59:59] church but God does things real he is
[1:00:01] not just a god of The Ether he's a God
[1:00:03] that's interested in our everyday needs
[1:00:06] and lives the scripture says that he's a
[1:00:08] high priest that can be touched by our
[1:00:10] infirmities by the struggles by The Pain
[1:00:12] by the suffering by the difficulties we
[1:00:14] go through he says I've sent you down
[1:00:17] there and she's going to feed you she
[1:00:19] hasn't got nothing in the house but I'm
[1:00:21] going to feed you and he walked down the
[1:00:23] street till he seen that woman packing
[1:00:25] those two sticks and that must be her so
[1:00:28] he had to catch her attention he said
[1:00:29] would you fetch me a little water and
[1:00:31] she said I will now catch the twist here
[1:00:34] because why did she say I will cuz she
[1:00:37] has lots to
[1:00:39] share water's not her
[1:00:41] problem right her her Christianity
[1:00:44] hasn't left her in this trial that she's
[1:00:46] going through and so she has lots of
[1:00:48] water relative to her need and so she's
[1:00:50] willing to do the
[1:00:52] water but what's her weak spot
[1:00:58] what's the pain Point what's the
[1:01:01] difficult part of her life food she got
[1:01:04] plenty of water no
[1:01:06] food so what does God do goes to a pain
[1:01:10] point he says and as she was going to
[1:01:13] fetch it he knows she's the one he says
[1:01:19] and he he just adds on to it he twists a
[1:01:23] knife just a little bit more he called
[1:01:25] to her and said bring me I pray thee a
[1:01:27] morsel of bread in thine hand you know
[1:01:30] what a morsel is a little bit you know
[1:01:32] how much she had church a little
[1:01:35] bit he didn't know it he asked for a bit
[1:01:38] but he was asking for every bit that she
[1:01:41] had in her house he was saying give me
[1:01:44] your last give me your
[1:01:46] all and she said as the Lord thy God
[1:01:49] liveth I have not a cake but a handful
[1:01:51] of meal in a barrel and a little oil in
[1:01:52] a cruise behold I'm gathering 26 that I
[1:01:55] may go in and dress it for me and my son
[1:01:57] that we may eat it and
[1:01:59] die the Last
[1:02:03] Supper he says this and as she turned
[1:02:06] and started he said and just bring me a
[1:02:08] little morsel of bread in your hand
[1:02:10] Elijah seeing that Vision already knew
[1:02:13] what the conditions were he didn't ask
[1:02:16] for more than she had he asked for only
[1:02:18] what she had and she said as the Lord
[1:02:20] liveth Elijah knew she was a Christian
[1:02:22] than a Believer as the Lord liveth I've
[1:02:24] got just a handful of meal a spoonful of
[1:02:26] oil that I've already prepared I've
[1:02:28] dressed it and got it ready and I'm
[1:02:29] taking these two sticks to make a little
[1:02:31] cake for my son and I and we're going to
[1:02:32] eat it and
[1:02:33] die and Elijah said to her fear not go
[1:02:37] and do as thou Hast said but make me
[1:02:39] thereof a little cake
[1:02:41] first bring it unto me and after make
[1:02:44] for thee and thy son he tells her to do
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:47] impossible go use everything you've got
[1:02:50] give it to me first and then after I
[1:02:53] I've eaten then you guys can go and you
[1:02:55] can make another one for
[1:02:57] yourself he says now here comes a great
[1:03:01] lesson Elijah said bake me one first oh
[1:03:04] what is it there what lesson do we learn
[1:03:06] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:03:08] righteousness bake me one first and she
[1:03:11] looked and she said I wonder who that is
[1:03:13] there's something about that man that
[1:03:15] seems to be different and he said make
[1:03:17] me one first and bring it and she
[1:03:19] started in to do what he
[1:03:21] said and then he said for thus saith the
[1:03:24] Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal
[1:03:26] shall not waste neither shall the cruise
[1:03:28] of oil fail until the day that the Lord
[1:03:30] sendeth rain upon the earth now H catch
[1:03:33] what happens here Elijah is speaking the
[1:03:35] creative word of
[1:03:38] God this ain't just a promise this is a
[1:03:41] creative work because he says if you'll
[1:03:43] do it then you'll never run out of flour
[1:03:46] and you'll never run out of oil every
[1:03:48] time you pour it out there'll be some in
[1:03:50] there the next time every time you use
[1:03:52] it up there's going to be more provided
[1:03:53] for you that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:03:56] who's speaking it
[1:03:59] Elijah but she's got to believe who's
[1:04:01] speaking is behind that is the Lord God
[1:04:04] and then he says then she heard the
[1:04:06] comforting word that always Comforts for
[1:04:10] thus sayeth the Lord the barrel will not
[1:04:11] be empty nor the cruise run dry until
[1:04:13] the day that God sends rain on the earth
[1:04:15] what was it that very dark crucial
[1:04:18] moment come but God's always on the
[1:04:21] scene he says if if you're sure that
[1:04:25] it's God if you've repented of your sins
[1:04:28] if you've met God's requirement then be
[1:04:31] sure that God will keep his promise when
[1:04:34] things go wrong the first thing we do is
[1:04:35] we check up we say Lord am I living
[1:04:38] right am I doing your will you can be
[1:04:41] living right and be out of the will of
[1:04:42] God you can have a clean life and not be
[1:04:45] obedient to God's will for your life he
[1:04:47] may be telling you to do something go
[1:04:49] somewhere let something go add something
[1:04:51] in that's all that's what he's looking
[1:04:53] for is full of obedience not just in
[1:04:55] your conduct but will you obey the voice
[1:04:58] of the Lord in your
[1:04:59] life he said if you've done all that
[1:05:02] then be sure that God keeps his promise
[1:05:05] if when men and women could only realize
[1:05:07] that God's obligated to his promise and
[1:05:09] if you've met his requirements if you've
[1:05:11] confessed your sins you've made your
[1:05:13] wrongs right you've done everything God
[1:05:14] has required then do what hold on to God
[1:05:18] he says you've got to see
[1:05:21] daylight It's always darkest just Before
[1:05:24] Dawn remember he says he's got to bring
[1:05:27] it through just be certain that it's God
[1:05:29] and he will take care of the rest of it
[1:05:31] if you're sure that it's God now watch
[1:05:35] her response now what a woman what a
[1:05:38] woman of faith it says and she went and
[1:05:41] did according to the saying of Elijah
[1:05:43] and she and he and her house did eat
[1:05:47] many days it was what fellowship with
[1:05:50] spirit and Truth with the word and the
[1:05:52] spirit brought them what food for many
[1:05:55] days she sustained him for many days she
[1:05:58] didn't die her child didn't die Elijah
[1:06:00] eventually leaves and the Miracle stays
[1:06:03] cuz she obeyed God it says the barrel of
[1:06:06] meal wasted not neither did the cruise
[1:06:08] of oil fail according to the word of the
[1:06:10] Lord that he spake by Elijah Elijah
[1:06:12] spake by
[1:06:14] inspiration and God backed him up to the
[1:06:16] hilt and he blessed that woman until the
[1:06:19] drought went away and she could she
[1:06:20] could receive what she had need of we're
[1:06:23] going to take a look at a second small
[1:06:24] event it seems in insignificant in
[1:06:26] scripture but I'm setting us up for a
[1:06:28] grand finale today this is in Luke 21
[1:06:30] and this is Jesus and it says he looked
[1:06:32] up and he saw the rich men casting their
[1:06:35] gifts into the treasury and he saw also
[1:06:37] a certain poor Widow casting in thether
[1:06:40] two mites so there's a widow comes up
[1:06:42] she's declared as poor and she puts in
[1:06:45] two mites two mites is worth 12 minutes
[1:06:48] of work new land's uh minimum wage says
[1:06:51] $15 an hour so she put $3 in
[1:06:55] she gave an offering to the Church of
[1:06:58] $3 it says and he said of a truth I say
[1:07:01] unto you that this poor Widow has cast
[1:07:04] in more than they all she gave three
[1:07:06] bucks they were perhaps giving hundreds
[1:07:08] thousands tens of thousands of dollars
[1:07:10] into the temple and he says she gave
[1:07:12] more than all of them he says for all of
[1:07:15] these have of their abundance cast into
[1:07:17] the offerings of God he says they have a
[1:07:18] lot and so they gave a lot but she of
[1:07:21] her penury had cast in all the living
[1:07:23] she had her in her in her lack has given
[1:07:28] every cent she had now Church she had $3
[1:07:31] to her name three measly bucks I think
[1:07:34] Samuel my three-year-old has more money
[1:07:37] than that woman had and she gave every
[1:07:39] penny to it I'm not calling for money I
[1:07:42] said before this church out gives
[1:07:43] churches two and three times at size I
[1:07:45] don't pull for money we've never have in
[1:07:47] the ministry you give of your own Hearts
[1:07:49] but there's a I'll tell you there's been
[1:07:50] times where I know how tight things are
[1:07:52] and I see what people give into the
[1:07:54] church and I say in my heart they ought
[1:07:55] not to do that we don't need it that bad
[1:07:59] but you know what that's between you and
[1:08:00] God that's between you and God we never
[1:08:03] pull for money you know it you're
[1:08:05] witness and a testimony to it but you do
[1:08:07] it why do you do it because God puts it
[1:08:09] on your heart not cuz I ever talk about
[1:08:11] it not because brother Gerald ever
[1:08:12] talked about it but we just lay it out
[1:08:14] there and the people respond as they
[1:08:15] want to but you look at this Jesus looks
[1:08:19] on this and he Praises her for her
[1:08:22] sacrifice but he doesn't do a thing for
[1:08:24] her
[1:08:26] life he doesn't stop he doesn't come up
[1:08:28] and say ma'am we don't need that money
[1:08:31] nearly as much as you do he didn't stop
[1:08:34] her he let her do it you know and
[1:08:36] scripture's Silent about this we have no
[1:08:39] clue what happened to this woman later
[1:08:42] but listen to what the the prophet of
[1:08:43] God says he says for one day we read in
[1:08:45] the Bible where Jesus was watching the
[1:08:47] rich put lots of money in the offering
[1:08:49] but a poor Widow came by and put in
[1:08:51] about three pennies he says Lord guess
[1:08:53] if if I'd have been standing there I'd
[1:08:54] have run up and grabbed her hand and
[1:08:56] said don't do that sister we got enough
[1:08:58] in here but you were standing there and
[1:09:01] you didn't stop her for you knew what
[1:09:03] laid just ahead he says you knew you'd
[1:09:07] return it to her H
[1:09:09] hundredfold we're speaking about when
[1:09:11] God answers and when he's working on
[1:09:13] both ends and I was curious about this
[1:09:15] scripture because we don't hear anything
[1:09:18] but you know what it does say in Malachi
[1:09:20] 3 it says bring ye all the ties into the
[1:09:22] storehouse that there may be meat in
[1:09:24] mine house and prove me now herewith
[1:09:27] sayith the Lord of hosts he says prove
[1:09:28] me with this he says if I will not open
[1:09:31] to you the windows of heaven and pour
[1:09:33] you out a blessing that there shall not
[1:09:35] be room enough to receive it he didn't
[1:09:38] say he give you all this money we don't
[1:09:39] preach this this ridiculous uh you know
[1:09:42] uh wealth Doctrine this this Prosperity
[1:09:45] Gospel but the scripture says Paul said
[1:09:48] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:09:50] or his seed begging bread his children
[1:09:52] begging bread he said he'd always meet
[1:09:55] our
[1:09:56] need always meet our need that's the
[1:10:00] richness that he pours out and we've
[1:10:02] seen it we've seen it when the world
[1:10:03] goes into a an economic depression we
[1:10:07] hold on to our jobs by God's grace when
[1:10:09] we lose our jobs miraculously we make it
[1:10:12] through the year don't we brother Matt
[1:10:14] brother Matt lost his job for a year and
[1:10:15] he came out on the other side basically
[1:10:16] the same as he went in without a job how
[1:10:18] do you do that Jehovah Gyra he provides
[1:10:22] right he sees the needs and he provides
[1:10:23] for it brother would say this he says
[1:10:25] and you have to forsake everything
[1:10:27] that's right to follow him but that he
[1:10:30] that will forsake all and follow him God
[1:10:33] pays off in the Bountiful blessings of
[1:10:35] richness his richness not as the world
[1:10:38] sees it but as God sees it he says
[1:10:41] there's nothing to compare with it now
[1:10:44] I've taken a story from from Elijah's
[1:10:47] time I've taken a story from Jesus time
[1:10:49] and you know we look at these stories
[1:10:50] and this is the problem so often with
[1:10:52] religion today is that it's all in the
[1:10:55] past it's all in a time that's way
[1:10:58] before us it's people and situations
[1:11:00] perhaps that that we can't identify with
[1:11:02] but the scripture is not there for us to
[1:11:04] just hear about but the scripture is
[1:11:06] there so that we'll experience the same
[1:11:08] things that it does so that we'll
[1:11:10] recognize God doing the same thing in
[1:11:11] our lives as he did then and so we've
[1:11:14] got a right in fact we've got an
[1:11:15] obligation to look into the word and
[1:11:17] expect God to do what he says there
[1:11:20] today remember Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ
[1:11:22] the same yesterday
[1:11:24] today and forever now I want to talk
[1:11:25] about that story remember brother
[1:11:27] Brandon was up in those Hills and he was
[1:11:29] thinking on this scripture it was this
[1:11:31] Mark 11 it says for verily I say unto
[1:11:33] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:11:36] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:11:38] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:11:40] his heart but shall believe that these
[1:11:42] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:11:44] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:11:47] brother bams preaching about this in
[1:11:48] that message my new ministry and he says
[1:11:51] the presence of the Lord comes down and
[1:11:53] God starts to talk to him about what
[1:11:55] this really looks
[1:11:56] like okay we've got the fourth Elijah
[1:12:00] anointing right we had Elijah Elisha
[1:12:02] John the Baptist then we have William
[1:12:04] brandham and then we've got the Elijah
[1:12:05] going to the Jews the fourth one okay
[1:12:07] this is the Elijah anointing coming down
[1:12:09] and God tells him he says I'm going to
[1:12:12] show you what this means and he's out
[1:12:15] there squirrel hunting remember and he's
[1:12:16] in a place and there was no squirrels
[1:12:18] around they've been hunting and hunting
[1:12:20] and there was nothing to be found and he
[1:12:22] couldn't see any and and and God said he
[1:12:24] said I'm going to show you what it means
[1:12:26] for this scripture and he says what do
[1:12:28] you want to happen and brother Braham
[1:12:29] said I want three
[1:12:31] squirrels and God said then you tell me
[1:12:33] where to put them and I'll put them
[1:12:35] there and remember what brother Braham
[1:12:36] did is he said I want them in three
[1:12:38] places where no self-respecting squirrel
[1:12:40] would be and he called for the first one
[1:12:42] and he called for it and as soon as he
[1:12:44] did it stepped out and he shot it then
[1:12:46] he called for the second one the second
[1:12:48] one stepped out and he shot that but he
[1:12:51] called for three and remember he's
[1:12:53] waiting waiting for the third one and
[1:12:54] the third one took hours to come out
[1:12:56] what was God doing he was developing
[1:12:58] faith in the word of God as spoken
[1:13:01] through his own lips God was teaching
[1:13:03] him there's a new stage of your ministry
[1:13:05] coming and I've got to train you into it
[1:13:07] you know on on Saturday I think it was
[1:13:09] there yeah it was Saturday I was out
[1:13:11] with Samuel and he we were in the garage
[1:13:13] and he picked up a pedal bike so he's
[1:13:15] got one of those Strider bikes you know
[1:13:17] that you just go with your legs and you
[1:13:18] push on well he's seing all the kids
[1:13:20] riding their pedal bikes including the
[1:13:22] neighbor boy that the same age as him
[1:13:24] and so he picked it up and he he he he
[1:13:27] sat on the bike and he stood there and
[1:13:28] put his feet on the pedals he's got
[1:13:29] amazing balance he stayed up for about
[1:13:31] six or seven seconds without tipping
[1:13:32] over but then he tipped over tipped it
[1:13:35] up again got on tried to balance and it
[1:13:38] wouldn't go so he said Daddy can you
[1:13:40] help me so I said sure so I took him out
[1:13:44] and I I grabbed him by the back of his
[1:13:46] coat to hold him up and then I said you
[1:13:48] just have to pedal and so he's trying to
[1:13:51] Pedal but he's pedaling backwards so
[1:13:53] he's hitting the brakes instead of the
[1:13:54] forward so I said no you got to put the
[1:13:55] pedal at the top and so showed him all
[1:13:57] these things well as soon as he gets
[1:13:59] going I'm holding an up by his jacket so
[1:14:01] he can do whatever and it doesn't matter
[1:14:02] it doesn't matter how he steers how hard
[1:14:04] he pedals whatever I've got him held up
[1:14:06] so he can do anything but as he started
[1:14:08] to get the hang of it the grip started
[1:14:10] coming off and I started letting him do
[1:14:12] more and me do less what was I doing I
[1:14:15] was teaching him faith in his own
[1:14:17] gift so for the first bit I've got a
[1:14:19] firm grasp then as he goes within 5
[1:14:22] minutes he could do it on his own but
[1:14:24] slowly slowly slowly that hand's coming
[1:14:26] off until now he's got to trust that he
[1:14:29] can do it I've showed him he can do it
[1:14:32] then he's got to trust that he can do it
[1:14:34] guess what eventually I went in the
[1:14:35] house he stayed up for two hours and
[1:14:36] just went biking around and around and
[1:14:37] around and I watched him and he' come to
[1:14:39] a stop and he sure enough he' kick the
[1:14:40] pedal up and put it in position move
[1:14:43] himself forward power down and off youd
[1:14:45] go again then pretty soon he's saying
[1:14:47] Daddy watch me wheelie which just means
[1:14:49] bumping over things right that's his
[1:14:51] wheelie but what is it he's getting he's
[1:14:54] having faith in his ability to operate
[1:14:56] the gift of riding a b bicycle God's
[1:14:59] doing this with brother Bram he's saying
[1:15:00] brother brandom I'm giving you Authority
[1:15:02] here and the first time he does it God
[1:15:04] makes it happen immediately second time
[1:15:06] he does it immediately third time God
[1:15:08] makes him wait and he's got to sit there
[1:15:10] and have faith that that squirrel is
[1:15:12] going to appear and sure enough it
[1:15:13] doesn't he kills it the next day he
[1:15:15] comes back and God says God the presence
[1:15:18] of God comes down he says what do you
[1:15:19] want today he said well I had 114
[1:15:22] squirrels I got three yesterday 117 120
[1:15:24] is a nice round number I want to get
[1:15:26] three more squirrels and so he does and
[1:15:29] what happens is he asks for Three
[1:15:30] Squirrels the first one comes out and he
[1:15:33] shoots it immediately Waits a little
[1:15:35] while the second one comes out brother
[1:15:37] Ram says I've only missed five times
[1:15:39] this year and he misses three or four
[1:15:41] shots in a roll bang bang bang bang he
[1:15:42] keeps missing the squirrel and he can't
[1:15:45] understand it and then God says that's
[1:15:46] not where you said it was going to come
[1:15:48] out so brother Brandon waits till it
[1:15:51] goes to where he said it was going to be
[1:15:52] boom shoots it and it drops so he's got
[1:15:55] two he's sitting there all day nothing
[1:15:58] else appears it's getting dark he's got
[1:16:00] a little tiny Target scope on doesn't
[1:16:02] let the light in he says I'm I'm headed
[1:16:04] home and God says what about the third
[1:16:05] one you ask for a third one don't you
[1:16:07] believe there's a third one he said yes
[1:16:09] Lord I do but this is I can't see
[1:16:11] anything now and God said well where did
[1:16:13] you say it was he said right there and
[1:16:15] he looked up and he said and I saw what
[1:16:16] I thought was a squirrel just a lump
[1:16:18] there so I shot it it dropped he says
[1:16:21] but I don't actually know if it did or
[1:16:22] not
[1:16:24] he said so I saw another one right there
[1:16:25] so boom shot that went over grabbed that
[1:16:28] one he's got his three goes get back to
[1:16:30] get the fourth and he can't find
[1:16:32] it and he says I'm reaching all around
[1:16:34] and he said I saw a hole in a stump and
[1:16:36] I put my hand down in the stump and I
[1:16:37] thought maybe it was in there he says I
[1:16:40] thought I could feel it but I couldn't
[1:16:41] get my hand all the way the hole was too
[1:16:43] tight so he says I just left it so he
[1:16:45] goes back to the hunting lodge and he
[1:16:46] tells the brothers what's been going on
[1:16:49] including the seventh one that he
[1:16:50] believes he he shot
[1:16:53] and so brother Tony's there and he prays
[1:16:55] over the meal and they says Lord if
[1:16:57] brother bram's telling the truth help us
[1:16:59] find that squirrel
[1:17:01] tomorrow right so now brother bram's in
[1:17:03] a pickle because he didn't call for four
[1:17:04] he called for three and now we got a
[1:17:06] brother saying we'll find the fourth or
[1:17:07] let us find the fourth to prove that
[1:17:09] it's true here's what he said he says I
[1:17:11] never said I'd find the squirrel in the
[1:17:12] stump under that anointing I said I shot
[1:17:14] the squirrel this is in his story to the
[1:17:17] brothers of course I couldn't get the
[1:17:18] squirrel cuz if I did that that would
[1:17:20] have been more than I had said he called
[1:17:22] for three he got three he says I
[1:17:24] couldn't even get the fourth cuz I
[1:17:25] didn't call for the fourth he says just
[1:17:27] exactly what I had said under that
[1:17:28] anointing that's what God produced so I
[1:17:30] didn't say nothing about that so brother
[1:17:32] rah's all worried and he he he says he's
[1:17:34] thinking I got to tell brother Tony that
[1:17:36] squirrel may not be there because that's
[1:17:38] not what I asked for and that's not what
[1:17:40] God promised he says and I said brother
[1:17:42] Tony I never said the squirrel was in
[1:17:43] there I said I could feel it I when it
[1:17:46] raised up it would drop he says but
[1:17:48] brother Tony said it'll be there it'll
[1:17:50] be right there in the stump so now catch
[1:17:52] this thing brother Tony is saying I
[1:17:54] believe your story and now brother
[1:17:56] Tony's faith is embroiled in the story
[1:17:58] it's TW it's entwined with brother
[1:17:59] brandom's story brother Tony says I
[1:18:01] believe it I believe we're going to find
[1:18:03] it he says and so I went up on that we
[1:18:06] went on up and I left the car and I
[1:18:07] started to to turn
[1:18:09] back and say there's something wrong I
[1:18:12] better tell Tony now CU if that squirrel
[1:18:13] isn't in that hole or in that stump I
[1:18:15] come back with no squirrel at all then
[1:18:17] according to the way he prayed last
[1:18:18] night he'll still believe I told the lie
[1:18:20] I said God you know with my Bible I've
[1:18:22] told honest truth and God knows that's
[1:18:24] the truth it's just the truth he says
[1:18:26] and I went on and something just drove
[1:18:29] me on and I went walking up through the
[1:18:32] woods hunting I kept thinking what if
[1:18:33] that squirrel isn't there and he gave me
[1:18:36] his hunting knife so I could cut the
[1:18:37] whole bigger to reach in and get it and
[1:18:39] something said to me if it isn't there
[1:18:40] if it isn't there what makes the
[1:18:42] difference now God's saying to him he's
[1:18:44] saying it's your experience not brother
[1:18:45] Tony's experience what does it matter if
[1:18:47] brother Tony
[1:18:48] believes I did that for you I didn't do
[1:18:50] that for brother Tony so now you're
[1:18:52] trying to get it it to work out the way
[1:18:54] to brother Tony
[1:18:55] wants and and brother BR says I said he
[1:18:58] wouldn't believe me he prayed and said
[1:18:59] if we find the squirrel we'll know that
[1:19:00] our brothers told the truth and that
[1:19:02] great anointing come and said just say
[1:19:04] the squirrel will be up there and you'll
[1:19:06] get
[1:19:07] him now he's been told to speak for
[1:19:10] whose sake brother
[1:19:13] Tony's he said I thought surely Lord
[1:19:15] that surely this will be seven time
[1:19:17] straight while this anointing is on me I
[1:19:18] said is that you he said say what you
[1:19:20] will I said I shall find that world and
[1:19:24] then what happens he had a Glory
[1:19:26] Hallelujah shouting the anointing left
[1:19:29] me that's the trial Now isn't it we have
[1:19:32] great Services we have great moments we
[1:19:34] have great experience with God and then
[1:19:37] when that anointing lifts off you're
[1:19:38] left
[1:19:40] with stinking
[1:19:42] flesh Fallen
[1:19:44] mind and Satan trying to beat it all out
[1:19:47] of you
[1:19:49] again he says I hunted till 9:30 what we
[1:19:52] were supposed to do I went up out the
[1:19:53] hill at 9:30 looked in the hole felt
[1:19:55] around and cut and there was no squirrel
[1:19:57] there at all in the hole I felt all
[1:19:59] around he says now what I was picking up
[1:20:01] was little fine Grassroots or roots of
[1:20:03] trees I was picking up and feeling it
[1:20:04] fall off the stick when I run the stick
[1:20:06] in and pull it up like that so he
[1:20:08] thought it was fur but it was just
[1:20:09] little bits of of tree and and and lint
[1:20:11] and stuff he says and I was pick I
[1:20:14] thought I was picking up the squirrel
[1:20:15] and it was sliding off the stick but it
[1:20:17] was little roots and Things No squirrel
[1:20:18] in there I thought now what will I do I
[1:20:20] said here it is 9:30 I got to go back I
[1:20:22] P picked up my rifle and started down
[1:20:24] the hill and something said did you not
[1:20:26] say you would find the squirrel I said
[1:20:28] where would I find
[1:20:30] him he says now God being my solemn
[1:20:33] judge with his word here I'm a man of 50
[1:20:36] years old a preacher of the Gospel
[1:20:37] standing in the Pulpit something said
[1:20:39] look under that little piece of bark I
[1:20:42] said Lord I wouldn't doubt you for
[1:20:43] nothing I walked up and picked up the
[1:20:46] bark and there was no squirrel there he
[1:20:48] said just before I did it something said
[1:20:51] what if he's not there
[1:20:53] what if you've been fooling yourself
[1:20:55] what if this is just a mental conception
[1:20:57] what if this is just something in your
[1:20:58] head Church Satan is always there to try
[1:21:01] and knock us off of our faith to knock
[1:21:03] us off of our confession to knock us off
[1:21:04] of our profession to knock us off of the
[1:21:06] experience we've had with God he's
[1:21:08] always there God's talking to him and
[1:21:12] Satan's right there as well what did he
[1:21:14] say I said oh he'll be there I picked it
[1:21:17] up and there was no squirrel there he
[1:21:19] says I looked down with amazement and I
[1:21:21] saw a little bitty piece of graay
[1:21:23] sticking out from under a leaf I pulled
[1:21:25] it up and there laid the squirrel making
[1:21:26] it just exactly right what he said to do
[1:21:30] he says down the hill I went and told
[1:21:32] them about it and we rejoiced and when I
[1:21:33] come to the car Charlie standing there
[1:21:35] in Banks they were talking and said
[1:21:37] wasn't it strange that Tony would say a
[1:21:38] thing like that in his prayer as well as
[1:21:40] he loves brother brandham and why would
[1:21:42] he doubt his word and say that brother
[1:21:44] Bram says this see he just had to say it
[1:21:46] that way for God knew that I would stand
[1:21:49] in the Pulpit this morning and claim the
[1:21:51] same thing cuz what would have happened
[1:21:53] is he would have told the story exactly
[1:21:56] right and people would have said you've
[1:21:57] only got six
[1:21:59] squirrels where's the seventh he said
[1:22:01] brother Tony had to cut get me to go
[1:22:03] back and get that seventh one so that
[1:22:05] when I stood here I'd have a witness
[1:22:06] that all seven were there he says you've
[1:22:10] got to watch what man says and then what
[1:22:12] God says because what God says is
[1:22:15] true now here's the thing brother baham
[1:22:17] is going through this whole experience
[1:22:19] right this is creative word coming out
[1:22:22] of his lips
[1:22:23] and he he says to God he says God is
[1:22:25] this my new ministry is this a change in
[1:22:26] my Ministry now remember what is
[1:22:29] Ministry
[1:22:31] serving serving this is not a new gift
[1:22:34] for brother Bram to prop himself up to
[1:22:36] create some new wave amongst the people
[1:22:38] to build himself a huge Church to get
[1:22:40] massive donations or draw people to him
[1:22:43] this is to serve with that gift so God
[1:22:45] is doing this for somebody else's sake
[1:22:48] not for
[1:22:50] his right now I want to go to the story
[1:22:53] of sister Hatty Wright now we know this
[1:22:55] story I know but I don't think that
[1:22:58] everybody recognizes the full story and
[1:23:00] so I want to talk about her sacrifice
[1:23:02] this morning as we're finishing this
[1:23:03] thought I'm working on both ends because
[1:23:05] it just it just ties it together so
[1:23:07] beautifully now he says that poor Widow
[1:23:10] so he's talking about sister hadti right
[1:23:12] now he he's comparing her to the Widow
[1:23:14] that Jesus saw that gave everything to
[1:23:16] God Amen by way of an offering he says
[1:23:18] that poor Widow sister hady Wright who
[1:23:20] had just told me she had tried to give
[1:23:21] to this church $50 on a pledge to help
[1:23:24] build a new church and brother Robert
[1:23:26] Roberson wouldn't take it and only let
[1:23:28] her give 20 of it and I said to myself
[1:23:30] when she was speaking I'll give her back
[1:23:32] the
[1:23:33] 20 that's what we think isn't it I got
[1:23:37] it she doesn't I'll give it back to her
[1:23:39] he says but God said to me in my heart
[1:23:41] now not by Vision in my heart so this is
[1:23:43] just a thought from God drops down and
[1:23:45] says what when Jesus was standing
[1:23:47] watching the Widow put in three pennies
[1:23:49] where were those thousands of dollars
[1:23:51] were laying what would you have done I
[1:23:52] saidwell I would have if I would have
[1:23:54] been standing there I would have said we
[1:23:55] don't need it sister we got plenty of
[1:23:57] money but Jesus never said it he let her
[1:23:59] go on and do it because he knew what was
[1:24:01] down the road so he's speaking of the
[1:24:03] woman in jesus' time Jesus knew what was
[1:24:05] down the road now he flips it back he
[1:24:08] says so help me God is my solemn judge
[1:24:11] God knew what was down the road for her
[1:24:14] had he Wright who had give the $20 and I
[1:24:17] rub my hand in my pocket to get my
[1:24:18] pocketbook to give her $20 back and say
[1:24:20] sister hadie but he said don't do it and
[1:24:23] then just a few minutes when the
[1:24:24] question is brought up about Jehovah
[1:24:26] Gyra she said that's nothing but the
[1:24:28] truth he says it come from a poor widow
[1:24:31] woman's heart God knowing she'd ask
[1:24:33] future tense the greatest thing that
[1:24:35] could be done so she makes this
[1:24:37] sacrifice she does something for God
[1:24:40] unnecessary nobody asks her to do it she
[1:24:43] offers 50 they only take 20 20 bucks
[1:24:45] then will be about $200 now and brother
[1:24:48] Bram says I was going to give her back
[1:24:49] the money and God says don't do it why
[1:24:52] she'd done her part under
[1:24:57] inspiration God said don't do it I'm
[1:24:59] working don't mess this
[1:25:01] up he knew that he had something greater
[1:25:04] for her down the road you I like I said
[1:25:07] before I can see where brother brandom's
[1:25:09] coming from sometimes we see people that
[1:25:10] make the least give the most and we say
[1:25:12] they ought not to do that but God sees
[1:25:14] what's coming down the road God leaves
[1:25:16] no debts unpaid God leaves no debts
[1:25:18] unpaid amen and don't think that God
[1:25:21] doesn't see it he sees every penny he
[1:25:24] sees every penny now let's go back to
[1:25:26] the main story of had Wright because
[1:25:28] remember what happens is brother bram's
[1:25:29] sitting at the table and he's working
[1:25:31] from both ends now okay brother Ram says
[1:25:33] is this my new ministry is this what's
[1:25:36] going on and now she has a need in her
[1:25:38] life and he says he says when I was
[1:25:41] sitting at the table eating dinner I've
[1:25:42] been explaining what faith was he's
[1:25:44] explaining about that scripture we
[1:25:45] talked about and sister Hattie was
[1:25:47] sitting way back out towards another
[1:25:49] room she didn't have much to say never
[1:25:51] does it's not always about who's
[1:25:54] talking he says and while we were
[1:25:56] talking I'd say if the Lord showed me a
[1:25:58] vision that something was to take place
[1:26:00] then I would could say it and that's
[1:26:02] what raises my faith I said when the
[1:26:04] Lord shows me what will take place then
[1:26:06] I've Got Confidence it's going to be
[1:26:07] that way but remember under this new
[1:26:09] ministry he's not getting Visions God's
[1:26:12] telling him what to say and then he does
[1:26:13] it he speaks it he said I've been
[1:26:17] telling them about these this experience
[1:26:18] about the speaking the squirrels into
[1:26:20] existence and I said do you know know
[1:26:22] what I want to ask you something brother
[1:26:24] Banks Woods was sitting next to me at
[1:26:25] the table and then sister hadie sitting
[1:26:27] way back the boys were sitting there Mrs
[1:26:29] Right Mr Right and shall be sitting back
[1:26:32] to my left he says now listen don't miss
[1:26:33] this I'm going to show you the
[1:26:35] sovereignty of God and while we were
[1:26:38] talking they said I want to ask you
[1:26:39] something what put those squirrels there
[1:26:41] there's no squirrels in the woods I'd
[1:26:43] hunted and hunted I'm not the best of
[1:26:45] Hunter but I've hunted since I was a
[1:26:46] little boy I had hunted close and they
[1:26:48] were in the most ridiculous places and
[1:26:50] in the most ridiculous way I could call
[1:26:52] them I said what put them there I said I
[1:26:55] wonder if it is that my Ministry is
[1:26:57] fixing to take a change that the god of
[1:26:59] Abraham is confirming his promise as he
[1:27:02] did to Abraham when he was up on top of
[1:27:03] the mountain and he needed a sacrifice
[1:27:06] instead of his son he says Jehovah Gyra
[1:27:09] God my provider he says performed a
[1:27:11] miracle and placed a ram a 100 miles
[1:27:14] back he was three days journey an
[1:27:16] ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day he
[1:27:18] says then he lifted up his eyes and saw
[1:27:20] the mountain a far off and then went to
[1:27:21] the mountain and up on top of the
[1:27:23] mountain and he says a a whole Ram back
[1:27:25] in there he says while a ram back in
[1:27:27] there a sheep wild animals would have
[1:27:29] killed it and then up on top of the
[1:27:31] mountain there's no water how did that
[1:27:33] Ram get up there what happened remember
[1:27:34] Abraham's on top of Mount Mariah and
[1:27:38] he's going to sacrifice his son by God's
[1:27:40] command and God's testing him he doesn't
[1:27:42] ever want you to sacrifice your children
[1:27:44] that's why he destroyed the Canaanites
[1:27:46] but he was testing Abraham's faith and
[1:27:48] then as Abraham raises the knife God
[1:27:50] says hold Abraham I know that that you
[1:27:52] believe me now and then he looked in the
[1:27:54] thicket and there was a ram a male sheep
[1:27:57] caught in the thicket by his horns and
[1:27:59] brother BR saying how does a sheep get
[1:28:01] caught in the horns and not get torn
[1:28:02] apart by some
[1:28:03] animal he says God spoke that Ram into
[1:28:08] existence he says God needed a sacrifice
[1:28:11] to prove to Abraham that he was Jehovah
[1:28:13] Gyra so this was a proving to Abraham of
[1:28:16] who God was he says the very God of
[1:28:19] creation spoke a ram into existence now
[1:28:22] it wasn't a vision the ram wasn't a
[1:28:23] vision he said he killed the ram blood
[1:28:25] came out of that animal it wasn't a
[1:28:26] vision it was a ram and I said that same
[1:28:29] God hallelujah that Jehovah Gyra he's
[1:28:32] just as much Jehovah Gyra today as he
[1:28:34] was on the mount with Abraham he can
[1:28:36] still produce an animal to his glory
[1:28:39] those squirrels were not a vision I shot
[1:28:41] them blood came out of them I dressed
[1:28:42] them and ate them they weren't Visions
[1:28:44] they were squirrels I said that same
[1:28:46] Jehovah Gyra now watch what he says this
[1:28:48] is all about he says trying to get his
[1:28:52] promise over to me number one in my
[1:28:55] thickness and dullness of mind he could
[1:28:58] speak my need into existence the same as
[1:29:02] he could speak Abraham's need into
[1:29:05] existence now let's stop here when those
[1:29:07] scrs appeared who spoke the word did God
[1:29:10] speak it no he said you pick it you
[1:29:13] speak it you choose where they go how
[1:29:15] many all these things and so brother
[1:29:17] bradam speaks it and like he said I put
[1:29:18] him in the most ridiculous places where
[1:29:20] no squirrels would ever be
[1:29:23] now God tells him to speak he speaks and
[1:29:26] whatever he says happens God does It On
[1:29:29] The Backs side of the Wilderness in
[1:29:30] private just like he did with Abraham
[1:29:32] but notice brother Braham says he's
[1:29:34] speaking my need into
[1:29:37] existence did Brother random need
[1:29:40] squirrels he had 107 114 that year is he
[1:29:44] going to die of hunger if he doesn't get
[1:29:46] those squirrels no the squirrels are not
[1:29:48] brother bram's need what he needs is
[1:29:51] faith in the oper Iration of the gift
[1:29:52] that God's given him he's got to have
[1:29:54] faith that when God tells him to do
[1:29:56] something and speak something it will
[1:29:58] happen if he speaks it according to
[1:30:00] inspiration right so what is it this is
[1:30:03] the literal creative word of God flowing
[1:30:05] through the lips of a man and it is the
[1:30:07] same power as if Christ himself spoke it
[1:30:11] brother says the need I have is the
[1:30:13] faith what he's saying is the faith to
[1:30:15] speak and believe what he tells me to
[1:30:17] speak what is it it's the Elijah
[1:30:19] anointing this is Malachi 4:5 stepping
[1:30:22] into maturity this is where I started
[1:30:25] with the widow woman is because that's
[1:30:27] the Elijah anointing it goes to someone
[1:30:30] in need it's not for itself it goes to
[1:30:33] someone that's in need God's preparing
[1:30:35] for brother Brandon for something far
[1:30:36] greater than squirrels squirrels is
[1:30:39] where he starts to prove it but God
[1:30:41] wasn't showing off to brother brandham
[1:30:42] God doesn't clown around brother
[1:30:44] brandham said he's not showing off just
[1:30:45] saying hey look what I can do he's
[1:30:47] saying no there's a purpose behind this
[1:30:49] and he's speaking a need into he's
[1:30:51] meeting the need that's in brother
[1:30:53] braham's Ministry in brother braham's
[1:30:55] life because he's about to step into his
[1:30:57] greatest role which is what Revelation
[1:30:59] 10:7 he's about to open the seals under
[1:31:02] the inspiration of the holy spirit with
[1:31:04] the angel standing there he's about to
[1:31:05] step into that fullness of the son of
[1:31:07] man Ministry the revealing of God in
[1:31:09] this age and he's got to have faith that
[1:31:11] as God tells him to move and speak that
[1:31:14] whatever he says is going to happen and
[1:31:17] he's tying it to scripture all the way
[1:31:18] through there and brother Ram says I had
[1:31:20] no more than said that that sister hadie
[1:31:22] sitting there crying now hadn't said a
[1:31:25] word and she said that's nothing but the
[1:31:27] truth he says she said the right thing
[1:31:31] you know what that tells me it matters
[1:31:33] what we say and it matters that we say
[1:31:35] it in the first place you sit in church
[1:31:37] and say the amens don't matter the amens
[1:31:39] matter when you say praise the Lord when
[1:31:42] you give him worship and praise it
[1:31:44] matters because when you say the right
[1:31:46] thing then God comes right behind it and
[1:31:48] he works in your
[1:31:50] life amen
[1:31:52] he said she said just like Banks said
[1:31:54] down there I heard her voice he says as
[1:31:56] it what that anointing swept from my
[1:31:58] ears like up into the woods Mrs Wright
[1:32:00] sitting back there with her little girl
[1:32:02] was trying to interpret what EAS said I
[1:32:04] couldn't hear Mrs Wright that super
[1:32:06] anointing swept over me and said tell
[1:32:08] Hattie that she's found Grace in the
[1:32:10] sight of God who would have
[1:32:13] thought who would have thought you say
[1:32:15] that's nothing but the truth and God
[1:32:18] comes down and says you tell her she can
[1:32:21] have
[1:32:22] he says who would have thought said tell
[1:32:23] her to ask whatever she will now what
[1:32:26] does he say God says then you speak it
[1:32:30] by this gift into
[1:32:33] existence there's the
[1:32:36] need he says whatever she askthe it into
[1:32:39] existence I looked at sister Hattie he
[1:32:42] says this is the first time it was ever
[1:32:43] performed on a human being and I said
[1:32:45] sister Hattie ask what you will God's
[1:32:48] going to give it to
[1:32:49] you what do you think
[1:32:52] he said does it get into you seven times
[1:32:54] he had confirmed it by an animal seven
[1:32:56] is God's complete number and now here's
[1:32:57] the first time on a human being and he
[1:33:00] what did he choose some great Aristocrat
[1:33:02] a great noted Minister he said a poor
[1:33:04] little widow woman that could hardly
[1:33:06] write her name he says God knows what
[1:33:09] he's
[1:33:10] doing what is it Elijah's back to the
[1:33:12] Widow
[1:33:13] again he said ask what you will and had
[1:33:16] he said to me brother Brandon what do
[1:33:17] you mean I said ask anything your heart
[1:33:19] desires and it shall be produced right
[1:33:21] here that you'll know that the Lord God
[1:33:23] Of Heaven answers and his scriptures are
[1:33:26] true not that you'll know that I'm his
[1:33:29] Prophet not that you'll know I have a
[1:33:31] great ministry he's saying that you'll
[1:33:32] know that God's real remember he said
[1:33:34] God does things
[1:33:36] real he says my first time with the new
[1:33:40] gift he says my first anointing he said
[1:33:43] I could hardly hear her she looked
[1:33:45] around we had been talking about her
[1:33:46] little crippled sister and I said oh no
[1:33:48] doubt in my heart within a few minutes
[1:33:50] little Edith will be jumping to the glor
[1:33:51] glory of God a little crippled girl
[1:33:53] there he said surely she's going to ask
[1:33:55] for that Hade looked around all around
[1:33:57] and she said brother Bill my greatest
[1:33:59] desire is for the Salvation of my two
[1:34:01] boys he says why there couldn't have
[1:34:04] been a greater thing she could have
[1:34:05] asked for $10,000 she would have got it
[1:34:08] what if it would have been some
[1:34:08] millionaire would have asked her for
[1:34:10] another million he says but God knew
[1:34:12] what she was going to ask for now
[1:34:14] brother B in the service he has all
[1:34:16] eight Witnesses stand up they're all in
[1:34:18] the service he says is this true or not
[1:34:20] and all eight of them stand up and say
[1:34:21] this is true this is what happened he
[1:34:24] said I ask he said ask anything you want
[1:34:27] to cuz God has given it to me to give it
[1:34:30] to
[1:34:33] you some great man no God had to work
[1:34:37] and give him his need so that he could
[1:34:39] work for somebody
[1:34:40] else's he said God has give it to me to
[1:34:42] give it to you whatever you want she
[1:34:44] said her boys was beginning to go off on
[1:34:46] the teenage tantrums and she said the
[1:34:48] salvation of my two boys I said by the
[1:34:50] will of God by by the power of God I
[1:34:53] give you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:54] your
[1:34:55] desire he said and her two boys shook
[1:34:58] under the power of God that whole
[1:35:00] building trembled Banks fell into his
[1:35:03] plate brother Banks Woods fell into his
[1:35:05] plate he said shall be grabbed and Hade
[1:35:08] screamed till you could hear her for two
[1:35:09] blocks and them two boys with tears
[1:35:11] rolling down their cheeks rece received
[1:35:14] exactly what she asked for right then he
[1:35:17] said the first time it was ever used on
[1:35:19] a human being ask what you will and it
[1:35:22] shall be given unto you her boy sitting
[1:35:26] there with her this morning what would
[1:35:27] she have asked what if she would have
[1:35:29] asked for the healing of her little
[1:35:30] sister what if she would have asked that
[1:35:32] that little girl would have been healed
[1:35:33] but there two boys lost he says what if
[1:35:36] he says but then a few minutes when the
[1:35:38] question is brought up about Jehovah
[1:35:40] Gyra she said that's nothing but the
[1:35:42] truth and it came from a poor widow
[1:35:44] woman's heart God knowing she'd ask the
[1:35:45] greatest thing that could be done here's
[1:35:48] the end of that quote I read it earlier
[1:35:49] he said as long as there is a heaven
[1:35:51] when the stars is gone when there's no
[1:35:53] more moon no more Earth no more sea then
[1:35:56] boys shall live on through eternity with
[1:35:58] the same Jehovah Gyra who gave them the
[1:36:01] immortal promise he says his promises
[1:36:04] cannot
[1:36:06] fail God was working on both ends church
[1:36:09] he gave brother Braham the desire of his
[1:36:11] heart six
[1:36:14] squirrels out in the backs side of the
[1:36:16] desert and he was doing he was preparing
[1:36:19] for him a greater way to meet the needs
[1:36:21] of the people in the expansion of his
[1:36:23] ministry and then God sees sister Hattie
[1:36:26] now he sees her need and he says give
[1:36:29] and she gives $200 in today's dollars
[1:36:31] tries to give 500 they don't take it she
[1:36:34] gives $200 that she really didn't need
[1:36:36] to do but God put it on her heart what
[1:36:39] to put her in the same frame of mind as
[1:36:40] that widow woman in zarap and that widow
[1:36:42] woman in Jesus day puts her in the same
[1:36:44] position and then what does he do he's
[1:36:46] working with his Prophet he's working
[1:36:47] with his daughter and now there's a
[1:36:49] junction that happens remember brother
[1:36:50] bradam said when the word and the spirit
[1:36:52] meet something happens and he sends his
[1:36:54] Spirit their way and brother brandham
[1:36:56] starts to what speak into her life and
[1:36:59] he says you say it it'll happen and he
[1:37:03] does and those two boys are
[1:37:05] saved remember brother BR would have
[1:37:07] this happened five times in his life and
[1:37:09] the last time remember what happened he
[1:37:11] says it's five he says it's F Ai and g a
[1:37:15] c e Grace what happened remember was he
[1:37:18] was talking to his wife and one of his
[1:37:20] sons needed a spank and he said I just
[1:37:22] can't do it and she said yeah but you
[1:37:23] don't have to put up with it and she
[1:37:25] slammed the door in his face remember
[1:37:27] and the Holy Spirit came down and he
[1:37:29] said and the Holy Spirit said to brother
[1:37:30] Braham she should not have done that he
[1:37:32] says now go tell her and he went and he
[1:37:35] told sister ma about it she said he said
[1:37:37] honey I love you he says but the Holy
[1:37:39] Spirit didn't like that and he says he's
[1:37:41] going to judge you and she' had a little
[1:37:43] cyst on her ovary for years 15 years and
[1:37:47] it started to grow it had been dormant
[1:37:48] it had been nothing going on with it and
[1:37:51] it started to grow and it grew and it
[1:37:53] grew and it grew and by the time it got
[1:37:55] to the end she said I can't even bear to
[1:37:57] have clothes rubbing up against it cuz
[1:37:58] it was so big and hanging off her side
[1:38:00] remember brother Bram goes to
[1:38:03] God it's not for him now it's for her
[1:38:06] and he says Lord she's been faithful
[1:38:08] faithful faithful everything that I do
[1:38:11] he says she washes my clothes she puts
[1:38:13] food on the table she doesn't complain
[1:38:14] when I'm gone all these different times
[1:38:17] he said and then I come home and I go
[1:38:18] off on a hunting trip and She lays out
[1:38:20] my hunting clothes for me to leave he
[1:38:22] said she's been faithful and he said
[1:38:24] Lord would you touch her let it not be
[1:38:26] malignant and the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:38:28] and he says you say and it'll happen and
[1:38:32] brother ramam said before the doctor
[1:38:35] touches it it will be gone and he's not
[1:38:38] even there in the hospital when it
[1:38:39] happens and they're prepping her for
[1:38:41] surgery remember and it's hanging off of
[1:38:43] her side down to the the operating table
[1:38:46] and they've got it draped and the doctor
[1:38:49] reaches for it and when he pulls it back
[1:38:51] there's nothing there and so he goes to
[1:38:54] look at the other side CU in surgery
[1:38:55] they always Mark and it's marked where
[1:38:57] it's supposed to be but there's nothing
[1:38:58] there so we missed it went to the other
[1:39:01] side nothing there they didn't operate
[1:39:02] on her God immediately spoke it out of
[1:39:06] existence he can bring it in church he
[1:39:08] can take it out Jehovah Gyra The God Who
[1:39:12] answers working on both sides to prepare
[1:39:14] a prophet to speak a word of faith to
[1:39:17] where he would trust that when he spoke
[1:39:19] it would happen amen
[1:39:22] brother Bram would say this as we're
[1:39:23] closing this morning he he's talking
[1:39:25] about all the events of of speaking
[1:39:27] these squirrels into
[1:39:29] existence and he's thinking on that
[1:39:31] scripture we read in Matthew and this
[1:39:33] was what God said he says and it God
[1:39:35] after I was speaking there for a while
[1:39:36] just inside myself just thinking till I
[1:39:38] became so conscious of something near
[1:39:41] till I was talking to someone he felt
[1:39:43] the presence and then he it started
[1:39:45] speaking and something said to me that's
[1:39:47] in the
[1:39:49] atonement everything that that he's
[1:39:51] talking about in Matthew 11 speak to the
[1:39:53] mountain he says is in the atonement
[1:39:55] under the blood of Jesus Christ this is
[1:39:58] your
[1:40:00] right he says for if a man or a woman is
[1:40:04] so consecrated and surrendered to God
[1:40:07] that God just moves in and uses their
[1:40:09] voice it isn't the man speaking it's God
[1:40:12] that speak God that's in him speaking I
[1:40:16] thought that's right and something said
[1:40:19] to me what do you he says who do you
[1:40:21] think he says how do you see those
[1:40:23] Visions on the platform how do you see
[1:40:24] those Visions out there what is it do
[1:40:26] you think it's your own wisdom that you
[1:40:27] could predict something that would
[1:40:28] happen every time to the letter do you
[1:40:30] think it's you speaking would you think
[1:40:32] sometime when the Holy Spirit gets into
[1:40:34] a message and you don't know what to say
[1:40:36] what is it speaking then he says what is
[1:40:38] it when a man will speak with a tongue
[1:40:40] he doesn't know nothing about what is it
[1:40:42] that will interpret that same tongue
[1:40:44] neither one of them knowing anything
[1:40:46] about it he says is it the individual or
[1:40:48] is it the spirit of the Living God I
[1:40:51] said that's true I see it it's God
[1:40:53] that's speaking he says all the church
[1:40:56] needs is a step closer to him more of a
[1:41:00] consecrated life to live with him church
[1:41:02] I say Lord help me live closer help me
[1:41:05] to live more consecrated help me to
[1:41:07] sanctify my life a new
[1:41:09] amen not for power but to meet a need oh
[1:41:15] to meet a need we talk about third pull
[1:41:17] third PLL is not us going and doing it's
[1:41:20] him telling us and then not speaking
[1:41:22] every single time brother brandham never
[1:41:25] used that third pole anointing unless
[1:41:27] God told him to do it and he only did it
[1:41:29] five times in those last six years of
[1:41:31] his life five times that's
[1:41:34] it we're not going to be running
[1:41:36] around but I tell you when he moves and
[1:41:40] he inspires and he anoints when you
[1:41:43] speak it's the same as him speaking
[1:41:45] because it's his voice working through
[1:41:47] you but I would say this as we start to
[1:41:49] close he's speaking of Abraham now when
[1:41:52] Abraham sitting in the door of his tent
[1:41:54] PLS of mammory and God comes to him he
[1:41:56] says while that old aged Saint was
[1:41:58] sitting there with his head down praying
[1:41:59] no doubt it was then when he lifted up
[1:42:02] his head and he saw three men coming
[1:42:03] towards the tent oh he jumped quickly it
[1:42:06] must have been the spirit that said go
[1:42:07] to them he says you know there's
[1:42:09] something about Spirit-filled people
[1:42:11] that recognizes the presence of God I
[1:42:14] don't know why it is but it must be that
[1:42:16] they have something in them that
[1:42:17] magnetized them to that spirit of God he
[1:42:20] says and he recognized that there was
[1:42:22] something while Abraham went to meet
[1:42:24] them he turned them aside and said come
[1:42:26] in and sit down sit under the oak a
[1:42:28] little while let me fetch a wa little
[1:42:29] water and wash your feet I'll give you a
[1:42:31] morsel of bread and just rest a little
[1:42:33] bit then you may go on your way oh when
[1:42:35] he set him down there though they didn't
[1:42:37] look any different from any other men
[1:42:39] because they were dressed dust on their
[1:42:41] clothes and come from some other country
[1:42:43] probably their feet Dusty their clothes
[1:42:45] ragged but Abraham knew inside there
[1:42:47] there was something real the spirit
[1:42:50] declared it he he says why why did
[1:42:52] Abraham how did he notice it he says he
[1:42:56] kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere
[1:42:59] all the time that he could recognize
[1:43:01] right from wrong all the time he says
[1:43:05] that's the way the Christian ought to do
[1:43:06] today is keep yourself prayed up under a
[1:43:10] spiritual atmosphere what does that look
[1:43:13] like brother John I'm glad you asked
[1:43:16] always never seeing the bad side looking
[1:43:20] to the good side side he says you are
[1:43:22] children of God expecting His blessings
[1:43:26] God if anything I want him to do for me
[1:43:29] this a prophet speaking 1960 anything
[1:43:32] God could do for him he says is open my
[1:43:34] spiritual eyes that I might recognize
[1:43:36] him and look around and see him for he's
[1:43:39] everywhere I want to see him and be so
[1:43:42] acquainted with him that I'll know him
[1:43:44] on the very first sight I'll recognize
[1:43:47] that it's God that's my heart's desire
[1:43:50] is to be be as Abraham was what is it
[1:43:54] the atmosphere of expectation brings a
[1:43:56] revelation of the presence of
[1:43:59] God remember we we read that quote where
[1:44:01] brother Braham says as they were walking
[1:44:02] on the road to am he appeared he says he
[1:44:04] says don't you notice how when you dwell
[1:44:06] on God he shows up you think on the
[1:44:10] things of God and he shows up you dwell
[1:44:12] on the Supernatural Supernatural happens
[1:44:14] why because you're in an atmosphere of
[1:44:16] expectation and then God can move right
[1:44:18] into that if the musicians would come
[1:44:21] amen I pray that we recognize his
[1:44:23] presence but I want to say this this
[1:44:25] morning you can't give anything to God
[1:44:28] that he won't take and give it back to
[1:44:29] you a h hundredfold scripture says
[1:44:32] pressed down shaken together
[1:44:35] overflowing but it's his Blessing not
[1:44:38] the one that you want but it'll be his
[1:44:40] and it'll meet the need every time I
[1:44:42] look at our sisters and we give you
[1:44:45] give sisters give mothers and you get up
[1:44:49] in the morning and you you've had poor
[1:44:51] sleep and maybe you can't do your hair
[1:44:53] the way you want and your clothes aren't
[1:44:54] exactly the way you'd like and patience
[1:44:56] is giving out and all these things God
[1:44:58] sees it because you're not doing it
[1:45:01] because your husband said so or because
[1:45:03] you're bound by a Doctrine but you're
[1:45:05] doing it because you know God has called
[1:45:07] you to that place and US Brothers we go
[1:45:09] and some of us work from morning till
[1:45:11] Dusk and even past some of us are doing
[1:45:14] two
[1:45:16] jobs and we get to the end of the day
[1:45:18] and we're tired and we're worn out
[1:45:22] and then we go and we come to
[1:45:23] church and we worship or we come to
[1:45:25] church and we work as the case may be
[1:45:28] and you think is is he in it all does he
[1:45:30] see it all I say he does he recognizes
[1:45:34] every sacrifice you make but recognize
[1:45:37] that sometimes your sacrifice is going
[1:45:39] to meet the need of somebody else and
[1:45:41] God will let you go through something
[1:45:44] just to help somebody else and sometimes
[1:45:46] he'll put you through something so that
[1:45:48] as your faith Rises somebody else can
[1:45:50] get the the same thing brother Matt was
[1:45:52] sharing with me actually brother Chad
[1:45:53] we'll start with brother Chad brother
[1:45:55] Chad was sitting down at the table the
[1:45:57] other day so you know this isn't about
[1:45:58] the ministry and Mary Beth's been having
[1:46:01] trouble with her eyes she not being able
[1:46:02] to see at school and she said dad I'm
[1:46:05] going to have to go to the doctor and
[1:46:06] I'm going to have to get glasses you
[1:46:09] know what he said
[1:46:11] no no no you don't we don't have to do
[1:46:15] that because his other daughter Haley
[1:46:17] had had this happen before and he prayed
[1:46:19] and her eyes were made perfect ly whole
[1:46:21] so you know what they did around the
[1:46:24] family
[1:46:25] altar at the table they prayed and they
[1:46:28] said Lord Mary Beth's eyes will be
[1:46:31] perfect you know what she did she went
[1:46:34] to the optometrist you know what Mary
[1:46:35] Beth's eyesight
[1:46:37] is 20 over two
[1:46:41] hallelujah thank you Lord like
[1:46:44] that Jehovah Gyra it's not about
[1:46:48] me it's not even about you it's about he
[1:46:52] came to
[1:46:53] me Jehovah Gyra is about you recognizing
[1:46:57] why he's coming to you because he comes
[1:47:00] to his children every single time last
[1:47:04] service I preached on brother brandham
[1:47:06] stomach issue or a couple Services you
[1:47:07] ago you know I'm brother Brandon and he
[1:47:09] had that stomach trouble for
[1:47:12] decades decades and it was only healed
[1:47:15] in the last few months of his
[1:47:18] life brother Matt came up to be prayed
[1:47:21] for he said I've suffered with a sour
[1:47:23] stomach for 15 years and he'd wake up in
[1:47:26] the middle of the night and he'd have a
[1:47:27] bottle of Tums next to his bed because
[1:47:29] he couldn't get back to sleep unless he
[1:47:31] took Tums we prayed the prayer of faith
[1:47:34] and he hasn't touched a Tums
[1:47:37] since Jehovah
[1:47:39] Gyra God who answers you know why so
[1:47:43] that when your need arises you can say
[1:47:45] he did it for brother Chad he did it for
[1:47:47] sister Elsa he did it for brother
[1:47:49] Matthew he can do it for me you look at
[1:47:52] Justine and and Rebecca in their
[1:47:53] eyesight slowly getting better after
[1:47:56] what accepting the prayer of
[1:47:59] faith some is this some is this but he's
[1:48:04] faithful amen let's stand if we
[1:48:08] would sometimes we've got to get a
[1:48:10] testimony to give somebody else faith
[1:48:12] for their testimony amen Elijah didn't
[1:48:16] whine and complain Lord I've been so
[1:48:18] comfortable next to the brook Cher Just
[1:48:20] sitting here on in the shade as I get
[1:48:23] served day in and day out no he's a
[1:48:25] minister a minister is supposed to be
[1:48:27] serving not just be served and God moved
[1:48:30] him out of his comfort put him in a
[1:48:33] place of hunger so that he could go to a
