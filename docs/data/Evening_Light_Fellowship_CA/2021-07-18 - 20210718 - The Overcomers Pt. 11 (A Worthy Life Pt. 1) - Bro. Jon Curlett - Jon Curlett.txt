thank you lord hallelujah [Music] he brought me bless the lord hallelujah i thank god praise the lord he brought me amen thank you jesus we've been listening to the story of moses taking the children of israel out of egypt and their way in the desert and this is in exodus and it says and when they came to mara they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called mara and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree which when he had casted into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and won't do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee when this is called fields notes they were just really good um these bitter waters were in the very path of the lord's leading and stand for the trials of god's people which are educatory sorry and not punitive which means inflicting or intended as punishment the tree is the cross christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree which became sweet to christ as the expression of the father's will for jesus said unto peter put up thy sword unto thy sheep the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it and when our mars are so taken we cast the tree into the waters in romans he has and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us [Music] so from the love of my own comfort from the fear of having nothing from a life of worldly passions [Music] need to be accepted from the fear of being lonely [Music] me and i shall not want no i shall not no i shall not want i shall not want from the fear of serving others from the fear of death or trial from the fear of humility [Music] i i shall i shall not i shall not want [Music] so [Music] when i test he lies awake there all alone most every night looking back on all of his mistakes wishing through the tears that he could just go back cause there's a lot of things he'd like to change he just can't forgive himself and forget even though god already did if he can love someone and find the good within in spite of what they've done no matter where they've been if he can let it go and set the deader free if he can keep forgiving you and me why can't we there been times i've been so hurt by someone else i didn't wanna give a second chance i let all the bitterness take control and took grace into my own hands but even jesus said whoever's done no wrong let him throw the first stone if he can love someone and find the good within [Music] in spite of what they've done no matter where they've been if he can let it go and set the deader free if he can keep forgiving you and me why can't we he was hated and rejected betrayed by those he trusted even hanging on the cross he said father please forgive them if he can love someone and find the good within in spite of what they've done no matter where they've been if he can let it set the deader free if he can keep forgiving you and me if he can love someone and find the good within in spite of what they've done no matter where they've been if he can let it go and set the deader free if he can keep forgiving you and me why can't we [Music] why can't we why can't we uh amen beautifully done i shall not want a message of faith i guess and you could say that uh forgiveness uh we get nowhere we're not forgiveness we're not forgiving each other as we all make mistakes and we all we all hurt each other not intentionally but it happens and that's where that's where we humble ourselves and that's where forgiveness kicks in and that's where god comes right on the scene amen it's uh speaks volumes that i'm not a preacher you'd never get out of the song service uh that's saying that chorus uh to be like jesus amen to be like jesus amen to be like jesus amen on earth thy lord amen to be like all through life's churches from earth i only ask hallelujah to be like to be like jesus to be like jesus on [Music] let's stand together if we would [Music] to be like him [Music] to be like jesus to be like jesus [Music] [Applause] to be like him [Music] all through this journey from earth i only ask to be like him heavenly father lord that's our prayer once again this morning lord it's not just this morning that we want to be like you lord about every day lord our hearts desires to be more and more like christ lord the anointed word for our hour and lord we've come into your presence this morning we've come into this building dedicated to your worship and praise lord to be made a little more like you this morning lord that the world would be pushed away lord that the the holy ghost would just have preeminence in our lives a little bit more lord that we would be drawn closer to you a little more perfect reflection lord take some more of that dross lord that imperfection out lord so that that reflection is just a little bit clearer this morning heavenly father lord we dedicate this service lord just praying that you'll take your servant lord and use him lord that you would anoint lips to speak lord ears to hear lord that you would just lord once again fulfill your word lord that where two or three were gathered in your name you'd be in their midst lord and that word would go forth as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart lord just minister to your bride now we pray lord not just here but in each service lord this morning that goes across the continent lord we pray that you would speak to your bride through anointed ministry heavenly father lord that we would each one be drawn closer to you lord united together under your headship lord that we work together for your kingdom purpose we pray lord touch your people now we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians that will be it amen god bless you and turn in your scriptures this morning to joshua chapter 11 if you would joshua chapter 11 amen good to be back my throat's doing a bit better but as you can hear i'm not quite a hundred percent so just trusting god's grace that we'll we'll get through once again amen amen joshua chapter 11. verse 15 just one verse this morning as we start it says as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses amen the lord read his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen we want to continue with our series on the overcomers i want to start a little mini mini series underneath this of uh of something called a worthy life amen a worthy life is what we want to talk about and as you can see we're coming to a bit of a close on joshua uh you know he's we've covered the major battles we've covered the major issues we've learned the lessons from him and as we start to do that there's not a whole lot left in the book of joshua but as we finish with him we're going to transition more into ephesians because there's a lot more depth in ephesians joshua's a type but in ephesians we get to see paul dealing directly with the believer right there's there's no there's no types there's no shadows anymore now it's it's direct instruction a minute something that we can take and apply directly we don't have to filter it we don't have to say well that was for another day that was a message for another people but that's a message just for us amen we don't go through types and shadows now but the holy spirit is speaking expressly to the bride through the message of paul the apostle amen amen but as we start on this path today on a worthy life we want to look at it from the starting point all the way to the finish line for joshua amen it's a wonderful thing to be born and raised in a christian home it's a wonderful thing to have an atmosphere set for you to have a new birth it's a wonderful thing to have the proper instruction from the very beginning you know we had some friend some believers over the other day and we were commenting how just being raised in a christian home being raised around the message is a tremendous thing and there's a tremendous blessing in it because you don't tend to get caught up in the things that trip you up later on in life when people make mistakes they tend to make them early on in life because they lack the instruction because they don't know what is right and what is wrong and so they get sucked into things that will change their lives forever and whether it's the sensuality of the world whether it's drugs and alcohol whether it's a focus on a career amen these things that you could if you get stuck at the beginning it's very hard to break the cycle later on and so when you're raised around believers when you're raised going to church there's a blessing that's with it there's a hedge of protection that comes with just simple obedience to the word while you're young and then it keeps you from going down certain paths and in the end you're you're certainly better off than a typical worldly person amen you're you're a good citizen if nothing else when you're raised around church amen but that is not the starting point amen when we're talking about a worthy life it is not the starting point to hang around holy ghost-filled believers to have holy ghost-filled parents that's a benefit but your life doesn't start until you get the life of the holy ghost amen until you get the life of god until he calls you that's when the starting point is for you and until he calls you you can't do anything for his his kingdom right why because you can't do it the way he wants you can have the right motive and the right objective sometimes you can do good things but if it's not done the way he wants in the in the intent that he wants then it's actually not considered good amen you've got to have the full package when it comes to god amen and you'll know when you're called because you'll it'll consume your mind amen these young men that came to the lord and then talking with my own son it was dwelling on him and he couldn't get away from it and when i was in that same boat that's exactly the way it was is you can't get away from the call of god amen it's something that drops in and it consumes your your thought it consumes your times you know listening to brother brother mark's testimony and his testimony that and just the how it just it completely overwhelmed their life amen when god comes on the scene it just completely overwhelms you and you can't get away from what he's calling you to do amen whether it's a surrender in your life whether it's a call to a ministry whether it's a call to a particular place to live a church a spouse it can be so many things but when god's moving it consumes you until you surrender to it amen if you're a true son or daughter of god brother brahm said if he's calling you and you reject it and you reject it reject it then pretty soon that goes away and you know you're not a son or a daughter of god because the will to do it goes away amen the desire to do it goes away and it's god was giving you a chance and then you crossed over that line between judgment and grace amen but as we look at joshua we want to see where his calling was laid out the beautiful thing with joshua is that before he ever gets his call he has a track record of being the right kind of man for the job amen joshua has gone through many many testings many trials amen the first thing that happened after they crossed over was moses went up to get the word of the lord and what did the rest of israel do they made a calf they made a golden calf and joshua's not identified with that worship he stayed firmly on the side of the word when they spoke against moses joshua stayed with moses he stayed with the messenger for the hour amen when they go over jordan and they look over the land he is one of only two that says we are more than able to take the country amen we're more than able to take it because god said and so all the way through this we see that joshua has stayed with the message he stayed with the word of his hour he stayed with the prophet of his hour and he hasn't moved from that one iota amen he's always stayed where god wanted him to stay amen and it's funny because when god calls joshua there's really only two people he can call it's joshua caleb everyone else is dead when you're looking for an experienced believer it's joshua or caleb really unless he's going to raise up a really young person to do it so it's joshua caleb and then god starts to do that and he starts to to say josh was going to be the next man but we see how god has prepared that man all the way through life he has proven him right he has showed the people that this is a man that can be trusted that this is a man that has stayed with god all the way throughout his life and now i'm going to step him into a bigger position i'm going to put a greater responsibility on his shoulders but you can trust him because you look at his track record and he's done the right thing all along the path amen it's interesting to me how god always prepares the man for the position he doesn't just drop somebody in usually but he's prepared his path all the way to bring him to where he is when god puts him into that elevated position amen joshua's been through the ringer he's been through the desert he's been over the mountain he's done all of it and he stayed true to god through it and so god now says this is my this is the next man for the job if we look in numbers 27 this is joshua's calling it said and the lord said unto moses get thee up into this mount to baram and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel and when thou hast seen it thou shalt also be gathered to thy people as aaron thy brother was gathered in other words once you go up on the mountain and look over canaan i'm going to take you home with me and for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of zinn in the strife of this congregation to sanctify me at the water before their eyes that is the water of maraba and kadish in the wilderness of sin remember moses he struck the rock twice right he wasn't supposed to do that and he disobeyed god and he glorified himself rather than god and so god said because of that you don't get to go into the land amen moses broke the type there we know so he's not allowed to go in so moses comes back to god and he says and moses spake unto the lord saying let the lord the god of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation of the lord be not a sheep which have no shepherd he says god you need to replace me then these these people need a shepherd they need a leader they need somebody to take them through to do everything that you've called them to do verse 18 says and the lord said unto moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him and set him before elizar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight and thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of the children of israel may be obedient now notice here it says moses is to put some of his honor that doesn't just mean honor it says authority he's supposed to give him partial authority over the children of israel but you see that he can't god doesn't tell him to give all of it to him he just says give some of it to him because there's a transition that's happening and one thing you'll always see in the scripture is that god can anoint two men for the same position amen so god doesn't say i'm gonna put everything on him now he says there's a transition coming so because the people know and trust you stand them up in front of the church and lay your hands on them and say this is god's choice and give him some author give him some honor and put your authority on him but he's not ready just yet this is not his time yet but he's being prepared to step into your shoes he says stand in front of the congregation and do that so that they know that you've endorsed this and because you've endorsed it they know that i've endorsed it because you'll never do something like this unless i tell you to do it in the first place amen they trust that moses is god speaking remember when god called moses he says you will be god to them and aaron will be their prophet so when moses is standing there that's god that's god laying his hands and saying this is going to be the next one to lead the children of israel amen god wasn't going to leave them without proper leadership in other words verse 21 says and he shall stand before eliza are the priests who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of yurim before the lord at his word shall they go out and at his word shall they come in both he and all the children of israel with him even all the congregation now this going out and coming in is a reference to proper leadership in israel because what would happen is he would go in to the tabernacle to seek the will of god and then he would come out to lead the people into battle amen so he had to go in and say lord what is your will and then he had to come out and tell the people this is god's will and if he came out and they were defeated then that meant that he had missed the will of the lord and if he kept doing that pretty soon he wasn't allowed to go in because he wasn't going to be allowed to come out and lead them amen the proof was in the pudding that if he found the will of the god they would have victory they would have discernment they would have the things that they needed they would find the will in the path of god and they would be victorious every day of their life so he had to go in and find the will and then come out and bring the people to god's perfect will and if he failed then the people wouldn't allow him to do it anymore and then we see that with david it says when david was made a captain remember he was made general and then he was reduced to a captain and he went out he went in and came out before the people and he found favor with the people because every time that david went out after coming into the presence of god he always found victory amen and so this is what joshua's saying but you notice here he says he'll stand before eliza are the priests joshua's got a conduit right now there's a priest standing between him the priest is supposed to inquire on the urim thumb and as to what is the will of god do we do this or do we do that so we see he even hear a transition for joshua that he does not have the direct contact with god yet amen there's still a barrier there's a priesthood between him why because god is still with moses right he's got to go through somebody else but now when that transition is full you'll see god now step from moses to dealing directly with joshua and then you see that transition happen 22 it says and moses did as the lord commanded him and he took joshua and set him before eliza the priest and before all the congregation and he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the lord commanded by the hand of israel amen so this is joshua's calling now he knows that he is going to be the next leader of israel but he knows it but he hasn't experienced it i want to draw a distinction there because you can know what you're supposed to do but until god puts you in the place to do it you're not supposed to try and do it can you imagine the confusion that would have happened if joshua went out and tried to lead the people before moses had been called away right now you'd have two people vying for the same position vying for the same influence in the group you can't have that happen right one man's in charge one man's waiting in the wings to step in but until one is out the other one never steps in amen you'll see that whether it's in a regular church today a pastor with an assistant pastor you can't have those two men vying for the same position amen you've got one man's anointed for it and one man may be getting ready for it but he's not anointed in that position yet and god won't anoint him for that position until that other one is stepped aside amen and you'll see that through all the different gifts in the body amen we've got song leaders we've got these different positions there is a major anointing on the one and then there is a minor anointing there's a preparing anointing if i could put it that way to get that next one ready and you'll never have conflict when god's working because the anointing will only lead that one amen the second one is waiting to be anointed and appointed to that position amen you'll see it even with jesus amen jesus said at the age of 12 he says i must be about my father's business at the age of 12 and it's not until the age of 30 that the holy spirit drops down upon him and he is now appointed and anointed for his work amen you can know it but that doesn't mean that you are yet ready for it and it doesn't mean you should start to try and do it on your own that's for sure amen now so we know after this moses goes up on the mountain he looks across god takes them away and now joshua becomes the man to lead the israelites now we've covered joshua's his commission but i want to read it again just so we can see what god told him to do just for the sake of com completion here this morning but this is where joshua's stepping in now he's not just appointed but now he's anointed god's saying now is your time now is your place it's time for us to step over and it's time for you to start moving into what i've called you to be amen so turn to joshua chapter one if you would i'll put it up here but just to have it in your scriptures because we're gonna be here for a little bit amen joshua chapter one now this is joshua's vocation if we could call it that way this is his life's calling this is joshua's purpose now coming to the forefront this is this is the day amen this is the day that joshua's gonna step in to everything that god has prepared him for up to this point joshua 1 1 says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the lamb which i do give to them even to the children of israel this is phase one cross over jordan every place that the soul of your foot shall tread that have i given unto you as i said to moses notice he gives the command and then he gives the benefit he says go over and as soon as you're over everywhere that your foot treads belongs to you amen verse 4 from the wilderness and this level lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast so he says these are your borders and this is what you're supposed to go do amen this is phase two conquer every city and kingdom within the borders that god has laid out there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail me nor forsake thee again this is your border go in and take it and here's the promise no one's going to be able to stand before you within those borders be strong and of a good courage for under this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them again what is he supposed to do once you've conquered it divided up amongst the people as you're supposed to again only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand nor to the left that thou mayest prom prosper wither so ever thou goes this is how you conquer he says stay with the word stay with the law that i've given moses don't go to the left don't go to the right don't deviate stay 100 with what i told you through moses and you'll be okay the book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth amen you have to speak it thou shalt meditate there in day and night you have to dwell on it you have to think about it that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written there so you speak it and you think on it in order to do it amen for then after you've done that thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success amen the word can't be usurped and if the word is never usurped if it's never if the preeminence is never given to anything but the word then you can only be victorious is what he's saying here amen so what we see here is god has laid out a complete path to success for joshua he's told him where to go he's told him what belongs to him he's told him that nobody can stand before you he's told him how to make sure he's walking in the will of god amen god's given him a full pathway to success and god doesn't take a believer and just drop them in the middle of a pack of lines and say defeat the lions he gives us a pathway he gives us a word he gives us a message he gives us a way of doing things and then he says stay with that and you're going to be successful but i've told you how to do it so you're not allowed to deviate now amen god doesn't wink at ignorance in this age we're looking at a seventh church age here everything is open that we need to do to go on a rapture amen we have every word that we need we have every truth we have every anointing we have every promise that is required right here and all he's saying is don't deviate from it i've told you how to do it i'm training you i'm preparing you but stick with the word and you'll make it all the way through to the end and you'll be able to fulfill what i've called you to do in your life amen amen what is it god calls us out and then he trains us and he prepares us and he molds us and he shapes us to get us in the condition where we can do what he has called us to do and that is what is going to be a worthy life amen is to do what god has called you to do in your day amen and i can only speak for myself is that he never stops training he never stops molding he never stops beating the dross out as the scripture talks about he never stops refining our character refining the way we look at things we're finding the filter that we have to draw us closer and closer to him and i see our pastor nodding back there and if he's nodding that means he's still doing it with him too amen that is a constant work a man of sanctification that god is doing in our lives to draw us away from the world and a constant working inside of us to make the world more and more of a preeminence until we come to that stature of a perfect man or woman in christ amen amen then when he's got us to the place where we can start because remember he prepared joshua joshua went through many trials many tribulations many situations and that was just training to get him to this point and when god determines you're ready to start your tr your job then that's when we kick off amen that's not the start he's been training you all along the holy spirit's been a tutor the holy spirit's been working in your life sons of god and daughters of god are led by god to bring them to that place but there comes a point brother brahm says that's adoption where he says all right now it's time for you to do something for me i've done all of this for a purpose now it's time for you to step out and do what i've really called you to do in this time and in this age brother braham says this for instance there was a man in the bible by the name of moses who had got all of his training he knowed all the theology amen can we say that we have that probably today do we have all of the theology we've had an open book before since 1963 when the seven seals were opened brother brown said this became a new book it became an open book we have all of the theology we could ever ask for amen and we've had it up to it it's coming out of our years we have so much theology we have doctrine we have truth in the in terms of the letter amen and with this message we have everything we need in terms of theology he says he knew everything that he should know now i believe there's greater revelation coming but in terms of knowledge i believe it's pretty much there for us we're looking for revelation now to make it a reality even if he would have needed any education he could teach the masters in israel or in egypt he didn't need one thing and the bible tells us he was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians why he could teach their scholars he could teach their scientists things he was key to the very point when it came to intellectual but yet it taken god 40 years to beat all of that out of him out there in the saiyans and when he got all of his intellectual conceptions of god beat out of him out there in the sands the metal was ready to be molded over now i'm not for a minute saying that god's going to beat out all the theology of the message amen but what he's going to do is he's going to take it out of our conception and he's going to bring it now in his reality amen because so often what's holding us back is that we're expecting god to do things in a certain way and god's ways are not our ways amen we might have the holy ghost but god's thinking is way different than our thinking amen i mean look at me where i'm standing today how many would have said that's the way to go how many would have said john you should leave for 16 years go all around north america in multiple churches with multiple pastors multiple situations some good some not so good and then come back to newfoundland why not just stay here why not make it simple that would have been really simple wouldn't it but that's not god's way of training a man and we'll see later on what brother bram has to say about it actually we'll see in this next scripture he says that's the way god takes his men and beats out all their fears all of their intellectuals and then the great master potter puts them on the wheel and begins to mold them over again workmen worthy it's god's man then who could train a man more than god himself he says watch the way he trains them god has to get a man away from the things of the world so he can get him quiet so he can listen to god that still small voice then once in contact with god he becomes fearless then notice that he don't care what anyone says he's been in the presence of god he knows god in the power of his resurrection amen that's one thing i can testify myself is i don't care what people say now that i've been in the presence of god amen why because he has laid his calling he has laid his anointing on me to do what i'm doing and i don't care if somebody thinks i have a gift or doesn't think i have a gift if i'm where i'm supposed to be or where i'm not supposed to be i don't care what people think about my past i don't care what people think about my future because i am consumed by what he has anointed me to do and what he has called me to do and that is my focus amen moses didn't walk down and people walk looking at them with a walking stick saying moses how are you going to do it with this stick are you kidding me have you seen the swords they come out with this year have you seen the 2021 sores that the egyptians have and you're going up with a stick moses wasn't looking at that he was what commissioned to go and deliver them and he had god's judgment in his hand that's all that mattered to him amen now you might say well that's moses amen we've talked about this before that's joshua you know we're talking about the greats of the bible we're talking about i mean moses the only one greater than him was john the baptist the scripture says except for christ himself moses was the greatest prophet in fact he's the one that christ is compared to he'll raise up a prophet like unto right that's how great a prophet moses was we say well that's a great man that's a great woman you know we look at these heroes of the faith and say well yes god had to do something special with them listen we're about to go in a rapture folks god's going to have to do something special with you and you're pretty special if he's called you to do what's only happened a couple times in history amen so the same thing that he these people went through is the same thing god's got to put us through amen he's got to prepare us to do his work amen brother braham says this god trains his men trains his men then anoints them gives them experience takes them through the rigid training down through the sands of burning punishment trying and testing amen how many of us have signed up for that willingly but that's the way god prepares his people amen is he does what he he trains them then he anoints them puts them through experience through this burning sands of punishment amen amen what is he doing he's getting you to the point where you'll obey him every single time when he says it amen he's getting you ready to to not look to the left or the right you've got blinders on and all you can see is the word ahead of you and what god has called you to do amen he says not only does he do that to his prophets but he does it to his children okay we're all children we've only got two potential prophets here and that's myself and brother gerald as ministers brother braham said that's your modern day prophet amen but the rest of us are we're all children amen so this everything he says here applies to us every single person in this room amen every son that cometh to god must be chastened and tried tested by his word see when the pinch comes the strong time when it faces death are you able to stand there on the word of god and say god said so that settles it amen you've got to come to the place where you're resting on the word and the word alone and brother branham points us to hebrew 12 and we'll read it really quickly because it sets us up for this topic beautifully about what it means to have a worthy life but you've got to go through the training before you can step into that portion of your life that's worthwhile hebrews 12 5 says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord no faith nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every sum whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealer with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not amen every father in here has spanked or disciplined their child at some point but we don't go around spanking disciplining other kids do we but if he be without chastisement we're of all our partakers in other words everyone gets chastisement from god if they're a son or daughter of god then are ye bastards and not sons so it's that simple if your life is untouched by the hand of god if it's all a life of ease and pleasure and luxury guess what god ain't dealing with you as a son or daughter of god it's that simple so when we look and we're calling for god to put those things into our life what we're asking him to do is duck out from chastising us from correcting us from training us amen he's going to use what he needs to get us to the place that he wants us to be he said furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they barely for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure in other words we had leadership he says and they gave us a hard time they chastened us they did things to us that didn't feel very good he says they did it for their pleasure but he which is god our father he does it for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness so he does it with purpose amen he's got a reason for what he's doing it says now no chastening for the presence seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby like i said god's chastising is purposeful his training is purposeful and though it's difficult it comes out and it always has an effect amen and if it doesn't have an effect he'll put you through it again and again and again until the effect is there because if we resist so much often what happens is we he backs off he says okay you don't want to do this we won't do it we'll let you go back to the way you were doing things for a little while until you start asking me until you start crying out until you get desperate and say god this is more than i want i'd rather do it your way than sit here and do things my way amen amen amen like i said before god doesn't just throw us to the wolves he works on us and he works on us and he works on us until we get to that place where we can be of use where he can trust us amen and the thing is we're not here to reflect a christ of 2000 years ago i mean that's sort of that's where denominations get in trouble these days is they're looking to a christ of 2000 years ago and saying let's be like that and the word has moved on from 2000 years ago amen what we do is we have people that sit there and say i want to be the christ that was revealed in but guess what the word has moved on since 1963. the word says if our pastor said it the other day if we walk in the light walking means you're moving if we walk in the light as he is in the light amen then we have fellowship with him and the blood of jesus cleanses us from all our sins that word is continually moving the word was opened in 1963 but it's taking decades and decades and decades for men to dig into that and pull out everything that's in there and the prophet said i only hit the highlights right so what's happening is that five full ministries digging into it and they're pulling the people up in faith i was listening to brother jason demars the other day and we'll get into this when we start when we minister on the five full ministry lord willing but he says he he it talks about that perfecting of the saints he says it is not perfectionism maturity he said it is preparation as in the five-fold ministry is preparing the people for what the rapture we don't mature you we give you what you need to mature we give you what it takes to please god and then god comes down he blesses it because it's his word for the hour and it's what prepares you amen but there is a maturing process but that word is not the mature that we're used to that perfection we're used to but rather it's a preparation of the people we'll give you the tools we'll give you exactly what's needed for your day to get you ready to meet the challenge of the hour amen amen so we want to reflect the christ for our day amen amen now we've spent 10 services talking about joshua's deeds but now we want to go to the end of it all amen to see what it looks like and we read this at the beginning of the service joshua 11 verse 15 says as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone that all of the lord commanded moses i mean if there's one thing that i would like to say at the end of this life it's to have a scripture written about me this way amen that god would say he did he left nothing undone that was commanded to him amen that you would walk to the end and he would say well done thou good and faithful servant enter into the joys of thy lord amen that we would be able to say lord i've left nothing undone that you've called me to do everything that you've asked i've done it and i've not just done it but i've done it the way you told me with whom you told me to do it when you told me to do it amen amen that would be grace amen that would be grace to us if we could do it but joshua is commended here he's noted for leaving nothing undone he has con he has finished the work that god gave him to do amen amen amen does joshua perfect no but it doesn't note it here does it it doesn't notice imperfections amen when you go to the faith chapter in hebrews it doesn't note their failures it notes that they did in the end what god called them to do amen and that's where i want my place to be is that he looks past the failure and says in the end he still got there amen by my grace by my strength by the power of my spirit he still got there and he finished the work that i put him on earth to do amen amen joshua paid a price and the children of israel paid a price every time he failed but yet in the end he finished the work that god had called him to do verse 16 says so joshua took all that land the hills all the south country the land of goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same even from the mount halak that goeth up to seer even under belgaud in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and slew them amen let me put it this way joshua beat everyone everywhere every time amen there was nobody that could stand before them it didn't matter what type of terrain they had it didn't matter what kind of weapons they had if they had horses and chariots if they had the world's longest spears or strongest bows it didn't matter what he faced everywhere that he went he was able to defeat the enemy amen amen amen that's a type for us is that every time we go in no matter what we're facing if we've never faced it before if we've never had a victory there before yet god is there to give us that victory amen we saw a prophet coming this day and it didn't matter what stood before him everything had to bow at the name of jesus christ amen how many times how many times did something come up and he would rebuke that in the name of jesus christ and in that instant they were healed amen we saw every we saw limbs lengthened and then in india there was a there was a young one there that had his leg lengthened in front of everybody we saw eyeballs created in eye sockets amen we saw cancers go away instantly we saw goiters drop off amen we saw the lame heal we saw the death here we saw the dumb speak amen we saw cancer heal we saw arthritis healed we saw everything that you could ever imagine every enemy that you could imagine female trouble nervousness all of these things complexes how many times do they come up and they're coming up for a physical need and brother branham goes to what an emotional need right and says this is another issue you got to deal with here but by his stripes you are healed amen in the name of jesus christ you are healed what is it no matter what came up no matter the terrain no matter the country no matter the level of unbelief yet when that angel was there nothing could stand before him amen amen if it is with him then who how is it with us we'll see what happens here amen i'm going to read this quote and this is a very well-known quote nobody reads the second half and we're going to read that in a later series because it's absolutely incredible but i want to share that a little bit later but just listen to this speaking of beating the enemy everywhere every time amen brother braham says this and expectations and the word of god will defeat satan any place any time anywhere and on any condition that's what joshua faced everything everywhere and he defeated every single one of them why because the word of god was in his mouth it was in his mind and he was walking according to what god had said he says that's right that's what it is it's god's word heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never fail he says believe it look at joshua if there's somebody that stretched his commission to the limit it was joshua as we read last time this is the only man ever to call on the sun and the moon to stand still and it stood still for almost a day you talk about stretching your commission he's he took it to the max there's nobody's ever called on something like that to happen amen and no matter what happened he pulled on it he pulled and he pulled and he said lord this is what you've called me to do and then he do it and he'd do it and he'd do it and he do it and he did it for 10 long years and then he never slacked off he never took his foot off the gas it was just go go go go and he's under man he's under trained in terms of car you know speaking currently he doesn't have the type of weapons he doesn't have the kind of technology that the people they're facing right he's never taken a fortress before he comes over here and yet he goes through here and he just wipes everybody out why because he believed this the word of god will defeat them where any place anytime anywhere and on any condition amen amen with joshua he had no fallbacks when they crossed the river jordan they didn't have food stores the mana stopped falling quickly they had to defeat in order to eat all right in order to keep going they had to defeat they had to have victory in the camp amen god's pulled back on that blessing why because he's training the people for a time where he's not going to hand feed them all the time and then he's training them to to do what step into the word step forward in faith and take what he's promised and not just rely on him to do everything supernaturally now but to take what he's given them and let that feed them amen amen but listen to what he says now verse 18. joshua made war a long time with all those kings amen how many of us have signed up for a long war amen it's not a sprint we sometimes we think well once i finish this one once this battle's over then i'll get a break guess what there's another fortress there's another army there's another weapon waiting for you over the hill amen it's going to be one after the other after the other until we get out of here why because we've been called to be an overcomer amen you can't overcome without battles amen you've got to have a victory to be an overcomer and so these are just going to cycle through over and over again yeah you'll get a break you'll get a chance to heal up there's no doubt about it but god's going to keep pushing us and pushing us and pushing us through until we've got the victory over everything and then the last thing that's defeated is what death and hell amen the keys of the the keys are in his hands he's got the keys to death hell in the grave and so he just unlocks that up and we just walk out of here amen total victory for each and every one of us why isn't it all a supernatural instantaneous victory why can't we just have the supernatural doing everything every time why do we have to struggle why do we have to fight why do we have to wait why do we have to sit there and just look to god and say god why aren't things happening why isn't it that everything doesn't just happen like this why don't we just speak the word every time when a situation comes up why don't we speak the word and it happened then i'm not saying don't speak the word but i'm saying why is the effect of it not immediate every time it's because we're in a process amen and we've got two things happening and there they seem contradictory times is one is god is the same yesterday today and forever so he's here in our midst but he's got to prepare us and that means we've got to have character and character requires what battle and victory because brother brown said character is a victory you can't have that character without a battle so you've got god jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but you got him preparing to bride at the same time and so he doesn't do everything when you want it but yet he uses it for its purpose scripture talks about what you put a bit in a horse's mouth and you make it do things and god does the same thing with our trials and temptations as he uses it to affect in our lives and it's for a supernatural effect it's for a kingdom effect and he's bringing us to a place where we're going to step off this earth without seeing death amen what's he doing is he's using those things to mold us and shape us amen how are you going to have faith if you never have to use it right if you never have to wait how are you going to have patience we look through all of this how are you going to have faith if everything comes immediately how are you going to have strength if you don't work strength comes by what you have to work it you have to exercise it discernment has to be exercised the scripture says so you're going to get strength by working against something that's maybe heavier than you can handle right now knowledge you have to learn hey man you have to groan at temperance it's got to be shaped when you temper something what happens is you take it and you if you're you're temporary metal then you've got to hold it at a certain temperature and then you've got to cool it at a certain rate to give it strength and then it's a process that has to happen patience how do you exhibit patients unless you're in a situation that would typically cause impatience i mean it's got to be exercise godliness a constant work of sanctification sanctification is not a one-day event amen this is happening every day brotherly kindness he puts you in a church where nobody's perfect right and all of a sudden your brotherly kindness has to be built up and then we're capped with what his love amen his life within us amen it's an entire process that's molding us and shaping us what to make us into what he wants us to be amen so often we're looking to the outside well i conquered this i conquered that i conquered this disease i conquered this demon i can't conquer this tormentor i conquer in this situation that but the victory that he's looking for is an internal one before there's ever an external one amen that means that there's got to be a bit of a delay between what we say and what happens amen now sometimes god does it supernaturally and that's his grace amen i remember blanking when she had gallbladder trouble and we were in dallas texas and brother joe adams was there amen and he called her up to pray for her he laid hands on her and he cast that thing out and she was literally instantaneously healed there are those moments we have those moments of instantaneous healing and that's just god being god amen but he otherwise used puts us through a process even the scripture says if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen doesn't say they'll be instantaneously healed it says they'll recover and then there's a process of time and that's the testing of our faith they mean it's the proving of your faith listen because we want it easy if we're honest we want it easy does anybody here want a difficult life in and of your your flesh certainly doesn't amen your mind doesn't want it amen but what is it is it is is that we've got to be able to look at those things through those filters and say this is god that's in it and then we've got to be able to rest in that because otherwise we're going to go back and we're going to say god's with us every time life is easy and guess what he can be there when it's easy but it's not his way of doing things but listen to what brother branham says here about that easy way of things when god's just always supernatural he's speaking of the children of israel when they're going through the desert he says now we find that they'd already seen these miracles look what was with them they had a smitten rock with them they could drink from it they had an everlasting fount of water in front of them after they complained granted but they had a fount of water just coming out without end okay they had all the water they needed he says they had a brass serpent with them for healing oh my they had a prophet with them that had the word of god wouldn't we love to have brother branham here today i would love to have brother branham here today i would much prefer to sit there and listen to the prophet and read his quotes amen i'd love to have him there over the prophet was a pillar of fire that was doing the leading and not one time had it ever failed them glory he says oh i feel like shouting wouldn't we love to have that here wouldn't you love to have the pillar of fire here leading us it'd be amazing wouldn't it it'd be absolutely tremendous for us to be able to look up and see the very uh representation of the presence of god in our midst day and night a cloud by day and a pillar fire by night and a prophet that every time he speaks whatever he says comes to pass we'd love it but that's the easy life amen that's the easy life he says look it hadn't failed god doesn't fail he cannot fail and remain god he's still god the smitten rock the brass serpent a prophet an atonement and sacrifice everything grace had provided for them already and after god had done all these things they were like a lot of people today they have to be babied around god doesn't want babies god wants men and women because when everything's provided you don't grow amen if all we do with samuel is give him everything he wants and never get him to learn and obey and grow and take responsibility for his actions he will always stay as a spoiled child amen when everything is given to you you do not grow amen when he holds back what happens when you hold back from the body it leans up doesn't it starts to eat some of the fat that's grown on us amen when you start to work it it starts to strengthen itself and it's healthier if it's worked than if it's not and he says god's doing the same thing he doesn't want babies he wants men and women now this is we read this this isn't the same quote but he comments on the same guy he says i like old buddy robinson's testimony he said lord give me the backbone the size of a salon put plenty of knowledge in the gable end of my soul and let me fight the devil as long as i got one tooth left and then gum on him until i die right he's saying let me keep going at it he says that's what we need courage not a wishbone but a backbone a real spirit-filled heart filled with the holy ghost sanctified by the blood of jesus christ living in a life walking in the path of god keeping his commandments claiming every promise as your own property he says hallelujah i mean that's what we want to be able to say is lord let me surrender to the process let me accept the process because i like the results a lot more than if we do things my way amen brother branham says oh how that we need on this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and to feast on the word of god so that it'll give us strength night after night go to the room and rest and come back the next morning fresh and eat more for there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church that's us i believe we've been children long enough amen can we say amen to that this morning have we been children long enough amen we've had the theology we've had the training we've had the truth we've had maybe the understanding but that's not enough to go into rapturing man we don't want to stay as children anymore he says god's going to turn his children in his church into manhood now and we played and frolicked his children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity i believe it was paul who said when i was a child i spake as a child because he thought as a child but it's time that we begin to think like men and women now for we've got to get down to business amen and we want to get down to business because we see situations in our lives and our families in our bodies in our church whatever it might be and we say this has been around long enough amen this has been in our situation we've been in this situation for long enough it's time for us to start moving into the promises of god it's time to start reading the title deed and saying this needs to be taken away and we need to take this back amen we need to kick things out and we need to add to us the things that he's promised to us amen amen so there's going to be battles there's going to be long drawn out fights there's going to be difficulties there's going to be trials and temptations amen sometimes it takes more strength to sit back and wait on god than it does to go into the battle i mean sometimes it takes more strength to just say lord it's in your hands right so many times we actually feel better because we're doing something but it's not always for us to do it's for us to believe and let him do it and then when he says move if he says move then we do it but we wait on the lord we wait on the lord and we talked about them going around jericho and for six days there was nothing happening and yet they were there in obedience amen that's the difficult thing the waiting that's the trial of your faith is the waiting but then when god moves then it happens so quick usually it's usually a very quick tumble from nothing to everything's done it's taken care of and you're moving on to the next one amen celebrating the victory amen listen when you get cancer can you heal yourself no you've got to pray and wait for god to move amen when you've got a temper can you take it away no amen i can say that one amen what do you have to do pray and wait for god to move on the scene amen if you lack godly character can you add it to yourself no so what do you do pray and wait for god to move on the scene and what's he going to do this is what we're looking for what's he going to do he's going to put you in a situation that requires it he's going to put you in a situation that requires it he's going to put you in a situation that requires it and he's going to keep doing that over and over and over again until you've got enough of what he requires of you to do the job that's at hand amen amen it takes great strength to hold yourself to the word of god when every shred of evidence every sign every idea every thought says it's wrong and then when you look at yourself in the mirror when you look at the situation when you look at whatever it might be and say nothing's changing nothing's changing nothing's changing in fact it's looking worse than it did right hold to the word hold to the word and say lord you said it i didn't say it and all i'm doing is i'm holding you to what you said amen amen amen what does it mean to be a believer does it mean to accept the truth it does but it means you act on it as well because brother braham said remember what he said he says if you believed it you'd act on it amen so we don't believe intellectually we believe by our actions amen we show what we believe by how we live our life we show what we believe by how we do things or how we don't do things as the case may be amen we are not believers in intellectualism only that's brother branham just spent you know he spends how many quotes how much time in his ministry saying get it out of your head and get it into your life amen act on it don't just think about it don't just acknowledge it intellectually don't just say yes that's the starting point but he says now you put it into action because he says the holy spirit will say yes say yay amen to every word of god but it doesn't just stay there but rather it brings it now forth into your life and it puts it into action amen watch now as we continue with joshua because we see here that god orchestrates battles for joshua because the thing is joshua going through the land after he started getting a bunch of victories maybe those people would have come out and said we give up we don't want anything to do with you you can have what we what we have we'll just leave but look at what happens in verse 19 it says there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all others they took in battle there's not a single city that threw up the white flag and said we surrender it says for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favor but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses what was joshua's commission destroy them it was not get them out it was to destroy them amen sometimes we think if we can just get him out that's enough no he said destroy them leave nothing left leave no heritage leave no sign leave no child behind talk about leaving no child behind they left no child behind him and there was no trace no remnant of that disease of that idea of that concept of that hybrid element amen speaking as a believer now there was nothing left for anybody to go back and say this is what used to be here it was done it was gone it was a finished work and he says that it was of the lord to harden their hearts and then joshua's commission was destroyed and so god made it sure that he would have to destroy that there was no chance for his conscience maybe to click in and say well they don't want to die so we'll just let them go kick them out put them out past the borders and then we'll just let them go no it says god hard in their hearts because the lord had commanded him to destroy them so god sets up the situation to require destruction so when you look in your life when something comes up against you as what has god called you to do to it and then does god call us to just kick it out so it can come back again and again and again no he says destroy it amen get rid of it completely now sometimes that might take a couple battles before there's total destruction amen and you'll see that in your life with habits and and it'll go out and then it'll come in and then it'll go out a little longer and then it'll come in then it'll go out longer then it'll come in and then you finally defeat that thing for the final time and it's done and it never has any influence on you and then certain things with young men will be different than certain things with young women for men it's the lust of the eyes and these things for women it can be fashion it can be you know beautification these different things you know acknowledgement from the world whatever it might be but you'll see a lot of times there's a back and forth of back and forth before that thing's done but when it's done it's done amen because god does all things well amen god does a total victory god doesn't leave things halfway done and his children don't leave things halfway done amen amen so what we're pointing to though is that if you're facing a battle it's not because that person necessarily wants it's not because that spirit necessarily wants it but it's because god has hardened that thing to come against you so that you can destroy it and then god has lured satan into battle with his bride so that he can train her so that he can do what he can refine her and so that he can give her the victory because to get to to get the the reward for every age you had to overcome and without a victory you can't be an overcomer and then so he brings satan into battle now he hardens the hearts he brings people into your life he brings situations into your life so that you can overcome it and you can get the reward for the age amen god's using satan as a tool to train his bride amen because he defeated him and we'll get into this this next next thing amen he defeated satan and we've got to do the exact same thing amen we don't walk out of here because he did it but rather he wants him to be under our feet as well amen brother braham says now christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil that was his purpose was to destroy the works of the devil because this world is the works of the devil at this point it is in a fallen condition and he came to redeem it back and to make sure that we could come back to that eating condition he says you believe that now i can't explain all this i'm just going to go through it quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you believe that he says what was he god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil notice that hybrid and brother branham hits hybrid religion hybrid word constantly why because we have added something to it satan added something to it he changed something and it made it of no effect and so he says the word comes to destroy the works of the hybrid amen that's why we have to take every word and only that word scripture says if any man adds to it or takes out of the word he says his name will be taken out of the book of life amen so we've only got to stay with what the word says we don't add to it and we don't take away from it he says he's going to destroy the works of the hybrid is that right he was done to do that he was born to that to destroy the works of the devil so if christ is doing that in his day what's he doing in our day amen he's got to destroy the works of the hybrid and then he's got to destroy the works of the adding to and the taking away that satan's done to try and limit the power of the church amen amen he says now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body together catch that the body is head and body together we've got christ the head and we are the body he says so if they're they're one thing together then whatever he's done you got to be doing as well he says that right of christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was is that right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word remember when we covered the seed everything that was in that seed that seed that they talk about in scripture that peter calls it nothing can be added to or taken away from it that's why he says we are virgin born of the words because the word is what was inside us and it hasn't been changed from eternity amen that's the thing that's coming forth in you is the very thing that god placed before you ever had an idea in your head amen not denominational now virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the head is that right he says now the body carries the works and carries on the works and does the works that the head commands it to do but the head said this he says that's how we do things the head said to you want to put the scriptures down i'll give it to you john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also amen so like i said when you're facing a battle know that god has ordained you to face that battle as long as you're with the word as long as you're in the boundaries that he's laid out i mean so often we get into trials and temptations because of our own lusts because of our own ideas because we've decided to go a different way and when you're fighting that battle your best thing is to back away and then because when they did it at ai what happened they failed right you're not going to win a battle that god hasn't ordained but if you know you're walking in the line of duty as we covered last service then you can say this one's got to fall and if he doesn't fall today then he'll fall tomorrow and if not tomorrow the next day the next week the next month it doesn't matter i'm going to keep chopping until it falls down before me amen when you look at joshua joshua didn't face the small men joshua didn't face the little armies the little cities joshua faced giants all around was giants he had giants over here he had giants over here he had giants over here we'll read it in the next one everywhere around joshua is giants and he's facing big battles big people way bigger than him and yet joshua defeats samoa joshua and the israelites the the ex-slaves are the greatest warriors of their time facing the greatest warriors that the world could produce at that time listen to this verse 21 says at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from the mountains from hebron from debye from anab and from all the mountains of judah and from all the mountains of israel joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities there was none of the anakims left of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained who came from gath goliath the only ones left were in the land that joshua didn't didn't take every single giant he destroyed that was in the boundaries that god had given them amen so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord said unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested from war amen amen hallelujah i'm ready for the rest but unfortunately we've got to fight a long time first amen are you with me amen are you ready for it amen but when you look at joshua's call as we read we look at joshua's commission and then we see here what is it joshua had a worthy life now what's make joshua what made joshua worthy because we've got to get this in our head right because so often what we think is if we do the good thing then we're worthy amen we bring nothing to him that's worthy and anything that we do does not make us worthy of the price that he has paid amen there's nothing you can do to warrant the sacrifice that christ paid at calvary there's nothing you can ever do that would ever match up to the price that he paid so stop trying amen but what makes us worthy is what when we do what he has asked us to do that is a worthy life it is is deemed worthy because it's what he told us to do right he says this is what will make your life worthwhile and this is what makes you worthy in my sight is when you do something that i've told you to do amen because the scripture says and i repeat it often and it says that in that day they're going to come to me and say lord lord did not we do what cast out devils in thy name right did we not prophesy in thy name did we not do many wonderful works in thy name and they do but he says what only he that does the will of the father will enter the kingdom amen it's the will of god in your life that makes you worthy that makes you worthy but makes your life worthy if i could put it that way your worthiness is through the blood of christ amen we have his righteousness that's our worthiness but to make your life worthwhile to make it something that god values is to do what he has asked you to do and you'll see and we've read it before where so where you get a man or woman and they get disappointed they get hurt they get offended and they step away and god sends a warning says you should come back and if you don't what does he do he takes them off the earth what is it their life now has lost its worthiness right god knows that he can't do anything with them so he just takes them away and take takes that that blemish if you will away from from him because he doesn't want it there so he just takes them off because they won't do what he says he says i'm just going to take you home then amen why you've got to be found walking in the will of god amen joshua had a singleness of purpose here we don't ever hear of joshua taking a vacation he doesn't go take one one city and then come back to the villa that he captured in the first round you know and then go out again and then maybe do a bit of politicking around and make sure everybody's still on board with this plan joshua just goes from city to city to city to city to city and why because everywhere they go they're taking food they're taking provisions they're taking stores they're taking everything they need to take the next one they just roll on and they roll on and they roll on and they roll on just bang bang bang bang bang he took 31 kingdoms 31 cities 31 kings in 10 years never stop some of these things took months right one after the other just bang bang bang singleness of purpose he says this is what i'm here to do and this is what i'm going to do and guess what by the end of it joshua was old and stricken in years the scripture says it wore him out but that was what made his life worthy was that he did what god had told him to do amen he put everything into it he put everything into it right there was nothing joshua held back from this work amen and that's the thing that i believe we need to come to is where we put everything we've got into living for christ amen into doing what god has called us to do and call and what he's called us to be in this age and giving every single absolute bit of our attention of our energy of our focus of our time put everything into that and i believe that's what's going to bring results is when everything from that world is separated from us and all we're doing is being focused on the word of god being made manifest in our lives our portion is to be the manifested sons and daughters of god amen so let's be it amen it's got to be with singleness of purpose amen most people can't put push themselves for 10 years right you'll see it in ministers especially they get in the saddle and they go they go they go they go you'll see it in the missionaries especially these guys that go back and forth overseas and they're in airplanes and time zone changes and sleepless nights and rough conditions and they'll absolutely destroy their bodies and their health doing it because that's what's driving them is to do what god has called them to do and they'll literally destroy their bodies in doing it but in the end he's going to say that well done now good and faithful servant amen you gave me everything you had to give amen that's where i want to be found amen he put his heart and soul in his mind into it and it took his life that's what made him old was doing the work amen but god preserved him through it god allowed him to finish the job and then he called him home amen speaking of the singleness of purpose now brother brahms speaking of elisha and elijah now remember what elisha said to elijah he says i want a double portion of your spirit right and elijah said that's a big thing to ask he says and so he said if you'll stick with me and if you see me go he says then you'll get the double portion so elisha had to stay with elijah throughout the day go all over and if he stayed with him and then he saw him get raptured away then he would get the double portion now this is what brother brahm says i tell you when god sets a man for a world task he has got to have something better than the world has got amen he has got to have something better than the church has got he has got to go for a double portion amen i believe we all need a double portion today it's not just we're not just talking ministry now amen each one of us needs a double portion to do what god is called because it's getting darker and darker and darker remember this was completely dark when the angel put it on the on the wall we're facing total darkness and when you look out today there is no light out there there's a few people trying to be light yes right but it's darkness still amen because god's moved on he's not in there anymore he's gone out and he's he's he's fellowshipping with the bride amen he says and if there was ever a time that a double portion is needed it's today in the realms of the people he's not talking ministry now he's not talking prophets he says in the people something better than something higher i mean how many want something better and something higher amen say lord lift me up a higher plane as we sing you know it's going to take less of the world that's for sure he says i think beans and cornbread is very good but sometimes i have to reach up a little higher and we do that we've got to we've got to keep climbing now listen to this he says israel was backsliding if it kept staying on the same ground she has got to be moving on or moving back he says and that's the way the church is why because she was told to possess all of it not some of it not rest when you've got enough to fit the whole group on but take everything that god has told you to amen her commission was to possess footsteps his possession and it's the same thing for the bride our commission is to go in a rapture so we don't stop until we go in that rapture and then we keep pressing the battle he says so as they went along it wasn't but a few minutes until elijah said you've asked a great thing but nevertheless if you see me when i go you can have what you've asked for he says now that has to be singleness of motive singleness of heart singleness of i keeping your eye on the promise he says i not eyes right only let it see one thing and that's the word and this one can wander around a bit and see the periphery and what's going on over here and get distracted but if you're looking with one on the word then you won't notice anything else amen he says hum if you're sick this morning if you are afflicted there is one great promise not by elijah but by god himself if thou canst believe when you pray believe that you get what you ask for and you shall receive it no matter what the doctor says how much this goes or that goes keep single on the promise amen keep looking to the promise we look to it for the salvation of our children we look to it for for god's growth in our family we look to it in the ministry we look to it for healing in our in our midst we look to it for deliverance we look to it for changing amen building us up in the stature of god amen all of these things we're looking for he says keep looking to the promise and be single in it be a singleness of purpose look to the promise and look to nothing else and just hold there and believe amen amen make your life's purpose to receive and be what the word says about you or for you as the case may be amen thing with joshua by the end he's old and stricken but yet there was still a work for him to do and that was to divide up the land amen that's a beautiful type of the holy spirit doing what setting the church in order that's what the book of ephesians is setting the church in order to place them where they need to be and then giving them a task to do in their own little land amen amen but when joshua does this now he's not a type of the holy spirit in that sense because there's something else that happens when this goes on and we'll see it it is the holy spirit it's a type in that sense but this portion we're looking at here the next the next bit of scripture in joshua 23 if you want to turn there this is now a man transitioning out okay it's not the holy spirit transition you know because the holy spirit never leaves amen god's always there god's word is always here so when joshua talks here in 23 this is not joshua the holy spirit talking this is joshua a man joshua a leader joshua prophet if we want to put it that way speaking so joshua 23 verse 1 says and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and stricken in age and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and stricken in age and ye have seen all that the lord your god had done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that fought for you behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remaineth to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even under the great sea westward now listen to this i mean this is joshua the man speaking now and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and drive them out drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land ye shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised unto you where's joshua here where's joshua in this scripture does it say and joshua leads you no it says and ye shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised to you so now there's a promise unto you and to your children and as many as the lord our god shall call amen you're going to take your land and god's going to push them out from before you to allow you to take your land be ye therefore courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of moses that you turn not aside there from to the right hand to the to the left what commission is this this is joshua's commission the joshua commission never changes does it what happens is joshua comes and goes moses comes and goes but the commission stays the same he's repeating the very words that god gave him for his commission and saying now you guys take your commission amen this is now on your shoulders to do it i'm leaving but you've got a work to do and he's repeating the very words that god told him to do amen he says that you came not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor caused to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them but cleave unto the lord your god as you have done unto this day for the lord had driven them out from before out driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man has been able to stand before you unto this day he's reminding you look you've had lots of victories one man of you shall chase a thousand one man of you shall chase a thousand amen for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he has promised you amen what are we seeing here we're not a scene seeing an end to the work of god we're not seeing an end to the presence of god we're not seeing an end to the commission of god but we're seeing a handoff of the commission of god right what's he saying when i leave god's staying when i move off the scene god will still be present and the same thing that he told me i'm now supposed to tell you and you're supposed to finish the work that i started amen amen we had a prophet come and do everything like joshua did and then what happened he laid it in our laps he said go do the same thing amen right i was just listening to jesus christ the same yesterday today forever brother brown calls people up my discernment tells them what their issue is lays hands on them and then they're healed and then what does he do he says you lay your hand on the one next to you and next one he says and every one of you pray for the one next to you don't pray for yourself pray for the one next to you and you just hear this roar go up throughout the churches that people realize hey he's commissioned us to do the same thing the god that's with him is with us as well and if we believe then he does the same thing amen what is it it's a handoff of the commission from now just the man of god to the people of god and saying press forward don't stop you've won everything so far god's still with you and if you'll do the same thing i did stay with the word that god gave moses if you'll stick with the word then he'll do continue to do the same thing until you have won everything in your own property in the land that i've given you amen it's the problem in jeffersonville today unfortunately they're stuck with a man they're stuck on a man they said god's still with that man guess what god isn't with brother branham anymore he's with his bride he's moved on amen and there what they're doing is they're looking to a man then to take them back and that's why they're looking for him to come back right they're not recognizing the the present god unveiled before them right he's in the bride now he's not in brother branham he's not working with brother brown he's working in a bride now and if you're looking for that man to come back to give you rapture in faith we've got problems big problems amen amen amen listen to that one man of you shall chase a thousand do we need an army do we need a big army hey if it's one against a thousand it doesn't take many to put the flight anything that comes against you amen amen amen what's he saying he's saying nothing can stand nothing can stand before you don't look at numbers don't look at size don't look at situations don't look at symptoms he's saying one of you can put a thousand to flight and we see it we see it in the scriptures time and time again amen listen to this this is what brother braham says we find out that samson think of that with an old brittle jawbone of a mule that had been laid out on that prairie for many years and anyone knows you could hit it against the rock and fly to pieces it's brittle it's dried out it's not strong he says in samson they said samson the philistines are pounding he looked around he had nothing in his hand and here was a thousand philistines standing there so he just reached down and picked up this whole jawbone and you think of those helmets with sometimes an inch and a half thick over the top of their heads and he took that mule's jaw donut jawbone and beat down a thousand philistines huh them sticking up in the rocks hiding said you want some of it come on down it was a paradox that says but the spirit of the lord was upon him that's what made the difference and then we spoke about shamgar defeating 600 philistines with a with a stick with a blunt iron tip on it what was it he had enough he got sick and tired of it brother brown says a spirit of indignation righteous indignation flared upon him and that's what caused him to do it what was the difference the spirit of the lord was upon him it was a paradox to see a man with well-armed men trained men to fight with long spears and knives and so forth helmets and armors and this one man standing alone in the field with the jawbone of a mule and beat down a thousand of them he said but it's the truth the bible said it was a man that could take the gates of gaza that way down there probably eight tons apiece big brass gates and they fenced him in one night said well we'll get him said we'll comb every hair in here until we find him and we'll get him but this little shrimp come out about midnight looked out there and the gates was in his way so he just picked them up and put them upon his shoulders and walked up the top of the hill and sat down on them it was a paradox remember samson wasn't this big muscular man scripture says the spirit of the lord came upon him and then he did mighty deeds he wasn't this built man i mean that's why that's what the world would paint him as that's what denominations would paint a mess no brother batman says he's a shrimp right but when the spirit of god came on him nothing could stop him amen are you listening church when the spare of the lord came on you nothing can stop you amen he says you can't fence god in you can't tie him in nowhere he is god sure great victory said he's won samson god used him and made a paradox he used anybody as long as you'll take his word if you're ordained for the cause oh i'm weak hey join the group i am weak but thou art strong amen we got here by admitting our weakness amen but he says what he'll use anybody if you'll take his word if you're ordained for the cause it goes back to the question of who you are are you ordained for the cause are you a child of god are you a son of god are you a daughter of god amen or are you sitting here in this church as a grandchild resting on your parents or your grandparents experience amen but if you're ordained for the cause if you are a holy ghost-filled person then you are ordained to take anything that stands before you amen amen again don't get caught up in well that was samson amen what does he say here if you'll take his word and you're ordained for the cause the same thing happens to you when the spirit comes mightily upon you you're going to do something that you never realized you could ever do before amen what was samson before the spirit came on him a shrimp what was samson before the spirit came on him a shrimp a nobody a nothing i could probably beat him in an arm wrestle okay he's not a strong man he's not a man that does courageous deeds before the spirit of god comes on but drop the spirit of god on him and nothing can hold him back amen he kills three thousand when he knocks down a temple at the end of his life he pushes a temple down with his bare hands folks can you imagine push the temple down with his bare hands he kills a thousand with the jawbone he breaks ropes as if they are wax hot wax everything he does is supernatural when the spirit's on him and guess what he was one of the most flawed men in the scripture samson had deep issues he had issues with women he had issues with lust he had issues with popularity and it kept pulling him back and in the end it killed him amen but when the spirit of the lord was on him he did things that nobody else could ever imagine we have the indwelling amen as i said before there is the power of the spirit that worketh in us that we're looking to amen this is something that's always with us god is always with us god is always around us god is always available to us if we're under the blood amen and so the spirit can drop mightily on us at any time amen there's no hindrance now there's nothing to hold back the power of the bride except will you take his word and recognize you're ordained to use it amen amen god didn't come to us by chance i mean i think one of the greatest revelations we can have is that you always were a child of god and there's nothing you can do to deserve it and there's nothing you can do to change it amen you are there before the foundation of the world and you're where you are today because he has called you and he has ordained you for a purpose and it is to be the spoken word for this age amen it is a spoken word we are a spoken word bride that's what brother branham said amen what is something that god has said was going to happen he wrote it down for us and now we are here to manifest today man god doesn't give us the holy ghost as a reward it's not a reward we do it by obedience and there's a process to get it but god doesn't give us the holy ghost as a reward he gives us to us because it's a requirement for the age amen we have to have that token and you can't live the life that he's calling you to live unless you have that holy spirit amen it's a promise to us but it's not a reward every son and daughter of god has to have that holy spirit because the word has to be the word amen and that holy spirit comes from that word amen in the beginning was the word where was with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen it's still dwelling among us i mean that's next service by god's grace amen so what's joshua saying here keep pushing keep pressing don't slack off just because i'm gone doesn't mean that god stopped moving that there's no power there's no strength and then be courageous because he's going to keep doing the same things with you if you'll do what i did while i was here amen listen to this because what's he saying is if you do take he said don't go to other gods don't even mention their name don't don't get alliances don't do any of these things he says stay separate from it and destroy all you're looking to do is destroy the works of the devil amen take out the people that are in the land but the ramp said in christ as the inexhaustible fountain of life we are planted in him by the holy spirit and then just drink from him what he's saying is there's no limit on god for you there's no limit on power there's no limit on strength there's no limit on character the inexhaustible fountain the holy spirit gives you access to that every person that's a christian he says the devil don't care how much you come to christ as long as you don't drink get in the presence we talk about an atmosphere get in the presence what good is it if you don't yield to it amen if you don't let it have an effect in your life he says the devil don't care how much you come to christ as long as you don't drink you can stand at the table in your mouth watering and say well i'm here i'm here you're afraid to turn your faith loose see he said he blames it on our faith he says you have a lack of faith that you won't take that word he says i love guns a man in the last meeting in minneapolis the brother know my weakness i love to hunt he gave me a rifle and how i love it hunting and rifles and fishing he said i've got the rifle saying at home just to go hunting if i never use it it'll never do me no good he says and when you receive the holy spirit everything you have need of for life earth's journey is in you then let me read it again and when you receive the holy spirit everything that you have need of for earth's journey is in you then the power that worketh in you has everything you'll ever need amen amen when you take a little bit of infinity of eternity what do you have no math majors in here you can't take a bit of affinity you can't because it's undefinable so what you have is infinity and then infinity and you have it and i have it and every one of us has eternity because you can't break up eternity and then it's just always there amen so you have the same thing that he has amen but we have it in a body that's condemned that's the only limiting factor for us he says turn it loose and let it go to work see let your faith lose and believe god that's what joshua's saying let your faith loose i've showed it to you i've proved it to you moses proved it to you now it's in your laps it's up for you to do now it's up for you to say this is for me it wasn't just for him and god doesn't just listen to him and god doesn't just back him up but now god backs me up amen and if i'm doing what he was doing then god will continue to back me up all the way to the rapture amen he says oh my what god could do with this little group right now what he can do if he can ever get one person in his grip just so he can hold that one person brother brown points out time and time again god only needs one person and then sometimes it's a woman like jail remember when she had to kill that man he raised up a woman to do it most times it's a man when it comes to spiritual leadership that's the way it's supposed to be in the scripture but there are women that get stirred up too amen miriam got stirred up to lead them in worship didn't she and then we see it all through the scriptures don't let your gender hold you back from saying god won't use me or can't use me amen in the in the the temple he he took the he took christ to who anna and simeon he had a man and a woman ready and waiting and looking amen amen don't let god look down on you sis you know don't look down on yourself sisters and say well this is just for the brothers because brother brown keeps saying manhood and men and sons and the scripture's got to pick a gender you know amen but we're all members of the bride of christ amen we're all supposed to be there on that day amen we've all got to be spiritual we've all got to be led by the spirit amen we've all got to have the holy spirit working in us and if it's working in us then it'll be working in us amen it's not stagnant it's not sitting there but it's going to be doing something that's going to have an effect on those around us amen was he say god if he can ever get one person in his grip just so he can hold that one person he can put ten thousand to flight with that one person joshua says one will make ten we'll make a thousand run you know where the scripture says one will put ten thousand to flight it actually says the enemies he says if you don't serve god he says one of them will make ten thousand of you run do you know that ten 000 is the promise to your enemies if you're out of the will of god mean that you have no strength when you're out of the will of god nothing you can do your theology your your church entity how much you've been you you've studied the message that has nothing to do with it when you're out of the will of god a little tiny demon can make you run like a little scared girl that's what he says amen but when you're on his side and then when god's working through you lebron says you can put anything to flight anything to flight nothing's going to stand before you with one person with genuine faith he can put ten thousand devils running as hard as they can go remember in his meetings he talked about them screaming one to the other right screaming for help scream him for help one man and none of those demons there could touch him he says yes sir amen i'm so glad aren't you it's not just brother branham it's not just joshua it's not just moses it's not just jesus christ this is a commission for the entire bride amen we're talking about a worthy life now and then gideon was the lowest man in the lowest family of the lowest tribe of all of israel and he beat 120 000 plus midianites with 300 men right it's not great lineages you know it's not these tremendous bloodlines it's not well my dad was in or my grandfather was in brother banham's uh services and and he got his hands laid on him and he was told that he was going to be the the next big this at no no no no no he says any man that he can get his grip in any person he can get in his grip that's what's going to send ten thousand running before him amen god's looking for somebody that will believe and obey that's it believe and obey and you'll see a bunch of nobodies in the scripture a bunch of nobodies in the scripture doing things and gideon was one of them remember what he said thou mann of valor and he looks around who are you talking to right no it's not that's not what we're that's not what he's looking for he's looking for somebody that'll believe and obey amen brahm said now if somebody can become one of his people god can use them if they're ready to forget that they are somebody amen that's a tough thing to walk in thinking you're something and then he won't have anything to do with you until you say i am nothing i am but dust as the scripture says if you are ready to forget that you're a somebody and become a nobody then god can use you and make somebody out of you see but you've got to forget that you're so important we see that with moses right moses is raised we read it in last service raised as a deliverer told you're going to be a deliverer god's chosen you you're going to be a mighty man you've got a tremendous work you're going to fulfill prophecy and moses had all of the understanding he had all the intellectual conceptions and then one day he decided i'm going to be a deliverer and what did he end up with one dead egyptian right why he had been told he was a somebody he was going to be a somebody and that god was going to use him he was a deliverer but when he tried to do it his way he just got in his own way and he made a big mess of it and god had to take him out there for 40 years and beat out his idea that he was a somebody right got him married had him looking after sheep in the desert and finally god got him to the place where he realized i'm a nobody can't even talk that's how bad it got i can't even talk amen lebron continues he says and sometimes when we think we're somebody he says the highest hierarchy of heaven became flesh in a foot wash flunky when he come to wash mortal's feet when he come to the earth he didn't come to be a big somebody god always takes the nobodies to make somebody out of them that's the trouble with the people today they're trying to be a somebody you'll see people seeking after gifts seeking after ministry seeking after position seeking after money seeking after influence why because they want to be somebody now sometimes that comes from a godly desire they want to actually say be able to say i'm doing something for god i've got something but the thing is he's got to choose you he's got to place you he's got to show you what he wants you to be amen peter was a great fisherman but when he called him he didn't say peter i'm going to have you set up a school of fishing for christian boys well he said i'm going to make you a fisherman peter never fished again except when he was backslid peter wasn't a fisher anymore and then he was a minister and then god took him completely out of his vocation and turned him into something else amen sometimes we come and we say god i've got gifts i've got talents use them no no no no that's not what we do brother bob and i were talking about this the other day what do we do we come we say lord here i am amen if you want to use what i've got use it but if you want me to lay it aside i'll do that as well amen and i can see the older people saying that's true and the young people will learn that sometimes we're so intent that god has gifted me that we try and force the issue and say lord use me in that area amen no no no we say lord humbly to thy cross i bring what can't bring anything just myself lord use me how you want me to be used amen let's just stand together if we would he says he says you want to become a nobody god takes something that there's nothing to to make something out of it and prove that he's got it let me tell you when god does a work in your life and you know what you had or didn't have as the case was and then he put something in there you know that god's moving in your life amen you know that he's put something in there that you have never had amen that worthy life is a life where god has used you to prove his word for his day that's all joshua was doing god had given them a word he had given them a promise he had given them the time to do it and they said let's be the word for our day amen that's what we're called to do is to be the word for our day you've got to recognize your message so you can know what you're supposed to be if you get the message wrong you're going to get the life wrong as well and that's why brother braham said you have to recognize your message and your day is because you'll be reflecting a word from a different age and it's of no use that's not worthy anymore amen you've got to be what god is that day amen amen we want to be able to say lord you're looking for supernatural and what i've got will not be supernatural unless you take it and use it and guess what if you don't take it and use it then it's going to hinder the supernatural amen talking with a friend of mine yesterday you know about ministering and whatnot and he was he was talking to me about some things in my own life and he said you know if you use that and you fall back on that it's going to it's going to cause your ministry to fail because he says you can step into that so easily you've got to be you got to be able to se step back and just say lord do what you want in this service do what you want with the people get me off my notes be able to move me around in these different things he says because you can step into that intellectual side so easy and that's something i've got to keep under a prayer blanket amen to say lord don't let me get caught up and study so that i don't hear your voice and then don't let my natural gift get in the way of my spiritual gift amen that's what we each one have to do we have to be able to say lord use me as you want and let me lay it aside if you need me to lay it aside amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord we know that we bring nothing that makes us worthy but lord we don't want to come to lay our crown at your feet with no jewels in it heavenly father and lord those jewels are things that and and souls and people that you've lord called lord that we bring something to you and your word says it's going to be tried by fire lord every work that we do every man's work every woman's work will be tried by fire and lord it can be destroyed or we know we can't be lost but our works can be destroyed but we want to take our lives lord yield them to you submit them to you lord so that they would have an eternal effect heavenly father that we can bring something to offer you to lay at your feet and lord it never lord it would stand up against the great price that you paid for us lord but we want to be able to say we did what you called us to do heavenly father lord we pray that you would just minister to your people lord help us to surrender anew this morning lord that we will find our way to your cross lord to lay down everything that would hinder us heavenly father and to step forward in liberty lord where you freed us and you're using us and you're leading and guiding us lord we pray lord just speak to us now lord have your way in the rest of this service in your name we ask and pray amen amen show me your way 1157 brother matt i
