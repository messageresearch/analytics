[16:34] praying that we find the strength of the
[16:41] Lord
[16:50] amen just before we pray uh quick
[16:53] announcement uh we are planning uh a
[16:56] week from today next Sunday to have a
[16:59] um general election so obviously the
[17:02] pastor has already been voted in in the
[17:03] November election so this is for the the
[17:06] other
[17:07] offices and uh one thing to note is that
[17:09] we uh brother Dale is uh stepping down
[17:12] uh as as trustee as you know and we have
[17:14] not had another trustee uh take his
[17:16] place uh to to step forward and
[17:19] volunteer uh to be to be voted on uh
[17:22] ideally we we would like to have two
[17:24] trustees uh just the nature of of that
[17:27] position um in dealing with finances and
[17:30] those types of things it's it's good to
[17:31] have two people there in the event of a
[17:34] um decision needs to be made and and so
[17:36] forth so um I just want to real quick uh
[17:41] to flag
[17:43] that I had it pulled up here and it's
[17:49] gone so Ju Just for those that would
[17:52] that might be interested um the trustee
[17:57] position um this is the this is from the
[18:01] Constitution so the trustees oversee the
[18:03] physical aspects of a church such as
[18:05] Finance property buildings Property
[18:07] Maintenance liabilities trustees are
[18:09] responsible for disclosing the plans for
[18:11] the church property at the annual
[18:12] General business meeting managing the
[18:14] overall upkeep of the property such as
[18:17] uh you know paintings snow clearing
[18:18] repairs Renovations new construction
[18:22] Etc and uh trustees are accountable to
[18:25] members of the church for all activities
[18:26] and decisions obviously so that's that's
[18:28] the nature of the role I will add that
[18:31] um things like snow clearing are being
[18:34] delegated now U to you know um other
[18:37] brothers and and their sons you know
[18:40] that are able to come out and do it so
[18:42] it's not like he'd be responsible for
[18:44] you know all the snow clearing um just
[18:46] want to note that um but if anyone's
[18:49] interested in in being um in being on
[18:53] the ballot for that position just let
[18:55] myself or brother Matt know there there
[18:57] is no uh um you know criteria uh as I'm
[19:01] aware with deacons it's different but
[19:03] trustees it's you know any any male here
[19:06] any adult male could step forward and
[19:07] and uh raise their hand you know for
[19:09] that position so just just keep that in
[19:11] prayer um if you if you are interested
[19:14] in going on the ballot just let us know
[19:16] ASAP this week because we'd like to
[19:18] finalize the ballots and and get all
[19:19] that ready so is that it man anything
[19:27] else
[19:29] okay so if you want if you really feel
[19:31] like there's somebody here that do a
[19:32] great job with the exception of by the
[19:35] Dale don't nominate brother brother Dale
[19:38] um we'd love to have your brother but we
[19:40] understand so uh if anyone's interested
[19:42] in in nominating somebody again just let

[42:39] we've made it through certainly had a
[42:41] rough spell there with all the sickness
[42:42] that was going around and some even
[42:44] getting it twice in a couple of weeks
[42:46] but amen we're still here thankful for
[42:49] it it's good to see my mom she's here
[42:51] for the first service and then she
[42:53] leaves today so we didn't mean to to
[42:55] have so few services but just with the
[42:58] sickness going around and how catching
[43:00] it was is evidenced by basically if you
[43:03] stood next to somebody or talk to them
[43:05] on the phone you pretty much got it so
[43:07] anyways we're we're glad to be back but
[43:09] she travels back today so trusting God's
[43:11] grace to her amen I got a a card here
[43:14] for brother Ivan Brenton as many of you
[43:16] know we went number of us went to the
[43:18] funeral and I want to thank each one
[43:20] that went there publicly but it was a
[43:22] big deal to him and anyways he sent this
[43:24] car back
[43:26] it says uh to brother Jonathan and the
[43:28] Saints at evening Light Fellowship and
[43:30] the card says this extra special thank
[43:32] you note sent to you today holds more
[43:34] appreciation than any words can say for
[43:37] you're among the nicest people I've ever
[43:39] known and you'll never be forgotten for
[43:41] the thoughtfulness you've shown he says
[43:43] with heartfelt gratitude and
[43:44] appreciation without measure you will
[43:47] never know the burden that you lifted
[43:48] off my shoulders I want to thank you and
[43:50] the saints that took the effort to come
[43:52] and help with sister Edna's funeral I
[43:54] really felt the presence of the Lord and
[43:56] know that his will was done God bless
[43:58] with love brother Ivan so that's to to
[44:01] each one that went and each one that
[44:02] supported and so he's just passing on
[44:05] those those uh those things so we say
[44:07] God's grace to him amen it's a lonely
[44:09] time for him now and we're just praying
[44:12] and as I admonish the the people there
[44:14] don't just pray for brother Ivan be his
[44:17] hands be his feet go and fellowship with
[44:19] them and these different things and so
[44:21] even those of us that know him we should
[44:22] probably check in with him from time to
[44:24] time and just encourage him you know you
[44:26] can't tell somebody don't grieve you
[44:28] can't tell somebody to be happy amen but
[44:31] you can say we're praying for you and
[44:32] we're we're there with you and we know
[44:34] that there's there's a light at the end
[44:35] of the tunnel and it does get better as
[44:37] the days go by and we're here to help
[44:39] them any way we can amen man God bless
[44:41] you this morning we're going to read the
[44:43] scripture in numbers 27 says I shall see
[44:45] him but not now I Shall Behold Him but
[44:49] not nigh but there shall come a star out
[44:51] of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of
[44:54] Israel and shall Smite the corners of
[44:56] Moab and destroy all the children of
[44:58] sheth amen God bless you you can have
[45:00] your seats this morning and as you might
[45:02] imagine this was my Christmas message if
[45:04] I could put it that way but the lovely
[45:06] thing about being Believers is if it
[45:08] comes out of the word you ought to be
[45:09] able to preach at any time and I think
[45:11] you'll see as we go here that this is
[45:12] something that we ought to be able to
[45:14] preach any time amen but it's it's
[45:16] something I've been dwelling on for for
[45:17] a couple of months and and I want to I
[45:20] want to take a title this morning of
[45:21] Rejoice amen rejoice and I've been
[45:23] thinking about this service for quite
[45:25] some time and just you you dwell on
[45:27] things and you read something and then
[45:29] it's good to dwell on things you know
[45:31] when when something jumps out at you
[45:32] it's good to just spend some time and
[45:34] and meditate on it you know or David
[45:36] would wrri in the Psalms many times
[45:38] after he'd write a Psalm then he'd say
[45:40] sa and that means think about it dwell
[45:43] on it for a bit and and mull it over and
[45:45] chew it over and and whatnot and I find
[45:47] that as you dwell on things then God
[45:49] brings more to your to your mind and he
[45:50] brings he opens it up and he makes it a
[45:52] little more real to you you know and I
[45:54] think if we dwell on the things of God
[45:56] then it'll start to become more real to
[45:57] us we'll be an expectation for things
[45:59] we'll be looking for things and as we'll
[46:01] see in the service this morning when you
[46:02] start expecting things and when you
[46:04] start looking for things that's when you
[46:05] start seeing them amen it ought not to
[46:07] be a surprise to us many times that
[46:09] things that happen because so often the
[46:10] presence of God has gone before to
[46:12] prepare us for the things that he's
[46:14] bringing our way amen but this is a
[46:16] prophetic scripture in numbers 27 and I
[46:18] didn't read the whole chapter obviously
[46:20] but the surprising thing here is this is
[46:22] balum speaking right a false prophet a
[46:25] man with they true gift but he's a false
[46:27] prophet because he could never bring his
[46:28] life subject to the will of God but he's
[46:31] there and he he says something here and
[46:33] he talks about there shall come a star
[46:35] out of Jacob and there's so many things
[46:37] that are hidden in scripture and even if
[46:39] you think about this message there's
[46:40] things that that we focus on that nobody
[46:42] else focuses on but if you see here
[46:45] there's a scripture here that says there
[46:46] shall come a star out of David and it
[46:49] takes a special person to catch that and
[46:52] it takes a special person to receive it
[46:55] because there's there's a time and a
[46:56] season for every part of the word you'll
[46:58] see and it's allocated to people it's
[47:00] ordained to people that are going to be
[47:01] living in that time that are supposed to
[47:03] see it that are supposed to get
[47:05] something from it amen and this is this
[47:07] is a special scripture because of this
[47:09] scripture only this portion is meant for
[47:12] a particular time the scepter is not
[47:15] going to come out until he rules in the
[47:17] Millennium but the star part was for the
[47:19] time of Christ as we'll see amen but
[47:21] there was going to be a people that
[47:22] would catch it and they would be the
[47:24] ones that would see it happen they'd be
[47:26] the ones that would be privy to the
[47:27] revealing of the word of God in their
[47:29] time if we look in Matthew Chapter 2 it
[47:32] says now when Jesus was born in
[47:34] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[47:36] the king behold there came wise men from
[47:38] the East to Jerusalem saying where is he
[47:41] that is born King of the Jews for we
[47:43] have seen his star in the east and we
[47:46] have come to worship him now there's a
[47:47] lot to unpack here and I want to take my
[47:49] time this morning we haven't had Church
[47:51] in in almost 2 weeks so I'm not going to
[47:53] rush through it if that's okay this
[47:55] morning amen I want to unpack this a
[47:56] little bit cuz I want you to understand
[47:58] the journey not just the destination cuz
[48:01] guess what we're going to spend most of
[48:02] our life in the journey not in the
[48:03] destination we're going to be believing
[48:05] for things we're going to be looking for
[48:07] things we're going to be expecting
[48:08] things and guess what there's a lot of
[48:09] journeying before you get what you're
[48:11] looking for this whole life is a journey
[48:14] and it's not always going to be the
[48:15] season of getting a lot of times it's
[48:17] going to be the season of waiting it's
[48:19] going to be the season of Walking it's
[48:20] going to be the season of expecting but
[48:22] it's not always going to be the day you
[48:23] get what you've been believing for so
[48:25] I'd rather rather we understood what
[48:26] we're going through and not always be
[48:28] looking to the future but to be able to
[48:30] dwell in the presence and have the right
[48:32] at the present and have the right
[48:33] attitude and the right spirit so that we
[48:35] can actually be the way that God wants
[48:37] us to be in our day-to-day walk because
[48:39] if we're walking through life and we're
[48:40] always looking for we'll never met we'll
[48:42] never see what's happening right now
[48:44] brother BR would say time and time again
[48:46] people are always looking back at what
[48:47] God did always looking forward to what
[48:49] he's going to do but they're missing
[48:50] what he's doing now and this service is
[48:52] about what do you do in the now amen
[48:56] so we're in the season this was the
[48:57] season of Christ's first appearing amen
[49:00] and and and we're in the season of his
[49:01] second appearing and so the same thing
[49:04] that's happening then is what's
[49:05] happening now and so I want us to see
[49:07] ourselves in this you know when we see
[49:09] the Christmas scene so many times and
[49:11] they have a manger scene and they've got
[49:12] the Shepherds and they've got the sheep
[49:13] and the donkeys and they have the wise
[49:15] men there as well but that's not the way
[49:17] it was the wise men did not come to the
[49:19] manger they did not come to him as a
[49:21] baby they came to him as a young lad and
[49:22] we'll we'll see that as we go through
[49:24] these scriptures but rather these men
[49:26] Came From The Far East the scripture
[49:28] says they came from the East it
[49:30] literally means from the rising of the
[49:32] Sun and and traditionally it's held it's
[49:35] believed that they came from Arabia
[49:37] Persia and India and it's believed that
[49:39] they were descendants of the three sons
[49:41] of Noah shemam and jeffi and so they had
[49:44] a nominal understanding and reading of
[49:46] the Old Testament they were aware of it
[49:49] but they were not necessarily ones that
[49:50] were fully involved or engaged in it the
[49:52] way that a Jew would be but I want you
[49:55] to understand one thing they were men
[49:57] that studied the stars and because they
[49:59] were men that studied the Stars than any
[50:02] Scripture that related to Stars had
[50:04] special meaning to them there are things
[50:06] today like I said that that we believe
[50:08] and it means something to us because of
[50:10] who we are there are scriptures in this
[50:13] Bible that are only meant for the bride
[50:14] of Christ to see to understand and to
[50:17] experience absolutely it's only for a
[50:20] certain people amen this scripture was
[50:22] meant for them because of who they were
[50:25] and they were ordained they were
[50:27] predestinated to see it and God made
[50:29] them who they were so that they would
[50:31] latch hold of this scripture and it
[50:33] would take effect on them when they saw
[50:35] certain things happen amen it didn't
[50:37] mean much to any many others as we'll
[50:39] see nobody else caught this scripture in
[50:42] in in Deuteronomy the way that they did
[50:44] even the Jews didn't catch it but they
[50:46] caught it and because of that it had an
[50:48] effect to them amen others could accept
[50:51] it as part of the scripture but it
[50:53] didn't mean anything to them it didn't
[50:55] mean mean anything about the time and
[50:56] season brother BR puts it this way he
[50:58] says many of those people in the days of
[51:00] the wise
[51:01] men they didn't pay any attention to the
[51:04] star they weren't looking for it they
[51:06] had their own domestic affairs to take
[51:08] care of they belonged to church that's
[51:10] all they cared for but they had no time
[51:12] for such but these wise men reading the
[51:15] Bible and knowing that the star was to
[51:17] appear as soon as they got the thought
[51:19] that that was to appear they watched for
[51:22] it day and night that means we ought to
[51:25] be searching for something we ought to
[51:27] be looking for something we ought to
[51:28] have something in the word that's
[51:30] causing us to
[51:31] look amen it says and the men and women
[51:34] today in this world who are watching for
[51:36] the signs of the coming of the Lord they
[51:38] see the Revival breaking and their
[51:40] hearts begin to bloom up and
[51:44] rejoice not because it's done but
[51:47] because they can see it coming forth
[51:50] they can see it starting they can see it
[51:53] breaking it's not there yet but they can
[51:55] see what's happening and they can
[51:57] rejoice in the now even though it's not
[51:59] in Full full fulfillment but they can
[52:02] Rejoice because they can see what's
[52:03] unfolding before them under this message
[52:06] of the hour we focus on scriptures that
[52:08] mean something to us far more than to
[52:11] other believers even other Christians
[52:13] are so-called and it's because of who we
[52:15] are it's because we've heard a message
[52:17] that focuses us on something that's
[52:19] particular to us we don't focus on a
[52:22] message from yesterday we don't Focus on
[52:25] a message from 2,000 years ago we're
[52:27] focused on the message that's supposed
[52:29] to draw us into a full relationship with
[52:32] Christ and the revealing of the word to
[52:34] us and in US amen it causes us to look
[52:37] at things differently because we've been
[52:40] ordained to it because we're looking at
[52:43] certain things Malachi 45 and 6 doesn't
[52:46] mean much to many people in fact most of
[52:49] them would say it was in John they don't
[52:51] realize that it's a twf scripture that
[52:53] that happens over 2,000 years Revelation
[52:55] 10 doesn't mean anything to most people
[52:59] today and for even message Believers
[53:01] some of them only go to
[53:03] 107 and they forget about 8 through 11
[53:06] which is our portion it's the bride
[53:09] portion Luke 17:30 doesn't even register
[53:11] to most people but to a message believer
[53:14] these are signs of the times and there
[53:16] scriptures that we focus on because it
[53:18] places Us in the word and in a season
[53:21] that we're supposed to be recognizing
[53:23] amen people will read those scriptures
[53:25] and you you could read it out and say
[53:27] you know Luke 17:30 as it was in the
[53:29] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[53:30] coming of the son of man they'll say
[53:32] yeah that's scripture I believe it they
[53:33] believe it because of scripture not
[53:35] because they recognize it's today but we
[53:38] believe it because we've seen it we've
[53:40] seen it to be happening in this day why
[53:42] because those words are meant to be
[53:44] fulfilled the word is prophetic it's the
[53:47] very thoughts and intentions of God and
[53:49] so he doesn't give it to us to mystify
[53:51] us or to cause us frustration or keep us
[53:53] in the dark but rather it's the
[53:55] intentions of the almighty God and he's
[53:57] bringing it to a people that are meant
[53:59] to take those intentions and embody it
[54:01] and experience it amen the word is given
[54:04] for us to take to ourselves that it
[54:06] would have an effect in our lives in its
[54:08] proper time and season brother B will
[54:10] continue he says the wise men the Magi
[54:12] from the East followed the star for two
[54:15] years down across the Tigers river
[54:17] through the plains they come up over way
[54:19] over in Arabia over into India come down
[54:21] to Jerusalem following that star it says
[54:24] and it passed over every Observatory and
[54:26] none of them wrote anything about it
[54:29] they didn't see it he says but they saw
[54:32] it that means you're going to see things
[54:35] that other people don't see and you'll
[54:36] get excited about things that other
[54:38] people don't see and they will say what
[54:40] are you talking about and you're saying
[54:42] don't you see this can't you see it
[54:44] happening and they say I don't know what
[54:46] you're talking about but it's in the
[54:47] scripture yes I believe it's in the
[54:48] scripture but it's happening they're
[54:51] saying what are you talking about why
[54:54] because you've seen something
[54:55] Supernatural brother Adam says the light
[54:57] that went before them was the star it
[54:59] was the pillar of fire it was God
[55:02] Almighty leading them this wasn't a
[55:05] natural star because we'll see this star
[55:07] can come and go it can disappear it can
[55:10] move
[55:11] continuously Stars don't move like
[55:14] that stars come and go every night this
[55:17] is a star that led them continuously for
[55:20] two
[55:21] years and they saw something and nobody
[55:24] else does there's nothing in recorded
[55:26] history you know we have we have these
[55:28] computer programs now where we can take
[55:30] the entire visible solar system and we
[55:33] can unwind the clock so we can see where
[55:35] every Star was at any particular time we
[55:39] can literally turn everything back to
[55:41] the way it was in Jesus day and if they
[55:43] did it they would not see a star because
[55:45] it was not a natural star this is a star
[55:48] that can move it's a star that can
[55:50] appear and disappear and then it's a
[55:51] star that can hover that ain't a star
[55:54] like like we're used to calling Stars
[55:56] it's a supernatural thing you know what
[55:58] happens
[56:00] sometimes I know this has happened to
[56:02] you and I know it's happened to me
[56:04] you'll read something in your scriptures
[56:06] you read something in the Bible you read
[56:07] something in the message and you go talk
[56:09] to someone and you're so excited about
[56:11] it and what did they say oh that's
[56:15] great that's
[56:17] lovely you're excited and they're not
[56:21] does that mean they don't have the Holy
[56:22] Ghost does that mean they're not a real
[56:25] believer no it just means that you've
[56:27] got something happening in your life
[56:28] that God has quickened to you that he
[56:30] hasn't quickened to them yet and it's
[56:32] not because they're bad or they're wrong
[56:34] or they're out of his will or they're
[56:35] not a real believer but it's because
[56:37] you've got to see it for something
[56:38] that's in your life at that time they
[56:40] don't need it today they believe it but
[56:44] they don't see it the way you see it
[56:45] because they don't need it the way you
[56:46] need it so we don't put somebody down
[56:48] because they do those things amen but
[56:50] what matters is that you see it that
[56:53] God's given you a word for your day that
[56:55] God has come into your situation and
[56:57] he's opened something up to you that's
[57:00] what matters is that you see it amen the
[57:03] wise men were the only ones that saw the
[57:05] star and it was supernaturally revealed
[57:07] to them because they were looking for it
[57:09] brother brandham says amen so we can't
[57:11] expect everyone to see everything we see
[57:13] at the time we see it with the same
[57:14] enthusiasm we see it they'll believe it
[57:17] we believe it as we believe as Believers
[57:19] we believe every word of this Bible but
[57:21] that doesn't mean it's opened up to us
[57:23] at all times and all ways for every
[57:24] everyone else the same way it is to
[57:26] everyone else amen we're all going
[57:28] through different things in life some of
[57:29] us are fighting and struggling and
[57:31] worrying and dealing with different
[57:32] things and my great scripture may not be
[57:34] your great scripture and yours may not
[57:36] be mine but what matters is that you see
[57:38] it and that God's opening up to you
[57:40] because God's got a word for each and
[57:42] every one of us for every day for every
[57:44] season for every
[57:45] situation just trust that he's opened
[57:47] your eyes when you need it Amen brother
[57:49] Bram says this he says so I believe
[57:51] tonight that the holy spirit is here he
[57:54] said says it's here for those who are
[57:56] destined to receive it who that believe
[57:59] it and who is awaiting on it destined
[58:03] believing and awaiting it he says it's
[58:06] here to straighten out every one of them
[58:07] spiritual problems it's here to heal
[58:09] every sick person that's present it's
[58:12] here he says but you've got to come and
[58:14] get in the atmosphere of it he says and
[58:18] the attitude to receive it you got to
[58:21] come not in an emotional workup you got
[58:23] to come upon the basis of what believing
[58:26] a promise that God made he says that
[58:29] does it that's what does it sickness
[58:32] spiritual problems relationship issues
[58:34] issu stress sorrow we're all dealing
[58:37] with things and mine are not yours and
[58:39] yours may not be mine but he's saying
[58:40] God's got a power in his word to come
[58:43] into your life to come into your
[58:45] situation and deal with it and you've
[58:47] got to come what believing and awaiting
[58:51] that's your part you got to come in
[58:53] believing saying Lord whatever you bring
[58:55] my way I'll accept it and I'll take it
[58:57] as mine notice what he says so he says
[58:59] you've got to come and get in the
[59:01] atmosphere and the attitude to receive
[59:03] it and that's a battle we all fight
[59:06] equally we've all got to fight that
[59:08] battle remember the last service I I
[59:10] spoke I think it was we talked about
[59:12] taking the kingdom by force just for
[59:13] that brief moment and how we've got to
[59:15] press into the kingdom of God that's a
[59:17] battle every day is you got to press for
[59:20] the things that God has ordained for you
[59:21] you got to press into the promises of
[59:23] the word you can't just sit back this is
[59:26] not a static gospel this is not a sit on
[59:28] your rear end gospel you got to take the
[59:30] sword of the word and you got to say
[59:32] Lord I believe and start walking by that
[59:34] word amen we've got to press for it but
[59:36] God's got a time for everything and he's
[59:38] got a season for it reading Ecclesiastes
[59:41] there's a time to be born a time to die
[59:43] a time to mourn a time to laugh all
[59:44] these different things but when it comes
[59:46] to the fulfilling of the word when we
[59:48] need it God has already provided the way
[59:50] in his word it's already there we come
[59:52] in we need a word and God has already
[59:54] given it to us but we just got to find
[59:57] it this is already here every answer we
[59:59] need is here and yet sometimes we say
[1:00:02] where's the answer it's in here you just
[1:00:03] got to find it and God's got a way to
[1:00:05] give it to us amen and he's got a season
[1:00:08] he's got a times for these things and
[1:00:10] all he does he just opens up our eyes to
[1:00:12] it you read a scripture I mean if if I
[1:00:14] was to show you my Bible here and you
[1:00:16] probably can't see it but there's
[1:00:17] underlined scriptures everywhere and you
[1:00:20] go in and sometimes it's easy to skim
[1:00:22] over the things you've already
[1:00:23] underlined because you say well I
[1:00:24] already got that
[1:00:25] and then you read it and you're like oh
[1:00:26] my goodness I didn't really get that
[1:00:28] because you you really underlined the
[1:00:30] first half and the second half is what
[1:00:31] you need now or because you've read more
[1:00:34] and God's opened more things up to you
[1:00:35] you read that again and you say oh my
[1:00:37] goodness there's a whole another layer
[1:00:39] of depth into something like that and
[1:00:41] you realize what it means you know
[1:00:44] sometimes can I just be honest this
[1:00:46] morning sometimes I don't feel like I
[1:00:48] read
[1:00:49] enough I I try and give an hour hour and
[1:00:52] a half every morning but sometimes it
[1:00:54] seems like you're not doing enough and
[1:00:56] sometimes life is busy and and and mama
[1:00:59] needs help or you got to run out the
[1:01:01] door to do something for work or
[1:01:02] something and you don't read everything
[1:01:04] you ought
[1:01:05] to and sometimes it's hard it's easy to
[1:01:07] get down on myself about that but you
[1:01:09] know one thing I've noticed sometimes
[1:01:11] he's in that because what happens is I
[1:01:14] delay and I don't read that one chapter
[1:01:17] and then something happens that day the
[1:01:19] next morning when I read it my answer is
[1:01:21] in the chapter and because I delay
[1:01:25] now I read that chapter in a whole new
[1:01:27] way and it's an answer to a question
[1:01:28] it's an answer to a situation it's
[1:01:30] leadership for what's happened what I'm
[1:01:32] saying is my limitations don't stop God
[1:01:34] from giving me answers church now let's
[1:01:37] not rest on our weaknesses let's not
[1:01:39] make excuses for but what I do or don't
[1:01:41] do ain't going to stop him because he's
[1:01:43] got a plan he's got a word that works
[1:01:45] regardless and if he needs me to shut
[1:01:48] down for a while he'll shut me down if
[1:01:50] he needs my busyness to stop he'll stop
[1:01:52] my busyness he'll lay me flat on on my
[1:01:54] back he'll put a full stop to anything
[1:01:57] he needs if he's got to get my attention
[1:01:59] but in the meantime he knows we deal
[1:02:00] with life and so he comes and he finds a
[1:02:03] way to give us his word no no matter
[1:02:05] what Amen brother Bram says it this way
[1:02:07] he says it's usually when you keep your
[1:02:09] mind on Christ that he comes to you it's
[1:02:11] usually at a times when you're thinking
[1:02:13] about him when he appears he says you
[1:02:15] know when you're thinking about getting
[1:02:17] right doing something right that's when
[1:02:20] he comes to you to help you what I'm
[1:02:23] saying church is he got it all in
[1:02:26] control he's never
[1:02:28] late he's never worried or worked up
[1:02:31] that's us that's us but he comes all
[1:02:35] times when he's needed and our
[1:02:37] weaknesses don't stop him our
[1:02:39] inconsistencies don't stop him our
[1:02:41] little isms our little flaws and
[1:02:43] failures big ones even they don't stop
[1:02:45] him he's got a word that's already
[1:02:47] working and it never rests and it brings
[1:02:49] us to that expected End
[1:02:52] Amen brother Brandman speaking of the
[1:02:54] the wise men he says and it must have
[1:02:56] been while they were thinking on this he
[1:02:58] said the sacred fires burning that they
[1:03:00] happened to notice that there was a
[1:03:01] stranger among them something that they
[1:03:04] could not account for none of their
[1:03:06] Scrolls told of it none of their
[1:03:07] writings said anything about it but
[1:03:09] there it was and they couldn't deny it
[1:03:11] they watched the heavenly bodies and
[1:03:13] they knew that something Supernatural
[1:03:15] had taken place notice their Scrolls
[1:03:17] their writings they're not Jews right
[1:03:19] they're not children of Abraham but they
[1:03:21] were ordained to come and worship Christ
[1:03:24] and so God has to get their attention
[1:03:26] regardless and he gets their attention
[1:03:28] by getting them to see something that
[1:03:30] they've never seen before they're
[1:03:33] looking and where they're looking he
[1:03:34] puts the sign in their way and they can
[1:03:36] tie it back to a scripture watch this he
[1:03:40] says oh he is so good he will catch the
[1:03:43] attention of what every person that he's
[1:03:48] ordained to life catch this maybe in
[1:03:52] their own ways of worship
[1:03:56] ship you can be sitting in a
[1:03:59] denomination and he can catch your eye
[1:04:02] you can be walking down the street
[1:04:04] Godless you can be in a bar you can be
[1:04:07] in adultery you can be as black and
[1:04:09] dirty as
[1:04:11] night and he'll catch your attention
[1:04:14] because you're ordained to it not that
[1:04:16] you did anything but you're ordained to
[1:04:19] it by his choosing his election he says
[1:04:22] but he is God and he knows the hearts of
[1:04:24] men and he watches them he protects them
[1:04:29] and he brings them to a
[1:04:32] place you say brother John I'm not where
[1:04:34] I need to be don't worry he's bringing
[1:04:36] you to a place and he'll guard you and
[1:04:39] he'll protect you until you get there he
[1:04:41] says when the Deep call it to the Deep
[1:04:43] there's got to be a deep to respond to
[1:04:45] that call and if a man is thirsting for
[1:04:48] something it shows that there's
[1:04:49] something out there to respond to quench
[1:04:52] that thirst they they saw something that
[1:04:55] Drew them and it was a special star and
[1:04:57] the prophet of God is pointing out
[1:04:58] they're ordained to see it and he came
[1:05:01] to them in their way of worship whatever
[1:05:03] it was and he drew their eye to it and
[1:05:06] he caused them to follow it amen he had
[1:05:08] ordained them to bring gifts he'
[1:05:09] ordained them to worship but first he
[1:05:11] had to get them moving amen he gave them
[1:05:13] the calling he gave them the
[1:05:15] understanding he gave them the focus on
[1:05:17] the scriptures that would pull them to
[1:05:19] worship Christ amen I'm saying that to
[1:05:21] say we're not where we are by chance
[1:05:24] wherever we are we're not here by chance
[1:05:27] amen we're here because we're ordained
[1:05:29] to be it he said the wise men what did
[1:05:31] they see when they followed the start of
[1:05:33] Jesus he said nobody else saw it it
[1:05:37] passed right over the observatory every
[1:05:38] planetarium is that right every city had
[1:05:40] a planetarium they kept time by the
[1:05:42] stars is that right and isn't it strange
[1:05:45] that those wise men ran right through
[1:05:46] city after city city after City
[1:05:49] following a star that even the
[1:05:50] stargazers and the men in the
[1:05:52] planetarium and telling the time and
[1:05:54] things never saw nothing of it he says
[1:05:56] they were looking for it that's where
[1:05:58] it's at you get what you expect you and
[1:06:02] I are no different Church we're no
[1:06:05] different we're called We're ordained
[1:06:06] we're placed for these things we're in
[1:06:08] expectation and we're looking for the
[1:06:09] things of God that he has in his word
[1:06:11] for us we see things because God's
[1:06:14] appointed us to see them we have them
[1:06:16] because we're appointed to have them we
[1:06:18] are them because we're appointed to be
[1:06:21] them Jesus would say time and time to
[1:06:23] his disciples he' say Blessed Be Your
[1:06:25] Eyes for they see and your ears for they
[1:06:29] hear but why were they blessed they were
[1:06:32] blessed because they were in his
[1:06:34] presence because aside from him they
[1:06:36] didn't understand anything they didn't
[1:06:38] understand the Parables any more than
[1:06:40] everyone
[1:06:40] else they didn't they say they'd come to
[1:06:43] him time and time again tell us what the
[1:06:44] parable means tell us what the parable
[1:06:46] means and he'd come and he'd say blessed
[1:06:48] be your eyes and then he'd tell them
[1:06:49] what the parable meant why because they
[1:06:51] came into his
[1:06:53] presence they were ordained to see it
[1:06:56] and he opened up their eyes and he
[1:06:57] explained what was going on and he gave
[1:06:59] them Clarity to what he was talking
[1:07:00] about but Braham says nobody else saw
[1:07:03] that star but those wise men they were
[1:07:05] looking for it he says and Jesus is here
[1:07:07] tonight in his power all of his power to
[1:07:10] heal every person that's in this
[1:07:12] building he says if you're looking for
[1:07:14] him you'll find him he's here there's a
[1:07:17] fountain open tonight and brother when a
[1:07:19] man hungers and thirsts for God there's
[1:07:21] bound to be something in there to create
[1:07:24] create that thirst we don't follow
[1:07:26] something blindly we don't have
[1:07:28] something just for the sake of having it
[1:07:30] but we have a desire we have a thirst we
[1:07:32] have a seeking nature for the things of
[1:07:33] God why because he put it in us remember
[1:07:36] scripture says no man can come to God
[1:07:38] except God draw him first you have it
[1:07:40] because he give it to you and he doesn't
[1:07:42] give it to you to leave it unfulfilled
[1:07:44] right he gives it to you that your joy
[1:07:46] may be full that you would have what you
[1:07:48] would seek inside of you amen and so
[1:07:50] they saw this Supernatural star and
[1:07:52] something in them said we got to follow
[1:07:54] that star and it drew them on nobody
[1:07:56] else saw it can you imagine maybe they
[1:07:58] looked around at others and they said do
[1:08:00] you see that they'd say see what that
[1:08:03] star that's up there look over here in
[1:08:04] this quadrant this they said what are
[1:08:06] you talking about and only the three of
[1:08:09] them is as far as we know only three of
[1:08:11] them saw it but the three of them got
[1:08:13] together and they joined together and
[1:08:14] they went on a
[1:08:17] journey but you see the confusion that
[1:08:20] they caused when they got to Jerusalem
[1:08:22] after two years
[1:08:24] because they come in and they're saying
[1:08:25] where is he that is born King of the
[1:08:27] Jews for we have seen his star in the
[1:08:29] east and are come to worship him no it
[1:08:32] says we have seen it they couldn't see
[1:08:34] it anymore it led them to Jerusalem and
[1:08:37] then it
[1:08:37] vanished God got them started by
[1:08:40] revealing that star to them and they
[1:08:42] tied it to scripture that it was linked
[1:08:43] to Christ's birth and they started on a
[1:08:46] journey and the only thing they can do
[1:08:48] in their condition is follow the star
[1:08:50] they don't have anything else except the
[1:08:52] star cuz the star is going to lead us to
[1:08:55] that King coming out of Jacob it's going
[1:08:57] to lead us to where he is amen that's
[1:08:59] all they had they didn't have this big
[1:09:01] knowledge or understanding of what was
[1:09:02] going to happen what he'd look like any
[1:09:04] of these things all they knew was that
[1:09:06] they had saw a light and it was leading
[1:09:08] them somewhere and for two years they
[1:09:11] followed it Church two years they
[1:09:13] followed this moving star that nobody
[1:09:14] else could see can you imagine when
[1:09:17] other people can't see it and you're
[1:09:19] following something like that we follow
[1:09:22] something Supernatural we believe it
[1:09:24] but they saw something that was
[1:09:25] physically visible to their eyes and yet
[1:09:28] everybody was calling them crazy no
[1:09:29] doubt and for two years they followed it
[1:09:33] why cuz something stirred inside of them
[1:09:35] something was Quicken to them that they
[1:09:37] couldn't deny no matter what it's like I
[1:09:40] remember when all this stuff would
[1:09:41] believe the sign went around and that
[1:09:42] and people were leaving left and right
[1:09:44] and they said how can you follow it how
[1:09:47] can I not follow it because something
[1:09:48] inside me says this is the truth I don't
[1:09:51] choose it chose
[1:09:54] and I just can't deny it I'd be
[1:09:56] miserable outside of it because I
[1:09:58] wouldn't be following what it is if this
[1:10:00] is false then I'm a false believer but
[1:10:03] it's the only thing I can be because
[1:10:04] that's what I respond to you can only
[1:10:07] respond to what God's put inside of you
[1:10:09] amen and they follow for two years
[1:10:11] something that Drew them
[1:10:13] on and that said this is the time of
[1:10:15] fulfillment two
[1:10:17] years we've everyone got a road to walk
[1:10:21] and we start it when we see something in
[1:10:22] the word of God
[1:10:24] and guess what we don't all start at the
[1:10:26] same place we don't all see the exact
[1:10:28] same thing we aren't born into the same
[1:10:30] type of family some come into broken
[1:10:32] homes some into good homes Godless homes
[1:10:34] Christian homes some have more Advantage
[1:10:36] than others but we've all got a road to
[1:10:39] walk and we've got to be following
[1:10:40] something that's real to us amen that we
[1:10:43] see and that that that that we know is
[1:10:45] real and what matters is not where we
[1:10:47] started walking what matters is what got
[1:10:50] us walking in the first place because if
[1:10:52] it was just a Ministry it won't keep you
[1:10:54] if it's Mom and Dad it won't keep you
[1:10:56] it's got to be the word it's got to be
[1:10:59] the word that's calling us on time and
[1:11:01] time amen you know I think of brother
[1:11:03] Joe and brother Chad both entrepreneurs
[1:11:05] and I don't have enough Faith to be an
[1:11:07] entrepreneur which is a good thing
[1:11:09] because you can't mix Ministry and
[1:11:10] business you know so I don't have what
[1:11:12] they have but they both came to a fork
[1:11:14] in the road and they had to decide what
[1:11:16] they were going to do with their lives
[1:11:18] amen and they had to choose a
[1:11:21] road and it's their road to walk it's
[1:11:23] not mine I wouldn't want their Road and
[1:11:25] I'm sure they don't want my road but
[1:11:27] they had a road to walk and when God
[1:11:30] opens up that decision and you walk it
[1:11:32] you got to stick with it you got to know
[1:11:35] your place you got to know what he's
[1:11:37] called you to do and then you got to
[1:11:38] stick with it because it's for you it's
[1:11:41] Sovereign to you brother Matt's road is
[1:11:44] not my road we're going to the same
[1:11:46] place but the way we get there may not
[1:11:48] be the same way amen and so as soon as
[1:11:52] God opens it up to you we see here that
[1:11:54] he gives you Faith to walk it that's
[1:11:56] what God does that's God's gift to you
[1:11:58] is he gives you Faith to walk the road
[1:11:59] that he opens before you he gives you
[1:12:01] Faith to step into it amen and it's just
[1:12:03] for you and you're built for that
[1:12:05] road you say it's been a tough road yeah
[1:12:08] you're still here though that's proof
[1:12:09] you're built for it that you made it
[1:12:11] when nobody else could you're built for
[1:12:13] the road that God has laid out before
[1:12:15] you amen and it gets lonely sometimes it
[1:12:17] might feel dark it might feel
[1:12:19] frightening it might feel just like
[1:12:20] there's nothing happening but yet it's
[1:12:22] your road and God is called you to walk
[1:12:24] it so when God quickens the word to you
[1:12:27] whether it's a prophecy a promise
[1:12:29] whatever it might be that's your sign
[1:12:32] that he's prepared a way for you to make
[1:12:33] it when he quickens it to you that's a
[1:12:36] sign of his will for your life cuz he
[1:12:39] never start you on a road that he won't
[1:12:40] take you all to the end he's faithful to
[1:12:43] complete the work he started he always
[1:12:45] starts you on something that he intends
[1:12:46] to take you all the way through amen
[1:12:48] that's why we preach the full breadth of
[1:12:50] the word in this church we preach the
[1:12:52] practical
[1:12:54] all the way to the Supernatural cuz
[1:12:56] guess what the Practical is in here and
[1:12:58] the Supernatural and everything in
[1:13:00] between sometimes you got to throw some
[1:13:02] meal in the pot and that's practical and
[1:13:05] sometimes you need an axe head to float
[1:13:07] on the water and that's Supernatural and
[1:13:08] it's the same Prophet with the same word
[1:13:10] did both of them amen we believe it all
[1:13:13] the way amen we're a supernatural bride
[1:13:16] but we don't thr throw away the
[1:13:17] practicality of the word of God either
[1:13:19] amen but whatever he's called you to do
[1:13:21] it's meant to live in your life it's
[1:13:23] meant to produce something in your life
[1:13:26] brother BR would say the Wise Men
[1:13:27] followed the star from Babylon all the
[1:13:29] way down they kept time by the stars
[1:13:31] crossed over every Observatory and no
[1:13:33] one saw it it was shown to the wise men
[1:13:35] and he said God chooses who he will
[1:13:38] choose and he does what he wants to do
[1:13:41] he is God that's why we don't tell him
[1:13:44] what to do we just accept what he's
[1:13:47] doing he says and he will never go
[1:13:50] contrary to his word always with his
[1:13:53] word
[1:13:54] now uh in dealing with
[1:13:57] people when you give them the word if
[1:14:00] they say but you know you've got a
[1:14:03] problem because God never says but to
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:07] word he'll add to it as in he'll say it
[1:14:11] is also written but he'll never put it
[1:14:14] away and so when God's leading you if
[1:14:16] you have to cross the word then it
[1:14:18] cannot be God leading you ever
[1:14:22] ever doesn't mean God can't turn it
[1:14:24] around doesn't mean can't God can't work
[1:14:26] through it that God can't turn it into
[1:14:28] something good but that is never God's
[1:14:30] perfect will for you to step out of his
[1:14:31] word it can't be because he is his word
[1:14:34] and he can't disagree with it at all you
[1:14:36] know I remember when I hope brother
[1:14:38] Chad's not here this morning I hope he
[1:14:39] doesn't mind me saying this but I
[1:14:40] remember when he was talking about
[1:14:41] opening up the the clintar franchise and
[1:14:44] I don't know the will of God for brother
[1:14:46] Chad's life anym than I know for the
[1:14:47] rest of you maybe God would show me
[1:14:50] something at some point but I remember
[1:14:51] when he was talking about this
[1:14:55] and I didn't know what to say because
[1:14:58] his intentions were right to be home
[1:15:00] with his family and to be in church so I
[1:15:03] believe his intentions were right but
[1:15:05] whether that was supposed to happen by
[1:15:06] way of a clintar franchise or by him
[1:15:08] getting a regular job or by him getting
[1:15:10] a trucking job that allowed him to stay
[1:15:12] local I didn't know but it's up to the
[1:15:15] individual to find the will of God it's
[1:15:17] not up to me to tell you it I can point
[1:15:19] you to the word I can point you to
[1:15:21] what's right but the that you take to
[1:15:24] get there is up to you and God how he
[1:15:26] brings you into his will is completely
[1:15:28] up to him amen and I believe that
[1:15:29] brother Chad's motives and his
[1:15:30] objectives were right but I don't know
[1:15:32] that clintar was right for him at that
[1:15:34] time I didn't know that amen but what
[1:15:37] matters is that he was convinced of it
[1:15:40] that's all that
[1:15:41] matters my prayer is for him to come to
[1:15:43] the right place his prayer has to be how
[1:15:46] do I get there as long as his heart's
[1:15:49] right God will take him there amen and
[1:15:51] so now you can look back and can you say
[1:15:53] that was the will of God praise the Lord
[1:15:56] we're trusting we're continuing to trust
[1:15:58] right sister
[1:15:59] Leah but it wasn't up to me to say yay
[1:16:01] or
[1:16:02] nay but it's up to me to prayerfully say
[1:16:05] Lord give him the desire of his heart
[1:16:07] which is to be in church and to be with
[1:16:09] his family on a nightly basis
[1:16:11] amen so I can't convince him into it and
[1:16:15] I can't convince him out of it cuz if I
[1:16:17] can convince him in then you can
[1:16:18] convince him out and circumstances will
[1:16:21] convince him out but when he's convinced
[1:16:22] of it then he'll stay with it and
[1:16:25] that'll be between him and God Amen so
[1:16:27] once God shows you his plan and his
[1:16:28] purpose it's up to you to walk in it and
[1:16:31] it's up to you to be faithful it's up to
[1:16:32] you to be
[1:16:35] fanatical the the wise men were
[1:16:37] fanatical two years of traveling
[1:16:41] following something that nobody else saw
[1:16:44] that's fanatical but that's the way we
[1:16:46] ought to be is that when God shows us
[1:16:48] his will and his purpose stay with it
[1:16:50] and stay with it until he shows you a
[1:16:52] corner amen stick with it give it
[1:16:54] everything you've got give it everything
[1:16:57] you've got don't hold back
[1:16:59] anything listen once we've made a once
[1:17:02] we've made a decision and and trusting
[1:17:04] it's prayerfully and by the word of God
[1:17:05] give it everything you've got and stay
[1:17:08] on that road stay on that road and don't
[1:17:10] let anything pull you to the side
[1:17:13] amen why because we're looking for a
[1:17:15] reality of God in our lives and we've
[1:17:17] got to stay and we've got to walk with
[1:17:19] him we've got to walk in the light as he
[1:17:20] is in the light we've got to stay as
[1:17:22] close to him as we can and you know what
[1:17:24] sometimes it's going to be emotional
[1:17:26] sometimes it's going to be lonely
[1:17:28] sometimes we're going to be praising and
[1:17:29] sometimes we're going to be crying and
[1:17:31] it's not always going to coincide with
[1:17:32] everybody else's crying and praising and
[1:17:34] emotion and these different things amen
[1:17:36] but the idea is that you stay close to
[1:17:38] him and so that no matter what comes you
[1:17:40] know you're in his will and you can have
[1:17:42] faith for whatever lies ahead of you
[1:17:43] amen we can stay on the road these wise
[1:17:47] men they said Someday my father said
[1:17:49] here it is written in the Bible his
[1:17:50] father said there be a star of Jacob r
[1:17:53] and when they saw that star when it
[1:17:55] appeared they were looking for it they
[1:17:57] saw it and the rest of them didn't see
[1:17:59] it now watch brother Bram here he's
[1:18:01] making a transition because he says
[1:18:02] they're
[1:18:04] fanaticals Fanatics and now he starts to
[1:18:07] talk about how we're
[1:18:08] Fanatics how we see something that other
[1:18:11] people don't see he says somebody said
[1:18:13] don't you think them people who cry and
[1:18:15] Shout are all emotional and worked up no
[1:18:18] sir they're not don't you think it's
[1:18:20] psychology speaking no sir I do not
[1:18:22] they're expecting something they're
[1:18:25] expecting Mana from Heaven to feed their
[1:18:28] souls and while they're sitting there
[1:18:30] under expectations God is under
[1:18:32] obligation to give them the Mana from
[1:18:35] heaven cuz they're expecting it you come
[1:18:38] in expecting you'll get you come in not
[1:18:42] expecting it'll only be by his grace you
[1:18:45] get cuz remember you got to come in the
[1:18:48] attitude to receive it the wrong
[1:18:51] attitude with the the right word won't
[1:18:54] mix you got to come in with an attitude
[1:18:56] to receive what God's feeding what God's
[1:18:58] giving and we'll see in a little bit as
[1:19:00] we get to the near the end of the
[1:19:01] service what that looks like God's under
[1:19:04] obligation to give them the Mana from
[1:19:05] Heaven because they're expecting it he
[1:19:07] says you're expecting a meeting God's
[1:19:09] under obligation to give it to
[1:19:11] you that's our part we ought to come to
[1:19:15] service
[1:19:16] ready we ought to come to service on
[1:19:19] time we ought to come to service prayed
[1:19:22] up
[1:19:23] so that the song leader doesn't have to
[1:19:25] drag us up out of our depths of our
[1:19:27] murky
[1:19:28] life and the pastor doesn't have to beat
[1:19:31] himself out trying to get you to respond
[1:19:33] to the word of God right we ought to
[1:19:35] come in ready and expecting and we'll
[1:19:37] get a lot more out of the service amen
[1:19:40] it'll be
[1:19:42] easy easier if we come in the right way
[1:19:46] we come in expecting we get what we
[1:19:49] expect brother Brown would say it time
[1:19:51] and time again you get what you expect
[1:19:54] you get in what you put
[1:19:56] out get out what you put in
[1:20:00] amen but you see here so often he's just
[1:20:02] trying to get us started he's just
[1:20:05] trying to get us moving in the right
[1:20:06] direction he's trying to get us to
[1:20:07] follow him and he doesn't show us the
[1:20:08] whole journey I think any any mature
[1:20:11] Christian can say I didn't know I was
[1:20:14] going to go this way when it's all said
[1:20:15] and done that the path has led in many
[1:20:17] ways that I didn't expect up front but
[1:20:19] he's just trying to get us going in the
[1:20:20] right direction he's just trying to get
[1:20:22] us started on these things amen and
[1:20:24] brother brah said as we said earlier he
[1:20:25] guides us he protects us and we don't
[1:20:27] always understand what's happening or
[1:20:29] what's about to be around the corner in
[1:20:30] these things we just have to trust and
[1:20:33] follow and it's simple and it's not
[1:20:36] always glamorous it's not always fun
[1:20:38] it's not always shouting and praising
[1:20:40] either is it there's battles there's
[1:20:42] struggles there's there there there's
[1:20:43] endurance that's required in these
[1:20:45] things but like Abraham and Sarah he
[1:20:47] leads we follow it says and he took them
[1:20:51] to a land and they didn't even know
[1:20:52] where it was they didn't even know where
[1:20:54] they were going but they were following
[1:20:55] his leadership we know where the end
[1:20:58] goal is but we don't know when it's
[1:21:00] going to be and we don't even know how
[1:21:02] it's going to happen necessarily explain
[1:21:04] how the Rapture is going to happen we
[1:21:07] know what it is we can't explain how
[1:21:09] it's going to happen we don't know when
[1:21:10] it's going to happen we don't know
[1:21:12] what's going to trigger it all we can
[1:21:14] see the signs of the times but God has
[1:21:17] it all wrapped up in a little mystery
[1:21:19] and we'll understand it when it happens
[1:21:21] and probably not a whole lot more before
[1:21:23] that but watch what
[1:21:25] happens with these wise men we just read
[1:21:27] this said same where is he that is born
[1:21:29] King of the Jews for we have seen his
[1:21:31] star in the east and are come to worship
[1:21:33] Him they've lost the star and they're
[1:21:35] saying we need some help here brother
[1:21:37] says up and down the streets witch men
[1:21:39] testifying like holy rollers where is he
[1:21:41] tell me where he is that's born King of
[1:21:43] the Jews for we've done seen his sign
[1:21:45] and we've come to worship him we saw his
[1:21:47] star in the east and we've come to
[1:21:49] worship him he says but they didn't have
[1:21:52] the end answer they haven't got it today
[1:21:54] the same thing now notice when God sends
[1:21:56] a sign into the church the church fails
[1:21:59] to see it this is an individual Affair
[1:22:01] and it's only for the elect he says same
[1:22:04] as they did then so what they made so
[1:22:06] much fuss about it until they had to
[1:22:08] call the San hedin Court to find out
[1:22:11] what this was all
[1:22:14] about it says when Herod heard the the
[1:22:17] king heard these things he was troubled
[1:22:18] and all Jerusalem with him why why are
[1:22:21] they troubled because you've got these
[1:22:23] men that can see a star that are
[1:22:25] proclaiming the birth of the Messiah and
[1:22:27] nobody else can see it but these men
[1:22:30] have been so convinced that they've
[1:22:31] traveled for two years from a far away
[1:22:34] country and they're convinced that the
[1:22:36] Christ has been
[1:22:37] born now they're coming to the Jews who
[1:22:40] are supposed to know this stuff it's
[1:22:42] meant for the Jews it's their Messiah
[1:22:45] it's their Christ and they're saying we
[1:22:47] don't see a star we haven't seen a
[1:22:50] star but yet clearly these men are
[1:22:52] convinced that there is one and it
[1:22:54] troubled them because they knew they
[1:22:55] ought to have seen it but they couldn't
[1:22:57] see it that they were talking about
[1:22:59] something that was in their scriptures
[1:23:00] but they couldn't place it in this time
[1:23:02] and
[1:23:03] season it says and when he had gathered
[1:23:05] all the chief priests and scribes of the
[1:23:07] people together he demanded to them
[1:23:08] where Christ should be born and they
[1:23:10] said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for
[1:23:12] thus it is written by the prophet and
[1:23:14] thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are
[1:23:16] not the least among the princes of Judah
[1:23:18] for out of thee shall come a governor
[1:23:20] that shall rule My People Israel
[1:23:23] so catch what's happened now the star
[1:23:25] has led them to Jerusalem and then it's
[1:23:28] disappeared it's left them high and
[1:23:31] dry for two years they've given
[1:23:34] everything they have and then it leads
[1:23:36] them to Jerusalem and then it disappears
[1:23:39] so they say well it's disappeared so
[1:23:41] clearly he must be in Jerusalem so
[1:23:43] they're going around trying to find him
[1:23:45] where is he where is he you guys are the
[1:23:47] people of the Messiah you ought to be
[1:23:49] able to tell us where the Messiah is and
[1:23:51] everyone's like there ain't no m mesiah
[1:23:52] what are you talking
[1:23:54] about nobody's got an
[1:23:57] answer but then what
[1:23:59] happens is they go to the word and they
[1:24:02] say well the word says he's going to be
[1:24:04] born in Bethlehem but their eyes are
[1:24:07] blinded to the season they're in they
[1:24:09] give him a word answer without
[1:24:11] recognizing the word is happening right
[1:24:12] now it's already happened and they
[1:24:14] didn't know it Their Eyes Were blinded
[1:24:16] even though they knew all about it catch
[1:24:19] this the Jews could have taken
[1:24:21] inspiration from the those wise men and
[1:24:23] went to Bethlehem and they still would
[1:24:25] not have found
[1:24:26] Christ why CU it takes a supernatural
[1:24:29] event to find
[1:24:32] Christ he's got to lead you to him you
[1:24:35] can't find him on your own they'd have
[1:24:37] gone and they could have searched all
[1:24:38] the Bethlehem and they'd have walked
[1:24:40] right over Jesus you know why cuz he
[1:24:42] looked just like you and I came from a
[1:24:44] broken home a mother with a bad
[1:24:47] reputation something wasn't quite right
[1:24:50] and they'd have completely said they
[1:24:52] have missed them completely why because
[1:24:54] they didn't have a supernatural word
[1:24:55] leading them they knew they had the
[1:24:57] knowledge of it but they didn't have a
[1:24:59] revelation of it knowledge wasn't going
[1:25:01] to get them to Christ scripture says few
[1:25:05] the few there are there many there they
[1:25:07] are called few are chosen right few
[1:25:10] there be that find it they had all the
[1:25:12] knowledge in the world but they didn't
[1:25:14] have a revelation of what it meant or
[1:25:16] that it was the time and the season it
[1:25:18] had put him in the right general area
[1:25:20] and you'll see it today I remember my
[1:25:22] wife I watching a man in Dallas Texas on
[1:25:24] YouTube maybe 78 years ago and he was
[1:25:27] going into the seals and he was getting
[1:25:29] so
[1:25:30] close but he couldn't hit the target why
[1:25:34] it wasn't revealed to him all of his
[1:25:36] study all of his knowledge all of his
[1:25:38] time it was getting close but it
[1:25:40] couldn't hit the target it takes God
[1:25:42] revealing himself to us
[1:25:45] amen says when they got the court out
[1:25:47] and opened up the scriptures that
[1:25:49] perhaps they hadn't read just their own
[1:25:51] Creeds for for years but as they read
[1:25:53] the scriptures they got Micah's prophecy
[1:25:55] that said in Bethlehem of Judea he says
[1:25:57] listen brother if the church hasn't got
[1:25:59] the answer to these signs and wonders
[1:26:00] the words got the of God's got the
[1:26:02] answer if your pastor hasn't got the
[1:26:04] answer God's word's got the answer if
[1:26:06] you're hungering for it God will show it
[1:26:09] to you in the word because God keeps his
[1:26:12] word every true servant of God points
[1:26:14] you to the word not to himself points
[1:26:17] you to the word because the word has the
[1:26:21] answer that ought to be it if we're
[1:26:23] dropping down into the ranks of
[1:26:25] ministerial opinion we've lost something
[1:26:28] we need a word answer for our lives
[1:26:30] every
[1:26:31] day scripture continues it says then
[1:26:33] Herod when he had privily called the
[1:26:35] wise men inquired of them diligently
[1:26:37] what time the star appeared so Herod
[1:26:39] wants to know how long it's been since
[1:26:41] that star appeared cuz the star said
[1:26:43] that's when he was born and Herod needs
[1:26:45] to know how old are the children that he
[1:26:46] has to kill this is how Herod knows that
[1:26:48] he's got to kill the two and under
[1:26:50] two-year-old and underr it says says and
[1:26:52] he sent them to Bethlehem and said go
[1:26:54] and search diligently for the young
[1:26:56] child and when ye have found him bring
[1:26:58] me word again that I may come and
[1:27:00] worship him also now when they had heard
[1:27:02] the king they departed and lo the star
[1:27:05] which they saw in the East so they saw
[1:27:07] it they followed it then it disappeared
[1:27:08] but now it's back as soon as they leave
[1:27:11] Jerusalem it comes back it went before
[1:27:13] them until it came and stood over where
[1:27:16] the young child was so notice it didn't
[1:27:18] just take them to Bethlehem it didn't
[1:27:20] just take him to the street it took them
[1:27:22] to the specific house where Christ was
[1:27:26] it took them right exactly to where they
[1:27:28] needed to be it takes a supernatural
[1:27:31] experience to find Christ amen you can't
[1:27:34] fight him he's got to lead you to
[1:27:35] himself it says now when they saw the
[1:27:37] star they rejoiced with exceeding great
[1:27:41] joy we're speaking of Rejoice this
[1:27:42] morning says and as soon as they found
[1:27:44] out the place where that this thing was
[1:27:46] to take place they left the city and the
[1:27:48] council setting thinking what they would
[1:27:50] do they'd have to get rid of this this
[1:27:52] couldn't get breezed around amongst the
[1:27:53] people they'd have to stop this because
[1:27:55] it would break up their tradition they'd
[1:27:58] have to put an end to it so all those
[1:28:00] religious people could think to do was
[1:28:02] to suppress it he says and the wise men
[1:28:05] had to get away from
[1:28:07] that he says and as the wise men went
[1:28:09] out of the city Gates as soon as they
[1:28:11] got out of that gloomy place the star
[1:28:13] appeared again he says when you come out
[1:28:15] of the world and its Traditions the
[1:28:17] glory of God will appear to you and will
[1:28:19] lead you when you come out of yourself
[1:28:21] and out of your sins out of your
[1:28:23] unbelief and leave it all behind and
[1:28:25] raise your heart to God then God will
[1:28:28] appear to
[1:28:31] you he says and when they saw that star
[1:28:33] again the Bible said they rejoiced with
[1:28:35] exceeding great joy they must have
[1:28:37] shouted a little exceeding great joy for
[1:28:40] they knew that they were following the
[1:28:42] sign that was going to lead them to the
[1:28:45] Savior and it did just that notice their
[1:28:49] rejoicing was over the right thing and
[1:28:51] the right thing LED them to what they
[1:28:52] were looking for it says may I say
[1:28:55] tonight that God has a sign today and
[1:28:57] it's a sign of his spirit that where
[1:28:59] Jesus is there's life for he is life
[1:29:02] where Jesus is there's Gospel Light for
[1:29:04] he is light and where Jesus is there is
[1:29:07] fire for he is a consuming fire that
[1:29:09] burns up all your unbelief and your
[1:29:14] draws oh my church we have some dross
[1:29:16] that needs to be burned out this morning
[1:29:18] the little lumps the little bumps the
[1:29:20] little flaws the little failures the
[1:29:22] little lims amen the little impurities
[1:29:24] that hold us back so many times see
[1:29:27] we've got people that will say he's life
[1:29:29] and he's light but what about the
[1:29:31] fire brother Bram said I'd rather a
[1:29:33] little Wildfire than no fire at all
[1:29:36] sometimes we're so worried about what
[1:29:37] it's going to do that we don't let it do
[1:29:38] what it's supposed to do amen amen let's
[1:29:41] not quench the spirit of God but notice
[1:29:44] what was their time of rejoicing we're
[1:29:46] speaking on rejoice this morning there's
[1:29:49] a 2-year Journey that's happened then
[1:29:52] they come in and they lose the
[1:29:54] star but they've spent two years of
[1:29:57] hardship two years over valleys and
[1:29:59] mountains and winter cold and summer
[1:30:01] heat and desert and rivers and floods
[1:30:04] and all sorts of adversities faithfully
[1:30:07] following that
[1:30:09] star let me say something you're going
[1:30:12] to face
[1:30:14] difficulties you're going to face hard
[1:30:17] times now here's the question what's
[1:30:20] your attitude going to be
[1:30:22] because they had a star that was going
[1:30:25] before them so when they came up to that
[1:30:27] that river that was flooded and everyone
[1:30:30] else would have pulled back they could
[1:30:32] sit there and they could groan and say
[1:30:34] we're going to get wet and we're
[1:30:35] probably going to die and they get down
[1:30:37] at the mouth or they could say the star
[1:30:40] is on the other side and that star is a
[1:30:42] guarantee that I'm going to make it that
[1:30:45] the god that's led us this far will take
[1:30:47] us through the flash flooded Rivers will
[1:30:50] take us over the mountain will take us
[1:30:52] through the deep snow will take us
[1:30:54] through the land where there is no water
[1:30:56] we can say that he's led us th far and
[1:30:58] so we've got to keep going and he'll
[1:30:59] guarantee our safety or we can sit here
[1:31:01] and say woe is me life is so difficult
[1:31:05] either he's LED you here or he hasn't
[1:31:07] church either he's real or he's not
[1:31:09] either you're a Believer or you're not
[1:31:11] either he's LED you this far or it's
[1:31:13] been all in your head either that or
[1:31:15] you've LED yourself astray and if we've
[1:31:18] LED ourselves astray Church we've got to
[1:31:20] take us back to where we left him cuz
[1:31:22] sometimes we are sometimes we get out of
[1:31:24] his will sometimes we make our own
[1:31:25] decisions and we've got to be mature
[1:31:27] enough to say that was me it wasn't him
[1:31:29] and go back to where we left him but if
[1:31:31] he's leading us then we ought to be able
[1:31:33] to go through whatever he's taking us
[1:31:35] through cuz he's leading and he doesn't
[1:31:37] lead us in there to kill us he leads us
[1:31:39] to overcome it amen to survive
[1:31:42] everything he brings us through what do
[1:31:43] you think they felt like when that star
[1:31:46] disappeared Faithfully two
[1:31:49] years risking life and limb
[1:31:53] ridiculed seeing something that nobody
[1:31:55] else
[1:31:56] sees Lord I'm trusting you and then God
[1:31:59] disappears The Light disappears the
[1:32:02] thing that they've been leading them for
[1:32:03] so long left it do you think they said
[1:32:06] well that's it we've been fooling
[1:32:10] ourselves sit down and have a good
[1:32:13] cry no they didn't do that they said he
[1:32:18] took us this far he'll take us all away
[1:32:21] and they started digging and they
[1:32:23] started seeking and they started asking
[1:32:25] until they got the answer that they were
[1:32:26] looking for sometimes God takes us in a
[1:32:29] particular direction like I said before
[1:32:30] he's just trying to get us started and
[1:32:32] we have no idea what Waits us we don't
[1:32:35] know what the journey is going to look
[1:32:36] like we don't even know what the end's
[1:32:38] truly going to look like but he's just
[1:32:40] getting us going and then we come to a
[1:32:42] place and it seems like our leadership
[1:32:43] was for
[1:32:44] nothing I've experienced that in my life
[1:32:47] many of you know I mean I've been I've
[1:32:49] traveled a lot in the 20 years I've
[1:32:50] since I left the church Church in 20
[1:32:53] 2003 I've been to a lot of places a lot
[1:32:56] of Ministries made and lost a lot of
[1:32:59] friends sat under all kinds of preaching
[1:33:03] all kinds of people and there were times
[1:33:05] where I said what's going
[1:33:08] on doesn't seem like anything's
[1:33:10] happening just seems like all it's come
[1:33:12] to is
[1:33:16] failure many of you know the stories
[1:33:18] I've
[1:33:19] told Pastor fell away and these
[1:33:21] different things you sit there and say
[1:33:23] did I miss the will of God but now 20
[1:33:26] years later you can look back and say he
[1:33:27] was leading me every step of the way
[1:33:30] because you see the
[1:33:31] effect and I survived where many people
[1:33:34] would not
[1:33:37] survive we've got to be able in the
[1:33:39] times when it seems like he's not there
[1:33:41] say he's led me this far I'm standing on
[1:33:44] the word and he'll keep me going he'll
[1:33:46] show me the way amen there was times I
[1:33:49] absolutely felt what's next what am I
[1:33:52] doing here why am I still
[1:33:54] here but he had a plan but he actually
[1:33:57] had a time and a season for those things
[1:34:00] God never forsakes us church and his
[1:34:01] word is always there for direction it's
[1:34:04] always there and I would say it this way
[1:34:06] when God gives you a direction keep
[1:34:08] going in that direction until he until
[1:34:10] he
[1:34:11] stops and you say well I can't see him
[1:34:13] keep going in the direction he showed
[1:34:14] you last cuz when he wants you to turn a
[1:34:17] corner he'll show you when to turn a
[1:34:19] corner and he'll put a stop and that's
[1:34:21] what he did here was they got into the
[1:34:23] right place they just weren't in the
[1:34:25] exact right place they were in the right
[1:34:27] land they're in the right General
[1:34:29] vicinity but they needed to go someplace
[1:34:31] specific amen so they didn't Panic they
[1:34:33] didn't turn back they didn't sell off
[1:34:35] their gifts they didn't give up they
[1:34:36] started banging on doors walking down
[1:34:39] the street saying does anybody know
[1:34:41] where the king of the Jews is and they
[1:34:44] didn't rest until they got an answer and
[1:34:47] what was the key that unlocked it Church
[1:34:49] the word of
[1:34:50] God
[1:34:52] maybe they didn't have all of the
[1:34:53] scriptures they hadn't studied it all
[1:34:55] the way that the Jews had but the answer
[1:34:58] was unlocked in the word of God and
[1:35:00] notice Jerusalem might have seemed the
[1:35:02] obvious
[1:35:04] place that was the capital the city of
[1:35:08] David City of Peace but it
[1:35:11] wasn't that word LED them right out of
[1:35:13] Jerusalem into a little lowly town
[1:35:15] called
[1:35:17] Bethlehem but notice when they
[1:35:19] rejoiced they didn't re when they saw
[1:35:22] Christ they rejoice when they saw the
[1:35:24] word leading them they rejoiced even
[1:35:27] while they were on the journey they
[1:35:28] rejoiced before they even got to see the
[1:35:30] Fulfillment before the end of everything
[1:35:32] that they'd worked for all the travel
[1:35:34] that they put on you know so often we
[1:35:36] wait until the end to rejoice and we
[1:35:37] miss out the joy of the
[1:35:40] journey that's why we're talking about
[1:35:42] it this morning if you can find your
[1:35:44] place in the word if you can find
[1:35:46] yourself in the will of God and the
[1:35:47] promise of God then the journey can be
[1:35:49] as enjoyable as the destination that you
[1:35:51] can have joy whether you're in a season
[1:35:54] of uh of greatness and goodness and and
[1:35:57] all these things happening or whether
[1:35:59] you're in a lean season whether it's
[1:36:00] winter or summer spring or fall whether
[1:36:03] you're on a Mountaintop or down in a
[1:36:05] valley whether you're walking alone or
[1:36:07] whether you got some fellowship along
[1:36:08] the way you can Rejoice because you see
[1:36:11] the word going ahead of
[1:36:14] you our attitude now is what matters as
[1:36:18] to how this journey is going to go you
[1:36:20] can get to heaven
[1:36:23] sad down at the mouth or you can get
[1:36:26] there Joy full of joy full of
[1:36:29] thankfulness full of the goodness of God
[1:36:32] the attitude doesn't change what you get
[1:36:35] just changes how you get
[1:36:36] it I'd rather come to Heaven happy I'd
[1:36:40] rather come to Heaven rejoicing in the
[1:36:41] way I've gone rather than boning my fate
[1:36:45] because I've had rough years and I've
[1:36:47] had great years but the ability to be
[1:36:49] content with the leading and provision
[1:36:51] of God through all of it is a Grace that
[1:36:53] I believe is available to us amen
[1:36:54] scripture says he's bringing us to an
[1:36:56] expected end and if you know the end you
[1:36:58] can rejoice in the in the journey that's
[1:37:00] taking you there
[1:37:02] amen when you've got a burning in your
[1:37:05] heart when the word is being quickened
[1:37:07] to you that's a time when you can
[1:37:08] Rejoice even though you don't see it yet
[1:37:10] because he doesn't Quicken it without an
[1:37:12] intention of giving you what he's
[1:37:13] quickened to you amen what is it it's
[1:37:15] God being
[1:37:16] personal that's why we need to have our
[1:37:18] devotions and read our Bibles so God can
[1:37:20] be personal
[1:37:22] you know how many times when we have
[1:37:23] special meetings and I get up and I say
[1:37:25] if God gets personal
[1:37:28] Rejoice I don't want a generic message I
[1:37:30] don't want a generic gospel I want God
[1:37:32] to come in and sit down in the Pew right
[1:37:34] next to me and give me what I need
[1:37:36] whether I like it or not CU I'm not
[1:37:38] always going to like it as in it's not
[1:37:40] always going to feel good it's not
[1:37:42] always going to build me up sometimes
[1:37:43] it's going to tear me down sometimes
[1:37:45] going to knock some things off amen but
[1:37:47] if he's personal then that means he he
[1:37:49] cares about me he loves me cuz God gets
[1:37:51] real personal with sons and daughters
[1:37:53] amen what's he doing he's showing you
[1:37:55] his way of bringing you back into his
[1:37:58] presence says and so the wise men when
[1:38:00] they heard that they struck out the gate
[1:38:02] and as soon as they left that old cold
[1:38:04] backslid and formal place there hung the
[1:38:06] star again the star was there and the
[1:38:08] Bible said they rejoiced with exceeding
[1:38:10] great joy oh I might say they shouted a
[1:38:13] little when they found it that that
[1:38:14] blessed Supernatural that they had seen
[1:38:17] when they got out of them old cold
[1:38:18] formal ways it appeared again there was
[1:38:21] and had led them to Bethlehem where they
[1:38:22] found that one where he who was Emanuel
[1:38:25] was being raised up in a carpenter shop
[1:38:28] poor says and when they came into the H
[1:38:31] they were com into the house they saw
[1:38:32] the young child not a baby remember they
[1:38:35] saw a babe in a Manger now it's a young
[1:38:37] child he's grown with Mary his mother
[1:38:40] and they fell down and worshiped him and
[1:38:42] when they had opened their Treasures
[1:38:43] they presented unto him gifts gold and
[1:38:45] frankincense and myrrh brother R says
[1:38:48] and when they and they unloaded
[1:38:49] everything they had and laid it at his
[1:38:52] feet he says and they worshiped him
[1:38:54] because they know the light had come and
[1:38:57] the savior of the world was being born
[1:38:59] they gave everything they had because
[1:39:01] God had given God so loved the world
[1:39:04] friend and that's you and I that he gave
[1:39:06] his only begotten son that whosoever the
[1:39:08] Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian
[1:39:10] the Infidel whatever you are whosoever
[1:39:13] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:39:15] have eternal life what you're seeking
[1:39:17] for he says have
[1:39:19] life what's the battle Church to keep
[1:39:23] seeking they didn't stop they didn't
[1:39:26] rest they didn't sit down on the corner
[1:39:28] they didn't take a suite in the hotel
[1:39:29] they walked and they asked and they
[1:39:31] sought and they sought until they got
[1:39:33] their answer the scripture says seek and
[1:39:36] you'll find knock and it'll be opened
[1:39:38] unto you but you've got to seek you've
[1:39:41] got to knock you've got to press you got
[1:39:43] to push you got to say Lord I'm waiting
[1:39:46] on you I'm trusting in you don't blindly
[1:39:47] set off in a direction of your own
[1:39:49] choosing find your way into the presence
[1:39:52] of God find your way into the word of
[1:39:54] God and stay there until he gives you an
[1:39:56] answer there's nothing so critical that
[1:39:59] we have to make a decision on our own
[1:40:01] nothing nothing amen but as soon as he
[1:40:04] gives you Direction that's when you can
[1:40:06] Rejoice because if he gives you
[1:40:07] Direction then he's got a way to work it
[1:40:09] all out and he's got a plan he's got a
[1:40:11] purpose and all of these things there's
[1:40:13] a certainty when God's leading us that
[1:40:14] allows us to have the celebration before
[1:40:16] we ever reach the Finish Line the
[1:40:19] scripture you know we we have that old
[1:40:20] Cathedral song that I mentioned so many
[1:40:22] times I've read the back of the book and
[1:40:23] we win that means we can Rejoice about
[1:40:26] the victory even while we're in the
[1:40:28] midst of the battle you know what and
[1:40:30] when can you
[1:40:34] imagine that you know that you know that
[1:40:37] you know that you can't
[1:40:40] lose if you truly knew you couldn't lose
[1:40:43] what confidence ought we to
[1:40:46] have if you had a battle you know they
[1:40:49] they have that that famous battle of the
[1:40:50] 300 Spartans that went up against the I
[1:40:53] don't know if it was a Persian king I
[1:40:56] think it
[1:40:57] was 300 and they stood in this this spot
[1:41:01] where it got real
[1:41:03] narrow and for days and days and days
[1:41:06] they fought hundreds of
[1:41:08] thousands and they believed they could
[1:41:10] never be defeated and they held and they
[1:41:13] held and they held until finally the
[1:41:16] enemy got up above them and behind them
[1:41:18] and that's the only thing that brought
[1:41:19] them down a traitor took them down but
[1:41:22] for days for weeks they held off an army
[1:41:25] that was thousands their size they
[1:41:29] didn't believe they could be beaten they
[1:41:30] were trained to believe that nobody
[1:41:32] could beat them and guess what when the
[1:41:35] Persians got through them they went in
[1:41:36] and an army of Spartans destroyed the
[1:41:38] entire Persian army outnumbered
[1:41:40] massively they didn't believe they could
[1:41:42] be
[1:41:44] beaten scripture says we've already
[1:41:47] overcome he overcame for us we're facing
[1:41:51] a defeated enemy that's trying to Bluff
[1:41:53] us out of the promises of God if we
[1:41:56] truly believe we can't be beaten we
[1:41:59] probably act a little differently when
[1:42:00] we go through trials when we go through
[1:42:02] situations when Satan comes knocking on
[1:42:04] our door
[1:42:07] Amen brother Braham says and when these
[1:42:09] wise men saw that word of God said a
[1:42:11] star would rise out of Jacob they
[1:42:12] followed that little god-given token to
[1:42:15] the source of eternal light so will wise
[1:42:17] men today who are not blinded by Creeds
[1:42:20] will follow the god-given spoken word
[1:42:24] till see there's a
[1:42:28] gap I remember when Brother David Nash
[1:42:30] was here and he he said pay attention to
[1:42:32] those little marks in your Bible those
[1:42:34] little commas and those semicolons
[1:42:36] because it means a period of time we're
[1:42:39] following a star we're following a
[1:42:42] god-given message for this hour aren't
[1:42:44] we he says follow it till that means
[1:42:47] there's a span of time between there's a
[1:42:49] journey remember what Paul said you did
[1:42:52] run well what did hinder
[1:42:54] thee don't let what's happening in the
[1:42:57] journey hinder you keep pressing forward
[1:43:00] don't let anything Sidetrack you don't
[1:43:02] let anything keep you from finishing he
[1:43:04] says they will follow the god-given
[1:43:05] spoken word until they see the fullness
[1:43:08] of the power of God blooming forth in
[1:43:11] this hour they see it they know that
[1:43:13] it's here in the scripture God promised
[1:43:16] it for this day that's what we're
[1:43:18] believing amen we're believing for the
[1:43:21] supernatural in every aspect of Our
[1:43:23] Lives you I was talking with a brother
[1:43:25] recently and we were talking about that
[1:43:26] third poll and brother Brown says it
[1:43:28] won't be a public
[1:43:31] show why because it's an individual
[1:43:33] Affair only one person at a time went
[1:43:35] into that little
[1:43:37] room and what happened there was a
[1:43:39] mystery even to the person that
[1:43:41] experienced it but they knew the effect
[1:43:45] they knew that something had happened
[1:43:47] that something had changed and that's
[1:43:50] what's going on on in little Believers
[1:43:51] lives little wives at home little
[1:43:54] husbands in in our humble jobs and
[1:43:57] humble places and these different things
[1:43:58] but yet the word of God is coming forth
[1:44:00] and it's doing a work a supernatural
[1:44:02] work to prepare a bride that's going to
[1:44:03] go out amen you I'm reminded of the
[1:44:06] Prophet Elijah on Mount Carmel and he
[1:44:08] had a showdown up there and he proved
[1:44:10] God as the real God before all the
[1:44:11] people he killed the 400 false prophets
[1:44:14] and he'd offered an atonement for Israel
[1:44:16] their sin was covered and they had
[1:44:17] returned back to worshiping God if you
[1:44:19] remember they've been in a time of
[1:44:21] drought for 3 and 1/2 years at his word
[1:44:23] at the prophet's word no rain had fallen
[1:44:25] no DW had come and for 3 and 1/2 years
[1:44:29] the rain had ceased and nothing was
[1:44:30] there and Israel was brought back into
[1:44:33] obedience to the word and so Elijah knew
[1:44:35] that he could speak the word and Rain
[1:44:36] would
[1:44:37] come but I want you to see something
[1:44:40] because we're speaking of Rejoice this
[1:44:42] morning and you know the wise men
[1:44:44] rejoice when they saw the star but
[1:44:46] you'll see here that as you come into
[1:44:48] maturity the rejoicing can start even
[1:44:50] even before you see something because
[1:44:53] when you take God at his word you can
[1:44:54] rejoice as if you already have what he's
[1:44:57] given that's what happens as you become
[1:44:59] more mature as you start to realize your
[1:45:01] position in Christ it can be expressed
[1:45:03] in your
[1:45:04] expectation that you can worship like
[1:45:06] brother Bram said if they give you money
[1:45:08] to buy a loaf of bread you can rejoice
[1:45:10] as if you have the loaf of bread and
[1:45:12] that's what the word is is it's the
[1:45:14] price paid all you have to do is go to
[1:45:16] the store and get the food as you mature
[1:45:19] you can rejoice as soon soon as you see
[1:45:21] it in the word as soon as he quickens it
[1:45:23] to you my sister Alanta you many of you
[1:45:25] have seen her testimony being healed
[1:45:28] from cancer but when that scripture
[1:45:30] struck her that by his stripes we are
[1:45:32] healed she rejoiced then because the
[1:45:36] word was Quicken to
[1:45:38] her and so as soon as she goes back to
[1:45:40] the doctors she has the proof of what
[1:45:43] she already knew because she had
[1:45:44] accepted the word and she rejoiced in
[1:45:46] the receiving of the word having not
[1:45:49] seen any results yet
[1:45:51] that's what we happens as we mature
[1:45:53] that's what happens as we're quick to
[1:45:54] the
[1:45:55] word listen now as we start to
[1:45:58] close said and Elijah said unto Ahab get
[1:46:01] thee up eat and drink for there is a
[1:46:03] sound of abundance of rain it hasn't
[1:46:06] rained in three and a half years Church
[1:46:08] Elijah hasn't even said a word yet he
[1:46:10] hasn't done a thing and yet he's telling
[1:46:12] the king he says I can hear the rain
[1:46:13] already and it ain't just a bit of rain
[1:46:15] it's a big rain it's an abundance of
[1:46:17] rain it's a rainstorm it's going to be a
[1:46:19] life-changing storm have the rain is
[1:46:21] coming dry as a bone nothing happening
[1:46:25] Clear Blue Skies hot as blazes and he
[1:46:27] says I hear the sound of abundance of
[1:46:30] rain everything's crying for rain
[1:46:33] conditions are ripe for rain because
[1:46:35] Israel has come back to God and Elijah
[1:46:37] says I can hear the abundance of rain
[1:46:39] nothing visible nothing
[1:46:42] changing but he says there's rain coming
[1:46:45] says so Ahab went up to eat and drink
[1:46:48] and Elijah went up to the top of caramel
[1:46:50] and he cast himself down upon the Earth
[1:46:52] and put his face between his knees so
[1:46:54] he's already said rain's coming and lots
[1:46:56] of it and now he goes and he prays to
[1:46:58] God for rain he's already declared it
[1:47:01] now he's going to go ask for it and then
[1:47:04] he said to his servant go up now look
[1:47:06] toward the sea and he went up and looked
[1:47:08] and he said there is
[1:47:12] nothing nothing the prophet of God
[1:47:14] remember God said there'll be no rain
[1:47:16] except by Thy word and now he gives the
[1:47:19] word he speaks the word and nothing
[1:47:23] happens I don't have the quote here I
[1:47:25] don't think but brother Braham says
[1:47:26] unbelief can catch that he says watch
[1:47:29] what unbelief would have done in that
[1:47:30] situation but Elijah is not an
[1:47:32] unbeliever he's a
[1:47:34] Believer he and he said go again seven
[1:47:36] times so six times Elijah says go check
[1:47:40] and tell me if something's coming and
[1:47:42] six times nothing
[1:47:45] happens six is the number of man you can
[1:47:48] do everything in your power
[1:47:51] and nothing will
[1:47:52] happen he says brother Bram
[1:47:55] says remember there's nothing wrong with
[1:47:58] the Elijah's Faith there's nothing wrong
[1:48:00] with this prayer there's nothing wrong
[1:48:01] with this condition there's nothing
[1:48:03] wrong brother Braham says this he says
[1:48:06] you know what's the matter with the
[1:48:07] churches today we give up too
[1:48:10] quick Elijah stayed there and he prayed
[1:48:14] and he prayed and he prayed until
[1:48:16] something happened you say Lord I
[1:48:18] shouldn't have to pray and pray and pray
[1:48:20] I'm going to pray the prayer of faith
[1:48:21] and it should happen no there is an
[1:48:23] enduring there's a persevering for the
[1:48:25] real believer that says I'll not let you
[1:48:29] go until you answer until you give me
[1:48:32] what I'm
[1:48:33] seeking he says if men and women in here
[1:48:35] who wants Christ or the Holy Ghost who
[1:48:37] want to be healed if they would just
[1:48:39] stay there and say Lord you promised it
[1:48:41] you promised it then feel that little
[1:48:46] trickle little
[1:48:49] Trickle not this thing that swoops over
[1:48:52] you always a little Trickle and say here
[1:48:55] it is Lord I accept it he says
[1:48:58] something's going to
[1:49:00] happen says and it came to pass at the
[1:49:03] seventh time that he said behold there
[1:49:05] ariseth a massive raincloud out of the
[1:49:09] sea no a little
[1:49:11] cloud like a man's
[1:49:17] hand like
[1:49:19] this a little cloud like this is coming
[1:49:21] out of the ocean
[1:49:24] Elijah barely worth talking
[1:49:27] about we've seen little moves
[1:49:30] before and nothing
[1:49:34] happened remember we're talking about
[1:49:36] the Journey Church we're talking about
[1:49:39] rejoicing in the journey we fac
[1:49:41] situations like this all the time we've
[1:49:42] done everything we need to do we've met
[1:49:44] every requirement of God we prayed the
[1:49:46] prayer of faith and now we're in prayer
[1:49:48] and we're looking and we're watching and
[1:49:50] sometimes it's just
[1:49:51] us we don't know what everyone's praying
[1:49:53] in their little closet in the little
[1:49:56] things that you talk to the Lord about
[1:49:57] it's just us looking and we're believing
[1:50:00] because we're called to believe but does
[1:50:02] it always happen in just one moment
[1:50:05] no sometimes things have to Tumble Bit
[1:50:08] by Bit by Bit remember brother BR
[1:50:11] talking about speak to the mountain he
[1:50:13] says sometimes it might just be a little
[1:50:15] grain of sand that moved and you don't
[1:50:16] see it but it's still moved and it's God
[1:50:19] working on the situation
[1:50:21] amen what is it many times there's a
[1:50:23] delay many times it's something small
[1:50:26] that turns into something big and our
[1:50:28] response is what's so key here our
[1:50:30] attitude the way that we respond to
[1:50:32] what's happening Brother Bram says watch
[1:50:34] Elijah get the rain barrels out I hear
[1:50:37] the sound of abundance of rain he says
[1:50:39] the first little move he says Glory the
[1:50:42] first little move at the pool of
[1:50:44] Bethesda they rushed to get to it amen
[1:50:47] oh if the people here if you haven't
[1:50:48] received the Holy Ghost this morning
[1:50:50] morning if that first Little Tinker
[1:50:51] would say that's the truth that man is
[1:50:54] telling the word that's the truth then
[1:50:55] hurry as quick as you can don't wait
[1:50:58] what are you looking at what are you
[1:50:59] waiting for the hour is later than you
[1:51:01] think get moving towards it as fast as
[1:51:04] you can why he says when Elijah saw that
[1:51:08] move that little Cloud the size of a
[1:51:11] man's hand he says it was the evidence
[1:51:14] of an answered
[1:51:16] prayer there's no rainf falling there's
[1:51:19] no ch really there's just a tiny little
[1:51:22] thing that's happened that didn't happen
[1:51:23] six times before he said it was evidence
[1:51:26] of an answered prayer you say that's
[1:51:28] that's a cloud the size of a man's hand
[1:51:31] that's not an answer brother John it's
[1:51:33] an answer if you've got the right
[1:51:35] attitude it's an answer if you're a
[1:51:38] Believer it's not an
[1:51:41] answer if you're a hot house
[1:51:45] plant says and it came to pass at the
[1:51:48] seventh time that he said said behold
[1:51:50] there ariseth a little Cloud out of the
[1:51:52] sea like a man's hand and he said go up
[1:51:54] and say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot
[1:51:57] and get thee down that the rain stop
[1:51:58] thee
[1:51:59] not C capture the the
[1:52:03] ludicrous elements of this
[1:52:05] statement a cloud this big is going to
[1:52:09] stop ahab's
[1:52:10] Chariot there's going to be so much rain
[1:52:12] come out of a little cloud like this
[1:52:15] that ahab's got to get moving now
[1:52:16] otherwise he's going to get stuck and
[1:52:17] he's not going to make it off the off
[1:52:19] the mountain
[1:52:20] silliness Elijah's
[1:52:24] crazy it says and it came to pass in the
[1:52:28] meanwhile little space of time that the
[1:52:32] heaven was black with clouds and wind
[1:52:34] and there was a great rain and Abraham
[1:52:37] Ro and Ahab rode and went to Jezreel and
[1:52:40] the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and
[1:52:43] he gted up his loins and ran before Ahab
[1:52:45] to the entrance of jezrael I don't have
[1:52:47] to quote here for the sake of time but
[1:52:48] brother Bram says that that that uh
[1:52:51] Elijah got rejuvenated under that rign
[1:52:55] it made him young again and he outran
[1:52:57] the king's horses and
[1:53:00] chariots that's what happens when you
[1:53:02] can Rejoice before you see the
[1:53:05] reality he says the sign of the hand in
[1:53:08] the sky Elijah said that cloud the size
[1:53:11] of a man's hand like a vapor what was it
[1:53:13] catch his church he kept
[1:53:17] believing he was believing he saw that
[1:53:20] and it didn't diminish his faith it
[1:53:22] expanded it he kept believing I hear the
[1:53:25] sound of abundance of rain that cloud
[1:53:27] become two clouds two clouds become a
[1:53:29] hill a hill become a mountain the
[1:53:31] mountain become Another Mountain the
[1:53:32] first thing you know the whole skies
[1:53:34] were thundering and rain was falling
[1:53:36] what was it he accepted what God
[1:53:40] sent Church the answer is the answer God
[1:53:44] is God whatever he sends is the answer
[1:53:47] we
[1:53:47] need so often we can sit sit there and
[1:53:50] we can say this isn't what I wanted this
[1:53:52] isn't what I expected church either
[1:53:54] you're a son or daughter of God or
[1:53:55] you're not and if you are then you're
[1:53:57] led by the spirit of God and so his
[1:53:59] answer his provision whatever it is is
[1:54:02] his answer for your prayer to your
[1:54:04] situation and you've got to keep
[1:54:06] believing that it'll produce exactly
[1:54:08] what you've been asking for amen we've
[1:54:11] already seen the Star Church we've seen
[1:54:13] the the the this the the angel messenger
[1:54:16] of Revelation 1 and Revelation 3 and
[1:54:18] Revelation 10 and we can Rejoice at that
[1:54:21] but that's a sign that's already moved
[1:54:24] on the Stars
[1:54:26] disappeared it hovered and it led us to
[1:54:29] Christ cuz remember the prophet's not
[1:54:32] the not the end result it's just part of
[1:54:34] the journey the end of it is Christ
[1:54:38] remember like like Eleazar leading
[1:54:41] Rebecca to Isaac it was just part of the
[1:54:44] journey but then when she got there only
[1:54:46] Isaac was in the
[1:54:47] tent right there was a changing of the
[1:54:49] guard there was a changing of the light
[1:54:51] and now we're in his presence we're in
[1:54:52] the shikina glory amen and that's where
[1:54:54] the supernatural truly happens in our
[1:54:56] lives not in the presence of a prophet
[1:54:58] in the presence of the son of man in the
[1:55:00] presence of the Holy Spirit itself amen
[1:55:04] there's a second book of Acts that's
[1:55:05] being
[1:55:06] written and then there's a scripture
[1:55:08] says the people will know their God and
[1:55:10] do
[1:55:11] exploits that's where we're
[1:55:14] at the only thing ahead for us is a
[1:55:16] resurrection and a Rapture that's all
[1:55:18] the prophet said he says a student of
[1:55:20] the scripture the only thing I see is a
[1:55:22] Rapture that's what we're getting ready
[1:55:24] for that's what we're focused on Amen
[1:55:27] and if you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:55:30] you can rejoice in the journey that
[1:55:31] we're on that when you don't see it all
[1:55:34] happening right now you can Rejoice
[1:55:35] because he's promised it because you've
[1:55:37] received a word you've accepted a word
[1:55:39] that said that you are his child and
[1:55:41] that he's going to dwell with you he's
[1:55:43] going to be with you and the same works
[1:55:45] that he did he's doing in your life not
[1:55:47] all of it right now but he's always
[1:55:50] working he's always leading he's always
[1:55:52] drawing he's always filling always
[1:55:55] pushing out amen let's stand together as
[1:55:58] we read this last quote brother Braham
[1:56:00] said oh brothers and sisters be
[1:56:03] encouraged then he says straighten up
[1:56:06] now this is just
[1:56:07] me I don't think he means straighten up
[1:56:09] like get your house in order he's saying
[1:56:11] lift up lift your heads up straighten
[1:56:14] your backs up don't get bowed down don't
[1:56:16] get don't get wearied don't get worried
[1:56:20] straighten up things are moving he says
[1:56:23] we're nearing something you'll hear the
[1:56:25] sound of abundance of rain for one of
[1:56:28] these days the curtains will be draw
[1:56:30] back from the heavens and God will pour
[1:56:32] out his Spirit without measure among
[1:56:34] that group of people that's fought to
[1:56:36] win the prize and sail through bloody
[1:56:38] Seas he says and what a meeting we'll
[1:56:42] have you can look back on your life and
[1:56:44] you know at the end of the year and you
[1:56:47] look back at what's happened and
[1:56:50] hasn't been easy all the time this
[1:56:52] year we haven't all had beds of ease and
[1:56:56] these different things some harder than
[1:56:58] others some easier than
[1:57:01] others but you know we can look back and
[1:57:03] we can say God's Grace has been with us
[1:57:05] through it all amen that his healing has
[1:57:07] been here his presence has been here his
[1:57:09] guidance has been here his discernments
[1:57:11] been here his Provisions been
[1:57:14] here and we ought to be able to rejoice
[1:57:16] in what he's
[1:57:17] done recogniz what he's doing and be in
[1:57:21] expectation for what he's going to do
[1:57:24] amen amen I'm looking for a resurrection
[1:57:26] and Rapture there's nothing left church
[1:57:29] and we see what's happening remember
[1:57:30] brother Braham said Israel is God's time
[1:57:32] clock there's only one nation holding
[1:57:34] back the wrath of this world from Israel
[1:57:35] right now that's the United States and
[1:57:38] they're slowly backing
[1:57:40] away it could be gone tomorrow and when
[1:57:43] the World Turns against Israel we know
[1:57:44] that Armageddon is not far away that's
[1:57:47] where we're at brother Braham says it's
[1:57:49] closer than you think amen but in all of
[1:57:53] that he said when you see these things
[1:57:55] look up cuz you're Redemption is I amen
[1:57:59] the worse it gets the more we ought to
[1:58:01] Rejoice the more we see things falling
[1:58:03] apart the more we see things breaking up
[1:58:06] the the more ridiculous the more insane
[1:58:08] this world gets we ought to be in a in
[1:58:10] an attitude and a spirit of rejoicing
[1:58:12] because it means we're that much closer
[1:58:14] to a body change and then that Nan I'm
[1:58:18] I'm convinced that Nan is going to be
[1:58:19] the one sister coffe is going to be the
[1:58:21] one that knocks on my door one
[1:58:24] morning whoever that loved one is that's
[1:58:27] gone
[1:58:30] on but I don't want to wait till then to
[1:58:33] Rejoice I don't want to wait till then
[1:58:35] to have joy in the Holy
[1:58:37] Ghost and man I don't believe we're
[1:58:39] meant to suffer through all this I don't
[1:58:42] believe we're meant to be down in the
[1:58:44] mouth overworked
[1:58:47] overstressed I don't believe that
[1:58:50] that I believe there's a place of
[1:58:52] rejoicing where we can rest in knowing
[1:58:55] that he does all things well he's got
[1:58:58] our lives in his hands he won't lose a
[1:59:00] one of us you look around and you say
[1:59:03] like Israel it's been dry for three and
[1:59:05] a half
[1:59:06] years whether it's loved ones that
[1:59:08] haven't come to the Lord ones that have
[1:59:09] left the Lord and it seems things are
[1:59:12] devolving rather than evolving towards
[1:59:13] what they should be say Lord I
[1:59:16] believe and I'm going to Rejoice at
[1:59:18] every little thing that I see that
[1:59:21] points to your word being
[1:59:23] fulfilled that my prayers have been
[1:59:25] answered like Daniel Daniel waited three
[1:59:28] weeks remember what the angel said he
[1:59:30] heard you the first time but I was
[1:59:33] delayed because of the battle amen don't
[1:59:36] let the delay stop the rejoicing amen
[1:59:39] have faith in who you are have faith in
[1:59:41] what he's called you to be and trust
[1:59:42] that the answers on the way amen God
[1:59:45] bless you let's bow our
[1:59:47] heads Lord God
[1:59:50] Lord how thankful we are that we have a
[1:59:52] light that's
[1:59:53] leading lord it's definitely not me it's
[1:59:57] not a man Lord but it's your divine
[2:00:00] presence through your quickening word
[2:00:02] Lord that's drawing us up into a
[2:00:04] resurrection and a Rapture Lord and it's
[2:00:06] causing us to leave the things of this
[2:00:08] World Behind Lord It's cutting those
[2:00:10] strings lord it's removing those little
[2:00:12] things that so easily beset
[2:00:14] us Lord and you're pulling us through
[2:00:16] and your lord your your fire is burning
[2:00:19] out those dross and impurities Lord It's
[2:00:21] purifying us Lord help us to rejoice in
[2:00:24] those moments Lord for when we look
[2:00:26] around there's not many going through a
[2:00:27] purifying process but Lord you're
[2:00:29] calling us to a higher Place Lord you're
[2:00:32] calling us to give you're calling us to
[2:00:35] rest you're calling us to trust you're
[2:00:37] calling us to believe that you do all
[2:00:39] things well Lord God lord you see each
[2:00:42] heart and each life that's
[2:00:44] here Lord you see the hardships we Face
[2:00:47] the trials the
[2:00:50] sickness Lord you see
[2:00:52] everything Lord help us to rejoice in
