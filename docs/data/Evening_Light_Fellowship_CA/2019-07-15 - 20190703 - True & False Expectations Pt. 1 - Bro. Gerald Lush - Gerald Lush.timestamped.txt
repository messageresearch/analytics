[44:55] what we want to give it we got to give
[44:58] him all amen whether he want or not not
[45:01] my real father
[45:02] thine be done Amen so the grace of God
[45:05] be with us as we go into these words and
[45:08] the Lord blesses and we thank the Lord
[45:10] for our brother la Fontaine's visit with
[45:13] us we thank the Lord for our brothers
[45:16] fellowship and also the going forth of
[45:18] the word a man and as all some of you
[45:22] have already confided in me to say that
[45:26] it was good because it was a
[45:27] confirmation of what brother Joel was
[45:29] already preaching a man and it and it
[45:32] was and we thank the Lord for the way
[45:34] that he brought it out through our
[45:36] brother LaFontaine a man we pray God's
[45:39] grace be with him and he had to get back
[45:42] because he had a missionary apparently
[45:45] come to his church on Monday so and he
[45:50] was thinking about changing his flight
[45:51] from Tuesday to Monday but he just left
[45:54] it at Tuesday so we pray the grace of
[45:57] God bless him and whatever they had
[45:59] planned a man with the missionary and
[46:01] also I heard a prayer request for
[46:04] Buzzard brother Barry okay he had some
[46:10] biopsy okay the grace of God be with our
[46:13] brother bury a man and also to remember
[46:16] in prayer brother Eugene young in
[46:19] beachside apparently his father we trust
[46:23] went to be with the Lord
[46:24] on Sunday he I believe he turned 92
[46:28] years old on Saturday and any and he
[46:32] left his body on on Sunday at 92 years
[46:36] old and I understand that he's going to
[46:39] be buried at the Pentecostal church in
[46:42] Springdale so and we pray grace of God
[46:46] to our brother Eugene and his family a
[46:49] man
[46:50] so the it's it's a loss even though he's
[46:52] 92 years old it's still something that
[46:55] they're going to miss and apparently I
[46:57] believe that he did live in beachside
[46:59] where our brother Eugene lives and and
[47:02] maybe I not Norton alike and I sure be
[47:05] died there or in the hospital in
[47:07] Springdale so God's grace to the family
[47:10] and I pray encourage their faith a man
[47:14] in the resurrection a man their faith in
[47:18] the coming of the Lord and the dead in
[47:20] Christ shall rise first a man that's the
[47:23] scripture that's the promise so I pray
[47:26] God's grace to encourage us to believe
[47:29] with all of our hearts and got God knows
[47:32] and again brother sister we're wearing
[47:34] that hour we're in that time you know of
[47:37] the end and I'd be honest there's
[47:40] nothing else left we've got to that that
[47:42] that climax which I'll touch on tonight
[47:46] concerning the resurrection of rapture
[47:48] because according to the prophecy of
[47:50] this book there's nothing else left
[47:52] because this quarter the prophecy of
[47:54] this book when this happened and this
[47:57] happens that this happens then what are
[47:59] we looking for the coming of the Lord
[48:01] the resurrection the rapture and there's
[48:04] nothing else left to happen so we pray
[48:07] the grace of God that we're going to
[48:09] have a resurrection and rapturing faith
[48:12] oh brother it's a challenge to us now
[48:15] and no wonder when we consider how many
[48:17] are getting caught up with the natural
[48:19] things of life and they got more faith
[48:22] in the natural more faith in politics
[48:24] more faith in in what's going on in the
[48:26] world naturally than they do in Christ
[48:28] than to do in God that's the truth
[48:30] oh I pray Greece we're going to have
[48:32] faith that pleases God amen because he
[48:37] said when he comes will he find faith on
[48:39] the earth
[48:40] amen and again I agree with our brother
[48:43] that Scofield and he translated that
[48:47] faith he said is a belief in the whole
[48:51] body of revealed truth amen
[48:54] what God because at the end God is the
[48:57] whole thing is revealed that God has
[48:59] revealed little by little by little a
[49:01] many real
[49:02] little to it to able in outside the
[49:05] Garden of Eden and then he revealed so
[49:07] look what he revealed to Enoch and then
[49:09] he then he revealed some more to it to
[49:11] Noah and then to the prophets then
[49:13] Christ a man the Alpha a man the
[49:17] resurrection and rapture now brothers
[49:19] the Omega resurrection rapture he's
[49:21] revealed Paul all the messengers down
[49:23] through the church ages to finally it's
[49:25] all finished a man there's nothing else
[49:28] to do nothing else to reveal a man now
[49:31] he's looking for the faith a man for the
[49:33] resurrection and the rapture the grace
[49:36] of God to his brother amen brother and I
[49:39] pray that we are numbered with the wise
[49:42] virgins a man not the foolish but the
[49:45] wise and that we have the oil that we
[49:48] need to get in to the marriage supper of

[1:00:45] concerning another another phase or what
[1:00:48] God has done
[1:00:49] but it's what God is doing a man they
[1:00:52] saved us said the Lord on what God is
[1:00:55] doing
[1:00:56] Amen so again we're not living in the
[1:00:58] past we're living in the present tense
[1:01:00] as our brother brought out and it was a
[1:01:03] tremendous quote that were going from
[1:01:05] the from the Prophet to the prophecy a
[1:01:07] man and we're going from the messenger
[1:01:10] to the message that's the absolute truth
[1:01:12] we thank the Lord for bringing those
[1:01:14] things out through our brothers ministry
[1:01:16] and a confirmation again of a number of
[1:01:19] things that you have already heard us
[1:01:21] preach here in this this assembly a man
[1:01:24] a man brother and if we're bright we're
[1:01:26] going to be pretty treat preaching the
[1:01:28] same thing if we're bright we're going
[1:01:30] to be looking for the same thing if
[1:01:31] we're bright we're going to be hungry no
[1:01:33] thirsty for the same thing by the grace
[1:01:36] of God absolutely
[1:01:37] a mayor we're not going to be living in
[1:01:39] the past we're living in the present and
[1:01:42] what our brother brought out is true and
[1:01:44] we have emphasized it there are those
[1:01:47] there that are that are still preaching
[1:01:49] God has sent a prophet God has sent a
[1:01:50] prophet no that's that's true that's
[1:01:54] past tense but that's not the faith that
[1:01:56] he's looking for now if we were going to
[1:01:58] have that faith but we got had the faith
[1:02:00] of the prophesy we got out of the
[1:02:03] the message a man so that there was a
[1:02:06] profit but what why there was a
[1:02:09] messenger but why so what what was the
[1:02:12] message that he left what was the
[1:02:14] prophecy that he put the emphasis on a
[1:02:16] man so it's not another prophecy of
[1:02:19] Malachi 4 that the old I send you Elijah
[1:02:21] the Prophet before the coming of the
[1:02:23] Great dreadful day of the Lord is not
[1:02:25] just saying what I believe that I
[1:02:26] believe that yeah we did but it's past
[1:02:30] tense and we believe that God has done
[1:02:32] it and it is past tense but what about
[1:02:36] the message of the Prophet so what if
[1:02:38] what did the what did the messenger
[1:02:40] leave when God took him off the sea so
[1:02:43] what do we have now because he's not
[1:02:45] here and like when our brother brought
[1:02:47] in in Isaiah and Isaiah and Moe and you
[1:02:51] know the Moses died and so on or the
[1:02:54] prophecy there and and the Prophet died
[1:02:56] but what was the message
[1:02:59] where's there anyone with the faith that
[1:03:01] please God a man as a result of God
[1:03:05] taking Moses on the scene and there was
[1:03:07] a reason he took Moses off the seat and
[1:03:09] he said Moses because you have done this
[1:03:12] I'm gonna take you off the scene and
[1:03:13] he's Hugo you're gonna come home with it
[1:03:15] with the Lord anybody asked Moses to go
[1:03:18] and anoint and pray for Joshua a man and
[1:03:21] turn everything over to Joshua and he
[1:03:23] was going to lead them into the Promised
[1:03:25] Land by the grace of God em and Caleb a
[1:03:29] man so as I said our brother Paul might
[1:03:33] have been Joshua and I we got on Caleb
[1:03:36] so we but we're going into the Promised
[1:03:38] Land a man is not just stating under the
[1:03:41] Prophet that brought us out we got to
[1:03:43] get under the ministry as taking us in a
[1:03:45] man we got to get under Minister it's
[1:03:47] going to build us up in the most holy
[1:03:48] faith a man and it is not not just faith
[1:03:51] to say I believe God sent a prophet is
[1:03:54] the faith that is going to believe what
[1:03:56] the Prophet left us a man the message
[1:03:59] that he left us near structures and he
[1:04:01] left us to go in and possess the land a
[1:04:04] man and brother a and then Moses prayed
[1:04:08] for Joshua and Caleb and the bottom of
[1:04:10] God he was praying for the for the
[1:04:12] younger ministry in his day he was
[1:04:14] praying for the faithful ministry and is
[1:04:16] because they were ordained to take the
[1:04:18] people on to the resurrection and the
[1:04:21] rapture a man and in and he did and he
[1:04:24] did say that and as I said I I don't
[1:04:27] recall the the the message that he said
[1:04:30] it ain't right now but I do have it
[1:04:33] underlined and marked in that message
[1:04:35] and if you ever got the message it'll be
[1:04:37] on the right side at the top a man and
[1:04:40] it's just before it just before he went
[1:04:42] in and read the scripture for the
[1:04:45] message he was going to preach and he
[1:04:47] said now it's for you young young
[1:04:48] brothers he said God has ordained you to
[1:04:51] take this message on to the coming of
[1:04:53] the Lord a man on to the resurrection
[1:04:56] onto the rapture because he knew that he
[1:04:59] wasn't going to be here now he wanted to
[1:05:02] be but he left that with God not not
[1:05:04] Israel but the will of God and the Lord
[1:05:07] took him and brother it says to put our
[1:05:09] faith in what God wants us to do amen
[1:05:13] not what he has done not not signs and
[1:05:16] wonders and our brother brought that out
[1:05:17] and has the absolute truth there are
[1:05:19] those that are looking for signs and
[1:05:21] wonders or looking for a return ministry
[1:05:23] of the prophet of God
[1:05:25] no the return ministry brother we're in
[1:05:27] it we're in the tenth vision
[1:05:28] amen amen were all dead that's already
[1:05:31] been in the process and brother the
[1:05:34] Prophet is not coming back we will see
[1:05:37] him again at the time of the
[1:05:39] resurrection and the rapture we're going
[1:05:41] to see him a man and brother I tell you
[1:05:44] I pray God that we're going to be in the
[1:05:45] spirit sure we're not going to miss what
[1:05:47] God is doing but then we got to be in
[1:05:50] the sphere we got to be led by the
[1:05:51] spirit and we got to get out of our
[1:05:53] heads and into our hearts amen so what
[1:05:56] we believe is out of our hearts what we
[1:05:58] believe is in our hearts by the grace of
[1:06:00] God because what the problem of God said
[1:06:02] is going to happen how it's going to
[1:06:04] happen but we got to live in the spirit
[1:06:06] I'll tear this we got to walk in the
[1:06:08] spirit for us to recognize the
[1:06:11] Resurrection when it's taking place for
[1:06:13] us to recognize the rapture winning
[1:06:14] winning when it takes effect in our
[1:06:16] lives and in our hearts where the grace
[1:06:19] of God we got to live in the spirit walk
[1:06:21] in the spirit because of the way that
[1:06:23] the problem of God said it's going to
[1:06:25] take place and it's going to happen but
[1:06:27] we got to get out of the
[1:06:28] the natural thing you think what we're
[1:06:30] going to see with our natural eyes no no
[1:06:32] no it's not what you see with the
[1:06:34] natural eyes is what you're seeing in
[1:06:36] your heart is what you're seeing in your
[1:06:38] soul maybe what you're seeing with your
[1:06:40] spiritual eyes a man where if we're just
[1:06:43] looking at it through the natural we're
[1:06:44] going to miss the rapture we're going to
[1:06:46] miss the resurrection we got it we got
[1:06:48] to get in the spirit we got to be in the
[1:06:50] spirit we got we got all my recognize
[1:06:53] God is in his birdie or God is in his
[1:06:56] word there God is doing this God is
[1:06:58] doing that amen so I pray that we're not
[1:07:00] going to miss the resurrection I pray
[1:07:02] they will not miss the rapture because
[1:07:04] we live in the spirit and we'll walk in
[1:07:07] the spirit so that we're going to
[1:07:08] recognize what God is doing in the
[1:07:10] spirit amen
[1:07:12] or whether the resurrection is going to
[1:07:13] be real it is going to be real but again
[1:07:16] it's going to be a vindication of your
[1:07:18] faith a man we're gonna see it where I
[1:07:21] can recognize what God is doing and no
[1:07:23] one is happening by our faith Amen we're
[1:07:26] gonna identify with this identify with
[1:07:28] that oh praise the Lord
[1:07:29] Alleluia amen but then when we go the
[1:07:32] world's not the world after a while
[1:07:34] they'll miss us amen after a while there
[1:07:37] missus amen misunderstand how the
[1:07:40] rapture is going to take place when the
[1:07:42] rapture is going to take place you know
[1:07:44] we will know all about it but again the
[1:07:47] world the world that was conscious of
[1:07:49] our our physical beings they won't do it
[1:07:51] they won't know we're gone Don't Tell
[1:07:53] after a while they'll wonder where is
[1:07:55] this person where's that person a man so
[1:07:59] I pray God we're gonna be in the spirit
[1:08:01] so that we're going to be a part of that
[1:08:03] resurrection part of that rapture we
[1:08:05] even right now that we that we'd be able
[1:08:07] to identify that we're a part of the
[1:08:08] resurrection we're part of the rapture
[1:08:10] we're going at a time we're going to
[1:08:12] Eternity amen
[1:08:14] we're getting out of these old bodies of
[1:08:15] flesh into glorified bodies
[1:08:17] amen brother if we're really ordained
[1:08:20] and predestinated for the rapture we're
[1:08:23] going to be changed consequently

[1:08:43] the world and so on the way we're living
[1:08:45] and and the way we talk and so on but
[1:08:47] again we're going to be conscious that
[1:08:49] something is going on in another
[1:08:50] dimension yeah hey remember that they're
[1:08:55] waiting on us the daddy Christ amen amen
[1:09:00] what for to get more and more in faith

[1:09:47] brother Minister on expectation what is
[1:09:49] your expectation what are you expecting
[1:09:51] de indias the grace of gods that were
[1:09:56] expecting not like Pentecost signs and
[1:09:58] wonders no no the angel told the prophet
[1:10:00] of God stop using those signs and
[1:10:02] wonders it's because the people are
[1:10:04] leaning on a signpost hey man we got to
[1:10:07] move on it's like I said you see the
[1:10:09] sign out there you're so far from st.
[1:10:11] John's you're not gonna stop at the post
[1:10:13] no you're gonna go on to the next one
[1:10:15] you got to keep on going we're getting
[1:10:18] closer we're getting closer
[1:10:19] amen so we've seen this sign this sign
[1:10:21] this sign don't stop there don't focus
[1:10:23] on it don't dwell on it
[1:10:25] amen we were by the grace of God not to
[1:10:28] me that's what God is looking for he's
[1:10:30] looking for the bride that's moving on
[1:10:32] any man in the spirit amen by the Word
[1:10:35] of God it's the old butter toe but a
[1:10:38] mystery
[1:10:38] it's Christ in us the hope of glory it
[1:10:41] is a mystery hey man so I trust you're
[1:10:44] living in the spirit and you're walking
[1:10:46] in the spirit and the more you live in
[1:10:48] it the more you walk in it the more
[1:10:49] conscious you become a of Christ of the
[1:10:52] resurrection the rapture and the dating
[1:10:54] Christ
[1:10:55] amen by the grace of God they come to us
[1:10:59] we're going to them by the grace of God
[1:11:03] but it's gonna be by faith gonna have
[1:11:05] that faith that revelation God Elvis
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:09] grace in Chapter eight of Romans our
[1:11:15] brother read these scriptures verse 14
[1:11:18] for as many as are led by the Spirit of
[1:11:23] God they are the sons of God and if
[1:11:28] you're not led by the Spirit you're not
[1:11:30] a son or daughter of God for as many as
[1:11:34] are led by the Spirit of God make sure
[1:11:38] it's the Spirit of God not the spirit of
[1:11:39] the devil and it says they are the sons
[1:11:42] of God for ye have not received the
[1:11:45] spirit of bondage again to fear now but
[1:11:51] ye have received the spirit of adoption
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:55] and I'm going to share with you another
[1:11:57] thought of the Prophet concerning
[1:12:00] adoption and not only adoption but
[1:12:03] adoption and the rapture so we have
[1:12:08] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:12:10] we cry Abba Father the spirit itself
[1:12:15] bears witness with our spirit that we
[1:12:17] are the children of God amen and if
[1:12:22] children then heirs and heirs of God and
[1:12:24] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:12:28] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:12:32] glorified together amen
[1:12:35] to suffer with him the glory be
[1:12:38] glorified together with him amen and
[1:12:42] again verse 18 for I reckon that the
[1:12:45] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:12:47] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:12:50] which shall be revealed in us amen I
[1:12:54] trust we have that faith we're looking
[1:12:57] for we're looking for the promise of God
[1:12:59] in the world that He has promised where
[1:13:01] is a lack that he has promised where is
[1:13:03] bride a man brother sister then so that
[1:13:06] is not
[1:13:07] dream world is not fairytales but it is
[1:13:10] thus saith the Lord and brother it
[1:13:12] becomes more real to us than a dream
[1:13:14] becomes more real to us than fairytales
[1:13:18] amen brother I pray that we have their
[1:13:21] faith the prophet of God say he said
[1:13:23] what your favor of the else is more real
[1:13:25] than what your sight sees a man I trust
[1:13:29] the resurrection the rapture is more
[1:13:31] than real than the seat you're standing
[1:13:32] by and all the seats that you'll sit in
[1:13:34] or it comes to the Ministry of the word
[1:13:37] that's going forth naturally I pray that
[1:13:40] the revelation is more real than the
[1:13:42] natural a man that we are catching the
[1:13:45] revelation we're catching the spiritual
[1:13:47] for a revelation that God has ordained
[1:13:49] for us to see and what God wants us to
[1:13:52] hear a man now the mechanics of the word
[1:13:55] but the dynamics of the word amen for I
[1:13:59] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:14:01] present time are not worthy to be
[1:14:04] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:14:06] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:14:10] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:14:13] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:14:16] amen
[1:14:18] for the creature was made subject of
[1:14:20] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:14:25] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] it is the Blessed hope amen because the
[1:14:35] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:14:38] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:14:41] glorious liberty of the children of God
[1:14:43] for we know that that the whole creation
[1:14:47] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[1:14:50] under now and not only they but
[1:14:54] ourselves also which have the
[1:14:58] firstfruits of the Spirit amen
[1:15:01] the firstfruits and again our brother
[1:15:04] highlighted what is the first fruit it
[1:15:06] is the downpayment I got the downpayment
[1:15:09] of redemption I got the downpayment of
[1:15:11] the resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:15:14] in my heart and in my soul bear with me
[1:15:17] as let me repeated again
[1:15:19] as that is written in the word you and
[1:15:21] the quicken you have they made alive you
[1:15:23] as he resurrected who were dead in sins
[1:15:26] and trespasses
[1:15:28] so I've I got the down payment of the
[1:15:30] resurrection amen and I got the down
[1:15:32] payment of the rapture because he has
[1:15:34] quickened us and we have been raised up
[1:15:36] into heavenly places in Christ where the
[1:15:39] word is revealed a man so I've been I've
[1:15:42] been quickened into the resurrection
[1:15:44] I've been quickened into the rapture
[1:15:46] by the grace of God a man if spiritually
[1:15:49] I've been caught up spiritually I've
[1:15:51] been raptured spiritually into heavenly
[1:15:53] places in Christ amen but the naturally
[1:15:56] I'm believing for the natural
[1:15:57] resurrection and the natural strand a
[1:16:00] physical rapture of our bodies by the
[1:16:02] grace of God this is tremendous amen
[1:16:05] so I had been and I will be a man and
[1:16:09] just think J and we had been brother in
[1:16:12] this day in this hour is not believing
[1:16:15] that we're going to die and then we're
[1:16:17] going to be resurrected we're going to
[1:16:18] die then we're gonna be raptured no no
[1:16:20] we're gonna we're going to experience
[1:16:22] resurrection and rapture without dying
[1:16:24] physically I got the resurrection in me
[1:16:27] now I got the rapture in me now amen
[1:16:30] so God has raised this generation in
[1:16:32] this age amen to bridge to manifest the
[1:16:35] resurrection literally amen
[1:16:38] we're not going to go over here just
[1:16:40] wait for the Lord do this no the Lord
[1:16:42] has come a man instead
[1:16:45] and he's fleshing us to bring forth the
[1:16:47] natural and the physical resurrection
[1:16:49] and the rapture a man and that's what
[1:16:52] those dead in Christ are waiting on
[1:16:54] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:56] hallelujah for we know that the whole
[1:16:59] creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
[1:17:02] together until now and not only they but
[1:17:04] ourselves also which have the
[1:17:07] firstfruits of the Spirit to down
[1:17:09] payment even we ourselves
[1:17:12] he's a groan within ourselves waiting
[1:17:15] for the adoption to wit or to know the
[1:17:19] redemption of our body
[1:17:21] god bless his words you may be seated
[1:17:26] we are in the cycle bear with me for a
[1:17:30] little I'll try not to be too long
[1:17:32] and I try not to think as long as our
[1:17:34] brother the Fontaine took a man but I
[1:17:40] know I have but I'll try we'll see but
[1:17:44] we are in the cycle of the seventh seal
[1:17:48] amen we're in the para redemption brings
[1:17:52] us to the climax of redemption
[1:17:55] Amen that's where this is where God has
[1:17:58] brought us and this is why he sent the
[1:18:01] prophet this is why he opened the seven
[1:18:03] seals because we're what was what was
[1:18:06] the need of the hour the need of the
[1:18:08] hour is resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:18:10] so why God does God God will do what he
[1:18:15] wants to do and he'll reveal what he
[1:18:16] wants to reveal but for to give us the
[1:18:19] faith that pleases him in this day and
[1:18:21] it's our goddamn through the agency
[1:18:24] revealed err what would give the people
[1:18:26] the faith that would please God in the
[1:18:28] first age right on down to the to this
[1:18:30] last stage brother even if evident of
[1:18:33] the Pentecostal eggs allowed to CH God
[1:18:35] revealed and God did what what would
[1:18:38] give the the Saints to see the seed of
[1:18:41] God the faith that would please them in
[1:18:43] their day and in their hour a man that
[1:18:46] God wasn't looking for this faith back
[1:18:48] here God wasn't looking for this faith
[1:18:50] not even back here and he wasn't looking
[1:18:52] to differ for even Luther's faith back
[1:18:55] here no no but he because the enemy we
[1:18:59] know the enemy got in and and he took at
[1:19:01] all and and he brought in this he
[1:19:03] brought in that so that people began to
[1:19:05] move away from pain and to begin into a
[1:19:08] Creed and a doctrine and denomination a
[1:19:10] man a man so it wasn't it wasn't faith
[1:19:14] that they were walking in faith or
[1:19:16] living in faith not by any means so the
[1:19:19] total darkness became into the church
[1:19:21] but God promised that he was gracious
[1:19:23] and I will restore said the Lord now
[1:19:26] understand that God permits all of this
[1:19:28] for a reason
[1:19:29] hey man it is not just God letting the
[1:19:32] devil do this letting the devil do that
[1:19:34] you know and when the devil doesn't he
[1:19:36] gets the victory over God no no he don't
[1:19:38] get no victory over God a man God
[1:19:40] permits him to do it because all power
[1:19:43] in heaven and earth is in the Lord and
[1:19:45] he's got power over the devil a man and
[1:19:48] so what it was the devil did in the
[1:19:50] first age God had allowed him to do it
[1:19:52] when he came in and began to sow the
[1:19:54] seeds of the creeds and doctrines and
[1:19:58] denominational Creed's a man so got it
[1:20:01] out of the soul the seed got it out of
[1:20:02] the water the seed a man and it was to
[1:20:05] bring out the faith of his elect it is
[1:20:07] to bring of the faith of the seed of God
[1:20:09] in those ages a man
[1:20:11] it was serpent seed and the seed of God
[1:20:13] a man brother thank God we can look back
[1:20:17] through the revelation of the word in
[1:20:19] this hour in this age concerning what
[1:20:21] God has done we look back with
[1:20:23] understanding and with revelation that
[1:20:26] God allowed this God allowed this gotta
[1:20:27] love that
[1:20:28] then brother and previous agents didn't
[1:20:31] know what God was doing it didn't know
[1:20:33] why God did it but you and I can look
[1:20:36] back and see that it was God a man a God
[1:20:39] was showing who he was God was officer
[1:20:42] showing you though the devil was and
[1:20:44] what he was doing and what guy and what
[1:20:46] the devil was doing but he permitted it
[1:20:49] all with a promise he said I ain't said
[1:20:52] the devil is going to do this what that
[1:20:53] was going to do that but he said I will
[1:20:55] restore said the Lord I'm going to do
[1:20:58] this a man God hole hallelujah brother
[1:21:02] see God why why did God permit what he
[1:21:04] permitted in the Garden of Eden
[1:21:06] why did God permit the fall a man in the
[1:21:10] Garden of Eden in that first creation in
[1:21:12] that natural creation
[1:21:13] it was so God could reveal himself as
[1:21:15] Lord and Savior because God could reveal
[1:21:18] his character and his love for his sons
[1:21:21] and his daughters
[1:21:22] hey man why so that so that he would get
[1:21:24] your love back to him amen he would love
[1:21:27] him for himself you were loving because
[1:21:30] of his character you would love it
[1:21:31] because of his nature ain't man not
[1:21:34] because all I was lost and the Lord
[1:21:36] saved me so I love him because he saved
[1:21:38] me no no your you are seeing the
[1:21:41] revelation of God as a son a daughter
[1:21:43] you're seeing
[1:21:44] revelation of your father a man and you
[1:21:47] love your father oh my that's my father
[1:21:50] and he's doing this and he's to be there
[1:21:53] I was born in sin
[1:21:55] I was shaped in iniquity I come to the
[1:21:58] world speaking lies a man and an ISA
[1:22:01] Laura and Daeng God had mercy on us God
[1:22:04] came down to help us God came though
[1:22:06] they gave us a revelation to get us back
[1:22:08] to him hey man back to Eternity again by
[1:22:12] the grace of God a man so brother who's
[1:22:15] God revealing himself that's why he'll
[1:22:18] nobody allowed in in in the Garden of
[1:22:20] Eden and so brother but why did God
[1:22:23] allow what he allowed here in the church
[1:22:25] ages it was the naturally the Garden of
[1:22:27] Eden and here is the spiritual in the in
[1:22:30] the church Jesus a man that when God
[1:22:33] left Israel and God left the Jews to
[1:22:35] call the people out of the Gentiles on
[1:22:37] to his name and is to provoke Israel to
[1:22:40] jealousy because God was forever married
[1:22:43] to backsliding Israel a man choices were
[1:22:47] provoked Israel to jealousy he would go
[1:22:49] coming as Christ a man he becoming the
[1:22:52] flesh as Christ and even call it a the
[1:22:54] Gentiles the people for his name a man
[1:22:57] and it is provoking Israel to jealousy
[1:22:59] and brother and what he allowed in the
[1:23:02] church agents you know the enemy to come
[1:23:05] in and again he warned them that this
[1:23:09] was going to happen and that was going
[1:23:10] to happen in the church ages a man Eddie
[1:23:17] should I have somewhat against thee in
[1:23:19] the first age because thou has left thy
[1:23:22] first love and it was it was God that
[1:23:24] Allah allowed the enemy to come in a lot
[1:23:26] another spirit to come in a man and they
[1:23:30] didn't did not denying the word but they
[1:23:32] moved out of the leadership of the Holy
[1:23:34] Ghost into the leadership of man under
[1:23:36] the influence of Satan a man an
[1:23:39] antichrist spirit there was the spirit
[1:23:41] of Christ but there was also the spirit
[1:23:44] of the Antichrist a man but again God
[1:23:46] allowed it and God permitted it because
[1:23:49] as God was revealing himself down
[1:23:51] through the ages as our Everly father
[1:23:53] God was going to reveal himself as our
[1:23:55] say
[1:23:56] for their church ages a man giving us
[1:23:59] power over all the power of the enemy
[1:24:01] praise the Lord
[1:24:03] he was revealing himself as our Heavenly
[1:24:05] Father
[1:24:06] now you're reveal himself as our Lord
[1:24:08] and our Savior a man
[1:24:10] praise the name of the Lord all praise
[1:24:13] the Lord
[1:24:14] not because we're Jews when I Jews movig
[1:24:17] a world were Gentiles but God said out
[1:24:20] of their will I call the people for my
[1:24:22] name amen and he said I because there
[1:24:25] has left thy first love and he told the
[1:24:29] repent but he said this thou has the
[1:24:32] ATIS a man if you're the seat of God no
[1:24:37] matter what age you're in whether you
[1:24:40] hate anything that is that is contrary
[1:24:43] to what God has said in his word a man
[1:24:45] you hate anything is contrary to the
[1:24:47] will of God for your life a man by the
[1:24:50] grace of God but this though as that the
[1:24:53] eighth is the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:24:56] which I also hate a man what is the
[1:24:59] deeds of the Nicolaitans well that is a
[1:25:01] spirit that started in the first stage
[1:25:03] the enemy would came in brother yes it
[1:25:06] was in Genesis in the Garden of Eden it
[1:25:09] was God and had him and but the enemy
[1:25:11] came in and any influenced Eve a man and
[1:25:14] he got Eve to doubt the Word of God he
[1:25:17] got Eve to believe the word plus a man
[1:25:20] to head to the word hey but what for for
[1:25:24] the plea to please the flesh brother
[1:25:26] we're not here to please the flesh we're
[1:25:28] here to please our souls we're here to
[1:25:30] please Leah near the inside of the
[1:25:32] inside not the outside amen yeah we know
[1:25:35] that God has put the curse on the
[1:25:37] outside hey man hey buddy he's got a
[1:25:41] geek gave us a promise of redemption but
[1:25:44] it's going to be from the inside out by
[1:25:47] the grace of Almighty God and so brother
[1:25:49] as it was in the Garden of Eden so it is
[1:25:51] here in the first church ain't God God
[1:25:54] went down and gave His Word and but but
[1:25:56] the enemy came in a man to challenge the
[1:25:59] Word of God the enemy came in to
[1:26:01] interpret the word the deeds of the
[1:26:03] Nicolaitans
[1:26:04] a man as if the devil came into the
[1:26:07] first age a man and there were those
[1:26:10] under the anointing of Satan Satan
[1:26:12] spirit the Antichrist spirit and they
[1:26:15] begin today they interpreted the Word of
[1:26:17] God
[1:26:17] the way the way that they wanted have
[1:26:19] been made to believe in a man
[1:26:22] brother sister the deeds of the
[1:26:25] Nicolaitans it is to turn them away from
[1:26:29] the truth the whole truth nothing but
[1:26:30] the truth it is to interpret the truth
[1:26:33] it was to interpret the word amen
[1:26:36] it was the get man to do to translate
[1:26:38] the word this way to understand the word
[1:26:40] this way but God said I said this though
[1:26:43] is that the hatest the deeds of the
[1:26:45] Nicolaitans the seed of God in that age
[1:26:47] did not like that spirit where
[1:26:49] desperately it led to the two
[1:26:52] denominations this is where
[1:26:54] denominationalism started the
[1:26:56] denominations that we are surrounded by
[1:26:58] the day brother we can trace it back to
[1:27:01] you know some back back a hundred years
[1:27:02] some back 300 from back 500 by brother
[1:27:05] the spirit of a denomination we can
[1:27:08] trace it right back to the first
[1:27:09] certchange amen and it is the deeds of
[1:27:12] the Nicolaitans God showed his word but
[1:27:15] the enemy came into soul is
[1:27:17] interpretation of the word a man o God
[1:27:21] said this yay but it means this you can
[1:27:24] still do this you can still do that but
[1:27:27] God didn't want us to add to it God
[1:27:28] didn't want us to take from it
[1:27:30] God wants to leave his word the way that
[1:27:32] he gave it a man and then that he would
[1:27:35] he would give us more and more
[1:27:36] understanding as the agents went on but
[1:27:39] the enemy got in and challenged him and
[1:27:41] he brought in those beats and he began
[1:27:44] to take well they're all man was under
[1:27:48] God's control but may the devil began to
[1:27:51] get into man and control the church a
[1:27:53] man not following the leadership of the
[1:27:56] Holy Ghost
[1:27:57] it was the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:59] the devil a man in the religious people
[1:28:01] who are still professing to believe the
[1:28:04] message still professor to believe the
[1:28:05] Word of God but again God allowed it
[1:28:08] because it would bring up more and more
[1:28:10] of the revelation of God amen
[1:28:14] got it out at an Eden to bring out a
[1:28:16] greater revelation of him for his sons
[1:28:18] and daughters God allowed an area in the
[1:28:21] church ages to bring out a greater
[1:28:23] revelation of him again for his sons and
[1:28:26] daughters a man and then he would leave
[1:28:28] the Jews and he would go to the Gentiles
[1:28:31] and call it a them of people for his
[1:28:33] name a man
[1:28:34] praise the name of the Lord so brother
[1:28:37] sister we look back and we see the
[1:28:39] revelation of God we're not seeing the
[1:28:41] devil were seeing that we're seeing God
[1:28:43] we do see the devil trying to interpret
[1:28:46] the word that ever trying to deceive the
[1:28:48] seed of God but we see God it's there
[1:28:50] all the time
[1:28:51] amen and you know what God knows that
[1:28:53] what he does when he does it where he
[1:28:56] doesn't have he does it he knows his
[1:28:58] seed is gonna recognize it Amen sons and
[1:29:01] daughters are not going to be to see
[1:29:03] amen brother sister but the seed of God
[1:29:06] are going to recognize it and they're
[1:29:08] going to stay with it and that's why God
[1:29:10] in the few Indian delayed the first
[1:29:13] church eh brother when they were when
[1:29:15] Paul moved from the the Jews to the
[1:29:17] Gentiles a man the few that stayed with
[1:29:20] the Word of God I believe God see right
[1:29:23] this was the darkness coming in and the
[1:29:27] darkness increased increased increased
[1:29:29] increase
[1:29:29] amen until finally the public God said
[1:29:32] until finally it was total darkness and
[1:29:35] he said I put that there and he said but
[1:29:39] the angel in the end when the prophet of
[1:29:40] God was preaching the church ages a man
[1:29:42] and he and he would preach of this and
[1:29:44] the probably God he had a draught on
[1:29:47] paper by the a but the pillar of fire
[1:29:50] come in and the angel came in and he
[1:29:52] drew it on the wall yeah it's amazing
[1:29:56] they're those that were there at the
[1:29:58] time that he was ministering this they
[1:30:00] saw that that angel come in and they saw
[1:30:02] or the pillar fire and drew it on the
[1:30:04] wall and the part of God says you
[1:30:06] noticed he said he said that when he
[1:30:08] drew and he said he didn't leave a
[1:30:10] needle or any white there and he said it
[1:30:12] was all dark a man so brother you and I
[1:30:16] know that to be the truth you and I are
[1:30:19] witnesses of that we're living in that
[1:30:21] hour
[1:30:22] that age when it is total darkness it is
[1:30:24] organized religion that controls the
[1:30:26] world it is organized religion that's
[1:30:28] controlling where weather is America
[1:30:30] whether it's United States where they're
[1:30:32] singing but any so-called Christian
[1:30:34] nation it is organized religion a man
[1:30:37] that controls it
[1:30:38] it is denomination and they're
[1:30:41] identifying where and brother the
[1:30:43] polygons that I indict this generation
[1:30:45] for the second crucifixion of our Lord
[1:30:47] Jesus Christ and what he indict he was
[1:30:50] indicted East which we thought well one
[1:30:53] time we did will say what was
[1:30:54] denominations they were crucifying
[1:30:57] Christ they crucified the Word of God
[1:30:59] what God was doing down through the ages
[1:31:01] the organized religions began they were
[1:31:04] moved against it and what God did in
[1:31:06] this last age for the Ministry of
[1:31:08] William Branham it was organized
[1:31:10] religion that's that they begin to move
[1:31:11] the gates what God had done amen that's
[1:31:15] that's the absolute truth and he even to
[1:31:18] the Pentecostals and so on
[1:31:20] they moved against it they they they
[1:31:22] were putting that ministry down they
[1:31:24] wanted to get rid of that ministry a man
[1:31:26] it was organized religion that was doing
[1:31:29] it denominationalism that was doing it
[1:31:31] that's why in this hour they are totally
[1:31:34] against the the truth and what God has
[1:31:36] done and what God is doing brother I
[1:31:39] turn it if they're still looking for it
[1:31:40] up the road but they're not recognizing
[1:31:43] what God has done and what God is doing
[1:31:45] a man they don't knowing what God has
[1:31:48] done and they're denying what God is
[1:31:50] doing a man so the only ones we're going
[1:31:53] to really recognize it as they ought to
[1:31:56] recognize it is the Bride of Christ amen
[1:31:59] brother the only one they're going to
[1:32:01] recognize and all my brothers sister
[1:32:03] again let me repair it say this they are
[1:32:07] looking for the resurrection sure you
[1:32:09] know what after you believe in the
[1:32:10] resurrection yes
[1:32:11] do you believe they're out for yes oh
[1:32:13] when it's are going to happen well we
[1:32:15] don't know it'll be down the road oh no
[1:32:17] no it's already in process Amen God is
[1:32:21] already working on it
[1:32:22] hallelujah
[1:32:23] hey man God has already done this done
[1:32:25] this done that well fortune told that he
[1:32:28] give us the right expectations that our
[1:32:31] brother Fontaine was ministering on true
[1:32:34] or false expectations amen
[1:32:37] but again our brother sister Russell we
[1:32:39] got the true expectation why because we
[1:32:41] see what God has done and we see and
[1:32:44] believe what God is doing
[1:32:45] amen brother Dan to recognize what God
[1:32:48] is doing
[1:32:49] we had to recognize what he did in the
[1:32:52] Ministry of Malachi for a man
[1:32:55] we had to recognize what he did in the
[1:32:57] Ministry of a man called William Branham
[1:32:58] but they turned it down the nominations
[1:33:02] turned it down organized religion turned
[1:33:03] it down they they wanted nothing to do
[1:33:06] with it as well as if we know there's a
[1:33:09] certain evangelist someone mentioned a
[1:33:12] name but you know a certain evangelist
[1:33:14] he went out and he spoke to brother
[1:33:16] Branham and he said brother Branham you
[1:33:18] got to stop preaching those things just
[1:33:22] think a Pentecostal evangelists known
[1:33:25] around the world brother and any signs
[1:33:28] and wonders in his old ministry but
[1:33:30] again it was only healing anyway it
[1:33:33] wasn't the sign of the prophet of
[1:33:34] Godhead it's a journey of the thoughts
[1:33:36] and the intents of the heart
[1:33:38] as one brother said he said and and I
[1:33:41] remember attending that brothers can
[1:33:43] meetings in in just outside the lowest
[1:33:48] point intersection there and there's a
[1:33:50] there's a church there on the highway
[1:33:51] and that brother came here and he AE and
[1:33:55] some special meetings and he said he
[1:33:57] said one time and he said listen and he
[1:34:00] said when it comes to William Branham he
[1:34:02] said - he said you could put bullet
[1:34:03] wound implanted in one side of the scale
[1:34:05] and he said he said the balance out he
[1:34:08] said that the ministry of William
[1:34:09] Branham he said you'd have to have 24 he
[1:34:12] said of us in the other side he said of
[1:34:15] each of the balance ISA with with her
[1:34:17] brown brother he was acknowledging that
[1:34:20] it was God he was a knowledge that it
[1:34:22] was a ministry like the ministry that
[1:34:24] Jesus ain't discerning the thoughts and
[1:34:27] the intents of the heart by the grace of
[1:34:30] God and every day
[1:34:31] sign in his hand a man deserting spirits
[1:34:34] he take - and it was in his left hand he
[1:34:37] take your left hand and so on anyway and
[1:34:39] he would know what was wrong with you by
[1:34:41] that sign a man it was hard to heart a
[1:34:45] man
[1:34:46] so yeah that's right and he had the
[1:34:48] deserted sign and then the angel told
[1:34:50] him after is to start using those signs
[1:34:52] and he should because the people are
[1:34:54] leaning on a signpost and there are
[1:34:56] believers today that are leaning on a
[1:34:57] signpost and looking for God to send the
[1:35:00] proverb bearing with signs and wonders
[1:35:02] brother our trailer there's the sign
[1:35:04] days that God wants us to get our
[1:35:06] attention with it's a sign of the
[1:35:08] resurrection
[1:35:09] it is a sign of the rapture it is a sign
[1:35:11] of the change of our bodies amen
[1:35:14] it is not us they're just getting healed
[1:35:16] it is not just experiencing all
[1:35:17] wonderful experience and we're happy and
[1:35:21] we're joyful no brother the joy is gonna

[1:53:47] get a revelation they just read it go on
[1:53:50] well that's the Bible yeah but what does
[1:53:53] it mean if no man hath ascended up only
[1:53:55] he that came down even as on a man who
[1:53:57] is in heaven he is I thought you were
[1:54:03] here
[1:54:05] yeah but he said I'm up there he was in
[1:54:08] theophany was there a man we buy pastor
[1:54:12] a theophany he didn't bypass is a man
[1:54:17] because of sin we buy pastor theophany
[1:54:19] but yerba theophany is your guardian
[1:54:21] angel to bring you back any man but
[1:54:26] Jesus he said how long shall I be with
[1:54:30] you that kingdom of God was so real to
[1:54:34] Jesus that he didn't want to be here
[1:54:38] much longer how long should I be with
[1:54:42] you oh yeah he wanted to go and so
[1:54:46] finally he entered that faith that
[1:54:49] revelation that third pole What did he
[1:54:53] say he said I am no more in the world he
[1:54:59] knew he was moving from from one that
[1:55:02] that phase of the ministry right into
[1:55:04] the third phase of his ministry and he
[1:55:06] was going to go
[1:55:07] he had pay a price he was one that
[1:55:10] supper but he said I'm no more in the
[1:55:12] world because this phase was the
[1:55:14] ministry was going to take him back to
[1:55:17] the kingdom of God anyway and brother he
[1:55:22] sent the life of his blood back to us to
[1:55:25] created us to say my Ungar Fame thirst

[1:55:59] soon be there yeah thank God God's a man
[1:56:03] son
[1:56:04] it's like I told you when I was going
[1:56:09] through that darkness trying to reach
[1:56:11] the pillar of fire
[1:56:16] it was hard
[1:56:18] why because everything around me was
[1:56:21] black dark it was dark and and I was
[1:56:28] climbing over rocks and around rocks and
[1:56:30] I was stumbling I get up and I keep
[1:56:33] looking at the pillar of fire well one
[1:56:37] point there was so hard I looked up but
[1:56:39] the pillar fire and I said Lord I said
[1:56:42] will I make it I don't want to fail this
[1:56:46] I want to make it and he said son he
[1:56:50] says you'll make it but he said it's
[1:56:53] going to be hard press on and I came out
[1:56:58] of another vision yeah same with us when
[1:57:04] we come to the climax of the third pole
[1:57:07] the climax of the resurrection and
[1:57:09] rapture revelation brother it's going to
[1:57:12] be heard I too know this is not the
[1:57:14] world we lived in five years ago there's
[1:57:17] not the world we lived in a year ago
[1:57:19] everything is changing oh yeah
[1:57:22] everything's getting more and more and
[1:57:24] more insane amen
[1:57:27] and everything is getting less and less
[1:57:28] spiritual I'm not saying they're not
[1:57:30] religious person less spiritual amen but
[1:57:34] the wise virgin she's got the extra Hall
[1:57:36] of her land to keep her moving but the
[1:57:39] foolish virgin prophet said she's a
[1:57:41] virgin
[1:57:42] yeah but she's foolish because she's
[1:57:46] never had the extra
[1:57:48] and he said the Prophet said that
[1:57:51] foolish virgin will go through the Great
[1:57:52] Tribulation and they'll be they'll had
[1:57:54] to lay down their lives amen but they're
[1:57:58] not bright the bride is the wise virgin
[1:58:03] grace to his brother sister
[1:58:08] that we're going to have the true
[1:58:10] expectations of the revealed word for
[1:58:14] this hour the true expectations of the
[1:58:17] third pal of the ministry of Christ in
[1:58:20] this age
[1:58:21] it wasn't the Ministry of Jesus or
[1:58:23] William Branham it was the Ministry of
[1:58:25] our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:58:27] the public are told us a number of times
[1:58:30] he says this is not me this is him and
[1:58:32] he said it he said I am NOT the son of
[1:58:35] man he said I am a son of man he's
[1:58:37] revealing this on a man and he said
[1:58:41] that's your problem he says you can't
[1:58:42] see the other angel amen
[1:58:46] god help us to see the other angel amen
[1:58:50] so we say the real revelation and what
[1:58:54] is it pointing to it's not just pointing
[1:58:56] to Jesus as saying I'm the same
[1:58:59] yesterday today and forever I'm the
[1:59:01] healer I do this I do that no it's the
[1:59:04] resurrection and the rapture what was
[1:59:06] the revelation oh my lord hallelujah
[1:59:08] thank you Jesus if any revelation
[1:59:12] brother God wants us to believe is that
[1:59:13] he's the resurrection and he's the
[1:59:15] rapture amen what was the revelation
[1:59:19] that he asked Martha said I am the
[1:59:21] resurrection I am the rapture or I had
[1:59:24] the resurrection he said believest thou
[1:59:25] this oh she said first he said Lazarus
[1:59:31] arise oh I believe he'll rise in the
[1:59:33] resurrection up there but she was
[1:59:35] talking to the resurrection she was
[1:59:40] talking to the resurrection he said
[1:59:43] jesus said all but he said I am NOT I
[1:59:48] will be I am the resurrection amen he
[1:59:53] said not only resurrection he was the
[1:59:55] rapture a man he raised up but he also
[2:00:01] was cut off in the cloud of angels and
[2:00:05] so on and he said if anyone any II that
[2:00:08] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[2:00:10] die
[2:00:10] and though he were dead yet shall he
[2:00:12] live a man praise the Lord
[2:00:16] so I pray great grace that we have that

[2:00:21] be the rapture I will be the
[2:00:23] resurrection I am the resurrection

[2:02:02] of the spiritual yeah and it's not me
[2:02:07] that lives it's it's the anointing in me
[2:02:10] it's Christ in me that's living and if

[2:02:14] conscious of what Christ is doing if
[2:02:17] Christ is very very conscious of what
[2:02:19] God is doing but conscious of what you
[2:02:22] want not what he just had done yes but
[2:02:25] what he's doing what is he doing well he

[2:04:31] want to die why well maybe maybe that
[2:04:36] hunger thirst for fellowship with them
[2:04:38] doesn't mean that you want to die it
[2:04:40] means that you're going to live you're
[2:04:42] gonna go and live where they are

[2:05:58] pray God would work up more more
[2:06:01] conscious of the rapture amen brother I
[2:06:05] told it the longer we the more we get
[2:06:06] into the word the more we get into the
[2:06:08] word the more we're going to focus on
[2:06:11] the rapture and the resurrection don't
[2:06:14] let the devil control your thoughts

[2:06:24] you're gonna be thinking on the
[2:06:26] resurrection rapture he said I am the
[2:06:29] resurrection and he is the rapture by
[2:06:32] the grace of God
[2:06:42] mazie
[2:06:44] thank god we're going where there is no
[2:06:46] time just think listen he said now it's
[2:06:59] got to a place to where Pentecostal
[2:07:05] church with the Neuse birth as been
[2:07:07] tested and tried and God doesn't deal
[2:07:10] with the church as just an organization
[2:07:13] he deals he does God doesn't deal with
[2:07:15] the church that way he doesn't deal with
[2:07:18] the church as a group of people he deals
[2:07:23] with the church as individuals each
[2:07:27] individual in the church God is dealing
[2:07:29] with you oh well I go to this church
[2:07:35] that yeah but Jesus go with you that's
[2:07:43] the important thing and he says no
[2:07:46] secret we all see it when a man proves
[2:07:50] and God and God loves him he takes him
[2:07:52] out somewhere to himself and there in
[2:07:55] the front of angels he does something
[2:07:57] for him he lifts him up there in the
[2:07:59] presence of God and gifts him and fills
[2:08:02] him and sets him out and he said that's
[2:08:05] the age that we are living in a man what
[2:08:10] is it it's the age of adoption that God
[2:08:15] is going out to bring his sons and
[2:08:16] daughters in for the full adoption and
[2:08:21] the climax of the adoption is the
[2:08:23] rapture that's right and he said the
[2:08:28] same Holy Spirit that saved the
[2:08:30] Lutheran's that sanctified the
[2:08:32] Methodists that baptized the
[2:08:33] Pentecostals is now setting in order the
[2:08:36] coming of the Lord Jesus and he said
[2:08:39] when it will be so powerful that the
[2:08:41] body will come into the group this group
[2:08:44] of a church that will draw the rest of
[2:08:46] them from the grave so powerful
[2:08:51] hallelujah

[2:08:58] out of the grace they'll draw them from
[2:09:01] that dimension into this dimension amen
[2:09:04] and then we're going to be changed
[2:09:07] hallelujah they're waiting on us amen

[2:09:32] when it will be so powerful the coming
[2:09:34] of the Lord Jesus so powerful that body
[2:09:37] will come into this group of church is
[2:09:39] he in us tonight
[2:09:42] grace is he in your house in your home
[2:09:46] is it with you in your job so that it's
[2:09:51] not you it's Christ in you each that
[2:09:56] will draw the rest of them from the
[2:09:57] grave and there will be a resurrection
[2:09:59] he said that's what the Holy Ghost is
[2:10:01] for he said what is the Holy Ghost he
[2:10:04] said without us they cannot be made
[2:10:06] perfect he said they lived in one day
[2:10:09] under that we live in another day amen
[2:10:13] but now he said when we needed the
[2:10:16] Spirit of God he said raises a standard
[2:10:18] and he said what is it he is pulling in
[2:10:22] his spirit and he said then those who
[2:10:24] are resting out yonder the grave or
[2:10:27] under the altar of God as the scripture
[2:10:30] says are crying how long how long how
[2:10:33] much longer he said God is waiting on me
[2:10:36] and you amen
[2:10:40] he said the church is waiting on me and
[2:10:43] you yeah
[2:10:47] adoption time yeah the rapture is
[2:10:52] adoption time confirmation of our
[2:10:56] adoption as sons and daughters of God he
[2:11:00] said where you are me and you adoption
[2:11:02] time and he said when God can pour
[2:11:05] to us his fullness his power his
[2:11:07] resurrection that when the church and
[2:11:10] Christ become so close together till
[2:11:13] close becomes visible among us and
[2:11:17] raises the dead and we go into the
[2:11:21] rapture a man alleluia alleluia
[2:11:27] he's waiting on us to get into the
[2:11:31] spirit of rapture in faith to get into
[2:11:36] the spirit of the resurrection by the
[2:11:39] grace of God now we're going to say and
[2:11:45] show you after a while that just those
[2:11:47] who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes
[2:11:50] in the rapture the rest of the Dead
[2:11:53] lived not again for the space of a
[2:11:56] thousand years that's right the Holy
[2:11:58] Spirit filled people was all that went
[2:12:01] in the rapture you better make your call
[2:12:03] and election sure to walk in the spirit
[2:12:07] and live in the spirit you've got to be
[2:12:08] filled with the spirit and it's the
[2:12:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is Christ
[2:12:14] in me and you
[2:12:23] you're not converted until you receive
[2:12:26] the Holy Ghost that's right he said the
[2:12:30] Holy Spirit has spoke to you and you
[2:12:32] publicly confessed him the devil has the
[2:12:35] same thing I believe him to be the Son
[2:12:38] of God so does the devil but you're
[2:12:40] walking on towards him and when Peter
[2:12:42] had been called and justified by
[2:12:44] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus
[2:12:48] sanctified them through the word for the
[2:12:51] word was the truth amen
[2:12:54] is like on the day of Pentecost when
[2:12:58] they were preaching and the scribes and
[2:13:00] the Pharisees went out you know and just
[2:13:04] criticized the disciples that were
[2:13:06] preaching Jesus and Oh Peter yeah you
[2:13:17] Peter you're the one that ran away from
[2:13:20] Jesus when he was crucified and now
[2:13:25] you're here preaching Jesus yeah and
[2:13:30] even though they they were forbidden to
[2:13:32] preach Jesus he kept preaching Jesus
[2:13:34] they were amazed that Peter had changed
[2:13:39] yet why it was the baptism of the Holy
[2:13:42] Ghost amen
[2:13:45] Christ revealed in Peter and through
[2:13:48] Peter praise the Lord
[2:13:51] bear with me
[2:14:00] he gave them power against unclean
[2:14:02] spirits and they went out he put their
[2:14:05] names in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[2:14:08] they come back rejoicing and said even
[2:14:11] the devils is subject to us and he said
[2:14:14] don't rejoice because the Devils are
[2:14:16] subject unto you but rejoice because
[2:14:18] your names he says in the book Judas was
[2:14:24] with them and so how close he can come
[2:14:28] right on up through justification
[2:14:31] sanctification and where did he show his
[2:14:34] light where did he show itself before
[2:14:36] Pentecost Judas showed his colors before
[2:14:42] the resurrection rapture many a
[2:14:43] professing believer going to show their
[2:14:45] colors and many are showing their colors
[2:14:48] now by looking for a return ministry or
[2:14:51] a tenth vision tenth meeting I said well
[2:14:57] I'm in the tenth meeting yeah
[2:15:06] he said what's that spirit will be just
[2:15:08] as pious and just as sanctimonious as it
[2:15:11] can be until it comes to the Holy Ghost
[2:15:14] and they'll cut it right off he said
[2:15:17] can't you see it moving up
[2:15:18] it's the Antichrist jesus said they'd be
[2:15:22] so close together in the last days it
[2:15:24] would deceive the very elect if possible
[2:15:26] so you better make your calling election
[2:15:29] short because he said these so close are
[2:15:33] deceive the very elect if possible don't
[2:15:38] worry but what's out there
[2:15:39] it's what's around the message our
[2:15:44] brother the Fontaine brought out some of
[2:15:46] those things and highlighted some of
[2:15:47] those things a man that's right so let's
[2:15:51] make sure that if we're in the message
[2:15:53] well that's good but make sure that
[2:15:56] we're not part of the group that's so
[2:15:58] close and we deceive the very elect
[2:16:00] impossible so you better be careful I
[2:16:06] know there's there's much on the
[2:16:09] internet and there's some dust good and
[2:16:11] some not so good so make sure that that
[2:16:17] one of them had don't add that spirit
[2:16:18] that it deceive you deceive the very
[2:16:22] like that possible and many are going to
[2:16:24] be deceived and many are being deceived
[2:16:27] that's right my message people preaching
[2:16:31] the message testifying of the message
[2:16:33] this the message distant message you
[2:16:36] better get God's leadership in your life
[2:16:41] you better get Holy Ghost discernment in
[2:16:44] your life in your heart and in your soul
[2:16:49] brother this is serious if it's so close
[2:16:53] it would deceive the very elect it has
[2:16:56] to be within our ranks yeah did I say it
[2:17:03] was within the ranks of the disciples in
[2:17:06] the days of Jesus oh yeah and not only
[2:17:09] that Paul the messenger that first
[2:17:12] church age he warned that there were
[2:17:13] many false prophets and apostles and
[2:17:16] everything preaching the message
[2:17:19] the first church eh he said behind their
[2:17:23] guard because they'll deceive many and
[2:17:26] in this hour
[2:17:27] it'd be so closer would deceive the very
[2:17:30] land he said God calls by election our
[2:17:44] new people here tonight knowing that
[2:17:45] something in your heart tugging I want
[2:17:48] that only spirit I want you Lord in my
[2:17:50] heart he sir that's because God put your
[2:17:53] name in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[2:17:56] the foundation of the world all my dear
[2:17:59] friends from around this country and in
[2:18:04] this little city if I could only with my
[2:18:06] human voice place into your heart the
[2:18:08] importance of receiving the baptism of
[2:18:11] the Holy Ghost oh it would be the most
[2:18:13] wonderful revelation that you ever had
[2:18:16] in your life
[2:18:17] to see what you must do it he said let
[2:18:22] us make that clear about you're not
[2:18:24] converted Peter had been saved
[2:18:26] he believed on the Lord followed him
[2:18:29] Jesus told him he was had to follow him
[2:18:33] he gave him power against unclean
[2:18:35] spirits and sanctified him and yet Jesus
[2:18:38] said the night of his betrayal lovest
[2:18:40] thou me Peter you know he followed him
[2:18:45] and followed him and followed him
[2:18:46] and yet Jesus questioned Islam it's
[2:18:51] Jesus questioning your love for him for
[2:18:56] one another
[2:18:57] Holy Ghost love grace
[2:19:07] amen
[2:19:08] I'll have to stop there
[2:19:16] he said the only way that you can say
[2:19:18] that Jesus is the Christ is when the
[2:19:21] Holy Ghost comes into you and bears
[2:19:24] record and witness itself he is the son
[2:19:27] of God that's the only way you know the
[2:19:29] resurrection is when the Holy Ghost
[2:19:31] bears record in you amen
[2:19:42] finish with this question will the bride
[2:19:46] be gathered together in one place at the
[2:19:49] rapture yeah I said the bride will be
[2:19:58] gathered together one place that is true
[2:20:01] but not until the resurrection we which
[2:20:05] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[2:20:07] the Lord shall not prevent them which
[2:20:09] are sleep universally for the trumpet of
[2:20:13] God shall sound and the dead in Christ
[2:20:16] shall rise and we shall be caught up
[2:20:18] together with them to meet the Lord in
[2:20:20] the air
[2:20:20] therefore the bride will be caught up
[2:20:22] together the bride will all be together
[2:20:25] when it goes to meet the Lord a man but
[2:20:29] we're going to get together here a man
[2:20:33] we're going to blend together here Jesus
[2:20:38] is going to get us together Jesus is
[2:20:40] going to unite us but then he's going to
[2:20:42] go up and get into that body and come
[2:20:44] down to receive us unto himself
[2:20:47] amen jesus said when the Son of man
[2:20:51] shall appear he said I said it be like
[2:20:53] the light that shines from east even
[2:20:56] unto the west he said the whole thing
[2:20:58] there will be a resurrection and a
[2:21:00] rapture and away it'll go he said when I
[2:21:04] say we then I mean by grace I believe by
[2:21:08] faith I believe it in the in His grace
[2:21:10] that we will be among those people that
[2:21:14] will be caught up
[2:21:15] he said the resurrection will sit in
[2:21:17] first the resurrection of those that are
[2:21:20] asleep and there will be awakening time
[2:21:22] and those which are asleep not in sin
[2:21:28] but there'll be a still sleep those in
[2:21:30] seen will sleep right on but the others
[2:21:33] he said in the first resurrection come
[2:21:36] forth and those corruptible bodies will
[2:21:40] put on incorruption in the rapture in
[2:21:42] grace of the Lord and then we'll all get
[2:21:45] together and when they begin to get
[2:21:47] together we which our live remain shall
[2:21:51] be changed and these mortal bodies will
[2:21:54] not see death but just of a sudden there
[2:21:57] being like a sweet go over us and you're
[2:21:59] changed he said your turn back like
[2:22:02] Abraham was from an old man to a young
[2:22:04] man from an old woman to a young woman
[2:22:06] and then will gather together with them
[2:22:09] and then be caught up to meet the Lord
[2:22:13] in the air
[2:22:14] it'll be a universal rapture and the
[2:22:18] church will be all be together and after
[2:22:21] the resurrection and rapture as Citian
[2:22:23] will be together a man the grace of God
[2:22:28] be with us there's one scripture you
[2:22:32] don't have to turn to it brother Alec
[2:22:40] shared a tape with me at the house - I
[2:22:44] guess two or three weeks ago and the
[2:22:47] brother ministered on Romans 8 and
[2:22:51] equally emphasized verse five five and
[2:22:54] six again I emphasize it's the same
[2:23:00] chapter I read from as many as are led
[2:23:03] by the Spirit of God they are the sons
[2:23:05] of God amen but you're not led by the
[2:23:09] Spirit of God you're not the son and
[2:23:12] daughter of God a man because you can be
[2:23:16] part of the church and part of this and
[2:23:18] part of the message but still not be a
[2:23:20] son or daughter of God and our brother
[2:23:24] on the table holded Romans 8 and verse 5
[2:23:28] for they that are after the flesh do
[2:23:31] mind the things of the flesh but they
[2:23:33] that are after the spirit the things of
[2:23:36] the Spirit so what are we after the
[2:23:39] flesh or the
[2:23:44] what he fell focusing on flesh or spirit
[2:23:49] for to be carnally minded as physical
[2:23:54] focusing on the physical things of life
[2:23:58] to be currently minded focusing on the
[2:24:01] physical things of life
[2:24:02] he said his death but easier to be
[2:24:07] spiritually minded focusing on the
[2:24:10] spiritual a man he said his life and
[2:24:16] peace so let's make sure that we're not
[2:24:20] currently minded we're not controlled by
[2:24:23] the carnal mind and the thoughts and
[2:24:25] senses of our flesh no no we're
[2:24:28] controlled by the Holy Ghost amen that's
[2:24:32] life and peace
[2:24:33] but the carnal mind is death and our
[2:24:38] brother was emphasizing that even many
[2:24:40] believers are currently minded and
[2:24:45] they're dead spiritually but if if
[2:24:51] you're focusing on spiritual you're
[2:24:53] spiritually minded you think the
[2:24:55] thoughts of God you think oh what is the
[2:24:57] Lord feel why does the Lord think what
[2:24:58] is the Lord telling me you know your
[2:25:01] spiritual you talk spiritual you act
[2:25:03] spiritually you make your decisions
[2:25:04] based on spiritual revelation amen it's
[2:25:08] the Holy Ghost in you as life and peace
[2:25:11] amen
[2:25:13] it doesn't mean that it's gonna make
[2:25:16] decisions all just all that's in your
[2:25:18] favor
[2:25:19] sometimes it's God testing you and
[2:25:21] trying you our brother LaFontaine
[2:25:23] brought that out as well that this is a
[2:25:25] will of God that's the will of God
[2:25:27] sometimes is it's it's a trial or a test
[2:25:30] you're going to experience this you can
[2:25:32] experience pain and whatever it is it's
[2:25:34] called testing us amen spiritually but
[2:25:39] currently minded we want to avoid this
[2:25:40] and avoid that and avoid that no no God
[2:25:44] wants you to go through to manifest your
[2:25:46] faith amen
[2:25:48] God's gonna test us to bring out what's
[2:25:52] in our hearts
[2:25:53] by the grace of God sure brother we are
[2:25:58] in the cycle of the seventh seal we're
[2:26:00] in the power of redemption brings us to
[2:26:02] the climax of redemption and what is the
[2:26:05] climax of redemption the resurrection
[2:26:08] and the rapture of our physical bodies
[2:26:12] amen
[2:26:13] the grace of God brother sister that
[2:26:17] we're going to find ourselves in the
[2:26:21] climax of redemption he meant not just
[2:26:25] redemption order started here started
[2:26:27] here started here but where's it going
[2:26:29] to finish it begins as the Bible says it
[2:26:34] begins in your spirit in your soul in
[2:26:36] your spirit but it finishes and ends in
[2:26:38] the change of your body by the grace of
[2:26:42] God so brother God God reveals it to us
[2:26:47] but it comes to our baptism of the Holy
[2:26:50] Ghost and God's revealing to us when it
[2:26:52] comes to the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:54] and the change of our vows by the grace
[2:26:57] of God please in the name of the Lord
[2:27:00] Jesus Christ let's be spiritually minded
[2:27:03] now not currently minded so you're not
[2:27:07] focusing on the natural you're focusing
[2:27:09] on the spiritual because the natural is
[2:27:12] passing away this too shall pass away
