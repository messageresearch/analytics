[47:38] How great thou are. [music]
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So good to
[47:47] be here tonight. Good to see each one
[47:48] that could make it. Amen. You can take
[47:50] your seats just for a moment. I did want
[47:52] to give a small testimony tonight. Not
[47:54] to hold back the preacher at all, but uh
[47:57] as you know, Jensen had quite a fall on
[47:58] Sunday, and I just wanted to thank the
[48:00] Lord for all that he's done to get him
[48:02] through sitting here in the pew tonight.
[48:04] And you know, we we haven't had the best
[48:07] of experiences with the Newfoundland
[48:08] Medical System. But I told my wife, I
[48:10] said, "We're going to trust God. We're
[48:12] going to trust God." And so I went to my
[48:15] doctor that had said we can bring them
[48:16] in anytime. time and he refused to take
[48:18] him. But she had gone to a a massage
[48:21] therapist that same day on the Monday.
[48:23] It was her birthday. It was already
[48:25] booked and she'd have lost it if she
[48:26] didn't do it. And so she went and the
[48:28] lady there said, "If you call this
[48:29] clinic, they'll get get you in." So she
[48:31] called them in. They did a phone
[48:33] consult. They said, "Get him in right
[48:35] away. We'll fit you in tomorrow." So he
[48:36] went in for there and they were able to
[48:38] do a quick review of him. They've set up
[48:40] blood work and EKG and all these
[48:41] different tests that they want to do.
[48:43] They're going to hopefully refer him to
[48:44] a pediatrician. And then they said that
[48:46] they would take the whole family in as
[48:48] well for a family doctor as well. So,
[48:50] we're thankful for that. Amen. Sometimes
[48:52] you think that it's just the devil, but
[48:54] sometimes God's providing in the way of
[48:57] a battle. Amen. So, we're thankful for
[48:59] that. And uh they had said he had an
[49:01] abscess, but then they went to the the
[49:02] the surgeon. He said, "I don't think
[49:04] it's an abscess." And uh the dentist
[49:07] called that day. She said, "I talked to
[49:08] a panel and they don't think it's an
[49:10] abscess. We're just going to leave it as
[49:11] well, so he doesn't have to have surgery
[49:13] on the tooth to pull that out." So,
[49:15] we're just trusting again that the
[49:16] Lord's in it. He doesn't have to have
[49:18] surgery on his jaw, they said, in four
[49:19] to six weeks, but it should fuse back
[49:21] together and be completely normal. So,
[49:23] we're thankful for that. He does get to
[49:25] eat sandwiches during church just to
[49:26] make sure that his blood sugar stays up
[49:28] and make sure he's got energy throughout
[49:30] the service. Um, but we don't know that
[49:32] that that has anything to do with it.
[49:34] But we're thankful, amen, that he's here
[49:35] and he's running around and and he's
[49:37] doing his old he's being his old self.
[49:39] So, we're very thankful for that. Amen.
[49:42] We're thankful to have a visiting
[49:44] minister finally get through the barrage
[49:47] of devil's gunfire. Amen. We've got
[49:49] brother William Puy from Dallas Fort
[49:51] Worth and he's uh assisting Brother
[49:53] David McGee, my old pastor there. Been
[49:55] there for many, many years now and uh
[49:58] just talking to him and I had to get
[49:59] some information to book his tickets and
[50:01] we're two weeks apart in our birthday.
[50:03] Um so we're almost the exact same age.
[50:06] We're both engineers. He's electrical.
[50:08] I'm mechanical. We both have four kids,
[50:10] one girl, three boys. So, we are
[50:13] brothers from another mother, it would
[50:14] seem. But, um, we're thankful to have
[50:16] him here. Thankfully, he took his time.
[50:18] He's been traveling a lot and he left
[50:20] his Thanksgiving to come and give us a
[50:22] thanksgiving up here. So, we certainly
[50:24] want to say God bless you, Brother
[50:25] Billy, for coming up. Amen. We're in for
[50:27] a real treat. I was I was coming in. I
[50:30] hope it's okay for me to say this,
[50:31] Brother Billy. It doesn't matter if I'm
[50:32] not, but I hope it's okay. I said, 'How
[50:34] you feeling? He said, a little bit
[50:35] nervous. I said, ' Don't be nervous.' I
[50:37] said, everybody's just like me.' I said,
[50:39] "We're we're easygoing. We're happy to
[50:41] be here. We want to be in church." I
[50:43] said, "So, just come in the attitude
[50:44] that you are, the person that you are,
[50:46] and everything else will be okay." So,
[50:48] we're just trusting, Amen. that the
[50:50] spirit will speak through him tonight.
[50:51] Amen. Let's just stand if we would.
[50:53] We're going to sing that song, I worship
[50:55] you, Almighty God. There's none like
[50:56] you. As we hand the pulpit over to him,
[50:59] I've reminded him there's no there's no
[51:01] uh clocks in the church. We're just
[51:03] going to go until the spirit's done.
[51:05] Amen. and just trust that we can enter
[51:07] in that he can get himself out of the
[51:09] way. Pull. You got a need, you pray.
[51:11] Pray like you've never prayed before.
[51:13] Said, "Lord, come my way. Lord, talk to
[51:15] me. Show me you know my name. Show me
[51:16] you know I show me that you know I'm
[51:18] here." And just let him speak to you and
[51:20] watch the Holy Spirit just come down and
[51:22] touch your need and and speak to you
[51:24] tonight. Amen. We're going to sing this
[51:25] as brother Billy comes. Amen.
[51:29] I worship
[51:32] you
[51:33] almighty
[51:36] God [music]
[51:38] for there is none like you.
[51:44] I worship
[51:47] you
[51:48] oh [singing] prince [music] of peace.
[51:53] That [singing] is what I long to do.
[51:59] I give you [singing and music] praise
[52:05] for you are my [singing] rightuousness.
[52:07] [music]
[52:14] I worship [music]
[52:16] you
[52:17] almighty
[52:20] [singing] God.
[52:22] There is none like you. [singing]
[52:26] [music]
[52:28] I worship
[52:30] you.
[52:33] [music]
[52:37] [singing]
[52:40] [music]
[52:42] Oh, and I worship [singing] you
[52:47] all
[52:48] of

[53:18] God.
[53:20] There is none like you.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that tonight?
[53:27] Why don't we just bow our heads and go
[53:29] to him in prayer? Our gracious father,
[53:33] Father, as your children, we long to
[53:36] worship you, Lord. And we long to sit at
[53:39] your feet and drink a cup and Lord to
[53:42] just have fellowship and have you talk
[53:44] to us, Lord. And [music] Father, the I
[53:47] would say from my own heart. And we
[53:50] desire, Lord, that fellowship that
[53:52] existed in the beginning where you would
[53:54] come down in the cool of the evening and
[53:57] and just fellowship with your children
[53:59] and and Adam [music] will talk to you
[54:01] and Eve and you would talk to them back
[54:04] and and Father, you would put them to
[54:06] sleep, oh God. And Father, we desire
[54:09] that closeness today, Lord. And we
[54:12] gather here, Lord, and gather from
[54:14] [music] different places and brought
[54:15] different needs. And but Father, we have
[54:18] one God who's overall and who knows all
[54:20] our needs. And Lord, we sang songs and
[54:23] we worship you. And now, Father, it's
[54:26] the time for the word. And we invite
[54:28] you, Lord, that you may just come and
[54:30] [music] Father, take this what would be
[54:32] spoken, oh God, and make it food for our
[54:35] souls, Lord. And Father, a man can put
[54:38] lines together. He could put quotes
[54:40] together, but it really takes you to
[54:43] minister to our hearts, Lord. And what
[54:45] we desire is the ministering of the
[54:47] spirit in this hour, Lord. Father, we
[54:50] thank you for the opportunity to be
[54:52] gathered here, Lord. We know that you
[54:55] made it possible that this moment could
[54:57] come. You even knew about it before
[54:59] time. Now what we ask that the purpose
[55:01] for which this moment was made may you
[55:03] just come among us oh God and speak to
[55:07] each individual Father from the children
[55:09] to the oldest and that there may be not
[55:11] a need here that you didn't talk about
[55:14] or that they didn't minister to Lord
[55:16] Father what good would it be for us to
[55:18] just come here and return back the same
[55:21] but Father what we desire is the change
[55:23] of heart and change of attitude and
[55:26] Father that we can go back and say that
[55:28] surely our heartburn within us [music]
[55:30] as he talked to us along the way. We
[55:32] commit the service into you, Father.
[55:34] These meetings will take place [music]
[55:36] Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Lord God,
[55:39] that somebody may be touched this
[55:41] weekend that they may say, "My life has
[55:43] changed, oh God, because you said that
[55:46] one soul is worth a 10,000 world, oh
[55:48] God, that you will come and do it
[55:50] according to your word. We commit it to
[55:52] you and we ask this in the name of the
[55:54] Lord Jesus Christ. We pray." Amen. Amen.
[55:58] and God bless you. We're certainly happy
[56:00] to be gathering in the house of God.
[56:02] Amen. You would just be seated for a
[56:04] moment before we read our scriptures. Uh
[56:07] we just want to bring greetings uh from
[56:10] home and from our church, Christian Life
[56:13] Tabernacle. As brother Jonathan said, we
[56:15] bring greetings uh from our pastor,
[56:17] brother David McGary. Uh we've known
[56:19] brother Jonathan for quite some time.
[56:22] We're actually I think it's over 20
[56:24] something years, I believe. and and I
[56:27] hadn't heard from him for a long while
[56:28] and and I got the text message. I was
[56:31] actually at the airport uh uh traveling
[56:34] to London for work and um and I looked
[56:37] and I'm like I think I know and and and
[56:40] then all of the sudden I I made a phone
[56:42] call, we talked and it was just you know
[56:45] we picked it up right where we left it
[56:47] from. So certainly uh happy that uh
[56:50] we've given the opportunity to come
[56:52] here. certainly thankful and certainly
[56:55] appreciate the opportunity. We don't
[56:57] take it lightly when we have to stand
[56:59] before the elect of God and speak to
[57:01] them. Amen. So, we bring greetings from
[57:03] our pastor, brother David, and and then
[57:05] there are those from home that knew who
[57:07] you were and brother Mike, Sister Lee,
[57:09] and David Jr. and others. They certainly
[57:12] wanted me to uh bring the greetings and
[57:14] and and my family to all of you. Amen.
[57:18] So, let's stand and just take our Bibles
[57:20] and uh we're going to get right into it
[57:23] and uh we'll see where the Lord takes us
[57:25] today. Amen.
[57:28] Let's open our Bibles in Luke chapter 5.
[57:42] Let's start from verse one.
[57:46] said to me, "It came to pass that as the
[57:49] people pressed upon him to hear the word
[57:52] of God, he stood by the lake Guinness
[57:57] and saw the two ships standing by the
[57:59] lake, but the fishermen were gone out of
[58:02] them were washing their nets." And he
[58:05] entered into one of the ships which were
[58:08] Simon's and prayed him that he would
[58:11] thrust out a little out to the land uh
[58:14] from the land. And he sat down and
[58:17] taught people out of the ship. Now when
[58:20] he had left speaking, he said unto
[58:23] Simon, "Launch out into the deep and let
[58:26] down your net for the drought." And
[58:29] Samuel answered and said unto him,
[58:31] "Master, we have toiled all night and
[58:34] have taken nothing. Nevertheless, at thy
[58:38] word, we will cast down the net." Let's
[58:40] just bow our heads. Gracious father,
[58:43] your word is life to us. We come at this
[58:46] moment, Lord, and where we have opened
[58:47] our Bibles and read. The scripture says,
[58:50] even your prophet will say that any man
[58:52] can read the Bible. Any man can read of
[58:54] it, but it takes you and the Holy Spirit
[58:57] to give the very revelation of it. We
[58:59] ask that you would take it, Father, and
[59:01] you would expand the word to our hearts,
[59:04] Lord, that it will be you speaking and
[59:06] not me, Lord. We commit it to you and
[59:08] ask in the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:09] Christ. Amen. God bless you. May be
[59:11] seated.
[59:15] Amen. I I I just want to say on the
[59:17] outset as believers I believe that the
[59:21] word means a lot to us. Uh the word
[59:25] brings faith to our hearts and the word
[59:29] uh is is to the sons and the daughters
[59:33] of God. They love the word of God. But
[59:36] when say that the Holy Spirit feeds on
[59:38] the word when we hear the word there is
[59:41] something within within us. We are build
[59:44] to actually desire to hear from the word
[59:46] of God. The word of God is life and it's
[59:50] our bloodline. It's our heartbeat. And
[59:53] and without the word there's no life.
[59:56] But whenam will say uh even Jesus will
[59:59] preach and they will say that that the
[1:00:01] man will uh live not of bread alone but
[1:00:04] by every word that comes out of the
[1:00:06] mouth of God. You will find out that
[1:00:09] just the same as this natural body will
[1:00:11] need water. We'll need food and we'll
[1:00:14] need to be taken care of. Our spiritual
[1:00:16] self will need the word of God in order
[1:00:18] for us to grow. Without the word,
[1:00:21] there's no life. We need the word and
[1:00:23] it's by the word of God that we live. In
[1:00:25] fact, I'll say even everything we see
[1:00:28] around us, the trees and the sun and the
[1:00:30] moon is the word of God come to be
[1:00:33] manifested. So without the word, there's
[1:00:35] no life. the word barren will say and
[1:00:38] and I just want to put a summary here
[1:00:41] because I couldn't really read all the
[1:00:43] quotes so I'll give you this oneliners
[1:00:45] you can write down and then go go go
[1:00:47] check them if you would like to but when
[1:00:49] I will say that the word is god himself
[1:00:52] giving himself to the believer so when
[1:00:55] we when we and I the reason why this is
[1:00:58] important because we live in the time
[1:01:01] where we have so many theologian and the
[1:01:04] word is become when we say the word.
[1:01:06] Often time there's a confusion because
[1:01:10] there are those that look at the Bible
[1:01:12] which is the record of the word and
[1:01:17] and not understanding that there's
[1:01:19] actually this is the word of God. In
[1:01:21] other words, somebody spoke it and this
[1:01:23] is the record of it. The the the word
[1:01:26] the scripture will say in the beginning
[1:01:28] was was was the word and the word was
[1:01:30] with God and the word was God. So God
[1:01:34] the first form that he took after he was
[1:01:36] the spirit that cover all time and space
[1:01:39] and he hover over the water the over the
[1:01:41] the water. The scripture says that the
[1:01:43] form that he took was the word the logos
[1:01:47] and that was the creative power of God.
[1:01:50] Everything that existed came from the
[1:01:53] logos. So when we hear the word of God,
[1:01:56] let's not look at the letter itself, but
[1:01:59] understand that there's the creative
[1:02:01] force that's actually coming out of it.
[1:02:03] When you receive the word of God, you
[1:02:06] are receiving the creative power of God
[1:02:09] that can actually change you, that can
[1:02:12] change your life and bring you into the
[1:02:14] condition that God desires for you to
[1:02:16] be. So but but when it says the word is
[1:02:19] God himself giving himself to the
[1:02:21] believer. When you receive the word of
[1:02:24] God, it's God that you are receiving.
[1:02:27] It's not man's idea. But says heaven and
[1:02:30] earth will pass away and but the word
[1:02:32] will never pass away. Why? Because the
[1:02:35] the the heaven was created and earth is
[1:02:39] all time and space. But the word is the
[1:02:41] only thing that's eternal.
[1:02:44] The word is the believer's absolute. So
[1:02:48] when when you encounter something in
[1:02:50] your life, when you're going through a
[1:02:52] situation, when you come to the word of
[1:02:54] God, when the word speaks about your
[1:02:57] condition, the word to the believer is
[1:03:00] the absolute. The symptoms don't matter.
[1:03:03] Whatever the doctor says don't matter.
[1:03:05] Whatever is happening at that time, once
[1:03:08] you already heard the word of God, the
[1:03:10] rest doesn't matter. you might as well
[1:03:12] go home and rejoice. Why? Because if God
[1:03:16] spoke, the scripture says God cannot
[1:03:18] lie.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; His word is the truth. His word is the
[1:03:23] absolute. And let me say this before I
[1:03:26] move on. The word is the only thing that
[1:03:29] would provide permanent change.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; All the other changes are temporal. You
[1:03:35] know, you look at politics today, one
[1:03:37] will come, oh, we got to do this to be
[1:03:39] better. the one the another will come
[1:03:40] and reverse whatever it it's. It's so
[1:03:43] amazing. You know, we live in a country
[1:03:45] back home, you know, laws that were made
[1:03:48] years ago and that you think this can
[1:03:50] never be changed again, but you have a
[1:03:52] certain group of people in power, they
[1:03:54] come and they reverse all of it. Things
[1:03:56] that were put in place to protect the
[1:03:58] people, to do things and one party will
[1:04:00] come and reverse everything. So there's
[1:04:03] nothing permanent on the face of the
[1:04:04] earth. Even the change that you get on
[1:04:07] earth is only temporal. The only
[1:04:09] permanent change in your life will come
[1:04:12] from the word.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Once you once you've been healed, you've
[1:04:15] been healed forever. Once you've been
[1:04:17] changed, you've been changed forever.
[1:04:19] It's not a temporal change. Why? Because
[1:04:22] God is the real God and is the only one
[1:04:25] that can provide true change. So the
[1:04:27] word is the seed of all seed. The
[1:04:30] prophet will speak in uh the spoken word
[1:04:33] is the original life. So when you
[1:04:35] receive the seed of God, it will grow
[1:04:38] and produce the fruits of what God
[1:04:41] intended for you to produce.
[1:04:44] The word say it will not go void until
[1:04:48] it returns that which he was spoken for.
[1:04:51] If you want results, take the word of
[1:04:53] God.
[1:04:55] If you want true change in your life,
[1:04:57] take the word of God. Take whatever the
[1:04:59] word is saying. Don't take what men men
[1:05:02] you know they they have 10 steps program
[1:05:04] two-step program 20step program and
[1:05:07] after you finish the program there's
[1:05:09] another program that you got to go
[1:05:11] through but once you take the word of
[1:05:13] God butam says you find an example of
[1:05:16] what God did in the Bible because if God
[1:05:19] has ever done one thing one way is
[1:05:22] obligated to do it the same every time.
[1:05:26] If if you stood and and you were uh sick
[1:05:30] and you were afflicted and you were in a
[1:05:32] certain condition and you needed the
[1:05:34] Holy Ghost, you needed healing, you
[1:05:36] needed whatever, you needed whatever you
[1:05:38] needed from God. And you can find an
[1:05:40] example in the Bible, you might as well
[1:05:43] stand there and jump and be happy and
[1:05:47] know that you've stood up on your
[1:05:48] absolute because if God has ever done
[1:05:51] one thing one way, he cannot change. But
[1:05:54] whenam says God is not respector of
[1:05:57] people. God is respector of his own
[1:06:00] word. Once he's spoken, he cannot change
[1:06:03] it.
[1:06:05] The word is the only thing that will
[1:06:08] bring the change that we need. He says,
[1:06:11] "My word is spirit and life." When you
[1:06:14] receive it, you've received the spirit
[1:06:17] and the life of God. So, as we look at
[1:06:20] the scripture we just read, um perhaps I
[1:06:24] will uh pick a a very strange title and
[1:06:27] I I I pray you you just follow me for a
[1:06:31] little bit and and you will see where
[1:06:33] this came from. Um and and and I want to
[1:06:37] call it a view from another camera. A
[1:06:40] view from it from another camera. and
[1:06:43] and butam I can't I can't I will let you
[1:06:47] know what message I got this from as we
[1:06:49] go along. I I can't see it right now. uh
[1:06:54] will use the story and will say um it
[1:06:57] must have been uh like a Monday, you
[1:07:00] know, and and Jesus uh here it was a
[1:07:03] young preacher uh walking towards the
[1:07:06] shores of Galilee and walking towards
[1:07:09] the shore there where people went to
[1:07:12] market and work and different things.
[1:07:14] And he was just a young preacher and and
[1:07:17] he was concerned about the souls of men
[1:07:20] and he will go out and and and no doubt
[1:07:24] the prophet will say he stayed away from
[1:07:26] rich neighborhood because they were not
[1:07:29] interested and there was nothing in them
[1:07:30] to pull. There was nothing in them that
[1:07:33] actually they feel like they had all
[1:07:35] that they had need of and they had
[1:07:37] desire for nothing. Kind of like the
[1:07:39] time we live in. They are filled with
[1:07:41] good and they have the money and they
[1:07:43] feel they don't need the gospel. So he
[1:07:45] will go and find where the fishermans
[1:07:48] were, the peasants and the people that
[1:07:50] you would consider low class and and
[1:07:52] those people that didn't have much and
[1:07:55] there were people that were in need. And
[1:07:57] and I want to say this, the word of God
[1:07:59] always comes to those that are in need.
[1:08:02] that that's why we we we when we come to
[1:08:04] church and when we in this life, we know
[1:08:07] that there's only one that can meet our
[1:08:09] need and that's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:11] We we don't show up as a know-it-all or
[1:08:14] or as people that have gotten all
[1:08:16] together. We know that as long as we are
[1:08:18] here, we need his grace. We need his
[1:08:21] mercy. We need we need him to lead us,
[1:08:24] to guide us. We need him to see. Without
[1:08:27] him, we can't see. We live in the dark
[1:08:29] generation, my brother, my sister. It's
[1:08:32] constantly getting darker and darker.
[1:08:35] It's funny. You can look and say, you
[1:08:37] know, 10 years we thought it was bad,
[1:08:39] but you look at 10 years today, it's
[1:08:41] worse than it ever was. And we have a
[1:08:43] promise that it's never going to get
[1:08:45] better. It's going to get worse and
[1:08:46] worse as we move along. So he would come
[1:08:49] and he would uh uh come to those as the
[1:08:51] scripture will say the gospel came to
[1:08:54] those that were hungry and those that
[1:08:57] were poor h uh but but poor the poor of
[1:09:01] this world but rich in faith and he will
[1:09:03] reveal himself to those that are
[1:09:05] actually looking for him. Those that
[1:09:08] desire him, those that have needs and
[1:09:10] and they know that he's the only one
[1:09:12] that can meet the need. And and Jesus
[1:09:14] will always find those. And he had a way
[1:09:17] to find those lost seed of Abraham. And
[1:09:20] because remember he said that I came for
[1:09:23] the lost seed of Abraham. He somehow
[1:09:25] just knew where to meet them.
[1:09:29] He just he just no matter what was going
[1:09:31] on, he knew exactly where to meet them.
[1:09:34] Let me say this. The word knows where to
[1:09:36] meet you.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Where wherever you are. You may say,
[1:09:39] "Well, I I I live in a remote place. You
[1:09:42] know, I live in a place where not too
[1:09:44] many." The word knows where to meet you.
[1:09:47] He he he he he knows uh every elect
[1:09:51] where they are. He knows the condition
[1:09:53] and and and and God has not lost the
[1:09:57] control. He knows everything and and he
[1:09:59] knows exactly what to meet and what to
[1:10:02] do for your need today. It says he came
[1:10:04] and he came unto he said in the
[1:10:07] scripture come unto me that are levy
[1:10:09] laden and I shall give you rest. So as
[1:10:12] he will show up the scripture will say
[1:10:14] he will start preaching and talking and
[1:10:17] and and somehow when he opened his mouth
[1:10:19] and he begins to preach the scripture
[1:10:22] will say precious words came out of his
[1:10:25] mouth.
[1:10:27] Precious word was flowing out of him.
[1:10:29] The prophet said one place he said he
[1:10:32] never had wasted words.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Everything he spoke he spoke for a
[1:10:37] purpose. Paul was one such that he just
[1:10:40] knew exactly no matter what you were
[1:10:43] going through, he knew the exact
[1:10:45] phrasing and and how to say it so it
[1:10:48] will touch the heart. Let me say this.
[1:10:50] The word didn't come for the unbeliever.
[1:10:53] The word came to the believer because he
[1:10:55] said in his word that my sheep hears my
[1:10:58] voice and other they will not follow.
[1:11:01] The reason why it's touching your heart
[1:11:02] tonight is because he knew how to speak
[1:11:05] to you this tonight.
[1:11:09] and and and when they're heard they will
[1:11:11] begin something within their heart begin
[1:11:14] to be attracted to him and they would
[1:11:16] the word the scripture will say they
[1:11:18] press unto him so they can hear more of
[1:11:21] what he was talking about. It's funny
[1:11:23] today we live in a time where we have
[1:11:25] more access to the message than we've
[1:11:27] ever had. We have more access to the
[1:11:30] word of God than we've ever had. But yet
[1:11:32] people are not they are not attracted to
[1:11:34] it anymore. We live in the time where
[1:11:37] people are asking where's the sign of
[1:11:39] his coming? They they do all kinds of
[1:11:41] things and they go about their own lives
[1:11:43] and not paying any attention to what the
[1:11:46] word is calling them to. But there are
[1:11:49] those that will hear the voice and and
[1:11:52] just like they heard the voice in that
[1:11:54] time, there are those that are hearing
[1:11:56] his voice of Malachite for tonight and
[1:11:59] they are being attracted to it. Why?
[1:12:02] because they are build with something in
[1:12:04] their hearts to be attracted to that.
[1:12:06] And brother will say this
[1:12:10] now this is in the message at thy word
[1:12:14] preaching July 8 1953
[1:12:18] he says now let's change the camera just
[1:12:23] a moment in our minds
[1:12:26] look sitting up there on this stump or
[1:12:29] this old chunk along the side of the
[1:12:32] seashore I see Peter sitting up there
[1:12:35] James and sons of Zebedee sitting up
[1:12:39] there and they had fish all night.
[1:12:41] Discouraged.
[1:12:42] Any of you fishermanmen knows what it is
[1:12:45] to fish all night and don't catch
[1:12:48] nothing. It's really discouraging.
[1:12:51] Now I want you to think. Now let me if I
[1:12:54] could just paint you the scenery. This
[1:12:56] was their business. This is how they
[1:12:58] made the money. This is how they fed
[1:12:59] their families. This is how they got
[1:13:01] money to build the boats. and and no
[1:13:04] doubt that perhaps they had taken a loan
[1:13:06] to build the boats and and and and w
[1:13:09] with a mind that if when they catch fish
[1:13:12] and sell the fish, they'll be able to
[1:13:13] get some money so they can pay for the
[1:13:15] loans that they'll be able to take care
[1:13:17] of their families. But here they are
[1:13:20] stuck in a place where they went and
[1:13:22] fished all night, tried everything that
[1:13:25] they know and didn't come up with
[1:13:26] anything.
[1:13:28] This is the condition that they were in.
[1:13:30] And they will say, "So they washed off
[1:13:33] their net and they hang them dry." And
[1:13:36] there they are sitting on the stump. And
[1:13:38] some of them say, "Well, that comes
[1:13:41] there comes that guy, that preacher.
[1:13:43] Let's see what he's got to say." And I
[1:13:45] see this old apostle and and and and
[1:13:48] this chunk and sit down. And and after a
[1:13:51] while, he began to listen. There's
[1:13:53] something a little different about that
[1:13:56] fellow. He moved this chunk and just a
[1:13:58] little clo a little bit closer. And
[1:14:00] after a while, he's standing right up
[1:14:03] against him. There is something about
[1:14:06] him that draws men to him. Let me tell
[1:14:10] you this. It don't matter what's going
[1:14:12] to when he opens his mouth to speak,
[1:14:15] something will be drawn. And now, if I
[1:14:17] could just paint a picture for you.
[1:14:19] Yeah, they are. They have done all of
[1:14:21] this and they have fish all night and
[1:14:23] they didn't catch anything. But that
[1:14:26] didn't stop them from going and hearing
[1:14:28] the word of God. That didn't stop them
[1:14:31] from saying, "Well, you know what? We'll
[1:14:33] go try again. We'll go." When they heard
[1:14:35] this young man preaching, something
[1:14:37] within their heart began to be attracted
[1:14:40] to the word. They left what they were
[1:14:42] doing, they pushed in and and they got
[1:14:44] even closer for them to hear the word of
[1:14:47] God. And and the said, "But regardless
[1:14:50] of what was going on, it never stopped
[1:14:52] them from coming. They never it never
[1:14:55] stopped them from coming to hear this
[1:14:57] rabbi." Let me say this. Don't let the
[1:14:59] condition that you find yourself. It
[1:15:02] don't You don't come to church just when
[1:15:03] you feel well. You don't come to church
[1:15:05] just when you feel like you up. I don't
[1:15:07] care what condition you are in. You come
[1:15:10] to hear the word of God. The Lord will
[1:15:12] speak to you.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; He knows your condition. Let me say
[1:15:15] this. What happened to you back there or
[1:15:18] what happened to you before you come to
[1:15:19] church? It's not unknown to him. He
[1:15:22] knows exactly. And he has something to
[1:15:24] answer to the need that you have.
[1:15:28] He came and he borrowed a boat and and
[1:15:31] he would borrow a boat and after that he
[1:15:34] has done preaching and he came and he
[1:15:36] asked Peter he said now take your boat
[1:15:39] and I want you to launch out. Now he now
[1:15:42] that he had left speaking and said unto
[1:15:44] Simon Peter it says launch into the deep
[1:15:48] and let the net for a drought. And Simon
[1:15:52] Peter answering the MSM, "Master, we
[1:15:55] have toiled all night and have taken
[1:15:58] nothing. Nevertheless, at thy word, I
[1:16:02] will cast down the net." My brother, my
[1:16:04] sister, let me just paint it just for
[1:16:06] you. Peter was a professional fisherman.
[1:16:11] Peter from his youth, as you read the
[1:16:13] story, he fished. That's what he knew.
[1:16:16] He knew nothing better than fishing.
[1:16:18] They grew up by the seashore. They they
[1:16:21] as the young people they went and they
[1:16:23] fished. That's what they did for their
[1:16:24] whole life. And the area they will talk
[1:16:28] about how they knew techniques about
[1:16:30] fishing and how they knew uh uh when the
[1:16:33] mood is at the certain place and the
[1:16:35] certain sides and everything how the
[1:16:37] what way the fish will be and
[1:16:39] everything. But all of that they knew
[1:16:42] all of that information that were with
[1:16:44] them. They went and fished. They didn't
[1:16:46] catch anything. But here comes this
[1:16:49] young master and tell him go and cast
[1:16:53] down thy net again and you will see. So
[1:16:56] Peter as a fisherman he was trying to do
[1:17:00] Jesus is calling him at this moment to
[1:17:03] do something that was contrary to his
[1:17:06] own mind.
[1:17:08] Something that was contrary to his
[1:17:10] training. Something that was contrary to
[1:17:13] every senses of his body. every
[1:17:16] understanding that he had until then.
[1:17:19] But here he is now. He's no longer doing
[1:17:22] it because he understood what he was
[1:17:24] doing, but he's doing it because he had
[1:17:27] received a commandment to do the word of
[1:17:29] God. And by doing the commandment of
[1:17:32] God, they caught more fish than they
[1:17:34] could handle.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? So it's not
[1:17:40] about our understanding of what God is
[1:17:42] asking us, but it's our faith in the
[1:17:45] what has been told to us. Because let me
[1:17:48] say this, if the word of God answer to
[1:17:51] the needs in the past, the word of God
[1:17:53] is here to answer to the needs of the
[1:17:55] people. If the word of God produced what
[1:17:59] people were looking for in the past, the
[1:18:01] word of God is here to do the same. And
[1:18:04] yes, but when I'm saying he said, but he
[1:18:06] said, "Lord, we've told all night and we
[1:18:09] have nothing. But nevertheless, at thy
[1:18:12] word, I'm going to let down the net."
[1:18:15] Butam says this, "There you are. There's
[1:18:19] the secret taking God at his word." And
[1:18:23] listen to this. It says, "If there's no
[1:18:26] fish there, God is able to put fish
[1:18:29] there." So he did that the same that he
[1:18:32] went through that water all night long
[1:18:35] and caught he says you but look when God
[1:18:38] said put it down there and that's when
[1:18:41] they caught fish. So if God said throw
[1:18:44] down your net even if there was nothing
[1:18:47] there by taking the action of what the
[1:18:50] word is asking to do. Remember we said
[1:18:53] the word has creative power by doing
[1:18:56] what the word said the word will create
[1:18:59] the result.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Neverthe
[1:19:04] what was the difference? the same
[1:19:06] people, the same boats, the same hands,
[1:19:10] the same nets, the same water. What was
[1:19:13] the difference? The first time when they
[1:19:15] did it, they did it on their own
[1:19:17] intelligence. They did it on their own
[1:19:19] ability. But the second time when they
[1:19:21] came do it, what was the difference? One
[1:19:23] was without the word. The second was
[1:19:26] with the word. Let me say this. If we
[1:19:28] need solution for our lives, all we need
[1:19:31] to do is to include the word of God.
[1:19:34] Well, we'll get word results. When you
[1:19:37] include God, you get God results. When
[1:19:40] you do by your own intelligence, you get
[1:19:42] your own intelligence result. God wants
[1:19:45] us to take him at his word. God wants us
[1:19:47] to walk by his word. When you take God
[1:19:50] as his word, my brother, my sister, you
[1:19:53] are transferring the responsibility from
[1:19:56] you to God. You are no longer
[1:19:58] responsible for the outcome. The
[1:20:00] responsibility is upon God himself. When
[1:20:03] you take God at his word, you say, "I
[1:20:06] give up. I tried and I failed. I can't
[1:20:09] do this anymore." Lord, if you don't
[1:20:11] come, I'm done. My brother, my sister,
[1:20:14] the scripture says that an entrance will
[1:20:16] be ministering to you. When you take God
[1:20:18] at his word, you are opening a door for
[1:20:21] the supernatural to happen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; It's God
[1:20:28] wanting to walk in human flesh again.
[1:20:31] It's God wanting to make himself
[1:20:33] manifest. And the only way he can make
[1:20:36] himself supernatural manifested in your
[1:20:39] life is by you taking him at his word.
[1:20:45] But say,
[1:20:48] well,
[1:20:50] maybe tonight you might you might have
[1:20:52] seen
[1:20:54] through all you you might have been seen
[1:20:56] by through all the doctor's office in
[1:20:58] the country. Maybe you you you maybe you
[1:21:02] have been uh you have been in healing
[1:21:05] meetings and anointed meetings many
[1:21:07] times. But tonight at thy word here I
[1:21:11] come.
[1:21:13] That's the way it is. At thy word I'm
[1:21:17] going to let down the net cuz you told
[1:21:21] me if I would ask anything in your name
[1:21:25] you will do it. And I believe that's the
[1:21:28] truth. And I'm letting down the net
[1:21:31] right now at your commandment.
[1:21:35] Not at what I feel, not at what I think,
[1:21:39] but when God speaks, when his word is
[1:21:42] being presented, you walk right into it
[1:21:45] so it will manifest. But Bam says, don't
[1:21:47] be afraid. Ask a whole lot. You have not
[1:21:51] because you ask not. You ask not because
[1:21:54] you believe not. That's right. He says,
[1:21:56] "Ask and it shall and you shall receive.
[1:21:59] Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[1:22:01] shall be open." That's God's word. Now
[1:22:05] you will let down. You will let down for
[1:22:08] the drought. I see this old running big
[1:22:11] scene out the water and getting ready.
[1:22:14] And many have began to pull the net and
[1:22:16] made couple of pools. And then it says
[1:22:19] when they made couple of pools, there
[1:22:21] was nothing. And after a while they
[1:22:23] began to tug. It says it begin to take
[1:22:27] hold. It says just let it down one time
[1:22:30] and try. The little effort you might not
[1:22:33] feel much. The second the little effort
[1:22:36] you might not feel much. May go several
[1:22:39] efforts but after a while you feel a
[1:22:42] tug. Something got hold. Something on
[1:22:46] the other side of the line will take
[1:22:49] hold.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You may say, "Well, I I I got prayed
[1:22:52] for. I didn't feel anything." He says,
[1:22:54] "Well, maybe you may put one effort. It
[1:22:56] may not do much, but if it's the word of
[1:22:59] God, keep putting an effort to it. If
[1:23:02] the word says to do it, you keep doing
[1:23:04] it. You keep doing it." Because why? The
[1:23:07] the challenge that we run into is we
[1:23:09] want control over the whole situation. I
[1:23:12] want to know how it starts. I want to
[1:23:14] know the middle. I want to know every
[1:23:16] step. I want to know how it's going to
[1:23:18] end. My brother, my sister, our part is
[1:23:20] not to know the whole process. Our part
[1:23:22] is to believe. Our part is to preach the
[1:23:25] word. Our part is to obey what he says.
[1:23:28] His part is to bring the manifestation
[1:23:31] of what he said he would do.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; He will bring the manifestation. And God
[1:23:36] has never failed. If he says he will do
[1:23:39] one thing in his word, he will do it.
[1:23:42] Why? Because we believe it with all our
[1:23:43] hearts.
[1:23:45] He says, "Let's not be afraid. Cast down
[1:23:48] your net. Whatever you have need of, I
[1:23:51] want to say this.
[1:23:53] And and God wants us as his children to
[1:23:57] trust in him. Whatever you have need of.
[1:24:00] I I find it so amazing. And and and I've
[1:24:04] taught this and many times in the world
[1:24:09] we the the the requirement is for you to
[1:24:12] be able to provide for yourself. You
[1:24:15] have to be able to get a job and do this
[1:24:17] and do that and and and that's what you
[1:24:20] call maturity. That's what you call, you
[1:24:22] know, a man who can take care of his
[1:24:24] family and all of that. But when we come
[1:24:27] to God, the requirement is to do nothing
[1:24:30] except what he wants you to do is to
[1:24:33] completely be surrendered to him.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Not your effort, not your ability, not
[1:24:40] what you know, not what any He wants you
[1:24:42] to be like a baby. everything you need.
[1:24:45] Father, if you don't come, I can't do
[1:24:48] anything. Father, for my bread today, I
[1:24:50] need you, Lord. Father, for my healing,
[1:24:53] I need you, Lord. Father, for whatever I
[1:24:55] have need of, I need you to provide for
[1:24:57] me. He wants you to 100%
[1:25:01] be surrendered and completely reliant on
[1:25:04] him. So, I want to ask you today, what's
[1:25:08] in your camera?
[1:25:10] When you you turn to your own view, you
[1:25:14] see disappointment. You see, well, I've
[1:25:16] tried this and and I can't seem to
[1:25:18] overcome this and and this seems to trip
[1:25:21] me all the time. And I seem to try this
[1:25:23] and I can't get this right. And I seem
[1:25:26] to try to live a Christian life, but
[1:25:27] today I fail, tomorrow I fail. I can't
[1:25:30] seem to just keep it straight. And I see
[1:25:32] other people rejoicing and and being
[1:25:34] Christian and all of it. I seem to just
[1:25:37] never able to make it. Let me say this.
[1:25:39] take your camera off of yourself. Turn
[1:25:42] your camera off to him.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; The the the one camera was the bill that
[1:25:48] they had to pay and all of this, but the
[1:25:50] other camera was the word that was given
[1:25:53] to them for him to look at them and say,
[1:25:56] "I I want you to go back and to cast
[1:25:59] down the net." And they can look at
[1:26:01] himself and say, "From my camera view,
[1:26:04] we've done all this all night and we
[1:26:06] have caught nothing." and him looking at
[1:26:09] them and saying, "I know, but I want you
[1:26:11] to now move and do it according to my
[1:26:14] camera.
[1:26:18] In your camera, there's disappointment.
[1:26:20] There's trouble.
[1:26:22] But God is developing a picture. My
[1:26:24] brother, my sister, let me say this. The
[1:26:27] things that come upon us, God knows all
[1:26:30] about it. The challenges that we face,
[1:26:34] God knows all about it. and he's mindful
[1:26:36] of all of that. He he he looked at Job
[1:26:39] and in the situation I was in. It's so
[1:26:42] amazing because it looks like when ju
[1:26:45] when when when the enemy came before God
[1:26:48] and talked to God about Job, Job was
[1:26:51] never part of the conversation. But I
[1:26:53] want you to notice when God even when he
[1:26:55] gave his his instruction, he told the
[1:26:58] devil, I want you to touch him, but you
[1:27:01] can never touch his life. So let me say
[1:27:04] this. The the devil whatever attacks he
[1:27:07] brings at you is limited by God himself.
[1:27:11] He cannot go past whatever limit God has
[1:27:14] put is obligated to stay within the
[1:27:17] confounds of what he wants to happen.
[1:27:20] The devil is not control. God is in
[1:27:23] control. The devil only does the beating
[1:27:26] for God. But says that God will harness
[1:27:30] trouble and put bits in his mouth and to
[1:27:33] do what? To achieve the goal that God
[1:27:35] wants achieved. When it's all said and
[1:27:37] done,
[1:27:39] the prophet will say, "No matter how
[1:27:42] simple the gospel is, if Christ is in
[1:27:45] it, it will do the draw. It will draw
[1:27:48] the people." It's the greatest magnet as
[1:27:52] we talked this afternoon in the world
[1:27:55] that the that the world has ever seen.
[1:27:57] It will draw all men unto me. He says
[1:28:01] then when the crowd got greater and and
[1:28:04] he says sees him around there and I
[1:28:06] believe he knew the ship was there. So
[1:28:08] he stepped into the boat and he said
[1:28:10] Peter trust out just a little bit. He
[1:28:14] says I was I he says I want to preach
[1:28:17] for a while and a while he stood there
[1:28:19] and he began to preach and to the people
[1:28:22] when after he preached through he
[1:28:24] preached and he he borrow the boats of
[1:28:27] Simon he says listen to this he never
[1:28:30] borrow nothing less he pays for it
[1:28:37] never borrows something less he pays for
[1:28:40] it wants to borrow your flesh tonight he
[1:28:43] wants to borrow your mouth. He wants to
[1:28:46] borrow your eyes. He wants to borrow you
[1:28:48] so he can use you. He wants to borrow
[1:28:51] all of us. Why? He what? He He never
[1:28:55] borrows something less he can pay for
[1:28:57] it. And he said, "Simon, I want you to
[1:28:59] thrust up into the deep." He says, "Oh,
[1:29:03] I like to speak that on on for a while.
[1:29:06] I like to speak on that for a while.
[1:29:08] Launch out. What's the trouble with
[1:29:10] people faith tonight? We are afraid to
[1:29:13] turn it loose. There's many of you
[1:29:16] that's got faith, but you are afraid to
[1:29:19] let it loose. Your faith without works
[1:29:22] is death. Just as the body without the
[1:29:25] spirit is dead. If you got faith, show
[1:29:28] me your faith by your works. Let me say
[1:29:31] this, my brother, my sister. God wants
[1:29:33] us to act by the faith he's given us.
[1:29:37] God gave us faith so we can act upon it.
[1:29:42] The faith is not given so you can say,
[1:29:45] "Well, I'll wait until I see the
[1:29:47] result." No. God wants if you have faith
[1:29:49] in your heart. Now, remember this, faith
[1:29:52] comes from the hearing, the hearing of
[1:29:54] the word of God. When you hear the word
[1:29:56] of God and it calls for an action, you
[1:29:59] take God wants you to take that action.
[1:30:02] God wants you within your heart to
[1:30:05] follow the instruction of what struck
[1:30:07] your heart and in doing so God will
[1:30:10] bring his promise to come to pass into
[1:30:12] your life.
[1:30:14] That's what's not up to the people today
[1:30:16] in the world. Many of them have faith
[1:30:18] but they are afraid to launch out is
[1:30:20] just afraid that the virtue of or to
[1:30:24] venture a little bit and to say well I
[1:30:26] can I can do all things to Christ that
[1:30:29] strengthened me. Look at him. He said,
[1:30:31] "Launch out into the deep and let down
[1:30:35] for the drought." Oh, I tell you, he
[1:30:38] says,
[1:30:40] "The marvelous thing that I've ever seen
[1:30:43] in my life in this great hour," this is
[1:30:46] in the message, the testimony. He says,
[1:30:48] "When I get against the wall and I can't
[1:30:51] get over or under or around it." That's
[1:30:54] right. And then I trust God and he opens
[1:30:58] a way. I go through it. God takes you
[1:31:03] through it.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; When you meet against a mountain and
[1:31:07] situation, I don't know what to do. I
[1:31:09] wish this will go away. God said, "No,
[1:31:11] it's going to stay there." You want to
[1:31:13] go to the left, he blocks away. You want
[1:31:15] to go to the right, he blocks away. Keep
[1:31:17] walking. Once it's you done all that you
[1:31:20] could, he wants you to go through it.
[1:31:22] Why? Because he will be the one that
[1:31:24] will take you through it.
[1:31:26] My brother, my sister, how many
[1:31:28] situations have we ever been in that we
[1:31:31] thought, "This is the end of us. I'm
[1:31:33] never going to live past this. This is
[1:31:35] the end of me." But yet, we are here
[1:31:37] testifying of his goodness. What
[1:31:39] happened? God took you through it. When
[1:31:42] you didn't know what to do, when you
[1:31:43] didn't know where to go, God took you
[1:31:46] through it. Why? He's the He's the
[1:31:48] beginner and the finisher of your faith.
[1:31:51] If he ever started a work, he will
[1:31:53] finish the job. God is not a halfway
[1:31:56] builder. He's a complete builder.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; It says when you come out the other
[1:32:03] side, like Samson, I love this. It says
[1:32:06] then when he kills the lion, when you
[1:32:09] got out to the other side, when you kill
[1:32:11] the lion, he got the he says he got the
[1:32:14] sweetest honey that he ever eat out of
[1:32:17] the carcass.
[1:32:19] Remember
[1:32:20] the sweetest testimony is when you go
[1:32:24] through something you come out to the
[1:32:25] other side. You can tell it. And let me
[1:32:28] say this, the beauty about a testimony
[1:32:30] like that. When you minister that
[1:32:32] testimony, you are ministering life to
[1:32:34] others. Why? Because you know what it's
[1:32:37] like. You know God took you through. You
[1:32:40] know without him, you couldn't make it.
[1:32:42] And then when you come to the other
[1:32:43] side, you become his life manifested to
[1:32:47] the people.
[1:32:50] something. It says sometimes sometimes
[1:32:54] if you'll overcome something by the
[1:32:56] grace of God,
[1:32:58] it'll be one of the sweetest thing that
[1:33:00] you ever tasted in your life. Isn't that
[1:33:03] right? It says, and I know you that are
[1:33:06] spiritual, you know what I'm speaking
[1:33:08] of. The word of God
[1:33:11] is not to stay on the shoreline.
[1:33:18] If they had stayed on the shoreline,
[1:33:21] it would have been a different story.
[1:33:24] But the requirement was for them to get
[1:33:27] on that boat and to launch out.
[1:33:31] when to launch out
[1:33:34] is the caring and natural act that was
[1:33:40] actually producing a supernatural
[1:33:42] result. When you come and you say I I
[1:33:46] often even ask a question, how do you
[1:33:49] explain that you can lay hands on
[1:33:52] somebody and they will feel well? Tell
[1:33:55] me what science does it.
[1:33:58] The act in itself
[1:34:00] will not be helpful. But what actually
[1:34:04] produces the result is the fact that you
[1:34:07] obeying the word of God by doing the act
[1:34:10] and through the action God blesses the
[1:34:13] action so the result could come out.
[1:34:17] It's actually the obedience to the word
[1:34:20] of God. You come and it says repent and
[1:34:22] be baptized and you shall receive the
[1:34:24] gift of the Holy Ghost. I I tell our
[1:34:26] young people I said the but when says
[1:34:29] that the Holy Spirit is there to confirm
[1:34:31] the word. So you do what the word said
[1:34:34] to do. You repent of your sin. You go
[1:34:37] and be baptized. When you come out it's
[1:34:40] no longer your responsibility. God is
[1:34:42] obligated to give you the Holy Spirit.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Otherwise it's us doing everything. No,
[1:34:49] he's the author and the finisher. He
[1:34:52] wants obedience from us and from the
[1:34:55] obedience he will bring the
[1:34:56] manifestation.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; The blessing was not in staying at the
[1:35:01] shoreline but it was in the obedience to
[1:35:04] the word and get out of their comfort
[1:35:06] zone.
[1:35:09] Out of what they knew to be true, out of
[1:35:12] what their senses in their bodies were
[1:35:14] telling them. Out of everything. Out of
[1:35:18] all of that, they had no understanding
[1:35:21] of what the results could be except to
[1:35:24] trust in what is said.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. When we trust in what
[1:35:30] is said, that's what will produce the
[1:35:32] result. How many times I can even say
[1:35:35] this. How many times you know God you
[1:35:37] you're praying for something and and you
[1:35:40] build your own map
[1:35:43] on all the avenues that God is supposed
[1:35:46] to bless you through. You said I know he
[1:35:48] can bless me like this and I know he's
[1:35:50] going to use tap router. He's going to
[1:35:52] do this. You you you you you plant you
[1:35:55] you you paint your own picture and all
[1:35:57] of that. But yet when it comes is
[1:36:00] completely opposite of every thought
[1:36:03] you've ever thought. And yet it's in
[1:36:06] simplicity.
[1:36:08] You're like, "How come I didn't think of
[1:36:09] that?" Why? That's God.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; He's trying to show you that I am God
[1:36:14] and I know exactly what I want to do. I
[1:36:17] am God and I know how I'm going to
[1:36:18] change this. Peter had fish all night of
[1:36:22] his own strength. He's tried everything
[1:36:25] with his own strength. But one word from
[1:36:28] him
[1:36:30] was enough to change the whole
[1:36:32] circumstance.
[1:36:34] My brother, my sister, one word from him
[1:36:37] is more than 10,000 words from men. One
[1:36:40] word from him is all it takes.
[1:36:43] The commandment requires faith. It
[1:36:47] wasn't in their logic. It wasn't in
[1:36:49] their understanding. Yes, they were
[1:36:51] tired. They were empty-headed. They were
[1:36:53] discouraged. But he said, "Go back and
[1:36:56] do it again."
[1:36:58] But in obedience to that, that's what
[1:37:01] brought the result. obedience in it is
[1:37:05] what brings forth the miracle. The fish
[1:37:08] were it's not about the fish not being
[1:37:10] there. The fish were created by the same
[1:37:14] voice that said go back in that
[1:37:17] instruction was included all the fish
[1:37:20] that they could catch that day.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't in their abilities. It was the
[1:37:27] instruction that he was giving them. Let
[1:37:29] down your net. Show God that you expect
[1:37:33] some results. Show God that you go
[1:37:36] expecting a separation for my own
[1:37:39] understanding to your understanding.
[1:37:42] God wants us to show him that God, I I
[1:37:45] have no mind of my own. I've lost
[1:37:47] myself. I don't understand what's about
[1:37:49] to happen. I'm only walking by what you
[1:37:52] said at this moment, not by my own
[1:37:55] understanding. When Jesus went into the
[1:37:58] boat, the seasons was empty and and and
[1:38:01] emptiness and but yet when he spoke the
[1:38:04] word, the deep it was he was bringing
[1:38:06] them to a revelation
[1:38:09] of what it means to walk with God.
[1:38:15] Walking with God,
[1:38:18] it doesn't take a logic.
[1:38:20] It takes faith in what instructions he
[1:38:24] gives us. Peter obedience
[1:38:27] led to the blessing
[1:38:30] so great that they were overflowing with
[1:38:32] the fish.
[1:38:34] What God is asking us is to try this
[1:38:39] time by his word, not by our own self.
[1:38:43] Could they have failed?
[1:38:46] Probably that's what they were thinking.
[1:38:48] But the difference was this time it was
[1:38:51] him that said it, not them that said it.
[1:38:54] But I'm going to say this.
[1:38:57] When you say this is in a message, the
[1:39:00] greatest shining light, it says when you
[1:39:04] say
[1:39:06] great mountain shining light. Oh, sorry.
[1:39:09] I'm sorry. When you say mountain be
[1:39:12] moved and then it says and he stands
[1:39:16] still there and you say well it didn't
[1:39:19] happen. It says oh it did happen. When
[1:39:24] you say mountain move, maybe one little
[1:39:29] significant grain of the sand turned
[1:39:33] loose out of the hundreds of billions
[1:39:36] and billions tons of the little one
[1:39:40] little grain moved. It's the beginning.
[1:39:43] It's beginning to take a to take place.
[1:39:47] Hold to that faith and watch the
[1:39:50] mountain disappear. Certainly
[1:39:54] We live in the age where we want, we
[1:39:56] speak, it happens. You know, us
[1:39:59] fellowship with brother Jonathan, we
[1:40:01] speak. If you're not careful, we we
[1:40:04] build the generation that there's no
[1:40:06] endurance.
[1:40:07] There's no staying until it happens.
[1:40:10] There's no I will stand here until my
[1:40:14] change come. There's this generation. I
[1:40:17] prayed yesterday, it didn't happen. I
[1:40:19] move on. I I said this and God didn't
[1:40:21] hear me. No, it may not happen in your
[1:40:24] time. It happens in this time. He's the
[1:40:27] one who determines the season, the time,
[1:40:29] and what happens. It's not up to us to
[1:40:32] determine. You can't say because I asked
[1:40:34] and I didn't see it. No, maybe your
[1:40:37] change is coming, but you just don't
[1:40:38] know it. You left too soon. People say
[1:40:41] this message is not real. Oh, my
[1:40:43] brother, my sister, you have not stayed
[1:40:46] long enough to see what the message can
[1:40:48] do.
[1:40:53] God is not building some househ hot
[1:40:56] plant. He's looking for real believers.
[1:40:59] Like Buddy Robinson, he says, "You will
[1:41:02] come. If I don't get the Holy Spirit,
[1:41:04] you will find my bones when you come
[1:41:07] back."
[1:41:08] That's real endurance.
[1:41:11] And says, "Perseverance come by faith.
[1:41:15] is because you have heard something from
[1:41:17] God that you can stand there and say, "I
[1:41:21] will not move until it comes to pass."
[1:41:25] It says, "Thou shalt say in our hearts,
[1:41:28] disease move,
[1:41:32] disease move from my child, disease move
[1:41:35] from my body in the name of the Lord
[1:41:37] Jesus." And don't doubt. It says right
[1:41:40] there, the good germs, listen to this,
[1:41:43] the good germs take on the new armor and
[1:41:47] the new weapon. And the the enemy began
[1:41:50] to go to back up. You'll you'll you'll
[1:41:54] defeat you are defeated because Christ
[1:41:58] in the drinking of the mirror and
[1:42:00] Calvary defeated the devil and every one
[1:42:03] of his power. He strips him of
[1:42:06] everything that he had and is nothing is
[1:42:09] nothing but a bluff. He can do he can go
[1:42:12] through with it. He will do it. In other
[1:42:16] word when we say that that one word
[1:42:20] arms the germs in your body. Think about
[1:42:23] that. And he gives them power to go to
[1:42:26] war for you to defeat the germs that are
[1:42:31] causing your sicknesses and to fight
[1:42:34] them until the result has come to pass.
[1:42:41] He said
[1:42:44] God's extremity or men's extremity is
[1:42:48] God's opportunity.
[1:42:52] when when we come to the end of our road
[1:42:54] and when we come to a place where we
[1:42:56] feel God I don't have any more ability
[1:42:59] he says his strength is made perfect in
[1:43:03] your weakness
[1:43:06] when your strength ends his strength is
[1:43:09] only beginning
[1:43:13] when your ability stops his ability is
[1:43:16] only beginning
[1:43:18] when you cannot do anything God is fully
[1:43:22] able to do it for you. When you
[1:43:25] struggle, he's already overcome for you.
[1:43:29] When our weakness and our inabilities
[1:43:31] and our failures, they come and they
[1:43:33] show up is only the opportunity for him
[1:43:38] to make his strength to be made known
[1:43:40] unto him.
[1:43:42] But whenam says in fact in proving his
[1:43:46] word God will actually wait until the
[1:43:49] situation gets a little bit worse.
[1:43:53] Really? I've been calling. I've been
[1:43:57] praying. What do you mean you wait until
[1:44:00] See, God don't want your ability.
[1:44:03] God don't want to to be a confusion
[1:44:06] between is it God that got that healed
[1:44:08] me or is it really the medicine and the
[1:44:11] medication and this God wants a clear
[1:44:14] distinction within your life that when
[1:44:16] something happened you know who to
[1:44:18] attribute the glory to.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; He he looked at the children of Israel
[1:44:25] he looked at uh he he tells the children
[1:44:28] of Israel and he tells them I want you
[1:44:31] to go. It tells Caleb and Joshua, it
[1:44:34] tells Joshua, I want you to actually go
[1:44:37] and cross Jordan when the river is full.
[1:44:43] You said, "Wait a minute. They could
[1:44:46] have actually waited
[1:44:49] few months later when the river is all
[1:44:52] the way down and cross it. But God
[1:44:55] waited until it was rainy season, until
[1:44:59] the river was completely full and then
[1:45:02] he sends them over so they can go cross
[1:45:04] it. What is he doing? God wants to show
[1:45:08] you that his power is good for every
[1:45:11] situation. God wants to show you that
[1:45:14] when he has already spoken it, there's
[1:45:16] nothing that can change it. When he's
[1:45:19] already made it available, there's
[1:45:21] nothing that can change that
[1:45:22] circumstance.
[1:45:24] If we would only take him at his word,
[1:45:26] if we would only believe what he said to
[1:45:28] us. If we would only He looked at
[1:45:31] martyr, they came and told Jesus, "Oh,
[1:45:33] your friend Lazarus is sick."
[1:45:37] The Bible says Jesus instead of heading
[1:45:41] towards where Lazarus was, he went the
[1:45:44] opposite direction.
[1:45:48] They came back and said, "Master, he he
[1:45:51] he now died." He said, "No, Lazarus is
[1:45:55] not dead. He slipped." He says, "Now,
[1:45:59] let's go." They come back and and Mary
[1:46:02] and Martha, we know the story very well,
[1:46:04] and comes and said, "Oh, master, if you
[1:46:07] only been here, if you could only have
[1:46:10] made it in time, my brother would have
[1:46:13] not died."
[1:46:15] Jesus looked at [snorts] him and says,
[1:46:16] "No, your brother shall live again." It
[1:46:18] says, "I know, but it's in the
[1:46:20] resurrection day that he shall live
[1:46:22] again." He said, and then Jesus answered
[1:46:24] and said unto him, if I could just read
[1:46:26] it, then martyr said, this is in uh uh
[1:46:30] John 11 and 20. He says, "And martyr,"
[1:46:33] as soon as he heard that Jesus came, he
[1:46:35] went and he met uh Mary and he says and
[1:46:37] he sat still at the house. He says,
[1:46:39] "Then martyr said unto Jesus," he says,
[1:46:42] "If thou had been here,
[1:46:45] my brother had not died. But I know that
[1:46:49] even now, whatever thou shalt ask of
[1:46:53] God, he will give it to thee. Jesus said
[1:46:57] unto her, thy brother shall rise again.
[1:47:00] And Martha said unto her, I know that he
[1:47:04] shall rise again in the resurrection in
[1:47:06] the end time. And Jesus unto I said unto
[1:47:09] her, I am the resurrection and the life.
[1:47:13] He that believeth on me, though he's
[1:47:15] dead, though he were dead, he shall live
[1:47:18] again. What was he doing? Martha
[1:47:21] understanding of the resurrection was
[1:47:24] sometime in the future when all the dead
[1:47:26] are raised. But she Jesus is trying to
[1:47:29] bring to her memory that the
[1:47:31] resurrection is actually the life that's
[1:47:34] standing in front of you.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, it's the life
[1:47:39] that's in you today. That's the life
[1:47:41] that would raise you up. It's not
[1:47:43] another life that's coming from
[1:47:45] somewhere. You, as you're sitting here
[1:47:47] tonight, you already have the
[1:47:49] resurrection life in you.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; So, he comes and he looks at them and he
[1:47:55] goes to the tomb and he says, "Roll away
[1:47:58] the stone." And now they all looking at
[1:48:00] him because they know that corruption
[1:48:03] happens after 3 days. And they know that
[1:48:06] after that time, the nose already sunk.
[1:48:09] He's already polluted. and everything
[1:48:11] and they afraid. He says, "Roll away the
[1:48:13] stone." And he spoke and he says,
[1:48:16] "Lazareth, come forth." But one says he
[1:48:19] had to call the name because if he
[1:48:22] didn't say it, the whole resurrection
[1:48:24] was going to happen at that time.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we are walking
[1:48:30] with the resurrection in our midst
[1:48:32] tonight. The
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; resurrection is not some future event,
[1:48:36] but he's here walking with us.
[1:48:48] It says
[1:48:51] and now the word of God
[1:48:54] the written the writ that's written in
[1:48:57] the Bible
[1:48:59] his word to us this is in the he says
[1:49:04] that's written to us every promise
[1:49:09] has the same power of creation behind it
[1:49:14] that God than God did at the beginning.
[1:49:20] Every promise has the same power of
[1:49:25] creation behind it
[1:49:28] than that God
[1:49:31] word did in the beginning.
[1:49:34] If we believe it to be God's word,
[1:49:38] depend on where the seed falls. If it
[1:49:42] falls into the ground, a ground that can
[1:49:45] create moisture and nourishment around
[1:49:49] the promise of God,
[1:49:51] it will bring forth every promise that
[1:49:55] the Bible made.
[1:49:59] This word of God, same creative power
[1:50:04] than the word that spoke in the
[1:50:07] beginning that said let there be. If we
[1:50:10] let it fail upon the word, upon our
[1:50:13] hearts where we can moisture it, let it
[1:50:17] grow, nourish it, it will produce the
[1:50:22] same promise that the Bible made. It
[1:50:26] says the right mental attitude towards
[1:50:29] every divine promise of God will bring
[1:50:33] it to pass if you'll just take it. If
[1:50:37] you just look at it, take care of the
[1:50:40] word, right? Because the infinite God
[1:50:45] that spoke it, that's God's word. So,
[1:50:48] it's really not what we can produce as a
[1:50:52] human. It's what's been produced or
[1:50:55] spoken by the word. When we receive it
[1:50:59] as the word of God, God will take that
[1:51:02] word and make it a reality for our
[1:51:04] lives.
[1:51:11] He says,
[1:51:16] he talks about
[1:51:20] the three Hebrew boys.
[1:51:25] He says, "Oh, I love this."
[1:51:30] And the king had made a proclamation.
[1:51:34] This is this young man that came and it
[1:51:39] was a time where they were about to be
[1:51:41] put into the flames because they refuse
[1:51:46] to obey the word of the king.
[1:51:50] And he said that he they won't bend down
[1:51:53] to the image and he will throw them in
[1:51:56] the fierce fire. They said, "Our God is
[1:51:59] able to deliver us from the fierce
[1:52:02] furnace, but nevertheless,
[1:52:06] if he don't,
[1:52:08] we won't bow down to you."
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Now, that's determination.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; That's determination.
[1:52:16] It says, "I like that. I like that
[1:52:18] determination." And the king said, "I'll
[1:52:21] burn I'll burn you. I'll burn you some
[1:52:24] holy roll of religious out of them." So
[1:52:26] they got the old furnace hot and seven
[1:52:30] times hotter.
[1:52:32] Then it says, I see them tie their hands
[1:52:35] behind and they had prayed. They had
[1:52:38] they had a prayer meetings all night and
[1:52:41] and the next day they marched them and
[1:52:44] they came and the they walked up to the
[1:52:47] they walked up here up the road and
[1:52:49] where there was and the stone road to
[1:52:52] the furnace and they dropped off to the
[1:52:55] furnace and I can see the great strong
[1:52:57] man that kind of set up and say now
[1:53:01] we'll see how good this religion is how
[1:53:05] much whether you will take his word or
[1:53:07] not. But they had but they had had
[1:53:11] issues from they had had an issue from
[1:53:13] God and and not to bow they had had an
[1:53:16] issue from God that not to bow down to
[1:53:18] the image that of the word of his word
[1:53:22] and I can see them start that death
[1:53:25] march and the old king are roaring and
[1:53:28] the red fires and and they said
[1:53:31] you want to take it back. They said no
[1:53:35] no sir. So now they're trying to get
[1:53:38] them to recount. They said, "No sir, our
[1:53:41] God is able to deliver us from this, but
[1:53:44] if you won't do it, we still won't bow."
[1:53:47] So up the road they went and they got
[1:53:49] closer. He says, "Don't you worry. You
[1:53:53] take God at his word and the devil will
[1:53:55] turn the heat on you. Don't you think he
[1:53:59] won't?" So every time you decide to take
[1:54:02] God at his word, the devil is there to
[1:54:05] prove it.
[1:54:06] And he said, "And up the road they went,
[1:54:08] and they got further, and they got
[1:54:10] harder and harder. And he began, and I
[1:54:13] can hear Shadrach say to Mach, "Are you
[1:54:16] sure you prayed through?" "Yes,
[1:54:18] everything is right. Let's go then." Oh,
[1:54:21] on up the road. And they began to
[1:54:24] stagger from the uh instance into the
[1:54:27] heat and come and and getting closer.
[1:54:30] One more step. And they were going into
[1:54:32] into there. look like a black picture
[1:54:35] for the believer, doesn't it? It says,
[1:54:38] "Now, let's turn our camera
[1:54:42] all the time that there's something
[1:54:44] happening down here, there's something
[1:54:47] going on up there, too.
[1:54:50] I love that.
[1:54:52] I love that. Whenever something is
[1:54:56] happening down here, whatever you're
[1:54:58] going on through, heaven is looking
[1:55:00] down." Because remember the earth was
[1:55:03] created to be the reflection of heaven.
[1:55:06] The earth was created to be the very
[1:55:08] reflection. God the god of heaven and
[1:55:10] then he created Adam to be the god of
[1:55:12] the earth. So there's always a
[1:55:14] reflection. So he says let's look up
[1:55:17] there and I see what's going on. And I
[1:55:19] can see him sitting this gracely
[1:55:21] priestly ho robe hanging around him
[1:55:25] watching down a cross. And I can see
[1:55:27] this great archangel Gabriel. He came up
[1:55:30] and pulled his sword and unleashed his
[1:55:32] sword and he stand there. It says,
[1:55:34] "Master, have you looked down in
[1:55:36] Babylon?" He says, "Why? There's men
[1:55:39] down there, three people that stood on
[1:55:42] your word and they are standing on it
[1:55:44] and they are fixing to be burned to burn
[1:55:47] them this morning." And I can hear him
[1:55:49] say, "Yes, Gabriel, I'm watching them."
[1:55:53] I love that. It says, I can hear him
[1:55:56] say, "Look, I stood by your side. Let me
[1:55:59] go down there and I will change the
[1:56:02] scenery this morning. It says, I believe
[1:56:04] you could do you could do it. I can hear
[1:56:07] him say, Gabriel, you've been a good
[1:56:10] angel. You've done just what I've told
[1:56:12] you ever since I created you. But stick
[1:56:15] [snorts] your sword back there. It says,
[1:56:20] "Stuck it back there." Gabriel took his
[1:56:22] place at his side. And here comes
[1:56:25] another angel flashing up real quick.
[1:56:28] and his name was Wormwood and he had
[1:56:30] control over the water. And I could hear
[1:56:32] him say, "Master, down there in
[1:56:35] Babylon," he says, "Have you consider
[1:56:37] Babylon?" He says, "Why?" He said, "Let
[1:56:40] me go down there in the analvian
[1:56:42] destruction. Just give me the power over
[1:56:46] the water." It says, "I broke up the
[1:56:48] springs and I brought through the
[1:56:49] atmosphere down there. I can wash the
[1:56:51] whole earth over. Let me go down there
[1:56:55] this morning. I will wash Babylon off
[1:56:58] the face of the earth. I believe he
[1:57:00] could do that. He could have done it.
[1:57:03] That's right. He says, "Have you
[1:57:05] considered them?"
[1:57:08] He said, "I've watched them all night
[1:57:12] long."
[1:57:14] I love that
[1:57:16] he watches over his elect. He He's not
[1:57:20] left you alone tonight for you to faint
[1:57:24] for yourself.
[1:57:26] The trouble about it says that we try to
[1:57:29] do our own achievement and leave God out
[1:57:32] of it.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want it to work that way.
[1:57:36] What good would it be for you to
[1:57:38] overcome things by yourself? Whose glory
[1:57:42] is that going to be? God wants to help
[1:57:45] us.
[1:57:47] There is no overcoming outside of his
[1:57:50] word. Why? Because the word is the part
[1:57:53] of God that's been given to us to
[1:57:56] overcome our challenges. He's watching
[1:57:59] over his elect and is not lost to one.
[1:58:03] He said, "And every eye and and every
[1:58:05] every eye on the sparrow and I know he
[1:58:08] watches over over us as we sing. I'm
[1:58:10] happy it watches over every hour. He
[1:58:13] knows every uh he knows everything that
[1:58:15] we're going through." That's right. He
[1:58:17] watches over them all night. and the
[1:58:19] angel and that great man. I've done all
[1:58:22] that I've told you. He says, "But I
[1:58:24] can't let you go down there this morning
[1:58:26] because
[1:58:28] I'm going myself.
[1:58:31] I'm going myself." And then the prophet
[1:58:34] says, "It's a mansized job."
[1:58:38] Amen. He said, "Look, they just got one
[1:58:43] more step and they're going to go right
[1:58:45] on." Sometimes God sits still. Let it
[1:58:50] get to the last minute. You are the only
[1:58:53] one that's in a hurry, not God. He knows
[1:58:57] what he's going to do. Just believe him
[1:59:01] and he is the answer. And he says, "And
[1:59:05] the answer is on his side." He's on the
[1:59:08] answering side. Let me say this. When
[1:59:10] you believe the word of God, God does
[1:59:14] not engage an angel.
[1:59:16] He says this is a mansized job. He is
[1:59:19] the one responsible for the outcome. He
[1:59:22] wants you to know that when you take him
[1:59:24] at his word, he will come to make the
[1:59:27] word a reality.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; He's not going to send the third person.
[1:59:32] He's not going to send. That's why
[1:59:33] Trinity doesn't make any sense. Father,
[1:59:36] Son, and Holy Ghost. Who's the word?
[1:59:37] Who's going to come? No. He said, "It's
[1:59:40] my word." When you stand on my word, he
[1:59:43] doesn't send Michael. He doesn't send
[1:59:45] wormwood. He's wanting to come for
[1:59:47] himself
[1:59:49] to prove his word to be true.
[1:59:52] And I can see him come down and I can
[1:59:55] see him get off the throne and his
[1:59:58] priestly gamut drop around him. And this
[2:00:01] great majesty, he says, like everything
[2:00:03] obeys him. And I can see this great big
[2:00:06] thunderheads hanging back there in the
[2:00:09] north. And I can hear him say, "East
[2:00:11] wind, west wind, north wind, west." It
[2:00:14] says, "Come here. Every wind, every
[2:00:19] everything minds him. All but men. Man
[2:00:23] knows more about it than he does." Oh,
[2:00:26] he thinks he does. I can hear him say,
[2:00:29] "Go over to the thunderhead and bring
[2:00:32] bring him here." Right. Then I got a
[2:00:35] mission for you. Wind and waves obey
[2:00:38] him. Everything obey him. And I can see
[2:00:42] that big thunderhead roll over there and
[2:00:44] step up in the chariot and my it says
[2:00:48] reached up and got a hold of Ziglag
[2:00:51] lightning and crashed in the sky to let
[2:00:54] them know that he's the one hearing
[2:00:58] hearing them on their side. Hallelujah.
[2:01:01] I'm watching you and I know where you
[2:01:04] are cracking in the lightning. It says
[2:01:07] right then it says I can see him passed
[2:01:10] down by the sea of life and pick up a
[2:01:13] palm out of the sea of life and out of
[2:01:16] the time of Shadrach, Meshach, and
[2:01:18] Abednego step into the fierest fire.
[2:01:22] There was one standing there
[2:01:27] by their side. He says, listen to this,
[2:01:30] he was figning away the fire hours after
[2:01:34] hours
[2:01:36] of pleasure in there.
[2:01:39] The king said, "Open up the door, I see
[2:01:44] if there's in there, and I see," it
[2:01:46] says, "Though you put three in there, I
[2:01:50] see four, and one is like the Son of
[2:01:54] God." Who told him what the Son of God
[2:01:57] looks like?
[2:02:03] I tell you, when you see him, you
[2:02:05] recognize him because he's known by his
[2:02:08] nature. He's known by his
[2:02:10] characteristics. What is he telling us?
[2:02:13] When you walk into the situation,
[2:02:16] however it looks, when you step into
[2:02:18] there by faith, you will find him
[2:02:21] already waiting for you.
[2:02:24] Let me say this, my brother, my sister.
[2:02:26] There's only one that has the right to
[2:02:28] say I was forsaken and that was Jesus
[2:02:31] Christ.
[2:02:33] But the Lord Jesus fulfilled that
[2:02:35] scripture. So none of us tonight can use
[2:02:38] that scripture anymore. We have no right
[2:02:41] to say we are forsaken. He's the present
[2:02:44] help in times of need. The scripture
[2:02:46] says the name of the Lord is a strong
[2:02:48] tower. He's made himself available.
[2:02:52] So whatever you're going through tonight
[2:02:54] is here to answer to the needs. If the
[2:02:57] musician could come
[2:03:09] and I want to say this,
[2:03:13] these Hebrew children taking God at his
[2:03:16] word
[2:03:18] caused the whole heaven
[2:03:22] to come together and start looking at
[2:03:25] their situation.
[2:03:27] Them taking at his word, you had angels
[2:03:30] over here and angels over there wanting
[2:03:33] to come and and come to their rescue.
[2:03:36] And God looks at them and says, "No,
[2:03:39] worries. This is a man-sized job.
[2:03:42] This is me. I need to go." My brother,
[2:03:45] my sister, God wants to bless you more
[2:03:48] than you want the blessing. But one of
[2:03:51] them says he if you can take all the
[2:03:54] waters of the earth and put it into a
[2:03:56] single pipe and push it through, that's
[2:03:59] how much he wants to bless you and I.
[2:04:02] And the only way we can receive his
[2:04:04] blessing is by taking him at his word.
[2:04:08] He doesn't want us to go wander for
[2:04:10] ourselves. He doesn't want us to go and
[2:04:12] produce for ourselves. He wants us to
[2:04:15] stand
[2:04:17] and claim his word as our promise to
[2:04:21] know that his promise is the reality.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. His word is more real
[2:04:29] than your circumstances.
[2:04:32] Your circumstances will change, but his
[2:04:34] word won't. Your circumstances will be
[2:04:36] worse today, better tomorrow, but his
[2:04:39] word will remain constant. When he
[2:04:41] speaks, he speaks truth. When he speaks,
[2:04:45] he speaks life. There's only one form of
[2:04:48] life of eternal life as the prophet
[2:04:51] said, and that comes by the word of God.
[2:04:54] Let's all stand.
[2:04:57] And if you have a need on your heart
[2:04:59] tonight,
[2:05:02] just wanted to lay that for my heart.
[2:05:05] to you this morning.
[2:05:08] It wouldn't do any good to start with
[2:05:11] men thinking. But if we know that if we
[2:05:14] take him at his word that he's going to
[2:05:17] come to meet us this weekend. If we can
[2:05:19] only know that if I step and stand upon
[2:05:22] the word of God, he's here to make it a
[2:05:25] reality in my heart. If I stand upon his
[2:05:28] word, my life, whatever it is that I'm
[2:05:32] going through, he has the power to
[2:05:36] change it and make it conformed to his
[2:05:39] word. But whenam talks about this man,
[2:05:44] he said he came John Ryan. He came and
[2:05:48] he was prayed for and and he came and he
[2:05:51] went and he he was still blind and he
[2:05:54] came to brother Banham and he says I
[2:05:56] thought you said I was healed. Brother
[2:05:57] Bham said I thought you claim to believe
[2:05:59] the word. He said well what should I do?
[2:06:01] He said well you you've been prayed for
[2:06:03] you believe the word just go on
[2:06:05] confessing. Oh my.
[2:06:08] But when said there will be meetings and
[2:06:10] there will be preaching and John Ryan
[2:06:12] will be in the back and said, "Praise
[2:06:13] God, I'm healed." And
[2:06:16] and he it almost became like it was
[2:06:19] disturbing the service and the deacons
[2:06:20] wanted to go and you know how deacons
[2:06:23] are you know trying to put him in order
[2:06:24] and just let him you know he come and
[2:06:29] preach go oh praise God I'm healed. What
[2:06:32] was he doing? He was claiming the
[2:06:34] promise that was given. I don't know how
[2:06:37] many days that went on and but we are
[2:06:39] told one day he was you know getting his
[2:06:42] haircut in the salon and sitting there
[2:06:45] at the barber shop and getting his
[2:06:46] haircut and and now the barber decided
[2:06:50] to make fun of him. He said John I heard
[2:06:53] that you were healed. They said yeah
[2:06:56] I've been down there and I got prayed
[2:06:58] and I got healed. And it says well you
[2:07:00] know you still can't see but aren't you
[2:07:03] healed? And the moment John spoke that,
[2:07:06] confessed the word out of his mouth, his
[2:07:09] eyes come open.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Confessing what the word
[2:07:16] said.
[2:07:18] He just lined up says if God said by
[2:07:23] your stripes you are healed and you
[2:07:26] repeat the same thing that God said and
[2:07:29] I repeat the same thing that he did that
[2:07:32] word will carry out and produce exactly
[2:07:36] what are we doing when we believe the
[2:07:39] word of God we are riding on what he
[2:07:42] said
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; and if his word is a reality it will
[2:07:47] produce this reality into our heart.
[2:07:50] Let's not ride our own wave. Let's not
[2:07:53] create another wave. He's already
[2:07:54] provided the wave.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; He said that his word was good from the
[2:08:01] beginning until rapture.
[2:08:04] Let's just ride it all the way to the
[2:08:06] end. He said, "Never, ever, ever have a
[2:08:12] negative confession."
[2:08:14] And I just told you tonight,
[2:08:17] take your camera, whatever your camera
[2:08:20] tells you, before you make a decision,
[2:08:23] take a moment to consider God's camera.
[2:08:28] Take a moment, say, "My camera shows me
[2:08:33] I'm no good, and I have failures.
[2:08:37] My inabilities keep coming up. I can't
[2:08:40] do anything right." But what is God?
[2:08:42] camera says, "I tell you, when you look
[2:08:44] at his camera, you will see the perfect
[2:08:47] picture of who you are." Butam said one
[2:08:50] place, he said, "God took a picture of
[2:08:53] you not when you were 16 or 17. He took
[2:08:57] your picture when you were at your
[2:08:59] best." Where did he put it? He put it in
[2:09:02] this book. So when you read this, you
[2:09:04] are actually reading your perfect
[2:09:07] picture that he had taken of you before
[2:09:10] even the foundation of the world. This
[2:09:12] is the real you, who you really are.
[2:09:16] Don't look at the picture or the camera
[2:09:19] that this flesh is presenting. All
[2:09:22] you're going to see is failure. What
[2:09:24] does he want to do? He wants to bring us
[2:09:27] into the perfect picture of what we were
[2:09:31] in the beginning.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; If you have a need upon your heart, just
[2:09:35] lift your hand up to him and say, "Lord,
[2:09:38] you know what I have made of. You know
[2:09:40] the disappointment that I've looked and
[2:09:42] caused within myself." And Lord, tonight
[2:09:45] I want you to look at me, Lord. I want
[2:09:48] to look at you not through my own camera
[2:09:51] but the camera of your word and see the
[2:09:54] promises that you've made. Father, I
[2:09:56] want to believe them and walk in them.
[2:09:59] Because if I walk by my own sight,
[2:10:01] Father, I will fail. But if I walk by
[2:10:03] the sight that you've provided and the
[2:10:05] camera that you've provided, Lord, it
[2:10:07] will produce the result of what you
[2:10:09] want. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for
[2:10:12] your grace and your mercy. We thank you
[2:10:15] for your word tonight. Father, I pray
[2:10:17] that this word that was spoken, Lord,
[2:10:20] and Father, let it not return void, but
[2:10:23] it may accomplish that which it was
[2:10:25] spoken for. Father, that heart may be
[2:10:27] touched. And Father, that we ourselves
[2:10:30] may examine ourselves in light of the
[2:10:32] light of the word. And Father, we find
[2:10:34] out where we fell short. That Father,
[2:10:37] that we may be encouraged in what was
[2:10:39] spoken. And that, Father, we may look at
[2:10:42] our humanity and and Father, consider it
[2:10:45] none. and and take the word and what you
[2:10:47] have spoken and walk upon it to know
[2:10:50] that it will produce the result for
[2:10:52] which you have spoken it. We commit the
[2:10:54] service to you Lord and Father we raise
[2:10:57] our hands and we say come and now that
[2:10:59] the word has gone forth let the Holy
[2:11:01] Spirit come into the building Lord once
[2:11:03] again and and confirm the hearts to each
[2:11:06] heart of the believer Lord. Father you
[2:11:09] are the only one that can make this word
[2:11:11] of God reality. We commit everything
[2:11:14] that we are and ask this in the name of
[2:11:17] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:11:20] Amen. Give me your seat.
[2:11:29] In moment
[2:11:34] I sing out.
[2:11:40] Oh, and [singing] I sing out
[2:11:45] song
[2:11:46] to Jesus
[2:11:49] [music]
[2:11:52] in moment.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; I lift [music]
[2:11:59] up my hands.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I lift up my hands to
[2:12:09] the Lord.
[2:12:13] Oh, sing.
[2:12:15] [music]
[2:12:24] Oh, say [music]
[2:12:27] I
[2:12:29] love [music]
[2:12:31] you. Hallelujah.
[2:12:35] Oh, [music] sing it out.
[2:12:44] [music]
[2:12:48] Hallelujah.

[2:12:51] him tonight.
[2:12:54] Just sing it one more time [music]
[2:12:55] tonight.
[2:12:58] Oh, waiting
[2:13:02] back [singing] to you. Oh, I sing.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, and [singing] I sing out
[2:13:15] [music]
[2:13:16] to Jesus
[2:13:22] in moments.
[2:13:26] Oh, I [music and singing] lift up my
[2:13:31] hands.
[2:13:33] I lift up my hand to the Lord.

[2:13:42] Oh, [singing] sing.
[2:13:48] [music] Hallelujah.
[2:13:53] Oh, singing [music]

[2:14:14] [music]
[2:14:18] Halleluah.
[2:14:27] I love you, [singing] Lord,
[2:14:32] for your mercy never fails me.
[2:14:40] Oh, I will tell your hands
[2:14:46] from the moment that I wake [music] up
[2:14:51] until I lay my hand.
[2:14:55] Oh, I will see of the goodness
[2:15:00] of God. [music]
[2:15:06] All my [music] life.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; How many could say that tonight?
[2:15:13] Hallelujah. [music and singing]
[2:15:14] All my life I
[2:15:19] so [music and singing] good.
[2:15:23] Every breath that I

[2:15:34] I love you more.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music]
[2:15:40] Oh, and you have led me to the fire
[2:15:45] [music]
[2:15:46] in my

[2:15:55] I know you as a father. [singing]
[2:15:59] I know you as a friend.
[2:16:03] Oh, I

[2:16:22] [music]
[2:16:26] So good [music]
[2:16:29] with every breath that I am able.
[2:16:35] Oh, I will sing of the [music] goodness
[2:16:40] of God.
[2:16:43] I love you, Lord. [music]
[2:16:48] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:16:53] And [music] all [singing] my days
[2:16:56] I've been held in your [music] hands.
[2:17:01] From the moment that I wake [singing] up
[2:17:06] until I lay [music] my head.
[2:17:10] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:17:14] of God.
[2:17:18] [music]
[2:17:20] All [singing] my life you have been
[2:17:23] faithful. [music]
[2:17:28] And all my life you have [music] been so
[2:17:32] so good.
[2:17:35] With every breath that I am able.
[2:17:41] Oh, I will sing of the goodness [music]
[2:17:46] of God.
[2:17:49] I love your voice.
[2:17:54] You have led me through the fire [music]
[2:17:59] in darkest night.
[2:18:03] I know my father.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; I've known you as a father.
[2:18:09] [music and singing]
[2:18:11] I've known you as a friend.
[2:18:15] Oh, I have lived in the goodness [music]
[2:18:20] of God.
[2:18:25] [music] And all my life you have been
[2:18:28] faithful. [singing]
[2:18:31] [music]
[2:18:33] And all my life you have been so so
[2:18:38] good. [music]
[2:18:41] With every [singing] breath that I am
[2:18:44] able,
[2:18:46] oh I will sing of the goodness
[2:18:51] of God.
[2:18:56] [music] And all my life you have been
[2:18:59] [singing] faithful.
[2:19:02] [music]
[2:19:04] All my life you have been so so
[2:19:09] [music and singing] good.
[2:19:12] With every breath that I am able [music]
[2:19:18] and I will sing of the goodness
[2:19:22] of God.
[2:19:25] He knows my name.
[2:19:33] I have the [singing] maker.
[2:19:40] And he formed [singing and music] my
[2:19:43] heart.
[2:19:48] And before [music and singing]
[2:19:50] even time began,
[2:19:54] my [music] life [singing]
[2:19:55] was in
[2:19:57] his hands.
[2:20:03] And he knows [music]
[2:20:05] my [singing]
[2:20:06] name.
[2:20:10] And he knows [music]
[2:20:13] my [singing] every thought.
[2:20:18] And he [music] sees
[2:20:20] each tear [singing] that falls
[2:20:24] and hears [music] me when I call.
[2:20:31] [music]
[2:20:33] I have a father.
[2:20:39] [music]
[2:20:41] He calls me his own. [music]
[2:20:49] And he'll never [singing] leave me.
[2:20:55] No [music] matter where I go.
[2:21:04] He knows [music and singing]
[2:21:06] my name.
[2:21:11] He knows [music]
[2:21:13] my [singing]
[2:21:14] every thought.
[2:21:19] And he sees [music]
[2:21:21] each tear that falls.
[2:21:25] And he [music] hears me when I [singing]
[2:21:29] call.
[2:21:34] Oh, I have a father.
[2:21:41] [music] He [singing] calls me his own.
[2:21:49] And he'll never [music]
[2:21:51] [singing] leave me,
[2:21:55] no matter [music]
[2:21:56] where
[2:21:58] I go. Oh, [singing]
[2:22:04] he [music] knows [singing]
[2:22:05] my name.
[2:22:11] He knows [music]
[2:22:13] my every [singing] thought.
[2:22:18] And he sees [music]
[2:22:20] each tear that falls.
[2:22:24] and he hears me [music] when I call.
[2:22:33] I have a father.
[2:22:41] He calls me [singing and music]
[2:22:43] his own
[2:22:48] and he'll never [singing] leave me.
[2:22:54] no [music] matter where I go.
[2:23:00] [music]
[2:23:02] And he knows my name. [music]
[2:23:10] He knows my every [music]
[2:23:14] thought.
[2:23:17] And he sees [singing]
[2:23:19] each [music] tear that falls.
[2:23:23] and he hears me when
[2:23:27] I call. [music]
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; I love what he said. You know the way it
[2:23:36] is when somebody gets up and preaches a
[2:23:37] wonderful message, you want to get up
[2:23:39] and preach all over again. But he said
[2:23:41] all the fish were included in the word
[2:23:44] that said, "Let down your nets." See, he
[2:23:48] sees beyond the action.
[2:23:50] We have the tiredness. We have the
[2:23:53] weariness. We have the I've tried it
[2:23:55] before.
[2:23:56] We have the I've done this enough. I
[2:23:59] don't want to do it again. And what he
[2:24:01] says is if you could only see what'll
[2:24:03] happen if you'll just do it one more
[2:24:05] time.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; You do it.
[2:24:10] Paul said, "Don't be weary and
[2:24:12] welloing."
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Anybody a little weary these days?
[2:24:17] [laughter]
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; I think we're all weary whether we
[2:24:20] raised our hands or not. Don't be weary.
[2:24:23] No.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Do it one more time.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; I thought he covered everything there.
[2:24:31] I was prayed for. I'm not healed. I've
[2:24:33] tried and I failed. I believed and I
[2:24:36] didn't get the victory.
[2:24:39] Amen.
[2:24:41] Sister Brenda, how many times did they
[2:24:42] have to cut your ear before you got
[2:24:43] healed?
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Three times. 20 stitches. But now the
[2:24:48] doctor can't tell which one he cut and
[2:24:50] which one he didn't.
[2:24:52] Amen.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; The victory requires a battle.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; The testimony requires a test.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; The blessing requires a trial.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; The adoption requires a training.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's just wanting us to take a
[2:25:10] look beyond the action and believe that
[2:25:14] everything he says is for our good. It's
[2:25:17] for our benefit. There's something
[2:25:19] greater. He never borrows something
[2:25:21] unless he pays us back.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll never leave us hanging.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; It's us that leaves him hanging. It's us
[2:25:28] that says, "Well, you didn't do it in my
[2:25:30] time. You didn't do it my way. You
[2:25:32] didn't do it with my people. You didn't
[2:25:33] do it with my gifts." He's just saying,
[2:25:35] "Just do it. Just do what I ask you and
[2:25:39] watch what happens." Amen. What a
[2:25:41] wonderful, wonderful message. God bless
[2:25:42] you, Brother Billy. I'm looking forward
[2:25:44] to the next couple of services. Amen.
[2:25:46] And we can only go greater and greater.
[2:25:49] If we started this good, let's look for
[2:25:50] more. Remember, Brother Bam says if
[2:25:52] somebody gains their their sight today,
[2:25:53] we want to look for somebody to be
[2:25:55] healed, raised from the dead in the next
[2:25:56] service. Amen. Let's not say that was
[2:25:58] great. Let's No, let's say Lord, there's
[2:26:00] more for me. Lord, take me higher. Take
[2:26:02] me deeper in it. Amen. We're going to
[2:26:04] sing that song. Amen. Be it unto me.
[2:26:07] 10:08 is the one. Be it unto me
[2:26:10] according to your word. They had fished
[2:26:13] all night. And they didn't fish by, you
[2:26:15] know, reeling, throwing out, and reeling
[2:26:17] in. This was real effort.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Throwing down nets, throwing out nets,
[2:26:23] letting them go, hauling them up, w
[2:26:25] water logging them,
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; and nothing, nothing, nothing.
[2:26:31] He says, "Throw them down and get ready
[2:26:32] for the drop. Get ready for what comes."
[2:26:35] Lord, we've done it so many times, but
[2:26:38] at thy word, I'll do it. You know what?
[2:26:41] He didn't finish the verses. You know
[2:26:43] what? S what what Simon said he said I'm
[2:26:45] an unclean man after that
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; all my efforts all my trying
[2:26:53] I'm an unclean man
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; but at thy word
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; at thy word you met the need amen it's
[2:27:00] not by works
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Paul said why are you going back to the
[2:27:04] law you started in the spirit
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; now you gone back to the law
[2:27:08] come to the word and let me do the work
[2:27:11] that's what God's trying to say amen
[2:27:12] Amen. Be it unto me according to thy
[2:27:15] word. Let's sing it. Be it unto me
[2:27:20] [singing and music]
[2:27:24] according to
[2:27:26] your word,
[2:27:30] according to your promises.
[2:27:36] Oh, I can stand [music]
[2:27:40] secure. Lord,

[2:27:46] my heart, [music]

[2:28:36] upon my heart.
[2:28:41] The truth that sets me [music]
[2:28:45] free.
[2:28:48] According to your [music] word, oh Lord,
[2:28:54] be it unto me. Can you sing it one more
[2:28:58] time?
[2:29:00] [music] Be it [singing] unto
[2:29:04] me
[2:29:07] according to your word, [music]
[2:29:13] according to your promises. [music]
[2:29:19] So I can stand
[2:29:23] secure
[2:29:25] [music]
[2:29:26] right [singing]
[2:29:27] upon my heart.
[2:29:32] The [music] truth that sets me free
[2:29:36] [singing]
[2:29:39] according to your [music] word. Oh Lord,
[2:29:45] be it unto me.
[2:29:51] [music] Be [singing] it unto
[2:29:55] me
[2:29:58] according to your word,
[2:30:04] according to your [singing] promises.
[2:30:08] [music]
[2:30:10] Oh, I can stand
[2:30:13] secure
[2:30:17] right upon my heart.
[2:30:23] The truth that sets me free. [music]
[2:30:29] according to your word, O Lord.
[2:30:36] Be [music] it unto me,
[2:30:41] God will make a way.
[2:30:46] where there seems to be no way.
[2:30:53] He works in ways
[2:30:57] we cannot see.
[2:31:00] He will make [music and singing]
[2:31:03] a way for me.
[2:31:07] He will be [music] my guide.
[2:31:12] Hold me closely to [music]
[2:31:16] his side.
[2:31:19] With help and strength
[2:31:23] for each new day, [music]
[2:31:26] he will make a way.
[2:31:33] God will make a way.
[2:31:39] God will make [singing] a way
[2:31:45] where there seems [music] to be no way.
[2:31:52] He works in ways
[2:31:55] we cannot see.
[2:31:58] He will make [music and singing] a way
[2:32:02] for me.
[2:32:05] He will be [music and singing] my guide.
[2:32:10] Hold me closely to
[2:32:14] his side.
[2:32:17] With help and strength
[2:32:20] for each new [music] day,
[2:32:24] he will make a [singing] way.
[2:32:29] [music]
[2:32:30] God will make [singing] a way.
[2:32:35] Amen. We're going to sing that song by
[2:32:37] his word. Amen. 1260. Before we go,
[2:32:40] brother Vicha, I'm going to ask you to
[2:32:41] close in prayer. If you would remember
[2:32:44] the service tomorrow, remember brother
[2:32:45] Billy that he would just regain strength
[2:32:47] and health. He's 2 and 1/2 hours off of
[2:32:50] his normal cycle of time. And so we just
[2:32:52] want him to get a good night's rest.
[2:32:54] Amen. That the Lord would give him a a
[2:32:56] vision, a message for tomorrow. Amen.
[2:32:59] That would speak to our hearts and
[2:33:00] souls. Amen. We've got the fellowship at
