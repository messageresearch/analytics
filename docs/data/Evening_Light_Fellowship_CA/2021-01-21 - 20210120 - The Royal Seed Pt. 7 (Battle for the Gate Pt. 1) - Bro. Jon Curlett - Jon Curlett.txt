and we see what you promised and what you will bring about for your bride lord as we talk a little bit about that tonight lord we pray that you would just inject us lord with faith lord with a desire lord to draw closer to you amen lord may you fill us with yourself lord tonight we pray lord continue the work that you said you were doing lord and bring us that little bit closer to you we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it then god bless you if you'll turn into scriptures this evening to genesis chapter 17. then genesis chapter 17 and while you're turning uh quick update on brother abe from bc he's out of the hospital back at his home now and and uh writing sermons and things like that so uh he certainly improved beyond where he was he's got some some movement back in his left side again and that so he's slowly making his way back to recovery so very thankful for prayers and for answered prayer amen amen certainly appreciate the song service this evening it was it was good it is well in line with what we're going to talk about here tonight amen amen thankful for the service on on sunday amen god is so good god is so sovereign you know it's not what we've done sometimes we can do everything and nothing happens and sometimes you could do nothing and everything happens and then but a good service usually everybody's doing their part it's not just a minister that's prepared it's a people that have come in prepared and dedicated and sanctified their lives and men and god moves in a special way in those things and everybody's then in unity amen the preacher's not fighting the people the people aren't fighting the preacher the holy spirit just has free reign to move and we're so thankful for that amen let's let's read genesis 17 verse 19. it says and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him amen you can have your seat this evening amen tonight we want to start another portion of the royal seed brother branham when he preached on this he called it possessing the enemy's gates a couple other different ones but for me i want to call it the battle for the gate and there's a reason why we're going singular with that but amen this will be a multi-part series yet again i had way too many notes and i was really really struggling i didn't know where to go i was i was you know about two-thirds of a way through a sermon and then there was just so much more left and i said i can't i can't try and cram it all down their throats in in one service so we're just gonna take it easy here tonight try and like i said to a bit of a booster shot of faith and encouragement for us and i've got a lot of quotes and a lot of scriptures i'm not going to do so much talking but i'm going to let the prophet and the scriptures do it for me here tonight amen so just stick with me amen trusting that the lord will bless it this evening amen and then brother branham as i said he he really started with possessing the enemy's gates but this is all part of the greatest battle ever fought the patriarch abraham the mighty conqueror all those different messages because he's he's trying to he's trying to take us to so many different areas and you can't do that in one service you know and so with these thoughts you kind of have to pull from all different areas to really get the depth of what he was getting getting into amen but what we want out of all of this is not just head knowledge and it's not just an understanding in our minds of what god has said or what god has promised but we want a living reality of what he has said that's living within us amen and then we're going to cover some familiar ground here just a little bit to start i've been over this but again if anybody missed it or just to set the uh the tone here for for what we're going to do so as we went through here it says and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed that's a singular seed after him amen we know that in the scriptures it was only isaac that was to be the beneficiary of this abraham had other children but he sent them away to the east bearing gifts and then he just held isaac there alone in the land of canaan because that was the land of promise isaac was the son of promise and now god comes and confirms this to abraham and says in isaac i'm going to confirm my covenant it's not for anybody else you have other children you're going to have other children but this is for isaac and isaac alone amen and we know that from there there's the idea that there is one seed there is one line and it's not a bloodline it's not just isaac's bloodline that was going to be blessed because there's many in isaac's bloodline that weren't blessed we read about nabel amen he's coming down through a different lineage he's coming down through through the israelite line but he's a dog right he's he's a crude man he's a man that has no godliness in him we hear of even jacob's sons and how many of them fell by the wayside amen there's there's nothing in there that says that every one of them was going to be a son of god but he said in isaac is where i'm going to bless the line regardless amen and we know that that's a part of us then that it's a spiritual lineage not just a natural lineage and if we can find ourselves in there then we know that the blessings are for us amen genesis 22 it continues and now this is god expanding on the covenant and this is where we start talking about possessing the gates of the gate of the the enemy and verse 15 says and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son this is right after he put isaac on the altar right and so he's got the promise in front of him and god says kill the promise take the life of the promise and abraham we know prophesy before he ca he went up on the mountain he said i will return with the with my son with the lad god had told me he was going to kill him but he knew that the promise had to be fulfilled and so he was willing to take his life knowing that god would have to raise him up if indeed he did kill him amen amen and now the angel says he called out the second time so he told him to kill him and now he calls out second time says don't do it or the first time he says don't do it and then he says because you've done this thing and haven't held withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sandwiches upon the seashore and thy seed singular shall possess the gate singular amen of his enemies plural there's only one gate but there's many enemies you'll notice and as we get we won't get into it so much this service but in the coming services whenever i'm up here next we'll talk about why that's a single gate amen there's many enemies that come against us and we're going to conquer them but there's a single gate that has to be overcome and when that gate is overcome everything else falls by the wayside he says and in thy seat against singular shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice and then so this again is talking about a particular lineage and this is the royal seed that he's talking about it was interesting when i was studying for this and you look at the con the the the mentions of royal seat by brother branham and the vast majority of them are after 63. he's talking about the opening of the word he's talking about the title d being read and taken and read now and all of a sudden he starts talking about the royal seed more and more and more because it's being quickened to them what this means what this means to be a member of the of the faithful abraham seed amen so isaac receives now an expansion of the covenant he doesn't just have a blessing now but god says you're going to possess the gate of every single one of your enemies they will not be able to hold their own place they will not be able to hold anything that you claim ever you will stand in the gate and you will possess everything that they have tried to come against you with amen amen this is not just for isaac again this is not just talking about the the natural kingdom but this is talking about the spiritual canaan and this is talking about the bride of christ and that she's got a place where she's going to have to stand and hold back when the enemy comes in to take a possession back from her listen to what brother branham says this was a beautiful opening prayer in possessing the enemies gates in 59 he says and now father god we would not only pray for these here but for those stretched out across the world that are needy both spiritually and physically give to them o lord the desires of their hearts because thy children are struggling in these days the oppression of the enemy is so strong but thou art stronger for it is written greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and he says by this we overcome amen greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and when we get into the next portion of this series and in the next couple weeks or whatever we'll understand what it means to say greater is he that's in you and why it says in you amen and then why he says and that's how we overcome by this we overcome again i'm just setting us up here i know this is very familiar for all of us but just to set us in the scriptures i'll read it quickly we've read it before it says christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law be made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that's calvary for us that the blessing of abraham might come on to might come on the gentiles through jesus christ and that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disanolather added there too he says when man makes a covenant nobody breaks it if it's written down nobody can touch it he says and now we're talking about a different covenant and it's a godly covenant and he says not to abraham and his seed where the promise is made and he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so he says the net the the fulfillment of the royal seed is in christ christ is where you look when you say what is the one that is the seed of abraham because that's the lineage that's going to track down all the way through and that's why you can have rahabs and that's why you can have these different ones pulled in is because it's not a bloodline now it's a it's a it's a spiritual line of pulling people from all places from the highways and the byways and the hedges and the ditches and these different things because there was a seed in them from the beginning and god has to pull them in even when he's dealing with the jews alone even when he's dealing with the jews alone you still see him pull in those gentile women especially from here and there and showing what's going to be coming down the road amen amen so we're counted paul paul makes no there's there's no muddy in the waters here he says you are a part of the royal seat of abraham and therefore you have the covenant and the covenant won't be broken because god made the covenant and so it's for each one of you brother brown continues he says and i'm so glad that i have the opportunity and can bring one of the greatest treasures to the people that there is in the world to tell them that we are heirs with abraham of this promise we are abraham's children and how do we do it by joining the church no by being dead in christ dead in christ receiving the holy spirit then we are abraham's seed and our heirs with him according to the promise he says don't fail to get it christian friends stay with it what he's saying is stay with what death in christ and the baptism of the holy spirit don't let a church tell you something different don't let some denomination try and pull you and say if you do this or you do that then you're saved and you're a member of the bride or you're a member of the church he's saying stick with the holy spirit stick with staying dead in christ and let that take you all the way through so we know that christ was the royal seed amen he was the one that received everything but we also know that isaac was a type of christ isaac was the one that was going to receive the benefit of abraham's faith right of abraham's promises from god in these different things brother bram talks about isaac here and he says now there's three comings of the lord the lord jesus came first to redeem his bride he comes second to receive his bride he comes third with his bride see he don't come on the earth in the next coming we're just caught up to meet him in the air see the beautiful story of rebecca and how that she got on the camel and went to meet isaac with eleazier and isaac being the type of christ the son of god which he was the son of abraham who fell heir to all of abraham's goods and all that he had because christ is there to all things he says isaac's the type of christ because isaac is the beneficiary isaac is the one that has the inheritance abraham didn't get it isaac was the one that had that that had the continuation through him now listen here he says he was out in the field in the evening time not in the morning not in the afternoon but in the evening time he's walking through the field he's meditating the scripture says wandering around out in the field when he saw the beautiful rebecca coming on the camel now brother brown says oh my that just makes chills go through me now why does that make chills go through brother branham it's just a story of isaac and rebecca in the evening time but there's a different isaac and rebecca that we're talking about now because brother adams brother ram love to paint a picture he loved to tell you why this is important to you and he loved to throw you into that picture so that you'd understand why this is in the scripture in the first place amen so he's saying this isn't about isaac and rebecca what i'm talking about here is not about isaac and rebecca he says it's about you you have to see yourself in the story you have to see yourself in the place that christ wants you to remember he said if you can't see christ in every book in every page of the bible then reread it again but if you can see christ then you have to see how that ties into you as well and then you've got to be able to see yourself in the book of the bot in the books of the bible not just in revelation or these different ones or in the new testament but you've got to see yourself all the way through because if christ is there then the bride is going to have to be typed right there along with them amen so we want to see ourselves in the story so he gets chills as he thinks about eliezer coming back with rebecca on the camel and then isaac sees her and he says oh that just puts chills through me and i was studying this just in there really quick and it just came to me and i didn't have time to throw it in there but i'll read it out to you and this is in genesis 24 if you'll just turn there quickly genesis 24. just a few pages forward because brother branham says i get chills going through me when i'm thinking about this isaac and rebecca story because brother branham sees himself very clearly in what's happening now right he understands what's going on and he's got a place in it but this struck me when i read this this is abraham this is this is eleazar talking about what abraham said to him before he left so now genesis 24 37 it says and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell and then he's got a peculiar bride to take out of a different people but thou shalt go unto my father's house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son so abraham says you can't just take it from anybody don't take it out of the canaanites take it out of my bloodline take it out of the chosen people and i said to my master pear adventure the woman will not go with me he understands women well they might not go they might not say yes she might not want to go with me now listen to what now this is this is him relaying what abraham said to him and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my father's house we know brother brandon was the eleazar here and it says i will send my angel before thee to do what to prepare the situation so that the bride is going to recognize what's going on she's going to recognize this messenger she's going to accept what he has to say and then she'll come away without knowing anything really about this man except what the messenger says but the angel goes to prepare the way and the angel is beside him and brother branham would say he'd always bring the people from the right why angel of the lord standing right there and preparing the way right setting the people's hearts performing signs and wonders proving the riches of the father in heaven that was calling a bride for his child amen calling the bride for christ amen amen hallelujah it's so beautiful when you see this i mean we we talk so much about other people and we talk about christ and all these things but when you can see what he's doing here to reinforce to the bride i've made a way i've made a way i've got an idea here and i'm going to make it go all the way through nothing's going to stop it and i've thought about you way before i ever called you out of a people amen we're talking about way before he's just calling the jews here and he's already telling the gentile bride i've got a place for you in this and i'm going to call you and i'm going to send an angel to you and i'm going to prepare the way so that you'll accept me when i come in your place amen amen we see then that christ he conquered everything this is what he was talking about here with christ and and he he says you know he conquered everything there was nothing he faced that he didn't conquer and he comes as the mighty conqueror and he takes the bride as the mighty conqueror and then he comes back with her and they conquer everything on you know everything's put under their feet for the millennium and these different things amen but it's interesting how we think that christ had an edge on us and somehow that means he didn't have to go through the things that we do and then he comes through and he has a body that's without sin and that's the only advantage that christ had but he still was tested in every way that we were amen i'm going to read some scriptures i'm going to read some quotes here to kind of set this a bit because i want us to understand that he didn't just glide through because he was the fullness of the godhead bodily when he took on human flesh he had to deal with every emotion every thought every influence that we have to deal with and then being in a human body did not mean that he didn't have emotions that he didn't have you know people coming against them when they did that that didn't cause something potentially to flare up in him you know that his back might stiffen a little bit when somebody you know slighted him or besmirched his character these different things he was a man that had to deal with the human emotions that we do hebrews 4 15 says for we have not in a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities not just with our infirmities but with the feeling of our infirmities what does it feel like to be sick what does it feel like to be tired what does it feel like to be stretched thin when he died he looked like a 50 year old that's how hard his life was i don't see anybody in here that's that's 33 years old and they're calling you a 50 year old that's how difficult his life was and that's the toll it took on a sinless body was it added another 20 years to his his appearance that's how difficult it was so it says he was he was can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so that says he went through everything that we faced not necessarily the exact same situation but the temptation or the difficulty of that situation he faced every single one of those things amen and even to the point now that he didn't not only did he conquer but he gave himself willingly to those things and in the end he gave up his life willingly and then he walked right up that road to calvary and laid his life down for us amen after all of that testing out of all that rejection out of all those trials yet he could still walk up and say it's worth it to me i'm going to lay my life down willingly john 10 says therefore does my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down to myself amen in the garden of gethsemane he said not my will but thine be done he says i don't want to do it in this flesh in the sinless flesh i don't want to do it i don't want to go through what i'm going to have to go through i was telling someone the other day when when you look at that thing that says he was more marred than any man it says his visage his face was so beat up that he was no longer recognizable as a human that's how beaten jesus was when he went there and then they ripped him to shreds with the whips that's what he went through and he says i don't want to go through that in this flesh but because of the joy before me i'll do whatever you tell me to do not my will but thine be done so he says no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again amen they didn't kill him with the spear they didn't kill him with all the blood draining out he laid down his life he gave it away when it was done he said it is finished and he died what did he do he literally gave up his life gave it up amen he says i have power to take it again this commandment have i received my father for the brahman describing this he says man was refused from heaven the highway was closed there was no highway but where there was no highway he came to make one oh my the first line was demons of doubt the next was prejudice the next was selfishness this earth was covered over with lines of demon power then sickness and diseases but when he began to ascend up to heaven last night we had him coming out of hell with the keys of death and hell on his side this morning we are taking him up hallelujah when he rose he was triumphant and as he went up he broke every devil power that holds over man he ascended on high and gave gifts to men the gifts of the holy spirit he says the mighty conqueror he stands alone this morning and between him and every believer is the blessed old highway of holiness that the righteous shall walk on there's not a way of escape there is only one line cut down from glory he left the bloody footprints as he walked through the corridors of the demon powers and made a highway for us all the way through he sets this morning as the mighty conqueror he says his people are having a jubilee tens of thousands of them around the world are shouting the victory amen bloody footprints leading the way through the gates of hell to take those keys and walk up and say there's a door open in heaven and there's a path and that way is called the way of holiness amen and we can walk on that and we can go to be with him amen now remember we're talking about the gate of our enemies as we start to dig in now that's the foundation amen but brother branham kicks off in an interesting way because when we talk about conquering what do we go straight to we go to sickness and healing of sickness right we go to salvation and these different things and we talk about deliverance and demon powers and we start looking at all the miracles that jesus did in his life in his short three and a half year ministry that's where we go but watch what brother branham does here as he starts to talk about possessing the enemy's gates because he doesn't go into healing and sickness necessarily he says he conquered temptation when the enemy spit in his face smote his jaw he turned the other side when they jerked beard from his face and spit on him he never riled back he conquered the gate of temptation and took it amen so he's talking about where we live day to day he's talking about reactions to actions he's not talking about he conquer you know cancer and diabetes and these different things he says he conquered temptation to respond back in an unchrist-like way that's the first thing brother brahm goes to is that he conquered what himself he conquered the response to people that were ungodly that had no idea what they were doing in ignorance they were crucifying the king of glory and he says he responded not back to it but he continued in the path he says then you say my temper won't let me do it my temper won't let me act that way i've got too big of a problem he says you seed of abraham yes sir he conquered it for you amen he leaves us no excuse for where we sit with our genetics with the way we're built with the way we were raised the way my daddy was the way my mommy was he says it doesn't matter he has conquered every single thing that you are going to face in your life amen how by the holy spirit amen the holy spirit's the only thing that can do that in your life they talk about you know nature over nurture or nurture over nature and these different things the holy spirit sends all of those things to the side and says we can do all things through christ with strengthen us amen that's exactly what we're talking about what is it the christian is defined not by what happens to them but how they respond back to it that's what christ was showing was he conquered the temptation to do something back we've talked about meekness and meekness is what the ability to do something and not do it the the pow having the power to do something and choosing not to do it and that's what jesus had there was he was the ultimate show of meekness because he could have called 12 legions of angels down wiped them all up and said this isn't worth it i'm gone but he took it because that was his role and then that was his purpose brother band puts that right in our lap and says if he did it you can do it amen if he can take that nobody's up here ripping my beard out right i don't have a crown of thorns nobody's whipping me he says if he can deal with that and you've got the same life in you and he conquered it already then you can conquer it as well amen when he was riled up he riled not back when he was made fun of he held his peace when he was called the devil he held his peace he had one business and that's the father's business and he went about doing that as long as you weren't going to keep him from doing the father's business he wouldn't worry about you but if you stood in front of him and he was on the father's business lookout and we see him do that time and time again when things stood in front of him he'd push him aside because he was in the father's way amen but you're just trying to get him going he doesn't worry about it because he's focused on his father's business he's focused on what his purpose was amen what a perspective that gives us you know we think about these signs shall follow them but then we won't do anything about what's happening in our in our character and our nature in in the genetics that we have that keep us from you know from getting close in a relationship or that snap at our children or you know that can't hold a job or whatever it is these things we don't look at that and say we've got to conquer that we're all busy trying to lay hands on people and get them get them better but no he's saying look he he conquered himself before he that was the final conquering he did was he conquered himself before he walked up to calvary amen amen you think it didn't burn him when people said things you think he wasn't hurt when the the prince of glory the messiah was standing in front of them and they were calling him everything but that when they called him a bastard when they called him a wine bibber amen when they said that there was no way he could be it when they got his birth city wrong when they called his mom names right all these things you think that didn't have an issue in his body that those emotions didn't flare up and that didn't hurt him right he sat over jerusalem he said jerusalem jerusalem how long y'all would have gathered you to myself right what was he doing he was crying over it it broke his heart that they have rejected him and yet we think that he doesn't understand what we're going through the pain that we feel the rejections that we have if anyone knew it it was him because he came into his own and his own received him not amen brother braham says also temptation he was tempted in every manner like we were what did he do he conquered it and what did he say to us resist the devil and he will flee from you just says resist him he didn't say defeat him didn't say beat him up he said resist him and he'll flee you don't have to beat him you just have to resist him and he'll have to leave he conquered sickness for us he conquered temptation force and broke down the gates he took the key away from the tempter and handed it over to the believer the believer controls the gates now not satan handed over to the believer of abraham's seat and said if he tempts you resist him and he will flee from you oh my resistance resist him and then he's talking about the gate of your enemies he's talking about temptation he's talking about temper he's talking about hitting back he's talking about revenge he's talking about getting riled up forget about death hell in the grave and just focus on those and say what excuse do we have today amen if we will only yield ourselves if we will only humble ourselves to the holy spirit to let him come through us then we can conquer those things amen in our marriages in our relationships that's where we're going to see the the the effect of those types of things if we're in that day in and day out and if the holy spirit's not conquering that and we want to go out and we want to do the greater works i'm sorry it's not going to happen it's got to happen where you walk day to day before you want to see miracles coming let's let's focus on where we walk every day and then see what he'll do in his sovereign way on the rest of it amen amen he said on the day of pentecost he sent down the holy ghost to continue not to start but to continue through the gentiles to take out a seed of promise to give to the gentiles the offcast to give them the baptism of the holy ghost to bring them into the promise now we have a right to conquer all sickness then he says we don't have to conquer it it's already conquered we just have to claim the promise and go take it it's already conquered death is conquered hell is conquered sickness is conquered temptation is conquered all devils is conquered hell is conquered death is conquered the grave is conquered we stand in the gate taking it and don't have to fire a shot the price it's already been paid for he's pointing out the believer's position you're not here to do that battle you are not there to defeat them you're there to dispossess them you're there to push them out of your land to push them out of what belongs to you he says christ has conquered everything we face so you don't have to conquer anything else death hell in the grave so anything that comes out of hell death itself and even dying if even if you're in the grave he says none of that's going to hold you back so anything from hell that's coming against you the battle is not to defeat it the battle is to push it off your land it's already defeated and so it's now a claim of do you have a right amen is this mine or is this yours and if you can point to the word and it says this is mine then you can push him off every single time amen coming back to rebecca and the bride and men so christ conquered but we're not christ in that sense we didn't go to calvary in that sense brother brown says we were in him right and by that that that identification we go through but we don't have a memory of that we don't have a memory of that conquering of those trials and temptations that christ went through this is our trial and our temptation now is when we're in this world amen but we're the bride of christ amen we're the rebecca in that story we're not the isaac and how do we fit into that so brother branham starts to talk about rebecca he says so they called the young girl rebecca and perhaps the conversation was something like this rebecca you've we fed you and raised you to the best of our knowledge to be a virgin girl and that you are but here comes a stranger among us with some evidence that there is a rich man who's going to give to his son all these blessings do you wish to go with him now or do you wish to wait for about 10 days till you make up your mind now remember the servant said i want to be on my way god has given me good favor and i'm ready to be on my way see he sees god's moving in the situation he says let's just keep this party going right let's not stand around and think about is this makes sense or is this right or wrong it's good god's made a way let's get out of here he says don't ever put off tomorrow what you can do today that's the way the message is when it's preached you hear of a king god who his son christ falls there to all things and we've got a little foretaste of it by the holy spirit what do you think about him have you got faith in him so amen you're rebecca here and he says you've got a foretaste of christ and that's the holy spirit in you he says remember she had to choose by faith it always starts with faith i keep coming back to it you can't escape from it it always starts with faith she had never seen the man she had to choose by faith and the words of a servant brother branham showed us christ in a way that nobody else has shown since christ was here as far as we know brother brown said the only difference between christ then and christ in his time was the corporal body he said he is here in every way except the corporal body and he stood there and with that messiah sign he did everything that christ did raising the dead deserving the thoughts and intents of the heart healing the stick sick casting out demons all of these things amen he called the people out right he broke down the religious barriers everything that christ did in his first one in the second one christ is standing there in the message of william branham and he's doing the exact same thing over and over and over again what choose it by faith and the words of a servant that's the same way you'll have to do because that's the only way there is to do it god sends out his servants and they preach the word faith cometh by hearing what do you think about it that's up to you to make your choice i would advise you not to put it off you say well i have always longed to receive the holy spirit i better think it over don't think it over this is the time it's the truth i believe that god would heal me someday as long as you keep that in your mind you're a defeated person god healed you 1900 years ago he says now is the day of your decision when you hear the message that christ was wounded for your transgressions with his stripes you were healed this is the time now to believe it so god wants immediate action if you love him throw everything else aside and take him if you believe his word cast everything else away and take his word it's a time of decision you have to make your mind he's talking about a showdown amen the mount carmel showdown where elijah's up there and he says look pick one god or baal whichever one answers follow that one and we know of course that god answered by fire consumed the entire sacrifice and bale of course was sleeping because he didn't exist amen but he says you've got to make a choice and if you don't make a choice that's making a choice because he says you've got to pick and if you don't pick then that's not picking and that means you've rejected christ so there is no neutral ground here like i said if you're on the fence the fence belongs to satan right you have to be on christ's ground which is the word you have to accept what he says and what he says alone amen you can't waver back and forth you've got to make a stand on what you believe but watch the effect of this decision this is the scripture now genesis 24 60 and they blessed rebecca and said to her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them brother braham said this and rebecca which was to be the mother of this noted promised weighted son when she was called to the final test of a strange man that she had never seen before only she seen the working of the holy spirit he's saying she caught what was happening in this situation eleazar the angel of the lord's going before him and preparing away and she recognizes that this is not just happenstance this is not just a man come from somewhere and i happen to be the one that was there to to to do that work maybe she said i don't normally do that maybe she wouldn't have normally done that but she recognized something was going on brother brown says she saw the working of the holy spirit and when her parents could not fully decide whether she should go with this stranger or not to be the wife of a man she'd never seen she was brought to the final test we'll get the damsel and let her speak we'll hear from her mouth whether she will go yes or no he says that's the way it's brought to all the seed of god it's got to be your mouth god wants to hear from you amen your parents don't decide that you serve christ your spouse doesn't deserve that you doesn't make the decision that you serve christ but you have to say i will go i will marry him i have accepted what his servant said i believe that the gifts are a representation of a reality that's waiting for me and i will go and i will marry him and i will leave everything else behind he says so when she was put to the test she never hesitated a minute she said i will go i like that not let me make up my mind let me study it over she was fully persuaded that's the people that god can use when you're fully persuaded that god will keep his promise said i'll go and are people then so anointed maybe they did not know it but they prophesied as they laid their hands upon their sister and their daughter this beautiful young jewish girl as they placed her upon the camel and sent her to a strange land among strange people but there was something capital s on them they said let thy sea possess the gate of their enemy be thou the mother of thousands of millions can you see yourself there we're talking about somebody that prophesied over her that was an idol worshiper laban was an idol worshiper right remember when jacob left and they laban's following up because somebody stole his idols this is the kind of person we're talking about this is not a godly man but yet he prophesies over the bride and says the exact same thing that the lord had said to abraham already rebecca independent of isaac independent of abraham has her own confirmation of the exact same covenant to her so if you can't see yourself in christ today if you can't see yourself identify with him like we've talked about you should still be able to see yourself at least as rebecca and see that there is still a special promise the exact same promise given to abraham is given to rebecca before she ever marries amen that there's a prophecy over her that she will possess the gate of her enemies amen amen hallelujah like i said god's sitting there and this is way before the gentiles are called out and he's already said i've chosen you and i've picked you and i've made a way for you and you are going to be victorious and you're going to conquer everything that comes your way and you're going to be identified with me because of it amen it's the only way you can anyways you're not going to be a victor without christ and she couldn't be without isaac but because she made the decision the prophecy comes forth and links her to isaac completely amen even before she sees him amen romans 8 16 says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together what's he saying everything that christ has is yours yes even to sitting in the throne with him he says you'll sit in the throne with me everything's under your feet everything that he's offered me i'm offering to you why you're my wife we're one we're the same thing so we get the same authority we get the same love we get the same joy we get the same peace we get the same power in our lives amen all of it's ours why because we're associated with him because we've committed to that marriage with him amen we're anointed exactly as he was just in a little lesser way amen brother branham hammered pretty hard there on rebecca he said she didn't stop to think about it she didn't stop to dwell on it why because intellectual capacity is never going to take you towards god right we're not going to sit here and and reason and logic our way into christ right especially in this age especially in this age you're never going to get there by just knowing what god has done it meant sitting in a message pew in a message church and listening to a preacher tell you what brother branham said or reading the scriptures and the light of that message is not going to take you in amen it got not just because you know it amen but you have to know the one that sent it there has to be a reality a living reality behind it but the brown says after two thousand years has passed two thousand years and still here he is in our midst the mighty conqueror that rent the veil and two that took every sickness every disease everything upon himself and bore our infirmities to the cross and our sickness and our diseases and triumphed over them and raised up for our justification and stands alive after two thousand years to manifest himself as a living jesus christ amongst the royal seed of abraham who are heirs of all things oh my those who go through the test get the promise of the word if you can believe the word then you are also the seed of abraham that's how you came to it why amen how by believing the word amen so where does that leave us he conquered everything we have access to everything that he has he's done everything for us so where does the bride stand today where does rebecca stand after that prophecy as soon as she's married to isaac she's in the channel now to receive every little thing amen what was isaacs is hers and she has the same power and authority now with her that isaac had under that promise brother branham says no matter how little you are every devil is under you how little you are whatever little faith you have whatever little experience you have whatever little reality you have if you have the holy spirit in your life he says every devil is under you every devil is under you why our great conqueror has conquered every sin everything every sickness even death itself that's right we are more than conquerors in him so like i said we're not battling to defeat the enemy we're battling to move them off our possession because they've already been defeated they have no weapon that can be formed against us that will stand that will prosper against us and all we're doing is pushing them off of our property out of the gates that god has already given us amen amen so what does the devil do if he's defeated what's he got to do to be successful he's got to make you think that you don't have a right to the land he's on he's got to make you think that it has something to do with you rather than him right he's got to make you think that you're not worthy that you're a sinner that you have faults that you have flaws and on the basis of who you are you have no right to be where he is standing right he wants to get you looking at him brother branham continues he says he will conquer the gates of his enemy to those seed he stands here alive to vindicate himself to who those predestinated seeds that can see it he conquered that who after his test of the promise of the word they were sealed by the holy ghost into the body of christ to them confirmed what hebrews 13 8 to be so what is hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever they are sealed in there by the holy ghost that holy ghost which was by abraham foresaw it and by faith he believed it and now we receive it looking back to the promise of what he said and john 14 12 is made confirmed in these last days by the rhythm conqueror himself which john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go to my father amen that's what he said earlier he says he's going to continue the work in the gentile bride amen not some system but a person christ the conqueror not my church and again not my message church right let's put ourselves in there let's not pretend that there isn't a denominational following in the message amen don't just say because i attend here that makes it all good no individually it has to be good not just as a group not my church not my baptist church or your presbyterian methodist or the pentecostals not by that but by jesus christ he lives today he rolls over that for our justification and because he lives we he said we live also men don't by live by bread alone but by every word not part of the word right and we've got a fully open word today there's no room for ignorance now everything's been revealed that we have need of there is no room for ignorance amen there's no excuse for it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this take the gate of every enemy amen it's all on the basis that you have christ in you the hope of glory amen amen but when you start reading that title deed how many of us have ever looked at the deeds for our property you look on the deed it's very specific about what's yours isn't it it gives the location it gives the exact points latitude longitude right they have a surveyor comes in and he marks out everything and he gives you to the inch where your property is and when you can read that you can see this is all mine if it's within that boundary it's all mine and as long as my name's on the title deed i can protect that property i have rights with that property not the same as they do in the us unfortunately but i have rights to that property and nobody is allowed to come on that property unless i say so amen right and as long as my name's on that title deed then i'm good to go and anything that's marked in there or within that belongs to me and nobody else can take that away nobody else can come in and say that's mine nobody else can come in and say i have a right to that if that's a clear abstract title deed and there's no liens on it there's nothing against it from anybody else that belongs to you and the borders are clearly marked for you to say this belongs to me and when we start to read through the bible and he says every promise in the book is yours right if you can read it in here it belongs to you anything you read in here belongs to you if it is for the gentile bride and we're not talking about what happens after we get off the earth and that but every redemptive promise in this book belongs to you if you have the holy ghost amen that's what he promised to us but abraham says this he says now we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and give his life for us being the royal seed of abraham with the same spirit of god in us that was in him we are more than conquerors every great every gate has been conquered for us amen he says you're thinking about taking the enemy's gates but he's saying they're already conquered they've already been knocked down they can't be closed against you somebody has to stand in there they've been defeated and they haven't been rebuilt somebody's just going to try and stand there and pretend that they've got a place to stay that they have a right to be there the only thing we have to do is possess it it's already conquered sickness is conquered death is conquered hell is conquered the grave is conquered everything is conquered and we hold the keys by his grace then he puts it in our lap and says are you afraid to stick them in the lock what the promises and say i come in the name of jesus christ he says ask the father anything in my name i love him he says amen what would trigger you to do that what triggers you to take the promise of god and put it on your lips to put it into the lock and say you can't be here what is this that pulls us out of our comfort zone that asks us to do something supernatural like this and take our faith and put it on our lips and say lord i'm going to claim it what is it that does that brother branham says when it's revealed to you that's the answer was revealed to you you can't make it happen it's got to be revealed to you then you don't even consider anything else how impossible it is don't consider what the doctor said you don't consider what mama said what papa said what the preacher said what anybody else said you just consider what god said so where does it say in there you'll get healing when you're worthy of healing you'll get deliverance when you're worthy of deliverance you'll get love when you're worthy of love you'll get joy when you're worthy of joy there's nothing in there that has jonathan corlett written as the requirement for any of these things he did it it's a finished work and so i can't look at myself in any of this i mean if i've got a check of heaven in there it's not my name on the bottom right hand corner is it it's jesus christ for every one of them jesus christ jesus christ and it's written in his blood and so when i start looking at that and that check why would i start saying but i'm not worthy to cash the check the one that gave it to me deemed me worthy that's why i get to take it to the bank of heaven is because he gave me the check and said write in whatever amount you want and i'll give it to you and then the bank of heaven has unlimited funds amen the government of canada thinks they too the bank of heaven does right cattle on a thousand hills is not going to run out for us so if he's giving it to you if he's deemed you worthy by giving you the check then why are you saying i'm not worthy to cash the check amen it has nothing to do with you it has nothing to do with me amen says if you would realize that your sons and daughters of god by the death of christ yes no i went too far i think oh yes if you would realize that you're sons and daughters of god by the death of christ and you have a checkbook in your hand to draw any dividends out of calvary that christ died for amen that's right don't be afraid put it to work let your faith get started one time and turn it loose let your faith get started one time and turn it loose and you watch god answer that and then all of a sudden that builds up a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more and all of a sudden the next promise is rolling your way and you're saying i'll take that one to the bank right and all of a sudden you start writing checks and writing checks and writing checks why because he's giving it to you he's given it to you to write those checks amen third john verse two says beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health and all the prosperity gospel people said amen right because that's where they look prosper and be in good health but he says even as thy soul prospers right john ties health and prosperity to spiritual wellness and we've just spent three services talking about spiritual growth and maturing and john says if you're doing that then you don't have to worry about the prosperity and health because if god's growing you that means that the prosperity and wealth is going to follow and health is going to follow along we're not talking prosperity gospel with lots of money in the bank and nice cars and this and that and the other but your needs are going to be met right and now remember we're talking about children of god now because rank sinners could come up in brother branham's services and get healed because why there's a different requirement for them it's always belief you have to have faith but for them he made no requirement of are you a christian necessarily there were people walked up there with diseases that they only got by doing things they shouldn't be doing right but he they would be healed because it was a part of that ministry to give people the faith to do it but now when we talk about a child of god now we've got to deal with conscience we've got to deal with are you in your position are you on your land because if you're out there like the prodigal son right there's no hope for that prodigal son until he comes back to the father he's got to be in his place he's got to be on his land in his position but he says look if you're spiritually prospering if you're doing well with god if your relation with god is relationship with god is open and clear then you have nothing to worry about you have nothing to worry about he's got everything taken care of and i would that you prosper and be in health even as god continues to grow you and he'll match that with your growth because if he goes too fast on the prosperity and health side sometimes then we run away from our maturity and we get ahead of him man what is it when you start seeking the kingdom of god and you stay seeking the kingdom of god and he says all these other things i'll add to you everything will add unto you amen not a thing left behind he says all these things will be added unto you if you'll seek first the kingdom of god says he conquered death in hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they're of the natural seed we're all of the natural seed if we try to do it ourselves and that's what he's saying if you try and do it yourself you won't conquer that's when you fall back on the natural seed instead of the spiritual seed inside of you he says this is the spiritual seed he conquered the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification now we are more than conquerors and we just walk right into it as an inheritance again we're not walking in to battle for it he says walk into it as an inheritance you're reading the title deed you're reading the will and it says jonathan corlett has the right to the healing in the name of the lord jesus christ under the shed blood of calvary so he says you walk into that as an inheritance your name's written there and therefore you have a right to it it's yours to inherit more than conquerors now we're dealing with the defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything's defeated he says oh my i wish i was twice my size now maybe i feel twice as good we are disputing with a conquered enemy amen that ought to give us an encouragement tonight that as we deal with these things that it is a conquered enemy and all it's trying to do is bluff you out of your position and bluff you out of recognizing that he doesn't have anything to stand on he's trusting you to forget what god has said what god has done what god has promised and to stand there and somehow look at him as if he's bigger and stronger or that you are smaller and weaker amen look at yourself or see him in a light that he really doesn't have and then brother ron spencer talks about saying boo devil you know i think brother brown didn't brother brown tell the story about boo devil and the devil was talking to the man and he kept getting smaller but then he said boo devil back and all of a sudden the devil started getting smaller right where's your faith going to go is it going to go against him or is it going to go against yourself ephesians 6 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might but on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand against the wiles of the devil why he's trying to trick you right you think he comes in with force but the force is there to take your your mind and take your heart off the idea that he doesn't have anything on you that he can't do anything he's trying to make himself look big and strong and muscular and bring in as much pressure as he can so you don't look at that and say whether there's one of you or whether there's a million of you you're all defeated and guess what it's easy to beat a defeated enemy because you're already defeated so get out he's trying to get you off the idea that you stand there as a victorious son or daughter of god amen so our battle is not natural right our battle is supernatural and its influences and principalities and powers amen and the rulers of darkness of the world against spiritual wickedness in high places spiritual wickedness remember when daniel was praying and the answer was delayed because there was a battle of angels in heaven he says i was delayed we heard the prayer your prayer was heard on the first day but it took him weeks to get to you because i had to fight my way through demon powers amen it's a spiritual battle to get those answers through sometimes amen there's something else that's going against us so when we feel those things well up what is it that satanic power trying to influence us to do what we ought not to do to push us off of our ground and onto his ground because the minute we get onto his ground he's no longer defeated because he has a right to his ground and then we talked last week about politics right you start getting dragged into politics at satan's ground and you're going to get beat up there you start dwelling on education you start looking at these different things and all of a sudden you're on his land and he's got a right to beat the snot out of you because you're not supposed to be there get back on the word get back in your position as a son or daughter of god and that's where he's defeated but you start going into bar rooms trying to beat up satan look out right you start trying to do it through your tv look out that's not where you belong amen step onto god's word and that's where he's defeated amen amen we're talking about worthiness very familiar scripture revelations five and i saw in the hand of him that sat on the book on the throne a book written within and with and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and nobody said our names nobody said our names and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon but brahm says that's the lamb's book of life that's a title deed to the earth amen to the seed of god and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth to the earth amen we saw one in our age that was the seven messengers and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying who's worthy thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and hast redeemed us this is the only place we appear here thou hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and nation and people and nation if you're looking for worthiness that's the place you find it that's right there he was worthy to open that lamb's book of life he was worthy to take the title deed and say i'm coming to claim every single one of those that belongs to me amen and within that is every divine promise of god right within there is everything that he promised to us as well and he takes that down he's given that to the bride because we saw later what does he tell john he says go and take the book out of him that has it amen and he took it and he ate it he made it a part of himself amen so i didn't have any part there except to be the redeemed one right i was wasted i was ruined i was hopeless i was i was weak i couldn't do anything when we look at what's done here it's not because we had any sufficiency in ourselves but it is all christ from start to finish amen and it was god that did it it was christ that took the book and it's christ that's come now to redeem a bride amen amen brother braham says this that's the way it is today we're guilty unworthy and should die that's us guilty unworthy should die we're not worthy of living we're not worthy to come to christ we're not worthy to ask anything but god never looks at your unworthiness he looked at the lamb now if he can't find no fault in christ then you're free see he died in your stead now if there's any fault with him you're not free yet but god doesn't examine you he examines the land you say i'm not worthy to walk out of this wheelchair tonight this is in a prayer line he's talking to a man that's sitting there in a wheelchair and he's saying i'm not worthy to walk out of this wheelchair tonight that's right you're not but god doesn't examine you he examined past tense christ and if he's worthy then you can walk see that's right depends on what you think about it don't say well the doctors say i'll never be well that's what the doctor says because that's what doctors say now the man's a scientific man he looks the way nature's running and he sees you can never be well that scientifically shows him that and that's what he's looking at now if you look at the same thing you'll never be well but don't look at what he said don't look at how you're diminishing the man sitting there and every day he's getting worse and worse and shriveling up in these different things he says don't look at how you're diminishing but look at your sacrifice that's it and remember your abraham seed and heirs with him and if you are stay with the promise accept him as your healer just stay right there nothing we can do to deserve this it's all by grace amen when christ died at calvary that's what gave us the right to take this back no amen it's all by grace from start to finish but remember we're talking about children we're talking about the royal seed of god amen like i said we're not talking about some joe schmoe that walks off the street we're talking about people that god is growing and maturing and bringing to a place amen where he can trust them with everything in his word and brother banham says that there's always a trial in these things for us this is at the very beginning of possessing the enemy's gates listen what he says he says now i would like to take if it should be called a text my subject this morning first testing before promised gates and the subject is possessing the enemy's gates but he says testing's first possession second god had been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise and when god makes a promise he wants to be sure that the person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises now we just said you're not worthy and then brother brahms says he was testing abraham to see if he was worthy so when my writer was brother branham right we'll see what that means amen but this isn't the kind of worthy that we are talking about like abraham you've done so good and you've done so well and you live your life this way and you say this and you say that because when we look at abraham he wasn't worthy in that sense we covered that exhaustively before abraham made plenty of mistakes so this is not the worthiness he's talking about but listen to what brother branham says here he says so abraham had been promised through his seed that the whole world would be blessed that he would have a son and this son out of him should come forth a seed that would bless the whole earth and abraham when the promise was given to him was 75 years old and sarah his wife was 65 years old but the bible tells us that abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god now we start to see what worthiness means and god time after time tested him but he had come to that final test before the blessing was going to happen now he's talking about taking isaac up to sacrifice him he's already got the promise in hand and then god says no we're going to test you one more time to see if you'll be worthy and that's the way it is with all the seed of abraham god gives us that final test just before he gives the promise he's talking the fullness of the promise and if it was possible i'd like to say something here personally but i'll withhold that i wish sometimes he didn't tell us that because you're like what what did he hide we need to know we need to know today that final test to see how you'll react upon it and when he had given abraham this test he found abraham just as true as when he started that's abraham's worthiness there that's what he's talking about what a blessing it would be this morning if we who take his promise of healing would stand just as true as we did when we stood here and accepted it no matter what the doctor said stand just as true amen so abraham's worthiness was not did he live a good life it was did he believe and did he keep believing and even after the promise did he hold on to that all the way until god confirmed it the final time did he believe believe believe believe believe and did he change anything off of that no he believed he believed he believed and that's the same test we faced today for any promise of god amen we look at this like i said we're going to take a rapture you have to believe you're going to take a rapture and your faithfulness your worthiness is what god's looking at there is do you believe despite the impossibility of it because there's only been a couple did it before and none of us have talked to them we're going to do the same thing so are you worthy of the promise of the rapture is will you keep believing it when things get worse and worse and people fall away and people fall away there's going to come a greater falling away from this message i guarantee you there is going to come more and more and more fall away scripture says brother jail quotes it time and time again when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth it's only going to be a few that hold through to the end and that is their worthiness is that they were faithful and they overcame amen amen amen think of john ryan do you remember john ryan that brother branham talked about he was a blind man that came up and he was prayed for him brother branham said you're healed john ryan comes back the next day still blind and says i thought you said i was healed brother brahm said i thought you said you believed you were healed you're stuck right either you believe or you don't so he said yes i believe so he's out on the corner he's selling prayers or he's selling papers and he's saying he's talking about his healing how the lord healed him of being blind and people are coming up and i'm sure they're doing this and doing the punch to the face and really blinking all that and he can't see he's blind as a bat for two weeks he's blind as a bat now there were plenty of people walk through that that prayer line that were healed and healed instantly but john ryan for some reason wasn't why we don't know god's sovereign i trust that he was a child of god and god was putting his faith to the test that's prob that would be the way i would answer it but for two weeks he endures people making fun of him and saying if you're healed why can't you see there's a disconnect here what you're saying does not match up with what you are how often do we see that how often do we see that and then what he's sitting in a barber's chair getting a haircut or a shave i think it was a shave and his eyes come open like that he testified for two weeks he took the abuse he took the teasing he took being made fun of he took being called out probably called a hypocrite right these christians they're so crazy right look at him he can't see he knows he can't see but he's telling us that he's healed that he can see right he's saying i hear all about my healing he's telling the crowds he's not just telling his spouse or his church buddies he's on the corner saying i'm healed and they can see that he's not healed as in he does not have his eyesight and then two weeks later i don't know where god gives him his sight why testing are you worthy of what i'm about to give you and he does that with his children that ought to be a confirmation to john ryan that there was something special in him that was maybe different from some of those others because god tested him before giving him the fullness of that healing amen like that quote brother paul sent me the other day he said what if you say this mountain be moved and don't doubt it in your heart it's going to move he said it would move but he didn't say when and your worthiness is will you hold to that promise until that mountain moves amen amen amen why because he's looking for victory in us before he brings victory to us amen he's got to get the victory on the inside and then it pushes itself out and manifests itself on the outside amen he says if you're abraham's seed you'll look at the promise of god what god said to do about it that's it abraham's seed we look at a promise i don't care how many falls this way and how many falls that way the promise remains true why the faithfulness is not judged by whether they stick to it it's does god stick to it you've got to come through those testings see yes abraham first tested then sealed then given the promise that his siege should possess the enemy's gate i like that then they possessed their enemies gates after they were tested and then we talked about john ryan and how that promise didn't come easily when you look at promised children they don't come very easily in the scripture right you look at isaac took 25 years and a body change right after that rebecca rebecca has a promise of thousands of millions of people coming down through her lineage and isaac has to pray for her in order for her to have the baby how does that make any sense god gives a promise and then she's barren god gives a promise and then he doesn't give them what he promised and isaac has to specifically go to god and pray for her to have a baby before she would have a baby you think she'd be fertile myrtle you think that she'd be popping them out left right and center because that's the promise but it's not he has to go and pray for the promise to come forth and then god blesses her with the twins and only one of them is a child of god right she's got a 50 win ratio right gives her the promise and she still has to deal with a child of hell amen amen but look at that and i want you to gather something from it because this will if you can sink into this it'll help you when you're dealing with something when you're waiting and that's that the trial the length of the trial has nothing to do with the amount of faith that you have because by all standards abraham had no faith because it took 25 years for the promised child to come amen elizabeth remember when she was pregnant with john the baptist she gets pregnant in her old age and then for six months that baby doesn't move and the first time it moves is when the name of jesus is first spoken amen amen you'll see that the trial of your faith can be long or it can be short but it's not because of your faith that you get healing that you get deliverance quick or that it takes a while it's up to god to determine what that timeline is because again he's working to grow and mature his people amen so if he chooses long are you going to stay worthy if he chooses short we say praise the lord right we love a short quick answer don't we but if he takes a long time to do it that doesn't make him any less god and that doesn't make you any less a child of god amen if you're out of your position if your conscience is bothering you you've got to make those things right because god deals with his children different than he deals with an unbeliever in these situations but if your conscience doesn't bother you if your heart is open towards god then the only thing that's holding it back is god's timing he doesn't worry about timing the way we do because he's a he's of eternity amen and so he's sitting there and he's just waiting for things to go the way he wants it to and when that junction hits boom it happens look at elena look at atlanta she's claiming her healing and in one moment weeks later one moment she runs around says i am healed goes to the doctors the next day and everything is off of her right there is not a single thing showing on her x-ray why one moment but she had to go through weeks and weeks and weeks of weakness not being able to get up she'd sit down for an hour and a half to get strength to get up for 20 minutes hour and a half before she could get up and just do 20 minutes of anything not not real work or anything don't just be up for 20 minutes she had to go through that day in day out day in and day out day in and day out and then in a moment god quickens to her and she's running around this is not a woman that can run in her condition she runs around gives her glory to god says i'm healed she knows she's healed goes to the doctors and they confirm at the very next day amen look at ron spencer amen does anybody here think that ron spencer is not a man of faith and he's going on a year of cancer right most of it's gone but he's still dealing with issues isn't he is that because he's not a man of faith no it's because god's got a plan and god's got a purpose and god's growing ron spencer there right and god's gonna show his great hand in all of this and we know that but that means he's still got to go through the trial and testing because god's got something better for him waiting on the other side of it amen the length of the trial is not reflective of your faith it's reflective of god's plan and purpose in your life amen amen isaac had to pray for rebecca to bring the promise that that blows my mind that god wouldn't just give that to them you know you think that being in the line of promise and the royal seed that things would just kind of follow naturally pretty easily you know you think she'd be pregnant pretty quick honestly but she's barren she's barren she's bare until isaac goes to go and says hey what about this you promised can we have our children now please and all of a sudden she gets it you know but it took me back to gethsemane because we had a man that prayed for us and then we had a man that took us to prayer and said there's something that's supposed to happen and i need to pray about it this is what he did this is in gethsemane this is jesus struggling with and going through the final temptation of will he accept his purpose and will he take the final step and go all the way to the cross or will he walk away and in all of that he prays for us and i want to read the entire prayer here john 17. this is jesus talking he says now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for i have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and they have received them that's us we have received the words that he's given us amen and have known surely that i came out from thee and that they have believed that thou did send me i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and all and thine are mine and i'm glorified in them amen and i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep them through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are one this is his prayer and that agony remember when he went there and he asked them pray for me i need i need prayer i need strength and they fell asleep fell asleep he's there praying just for them after all that's over he's praying for them he's not thinking about himself he's thinking about us you know we have that song when he was on the cross i was on his mind guess what way before he was on the cross you were on his mind because he made a decision and then he prayed for you when really he should have been praying for himself for more strength he says while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou have though gave us me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now i come to thee i'm leaving and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray that thou shalt take them out of the world but thou i pray i pray not that thou should take them out of the world but thou should just keep them from evil we had to stay right he says i'm not asking you to take them out i'm asking you to keep them from evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth for thy word is truth amen as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they may also be sanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word now he's looking down all the way to us he's talking about his his disciples here primarily you know but now he's looking down to the ones that believe their word and that's where we come in that they all may be one as thou fathered art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us and that the world may believe that thou hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that's the promise of the holy spirit right there that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them that thou hast loved me father i will that they also whom now has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world o righteous father the world had not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them amen isaac pray for rebecca christ prayed for the bride right here what did he leave out here there's nothing there if you've got the joy if you've got the life of god in you you've got unity with god everything you have everything if you have god you have everything and he says i prayed for them and lord you've given to me but i'm praying for them i'm saying i want this to happen this needs to happen i'm reminding you of the promise and as you gave the promise to me now this promise has to shift over to them as well because they're supposed to come and be with you the same way i am this is the promise he had he said i'm praying over this covenant i'm praying over this promise i'm reminding you of what's supposed to happen to these people amen that they should have the love of god in their lives amen what a tremendous prayer brother ram says this he says what we need to do is take out after god's holy spirit and the pillar fire again and move into the promise of every divine promise in the bible belongs to you and it's your personal property if you believe it amen do you believe that tonight friend with all your heart he says your faith will put you in position to know that every divine promise of god's bible is for you just as sure as that pertain to him every promise pertains to you your healing salvation your freedom from sin from selfishness and from your indifference and your little turtle shell that you pull yourself into what somebody hurts you somebody does something you don't like right things don't go quite your way job's not going so well can't get what i've been planning to get for the last couple of years what do we do we pull our little shell in he says and your little turtle shell that you pull yourself into christ wants to come in and be lord and ruler and set you free from those things he says when you serve warning on the devil that he's got his nasty self camped on god's property he says yes if he don't want to get out just call on the authorities of heaven god's law agent the holy ghost he will throw him out yes sir it's your property every divine promise in the bible belongs to every christian when you're saved god gives you a checkbook at the bottom of the page it's got jesus name signed on every check amen my name's not on there i'm only there to fill in the amount he says any redemptive blessing belongs to you are you afraid to fill it out and abraham's children are you afraid he won't recognize the name of jesus whatever you ask him the father in my name that i will do that's the promise you're abraham's children you're not afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize the name of jesus on any redemptive blessing that his body sitting at the right hand of god making intercessions for that's what he died for it hallelujah what a place to stand every redemptive blessing is on that check and all you have to do is fill it in and dispossess the enemy amen the musicians will come as we close amen we overcome not by our good deeds amen we overcome not by our reputation we don't overcome by who our dad is who our mom is who our pastor is and then we overcome by the blood of the lamb amen amen we have a risen savior that lives within us to make those things live in us every single day amen we'll pick up on this next time i'm up here i'm not sure when that's going to be but we want to dig into this deeper because brother adam goes into quite a bit of depth and we don't just want to leave it at that you know it's sometimes it's enough to say well this is what god said and just take it and we want to be able to have that simple faith you know but he starts to dig into what it is that holds us back and the gates that are within us and the ways that the enemy comes in at us and what it takes to push the enemy off of your property and he brings a deeper understanding to and i really want us to get down into that amen we want to have simple faith where we just take the promises and move but sometimes we've got to recognize where the battle is and that's what we've got to push them out of sometimes we're pushing at the wrong area and we've got to push at the right area and say this is really where the battle needs to be taken and this is where the enemy has to be dispossessed amen amen let's just stand together if we would let's just stand together amen pray lord jesus lord what a book of promises you've given us lord what a collection of checks that we have in our hands this evening heavenly father lord in studying for this service lord i looked around the church lord i looked around your bride globally lord and we see the pain we see the suffering lord we see the difficulties that people are facing these days

quickening power to sweep through our lives lord to sweep through our character to sweep through our relationships our marriages lord whatever it might be lord we know that there is a great need in your bride amen lord your prophet said that the people were struggling mightily in this day but lord we know we have a mighty conqueror that's come before us lord that's made a way lord and we can
