[44:41] see him as well amen amen it's a it's an
[44:45] effort you know just cuz you're a
[44:47] Believer doesn't mean it's not an effort
[44:48] that we don't have days where we don't
[44:49] feel tired and worn out and I see sister
[44:52] Kimberly's here tonight and I know she's
[44:54] not feeling real well but she's here I
[44:56] say God bless you God bless you amen
[44:58] it's uh brother Bob always gives this
[45:00] testimony brother Bob I'm going to
[45:01] testify for you tonight he says I come
[45:03] into church and my throat's not feeling
[45:05] good and I might be snuffled up or
[45:07] whatever that might be he says but I say
[45:09] Lord I'm here to serve I'm here to
[45:11] worship I'm here to do my part he says
[45:13] and in invariably by the end of the
[45:15] service or sometimes even before a few
[45:16] songs are sung he's right to where he
[45:18] needs to be and God comes down touches
[45:20] him you know sometimes we just need to
[45:22] say boo devil amen and let them know
[45:24] whose side we're on and that we're going
[45:25] to praise the Lord no matter what
[45:27] so I say God bless you to each one
[45:29] that's here tonight amen John chapter 19
[45:31] maybe a bit of an odd scripture to start
[45:33] this evening on a Wednesday night it's
[45:35] the scene of the crucifixion it says in
[45:37] verse 28 after this Jesus knowing that
[45:39] all things were now accomplished that
[45:41] the scripture might be fulfilled saith I
[45:44] thirst now there was a set of vessel
[45:47] there was set a vessel full of vinegar
[45:48] that's just a cheap wine and they filled
[45:51] a sponge with vinegar and put it upon
[45:53] hisp and put it in his mouth when Jesus
[45:55] therefore have received the vinegar he
[45:57] said it is finished and he bowed his
[46:00] head and gave up the ghost amen God
[46:03] bless you you can have your seats this
[46:04] evening we're going to take a second
[46:06] service on this thought of the
[46:07] condescending God and it'll be tonight
[46:09] and as far as I know Sunday as well but
[46:11] we'll see what the Lord would have but I
[46:13] just want to say God bless you for the
[46:14] service on Sunday I just thought it was
[46:16] an absolutely wonderful atmosphere uh
[46:19] when I came in to preach and and I just
[46:21] when I was sitting in there about three
[46:23] lines into the first song I said all
[46:24] right they're here for church this
[46:26] morning and I I sure appreciate I was
[46:27] telling some of the brothers after the
[46:29] service I said I wasn't feeling it this
[46:31] morning I was nervous I was anxious I
[46:33] just was was just not feeling unsettled
[46:35] about the service and you can study your
[46:37] heart out and you can feel you found in
[46:38] mind of the Lord and that doesn't change
[46:40] a thing you can go up and you can be
[46:42] nervous as a well just
[46:44] nervous and so but once I got to the
[46:47] pulpit just everything kind of drained
[46:48] away and by God's grace I was able to
[46:50] preach without without anything holding
[46:52] me back so I'm thankful for that that's
[46:54] his grace amen but that's a a part of
[46:56] the congregation that sets that
[46:58] atmosphere so that the preacher can come
[47:00] in and he can step right into that and
[47:02] God can move in there and he can speak
[47:03] to his people but I want to pick up
[47:05] where we left off on Sunday and we were
[47:07] speaking of God above us at the very
[47:09] beginning there in his dispensation of
[47:11] the father and the pillar of fire and
[47:13] that was him revealing himself as father
[47:15] to his children and from there he
[47:17] condescended and he came down but
[47:19] remember he would only come down he
[47:21] would only come down temporarily as a
[47:23] father he'd only drop down and then he'd
[47:25] go up he'd drop down and then he'd go up
[47:27] he never stayed the whole time he he was
[47:29] he was never ever present he was ever
[47:31] present up there but he was never ever
[47:33] present in the lives of the people amen
[47:36] and so what would he do he would come
[47:37] down and he would show us his will he
[47:39] would show us his word he would show us
[47:41] what he wanted done and then when that
[47:43] was done he'd go away and you could do
[47:45] it or you could not do it that's kind of
[47:47] the way that that it worked there amen
[47:49] but his will is his word we know that's
[47:50] one thing and I was talking with brother
[47:52] Grant about this after the service and
[47:54] it's a point that we've got to keep
[47:55] clear as we're going going through this
[47:57] service and this series because we're
[47:59] speaking on the life of a Believer
[48:01] that's been filled with the spirit
[48:02] that's the token life they've received
[48:04] the token life of Jesus Christ by the
[48:06] Holy Spirit and we have to drive home
[48:09] this thought that if you have the spirit
[48:10] of God then the leadership of that
[48:13] spirit will be according to the word of
[48:15] God every single time that's the only
[48:18] way that he works God cannot go against
[48:20] his word God cannot move against his own
[48:23] word God can't anull his own word God
[48:26] can't contradict his word you can't have
[48:29] two parts that are in tension with each
[48:31] with each other it's impossible because
[48:33] if he was to do that he would be moving
[48:35] contrary to himself and remember what
[48:37] Jesus said a kingdom divided against
[48:40] itself cannot stand amen we know that
[48:42] truth is what God says if God says it's
[48:45] right it's right if God says it's wrong
[48:47] it doesn't matter what Society what what
[48:49] the social construct we have today says
[48:52] if God says it's right it's right and if
[48:53] God says it's wrong it's wrong and if
[48:56] God was to move against his word then he
[48:58] would have to declare that what he said
[49:00] was not true but truth is the very
[49:02] essence of God he is the he is the
[49:04] source of Truth and and of all knowledge
[49:07] and and these different things so when
[49:09] God says it he cannot go against it
[49:11] because he would make himself to be a
[49:14] liar and we know what he he it says in
[49:16] the Scripture it says God is not a man
[49:18] that he should lie it says neither the
[49:21] son of man that he should repent ha he
[49:24] said and shall he not do it in other
[49:26] words When God says it God binds himself
[49:29] to what he has said that's our trust
[49:31] this evening that's our rest this
[49:33] evening is that he has said it therefore
[49:35] I can trust and rest that he's going to
[49:37] do it and it says or have he spoken and
[49:40] shall he not make it good amen we can
[49:43] disappoint ourselves we can disappoint
[49:45] our families our children our spouses uh
[49:48] people around us because we promis
[49:50] something and then we find out we can't
[49:52] do it and even in our good intentions
[49:54] when we said it we find out we can't do
[49:56] it and we can't make good on our promise
[49:59] he says God is not like this God never
[50:01] leaves you hanging God will do it if he
[50:04] said he would do it so therefore the
[50:05] Holy Spirit which is the very spirit of
[50:08] God in our lives it cannot contradict
[50:10] the word of God Jesus said and we've
[50:13] read this many services before he says
[50:16] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[50:18] has come he will guide you into all
[50:21] truth so the leadership of the holy
[50:23] spirit will take you into truth rather
[50:25] than out of or contrary to truth amen
[50:28] that's what it's supposed to do he says
[50:30] he shall not speak of himself whatsoever
[50:32] he shall hear that shall he speak and he
[50:34] will show you things to come in John
[50:36] 17:17 Jesus said sanctify them through
[50:39] thy truth Thy word is truth so we cannot
[50:43] claim to be led by the spirit of God and
[50:45] be in contradiction to the word of God
[50:48] impossible we can claim it but it ain't
[50:50] true it's impossible for God to lead us
[50:53] that way amen the very purpose we see
[50:55] here the very ident identification of
[50:57] the holy spirit in your life is it will
[50:59] lead you into the word not not away from
[51:02] it and not certainly not contradictory
[51:04] to it amen he leads us into all truth
[51:07] our leadership will align with the word
[51:09] of God if we have the spirit of God
[51:10] inside of us listen to this quote he
[51:13] says but God knows what he's doing as
[51:17] long as he's leading see so many times
[51:20] we get into a bind and we get into a
[51:22] bind because it wasn't God that led us
[51:24] it was that we thought God was leading
[51:26] us
[51:27] cuz we didn't check our leadership with
[51:28] the word of God and then pretty soon we
[51:30] get into a bind and we say what's going
[51:32] on and then we go check it with the word
[51:34] we realize oh my goodness I wasn't
[51:36] following the leadership of the lord we
[51:38] can't presume we can't presume we can
[51:41] know so much and yet miss the leading of
[51:43] God he says you see you must always go
[51:46] by the spirit listen Church lots of
[51:48] people claim they're led by the spirit
[51:51] that's not hard to
[51:52] claim I was telling somebody recently
[51:55] people it's a amazing what church has
[51:57] come to I'm not talking our church by
[52:00] God's grace I was telling telling
[52:02] someone the other day I said I saw a
[52:05] church where they called up a bunch of
[52:07] people to the front as a representation
[52:09] of their congregation and one of them
[52:11] was a group of drag queens called The
[52:14] Sisters of Perpetual
[52:18] Indulgence that's a POS that that that
[52:20] is that is the
[52:22] desolation of abominate the abomination
[52:25] of desolation was that what it was
[52:27] in the church and that's what they have
[52:29] turned the service into is a worship of
[52:32] themselves and theyve made themselves to
[52:34] be something worthy of worship and of
[52:37] accolades and
[52:38] recognition can you imagine the sisters
[52:41] of Perpetual
[52:43] Indulgence how has it
[52:46] Fallen what grip does Satan have on the
[52:49] nominal churches today they're
[52:52] worshiping him and they don't even know
[52:54] it
[52:57] and they claim to be Spirit L church you
[52:59] can claim all you want but the proving
[53:02] time has
[53:03] come it says and the spirit will always
[53:07] agree with the word he says now if the
[53:10] spirit leads you contrary to word to the
[53:12] word then it's not the spirit of God I'm
[53:15] not going to sugarcoat this this evening
[53:17] if it's contrary to the word I don't
[53:19] care what your condition is you may be a
[53:21] child of God but if it's contrary to the
[53:23] word it's not the spirit of God that's
[53:25] leading you
[53:27] impossible listen we can come under
[53:29] other influences you can be filled with
[53:32] the spirit of God and come under another
[53:34] influence by choice by choice listen if
[53:40] I turn to my spirit rather than his
[53:42] spirit it's not the spirit of God I can
[53:46] turn to my own thinking my own desires
[53:48] my own opinions and follow that
[53:50] leadership and it is anti chist Church
[53:53] his spirit is the only thing that has
[53:55] perfect leaders ership in our lives he
[53:58] says then it's not the spirit of God now
[54:01] if the holy spirit's leading you it'll
[54:03] say Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[54:06] today and forever see too often people
[54:08] say well the Bible doesn't say I
[54:11] can't listen there's not enough pages in
[54:13] this world to tell us all the things
[54:15] that we aren't supposed to
[54:16] do or that we are supposed to do maybe
[54:20] but I've said this before amen it's the
[54:22] if what you're doing is keeping you from
[54:25] doing what the scripture says you should
[54:27] do then it's
[54:29] wrong because what it's doing is it's
[54:31] putting that in preeminence ahead of
[54:33] what the word of God says you're
[54:34] supposed to do so if you want to judge
[54:37] where you're at this evening in your
[54:38] life amen don't look at whether it's
[54:41] right or wrong in itself Paul said
[54:43] there's nothing there's nothing that's
[54:45] wrong of
[54:47] itself but if the impact of it is that
[54:50] it keeps you from doing what the word
[54:51] says then for you it is wrong in that
[54:55] aspect
[54:56] listen we can have our Hobbies we can
[54:58] have our hunting we can have our Sports
[55:00] we can have our work whatever it might
[55:02] be if that is holding us back from doing
[55:05] what the word says it is out of
[55:07] preeminence in our life it's in a place
[55:09] it ought not to be and it is wrong in
[55:11] that
[55:13] place we're not going to sugarcoat
[55:15] things this evening amen we have to
[55:18] judge ourselves by what the word tells
[55:20] us to do and if we're not doing what the
[55:22] word tells us to do by doing something
[55:24] that it doesn't say we can't do
[55:27] we're still
[55:28] wrong and we need to bring that back
[55:30] into preeminence
[55:32] amen remember what caus people to miss
[55:34] the marriage
[55:36] supper do you remember the parable
[55:38] Church why did Jesus give us Parables to
[55:40] teach us a lesson one of them had a new
[55:44] wife what's wrong with a new wife
[55:47] Brothers nothing's wrong with a new wife
[55:50] a new wife is a perfect
[55:52] wife one of them had a new he had a new
[55:56] car he had a new team of oxin he had a
[55:58] new tractor what's wrong with a new team
[56:00] of oxen nothing one of them had bought a
[56:03] new piece of land what's wrong with the
[56:06] new piece of land nothing but it's the
[56:09] preeminence they placed on it that kept
[56:11] them from the marriage supper and they
[56:13] lost their Eternal reward because they
[56:16] put something in preeminence above what
[56:18] they should have that's it check the
[56:22] impact don't check the legality only
[56:25] listen if the scripture says don't do it
[56:27] then don't do it there's no excuse for
[56:29] that but if it doesn't say anything
[56:30] about it say what impact is this going
[56:32] to have on what it tells me to do and if
[56:34] it's going to bring that above what God
[56:36] tells you to do by his word it's
[56:39] wrong because the effect is
[56:41] wrong but we opened up with this tragic
[56:44] scene in Calvary and I call it tragic
[56:47] because the prince of Glory died that's
[56:49] tragic it was needful but it was tragic
[56:52] but I want to show how God moves in
[56:54] these phases and this idea of him
[56:55] condescending remember he was revealed
[56:57] as Jehovah the father God above us and
[57:00] he gave us only the old Covenant the law
[57:03] of Moses that God had made with Mankind
[57:05] and then God comes down himself and he
[57:08] dwells within a man the human body of
[57:10] Jesus and he reveals himself in sunship
[57:13] then and he fulfills that contract he
[57:15] comes down and does what we could not do
[57:18] that's another thing you'll see as we
[57:19] move through this idea the condescension
[57:21] of God he does what we can't do he does
[57:23] what we've been trying to do and what
[57:25] we've been wanting done but then he
[57:27] comes down and he's the one that does it
[57:29] as we said before if we could do it we'd
[57:31] have done it by now but we can't but God
[57:34] moves in phases and we see this in the
[57:36] condescending of God when we look in the
[57:38] Book of Genesis God's in his creator
[57:40] phase and his speaking phase and so he
[57:42] speaks things into his existence and he
[57:44] brings man into a body and then he sits
[57:46] back and he just lets things unfold and
[57:49] we know what happens there is that
[57:52] Humanity falls in the garden by Adam and
[57:54] Eve and now God has to moved to another
[57:56] phase and his next phase is a covenant
[57:59] it's a law it's a contract but it was
[58:01] not a law of life it was a law of sin
[58:04] and death that was the next phase amen
[58:07] it told you what to do and what not to
[58:09] do and if you did what you weren't
[58:11] supposed to do you died and if you
[58:13] didn't do what you were supposed to do
[58:15] you died it was a law of sin and death
[58:18] there was nothing good in that law there
[58:20] was no life in it there was no rest in
[58:22] it because nobody could live perfectly
[58:24] there was nothing there that brought
[58:27] satisfaction there was nothing there it
[58:29] condemned you and it judged you even if
[58:31] nobody else knew that you'd done it you
[58:33] know You' done it and so all it could do
[58:36] it was con it condemn you and so it was
[58:38] it was a Grace of sorts because under
[58:41] that law there was an atonement that
[58:43] could be made there was an innocent life
[58:46] that could be shed to cover up your less
[58:48] than innocent life and it was blood that
[58:51] would cover us for those things amen but
[58:53] it was an imperfect atonement and so it
[58:55] was imperfect law in and of itself and
[58:58] then Christ came down to fulfill that
[59:00] law he didn't come away to come to do
[59:02] away with it as we said per se or to or
[59:05] or to to say it was wrong but he came to
[59:08] satisfy it that's what it meant to
[59:09] fulfill it he came to satisfy the
[59:11] contract with God to where a perfect
[59:14] sacrifice could make a perfect atonement
[59:17] so that now we can move into the next
[59:18] phase of God's condescension of God's
[59:21] Plan of Redemption amen that perfect
[59:23] atonement is once and for all it's a
[59:26] finished work it's a completely finished
[59:28] work there's nothing more that's
[59:30] required of us today amen church let me
[59:32] say it this way at Calvary God's
[59:35] requirement was met completely you have
[59:38] nothing you need to do today to satisfy
[59:40] God there's nothing you can do to
[59:43] satisfy God what we do today see back
[59:46] then it was works today your works are
[59:48] an offering they're a sacrifice there's
[59:51] something we give out of love and
[59:53] appreciation they are not a requirement
[59:56] they're expected because as a Believer
[59:58] you are expected to live a life amen but
[1:00:01] now we've moved on to an offering of
[1:00:03] life rather than an offering of
[1:00:05] works okay so watch now we're going to
[1:00:07] go back to our opening scripture as we
[1:00:09] look at this shift from phase to phase
[1:00:11] of God's condescending tied in with his
[1:00:13] Redemption plan and it says
[1:00:17] here I must have skipped it right yes
[1:00:21] for when we were in the flesh we're
[1:00:23] talking about that law of sin and death
[1:00:24] when we were in theh the Motions of sin
[1:00:27] which were by the law remember what what
[1:00:30] we know that without the law there's no
[1:00:32] sin if we don't have a law that says
[1:00:34] you're not allowed to run through a
[1:00:35] stoplight then it's okay to run through
[1:00:37] a stoplight so until the law came
[1:00:39] there's no saying our lives weren't
[1:00:41] judged until the law came but as soon as
[1:00:44] the law is there now it's judged amen
[1:00:46] and though so out of that law it did
[1:00:48] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[1:00:51] unto death that's why I said under the
[1:00:52] first law there was no life all it could
[1:00:54] produce was death and condemn
[1:00:56] ation but now we look at John 19 and
[1:00:59] this was our opening scripture it says
[1:01:01] Jesus knowing that all things were now
[1:01:03] accomplished in other words he's done
[1:01:05] everything that was required of him to
[1:01:08] satisfy the
[1:01:11] contract he lived a perfect life he was
[1:01:14] recognized by God as being
[1:01:16] acceptable he stepped into his
[1:01:19] mediatorial position or or his his
[1:01:21] salvational uh
[1:01:23] position right and now watch what he
[1:01:25] does does at the very end there's one
[1:01:28] thing left to
[1:01:29] do and I was reading in my devotions
[1:01:32] this morning Luke 18 and Jesus said that
[1:01:34] he was going down to Jerusalem that all
[1:01:36] things that were written by the prophets
[1:01:38] concerning the son of man shall be
[1:01:42] accomplished Jesus was going down
[1:01:44] knowing that every word that was written
[1:01:47] about him was going to be
[1:01:49] accomplished the good and the bad he had
[1:01:53] to take the bad before he could get the
[1:01:54] good are you listening to me this
[1:01:57] evening you got to take the bad before
[1:01:58] you can take the good we're looking for
[1:02:01] the victory but we skip the battle can't
[1:02:04] do it Church we're going to get into
[1:02:05] that a little bit later this evening
[1:02:07] amen but he says and then he comes down
[1:02:09] to the very end and everything that was
[1:02:11] required of him he's done except there's
[1:02:13] one little scripture he has to fulfill
[1:02:16] and it's back in the Book of
[1:02:18] Psalms and then he says he says I'm
[1:02:20] thirsty and what did they do they give
[1:02:22] him
[1:02:23] vinegar and it fulfills what David wrote
[1:02:25] In in the Psalms and it's the last thing
[1:02:27] he had to fulfill and then he said it is
[1:02:32] finished he bowed his head and he gave
[1:02:35] up the
[1:02:36] ghost God condescending in that
[1:02:39] dispensation of sunship revealing
[1:02:42] himself in a human body came down with
[1:02:44] one purpose to finish the law to fulfill
[1:02:48] the law amen and as soon as he did that
[1:02:51] through Christ in that flesh form he
[1:02:54] left the flesh form but
[1:02:56] behind that flesh form was never
[1:02:59] used it's
[1:03:01] done we may not think that but we'll
[1:03:04] show you that by the scripture why
[1:03:06] because that phase is finished and now
[1:03:08] there's a stepping into a new phase of
[1:03:12] what God's going to be doing with us
[1:03:14] remember now in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:03:16] all things were given into jesus' hand
[1:03:18] that Son of God born as Adam was born
[1:03:21] born by the spirit sinless flesh was
[1:03:24] given a choice a free will choice and of
[1:03:27] his own free will he says I'll drink of
[1:03:30] that cup if it's according to your will
[1:03:33] and he did and he sacrificed everything
[1:03:35] he had he sacrificed his body his
[1:03:38] reputation his flesh he sacrificed
[1:03:41] everything that he had for you and I of
[1:03:43] his own free will to the word of God and
[1:03:47] in doing so he became the perfect
[1:03:50] atonement to satisfy the law and one and
[1:03:53] done that's what he was It was a one in
[1:03:56] one the price was paid it satisfied the
[1:03:58] wrath of God Paul would say it this way
[1:04:00] in Romans 5 he says therefore as by the
[1:04:02] offense of one judgment Came Upon all
[1:04:05] men to
[1:04:06] condemnation how fair is that
[1:04:09] church Adam and Eve fail and you and I
[1:04:12] have to go through what we go through
[1:04:14] tonight Paul says one person's mistake
[1:04:16] got us
[1:04:18] here that ain't Fair it isn't
[1:04:22] fair but guess what God balances the
[1:04:25] unfair watch what he says now he says
[1:04:28] even so by the righteousness of one the
[1:04:31] free gift came upon all men under
[1:04:35] justification of Life praise the Lord he
[1:04:37] balanced the unfairness with another
[1:04:39] unfairness CU it wasn't fair that Christ
[1:04:41] took my place but he did and he gave it
[1:04:45] of his own free will and so I get here I
[1:04:48] got here by unfairness but I'm here
[1:04:50] today by another unfairness that
[1:04:52] balanced the scales of Justice amen
[1:04:54] praise the Lord that he took it on
[1:04:56] himself he did not say this isn't fair
[1:04:59] oh anybody have kids what do kids dwell
[1:05:01] on unfairness they're the perfect ones
[1:05:04] to talk about un uh uh a lack of Justice
[1:05:07] aren't they kids know when it's unfair
[1:05:10] I'm seeing all the parents grinning and
[1:05:11] all the kids saying who
[1:05:12] me we know when it's
[1:05:16] unfair listen God has God God makes sure
[1:05:19] it all comes out it all works out Amen
[1:05:22] brother Grant it'll all work out amen we
[1:05:25] have have a rest in those things but
[1:05:27] through one justification of life amen
[1:05:30] it's a free gift I was reading the other
[1:05:32] day brother Ram said you won't go to
[1:05:34] hell because you're a sinner you'll go
[1:05:35] to hell because you're a rejector of the
[1:05:37] free
[1:05:39] gift that's it that's it cuz the price
[1:05:43] was paid you've just got to take it
[1:05:45] remember but the law has established
[1:05:47] that a pardon is not a pardon until you
[1:05:49] accept that pardon and so if you don't
[1:05:52] accept the free gift the pardon of
[1:05:53] Calvary that's your fault not his fault
[1:05:56] and you'll go to hell in your sins he
[1:05:59] for he said for as by one man man's
[1:06:02] Disobedience many were made Sinners so
[1:06:04] by The Obedience of one shall many be
[1:06:06] made righteous moreover he says the law
[1:06:09] entered that the offense might abound
[1:06:12] notice that the law wasn't here to raise
[1:06:14] us up the law was here to push us
[1:06:18] down can I put it this way the law was
[1:06:21] what we
[1:06:24] deserved he says but Hallelujah where
[1:06:27] sin abounded Grace did much more abound
[1:06:32] man we could probably do some preaching
[1:06:33] on Grace I heard a brother preach a
[1:06:35] service on Grace the other day and I so
[1:06:37] enjoyed it I wish I could have brought
[1:06:38] him over and had him preach that same
[1:06:40] service for us here this is the kind of
[1:06:42] Grace that we have church where sin did
[1:06:44] abound Grace did much more abound amen
[1:06:48] there's a song that I listen to it says
[1:06:51] what I earned is not what I got that's
[1:06:53] what Grace is what I deserve is not what
[1:06:57] I've got today I've got something else
[1:06:59] and it's the unmar favor of almighty God
[1:07:03] he says that as Sin reigned unto death
[1:07:05] the wages of sin is death even so my
[1:07:08] grace Reign through righteousness unto
[1:07:11] eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:07:14] the wages of Grace is what we don't
[1:07:16] deserve and yet we get it what is it
[1:07:19] eternal life through Jesus Christ the
[1:07:21] wages of Grace is eternal
[1:07:24] life here's a the thing with Grace you
[1:07:27] get it but you don't earn it so it's not
[1:07:29] a wage it's a free
[1:07:32] gift there is no wages with with Grace
[1:07:35] it's a free gift what you don't deserve
[1:07:37] you get anyways he paid the price he
[1:07:40] gets to determine what
[1:07:42] happens listen to this he says but when
[1:07:44] Jesus died at Calvary he settled the sin
[1:07:48] question forever
[1:07:52] forever we don't have to sit here and
[1:07:54] wonder does he see my sin he can't it's
[1:07:59] covered by the perfect shed blood of
[1:08:02] Jesus Christ he cannot see sin we're not
[1:08:05] going to get into this this service
[1:08:06] there's so much more coming I can't wait
[1:08:07] to preach it about how God sees us when
[1:08:10] we think we sin let me tell you a little
[1:08:13] secret tonight he can't see it he can't
[1:08:16] see it he can't see it amen it's a
[1:08:19] beautiful thing when we can see things
[1:08:21] through God's eyes we've got a message
[1:08:23] that'll open our eyes to the way that
[1:08:25] God these things but I want you to see
[1:08:27] something that Calvary was not just
[1:08:29] paying the price Calvary was opening the
[1:08:33] door Calvary was opening the door to
[1:08:35] Redemption Paul said in Romans 5 as we
[1:08:37] just read that by The Obedience of one
[1:08:40] person many shall be made
[1:08:42] righteous many will find Grace many will
[1:08:45] find Healing they'll find a place of
[1:08:46] rest and comfort there's a place where
[1:08:49] that longing of our heart can be
[1:08:50] satisfied it was Christ the open door
[1:08:53] that opened that path back to God again
[1:08:56] listen to this he says finally one day
[1:08:59] that's the day of Calvary there was one
[1:09:00] came down from Glory one by the name of
[1:09:03] Jesus Christ the son of God who came
[1:09:05] from glory and Calvary was formed that
[1:09:08] was the day that the price was paid and
[1:09:11] the sin question was settled forever he
[1:09:13] says and it opened up the way unto this
[1:09:16] thing that we're hungering and thirsting
[1:09:20] for what it's not just going to satisfy
[1:09:23] everything it's opening up a way that
[1:09:25] will satisfy our hunger and our thirst
[1:09:28] because there's more to C more to this
[1:09:30] life there's more to this Christian walk
[1:09:32] than just Calvary we'll cover it in a
[1:09:33] little bit he says there it opened up
[1:09:36] the this way into this thing that we're
[1:09:38] hungry and thirsting for it brought a
[1:09:40] place of
[1:09:42] satisfaction there's no man that's ever
[1:09:44] visited Calvary and seen it the way it
[1:09:46] was that can never be the same
[1:09:48] everything he ever desired or longed for
[1:09:51] is met when he reaches that place Cal
[1:09:55] Calgary Calvary Calgary doesn't do it
[1:09:58] calvary removes the weight it removes
[1:10:00] the stain it remain it removes the guilt
[1:10:03] it it it brings that acceptance of our
[1:10:07] longing to be in the presence of God
[1:10:09] I'll never forget the day that I met
[1:10:11] Christ when I gave my life to him
[1:10:14] because I walked in Feeling So Unworthy
[1:10:17] and so dirty and so unable to stand in
[1:10:21] his presence that all I could say was
[1:10:24] God forgive me God forgive me God
[1:10:27] forgive me but when he washed me clean
[1:10:29] church that's a feeling that I could
[1:10:31] never ever replicate with anything else
[1:10:34] the satisfaction of knowing I've been
[1:10:36] set free from my past from my present
[1:10:40] and from my future is a feeling that
[1:10:42] this world will never give you people
[1:10:45] are seeking that sort of
[1:10:46] release through the relationships they
[1:10:49] have the drugs they take the alcohol the
[1:10:51] entertainment the Hobbies whatever it
[1:10:53] might be there's nothing can satisfy
[1:10:56] like a true a and real relationship with
[1:10:58] Jesus Christ nothing will do
[1:11:01] it but Calvary was not the be all and
[1:11:04] end all it was the start of the be all
[1:11:07] and end all there's no other starting
[1:11:09] place except
[1:11:11] Calvary this message is not the starting
[1:11:13] place you've got to have an acceptance
[1:11:16] of the finished work of Calvary you've
[1:11:19] got to know that you've been cleansed
[1:11:21] from your sins before he can ever do
[1:11:24] anything else with you with this truth
[1:11:25] truth that we
[1:11:27] have it's not a church it's not a
[1:11:31] denomination it's a personal
[1:11:33] relationship with Jesus Christ that's
[1:11:35] what he's doing in the next phase of his
[1:11:36] work the foundation of this whole church
[1:11:38] is built on the Church of the Living God
[1:11:41] is that Jesus
[1:11:43] Christ it's the revealing of Christ
[1:11:47] remember God was known as Jehovah in the
[1:11:49] Old Testament now there's this change of
[1:11:51] dispensation as it goes from father to
[1:11:53] son and now God is revealing himself
[1:11:56] under a new name it's the same God all
[1:11:59] along when you look at at Hebrews 11 in
[1:12:01] the faith chapter remember what it said
[1:12:03] of Moses he says choosing to suffer what
[1:12:06] the reproach of
[1:12:08] whom Christ it didn't say Jehovah it
[1:12:12] said Christ why because that is the
[1:12:14] revealed name of God throughout the
[1:12:16] whole thing remember what the prophet of
[1:12:18] God said he says go back and read your
[1:12:20] Bible from start to end and if you can't
[1:12:22] see whom Christ in every page go read it
[1:12:26] again it was Christ it was God revealing
[1:12:29] himself through Christ the entire way
[1:12:32] amen but now he's coming in and he's
[1:12:34] revealing himself as the Lord Jesus
[1:12:38] Christ and if you didn't catch the shift
[1:12:40] from Jehovah to Christ you would stay
[1:12:43] dead in your
[1:12:46] sins that that sounds scary but it's
[1:12:48] true because if you continue to go and
[1:12:51] you continue to serve Jehovah under the
[1:12:53] law of Moses
[1:12:55] you completely missed the perfect
[1:12:57] atonement that had been made and all you
[1:12:59] had to do was accept the perfect
[1:13:01] atonement God you could go there and
[1:13:03] sacrifice sheep after sheep and cow
[1:13:05] after cow and turtle dove after turtle
[1:13:07] dove and God would got not recognize it
[1:13:10] because he had
[1:13:11] shifted he had fulfilled the
[1:13:14] contract there's nothing you could do
[1:13:16] anymore except except the finished work
[1:13:18] of Calvary you had to see the changing
[1:13:22] of God's phases in his word and his plan
[1:13:25] and what he was doing in these things
[1:13:27] you've got to move with God as he
[1:13:28] reveals himself and most of them didn't
[1:13:31] unfortunately and so that's why he
[1:13:33] turned to the Gentiles we know
[1:13:35] this remember what John said he says if
[1:13:37] we if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:13:42] the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:13:44] another and the blood of Jesus cleanses
[1:13:47] his son cleanses us from all sin you say
[1:13:50] I can't go back to
[1:13:53] Calvary yes you've got to go back to
[1:13:55] Calvary like I said there is no other
[1:13:57] starting place except
[1:14:00] Calvary it's the open door I mean John
[1:14:02] repeated it in in Revelation 5 4
[1:14:06] 5 there's an open door come up a little
[1:14:10] higher it's Christ you've got to start
[1:14:13] there amen but you see as we move into
[1:14:16] the New Testament and Paul starts to
[1:14:18] preach and John and Peter and these
[1:14:20] things they did not stay at
[1:14:23] Calvary but they moved da because they
[1:14:25] said yes your sins can be forgiven but
[1:14:28] the life of that blood has to come into
[1:14:30] you to take you all the way down this
[1:14:32] road that's been opened up through the
[1:14:33] door that is Christ that Calvary is a
[1:14:36] starting place but remember what Paul
[1:14:37] says we've got to move past those first
[1:14:39] Works a baptism and repentance and this
[1:14:43] and that and the other thing and you got
[1:14:44] to move on into
[1:14:47] Perfection right and that is only by the
[1:14:49] spirit it is not by works amen we've got
[1:14:53] to be able to move past those things yes
[1:14:55] it's wonderful to be clean but we've got
[1:14:57] to move from just being clean to being a
[1:14:59] new
[1:15:00] creation lots of people are accepting
[1:15:02] the blood because it's such a wonderful
[1:15:04] feeling but you got to keep going as he
[1:15:06] is in the light so that you can receive
[1:15:08] the life that was in that blood cuz
[1:15:10] that's the only thing that'll give us a
[1:15:11] new
[1:15:12] birth I was reading there where brother
[1:15:14] Bram says in uh when when he's talking
[1:15:18] about uh those that are Before the
[1:15:20] Throne in Revelation
[1:15:23] 7 and he says you've got to realize that
[1:15:26] there's a mixed crowd there there's a
[1:15:27] bride that's there and there is also a a
[1:15:31] a um a foolish virgin that's
[1:15:34] there and they have to be purged in the
[1:15:37] tribulation because they didn't go all
[1:15:39] the
[1:15:40] way that's what happens when you don't
[1:15:42] go all the
[1:15:44] way they could never receive the spirit
[1:15:46] because they turn down the word ins
[1:15:49] sincerity and so they give their lives
[1:15:51] in the Great
[1:15:52] Tribulation we give our lives now
[1:15:55] in surrender to the word and in doing so
[1:15:57] we receive the spirit
[1:15:59] amen Church god holds us accountable for
[1:16:02] what he tells us and we can like it or
[1:16:04] not like it but that doesn't change that
[1:16:07] it's his word and he holds us
[1:16:08] accountable for whatever he brings our
[1:16:10] way listen we can say my pastor Don't
[1:16:12] Preach it that way my church doesn't
[1:16:13] preach it that way the world doesn't
[1:16:14] preach it that way church it's a
[1:16:16] straight and narrow way and few there be
[1:16:18] that find it most people aren't going to
[1:16:20] like it and most will be offended by it
[1:16:23] I was listening today at the very end of
[1:16:24] spoken words The Original Seed and
[1:16:26] brother Braham says at the end they will
[1:16:28] shut you
[1:16:31] down he says and then God will come down
[1:16:34] and prove who's
[1:16:36] who because they can't abide the truth
[1:16:39] so they will shut you down if you're not
[1:16:41] a part of an accepted denomination they
[1:16:43] will shut you down they're already
[1:16:45] starting to do these things over in
[1:16:47] Europe they're going to do it over here
[1:16:49] too it'll be a backlash against all the
[1:16:52] things that are going
[1:16:53] on we're getting
[1:16:55] close but remember if all you take is
[1:16:58] the blood but not the life of the blood
[1:17:01] it's a halfway job because you're not
[1:17:03] born again you're clean but you're not
[1:17:06] born again that's a work of the spirit
[1:17:08] the cleaning but it's not the spirit
[1:17:10] itself amen the blood cleanses but it
[1:17:12] takes the life of that blood blood to
[1:17:14] cause us to be a new creation and live
[1:17:16] the way that Christ did listen to this
[1:17:19] he says but if but you'll never be
[1:17:21] satisfied until you know him as the
[1:17:23] Forgiveness of your sins where the sin
[1:17:27] question is settled like I said that's a
[1:17:29] wonderful feeling when you know your
[1:17:30] sins are forgiven that's a wonderful
[1:17:32] feeling and most people stop
[1:17:34] there because it's a wonderful
[1:17:38] feeling but to the TR child of God
[1:17:40] there's a Hunger for More I believe that
[1:17:44] he says where the sin question is
[1:17:46] settled and then that beautiful word and
[1:17:50] you have that lovely peaceful quiet
[1:17:53] eternal Everlasting fellowship with him
[1:17:58] remember to have fellowship with him you
[1:18:00] need a new heart you need a new spirit
[1:18:02] just to get along with him and then his
[1:18:04] Spirit comes into you he says when the
[1:18:07] peace of God that passes all
[1:18:09] understanding has Sanctified your soul
[1:18:12] and has made you a new creature in
[1:18:14] Christ Jesus joining Church won't do it
[1:18:17] that's only perverting the real cause if
[1:18:20] the devil can't get you out on those
[1:18:22] things and he's talking about worldly
[1:18:23] pleasures he'll take you to this other
[1:18:25] which is what man-made religion he'll
[1:18:28] get you to join a church and make you
[1:18:30] think you're saved there's only one way
[1:18:32] to get into the body of Christ and
[1:18:34] that's by one Spirit we're baptized into
[1:18:36] that body 1 Corinthians 12 it's by it's
[1:18:39] by the holy spirit in your life it is
[1:18:41] not writing your name on a book it's not
[1:18:43] by Church attendance it's not by being
[1:18:45] affiliated with a group it's by the
[1:18:47] spirit of God making you a new creature
[1:18:49] creature in Christ it's the only
[1:18:51] way that's why we don't have a
[1:18:53] membership book here
[1:18:56] let me tell you this you'll know when
[1:18:57] you're a part of this
[1:18:59] church amen because your spirit will
[1:19:02] agree with the people that's
[1:19:04] here he says but don't settle for
[1:19:07] nothing less than an oldfashioned
[1:19:09] experience of the new birth to be born
[1:19:11] again of the spirit of the Eternal God
[1:19:13] and catch this he says when your soul
[1:19:16] and God unite together and you become
[1:19:21] one I want to show how this transitions
[1:19:23] now for this last half of this
[1:19:25] service remember God coming down
[1:19:27] revealing himself through Christ and he
[1:19:29] closes that chapter on the law of Moses
[1:19:31] on the Old Testament the old Covenant
[1:19:33] and then there's a short period of time
[1:19:35] when Christ dies and remember he goes
[1:19:37] down into hell and he preaches to the
[1:19:39] souls that are in
[1:19:41] prison and then after that he shifts
[1:19:44] into a new phase and Jesus foreshadowed
[1:19:46] it with his disciples before his death
[1:19:48] and we've read this before but I'll read
[1:19:49] it again for the sake of completeness he
[1:19:51] says I'll pray the father and he shall
[1:19:53] give you another comforter that he may
[1:19:55] abide with you forever Christ was a
[1:19:57] comfort to them remember when they're in
[1:19:59] the ship and the wind's blowing they say
[1:20:01] you know we're going to die if you don't
[1:20:03] do something and he stands up and he
[1:20:04] says peace be
[1:20:06] still they went from being completely
[1:20:09] uncomfortable to completely comforted he
[1:20:11] was the comforter and he says he's going
[1:20:13] to give you another comforter and it
[1:20:16] sounds like it's somebody different he
[1:20:18] says who's it going to be even the
[1:20:20] spirit of Truth the Holy Spirit whom the
[1:20:22] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:20:24] him not neither knoweth him but ye know
[1:20:26] him for he dwells with you presently and
[1:20:30] shall be in you in the future then he
[1:20:33] says I will not leave you comfortless I
[1:20:36] will come to you I is a personal pronoun
[1:20:39] same person same God different way okay
[1:20:44] it's a different phase that's coming and
[1:20:45] it'll be something completely new to the
[1:20:47] family of God it'll have an effect of
[1:20:50] comfort and other things as we'll see
[1:20:52] but it'll be the same person he says yet
[1:20:54] a little while and the world seeth me no
[1:20:56] more but ye see me because I live this
[1:20:59] is the I am the everpresent unchanging
[1:21:03] one because I live you shall live also
[1:21:07] and at that day you shall know that I am
[1:21:09] in my father and you in me and I in you
[1:21:12] this is the perfect Unity of the bride
[1:21:14] with Christ they're all part of the same
[1:21:16] body we've said it before you can't be a
[1:21:18] part of God if you weren't always a part
[1:21:20] of God you don't become a child of God
[1:21:22] you always were a child of God and all
[1:21:24] you are is born again so that you can be
[1:21:26] revealed that way amen but this new
[1:21:28] dispensation this new phase this new era
[1:21:31] coming will finalize itself in perfect
[1:21:34] imp perfect Unity between God and man
[1:21:37] that's what this next phase is going to
[1:21:38] be so Christ raises from the dead on the
[1:21:41] third day and it seems like he's in the
[1:21:43] same
[1:21:45] body but the thing is they don't
[1:21:47] recognize him he's that little bit
[1:21:49] different isn't he he's similar but he's
[1:21:52] not the same and their eyes can't tell
[1:21:54] who he is it seems like it's the same
[1:21:56] phase cuz it's Christ interacting with
[1:21:58] creation but you've got to realize
[1:22:00] something he's in a different body now
[1:22:02] he's not subject to the laws like he was
[1:22:04] before of this Earth think of it when
[1:22:07] God condescended now with the law of
[1:22:09] Moses the the law that he gave to Moses
[1:22:12] he revealed the highest level of
[1:22:14] spirituality and that highest level was
[1:22:16] works that was it works that was as far
[1:22:20] as you could go that's what that's what
[1:22:22] held them in place dos and don'ts it was
[1:22:24] legalism it was a
[1:22:26] law right but it was God's ordained law
[1:22:29] and that was the way to keep them out
[1:22:30] from under judgment and I've been
[1:22:32] reading in my devotions I'm trying to
[1:22:33] get through my entire Bible this year
[1:22:36] and so I'm reading through things that
[1:22:37] maybe we wouldn't read so much you know
[1:22:39] Micah and NM naam's all focused on the
[1:22:41] on the destruction of Nineveh has
[1:22:43] nothing to do with me but there's some
[1:22:45] beautiful little verses in there but it
[1:22:47] struck me as I'm reading through all
[1:22:48] these things because after David goes
[1:22:50] off the scene what you see is people
[1:22:53] that fail in the D and don'ts and so God
[1:22:56] has to judge them according to the law
[1:22:58] and he's brutal they die they get put
[1:23:02] into slavery their homes get destroyed
[1:23:04] people take their stuff they go away for
[1:23:06] 70 years it's just up and down and in
[1:23:09] and out and serving this one and then
[1:23:11] get a victory and then serving one and
[1:23:13] get a victory it's this constant cycle
[1:23:14] of slavery and freedom why CU God's
[1:23:17] Bound by his word and when they stopped
[1:23:19] doing the dos and they started doing the
[1:23:22] don'ts God had to judge them and it's
[1:23:25] incredible how how Swift and how
[1:23:28] complete God's judgment
[1:23:30] was but now when he comes down in Christ
[1:23:33] what's he doing now he's showing the
[1:23:35] next phase he's showing the potential
[1:23:38] he's showing the purpose of the next
[1:23:40] phase and when he comes down in Christ
[1:23:42] he reveals the highest level of
[1:23:43] spirituality which is
[1:23:45] Unity I and my father are one I can do
[1:23:49] nothing except the father shows me first
[1:23:52] it's complete surrender to God to where
[1:23:54] you and him are one and he shows that
[1:23:57] amen he was the perfect example of what
[1:23:59] was coming and in that form he was
[1:24:01] Bridging the the the law and Grace he
[1:24:05] was standing in the Gap and he was
[1:24:06] closing that Gap so that as he fulfilled
[1:24:09] the law he would immediately step in to
[1:24:11] show what Grace was going to look like
[1:24:13] and he did everything the law required
[1:24:15] in that body not by force not by fear
[1:24:18] but by Perfect surrender to the will of
[1:24:20] God of his own free will he chose to
[1:24:23] Humble himself to obey that spirit of
[1:24:25] God that was inside of him and in many
[1:24:27] ways he was living in two dispensations
[1:24:29] at the same time there was a blending
[1:24:31] that was happening he was foreshadowing
[1:24:33] what was coming while fulfilling what
[1:24:34] was behind that's what he was doing all
[1:24:37] at the same time he was F he was showing
[1:24:39] us the perfect submission of a child of
[1:24:42] God that's filled with the spirit he's
[1:24:45] showing the full potential amen but when
[1:24:47] he's Rising now from the dead what's he
[1:24:49] doing he's showing us the end of all of
[1:24:52] that Unity he's showing what comes to a
[1:24:54] person that is submitted to the spirit
[1:24:57] and what is it it's a glorified body
[1:25:00] he's standing there in a perfect
[1:25:01] glorified body he can appear and he can
[1:25:04] disappear at will he can be one minute
[1:25:06] 100 miles there and the next minute he's
[1:25:07] over there he can travel like a thought
[1:25:09] does that sound
[1:25:11] familiar he's now interacting with this
[1:25:14] world but he's not bound by this world
[1:25:17] the laws of this well don't apply to him
[1:25:20] he can go through a solid wall and
[1:25:23] appear
[1:25:25] he's in it but he's not of it that's
[1:25:28] what's going on Amen he's in it but he's
[1:25:30] not subject to those laws and so in
[1:25:32] those 33 and A2 years of his life he's
[1:25:35] showing the whole process of what Grace
[1:25:37] is going to look like where God will
[1:25:40] condescend into human flesh and he'll
[1:25:43] bring them into perfect unity and
[1:25:45] restore them back to their original
[1:25:47] position that's what he was showing he
[1:25:49] was showing us the surrender the
[1:25:52] humility the
[1:25:54] obedience and the pain and the suffering
[1:25:57] and the rejection that comes with that
[1:25:59] but he also showed us the healing he
[1:26:00] showed us the Deliverance he showed us
[1:26:02] the victory he showed us the overcoming
[1:26:04] he showed us the authority that came
[1:26:06] when you submitted yourself to the
[1:26:07] things of God he showed us the whole
[1:26:10] picture because our life is going to
[1:26:12] match his and if we can see where he
[1:26:15] went through the hardships then we can
[1:26:17] also see that the victory is coming on
[1:26:18] the other side of it as well everything
[1:26:21] that is available to us today by the
[1:26:23] baptism of of the Holy Spirit was
[1:26:25] revealed in Christ in its
[1:26:27] Perfection remember what Paul would say
[1:26:29] in Romans 8 he said for whom he did for
[1:26:32] know he also did predestinate to be
[1:26:35] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:26:38] who he who Christ that Christ might be
[1:26:41] the firstborn among many brethren in
[1:26:44] other words there's many more children
[1:26:46] there's many more Sons coming just like
[1:26:48] Jesus he's the first of a long line of
[1:26:51] people just like him that's the next
[1:26:53] phase of the condescension of God Amen
[1:26:56] it'll be the same people in the same
[1:26:57] image doing the same works by The Same
[1:27:00] Spirit that's what he's showing what's
[1:27:01] happening there Jesus Christ is the
[1:27:03] template for you and I cut from the same
[1:27:07] cloth we're just a portion instead of
[1:27:09] the whole thing but we're Cut From the
[1:27:11] Same Cloth it's the same work that's
[1:27:13] going on Jesus would say so many times
[1:27:16] he shared so much with the disciples
[1:27:18] about what was going to happen and yet
[1:27:19] they had no clue as to the changes now
[1:27:21] some of that I think was perhaps because
[1:27:23] they thought they had
[1:27:25] it I mean what more could you ask for
[1:27:27] signs and wonders uh sicknesses go away
[1:27:30] demons flee the dead are raised you've
[1:27:32] got a message what more could you
[1:27:35] want but the scripture also says that
[1:27:37] their their understanding was was was
[1:27:39] hidden from the truth they couldn't see
[1:27:42] it God held it because it wasn't that
[1:27:44] time yet and Jesus remember what he said
[1:27:46] before he died he says I've got a lot
[1:27:48] more to tell you but you can't handle it
[1:27:50] yet you need the spirit of God before
[1:27:52] you can handle this so what you got is
[1:27:55] not enough you might have power and
[1:27:57] authority in a great ministry and signs
[1:27:58] and wonders but that's not the be all
[1:28:00] and end all the be all and end all is
[1:28:02] Unity with God a restored relationship
[1:28:06] with
[1:28:08] him remember what Jesus said he says
[1:28:10] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:28:13] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:28:15] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:28:19] these shall he do because I go to my
[1:28:20] father we've taught it before it doesn't
[1:28:22] mean you'll do things that are super
[1:28:24] Superior to him greater that way is that
[1:28:26] there'll be numerically more cuz Christ
[1:28:28] only really had his works for 3 and A2
[1:28:30] years one man and though he did
[1:28:32] thousands and thousands of Miracles now
[1:28:34] you got 2,000 years stretching in front
[1:28:36] of him with maybe millions of Believers
[1:28:38] filled with the spirit there's going to
[1:28:39] be more Works done by
[1:28:41] millions but notice what he says the
[1:28:44] next phase is that you step into my
[1:28:49] role
[1:28:51] whoa okay now now we're getting down to
[1:28:53] what he really wants to talk
[1:28:55] about you've got to keep doing what I've
[1:28:57] been doing all
[1:28:59] along and they would maybe say but Lord
[1:29:01] we've been doing it all along the demons
[1:29:04] they they obey us sicknesses flee the
[1:29:06] dead are raised what more could we want
[1:29:09] that ain't
[1:29:10] it it's perfect surrender and Leadership
[1:29:14] by God that's it that's it that's what
[1:29:18] will take us in church and that's what
[1:29:20] we're going to get into perfect
[1:29:22] surrender amen
[1:29:25] while he was
[1:29:26] here there were great things that
[1:29:30] happened but he wanted to step into a
[1:29:32] greater relationship with
[1:29:35] us while he was here great signs and
[1:29:37] wonders happened while God even
[1:29:40] condescended his father in that Pillar
[1:29:41] of Fire in the Old Testament wonderful
[1:29:44] things happened great signs and wonders
[1:29:46] but you ever notied church that having
[1:29:48] him with you is never enough It's never
[1:29:53] enough because as soon as he leaves we
[1:29:56] lose the effect of his presence we let
[1:29:59] me put it this way even when he's with
[1:30:01] us sometimes we lose the effect of his
[1:30:02] presence because of our lack of faith
[1:30:05] that's what he'd say to the disciples
[1:30:06] they come to him and say what are we
[1:30:07] going to do what are we going to do how
[1:30:09] are we going to deal with this and he
[1:30:10] say oh ye a little faith and then he'd
[1:30:12] handle the
[1:30:13] situation he was right there and yet
[1:30:15] their faith was not where it needed to
[1:30:17] be but when he's there it's great and
[1:30:20] when he's there the circumstances change
[1:30:23] but the problem is the people never
[1:30:24] change only the circumstances and we
[1:30:27] know that circumstances never stay the
[1:30:29] same we've said it before you get healed
[1:30:31] you're going to get sick again you get
[1:30:34] Victory today you're going to be in a
[1:30:35] battle tomorrow maybe you lose listen
[1:30:37] hardships might go away today and
[1:30:38] they'll be back tomorrow it's guaranteed
[1:30:41] that's what living in a sinful world
[1:30:43] does habits will come back and cling to
[1:30:45] us difficult decisions will cause us to
[1:30:47] compromise there's Victory when he's
[1:30:49] here but when he leaves what happens to
[1:30:51] the victory it goes and our peace and
[1:30:53] our goes with it amen David knew this
[1:30:57] that's why David said my one desire is
[1:31:00] to be in his temple in his presence
[1:31:04] that's the thing I got to do because
[1:31:06] when I'm in his presence that's when I
[1:31:07] get what I need and as soon as I'm not
[1:31:10] then things start to fall apart David
[1:31:12] say this in psalm 16 he says I have set
[1:31:15] the lord always before me because he is
[1:31:18] at my right hand I shall not be
[1:31:21] moved when he's there nothing nothing
[1:31:24] can touch me but take him away and we
[1:31:26] become like any other man just like
[1:31:29] Samson take him away church and we will
[1:31:32] fall just like every other person in
[1:31:33] this world
[1:31:35] Falls then he says Thou wi show me the
[1:31:38] path of life in thy presence is fullness
[1:31:42] of joy and at thy right hand there are
[1:31:45] Pleasures forever more the law could
[1:31:48] never get you in God's presence all the
[1:31:50] time it was occasional listen you could
[1:31:52] pray and he might come down and answer
[1:31:54] you but he had to go away he could not
[1:31:57] stay there amen we remember we read that
[1:31:59] quote he could be around us he could be
[1:32:01] with us temporarily he could even put an
[1:32:04] anointing on us but he could not dwell
[1:32:07] in us there could not be a permanence
[1:32:09] that was in there it was always a
[1:32:11] temporary thing we read this quote last
[1:32:13] service I want to remind us he couldn't
[1:32:15] enter into sin that was the problem
[1:32:18] under the law he said but he cleared his
[1:32:20] way as he went for God so loved man that
[1:32:22] he wants to come down in fellowship with
[1:32:24] him God tonight the same Jehovah God
[1:32:27] that spoke to Adam and Eve in the Garden
[1:32:29] of Eden lives in every born again man or
[1:32:31] woman trying his best to make you
[1:32:34] believe him have faith in him step out
[1:32:37] don't you doubt one bit so what's the
[1:32:39] phase change that's needed what's the
[1:32:41] transformation what's the condescension
[1:32:43] that needed God above us that was okay
[1:32:46] it helped us God With Us that was even
[1:32:48] better but we need him to come in us
[1:32:51] that's the condescension we need Church
[1:32:54] that's the Fulfillment of Ezekiel 36
[1:32:56] that's is the Fulfillment of Joel 2:28
[1:32:59] and that's to get us from the temporary
[1:33:01] to the permanent that's what we needed
[1:33:05] amen just consider what God had to do to
[1:33:09] Humble himself to come down and dwell
[1:33:11] amongst us in the body of
[1:33:13] Christ to come down and be rejected and
[1:33:16] spit on and beat and persecuted and lied
[1:33:21] about to be completely destroyed by
[1:33:24] those that he came to save how much did
[1:33:26] God had to Condes had to condescend to
[1:33:29] do
[1:33:30] that but now let's take him and put him
[1:33:32] into sinful flesh how much more does he
[1:33:34] have to Humble
[1:33:36] himself listen on my best
[1:33:40] day on your best day we are completely
[1:33:44] unworthy to stand in his presence much
[1:33:48] less to have him live inside of
[1:33:50] us remember what the prophet God said he
[1:33:52] says no man standing in the presence of
[1:33:55] God can judge another
[1:33:58] man because you're too caught up in how
[1:34:00] unworthy you are in his true presence
[1:34:05] amen can you imagine bring it down to
[1:34:08] our level asking King Charles to come
[1:34:11] and live in a dirty soggy cardboard box
[1:34:15] in an alley in George Street that's
[1:34:18] about as close as I can get to God
[1:34:20] coming down and living in my life even
[1:34:22] as a child of God
[1:34:24] because compared to his absolute
[1:34:26] Holiness Perfection and righteousness
[1:34:29] were all his filthy
[1:34:31] rigs perverted disgusting unacceptable
[1:34:35] that's it and yet he promised I'll come
[1:34:39] down and do it you talk about God
[1:34:41] condescending Church you talk about God
[1:34:45] condescending God said I'll do it I'll
[1:34:47] put my spirit within them I will live in
[1:34:50] these people doesn't come in while we're
[1:34:52] dirty
[1:34:54] that's what the blood's for that's what
[1:34:56] the works of Grace are for that's what
[1:34:58] justification is for to take away your
[1:35:01] sins and then sanctification is to clean
[1:35:03] up your life he won't come in while
[1:35:05] you're dirty he's got to clean up your
[1:35:07] life he'll take away everything that is
[1:35:09] unsuited for him and then when it's
[1:35:11] cleaned and ready for service what does
[1:35:13] he do he says this is my beloved child
[1:35:17] in whom I'm pleased to dwell and then he
[1:35:20] steps into your life you have the same
[1:35:22] experience that Christ did on the River
[1:35:24] Jordan church when he steps in he's
[1:35:26] saying you are acceptable to
[1:35:31] me that he can take a filthy person like
[1:35:35] me and say this is my beloved Son in
[1:35:38] whom I'm pleased to dwell that's what he
[1:35:40] does when he puts the spirit inside
[1:35:42] every child of God he says you're
[1:35:45] accepted you're
[1:35:47] acceptable you're good
[1:35:50] enough not because of my works
[1:35:54] that's the work of the blood and that's
[1:35:57] the work of the spirit in each and every
[1:35:59] one of our Lives amen church if God's
[1:36:01] willing to put up with us I think we can
[1:36:02] probably put up with each other a little
[1:36:03] more than we do
[1:36:06] sometimes and we can put up with
[1:36:08] ourselves as
[1:36:10] well I've said it before I believe that
[1:36:12] the closer you get to God the greater
[1:36:14] critic you become of yourself you stop
[1:36:16] pointing so much at other people because
[1:36:18] you're looking at your own life and
[1:36:20] saying God change me I believe that's a
[1:36:22] sign of immature believer but listen we
[1:36:24] can get a lot of Hang-Ups in this flesh
[1:36:27] I don't know if anybody gets Hang-Ups I
[1:36:28] get
[1:36:29] Hang-Ups I'm glad they're not
[1:36:31] hangovers but sometimes they can turn
[1:36:34] into spiritual hangovers because
[1:36:35] something happens and we fail ourselves
[1:36:38] and we fail God and we can sit there and
[1:36:40] say am I even a child of God and then we
[1:36:43] say am I an
[1:36:44] overcomer let me tell you one thing you
[1:36:47] always were a child of God that was
[1:36:49] decided way before you made your mistake
[1:36:51] you always were and you always will be
[1:36:53] that doesn't change are you living the
[1:36:55] life of an overcomer maybe not some days
[1:36:59] maybe not some days I don't feel like an
[1:37:02] overcomer but listen when you're in the
[1:37:04] middle of the battle there's no
[1:37:06] overcoming all there is is
[1:37:08] fighting it may be a day where you
[1:37:11] fought and some days we take steps back
[1:37:14] some days we hold our ground and some
[1:37:16] days we take steps
[1:37:18] forward don't worry about the winning
[1:37:20] and the
[1:37:21] losing worry about the fighting
[1:37:24] stay in the battle cuz sometimes we've
[1:37:27] been fighting for so long we don't lose
[1:37:30] we just lay down our weapon and we say
[1:37:32] I'm sick and tired of
[1:37:34] fighting I'm sick and tired of dealing
[1:37:37] with
[1:37:38] this cuz things can build up I I meant
[1:37:41] to mention brother Nelson guy before
[1:37:43] service you talk about a man that's in a
[1:37:45] battle every part of his body's giving
[1:37:47] him problems these days and you know how
[1:37:49] much he loves to be out in the woods and
[1:37:51] he's stuck in his house on his couch
[1:37:54] CU he can't walk he can't be around he's
[1:37:56] so beat up his body is just failing him
[1:37:58] in so many ways keep him in prayer keep
[1:38:00] him in prayer but everything is just
[1:38:02] building up on
[1:38:04] him and it's hard to fight every single
[1:38:07] day without anything that seems to be
[1:38:09] happening seems like nothing's going on
[1:38:12] I'm not making any
[1:38:14] progress fight
[1:38:16] anyways fight anyways be good soldiers
[1:38:20] fight anyways because listen victory's
[1:38:23] coming
[1:38:24] victory's coming our part church is to
[1:38:27] resist scripture doesn't say resist the
[1:38:30] devil and you'll win the
[1:38:33] battle it says resist and he'll end up
[1:38:36] fleeing but it's not by my spirit it's
[1:38:38] by his spirit it's not by my power it's
[1:38:40] by his power it's not by my works it's
[1:38:42] going to be by his Works
[1:38:44] amen sometimes our life isn't overcoming
[1:38:47] If we're honest sometimes we slip and
[1:38:51] fall say I might as well stop stop don't
[1:38:54] stop scripture says a righteous man
[1:38:56] falls seven times and gets up
[1:38:58] again we all fall we all
[1:39:02] fail get up and keep
[1:39:06] going he said if there's no battle then
[1:39:09] there's no
[1:39:10] Victory if I walked out
[1:39:13] today I'm a car guy and there's a brand
[1:39:16] new Ferrari there and the keys were in
[1:39:18] it and I got in and took the keys that
[1:39:20] Ferrari and drove away where's the
[1:39:22] victory
[1:39:23] I'm winning at life some might say but
[1:39:26] there's no Victory I didn't do anything
[1:39:28] to deserve it I didn't do anything to
[1:39:30] earn it that's not a victory that's a
[1:39:32] gift but you want a victory there's got
[1:39:34] to be a battle that comes first you got
[1:39:36] to have a part in that to have a
[1:39:39] victory I've always wondered you know in
[1:39:42] sports you got some guys that are on a
[1:39:44] team but they never come off the bench
[1:39:46] and then they win the championship
[1:39:48] that's got to be one of the hollow
[1:39:49] things for an athlete is you win a
[1:39:52] championship you never played
[1:39:59] for there no Victory without a battle he
[1:40:03] says but you've got to have a battle to
[1:40:04] have Victory if it was just given to you
[1:40:06] it wouldn't be a victory but he that
[1:40:08] overcometh is the one who has the
[1:40:10] victory so Jesus came to Earth he had a
[1:40:13] battle he won the Victory and tonight we
[1:40:15] have a battle and with Christ we can
[1:40:18] have the
[1:40:19] victory Christ was trying to tell the
[1:40:22] disciples there's change
[1:40:23] coming you think you've got it you don't
[1:40:26] got it there's something coming that's
[1:40:28] greater than anything you've received
[1:40:30] any Ministry you've had and he gifts
[1:40:32] signs wonders there's a Plan of
[1:40:34] Redemption that's in in motion now and
[1:40:37] the revealing of God is going to change
[1:40:39] the condescending of God is going to
[1:40:41] change he says I'm going away and I'm
[1:40:43] coming back it'll be me but it won't be
[1:40:46] the same me that you saw LEF I'll be in
[1:40:49] a different form remember we read this
[1:40:51] earlier as we start to close he said yet
[1:40:54] a little while and the world sees me no
[1:40:55] more but ye see me and because I live
[1:40:58] you shall live also what is it now we're
[1:41:01] coming into a law of life not a law of
[1:41:05] sin and death it's a law of life because
[1:41:07] I live you shall live also the law that
[1:41:10] we have is if the spirit's in us we live
[1:41:13] and the way that we live is because of
[1:41:14] that spirit it's a law of life it's a
[1:41:16] law of Liberty it's a law of Grace it's
[1:41:18] a law of Freedom it's a law of
[1:41:20] restoration Paul would say it this way
[1:41:22] in Romans 8 he says for the law of the
[1:41:24] spirit of
[1:41:26] Life Paul had talked about the law uh of
[1:41:30] sin and death now he says we've got a
[1:41:32] new law and it's a law of the spirit of
[1:41:34] life in Christ Jesus has made me free
[1:41:37] from the law of sin and death amen
[1:41:41] notice it's not the law of the spirit of
[1:41:44] the death of Jesus
[1:41:45] Christ it's the law of the spirit of
[1:41:49] Life see you got to take everything from
[1:41:51] Calvary not just the death you need the
[1:41:53] life that came afterwards cuz that's the
[1:41:55] law that we're living under is the spir
[1:41:57] is the law of the spirit of the Life of
[1:41:59] Christ not just the blood of
[1:42:01] Christ you get
[1:42:03] it amen if he never Rose from the grave
[1:42:08] we'd be no further ahead
[1:42:10] today because we need the same life and
[1:42:13] the life had to prove itself it had to
[1:42:15] show that it had conquered death hell
[1:42:18] and the grave because that's the exact
[1:42:20] same thing it's got to do in you and I
[1:42:23] but you know what I see when I read this
[1:42:25] he says the law of the spirit of life
[1:42:27] has made me free from the law of sin and
[1:42:29] death that means today if you're in
[1:42:33] bondage something in you is
[1:42:37] illegal because you got a law the spirit
[1:42:40] of life that makes you free so if you
[1:42:42] got something that's binding you
[1:42:44] remember brother Bram says he says you
[1:42:45] call the sheriff of the Holy Spirit and
[1:42:48] it'll deal with what's holding you back
[1:42:50] in your life cuz you now got a light a
[1:42:53] law of life and Liberty not a law of sin
[1:42:56] and death so if you've got sin and death
[1:42:58] reigning it has to come subject to this
[1:43:00] because this is the law we're under now
[1:43:02] the law of Freedom amen what is this
[1:43:05] last one it's the condescension of God
[1:43:07] It's the final condescension of God it's
[1:43:09] God in us it's God using us it'll be
[1:43:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:43:13] and forever that's what Hebrews 13:7
[1:43:16] and8 say considering the conversation
[1:43:18] the life of those that have authority
[1:43:20] over you their life shows Jesus Christ
[1:43:22] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:43:24] it's not our works now it's his work
[1:43:27] it's not our power it's his power it's
[1:43:29] not our Authority it's his authority
[1:43:31] it's not just an anointing it's the
[1:43:34] Supreme
[1:43:36] anointing amen it'll be God
[1:43:39] condescending one final time living in a
[1:43:41] people producing Christ all over again
[1:43:44] and it'll be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:43:47] watch this as we close now he says for
[1:43:49] we have this treasure in Earth and
[1:43:51] vessels
[1:43:53] that the Excellency of the power may be
[1:43:56] of God and not of us in other words we
[1:44:00] know our
[1:44:03] limits as Samuel says there are
[1:44:07] limits we have
[1:44:09] limits we have limits of
[1:44:12] patience rest
[1:44:16] trust
[1:44:19] strength we've got limits he says God's
[1:44:22] us losing a vessel that has obvious
[1:44:25] limitations so that we know it ain't me
[1:44:29] it's
[1:44:31] him that's where you're sitting this
[1:44:34] evening in these Earth and vessels with
[1:44:37] the very power of almighty God dwelling
[1:44:39] inside of you so that we know that the
[1:44:42] power is his not ours we are troubled on
[1:44:45] every side yet not
[1:44:47] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:44:51] despair see the condition s have not
[1:44:53] changed under this New
[1:44:55] Covenant who's changed church we
[1:44:59] have persecuted but not
[1:45:03] forsaken see the under the the the the
[1:45:05] old Covenant when they were persecuted
[1:45:08] it was because they were out of the good
[1:45:09] graces of God they had messed up now
[1:45:13] Paul says we're persecuted but that
[1:45:14] doesn't mean we're forsaken it has
[1:45:16] nothing to do with our spiritual
[1:45:18] condition we're persecuted because we're
[1:45:20] children of God not because we've
[1:45:21] disobeyed necessarily he says we're cast
[1:45:24] down but we're not destroyed always
[1:45:26] bearing about in the body the dying of
[1:45:28] the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[1:45:31] Jesus might be made manifest in our body
[1:45:34] what is it it's the law of the spirit of
[1:45:36] Life of Christ Jesus manifesting itself
[1:45:38] in you and I he says now holy God could
[1:45:42] not condone sin so nothing could touch
[1:45:45] the mountain where God was then God was
[1:45:48] made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the
[1:45:49] form of Jesus Christ his son his
[1:45:52] creation then that son gave his life and
[1:45:55] the blood cell of God was broken that
[1:45:57] the life might come out of the blood to
[1:46:00] us through that blood we are cleansed
[1:46:03] and now our blood our life which came by
[1:46:05] living through sexual desire brought our
[1:46:07] life in the world but the blood of Jesus
[1:46:10] Christ cleanses us it changes our Nature
[1:46:13] by sending upon us the Holy Spirit he
[1:46:15] says then we become into the divine
[1:46:19] nature of God and then we become a
[1:46:23] dwelling place for God God is not just
[1:46:26] with us now but this is the final
[1:46:28] condescension where he says I am you and
[1:46:31] you are me you have my nature you have
[1:46:35] my attributes you have my mind and you
[1:46:38] are surrendered to all of those things
[1:46:41] we become a dwelling place for God he
[1:46:44] said Jesus said at that day you'll know
[1:46:46] that I'm in the Father the father in me
[1:46:48] and I in you and you and me know how
[1:46:50] that God is in his church he says the
[1:46:53] church is now supposed to be taking the
[1:46:56] place of Christ carrying on his
[1:47:02] ministry the church is now supposed to
[1:47:05] be taking the place of Christ carrying
[1:47:08] on his ministry he that believeth on me
[1:47:11] the works that I do shall he do also yet
[1:47:13] a little while in the world seeth me no
[1:47:15] more yet you shall see me for I'll be
[1:47:16] with you even in you to the end of the
[1:47:18] world he says there it is carrying on
[1:47:21] his work next service we're going to
[1:47:24] look at what that looks like what is the
[1:47:26] effect of the spirit on the believer
[1:47:29] that final Dwelling Place of God and I
[1:47:30] want to dig deep into what Paul said
[1:47:32] Paul I mean it's not Paul it's the Holy
[1:47:34] Spirit speaking through Paul but Paul
[1:47:35] could give us such a
[1:47:37] perfect understanding of what it's like
[1:47:40] to live in this flesh and to live in the
[1:47:42] spirit at the same time and to
[1:47:44] understand the frustrations and the
[1:47:45] failings that come with these bodies
[1:47:47] were Bound
[1:47:48] in and yet be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:47:51] the manifested word yet in the
[1:47:54] conditions we're in
[1:47:56] sometimes like I said it's so easy to
[1:47:58] get hung up on this flesh and our mind
[1:48:00] and the things we battle like I said
[1:48:02] just keep fighting our role is to keep
[1:48:04] fighting it's up to God to bring the
[1:48:06] victory Paul fought and sometimes Paul
[1:48:09] won and sometimes Paul
[1:48:11] lost Peter fought sometimes he won
[1:48:14] sometimes he
[1:48:16] lost but get back up and keep fighting
[1:48:19] amen none of us wins every battle but I
[1:48:22] I want you to see tonight from the
[1:48:24] Eternal we've already won that's the
[1:48:26] beauty of it like brother Hank Snow said
[1:48:28] to me he says listen the script already
[1:48:30] is already written the play is already
[1:48:32] done and we're just going through our
[1:48:35] parts right now that old song I've read
[1:48:37] the back of the book and we win God's
[1:48:39] already got us in a place of Victory
[1:48:43] with a prize with an inheritance a
[1:48:45] position he's got everything planned
[1:48:48] waiting for us all we have to do keep
[1:48:51] fighting how do you you keep fighting
[1:48:53] Church stay with the word that's it stay
[1:48:57] with the word that's how we fight we
[1:48:59] wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:49:01] we're not fighting against people we're
[1:49:02] not fighting against situations it's a
[1:49:04] spiritual warfare and so you got to
[1:49:05] fight with a spiritual weapon and the
[1:49:07] only thing you need is the word of God
[1:49:09] Amen quickened by the
[1:49:12] spirit one last scripture as we close he
[1:49:15] says who shall lay anything to the
[1:49:17] charge of God's elect it's God that
[1:49:20] justifieth who is he that condemneth it
[1:49:22] is Christ that died ye rather that is
[1:49:24] risen again who is even at the right
[1:49:26] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[1:49:28] for us who shall separate us from the
[1:49:31] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[1:49:34] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:49:36] nakedness or Peril or sword as it is
[1:49:39] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:49:42] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[1:49:45] for the slaughter anybody been killed
[1:49:47] all the day long
[1:49:49] recently brother Grant you've been
[1:49:51] killed all the day long recently
[1:49:56] sometimes it feels like you're getting
[1:49:57] killed over and over again sometimes
[1:49:59] it's Death By A Thousand Cuts By A th
[1:50:02] paper cuts right isn't it just that
[1:50:06] where it's just aggravation on
[1:50:08] aggravation things poking trying to get
[1:50:10] a response out of you trying to get you
[1:50:12] to lose your temper trying to get you to
[1:50:14] lose your faith trying to take away your
[1:50:16] peace trying to take away your rest
[1:50:18] trying to put in questions that nobody
[1:50:20] can answer one thing after or
[1:50:23] another killed all the day
[1:50:27] long he says nay in all these things we
[1:50:31] are more than conquerors through him
[1:50:34] that loved us church I don't even know
[1:50:36] how to explain what more than conquerors
[1:50:38] means listen either you're a winner or
[1:50:41] you're a loser he says you're more than
[1:50:42] a winner I don't I can't even Define
[1:50:45] that I don't know how you can be more
[1:50:47] than something that is top dog but he
[1:50:49] says whatever it is you're more than it
[1:50:52] you're beyond
[1:50:54] Victory you're beyond Victory you're
[1:50:57] beyond just winning and
[1:50:59] losing maybe the fact is it's because
[1:51:01] we've already
[1:51:04] won we've been made more than conquerors
[1:51:07] through him that loved us and he says
[1:51:09] for I'm persuaded he asked do all these
[1:51:11] things separates he says I'm persuaded
[1:51:13] that neither death nor
[1:51:16] life sometimes it feels like death would
[1:51:18] be a welcome rest
[1:51:24] if you've ever really been in a trial
[1:51:26] sometimes it seems like Lord just take
[1:51:27] me and let me go to perfect peace if you
[1:51:29] know you're a child of God if you know
[1:51:31] you've been sealed with the spirit it
[1:51:33] shouldn't matter if we go tomorrow and
[1:51:36] sometimes it seems like that would be
[1:51:37] better than dealing with the struggles
[1:51:38] and the trials of this
[1:51:40] life he says listen death won't separate
[1:51:43] us life nor angels nor principalities
[1:51:46] nor powers nor governments nor Trump nor
[1:51:49] Trudeau nor things present nor things to
[1:51:52] come nor height nor
[1:51:55] depth David said if I go to the depths
[1:51:58] of the sea you're there if I go up to
[1:52:02] the highest of heights you're there if I
[1:52:04] go to the depths of the sea you're there
[1:52:06] even the darkness can hide nothing from
[1:52:08] you and with your hand you'll lead
[1:52:11] me he says nor things
[1:52:14] present nor things to come how often do
[1:52:17] we borrow tomorrow's troubles and bring
[1:52:18] them into
[1:52:20] today he says nor height nor dep nor any
[1:52:24] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:52:26] us from the love of God which is in
[1:52:29] Christ Jesus our lord amen God bless you
[1:52:33] let's stand this
[1:52:37] evening
[1:52:40] amen Church we're in a wonderful
[1:52:42] wonderful place
[1:52:44] today when you consider the
[1:52:46] condescension of God to live inside of
[1:52:50] us when you look at the potential
[1:52:53] that lies within you it's a resurrecting
[1:52:56] power it's a rapturing power it's a body
[1:52:59] changing power it's a healing power it's
[1:53:01] a saving power it's a leading power it's
[1:53:04] a providing power it's a resting power
[1:53:08] everything you have need of is inside of
[1:53:10] you if you've got the Holy
[1:53:12] Spirit what's the thing that clogs it up
[1:53:16] Life
[1:53:18] Time
[1:53:20] commitments we need to take
[1:53:23] time you know I have to study a lot to
[1:53:26] preach of course sometimes I can rely on
[1:53:28] that you know I I have my own little
[1:53:30] devotion book where I write down things
[1:53:32] that strike me in the scriptures as I'm
[1:53:34] reading them in personal devotions but
[1:53:36] sometimes I go and it's been four days
[1:53:37] since I've had my actual Bible reading
[1:53:39] for devotions personally I may have
[1:53:42] studied but that personal devotion time
[1:53:44] to just sit down and let God deal with
[1:53:46] you you know and I find if I miss that I
[1:53:49] start to struggle even with all the
[1:53:51] studying that hours and hours of of
[1:53:53] preaching studying that I do but when I
[1:53:56] leave that time just for him that's
[1:53:58] where I tend to get the big
[1:54:00] breakthroughs because I'm giving him
[1:54:02] time to clear out those channels to
[1:54:05] answer those questions to take things to
[1:54:08] him and leave them there to lay them
[1:54:11] before him you know I've got questions
[1:54:13] I've talked many times and and I read
[1:54:15] the the the thing that answer that
[1:54:16] question about how do we get to from
[1:54:18] 30-fold to 60-fold to 100-fold in the
[1:54:20] kingdom of God and then I finally get an
[1:54:23] answer and it's
[1:54:24] surrender but I've asked that question
[1:54:27] for months but all of a sudden what does
[1:54:29] he do he gives you an answer and it
[1:54:31] takes us being still and it's one thing
[1:54:34] I've noticed so much I don't know if
[1:54:36] this is if this is the way it works for
[1:54:38] everyone maybe it's different for
[1:54:39] preachers but all I know is if I can get
[1:54:42] quiet things start to come to me if you
[1:54:45] just get quiet and start to let God work
[1:54:48] I'm not sure why I'm saying this this
[1:54:50] evening but if you'll just sit quiet
[1:54:52] quietly and dwell on the things of God I
[1:54:56] find it just starts to come to you and
[1:54:59] then you can open your Bible you can go
[1:55:02] to prayer and things just start to come
[1:55:04] together and that peace you're looking
[1:55:06] for that rest that answer that direction
[1:55:08] whatever it might be it just starts to
[1:55:10] come there but it takes that time to
[1:55:11] just sit down and say God will you talk
[1:55:14] to me for a
[1:55:16] bit sometimes we just want to do all the
[1:55:19] Talking sometimes we need to just sit
[1:55:20] down and say Lord what would you have
[1:55:23] your servant to
[1:55:26] know I'm standing in the need of prayer
[1:55:28] Lord I've asked now it's time for me to
[1:55:30] do some listening and I find without
[1:55:33] fail he comes down and he starts to
[1:55:36] talk and all of a sudden those things
[1:55:38] I'm looking for start to become clear
[1:55:40] and situations start to resolve it's not
[1:55:42] that circumstances change it's that my
[1:55:44] feelings about it my opinions of it my
[1:55:46] thoughts about it my Approach my
[1:55:48] attitude attitude starts to change why
[1:55:51] cuz he's right here here he's right here
[1:55:54] I don't have to bring him down then I
[1:55:57] when we get quiet Church what we're
[1:55:58] doing is we're letting him come out
[1:56:01] that's all we're not suppressing him
[1:56:04] with I got to do this and I got to do
[1:56:06] that and I got to be here and I got to
[1:56:08] study for this and I got this at work
[1:56:10] and my
[1:56:12] no we got to let him out and let him do
[1:56:15] the work sometimes we can get so caught
[1:56:18] up even in our own Duty as Believers
[1:56:22] that we forget he's trying to come out
[1:56:23] and have a relationship with us and that
[1:56:26] peace comes from
[1:56:27] relationship not from works it comes
[1:56:30] from spending that time with him
[1:56:33] amen so if you're
[1:56:35] feeling like you've been killed all the
[1:56:37] day
