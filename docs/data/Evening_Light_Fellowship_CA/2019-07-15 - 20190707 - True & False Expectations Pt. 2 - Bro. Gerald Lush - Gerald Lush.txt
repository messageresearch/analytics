doesn't stop working sister and brother go and help him so the grace of God so we pray grant God's grace to us in this service a man and also to just remind us concerning something that's going on in the world something that the prophet of God put a lot of emphasis on and it's it's taking place now and of course one of the things was something that brother Alec sent me an article on and it's on the internet somewhere and has to do with intimidating Christians and tried to prevent Christians from moving forward they met is make no mistake it says though the world is trying to intimidate and marginalize Christians they met and some nations use overt persecution to browbeat believers and that's the truth the more we stand for the gospel the greater the opposition a man they just want Christianity to be just like any other religion a man and again they put the emphasis on in America now that you're not allowed to go out and publicly witness to this one publicly witness to that one regarding your Christian walk and your Christian talk and so on that's the truth and I did as I said I did get in contact with the American Civil Rights and so on and I told him I said that I said that's not right you shouldn't you shouldn't bring that law and you shouldn't enforce that law I says preventing Christians from witnessing I said we can't even obey the first commandment that Jesus gave us to go forth and be witnesses to this one witness to that one and so on and I said I said you want to allow one let one let us do it so and they said well pastor that's the law and we do have clergy on our board and they're enforcing it I said well I said Jesus I wanted a Hmong the disciples I said he was called Judas so I guess you got the newest Judas Tyrians on your board and so they never come back they wouldn't they wouldn't come in a man but it is to Judas tereus a man that's betraying the Christian life the Christian testimony and witness in these days this is her brother citrus is getting more serious please I pray God by grace as we get into the message on again on what our brother LaFontaine was ministering on concerning true or false expectations what are you expecting a man when a cop we were expecting this expecting that yes but there's something else that God wants us to expect a man that goes beyond what they're doing what about what God is doing amen sir are we expecting the promise of God so I pray the grace of God be with us when we get in to some more thoughts and that's just not my thoughts but the thoughts of the Prophet and what he has highlighted concerning expectation a man and what we should be expecting always should be expecting and he said there's no expectation is you're not going to get anything he said be if you want it you got to expect it they met so the grace of God that in the light of what's going on in the world and the pressure that's coming down on Christianity brothers sisters that were good we're going to hunger and thirst more and more for what God has given us to expect in this hour and in this age a man and also there's another issue regarding whether the problem of God did say is coming to a place with Christianity he said you won't be allowed to pray for the sick he said if you're if they catch you pray for the sick he said they'll shoot you yeah so I believe that because the world we're living in as I said it's not the world we lived in a few years ago or a year ago we're living in an insane world that's the truth so brother there's things happen people do things that you knew wouldn't be dreamed up years ago but now the world is insane so you can expect anything to happen so the grace of God be with us in our expectation that it'll be a holy ghost expectation and also this past a few days there have been a number of earthquakes in California a man and the earlier this week when it happened in California and I believe it was something like 6.4 magnitude and and it not only affected California but also affected British Columbia and they were experiencing things in British Columbia that was the result of the earthquake in California they may and again on Friday there was another earthquake in California this time not 6 point something but it was seven point one a man was the magnitude and where was it in California amazing it was near death valley park you know brother it's coming and months after but rather rather months after this earthquake aftershocks could follow the California's magnitude of 7.1 amen so it's going to get worse until we know as the power of God said that California is going under that's right and he said he said he's going to be so salt so many hundred miles this into into inland and he said it'll go he said fifteen hundred miles I and so on so it's going it's going to include British Columbia as well so we pray the grace of God because now these things are just signs for us to look up they may not to continue with this life without without putting the focus on the spiritual part of the emphasis on spirit but in the emphases on what God has promised in this hour by the grace of God so he said the prophet of God did say California is going under and he said he saw he said he said there's 400 water went 400 miles the it comes to California and 1,500 miles and he said it's going to go right around he said the world and he said it's going to come up even in the Atlantic and he said it's going to go 400 miles inland he said even to Kentucky amazing yeah I believe it so brother grace of God to us that we're going to not be forwarding ourselves when it comes to expecting this expecting that but yes those things are coming but what does God want us to expect more than that what does God want us to focus on more than that it is the resurrection and the rapture and if you're not expecting it you're not going to experience it that's right probably God says you've got to expect it if you want to be a part of it you've got to be expecting it amen and and if you're expecting it then you're going to be on your guard you're gonna be watching you're gonna be by the grace of God lining up with this making sure everything is in line with the Word of God amen to get into the resurrection and the rapture amen so I pray grace that we're not here for that for that great earthquake I pray grace brother if that goes down I pray grace God's gonna take us off amen and also greetings from our brother George Smith presently our brother is in Africa and I'm just waiting to hear back from him to see how long that he will be in Africa and of course he's been there a number of times so we pray god bless his ministry there as he ministers to the Saints in Africa and mine my encouragement is to head that the Lord will help our brother George to get the Africans to look up they met because oh when it comes to endtime evangelism what is the focusing on he's focusing on the bride get her ready for the rapture a man that's the endtime evangelism for the bride when it comes to the rest of the world as I've told it recently the prophet of God said we won't reach everyone with this message no just the bride the message is for the bride to give the bride rapturing faith to get out of here amen so that that's what the message is for when it comes to evangelism you can take that out to other parts of the world but it's testifying of Jesus testifying of the Lord Jesus Christ trying to get people to acknowledge Christ and so on by the grace of God but not the message that's only for the right amen so many are called few are chosen by the grace of God amen the Lord bless you this day in this thing only believe all things are possible only believe as we go to the word [Music] Oh wager possible only believe [Music] a management evil [Music] the resurrection the rapture amen praise the Lord Lord [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Lord Jesus is that Jesus is here Jesus is with us Jesus is in a Seimei hallelu [Music] raise the name Jesus hallelujah the resurrection the rapture in our Lord Jesus trying to say man [Music] Oh [Music] Jesus is praying Transco pray [Music] [Music] [Music] try Oh [Music] Oh Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] father your grace that will pray and trust you Lord going on just saying that we believe but Lord the grace that it's manifested Lord and proven

in my brothers and sisters in this assembly I pray that grace in my brothers and sisters Lord in the hearing of my voice online or father and while there wherever they are in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ here across the island around the world father they'll have the testimony they'll have the witness that is Christ and living in them that it is the word for this hour for this age that is made flesh in us a man grace Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ father that we truly any man have the revelation of God that we truly are the servants of God that we truly Lord are the sons and daughters of God a man that we our Father living in the light and we are walking in the light Amen praise the name of the Lord father that we want to come to that that part time Lord a full adoption a man father of the sons and daughters of God Alleluia the proof Lord that where we come from we're going back to any man that we come from God we're going back to God so we ask for that grace Oh God in our lives to keep pressing on a man to keep believing with all of our hearts to keep expecting with all of our hearts to change keep expecting the resurrection to keep expecting the rapture father we'll only be a part of us if we're expecting us pray in the name of Jesus morning noon and night Lord we are looking for the rapture that we are expecting the rapture father Alleluia to be on our guard to be on our toes Lord that when we hear of this when we see this we when we feel that Lord we a week will be thinking above the rapture amen amen amen praise the name of the Lord are not just expecting the natural things of life but we're expecting Lord the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Lord we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Lord than today Christ's are going to be caught up and he may change in a moment and we're gonna be caught up with him to meet the Lord in the air Alleluia father we're living in that our Lord and the old mile mile mind we needed in this hour father you and again Lord you promised it's you shorten time if you didn't there be no flesh say but for the elects sake Lord you shorten time Alleluia for the elects sake to bring us into the resurrection to bring us into the rapture to make the reality bit Lord to make it and live in us by the grace of Almighty God so have mercy on us Lord we pray for your glory your honor your praise amen to build us up in the most holy faith father with a greater and a greater and a greater expectation of the fulfillment of the word in us the fulfillment of the word Lord through us for the glory of God grace forgive us of our sin forgive us of our shortcomings forgive us of our failures forgive us of our stablish forgive us Lord Father but putting the emphasis on the natural father ignoring the spiritual help us lord we pray for the promise of God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God merci merci merci amen grace in the name of Jesus Christ to know that we are more than conquerors in Christ now I believe [Music] a man praise the Lord turn with me to the Book of Psalms chapter 62 Psalms 62 a man and beginning to read that verse 1 and again I want to continue with some thoughts on the true or the false expectation we want to make sure that we have a true expectation that it is based on the word it is absolutely proven by the Scriptures Amen remembering again that what God has done and what God is doing what God will do is all in the word and again man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so I pray the grace of God that we're going to be in the word that we're going to be studying the word we're going to be watching the word and brother whatever we're seen out there in the world we want to bring it back to the scriptures and say it is written or it is us saith the Lord that this was going to happen or that's going to happen a man and all of it is plane to the resurrection and the rapture so that when we see these things out there then we got to do what the Bible tells us to do and that is to look up a man and the only way that we can look up is that we got to have an expectation to look up what are we expecting a man what are we looking for that when we see these things cover the pass in California when we see these things come to pass in other other countries concerning anti-christian teachings and so on brothers sisters whatever we got to do the Bible says look up when you see these things for the day of your redemption is drawing near amen it is the resurrection it is the rapture so what we got to be expecting is the change we're going to be expecting the resurrection we got to be expecting the rapture amen constantly a man on our hearts and in our hearts the revelation of what God is doing and in the Book of Psalms and in chapter 62 and verse 1 truly my soul waited upon God and from em cometh my salvation a man he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved a man I trust that what's going on in the world is not going to move us or to change our faith or the weaken our faith it's going to increase our faith a man so he said how long will he imagine mischief against a man he shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall DB and as a doddering fence they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency and they delight in lies they bless with their mouth and they curse inwardly Selah but he said my soul waited only upon God a man our faith is in God our faith is in the Word of God a man and we're going as her brother just refrain from faith to faith a man and it says my expectation is from him a man through the word praise the Lord God always gives us the word to create in us the expectation of what he's going to do so I pray the grace of God that we got the revelation in this day and in this hour of the word and it as and it is creating in us the revelation of what God is doing and what God is going to do amen so we are expecting the resurrection we're expecting the rapture there is nothing else in the scripture for the Christian believer to look for any man for the Bride of Christ to look for is the resurrection and the rapture well some say I'm looking for this to happen for that to happen brother brother concerning the resurrection rapture everything that God promised to point to the resurrection God has done everything that God promised to give us the resurrection right through faith God has done a man he has vindicated it through the Ministry of the Prophet praise the name of the Lord and it was ordained they made in the opening of the word to give us resurrection at Rajshri faith amen that is the third pole that is the conclusion of what God began in the Ministry of Malachi for that is the conclusion of what God started in William branham's ministry in doing what he did a man and I want to share with you some of the thoughts that he expressed on expectation a man I was surprised at the number of times that he preached on it a man just in ten years he preached on it pointing to it and then he did it a man by the grace of Almighty God to a place is you got to expect you got to expect and then brother then you then don't praise the Lord to to to to fulfill it God the noin of the Prophet a man with a with the OB of the seven seals with the third pole of his ministry any man to give us wrap three faiths praise the Lord any man so brother to create in us the expectation for the rapture Amen so that we'll know what to expect we're not expecting this when I expected a we're expecting the resurrection of the rapture others maybe their word the world's looking for a Greg the Great Tribulation they're looking for this to happen the Antichrist and all these things brother listen God is not pointing us to the Antichrist God as funny as to the road through the word to Christ praise the Lord but so many are focusing on the Antichrist but not Christ if we focus on Christ we're going to get the revelation and the faith for the resurrection and the rapture your focus on the Antichrist you're just going to get faith for the root for the Great Tribulation amen but brother we're not going into the Great Tribulation we are the wise virgins that are going into hurry to the rapture and into the marriage supper of the Lamb a man raised to us brother he says my gain in verse life my soul wait thou only upon go God for my expectation is from him and he only is my rock a man and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved praise the Lord Grace in god is my salvation and my glory the ragga my strength and my refuge is in God a man it says trusted in their trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Selah god bless his words you may be seated amen turn with me to proverbs chapter 23 proverbs 23 amen and the gain to read at verse 15 let's go to verse 12 apply thine art on to instruction a man to get the problem expectation you've got to take the instructions of God apply the hard on to instruction and I nears to the words of knowledge withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die thou shalt beat him with the rod and shall deliver his soul from hell a man train up a child in the way he should go according to the will of God my son if I heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine yay my reign shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things a man that our conversation be in the word and according to the word that our conversation be in the revelation and according to the revelation that God has given us in this hour encouraging one another concerning the the promise of God concerning the policy of God because only what God has done we're encouraging one another a man pointing to the resurrection of the rapture a man so not to discourage us to say we're in the end time and this is happening and this is happening a man yes it is when it comes to when it comes to the negative things there are many negative things happening but God has given to us the revelation of the positive a man to encourage us for the resurrection and the rapture but still many are focusing on the negative things but not the positive things and I believe this is where our brother Paula Fontaine was planning the emphasis to get us to focus on the true expectations or not the false expectations does get a focus on what God has given us in this hour and in this age to expect a man so brother is not is not what they're teaching out there is what God ordained for the bride in this hour and in this age so there is a true expectation and there is a false expectation that the enemy is putting the the the fall six of the emphasis on those expectations and he's going to try to interpret it or misinterpret it for you concerning the resurrection and rapture a man concerning the message of the our old brothers and sisters we got we got a focus on the message not the messenger as I preach the many years ago I preached on the thought concerning maybe somebody come into your home with a message and maybe that a according to the message if you do did what the message told you to do that you become a millionaire if you did what the message so need to do you're going to have a lot of friends and so on but if you focused on the messenger and not the message then you're you're not going to inherit what the message tells you to do any man so you've got to focus on the message because there was a time when people would come to the door knock on your door and you go ahead and answer the door and there's a message and they would take the message but they talk to the messenger no no to say thank you sir I gotta go read the message but there are those that I play in the ambulance on the messenger the message you're the messenger how you doing today sir and what about this and what about that who are you where you come from and so on would you leave and let me go back to work a man but you got to go to the message a man you got to get into the message you got to focus on the message because the message is for you amen and that's the significance of it that well the whoever sent the message sent a messenger with it to your door you know maybe they could they would do it this way or do it that way in a more simple way but they paid for the messenger to deliver to you such was the importance of it amen and such was the importance of the message today Amen that God send a messenger amen he wasn't just going to leave it to us to go on and do this to go on and do the head you know when it comes to the letter of the word when it comes to the the mechanics of the word no no no he was going to send somebody that would read that would expect offense to make dynamics of the word amen praise the name of the Lord so that we would really would nice oh this is God there's something to this there's there's something important here a man or God would just God would just give me the the mechanics of it no God has said the dynamics of it a man to show us what he is and what he's going to do and what he wants you to expect a man all my brother's sister when God's first said the prophet of God in the Czar and in this age and he had those two signs they were expecting eeling they were expecting signs and wonders and more signs of wonders and for signs and wonders but the part of the God was ordained to get the people to believe and it's not just a belief signs and wonders but any man it was to get him to believe the word a man because the signs and the waters are pointing to the word by the grace of God no matter what when no matter what God has done down through the ages brother when God would do this God would do that it was to get your attention trusted to the to the word he was going to reveal a man so brothers with any whether it's in the Old Testament whether it's in the New Testament God always does this to get your attention any man why oh my god oh we we should be looking for this looking for that yes but God got to get our attention and then God gives us the word and the word think that the results of the word in our in our lives it's to get us to expect this and expect that amen it's a revelation of what God wants you to be looking for and expecting any may I did this but now I'm going to do this amen so your thoughts your focus your faith is what God is going to do a man is what it's got to be according to the prophecy a man and it's just not God doing it just just to show off but God is doing it for a reason God is doing it for a reason for our redemption for our salvation Amen hallelujah brother what God did in Luther's day was for a reason a man and he had he had to get their attention oh my look at look at what God did drug into oh my god allowed Luthor to do and God let him this way God let him that way creating it Luther a hunger and a thirst for justification a man and any any o God let him go his way on to finally God brought him back to the word anybody see his God bringing us back to the word again because why what knew that were looking for what Wesley was looking for well the Pentecostals were looking for what the bride is looking for is in the word a man brother if we got it we got to get back to the word to know what to expect a main the gotta to bring Luther back to the word to know what to expect concerning justification Wesley to know what to expect a certain extinct a vacation a man and the Pentecostals to know what to expect concerning the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit a man and brother again that the enemy was always there to create a false expectation and I say that's where all the denominations come from a man they they they they laughter the revelation of the word and instead of walking in the light well will live in this Amen no you got to walk in it amen it's gotta read your life it's got to reflect it but what do they do they got away from the revelation amen the spiritual revelation in their heart amen they got away from that and they begin to oh yeah and make it a doctrine and they made a denomination out of justification they made a denomination out of sanctification they made a denomination out of the gifts of the Spirit and the baptism of the holy ghost and brother when they when they went into a denominational spirit then the Holy Spirit laughed and moved on amen because they saw the way this is what God's going to do and this is all that we need no you need to keep walking in the light a man and the truth the truth Lutheran's say they walk in the light and they went on he went over I Wesley and the wind Methodist's they went on into the night on into the actually the Papa said they went on there because the med that has organized so quickly he said he said guarded the race on William Booth with Radar salvation a man so what he what did we love do booth do and he went on the Salvation Army went on with the revelation of justification and sanctification amen to take it on unto the time for the Pentecostal revival and brother game we know that the Salvation Army in nearing the end of their ministries they were calling for the Pentecostal revival they were hungry no thirsting for what they what they said that what Peter had on the day of Pentecost a man say again proving whether father God said in a message he said when God is going to do something he said before he does it he'll send the anointing ahead he'll send the Holy Ghost ahead and he said to create in the hearts of the people ie should a hunger and a search for what God's gonna do and he said then they then he said they'll start to cry for it and they'll start to pray for it amen hungry thirsty and well Luther who was hungry and thirsty for justification but and the method is wrong on Thursday for sanctification amen and on into the Salvation Army they began to hunger and thirst for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because they said and as I say it I've got the books at home were they were they said their servants and they said what we need is what they had on the day of Pentecost amen so God was creating them a hunger and thirst for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and then a number of years after God fulfilled a man in California they made God sent down the anointing of the Holy Ghost in Brooklyn again as a dry light the fact that well why is God brought the black brothers into the assembly here because brother that was that was the ones that God used for the Pentecostal revival it was the black brothers that were that were there in California Azusa Street and as I said they was standing here in the pulpit and pray and pray and pray and pray amen that was before the Pentecostal revival came and you think they get up there singing and preach no they get up there and pray amen and prayed why because there was God in them angry and thirsty for the baptism their hunger and thirst not just with a revelation of it now hung in a nursing for the experience a may as God wants us to hunger in search for the experience of the Resurrection and the experience of the rapture not just a revelation of it too often the individuals are cut out with a revelation I believe this I believe that I believe that are you experiencing it amen is God confirming your faith amen and coming to Africa to justify it in you a man by the by the power of the Holy Ghost amen Luther Luther and the revelation to finally God Prakriti that revelation in Luther he made it a reality in Luther anyway and experiencing Luther he was expecting it he got it and the father you got expected to get it a man and then Luther lived in a constant expectation of it to God amen MIT is anger and thirst amen and fulfill his expectation when he as I said when he went into the church and he opened the Bible said the just shall live by faith amen and he thought it was works he thought he had to do this into that and all the other do was accepted through Jesus hey my same whether the same ways that was sanctification same with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is Christ in us the hope of glory and it's the same with the resurrection rapture it is Christ in us amen he said I am the resurrection and there any was their answer amen so if he's in you then the resurrection is in you if it's in you the rapture is in you hey man father brought grace to us through our blood brothers sister we're not looking to that I gotta do this I gotta do this I got to accept what God has done amen oh my god do this now praise the Lord that's good what what did he do it in you hey man he did this in Luger eating Wesley a man but Wesley discovered that what he did in delivery dude no he was also in him a man was the faith for justification then he went on to the faith for sanctification amen and we go on to the faith for the baptism of the holy God we accept the faith we accept the revelation of what God has shame a mayor and that's where that's where the Pentecostal revival started and brother I tell you this I went around the world hey man if one of the greatest revivals beyond losers revival be on Wesley's revival the Pentecostal revival amen it was it was Austrian the the end of all things a man and as a part of God city's ministry and his message was the climax of the Pentecostal message a man praise the name of the Lord brother they were looking for the coming of the Lord the Pentecostals but brother they failed to recognize the way he was coming how he was coming a man and the ministry that would for run is coming a May a ministry for Randy's first coming and why the first coming was to turn the hearts of the other the Jewish fathers to the Pentecostal children a night and then he saw I'm going to turn the hearts of the children back to the father's amen because within there they had Pentecostal fathers now because they they also have left the revelation left what God had started a man now he now is the children down here the Pentecostal children he got to turn their hearts back to the Pentecostal father's a man so that what God did back there God is doing now in a in a personal relationship with a bride in these last days Amen this is tremendous brother of what God does and what he does it a man and it's to create in us the expectation a man of whether whether Pentecostal said Amen right but what about something else they were experiencing what was it it was the resurrection amen and looking for the rapture because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the resurrection of Christ in us amen obviously for the physical resurrection of the body he resurrects our soul he resurrects our spirit and we rapture today into heavenly places in Christ and as I said you had the quicken you as they made alive who were dead in sins and trespasses any bad we were resurrected a man and then we were caught up into a heavenly place to work for to hear the word the promise of what's going on in heavenly places Easter the word has been revealed a man to give us faith for this age faith for that age mate for the hour that we're living now and decreed in us the expectation what God wants in us amen okay whatever you want from God you got to expect it a man right on down through the Pentecostal right on into this age of the rest of the resurrection of rapturing faith brother are we expecting the rapture or just believing what God has done as our brother the fontaine bringing out is not not the message or it's the message amen we've got to move from what one God dude the person that God was using and come into what God is doing in the bride praise the knee this is tremendous brother amen because there are so many yet today even around the message that are focusing on the messenger the messenger the messenger God did this God did this yeah but what's God doing a man sure God did this we can we can put the emphasis on on the sign in the hand we can put the emphasis on the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart a man but brother sister we got the revelation of regarding the witness of it amen and what is it doing to us it's revealing Christ in us a man not just God him William Branham not just God with and round but now it is Christ in the bride and with the right a man the public God said I am the the best man he said unlike any in a wedding and what is the best man do in a natural way well he's to take the bride to take the Brier and put her hands in a in the end of the breakroom and so he said that's what I asked well that's what I'm ordained to do and that's what he did he took the hand of the bride and he took us over and he put our hand in the hand of the bridegroom amen and that's what he could preach the invisible union of the earthly bride and the heavenly bridegroom a man a man a man praise the name of the Lord the Christ was was molding and focusing on his bride all the way down through the church ages on defining there's a there's an invisible Union a man praise the name of the Lord before and it is to bring forth the the members of the bride ever going on that we're dating Christ they'll rise first and we which are alive remainder going to be changed and we're gonna be caught up together with them a man to meet the Lord in the air hallelujah brother sister God albers to have the true expectation not a false expectation but the true for we're in Christ is glorified we're in crisis magnified in you and in me by the grace of God a man created in us the expectation what for the resurrection yes rapture yes what else the marriage summer amen praise the name of the Lord we're going to cut it because amen and we go into the marriage supper and the door shut amen praise the name of the Lord and the foolish virgins going to come and try to get in always I don't know you what I mean he didn't know he meant that he didn't had no intimate relationship with them or they had a relationship with him but not like the bride amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah old brothers sister and that that is that is the that that that brings to marriage to as a work to it to of to full meaning you're married when you can do that seems like I said we live in a three-room house kitchen that's we eat a man they live in Rome that's real fair and in the bedroom is where you consummate the marriage amen but they're foolish virgin he said he didn't he they had no real normal relation to the extent that their relationship with him was consummated no no not that they weren't lost a prophet of God said they're virgins and he said they're going to go through the Great Tribulation but they God for the grace of Protoss in a resurrection of rapture a man that brings the red of Revelation of the resurrection that brings the revelation of the rapture to the end time right to created us the expectation so that we're living daily expecting the resurrection specking the rapture amen now focus in on this and we're expecting this rich making that no no expecting the resurrection arrives there's nothing else left to put the emphasis on a man there's nothing out there worth putting the emphasis on we're bright and this is Saints please don't get mixed up God God has got those who dare to go through this ministry that ministry that ministry but then God has got a bride just focusing on the resurrection rapture Amy how are we bright well what I got to do this I got a dad you better be led by the spirit when it comes to your witnessing a man the god water you wouldn't want you to witness to this one or that one you'd leave that with the Lord amen brother the greatest witness that you could give he's your life that's right brother you gotta you gotta live and live what kind of a life are you gonna live and not a religious life it's gonna be more than it going to go beyond that it's gonna be a Holy Ghost right with Holy Ghost expectation well what are you looking for what are you living for we're living for the resurrection rapture a man it's not going line like Luther going out there and preaching just justification or Wesley's sanctification all we all yet separated unto the Lord and we're sanctified and and because of their faith God manifested justification in Luther because of their faith God manifested sanctification in Wesley and the methods and the old fashioned Salvation Army amen as their faith they thought they had to do this they thought they had to do that amen and we're just they're just their works but when they come to realize it was faith like I said when I struck John Wesley it went from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet hey man the anointing and he went forth sanctified even for John survive but he went forth sanctified he knew then I didn't have to do this I didn't have to do that no no they thought they had to get up a certain hour in the morning they had to pray to three hours and then they had to go and do this they had to go into that no it's been discovered they didn't have to do that because Jesus sanctified him hey man Jesus just so he did it all amen praise the name of the Lord and even even new when it comes to the resurrection arrives for now brother the resurrection we need is in Jesus Amen the rapture we needs in Jesus that's why we got to give him the preeminence in our lives amen morning noon and night the preeminence is Christ when you get up in the morning as Christ its Christ through the day as Christ is the one that's covered controlling you he's there on that's leading you he's one that's controlling you hey babe your sons and daughters are gone and led by the Spirit of God and that's Christ in us amen he is our hope is our encouragement amen it is Jesus amen and brother no matter where you are no matter what you're doing you always give him preeminence by the grace of God amen and he is creating in us through the men men men messenger in the measure of this hour he has created us the expectation the true expectation of the Resurrection the sure expectation of the rapture not the false amen no no it puts us on our toes look up because the resurrection rapture is here amen turn with me amen to Romans chapter 8 again I read their Scripture during the last man's fiction after the service our brother Holly came then remind me that I should have read on down little further he said in and get another verse there to confirm those that are in the spirit and in Romans chapter 8 the said in verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus amen yes thank the Lord but it says they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen so we're not living for the flesh we don't do what we got to do physically but where we want to put the emphasis on our spiritual walk with Jesus amen and it says who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death amen our deliverance is in Jesus praise the name of the Lord Alleluia as Jesus has seen as Jesus is saving us amen as Jesus has delivered us for the power of the devil amen giving us a true revelation of the expectation of the Holy Ghost for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death thank God for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh amen it's done it's like I said all when it comes to our sins they're all in the Sea of God's forgetfulness amen he's washed it all away amen by the grace of God and through what he did it's done oh I got a I need to God to forgive me for this sin I need God if it's done but you gotta accept it amen you will only experience the the holiness of the life of Christ by accepting what he's done a man and he'll sent forth confirming your faith you sent for the Holy Ghost into your life amen what is it it is the light of the blood of Jesus it is the life of the of the sacrifice a man remembering again in the Old Testament they sacrifice lambs but the blood of the Lamb couldn't come back to them amen they would just take the blood and put it all over the altar and so on but it was only a covering for sin hey man but Jesus is blood took away sin oh this is tremendous just think that in the eyes of man and in your own eyes you might know that you may not think you're so good you may not look so good and so on but in the eyes of God you're perfect amen no man can lay a charge against God's elect amen why because for the sacrifice and then the lame was made before the foundation of the world amen praise the name of the Lord old brother and through the sacrifice your sins were washed away from the foundation of the world amen true that sure the sacrifice brother your sins are gone from the foundation of the world in the sea of forgetfulness hey man but through the through the experience that you had in the end of the age you you living a man your experience with Jesus he takes away the desire for seeing a man because we were born in sin we were born with the desire for sin but in the new birth he takes way to desire for it but the enemy is there to trip you the aim is there to cause you to stumble that's but each there to if we sin we have an advocate with the father and we said we've got a mercy seat praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and the Holy Ghost is there to convict you and you repent and really restores to fellowship with God again amen thank God brother he knew what we're going to experience in this world he knew our gonna experience it need these bodies of flesh amen that's why he promised a glorified body you had the quicken spiritually you as he rapture spiritually and we're believing to be quicken and raptures physically by the grace of God that is our expectation brothers for the experience in our soul it creates an expectation for the change in the body amen by the grace of God we're born again in our souls we're going to be born again physically by the Word of God a man we're going to cut off in resurrection and rapture in faith and brother that's where the bride is constantly expecting the change because we need it raw we need to get out of this whole world we need to get out of this whole flesh Laura where the enemy is constantly focusing on the on the senses of the flesh focusing on this focusing on that Lord Lord we need to get out of this and into a body Lord where all these things are gone amen a perfect body we're in dwelleth righteousness amen and that the enemy can't tempt you to sin no more boy because you're you're going from the senses of the flesh to absolutely perfect faith amen your sake I thought I've been thinking about it Lord I said what's it gonna be like when we get into the kingdom of God well I'm not oh my lord I said there be none of this foolishness out there there be none of this insanity amen the absolute holiness perfect world perfect thoughts no no nay nothing negative have you thought about it I have because I'm Oh cuz we want it we want to get out of this because the enemy she uses all this stuff to try to get us to doubt God try to get us to doubt the word any man but we're going to the kingdom of God brother God is trying to show us the revelation of what it's like so it's creating us a hunger and a thirst for it I don't know about you buddy what you're seeing out there I'll tell you I trust this creating a nicer greater and greater and greater hunger to get out of here yes the work the more get the worse it gets the greater the hunger the bride's gonna have oh yes by the grace of God god help us brother what is your expectation today well I'm expecting this I gotta do this I gotta do that no no no you just do that as it has to come to cross your path whatever it is but what gives what gets more important in your life it's a spiritual is the kingdom of God for the world the people of the world these kingdoms are more important and more what are more real to them than the kingdom of God but for us we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've been born again and we got a net we got the nature of the kingdom of God and that's why we're hungry on thirsting for that's why we're never satisfied in this world that's why as the Bible says that we feel like Pilgrims and strangers yeah yeah ordinarily our brother varlyn and and our brother Joshua here maybe would feel like a stranger and Newfoundland but they don't feel like strangers no more no in fact even even this Muslim couple it here in Mount Pearl that what do they do they come from Pakistan somewhere and what what I dunno oh they're loving it here they got their family here now they've started a restaurant here what not here that long no but they could they they're here long enough and they start a restaurant and and and and they love making the food they love serving the the people coming in for a meal oh yeah they're not a pilgrim they're not a stranger no no now they're dirt and other Newfoundlanders they feel like it amen but you and I were born again hey man there's a many of those people are there they tape dating on the nature of Newfoundland or whatever well we got the nature of heaven true the baptism of the Holy Ghost we got the nature of heaven hey man so we're pilgrims and strangers regardless of the country marine oh yeah we might feel at home even if we went to India or Africa like our brother George Smith in Africa or whatever but but again we know that we're a pilgrim in a stranger whether we're here Africa India no matter where we are yeah there's brothers and sisters today in those countries and brother they're hungry and thirsty for the kingdom of God amen and they got an expectation for the resurrection and the rapture amen oh yeah I know there's not going to be many going into rapture but I don't know if there's one of me many countries left out it might provide a few here and a few there and a few somewhere else this makes sure your your your numbered with well there's gonna be people from India raptured people from Africa raptured yeah but there might be a new friend not not coming out of Africa coming out new flag if the power of God narrowed it down to 500 oh that God must be must be gathering to praise the Lord yes hey man God is going to get gathering them together here for a reason praise the Lord never thought about that before thank you lord oh yeah gotta get to get them together and then take them home gotta bring them from this country from this country to this country to that one yeah yeah and the other they'll all get together oh yeah at the prophet of God I lights a boat of being one body together expecting the resurrection and the rapture amazing yes hallelujah brother maybe despite the brother brother brother facial amen before the rapture oh and then II and maybe you're taking one of the new Flanders somewhere else yeah to get together with that that group that's somebody else with a group amen oh brother it's God's Way not our way oh I think this is wonderful hey man now we know why if there's only a few but they're gonna be of all cultures yeah by the grace of God amen amen thank you lord Alleluia amen thank God for that revelation of why our brothers brothers and sisters are here a man from India from Africa from any other country oh yeah some of you sisters from the United States got it to get you at it out of out of the states why because God's gonna destroy the United States he said that and how tired of this question I pray grace if there's any believers in California did they'll get out any man by the grace of God follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost don't do what your mind tells you to do brother again that's a false expectation but you got a true expectation you're gonna follow the leadership of God amen what does God want you to do where does God want you to go Amy well this we're on the rock yeah I don't I don't believe they they use that for it without a reasonable they could they referred they knew from that has been known for years to be the rock amen symbolizing the rock of ages' amen by the grace of God oh this is tremendous god of her blushes amen brother I pray God through the preaching of the word that God is creating enough expectation to get out of here God is creating us the expectation for the resurrection the expectation for the rapture because brother it can't go on much longer hey man grace to us you gain enrollments bursaries for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit see how important it is to walk in the spirit live in the spirit a man does not go by the letter of the word let's not go by the mechanics of the word by dieded by the dynamics a man by the grace of God as the prophet of God said if you're walking by the mechanic and dynamics of the word he said it would just take a man a woman a boy or a girl he said just lift up their hands and say Lord were coming home and he said Oh trigger the rapture what kind of faith would they have to have to say Lord I'm coming home oh my god or not defeat what is the mission this is tremendous do not focus you know what's going on it there then I concentrate on what's going on in California in that country and what's going on somewhere else no no no what something struck them the rapture what what do you mean oh the rapture is coming on what yes I feel the pole you feel the pole yeah praise the Lord hallelu and he by the prophet or Garcia teach you to look up and say oh I'm coming up Lord and his triggers the rapture and he starts and there go and he said what is it what's wrong now he said the trouble now in this hour he said they're putting too much emphasis on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics amen they're putting so much emphasis on yeah and the messenger yes and even the Macan the message what about the dynamics of the message anyway that is ordained and predestinated to creating us a true expectation of the revealed word for this hour and brother we got nothing else to look for only the resurrection and the rapture for the bride there's nothing else left grace to us he said in verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh and a lot of believers were caught up not with the rapture not with the spirit they're caught up with the natural things - fleshly things of this world they love it they're focusing on the natural the natural the natural I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this I oh yeah I'm going to get this job and I'll get this much money and so on the content with such things as you have not many like that no no they come up with this world and the things of this world yes they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh oh yeah your focus is not fleshly things natural things you want this you want that you want this oh yeah and after the rapture they were still here focusing on it till something happens and they realize they missed the rapture and it says they did they do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit and what is the things of the Spirit it's the word the Spirit focuses on the word amen for to be carnally minded or physically minded yeah - they currently mind are physically minded is death that's right but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen it's eternal life and it says because the carnal mind is enmity against God God wants you to have a spiritual mind so God can speak to you God can talk to you God can reveal his word to you God can create in you the faith he wants the expectation he wants a man short of ink the carnal mind is enmity against God does make sure you got a spiritual line a Holy Ghost mine not a karma any for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God God helps that will be in the spirit but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you now then he may have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of these now brother we better make sure we got the Holy Ghost okay if you don't have the Spirit of Christ in you the life of his blood you're none of his God have mercy on us and in Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness amen see the importance make your calling and election sure that you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost creating it yeah that's true expectation if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh he shall die but if each for the spirit to mortify or kill the deeds of the body ye shall live brother that's what we need to do is to kill the influence of the physical nature in this body a man and give preeminence to the spiritual nature the Holy Ghost nature amen by the grace of God amen oh my you don't have to turn I'll read it if you want to send Philippians 1 in Philippians 1 Paul was encouraging the believers to rejoice in spite of suffering regardless of what you go through praise the Lord if you do it for the Gospels sake give God the glory he said I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that she may approve things that are excellent that she may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ this is being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God but I would ye should understand brethren that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather on to the furtherance of the gospel amen so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places amen and many of the Brethren in the Lord woxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear brother sister what about the life you're living well your testimony continued that your Christian amen what what do other people see in you what does others think about you amen do they do they see the reflection of the Holy Ghost in you or to them it would not be the Holy Ghost or to them but just over there they're religious people they're they're good they got a good nature and so on they got a good attitude what do they see in you amen I trust we got Christ in you if you got Christ in you what they're gonna see they're gonna see a positive spirit a positive attitude most definitely and it's a even even those that you work with or you go to school with they'll know that it's Christ in you they know that you're different oh yeah it's like you know even when I went to school they knew and they are always on their guard where they were they were around me yeah be careful they're careful what they were saying how they was saying and so on oh yeah under guard oh I've noticed that when I was going to school oh yes definitely and like I said - what was it the teacher was seen for him to say you're you're gonna be a pastor why I said Lord why did he think that yeah just I guess they just they just knew I was Christian and so on and that I didn't get involved with this I didn't get involved with that and so on and there's time when the other students would come and they're going to do things tasted Earl we know that you're not involved in too many things but we want you to do this we want you to do that and of course like I said when they closed before they closed the school in the last graduation if they had they called they called me up to pray I was shocked yeah it was the final graduation ceremony they had in that school and the cook school closed in 1995 you know and they said what we're going to ask one of our students former students to come up and and close in prayer yeah and like I said I Perry I prayed for the students I prayed for this for those that were there and there was one person there that was sick I prayed for her a teachers wife God healed her yeah God healing because like I said not long after that or maybe a few years that no one wasn't many and we were delivering those flyers and I went to this house and this won't open the door or a man open the door and she's Oh Maisie and he says well thank you he said you prayed for so-and-so and he said he said the lord of euler he said she's doing good oh I said well praise the Lord I said we'll give God to God be the glory he said well thank you he said brother thank you amen yeah that was in the Adventist school yeah so to God be the glory praise the name of the Lord brother go forth be instant in season out of season you know always there to pray for somebody always there to encourage somebody spiritually not naturally if you got the Holy Ghost you won't think natural thoughts you would think spiritual if you got the Holy Ghost oh yeah if you don't you still think carnally physically naturally all do this do that what what what the rest of what they would do but as a Christian your attitude to be different oh yeah and knowing that there's there's people out there that would recognize that don't know you're different and they'll stop and think oh mighty Christian now some of you might be fanatical but that's alright they consider Jesus a fanatic amen but to God be the glory in your life amen if you got the Holy Ghost you're walking in the spirit and living in the spirit everything you do is spiritual by the grace of God amen he said that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all places and in all you know in all the palace and in all of their places and many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear praise the Lord some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strength and some also a good will the one preach Christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that I am said for the defense of the gospel not while then he said notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached and I therein do rejoice yay and will rejoice Amen that Christ is preached he said I know this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for me to live is Christ and to die is gain I trust you had the testimony that Paul had for you to live is Christ and to die is gain amen we are bear with me for a few moments here I don't have the time to go into all the notes but brother sister what God has done in this hour he's done to create in us a true expectation for the resurrection in the rapture there's not we caught up with a false expectation but the true revelation of the real resurrection and the real rapture when it comes to expectations the public God preached expectations 17 times from 1950 to 1961 just over it was 11 years and he preached 17 sermons on the title of expectations Noah was expecting the flood of water to cover all the earth and his works reflected his expectations he built an ark what was he expecting he was expecting a flood a man a God told him he believed God and he went out and he manifested the faith he did when Milner and he drilled it exactly the way that God want to build you do it the way God wants you to do it so Noah was expecting the flood what are you expecting in every age God has given his sons and daughters expectation something to look for something to press onto Abraham was expecting to have a son by Sarah even though she was barren and unfruitful for many years and even when they got to the age where it seemed impossible of all for him and her he still believed he was going to have a son by Sarah a man his words his deeds his attitude and spirit reflected is expectation and so brother our words and deeds and attitude of spirit reflect our expectation what expected if you're expecting the rapture you're going to reflect it Moses was expecting God through his ministry to take control of the Egypt and bring Israel out of Egypt to go into the Promised Land his works reflected is expectation probably God brings these things out your works prove your expectation yeah what you're expecting it's not just saying I believe it and go on no no you got to go and do what that faith requires amen if Noah had the faith there's gonna be a gonna be a flood well Lord how are we going to escape well he said oh just for you and your family I want you to build an ark what build an ark Lord if I go building an ark on dry land they'll think I'm crazy but he didn't he didn't he didn't consider those things he considered God he considered the word a man brother you don't consider the foolishness of the world and what the world's gonna think about you know you're not worried about that what does God think about you yeah so brother Noah's works Abraham's works and Moses works reflected what they were expecting God to do and to them it was positive hey man not maybe they were positive and David expected victory over the lion David expected victory over the bear and David positively expected victory over Goliath the giant a van he was the smallest amen yeah but God gave him a victory over a bear over a lion and then when he can't listen when he came to - to - the Jews they're at war and they were all you know move back away from the enemy he said what's going on what you want go down and fight the giant just think just just a small boy if you won't go down afraid the joint why not oh they they fought him and it's your hit - to the Jews he was fully she was you know he there's something wrong with him to the world that people a think there's something wrong with us because of the way we live and what we think and act and talk you know what David said okay I'll go down what oh they really thought it was something wrong with him Oh Oh your majesty he just a shepherd he just looks after my father's sheep you know he can't do that but he could he wasn't him it was God and you know he said God delivered me for the bear God deliver me from the lion yeah but that was a bear that was a lion but this is a giant and he had a tremendous sword and all of these things and it caused the Jews to be negative they didn't want to do this didn't want to do that no he saw him and the King said all right you can have my sword you can have my shield this and that he took it not goodness I can't use this what you think they were took the Kings advice no he wouldn't take it no I said he just had a slingshot a slingshot and he had no storms so what did you he saw I'll go get it and he knew calvess come to deliver the giant into his hands he knew it he wasn't going down where he fear he never no fear no brother I pray God the Holy Ghost takes the fear away from you by the grace of God fear you people are afraid of this and afraid of that Freight or something else but where's our faith in God who's in control brother I tell you I pray gray said that the god is in control not the devil of your life and your thoughts a man of your expectations and Brett and David brother he didn't even go down expecting or maybe maybe you II I will get killed maybe this will that no no no he knew when he went down he was going to get the victory hey man he had that faith well God did this and God did that not only that and you know what he identified the giant you know what they did the identification that he had and that that increased his faith and encouraged his pain exactly a man he said you he said you're afraid of this uncircumcised Philistine whereas why what did on circumcision record represent the Covenant that God had with Israel and wherein God promised this and God promised that a man and true circumcision they are they came under the government by the grace of God a man and J and and David went down well he was circumcised he was in the Covenant God was gonna be with him God was gonna bless him God would do this God would do that God's gonna deliver that uncircumcised philistine he's not a believer into my hands hey man and he went down to the water and he picked up five stones grace grace picked up five stones he only needed one but if I testified of the grace of God in David's life and I'll tell you the giant thought he was crazy the giant thought that David was crazy the giant thought David was insane you think you're gonna kill me he said I'm gonna I'm gonna kill you sit with this sword David was gonna cut his head off not many Jews believed it I guess they're all they're thinking oh we let's go down and get David's body after a while I watched what they were thinking no they've had down to get Goliath's body amen brother I tell you God help us to have the faith that David had a man David was fully completely expecting to kill Goliath he was fully expecting to use Goliath's sword amen brother I pray grace that we have that expectation by the grace of God brothers for David was a David expected victory over the lion the bear and any expected victory over the Giant to him in the eyes of God the Giant was no more than the bear no more than the lion a man and it wasn't David it was God amen I pray grace that we have that revelation of God in our hearts we are more than conquerors through our Lord Jesus Christ amen brother John the Baptist was completely expecting to see the Messiah and introduced him to Israel and seeing Jesus coming to be baptized John cried out behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world what was John expecting a man he was expecting the Messiah in flesh and he believed he was the Messiah he didn't wait to see what Jesus would do it revealed to John a man he was ordained to forerun the first coming of the Lord the prophet of God in this hour was ordained to forerun the second coming a man and to turn our hearts back by the grace of God God Elvis and it says Simon the Prophet was fully expecting to see the Messiah before he was taken off the earth he was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost he fully recognized the Messiah in the arms of Mary when she brought him to the synagogue to be circumcised oh yeah now what kind of anointing was on him what was his life for him to be there in the temple for so many years and he's over 80 years old and then he sees a number of women coming in with their children their boys yeah babies and then then this woman comes in there Mary she would have baby in her arms and the spirit led him to her yeah he took that baby and he prophesied it was the Messiah he said now Lord he said let your servant depart in peace oh my brother's sister what was the expecting what he was expecting he recognized oh this is him here because God told him by the Holy Ghost that he wouldn't see death till he had he had blessed the Messiah amen how many children did he did he bless how many children did he see over the years until finally this one comes Mary comes in with this one oh the Lord revealed to him now he said Lord let your servant depart in peace are we expecting God to move in our hearts in our souls in our lives like he moved in Simon's Lane brother sister god help us it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost and he fully recognized a messiah in the arms of Mary when she brought him to the synagogue to be circumcised the disciples in the upper room continued with one of one another in prayer and supplications expecting the power and the anointing of the Holy Ghost as jesus promised them their expectation was fulfilled on the day of pentecost amen grace in the bible we have many examples of faithful expectations revealed and brought to pass in the lives of the sons and daughters of god what they expected they received a man and what the Lord has done in this age has revealed the mystery of God to give us the expectation of the climax of the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of God amen so are we expecting the resurrection and rapture as Noah was expecting the flood are we expecting the resurrection and rapture as Abram was expecting his promised son as Moses was the victory of bringing Israel out of Egypt do we have that expectation the last message that the Prophet preached on expectation was in 1961 in Virginia and he said I wish he said to read from Saint Luke the second chapter and Bo there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same was just a devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him we need the Holy Ghost on us and it was revealed on to him by the Holy Ghost that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ now is it for a text to build the context expectations such meetings isa draws expectations and he said there's always three classes of people and he said the unbeliever the make believer and the it just attracts those attentions it's always has been but expectancy and he said that's a great thing to expect something and he should usually get what you expect a man and he said by those who are expected to get something God will give them their expectations and if they're doing it reverently and in the fear of God any man now he should always to find out something first is to find out whether it's the will of God or not then you can sincerely in your heart expect it and he said and many said in all ages when they have heard the voice of God speaking to them and he said they haven't seen the supernatural and they had they have expected and live their life expecting this to happen and brother/sister because they lived their life expecting it it never did fail and he said Abraham he said expected the baby even down til 25 years after it was promised him he was still expecting it and he believed God yes amen he believed God how many believers really believe God oh we believe God sent a prophet yes but Prabhas gone where's your faith now amen I wrote the message it's not many got faith in the message or the faith of the message no no God had mercy on us he said it makes you act funny when you really take God at His Word and when you're acting like you expected amen are we acting and living like we expect God to fulfill the scripture the resurrection the rapture he said old church he said we ought to be expecting to see God do something ought to expect to see a shaking amongst the people certainly it's promised to us we believe it you believe with me it will put our hearts together a man and believe something is going to happen but we got to put our hearts together we got to have the same expectation that you're here because you're looking for the resurrection and rapture in faith amen you're coming to church to hear the word to increase our faith in the resurrection in the rapture taught at mercy he said it's got to happen he said if you're expecting it and your expectation is according to your faith it's got to happen and he said certainly amen and he goes on to talk about Simon again and what Simon saw but God had revealed to him he said the Holy Ghost told me the Holy Ghost reveal it to me that I wasn't going to see death until I seen the Lord's Christ I believe it he said that's all I believe it amen so we do we believe considering what the Providence said about the rapture and the resurrection in this hour by the grace of God amen trusts were not currently minded physically minded but we are spiritually minded caught up with the spirit Holy Ghost life of Christ in us the dynamics of the word are we not thirsting for the resurrection and the rapture God have mercy on us listen brother the fontain brought out this this tremendous he said we are not as good if we're I wonder who took notes for brother la Fontaine did you close this in your notes our brother brought out the revelation he said we are not dating Jesus he said we're married to Jesus amen oh I thought that was tremendous Oh Lord praise the Lord I said take it to our heart short any man he said we're not dating Jesus but married to Jesus expecting him to be sharing his eternal resurrection and rapturing life with us by the grace of God amen so are we dating Jesus for married to down to the age down through the years down through the ages we were dating Jesus but now we're married to him amen by the grace of God turn with me to first Corinthians 15 we're finished with these scriptures first Corinthians chapter 15 and in verse 51 the old I showed you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen o referring to our black brothers and clears brother John he was behind the computers a van but again maybe he's pried the bride that God brought to unite with us amen as well as our brother Joshua here and brother Daschle amen to God be the glory just to encourage them you're not here without a reason oh no definitely not it's ordained of God predestinated a man so be old I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality amen and go to Peter 2nd Peter chapter 1 amen and in second Peter 1 and verse 2 grace and peace be multiplied on to use for the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power is given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these she might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence a man how are we giving all diligence to our faith it says add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness a man and a godliness brotherly kindness a rather yet and to brotherly kindness charity for these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen but you got to add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness going from the first church age right up to the last church age that God brings the crown of divine law of death amen if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God give us a greater and greater and greater revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ and what he did in our Lord Jesus Christ but either lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if he do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but what God requires is diligence a man diligent be diligent in your faith be diligent in your expectation a man totally on your guard expecting the rapture to take place at any time expecting the resurrection at any time are we so diligent and I'm so on our guard when it comes to our expectation by the grace of God will we recognize the dead in
