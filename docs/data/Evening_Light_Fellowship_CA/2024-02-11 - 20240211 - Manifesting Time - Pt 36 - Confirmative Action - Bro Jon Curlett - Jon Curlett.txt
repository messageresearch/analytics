that your word would be born Lord and not just be born but it would live Lord it would Thrive it would grow it would mature us into Sons and Daughters of adopted Lord that are adopted into your into your kingdom into your will and into your purpose Heavenly Father Lord we know that takes surrender we know that takes a dying out Lord we needs know it takes a a laying aside of these things that we hold on to so many times but Lord we're here this morning to die out a little more that you could live a little more in our lives and in our beings in our families Lord in this little church in this community Lord that we would be lights in this in this place Lord that we would be salty to those that are around us Lord that we'd have an effect with eternal purpose Lord I pray your grace this morning Lord you set the tone Lord the atmosphere of this song service Lord just pray that your word would Minister now that it would encourage us to come up a little higher Lord God Lord that we would take you at your word that we would trust the process Lord that we would see our place and what you're trying to do in our lives each one Lord grant us Grace each one now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 14 John chapter 14 it's good to be back amen we certainly had a wonderful vacation and went out and and went to Corner Brook and we're able to spend two days skiing there and the weather was perfect every day we had Sun we had warmth we had no wind so we just thank the Lord for that and then we decided to bring it back with us so that you could enjoy it as well but uh we certainly appreciate the graciousness of the church that we were able to go away appreciate brother Paul spending time you know seems like nothing to maybe take a service but then he's got to do Sunday school today and then he's got youth group this afternoon so he's been a busy man so I certainly appreciate him taking that amen want to bring greetings from Brother Doug and sister Beverly gaale we got to meet them on Friday for supper and then they they made us breakfast on our way out on on Friday morning or sorry we met them on Tuesday night for supper and then on our way back Friday morning they said please stop by we'll feed you we'll make breakfast don't worry about it so we did and they gave us a wonderful breakfast there so just passing on greetings from them anden we want to certainly take the time to fellowship with them any time we can man it's good to see brother Josh back amen we missed you brother and then we've got brother Ellie God bless you sister Elise as well God bless you it's good to see you all here this morning amen certainly appreciate it when people come in and they'll they'll put their shoulder to the wheel and add their their lick of fire to the ones that we have here amen amen it's good to be home brother Bob that was a good song service you set me up beautifully this morning for what the Lord's laid on my heart amen so John 14 and: 16 says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also and he says at that day you shall know that I am in the father and you in me and I in you now that's full restoration that's the full revealing of the word now that's the unity of the word that's the revealing of who God is God above us God With Us God in us that's the whole thing there but I want you to see now because in verse 21 he's going to give us a description of what this looks like see we can elevate it into some Grand theology some great mystery some great Doctrine but if you look in verse 21 he tells you what this looks like he says he that have my Commandments and keepeth him he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing on our series on manifesting time and we're just getting into the the meat of things as we move into this this topic of of adoption I want to take a a single thought as a continuation of our last service and I was driving home on Sunday and this thing just dropped into my mind and I quickly put it in an email to myself so I wouldn't forget it and so I want to take a title this morning of confirmative action now we see today that they have this thing called affirmative action and I know all about this my wife is Hispanic and in the states they have this thing called affirmative action where if you're of a certain race a certain ethnicity a certain background then they give you opportunity based on what you are rather than or who you are rather than what you are in other words they don't give you a scholarship or they don't give you an opportunity because you're the best for that but they give you the opportunity because of how you look or your background or your ethnicity of these things amen so you're given an opportunity regardless of your qualifications or with Le less emphasis on your qualifications but that's not the way God works and so I want to take a bit of a play on words this morning and call this confirmative action and the thought that came to me as I was driving home because we've been been focused on adoption and the thought that came to me is this that adoption is all about conduct it's all about how you act it is the only thing that God's looking at by the time we come to adoption because what you have to have is you have to take what's in your mind you have to take what's in your heart and it has to now be lived in your life and that's what I mean by conduct doesn't mean it's the only thing but in adoption what the father's looking at is how you act how everything you are comes out into your day-to-day life that's what he's concerned with because when you act the way you feel when you act the way you believe when you act according to the word that's inside of you that's when he knows that you're finished work that's when he knows that you're ready for a time of responsibility so when we start talking about conduct people can get real uptight sometimes times because we can get into legalism and how you dress and how you do this and how you do that we're not talking about that this morning we're just talking about the general conduct of a son and we open with John 14 I love John 14 there's so much there there's godhead in there there's predestination there's our purpose on Earth there's the guarantee of the word for the True Believer and all these different things but more than anything it shows us the relationship between the children of God and God himself it shows us our position it shows us our place it shows us his expectations for us and we see here in John 14 it's the key to an overcoming life the key to the overcoming life is the Holy Spirit and without the Holy Spirit we're just Pretenders that that's just where we end up isn't it because when before the Holy Ghost we're believing unto something and here's the thing unless you get it you'll always believing unto and you'll never get it amen you'll never come to a place of uh of overcoming life and we're destined to be miserable because you're always believing for more than you have now here's the thing in a way we're always believing for more than we have because I'm believing for a res resurrection and a Rapture amen I don't have it yet but yet I have the earnest of the resurrection and that's a great comfort to me and it's leading me and it's growing me and it's maturing me and it's maturing all of us into a place where we're going to take a resurrection and a Rapture but Paul knew all about the miserableness of not having the Holy Ghost and he talks about it in Romans 7 and he came to an understanding you'll see if you go through Romans 7 Paul thought he lived when he was Saul he thought he lived a perfect life by the law and then when he saw that he couldn't actually meet the requirement of the law it put him in into depression it put him into miserableness it made him wretched because he realized that the thing that he thought had saved him was the thing that condemned him and he got to a place where he recognized that there was this battle inside of him that he couldn't he couldn't win and in Romans 7 and 21 we find Paul says I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me now I don't know about you but that goes for me every single day anytime you want to do something right Satan's there to try and what inspire your carnality Inspire your flesh to rise up and refuse to do what the word tells us to do when you want to do the right thing then guess what Satan will put a thought in you to go do the thing that keeps you from doing the right thing it may not be wrong what he's telling you to do but if it holds you back from doing the right thing then that's sin remember script the scripture says that if you know to do good and do a not then that is sin to us and sometimes that's what Satan's trying to do not so much get us to do a bad thing but not get us to do the right thing amen God wants us to do his will amen but then he says for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man amen our desires are to do the right thing can we say that this morning I desire to do the right thing to live right to think right to act right all these different things but Paul says but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin and my members Paul says everything inside of me wants to do right but yet this flesh Rises up and I keep losing the battle Paul was frustrated because he says every time I try and do the right thing this flesh Rises up and it ends up condemning me it ends up getting in my way he says it's bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members that tells me that my members are there's no good thing in them as Paul said there's nothing in here that I can rely on to take me into the will of God there's got to be something else that happens in my life and he says oh Wretched Man that I am this is what we're talking about without the Holy Ghost you're wretched because you know there's a higher place you know there's a higher place of living but you can't do it he says who shall deliver me from the body of this death see there's this place between realizing that you want to do right and you're unable to do right and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that stretch there is miserableness because you want to do what you hear you want to do what you you have preached to you want to do what you read in the scripture but there's in your body no good thing to make it happen and so you need a nature change you need a heart change you need a spirit change change and then you need to be filled with the spirit to bring into production the word that God brings across your way amen so it's a place of wretchedness because you have a desire to do the right thing but you lack the will to do it amen and so you're stuck in the cycle of ups and downs and in and outs brother Brown would preach a message why are people so tossed about what is it they lack an anchor what is it the holy spirit inside of and every one of our Lives amen what is it we have this knowledge we have this understanding we have an open book this morning we have a message that's been given to us and we have so many things in there that tell us how a Believer ought to live and what's available to a believer in their life but do we have it all do we have it all we can be miserable if we never have it but the goal is to get it amen and it comes to a place where we realize that I have no ability in myself to produce the word of God to produce what he wants to do in my life but we're not stuck on being wretched amen this is a series about what it means to manifest the word of God it's for the Overcomer it's for the children of God that are born again by the spirit of God and that live by the power of God in their lives amen but there's nothing in me that can live an overcoming life I'm doomed I'm doomed I'm doomed there's nothing in me that can do it but Paul would say this in First Corinthians he says for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power you got the Amplified says for the kingdom of God consists of and is based not on what talk but on power amen Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you amen so that's what matters is what's within me first and foremost so what we have inside us is not based on what I say or what I think I have but it's got to be based on a power it's got to be R based on a reality of what's inside of me it's got to be God inside of me that makes this whole thing work then Paul will go into second Corinthians and says we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us amen I think the greatest Revelation that a a young Christian or a new Christian has is that there's no good thing in this there's nothing good in this that can produce the word there's nothing inside of us that is excellent compared to God he says we have it in Earth and vessels in other words we have it in flawed cracked failed vessels so that when something good comes out of it we can say that's got to be him cuz this thing can't do that it's not built for it it takes something greater than us to produce it then Peter would say blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy amen I'll take Mercy every single day Church according to His abundant Mercy had begotten us again he's born us again unto a lively hope a Living Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept how by the power by the power of God through what faith you've got to have faith but it's got to be his power he says unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time why am I saying this over and over again to help us to see that without the Holy Spirit we are doomed to fail we are doomed to fall we are doomed to wretchedness we're doomed to desperation we're doomed to all these things without the life in C inside of us we'll be just like the priesthood in Jesus day that's all we be remember Jesus said you're like Whited sepers you're like tombs and on the outside they're white and they're bright and they look beautiful you go to some of these cemeteries they have some amazing tombs there beautiful but he says inside you're just full of Dead Man's Bones it's rotness inside the outside looks good but the inside's no good he says therefore the whole thing is rotten because it's just a product of your imagination it's a product of your life it's not a product of a power inside of you it's a religious life and for some that's enough but for the child of God a religious Life Won't satisfy us listen to what brother Bram says he says his character has changed me amen remember last service we talked about the different things that that are in a child that's ready for adoption and one of them was character and that's really the starting point for it this morning he says his character has changed me that means that the character I'm looking for is his amen that the life I live has to be by the character of Christ in me he says when it came to me I was once a sinner and now I'm saved he says I once was lost now I'm f I once loved the things of the world I hate it now I once cared not for God but I love him now something happened to me something happened to you what is it it's God's work declaring his character in each and every one of us he loves us he's interested in your welfare you say brother John I'm just a little believer I'm just a little this and that I'm a little nothing we're all nothings but he says he cares about you he's interested in your welfare he's interested in your healing he's interested in your soul won't you let him have his way in your life don't doubt him for nothing you go believing him and God will give you the desire of your heart for it's his Good Will to do it he longs to do it but the thing of it is he says we get all frustrated stand still now obviously I'm not preaching against the when we talk of conduct this morning I'm not preaching against a a clean life but to the contrary but we're preaching about confirmative action and we see that there's more to just living by the law amen there's a life inside of us because you can live by the law but not want to do it and that is not what we're looking for brother Bram says when his character comes to me which is what the mind of Christ by the Holy Spirit he says I once was lost but now I'm found I once was lost but now I'm saved I used to like the world now I hate it I didn't used to care about him now I love him there has to be a work on the inside and it's the character it's the Life of Christ inside of us that draws us into willingly surrendering to his plan to his purpose to his ways of doing things amen this isn't legalism it's an outward expression of an inward work remember where we started in John 14 it says at that day you'll know me that I am in the father and you and me and I in you he says he says he that had my commandments so first he's got to give them to you you're only responsible for what God gives to you if he gives it to you you're responsible for it amen we're expected to live by what God shows us what you're hearing this morning God will hold you accountable for but if you're not here this morning then it doesn't matter God won't hold you accountable for it he'll hold you accountable for what you see and what you hear he says he that have my Commandments and here's the big thing and keepeth them we can sit here and say we've got a message we've got a message we've got a message what are we doing with it amen what's it doing in US is the big picture it's the big question he says he it is that loveth me Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments he says and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and I will manifest myself to him Jesus is saying I've told you what I expect I've taught you I've showed you I've given you an example and now I expect you to have a life that matches what I've told you amen we've got to we've got to see that the revealing the key to the revealing of God in each of us is not just that he gives us his word but that we keep his word that he gives us the giving is not the proof it's the keeping that's the proof right many heard him willingly but how many were there on the day of Pentecost Lots were there to get fed by the Loaves and the fishes but how many went up to the room in Pentecost how many turned their backs on them brother banam he had the sign in the hand and then he had the discernment and then he had these different things but under the opening of the word everybody bailed on him what they had the word but they couldn't keep the word there was nothing in them to hold them to it amen our lives are proof for God the father's looking for how we act not just how we speak if I can put it that way if our lives don't match our confession then there's something wrong there's a disconnect somewhere and we've got to grow up we've got to come into a greater maturity amen the holy spirit's here to bring what's in our heart out of our Lives that's what he's trying to do is take it from here and bring it out so people can see it listen I can say all day long I love broccoli and you'll all know I'm lying why because I don't eat it it's that simple we can say we love God but if I never eat it we can say we love his word but if we never eat it we can say we love the preaching of the word but if we're never in church what does that tell us we don't love it because we're not eating it we're not doing it brother Braham says if you believed it you do it so if you believe it then you'll what you'll take action on what you're hearing Jesus is saying you love say he says saying you love my word is not enough you got to do it you got to take it and you got to put it into your life remember he told that parable of the two boys and the father says go work work in my Vineyard and one says no and one says yes but the one says yes I'll do it didn't go do it and the one that says no I won't went and did it and Jesus said which one loved his father the Saucy one that refused but then went and did it he said because in the end he did the will of the father he was rebellious to start but he surrendered to the will of the Father the other one said yes I'll do it he had a great thing coming out of his mouth but his heart wasn't in it and he didn't go do what the father said but we're considering this thought that adoption is all about conduct and when we opened up in John 14 it shows us what God has for us but I want to take us back to to the Old Testament and we know the Old Testament is law it's not Grace but let's let's understand this that just because we're under grace doesn't give us license to sit at home on the couch and do nothing and sit here and say well I'm poor me I have this I'm that I have this sickness I have this failing I have this natural weakness I have this no no no Grace is here to cover those things while God does a work to take them out of our Lives amen we don't sit here with excuses that's disgrace the grace is here to cover us until we can come to the place that God wants us to be amen God's all about changing us that's what the Holy Ghost is his power to produce a son or a daughter of God but look at what they could do to a son this is Deuteronomy 21 church I'm so glad I don't live under the law I'm glad that his mercies are new Every Morning Deuteronomy 21 says if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have hasten him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out under the Elders of his City and under the Gate of his place and they'll say unto the Elders of this city our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he's a glutton and a drunker he won't listen he never listens there's nothing good in him can you imagine can you imagine maybe 21 22 years old and your parents drag you kicking and screaming to the gate of the city and their public confession is he's no good this is the law it says and all the men of his City shall Stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all Israel shall hear and fear that's what the law looks like you know sometimes we do that somebody messes up somebody does something what do we say they're no good there's no pattern of good works there waste of time waste of energy God doesn't waste his time on us and yet he come back to us time and time and time again when I fail when I mess up and he comes back and he keeps drawing me back that's why I love to be under grace but sometimes our actions don't reflect Grace the same way does it let's not be quick to put people out amen Saul was a persecutor of the church and his purpose was to be the prophet to the age amen God can turn anything around amen let's be careful of what we do but they bring that son in front of the elders and they'd say his conduct does not reflect our expectations we've done everything we've done we can we put everything we can we've had patience we've tried and we've tried and we've taught and we've taught and we've taken them to counseling we've taken them to the priest and we've spoken to the ministry and we've laid hands on him and we've done everything and nothing has changed he's a drunkard and a glutton and they killed him there and why did they do that so that the next in line could step in to the position of authority in the family because you put a drunkard and a glutton in in authority and what will he do he'll do everything selfish it's all about him he won't do anything for anybody else he's inwardly focused and that would destroy the family so for the sake of the family and for the sake sake of the tribe they kill that boy so that the next one in line could take the position in in terms of the The Inheritance now we're talking about conduct this morning and I want you to understand the first thing is that conduct reflects character amen you can't say I've got character that's good and then your life is bad it doesn't work that way the way you act and the way you live shows what your character is remember character is an inner work amen it's the real you it's your real thoughts it's your real desires it's the it's the tress inside of you and we can hide it and we can put up a facade or around it but in the end what happens is our conduct is the outer expression of our inner character conduct proves character amen it's your inner person being expressed on the outward side of things listen to what brother Bram says he says notice when the child was born he was a son that's relationship you're you're you're a son nothing changes that you're born to your father and your mother he says but his conduct had to do with his inheritance now inheritance is position son is relationship but inheritance is position he says now I want you to be real honest now don't you think we've tried to push the inheritance just a little bit further than our conduct went we're looking inwardly this morning this is a rubber meets the road sermon in other words he's saying don't you think we're trying to claim more than we've lived are we claiming we're in a certain position but our life doesn't really show we're in that position we want all the benefits we want all the authority we want all the recognition but our life doesn't quite queue up with where we're supposed to be he says that's what's the matter today we should be on way on up the road Yonder but we're B way back down here why he says it's been our conduct we have no respects respects for what the father's will the father's purpose the father's plan amen the full word amen we we we've got a nation we've got a world of selective hearers today don't we well what they want the scripture says they'll Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears that'll just tell us what we want to hear rather than what we need to hear Paul said I have not I have not uh shun to declare the full counsel of God to you selective hearers want what affirmation or encouragement only you're good where you're at rather than the correction of raising us up to a higher level amen no respects he says that's our problem it's been our conduct we have no respects he says when that son was born into the family he was a son at Birth but his inheritance was not yet determined it depended on his character so though being a son and if he was a disobedient son he would not inherit anything but still he was a son that's the grace of God and me that's predestination as though you may not come into adoption yet you'll never lose your relationship he says but if he was an obedient son he was heir to all things and we've been taught that when we're born again we're sons of God catch that when are we born again church not at baptism not at repentance when we get the Holy Ghost brother B says he's saying we've been taught that when we get the Holy Ghost we're sons of God he says that's true but that's just the beginning then he says it's your character from then on what makes the diff What means the difference so we can't claim to have the character in The Life of Christ if our life doesn't actually show these things amen this is what adoption is all about is when our lives match our confession our profession our expression amen whatever is coming out of our mouth matches up with what's in our lives amen when what we say we believe is what we live day by day when our decisions in every part of our Lives match what what the word says amen it's a day-to-day thing it's an everyday thing not just the church Sunday and Wednesday thing listen to what Jesus said this is after after he meets the woman at the well in Samaria and Jesus sath unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me into to finish his work the Amplified says Jesus said to them my food my nourishment is to do the will the pleasure of him who sent me and to accomplish and completely finish his work Jesus said my daily food is to do the will of God how often do we need food now we might make it away a day or two or three or four without food but really we need food every single day and Jesus said my food my nourishment is to do the will of my father you know what that tells me if that's our meat then that ought to be a day-to-day thing is that we wake up and we say God what is your plan and your purpose for me today I'll tell you church I've been changing the way I pray in the mornings it just feels like there's a focus there's a narrowness that's coming down and that narrowness is Lord what do you want me to do today don't let me just bumble around Amen to recognize that I'm a Son of God to recognize that you're Sons and Daughters of God and that you have a purpose to be here and it's not just to make a living it's not just to go to work it's not just to go to school it's not just to raise your kids but it is to be the embodiment of the word that people can see and so be quick to grasp the opportunities you know I went last night and and someone from the homeschooling group uh the the the man's wife told blona that Jonathan and I could go play hockey and I honestly wasn't really wanting to play last night I was tired out and whatnot but I told my wife that and she said oh I think you should go and I said no I'm going to go why because I might get an opportunity to witness that's the reason I went was not to go play hockey the reason I went is because that's a group of professing Christians there that I might have a positive influence on that I might be able to witness to them of something that they haven't received yet that's the reason to do it and I find that's the way my prayer is this these days is say Lord what would you have me to do and help me to be quick to catch what's happening in the moment to be quick to speak to be quick to respond to have an answer for the hope that lies within us amen we're not just bumbling around this world where lights where cities on a Hilltop we ass salt that the people need amen every single day I've got to be seeking the will of God every single day you've got to be seeking the will of God Lord help me to reflect you today that's what we want to be we're getting so close church when the last one comes in we can get out of here amen I want the last one to come in so I can get out of here and if he can use me then let him use me let me not be bumbling around but let me be quick to hear what the spirit saying quick to understand what's happening in a situation that we can get the last ones in remember this ought to be a continual thing seeking the will of God remember the scripture says they that are as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that's a daily thing that's not just a a here a bit or there a bit but every day God's got a leadership for his children I believe and it's a character inside of us that seeks the will of God only that's what Jesus said I do only what the father shows me and he spent his time seeking the father's will that's how he spent his time he sought the will and then he did the will and then he went and sought the will and he did the will day in day out without any changing amen that's that charact that's where our character comes from is when I lay down who I am what I am what I think what I want and I say Lord what would you have me to do today Lord I'm reporting for Duty like good soldiers I'm reporting for Duty what would you have me to do today that's the character of Christ is to seek the will of God brother say this he says all scriptures dovetail together that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says let's watch the type of person he was let's look at his character and watch his ministry and as he worked then he works now okay catch that as he worked then he works now as he was then he is now and will be forever and just what he did in them days he'll do it today he'll be just the same forever he's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever the same type of character so that's what we ought to be we ought to be just like him that's what the adopted Sons and Daughters of God will look like and he confirms it he says a man that professes to be a Christian must have a Christlike nature if it isn't there's another nature there which isn't Christlike he says if I told you the spirit of Christ was in me I must act like Jesus you must act like Jesus your character and conduct must be bolded like that catch that your character and your conduct must be molded molding means you're not in your final condition you're not in your final shape we won't be till we go we're all a work in progress amen from the old to the young we're all a work in progress he said says your character and conduct must be molded like that he says and the Holy Spirit molds that conduct when he comes into you when you're really born again of the spirit of God and you'll see this time and time again throughout the message that brother BR would tie conduct and character together they're a match pair you can't divorce them you can't divorce your conduct from your character or other ways your conduct ultimately shows your character now you can live a religious life but what happens is when the squeeze comes when the pressure comes when the money starts to go out when your health starts to go when your relationships start to fall away when your church offends you when these different things happen what happens is that your real nature comes out and that's when you find out I've got it or I don't got it that's when God finds out God knows all along but that's the report card that he gets he failed that test she passed that test right it's when the rubber hits the road when things get Twi tight that's when character comes out day to day when everything's perfect money's in the bank Health's great church is great everything's great that doesn't take character doesn't take character to do that but now when things come and you got to make a decision and you got to choose between what your flesh wants and what the spirit of God wants that's when character shows that shows who's really in charge inside of us that shows what we really believe what we really want what we really think is in those times of testing brother BR would say oh if we are the sons and daughters of the king the king of kings let's conduct our care character as Christians that's right yes we are aliens we're pilgrims and we're strangers here this is not our world we're seeking a kingdom that is to come this is not our home and though we be tossed about and made fun of by the world and called this that and the other in old fashioned and all like that what do you care you don't want to be patterning yourself after some kind of a movie star or some television star or something you're a daughter of God you're a Son of God let's act like God we are the children of God we know and we are Sons and Daughters of the king let our character reflect what his presence no matter how rough it gets I was reading that last night and I just threw my hands up and I started to cry and I said Lord let my life reflect your presence let my life reflect the fact that I am a temple of the Living God and let that be what shines out of my life on a day-by-day basis amen I almost named this service the conduct of his presence it just jumped out of me so much we are the Temple of the Living God church and if it's there then what ought Our Lives to be on a daily basis on a moment by moment of basis amen the key to character is not just reading your Bible the key to character is not just praying the key to character is that his presence is in your life and that is overcome you remember we I'll get to it in a little bit character comes by what being in his Pres presence and his word being quickened to your life making it live that's what character is amen it's not enough anymore Church to say God you know my heart we're coming into adoption and that means what's in your heart has to come out into your life amen day-to-day Life by what we do by what we say how we spend our time the decisions we make the words we say all of these things it all feeds into that report card that God is Reading in our lives he'd say this back in the Old Testament when a father owned a big Kingdom and a child was born into that Kingdom he was a son as soon as he was born he would be air of all the father he would be heir of all the father had if his character was right he says but first his character had to be proved he says now you ministers know where I'm going to it's the placing of a son now notice he says he's got to have the right character and then the character's got to be proved so the first thing that happens is the character has to be put in and that's the desire that's the will but then what has to come in there is power to prove that character which is that you live what is really inside of you he says before we can be heir of all things before you can step into your position in the body of Christ your character has to be proved how by your conduct that's the proof of your character is your conduct the evidence that you've got character is your life how you live your life the decisions you make and all of these different things you can't divorce the two things your character and your conduct are exactly the same thing brother BR would say this that's your character your conduct so you can't sit here and say my life is a wreck but I've got good character it doesn't work that way I've got good character but my family's a mess no you don't I've got good character but I keep making the wrong decisions no you don't the conduct you live is the character you have doesn't mean you're not believing for more doesn't mean you don't want more but it hasn't solidified itself it hasn't anchored itself inside of us amen church this is rubber meets the road I'm sorry amen but this is where it's at is does our life remember we talked about does our life cope with our confession we talked about that last service the child was coming up and when he was young perhaps the duor would come to the father and we do with our kids so many times don't we well he's got a good heart and he's trying so hard and that's that's okay when they're young because there's a real molding that's happening there and they're coming into a new way of thinking and a new way of acting because remember we're all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world seeking lies we're all selfish it's just some of us are more selfish than others amen I look at my kids and I can definitely see that our youngest is the most selfish that we've ever had there's a lot more molding that's happening to him but there has to come a time where the tutor doesn't just say he has a good heart or she has a good heart but the father wants to know well how does she act I I I appreciate she's got a good heart but how is that translating into how she acts how's that translating into the decisions she makes how's that translating into his friendships how's that translating into how he spends his time what does his heart look like now in terms of his day-to-day life because the actions have to come into line with our professions amen the father has to come to a place where he trusts us to do the right thing not just know the right thing to do amen knowing to do the right thing is not the same as doing the right thing that's just knowledge and if you don't do it it'll it'll destroy you but to know to do it and to do it that's what the that's what the father's looking for and then that what's in the heart has to become the life and until we get to that point we're not going to come into adoption because our conduct has to be reflective of the nature of Christ inside of us not just the words that we can we can pair it out about what the word says about a situation let's live what the word says about the situation not just talk about it Jesus would say this this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their hearts far from me in other words what we say doesn't mean anything to God what we do matters to God that's our proof watch what brother Braham says he says and now when this duty of this teacher of raising the son was to bring the word to the father how he progressed he says and his conduct determined his inheritance now what's our portion there our conduct and what's God's portion inheritance he makes the decision to give us the inheritance when our conduct lines up with his expectations he says if he was a good son he would inherit all the father had if he wasn't a good son then he got nothing he wasn't worthy yet he was a son and just because now catch this church this is this is as we go into adoption later Services remember this just because you have received the Holy Spirit that doesn't mean that everything's just going to be poured into your hand in other words you don't get GI wrapped everything that God has for you remember that quote where brother Braham says he says he says everything you get you have to fight for he says just get the Holy Ghost once and you'll find that out you got to fight for every step that you take now remember brother Bram saying here receiving the Holy Spirit doesn't mean you get everything handed to you you know what that means the holy getting the Holy Spirit doesn't mean you're automatically in a position of adoption you you got to prove yourself amen character is a victory he said and a victory means there's got to be a battle and there's got to be an action and the action has to be the right action and that proves that you've got character amen there has to be an event that happens as we said before when the marriage drains away your or when your money drains away your health falters your marriage is struggling Works pushing God out your pastor Falls your church offends you whatever it is you've got to win the Victory and the Victory Is Over You not over the other one see that's the thing we forget character is about winning the battle Over Me Not Over You amen somebody offends me character is when I what win the battle over me not over them that's what we'll see in adoption is that so many people think adoption is outward facing adoption first is inward facing and the greatest thing we've got to defeat is ourselves that's the real victory that we've got to receive amen remember we read that quote where brother Bram said you've been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power see so often we think we're fighting demons and sicknesses and principalities and Powers we are but first we got to defeat ourselves first thing I've got to beats John klette and when he dies and he's defeated now that's somebody that God can use but that takes humility and it takes a real hard honest look in the mirror of the word to see where I'm at amen and we've got to be open to correction we've got to be open to change we've got to be open to coming to a higher level we've got to come to the place where it's on Christ the solid rock I stand not on me there's nothing in me that's going to do this so I don't believe that a person can just flat out say when I get the Holy Ghost I'm adopted because brother Bram just said when you get the new birth not everything's handed to you adoption is when you get the keys when you get Authority he says but you don't get that you got to be proofed first there's something that's got to happen because otherwise what do we do we'll presume and that's to venture without Authority and what happens is we fall flat on our face because we said something or we did something that wasn't the will of God and God can't back it up that's it it's that simple church this is I'm preaching it as straight as I can this morning because I don't want any excuses and I don't want any misunderstandings if we presume God won't back us up and you'll find the adopted son comes to the place where he captures the the vision and the plan of the father not himself and so the only thing that matters is what is God's will brother Brown would say this he says that's the reason the church he says that's the reason if the church would get quiet just a little bit what quiet mean listen instead of talking right sit still instead of running around and wait instead of getting up and leaving without an answer that's all he wants us to do if we're looking for his will I don't need to talk except to say Lord I'm here to find your will that's it and stay there until he gives it don't presume don't run around don't say I'm adopted son I'm adopted daughter I just need to no no no find his will and then speak the word remember what the what the what brother Brown would say he'd say she will have thus sayeth the Lord or she will stay silent amen that's a position of adoption hold to God's unchanging hand let him make the decision and then you walk in faith in what he tells you to do he says that's the reason if the church would just get quiet just a little bit and quit trying to say I'm assembly I'm a Oneness I'm a trinitarian I'm this I'm that and the other now you think that's outside of this message Church you're wrong we've got people saying today well you don't believe what my pastor preaches you don't preach it the way my pastor preaches you don't agree with my pastor you don't preach it this way brother you don't do it that way brother and what do we do we've got a bunch of denominations come on got a bunch of denominations rallying around men instead of what stepping back and realizing this is the body of Christ and if we can look at it through the Eternal way of God's looking we'd see that this is a body not a bunch of individual churches we're forgetting that we're all one we've been baptized into one body by one spirit and I don't care who your pastor is if you've got the Holy Ghost you're going to make it regardless of what another Pastor another preacher another brother another sister might say church we got to keep our eyes on him brother says your christs so in other words don't put other people in or out and don't put yourself in or out in that way don't identify yourself with a group don't identify yourself with a Doctrine don't identify yourself with an idea you're Christ you're bought with a price amen Look to Him He says you're Christ and the purchase of his blood he says you've got no right to break fellowship with people like that no right to break fellowship with people based on what they preach come on church I'm going to hit it because I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it people tearing apart churches because they can't give somebody Grace to grow the way God gave them Grace to grow and the way somebody else gave them the same Grace to grow half the time is just a misunderstanding anyways they believe the exact same thing but he says you've got no right to break fellowships with people unless they're living the wrong Life Church we can only live as high as God's raised us I can't make myself a greater Son of God than I am you can't make yourself anything greater we've got to live as God grows us my trust is that he'll get me where I need to be and he'll get you where you need to be he says we got no right to break fellowships with people like that unless they're living the wrong life draw any fences or barriers now people say well if they're off the word what then sometimes they just haven't come to the place you're at yet I I've been preaching for nine years I go talk to a minister that's been preaching for 40 guess what he's going to know and believe things I haven't even comprehended yet does that mean I'm out because I don't understand it the way he does no has nothing to do with it but we draw lines based on our ideas of what we ought to have right now and where we ought to be we can't do that he says we're all one in Christ Jesus for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body the body of Believers so character produces conduct and conduct reflects character brother Brown would say conduct is character that's it it's that simple your action speak louder than your words your life is proof of your character period end of story you can sit there and testify all day long about what you believe and what you know and what you have and what you don't have all I'm going to look at is your life that's that it's that simple and that's all that God's looking at God doesn't do a halfway job by giving us the truth and then not giving us the life behind it amen it's supposed to be a Living Word not just an intellectual word because if it's really in our heart it's got to come out into our life otherwise we'll get it wrong every time if it stays in our head that's what the priesthood had in Jesus day and they missed the word by A Thousand Miles they missed the Living Word and what they do he says you're of your father the devil that's where they ended up what was all this training for the the the father that tutor that had the son tutor what was all the checking up about what were all the report cards for so that the father could know when he could trust that son to step into a position of responsibility to put him into action to put him into work and know that he wouldn't Buckle under the load and he wouldn't presume to do things that he ought not to do that he wouldn't go out on his own idea his own Vision I was talking with a a brother a while ago and I and he said he said if I get a new minister in my church he says I don't let him preach for 12 months 12 months I said he said yes 12 months I said why he said so he can see what the ministry here is doing and so he can see what God's doing in the people and he can either decide to get on board with it or he can choose to go someplace else he says but otherwise they come in and they want to change they want to change the people they want to change the church they want to do all those things he says they've got to come in and see what God's doing first before they can presume to get in there and be a part of it right see what happens is we've got we can't just step in you know um if you've ever worked at all you'll get new employees come in they always want to change things up and there is a place and there's a time for that but first you got to understand what's really going on before you can make any changes that's what he's talking about here the son that's what we're talking about he's got to be able to catch the father's Vision he's got to understand what's going on so that he doesn't get caught up in his own thinking and he can continue to do the will of the father even if the father's not there to tell him to do it all the time he's got those principles baked into him he says the father taken him out into a public place and set him up before the public his same son that had been born in his home years before all the time his son but his character and his conduct had brought him to another office character and conduct another position a higher level of responsibility a greater position of impact and importance he says I hope you see it our character should have us up into a place where we can be in an office to do what build a great great ministry have people look at us have a tremendous impact influence recognition he says so we can be in an office in a position to meet the crisis of this hour that we're in God's training us for what's coming he knows it from the beginning to the end and he's training us so that when the crisis comes we're fit to handle the crisis but I want you to see what that looks like he says what a shame we are 1956 he didn't have a high opinion of the church but notice how we meet this crisis notice how we handle the crisis when the crisis comes and I'm all prepared and I'm an adopted son how do I meet the crisis do I meet it head on with what I know he says but will God answer in a type of crisis in a time of Crisis how do we meet a crisis we go to the father and we say what is your will what would you do what's going on here Lord I've shared this before I'll share it again sometimes people ask me to pray about something and I pray but I don't pray the prayer they're asking I go and I say Lord what's your will for the situation because my emotions can be drawn to a certain area but that doesn't make it God's will remember Jesus went to the pool of basa or Bethesda and he came in there and there's maybe dozens maybe hundreds maybe a thousand people I don't know laying there and he goes and he heals one man now me and my carnality would walk in there I'd see all of those there I know I've got power I know I've got Authority and I'd want to go and heal every single one of them wouldn't I sure we want to heal everyone we want to make everyone whole he goes in and he heals one and he walks out and not only that but he takes Flack for letting him carry his bed on a Sabbath day one person but how do we meet the crisis we go back to the father he says but God will God answer in a time of Crisis he says he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of Crisis if the people assemble together no matter of two or three whatever it is and pray there he said he would hear from Heaven God wants us to be to the place that when the bullets start flying when things are just going haywire and things are just moving so fast and it's chaotic he's got a people that'll drop to their knees and say Lord what would you have your servant to do that's an adoption ready child of God you say brother John I got to make a decision be still and know that I am God seek the scriptures pray before God confirm it through that and walk forward but don't be scared to wait you know this world wants us to make quick decisions and the scripture never gives us a place to do that we ought to be able to wait on the Lord to trust that he can show us what he wants us to do in these areas we're ordained to meet the crisis of the hour to handle it with Grace and with a Christlike nature at all times the squeeze the pressure the timeline ought not to change us into some freak like the world to answer the way they would amen God's preparing us for what lies ahead so that when that squeeze comes all that comes out is Christ The Living Word amen because we've gone to him we know him we know he's our source of strength and encouragement and Direction and these different things we're tied to him you know what hap what has to happen someplace along the road is we've got to fall in love with Jesus that's it cuz what holds us together what holds my wife and I together when things aren't so so good love love that's what holds me to him is love I know he loves me and I know I love him but I know he loves me more than I love him too amen but someplace along the line I've got to fall in love with him so that when everything hits the fan I'm okay with it and like job said though he slay me yet I'll trust him though I lose it all yet I'll trust him though he moved me to the godforsaken land of Newan land I'll Trust trust him not only that I'll enjoy it I'll enjoy it amen why cuz he does all things good he does all things for my good he's got me in the palm of his hand I don't have to be driven by the world's timeline I can rest and trust that he's got it in control listen to this he says now listen Presbyterian friend Methodist Baptist Pentecostal when you're born again he says that only puts you in the family it's your character your conduct that gives God confidence in in you the reason we haven't got the great church marching on today is because God can't find people to put his confidence in now watch what breaks his confidence he says the Holy Spirit keeps saying they're tearing up they're breaking up they're doing this they're off on the lines what is it it's men creating divisions you know what sometimes it's women creating divisions I was reading an ax the other day you know what happened they stirred up the Jews stirred up The Devout women to C problems they ain't always Brothers sometimes it's sisters let's not put it all on the ministry either he says they're off on the lines stay with God's word that's God's truth that's the pattern that's the blueprint that's the reason the church today has got all kinds of isms and everything in it is because they don't stay with the word they won't listen to the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit won't testify of one other thing but God's word that's exactly right I said said it already but this is where the rubber meets the road when you see people tearing churches apart it's never the Holy Spirit if God wants to tear a church apart he'll do it because God raises up and God takes down God lets left Saul in in in control for what 15 years a king that did not have the spirit of a king on him he left him in control for 15 years and you know we'd say brother Ed hammermeister gave me a book called called the three kings it's a story of David and the the things he went through but you know what happens is there's a line where they're trying to get Absalom to to take power and he says no no no no no and then finally it gets to the point where he says I've got to do this no you don't no you don't that's God's anointed and what did David say time and time again that's God's anointed what do you mean he's off he's got an evil spirit on him yeah God anoint anointed him and until God anoints somebody else not just anoints them but puts them in position I'm not making a move David knew if God anointed him God would put him in position he didn't have to push for it and so many times what happens is we get frantic in the situation and we forget that it's God's church it's his body it's his bride we don't have to do a thing if someone's off God will either correct them or he'll remove them that's the way he does it's the way he does it but we don't have to go splitting up and tearing up and doing all these things God's in control let's have patience for it that's one sure sign of people being out of the will of God I read you two quotes on this that they're tearing apart other people listen we've had people leave this church we've had people come to this church I've been in churches where we had tons of people leave we've had people come in God doesn't say this is the only place you can go to church God's got a fivefold Ministry spread out across the entire world he's got got somebody to feed you and if it's not here that's okay doesn't have to be here but praise the Lord if he'll give you some place to feed because he's got to feed you and he's got a five-fold ministry that's there to do it you know brother Bram said the only thing we take out of here is what character and if our character doesn't allow us to get along here how do we think we're going to get along up there amen we ought to be able to put aside our differences person draws a Line in the Sand to put you out what do you do walk with God somebody calls you out what do you do walk with God somebody disagrees with you what do you do walk with God just keep walking just live the life of Christ that's all he wants from us I don't answer to anybody else now it's easy when people walk away and they just walk away my wife and I were talking about this the other day you know people have left this message and some of them just went peacefully into the night and that's literally where they went into the night night and they're in darkness today and it's horrible but they went peacefully but what about when they're feisty what about when they're combative and do websites like believe the sign what do you do then do we respond as they've responded that's not the conduct of Christ what about when they drag your name through the mud what then Jesus said they did it to me they're going to do it to you that's right like get over it that's part of our it's just part of being a Christian things aren't always going to be nice people aren't always going to be nice and sometimes the one that disappoint us most are professing believers and you know what I got to grow up and you got to grow up and I'm going to disappoint you and you're going to disappoint me and we got to be able to get over it that's the conduct of adopted Sons and Daughters of Christ is they move on regardless you know what we did training when I was in BC and they're talking about conflict resolution and they said what do you do if somebody's got a problem with you at work and I said the first thing I or they said what have you know and what if you don't like somebody or somebody doesn't like you they said what do you do I said the first thing I asked myself is have I done something to them and she looked at me and she said are you serious I said yes she said I've never heard anybody say that anymore listen I'm imperfect and sometimes God will use a donkey to correct me and sometimes he'll use a senior Minister that I really respect to correct me but correction is correction and if it's by the word I've got to be able to say Lord is there any truth to what they're saying and if there is help me to humble myself and be corrected whether it's a donkey or whether it's a senior Minister that I love and respect I've got to be able to accept word correction regardless of the source and if I can do that then I can move on with God can't I watch this he says and now if if the other fellow draws the line you just live right along his line Don't force the issue you get as close to that person as you can he says you be the salt and God will make him thirsty if you'll be the salt you are the salt of the earth and salt if it contacts saves he says and and it salt creates a thirst and people will thirst when they see you talking about the Seven Seals when they recognize the mystery of godhead when they really understand destination no people will get thirsty when they see you living the life that you should live as a son and daughter of God ye are what written Epistles seen and read of all men what does it look like Paul said this I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me that's the believer that's the hidden life that's the overcoming power I'm dead but now I'm alive and it's because Christ is living in me the life which I now live in this flesh in this sing flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me he said didn't he didn't say Christ visits me Christ drops in from time to time he says Christ lives in me amen we're a temple of the Living God this is a permanent residence it's the everpresent god in our lives day by day he lives in us and that's the only thing that's going to make a difference is when Christ is living in me I can know the message front to back I can memorize this Bible and it won't make a difference if I don't have Christ inside of me to make it live the way it's supposed to live he says the only way people will see Jesus is when they see him in you Church look at our responsibility this morning ye you are written Epistles and if Christ Spirit dwells in you and brings your conduct into subjection to his spirit and makes you act like him and talk like him walk like him live like him he says see people see Jesus in you that's why I said people aren't responsible for what I preach here this morning if they don't come here but they ought to see what's being preached here in your life and that's when they become responsible for it because a light has crossed their path the word has crossed their path the manifestation of Christ has cross their path and they'll be judged by the life you live question is do we have a life that can judge them not looking to put somebody out but looking to make somebody thirsty looking to catch their attention so that somebody would see what's the attraction on the mount it's Christ in you the hope of glory but we know Satan wants to hinder us and if he can't stop us he wants to slow us down he wants to get us sitting on the sideline he wants to get us immobile he wants to get us mired in doubts and fears he wants to get our attention off the prize he wants to present another purpose to us or failing that he wants to give us another road to that purpose that's what he did with Jesus remember he offered him all of the world without the cross that's not the way character is won character is a victory it means there's got to be a battle you've got to stand firm on what the word of God says but God's Got a Way he's got a plan he's got a purpose for these things and that's what we've got to fight for find his will and stay in it and that's a daily thing that's a morning thing I love when brother Dwayne was here you know and he reminded us and it was it was just for me if for nobody else he said what's the first thing you do when you wake up in my head I said pick up your phone and he said you pick up your phone right you check your messages anybody try and call is anybody texted what emails do I have waiting for me and he says you need to get into prayer and dedicate your life to God for that day to set the tone for what's going to happen right if I start my day with God I've got a lot better chance of me me recognizing that he's there throughout the day and catching what he's got for me to do and say listen to what he says he says but what's happened to you church you've seen so much television you say brother John I don't have television YouTube Tik Tok Snapchat Instagram Disney plus Amazon Prime you name it we've got it church I carry around a television with me every single day and most of us do as well so let's not pretend we don't have TVs anymore he says so much of the things of the world it's so easy for your old Adam nature to drift into that to act like the rest of them the old Adam feeds on what tree of knowledge the new Adam feeds on one thing Christ The Living Word what you feed is what will progress in your life it's that white dog black dog remember which one wins the one I feed the most there's a battle every day and the battle is often one in what you're feeding you feed right you'll win he says may I repeat this again in the offering of the atonement in the days of Moses when Moses brought the children out there was to be seven days that there was to be no leaven among the people anyone knows that in Exodus it says no leaven shall be found in your camp at all for seven days that seven days represented the full seven Church ages see no 11 but what is that he says no Creed no world Jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God's not even in you see and we're trying to mix that you can't do it you've got to come to one thing to believe in other words you can only believe one thing and here they are you're either going to believe God you're going to believe your church or you're going to believe the world he says you cannot mix it together you can't hold to them old things at the other Church before you did you've got to take the message of the hour he said what was left over don't let it stay till morning to come into this other age but burn it with fire and be destroyed that the age that you're living in the message of this age it's got to be brought out of the scriptures and Vindicated and proved by God that it's God doing so reminds me of Elijah up on Mount Carmel he says let us not help between two opinions if God be God let us serve God make a decision stick with it do you believe what you say you believe then let's live by it let's let our conduct show what we really believe if this be truth then everything else has to be false you can't mix two truths that disagree with each other they can't happen he says then you either receive that or reject it that's eternal life the leaders ship of the Holy Spirit leading his church now watch what he says he says the choice of your conduct oh oh we have a choice brother John absolutely we do he says you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward Expressions show exactly what's on the inside exactly what's on the inside the outward expression your conduct shows exactly your character what's on the inside see he says many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven he says that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so he says uhuh that's exactly right now I want you to catch what he's saying there as he's talking about the scripture that says that the rain falls on the just and the unjust because remember he's talking to mostly denominational Christians and they believe that when the spirit Falls that's when you're saved that's just the presence of God we're in church and the Holy Spirit sweeps through here here we get to feel it and what is it it's the it's the the the the Heavenly rain on our dry and parched souls and we can raise our hands and we can shout and we can do all these different things he says that's not eternal life that's just the rain falling and the weeds enjoy the rain just as much as the wheat does right that's not it I said it last service but if our time in the presence of God is only in church then we either don't have what we think we have or we're living way below our privilege way below our privileges we ought to be able to experience the presence of God anytime anywhere absolutely absolutely but you know how it's because you keep that relationship open you prioritize it those of you that are married the marriage works great when you do what prioritize your spouse when you give her when you give him your time your energy your affection your attention yes your money whatever it might be your body whatever when you are focused on prioritizing that relationship magically the relationship gets better it's weird how it works it's not weird makes perfect sense you prioritize it and things all of a sudden get better it's no different with Christ you get into his presence once you'll want to be there all the time I love how when David brother bam says David didn't have to get prayed up when he went to meet Goliath he already prayed up he' already made everything right the line between him and heaven was crystal clear there was no filters there there was no blocking it there was no hidden sins everything between him and God was perfect and so David could just walk right into the will of God and just move right on why the lines of communication were open the relationship was established he didn't have to go and make things right he' just come right into the presence of God and God would hear his prayer and he moved right on with it David was known we preached on this recently he would go into the presence of God he'd get the will of God and he'd come out and he'd lead the people to battle and they always won the victory why cuz he took time to get the will of God before he made a move that's what we ought to do if we can worship here we ought to be able to Worship in our car in our home in our prayer Closet in our basement whatever it may be church when you're reading the message when you're listening to it when you're reading your Bible things ought to jump out that this is God speaking to me Desiring a relationship with me right amen we're temples of the Living God I say we're living below our privileges he says if God Saves you knowing he's going to lose you he defeats his purpose so brother R was talking about there is when the the presence of God falls on us that's not salvation that's not eternal life but when it seals your soul that's eternal life he says if he if he he saves you knowing he's going to lose you he defeats his purpose he doesn't do that when he saves you you're saved he that heareth my words and believeth on him that has sent me had eternal life and shall never come into judgment but has passed from Death unto life he says so you're still a son and daughter but you're living under your privilege now watch what he says and your conduct each day as the Holy Spirit brings it before the father gives away the things that you do he says and you're still a son and daughter but you'll never be brought to the place where you should be you know what that tells me what holds me back what holds me back is what brother Matt does no what holds me back is what I do my conduct holds me back what I do dayto day holds me back what keeps me from stepping into a greater role in the kingdom of God my conduct not yours mine I can't blame anyone in my life for what they've done for my conduct and when you come into adoption or you're ready for adoption what you realize is you stand on your own two feet and you take responsibility for every decision you ever made that's it I can't control you you can't control me you can't make me live a certain way and I can't make you live a certain way my conduct determines where God will place me what holds me back from a greater gift in my life my conduct I'm the limiting factor in this equation I'm the one that holds God back because I've got to prove to him I've got to go through a time of testing to where I do the right thing the right way the right time right attitude right motive right objective and then he knows he can trust me and that takes time that takes seasoning that takes training amen what is it God Compares my conduct to his word and either get a thumbs up or a thumbs down there is no middle you either pass or you fail and if you fail then you go around the mountain again and if you pass then he moves you on to the next trial the next test the next role the next position but God wants us to take responsibility what happened in the garden first thing Adam did passed the buck not only did he pass the buck onto his wife but he says the wife that you gave me he blamed God and he blamed his wife and he didn't blame himself what is it fear caused him to push it to somebody else but perfect love casts out fear and we can stand on our own two feet we can take the licks we can take the punishment we can take the correction and say Lord help me to do better next time amen but even in all of this there a higher plane seriously brother John there's more to this yes there is because here's the thing sometimes and I listen I've learned this myself I'm still learning this you can do the right thing the wrong way sure absolutely attitude approach method motive objective that all plays in to doing the right thing it's not just right to it's not just okay to be right you've got to do it right amen how we do is just as important as what we do catch this Paul talks about this to Timothy I love Timothy because he he's a young man growing up into Ministry and and Paul left no excuses on the table for for Timothy no matter where Timothy was in life Paul had a work for him to do and a way to grow and a way to mature and Paul says the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men after to teach impatient the amplify puts it this way says a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome fighting and contending instead he must be kindly to everyone and mild-tempered preserving the bond of Peace he must be a skilled and suitable teacher patient and forbearing and willing to suffer wrong oh whoa willing to take a beating while doing the right thing and not respond he says in meekness instructing those that oos themselves in other words people are doing damage to themselves and you're trying to keep them from doing it you're doing it for their sake it's not comfortable for you but it's for their sake he says if God per avventure so he says just on the off chance that God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth the Amplified says he must correct those who are in opposition how with courtesy and gentleness in the hope that God May grant that they will repent and be led to the knowledge of the truth accurately understanding and welcoming it and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will you want to change somebody you got to come in the right way a brother shared this quote with me recently and it just hit me like a ton of bricks I thought it was so powerful brother Braham says it's not what you do it's the way you do it so sometimes it's not what you say it's the way you say it I said this is something I'm learning stepping into a pastoral role you got to grow and you can make mistakes at times and you got to learn from that reset and go forward but brother bradam here if you go back and look up the quote he's talking about that hunting guy Bert remember Bert he had the meanest eyes and what did he do he would go and he would shoot The Fawns and it was a conservation mechanism it was legal to do the game wardens wanted them to do it they had too many deers so they were saying just kill the young ones he said he he said Bert would kill eight or 10 but he said but he enjoyed doing it and he would do it to shock people he enjoyed showing that he liked to kill something harmless and cute he was shooting bambies right that just that's a horrible thing to do kill a small animal and he loved to do it but remember what changed his heart was when he gave that call and even though that Doe knew it was hunting season she stood up and she offered her life because she thought that her young were there and it changed his heart and brother BR him brought him to Christ there but what he's talking about here is that some people take joy in putting people down or putting people out rather than trying to bring them in they're really trying to put them out remember we have I know we've heard it people will say give them the word test oh just give them the word test talk to them about serpent seed talk to them about godhead talk to them about predestination if they don't accept that they're not children of God come on we've all heard it I know I've heard it multiple multiple times but you know what we don't hear give them the word test with a word attitude this is the word attitude Amen Let Your approach be as in line with the word that you're hoping to bring with them amen let your approach be something that would draw them in rather than push them away because so often what pushes them away is not what we're saying it's how we're saying it amen they might even agree if they had time to sit down and calm down and not be offended at how we're saying things but they can't because we're too abrasive we're too rough we're harsh and overbearing we have a take it or leave it attitude rather than in there contending for their souls contending for their souls that's what we're doing this is a life and death situation our response to the Eternal Word of God determines where we're going to go and our attitude can change exactly where they end up they may never come into a new birth but they may receive eternal life that's right just because they've accepted Christ as their savior if we're arrogant in our approach how can it be Christ amen the more we know the more humble we ought to be if we're trying to get the beam out of somebody else's eye let's make sure we've got it out of our own as well amen you know my wife and I spent hours talking to a minister one time a very senior Minister and we are asking them questions and we are poking and we were prodding and it couldn't have been comfortable for him and you know what he did he answered patiently and calmly and quietly for hours and hours and hours and hours way into the wee hours of the morning didn't get impatient didn't get offended senior Minister who are you to challenge me who are you to talk no no no he sat there and he laid out everything he believed scripture quote scripture quote time and time again no problems why apt to teach patient meek if he wanted to he probably could have torn me apart but he didn't he wanted me to see where he was coming from that's how Fellowship ought to be that's how witnessing ought to be that's how Ministry ought to be amen but you know what then I had a minister come to me after that that disagreed with the way that man preaches with that Doctrine you know what he didn't say he didn't say oh I heard you had him and you let him convince you I heard you gone over to the other side brother John he said maybe when you have some time you can tell me about what you've learned he didn't presume that I changed he didn't presume I'd gone to the dark side he said maybe when you get time you can share with me how your view has changed and why it's changed or how it's changed I love both those men dearly and they're on opposite sides of a Doctrine right now but both of them showed the right attitude both of them had the right spirit and I trust they'll maintain that Spirit not just in private but over their pulpits as well but that's how it ought to be amen because here's one thing I don't know it all I Used to Know It All then God changed me but I don't know it all and that means I've got to be able to be corrected I've got to be able to be taught I've got to be able to see there's more than what I've got there's more than what I know there's more than what I understand there's more than even what I believe that there's always something there and I'll tell you what if we've got an open heart to it God will bring somebody with the right attitude and the right Spirit to help us come that way way amen he's got somebody prepared to do that God's always got a witness available if we've got our heart to receive it but bra says that's what the Pentecostal Church ought to do yet we're made fun of and called every kind of a name that we could be we ought to conduct ourselves like Sons and Daughters of God because God is our King women ought to dress and act like ladies men ought to be men ought to be Sons and Daughters of God our character Our Testimony ought to stand high in the City the Bible said that you are the salt of the earth and the salt is the Savor if it contacts put salt here and meat there it'll never save the meat man if you got it in the salt shaker here and you got the meat here it doesn't do any good you got to put them together he says you got to put the salt and the meat together and salt creates a thirst I tell you what we need tonight is to be so salty till we make men and women thirst to be like you scripture says we're in the world but we're not of it but that doesn't mean we sit at our home in our country couch the salt has to be out where people can contact it and the light has to be out where people can see it we do not isolate ourselves from the world we don't get into relationship right we don't tie ourselves to the world but we have to be in it so they can have a witness so that they can have a testimony of what it's supposed to be he says go on say if there was ever a Christian I don't go to her church but she's really a Christian there's the man I don't go to his church I go to another church but if there was ever a Christian there's one of them that's what salt looks like he says that's what we want that's the kind of character that God wants the Holy Spirit to bring record to him oh if this boy was a good boy his life of God reflected in him the life of his father reflected in him he says now we're sons of God then God ought to reflect his life in you Jesus said if I do not what the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works of my father believe the works he says there you are we ought to be reflecting the life of God in our life God ought to reflect we ought to have all the doubt and everything so beat out of us in such a place till when when God wants to say now see one of my children there he's got so and so and one of mine here he'll not get squirmy and go jumping from place to place he believes my word he stands right there right out at the top yes sir nothing can make him change because he's reflecting my life amen God bless you let's stand if you would we've taken a title of confirmative action that the life we live the conduct we have confirms what's inside of us amen and God's trusting us God's got faith in us God's Got A belief that we can handle what's in there in our path amen but you see here that brother Braham says he's he's got confidence that we'll come to a maturity where we won't be moved off the word no matter how hard it is you know I think so many times what we want to do is we want to agree in any way possible that we end up stepping over the word many times but we've got to be able and I think this goes especially amongst us as Believers man if you see me doing something wrong don't come and try and and wishwood it over have a Straight Talk amen that we would provoke one another to Good Works rather than massage what we're doing to try and make it into good works that we can be serious about these things because if we can't do it with each other we'll never do it with the world we've got to have an honesty and sincerity amongst ourselves I think before we can move on to those outside but he's put a responsibility on us to present the word to this age even if they never come to church even if they never step foot inside this building even if they never hear the end time message preached that they would still see there's something there that they need that's different especially to those that are in denominations that think they're okay where they're at brother B puts it this way and we're closing on this quote he says you know there's so many of us and most all of us influence Somebody by the things that we do and the way we live and the things we say we influence somebody somebody is watching your life he says and when we profess to be Christians what type of life should we live if somebody is watching us he says in your life that you live will reflect an influence on somebody their Eternal destination will rest upon the way that you live and the things that you do he says for they watch you what responsibility do we have this morning remember I've said read that scripture that says all we do do all in the name of the Lord Jesus that's what's going to convince people is that we don't go into our house and we're different indoors than we are Outdoors that we're different in church than we are when we're out in the world that we go to job our job and we're one person we're in the building here and we're another person but that continuity of life that continuity of conduct is what God's looking for that no matter where we go we never put the word aside and we acknowledge the god of our life no matter where we go it's amazing what happens when you have the mindset Lord help me be a witness you'll realize there's a lot of opportunity out there and it's just in the simplest of things that we say sometimes and people will look at you and then you got an opportunity to share more about what God's doing even something as simple you know out at the ski hill and somebody said yeah we're having great weather and I said yeah thank God it's an answer to prayer something as simple as that they go whoa yeah and then they see commenting on my my daughter and my wife and they're wearing skirts oh I really like that where did you get that in these different things everywhere we go church people are looking and they're watching and they don't even know what they're looking at sometimes until we open our mouth to let them see why we are the way we are but that's what he's looking for people that will live the same in and out of church in and out of their homes whether they're with a Believer they're not with a Believer no matter what the situation the environment the pressures whatever it will be that their actions their life stays right with the word day in and day out that's when he says he's ready to be adopted is when we act the way we say we ought to act when we live the way we say we want to live when we eat the things we say we want to eat and when we produce the thing that we say is the desire inside of our hearts amen God bless you this morning let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we know this is a work of your hands Lord and like the scripture says it's not by might it's not by power but it's by your spirit but Lord we see here that your Prophet said that we make a choice of our conduct Lord that every single day every single moment we make a choice life or not life Lord there's no riding the fence Lord we've got to make a decision I'll live for you or I'll live for myself and Lord we're coming to a place Lord we're in the adoption season Lord I believe you're wanting to raise us into a place where we could do your Works in a greater way than we ever have before but Lord you're looking at our conduct you're looking at what we respect you're looking at what we prioritize Lord I pray that as you look Lord that what you see would please you Lord I pray that my life would please you I pray that the life of each and every believer that's here this morning Lord would be pleasing to you Lord and we know we're so imperfect Lord we fall flat on our face so many times Lord forgive me Lord forgive us where we
