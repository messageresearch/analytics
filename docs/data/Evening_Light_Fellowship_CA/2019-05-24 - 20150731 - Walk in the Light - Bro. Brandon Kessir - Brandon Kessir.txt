[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] bring that the tree that they were forbidden to eat up in the garden had the baptism of the holy ghost we have access to that tree of life a man by the grace of God and if you notice maybe I should read it it's in the first church Shh the first church age not not the last one but it says he that has it here that I'm here what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God and so the baptism of the Holy Ghost were partaking of that tree onto the change of our bodies a man we have been changed and we are being changed and we will be changed by the grace of God keep partaking of the tree of life amen Lord bless you and we welcome everyone from out of the city outside the city and we certainly welcome our brother Brandon Kessler from Alberta it's been a long trip it's been so many delays and so when it comes to the length of his servant tonight we'll leave that between him and the Lord if he wants to preach for an hour that's that that'll be fine a half hour that'll be funny or or two hours that'll be fine as the Lord leads him we understand that our brothers had a long hard trip so in physically he may be somewhat tired but again we pray the Holy Ghost will give him the anointing that he needs and the the energetic energy that he will need to get the word to you and me amen by the grace of God and the prophet of God said maybe you're going to wish that he doesn't hear this and about our brother Brandon and minister for us not long ago and we enjoyed his ministry so we know forward to the Lord ministering again through our brother Brandon but the power God said now this morning before we approach the word oh he said let's not be in no hurry about anything he said you got all day today and he said and tonight and tomorrow and he said let's just take our time and not rush these things through now some of us don't some do he said you don't have to work tomorrow any out well if your work is not going to be heavy labor it doesn't make a difference if it's heavy labor then it would make a difference but I do recall as I've said before that in over the last years in the early days of them the ministry and the message people didn't care that mattered not to them they went through a service and then went to work that's the truth that's the truth as I told you one time before that we were witnessing to someone in in Buuren and we went there it might have been maybe early in the night and then after a fellowship we heard the alarm law in the bedroom and we looked at our watches and it was 5:30 a.m. and we had fellowship fellowship talked about the word talked about the work and the alarms alarmed us we were wondering what was going on and the sister said oh she said that's my son he has to go to work at 6 o'clock and and we were not even tired but we we dismissed it and one of the brothers there or a couple of the brothers networking with us they also had to go home get something to eat and go to work a van then one of them was brother brother Smith he's gone on to be with the Lord now and he went he went on to 84 years god bless him with it with a long life a man but again is the anointing from the inside a man and says he said you don't have to hurt tomorrow anyhow so we just take our time this is a New Year's Eve message and he said and that's the reason I thought instead of preaching just about three or four hours that I would take eight or ten hours on teaching eight or ten hours and well you'd be almost like Paul preaching till sunrise hey man but I tell you this if your heart is in it God's in it a man by the grace of God a man and he said there is not a person here we ought to seek it out what God wants he said out of our heart to find out what it means he said concerning the new birth and he said there's not a person in here that wants to go to torment into a place of torment that's why we're here tonight we want to go to the other place of comfort not torment and he said so he said you don't drive hundreds of miles over icy roads and spend your living spend your living he said your money just to come to church and shake hands more to it than that he said just to shake hands although you'd love to do that and to hear the pastor or the hear myself or other ministers speak no no he said there's something that draws you here a man is something eternal we come to hear our brother Brandon but again not our brother Brandon we come to hear God speak through our brother Brandon a man this let's believe that let's understand that that we're not going to hear brother Brandon and Kesler we're going to hear the Lord Jesus Christ yes him speaking through his servant a man by the grace of God so being prayer for him and the prophet of God said now this is the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others for others and he said that's perfectly eternal life you don't live it for yourself you live for others you put your life as where in the background crisis in the front and he's in the body and he said when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but he said when you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life amazing isn't it he said eternal life is living for others the body of Christ first remember he talked about giving to the poor he said the body of Christ first and if you've got extras you can give it to those out there disappointments at the judgment because they failed to realize this and acknowledge it amen he said turn alive is living for others and it proved that when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and an eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others he lived for you so how much are you living for him not going to church for living for him he live for others and you received eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live brothers a man thank God for the word so again remember our brother Brandon in prayer got to give him the strength that he needs and also of course we welcome the the break family that sure that was there on Sunday morning there was Sunday morning a when's know what Sunday morning and so we take the Lord for their presence with us and that God will make them a blessing to us amen and for the brother Macondo who's able and sister Macondo is able to make and brother Menasha able to make a Dean from Buer god bless and we were wondering if brother brandon was going to make it and what we would do if he didn't well him I said brother McConnell's there he can minister brother Bob said well together you were a brother my condo where are the other amen so God God God provides a man and also brother Brandon will be ministering tonight and again tomorrow night at 6:30 and Sunday morning at 7 or 11 o'clock rather it's on the morning and in central Newfoundland in our late brother guys assembly that brother Andre head from Tennessee will be ministering on Wednesday Friday and Sunday I believe Wednesday Friday and Sunday next week and the second week Wednesday Friday and Sunday so anyone that felt to go out and to hear our brothers ministry support our brothers ministry it'll be next weekend and the weekend after it'll be on Wednesday Friday and Sunday so God's grace to bless his ministry as well as the ministers to the Saints there in central Newfoundland now also to remind you that I have put some extra Bibles outside but there on the top of the shelf outside just in case that somebody comes leaving their Bibles home or somebody comes without a Bible a visitor or whatever so that they can use one of these Bibles it's the King James Bible and it is basically a giant print print reference Bible so if you borrow one I wanted to just to remind you to make sure you leave it in your seats or just lay it back out there on the shelf again for visitors that might come without a Bible so it's there for the use of the Saints and also I have two copies each of them at these books the messenger and generation this is by Angela Smith brother George Smith daughter and the other one is by well partly by sister Rebecca before she went and also brother George and I guess his family finished it after sister Rebecca's going because history Becca was planning on writing a book entitled my father of the Prophet but she never got to write it and I don't know if she had any anything written regarding these things but after this they printed this book on the messenger and it is just pictures of brother Browns ministry from beginning to end and and it is very very very good it's a blessing to me and I know it'll be a blessing to you now the generation book most of us know that is just testimonies of the brothers and sisters different brothers and sisters who met with whether Branham and who had fellowship with brother Branham you know personally and even to that sisters son one of her sons what was the her name anybody know her name God promise he said God's going to give you your two sons Eddie right well there's an interview with one of her sons and back at that time I don't know what he's doing now but he was a school bus driver so there's an interviewer there with him there's an interview with brother Billy ball and testimony of sister Lloyd's and so on and I might have been AI brother Macondo might have mentioned where the concerning marriage and I sure was you mentioned or not or somebody and that brother Brown did not go to their marriage because of what Billy Paul had done when he was 15 years old but the testimony here is that brother Branham did call them in before they went to get married and brother Brown called them in and and he talked to brother Billy Paul he talked to sister boys now they did not say what he said they did not reveal the conversation but he just gave him the instructions he said after you're married I want you to come back and see me again because he has some other things to say to them but they did not mention that either they but they do give their their testimony of their experience with brother Branham amen so we're not worshiping brother Branham but we thank God we thank God for the ministry and for the testimonies we have hear of the ministries and even a even a testimony of Brotherly Vail is here and brother Jack Mohr's daughter and that testimony is here as well and how that brother Graham had asked her to do the church age book and of course she turned it over to brother Levi oh so it's a blessing again not to worship brother Branham but to thank God for the prophets help us to appreciate what God has done in our generation and again like I said I don't understand them denying the cloud of angels I don't understand them denying the pillar of fire I don't understand them denying the prophecy of with him Branham of some of the teachings because again it's his teachings is it's the Lord Himself revealing to us and you can go I can go back to a message that the problem of God preached in 1961 and there he speaks of an experience that a sister had in her home as far as I know and it was it was the presence of God in the home it was it was hard to describe but they could see this in the room and it was like a like a cloud and like a pillar of fire it was all over the room and she called this one in and they saw it call that one in they saw it went and got her father to come and he came and he and he looked around he saw it and so she asked her father to pray and he just couldn't do it he's I can't I just can't be sitting in this presence and the prophet of God said this is 61 the October and and the problem of God said that it was a testimony that God was going to do something in the future amen and he did it was the cloud of angels amen they came down in the future because he different for reference a cloud that they had seen and but they couldn't explain the cloud so God explained it by coming down seven angels a man Christ explained it in the opening of the word praise the name of the Lord so the Lord bless you let's stand and we're gonna sing only believe all things are possible only Billy welcoming to our brother Brandon and turning the pulpit to our brother as the Lord leads priests what is on his heart by the grace of God we look forward to the fellowship with our brother and and the Ministry of the word again tomorrow night and on Sunday morning and of course not to forget sister baguette all the way from Tucson a man we thank her for bringing herself and the right spirit the right attitude and the power of 90 of the Holy Ghost but she didn't bring any good with her so but we appreciate her fellowship amen god bless her amen and god bless us all as we go to the word this thing and only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] [Laughter] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you saints it's good to be gathered with you again it's been a couple years but it's good to see you everybody's smiling faces that I recognize and for those that I don't god bless you and look forward to meeting you and to fellowship with you but you know I'm just thankful that the Lord takes for us when you look at many times just different situations when I first ran into trouble on the way here they said I wouldn't make it to about 7 o'clock tonight and we're just thankful that the Lord made away you know and you know we have a part to play in that trying to make arrangements but just try to put them in the Lord's hands and say order that's what you want you know if you want if it's your will for us to be here this weekend then we just want you to have your way you know we don't want to organize it because of our own ambitions our own ideas but we just come and say Lord whatever you want whatever you want to accomplish that's that's where we want to be is just right walking right in is perfect where I'm at so god bless you it's a real honor and privilege to be with you again and we certainly realize every time we come to service we have a responsibility of ministers to catch the inspiration from the Lord and then get out of the way and let the Lord speak however he wants and you know we want to recognize that receive me just bow our heads Lord Jesus father we're just so thankful that we are sons and daughters here Lord Jesus a group of believers gathered on Lord many miles from where I'm from but Lord still believing the same word Lord trusting in the same God and father we just want to come tonight Lord and worship and praise and thank you that you have a bride load around the world thank you that you have hearts that are soft to the leadership of your Holy Spirit and father tonight we just want to we want to come with open hearts we want to come with hello to a gentle spirit Lord just whatever you would speak to us though may capture attention Lord me that word be soon in our hearts Lord and and father may it find good ground tonight we pray we just ask that you would have your perfect way Lord shut my mouth to anything that you wouldn't want to speak Lord and and father may you just come forth and say what you have to see us tonight Lord we pray that you would have your perfect way in all things in Jesus we turn our Bibles to Isaiah chapter 60 very familiar scripture to us but look at this from a little bit different approach I'm sure they all appreciate we can be looking at the same mountain as I saved by looking at it from different angles and bring out different qualities I want to look at the thought of identification through this scripture here tonight brother Bob was singing the very first song was ancient words and that's just the song I really enjoy but we'll see in a sec how it fits here together so Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 1 says arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee oh there we go praise Allah arise and shine for that light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy rising then also in first Corinthians chapter 14 we find here Nepal speaking and he says for God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints god bless his word he may be seated so the reason I say that that song tied in so well is because you know to me the Bible is such an extraordinary book not just because of the words that are on the pages but because of the God that that inspired it because of the God that anointed men to write things down the the Bible is such a different book than any other book you know when we you know we read a book read a history book there's information in there that's very interesting there's things in there that you may be very stimulating all it's it's fascinating to hear you know I remember when we were visiting a couple years ago and we got to see some of the history of Newfoundland and go a Signal Hill and see all the different things there it's very interesting it stimulates our minds interesting but you know if you went there every day and you read the same information you know walk around the same thing read sento and you know this year this battle was fought and this you saw it day after day after day we get kind of dull we'll get kind of boring I already know this you know I already understand the content here so it's not it's not stimulating it's not it's not living anymore it just becomes dull in our years and or in our mind and to read the same things over and over again you know in any book you know if you you haven't memorized you know it just it doesn't bring you the same kind of stimulation or or life that it would the first time you'd read it but the Bible is such a different book that way because it is an ancient book it isn't a book that's stood the test of time but yet when we read it we don't read it in a way that becomes duller and duller every time that we read it oh yeah I already know the story yeah this was good this was interesting yeah oh you know all right well you know I'll just move on oh no I read this once you all read this one too oh I've read this chapter before you know I don't need to go back to that every time we go back to here I trust that every time we go back there we see something in it that we never saw before we see something we might have read you know the story you know of Daniel before but next time you go read the story of Daniel there's something else that you grasp from it there's something else that you pull from it it stimulates you no way that any other book wouldn't you know you read a book about you know any historical thing you you know you wouldn't necessarily grab something new because of it but the Bible has such incredible strength in that there's something for you today reading about something that happened some years ago and that's the incredible thing you know because why because it's God's Word and and we know that you know that God is his word he's not separated from his word he's not it's not just a bunch of things that God told us to do or you know things he did in other people's lives and then he just you know leaves it off separate from himself he is his work and even you know we think about God's will brother Brown tells us his will is his word you can't separate it you can't separate the characteristic of the word and the character stuff of God they're the same thing so that's an incredible thing you know you when you read something in the scripture you can read it and it happened in its time it was fulfilled in its time many times but yet there's something that's just as relevant and just as true and then sometimes an even greater manifestation today for God's elect then there wasn't its original fulfillment when it took place you know and so with this scripture that we just read in Isaiah we could point to the time of Jesus walking on the earth as a fulfillment of the scripture arise and shine that light has come the glory of the lord has risen upon me you know we can look at Jesus and say he fulfilled that completely you know he he did all he did that he walked as the light of God you know he's Sean he he caught everybody's attention you know it says the Gentiles shall come to thy light the kings today to the brightness of that Rising that was fulfilled in Jesus that you know that that came forth that already happened but as we read it it doesn't get duller and duller and dimmer to us we realize there's a fulfillment of it again today you know there's a fulfillment of it today that's just as strong and powerful as it was in Jesus you know if we were to read the Bible like we would read other books or the stories you know they they lose their meaning they lose their significance say oh that was different that was in Jesus day but when we read about it today we realized it's it's not even just about Jesus in the form that he was walking on the earth it's about Jesus in his elect right now you know we many people look at Jesus the scripture we just read maybe and say Jesus was the light of the world Jesus did you know shine forth and you know David said though the Word of God is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path and there's a lot of people that treat Jesus as a light you know light into their path just like a lantern you know the people would look at and say you know I believe in Jesus and it shines the way before me you know when I came to the Lord when I repented of my sins when I gave myself to the Lord you know when I when I confessed my faults when I accepted his mercy His grace to me that's that became a light in my life and so now when I as I walked there's a there's a path there's a lantern and you know they can bear their salvation out in front of them and say you know this is what leads missus what lights my path you know and there's a measure of power that comes with that there's you know there's a measure of strength that comes from being able to bear the word of God like that but you know that wasn't the way that God intended it to be like a flashlight or a lamp to us that we could pick up or put down whenever we feel like it we could turn it on or turn it off whenever we feel like it that it's that strength would you know get brighter or dimmer depending on how fresh the batteries were or you know how much fuel was in the lantern you know that that wasn't the way that God intended his light to be you know just just a little beam shining forth to let your way Jesus says here speaking of himself he said then spake Jesus unto them saying I am the light of the world he that fall with me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life you know and many people have taken that scripture say alright you know I've got some I've got Jesus in my heart shining forth like I said as a lantern there's a lamp but when John writes about Jesus coming he says there was a man sent from God whose name was John but the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him I believe he was not that light John but he was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light Jesus which lighteth every man that cometh into the world John the Baptist wasn't the life Jesus was the way but look it wasn't supposed to stay there it says in verse 10 it says he was in the world the world was made by him in the world knew him not and he came unto his own excuse-me his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name you know he didn't give you the power to to bear just his name but he gave you the power to become sons and daughters of God maybe after the exact same way that he was made you know he was the light of the world and so if we were made in the same way then we become the light of the world you know a lot of people don't like that they like to be able to push the light onto Jesus and all the light stays there and when I feel like you know when I feel like being spiritual when I feel like being religious I pick it up and I give myself a little light if I you know if I'm running into trouble if I'm sick if I'm afflicted then I pick up the light and I'll try to shine my way you know what Oh God bring me out of this darkness bring me through this trial but that's not the way it's intended to be Jesus says you are the light of the world and a city that sit on set on a hill cannot be hid a lot of times we want to hide why we go to work and we kind of want to hide you know I hide it a little bit because you know when the light shines forth it both illuminates and exposes and when it exposes there's a lot of negativity that comes with it you know Jesus we you know that the way that the worlds twisted the image of Jesus is you know as though when Jesus spoke everybody just smiled and their hearts were just warmed and everybody just loved him so much and everybody just sat with her hands on the house oh isn't that wonderful well there were people that responded to Jesus that way and there were people that picked up stones trying to kill him when he said this exact same thing why because the light blue manifested and exposed whatever was in their lives and and Jesus is saying here you are the light of the world you know we shouldn't go in you know we want to avoid conflict sometimes I know I certainly do you know you go into situation people ask me on the plane you know or different things oh you know you know what are you coming to new plumbing front I mean from here I said oh no I'm going to visit some friends you know and it it's easier to say I'm going to visit friends and say well yeah I'm going to preach the gospel you know why because people at home oh really huh that's interesting you know and and the light exposes things that necessarily you don't want to deal with right you know Vic telling you about I can't wait to go to the music festival this weekend and you drink a bunch and you know everything else and and they don't want to hear you say that you're coming to preach a sermon the same night that they're not going to remember what happens right so you know it's easier many times to kind of hide the light to kind of you know shelter it or protect ourselves you know when we go to school maybe children we we don't act the same way that we would in church maybe we wouldn't you know in church we would raise our hands we praise the Lord but you know at school maybe we wouldn't bow our heads and and pray over our food because it brings a certain amount of reproach it brings you know a different kind of atmosphere when you get around certain people you know not that you would act worldly but you would try to suppress that light a little bit because it because it makes manifest it makes people uncomfortable but Jesus said that's the way it's supposed to be it's supposed to be displayed for everyone to see that light is supposed to shine forth like a city that's set on a hill you know no matter which direction you'd approach it from all you'd see you'd see that City and from from any direction that's the way that the light of God is supposed to be not just in Jesus but in God's elect today he says neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but put it on a candlestick you know when when we are lit on fire for God we want to control that but who lit the fire God lit the fire and so because he he lit the candle he wants to have it display you know he didn't light the candles he could hide it in a room nobody ever sees it he put he lit the candle in your life so that you could shine and that light could be expressed let your light so shine before many said that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven you know I think that's one of the things that that people get so confused about people you know really expressing the lack of Christ in their own life they say well you're getting you know you're gonna get too you know too self-centered you know someone like brother Browns ministry a lot of the criticism that comes from it is saying he made himself God he made himself this he made himself that but Jesus tells us that you're the light of God and thereby expressing that light you're glorifying your father which is in heaven you know God's not afraid to share that Laurey and he and god's not worried that when you act like you should when you act like a son or daughter of God that he's somehow missing out because your attention you know people might be captured and give you the attention no God says that it glorifies your father to express the light that he put in you you know God's not worried oh man you know what are people gonna think if you know if his young brother here gets you know on fire for me they might they might get focused on him no he says that's that's the glory of God arising and shining in this person's life you know it's it's being expressed and there's nothing more glorious than a son of God being expressed that's what makes the Word of God truly powerful not when we can just enjoy the benefits of what somebody else's light is shown for but when when we ourselves have an identification in God brother Ram says in the fusion church age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank God in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ there is a purpose in it there's an expression that needs to take place to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ you know and I think it's interesting here that you know we gotta quit saying in our own self there will be there will be there will be he says here you know that that the bride will do this but it needs to actually start taking place you know the the light is not one day the bride will shine is the light you're the bride God's giving you his word God's put his Holy Spirit in you so shine now shine now don't wait say oh you know one day I'm going to shine know it's the shining of that light that produces the conditions ready for Christ's coming you know it's not all rapture morning Matt I'm really gonna shine for him know if you're not shining for him till rapture morning you're not going we have to be identified with Christ otherwise we're not going to to get in the condition that we need have a body change it should compel us to arise and shine the glory of the Lord is risen not upon Jesus now but upon mrs. Jesus Christ upon the Bride of Christ she is a light and witness of God in this time you know that doesn't take anything away from Jesus that doesn't take anything away from any other spiritual person that God's used in fact it's a greater glory because now in this last age God is using his bride in the same power in the same demonstration of his word as he did in Jesus a sinless body this the scripture tells us that the glory of the latter temple is greater than the first you know if you're to read here to read about the original temple that Solomon built it was much more incredible than the restored temple that they built when they came out of Babylon it was much more magnificent you know had much more gold and precious things in it because it was a time when they when Israel was rich and able to provide all those things the the temple that they built with zerubabbel and and all the different ones there it wasn't nearly as glorious in the actual magnificence of the building you know it wasn't it wasn't as bright and shiny it wasn't as as incredible but yet God said the glory of the latter is greater than the first why because it was easy in Solomon's time to build this temple of great riches and splendor when everything was going great in the kingdom was at its peak and everything else but for those believers to come out of Babylon and return and of their own strength and time and effort and give of themselves to produce that second temple it was more glorious in the eyes of God because it came from a greater place of sacrifice a greater place of subjection to the Word of God then it took for Solomon to do everything and they just follow his lead and so when we find in this time that we live it's wonderful that Jesus Sean forth and and truly God put such a witness forth that you know in a sinless body he could overcome every devil he could overcome every demon power over all things but it's even more glorious in the eyes of God than in a sinful body in a body that was born in sand that was separated from God that had no chance of ever making anything on its own that God could have the same kind of authority the same kind of power the same kind of life shining through and overcome the devil the same way that's even more glorious than it was in Jesus so what hinders us from shining light sounds so good you know all of us how what hinders us there's darkness gross darkness on the people the Bible said darkness on the earth and gross darkness on the people it's not the earth that's the problem so much it's the people on the earth you know it's the anointing on the people of the earth you know that's the the fall didn't take place when the Lions got out of order the fall didn't take place on the elephant's got out of order the drafts of zebras are and when the oceans just started pushing their boundaries no the world got out of order when man fell when man when man chose darkness rather than light that's what caused the fall and so when we see there's darkness on the earth sure but the real darkness is on the people Jesus says the light of the body is the eye if therefore that eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if that eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee but to be darkness how great is that darkness you know there's a reason why this world so spiritually dark you know it's not because you know there's drug abuse it's not because there's alcohol it's not it's because people have rejected God that that's the reason that it's dark it's not dark because you know this you know the murder rates high it's not dark because you know global warming it's not dark because of any of those thing is dark because people have rejected their Creator people have rejected the God that made them jesus said if our eyes are on him single focused then we are full of life but if our eyes are evil how great that darkness will be you know if our focus of our attention is is off of him and on to all of the things of the world how great that darkness will be jesus said in John 12 yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth while you have life believe in the light that you may be the children of length these things spake Jesus and departed and did hide himself from them and says you know it's just it's interesting that he's telling you you have the light or you still have a choice when when the lights presented to you in the light you know it is displayed before you have a choice to walk in that light or to continue on in darkness you know you have a choice you know that's why it's not good enough to come to church and have the light manifested before you you have a choice walk in that light walk in that light that you may be the children of light you know there there needs to be a participation of the children of God walking in the same light that you walked in not just coming around the light like bugs attracted to a light ball but but actually staying in that light walking in that light conducting ourselves as children of God Jesus tells us there that that those that walk in darkness don't know where they're going and really that's the true condition of this world you know if we're speaking of identification here how much harder does it become to identify thing in the dark you know right now you know what the lights on in here we can see each other clearly we can see we know exactly who sit in every pew you know whether I know who they are or not doesn't matter I can clearly see you I can see even a bee they're just hiding there we're hiding brother Mark and you know I can see each and every one of you and and it's clear you know I'm not gonna fall flat on my face trying to walk out the door hopefully because I can see where I'm going it's clear the way is plain but if we were to shut off all the lights you know there's no light shining in from the windows and we had to try to make our way without any light we have trouble you know we wouldn't be sure we see a dark shape I'm not sure who that is this sitting there I don't remember is that this brother is that you know that sister I'm not sure you know maybe we'd you know feel our way along the wall I said the light switch oh just the I'm not sure it brings uncertainty and it brings down you know I'm sure most of you have this experience like I've had you know you you get up in the middle of the night maybe to use the washroom or check on something and it's dark in your room and the you know normally you'd walk through your bedroom and you'd have no trouble you wouldn't be bumping into things you wouldn't you wouldn't bang your toe on the bed frame or anything but in the darkness you do what it's because it's not clear it's not plain you're very familiar with the room you know you're very familiar with all the things that are in there and yet you still bump into them you still you know aren't sure maybe your feeling for the light switch and you know you're reaching way down here and the light switch is up there you're reaching up here it's a this is a house that you live in this is something that you deal with every day but yet in the darkness it becomes unfamiliar it becomes it becomes uncertain and it brings doubt you know you've traveled to a place in the in the day I think that's always funny when you go to a place that you haven't been to maybe that that regularly and in the day it's so clear because you can you know this landmark here in this buildings here okay that's great but then you got to come back from that place in the dark you know maybe you go to someone's house and you know for dinner and you go there and in the light and you come back in the dark wow it seems like a totally different place you know now I can't see all of the same landmarks that I used to identify the way on the way there you know now I'm not quite sure oh that's what really looked like the right corner it doesn't you know I don't really know you can't see that far off and you know maybe only you know you can see what's illuminated in your headlight but that's it you know you don't have as much clarity it so starts to make its history this is the return am i going the right way it's that uncertainty it makes it difficult to see the path clearly and that's really a great analogy for the world because the light of God's been rejected and spiritual darkness has brought a lot of doubt and uncertainty in the same kind of way you know things that were absolutely clear in the light of the past are now doubted and questioned and looked at differently you know think it was so clear a hundred years ago you know what marriage was it was so clear what you know raising a child was supposed to be like it was so clear how the school system should be said I mean all those things were so clear and they worked and they worked well but now it's so uncertain like oh well you know how do we define this how do we know this what oh maybe this could be just as good as that why because there's a state of confusion of darkness and it's really no wonder that the worlds in this confusion because people have lost most of the things they used to identify themselves in that darkness they've lost most of the things they used to identify themselves you know when you look at the founding fathers you know when we were in we were in Boston last year and we saw some of the things around you know when the United States found independence and and sister Jane this is for you I'm sister Priscilla yeah get a little American history in there but when we were there we you know we got to see some of the things a Paul Revere and and you know Samuel Adams and all these different founding fathers but it was important to them freedom of religion and what that meant to them meant that they could serve God without you know any creeds or doctrines and and things getting in the way that's how that's how they founded freedom of religion was the freedom to serve God with all your heart and not have anybody stop you but look at today what freedom of religion me freedom religion means you can you can live any way that you want you know in any kind of Filth and sinfulness and all of those things and still call yourself a Christian because you have freedom of religion you know I was reading about this this younger man who is who had grown up in church his father was a pastor as uncle was a pastor and big disgrace and everything rocks the church and and he he grows up and he takes the pastor ship over but he wants to reach out to new audiences so he's he's in his Christian Church right on the stained-glass windows above the the pulpit they've got symbols of Judaism they got symbols of Buddhism Muslim symbols cross all of these things and they're all on different panes of the window and yet you know he could present that as you know a religion that their freedom to worship however they want and present that as righteousness present that that that's the kind of principles that the founding father stood for but it's not at all what they stood for no to those men that that form the Constitution that wrote those things the way it was clear was playing it was they could see clearly what they want to accomplish but in this world of darkness it's become so confused that you know people can look at that and say oh what a blessing that is that's not a blessing in the eyes of God that's absolute wickedness to mix all of those things together and say God accept you any way that you want to come your families used to be so strong and God put those things in place God put a mother and a father together to raise a family because there was stability in that there were strengthened that just from even a natural perspective they were strengthened that but you know the world has has so twisted that has broken the unity of that you know your even your name your last name you would follow you from your parents who you know it came from their grandpa you know from from their grandparents to their parents to them now to you to your children it would pass on and give an identification of where you came from and where you belong you know now you go through a school and you know this kids got one last name but his sibling has a different last name and the mother has a different last name and the stepdad has a different last name and you know they're always on vacation because they're going to dad's one week and mom's the other week and you know they're not quite sure who's looking after them this time and you know they have a different house that they stay at be able to it's such a confusion no wonder there's no stability in that no wonder people are looking for you know something to identify with because there's no strength in where they come from there's no stability there's no identification to point you and say this is where I belong no sense of identification it doesn't give you that sense of belonging and strength you know the more that you have a stable home that's United around the Word of God the more content and satisfied your children will be in that home because they know what it represents they know what it stands for and they have an attachment to it but the more confuse it is the more disrupted it is the more the more a darkness there is there the more mix of God and worldliness there is the less and less it and so kids look for a different place to identify themselves they look for a different group to satisfy that sense of belonging and so you know the kids from the most broken homes are usually the ones that end up with the wildest manifestation of that why because they're just desiring so much to belong to something and there's nothing for them to belong they they don't see it anywhere they can turn so they find it in school they find it in you know their their friends they find it in movies and entertainment they find it in the rock star you know there's a reason that they want to grow up and be just like that rock star because it looks like they can belong they can identify with something they can recognize something the darkness of this world that just makes so many things confusing that's why we see such a great rise in homosexuality you know it fills every part of the world now music and movies and the news and local news and and national news and all over the places everywhere you go everything you could you know be reading it about the score of a hockey game and they'll be right on that same page a reference of some athlete that you had to go and you know express to the world you know their wickedness and and it's just everywhere you go in the most you know unlikely places in this school so I don't know back home they have what are the canonical gay and lesbian alliance in the school you know so that the kids who don't have an identity the kids that don't have an identification can have a group that will support them you know and will give them a sense of belonging why does it come from because people have lost their identification they've lost their identification in the Word of God in their family and everything else is so broken down you know it used to be they only talked about gay rights then it's gay and lesbian right then it's gay lesbian and bisexual rights and transgender and this they just add more and more things to it all the time why because it's more and more confused all the time you know I I had noticed in in articles that they were calling it LGBTQ and it just added another letter on there so I went looked it up and and Q stands for Janee I thought isn't that doesn't that just capture it though questioning confused you know that's that's the the lack of identification in this world it makes everyone question you know people don't have anything to identify so they begin questioning you know naturally speaking we see that definitely but spiritually speaking we see the same thing people are questioning you know Who am I where do I belong where do I fit in what you know what identification do I have and it's very confused you know it's it's it's so mixed up to them they're you know and they're going to ask you know what's right and instead of saying well this is what's right you know they ask their parents well you know what's right okay well you know just be who you are just be however you want to be you know that that's the response they're looking for a direction but the direction is just well you know whatever you feel you know what whatever you whatever you think you know will support you you know if your if your two-year-old boy wants to wear dresses and you know you know grow his hair long you curl it for him and you braid it for me no that's that's perversion and yet that's the reality of the world looks at that and says oh isn't that wonderful they support his little decision to you know to identify himself in a way that he's comfortable but it's perverse it's darkness but it comes from a lack of identification where is the parent to say you're a boy God made you a boy and you act like a boy you know you know these are the characteristics you were born with and this is this is what God made you this is what you are you know you're a girl you know this is the characteristics God made you with you know you'll act like that you'll conduct yourself like that but parents that would stand for you know stand against the school system because they don't provide you know then access to the washrooms of the gender that that child doesn't even belong to at home - you know I'd heard about it in the States before but even at home there was one you know a boy that that identified as a girl and they this the parents were pressing the school to allow that boy to use girls washrooms because he identified as a you know and the school responded by letting him use a washroom that was just a single person washroom say hey he can go to the washroom he can you know we're not going to prevent him from go to the washroom we'll let him use this washroom here and it's all by himself no that wasn't good enough parents pulled the child out of school and everything because they weren't supporting his right to identify himself as a girl it shows you how perverted and twisted this world is it doesn't make any sense at all it doesn't even make common sense but that's just how twisted and bent this world really is you know it's so dysfunctional you know we need to be careful though because that same kind of confusion that same kind of questioning can come right right into the church where you know the Word of God gets a questioned and the end and you know doubted and and you know the things that people want stood for is not all that's not so important anymore you know well I know you're coming to church I know the pastor preaches that and I know there's a quote for and I know there's Bible for it but you know I don't really feel like you know that identify with that you know in my house we're gonna do it this way instead you know in my house you know it's okay for us to do this it's okay for us to you know just not to pay close attention to that part of the work what is it's questioning its doubt it's the same kind of confusion of identification that we see in the world the character of God's being changed by preachers you know by preachers but you know I'm brother have talked about the indictment you know you talked about crucifying Jesus again he didn't put that on the on the lady didn't put that on the people that were sitting in the pews he put it on the preacher for changing the Word of God for for changing the image of Christ into something else to please the people and that's what we've done you know what what preachers have done they say Jesus loves you no matter what you know he'll bless your sinful lifestyle he'll bless your gay marriage he'll give place to your worldly desires you know churches that have the name of Jesus Christ right in their title and yet they have identification in Christ at all you know what Church of Christ and there's no price there but writing the message even you know people aren't sure if their identification comes from their family or the church or their pastor or brother branham or Jesus not sure they're not they're not sure where their identification really comes from you know and where there's a confusion of identification there's also dysfunction in the church because if your identification comes from family you'll put that ahead of God you know when when the word comes down and speaks about your child when the word comes down speaks about your wife your husband say oh well I won't let it go that far you know I'll listen when it's about the brother sitting next to me or the sister sitting next to me or that one in that pew oh it's really important but when it comes to my family I'm just gonna let them go you know I'm just gonna say it's okay I'm just gonna you know don't touch my family why it's putting that in front of God because that's what people think it is you know we see that so much the world even is bent that way family family family family family is very important but God is more important you know the sweet Jesus that you know loves everybody and you know just brings a smile to everyone's face that jesus said that if you if you don't hate your father and mother and your children then you're not worthy to follow him and then he wasn't saying hate your children hit your your parents he was saying that if you don't put him first if you aren't willing to forsake all others to follow him you're not worthy of him so you know the kids events to get in the way of church you know the kids priorities to get in the way of serving God you know activities that take away all the devotion time and all of those things if that's interfering with the word of God shows you your identification is wrong you've made your identification your family instead of Christ you know if your church is your identification you know no matter what turn and and twist the church takes you'll go right along with it you know you whatever the church said well everybody in the church is on you know this one in the church is doing that and this one's in the church doing that I guess it's okay for me that's if your identification comes from the church but that's not the way Jesus told us to live make your calling and election sure don't make brother so-and-so is calling election sure well I just trust in him or I just trust in that sister because she's just sweet and you know loving she just has such a good attitude I'm just gonna follow her you know in the way she does it know there's an identification with Christ my brother doesn't go won't hinder me the little songs that you know my sister doesn't go won't hinder me sure it hurts us you know it it can bother us it can give us conflict but if our identifications really in Christ we're not gonna be confused by those things we're all both at that brother Lyceus family do that that sister does that this one does that well our eyes focused on Christ we won't have that problem if your identification comes from your pastor or another minister you'll hold to them instead of to God you'll have confidence only as long as they lift you up and even if your identification comes from brother Branham you know a lot of message believers think that's all you need I just believe in a prophet what Oh what do you believe I just believe God sent prophet I believe in the message all of that but yet your strength your power doesn't come from brother branham's vindication you're not overcoming daughter or son of God because seven angels met brother Branham though that's wonderful and it was a vindication of his ministry though the pillar of fire was taking a picture of brother Branham when I run into trouble when I'm in conflict when I need string I need the pillar of fire in my life you know it's wonderful that it hung over brother Branham it's wonderful if it hangs over any one of you but but it needs to be in my life it needs to be hanging in my heart that's where the pillar of fire needs to be in order to have strength and so I'm thankful and pleased to say that I belong to this message I'm thankful and and grateful to God that there was a ministry of brother Branham but I realized in my own life my life has to be identified in Christ I don't have strength because brother Brown gave life back to a fish that's a wonderful thing for that fish but I have strength God gave life to me and we love that God doesn't look at our sin that he looks at the blood we you know maybe you guys sing that song he wasn't looking at me when he took me in he was looking at the blood but he also doesn't regard your family he doesn't look at you and say oh well you come from good stock so you know that you know I'll just bless and leave you and everything else cuz your last name is such and so you know I know in this in this church there's a lot of coffees well guess what you know just because your last name's coffee doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything before God unless you have an identification in him you know am i back where I'm from there's a lot of Kiser's or family member it it doesn't do a thing before God because that's my last thing what what matters before God is if my life is identified it identified in here you know he doesn't look at your church oh you go to this church well I'll praise the Lord you're one of mine because you you go to evening light fellowship here you you know that that's you know you're blessed then because of that no you're not blessed because of that you're blessed if you're found in him you know this is or your pastor is you know this is who your prophet is there's no none of those things matter to God he's not looking at your sin but he's also not looking at your family he's not looking at your church he's not looking at who your pastor is he's looking at you and do you have an attribute of God in you that's being expressed you know the perversion of this world has created a society where you can change your identification that will a man can decide as I mentioned a little bit before that he actually identifies as a woman you know Amanda that's crazy the census sounds it sounds almost funny to me but it's sad because it's happening is that you know I could come up before you say well you know my name is Ben Brandon for the last 35 years but you know I actually got you know his identity and Mia I'd like you all to start referring to me as Brenda you know or I'd like you all to start referring to me as brandy you know and you know please you know respect that and you know everything else and I start wearing I was gonna start wearing dresses to church and start you know growing my hair out a little bit and you know and I start doing those things you know I started doing this it sounds ridiculous to the mind but this world's created such a condition that instead of reproaching those that would do something so ridiculous their approaches on you for standing against it their approaches on you if you won't call a man who is dressed as a woman with you know taking drugs to to manifest those things that the world will reproach you for not calling him her you know not referring to he eyes she they'll approach you and yet that's the perversion you know that that's how mixed up the situation is is that they would look at the one that's confused the one that whose identity is is all confused and mixed up and they would actually put that reproach on you for not recognizing and supporting it what a what a confused dark time you know you might have heard here as more on the west coast but there was a a woman who is the the local leader of the n-double a-c-p group in in a black rights group in the US and she had risen to the ranks of the leader of that local chapter and and it came out that she was actually not black at all she she was completely white she had no no genetics in her from any black races she was as white as I am and but sheet and her skin super ten and she got hair extensions and things and had her hair done in a way you know and and she called herself a mixed-race and everything and there wasn't a bit not a single bit of black genetics in her at all and so she had risen to a place where she was a leader where she was recognized as you know sort of a champion of a black rights and it just seemed like such a mixed up thing you know there was outrage of course when people when people heard about it like you know they'll be like that'd be like saying that you know the the leader of the Jews is is a German or you know they say that you know that like it did it seemed to make you know it didn't seem to make any sense at all but there was the same kind of representation her as there was for transgender or you know anything else there was people writing articles saying well if that's how she identifies herself if she identifies herself as a black person you know we should have we should respect that you know because in her heart that's what she really is what a mixed-up world we're in what a twisted world were in where where the characteristics and the qualities of your actual body your actual genetics and then by a choice you could just say no I actually am somebody entirely different you know come up before you actually you know I'm a you know pleased to be a black woman here this evening and you know just like it's just so ridiculous and yet that it's but what it is it's an indication of the darkness on this world and you know in the world it seems so extreme but in the church it can be so much more subtle you know people are choosing to make themselves Christians choosing to call themselves after the name of Christ and yet their actual characteristics don't match that at all you know right from a little child we're taught to identify things by their qualities you know this is a dog it's got four legs got tail it's kind of shaggy fur barks you know that that's what makes it a dog this is a cat because it makes a different sound it moves differently it's got different characteristic a different type of fur it's got different type of behavior that's what makes it different it's got different qualities you know you know they have different genetics different ways of acting but this world is telling us that no matter what your physical characteristics are you can choose to be whatever you identify yourself at and people do that exact same thing with God in fact whether Bram says even in 1963 he said we rock now after 2,000 years friends we're closing now after 2,000 years man is determined to have his way he's made himself a charter he made himself man-made ethic and what did he do there has become by it a great falling away from the truth the people don't know what to do that sounds exactly what Jesus said you know people don't know what where they're going they don't know what they're doing in darkness you said they'll take this part of it but won't take that part of it they don't follow the Charter therefore they lose the course and after all these years when we got nine hundred and something different organizations of Christianity and each one condemning the other and saying this is right and they're wrong and this is right and that's wrong and so forth and the poor people are so confused they don't know what is right and wrong that's an incredible thing by them I was saying that in 1963 when people were a lot more identified by their characteristics than they are today you know brother Brown pointed to over 900 denominations in this time you know one place I was looking through trying to find the references to it in one place he says 969 but most other places he just says that it's you know in the nine hundreds or it's over nine hundred that seems like a lot 900 different ways of looking at the scripture that sounds like an awful lot except that I looked up how many there are today simple google search you know how many denominations are there well there's lots of different numbers floating out there but as high as 38 that was in different denomination from 900 which sounded like a lot you know and and detailed information on 9000 there was 9,000 different detailed differences and denominations that's one website had a list uh you know what does that tell us it tells us that people are choosing to identify themselves as Christians by their own definition you know they're Christians they'll tell you with all their heart they're Christians they're saved they're born again they're all of these things and yet it's completely by their own definition you know I'm a Christian absolutely full but I don't believe this and they don't believe that and I don't believe this part of the world I don't believe that well we don't really believe baptism that way and we don't really believe Holy Spirit that way and we don't really receive you know we don't believe this we don't believe that but I'm a Christian absolutely why it's it's choosing an identity for themselves that fits their own choices living however they see fit and slapping whatever label they most desire on their lives and right in the message people are doing that as well you know people choose churches that fit the kind of identity they want for themselves you know this is the kind of church that I want to go to because you know they preach it more more the way that I believe it why is it the way that the Bible teaches or is it the way that you believe it is it the way that the Word of God is preached or oh you know or is it just that they let you get away with more do they let you live a life however you want to live and still call you a message believer you know what what kind of identification are you truly trying to make you know I'm all for people changing churches as long as whether they're going is because they truly believe that God's gonna lead them and guide their life to be in His image if you're leading to any other image if you're leading to any other identification then then stay away from it you know stay where you are stay where God can leave you and and preach the word to your soul you know it's perfectly acceptable in society to do that and it's it's perverting the minds of Christians because God still after all about thirty eight thousand denomination however many different flavors of the message god still only has one provided place of worship in Christ and he still only has one provided way that's coming through his word you know and so beyond any any way that you want to say it it's still not your up it's not up to you to identify God still has an identification and it's by his word you know if you read the book of Judges there's a phrase that they repeat a couple times in there and it captures it perfectly it says that the people did what was right in their own eyes it's when Moses had already come and laid out all the law Joshua had already led them into the Promised Land to place them and give them their inheritance all of those things and after that when those men were gone off the scene people went however that was right in their own eyes the word was already given the temple has already been established there was a there was a right way of worship there was a right way of truth and yet people just kept falling into that same condition whatever was right in their own eyes if you read through the book of Judges you'll find some pretty strange stuff in there you know stuff that doesn't belong at all with the word that Moses had laid out now there's a guy did it that went and got himself his own Levite to be a priest and set up an idol in his home so the same man as a Levite and an idol and made his own religion you know and and you know the Bible lays it out there that you know he he's got this and you know how he set it up and he was worshiping and I'm sure he felt very holy and very spiritual and everything because he went and got himself a preacher he went and got himself an idol you know and now he's got the best of both worlds he's got a religion you know that he's made for himself that's exactly to his liking but it was completely ungodly you know and that's the truth of it on the end no matter you can go and get yourself whatever Idol you want you can go get yourself whatever pastor you want that you know that fits your desires and does the Saints you can go you know and include however much of the world you want in to satisfy your desire but if it's not the Word of God in the end you know the people that that worship Bale that had the showdown with Elijah you know they were just as sincere as alive to us they were just as committed they cried out all day long for bail to hear them you know they cut themselves they did everything that they could they poured out their lives of blood you know to hear from their God but there was still only one God that answered with fire and it was according to the right order and word that Elijah had set up proverbs chapter 12 verse 15 says the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but even hearkened unto counsel is why you know no matter what you believe I'm sure you believe it cuz you think it's right but but the wisdom comes from hearing the Word of God and recognizing and examining the bowels of the examine yourself Bible says prove what's acceptable make your calling and election sure why because you need to take what you've heard you take what you hear in the word and then you examine and you check it against your own life and when those two things don't match up you don't push off the word instead you change your life and you cut off the things that are not of God until only the things of God remain that's that's how we receive the word that's how we really find truth but the way of a fool is right in his own eyes and if it's right in your eyes and you would never reject it I mean you never accept the Word of God that would change that that viewpoint like Jesus said of the Pharisees that they close their eyes so that they won't see you know they've they've turned it aside so that they don't have to deal with it you know if if we won't ever accept the Word of God to change us you know we'll just keep going on in that kind of condition and because we have a religious desire we think God's with us you know in the time that we live in and at least at home until recently the economy was born very well excuse me and people took a lot of confidence in it and people would look at their natural things the good job that they had that was well-paying and the house that they had in the vehicle they had and they would say I'm so grateful for God's blessings that's wonderful but their life is more worldly now than it's ever been their church attendance is dropping off they're too busy going at work and they're too busy you know going here and going there then is that really God's blessing it's not God's blessing if it makes you live a life other than the Word of God if it makes you if it makes you live a life that's worldly then I don't think that's God's blessing I I would look at it as the devil's trap if it if that's the case people think that God will simply accept their worship and life however they choose to give it your God will just got it God needs your praise so much then no matter how you give it to him you will take it what do you want you only take it according to his word in fact you know people that if you're not walking in the light of the word if you're not walking with an identification with Christ then there isn't even there isn't even blood for your sins John says here first John chapter one it says this then is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin if we walk in the leg not if we walk in the light as we choose to walk in the light but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have that identification then we have the blood of Jesus Christ covering our sins then we had a fellowship with the same you know people always want more unity well get get your life identified in Christ and there'll be more unity with like-minded people there'll be more unity with other people who have received in the Christ the same way you've received it you know we would all pre engine and deny that we would except Satanist teaching we were to fight against a sea oh brother no I would never do that but one of the one of the fundamental teachings of Satanism is do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law in other words do whatever you feel like doing but you know do whatever is right in your own eyes that's all that really matters that's that's Satanist teaching and yet people will do whatever is right in their own eyes and still call themselves Christian still do whatever is right in their eyes and call themselves a believer but only and anyone that steps over the boundaries of the word and proclaims they are still serving God are only deceiving themselves God's not surprised by that God's not confused by that God recognizes that and he won't identify himself with our ideas or our chosen lifestyle he only identifies himself with his word you know when it really comes down to it it only matters if he identifies you not if you identify him but if he identifies you you know and one of the most important teachings to me that brother Brown said in order for us is on adoption and when we think about this thought here of identification it I believe it becomes really clear why that's so important because you know the way that the the world's adoption work is that you know if you wanted to adopt somebody you would take somebody who doesn't have any of your genetics who doesn't have any of your traits might not be the same color skin might not you know come from the same part of the world might not come any of those things and you legally include them in your family and you say that this you know I could say if I was adopted child today say this is now a kisser but doesn't have any of the characteristics than any other catches have but this is now a cancer this this is an adoption now it's part of this family that if that was the way that God worked then he would have to accept anybody in any condition because he would have to accept you know the person that lives a sinful life and who you know just lives any way that they want to and then come to church and and raise their hands and worship he would have to accept that because he would have he would have made a way that people that were not his people that didn't have any of his qualities or his characteristics could come then and be accepted be part of God's family they're so important for us to understand that that's not the way that the adoption of God works the adoption of God doesn't work the way he you need to take somebody who doesn't belong who was never in his mind and makes them one of his sons or daughter no it only works that he takes those that were already in his mind before the foundation of the world those that were already part of him those that already had an attribute of him and he brings them to a state of maturity and then he puts his adoption on them to say they are just like me they are to a place where their character their life their all of their thinking in their their will has all been molded to my character that's my child that that's in the image in maturity and in power exactly the same as I am you know God is not God is not taking someone without spiritual genetics he's only taking those that were a part of him from the beginning that's the correct Bible teaching it doesn't work that way in order to be adopted by God you had to be part of him from the beginning adoption is a recognition you've come to a place where God has confidence in you you come to a place that God can say you know as brother Branham said you know his name on the checkbooks as good as mine you know you come to a place where you can say he would do it just exactly the way that I would do it she would do it exactly the way I would do it like Jesus said I do nothing about what the father shows me first that's the way that every son and daughter of come should come that's what full adoption is and we know of course the body changes included in that before this flesh will manifested as well but Paul says here when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are son not because you claim to be son not because you'd like to be son not because it would be nice to be sums but because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father because you are a son of God because you are our daughter of God that's why God lets you walk in the light that's why God pulls those attributes out of you as you come and you feed on the word of God it's work it's because we're part of God in the first place that God puts his spirit in earth that God identifies us as his own and it's by maturing in our place as sons and daughters of God that we that were really recognized as fully adopted sons and daughters you know I've seen that firsthand the effective adoption the way that the world works and no matter what you can't you can't avoid this the adopted children and the natural children are never on the same never on the same level you know in the way the world works with natural adoption is that you know the adopted child is never the same as a blood child you just can't help because it's not the same genetics it's not the same life and then you know adoptive child might do really well and you know I have had lots of success but when they look at that blood child they see the same qualities that are them and there's an identification there that isn't there when you attach your name to somebody that doesn't have your genetics you know and that's the same with God people can call themselves Christian they can choose to define that however they want but when God looks at that he doesn't see anything that pleases him he only but when he looks at a life that's his he says oh I just that's just the same as me that's just the same quality the same characteristics the same life being expressed right there but the brown says needed the identified masterpiece of God says Jesus couldn't take the place talking about your place you remember when they read that in that day in the book in the temple when Jesus read the scripture he said he just read part of the prophecy left the rest of it for the last day we're supposed to take that part so you see he wants to cut the church out just like he did the Sun out like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not part of the Creed that's the belief system not part of the church not part of the denomination but the part of him hewed out of any other kind of a form won't work you've got to be hewed from the word the world cut off of you and just leave the world word rather only live in you the great sculptor is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ is the identified masterpiece of the Word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the masterpiece for the bride but I said now brethren God had a masterpiece then to present the world now he wants a masterpiece today are you willing are you ready my Christian friend are you really sure that your life is so reflecting for Christ no matter what the world says they say you lost your mind you've gone crazy you went and joined that bunch of holy rollers don't you pay no attention to that if you're not really truly saved and in that body and the Word of God in you and reflecting itself and the life of Christ reflecting out of you mother sister don't you take that chance I don't care what you are what kind of experiences you have let that word reflect through you each day because God in the last days is taking a bride for his son Jesus Christ then he says let us bow our heads and he prays here he says dear Heavenly Father such a crude way before an intelligent bunch of people my education is insufficient Lord I pray the Great Holy Spirit will sink these words into the people's heart that they will see what I mean if they couldn't understand in my way of chopping up things Lord but in my heart I see what you're trying to do I believe follow the bride must be part of the bridegroom she must be the same as the bridegroom for she is part of him she can never never be his bride until she becomes part of him that's a part of the word today and he says that says he's the same yesterday today and forever the corn of wheat that once that lived once in the earth and fell to the ground raised up in the likeness of the grain and went into the ground and Lord on the day of Pentecost there came a great church forth there came another grain of wheat to be made a bride groom and a bride for the last day hallelujah can you see your identification in that Paul says to the Ephesians he says for you are sometimes darkness but now are you light in the Lord as you said before now walk as children of light you know you're made light now walk as children of light say for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord when you walk in the light you're actually proving what's acceptable to the Lord you know when you stand-in in the power of the Word of God and you live your life according to the scripture and then what the the word has taught us you're actually proving to this world what's acceptable to God you know and if we if God doesn't have a light shining forth and he really can't even judge this world because he has nothing to compare it to but when he can raise up a bride we can raise up of people that had the same characteristics as him that stay within the borders of his word and he said and people say I didn't know that's what you wanted and he could say but I shone a light before you in the life of this person in the life of this sister the life of this brother I shown a life before you and you love darkness rather than light because I proved to you what was acceptable to the Lord I sent my own children I sent myself right there to show you and Paul continues on here and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame to even speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light Paul saying the same thing that that is it rise and shine your lights come you know wake up you wake up receive that resurrection life and shine forth as the children of the light that's what manifests light and dark that's what manifests good and evil is when the children of God walk as walk in the light your life proves what pleases God your fruit will be holy ghost' fruit your life will stand as both a testimony and as a judgment you know if you found your identification then awakened Christ will give you light if you haven't found your identification if you're still in that state of confusion whether rap says don't take that chance don't rest until you found that for yourself do what Peter says just as we finish up here he says for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind blind is like being in darkness you can't see you don't have any frame of reference to go by he says and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall only fall 5 times a week you show to only fall every once in a while I says you shall never fall you shall never fall and I don't believe he's just talking about the flesh there you you know do these things and you'll never make another mistake nobody's saying you can't fall because you're identified in Christ you you can't fall because Jesus can't fall you can't fall because the God Himself can't fall and if you have an identification in him your flesh might make mistakes you you're gonna have to get down on your knees and repent sometimes you know maybe every every hour brother be prayed up you know not every day but every hour maybe every hour you've got to repent over something but that that life of Christ that's in you can never fall if these things are in you and abound no Jesus told the disciples you know he had sent them out and given them power to cast out devils and to you know heal the sick and all those things and they came back having a real rejoicing time because you know they found that oh man what happened you know oh well I went out today and I know this person was sick and I prayed for them and they were healed and you know what happened with you well I wind this person was possessed with the devil and I prayed for them and they were delivered and they were all rejoicing about that but Jesus didn't say oh yeah rejoice you know over the miracle no he said don't rejoice because the devil is over with you we're choice because your name is written in heaven because that's the important thing you know God God doesn't even care about the the the works per se except that you're identified in him when he looks at you he sees himself in action when he looks at your life he sees that's that's the same life the same power the same character and I will put mine my word behind that I'll put my authority behind that if you're identified in Christ you can't help but overcome you can't help but stand for Christ and you can't be lost you can't fall I think it's so important you know that we recognize that identification that we have in the Word of God you know not not just that you belong to this church your names on the church directory you know you're you're part of you know everybody knows your name and and there's an old some TV show you want to go where everybody knows your name but that's that's not what you know that's not what brings us identification because people know who we are they you know know know what family we came from but if there's anything that we know is that we're a part of God from the very beginning and that will shape everything that we do you know when we go out and the job we'll act just like Christ because that's our identification you know when we when we go out in the world we're you know we're not gonna be turned to the left of the right because we know where we come from we know where we belong and what it is to walk as a child level a man but stand tonight thank you for your kindness our heads Lord Jesus Oh father I just crave Lord to see more of these things become reality in our lives Lord Father I don't doubt that we've heard them time and time again we've read the quotes ourselves we maybe read these scriptures many times Lord but this is not about somebody else and what they did there's a fulfillment left for us of those things Lord there's a fulfillment left for your bride arise and shine for your latest come arise awake and walk as children of the light load that's for us and so father we don't want to just take it and and find interest in it to find stimulation and it lowered to our minds but father if we truly recognize where we've come from and what we're a part of Lorna and what you've already committed to us Lord Oh father how we'd walk differently how we come to church differently Lord how we'd see everything differently father and so I pray for Lord a reality of this word to sink into our hearts in a greater way Lord I pray you'd bless the people here Lord may you give them strength and encouragement Lord as we go through these services this weekend load not just to have said that we did them Lord but may we find strength in the old me we find encouragement and a challenge law to to walk closer to you than ever before Lord Lord I don't want to just keep going day by day going through my routine but lord I want lower not to just be looking for your coming but I want to receive your coming Lord I I want you to be here Lord and I want to go and Lord I want to go in the rapture I want to have a change body but lord I believe there's just a greater urgency coming and I pray you just help us to grab in Jesus name we pray trying to think of a song to sing or the drill comes up ancient word let's let's zoom that again they resound with God's own heart it says you know just you can't separate it if it resounds in God's own heart is it resounding in our heart tonight Holy Word [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] nopal says in one place that he travails for the people until Christ be formed and formed in there not till they come to a knowledge of the doctrine that he was preaching or you know that they would come to understand what he's talking about come to understand what Jesus did until Christ was formed in there because when crisis formed in them then it's gonna grow it's a life of itself it's this power of itself and so that's how it is our Word of God change us mold us be formed in a [Music] [Music] a man thank the Lord for the word and God bless our brother Brandon believe it is the word of the Lord for this hour and we need the word for this out a man that we might be truly honestly sincerely as he ministered on walking in the light and not just walk in it but be the like a man it's not is not enough to just to walk in it is and say yea I have said concerning you oh you gotta believe the message I said well so does the devil he believes that mean even though and he got faith did you know that Satan had given Satan the faith that he knows his time is short a man that has come down with a great ride well that ought to give the bright faith to know that her time is shorter she's going up see a man he's coming down but we're going up by the grace of God a man so let that light shine in us by the grace of Almighty God and let us be found walking in the light and reflecting that light amen that time is sure and you'll go out and you will live like it and you'll act like it you're not gonna be putting the emphasis on the things of the world is putting emphasis on and you know acting and living as if they think they're gonna be here for another you know twenty thirty forty fifty a on till I'm 80 odd years old 90 years old and so on no live expecting the change of our bodies anytime by the grace of God a man so we think the Lord it is the truth Jesus said he are the light of the world a man he said I am the light of the world but it turns around says here the light of the world that's amazing I pray God drive that dead revelation down into our hearts tonight through what we have heard Minister tonight a man word onward onward on amen you can't leave one word out because if you do you're going to dim the light so don't leave this I would tell me that I you dim the light that don't have this and don't have that because next thing you're you're stuck tip the lights there because they're gonna cover this and cover that a man and I brothers left left it clear tonight concerning the light who is like what is the light where is the light what is God looking for ye are the light of the world right here do people want to know what the word is all about people want to know you know what what this word is doing and what God has done is doing will do for this word well he's reflecting it mean you and me it's so like it's shining for by the grace of God amen and just a couple of comments like I won't keep you long concerning walking in the light and we have to display the light publicly in all circumstances and situations a man because they're going to be challenged over there to do what's contrary to the world that's right again let me remind you of the time by the grace of God when when I was challenged and I was working over there in that department store and I was part of the management and in and that lady came in and she was looking for an article that she had returned and they had told her that they were going to send it back to the manufacturer get a replace and give it to her and she came back to me looking for it I didn't know anything about it so I went to others and they said oh that was suppose that I've been sent back but we still got it on the inside and tell her that we're still waiting to hear from them the manufacturers that we've got a setback they wanted me to tell her a lie and again that that brother that brother that individual is in management and I said listen if you want to tell a lie you tell her I said I'm not going to tell it and he said who are you working for I said I'm working for her I said not for you and so on so I assumed that he went and told the lie because I wasn't going to do it amen so where are you you've got you've got to let the light shine and display the light oh my god I saw who you are what you are I don't care if they're the Prime Minister of Canada I don't care if it's the President of the United States God requires the link hey man thank God for the Prime Minister of Canada taking his stand for Israel hey man I don't know whether or not his rough scripts are into it but maybe somewhere in the end then on the inside of the inside somewhere that's why he's defending Israel that's why he's taking his stand for Israel as well Israel as as has told the world that could to Canada because of their standing for us amen so it's you gotta let the light shine not be ashamed of it being the new thing is going to cost you your job you do it for Jesus sake because the hour is coming when you're going to be challenged you're going to be challenged will you believe this will you believe this and what did you do we can't argue when you allow this we allow that if you do if you want then we can tire you and I believe there was a store one time there in the air in the city a certain management a manager and I think he lost his job why because there came in a young man with ear rings in his ears and he wanted a job and he said well if you want to work here you got to take those earrings out and he any and he went to the government and he complained to the government I can't remember the department but the department you know that looks after the civil rights and all these things because they young man felt that he had a right to work anywhere and it wasn't anybody's business that he had earrings in his ears and anyway so after a while I went back and the management was gone and I maybe I believe that young man was hired why see that man it's true to his stain he didn't believe that maybe at a Christian stand but you gotta let the light shine even if it cost you your job amen Christ they tell his life can we lay down our jobs can we lay down our families and our friends he for shook at all then he may redeem us and we've got as I said I said we couldn't afford to purchase salvation but can we afford to possess it a man does a place I couldn't pay for for salvation it comes to purchasing it from the devil all the Crites could do that because he was born without sin but he imputed that that righteousness to me so I could possess it amen so can you afford to possess it because you're gonna lay aside every weight and every sin that a little section and run with paces the racist said before you by the grace of Almighty God you gotta make your calling and election sure you're gonna sacrifice any everybody and our brother brought it out and if you don't hate my mom dead son daughter or husband worried for my sake he says you're not worthy a man you gotta take up your cross and follow me amen we their brother were either the light or the darkness one or the other God is God looking for us to be the light of the world look what Jesus was now we're we're we're making our calling election sure we're fighting this place sure I'm not daddy you're gonna make your mistakes our brother brought it out and stumble here and stumble there and like I said it won't but if you're if you're an elective God and one interfere with your relationship they're still son and daughter and father and I interrupt your fellowship and repentance restores that again amen they gotta be got an advocate with the father praise the name of the Lord so we have my grace and I pray God help us tonight hearing what we have heard help us to walk in the light not occasionally continually amen as he is in the light and display it in all circumstances and in all situations amen no matter what it's going to cost you remember millions are gonna steal their testimony with their blood in the tribulation but God for the elect Minh for the bride as imputed his righteousness to us a man because he knows is alike this is going to walk in it and they're going to reflect the light now not judge no not reflecting because the Bible says what is the this is the moon shall shine as the Sun now it's reflecting Milady's the Sun but the hour comes when the moon shines as the Sun because the light that's in the Sun is going to be in the moon and the light that was in a straight brother he did it talking he talked about it right there cuz surely you know the first of the latter hey man hey man the Alpha and the Omega praise the name of the Lord good praise the name of the Lord let's recognize he I recognize who he was he knew who he was do you know who you were and he asked what he could do whatever principle hallelujah praise the Lord that's that's way that's why the pilot of Gaza that's why he said I can lay my life down and I'll pick it up again no man takes it from me why is it because he knew who he was and he where he come from he didn't lose his memory like us but the Holy Ghost give us our memory back amen and now is alpha as the Omega rather that we know where we come from we know where we're going hallelujah we're on our way home by the grace of God let's believe it as Jesus believe it les million is a that the faith of the latter be read be the same as the faith of the first by the grace of God going for spiritual Redemption on to physical Redemption even under the kingdom of God eternal brother brother BAM said just heard him on a tape last few days they said brother round you don't really you don't really want the world I envy him he was preaching this your brother brother branham that don't make sense you mean to tell me you want you want all this to finish now and and in now and he said I certainly do what he said surely you he says you you would like to go on a little bit further no he said I don't want him want any further but he said but he said most of the people of the world want the word of the law and they just want God to get him ready to die we want to get rid of them hallelujah just sing he had to deal with that and said he way back in 1961 Rebecca in the 60s god help us on this list again let's give all we got let's dedicate everything we have to Jesus the will of God not my will Will's not worth nothing physically the devil is in it but the will of God amen that we walk in the light amen but there's so little light I thought of that when our brother was ministry there's so little like listen seriously there'll be so little light that the Bible says that God would have the time short part we no flesh say the Papa said there'd be no one here for the rapture he said of God never cut time short one cut time short but for the elects sake he saw I'll cut it short Wow because the light of the world is going out is getting darker and we're going into the eternal light by grace thank God for the revelation of the late to something else seems who mentioned and I'm glad he mentioned it it's a confirmation I want to say but Babel was the Lord it's a confirmation of what's been preached over this board many times but God will send somebody else and let you know it's not me it's him it wasn't brother Brandon it was Jesus Christ that spoke to you tonight we talked about the black woman and a white woman representing the black race I remember some years ago that there was a white woman that wanted to know what racism was like so she became black what she did I don't know it might be the same woman I don't know but she went out and of course and if she's still alive she's black today because of what she did so that she might identify with the black people and and so on now she now she knows or she knew what racism was like and because she went and became one of them but not in the sense that our brother was talking about that other black woman but you know hallelujah this would also tighten not that black woman she was pretending that Satan coming down in the Garden of Eden has Satan Judas the Satan into Judas Tyrians and pretended brother's around the message but this woman came to change their car to identify with our black brothers and sisters her black race and Jesus came down in flesh to identify with you and me and in all points he was tempted as you and I what doesn't he deserve all you got sure he does it was a sacrifice for our brother Brandon to do what he did in the last couple of days and every to get to Newfoundland anyway you need to find it again no finally he gets lost in the fog and so on so but I brought our brother and he found it a man now he's on the rock god bless your brother but I want those leave you with a scripture that our brother read it's a real revelation that's good right praise the Lord for the word first John chapter one and he read verse five six and seven did you get the revelation this then is the message this then is the message when I brother read it I spy I underline those three or four words four or five words this is the message which we have heard of him it wasn't William Branham for Jesus Christ and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if you're born again you have no darkness in your soul it's in your flesh not in your soul if if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk that again is to walk willfully Bible says you know then I believe I did believe did not sin but they do not sin willfully God changed that your new birth he took the will to sin out and he brought in the Holy Ghost to give you the power and the anointing to know what seeing isn't to fight it coming up to the spirit fighting it in the flesh until we're change but he said and we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness willfully in continuing we lie and do not the truth but notice verse 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light so he's not in that I'm there but he's in what you heard tonight you walk in that light as he's in them you walk in the light as he is in the light and notice what it produces if it doesn't produce this you're not walking in I don't care how much the person says I believe this and I believe that and I believe somebody this doctor of that doctor if this doesn't follow then you don't believe them in your head maybe but not in your heart but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another hey man the Holy Ghost in Christ the Holy Ghost in you and me we're one hey man let me say it again here we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another that's why we were there to fight there in the morning Pellissippi in that house amen and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all team they didn't put that first put that last because you gotta start walking in the light by faith then repent be baptized in his name you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and that puts you in the body that's redeemed so you got to start walking in the light then you're a fellowship him with the body identifying with the body you're not ashamed of of the body amen and because you're in the body part of the body the blood of Jesus Christ continually Friends of us from all see because we're walking in the light then we stumble because we keep on walking in the light and the blood continually cleanse it out from all see you want to judge yourself tonight by the word make your call the election short tonight by the word go back to the scripture that our brother gave us in first John chapter 1 verses 5 and 6 and 7 amen that is the characteristics of those who are walking in the light that's that's the way we do it by the grace of Almighty God amen god bless you and god bless our brother Brendan and pray the grace of God to be with him tomorrow amen pray for the service tomorrow at 6:30 is it 6:30 tomorrow evening god bless you let's sing it Jesus the light of the world all ye Saints of late

their Lord they don't want him as Lord let's believe it come confess them as your king of your life Jesus the later the world in the bells of Evan will ring Jesus the light of the world and we'll keep walking in the light the beautiful light amen and as we do it'll shine all around us not only shine around us it'll shine out of us by the grace of God and be in prayer again as I said for our brother
