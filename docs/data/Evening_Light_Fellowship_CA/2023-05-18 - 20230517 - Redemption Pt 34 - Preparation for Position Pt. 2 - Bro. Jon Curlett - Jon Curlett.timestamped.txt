[38:42] you were in the midst and so Lord we
[38:45] know you're here tonight
[38:46] not because we feel you
[38:48] because you said you'd be here Lord and
[38:51] we're trusting you more believing you

[39:35] Hebrews chapter 12. and small group I
[39:38] certainly appreciate my family at least
[39:39] moving up to fill up some of the pews
[39:41] here it's a it's a big church to have
[39:44] half the church here you know but but uh
[39:46] that's okay we've had far less
[39:49] amen through covid we had four people
[39:52] and me preaching at one point there and
[39:54] brother Gerald had to go through the
[39:55] same thing so this is still an upgrade a
[39:58] big upgrade amen
[40:00] ch1 here this evening
[40:02] Hebrews chapter 12 it's the favorite
[40:04] scripture for
[40:06] for believers
[40:08] we talk about chastising and chastening
[40:10] and everybody groans internally and says
[40:12] is this really what we're going to talk
[40:14] about tonight it is
[40:16] but we're going to talk about it from a
[40:17] from the right perspective hopefully and
[40:19] give us some encouragement tonight and
[40:21] help us to have some understanding in
[40:22] these things Hebrews chapter 12 and
[40:24] verse 5 says and ye have forgotten the
[40:26] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[40:28] unto children my son despise not thou
[40:31] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[40:33] when thou art rebuked of him
[40:35] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[40:38] and scourgeth every son whom he
[40:40] receiveth if ye endure chastening God
[40:43] dealer with dealeth with you as with
[40:45] sons for what son is he whom the father
[40:48] chasteneth not amen you can have your
[40:50] seats this evening may God bless his
[40:52] word
[40:52] men were continuing as you would imagine
[40:54] in a Redemption series and I want to
[40:56] take a second part on this idea of
[40:58] preparation for position and we're
[40:59] talking about adoption and we're going
[41:01] to be here for at least a few Services I
[41:03] I go and I write out my notes and it
[41:05] seems like the notes don't shrink at all
[41:07] because I keep adding as I'm as I'm
[41:09] studying and going through these things
[41:10] so this is this is really where the
[41:12] message is taking us that's what the
[41:14] message is all about is the
[41:15] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[41:17] of God it's it's about bringing us to
[41:19] our position in Christ to a real
[41:20] revelation of it of a reality of it in
[41:22] our life and so I think it's it's worth
[41:24] the time it meant for us to sit and
[41:26] dwell on the things that that'll take us
[41:28] to what we're supposed to be in this
[41:30] this life and I was talking to my wife
[41:32] about last service and and I did want to
[41:34] make a clarification you know I spoke
[41:36] about you know where I'm at in my
[41:38] professional life and how I had to go
[41:39] through high school and then I had to
[41:41] write tests there and then I had to go
[41:42] into University and then I had to write
[41:43] tests and then I came out of University
[41:45] and I had to write another big test and
[41:47] then when I passed that three years
[41:48] later I had to write another big test
[41:50] and then when that was done I was
[41:51] finally it I was a profession National
[41:53] engineer in the United States in Canada
[41:55] and I was fully graduated and accredited
[41:57] and I was saying you know I've I've
[41:58] arrived
[41:59] but then I brought that to to my role in
[42:01] the ministry and one thing I don't want
[42:03] you to think is that I've somehow
[42:05] arrived
[42:06] if you think that I have arrived if you
[42:09] think that I've arrived you just need to
[42:10] see the first week I had as Pastor I
[42:13] mean it's it's not that I've arrived or
[42:14] or anything and or or any of that amen I
[42:18] I where I am today and standing here
[42:20] today is because I have passed some
[42:21] tests and I've gone through some of the
[42:24] courses that God has laid out for my
[42:25] life but believe me it's there's a lot
[42:27] more tests ahead and they've hit from
[42:29] the very beginning and I've got to grow
[42:31] in those things and and as you can
[42:33] imagine pastoring's not a job you can
[42:35] actually prepare for Beyond a certain
[42:37] point you know as assistant pastor you
[42:39] you get involved in situations and you
[42:41] try and sort things out and you're you
[42:43] know you help a bit here and you help a
[42:45] bit there but you don't have the full
[42:46] weight of responsibility you don't have
[42:48] the full weight of of the leadership
[42:50] that you have to take you don't have the
[42:52] full weight of a preaching schedule the
[42:53] way that I do now you don't have people
[42:55] looking to you the same way it's very
[42:57] much a support role before this and so
[42:59] now now I'm sitting here or standing
[43:01] here and I'm pastoring people that are
[43:02] older than me people that are are
[43:04] further ahead in their walk to meet
[43:06] people that have had a more experienced
[43:08] Pastor for so long so believe me I'm
[43:10] very very aware of these things and and
[43:13] I understand what it's like to sit and
[43:15] listen to somebody that that is is
[43:16] younger than you and these different
[43:18] things so so I'm not saying I've arrived
[43:20] by any by any stretch of the imagination
[43:22] I I think if I would say this the work
[43:25] has only just begun amen I said it
[43:27] before I'll say it again I I have made
[43:30] mistakes I will make mistakes he's still
[43:32] working on me as Joel Hemphill said he's
[43:34] still working on me to make me what I
[43:36] ought to be and it's a process and so
[43:38] all I I say all that to say this keep me
[43:40] in prayer amen I'm not up here thinking
[43:43] that I've somehow got it all figured out
[43:45] and and so you keep me in prayer and you
[43:47] ask God to help me amen and if you feel
[43:49] that brother John needs to come up a
[43:51] step higher than pray that God will take
[43:52] brother John a step higher because I can
[43:54] only go as high as he takes me amen I
[43:56] can't pretend if there's one thing I've
[43:57] learned in all of this you can't pretend
[43:59] you can can't be something you're not
[44:00] and if you do then God will knock your
[44:02] pins out from under you so fast it'll
[44:04] make your head spin amen but if you'll
[44:06] wait on him and you'll trust in him and
[44:07] you'll dwell on him and you'll meditate
[44:08] on the things of God and these things
[44:10] and then he'll he'll do the work amen
[44:13] because I'm only here as a as a
[44:14] microphone I'm Not The Shepherd of your
[44:16] souls amen he is The Shepherd of your
[44:18] souls and so pray for me because my my
[44:21] desire is to preach a living word that
[44:22] brings a living faith and then the
[44:24] scripture says that Faith cometh by
[44:26] hearing and so what I want to do is
[44:28] preach a word that gives you faith not
[44:30] just a faith but the faith amen the
[44:33] faith of God that's that's what my goal
[44:35] is in all of this for sure so
[44:37] just trusting I I think everyone
[44:39] understood that but I thought I'd make
[44:41] that clarification this evening just to
[44:42] just to say you keep me in prayer
[44:44] because I've got a lot of growing and a
[44:46] lot of stretching and a lot of
[44:47] uncomfortableness to go through in these
[44:49] things amen now I opened up in in
[44:51] Hebrews chapter 12 and like I said we
[44:54] kind of just collectively grown whenever
[44:55] a minister opens up and he talks about
[44:57] chastenings and trials and these
[44:58] different things I remember when I was
[45:00] younger and I came here for special
[45:01] meetings and this was my opening
[45:03] scripture and and again you just look at
[45:05] the people's faces and they say we
[45:06] brought a minister from three or four
[45:08] thousand kilometers away and he's going
[45:10] to preach to us about chastenings you
[45:12] know praise the lord we don't we don't
[45:13] say that we don't feel that because most
[45:16] of us have gone through chastings and I
[45:18] believe we all have if you're a child of
[45:19] God if you're uh then you've gone
[45:21] through these different things but the
[45:24] point with all of this and I think that
[45:25] Paul is saying is you can't graduate
[45:27] unless you go to school and you can't
[45:29] finish you've got to finish your courses
[45:30] you've got to get through the tough
[45:31] times you got to get through exam week
[45:33] you've got to get through the tests in
[45:34] order to graduate and and God knows how
[45:37] to prepare people and then God knows how
[45:39] to get us ready for these things and as
[45:41] I was dwelling on these things it
[45:42] brought me to the idea you know we have
[45:43] these things called prep schools and
[45:46] what is it what does that prep short for
[45:48] it's short for Preparation and they're
[45:50] usually private schools and they have
[45:51] the best teachers and the best tutors
[45:53] and the best programs and the best
[45:55] equipment and you pay a fortune to go
[45:56] there and really rich people send their
[45:58] kids there to get them ready for the
[46:00] life that's ahead of them and guess what
[46:01] US US normal people don't get to go to
[46:03] prep schools because we don't have the
[46:05] money but I want to say that God has got
[46:07] a prep school for his children amen and
[46:09] it's a very exclusive School
[46:11] everyone can come but it's only his
[46:13] children that stick it out it's only his
[46:15] children that go all the way through to
[46:17] graduation these things and in those
[46:19] prep schools they push them harder than
[46:20] anywhere else you go to public school
[46:22] they'll let things skate they'll let
[46:24] things go but you go to a real prep
[46:25] school where you're paying you know a
[46:27] hundred thousand dollars a year in some
[46:28] of these places a hundred thousand
[46:30] dollars per kid to go to a prep school
[46:31] believe me they don't let things skid
[46:33] they don't let things slide they're
[46:34] teaching you the best way they possibly
[46:36] know how to brother Branham talks about
[46:38] this and he says our heavenly father
[46:41] he says I thank thee tonight because
[46:43] that we're living in the hour of
[46:46] preparation
[46:47] now here today in the hour of
[46:50] preparation we're living when you're
[46:52] preparing the people to believe all
[46:54] things we believe that's the message of
[46:56] the day the preparation time Jesus
[46:59] Christ the same yesterday today and
[47:01] forever he says and you're calling a
[47:03] people you have give them the Holy Ghost
[47:06] Past Tense
[47:07] you say brother John I've got the Holy
[47:09] Ghost good look what comes next
[47:12] you have given them the Holy Ghost and
[47:14] now present tense you're trying to call
[47:17] out that group of people that group of
[47:20] sons to adopt them future tense so it's
[47:23] a present work with a future goal of
[47:26] something you've already received and
[47:27] that's the Holy Spirit he says and we
[47:29] realize that the Old Law was that his
[47:31] son was born into the home he was a son
[47:34] but the Tudor raised him and then when
[47:36] he was of age if he'd been the right
[47:38] kind of son he was taken out they put a
[47:40] purple robe on in the ceremony and he
[47:42] was adopted he says and that's what
[47:45] you're trying to do to these Full Gospel
[47:47] people now
[47:49] listen to this he says to get them out
[47:51] to themselves somewhere
[47:54] where
[47:55] so you got to come out of something but
[47:57] where is he going to take you into he
[47:59] says I want to get you alone with you in
[48:01] faith to do what to adopt them into the
[48:05] kingdom
[48:06] and give them the right to go forth and
[48:10] to do the things that you did so he
[48:12] spoke last service so that the holy
[48:14] spirit is given first and foremost as a
[48:16] tutor or as a teacher and we've got to
[48:19] learn the first thing we've got to learn
[48:20] is to listen to the Holy Spirit
[48:23] that's the first thing you had to do and
[48:24] I think of you for anyone that's
[48:26] received a new birth or anyone that's
[48:28] got the Holy Ghost the first thing it
[48:30] did was bring you into obedience
[48:32] that's the first thing you've got to
[48:34] learn is obedience to the Holy Spirit
[48:35] and it will always point you back to the
[48:37] word always point you back to the word
[48:40] amen the first thing you've got to do is
[48:42] get it and then you've got to learn to
[48:43] listen to it and yield to it that's the
[48:46] path that God puts us on Amen the first
[48:48] thing we do is we listen to the word of
[48:49] God and we accept it by faith that's
[48:51] Acts 2 38 right we listen to what Peter
[48:54] said on the day of Pentecost and he said
[48:55] repent and we and we obey he says and
[48:59] what be baptized in the name of Jesus
[49:01] Christ for the remission of sins and so
[49:03] we go down into the water by faith and
[49:05] then he says after that you'll receive
[49:07] the Holy Ghost obedience takes us to
[49:09] that place but after that now you're a
[49:11] son but you're just a newborn baby a
[49:14] newborn baby can't inherit the Kingdom a
[49:16] newborn baby can't inherit what daddy is
[49:18] already prepared from so now there's a
[49:20] process that has to happen where you've
[49:21] got to grow and be taught and you've got
[49:23] to accept that training you've got to
[49:25] embrace that training and when you do
[49:27] that it takes you to the place now where
[49:29] you can step into Daddy's into Daddy's
[49:31] shoes and you can start to be a part of
[49:32] the Kingdom of God in the in the family
[49:34] business
[49:36] he says when a man is born into the body
[49:38] of the Lord Jesus and becomes the son of
[49:41] God
[49:42] the Son of God he says God has sought
[49:45] the heavens for the best tutor he knows
[49:47] of to put over his children and it's not
[49:49] a bishop but it was the Holy Spirit we
[49:52] think Bishop when we think Roman
[49:53] Catholic but there are Bishops in the
[49:55] scripture and that was the pastor
[49:57] so he's saying your your your actual
[50:00] tutor is not your pastor
[50:03] I'm here to facilitate I'm here to feed
[50:06] you the word but it's up to him to make
[50:08] it real to you it's up to him to bring
[50:10] it to you in a way that you can obey and
[50:13] produce what it's talking about he says
[50:15] it was the Holy Ghost and God put over
[50:17] his church to raise his church to do
[50:20] what to believe in spiritual things and
[50:24] the supernatural workings of God brother
[50:26] Mark was sharing with me some things
[50:27] that brother Jason Watkins was preaching
[50:29] on and he points here that it's a
[50:31] balanced approach that if we go too far
[50:33] into Doctrine
[50:35] it doesn't produce but if we go too far
[50:38] into signs and wonders that won't
[50:40] produce either they had signs and
[50:42] wonders in Azusa and where did it take
[50:44] them
[50:45] the Azusa Revival took them right into
[50:47] denomination and guess what science or
[50:49] or the Mysteries and these things have
[50:51] absolutely taken message churches into
[50:53] denomination and you look at those
[50:55] churches today and they are almost
[50:56] exclusively devoid of young people and
[50:59] it's all older people and those churches
[51:00] will die off in the next 20 years
[51:02] because there's no New Birth because
[51:04] it's cold and starchy but you look at
[51:06] ones that seek after signs and wonders
[51:08] and the thing is there's nothing that
[51:09] grounds them there's no skeleton there's
[51:11] no framework and so what happens is
[51:13] people get into an emotional high and
[51:15] when they lose that they lose the
[51:16] victory
[51:17] so it's two sides and neither one is
[51:19] right but if you've got that approach
[51:21] through the middle which is stay with
[51:22] the word and take the left the left and
[51:25] the right take it all together then
[51:27] you're going to get the results but we
[51:29] don't seek the left we don't seek the
[51:30] right we stay in the middle and say God
[51:32] will add to the church daily such as
[51:34] they're needed people signs wonders
[51:37] Mysteries gifts all of these different
[51:38] things right amen what are we seeking
[51:41] we're seeking The Life of Christ and
[51:43] everything else follows everything
[51:45] follows the life of the True Believer it
[51:47] does not lead it it always has to follow
[51:49] these things that's why Hebrews 13 8
[51:51] brother Brandon would say that my
[51:53] message is to declare him that he's here
[51:55] here it was Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ
[51:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[52:00] that is the portion for the believer
[52:01] today that hasn't been had since the day
[52:04] since the book of Acts is a reflection
[52:06] of Christ the word completely in flesh
[52:09] that's what he's training us into that's
[52:11] what he's bringing us into amen the holy
[52:13] spirit's here to raise us up to a point
[52:15] where we will completely reflect Christ
[52:17] as a body as a body that's what this
[52:20] whole thing is going to look like but it
[52:22] takes what a full surrender a full
[52:24] surrender will bring us to what the full
[52:26] token it'll bring us to the fullness of
[52:28] God in our lives amen that's what brings
[52:30] us Supernatural is when the supernatural
[52:32] God has control over the natural
[52:35] more natural this body is natural but
[52:38] we're super we're supernatural creatures
[52:40] having a natural life having a natural
[52:42] experience but we're stepping into the
[52:44] Supernatural and it's a blending of two
[52:46] a blending of two Realms because we're
[52:49] stepping out of the natural and into the
[52:51] supernatural but as John said I must
[52:53] fade away and he must increase I must
[52:55] decrease he must increase what's
[52:56] happening is the natural is decreasing
[52:59] in our life and the spiritual is winding
[53:01] up and so what's going to happen is
[53:02] we're in this blending time this
[53:04] transition time and that's the most
[53:05] difficult time when you're not
[53:07] completely one and you're not completely
[53:08] the other but you're trying to break out
[53:10] of one and you've got these clings
[53:11] clingings and these hooks that are there
[53:13] that are trying to hold you back that's
[53:15] the toughest time as a student amen
[53:17] Jesus it didn't come easy to him
[53:20] a very familiar scripture it says though
[53:22] he were a son yet learned he obedience
[53:24] by the things which he suffered
[53:27] there's a revelation here at church
[53:28] because Jesus suffered
[53:31] yet he did not sin
[53:34] you say how is it possible that someone
[53:36] suffers under the learning hand of God
[53:38] and yet they did not sin
[53:40] that ought to tell you something that
[53:43] ought to tell you that if you're going
[53:44] through a tough time it's not always
[53:45] because you did something wrong
[53:48] sometimes we sit back and and the first
[53:50] inclination is to scour our life and to
[53:52] check our conscience and check our
[53:54] conscience against the word and that's
[53:55] the first thing a real child of God will
[53:57] do is is it me Lord
[53:59] that's what they said when Jesus was
[54:01] there in the upper room and and they
[54:03] said one of you is going to betray me
[54:04] and they said is it I
[54:06] then say Oh it's John John I knew John
[54:08] he's no they said is it I when issues
[54:12] arise our first instinct should be is it
[54:14] I is there something here in me that
[54:16] needs to be changed that needs to be
[54:17] checked that needs to be cut out that
[54:19] needs to be added in but if your
[54:21] conscience is okay then you got to say
[54:23] Lord this must be for your person
[54:26] and you've got to be able to go through
[54:27] it amen sometimes we suffer because we
[54:30] have to suffer to get the lesson not
[54:32] because we did something wrong
[54:34] now watch this here this is speaking of
[54:36] Jesus Christ it says and being made
[54:38] perfect
[54:39] we say he was born perfect no he wasn't
[54:41] born perfect he was born sinless
[54:44] he was born The Way We were supposed to
[54:46] be born but he was made perfect and it
[54:49] was a process because he learned
[54:52] and the scripture says he grew in
[54:54] stature and in wisdom in the eyes of God
[54:56] and Men
[54:58] Christ didn't start at a peak he started
[55:01] down here and he grew but what he did
[55:02] was he grew quick more quickly than any
[55:04] of us ever have but it says he and being
[55:06] made perfect he became the author of
[55:09] Eternal salvation unto all that that
[55:11] obey him he became the author
[55:14] his his purpose was to be the author of
[55:16] salvation but he became it
[55:19] he was drawn into it he was developed
[55:21] into it he matured into this
[55:24] he was born to do it but he was not it
[55:26] when he started he had to come into a
[55:28] place where he said where God said this
[55:31] is my beloved Son hear ye him and he had
[55:33] to step into his place of perfection
[55:36] IST thought now the prophet of God lays
[55:38] us out he says what do you think of him
[55:41] whose son is he why in birth he was
[55:44] wonderful remember scripture says he's
[55:46] wonderful counselor he says in his birth
[55:48] do you believe it in his birth he was
[55:50] wonderful in wisdom there was never a
[55:53] man that spoke like this man do you
[55:54] believe that but he says in sacrifice he
[55:58] was perfect
[55:59] in sacrifice he was perfect in death he
[56:03] was a redeemer so you see that his
[56:05] actions are tied to his state they're
[56:07] tied to his identification it says when
[56:10] he rose he proved that he was God
[56:12] hallelujah that's right he said he was
[56:14] when he was here on Earth he said he was
[56:17] God he looked like God he acts like God
[56:21] he preached like God he rose like God he
[56:25] was God
[56:26] he says hallelujah Emmanuel unveiled in
[56:29] flesh walking among men he was God
[56:32] Emmanuel he fulfilled the father he
[56:34] thrilled the hearts of The Poets and
[56:36] great men down Through the Ages he says
[56:39] and every man that ever amounted to a
[56:41] hill of beans was somebody who put their
[56:43] trust in him as the son of God
[56:47] but look at what he says there in
[56:49] sacrifice he was perfect he was made
[56:52] perfect when he sacrificed his total
[56:55] will to God
[56:57] that is where he reached his peak of
[56:59] perfection was when he was fully
[57:02] surrendered amen and within that
[57:04] surrender he looked like God he acted
[57:07] like God and then he died and we say how
[57:09] could that be God but then he rose again
[57:11] and it proved that it was God all along
[57:14] but in full surrender was when he was
[57:16] made perfect remember this as we move
[57:19] forward because remember Christ was the
[57:21] first of many Brethren the firstborn of
[57:23] many Brethren so the process that he
[57:25] goes through is the process that the
[57:26] many Brethren are going to go through
[57:28] but also the revealing of him is going
[57:30] to be the same way and it's in stages
[57:32] it's in processes it's in times it's in
[57:35] ages it's in sections and it's no
[57:37] different for the bride of Christ today
[57:39] he was God through and through but what
[57:41] was his time of perfection it was in
[57:44] sacrifice amen
[57:46] you would say it was when he healed the
[57:48] sick
[57:49] that's when he was perfect
[57:52] because that's what we would think
[57:54] because we're looking at the
[57:56] manifestation of the signs and wonders
[57:58] and Powers but before that he had to
[58:00] surrender and it was surrender all the
[58:03] way through
[58:04] he didn't just surrender what he was in
[58:06] in the Garden of Gethsemane but he
[58:08] surrendered all the way through like I
[58:10] said before he walked thousands of
[58:11] kilometers in his ministry and he didn't
[58:13] have a home I don't know if I don't know
[58:16] if I read it I heard somebody else
[58:17] saying it but but he said the scripture
[58:20] says he Sanctified himself for us
[58:23] I think brother Brown said along the
[58:25] lines of he could have had a wife he
[58:26] could have had a house he could have
[58:27] done all these things but he surrendered
[58:29] himself so completely because he was
[58:31] focused on fulfilling the word that was
[58:33] written about him and that is all he
[58:35] cared about and he surrendered himself
[58:37] to that he gave himself completely to
[58:39] that and that's where his Perfection was
[58:40] amen and then what he lays down his life
[58:43] and the greatest Victory he ever gets is
[58:46] after the greatest surrender he ever had
[58:49] the greatest surrender led to the
[58:52] greatest Victory nobody ever laid down
[58:54] their life and picked it up again some
[58:56] people lay down their life and God
[58:58] raised them up again but nobody laid
[59:00] down their life and picked it up again
[59:01] and his greatest Victory he had to
[59:03] surrender completely and Trust what was
[59:04] written about him before he went into
[59:06] that grave so you look at that and you
[59:08] say well that means I must surrender
[59:09] then I must I'm a sacrifice and we've
[59:11] all got a sacrifice but it's not going
[59:13] to necessarily be the life the way that
[59:15] he had to sacrifice it we're not going
[59:17] to have to go and lay our arms on a
[59:18] cross and and be crucified the way he
[59:20] was but the sacrifice has to be the same
[59:23] thing and the scripture says of him it
[59:24] says then said I lo I come in the volume
[59:28] of the book it's written of me to do thy
[59:31] will o God so Jesus Christ the man the
[59:34] human the body his purpose was to do the
[59:36] will of God and that's where his
[59:38] Perfection laid that's where his
[59:39] righteousness that's where God was
[59:41] displayed was when he stepped into the
[59:43] will of God
[59:45] his experience was completely
[59:47] surrendered to God everything about it
[59:49] was in God's hand and all he wanted to
[59:51] do was get into that Perfection of the
[59:53] word
[59:54] not adding to it and not taking away
[59:56] from it but letting God manifest himself
[59:58] through that human body
[1:00:00] but it's not just him
[1:00:02] the adoption of sons the manifestation
[1:00:04] of Sons and Daughters of God is Not Just
[1:00:06] For Christ we've got to see ourselves in
[1:00:08] these things and brother Branham says it
[1:00:10] this way he says now if you find your
[1:00:12] place sister
[1:00:16] not just brothers the scripture talks of
[1:00:18] the manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:00:20] brother Brandon would would focus on
[1:00:21] that at times and say well that's the
[1:00:23] ministry of the bride and he'd talk
[1:00:25] about men that are going to step into
[1:00:27] that Ministry but he says here now if
[1:00:29] you find your place sister
[1:00:32] sisters you're included in this there's
[1:00:34] an adoption for sisters
[1:00:37] you know the in the in the in the in the
[1:00:39] Old Testament they took women and they
[1:00:41] went from somebody that they were
[1:00:42] supposed to love and cherish and they
[1:00:44] took them and they turned them into
[1:00:45] chattel they turned them into property
[1:00:48] and then Paul comes along in the New
[1:00:49] Testament and he says there's neither
[1:00:51] male nor female neither Jew nor Greek
[1:00:53] neither Bond nor free says in Christ
[1:00:55] we're all the same thing and you see a
[1:00:57] prophet coming here and he's saying
[1:00:58] sisters don't forget you're a part of
[1:01:00] this you got a role to play you've got
[1:01:03] to be manifested Christ just as much as
[1:01:05] the men do not gotta be you're gonna be
[1:01:08] you're included in this
[1:01:10] he says now if you'll find your place
[1:01:12] sister don't let me hurt you or brother
[1:01:14] he says but you'll find your place in
[1:01:17] the word as a Christian
[1:01:19] not what the Creed said that's down here
[1:01:22] in this lower Cannon father that's going
[1:01:24] to be destroyed
[1:01:26] he says see you find your place as a
[1:01:28] Christian because your character is
[1:01:30] molded as Christ's you are Zoe the same
[1:01:34] as he was Zoe which is the life of God
[1:01:36] he says you're invited to come and take
[1:01:40] his character
[1:01:41] by having his character in you it molds
[1:01:44] you into the same mind that he was and
[1:01:46] his mind was always to do what the
[1:01:49] father had ordained him to do
[1:01:52] see we've got to follow what is ordained
[1:01:54] for us
[1:01:55] not to add to it and not to take away
[1:01:57] from it that's only a distraction and
[1:01:59] believe me Satan will try and add to it
[1:02:01] or he'll try and take away from it and
[1:02:03] get you to try and do something that the
[1:02:04] word doesn't say you're supposed to do
[1:02:06] he says his mind was always to do what
[1:02:08] the father had ordained him to do his
[1:02:11] mind was to stay with the father's word
[1:02:13] and the same mind that was in them was
[1:02:15] to be in us and if his mind is in us
[1:02:18] we'll do like he did and if his
[1:02:20] characters in us will be as he was so
[1:02:23] we'll do and will be
[1:02:26] amen it's not just works but the works
[1:02:29] have to be there but there's a being and
[1:02:31] that's the character that's the life
[1:02:32] that's the mind of Christ that's got to
[1:02:34] be us in the same way so Christ was made
[1:02:37] perfect and that means we've got to be
[1:02:38] made perfect Christ suffered so that
[1:02:41] means we've got to suffer and Christ
[1:02:43] endured so that means we've got to
[1:02:44] endure as well
[1:02:46] it's the exact same thing it's going to
[1:02:47] go the same way that it went through
[1:02:49] with him and so we opened in Hebrews 12
[1:02:51] and I'm going to start a bit earlier to
[1:02:52] take us through this it says wherefore
[1:02:55] seem we also are compassed about with so
[1:02:57] great a cloud of witnesses
[1:02:59] we've got a crowd of witnesses don't we
[1:03:01] and they're not just 2 000 years ago
[1:03:04] we've had a great witness in this age
[1:03:06] and a prophet but we've got witnesses
[1:03:08] and Elders in our midst and and
[1:03:10] Ministries and these different things of
[1:03:11] what this works the process works the
[1:03:14] word works if you'll stay with it
[1:03:17] that's the cloud of witnesses around us
[1:03:19] he says he says seeing that we're
[1:03:22] surrounded by this great cloud of
[1:03:23] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:03:26] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:03:28] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:03:31] that is set before us us voluntarily
[1:03:35] Paul is saying you lay it down don't
[1:03:37] wait for God to come over and start
[1:03:39] beating you over the backside to drop
[1:03:41] these things because Paul would say
[1:03:43] we've got a race to run and he said you
[1:03:44] did run well what did hinder you well I
[1:03:46] think sometimes what hinders us is that
[1:03:48] we've got too much on our back that
[1:03:49] we've been carrying
[1:03:51] and Paul says sometimes what it's going
[1:03:53] to be our habits it's going to be our
[1:03:55] relationships it's going to be our
[1:03:57] Tendencies sometimes it's going to be
[1:03:59] hurts and offenses and past experiences
[1:04:01] and memories and these different things
[1:04:02] family issues and whatnot Paul says Lay
[1:04:05] It All beside these things that keep
[1:04:07] tripping you up put it aside and just
[1:04:09] say I don't want it anymore and run with
[1:04:11] Christ
[1:04:13] because when if you're if you're ever in
[1:04:15] a long hike if you're ever traveling by
[1:04:17] foot I went sheep hunting many years ago
[1:04:20] in Alberta and the idea was to get every
[1:04:23] ounce out of that pack because when
[1:04:24] you're climbing eight and ten thousand
[1:04:26] feet every ounce counts
[1:04:30] and you're only carrying so much food
[1:04:31] and you only have so much water every
[1:04:34] little bit of sweat you put out every
[1:04:35] bit of energy that you put out is going
[1:04:37] to hurt you in the end so you've got to
[1:04:39] preserve your energy and so you reduce
[1:04:41] every bit of weight so you only take
[1:04:43] exactly what's necessary and nothing
[1:04:45] else
[1:04:46] Paul's saying that's the way you got to
[1:04:48] do this take everything that's
[1:04:49] unnecessary and shove it to the side and
[1:04:51] say I don't need to carry this on this
[1:04:53] journey
[1:04:54] and Satan's trying to pack it on pack it
[1:04:56] on pack it on brother Brandon would talk
[1:04:58] about he'd say we've got every modern
[1:04:59] convenience and yet we have no more time
[1:05:01] we've got less time than they did when
[1:05:03] they had none of it why because Satan's
[1:05:05] packing it on packing it on packing it
[1:05:06] on and we've got to be as quick to
[1:05:08] shovel it off as he is shoveling it on
[1:05:12] he says looking unto Jesus the author
[1:05:16] and finisher of our faith
[1:05:17] I'm reminded
[1:05:19] we choose what we look at
[1:05:22] we choose what we look at and if we're
[1:05:24] going to look at Christ we know we're
[1:05:25] going to we're going to see the right
[1:05:27] things and we're going to dwell on the
[1:05:28] right things but it reminds me of a
[1:05:30] serpent stare and apparently there was
[1:05:33] an experiment they did where they put a
[1:05:35] a snake they had a serpent they had a
[1:05:37] snake in a in a container and they put a
[1:05:39] finch in there with it
[1:05:41] and they know that the snake wanted the
[1:05:43] finch and the finch went in there and it
[1:05:45] just was fluttering all over and they
[1:05:47] had some branches over in the corner and
[1:05:49] it went up and it stayed there and it
[1:05:50] was just all a flutter and nervous
[1:05:52] and the snake never moved
[1:05:55] at all it just sat there quietly
[1:05:58] didn't move didn't blink nothing just
[1:06:00] sat there and that bird started staring
[1:06:03] at that that Finch started staring at
[1:06:04] that snake and it just got down bit by
[1:06:07] bit
[1:06:08] who's looking at the snake and something
[1:06:10] about that stair got a hold of it and it
[1:06:12] walked all the way over to that snake
[1:06:14] the snake opened its mouth and the bird
[1:06:16] walked into the snake
[1:06:19] they closed and he had it didn't have to
[1:06:22] do a bit of work
[1:06:23] why the bird got caught in the stair
[1:06:28] we choose what we stare at
[1:06:30] listen you stare at evil it'll suck you
[1:06:33] in all the way
[1:06:35] all the way and you won't even know
[1:06:36] what's happening until it's too late
[1:06:39] so what happened with Eve
[1:06:41] so what happened with Eve she got off
[1:06:42] just a little bit and he sucked her all
[1:06:44] the way in amen
[1:06:46] you look at troubles troubles compound
[1:06:49] the more you dwell on them the more you
[1:06:51] look at them the more you look at
[1:06:52] situations you're more that you dwell on
[1:06:54] the impossibility of the situation of of
[1:06:56] how this can't happen and this won't
[1:06:58] work and that won't work guess what it
[1:06:59] won't
[1:07:00] because that's where your faith is going
[1:07:01] to be it's not Faith anymore it's doubt
[1:07:03] it's it's the opposite of faith and it
[1:07:05] builds it up to the place where you
[1:07:06] can't overcome it and all of a sudden
[1:07:08] you've got a great weight
[1:07:09] that's holding you back and you can't
[1:07:11] move the way you're supposed to
[1:07:13] he says looking unto Jesus the author
[1:07:15] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:07:17] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:07:20] cross
[1:07:21] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:07:23] the right hand at the right hand of the
[1:07:26] Throne of God so Paul's pointing us to
[1:07:27] Christ he says look he endured he
[1:07:30] despised the shame he didn't dwell on
[1:07:31] the shame naked on the cross
[1:07:34] stripped bloody
[1:07:36] he despised a shame it wasn't even
[1:07:38] worthy of his attention he says and he
[1:07:40] endured and now he sat down at the
[1:07:42] Throne of God he was saying look at him
[1:07:44] to understand what he looked at and look
[1:07:46] at him to see what the roar roar was
[1:07:47] when he looked at the right thing when
[1:07:49] he dwelt on the right things
[1:07:51] he says for consider him that endured
[1:07:53] such contradiction of Sinners against
[1:07:55] himself lest ye be weary and faint in
[1:07:59] your minds now he's not saying you won't
[1:08:01] be weary and faint we're human we're
[1:08:03] going to be weary and faint
[1:08:06] but he's saying if you dwell on the
[1:08:07] weariness and faintness of it you're
[1:08:09] going to get into trouble he says look
[1:08:10] at Christ he's there to save the he's
[1:08:13] there to save the planet
[1:08:15] he's the hero he's the Messiah they've
[1:08:17] been looking for and the Very ones that
[1:08:19] he wanted to save that he was there to
[1:08:21] save were killing him
[1:08:24] he says and if you dwell on what the
[1:08:26] ones that you're trying to help are
[1:08:27] doing to you
[1:08:28] rather than the reason why you're doing
[1:08:30] it in the first place you're going to
[1:08:31] get into problems but he says he looked
[1:08:33] to the reward he was looking past the
[1:08:35] pain looking past the rejection and he
[1:08:37] was focused on what was coming he was
[1:08:39] looking on what the word said was going
[1:08:40] to happen because of this and that's
[1:08:42] where he dwelt on it and all of us got a
[1:08:45] reward because of it
[1:08:46] because what we were there we indicted
[1:08:49] him
[1:08:50] our sins were there we were there with
[1:08:52] that crowd saying crucify him crucify
[1:08:54] him crucify him our sins are what put
[1:08:56] them up there and yet while we were yet
[1:08:59] sinners God loved us amen and gave his
[1:09:01] life for us
[1:09:03] what's Paul saying he's saying put it in
[1:09:05] perspective
[1:09:06] put it in perspective and we're going to
[1:09:08] talk about about perspective in a little
[1:09:10] bit
[1:09:11] but he says ye have not right here there
[1:09:13] you go I always say that and it's right
[1:09:14] there he says you have not resisted on
[1:09:17] the blood striving against sin this
[1:09:19] struck me as I was studying it you know
[1:09:21] my sister Atlanta when the kids would
[1:09:23] come in and they'd say so and so did
[1:09:24] something to me or she'd say are you
[1:09:26] bleeding
[1:09:27] no
[1:09:28] then you're okay
[1:09:30] go away and Paul's saying are you
[1:09:32] bleeding because you've fought so hard
[1:09:34] have you resisted sin have you have you
[1:09:36] have you been so completely surrendered
[1:09:38] to your your walk with God that you're
[1:09:40] bleeding now
[1:09:42] Paul's saying come on guys
[1:09:44] we're not bleeding
[1:09:45] yes we're hurt yes we've been offended
[1:09:48] yes we've had tough times but he says
[1:09:50] we're not bleeding yet we're not
[1:09:52] bleeding in how hard we're fighting so
[1:09:54] he says come on let's put it in
[1:09:55] perspective what we're really going
[1:09:57] through Christ had his body completely
[1:09:59] mangled destroyed his face it was more
[1:10:01] Mara than any other man's he was he was
[1:10:03] wrecked in a way that nobody else
[1:10:05] Paul says compare that to where you're
[1:10:07] at
[1:10:08] and say is it really are we really in
[1:10:10] such a bad situation now
[1:10:14] reminds me of John I think it was John
[1:10:16] Wesley he didn't he didn't he pray so so
[1:10:19] long and so often that he had worn
[1:10:21] divots in the wooden floor by his bed
[1:10:23] and he would weep for so long that his
[1:10:25] eyes would be swelled shut and his wife
[1:10:26] had to lead him to the table to eat his
[1:10:29] meals
[1:10:30] that's commitment
[1:10:33] when's the last time we can say we did
[1:10:34] that that's the when's the last time I
[1:10:36] can say I did that
[1:10:37] that I I was in such fervent prayer that
[1:10:40] I was under such a burden for somebody
[1:10:43] that I would stay there until my eyes
[1:10:44] wouldn't open because of the weeping
[1:10:46] listen church we haven't resisted under
[1:10:48] blood amen there's a lot more we can do
[1:10:51] and in perspective I think we'll realize
[1:10:53] that it's not always as bad as we think
[1:10:54] it is
[1:10:55] he says ye have forgotten this is where
[1:10:57] we started you have forgotten the
[1:10:59] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[1:11:00] unto children my son despise not thou
[1:11:03] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[1:11:05] when thou art rebuked of him you know we
[1:11:06] especially uh with our children you you
[1:11:09] say something sharp to them they just
[1:11:10] kind of shrink away from us don't they
[1:11:13] now if it's warranted that's one thing
[1:11:15] but boy if you say it and it's not you
[1:11:17] know you're over the top with it they
[1:11:18] just wither before you don't they it's a
[1:11:21] horrible thing and we need to go and
[1:11:22] make those things right with them we
[1:11:23] need to apologize but he says listen
[1:11:24] don't faint when God rebukes you
[1:11:27] don't say oh my goodness
[1:11:29] this is so hard
[1:11:31] I can't take it anymore he says no no
[1:11:33] we're better than that we're stronger
[1:11:35] than that
[1:11:36] he says for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:11:39] chasteneth and scourgeth every song whom
[1:11:42] he receiveth that word receives there
[1:11:44] means to admit into the program to start
[1:11:47] on the training and learning program to
[1:11:49] set on the path towards adoption so this
[1:11:53] is for every one of us none of us get to
[1:11:54] escape this amen once he set us on the
[1:11:57] path we're going to have hard times
[1:11:58] we're going to have chastising we're
[1:12:00] going to have times where he speaks
[1:12:01] harshly to us where he speaks sharply to
[1:12:03] us where he's very corrective in a way
[1:12:05] that maybe we don't enjoy amen but the
[1:12:08] point has to come where our our flesh is
[1:12:11] second
[1:12:12] and our spirit says I want what the what
[1:12:14] he's got to give me
[1:12:16] we've got to enter into this willingly
[1:12:18] amen and we're willing to take the path
[1:12:19] to get the results it's like when we
[1:12:21] went into University I went in there and
[1:12:24] I endured the pain because when I got
[1:12:25] out I was going to have a degree and my
[1:12:27] life was better with a degree than
[1:12:28] without a degree I believed and that's
[1:12:30] why I went through the pain
[1:12:32] but we've got to have a revelation that
[1:12:33] what we're going through is leading to
[1:12:35] something that's better than what we'd
[1:12:37] have if we didn't do it
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:40] I mentioned this quote when I was here
[1:12:42] last time about Michelangelo and he says
[1:12:44] if people knew how hard I worked to get
[1:12:46] my Mastery it wouldn't seem so wonderful
[1:12:49] at all and you look at at these chapels
[1:12:50] here and the things that he painted and
[1:12:52] it took him years and years and years
[1:12:54] you know and and you've probably seen
[1:12:56] that the church had that old video there
[1:12:58] about him way back when I mean he fell
[1:12:59] off the scaffolding and got paint in his
[1:13:02] eye and you know his joints are all
[1:13:04] crippled up from holding the
[1:13:06] that's that's what it takes to become a
[1:13:08] master you know today they say it takes
[1:13:09] 10 000 hours of practice active practice
[1:13:12] and to to become a master
[1:13:15] have we put 10 000 hours into our walk
[1:13:17] with God
[1:13:18] have we put 10 000 hours into into
[1:13:20] learning and growing and and committing
[1:13:23] our energy to him
[1:13:25] ten thousand hours is what they say it
[1:13:26] takes today
[1:13:28] listen to this Paul says if you endure
[1:13:31] chastening
[1:13:32] if you endure it you've got to endure it
[1:13:35] you've got to stick with it you've got
[1:13:37] to stay with it you've got to decide
[1:13:38] you're in it for the long haul you've
[1:13:40] got to say I'm in this until I get the
[1:13:42] results he says if you endure chastening
[1:13:44] God dealing with you as with sons for
[1:13:47] what son is he whom the Father chasteth
[1:13:49] the flip side of that is if the
[1:13:51] chastening keeps going it's because
[1:13:53] you're a Son of God it's because you're
[1:13:54] a daughter of God because what happens
[1:13:55] is God will chase him and then somebody
[1:13:57] walks away and Paul says if you walk
[1:13:59] away it's in verse 8 he says if you be
[1:14:01] without chastisement whereof all our
[1:14:03] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:14:05] Sons so he says if God stops working
[1:14:07] with you that's a really bad thing
[1:14:09] because he only stops working with ones
[1:14:11] that aren't his children
[1:14:13] so he says if the chastening keeps going
[1:14:14] no matter what he says that's a good
[1:14:16] sign because it means God's still
[1:14:17] working with you because you are his son
[1:14:19] because you are his daughter
[1:14:22] I want to put you in perspective on this
[1:14:24] because like I said we look at this and
[1:14:26] we think it's about well I'm out of line
[1:14:27] and I did wrong or I'm not getting the
[1:14:29] lesson and sometimes it is sometimes
[1:14:31] that's what this is about but remember
[1:14:33] tests are difficult by Nature a test is
[1:14:36] supposed to be difficult I remember I
[1:14:38] did a I had to take electives when I was
[1:14:40] in university and one of them was uh
[1:14:43] oh man
[1:14:46] I forget
[1:14:48] that's how important it was
[1:14:50] anyways on my final exam
[1:14:53] you have to stay there for 45 minutes
[1:14:56] at the University when you're in a final
[1:14:57] exam you have to see stay in your seat
[1:14:59] for 45 minutes
[1:15:01] I was done that exam in under 20 minutes
[1:15:04] it was not a difficult exam and she did
[1:15:07] it for her sake not for my sake
[1:15:10] God doesn't do it that way God's tests
[1:15:12] are tough
[1:15:13] because he's trying to make sure you've
[1:15:14] learned the lesson so we're in a time
[1:15:17] and we've learned the truth and we've
[1:15:19] got the doctrine laid out and we know
[1:15:20] what we're supposed to do and then God
[1:15:22] gives us a test and the test is tough
[1:15:24] and sometimes it's because we've messed
[1:15:26] up sometimes it's because we haven't
[1:15:27] done the training we haven't done the
[1:15:29] study we haven't gone through the
[1:15:31] curriculum but other times it's because
[1:15:33] he wants to see what your attitude is
[1:15:34] going to be like
[1:15:36] because he's as interested in our
[1:15:38] attitude as he is in our actions
[1:15:40] because a bad attitude with the right
[1:15:42] action is still wrong
[1:15:44] so he's interested in in molding every
[1:15:46] part of us amen
[1:15:47] listen to this this this really did me
[1:15:50] good
[1:15:51] he said a brother met me today as I was
[1:15:53] going out and he said brother Branham he
[1:15:55] says financial troubles have burdened
[1:15:57] his heart he said after hearing about
[1:15:59] the poor people in India and so forth he
[1:16:01] said but yet every time said I've got
[1:16:04] good health and everything but he says
[1:16:06] but everything is always banging me down
[1:16:09] I said every son that cometh to God must
[1:16:12] be chastened of God he said every one we
[1:16:16] just have to be tried he said God's whip
[1:16:19] is laid on us seem like being innocent
[1:16:23] I didn't do anything wrong why am I
[1:16:25] getting a whipping why am I going
[1:16:27] through a tough time why is it so
[1:16:28] difficult I pay my tithes and yet I'm
[1:16:31] struggling financially I come to church
[1:16:33] and yet I'm struggling with my family
[1:16:34] you know we've Faithfully been here and
[1:16:37] now our kids are strong no no no
[1:16:39] he says it seems like you're innocent
[1:16:41] and yet the whipping is going on the
[1:16:43] hard times are going on catch us now he
[1:16:46] says God is doing that to prove that we
[1:16:49] are Sons
[1:16:51] not that you did something wrong not
[1:16:53] that you're out of the will of God not
[1:16:55] that you're you're you're hither and
[1:16:57] yawn all the time but he says it's
[1:16:58] proving that you're a Son of God the
[1:17:00] fact that you're being trained and
[1:17:02] tested and tried proves that you're a
[1:17:03] Son of God and your reaction now is
[1:17:05] going to prove whether you're a son or a
[1:17:07] daughter of God as well
[1:17:08] and he says those who cannot stand
[1:17:10] chastisement or illegitimate children or
[1:17:13] not true sons of God but that man or
[1:17:15] woman who can stand and take their
[1:17:17] whipping and everything going wrong
[1:17:20] everything going wrong have you ever had
[1:17:22] anything keep going wrong
[1:17:24] I've been there many many times and you
[1:17:26] say what is going on
[1:17:28] I've been faithful Lord I've been
[1:17:30] faithful I've been faithful I've been
[1:17:32] faithful and everything is going wrong
[1:17:35] listen to this he says everything's
[1:17:37] going wrong they'll still look up and
[1:17:40] say Lord I love you that's the one
[1:17:44] that's he that endureth to the end the
[1:17:46] same shall be saved he says now I love
[1:17:48] that don't you and knowing this that
[1:17:50] tribulation worketh patience and patient
[1:17:53] patience worketh hope and hope make it
[1:17:55] not a shame there you are see
[1:17:57] tribulation worketh patient be patient
[1:18:00] and hope maketh not ashamed we've got
[1:18:03] the hope tonight he says in all of our
[1:18:06] tribulations yet it works
[1:18:10] God knows how to what train a man
[1:18:13] God knows how to train a woman God knows
[1:18:16] how to bring us to where we're supposed
[1:18:18] to be he says in all of this getting a
[1:18:21] beating when you ought didn't do
[1:18:23] anything wrong he says and yet in all of
[1:18:24] this it works it gets the results it
[1:18:27] does the job amen he says tribulations
[1:18:30] make us patient waiting to the coming of
[1:18:33] the Lord
[1:18:34] what does it do it keeps us
[1:18:36] uncomfortable down here
[1:18:37] gets our eyes off of what's going on
[1:18:39] here and gets us to look towards a
[1:18:41] resurrection and a Rapture to look for a
[1:18:43] kingdom that in a city whose Builder a
[1:18:45] maker is God Amen that we don't get too
[1:18:47] tied down here sometimes he's making it
[1:18:49] uncomfortable just to get our eyes back
[1:18:51] to where they ought to be
[1:18:53] it reminded me of Joseph Joseph is the
[1:18:56] is the most perfect type of Christ that
[1:18:58] we have in the scripture I believe
[1:19:02] just absolutely a phenomenal young man
[1:19:05] and and yet he's born and he's born to
[1:19:08] be a provider he's born to be a
[1:19:10] deliverer of sorts and he's born with a
[1:19:12] gift he's born with a gift of Prophecy
[1:19:14] he's born with a gift of visions and
[1:19:15] dreams and these things and Joseph
[1:19:17] having done nothing wrong
[1:19:19] is hated
[1:19:21] is envied
[1:19:23] his brothers take them throw them down a
[1:19:25] well and then sell him into slavery
[1:19:27] Joseph having nothing done wrong now
[1:19:29] remember seemingly innocent he sold into
[1:19:33] slavery into Egypt
[1:19:35] he goes into Egypt and what about
[1:19:37] Joseph's attitude
[1:19:39] Joseph's attitude was wherever I am
[1:19:42] going to reflect the God that I serve
[1:19:45] and he wasn't bitter towards God he
[1:19:47] wasn't angry towards God he didn't
[1:19:49] Mumble and groan and complain and pout
[1:19:51] and go bury his head in his pillow no he
[1:19:54] served potiphar as he would serve God
[1:19:57] and God blessed him
[1:19:59] and then God let him get falsely accused
[1:20:01] and cast him into prison
[1:20:04] Church we're talking about the process
[1:20:06] of bringing you to the place where God
[1:20:07] wants you to be to bring you into what
[1:20:09] God has has for you in the future
[1:20:12] and then he puts him into prison and
[1:20:14] what's Joseph's attitude the same as
[1:20:16] always
[1:20:17] I'm going to serve God
[1:20:19] by doing my best here and pretty soon
[1:20:21] Joseph is running the prison and he's
[1:20:23] got his freedom within there he's doing
[1:20:25] the job for the prison Warden
[1:20:27] and then what happens he helps a baker
[1:20:30] and a butler and he says now when you go
[1:20:32] before Pharaoh you that's going to live
[1:20:34] you that's going to die you don't have
[1:20:35] to worry about it you that's going to
[1:20:36] live he says remember me remind Pharaoh
[1:20:38] about me tell him about me and that guy
[1:20:41] forgets all about Joseph
[1:20:42] so now Joseph has helped somebody he's
[1:20:44] done the right thing he's used his gift
[1:20:46] for their benefit and then they forget
[1:20:48] about him and he's still rotting away in
[1:20:50] jail
[1:20:51] church this is the Son of God being
[1:20:54] brought to the place of what God had in
[1:20:56] store for him and then after that after
[1:20:58] a while sitting there and waiting saying
[1:21:00] Lord you gave me the gift you used the
[1:21:02] gift for the benefit and now here I am
[1:21:05] still in jail all of a sudden work comes
[1:21:07] Pharaoh wants to talk to you
[1:21:09] and in an instant in an instant he goes
[1:21:12] from a slave in prison to second in the
[1:21:15] Kingdom where everything that he says
[1:21:18] goes
[1:21:19] he has pharaohs for Authority he has
[1:21:21] Pharaoh's full power he can write the
[1:21:23] checks he can empty he can fill he can
[1:21:25] take he can sell he can do all of these
[1:21:27] things in one instant
[1:21:30] but what did God do it all for because
[1:21:31] Joseph had to have the character to be
[1:21:34] able to handle that kind of power
[1:21:36] and Joseph really in a way is maybe a
[1:21:38] better type of the Bride because he was
[1:21:39] second in command
[1:21:41] he still answered to pharaoh and the
[1:21:43] bride still answers to Christ but she's
[1:21:45] got to have character
[1:21:47] to do
[1:21:48] what God has told her to do
[1:21:51] Joseph wasn't given all of this power
[1:21:52] just to go out and and amass a bunch of
[1:21:54] wealth for himself when he amassed
[1:21:56] wealth he said this is yours pharaoh
[1:21:59] because remember they got in there and
[1:22:00] they had all the years of plenty and
[1:22:02] everything was great but then as times
[1:22:03] got tougher and Joseph now is the only
[1:22:05] one that has the Grain and the corn
[1:22:07] people start coming to him and Joseph
[1:22:08] says well you can pay the money and they
[1:22:10] pay the money then they're out of money
[1:22:11] and Joseph says I'll take your land
[1:22:13] but he didn't take it for himself he
[1:22:15] gave it all the Pharaoh it's in
[1:22:16] Pharaoh's name it's in Pharaoh's name
[1:22:17] it's going back to the king it's going
[1:22:19] back to the Pharaoh because he's the one
[1:22:20] that I answer to
[1:22:22] what Joseph had character to not enrich
[1:22:24] himself with the gift
[1:22:25] but God put him through all of that
[1:22:27] completely innocent completely innocent
[1:22:30] and God put him through years decades of
[1:22:32] slavery and hard times and false
[1:22:35] imprisonment and people ripping his
[1:22:37] reputation apart
[1:22:38] all to prepare him for what God had in
[1:22:40] store for him amen
[1:22:43] Hebrews 12 continues and says
[1:22:45] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:22:47] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:22:49] them reverence shall we not much more
[1:22:51] rather be in subjection unto the father
[1:22:53] of spirits and live for they verily for
[1:22:56] a few days chastened us after their own
[1:22:58] pleasure
[1:22:59] sometimes we correct our kids because it
[1:23:01] makes our life easier
[1:23:03] that's not that's not godly correction
[1:23:05] Godly correction is for their good not
[1:23:07] for our good
[1:23:09] and so often our response is because we
[1:23:11] just want peace we just want quiet we
[1:23:13] just want cleanliness in the house we
[1:23:15] just want somebody to stop saying
[1:23:17] and what we're looking for our peace
[1:23:21] he says and yet we reverence our fathers
[1:23:23] and mothers we respect them we're glad
[1:23:25] for them he says but what about God
[1:23:27] because he does it for our Prophet that
[1:23:29] we might be partakers of what
[1:23:31] his Holiness this is getting deep now
[1:23:34] this is this is where we're getting to
[1:23:36] the root of these things because it's
[1:23:37] not just about appearances it's not just
[1:23:39] about good or bad or right and wrong but
[1:23:41] it's about being a partaker of God what
[1:23:44] does that partaker mean a take apart a
[1:23:47] taker apart
[1:23:48] it means you're going to be a part of
[1:23:50] his holiness
[1:23:53] you're not just coming under an umbrella
[1:23:55] now but you're going to be a partaker
[1:23:57] you're going to take part in
[1:23:58] representing God's holiness
[1:24:01] so that's what all this is for is to
[1:24:03] make you a part of his holiness
[1:24:05] amen this is about a people that are
[1:24:07] just going to be like Jesus Christ
[1:24:09] he says now no chastening for the
[1:24:11] present seemeth to be joyous if you're
[1:24:13] enjoying it it's not God
[1:24:16] no chastening he says when God does it
[1:24:18] nothing is enjoyable he says for the see
[1:24:21] it says but Grievous and it's like it's
[1:24:24] like exam week at University or School
[1:24:26] nobody likes it even the smart people
[1:24:28] don't like exam week because it's
[1:24:29] stressful because you have to go back
[1:24:30] and you have to dig deep and remember
[1:24:32] all those things that were three months
[1:24:34] ago or four months ago or six months ago
[1:24:36] or whatever it is and you're going
[1:24:37] through it and you're just trying to get
[1:24:38] through to the end he says that's what
[1:24:40] it is with God it's like an exam week
[1:24:42] It's just tough all the time there's
[1:24:44] nobody going to enjoy it he says
[1:24:46] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:24:48] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:24:50] them that are exercised thereby so the
[1:24:52] ones that go through it he says it
[1:24:53] produces a fruit
[1:24:55] the Amplified says for the time being no
[1:24:57] discipline brings Joy but seems Grievous
[1:24:59] and painful but afterwards it yields a
[1:25:02] Peaceable fruit of righteousness to
[1:25:03] those who have been trained by it it's a
[1:25:06] harvest of fruit which consists in
[1:25:08] righteousness in Conformity to God's
[1:25:10] Will and purpose
[1:25:12] thought and action that's why I said
[1:25:15] it's not just about doing the right
[1:25:16] thing it's about having the right motive
[1:25:18] it's about having the right objective
[1:25:19] it's about the right reaction to the
[1:25:21] action it's about having what the very
[1:25:23] thought of God in these things
[1:25:25] he says and it results in right living
[1:25:27] and right standing with God
[1:25:31] verse 12 says wherefore lift up the
[1:25:33] hands which hang down and the feeble
[1:25:36] knees the Amplified says so then brace
[1:25:37] up and reinvigorate and set right you're
[1:25:40] slackened and weakened and drooping
[1:25:42] hands and strengthen your feeble and
[1:25:44] poised and tottering needs now
[1:25:47] my knees and arms are pretty good but
[1:25:50] what's he saying
[1:25:54] I'm so weak
[1:25:55] I can't do this anymore
[1:25:58] and you're just staggering
[1:26:01] right he's saying straighten up
[1:26:04] Lift Your Hands Up
[1:26:06] lift your hands up worship and praise a
[1:26:09] little bit he's saying you do it
[1:26:11] he's not saying God does it he says you
[1:26:13] go do it he says come on pick yourself
[1:26:15] up by the bootstraps
[1:26:18] scripture says gird up your loins like a
[1:26:20] man
[1:26:21] come on be a real child of God show some
[1:26:23] gumption show some Spirit show that you
[1:26:25] really believe him show that you really
[1:26:27] trust them
[1:26:28] don't walk around like a sad puppy with
[1:26:30] a long face all the time amen
[1:26:33] we ought to be the most joyous people in
[1:26:35] the world
[1:26:37] because we've got a reason for when
[1:26:39] things are tough
[1:26:40] the fact that it's tough ought to be
[1:26:42] joyous to us because we know it's for a
[1:26:43] purpose and it's for our good other
[1:26:45] people go through it because they're
[1:26:46] dumb
[1:26:48] because they can't listen to the word of
[1:26:51] God because they can't accept the word
[1:26:52] of God because you're going to call them
[1:26:53] done it's not that they're dumb they're
[1:26:54] ignorant is a better word and so they're
[1:26:56] going through things and they go through
[1:26:57] things and they go through things and
[1:26:58] you have family cycles and you have
[1:27:00] church cycles and you you have
[1:27:01] relationship cycles and it's going and
[1:27:03] going and going why because they can
[1:27:05] never come to an understanding of the
[1:27:07] word or revelation of the word but we're
[1:27:08] going through it and we're going through
[1:27:10] it for our benefit that's why we can be
[1:27:12] joyous even in a time of trouble amen
[1:27:15] he says make straight pass sorry
[1:27:19] it says so then brace up reinvigorate
[1:27:21] set right you're slack and then weakened
[1:27:23] and drooping hands and strengthen your
[1:27:24] feeble and palsied and tottering knees
[1:27:28] he says and make straight paths for your
[1:27:30] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[1:27:32] out of the way but let it rather be
[1:27:34] healed and the Amplified says and cut
[1:27:36] through and make firm and plain and
[1:27:38] smooth straight past for your feet Yes
[1:27:40] make them safe and upright and happy
[1:27:42] happy pass that go in the right
[1:27:45] direction so that the lame and halting
[1:27:47] limbs may not be put out of joint but
[1:27:49] rather may be cured what is it that
[1:27:52] gives us these weak joints these loose
[1:27:53] joints if you ever walked in in the bush
[1:27:56] in Newfoundland in the woods it's tough
[1:27:59] to walk
[1:28:00] because there's brambles and there's
[1:28:02] dead trees all over the place and
[1:28:04] whatnot and you're on a path and it's
[1:28:05] got rocks everywhere it's Newfoundland
[1:28:07] we got rocks everywhere it's not a
[1:28:08] smooth past and you'll see it maybe with
[1:28:10] Samuel especially he's walking quickly
[1:28:12] and then just poop and he goes flat on
[1:28:14] his face
[1:28:15] why because it's not a straight path
[1:28:17] it's not a smooth path it's not a a
[1:28:19] ready-made path and so he struggles
[1:28:21] there because he thinks he you know we
[1:28:23] go down to the beach and we come down
[1:28:24] our road and it's paved and everything's
[1:28:26] smooth and then he comes over there and
[1:28:28] it's got dips and bumps and rocks and
[1:28:30] everything and all of a sudden just boom
[1:28:31] and he's literally flat on his face it's
[1:28:33] hilarious in a sad way
[1:28:36] but it's soft so he's always okay that's
[1:28:38] why it's funny
[1:28:39] but I'm always worried because what
[1:28:40] happens is he lands on the Soft Stuff
[1:28:43] see we make a wrong decision we trip up
[1:28:46] and we land okay and it's a small thing
[1:28:47] and we like well it's okay to make
[1:28:49] mistakes well then what happens is we go
[1:28:51] from the grassy top by the beach now to
[1:28:53] the downward slope where it's all dirt
[1:28:55] and then it goes to rock and when you
[1:28:58] fall on the beach you get hurt your
[1:29:00] knees get banged up your elbows get
[1:29:02] banged up your face gets banged up your
[1:29:03] teeth get knocked out
[1:29:05] and so he's got to learn how to walk in
[1:29:07] the rough stuff by going more slowly and
[1:29:10] more carefully
[1:29:11] and what Paul's saying here is he's
[1:29:12] saying you got a chance now you got a
[1:29:15] chance to make your path straight and
[1:29:16] smooth and easy to walk on and it's by
[1:29:18] the decisions you make
[1:29:20] every single day you make a decision is
[1:29:22] the path going to be smoother is the
[1:29:23] path going to be bumpy is it going to be
[1:29:25] crooked by our ins and outs and our ups
[1:29:27] and downs one day we're following the
[1:29:28] word of God the next day we're not one
[1:29:30] day it's a priority the next it's not
[1:29:32] what is it doing it's making your path
[1:29:33] bumpy and crooked and he says it takes
[1:29:36] an effect on your knees he says and now
[1:29:37] you can't walk straight and you start to
[1:29:39] totter and then you get pulled to the
[1:29:40] right and you get pulled to the left and
[1:29:42] you get pulled by a wind of Doctrine you
[1:29:43] get pulled by a Ministry or you get
[1:29:45] pulled by an influence or a habit that
[1:29:47] you thought you'd kick and all of a
[1:29:48] sudden you're all off the path
[1:29:51] he says you have a chance here you have
[1:29:52] a choice to decide what this is going to
[1:29:54] look like he's not trying to cut us down
[1:29:56] though
[1:29:58] Paul's trying to point us it'll be worth
[1:29:59] it it's worth it to do the hard work now
[1:30:03] you can make better time by building a
[1:30:05] good path up front and taking the time
[1:30:07] to do it rather than going and trying to
[1:30:09] fight your way through a messed up
[1:30:10] crooked path that's just going to take
[1:30:12] and sap your energy and you're going to
[1:30:13] get to the end of it and you're not
[1:30:14] going to even know where you are you'll
[1:30:15] be lost in the woods
[1:30:18] there's a benefit to doing it the right
[1:30:19] way amen
[1:30:21] yes God has a purpose in these different
[1:30:23] things but we've got choices to make all
[1:30:25] along the way and those choices decide
[1:30:27] whether we're making mistakes for our
[1:30:29] good
[1:30:30] or to be an example to others of what
[1:30:32] not to do
[1:30:33] because we're going to be an example one
[1:30:34] way or the other aren't we we're going
[1:30:36] to be an example for is it did they do
[1:30:38] right or did they do wrong I'd rather be
[1:30:40] the example for what to do right even if
[1:30:42] it looks hard amen Paul's talking about
[1:30:44] laying down those weights and what is it
[1:30:46] the habits of relationships
[1:30:47] entertainment the silly things that
[1:30:48] aren't going to help us I was talking to
[1:30:50] a couple today and that listen in
[1:30:53] occasionally and and I just shared some
[1:30:55] things that the Lord was doing with me
[1:30:56] and I said listen the things that are
[1:30:58] cut off that our weights are not always
[1:31:00] bad
[1:31:02] they just take up space
[1:31:05] they just take up time they just take up
[1:31:06] energy they're not bad in and of
[1:31:08] themselves but they take the place of
[1:31:10] something that's better
[1:31:11] and that's what I see God doing is he's
[1:31:13] sanctifying the life more and more and
[1:31:15] more because he's got to fit him in
[1:31:17] there and there's got to be less stuff
[1:31:18] to take up that room that he needs
[1:31:20] so that's what happens and and we'll get
[1:31:22] into it a little bit as we talk about
[1:31:23] the other things Paul said but what's
[1:31:25] the goal here
[1:31:26] what's the goal of making our our path
[1:31:28] straight and doing the harder work and
[1:31:29] making the the harder decisions today
[1:31:31] for the long-term goals
[1:31:33] what is it the goal is perfection
[1:31:36] but it's not Perfection of being without
[1:31:37] fault or mistake but Perfection is to be
[1:31:40] in the will of God that's what
[1:31:42] Perfection means is to be in the will of
[1:31:44] God is to be surrendered to the will of
[1:31:46] God and what is the prize he says to be
[1:31:48] partakers of his Holiness that's what
[1:31:50] the manifestation of the sons of God is
[1:31:52] it is to be a partaker of the very
[1:31:54] nature and express the very nature of
[1:31:56] God
[1:31:56] that's what the prize is for all of this
[1:31:58] but what's the cost the cost is to sit
[1:32:01] under the rigor the discipline of the
[1:32:03] Holy Spirit as your tutor
[1:32:04] and you've got to sign up for that and
[1:32:06] say I'm willing to do it I'm willing to
[1:32:07] go down that path Jesus had to go
[1:32:10] through it and we've got to go the exact
[1:32:11] same way watch how Jesus lines us up
[1:32:13] though he's talking to the disciples and
[1:32:15] he says I have yet many things to say
[1:32:17] unto you but you can't bear them now
[1:32:19] in other words he says you're not ready
[1:32:21] for it
[1:32:22] you're gonna be ready and there's a time
[1:32:24] and there's a season for you to be ready
[1:32:25] for but you're not ready for it now and
[1:32:28] sometimes that's the way it is with us
[1:32:29] is we're saying Lord I don't understand
[1:32:31] Lord I need more Lord I need more and
[1:32:33] he's just saying just keep walking
[1:32:35] I'll bring to you what you need when
[1:32:36] you're ready for it and when the time is
[1:32:38] ready for it amen sometimes he says
[1:32:40] you've got to wait because you can't
[1:32:41] handle it now that's what Jesus was
[1:32:43] literally saying to the disciples you
[1:32:45] can't handle what you're going to get
[1:32:46] now you're going to get it but you can't
[1:32:49] handle it now
[1:32:50] he says how be it when he the spirit of
[1:32:52] Truth has come he will guide you into
[1:32:54] all truth what is the identifier for the
[1:32:57] Holy Spirit truth truth always the truth
[1:33:00] why because it's the word of God
[1:33:04] the scripture says Thy word is a lamp
[1:33:06] unto my feet and a light unto my path
[1:33:07] amen it is always truth and God himself
[1:33:10] is truth the very nature of God is truth
[1:33:13] it's rightness Amen it doesn't lie it
[1:33:15] doesn't lead us to stray but I want you
[1:33:17] to realize your original position here
[1:33:19] this is for the Holy Ghost filled
[1:33:21] believer initially you will be outside
[1:33:24] of that truth
[1:33:26] you might have a bit of it you might
[1:33:28] have a head knowledge of it you might
[1:33:29] have some understanding of it but you
[1:33:31] won't have all of it because you need
[1:33:32] the holy spirit to guide you into it
[1:33:34] listen they've been around Jesus for
[1:33:36] three and a half years and he says I've
[1:33:37] got a lot to tell you you've heard a lot
[1:33:39] I've got a lot to tell you but
[1:33:41] something's got to happen in between now
[1:33:42] and then and it's got to be the holy
[1:33:44] spirit that comes into your life why he
[1:33:46] says you're standing in a state of
[1:33:47] partial knowledge of imperfect
[1:33:49] understanding and it's going to take the
[1:33:50] Holy Spirit to get you to truly
[1:33:52] understand and apply it the way you're
[1:33:53] supposed to
[1:33:55] he says for he shall not speak of
[1:33:57] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:33:59] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:34:02] things to come
[1:34:05] Jesus is talking to his disciples and
[1:34:07] their chosen men they're going to be the
[1:34:08] the pointy end of the spear they're the
[1:34:10] you know the the apostles they've got
[1:34:12] gates in that City that are that are
[1:34:14] named after them or representative of
[1:34:16] them and these different things they're
[1:34:18] the they're the the firstborn of the
[1:34:20] Next Generation Christ was the firstborn
[1:34:22] but these are the first of all of the
[1:34:24] new new children that are going to be
[1:34:25] born by the Holy Spirit and and Jesus is
[1:34:28] saying you got something
[1:34:29] and I've chosen you in your elect and
[1:34:31] you're predestinated and you've been
[1:34:33] given power in these different things he
[1:34:34] says but there's something else that's
[1:34:36] coming and you need that before you can
[1:34:38] go any further
[1:34:40] and everything is staged in in product
[1:34:42] development we have Gates and you've got
[1:34:43] to pass through one gate before you can
[1:34:45] get to the next stage and if you don't
[1:34:47] pass that gate if you don't meet the
[1:34:48] criteria if you don't meet the
[1:34:50] performance if you don't meet the
[1:34:52] specifications you can't go through that
[1:34:53] gate and go to the next phase and Jesus
[1:34:55] is saying you got to pass through a gate
[1:34:57] and that gate is the new birth it's the
[1:34:59] Holy Spirit and until you go through
[1:35:00] there we can't go any further in this
[1:35:03] he says to get where you're going you're
[1:35:04] going to need all truth and to get all
[1:35:06] truth you're going to need the Holy
[1:35:07] Spirit you're going to need the you're
[1:35:09] going to need the god of that of that
[1:35:11] word that's coming your way you're going
[1:35:12] to need all of the word but you're going
[1:35:13] to need the life of that God in you to
[1:35:15] be able to hand it handle it why they
[1:35:17] were in Mark 16 they were supposed to go
[1:35:18] and preach the gospel and all the world
[1:35:21] but to preach the gospel does not mean
[1:35:23] to do what I'm doing right now speaking
[1:35:25] it
[1:35:25] it's to show it it's to manifest it so
[1:35:28] they weren't just going out to speak
[1:35:29] they could have went and preached the
[1:35:30] gospel they've been preaching the gospel
[1:35:32] in their life in their time with Jesus
[1:35:34] but he says no no when you're going to
[1:35:36] do it now I'm going away and you're
[1:35:38] going to take my place and that means
[1:35:40] something different has to happen to you
[1:35:41] because you can't take my place right
[1:35:43] now he just told Peter a few days before
[1:35:45] get thee behind me Satan
[1:35:48] you have a lot Peter but you're lacking
[1:35:49] a lot too so he says you've got to be
[1:35:52] the gospel
[1:35:53] you've got to be the manifestation of
[1:35:54] the Gospel not just a pre-train word but
[1:35:57] a preacher in life and in demonstration
[1:35:58] of these different things so he says you
[1:36:00] need the Holy Spirit to do that
[1:36:02] now Paul would take this in in First
[1:36:04] Corinthians and and he would talk about
[1:36:06] it because we're in a in a state even
[1:36:08] today where we know so much but it's
[1:36:11] still only in part
[1:36:13] we only have a part
[1:36:15] we have an open Word
[1:36:17] but it's in a process we're in a process
[1:36:19] of bringing ourselves to the place where
[1:36:21] we understand and where we can become
[1:36:23] that word and Paul says for now we know
[1:36:26] in part
[1:36:27] and we prophesy in part
[1:36:30] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:36:32] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:36:34] away now you'll see that when you reach
[1:36:36] full maturity and you you know that as
[1:36:37] adults here especially tonight that when
[1:36:40] you came became an adult certain things
[1:36:42] had to go away
[1:36:44] you couldn't stay up till two in the
[1:36:46] morning anymore could you
[1:36:48] because you couldn't get up and go to
[1:36:50] work you couldn't go out drinking every
[1:36:52] night if you're out in the world even if
[1:36:53] you are in the world you can't do it and
[1:36:55] still hold down your job you have to
[1:36:56] focus on relationships you have to focus
[1:36:58] on family you can't blow all your money
[1:37:00] because now you got to have a house of
[1:37:02] your own you gotta have a car of your
[1:37:03] own you got bills to pay you got
[1:37:04] responsibilities you got to pay taxes
[1:37:06] all these things something has to change
[1:37:08] when you become an adult
[1:37:10] when you go from partially an adult as a
[1:37:13] teenager to fully an adult then that the
[1:37:15] teenager part has to die off and there
[1:37:17] comes a point where it has to be dead
[1:37:18] and you've just got to be an adult
[1:37:20] moving forward
[1:37:21] he says when you when you've reached
[1:37:23] your point of graduation when you become
[1:37:25] adopted when you've when you've hit what
[1:37:27] you're supposed to hit when you've
[1:37:28] reached that goal then everything behind
[1:37:29] you has to drop away and you have to
[1:37:31] embrace what's ahead of you now he said
[1:37:33] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:37:36] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:37:38] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:37:40] childish things it's okay to be acting
[1:37:43] like a child if you're a child
[1:37:45] listen when you're when you're a new
[1:37:47] Christian when you're newborn and you
[1:37:49] just received the Holy Spirit you're
[1:37:51] still a spiritual child and though you
[1:37:53] are a son you're not ready to be an
[1:37:55] adopted son yet and so you're growing
[1:37:57] and you're maturing but if you've been
[1:37:59] serving the lord for 20 years and you're
[1:38:01] still acting like a spiritual child
[1:38:02] there's something wrong you didn't drop
[1:38:04] what you were supposed to drop the issue
[1:38:07] is not the Holy Spirit the issue's not
[1:38:08] the tutor it said you didn't choose to
[1:38:10] let go of something that was childish
[1:38:11] and so you can't move into maturity you
[1:38:13] can't move into adulthood you're
[1:38:15] delinquent not the Holy Spirit not the
[1:38:17] tutor
[1:38:20] he says for now we see through a glass
[1:38:22] Darkly in other words we're looking
[1:38:24] through dark glasses now most of you
[1:38:25] probably haven't experienced welding
[1:38:27] glasses but if you put welding glasses
[1:38:29] on in just natural light you can't see
[1:38:30] anything
[1:38:31] you have to have a really bright flame
[1:38:33] you have to have a really bright spark
[1:38:34] to see anything because it's shielding
[1:38:36] all of the the standard light so you can
[1:38:38] see the really bright stuff when it
[1:38:39] comes through and so you only see at
[1:38:41] best vague shapes and outlines when you
[1:38:43] have dark glasses on Paul says this is
[1:38:45] what it's like when you're a child when
[1:38:47] you have it in part
[1:38:48] there's no real detail there's no real
[1:38:50] understanding of what's going around he
[1:38:52] says for now we see through a glass
[1:38:53] Darkly but then when that which is
[1:38:55] perfect has come we will see face to
[1:38:58] face he says now I know in part
[1:39:02] he says but then shall I know even as I
[1:39:06] am known
[1:39:07] so Paul says it's not about
[1:39:08] understanding of the word or doctrines
[1:39:11] or anything he says but I'm going to
[1:39:12] know as I am known I'm going to know who
[1:39:14] I am and I'm going to know what it means
[1:39:17] and I'm going to know what the benefits
[1:39:18] are and I'm going to know what the costs
[1:39:19] are and I'm going to know what the
[1:39:21] responsibilities are he says all truly
[1:39:23] understand what it is to be a Son of God
[1:39:24] when I become a full adult when I become
[1:39:27] fully mature now I believe Paul was
[1:39:28] adopted and he's looking to the the
[1:39:30] fullness of his adoption which is what
[1:39:32] the resurrection and the rapture that's
[1:39:34] when we're going to see everything
[1:39:36] but there is a revealing there isn't
[1:39:38] adopting that happens here that points
[1:39:40] to who you are in Christ and the
[1:39:41] adoption is the son or daughter of God
[1:39:43] Amen
[1:39:44] he says but now abideth faith hope and
[1:39:48] charity these three but the greatest of
[1:39:51] these is Charity so all of this training
[1:39:53] all of this teaching all of this
[1:39:55] chastising all of these drills all of
[1:39:57] these tests they're taking us somewhere
[1:39:58] and it's from in part children
[1:40:01] to Perfection adults that's the whole
[1:40:04] process that's what it's going through
[1:40:06] and like I said before that transition
[1:40:08] time is so tough and and maybe looking
[1:40:10] at uh Justine's not here but maybe you
[1:40:12] know even Selena and Irene they're in
[1:40:15] that transition from being young people
[1:40:17] to adults
[1:40:18] and so they know what is required of
[1:40:21] them as an adult but maybe they're not
[1:40:23] quite acting it in every way and that's
[1:40:25] the toughest thing is because you know
[1:40:26] what you're supposed to be doing but you
[1:40:28] haven't quite let go of everything yet
[1:40:30] and so you're half adult and you're
[1:40:31] still half teenager that's the toughest
[1:40:34] point is because you've understood
[1:40:35] what's going on you've understood what's
[1:40:37] required but you're still not quite
[1:40:39] ready to let go and oftentimes that's
[1:40:41] the toughest time for us as Believers is
[1:40:43] because we're not ready to let go of
[1:40:45] things but yet we know we need to let go
[1:40:49] we know what the right decision is but
[1:40:51] we're like oh I just I'm not ready yet
[1:40:54] I'm not ready to take my hands off the
[1:40:56] wheel I'm not ready to close that out
[1:40:58] that chapter of my life I'm not ready to
[1:41:00] be responsible in every way
[1:41:02] that's what adulthood is is really his
[1:41:04] responsibility you have a little bit of
[1:41:07] fun baked in there but it's mostly
[1:41:08] responsibility that's a that's a tough
[1:41:10] thing to let go amen it's like Samuel
[1:41:13] right now his his frustration with us is
[1:41:15] that he doesn't even understand why he's
[1:41:17] being disciplined he does but he doesn't
[1:41:19] understand the purpose of it he doesn't
[1:41:21] understand that if he does it our way
[1:41:23] things will be so much better for him
[1:41:26] and for us praise God
[1:41:28] so he doesn't understand that but now
[1:41:30] when you get to to Jonathan's Age and
[1:41:32] and Lydia's age they know what we're
[1:41:34] trying to do and they know why we're
[1:41:35] doing it and so there's an understanding
[1:41:37] and they realize life is better when I'm
[1:41:39] in obedience than when I'm not
[1:41:41] but they're still young people and so
[1:41:43] disobedience is still in there
[1:41:46] but then as you come up to the higher
[1:41:47] ranks and the 19 year olds in the 18s
[1:41:49] and the 20s now they're on that
[1:41:51] transition and they've just got to make
[1:41:52] that final decision they've just got to
[1:41:54] cut that last thing loose and step into
[1:41:56] adulthood and all of a sudden they'll
[1:41:58] realize
[1:41:59] it's better that way
[1:42:01] it's better that way
[1:42:02] what I've been looking for was waiting
[1:42:04] for me all along but I had to let go of
[1:42:06] some of these things that were holding
[1:42:07] me back and I didn't realize that's what
[1:42:09] was holding me back
[1:42:13] the switch doesn't flip
[1:42:15] what happens is the switch flips
[1:42:16] mentally and then it comes down through
[1:42:18] our life and we start to make those
[1:42:19] decisions and that's when you know
[1:42:21] people really have it is when the switch
[1:42:22] flips and they start to seek
[1:42:25] after that which is right rather than
[1:42:26] fight the trials that are trying to get
[1:42:28] them to do what's right we start to
[1:42:30] accept it we start to embrace it and I
[1:42:32] remember in in University the first two
[1:42:34] years we were doing things that were
[1:42:36] just the first three years we were
[1:42:37] studying things and it was like why do
[1:42:39] we have to learn this why do we have to
[1:42:40] learn this but it was the building
[1:42:42] blocks it was the basics for what was
[1:42:43] going to come later and if we didn't get
[1:42:45] that then we'd get everything else
[1:42:47] wrong that was coming later the last
[1:42:49] half of my education in University was
[1:42:51] way easier way more fun way more
[1:42:53] enjoyable than the first half but if I
[1:42:55] hadn't learned the first half I would
[1:42:56] have done very poorly on the second half
[1:42:59] and so what happened is I remember we
[1:43:01] had a math course and and this guy was
[1:43:03] teaching us and and it was it was
[1:43:05] mathematics in seven dimensions
[1:43:07] we only need four we only have four
[1:43:11] and he was teaching it in seven
[1:43:12] dimensions and somebody said you know
[1:43:14] sir why are we learning this is anybody
[1:43:17] actually using this I think I might have
[1:43:18] actually asked the question he says yes
[1:43:20] two people in the world are using this
[1:43:22] that we know of right now
[1:43:24] one in NASA and somebody doing some
[1:43:26] theoretical work like Stephen Hawking
[1:43:28] does and we said so why are we learning
[1:43:29] it he says because you never know if you
[1:43:31] might be one of the next two
[1:43:34] sometimes we're sitting there and we're
[1:43:36] looking at what's coming our way and we
[1:43:37] say do I really need that I'm I'm just
[1:43:39] this or I'm just that I'm just a wife
[1:43:41] I'm just a young person listen learn it
[1:43:43] if God's put it in front of you learn it
[1:43:45] because he's given it to you for a
[1:43:46] reason and it's for your benefit and
[1:43:47] you're going to need it down the road
[1:43:48] but once that switch flipped and we
[1:43:51] realized this is going to help us down
[1:43:52] the road boy we were a lot happier
[1:43:55] and then when we started getting into
[1:43:57] real life application we started doing
[1:43:59] work with our hands and we started
[1:44:00] designing things and Building Things and
[1:44:02] testing things we're like oh this is a
[1:44:03] lot of fun now but we had to go through
[1:44:05] the grind up front to get to the more
[1:44:06] enjoyable stuff later
[1:44:09] Paul would say this in Hebrews 6. he
[1:44:11] says therefore leaving
[1:44:13] this is how we get to the Perfection now
[1:44:15] he says leaving the principles of the
[1:44:17] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[1:44:19] Perfection so here's what Perfection
[1:44:21] looks like
[1:44:22] it's not laying again the foundation of
[1:44:25] repentance from dead Works remember in
[1:44:26] Hebrews 4 it talks about we've entered
[1:44:28] into a rest
[1:44:30] and it says what it's we've entered into
[1:44:31] a rest we've ceased from our dead Works
[1:44:34] Paul says when you're entering into
[1:44:35] Perfection this should be far behind you
[1:44:38] you should be well past the point where
[1:44:40] you're trying to do things for God where
[1:44:42] you're trying to figure things out where
[1:44:43] you're trying to push your way into it
[1:44:45] where your thoughts your opinions your
[1:44:46] preferences have any play in it he says
[1:44:48] that should be so far behind you we
[1:44:50] should have left that a long time ago if
[1:44:52] you're coming into adoption you've
[1:44:53] learned to give up what you think what
[1:44:55] you feel is best and trust God to do it
[1:44:57] the right way
[1:44:58] he says so get rid of that
[1:45:00] he says and of Faith toward God now you
[1:45:04] say that's a wonderful thing to have
[1:45:05] faith to war God faith to war God is
[1:45:07] Acts 2 38. it's bringing you to the word
[1:45:10] it's it's taking God at his word but
[1:45:12] that's not where we want to end
[1:45:14] because Faith war God is just salvation
[1:45:17] but he wants us to bring us in Paul
[1:45:19] we'll talk about about it later that
[1:45:20] we're supposed to have the faith of God
[1:45:22] remember the just shall live by faith by
[1:45:25] the Faith by the faith of God so it's
[1:45:27] translating us now from looking toward
[1:45:30] God to now being partakers of the faith
[1:45:32] of God so he says you can't be you can't
[1:45:34] have your fingers in every pie you can't
[1:45:36] be trying to drive God you can't be
[1:45:37] trying to drive your life that's
[1:45:39] supposed to be behind you and he says
[1:45:40] and God can't be something that you're
[1:45:42] looking towards now it has to be
[1:45:44] something that's a part of you it's got
[1:45:45] to be with you
[1:45:46] he says now enough the doctrine of
[1:45:48] baptisms and of laying on of hands and
[1:45:50] of resurrection of the dead and of
[1:45:52] Eternal judgment these are all doctrinal
[1:45:53] things
[1:45:55] we've got to have Doctrine but he says
[1:45:57] if you're stuck on Doctrine now you're
[1:45:59] not ready for Perfection that has to go
[1:46:01] behind you got to have that stability
[1:46:03] you've got to have that structure in
[1:46:04] your life but that shouldn't be where
[1:46:06] your focus is anymore we ought to know
[1:46:08] what we believe in this church
[1:46:09] we ought to know what the scripture says
[1:46:11] we ought to be able to give an answer
[1:46:13] for why we believe the way we believe
[1:46:14] but that can't be where we stop
[1:46:17] he says and this will we do will go on
[1:46:20] to Perfection if God permits
[1:46:23] and then he says but beloved we are
[1:46:25] persuaded better things of you and
[1:46:27] things that accompany salvation
[1:46:30] through or though we thus speak so he's
[1:46:33] saying what getting saved is is a start
[1:46:35] but that's not where it ends
[1:46:39] so much in the world all they're trying
[1:46:40] to do is get them to Christ get them to
[1:46:42] accept the finished work of Calvary and
[1:46:44] then Paul's coming along and he's saying
[1:46:46] there are things that accompany
[1:46:47] salvation and this that accompany
[1:46:49] salvation is going to be your perfection
[1:46:52] so don't stop saying I've been baptized
[1:46:54] and I've accepted Christ as my savior
[1:46:56] I'm good to go no that's not it for a
[1:46:58] child of God for a son or daughter of
[1:47:00] God there are things that accompany
[1:47:01] salvation and that's what he's
[1:47:03] interested in that's what he's bringing
[1:47:05] us to
[1:47:06] he says for God is Not unrighteous to
[1:47:09] forget your work and your labor of love
[1:47:11] which ye have showed toward his name and
[1:47:13] that ye have ministered to the Saints
[1:47:15] and do Minister he said and we desire
[1:47:17] that every one of you do show the same
[1:47:19] diligence to the full Assurance of Hope
[1:47:22] unto the end and he talked about Abraham
[1:47:25] just before this I cut it out in the
[1:47:27] verses previous just for the sake of
[1:47:29] time but he was pointing to Abraham and
[1:47:30] he says Abraham was faithful all the way
[1:47:32] till the end
[1:47:33] all the way till the end when things
[1:47:35] were tough when things looked impossible
[1:47:37] when it looked like nothing was going
[1:47:38] right he stayed diligent and he didn't
[1:47:41] go back to the land of her he didn't go
[1:47:43] back and rekindle relationships he cut
[1:47:44] off he didn't go back and seek his
[1:47:46] former business partners but he's
[1:47:47] staying we're God had put him and he
[1:47:49] walked as God told him to walk and he
[1:47:51] held the faith until God brought it to
[1:47:53] pass in his life amen what's he saying
[1:47:55] stay diligent
[1:47:57] stay diligent to what God has promised
[1:47:59] and don't walk away from it before God
[1:48:01] brings you to the full Assurance the
[1:48:03] full hope the Fulfillment of what it is
[1:48:05] amen believe for full healing not just
[1:48:08] for medical intervention amen believe
[1:48:10] for full Deliverance not just the ups
[1:48:12] and downs and the ins and outs pray for
[1:48:14] our lasting Joy rather than one that's
[1:48:16] conditional on what's going on around
[1:48:18] you stick with it stick with it because
[1:48:21] there's a benefit if you do and it's
[1:48:22] that God will bring it to pass in your
[1:48:24] life he says that ye be not slothful but
[1:48:27] followers of them this is the cloud of
[1:48:29] witnesses who through faith and patient
[1:48:32] inherit the promises you'll see that
[1:48:35] Paul has this this key theme throughout
[1:48:38] this idea of faith and patience
[1:48:43] it's very rare in Scripture that faith
[1:48:44] has an immediate result
[1:48:46] sometimes it doesn't you saw it most
[1:48:48] often in the ministry of Jesus where
[1:48:49] somebody would come up and say I believe
[1:48:51] this Lord I'm asking you to do this and
[1:48:53] he would do it instantly
[1:48:55] but the thing is in those situations he
[1:48:58] wasn't working on adoption
[1:49:00] but now he's working on adoption and so
[1:49:03] he's got to train us and he's got to
[1:49:04] teach us and so he says you got to have
[1:49:05] faith and you got to have patience
[1:49:07] because you believe in your sincere and
[1:49:09] then you've got the Fulfillment over
[1:49:10] here but in between that is a gap and
[1:49:12] that's where patience comes in faith
[1:49:14] plus patience takes you through to the
[1:49:16] Fulfillment all the way in the End Amen
[1:49:18] your faith and Patience are always tied
[1:49:20] together and it will always be that way
[1:49:22] it's always been that way and and that's
[1:49:24] the the bridging of that Gap so often is
[1:49:26] you've got to have patience and wait on
[1:49:28] God and trust him to take you all the
[1:49:29] way through
[1:49:31] very familiar scripture in James it says
[1:49:33] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:49:35] faith the testing of your faith Works
[1:49:37] patience so in other words Faith
[1:49:39] produces patience there's always a
[1:49:41] period of waiting and you decide now if
[1:49:43] you're going to wait in doubt or in
[1:49:45] faith that's your decision it's our
[1:49:48] decision are we going to say that or are
[1:49:49] we going to repeat the promises of God
[1:49:50] are we going to repeat the word of God
[1:49:52] or are we going to sit there and say
[1:49:53] well maybe I don't know
[1:49:55] because if you wait in that kind of
[1:49:57] patience it's not going to be patients
[1:49:58] that produces faith and it's not going
[1:50:00] to be patients that produces a result
[1:50:02] it's reflective of no faith in the
[1:50:04] beginning
[1:50:05] I mean that faith is going to keep going
[1:50:06] all the way through to these things but
[1:50:08] he says but let patience have her
[1:50:10] perfect work
[1:50:12] perfect work we're talking about
[1:50:14] perfection that's what the trials The
[1:50:16] Temptations the chastising all these
[1:50:17] things is about it says let patience
[1:50:19] have her perfect work that ye may be
[1:50:22] perfect
[1:50:23] and entire who wants to be perfect and
[1:50:25] entire
[1:50:26] I want to be perfect and entire I want
[1:50:28] to have everything God has for me he
[1:50:30] says let patience do it
[1:50:32] stick it out endure let patience have
[1:50:35] her perfect work that ye may be perfect
[1:50:37] and entire wanting nothing
[1:50:41] now don't look at that as well you know
[1:50:43] speaking of myself well I'd like a
[1:50:44] portion I'd like a motorcycle and I'd
[1:50:46] like 300 000 a year and no no that's not
[1:50:49] what he's talking about he's saying that
[1:50:50] you'll be lacking nothing that you're
[1:50:52] supposed to have
[1:50:53] that the word says you're supposed to
[1:50:55] have
[1:50:56] amen let's keep our eyes focused on
[1:50:58] Christ we're not preaching a Prosperity
[1:51:00] Gospel here tonight maybe maybe on
[1:51:03] Sunday
[1:51:04] no this is our prosperity this is our
[1:51:07] prosperity here that you're wanting
[1:51:08] nothing amen That Word Perfect means
[1:51:11] brought to its end
[1:51:13] finished wanting nothing necessary for
[1:51:16] completeness
[1:51:18] full grown adult of full age and mature
[1:51:24] that word entire means complete in all
[1:51:26] its parts in no part wanting or unsound
[1:51:31] if you're ever working on a car
[1:51:32] sometimes the parts there but it's not
[1:51:34] very good it's not working the way it's
[1:51:35] supposed to he says you're not going to
[1:51:37] be like a rusted out Newfoundland car
[1:51:39] you're going to be like a brand new one
[1:51:40] everything's in its place and it works
[1:51:42] the way it's supposed to it says whole
[1:51:44] of a body without blemish or defect free
[1:51:48] from sin faultless complete in all
[1:51:52] respects that's what patience does
[1:51:55] Church
[1:51:57] are we going to be praying for patience
[1:52:01] if we were looking at this scripture
[1:52:02] we'd probably say Lord give me the
[1:52:03] patience
[1:52:05] we're going to be in the trial we might
[1:52:06] as well get the patience and the
[1:52:07] benefits that go with it amen
[1:52:09] amen we're children of Faith that's they
[1:52:11] were children of Abraham that's that's
[1:52:13] our Our Heritage that's our bloodline
[1:52:15] amen but our Perfection is found when we
[1:52:18] have patience so that our faith has made
[1:52:20] sight
[1:52:21] that's what our Perfection is going to
[1:52:22] be amen our our entirety is found when
[1:52:24] we're nothing and Christ is everything
[1:52:27] that's where our Perfection is is when
[1:52:28] Jonathan curlette is completely out of
[1:52:30] the picture and it's Christ in every
[1:52:32] part of me and nothing less than that is
[1:52:34] going to do nothing less than that is
[1:52:36] going to do it that's what Perfection is
[1:52:38] and the only way I can get there is if I
[1:52:39] Surrender my will the only way you can
[1:52:42] get there is if you surrender your will
[1:52:43] every single day what is it it's Christ
[1:52:45] in you the hope of glory that is
[1:52:47] perfection that's what we're looking for
[1:52:49] it's a living word today
[1:52:51] brother Brown would say this as we're
[1:52:52] coming to a close he says did you ever
[1:52:54] know that every son that cometh to God
[1:52:56] must first be tried whipped child
[1:52:58] whipping correction
[1:53:00] it's not easy
[1:53:02] it's not easy
[1:53:04] it's okay to say this isn't easy
[1:53:07] it's good if you say it's not easy
[1:53:09] because that means it's God doing it and
[1:53:10] not Satan he says when God gives you a
[1:53:13] weapon you go out here and you say well
[1:53:14] I'll go mingle around a bit God will
[1:53:17] give you a real old-fashioned spanking
[1:53:19] for it and I tell you if we have more of
[1:53:21] that in the natural today we'd have
[1:53:22] better children
[1:53:24] he says God wants his household
[1:53:26] straightened out so he gives you a
[1:53:28] little whipping so you can get
[1:53:29] straightened up he says it makes you
[1:53:32] love him more
[1:53:34] that's when you start to be matures when
[1:53:36] you start to realize that that weapon
[1:53:38] was to get me back in line
[1:53:40] I was reading today in Isaiah and Isaiah
[1:53:43] is talking about and we'll go into this
[1:53:45] maybe a little bit more in the next
[1:53:46] service he's talking about the
[1:53:47] rebellious children and he says but in
[1:53:49] that day he says there'll be a voice
[1:53:50] that says this is my way walk ye in it
[1:53:53] when does The Voice speak he says when
[1:53:56] you turn to the right
[1:53:57] or when you turn to the left
[1:53:59] that's the voice of God and sometimes
[1:54:01] that little
[1:54:02] that's a hey
[1:54:04] you're not going straight you're getting
[1:54:06] off the path and that's all this is just
[1:54:08] a little corrective whip
[1:54:10] hey what was that
[1:54:11] this is my way walk ye in it
[1:54:14] he says it makes you love him more and
[1:54:16] if we do it right with our kids when
[1:54:19] it's all said and done they'll love us
[1:54:21] they don't love us in the moment Samuel
[1:54:23] when we do it he says bad daddy
[1:54:25] bad mommy
[1:54:27] because all he's concerned about is how
[1:54:29] he's feeling
[1:54:31] but now you get to the point where
[1:54:33] they're old enough and you just have to
[1:54:34] say something to them and they're
[1:54:35] corrected and they're okay with it
[1:54:37] and then when they come older and older
[1:54:39] they start to realize hey
[1:54:41] mom was a good mom dad was a good mom
[1:54:43] good dad
[1:54:44] it's harder to be a good parent than a
[1:54:46] bad parent
[1:54:47] it's easy to be a bad parent let them go
[1:54:49] do what they want
[1:54:50] but to be a good parent means that
[1:54:52] you've got to correct you've got to be
[1:54:53] on top of them you've got to be looking
[1:54:54] at the things they do you've got to be
[1:54:56] aware of what's going on in their life
[1:54:57] you've got to be engaged with them day
[1:54:59] in and day out and that's a lot tougher
[1:55:00] to do
[1:55:01] he says my father used to give me
[1:55:03] whippings and I thought oh my I wished I
[1:55:06] could call the old gray-headed father of
[1:55:08] mine back from the other lands today I
[1:55:10] would respect every weapon he ever gave
[1:55:12] me I never got even as much as I needed
[1:55:14] that is absolutely true
[1:55:17] we I'm talking to myself there are so
[1:55:19] many things that Mom and Dad didn't know
[1:55:21] that I did that if they did no I'd have
[1:55:23] got whipped
[1:55:24] we didn't get everything we deserved
[1:55:26] that's for sure
[1:55:27] he says though he didn't do right
[1:55:29] himself yet he wanted me to do right
[1:55:30] amen and he wants us to if the Earthly
[1:55:33] parents wants us to do well what about
[1:55:35] our Heavenly parent the Lord Jesus he
[1:55:37] has to correct us
[1:55:39] the scripture says if we cannot stand
[1:55:42] chastisement or a whipping child
[1:55:44] correction then we become illegitimate
[1:55:46] children and not the children of God see
[1:55:49] if you're really born again get it now
[1:55:50] if you're really born again there's
[1:55:53] nothing can separate you from God
[1:55:56] now see we look at that the scripture
[1:55:57] says neither neither life nor death nor
[1:56:00] principalities nor powers or things
[1:56:02] above or things below and we look at
[1:56:04] there's nothing exterior that can hold
[1:56:06] us back from God but Brother Brad is
[1:56:07] bringing it down he's saying you won't
[1:56:09] let God's whippings hold you back
[1:56:12] you don't get pouty when God doesn't let
[1:56:16] things go your way you don't get mad at
[1:56:18] God when he gives you a corrective
[1:56:20] sermon or when he takes things away from
[1:56:22] you that you really know you ought not
[1:56:23] to have you don't go and bury your head
[1:56:26] in the sand and or bury your head in
[1:56:27] your pillow and and just moan and pout
[1:56:29] and you know like brother Dwayne was
[1:56:31] talking about pick my lip up off the
[1:56:32] floor after a couple of weeks no he says
[1:56:35] you don't do that you don't let that
[1:56:36] come between you and God you don't stop
[1:56:38] having your devotions because things
[1:56:39] didn't go your way
[1:56:41] you don't stop reading your Bible
[1:56:42] because he hasn't provided in the way
[1:56:44] you thought you don't stop coming to
[1:56:46] church because things aren't the way you
[1:56:48] think they should be
[1:56:49] what is it you're mature
[1:56:52] and you love him regardless and you
[1:56:54] don't let the situations of Life stop
[1:56:57] you from your relationship with God
[1:56:58] because listen you're going to get sick
[1:57:00] aren't you brother Bob
[1:57:01] you're going to get sick and you didn't
[1:57:03] deserve to get sick
[1:57:05] what's it going to do are you going to
[1:57:06] are you gonna walk away from God because
[1:57:08] he didn't protect you
[1:57:10] we're going to go through financial
[1:57:11] struggles aren't we brother Matt
[1:57:14] and you say I've always paid my tithes
[1:57:15] why am I going through it
[1:57:17] did you walk away from God did you stop
[1:57:19] your devotions
[1:57:21] stop coming to church
[1:57:23] find another church find it no no no no
[1:57:25] you kept coming because you love him
[1:57:28] and then because you won't let life
[1:57:30] situations
[1:57:32] hold you back from the love of God
[1:57:36] he says that's right and then he goes
[1:57:37] into the exterior things neither
[1:57:39] starvation perils trials suffering death
[1:57:41] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:57:43] God which is in Christ Jesus he's saying
[1:57:45] you don't let those things separate you
[1:57:48] they won't hold God back but he's saying
[1:57:50] you don't let them hold you back either
[1:57:51] you've got a part to play now listen
[1:57:54] we're holding on to the hand and and
[1:57:56] it's his hand holding us that keeps us
[1:57:57] together but he says you're still
[1:57:59] putting your hand up there you're still
[1:58:01] wanting to hold on Amen though you cling
[1:58:03] the strength is in his hand but at least
[1:58:04] you're putting your hand out to cling to
[1:58:06] him that's what he's saying but he says
[1:58:08] now you say well I started to be a
[1:58:09] Christian one time and everything
[1:58:12] begin going this way and that way and I
[1:58:14] thought my I was better off going the
[1:58:16] other way
[1:58:17] and that way and that and I thought my
[1:58:19] was better off the other way he says you
[1:58:21] never did come to God brother if you
[1:58:23] ever really come to God and got a taste
[1:58:25] of the Heavenly gifts of God partakers
[1:58:27] of his divine nature why you know could
[1:58:29] no more become a sinner again unbeliever
[1:58:31] than a stalk of corn could become a
[1:58:33] cocklebur that's right he says it's your
[1:58:36] nature he says you're made up you've
[1:58:39] come the right approach he says if
[1:58:41] you're that way you've you've you're
[1:58:43] made up you're not a real Christian he
[1:58:45] says but you've come the right approach
[1:58:46] if you're the other way he says now you
[1:58:48] come your own approach so if other words
[1:58:50] if you think you're better off the way
[1:58:51] you used to be he says you didn't come
[1:58:53] God's way
[1:58:54] and you're not a child of God he says
[1:58:56] you come God's provided approach one
[1:58:59] time and see what happens
[1:59:01] church let me put it this way endure one
[1:59:03] time
[1:59:04] endure to the end
[1:59:08] Ure one time
[1:59:10] and it'll make it easier to go through
[1:59:12] the next one because at the end of every
[1:59:13] Godly trial is his word
[1:59:16] every time
[1:59:18] scripture says God is not a a man that
[1:59:20] he should lie nor the son of man that he
[1:59:22] should repent of what he said or take it
[1:59:23] back
[1:59:24] listen God will fulfill his word but
[1:59:26] you've got to endure
[1:59:29] endurance is required of the believer
[1:59:31] you've got to be able to stick it out
[1:59:32] amen truly humble ourselves one time and
[1:59:35] say Lord I'm going to be still
[1:59:37] I'm going to shut up I'm just going to
[1:59:40] rest and trust that your word is real
[1:59:43] just once church just once
[1:59:46] do it all the way to the end
[1:59:47] and see what happens amen that takes
[1:59:50] surrender
[1:59:51] takes humility
[1:59:52] takes patience takes faith it takes look
[1:59:55] into Jesus every single day that's for
[1:59:58] sure amen
[2:00:01] once you get the results one time
[2:00:03] it's always easier than next the test
[2:00:06] isn't easier but you trust the results
[2:00:08] you trust that the end is going to be
[2:00:10] the same as the last one which is the
[2:00:11] word of God be manifested in your life
[2:00:13] amen it's we need to realize this
[2:00:15] message is not just about doctrines and
[2:00:17] and sermons and tapes and a prod God
[2:00:19] sent a Prophet this is about a Living
[2:00:21] Word
[2:00:22] it's about a living word for a living
[2:00:24] people that have got to reflect Christ
[2:00:26] amen
[2:00:27] speaking of Abraham in Hebrews Paul said
[2:00:30] this he says
[2:00:31] and so after he had patiently endured he
[2:00:36] obtained the promise
[2:00:38] after he had patiently endured
[2:00:40] he obtained the promise
[2:00:43] brother Brahm says this
[2:00:44] as we close he says you can never be
[2:00:46] satisfied with the world's Goods
[2:00:49] you can never be satisfied belonging to
[2:00:51] a church
[2:00:52] you'll never be satisfied until you've
[2:00:55] found satisfaction in Jesus Christ the
[2:00:58] son of God Church we're talking about
[2:00:59] what when that which is in part is done
[2:01:01] away when that which is perfect has come
[2:01:03] he says you won't be satisfied with
[2:01:06] anything less than what I'm talking
[2:01:08] about here
[2:01:10] he says the only way you can ever be
[2:01:12] satisfied he says now he came to bring
[2:01:16] perfection
[2:01:19] he didn't come to do a halfway job
[2:01:22] he didn't come to leave us half in our
[2:01:23] sins and half not in our sins
[2:01:25] the other like we said before there's no
[2:01:27] half drunk
[2:01:28] he didn't come to make you a half Son of
[2:01:30] God a half daughter of God he'd make you
[2:01:33] a half Victorious believer he made you a
[2:01:35] Believer he made you an overcomer
[2:01:38] and that's what he's going to do
[2:01:40] but he says he came to bring Perfection
[2:01:43] and that's what we're going to go in
[2:01:44] over the next few Services amen God
[2:01:46] bless you let's stand each one
[2:01:56] looks like we're going to have an
[2:01:58] interesting oh here she comes that's
[2:02:00] good what's the purpose of this training
[2:02:02] why am I going through this why am I
[2:02:04] spending time on this we've got so much
[2:02:06] to chew off and and I've got to kind of
[2:02:08] bring it in bite-sized portions through
[2:02:09] these services and it's tough so many
[2:02:12] times because you don't get to to paint
[2:02:13] the full pictures you're you're seeing
[2:02:16] it
[2:02:16] but that patient enduring amen
[2:02:19] that patient enduring is what we've been
[2:02:21] talking about and Blanc and I were
[2:02:23] talking about this with Samuel yesterday
[2:02:24] and he was kind of just misbehaving a
[2:02:26] bit and
[2:02:27] and you know when he goes and he just
[2:02:29] kind of flops himself down and just
[2:02:31] pouts and cries and everything and he
[2:02:32] gets so frustrated he gets so frustrated
[2:02:35] because he doesn't understand why we
[2:02:37] keep doing these things to him
[2:02:39] as the hardest thing as a child of God
[2:02:41] is when you don't understand
[2:02:43] you don't realize what's going on
[2:02:45] and he's so frustrated with it and he
[2:02:48] can't get past that point of oh yeah
[2:02:50] because here's the thing what Samuel
[2:02:52] usually wants is food
[2:02:54] or fun
[2:02:56] or to be outside
[2:02:58] and all he'd do listen he wouldn't need
[2:03:01] food so often if he would eat when we we
[2:03:03] tell him to eat and eat what we tell him
[2:03:05] to eat
[2:03:06] and guess what we'll give him his his
[2:03:08] little snacks from time to time
[2:03:10] as he goes through the day
[2:03:12] but if he did what we told him to do he
[2:03:13] wouldn't be looking for those things on
[2:03:15] the side
[2:03:16] and then if he wants to go outside we've
[2:03:18] got a time for him to go outside and a
[2:03:19] time for him to be inside
[2:03:21] we've got a time from a play and a time
[2:03:23] for him to sleep in these different
[2:03:24] things and when he does all those things
[2:03:26] and when we hold him to what we know is
[2:03:27] best for him he's the happiest boy in
[2:03:29] the world
[2:03:31] when he does when he is forced at this
[2:03:33] age to do what we want him to do for his
[2:03:36] good he's a happier child in every
[2:03:38] aspect of his life
[2:03:40] but when he's disobedient and he doesn't
[2:03:42] do it it gets him out of the will
[2:03:45] it gets him out of the word and all of a
[2:03:48] sudden he's fighting to get what the
[2:03:50] parents would have given him if he would
[2:03:51] just be obedient
[2:03:53] that's where we've got to come to is we
[2:03:56] stop fighting the program
[2:03:59] now Jensen he doesn't worry about those
[2:04:01] things he's quick to obey and guess what
[2:04:04] he's way happier than Samuel
[2:04:06] he's way happier than Samuel because he
[2:04:09] knows that things work out well when he
[2:04:12] listens to Mommy and Daddy and guess
[2:04:13] what you still get your ice cream when
[2:04:15] you listen to Mommy and Daddy in fact
[2:04:16] you get it easier and more often
[2:04:19] than when you go and you kick out of a
[2:04:21] stink and you won't eat your broccoli
[2:04:22] and you won't finish your meals and
[2:04:24] whatnot why he's learned that the
[2:04:26] process works and when he goes with the
[2:04:29] process he's happier we're happier and
[2:04:31] the relationship is better
[2:04:33] that's where we're trying to get Samuel
[2:04:34] to is where he understands the process
[2:04:37] is better for me than my way
[2:04:40] and so he's got to go through chastising
[2:04:43] daily
[2:04:44] hourly
[2:04:46] minute by minute
[2:04:48] to get him to the point where the switch
[2:04:49] flips finally and he realizes it's way
[2:04:52] better
[2:04:54] to run towards them
[2:04:56] than to run away from them
[2:04:58] to not scratch people's faces and to not
[2:05:00] go and and put a tantrum in these
[2:05:02] different things but listen we look at
[2:05:04] him and everyone's smiling okay but I'm
[2:05:06] gonna bring it home
[2:05:09] we've all seen our kids do Tantrums
[2:05:12] and we laugh and we find it so funny
[2:05:15] sometimes annoying you know when our
[2:05:17] temperatures are short and and frayed
[2:05:19] and it's been a stressful week but we
[2:05:21] giggle at them sometimes because he goes
[2:05:23] in and like I said bad mommy bad daddy
[2:05:27] and you can't allow that so you go in
[2:05:28] and you say no you don't say that you
[2:05:29] give them a spank but you're just it's
[2:05:31] so funny because it what he's doing is
[2:05:34] so out of uh the perspective it's it's
[2:05:37] so blown up compared to the actual
[2:05:39] infraction that you did to him right
[2:05:41] it's so overblown
[2:05:43] and we laugh and we giggle at it
[2:05:46] but watch now we pray
[2:05:49] for something
[2:05:50] and God doesn't do it
[2:05:52] and what do we do we walk around with a
[2:05:54] hang dog face for the next three weeks
[2:05:57] we don't have a tantrum but our attitude
[2:06:00] is a tantrum towards God and our prayer
[2:06:02] life suffers and our devotion life
[2:06:04] suffers and we're not really engaged in
[2:06:07] church in any way and and what are we
[2:06:09] doing we're having a tantrum
[2:06:12] because we haven't realized I'm a Child
[2:06:14] of God
[2:06:15] and if my conscience is clear by the
[2:06:17] word
[2:06:18] then this is for my good
[2:06:22] and it's better if I go with it
[2:06:24] than if I fight it
[2:06:26] and it's better that I embrace it then I
[2:06:29] cry about it you can cry because it
[2:06:31] hurts listen we've lost people that we
[2:06:34] love to death to accidents
[2:06:37] we cry because it hurts you're allowed
[2:06:39] to say this hurts you're allowed to
[2:06:40] react to the pain
[2:06:42] but don't let the pain affect the
[2:06:44] relationship
[2:06:45] is what we're seeing
[2:06:47] don't let the pain affect the
[2:06:48] relationship you do that and guess what
[2:06:51] happens he just takes you back to the
[2:06:53] beginning of the chapter and we do it
[2:06:54] all over again
[2:06:56] church I don't want to keep doing
[2:06:57] chapters
[2:06:58] I don't keep one of doing I don't want
[2:07:01] to keep doing the same things over and
[2:07:02] over again
[2:07:03] sometimes we're doing it over and over
[2:07:04] again because we didn't give the right
[2:07:06] answer we didn't have the right response
[2:07:09] and so he says son you can't progress
[2:07:11] daughter you can't progress until you
[2:07:13] pass this test and I'm waiting for you
[2:07:15] to have the right attitude I'm waiting
[2:07:16] for you to have the right response
[2:07:18] before we go any further in this
[2:07:19] relationship
[2:07:22] and then sometimes like I said
[2:07:24] it's not that you did right or wrong
[2:07:25] like Joseph he's just saying what will
[2:07:28] your attitude be when things are tough
[2:07:30] and you've done nothing wrong
[2:07:32] anybody had a tough time and you feel
[2:07:34] like you've been so faithful to God
[2:07:36] absolutely we have
[2:07:38] what was our response
[2:07:41] when you've surrendered when you've
[2:07:43] given everything you give your time you
[2:07:45] give your energy you're committed to him
[2:07:47] and he pulls everything back
[2:07:50] it seems like even your prayers don't
[2:07:52] get answered nothing's there
[2:07:55] what do we do
[2:07:58] we stay the course
[2:08:01] it's the only thing the believer knows
[2:08:02] how to do stay the course
[2:08:04] amen keep pointing in the right
[2:08:06] direction
[2:08:07] listen brother Brown says sometimes God
[2:08:09] pulls back just to see what you will do
[2:08:13] and what's he doing he's trying to prove
[2:08:15] his children
[2:08:18] there's going to come a day you're going
[2:08:19] to write that final test
[2:08:22] you're going to pass that final little
[2:08:24] trial
[2:08:25] and it will be little compared to what
[2:08:27] he's got for you
[2:08:28] now he's going to say all right son
[2:08:30] daughter
[2:08:31] you've done it
[2:08:33] come up a little higher I've got some
[2:08:35] work for you to do now
[2:08:37] then the work really starts amen
[2:08:39] listen We're Not Gonna can you imagine
[2:08:41] Church think of this
[2:08:44] the resurrection has happened
[2:08:47] we've got sister coffee in our midst
[2:08:50] for 30 to 40 days
[2:08:52] are you going to be sitting there
[2:08:53] staring at sister coffee or are you
[2:08:55] going to be sitting there staring at the
[2:08:56] saints that have gone on before and say
[2:08:57] I really don't think he should have put
[2:08:59] me through what he put me through
[2:09:01] when you're flying through the air in a
[2:09:03] rapture
[2:09:04] changed in a moment
[2:09:07] are you going to say I wish he hadn't
[2:09:09] done that
[2:09:11] why because it worked
[2:09:14] brother Brown said about those
[2:09:15] tribulations he says those trials he
[2:09:17] says they just work
[2:09:19] they get it done Church we're not going
[2:09:21] to be sitting there saying he was too
[2:09:23] hard
[2:09:24] he held things back for me that I could
[2:09:26] have handled
[2:09:28] we're not going to be doing that
[2:09:30] we're going to be shouting
[2:09:32] we're going to be praising
[2:09:34] we're going to be screaming Hallelujah
[2:09:38] it'll be worth it all
[2:09:44] sitting around that great table
[2:09:47] get there and sit down and talk to Paul
[2:09:49] for a while
[2:09:50] Paul the Apostle
[2:09:52] I hope Paul's going to be there as well
[2:09:55] but Paulie Apostle is going to be there
[2:09:56] of that I'm quite certain
[2:10:00] you get a chance to sit down listen to
[2:10:01] them I tell you that man tell you what
[2:10:03] the Holy Spirit did with him on the
[2:10:04] backside of the desert
[2:10:06] and then talk to Daniel
[2:10:10] Daniel he let you go into the lion's den
[2:10:12] what about the three Hebrew children he
[2:10:14] let you go into the fire how are you
[2:10:16] feeling about that today
[2:10:19] talk to brother Branham took your wife
[2:10:22] took your daughter
[2:10:26] talked to those women that had to give
[2:10:27] their children up and they were eaten by
[2:10:29] lions and cut in half
[2:10:30] what do you think they'll be saying
[2:10:32] it was worth it
[2:10:34] he did exactly what he needed to do to
[2:10:37] get me to this side amen
[2:10:39] that's what we've got to do Church
[2:10:42] we've got to surrender to the process
[2:10:45] trust the process
[2:10:47] amen God bless you let's bow our heads
[2:10:49] Heavenly Father
[2:10:52] Lord it seems so difficult at times
[2:10:56] Lord to speak on these things and
[2:10:59] truly accept it
[2:11:01] but Lord we're looking to the author and
[2:11:03] finisher of our faith
[2:11:05] Lord if you did it and we've got the

[2:24:50] way in just before we before we close
[2:24:52] let's sing that song Higher Ground 355
[2:24:55] and let me ask brother Mark to come and
[2:24:57] close in prayer if he would remembering
[2:24:59] that for the Kingsley supposed to be
[2:25:01] traveling back this week from Nigeria so
[2:25:03] remember him brother Bob and sister
[2:25:05] Brenda are going to take a well-deserved
[2:25:06] break and go away to the West Coast of
[2:25:09] Newfoundland for a while with the Sarah
[2:25:10] and John so bring God's grace to them of
[2:25:13] course sister Betty brother Gerald
[2:25:15] and certainly appreciate the ones that
[2:25:17] have gone to help out sister Brenda's
[2:25:19] gone the morning sister Maureen I know
[2:25:21] it's been over with sister Betty sister
[2:25:22] Amber as well so certainly appreciate
[2:25:25] that and and the support that you've
[2:25:27] shown there and the time and it's not
[2:25:29] easy it's not easy being away and
[2:25:31] getting up early and doing all these
[2:25:32] things but God bless you each one for
[2:25:34] your support of the body amen that's
[2:25:36] what makes us a body not just coming to
[2:25:38] church and listening to the word or
[2:25:40] these different things but it's actually
[2:25:41] putting your shoulder to the wheel and
[2:25:43] supporting our brothers and sisters so
[2:25:45] appreciate each and every one that's
[2:25:46] that's done that amen and just trusting
[2:25:49] that we'll have sister Benny out of the
[2:25:50] hospital in short order and we can
[2:25:53] men so so let's remember these things
[2:25:55] but let's sing this Higher Ground amen
[2:25:57] there I believe that's that's a desire
[2:26:00] of every child of God is that Lord take
[2:26:03] me up Beyond where I'm at amen I know
[2:26:05] there's a higher plane I know there's a
[2:26:07] a greater surrender but with that
[2:26:09] greater surrender comes a greater
[2:26:10] experience a greater relationship and
[2:26:13] then it's not just about loss for
[2:26:14] everything we lose we gain so much more
[2:26:16] amen and when we understand that amen we
[2:26:18] start to push a lot harder and say Lord
[2:26:21] I'm willing to go through it take me to
[2:26:22] a higher place and sing it amen
