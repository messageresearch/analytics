[42:56] was thinking just as we were singing
[42:57] this that we've got some people that are
[42:59] sick and at home and I reminded of the
[43:01] story that brother codre Diggs told of a
[43:04] woman that was listening to him preached
[43:06] some meetings and she was in Jamaica I
[43:09] think nowhere near Trinidad and Tobago
[43:11] maybe and he was up preaching somewhere
[43:13] in the United States and she was
[43:15] streaming and she had a life-threatening
[43:17] disease that they were giving her
[43:19] medication for and while he was
[43:21] preaching the spirit of God reached into
[43:23] her home and she got a revelation that
[43:26] she was healed and she flushed those
[43:29] things down the toilet all those
[43:31] medications and then she went and told
[43:33] her husband and he said you're crazy
[43:34] you'll be dead tomorrow and she never
[43:36] needed those medications again amen
[43:39] God's not bound by a building he's not
[43:42] bound by our presence amen we sing that
[43:45] song he came to me when I couldn't go to
[43:47] him he came to me and so there may be
[43:50] those that need him tonight and they
[43:51] couldn't be here but we're just trusting
[43:53] his grace his presence his Spirit to go

[44:12] to have him here amen God bless you for
[44:14] coming all his way and we're glad to
[44:17] have brother Nelson guy with us unless

[44:21] happened no it hasn't happened amen but
[44:23] it's Nelson guy Jr but you know God is
[44:26] the great Shepherd but then he sends a
[44:29] pastor to

[47:56] looking forward to hearing me preach I
[47:58] consider it a great honor to stand here
[48:00] before you you're the purchase of the
[48:03] blood of Jesus Christ brother Randon
[48:05] would talk about if I had one vial of
[48:07] the blood of Christ how I would treat it
[48:09] right how I would hold it so dear to my
[48:12] heart and we would if we could have one
[48:14] vial of the blood of Christ that would
[48:16] be the blood of our savior what that
[48:18] would mean to us but more than that he
[48:20] gave that willingly with joy for you to
[48:24] purchase your salvation
[48:26] your healing your peace amen it's all he
[48:30] took it all upon himself to say I I
[48:32] overcame the world so you too can
[48:35] overcome amen amen thank you musicians

[48:44] amen and and I I I'm just brother Andrew
[48:47] do I'm a little bit nervous I don't know
[48:48] why but I guess that's the way it is
[48:50] when you're a first time preaching
[48:52] somewhere but I bring you greetings from
[48:53] the Saints at Edmonton I bring you
[48:56] greetings from Brother Ed hammermeister
[48:57] whom you know and uh he wanted to be
[49:00] sure to greet you all in the name of the
[49:01] Lord and brother Alan Dole who's been
[49:04] here in the midst of you he said please
[49:05] give my greetings to the Saints there
[49:07] and brother each one of you and of
[49:10] course brother Dale Uncle Dale it's good
[49:13] to see you amen I I was looking forward
[49:16] to seeing you again God bless you amen I
[49:18] appreciate the prayers tonight and I
[49:20] know there's been many more than just
[49:22] tonight and amen let's take our Bibles
[49:24] together I'm not going to take long and
[49:26] preliminaries get right to Isaiah
[49:28] chapter
[49:29] 55 yes I've been preaching since I'm 17
[49:32] and I'm now 32 and uh but in all of that
[49:35] I still rely on the anointing of the
[49:37] Holy Spirit without it I sure fail
[49:40] miserably and I'm so thankful when he
[49:43] comes by our way and as I say the Saints
[49:46] back home if you pull I'll preach and
[49:48] we'll let the Lord do the leading so as
[49:50] long as you poll will preach and we'll
[49:52] just go on as long as the Lord would
[49:53] have us I I try not to be long
[49:55] longwinded but uh I am also not a short
[49:58] person so we'll just take it as the Lord
[50:00] gives it amen amen we'll turn to Isaiah
[50:04] chapter 55 if I haven't said that
[50:06] already Isaiah
[50:07] 55 we'll start at verse
[50:09] 6 as I was fellowshipping this this
[50:12] afternoon with Brother John he quoted
[50:15] this scripture to me and didn't know it
[50:17] was my opening scripture tonight but uh
[50:20] the Lord knows what he's doing and I so
[50:22] appreciated his fellowship and his
[50:24] Hospitality God bless you you and I I
[50:27] love seeing a pastor with a vision that
[50:30] has a vision for the church here and
[50:32] God's blessed you amen amen Isaiah CH 55
[50:37] and verse 6 says seek ye the Lord while
[50:41] he may be
[50:42] found amen call ye upon him while he is
[50:46] near let the wicked forsake his way and
[50:50] the unrighteous man his thoughts let him
[50:53] turn unto the Lord and He will will have
[50:55] mercy upon him and to our God for he
[50:59] will abundantly pardon amen that right
[51:03] there outlines the sovereignty of God
[51:06] doesn't matter he's wicked he's
[51:07] unrighteous he's someone that we would
[51:09] look at and say they're hopeless but let
[51:12] them turn from their ways let them turn
[51:13] to God God will abundantly pardon amen
[51:17] the blood of Jesus is more powerful than
[51:20] we could
[51:21] imagine amen if we carry on in the
[51:24] scripture where it says and my my
[51:26] thoughts are not your thoughts the
[51:29] Lord's thoughts in other words are not
[51:31] your thoughts neither are there your
[51:33] neither are your ways my ways sayeth the
[51:36] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[51:38] the earth so are my ways higher than
[51:41] your ways and my thoughts and your
[51:43] thoughts for as the rain cometh down and
[51:46] the snow from heaven and in this country
[51:49] we know all about
[51:51] that amen especially the last couple
[51:53] weeks but it says as the rain of and the
[51:55] snow cometh down from heaven and
[51:56] returneth not thither but WTH the Earth
[52:00] and maketh it bring forth the bud that
[52:02] it may give seed to the swer and bread
[52:05] to the eater so shall my word be that
[52:08] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[52:10] return unto me void but it shall
[52:12] accomplish that which I please and it
[52:15] shall prosper in the thing where to I
[52:17] send it for ye shall go out with joy and
[52:21] be led forth with peace and mountains
[52:23] the and and and mountains the mountains
[52:25] and the hills shall Break Forth before
[52:28] you into singing and all the trees of
[52:31] the fields shall clap their hands and
[52:34] instead of a thorn shall come up the fur
[52:36] tree and instead of the Brier shall come
[52:39] up a myrtle tree and it shall be to the
[52:42] Lord for a name and for an everlasting
[52:44] sign that shall not be cut off amen
[52:48] let's just bow our heads together before
[52:50] we're
[52:51] seated Heavenly
[52:53] Father Lord Jesus we've read your your
[52:55] word Lord you said heavens and earth
[52:58] will pass away and but your word will
[53:00] never fail it'll never pass Lord not one
[53:03] J or one tit Lord until it be fulfilled
[53:07] father we thank you Lord Jesus that we
[53:09] can have a Blessed Assurance Lord that
[53:11] we know there's a foundation there's an
[53:13] absolute oh God that will come to pass
[53:16] that has been coming to pass that we're
[53:18] living in right now we don't want to
[53:20] just look back and see what you have
[53:22] done though we're very thankful for it
[53:24] Lord we don't want to just look ahead
[53:26] and see what you're doing though father
[53:27] we do look forward to it but Lord we
[53:30] want to live in the here and now we want
[53:32] to be a part Lord God of what you're
[53:33] doing in our day and in this generation
[53:36] Lord we want to know Lord that we're on
[53:38] the Forefront of the battlefield Lord
[53:40] that when God calls on somebody we're
[53:43] there to answer Lord as your your
[53:45] servant Isaiah said here am I Lord send
[53:49] me Father may you just come in a very
[53:52] Sovereign way tonight Lord you know what
[53:54] you've laid on my heart but Lord I pray
[53:55] youd take it and just meet the needs of
[53:58] the people Lord we commit it all into
[54:00] your hands in Jesus Christ's name we
[54:02] pray amen amen may the Lord is Blessing
[54:05] to the reading of the word you may have
[54:07] the comfort of your
[54:09] seats amen amen I want to just start
[54:13] here tonight and and and maybe as I was
[54:15] telling brother John I I Lord willing
[54:17] would preach a three-part Series this
[54:19] weekend if that's all right and and just
[54:21] begin to build one upon the other upon
[54:23] the other so I trust that you'll just
[54:25] bear with me a little bit I I we were
[54:28] talking this afternoon on on different
[54:30] gifts and the fivefold ministry and you
[54:32] know the teachers do this way and the
[54:34] Evangelist do that way well as he said
[54:36] I'm not sure what gift will come out
[54:38] we'll just trust the Lord and I believe
[54:40] as the Lord needs to speak to you he
[54:42] will speak to you in that way amen he's
[54:45] Sovereign in all that he does he's God
[54:48] he's able to do whatever he wants and I
[54:50] really want to speak starting tonight on
[54:51] The three-fold Showdown The three-fold
[54:53] Showdown as brother Ram would take in
[54:55] the paman church age I trust it's okay
[54:57] if I quote quotes to you and scriptures
[55:00] and just begin to read it that way and
[55:02] and allow the inspiration to strike but
[55:04] he would say in the paman church age
[55:06] actually it's in the section called pick
[55:07] up your pen and write which brother
[55:09] branam would receive that directly from
[55:10] the Lord as he would begin to write down
[55:12] as God would speak to him he and he'd
[55:14] write it this way he said then in the
[55:15] latter rain will come a Mount Carmel
[55:18] Showdown so watch this carefully now and
[55:20] see it in the word John was the
[55:22] Forerunner of Malachi 3 amen we believe
[55:25] that melachi 3 spoke of John and then it
[55:28] would talk about he planted the former
[55:30] rain and was rejected by the
[55:31] organizations of his day and Jesus came
[55:35] and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown
[55:37] the second Forerunner of Christ will sew
[55:39] for the latter Rain Jesus will be the
[55:42] showdown between the denominations and
[55:45] Creeds for he will come to back up his
[55:47] word and take his bride in the Rapture
[55:51] the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the
[55:53] second Showdown was Mount
[55:54] Transfiguration
[55:55] and the third Showdown will be Mount
[55:58] Zion amen and I want to just focus in
[56:00] tonight on Mount Carmel if we could and
[56:02] just begin to look into that and of
[56:04] course we'll turn into First Kings
[56:06] chapter 18 but we'll get to that as as
[56:08] we begin to look at these thoughts in
[56:10] Isaiah 55 is God would begin to express
[56:13] something through the prophet of Isaiah
[56:14] and Isaiah was a phenomenal Prophet it
[56:17] was him that gave us the prophecy of
[56:19] behold a virgin shall conceive and um
[56:22] and he'll be uh Emanuel God With Us and
[56:25] uh begin to give us much more prophecy
[56:27] than that is but as we begin to look
[56:29] into it he begin to speak really and
[56:31] give us insight into who God is and the
[56:34] way that God operates and he would be to
[56:36] say Seek Ye the Lord while he may be
[56:39] found in other words there is a time
[56:40] that he will not be found any longer
[56:42] there is a time where he will hide
[56:44] himself away but there is a time now
[56:46] this is the day of salvation this is a
[56:49] time to seek the Lord that he may be
[56:51] found of you and he says to call upon
[56:54] him why while he is near amen that's why
[56:57] we come to church that's why we pray
[56:58] that's why we listen to the message
[57:00] that's why we get ourselves aside to God
[57:02] so we could call on his name so he says
[57:04] draw nigh unto me them who draw nigh
[57:06] unto me I will draw nigh unto them amen
[57:09] and we desire that that's what worship
[57:11] is for and when you come in prayer when
[57:13] you come into the presence of God you do
[57:15] it in a way that you could draw nigh
[57:17] unto God and then begin to make your
[57:20] requests known as Jesus would even teach
[57:22] us to pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven
[57:24] how Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[57:27] come thy will be done on Earth as it is
[57:30] in heaven he starts out the prayer very
[57:32] much lord it's about you it's about
[57:34] worship to you it's about bringing up an
[57:37] atmosphere where God can draw nigh unto
[57:39] you and I then he says we can make our
[57:42] requests known when he's near that's the
[57:45] time to call on his name and then he
[57:47] says let the wicked forsake his way and
[57:49] the unrighteous man turn from his
[57:51] thoughts amen it's in other words it's
[57:54] the righteous man is not righteous
[57:56] because of his
[57:57] doing but let the unrighteous man turn
[57:59] from his unrighteous thoughts let him
[58:02] turn from his thoughts and we're living
[58:03] in such an age where brother Brandon
[58:05] would would receive a revelation from
[58:07] the angel of the Lord that would come to
[58:08] him and say your thoughts speak louder
[58:11] in heaven than your words do on Earth
[58:14] your thoughts speak louder we have a
[58:16] connection into the eternals and into
[58:18] the heavenlies that we what what we
[58:20] think is louder before God than what I'm
[58:24] saying to you right now God is looking
[58:27] and his word is a discerner of the
[58:29] thoughts and the intents of the heart in
[58:32] other words he it's not just that he he
[58:34] knows what you're thinking but rather he
[58:36] also knows what is a passing thought and
[58:39] he knows what is the intent of your
[58:41] heart he knows what you dwell on he
[58:43] knows who you really are God looks on
[58:45] the heart of man amen and God looks on
[58:48] those things and he knows when Satan
[58:50] throws an evil thought at you he knows
[58:52] what those thoughts are he understands
[58:55] that he knows that doesn't make you a
[58:56] non-Christian all of the sudden because
[58:58] Satan put a thought in your mind that
[59:00] you said where'd that come from I didn't
[59:01] mean to think that are you with me now
[59:04] am I the only one this happens to no all
[59:08] right we're we're together now Satan
[59:10] likes to throw thoughts at us that all
[59:11] of a sudden we go I don't want to think
[59:13] that and we we feel ashamed of it and we
[59:15] even repent of it but God is able to
[59:17] discern between those things and who you
[59:20] really
[59:22] are but now as as he begins to say if a
[59:24] man would turn from those ways I will
[59:26] hear but then he goes into his own
[59:28] thoughts which are the Eternal thoughts
[59:30] of God he says my thoughts are higher
[59:32] than your thoughts my ways are higher
[59:35] than your ways sayith the Lord but he
[59:37] doesn't just leave it there he says but
[59:39] as the rain comes down and the snow
[59:41] comes down from heaven and returneth not
[59:43] hither in other words he begins to lay
[59:45] out a principle he's saying my thoughts
[59:47] are higher my thoughts are ET returnal
[59:49] but I send them down to you for a
[59:52] purpose I send them down that they could
[59:54] bring forth that which I've sent them
[59:56] for in other words God doesn't ever just
[59:59] speak because the words that he speaks
[1:00:01] it says in the next verse my word will
[1:00:03] not return unto me void because the
[1:00:05] words of God are the thoughts of God
[1:00:08] expressed amen so when he sends his word
[1:00:10] out he's sending it out to perform what
[1:00:14] it was meant to do that it would bring
[1:00:16] forth that it would manifest in the
[1:00:18] beginning God spoke and he said let
[1:00:20] there be he said let there be let there
[1:00:22] be and there was it didn't just speak
[1:00:25] and then nothing happened it might have
[1:00:26] taken days it might have taken weeks
[1:00:29] months years decades Millennia uh
[1:00:31] Century all of these huge numbers it
[1:00:34] might have taken all kinds of years but
[1:00:36] it happened because when God speaks it
[1:00:39] must bring
[1:00:40] forth amen and we know that on the
[1:00:42] seventh day God rested and as he rested
[1:00:45] it brought forth and it manifested all
[1:00:47] of the seeds that had been sewn all the
[1:00:50] things that God had swed in the earth
[1:00:52] and the trees and the flowers and the
[1:00:53] plants it begin to bring forth and
[1:00:56] multiply amen as God as the logos
[1:00:59] brother Ron would teach us began to
[1:01:01] brood over the Earth amen and now if we
[1:01:04] could go over to Philippians chapter 4
[1:01:06] if you could turn there with me quickly
[1:01:08] a familiar scripture I believe to us
[1:01:11] and as we as he would begin to speak
[1:01:14] about his word in other words his word
[1:01:16] in verse 13 it won't bring forth a
[1:01:19] thorn Satan plants the Thorns Jesus
[1:01:22] would give us the parable about sers
[1:01:24] that went forth to sew one was a good
[1:01:27] man that went forth and in the night
[1:01:28] time a man clothed in in dark rment came
[1:01:31] forth and clo and sowed bad seed and
[1:01:34] we're familiar with those with those
[1:01:35] things but but he says what my word will
[1:01:38] bring forth is not a thorn but a fur
[1:01:42] tree a solid tree and instead of a Brier
[1:01:46] it will bring forth a myrtle tree Myrtle
[1:01:49] trees are interesting because Myrtle
[1:01:51] trees bring forth beautiful flowers and
[1:01:53] they bring forth little be berries that
[1:01:55] actually what their berries are used for
[1:01:57] is to make a fragrant
[1:02:00] alcohol and I like that because that's
[1:02:03] what brother brandham says is a type of
[1:02:06] Revelation the stimulation of Revelation
[1:02:08] the wine that was given to the church it
[1:02:11] will bring forth Revelation when it
[1:02:13] comes to maturity my word will be a
[1:02:16] revelation to you Amen in its
[1:02:19] season in Philippians chapter 4 as we're
[1:02:22] talking about the thoughts of God I want
[1:02:24] to just go into this a little bit then
[1:02:25] we'll get into Mount
[1:02:27] Carmel Philippians chapter 4 as it says
[1:02:30] in verse 6 says be careful for
[1:02:32] nothing oh praise God we know that that
[1:02:36] scripture means worry for
[1:02:38] nothing worry won't get you
[1:02:42] anywhere
[1:02:43] amen it's been proven worry will stop
[1:02:47] stress will stop somebody from getting
[1:02:51] pregnant sister unable to conceive
[1:02:53] because of stress worry no one's ever
[1:02:56] been able to conceive seed that way
[1:02:58] there's many other things it will cause
[1:02:59] death it will cause all kinds of
[1:03:02] sicknesses all kinds of heartaches all
[1:03:05] kinds of
[1:03:07] attitudes and here Paul begins to just
[1:03:08] lay says don't worry for
[1:03:11] anything
[1:03:14] but in everything by
[1:03:17] prayer and
[1:03:19] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:03:22] requests be made known unto God
[1:03:25] Amen in other words doesn't mean we just
[1:03:26] live it frivolously no worry for nothing
[1:03:30] but be
[1:03:32] prayerful amen it says in the peace of
[1:03:35] God that passes all understanding shall
[1:03:37] keep your hearts and Minds through
[1:03:39] Christ
[1:03:40] Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things
[1:03:43] are true whatsoever things are honest
[1:03:46] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:03:49] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:03:50] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[1:03:52] report if there be any virtue which is
[1:03:55] strength and if there be any praise
[1:03:58] think on these things amen my thoughts
[1:04:02] are higher than your thoughts but I let
[1:04:04] them come down as the rain comes down as
[1:04:07] the snow comes down to a place where you
[1:04:10] can begin to tap into or begin to think
[1:04:13] my thoughts because I desire to make
[1:04:16] them know and unto you Amen to bring
[1:04:19] forth that which I've purposed it to
[1:04:21] bring forth that's why it says
[1:04:23] whatsoever Things Are true whatsoever
[1:04:24] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:04:26] just all of these things if there be any
[1:04:28] praise any virtue think on these things
[1:04:31] it's a good indication of what the
[1:04:33] thoughts of God are of where we're
[1:04:35] living at of what we're doing and and
[1:04:37] how how Satan is affecting us and how
[1:04:40] he's affecting our lives and how he's
[1:04:42] putting different thoughts in our minds
[1:04:44] if we begin to dwell on those things if
[1:04:46] we find ourselves it affects our
[1:04:48] attitude if we begin to dwell on the
[1:04:51] parliament of today and the current
[1:04:52] prime minister and everything that's
[1:04:54] going on it affects our attitude it
[1:04:56] affects the way we think about things
[1:04:58] and we start to get upset and we start
[1:05:00] to get why is this way and why is that
[1:05:01] way does even care about our country
[1:05:03] what's going on in the states what's
[1:05:04] happening in Israel what's going on over
[1:05:06] there we begin to worry and worry and
[1:05:08] worry and it doesn't bring anything
[1:05:10] strength but he says if there be any
[1:05:13] strength in it think on these things if
[1:05:15] there be of a good report put your mind
[1:05:17] to these things put these things in your
[1:05:20] mind and make them the center part of
[1:05:23] your thought
[1:05:28] Hallelujah let's go over to First Kings
[1:05:30] chapter 18 let's just take it this way
[1:05:32] here first Kings chapter
[1:05:45] 18 amen Lord willing tonight we're going
[1:05:49] to read the whole chapter but
[1:05:52] slowly says and it came to pass after
[1:05:54] many days that the word of the Lord had
[1:05:56] come unto Elijah we know that before
[1:05:58] this Elijah had stomped his way into the
[1:06:01] the king's Palace and he he pronounced
[1:06:03] judgment on them because you've done all
[1:06:05] these things you're there won't be rain
[1:06:07] or due for three and a half years or
[1:06:08] until I call for it and all these things
[1:06:11] are going to happen and he stomped his
[1:06:12] way out and Ahab couldn't find him
[1:06:14] anywhere he searched for him and
[1:06:15] couldn't find him anywhere now it comes
[1:06:17] down to chapter 18 and it says go show
[1:06:20] thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain
[1:06:23] upon the Earth and Ahab went to show
[1:06:25] himself un unto Ahab and there was a
[1:06:28] sore famine in Samaria and Ahab called
[1:06:31] Obadiah which was the governor of his
[1:06:33] house now Obadiah feared the Lord
[1:06:34] greatly and so it was when Jezebel had
[1:06:37] cut off the prophets of the Lord that
[1:06:39] Obadiah had took 100 prophets by 50 hid
[1:06:41] them in a cave gave them bread and water
[1:06:43] and Ahab said unto Obadiah go into the
[1:06:45] land unto all The
[1:06:47] Fountains of water and all the Brooks
[1:06:50] pre- Adventure we could find grass to
[1:06:52] save the horses and mules alive that we
[1:06:54] lose not all the beasts so they divided
[1:06:57] the lamb between them begin to pass
[1:06:58] through it in verse 7 and as Obadiah was
[1:07:00] in the way behold Elijah met him and he
[1:07:03] knew him and he fell on his face and
[1:07:06] said art thou that my Lord
[1:07:10] Elijah and he answered him and said I am
[1:07:12] go tell thy Lord behold Elijah is
[1:07:16] here I love that the fact that God told
[1:07:19] the prophet go appear go appear before
[1:07:21] Ahab with a good word and he came to the
[1:07:25] one that feared
[1:07:26] God he didn't go directly to the sinful
[1:07:29] King he went to found someone that
[1:07:31] feared
[1:07:33] God and he said and he answered unto him
[1:07:35] and said I am go tell thy Lord behold
[1:07:38] Elijah's here and he said what have I
[1:07:41] sinned that thou should us deliver thy
[1:07:44] servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me
[1:07:48] as the Lord God liveth and there is no
[1:07:49] Nation or the kingdom whether the Lord
[1:07:51] hath not sent to seek thee and when they
[1:07:53] they said he is not there he took an
[1:07:56] oath of the kingdom and the nation and
[1:07:58] they found the not and now thou sayith
[1:08:01] go tell thy Lord behold Elijah's here
[1:08:04] and it came to pass as soon as I am gone
[1:08:05] out from Thee the spirit of the Lord
[1:08:07] will carry thee with thou will whether
[1:08:09] with the whether the Lord will carry
[1:08:11] thee whether I know not and so when I
[1:08:13] come to tell Ahab he cannot find thee he
[1:08:16] will slay me but I thy servant fear the
[1:08:19] lord from thy Youth and was it not told
[1:08:21] you what I did when I Jezebel slew the
[1:08:23] prophets verse 14 says and when thou
[1:08:24] sayest go tell the Lord behold Elijah is
[1:08:28] here and he shall slay me then Elijah
[1:08:30] said as the Lord of host liveth beh
[1:08:33] before whom I stand I will surely swow
[1:08:36] myself unto him today so Obadiah went to
[1:08:40] meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to
[1:08:43] meet Elijah and it came to pass that
[1:08:46] when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto
[1:08:49] him art thou he that troubleth
[1:08:52] Israel I want to just take this and
[1:08:55] maybe Point into a few things here as we
[1:08:58] look into this scripture I want to just
[1:08:59] look at it because we often read this as
[1:09:01] as history as something that's gone by
[1:09:04] and we read it in the scripture as it's
[1:09:06] recorded in the scripture but it wasn't
[1:09:08] then this was not they weren't reading
[1:09:11] off of a script Elijah wasn't reading in
[1:09:13] the Bible and Ahab reading this what
[1:09:15] should I say back no this was happening
[1:09:17] in real time this was a prophet for that
[1:09:20] day this was prophecy that was being
[1:09:22] unfolded right before their eyes that
[1:09:24] they were living and and Obadiah
[1:09:26] represented the Believers of the day and
[1:09:28] Ahab the wicked King that was there but
[1:09:30] now we find that as it begin to be
[1:09:32] unfolded Ahab had a hatred for the word
[1:09:35] for his
[1:09:37] day Ahab hated it so much he knew that
[1:09:40] the word of God said no rain will come
[1:09:42] neither will do come unless I call for
[1:09:44] it but still he begins to send out his
[1:09:47] servant and he begins to go up the other
[1:09:48] direction and say let's go find water
[1:09:51] cuz we need life we we need water we
[1:09:54] need grass we need something for our
[1:09:56] animals but I'm not going to Elijah
[1:09:59] anymore I've looked for him but he
[1:10:01] didn't look for him the right way he was
[1:10:04] constantly looking for him naturally
[1:10:06] instead of repenting had he just
[1:10:09] repented the word of God would have came
[1:10:11] back to him but because he refused to
[1:10:13] come to a place of repentance instead he
[1:10:15] said let's continue our natural way you
[1:10:17] know what the God has failed us the word
[1:10:20] has failed us let's go find our own
[1:10:22] water he come to a place where he hated
[1:10:26] hated it and and and and and but Elijah
[1:10:28] had come to such a place where maybe he
[1:10:31] had decided to have an acronym of
[1:10:33] ab anything but the message we'll find
[1:10:37] water in anything but the message
[1:10:39] because that was the message for his day
[1:10:41] was Elijah I go to anybody but Elijah
[1:10:44] and we'll find something there I want
[1:10:46] life I need life and I'll search for it
[1:10:48] anywhere but the message of the
[1:10:50] hour in Amos 8: 11 it would write behold
[1:10:54] the day comes sayeth the Lord God that I
[1:10:57] will send a famine in the land not a
[1:10:59] famine for bread nor a thirst for water
[1:11:01] but of hearing the words of the lord we
[1:11:05] know that that pertains to our day it
[1:11:07] even goes on to say and they would
[1:11:09] Wander from sea to Sea from North even
[1:11:11] to the east they would run to and fro
[1:11:13] seeking the word of the Lord and shall
[1:11:16] not find it in that day shall the fair
[1:11:18] virgins and young men faint for thirst
[1:11:21] what an awful thing that someone would
[1:11:24] search to and far to and fro far and
[1:11:27] wide east to west north to south looking
[1:11:30] for the word of the Lord when it's right
[1:11:32] in front of them when they refuse to
[1:11:35] just even get on their knees and repent
[1:11:37] as he says call upon God while he is
[1:11:40] near unto you seek him while he can be
[1:11:42] found this is our day people searching
[1:11:45] everywhere to try and find spiritual
[1:11:49] sustenance there there has been and
[1:11:51] there's going on in the secular world
[1:11:53] there's been an Awakening in the
[1:11:55] searching for for oil because their
[1:11:57] lamps have gone out it has happened all
[1:12:00] around us there's people that are
[1:12:01] searching for the truth it's been on the
[1:12:04] news it's been different place where
[1:12:05] people are waking up and realizing
[1:12:07] what's going on in the world is horrible
[1:12:09] and they've been pulling their kids out
[1:12:10] of school to homeschool them because of
[1:12:12] what's going on in the schools and
[1:12:13] they've been trying to get away from the
[1:12:15] the political uh nonsense that has been
[1:12:19] going on and and the way it's just been
[1:12:20] directing and people have been waking up
[1:12:22] to some degree but they don't know where
[1:12:24] to go they've been looking for some kind
[1:12:28] because brother brandom says there's a
[1:12:29] thirst in each and every one of our
[1:12:30] hearts it's a thirst for God but man
[1:12:33] will try to fill it with everything else
[1:12:36] they'll try and fill it with anything
[1:12:38] but the message of the hour they'll try
[1:12:40] and fill it with everything but the word
[1:12:42] of God but we have the word of God we
[1:12:46] have it in our lives we have sustenance
[1:12:48] we have been feeding for years for years
[1:12:52] Church on the unfa failing body word of
[1:12:54] the son of man we've been feeding on
[1:12:56] what we call the hidden Mana we've been
[1:12:58] feeding on the message of the hour we've
[1:13:00] been feeding on the
[1:13:02] word there's a statement brother uh
[1:13:05] brother Charles Spurgeon would make
[1:13:07] where he says people will not read their
[1:13:09] Bible but they will read
[1:13:12] you they might not go to the word of God
[1:13:15] they might not understand where they got
[1:13:16] to go but they're watching you they're
[1:13:18] watching your life they're watching the
[1:13:20] way you live they're watching the way
[1:13:21] that you dress they're watching the way
[1:13:23] that you talk they're watching the way
[1:13:24] that you conduct yourself they're
[1:13:26] watching whether God is really real to
[1:13:29] you because this first Showdown as we
[1:13:31] look at this Mount Carmel Showdown a
[1:13:33] showdown is always to prove something
[1:13:36] God brings it to a showdown to prove and
[1:13:38] in this here instance he was proving
[1:13:40] that I the Lord Jehovah am God I'm
[1:13:43] proving that God is God and people are
[1:13:46] looking at lives today at you as
[1:13:48] Believers here in newf land to say is
[1:13:50] God really still God is there really a
[1:13:53] real God still today is there really a
[1:13:56] life that can be lived in the midst of
[1:13:57] leoa is there really something that has
[1:14:00] sustenance to it that's able to bring
[1:14:02] life in a dead
[1:14:05] generation
[1:14:07] Hallelujah we have a hidden Mana though
[1:14:09] that never goes
[1:14:11] bad but it has to come back to a place
[1:14:14] again where the nations of the world and
[1:14:16] the secular Believers will search for
[1:14:18] anything but the
[1:14:21] message oh my
[1:14:24] I don't know how many times I've run
[1:14:25] into it but it's been a lot where people
[1:14:27] they want what I've got but when they
[1:14:30] realize where it comes from they don't
[1:14:33] want it
[1:14:34] anymore why because they want life but
[1:14:37] they don't want to be humbled they want
[1:14:40] life but they don't want to
[1:14:43] surrender but life and death cannot go
[1:14:46] together they cannot mix John 6:
[1:14:51] 67-69 it would say and I so appreciate
[1:14:54] the special tonight it was about this
[1:14:55] scripture as Jesus saith unto The twel
[1:14:58] Wil you go go away also then Simon Peter
[1:15:01] answered him saying Lord to whom would
[1:15:04] we go thou alone has has the words of
[1:15:06] eternal life and we believe and are sure
[1:15:10] that thou art the Christ the son of the
[1:15:12] Living God Amen this is what it was in
[1:15:14] the days of Christ we're sure that you
[1:15:17] had the words of life amen but that is
[1:15:20] not the way it is
[1:15:22] anymore because it's not us looking and
[1:15:24] trying to find a Corporal Body of Christ
[1:15:27] and trying to look into the red letters
[1:15:28] cuz if you're just going to try and live
[1:15:30] by the red letters in the Bible you're
[1:15:32] going to be disappointed cuz even in
[1:15:34] John 16: 12 and 13 right there in the
[1:15:37] red letters Jesus said I will send the
[1:15:40] comforter because there's many things
[1:15:42] that you are not able to handle right
[1:15:44] now you can't understand right now but
[1:15:47] I'll send the comforter and when you're
[1:15:49] able to understand it he will teach you
[1:15:51] all things that he hears of me in other
[1:15:53] words there's Words of Christ that
[1:15:55] aren't written in red but they're
[1:15:57] written in red of the blood Hallelujah
[1:16:00] they're written on your hearts your
[1:16:01] written Epistles read of all men amen
[1:16:05] and we find here that thousands of in
[1:16:07] the days of Jesus were happy with the
[1:16:09] Miracles but when it came to the word of
[1:16:12] God they would accept anything but the
[1:16:15] word they would rather go back to their
[1:16:17] sinful ways than to accept that Jesus
[1:16:20] Christ is God then to accept that except
[1:16:23] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[1:16:25] have no part in me then to accept that
[1:16:27] what if you see the son of man r r
[1:16:29] ascending back up into heaven from when
[1:16:31] he came to the right hand of God they
[1:16:33] couldn't accept that why because that
[1:16:35] was the word there was a lot of people
[1:16:38] in brother bram's day that hung around
[1:16:40] the message because of the Miracles they
[1:16:42] would come to the services and where are
[1:16:44] they
[1:16:46] today if they were all here the every
[1:16:48] Pew in here would be full but they were
[1:16:50] just interested in the Miracles but when
[1:16:53] it came to the opening of the word they
[1:16:55] couldn't receive it any longer they
[1:16:58] begin to go their own way their own
[1:16:59] Direction and begin to realize I don't
[1:17:01] think I can live that I don't think
[1:17:03] that's for me it just repeats itself
[1:17:05] over and over and over
[1:17:12] again it's always the word that divid
[1:17:15] that brings divisiveness amongst the
[1:17:17] masses it's the word of God that
[1:17:20] separates the sheep from the goats it's
[1:17:22] the word of God that takes the wheat
[1:17:24] from the
[1:17:26] tears in the Days of Elijah the prophet
[1:17:29] had gotten so bad before God brought it
[1:17:31] to a
[1:17:32] showdown that even those who greatly
[1:17:34] feared the Lord Obadiah have become shy
[1:17:37] to speak the word out of fear for their
[1:17:41] lives even obadi had to hide prophets in
[1:17:44] caves and when the word of for his day
[1:17:47] came right to him and said go tell Ahab
[1:17:49] he
[1:17:50] said I'm going to die if I do that
[1:17:55] because I
[1:17:56] know oh my I know if I go tell the king
[1:18:00] that you're here the spirit of God will
[1:18:02] just take you somewhere else and I'll
[1:18:03] come back here and I'll be left
[1:18:04] explaining to myself he was right here
[1:18:07] and ahab's had enough of that he'll cut
[1:18:10] my head off he'll had enough of it oh
[1:18:13] Saints the devil wants to try and trick
[1:18:15] you into that too try and take you and
[1:18:18] you know that your Jesus Christ took
[1:18:20] your healing upon him that by his
[1:18:23] Stripes you are
[1:18:24] healed he's the Healer of all your
[1:18:26] sicknesses and diseases that believe on
[1:18:29] the Lord and thy and thy house shall be
[1:18:31] saved and he wants to take those
[1:18:32] promises away from you and say you'll
[1:18:34] look like a knot if you say that you'll
[1:18:36] look like an oddball if you say that you
[1:18:38] ought never to do that you know what
[1:18:39] they'll do to you they'll kick you out
[1:18:41] of work you won't have a job you'll have
[1:18:43] no friends you'll have nobody left to go
[1:18:45] on don't say those things but God says
[1:18:48] no I'll back it up I'll be there if
[1:18:52] you'll beat me on the sacred Sands of
[1:18:54] Revelation I will meet you
[1:18:58] there
[1:19:03] Hallelujah God always brings it that way
[1:19:05] every Showdown Mount Carmel Mount
[1:19:07] Transfiguration Mount Zion these were
[1:19:10] showdowns that were always
[1:19:11] brought in a time of
[1:19:15] pressure Kel was a time of pressure of
[1:19:18] religious pressure mount Transfiguration
[1:19:21] again religious pressure pressure but
[1:19:24] also political pressure that was there
[1:19:26] where the Romans were pressuring down
[1:19:28] the
[1:19:29] people causing them to live their way
[1:19:32] but it was in a day like that God
[1:19:34] brought a showdown to prove himself
[1:19:37] again and it's in a day like our
[1:19:40] day God's bringing it to a
[1:19:42] showdown let's go on in in in in First
[1:19:47] Kings First Kings chapter 18:1 17 and it
[1:19:51] came to pass that Ahab saw a Elijah and
[1:19:53] Ahab said unto him art thou he that
[1:19:56] troubleth
[1:19:58] Israel oh
[1:20:00] my it's echoed
[1:20:03] today it's your language it's your
[1:20:06] unclos language that's troubling the
[1:20:10] people you trying to say that you're
[1:20:12] standing on the truth you're the
[1:20:14] reason oh
[1:20:16] God what does Ahab turn around and said
[1:20:19] no I haven't trouble with Israel but
[1:20:21] thou and thy father's house in that ye
[1:20:26] have forsaken the Commandments of the
[1:20:28] Lord thou and that thou H has
[1:20:31] followed
[1:20:33] balum oh my thou has followed balum the
[1:20:38] doctrine of balam all the way back from
[1:20:41] what happened in Moab and the children
[1:20:43] of Israel they were coming out what
[1:20:45] happened he said we all serve the same
[1:20:47] God we all worship the same thing let's
[1:20:50] all get together
[1:20:54] we could go into that a lot more but
[1:20:56] let's carry on I think that'll unfold
[1:20:57] more it says now forth send and gather
[1:21:00] to me all of Israel unto Mount Carmel
[1:21:02] and the prophets of Baal 450 and the
[1:21:05] prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at
[1:21:07] Jezebel's table so Ahab sent all the
[1:21:09] children of Israel and gathered the
[1:21:11] prophets and together to Mount Carmel
[1:21:13] and Elijah came unto all the people and
[1:21:15] said how long will thou halt between two
[1:21:20] opinions what a thought
[1:21:23] he's not saying how long will you hope
[1:21:25] between idols and a real living
[1:21:28] God because sometimes we read it that
[1:21:30] way like I said as history we're look at
[1:21:32] go of course I mean it was Baal it was
[1:21:34] an idol and you got and you got uh
[1:21:37] Jehovah the Unseen God and the god of
[1:21:40] Heaven the god of Earth the god of
[1:21:41] creation and you know it's pretty
[1:21:43] obvious but no it was a lot more subtle
[1:21:46] than
[1:21:47] that if I could paint in a different
[1:21:49] light what Jezebel brought was pretty
[1:21:52] churches and more beautiful
[1:21:56] women it wasn't so obvious and it wasn't
[1:21:58] just so oh this is horrible no it was
[1:22:02] pleasurable it was nice to the eyes it
[1:22:05] was nice to the flesh that's how it was
[1:22:08] at the Feast of Bale pure it wasn't
[1:22:10] something that the Children looked at
[1:22:11] and they should have looked at and said
[1:22:13] that's wrong but it was something about
[1:22:15] that caught them in their flesh and they
[1:22:17] begin to look on it and see oh that
[1:22:19] looks nice oh she's really pretty all
[1:22:22] that makeup is really nice I think I
[1:22:23] will follow after that I think I will
[1:22:25] till finally it brought in and where a
[1:22:27] prince in the house of Israel brought a
[1:22:29] daughter of one of the priest say right
[1:22:31] into the
[1:22:32] camp and decid to make love to her in
[1:22:35] his own tent right there in the Israeli
[1:22:36] camp but there was one man named Phineas
[1:22:38] that stood up that was praying there in
[1:22:41] the temple there stood Moses and there
[1:22:43] stood Joshua and there was eleazer and
[1:22:46] there was Aaron and there was Caleb and
[1:22:48] there was great man all praying before
[1:22:49] the Tabernacle saying God save us from
[1:22:52] this plag but one man previously unheard
[1:22:55] of got a hold of a revelation and
[1:22:58] realized this is wrong and he went took
[1:23:01] the javelin and he speared them right
[1:23:02] through the stomach right through both
[1:23:04] of them drove them right to the ground
[1:23:06] got rid of sin if you look at what their
[1:23:08] names actually mean their names actually
[1:23:10] mean music and
[1:23:14] false how did it start to creep into the
[1:23:17] church through a false music through a
[1:23:20] false beat and worldliness be to creep
[1:23:23] in begin to creep in begin to creep in
[1:23:25] and and and and and it was the ministry
[1:23:27] that had to stop it and say enough is
[1:23:29] enough somebody that was a part of the
[1:23:32] ministry but previously was unknown but
[1:23:34] he said stop it right
[1:23:37] here don't look for some big name we
[1:23:39] need a big name Preacher Brother Andrew
[1:23:41] we need somebody big that's going to
[1:23:42] come in and I'm waiting for that and I'm
[1:23:44] waiting for that no let somebody
[1:23:45] previously unheard of come on the scene
[1:23:48] and say God sin is enough kick it out of
[1:23:51] the camp
[1:23:53] hallelujah we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:23:55] Christ we ought not to be living and
[1:23:58] playing and toying with the things of
[1:23:59] the world and seeing how close to the
[1:24:01] world we ought to get we ought to run to
[1:24:03] the altar run to God get as close to him
[1:24:06] as we can Hallelujah I'm not talking
[1:24:09] about in a legalistic way I'm talking
[1:24:11] about allowing the spirit of God to move
[1:24:13] in our midst and wash us from every sin
[1:24:16] and unclean thing oh praise be to God we
[1:24:19] ought to allow the Lord to move in the
[1:24:21] days of Solomon it was obvious when
[1:24:24] Solomon tried to build temples for his
[1:24:27] foreign wives it was obvious the people
[1:24:29] looked at and said that's
[1:24:30] wrong it was that way in the days of
[1:24:33] brother Bram there was people that built
[1:24:35] temples that built all kinds of things
[1:24:37] that decided to make great Ministries
[1:24:38] over oil and hand and blood and here and
[1:24:41] this and that but the real people of God
[1:24:43] looked at and said no that's not quite
[1:24:45] right are you with me now but now it's
[1:24:47] become so
[1:24:49] convoluted over the generations in
[1:24:51] Israel it became so convoluted till when
[1:24:53] it came down to the days of Ahab the
[1:24:56] people were so mixed up in it it was
[1:24:59] just what everybody was
[1:25:01] doing or why do we have to be different
[1:25:04] everybody's doing this it's all
[1:25:06] throughout the land now my goodness they
[1:25:08] had a split in the church they had all
[1:25:10] kinds of things go on so after the days
[1:25:12] of Solomon 10 tribes went and split off
[1:25:14] went their own Direction and two tribes
[1:25:16] stay with the lineage of of David and
[1:25:18] well they went their own way and and
[1:25:20] then the the 10 that went away we know
[1:25:22] the king there he decided let's get some
[1:25:24] Idols going on because why does it
[1:25:26] always got to be a golden calf but it
[1:25:27] had to be a golden calf and they had to
[1:25:29] bring it down there we're going to put
[1:25:30] one in Dan and one in Ephraim we're
[1:25:32] people look at it was
[1:25:34] obvious But as time went
[1:25:36] on it be to be less and less
[1:25:42] obvious till he would even say in 2
[1:25:45] Corinthians chapter 11 says for I am
[1:25:47] jealous over you with a Godly jealousy
[1:25:50] for I have espoused you to to one
[1:25:52] husband that I may present you as a
[1:25:55] chased virgin to Christ but I fear lest
[1:25:58] by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:26:02] through his
[1:26:04] obviousness no it say through his
[1:26:08] subtility so your mind should be
[1:26:11] corrupted from the
[1:26:13] Simplicity that is in
[1:26:16] Christ he gives us such a beautiful hint
[1:26:19] right there how do you know the
[1:26:21] difference is it
[1:26:23] simple Christ is
[1:26:26] simple it's a simple
[1:26:28] gospel it's not a great big convoluted
[1:26:31] thing and you got to see it this way and
[1:26:33] this is that one and that's that let the
[1:26:35] spirit of God move accept what he's
[1:26:37] doing hear what the spirit is saying to
[1:26:39] the churches the spirit the prophet and
[1:26:41] the bride they're all saying the same
[1:26:43] thing come and drink all ye that are a
[1:26:46] thirst come and drink of the Waters of
[1:26:47] Life
[1:26:48] freely Hallelujah would say the fervent
[1:26:51] desire to please God the passion to know
[1:26:54] his word the cry for reaching out in the
[1:26:56] spirit all begins to fade and instead of
[1:26:59] the church being on fire for God it
[1:27:01] becomes cooled off and becomes a bit
[1:27:04] formal that's what has happened back
[1:27:06] there to the Ephesians they were getting
[1:27:09] a bit formal this is in the Ephesian
[1:27:10] Church age he says the abandonment to
[1:27:13] God was dying out and people weren't too
[1:27:16] careful about what God thought of them
[1:27:20] as they began to be careful about what
[1:27:22] the world thought of them oh my what a
[1:27:26] place for the church to get to that the
[1:27:27] thoughts of God start to hold less and
[1:27:30] less value they start to hold less and
[1:27:32] less weight in our lives and rather the
[1:27:34] thoughts of the world we begin to feed
[1:27:36] on those things that's where it comes
[1:27:38] from how did it creep in we opened up
[1:27:40] the gates we let down the bars brother
[1:27:43] BR says and the goats got in but how did
[1:27:45] the Sheep get out why you let down the
[1:27:47] bars stop letting down the bars and
[1:27:50] letting down the standard and letting
[1:27:51] down everything and just letting God
[1:27:53] come and letting the the devil come and
[1:27:55] we're calling it God and we're doing
[1:27:56] this and we're doing that no stay with
[1:27:58] the word that's our standard stay with
[1:28:01] the
[1:28:02] absolute Hallelujah that's why I said I
[1:28:04] appreciate a pastor that's got vision
[1:28:05] and talking to him the last few days he
[1:28:07] said I I'm staying with the word brother
[1:28:09] and said praise God stay with
[1:28:11] it
[1:28:14] Hallelujah we need to be careful what
[1:28:16] God thinks about he says that second
[1:28:17] generation coming out just like Israel
[1:28:20] they demanded to have a king to be like
[1:28:21] the other nations when they did that
[1:28:24] they rejected God Amen that's what God
[1:28:26] told Samuel said they didn't reject you
[1:28:28] Samuel they rejected me they rejected
[1:28:31] God he said but they did it anyway
[1:28:32] instead of the history that that is the
[1:28:34] history of the church when it thinks of
[1:28:36] conforming to the world instead of
[1:28:38] conforming to God it isn't long until
[1:28:40] they stop doing the things that they
[1:28:42] used to do and start doing the things
[1:28:45] that they wouldn't initially
[1:28:49] do worldliness begins creeping
[1:28:53] in the things that at once they said
[1:28:55] we'll never do that pretty soon it
[1:28:57] becomes
[1:28:59] P it's
[1:29:02] okay they get LAX he said they change
[1:29:06] their manner of
[1:29:07] dress their attitude and their
[1:29:11] behavior that is what Ephesus means is
[1:29:13] relaxed and drifting the cycle of
[1:29:16] Revival and death has never failed all
[1:29:18] you ever do all you have to do is recall
[1:29:20] the move of God in the when men and
[1:29:23] women dressed like Christians went to
[1:29:25] church prayed all night took to the
[1:29:26] street corners they weren't ashamed of
[1:29:28] the manifestations of the spirit they
[1:29:30] left their old dead churches and
[1:29:32] worshiped in homes and store old store
[1:29:34] buildings they had
[1:29:37] reality Hallelujah no I'm not preaching
[1:29:39] against having a nice church I think
[1:29:41] it's wonderful that God's given you this
[1:29:43] building before you got this building it
[1:29:45] was a
[1:29:48] storehouse it just houses a bunch of
[1:29:50] dead people but life's come in here now
[1:29:54] let's keep it that way let's invite some
[1:29:57] of those dead bones in so they can get
[1:29:59] alive Hallelujah can these Dry Bones
[1:30:02] live again absolutely they can it takes
[1:30:05] the spirit of God to breathe the breath
[1:30:07] of life into them and allow them to
[1:30:09] breathe what do it takes it takes the
[1:30:11] Senus to come upon them to bring about
[1:30:14] when Dry Bones come together it's a
[1:30:16] whole lot of
[1:30:17] noise but when the senu is beginning on
[1:30:19] what is it it's the doctrine of the
[1:30:21] message that begins to bring the bones
[1:30:23] together and put them in their rightful
[1:30:25] order then the flesh begins to come on
[1:30:27] it begins to be a holy and a Sanctified
[1:30:29] life but then the Breath of God breathes
[1:30:31] into it and it becomes a living Soul
[1:30:34] Born Again praise be to God they had
[1:30:37] reality but it wasn't a long time till
[1:30:40] they begin to have enough money to build
[1:30:41] find new churches and put a choir into
[1:30:43] singing unto God instead of themselves
[1:30:46] but put the put the gowns on the choir
[1:30:48] they organized a movement and ran it by
[1:30:50] man they soon begin to read books that
[1:30:53] just weren't fit to read oh
[1:30:56] my they soon begin to read books that
[1:30:59] just weren't fit to read I'll let your
[1:31:00] pastor decide which ones those are they
[1:31:02] let down the bars and the goats came in
[1:31:04] and took over the Cry Of Joy was
[1:31:07] gone the freedom of the spirit was gone
[1:31:11] oh they let on they They carried on with
[1:31:13] the
[1:31:14] form words they still look the same they
[1:31:17] still came to church they still sang
[1:31:19] nice songs they still had the preacher
[1:31:21] get up and preach they still closed in
[1:31:22] prayer the form was still
[1:31:25] there but the joy was gone freedom in
[1:31:28] the spirit was gone the fire died down
[1:31:31] the Blackness of Ashes is all that's
[1:31:35] left what a place to get to that is the
[1:31:38] place it was at right there when Elijah
[1:31:42] came and said Gather the
[1:31:44] people it's time for a
[1:31:47] showdown it's time to prove who really
[1:31:49] is God
[1:31:53] is it these
[1:31:55] wishy-washy emotion filled
[1:31:59] services or is it the same God yesterday
[1:32:01] today and
[1:32:06] forever as it begins to go on in in
[1:32:09] chapter 18 verse 23 he says let them
[1:32:11] give us two
[1:32:13] Bullocks let them choose one bulock for
[1:32:15] themselves and put it and cut it in
[1:32:17] pieces lay wood put no fire under it I
[1:32:19] will dress the other bulock and I will
[1:32:21] lay on the wood and no fire under it and
[1:32:24] he was to say
[1:32:25] Elijah and and you shall call on the
[1:32:28] name of your gods and I will call on the
[1:32:29] name of the Lord and we know he'd go
[1:32:31] down and and how he would go and they
[1:32:33] would come and have their great
[1:32:35] emotional service all the worship that
[1:32:38] went on that looked
[1:32:40] amazing it did they got so worked up in
[1:32:42] a frenzy the Bible records we could read
[1:32:44] it on down they started cutting
[1:32:46] themselves with lances and with knives
[1:32:48] and their blood flowing out they were
[1:32:50] sincere it looked so good and all they
[1:32:53] were doing Mad these guys they really
[1:32:55] know how to worship they called and
[1:32:56] Elijah just says call a little
[1:32:58] louder maybe he's asleep maybe he's gone
[1:33:02] on some errand maybe he's gone somewhere
[1:33:04] else he be to make a mockery of because
[1:33:06] when you have faith in who you are as a
[1:33:08] Christian you don't have to worry about
[1:33:10] what the devil's doing you don't have to
[1:33:13] worry about all of his shows that he's
[1:33:15] putting on all the Hollywood Glamour and
[1:33:17] Glitz and the drums and the light and
[1:33:18] the show and the everything else you
[1:33:20] don't have to worry about that because
[1:33:22] you're not concerned there's no God in
[1:33:24] those things there's a God of his word
[1:33:27] that believe when those who would
[1:33:29] believe on him would call on his name
[1:33:31] he'll answer Hallelujah but we find in
[1:33:34] verse 36 he says and it came to pass
[1:33:36] about the time of the offering of the
[1:33:38] evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[1:33:41] prophet came near and the Lord God of
[1:33:43] Abraham and said Lord God of Abraham
[1:33:46] Isaac and Jacob let it be known this day
[1:33:48] that thou art God of Israel what
[1:33:51] happened Elijah had built an altar he'd
[1:33:54] gone to the altar that was torn down it
[1:33:56] was wrecked everything that of proper
[1:33:59] worship was
[1:34:00] ruined but he brought out stones of
[1:34:04] Revelation and begin to rebuild that
[1:34:08] altar one stone upon another 12 Stones
[1:34:11] one for each tribe of Israel know he
[1:34:14] took the wood and he laid it on the
[1:34:15] altar he took the the the bulock and he
[1:34:18] laid it on the Altar and he said go get
[1:34:20] water
[1:34:22] go get the
[1:34:23] word get me that first
[1:34:26] pole and they brought it poured it on
[1:34:29] the altar go again a second time go get
[1:34:32] the second pole bring it all back and
[1:34:35] wash the people
[1:34:36] again Hallelujah bring the third pole
[1:34:41] fill the trenches fill it all up let it
[1:34:43] all be full of water let the word of God
[1:34:46] be so poured in he said now Lord let God
[1:34:49] show that he is still God
[1:34:52] oh my let it be so and as he said prayed
[1:34:55] in this way that I have done all these
[1:34:58] things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear
[1:35:01] me that these people may know that thou
[1:35:05] art the Lord God and that thou H has
[1:35:07] turned their heart back again oh
[1:35:11] Hallelujah I love that that he preaches
[1:35:13] it that way God is in the business of
[1:35:15] turning Hearts back again as is in our
[1:35:17] day according to Malachi chapter 4 John
[1:35:20] was sent for on the first Comm to turn
[1:35:22] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:35:23] children but now we've had a the prophet
[1:35:26] to do what three PS to turn the hearts
[1:35:28] of the F children back to the faith of
[1:35:30] the fathers God is still in that
[1:35:32] business of turning the hearts again of
[1:35:34] the people back to his original
[1:35:38] faith and as he begins to go on and he
[1:35:41] begins to read it this way hear me oh
[1:35:44] Lord then the fire fell from God then
[1:35:48] the fire of the Lord fell and cons
[1:35:51] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:35:54] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:35:58] licked up the water that was in the
[1:36:00] trench oh
[1:36:03] hallelujah what an
[1:36:05] offering what an
[1:36:07] answer I am the
[1:36:10] Lord he's proving
[1:36:12] himself and when the people saw it they
[1:36:16] fell on their
[1:36:18] faces and they said the Lord
[1:36:22] he is God the Lord he is God and Elijah
[1:36:26] said unto them take the prophets of Baal
[1:36:29] let not one of them escape and he took
[1:36:32] them down and slew them by the Brook
[1:36:35] Kishon and slew them there and Elisha
[1:36:37] said unto Ahab get up eat and drink for
[1:36:40] there is the sound of the abundance of
[1:36:47] rain
[1:36:50] Hallelujah
[1:36:57] yeah let's Carry On This Way says and
[1:37:00] Elijah and and Ahab went un to eat and
[1:37:04] to drink but Elijah went up to the top
[1:37:06] of Mount Caramel and cast himself down
[1:37:09] on the earth and put his face between
[1:37:11] his knees and said to his servant go up
[1:37:14] now look toward the sea and he went up
[1:37:18] and he looked and he said there's
[1:37:20] nothing
[1:37:22] and he said go again seven
[1:37:26] times you know what that represents
[1:37:28] seven Church
[1:37:29] ages go again go again there's a rain
[1:37:32] coming I hear the sound they heard it on
[1:37:34] Pentecost I hear the sound of the
[1:37:36] abundance of rain go and look for that
[1:37:38] cloud they went up again and looked they
[1:37:40] went up again and looked they went up
[1:37:42] again and looked irenius went and looked
[1:37:43] Columba went and looked Martin went and
[1:37:45] looked Luther went and looked Hallelujah
[1:37:48] John Wesley went and looked they got
[1:37:50] some Revelation but when it finally come
[1:37:52] down to the latter rain there comes
[1:37:54] somebody that went up and looked and
[1:37:55] said I see it now it's about the size of
[1:37:58] a man's hand Hallelujah as they went up
[1:38:01] there he said sir go up and look seven
[1:38:03] times and it came to pass on the seventh
[1:38:04] time he said behold there ariseth a
[1:38:06] little Cloud out of the sea like a man's
[1:38:09] hand and he said go up and unto Ahab
[1:38:11] prepare thy Chariot and get thee down
[1:38:14] that the rain stop thee not and it come
[1:38:16] to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven
[1:38:18] was black and the clouds and the wind
[1:38:20] and there was a great rain and Ahab rode
[1:38:23] and went to jezrael and we know that
[1:38:25] that Elijah anointed by the spirit of
[1:38:26] God outran the Chariots of of Ahab
[1:38:30] Hallelujah I want to just read this in
[1:38:32] the message look brother Brenham says
[1:38:33] the sign of the hand in the sky Elijah
[1:38:36] said that cloud was the size of a man's
[1:38:38] hand like a vapor what was it he kept on
[1:38:43] believing that might be all it is to you
[1:38:45] that might be all it is to you tonight
[1:38:47] all the message is is it's about the
[1:38:49] size of a man's hand I don't have a lot
[1:38:50] of re ration God hasn't given me a lot
[1:38:52] but I see something if you see something
[1:38:55] hold on to that and keep believing
[1:38:57] because brother ROM says this he says
[1:38:59] that cloud soon became two clouds and
[1:39:02] those clouds become a hill and the hill
[1:39:04] become a mountain of clouds and the
[1:39:06] mountain become Another Mountain of
[1:39:07] clouds and the first thing you know the
[1:39:09] whole Skies was thering and the rain was
[1:39:11] falling what was it he accepted what God
[1:39:16] sent Hallelujah God sends his word to
[1:39:20] those who fear Him him he will send his
[1:39:22] word to you if you're seeking him day
[1:39:25] and night he says if you'll seek me I
[1:39:27] will be found of you those who hunger
[1:39:28] and thirst after righteousness they
[1:39:30] shall be filled amen we got all these
[1:39:32] precious promises but keep believing and
[1:39:35] when God sends it whatever he sends to
[1:39:37] you be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:39:39] Jesus Christ if that's all he says
[1:39:41] accept it that's a doorway that you can
[1:39:44] walk through and then another one comes
[1:39:46] and then another one comes and it begins
[1:39:48] to build up into two clouds three clouds
[1:39:51] into a hill of clouds into a mountain of
[1:39:53] clouds into two mountains of clouds so
[1:39:55] pretty soon your left's laying there
[1:39:56] going oh God it's so much I can't even
[1:39:59] comprehend the greatness of God every
[1:40:02] time I think about it and step into the
[1:40:04] word of God it becomes overwhelming the
[1:40:06] Revelation that he begins to pour out
[1:40:08] why because I accepted it over and over
[1:40:12] and over and over that whatever he would
[1:40:14] send I said yes
[1:40:16] Lord that's for
[1:40:19] me Hallelujah Mary accepted that little
[1:40:25] word she said thou has found favor with
[1:40:28] the Lord you'll conceive and bring forth
[1:40:31] a son what dides she
[1:40:33] say be it unto me according to Thy
[1:40:36] word and that little statement brought
[1:40:38] forth something that we now sing a song
[1:40:40] Mary Did You Know She had no
[1:40:44] idea that her little boy would walk on
[1:40:48] water Mary didn't know
[1:40:52] she didn't have a
[1:40:53] clue she was no mother of
[1:40:58] God let me say that again in what was a
[1:41:00] Catholic Church Mary was not the mother
[1:41:02] of
[1:41:04] God
[1:41:07] hallelujah this ain't no Catholic church
[1:41:09] anymore this is a message church this is
[1:41:13] the lot of the hour don't never fear
[1:41:17] that Mary didn't
[1:41:19] know all she knew is I'm to have a
[1:41:22] child she baby was pondering on those
[1:41:25] scriptures for baby she was looking at
[1:41:27] it and she didn't really understand what
[1:41:30] Isaiah was talking about when he said H
[1:41:32] my or what David talking about they by
[1:41:34] bones they stare at
[1:41:36] me he didn't understand what Isaiah was
[1:41:38] talking about when they was bruised for
[1:41:40] my
[1:41:41] iniquity he didn't understand what he
[1:41:43] was talking about when it pleased God to
[1:41:45] bruise him he didn't understand what
[1:41:47] he's talking about there was no Beauty
[1:41:48] in him that we should desire him but to
[1:41:50] her was just a little
[1:41:53] baby just the
[1:41:55] sweetness and before that it was just a
[1:41:58] word it's something inside of her begin
[1:42:01] to grow that she didn't
[1:42:04] understand she was just a little maybe
[1:42:06] about 17year Old girl something begin to
[1:42:09] live in her something begin to change in
[1:42:12] her something begin to come and through
[1:42:14] the travail of birth there come a baby
[1:42:16] down in a stable in a way that she's
[1:42:19] probably sitting there going like any
[1:42:21] mother would
[1:42:23] think I've birthed the son but I wish it
[1:42:26] was better I wish I had a better place I
[1:42:28] wish I had a a more fancier place or a
[1:42:30] better place to welcome my child into
[1:42:32] the
[1:42:33] Earth how many of you mothers that are
[1:42:35] here would love to have a baby in a
[1:42:37] stable no none of you you go no please
[1:42:41] give me a nice clean hospital room or
[1:42:43] something really nice and clean and and
[1:42:45] and something where my child will be
[1:42:46] safe and I know I'm not worried about
[1:42:47] germs and diseases or anything else I'd
[1:42:49] like something safe I'm sure Mary wanted
[1:42:51] the same thing but God brought it about
[1:42:53] in such a simple way such a humble way
[1:42:58] and she would took so much care over
[1:43:00] that child that when he grew up to be
[1:43:02] about 12 years old he was found in the
[1:43:04] temple what was she doing frantically
[1:43:07] searching for what to her was her
[1:43:10] son she had no idea she got there and
[1:43:13] she finally found him and said your
[1:43:15] father and I have sought you with
[1:43:17] tears and he just turns around 12 years
[1:43:19] old and says know you not that I must be
[1:43:21] about my father's
[1:43:23] business she'd
[1:43:25] forgot over the course of 12 years but
[1:43:29] God had something more for
[1:43:32] her and as he come down and all of the
[1:43:35] ministry that he had I'm sure she seen
[1:43:37] him as he labored with the people he was
[1:43:40] a man about 30 years old but he looked
[1:43:42] beyond that about 50 years old and he
[1:43:46] looked much older than he was why
[1:43:47] because of the strain that the ministry
[1:43:49] put on him as he prayed for people and
[1:43:51] as he poured out his heart for people
[1:43:53] and as there was healing after healing
[1:43:54] after Vision after Vision after all
[1:43:57] kinds of things that was going on with
[1:43:58] that all he did said I do nothing but
[1:44:00] what the father shows me he was
[1:44:01] constantly in prayer night after night
[1:44:04] after day after night while staying in
[1:44:06] perfect touch with the spirit that was
[1:44:07] within
[1:44:08] him so he could come to that place and
[1:44:11] he come right down and as she stood
[1:44:13] there before him at the cross looking up
[1:44:16] at
[1:44:18] him her baby
[1:44:22] dying
[1:44:24] crucified the most horrible
[1:44:27] death little did she
[1:44:29] know there was something greater to
[1:44:33] come she was about to have something
[1:44:35] else come inside of
[1:44:37] her something greater than a 9-month
[1:44:42] child something greater than a 9month
[1:44:45] pregnancy it was going to last a
[1:44:48] lifetime she got into an upper room
[1:44:51] with the disciples with 120 of them
[1:44:53] there she finally got up there in upper
[1:44:55] room she didn't understand but she began
[1:44:59] to pray just like the rest of them she
[1:45:01] began to get real just like the rest
[1:45:03] well how did it start be it unto me
[1:45:05] according to Thy word she accepted that
[1:45:09] she accepted when he re she realized he
[1:45:12] must be about the father's business she
[1:45:14] accepted when she realized he has to go
[1:45:16] other places and preach she accepted
[1:45:19] when he realized in my own country I
[1:45:20] cannot do many miracles because a
[1:45:21] prophet is not without honor except in
[1:45:23] his own country she accepted when she
[1:45:25] realized he has to go to the cross and
[1:45:26] die she accepted all these things but
[1:45:28] now as God begin to come down into
[1:45:30] something that was even
[1:45:33] greater she begin to come and
[1:45:35] accept the holy ghost that come down on
[1:45:39] the day of
[1:45:40] Pentecost just started with something so
[1:45:43] small and grew and grew and grew just
[1:45:49] like it was in that first Showdown
[1:45:51] down to prove that Jehovah is
[1:45:55] God Baal was the greatest of Idols was
[1:45:59] the the king of the Gods but nothing it
[1:46:03] was nothing but a lie in the framework
[1:46:05] of the
[1:46:06] church it was in the framework of the
[1:46:09] Jews
[1:46:12] Israel but God came to prove himself to
[1:46:15] his
[1:46:16] people and all they needed to do was to
[1:46:20] accept that God is still
[1:46:24] God and accept what God sends and he
[1:46:28] made it
[1:46:29] real God sent it with a cloud and a
[1:46:33] pillar of fire in that day what happened
[1:46:36] with the sacrifice Pillar of Fire came
[1:46:38] down consumed the altar consumed the
[1:46:40] sacrifice consumed the wood consumed the
[1:46:42] dust left nothing but a burnt hole on
[1:46:44] the
[1:46:46] ground and a cloud came Hallelujah it's
[1:46:50] that way in every
[1:46:52] showdown in The Showdown on Mount
[1:46:54] Transfiguration there was a cloud and
[1:46:55] there was a pillar of fire in our
[1:46:56] Showdown there's a cloud there's a
[1:46:57] pillar of fire we'll get into that more
[1:46:59] this weekend Lord
[1:47:00] willing but God will always prove it and
[1:47:03] make it real I want to take a step and
[1:47:05] go into job as I'm I'm trying to wind it
[1:47:06] down we've been about an
[1:47:08] hour
[1:47:10] job when he was in his deepest of
[1:47:13] distress as it said these showdowns they
[1:47:16] come at the greatest pressure at a time
[1:47:19] of great pressure
[1:47:20] on the True Believer job when he was in
[1:47:23] the deepest of his distress when all of
[1:47:25] his riches had gone from him his
[1:47:28] children was dead his body was broke out
[1:47:30] in boils it was the greatest distress
[1:47:32] that he had he was ever in setting on an
[1:47:34] ash Heap with a Croc SC scraping his
[1:47:39] boils and his wife at the door why don't
[1:47:42] you just Curse God and die what did job
[1:47:45] say th speakest as a foolish woman even
[1:47:48] in that state he kept his character or
[1:47:51] I'll say his character kept him and when
[1:47:54] the members of the church had turned
[1:47:56] their backs on him 7even days and
[1:47:58] accused him why they ought to have been
[1:48:01] comforting him but they were accusing
[1:48:02] him of being a secret Center accusing
[1:48:05] him of being a backslider it was in that
[1:48:08] dark hour it was in that great moment it
[1:48:11] was that time when God took job to the
[1:48:14] sacred Sands where he takes every
[1:48:16] believer to an experience onto the
[1:48:19] backside of the desert
[1:48:20] he says just like he did with Moses out
[1:48:23] into a little secret closet where he
[1:48:25] could to where he took you where he took
[1:48:27] brother bradam into a little Coal Shed
[1:48:29] where he received it God has a place and
[1:48:32] a purpose and a Time Hallelujah God is
[1:48:36] Sovereign in all that he does God will
[1:48:38] reveal himself to whom he will reveal to
[1:48:40] them in the season that he will reveal
[1:48:43] it to them he's Sovereign in all that he
[1:48:45] does he doesn't he's not bound by the
[1:48:47] morals of man and man will decide by
[1:48:49] their own moral compass whether God is
[1:48:52] good or not but God is the very
[1:48:54] definition of morality cuz he can do as
[1:48:56] he pleases he's
[1:48:58] God Amen he's the creator of the heavens
[1:49:01] and earth why did he create us for
[1:49:03] Fellowship he desired to have fellowship
[1:49:05] with a being like an unto himself so he
[1:49:07] created man in his own image it was
[1:49:09] because of his desire that we are here
[1:49:12] it's because of his attributes that he
[1:49:14] we are able to stand in this day and be
[1:49:16] Believers and to receive the truth
[1:49:18] because he predestinated us to the
[1:49:20] adoption of
[1:49:22] sons amen and he desires to bring us out
[1:49:25] to a place what brother would call
[1:49:27] sacred Sands where he could meet us
[1:49:29] there and when he had job in this
[1:49:31] condition he had him on the sacred sense
[1:49:33] he was going to reveal something to him
[1:49:36] that would never go away Hallelujah
[1:49:39] that's just exactly the way Revelation
[1:49:42] is once God has revealed himself to you
[1:49:44] personally there was nobody that could
[1:49:46] talk you out of it Hallelujah no one
[1:49:49] could twist in your mind because God
[1:49:50] himself has come down and given you his
[1:49:53] word and it will not return unto him
[1:49:56] void it will do that which he has
[1:49:58] purposed it to do it will manifest
[1:50:00] himself in The
[1:50:02] Believer hallelujah oh my and that's the
[1:50:05] way Revelation is that God that's re
[1:50:08] that is what Revelation is that is what
[1:50:10] the new birth is it's a revelation of
[1:50:12] Jesus Christ personally to you amen that
[1:50:16] when he personally reveals himself he
[1:50:18] bursts you into a Kingdom by his Spirit
[1:50:22] hallelujah oh those sacred Sands he has
[1:50:24] to take every real child there he gets
[1:50:27] you out into those places where no devil
[1:50:30] can ever come oh what a place to be out
[1:50:34] there in a place where no devil could
[1:50:35] ever come we could talk about it where
[1:50:37] brother bam talks in the inter Veil how
[1:50:39] it is when a Believer crosses over
[1:50:41] Beyond the Veil and he begins to come
[1:50:43] into the shikina glory of God the
[1:50:45] holiest of holies the veil drops around
[1:50:48] him he says and the Veil that drops
[1:50:50] around him is a spiritual Veil and he
[1:50:52] says there's nothing else can enter into
[1:50:55] that Veil it's you and God Alone amen
[1:50:58] where he speaks to you and he begins to
[1:51:00] whisper his little secrets to you
[1:51:03] personally oh Hallelujah he gives you
[1:51:06] something on those Sands back there that
[1:51:08] of an experience that you'll never
[1:51:10] forget as long as the ages roll roll on
[1:51:12] and no matter how athetic your mother or
[1:51:14] your daddy or your husband or your wife
[1:51:16] or your children or your Associates may
[1:51:18] become every True Believer has that spot
[1:51:21] where God has met him and there isn't
[1:51:24] one thing there isn't one left out every
[1:51:27] believer has it that's very emphatic of
[1:51:30] what every believer has that experience
[1:51:33] with God where you got alone with God
[1:51:35] and you get there alone with him and He
[1:51:38] makes himself
[1:51:40] real and let me tell you this is not the
[1:51:42] same as the person sitting next to
[1:51:44] you your testimony is your
[1:51:48] testimony God revealed RS himself
[1:51:50] personally to you even from a husband to
[1:51:54] a wife and I'm so happy to have my wife
[1:51:55] here with me tonight but our testimonies
[1:51:57] are different of how God came by our way
[1:52:00] and how God made himself real to us
[1:52:03] personally why because it's an
[1:52:04] individual walk with God and you can't
[1:52:07] compare with anyone else well that
[1:52:08] brother spoke in tongu that's nice
[1:52:10] that's what God did for him well that
[1:52:11] brother over there prophesied that's
[1:52:13] nice that's what God did for him that
[1:52:14] brother over there he became a preacher
[1:52:16] that's nice that's what God did for them
[1:52:17] but what's God doing for you amen
[1:52:20] because it's personal and it's
[1:52:21] individual every testimony is not
[1:52:23] comparable to the other there's only one
[1:52:26] similarity that was it was
[1:52:28] Christ it had to be you look to Christ
[1:52:32] and Christ came by your way and he comes
[1:52:35] in his own special
[1:52:37] time in his own special way he did
[1:52:41] something to that believer that up there
[1:52:43] the
[1:52:45] mentality in the presence Oh my he talks
[1:52:48] about Moses every person that's has born
[1:52:50] to the kingdom of God knows that spot
[1:52:51] that minute that hour where God took him
[1:52:53] and on those sacred Sands in the
[1:52:55] presence of the burning bush he did
[1:52:57] something to that believer that all the
[1:52:58] mentality of the world could not destroy
[1:53:02] he says Upon This Rock what is it
[1:53:04] Revelation I'll build my church and the
[1:53:06] Gates of Hell will not destroy it upon
[1:53:08] the rock the spiritual revelation of the
[1:53:10] resurrected Jesus job in his distress
[1:53:13] everything gone his wife turned against
[1:53:15] him accused him all of his believer
[1:53:17] friends had turned against him because
[1:53:19] they only had Theology and the rest had
[1:53:22] turned against them but God said come
[1:53:24] here

[1:53:54] Move you let me tell you this Satan does
[1:53:56] not have access to your
[1:53:59] soul Satan chose the battleground of the
[1:54:02] Mind God chose the soul and you either
[1:54:05] have faith or doubt in the soul you
[1:54:07] choose that's your free moral agency
[1:54:10] whether you believe God and accept what
[1:54:11] he sent to you or whether you doubt it
[1:54:14] that's your choice Satan cannot access
[1:54:16] that there's a place where God could
[1:54:18] seal you away as the new birth is a seal
[1:54:20] until the day of your Redemption and
[1:54:22] seal you away so no devil could ever
[1:54:25] enter there oh praise be to

[1:55:00] curtain to show you his resurrected
[1:55:03] power that's what he wants to show you
[1:55:06] tonight he wants to show you his
[1:55:07] resurrected power you know that he lives
[1:55:10] that as job can cry out I know my
[1:55:12] redeemer liveth and at the last day he
[1:55:15] will stand on the earth and even if the
[1:55:17] skin worms destroy this flesh yet in my
[1:55:19] flesh I shall see God what a revelation
[1:55:22] job was given there by God it's the same
[1:55:24] Revelation he gives us today by a new
[1:55:26] birth when we realize Jesus Christ is
[1:55:29] not only resurrected but because he
[1:55:31] lives I live also Hallelujah and because
[1:55:34] he cannot die I cannot die because it's
[1:55:37] his spirit in me it's not me but I've
[1:55:39] received the spirit of adoption
[1:55:42] hallelujah oh Saints when Elijah
[1:55:45] revealed to Obadiah don't fear I'll be
[1:55:48] right here waiting for for the king then
[1:55:50] Obadiah could go with confidence to the
[1:55:52] king knowing the word for the day was
[1:55:55] about to be brought to
[1:55:57] pass Hallelujah all that he'd been
[1:55:59] praying for all that he was seeking God
[1:56:02] for was about to be accomplished I
[1:56:05] imagine OB die as a man that feared God
[1:56:07] those three and a half years he wasn't
[1:56:09] just walking about frivolously but he
[1:56:10] was on his knees before God how long
[1:56:12] will this go on how long will the people
[1:56:14] Hal between two opinions how long will
[1:56:16] this happen oh God send your word send
[1:56:19] your word send your word accomplish your
[1:56:21] word fulfill it Lord he was on his knees
[1:56:24] praying it was the same way with the
[1:56:26] children of Israel when they were there
[1:56:27] in captivity for 400 years when they
[1:56:29] begin to call upon God then God sent a
[1:56:33] deliverer oh praise be to God what about
[1:56:35] you and I tonight Saints we're looking
[1:56:37] for a Rapture we're looking for a
[1:56:39] resurrection we're looking for the power
[1:56:41] of God that's in you and I to raise the
[1:56:43] Dead from the grave we're looking for
[1:56:45] that brother that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:56:47] was given for we're looking for those
[1:56:49] things aren't you looking for that we
[1:56:52] want to see a real living God say well
[1:56:54] I've seen him brother Andrew I seen
[1:56:56] testimonies I've got testimonies I'm
[1:56:58] still not satisfied I want more I want
[1:57:02] more of God yes I want more miracles but
[1:57:04] I'm not looking for miracles I'm looking
[1:57:07] to accept God on the basis of his
[1:57:09] presence Hallelujah to allow God to move
[1:57:13] in our midst to allow him let's let's be
[1:57:16] abandoned to the word of God
[1:57:19] abandon the world in all of its ways
[1:57:21] forget about
[1:57:24] it when God proved to him don't
[1:57:28] fear he could walk with confidence that
[1:57:31] God was about to prove himself to the
[1:57:34] nation that's what the sacred Sands is
[1:57:37] to every believer God proving personally
[1:57:39] to you he's still
[1:57:42] God and he's Sovereign in his ways he'll
[1:57:45] do as he pleases there's such a joy and
[1:57:48] such a peace in that revelation
[1:57:50] you can realize that and come to such a
[1:57:52] revelation that God is
[1:57:56] God that's so simple but it's a
[1:57:59] revelation the world don't believe
[1:58:02] that they don't they believe anything
[1:58:06] else there might be some higher power
[1:58:08] there is no God there's this there's
[1:58:10] that secular world doesn't even really
[1:58:12] believe that God is God because if they
[1:58:14] did they'd believe in miracles too they
[1:58:16] believe the God of this Bible if they
[1:58:19] believe that God is God but it's a
[1:58:22] revelation that's poured upon you a
[1:58:24] showdown that God gives to every
[1:58:26] believer I'm still the same yesterday
[1:58:29] today and
[1:58:31] forever and I will not
[1:58:35] change and you could lay a hold in that
[1:58:39] because you have an anchor in Jesus
[1:58:41] Christ within the
[1:58:44] veil and we
[1:58:46] know the scripture says by these two
[1:58:48] immutable things one God cannot
[1:58:52] lie
[1:58:54] Hallelujah God cannot
[1:58:56] lie if he said thy and thy house will be
[1:58:58] saved thy and thy house will be saved if
[1:59:01] you will believe if he said by his
[1:59:04] stripes you will be healed you are
[1:59:05] healed already you are already healed
[1:59:09] Hallelujah if he said that I've T borne
[1:59:12] all of your
[1:59:13] iniquities oh my you mean the things
[1:59:16] that I knew better and I went and did it
[1:59:18] anyway he bore that yes he
[1:59:21] did he does not
[1:59:24] lie even though you might have an
[1:59:26] unrighteous thought if you'll turn from
[1:59:28] that thought and repent of it and turn
[1:59:30] to God he will
[1:59:32] abundantly pardon you he will give you
[1:59:36] life Everlasting I don't care how young
[1:59:38] you are or how old you are God is
[1:59:42] God and he cares for
[1:59:46] you let's stand to our feet as musicians
[1:59:48] come
[1:59:54] if I could express that to you your life
[1:59:57] is in God's
[2:00:00] hands it's in the hands of the one who's
[2:00:03] able discern to discern between the
[2:00:05] thoughts and intents of the heart
[2:00:07] Jeremiah 29 says for I know that the
[2:00:10] thoughts that I think toward you sayith
[2:00:11] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[2:00:14] evil to give you an expected
[2:00:18] end then then shall you call upon me and
[2:00:20] you shall go and pray unto me and I will
[2:00:22] hearken unto you and you shall seek me
[2:00:26] and find me and you shall search for me
[2:00:28] with all of your heart and I will be
[2:00:31] found of you saeth the Lord and I will
[2:00:34] turn away your captivity I will gather
[2:00:37] you from the Nations and from all the
[2:00:38] places from whether I have driven you
[2:00:40] sayeth the Lord and I will bring you
[2:00:42] again into a place whence I caused you
[2:00:46] to be carried away
[2:00:47] captive you came from God you're going
[2:00:51] back to
[2:00:53] God you might have been thrown out here
[2:00:56] and thrown out there but God's Gathering
[2:00:58] back in
[2:01:00] again say Let The Trials

[2:01:14] Heartbreak we're not resting in our own

[2:06:59] mountain this
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:04] mountain by my spirit sayi the
[2:07:11] Lord amen I enjoyed that this evening
[2:07:13] and just to calm you brother Andrew I'm
[2:07:17] not going to repeat your sermon but
[2:07:18] there is a couple things I love to you
[2:07:20] know when a minister preaches I love to
[2:07:22] just dry out some of those highlights
[2:07:23] and I love what he said he says God's
[2:07:25] words are spoken with purpose and next
[2:07:27] to my Bible I'd already written there
[2:07:29] purposeful God doesn't speak idly but he
[2:07:33] sends it with purpose but what I loved
[2:07:35] is that if you see he sends it Like
[2:07:38] Rain which is immediate watering but he
[2:07:41] sends snow you know where snow goes It
[2:07:43] goes up in the mountains and it waits
[2:07:45] for the dry season so that as it warms
[2:07:48] up and the dry season it comes down and
[2:07:50] it Waters that which doesn't get any
[2:07:52] rain so he provides for the wet season
[2:07:54] he provides for the dry season but what
[2:07:56] I love more than that is he always has a
[2:07:58] good seed ready to receive it we look
[2:08:01] around so often and we see all the bad
[2:08:03] that's going on and we we we see what
[2:08:05] people are doing with the word of God
[2:08:07] and we see what they're not doing with
[2:08:08] the word of God and all these things but
[2:08:10] there's always a good seed to receive
[2:08:12] what God has sent amen and it produces
[2:08:14] the life that he ordained regardless of
[2:08:16] what Satan's trying to do to mess it all
[2:08:18] up
[2:08:19] amen he said a showdown is to prove
[2:08:21] something it's not to prove me it's to
[2:08:24] prove that God's real amen I love what
[2:08:26] brother bam he says he says to overcome
[2:08:28] is to recognize Satan in every one of
[2:08:30] his tricks and to know that greater is
[2:08:33] he that is in you than he that's in the
[2:08:36] world he says when you start doing the
[2:08:38] things you used to not do very soon you
[2:08:40] stop doing the things of God you used to
[2:08:42] do and we lose the reality of God we
[2:08:44] were fellowshipping and we were talking
[2:08:45] about something and I I said this is the
[2:08:47] way I approach those things did the
[2:08:49] spirit of God that told you not to do
[2:08:52] now come back and tell you to do it does
[2:08:55] God tell you not to do it and then tell
[2:08:56] you to do something is it wrong one day
[2:08:58] and right the next if God tells us it's
[2:09:00] wrong then why are we picking it up
[2:09:02] again amen the spirit of God doesn't
[2:09:04] come back and make it right if it's
[2:09:05] wrong it's wrong it's if it's right it's
[2:09:07] right and he doesn't go back and forth
[2:09:09] amen I love what he said when you have
[2:09:11] faith in the word of God you don't have
[2:09:13] to worry what Satan might
[2:09:15] do Elijah wasn't worried that Satan was
[2:09:18] to produce fire Satan can't produce fire
[2:09:20] Satan can't consume these things he knew
[2:09:23] who he was he knew who God was and so he
[2:09:26] had total faith in that I love how he
[2:09:28] brought out the cloud started small but
[2:09:30] it grew because Elijah had faith in the
[2:09:33] word of God that said I'm going to make
[2:09:35] it rain and he stayed there and even
[2:09:38] though the man came back gesi came back
[2:09:40] six times saying nothing is there the
[2:09:42] seventh time he comes back and he sees
[2:09:44] something and it's so small but Elijah's
[2:09:46] faith says there's still a the sound of
[2:09:48] abundance of rain go tell Ahab to get
[2:09:50] out cuz it's going to get bad in a hurry
[2:09:52] and pretty soon he says the skies are
[2:09:54] full and they're dark and all these
[2:09:56] different things what is it the word
[2:09:57] came to pass Elijah stayed there until
[2:09:59] what he believed happened until what God
[2:10:01] told him would happen would happen but I
[2:10:04] think the thing that was the the most
[2:10:05] beautiful in all this was how he
[2:10:07] finished you notice that he said job saw
[2:10:09] the answer to his
[2:10:12] question and the answer to his need
[2:10:16] thousands of years before it would ever
[2:10:17] occur
[2:10:19] and yet in seeing that answer and having
[2:10:21] that Revelation job said I can die in
[2:10:25] peace because I know that in the last
[2:10:27] day he'll rais me up he could die he had
[2:10:29] a rest and he had an assurance knowing
[2:10:31] that the answer was given to him he had
[2:10:33] a revelation that God would not leave
[2:10:35] his soul in Hell nor that he would see
[2:10:37] corruption amen that God would restore
[2:10:39] him back to his original condition just
[2:10:41] like those flowers were he could have
[2:10:43] rest because God had given him a
[2:10:44] revelation you're in the palm of my
[2:10:46] hands I won't leave you behind amen that
[2:10:48] was beautiful brother Andrew certainly
[2:10:50] enjoyed that let's sing that song when I
[2:10:53] think about the Lord I don't know the
[2:10:55] number sorry but I believe we know
[2:10:59] it when I think
[2:11:03] about the
[2:11:06] Lord how he saved me how he raised me
[2:11:13] how he filled me with the whole Holy
[2:11:19] Ghost how he healed me to the
[2:11:25] uttermost and when I think
[2:11:29] about the
[2:11:32] Lord how he pick me up and turn me
