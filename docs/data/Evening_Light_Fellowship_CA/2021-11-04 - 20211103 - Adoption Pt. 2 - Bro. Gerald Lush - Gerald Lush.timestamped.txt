[1:00:47] i believe grace
[1:00:49] amen and amen praise the lord god bless
[1:00:53] you
[1:00:55] turn with me to a scripture i think
[1:00:56] maybe we read in the last
[1:00:58] message
[1:00:59] we read it again in the book of
[1:01:01] galatians chapter four
[1:01:03] the prophet of god has made reference to
[1:01:05] this scripture
[1:01:07] in his
[1:01:08] emphasis on adoption amen galatians
[1:01:12] chapter 4
[1:01:16] and let's begin to read at the first
[1:01:18] verse amen
[1:01:20] galatians 4.
[1:01:31] now i say
[1:01:34] that the hair as long as he is a child
[1:01:37] different nothing from a servant
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:42] i trust we've matured
[1:01:44] that we're not children
[1:01:45] we're not babies
[1:01:47] amen but we're sons and daughters
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:51] and it says but the child different
[1:01:53] nothing from a servant though he be lord
[1:01:56] of all
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] he has to be trained
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:02] and brother silva is with us as the seed
[1:02:04] of god that
[1:02:05] for the resurrection for the rapture god
[1:02:08] has brought us to that through that
[1:02:09] phase of training amen to so that we're
[1:02:12] going to mature as sons and daughters of
[1:02:14] god amen not just babies no no not just
[1:02:18] again as we refer to children but sons
[1:02:21] and daughters matured
[1:02:23] but he said
[1:02:26] is under tutors and governors until the
[1:02:30] time appointed of the father
[1:02:33] even so we
[1:02:34] when we were children
[1:02:36] we were in bondage under the elements of
[1:02:40] the world
[1:02:41] but we're getting to that place where
[1:02:43] the world has no influence on us
[1:02:46] we're getting to that place where our
[1:02:48] hunger and thirst
[1:02:50] is for the new heaven and the new earth
[1:02:52] amen for glory
[1:02:55] amen to be back with our heavenly father
[1:02:58] god help us to give us the revelation
[1:03:01] that's creating us that hunger and that
[1:03:03] thirst to be back with him
[1:03:05] amen to believe that's where we come
[1:03:07] from and that's where we're going
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:11] verse 4 but when the fullness of the
[1:03:14] time was come
[1:03:16] god sent forth his son
[1:03:19] made of a woman
[1:03:21] made under the law
[1:03:22] to redeem
[1:03:24] them that were under the law
[1:03:27] that we might
[1:03:28] receive the adoption of sons
[1:03:33] amen
[1:03:35] by the grace of god god bless his word
[1:03:38] you may be seated
[1:03:41] turn with me to the book of romans
[1:03:44] chapter 8.
[1:03:47] romans chapter 8.
[1:03:51] in his messages concerning adoption the
[1:03:53] prophet did refer to the
[1:03:56] scriptures we read in galatians
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:00] and to other scriptures as well
[1:04:03] but we want to emphasize galatians
[1:04:07] of what god has done why god did it amen
[1:04:11] to bring us to the reality and the
[1:04:12] revelation of adoption
[1:04:15] amen it's not that we're hoping this and
[1:04:18] hoping that but it's it's a finished
[1:04:19] work not only that brother it's speaking
[1:04:22] of the adoption of sons and daughters
[1:04:25] amen the prophet is highlighting that
[1:04:27] they are the sons of god they are the
[1:04:29] daughters of god and and he's adopting
[1:04:31] them amen because why because god will
[1:04:34] either cut them off or god is going to
[1:04:36] bring them back amen god is going to
[1:04:39] either move the messiah or he's going to
[1:04:41] bring them in and and give him the
[1:04:43] giving them the authority of sons and
[1:04:46] daughters amen oh yeah and there are
[1:04:49] those that are that are that are not
[1:04:51] that are not anointed with that
[1:04:52] anointing yet they're out there oh yeah
[1:04:55] this is where they come from that's
[1:04:56] where they're going but they're not
[1:04:58] as if we're adopted you've got the the
[1:05:00] ministry or the or the anointing of
[1:05:02] adoption where god is bringing them back
[1:05:05] amen to sit with him in his throne amen
[1:05:09] so i pray the grace of god brother that
[1:05:11] we're not just going to be outside the
[1:05:13] city i trust by grace we're going to be
[1:05:15] in the city amen and we're laying our
[1:05:17] lives down amen by the grace of god to
[1:05:20] give more and more control to jesus amen
[1:05:24] because i believe that the ones that
[1:05:25] jesus is going is controlling is going
[1:05:27] to be in the city they're going to sit
[1:05:29] with him in his throne amen because
[1:05:32] they've been toted they've been they've
[1:05:34] been trained amen oh yeah or we train
[1:05:37] them the lord they're trained and then
[1:05:39] all they they act like sons they talk
[1:05:41] like sons amen or they feel they have
[1:05:44] the authority of a son amen brother if
[1:05:47] you go if you're adopted praise the lord
[1:05:49] the prophet of god said adoption is
[1:05:51] bringing the son and daughter into a
[1:05:53] place of authority amen amen as we as we
[1:05:56] read there in the scriptures amen oh yes
[1:05:59] uh oh oh master oh this is a good song
[1:06:03] and this is a good daughter we train
[1:06:04] them and train them and oh yeah they do
[1:06:06] well
[1:06:07] amen they recognize their authority they
[1:06:09] recognize their position they know who
[1:06:11] they are amen you'd have no words about
[1:06:14] them amen brother lord or they would say
[1:06:17] master they respect you they know who
[1:06:19] you are amen and now you know who they
[1:06:21] are
[1:06:22] amen praise the lord
[1:06:24] oh yeah because the bible says it is
[1:06:27] giving us the revelation of sons and
[1:06:29] daughters being trained amen and the
[1:06:32] sons that are being trained amen so now
[1:06:35] they can come in and then or they can
[1:06:38] exercise the authority that their father
[1:06:39] exercises praise the lord amen they have
[1:06:43] access to what the father has access to
[1:06:46] oh yeah why because oh yeah you're
[1:06:48] trained you're good they said you're
[1:06:50] good and you were mature and you're this
[1:06:52] you're that so come on in son and you
[1:06:54] can have this i want you to do this i
[1:06:56] want you to do that amen
[1:06:58] amen brother that's what god has done
[1:07:00] all the way down through the ages amen
[1:07:02] he brought his sons and daughters in he
[1:07:04] gave them the revelation of his word
[1:07:06] amen and he held them responsible
[1:07:09] amen for the word
[1:07:12] and they were then there were these sons
[1:07:13] and daughters that they went out and
[1:07:15] then they lived the word they went out
[1:07:17] amen and they obeyed the word amen the
[1:07:20] oh yeah they enforced the word of god
[1:07:22] amen no matter what they did where they
[1:07:25] did it how they did it amen they were
[1:07:27] giving the preeminence to god
[1:07:29] amen and god honored that faith
[1:07:32] amen that's the faith god is looking for
[1:07:35] in his sons and daughters praise the
[1:07:38] lord brother hey brother i pray grace
[1:07:40] that we have the faith that he's looking
[1:07:42] for in the bride

[1:24:51] again i said that
[1:24:53] i
[1:24:56] i wasn't really conscious of it as
[1:24:58] others were but they knew it and i i
[1:25:00] didn't i didn't go around
[1:25:02] boasting
[1:25:04] about anything
[1:25:06] you know but when i was even when i was
[1:25:07] young
[1:25:09] just a young young young
[1:25:11] boy or a young teenager
[1:25:14] or even 10 or 12 years old
[1:25:17] i remember now a scene
[1:25:20] and uh
[1:25:21] going we're walking down
[1:25:23] down the road there which is all dirt
[1:25:24] roads no nothing paved then
[1:25:26] and i remember we came by a house there
[1:25:29] there was nobody i don't think there was
[1:25:31] anybody living there that might have
[1:25:32] been at the time
[1:25:34] but right in front of the house was a
[1:25:36] huge rock
[1:25:38] right in front of the house and between
[1:25:39] the house and the road that we were
[1:25:41] walking on there's this huge rock and i
[1:25:43] remember
[1:25:44] walking down that way with a number of
[1:25:46] young people
[1:25:47] friends and so on and there was a
[1:25:49] situation evolved and this was going on
[1:25:52] that was going on
[1:25:53] and
[1:25:54] oh yeah and they were jumping up on the
[1:25:56] rock and jumping down doing this doing
[1:25:57] that and i don't know what happened oh
[1:26:01] they said oh gerald
[1:26:04] you're going to swear
[1:26:07] i said no i'm not going to swear don't
[1:26:08] know they said we know you want but they
[1:26:11] said we we got to swear i said that's up
[1:26:13] to you
[1:26:14] i said it's not me
[1:26:15] amen that's that's your choice oh yeah
[1:26:17] but they knew even then oh yeah they
[1:26:20] said we know that you won't swear we
[1:26:21] know that you won't do this you won't do
[1:26:23] that amen so we respect that we're just
[1:26:25] going on i said okay go on
[1:26:28] yeah
[1:26:29] and
[1:26:30] they they went one way i turned around
[1:26:31] went back the other way
[1:26:33] amen why because of what they planned
[1:26:35] and what
[1:26:36] what they were doing how they were doing
[1:26:38] it and their conversation i said they
[1:26:40] got nothing to do with me so i went on
[1:26:43] back to my my home at the time my
[1:26:45] parents i was amen why because sons and
[1:26:48] daughters of god are led by the spirit
[1:26:50] of god
[1:26:51] i trust that we're getting more and more
[1:26:52] conscious of it
[1:26:53] amen led by the spirit
[1:26:57] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:27:01] for verse 15 for ye have not received
[1:27:03] the spirit of bondage
[1:27:06] again to fear
[1:27:08] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:27:11] adoption
[1:27:12] amen whereby we cry abba father
[1:27:17] amen
[1:27:19] it takes away the spirit of fear
[1:27:22] why our relationship is not based on
[1:27:25] fear
[1:27:26] our relationship with god is based on
[1:27:27] love
[1:27:29] amen amen there are those that have a
[1:27:32] relationship with god and based on fear
[1:27:34] they're those that have relationship
[1:27:35] with other believers and that's based on
[1:27:37] fear
[1:27:38] they're afraid of what the believer
[1:27:39] might say
[1:27:41] and might one might say this might say
[1:27:42] that and so on no
[1:27:44] move on by the grace of god
[1:27:47] it's like i said there were down through
[1:27:49] the years i was told later that there
[1:27:51] was a number of believers that wouldn't
[1:27:53] have nothing to do with me
[1:27:55] because they felt that i knew what they
[1:27:56] were thinking
[1:27:58] amen that i could discern their thoughts
[1:28:00] and so on but again i said well i said
[1:28:02] would you leave that with the lord i
[1:28:04] said amen that's between them and god
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:08] so god help us to have that anointing in
[1:28:11] our hearts they know you're a christian
[1:28:14] amen
[1:28:15] amen because you've got the christian
[1:28:16] attitude you've got the christian spirit

[1:28:27] so again in verse 15 for ye have not
[1:28:29] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:28:31] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[1:28:34] adoption
[1:28:36] praise the lord
[1:28:37] whereby we cry
[1:28:39] abba father
[1:28:42] and he said the spirit
[1:28:44] and it's the spirit of adoption
[1:28:46] and it's the holy ghost

[1:29:39] you down to turn jesus down
[1:29:42] amen as they crucified him they'll
[1:29:44] crucify you
[1:29:46] or that that hour's coming it's getting
[1:29:48] worse

[1:30:22] simplicity

[1:33:53] amen put yourself in the word
[1:33:55] to make your calling and election sure
[1:33:58] put yourself in the word to make your
[1:34:00] adoption sure
[1:34:02] by the grace of god
[1:34:06] and he quoted he said ye haven't
[1:34:08] received
[1:34:09] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[1:34:11] ye have received the spirit of adoption
[1:34:15] amen
[1:34:17] and he said after you're adopted
[1:34:20] amen you're placed
[1:34:22] then you understand
[1:34:25] he said you've been put into the body
[1:34:27] correctly
[1:34:28] adoption
[1:34:29] is placing you in the body
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:33] correctly
[1:34:34] the right position
[1:34:36] by the grace of god
[1:34:38] he said you're a son
[1:34:40] sure a daughter and when you're born
[1:34:43] again he said that's
[1:34:45] that's your birth
[1:34:46] but now he said you're positionally
[1:34:48] placed
[1:34:50] adopted amen amen
[1:34:53] oh glory
[1:34:54] and he said we have not received the
[1:34:56] spirit of fear but we have received the
[1:34:59] spirit of adoption
[1:35:01] whereby we cry abba father
[1:35:04] which means my god
[1:35:07] hallelujah and the spirit itself bears
[1:35:09] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:35:12] children of god
[1:35:15] amen
[1:35:16] and brother brahma highlights it oh
[1:35:19] why why do you have you you when it
[1:35:21] comes to adoption
[1:35:23] he does i like the difference in what
[1:35:25] man thinks adoption is and what the
[1:35:27] bible teaches adoption is
[1:35:29] oh man thinks adoption is oh
[1:35:31] that that's sons children out there boys
[1:35:34] and girls but they don't have no parents
[1:35:36] right now so i'm going we're going to
[1:35:38] adopt this one i'm going to adopt that
[1:35:39] one oh they think oh okay
[1:35:43] but he doesn't look like you he's not
[1:35:45] going to have the nature of you because
[1:35:46] he is
[1:35:47] his parents are is another mother and
[1:35:49] father oh yeah we think oh yeah they're
[1:35:52] adopting
[1:35:53] those those children out there no
[1:35:56] when it comes to god
[1:35:58] he's adopting his own
[1:36:01] he's adopting his own sons and daughters
[1:36:03] amen we were cut off we were cut off by
[1:36:06] sin but now god brings us back to adopt
[1:36:09] us again amen
[1:36:11] so he said again he said we have
[1:36:13] received the spirit of adoption
[1:36:16] and whereby we cry abba father amen the
[1:36:20] spirit itself bears witness with our
[1:36:22] spirit that we are the children of god
[1:36:26] amen
[1:36:31] he said the bible speaks of the
[1:36:32] dispensation
[1:36:34] of the fullness of time
[1:36:36] amen
[1:36:38] he said there's a dispensation of the
[1:36:40] mosaic law there's a dispensation of
[1:36:42] john the baptist there's a dispensation
[1:36:45] of christ
[1:36:46] and there was a dispensation of a church
[1:36:49] organization
[1:36:50] and he said there's a dispensation of
[1:36:53] the outpouring of the holy ghost
[1:36:55] now is the dispensation of adoption
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:01] amen hallelujah god is calling this
[1:37:05] calling this calling that but now he
[1:37:06] wants you to he wants to you to identify
[1:37:09] with who you are

[1:37:12] his son
[1:37:13] amen and that hallelujah that what is
[1:37:16] god what is god doing through our lord
[1:37:17] jesus christ he's bringing us back to
[1:37:20] sonship

[1:37:27] god's bringing us back
[1:37:29] amen sin cut us off but jesus came to
[1:37:32] pay the price to hallelujah to bring us
[1:37:34] back
[1:37:35] amen with the revelation oh yeah oh
[1:37:38] father father father
[1:37:40] amen
[1:37:43] he said it there was the dispensation of
[1:37:45] the outpouring of the holy spirit now
[1:37:48] the dispensation of adoption
[1:37:51] amen
[1:37:52] and he said what the world's waiting for
[1:37:54] groaning amen
[1:37:57] the fullness of the dispensation of time
[1:38:00] is the dispensation of adoption
[1:38:02] god recognizing acknowledging
[1:38:05] our sonship that's right amen
[1:38:08] by the grace of almighty god
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:16] he said we're predestinated according to
[1:38:18] the purpose of him who worketh all
[1:38:20] things
[1:38:21] after the counsel of his own will
[1:38:24] and he said remember again inheritance
[1:38:26] by predestination i inherited something
[1:38:29] right again that that son is trained
[1:38:32] just and and
[1:38:34] the the one that trains him brings him
[1:38:35] into the father so all well well he's
[1:38:38] put back in line now
[1:38:39] because if if he wasn't a trained right
[1:38:42] if he if and if the trainer felt that he
[1:38:44] oh
[1:38:45] he just doesn't have that he don't know
[1:38:47] what to do there he don't know how to do
[1:38:48] this he he don't have the maturity

[1:38:54] him in as a tourist to inherit what he's
[1:38:58] going to leave behind
[1:38:59] oh yeah and on that his father cannot

[1:39:18] to give him authority and and to do this
[1:39:20] to do that to do that oh yeah he would
[1:39:22] have access oh yeah to all that his
[1:39:24] father would have access to

[1:43:49] adopted
[1:43:51] by the power of the holy ghost
[1:43:58] listen
[1:44:01] he said cancer is a toothache to what's
[1:44:03] coming and remember that horrible thing
[1:44:05] that was forbidden in that day to touch
[1:44:07] those who had the seal of god and he
[1:44:09] said that's what we're striving for now
[1:44:12] to get in and be positionally placed
[1:44:14] into the kingdom of god before these
[1:44:17] horrible plagues strike that's right
[1:44:24] just make our adoption sure

[1:44:40] and we said how
[1:44:42] good
[1:44:43] the dispensation of time the fullness of
[1:44:45] time the inheritance but brother we've
[1:44:48] obtained an inheritance being
[1:44:50] predestinated
[1:44:52] through our lord jesus christ
[1:44:56] he said that was our inheritance given
[1:44:57] to us through what predestination
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:02] predestination is for knowledge and how
[1:45:05] did god know he could trust you to be a
[1:45:07] preacher
[1:45:09] it's foreknowledge
[1:45:10] not he that willeth he that runneth it's
[1:45:13] god that shows mercy amen
[1:45:17] brother
[1:45:20] but that's a response to what he's
[1:45:22] seeing in you
[1:45:24] response to your attitude your spirit
[1:45:26] your motives your objectives
[1:45:29] said that's right he's a predestination
[1:45:32] he knew what was in you
[1:45:35] and he knowed what was in you before you
[1:45:38] even came on the earth
[1:45:45] he said when i stood there for those few
[1:45:47] joyful moments and thought there's no
[1:45:49] tomorrow there's no yesterday there's no
[1:45:51] sickness there's no sorrow there's no
[1:45:54] little bit of happiness then a whole lot
[1:45:56] of happiness it's all happiness
[1:46:00] and that voice said that this is perfect
[1:46:03] love
[1:46:04] and everything that you ever loved and
[1:46:06] everything that ever loved you is here
[1:46:09] with you now
[1:46:10] and you'll present us to the lord jesus
[1:46:13] when he comes as the trophies of your
[1:46:16] ministry
[1:46:18] praise the name
[1:46:19] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:46:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:26] just
[1:46:27] bear with me
[1:46:34] praise the lord
[1:46:38] and this is by the way this is a series
[1:46:40] on adoption
[1:46:43] amen
[1:46:44] and he preached four or five messages on
[1:46:46] adoption
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:52] again he reads the scripture
[1:46:57] jesus read speaking of salvation
[1:47:00] and he said what was the salvation he
[1:47:02] was trying to tell them
[1:47:03] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:47:05] the earth that's the salvation he was
[1:47:08] indicating
[1:47:09] to the adoption of sons
[1:47:12] predestinated to eternal life
[1:47:14] now he said as you come into eternal
[1:47:16] life after you have been saved
[1:47:19] sanctified filled with the holy spirit
[1:47:21] you are a son
[1:47:23] now he said god's wanting to place you
[1:47:25] possessionally so that you can work for
[1:47:27] his kingdom and for his glory
[1:47:31] amen
[1:47:32] by the grace of god amen amen
[1:47:38] he said it is the gospel of your
[1:47:40] salvation and he said listen closely
[1:47:44] after that ye believe you were sealed
[1:47:46] with the holy spirit of promise
[1:47:48] and in the last days the bible said in
[1:47:51] the last days there's going to be two
[1:47:53] classes of people
[1:47:54] one of them is going to have the seal of
[1:47:56] god and the other one the mark of the
[1:47:59] beast
[1:48:00] amazing
[1:48:02] and he said if the seal of god is the
[1:48:05] holy ghost
[1:48:06] then without the holy ghost
[1:48:12] is the mark of the beast
[1:48:14] so we either got the holy ghost or the
[1:48:15] mark of the beast
[1:48:19] and your attitude your actions your
[1:48:21] reactions
[1:48:23] bears witness of the spirit that you
[1:48:25] that controls you
[1:48:28] is it the holy ghost
[1:48:29] or is it the mark of the beast
[1:48:32] amazing
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:40] he said the seal of god is the holy
[1:48:42] ghost then without the holy ghost is the
[1:48:45] mark of the beast and he said knowing
[1:48:46] there's ten virgins went out to meet the
[1:48:49] lord all sanctified all holy every one
[1:48:52] of them sanctified and he said five
[1:48:56] were
[1:48:57] dilatory and let their lights go out
[1:49:00] five had oil in their lamps and the
[1:49:03] bright behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:49:05] and the five that had all in their lamps
[1:49:08] went into the wedding supper
[1:49:10] and the others were left outside where
[1:49:12] there was weeping and wailing and
[1:49:14] gnashing of teeth
[1:49:16] amen
[1:49:20] grace
[1:49:23] for full holy ghost
[1:49:25] adoption
[1:49:27] amen praise the lord
[1:49:35] and in the message
[1:49:39] the revelation of jesus christ amen
[1:49:44] chapter 5.
[1:49:53] bear with me again
[1:49:59] praise the lord
[1:50:01] he said how do we get in christ by one
[1:50:03] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:50:07] which is the body of
[1:50:08] christ and he said grace
[1:50:11] unto you and peace from god our father
[1:50:14] and the lord jesus christ amen
[1:50:18] he has sealed us in by his spirit and
[1:50:21] now is revealing to us all the things
[1:50:23] that's in the future for us and we are
[1:50:26] up to the seven seals
[1:50:28] amen
[1:50:29] by the grace of god
[1:50:36] and he said now he said let me just
[1:50:38] quote another scripture all that he
[1:50:39] foreknew he has called and all that he
[1:50:42] called is justified and all that he
[1:50:44] justified he had glorified amen all the
[1:50:48] way from the beginning god in his great
[1:50:50] infinite mind foresaw his church and
[1:50:53] predestinated it unto the adoption of
[1:50:55] children through jesus christ amen
[1:50:59] praise the lord to give eternal life at
[1:51:02] the end of the age
[1:51:05] by the grace of god
[1:51:06] amen
[1:51:08] he said we are predestinated with the
[1:51:10] lamb and the holy spirit is our seal and
[1:51:13] the earnest means more is yet to come
[1:51:16] we only have the earnest of it now the
[1:51:19] earnest is just a down payment
[1:51:21] yeah
[1:51:22] that owes it and secures it and anchors
[1:51:25] it and so no one else can touch it
[1:51:28] it's the earnest of our adoption
[1:51:31] amen
[1:51:33] the power the anointing of the holy
[1:51:34] ghost it is the earnest of our adoption
[1:51:38] praise the lord
[1:51:39] looking for and longing for the complete
[1:51:41] adoption and he said the complete
[1:51:43] adoption
[1:51:45] is in glory
[1:51:47] is getting out of time into eternity and
[1:51:49] is getting into a glorified body amen
[1:51:52] amen
[1:51:54] brother those that are experiencing the
[1:51:56] spirit of adoption they've been
[1:51:57] predestinated onto a glorified body
[1:52:01] amen
[1:52:02] praise the name of the lord
[1:52:04] he said we are waiting
[1:52:07] he said for the fullness of adoption
[1:52:11] and this will take place when he said at
[1:52:14] the first resurrection
[1:52:16] and he said that's when our bodies will
[1:52:17] be changed from these vile creatures
[1:52:20] that
[1:52:21] that we are and we'll have a body like
[1:52:23] his
[1:52:24] glorious body
[1:52:27] amen
[1:52:28] the fullness of adoption is to end the
[1:52:30] resurrection
[1:52:31] amen we've experienced it we've got it
[1:52:34] in a new birth experienced it but it's
[1:52:36] moving us on to the fullness
[1:52:39] amen
[1:52:40] to be borne again
[1:52:41] into a glorified body by the grace of
[1:52:44] god
[1:52:45] amen amen and amen praise the name of
[1:52:48] the lord
[1:52:49] hallelujah
[1:52:53] this is the message on blasphemous names
[1:53:00] let me just give you three or four
[1:53:01] quotes from this message
[1:53:08] oh my
[1:53:10] please
[1:53:12] i tell you this
[1:53:14] adoption is just not a thought an
[1:53:16] experience we had an experience of
[1:53:17] adoption well that's it
[1:53:19] it's more than that it's it's the life
[1:53:22] adoption is the life of god in you
[1:53:26] amen
[1:53:34] and he said now he said get this listen
[1:53:36] here's what's wrong
[1:53:38] he said with the branham tabernacle
[1:53:41] he said there is two different kinds of
[1:53:43] faith
[1:53:44] two different kinds of virtue
[1:53:46] and as i added the other day two
[1:53:48] different kinds of knowledge
[1:53:50] two different kinds of temperance
[1:53:53] he said one thinks
[1:53:55] it's prohibition
[1:53:57] he said they ain't
[1:53:58] that ain't the kind of temperance that
[1:54:00] god's talking about
[1:54:02] he says that ungodly uncontrollable
[1:54:05] temper you got
[1:54:07] and things
[1:54:09] that flash back
[1:54:11] he said listen patience and so forth
[1:54:13] there's a mockery of it pretending to be
[1:54:16] a nature given faith
[1:54:19] yeah
[1:54:20] but he said the biggest part of our
[1:54:22] faith is mental faith
[1:54:27] do you have holy ghost faith or mental
[1:54:29] faith
[1:54:30] for most of them they just got a mental
[1:54:32] faith
[1:54:33] but for the few they have a holy ghost
[1:54:36] faith in the heart
[1:54:37] they're controlled by it out of the
[1:54:39] heart
[1:54:40] amen
[1:54:41] oh yeah
[1:54:43] you can be kind but not loving
[1:54:46] oh yeah that's right sister
[1:54:48] what if you you can go places and people
[1:54:51] think you're you're you're you're nice
[1:54:53] you're kind you're kind you're kind but
[1:54:55] they're not loving
[1:54:57] there's a difference
[1:55:00] oh yeah i've met kind people
[1:55:02] i met nice people but they weren't
[1:55:04] loving
[1:55:06] no no but if you're born again you got
[1:55:08] the love of god
[1:55:11] the love of god amen oh brother that's
[1:55:14] beyond any human love hallelujah amen
[1:55:19] she said though he said the biggest part
[1:55:20] of our faith is mental faith
[1:55:24] and by hearing the word it we bring
[1:55:26] brings us to a mental mental recognition
[1:55:29] of god amen
[1:55:31] but
[1:55:32] he said what about a godly faith
[1:55:35] do you have a mental faith or a godly
[1:55:37] faith a mental faith or a holy ghost
[1:55:40] faith is it all up here or is it down
[1:55:42] here in the heart
[1:55:47] he said when the word itself is poured
[1:55:49] into our faith our mental faith becomes
[1:55:52] a spiritual revelation
[1:55:56] so is the word just knowledge
[1:55:58] or spiritual revelation
[1:56:01] amen you can't get away from it
[1:56:04] no
[1:56:07] you're spiritual
[1:56:09] and you love the lord
[1:56:12] oh yeah you got a holy ghost love
[1:56:16] amen
[1:56:24] he said now he's a coming from the holy
[1:56:26] spirit what is what has come and then he
[1:56:29] he will give to you supernatural faith
[1:56:33] spiritual faith that here at the bottom
[1:56:36] and he said then that spiritual faith
[1:56:38] recognizes only the word
[1:56:41] amen
[1:56:42] so we got to go make sure that we we're
[1:56:45] we're not we're not under the control of
[1:56:47] mental faith
[1:56:49] we're under the control of spiritual
[1:56:50] faith
[1:56:51] holy ghost faith
[1:56:53] by the grace of god
[1:56:58] you can have intellectual faith and you
[1:57:00] just got the letter of the word
[1:57:03] yeah but if you've got the spirit of the
[1:57:04] word
[1:57:05] amen
[1:57:06] it controls your life
[1:57:10] your thoughts your words your deeds your
[1:57:12] attitudes your actions your reactions or
[1:57:14] if you got a holy ghost faith
[1:57:16] i tell you you're governed by divine
[1:57:19] love
[1:57:21] amen
[1:57:28] he said god has predestinated us
[1:57:32] unto
[1:57:33] the adoption
[1:57:35] of sons
[1:57:38] amen
[1:57:40] i trust by grace that we're under the
[1:57:42] predestination of god
[1:57:44] amen
[1:57:46] not just to all believers believe the
[1:57:48] message believe this believe that no
[1:57:50] sons and daughters of god
[1:57:52] by the grace of god
[1:57:54] we've been adopted and brought back
[1:57:57] amen
[1:57:58] and when a son is born into it it's a
[1:58:01] sun
[1:58:02] but that sun at tutors to raise it
[1:58:05] and if that son
[1:58:06] never did come to the right kind of a
[1:58:09] son he never becomes an heir and he said
[1:58:12] but if he was the right son and the son
[1:58:14] that would obey his father then that son
[1:58:17] was adopted
[1:58:19] positionally amen
[1:58:22] he'd become a hair of what the father
[1:58:25] had
[1:58:26] amen
[1:58:28] praise the lord grace to us he said
[1:58:30] there is where our pentecostal people
[1:58:32] have made a mistake being born into the
[1:58:34] family up by the holy ghost that's right
[1:58:36] but then we must be right kind of
[1:58:38] children tutored by the right tutor
[1:58:42] amen
[1:58:44] you have an experience with god that's
[1:58:45] good
[1:58:46] but make sure you're going to be
[1:58:48] taught and trained
[1:58:50] to and tutored as worthless the right
[1:58:52] way by the grace of god oh yeah
[1:58:57] god oh yeah well well that's all it is
[1:58:59] i'm born again so i don't have to worry
[1:59:01] about this do not worry with that as i
[1:59:03] said like that
[1:59:05] believer that
[1:59:06] i heard praying at the altar
[1:59:09] and i
[1:59:10] i was kneeling down and that person was
[1:59:12] kneeling next to me
[1:59:16] and they prayed and said lord thank you
[1:59:20] for your deliverance thank you for
[1:59:22] bringing us out of denomination and now
[1:59:25] we don't have to be under the control of
[1:59:26] any man anymore
[1:59:29] amen well brother they came in under
[1:59:31] control of this
[1:59:32] this prophet that prophet but they came
[1:59:34] under the control of another prophet
[1:59:36] amen by the grace of god
[1:59:39] so brother
[1:59:40] oh yeah
[1:59:42] just think we're not in denomination but
[1:59:44] still we got to come under the control
[1:59:45] of the ministry
[1:59:47] yeah
[1:59:48] by the grace of god that's that's god's
[1:59:50] way
[1:59:51] of doing things
[1:59:53] god help us
[1:59:57] yeah
[1:59:58] as someone
[2:00:02] just recently informed us that
[2:00:05] they wouldn't be
[2:00:07] watching us online anymore
[2:00:10] because of a certain situation which
[2:00:12] they believe that that we sort of
[2:00:15] have
[2:00:16] done in the church here
[2:00:18] a certain thing
[2:00:20] and they said oh they want
[2:00:22] they won't be tuned in anymore
[2:00:26] yeah
[2:00:28] but what is is it are they doing
[2:00:30] something that god doesn't like maybe
[2:00:32] god don't tune into them
[2:00:35] that's right
[2:00:37] you got to be careful
[2:00:40] oh yeah
