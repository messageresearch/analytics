[42:23] for quite a while
[42:24] and but tonight we're going to hear the
[42:26] prophet preach on redemption and it's
[42:28] only i think about maybe an hour or less
[42:30] than an hour
[42:31] and then i will
[42:33] i'll try not to be an hour after
[42:35] or or before amen but we'll get into
[42:38] this series on redemption the problem of
[42:41] god preached on it a number of times
[42:43] including redemption by power and that's
[42:46] the message we'll hear tonight amen and
[42:48] another one in fact this was in the in
[42:51] in the
[42:52] sunday on a sunday evening and just a
[42:54] week later i believe it was he preached
[42:57] again redemption in completeness and in
[43:00] joy amen so i just want to share with
[43:03] you the revelation to get into it in a
[43:05] more personal way concerning redemption
[43:07] what is redemption amen so we pray the
[43:10] grace of god that we know what it is and
[43:13] we got the experience of it by the grace
[43:15] of god in our hearts in our souls amen
[43:18] in our entire beings we've been redeemed
[43:21] we know where we come from we know where
[43:23] we're going amen because why because of

[43:43] amen that we come into this world with a
[43:46] worldly nature worldly worldly attitudes

[43:57] seed oh praise the lord and brother it
[43:59] just fought everything else amen it just
[44:02] keeps it bring it brings us in line with

[44:10] to change
[44:11] brother sister listen the rest of the
[44:13] world they're even religious people
[44:15] they're just living living living in the
[44:16] world living for the world living for

[44:33] god by the holy ghost brings us in
[44:34] contact with heaven amen with the nature
[44:37] of heaven by the grace of almighty god
[44:40] so i pray the grace of god that we truly
[44:42] truly have an experience of redemption
[44:45] and then we'll understand what the
[44:47] prophet is going to minister on in
[44:49] redemption by power amen and again it's

[47:47] only that there were denominational
[47:49] people amen in that town and they would

[52:21] actually drew the same thing of that big
[52:23] circle of eternity eternity we dropped
[52:25] down into into into a body called time
[52:28] but there was a before he did that
[52:30] how he had a plan of redemption
[52:33] oh he did this just to oh just he
[52:35] allowed it he knows i'll tell you
[52:38] his seed is going to do it he's going to
[52:39] believe
[52:40] his seed is going to be faithful
[52:42] amen but understand this the problem of
[52:44] god said he said you're going to be
[52:46] surprised he said who made it
[52:49] what
[52:50] surprised
[52:51] oh yeah who made it i'm surprised you
[52:53] didn't make it well we thought this one
[52:55] was going to make it that one would make
[52:56] it
[52:58] amen sometimes brothers like like the
[53:01] the angel rebuked the prophet of god
[53:03] because he was criticizing that woman
[53:05] walking down the street and so on oh
[53:07] yeah and he says don't do that brother
[53:09] branham some of them are my children
[53:12] amen so brother you're gonna be
[53:14] surprised what surprise
[53:16] i when i get there i thought i would
[53:18] just see all i'm seeing now you're gonna
[53:20] see somebody different
[53:21] amen by the grace of god
[53:23] lord
[53:25] who's that that one made it oh yeah by
[53:28] the grace of god it's like oh brother i
[53:31] pray god give us the revelation
[53:33] amen brother the prophet of god said
[53:36] that time in the resurrection rapture
[53:37] the dead in christ going to appear to
[53:39] the living saints
[53:40] on the earth oh are you going to
[53:42] recognize them
[53:44] are you really going to recognize who
[53:45] they are
[53:46] i pray grace we're going to walk in the
[53:48] spirit
[53:49] and they're going to come forth in the
[53:50] spirit
[53:51] amen and he said then the living saints
[53:54] will move with them into that other
[53:56] dimension and into glorified bodies oh
[53:59] brother god help us
[54:00] god elders to be spiritually minded not
[54:03] religiously minded amen but spiritually
[54:06] and brother it's a spiritual mind that
[54:09] that keeps us separated from the world
[54:11] the things of the world oh it is
[54:13] not religious mind but spiritual amen
[54:16] and my brother it's not in the sometimes
[54:18] because you're spiritual it's not that
[54:20] you're you i'm i'm i'm not going to have
[54:22] nothing to do with there's nothing to do
[54:23] with it no no it's just if you're
[54:24] spiritual they don't want nothing to do
[54:26] with you
[54:28] oh yeah
[54:30] because again the prophet warned us when
[54:32] it comes to being spiritual is you get
[54:33] together with spiritual and he said
[54:36] you avoid religious people he said why
[54:38] he said their spirit can get on you
[54:40] but he said that your spirit won't get

[54:47] power of god the love of god so brother
[54:50] we're not gonna we're not gonna let the
[54:52] devil trick us no not by any means no

[55:04] sons and daughters of god amen
[55:06] amen have that desire as the sons and
[55:09] daughters of god and what what is that
[55:11] desire to go home
[55:13] we want to go home lord amen
[55:15] well there's something wrong if you feel
[55:18] comfortable in this world and you love
[55:20] this you like this you like that you not
[55:22] love it you like it amen god alphys
[55:25] because brother god's going to let it
[55:26] get get get worse and worse and worse
[55:29] and worse amen so that what so that
[55:32] there is seed is going to get more and
[55:34] more separated
[55:36] oh yeah
[55:37] more and more separated by the grace of
[55:40] almighty god amen so the lord help us as
[55:43] we go to the word tonight concerning
[55:45] redemption
[55:47] let's make sure we're redeemed
[55:49] we got the experience of redemption we
[55:51] live the way we live because of
[55:53] redemption amen god did this in
[55:56] redemption amen he turned us around and
[55:59] we're going back in a different
[56:00] direction the door is open
[56:02] it's still open waiting for us to get
[56:04] back
[56:05] praise the name of the lord
[56:07] do god be the glory so the lord bless us
[56:11] we'll read a scripture and then we'll
[56:13] sing only believe to hear the prophet
[56:15] and as i said the message is uh
[56:17] redemption by power and it'll be less
[56:20] than maybe an hour
[56:22] in ephesians chapter 1
[56:26] ephesians chapter 1 and we want to read
[56:28] a few verses there
[56:32] beginning at verse 9
[56:38] and he made known unto us the mystery of
[56:42] his will his will for your life
[56:45] his will for us in this in this hour in
[56:47] this age
[56:49] brother
[56:50] i pray grace that we'll get less and
[56:52] less and less caught up with the world
[56:55] the things of the world amen and brother
[56:58] that were being challenged more and more
[57:00] in this hour in this age than they were
[57:02] in previous ages
[57:04] oh yeah
[57:06] that's that's why that's why this
[57:07] previous age goes into a total darkness
[57:10] amen
[57:11] and the prophet said he put that there
[57:13] but brother when the angel drew it on
[57:15] the wall in brown tabernacle it was all
[57:17] black
[57:18] man and he said just put that there i
[57:20] think brother john might have referenced
[57:21] it to the jonathan and what reference
[57:24] said what fourth to represent the bride
[57:27] just that little bit of light i'll tell
[57:29] you
[57:30] he put this much there but
[57:32] you know if we if we had to really do it
[57:34] spiritually it would be very just like a
[57:36] dot
[57:38] just like maybe just a little white dot
[57:40] to represent the bride of christ
[57:42] god help us to be the bride god elvis
[57:46] hallelujah to have that bright nature
[57:48] and that bright character amen
[57:51] ephesians chapter 1 and beginning to
[57:53] read at verse 9
[57:55] and he made known unto us the mystery of
[57:58] his will
[57:59] amen
[58:01] according to his good pleasure
[58:04] which he hath purposed in himself amen
[58:10] and it says in whom also we have
[58:13] obtained an inheritance
[58:15] hallelujah praise the lord
[58:19] in christ
[58:20] and it says being predestinated
[58:23] according to the purpose of him who work
[58:26] of all things
[58:29] after the council of his own will
[58:32] and again i was challenged by a
[58:35] pentecostal pastor
[58:36] he's a different church now a different
[58:38] denomination but back then he came and
[58:41] pastor
[58:42] he said
[58:44] i i can't see nor understand what some
[58:47] pete preached regarding predestination
[58:50] they leave the impression he said that
[58:52] god predestinates this one to go to
[58:54] heaven that want to go to hell he said
[58:56] surely he said god's not going to do
[58:57] that that's not his will for this not
[58:59] nobody said brother us you've got to
[59:01] understand predestination is based on
[59:03] foreknowledge
[59:05] what
[59:06] for knowledge i said god foreknew that
[59:08] person
[59:10] god knew what they would do god knew the
[59:12] attitude they would have god knew
[59:14] whether they would accept or reject
[59:16] jesus oh he said oh that explains it
[59:19] thank you oh my praise the lord he says
[59:21] wonderful now i believe amen sir brother
[59:25] let's be spiritual
[59:26] praise the lord according to the will of
[59:29] god amen amen again verse 11 in whom
[59:33] also we have obtained an inheritance
[59:36] in christ
[59:38] praise the lord being predestinated
[59:41] according to the purpose
[59:44] of him who work of all things after the
[59:46] counsel of his own will amen grace that
[59:50] we're in and under and controlled by the
[59:52] predestinated will of god
[59:54] not my will thine be done
[59:57] and it says that ye that we should be to
[59:59] the praise of his glory who first
[1:00:02] trusted in christ
[1:00:04] praise the lord
[1:00:06] and it's all
[1:00:08] to the praise of his glory amen
[1:00:11] love him with all your heart hallelujah
[1:00:15] hallelujah in whom also ye also trusted
[1:00:19] after that ye heard the word of truth
[1:00:23] the gospel of your
[1:00:26] salvation in whom also after that ye
[1:00:30] believed ye were sealed with that holy
[1:00:33] spirit of promise i trust you're sealed
[1:00:37] amen amen you're sealed in
[1:00:41] not sealed out
[1:00:43] grace
[1:00:45] and he said which is the earnest of our
[1:00:47] inheritance
[1:00:48] until the redemption
[1:00:50] of the purchased possession
[1:00:53] unto the praise of his glory
[1:00:56] and brother it is the earnest or the
[1:00:58] down payment
[1:00:59] of our inheritance
[1:01:01] oh yeah that's what it's referring to
[1:01:02] the down payment
[1:01:04] what for the promise of more to come
[1:01:06] hallelujah
[1:01:08] the earnest of our inheritance until
[1:01:12] the full redemption
[1:01:14] praise the lord
[1:01:16] of the purchased possession
[1:01:18] unto
[1:01:19] the praise of his glory
[1:01:22] oh brother give god the glory
[1:01:24] hallelujah that we're still pressing on
[1:01:27] thank you jesus we'll give the glory to
[1:01:29] god if not we'd be out there in the
[1:01:30] world
[1:01:31] oh yeah oh they're in a dead
[1:01:33] denominational church god help us
[1:01:36] walk in the lightest as he is in the
[1:01:38] light
[1:01:39] amen he is the light amen then he makes
[1:01:42] us the light
[1:01:43] we become the light by the grace of god
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:48] he said again verse 15 wherefore i also
[1:01:51] after i heard of your faith in the lord
[1:01:53] jesus and love
[1:01:55] oh
[1:01:56] love unto all the saints
[1:02:00] it's like that
[1:02:01] roman catholic
[1:02:02] bishop one time
[1:02:04] after the prophet's going and they
[1:02:06] interviewed him about william branham
[1:02:08] what he felt about william branham he
[1:02:09] said listen he said if there's anyone
[1:02:11] that had divine love it was william
[1:02:13] brown
[1:02:14] and he said if you anyone if there was
[1:02:16] anyone that you knew that loved you he
[1:02:18] said william brown he said just talk
[1:02:21] with him and you knew he loved you
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:24] he didn't look down his nose at you
[1:02:26] he looked at his nose at them or then i
[1:02:29] know there's a lot of believers as i've
[1:02:30] said i preached against it when i first
[1:02:32] come to this message why because they of
[1:02:34] the attitude and the spirit i was seen
[1:02:36] among believers they're looking down
[1:02:37] their noses and everybody else
[1:02:40] except those in the message
[1:02:41] and they looked on their nose there's
[1:02:42] some of them
[1:02:44] amen but don't do that that's the grace
[1:02:47] of god to you grace of god to them
[1:02:49] amen so brother keep your attitude right

[1:03:04] and again in verse 15 wherefore i also
[1:03:07] after i heard of your faith in the lord
[1:03:09] jesus and love unto all the saints

[1:11:08] and he wept because there was no man in
[1:11:10] heaven could open it no man on earth no
[1:11:12] man beneath the earth
[1:11:14] but there was a lamb that had been slain
[1:11:16] from the foundation of the world come

[1:11:19] him and set up on the throne and open

[1:11:46] tonight for that storm is raging outside
[1:11:50] rains are twisting and blowing we're so
[1:11:53] thankful to have the house of god to
[1:11:55] come in
[1:11:58] and we're thankful that there is
[1:12:01] a tower a refuge

[1:12:05] mighty tower the righteous run into it
[1:12:07] in her face

[1:12:54] and we'll give you the praise for we
[1:12:55] asked it in
[1:12:57] the
[1:12:58] name of thy beloved son
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:02] jesus now turn to the 10th verse of the
[1:13:06] 12th chapter of exodus we were reading
[1:13:10] the redemption by blood how that god had
[1:13:14] ordained the lamb to be slain in each
[1:13:17] house
[1:13:18] how there would be nothing left over
[1:13:20] the judgment has
[1:13:22] been fallen and the last judgment now
[1:13:25] was ready to fall god was going to
[1:13:27] fulfill his word to the letter
[1:13:30] and all those judgments back there
[1:13:33] was a perfect sign or a perfect
[1:13:36] uh type
[1:13:38] of the judgments which are ready to fall
[1:13:41] down
[1:13:42] and if you'll notice
[1:13:44] before the judgments fell now ministers
[1:13:47] may disagree with me on this which is
[1:13:49] all right but before the judgment
[1:13:52] started hitting egypt
[1:13:54] god
[1:13:55] sent israel to goshen
[1:13:58] they were in goshen and no flag
[1:14:01] fellow man
[1:14:03] a perfect type of the church carried
[1:14:05] over through the tribulation seat
[1:14:07] all right
[1:14:08] then at the last flag that struck the
[1:14:11] earth there struck egypt was death
[1:14:15] all you bible readers shared know your
[1:14:17] sunday school lessons and so forth has
[1:14:19] taken his perhaps many times
[1:14:21] but death was the last enemy that struck
[1:14:26] egypt
[1:14:27] and the last enemy that's going to
[1:14:29] strike the church now is death
[1:14:32] spiritually speaking
[1:14:34] those who will not follow christ and
[1:14:37] and baptism of the holy spirit will
[1:14:40] spiritually dry up and die
[1:14:44] the church as you see it now after
[1:14:47] many many great revivals and evangelists
[1:14:51] has passed through the land and yet the
[1:14:53] church
[1:14:54] is that is politically church speaking
[1:14:58] is getting worse all the time its
[1:15:00] members are just living any way they
[1:15:03] want to
[1:15:05] doing anything they want to yet calling
[1:15:07] themselves christians they say they're
[1:15:09] all right
[1:15:11] to be a christian means to be
[1:15:13] christ-like
[1:15:15] go to a place you wouldn't want to be if
[1:15:18] christ
[1:15:20] would come
[1:15:21] say nothing you would more be saying
[1:15:23] when christ comes
[1:15:25] doing nothing that you won't be doing
[1:15:27] when christ comes
[1:15:29] think nothing you won't be thinking when
[1:15:31] christ comes
[1:15:32] keep your
[1:15:33] one motive your heart centered on
[1:15:37] calvary
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:40] walk in the light
[1:15:42] as he is in the light and we have
[1:15:45] fellowship one with another the blood of
[1:15:47] jesus christ god's son cleanses us from
[1:15:49] all unrighteousness
[1:15:51] that's methodist baptist and all of us
[1:15:53] together makes us all one in him
[1:15:56] now
[1:15:57] the last
[1:15:59] the last thing was death and before that
[1:16:02] death comes there was an atonement made
[1:16:06] for that death
[1:16:07] or all who desire to escape it
[1:16:11] and there was an atonement made before
[1:16:14] the first
[1:16:15] destruction of the andalusian world god
[1:16:18] had a creature of righteousness noah and
[1:16:20] he preached 120 years for people to come
[1:16:24] into the ark and those who willfully
[1:16:27] refused to go there was nothing left for
[1:16:30] judgment
[1:16:31] and today
[1:16:32] man who refused to walk in the light of
[1:16:35] christ
[1:16:37] you have spurned mercy so there's
[1:16:39] nothing left but judgment that's all
[1:16:42] there's a right left side the only one
[1:16:44] you can go to and you make your choice
[1:16:47] now
[1:16:48] we see before the
[1:16:50] the great awful night come that israel
[1:16:53] was commanded we already taken that of
[1:16:56] killing the lamb
[1:16:57] god would bring his church into the
[1:17:00] exodus to bring it out of egypt into the
[1:17:04] promised land
[1:17:05] i like that they were going over to
[1:17:07] possess the land
[1:17:10] god gave them the land and yet it was
[1:17:12] all fenced in with big
[1:17:14] great buildings and fences and
[1:17:16] walls around jericho the church could
[1:17:19] run races around it and just think of
[1:17:21] that yet god said i'll give it to you
[1:17:24] it's yours
[1:17:26] but they had to clean up
[1:17:28] clean it up and that's what god has did
[1:17:31] today he's give every one of you it
[1:17:34] wants it the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:37] but you got to go and possess it that's
[1:17:38] all find out the differences and tear
[1:17:41] down the walls and get started in there
[1:17:43] and get it
[1:17:44] you see the pastor said it's not for us
[1:17:46] today just walk i don't pass it mother
[1:17:48] said i'll run you away from home go
[1:17:50] right on the passage husband said i'll
[1:17:52] leave you go out on a passage that's all
[1:17:55] got to go and possess it that's all
[1:17:57] divine meaning for every one of you
[1:18:00] every one of you sitting here tonight
[1:18:01] with cancer heart trouble whatever it is
[1:18:03] god has give the promise
[1:18:05] and it's yours but you have to go and
[1:18:07] possess it
[1:18:09] now you say well i just don't feel it's
[1:18:11] very good that has nothing to do with it
[1:18:13] the promise is yours
[1:18:15] god give it to you just go out and play
[1:18:17] bliss scenes from one side of the other
[1:18:19] and take out all that have i
[1:18:22] an amber light just kill them out
[1:18:24] go on and take it god said it's yours go
[1:18:27] get it
[1:18:28] but he didn't say now i'll go and sweep
[1:18:30] it all out build you up tonight cities
[1:18:32] and set you down on easy street he
[1:18:34] doesn't do that way he gives it to you
[1:18:36] and you got something to do
[1:18:38] he's good enough to give you the land
[1:18:39] said he'll help you and be with you go
[1:18:41] take it
[1:18:42] and if you're sick tonight crippled
[1:18:43] blind death dumb whatever you are go
[1:18:45] take it god said it was yours
[1:18:47] it's your succession god gave it to you
[1:18:50] he told him that he was given that land
[1:18:52] sent an angel before him to take care of
[1:18:54] the way bring him into the place where
[1:18:56] it was look at them spies when they went
[1:18:58] over here comes
[1:19:00] ten of them back to oh we can't do it
[1:19:03] it's impossible while we're scientists
[1:19:05] and we've looked the thing over it's
[1:19:07] scientifically impossible we can't do it
[1:19:09] but there was two fellows one named
[1:19:11] joshua and one named caleb they were
[1:19:13] looking at what the scientific side was
[1:19:15] they were looking to what god said that
[1:19:17] we can do it that's right
[1:19:20] and they brought back some evidence that
[1:19:21] it was a good land
[1:19:23] i'm so glad of that evidence aren't you
[1:19:26] that is a good land mr brothers and
[1:19:28] we're on the road tonight
[1:19:31] hallelujah
[1:19:32] all right
[1:19:33] here it was now just before redemption
[1:19:36] god required the children of israel that
[1:19:38] they'd be sure to be protected
[1:19:40] to kill this lamb and to put the blood
[1:19:43] on the little the top of the door like
[1:19:45] this and each post
[1:19:47] and they were to go in and eat this lamb
[1:19:50] every bit of it
[1:19:53] notice
[1:19:54] all the lamb
[1:19:56] not just part of it every bit of it to
[1:19:59] be eaten
[1:20:01] some people say i'll just take this part
[1:20:02] now i believe this part but you've got
[1:20:04] to take it all
[1:20:06] every bit of so i believe he was wounded
[1:20:08] for our transgressions but by stripes i
[1:20:10] don't know about it we want it all
[1:20:13] every bit of it is to be all of us
[1:20:17] of it gets tough but we have to eat it
[1:20:18] anyhow god said so notice the 10th verse
[1:20:23] now and ye shall
[1:20:24] uh ye shall let nothing of it remain
[1:20:27] until morning
[1:20:28] and that which remains
[1:20:30] until
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:34] and now
[1:20:35] none of it is to remain everything now
[1:20:37] he said when you eat it
[1:20:39] don't eat it raw
[1:20:40] or sodden
[1:20:42] but you must eat it uh well cooked
[1:20:46] now i like that
[1:20:48] people trying to eat the word of god and
[1:20:51] they take it like it was raw chew on it
[1:20:53] and spit on it and everything i thought
[1:20:55] i just can't take it i can't stand it it
[1:20:57] isn't cooked done enough that's all
[1:21:00] he said cook it with fire fire
[1:21:02] represents the holy ghost you get god in
[1:21:04] your heart first he'll cook it for you
[1:21:06] cook it out done season then it tastes
[1:21:09] good
[1:21:10] now you can't stand oats like this
[1:21:12] outside say oh
[1:21:17] just get the holy ghost first and watch
[1:21:19] what divine healing means to you then
[1:21:21] look what heartfelt religion means to
[1:21:23] you then when you've got the holy spirit
[1:21:25] to cook the lamb as it comes
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:30] that's right
[1:21:33] cook the land first
[1:21:35] and you have to have power to cook it
[1:21:37] with it should be roasted
[1:21:39] oh my that's when it's good roasted it
[1:21:43] just
[1:21:43] burns out all the ascending here not
[1:21:45] long ago by a big smelter and i noticed
[1:21:48] how hot that fire was and it just cooked
[1:21:51] and cooked and cooked and as hotter it
[1:21:54] got the the drops in the metals in the
[1:21:58] gold all come to the top and it skimmed
[1:22:00] it off
[1:22:01] and it heats the fall a little harder
[1:22:03] and just smelled it and then when it's a
[1:22:05] ball more it gets some more different
[1:22:07] stuff
[1:22:08] and stuff out of it the first come up
[1:22:09] was the dirt like
[1:22:11] dirt mug the next come up with oars like
[1:22:14] oh something no good some quick silvers
[1:22:17] and all these things they come up to
[1:22:18] skim at all went on down right down in
[1:22:21] the last thing they took out of it was
[1:22:22] pyrite
[1:22:25] you know there's a lot of things in
[1:22:27] people that try to fool one another when
[1:22:28] you're a christian or acting like it
[1:22:30] anyhow
[1:22:31] but you just let the holy ghost sort of
[1:22:33] fall and earn i think takes all the food
[1:22:36] out of you
[1:22:38] fools gold
[1:22:39] many people go out west and they find
[1:22:41] some of it and they think oh they struck
[1:22:43] a gold mine it shines better than gold
[1:22:45] up but it's full of gold has got no
[1:22:48] value to it
[1:22:50] and now
[1:22:51] they cook that and just skim it all off
[1:22:53] and just keep cooking it and cooking it
[1:22:55] until it's pure gold balls down to
[1:22:58] nothing but 100 percent gold that's the
[1:23:01] way god does in his church holds the
[1:23:03] holy spirit on him crooks
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:15] amen now
[1:23:18] then you can eat it here's another
[1:23:20] beautiful thought here on this on the
[1:23:22] 11th verse
[1:23:24] and thus shall you eat it with
[1:23:28] your
[1:23:28] listen to this line
[1:23:32] i like that shoes on your feet staff in

[1:25:06] the gospel
[1:25:08] the helmet of salvation on the
[1:25:10] breastplate of righteousness girthed up
[1:25:12] his lawn
[1:25:13] they just usually in the old soldiers
[1:25:16] when they put on those ornaments of war
[1:25:19] they had a big belt that buckled it
[1:25:22] together
[1:25:23] holding over their lawns these shields
[1:25:25] to keep the enemy spears off
[1:25:28] what a real blessing that is to us and
[1:25:32] when the the lawrence began to get weak
[1:25:35] hang down the shield that tighten up on
[1:25:38] the belt
[1:25:39] bring him up tight again what a perfect
[1:25:42] picture today when you begin to feel
[1:25:43] like you're slacking or the devil says
[1:25:46] there's no use reach down and tighten up
[1:25:49] the belly a little bit pull up the
[1:25:51] shoulders a little tight in the hand and
[1:25:52] go forward i like that be ready for the
[1:25:55] march
[1:25:58] every man walking under that blood that
[1:26:01] night was commanded to stay there not go
[1:26:04] out until the orders come to march
[1:26:08] and every man that's born of the spirit
[1:26:11] of god comes into christ
[1:26:14] has everlasting eyes puts on his shield
[1:26:18] his breastplate standing ready and
[1:26:21] forbidden to leave until orders to march
[1:26:25] oh isn't it marvelous aren't you glad
[1:26:27] you got it all harnessed up tonight you
[1:26:29] soldiers
[1:26:31] used to have a strong leader at the
[1:26:32] tabernacle our theme song was the fight
[1:26:35] his own old christian soldiers face to
[1:26:38] face and sternery with ours dreaming
[1:26:40] color streaming the right wrongs engaged
[1:26:43] today
[1:26:44] the fight is all but be not weary be
[1:26:47] strong enemies
[1:26:49] if god be for us his barriers will sing
[1:26:51] the victory song at last
[1:26:54] manimal's tanks has gone to the grave
[1:26:56] but one of these days younger in a new
[1:26:58] world when they come forth into the
[1:27:00] promised land
[1:27:02] the banner of the cross will be over us
[1:27:04] and we'll sing the victor song when we
[1:27:06] said it's a wedding supper that night
[1:27:08] around the table that great table maybe
[1:27:10] a hundred thousand miles long with the
[1:27:12] blood more spanx
[1:27:14] sitting around i want to go down along
[1:27:16] the table and shake hands with every one
[1:27:17] of them amen just shouting you want to
[1:27:20] hear me shout wait still get over there
[1:27:23] watch me i ain't big enough yet for this
[1:27:26] but notice
[1:27:28] on the march now get ready we're going
[1:27:32] here's a sad picture before we get over
[1:27:33] to a regular lesson
[1:27:35] it's found in the 38th verse
[1:27:38] there listen
[1:27:40] and a mixed multitude went up with their
[1:27:43] flop
[1:27:44] that's where israel made a mistake
[1:27:46] the supernatural had been done
[1:27:49] and unconverted people
[1:27:51] followed because of the supernatural
[1:27:54] finally got him into trouble
[1:27:57] and on down when lord shared about the
[1:27:59] 42nd verse
[1:28:01] and the 43rd verse
[1:28:03] the lord speaking to moses
[1:28:05] said that no one but those who were
[1:28:09] sacrificed
[1:28:11] could eat the sacrifice brother but
[1:28:13] those who were circumcised
[1:28:15] no strangers no outsiders
[1:28:18] no one should take it but those who are
[1:28:21] circumcised
[1:28:23] and what is this grace that we have
[1:28:26] today
[1:28:27] this day beloved friends
[1:28:30] that when in the church
[1:28:32] everybody that belongs to the church
[1:28:34] takes communion
[1:28:36] and that's wrong
[1:28:38] only those who are
[1:28:40] redeemed that's all who are worthy
[1:28:45] isaiah's spoken said the tables of the
[1:28:47] lord will be full of vomit
[1:28:50] says who shall teach doctrine that will
[1:28:53] wean from the breath
[1:28:55] said free must be up on precip line
[1:28:57] up online here and everyone hold fast to
[1:29:00] that what's good
[1:29:03] god speaking knowing that the days
[1:29:06] that we're living in that the church
[1:29:09] would be so politically until they let
[1:29:11] everything people come in long as they
[1:29:14] had their name on the church book they
[1:29:16] were memorably taken communion and the
[1:29:18] bible said he that eats and drinks that
[1:29:20] unworthy is guilty of the body and the
[1:29:22] blood of the lord
[1:29:26] saint john 13th chapter
[1:29:29] jesus speaking
[1:29:30] second corinthians 11 chapter paul said
[1:29:34] years later that he that eats and drinks
[1:29:36] this unworthily
[1:29:38] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:29:41] blood of the lord
[1:29:43] let a man examine himself he says before
[1:29:45] take i'm quoting scripture
[1:29:47] that's right
[1:29:48] he that eats and drinks unworthy and
[1:29:50] drinks damnation to himself not
[1:29:52] discerning the lord's body and for this
[1:29:54] cause many are sick and weakly among you
[1:29:57] and many sleep
[1:29:59] be sure that you're standing right with
[1:30:01] god here it is in the shadow that no one
[1:30:05] but the circumcised no matter how long
[1:30:08] he was how much he helped the jewish
[1:30:10] church he had to be a
[1:30:12] proselyte
[1:30:15] had to be a real circumcised believer
[1:30:19] before he could take the communion or
[1:30:22] eat the passover
[1:30:24] oh how far we got off the line today
[1:30:28] now let's go quickly then and god
[1:30:31] brought them out
[1:30:33] turning now to the 13th of the 14th
[1:30:36] chapter
[1:30:37] god gave them the pillar of fire to go
[1:30:38] before them i think they had a picture
[1:30:41] here tonight and i say it was reverend
[1:30:43] to my honest opinion while we're here in
[1:30:46] this group tonight i believe that is
[1:30:49] with us tonight this same pillar of
[1:30:52] power the other children of israel is
[1:30:53] going to force performing the same times
[1:30:56] and wonders
[1:30:57] and any teacher here a scholar of the
[1:30:59] bible knows that the angel that followed
[1:31:02] israel and guided them to the promised
[1:31:04] land was the angel of the covenant which
[1:31:07] was jesus christ
[1:31:09] and today jesus christ the same
[1:31:11] yesterday and forever is falling before
[1:31:14] this group that you won't call us holy
[1:31:16] rulers if you want to all right going on
[1:31:20] leading from victory unto victory
[1:31:24] praise god in their nations in their
[1:31:27] days they were despised and hated and
[1:31:29] rejected
[1:31:30] and turned down by the nations and call
[1:31:32] everything
[1:31:34] so is this a day with a true believer
[1:31:38] you and your churches you know when you
[1:31:40] take a stand for christ and speak for
[1:31:43] truth the whole church says look at him
[1:31:46] he's lost his mind he's gone crazy

[1:39:00] i always be abraham i told the christian
[1:39:03] in jesus christ i'll be a christian
[1:39:07] because god has ordained it so far
[1:39:10] elections he called us to the grace of
[1:39:13] his own beloved son we accepted him and
[1:39:16] got eternal life
[1:39:18] by one
[1:39:20] handshake
[1:39:22] by
[1:39:23] one membership
[1:39:24] by one letter
[1:39:26] by
[1:39:27] one spirit
[1:39:29] we're all baptized into one body jesus
[1:39:33] christ
[1:39:34] there become fellow citizens
[1:39:37] of the kingdom
[1:39:38] i was thinking today
[1:39:40] as i was always praying
[1:39:43] at how
[1:39:44] that this is the day that we're going to
[1:39:47] have to answer for
[1:39:49] i'm not going to have to answer for the
[1:39:51] generation that was before me
[1:39:53] or the generation that will be after me
[1:39:55] but in the judgment i understand with
[1:39:57] this generation
[1:40:00] now i said look at a woman's picture on
[1:40:02] the sign
[1:40:03] deer drinking
[1:40:04] something other said she was breathless
[1:40:06] or something i said yes in life let's do
[1:40:09] all right
[1:40:10] there you are i said what a disgrace of
[1:40:13] all the preaching
[1:40:14] i said sometimes it seems it told my
[1:40:16] wife i said sometimes it seems it
[1:40:18] doesn't do any good
[1:40:20] but i've got to be the voice of warning
[1:40:23] anyhow regardless of what people does
[1:40:25] about it i've got to preach the gospel
[1:40:28] anyhow and give a witness unto the
[1:40:31] resurrection and the power of jesus
[1:40:34] let them christ it and turn their back
[1:40:37] god will judge them at the judgment part
[1:40:40] i'm only responsible for preaching and
[1:40:42] other minister students preaching the
[1:40:44] gospel now
[1:40:46] i just love it
[1:40:48] notice go forever now and you will see
[1:40:51] the glory of god
[1:40:53] listen the 16th verse now
[1:40:56] we read this
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:58] but lift up the rod
[1:41:00] the rod that was the judgment rod
[1:41:03] now it wasn't moses rod that was god's
[1:41:06] wrong
[1:41:07] if you'll notice moses he took that rod
[1:41:10] he held it up like this please come here
[1:41:12] all the water to turn the blood it was
[1:41:15] god's judgment line
[1:41:17] and that same rock
[1:41:20] get
[1:41:21] that same rod as what he smoked the rock
[1:41:23] with
[1:41:24] and a twist come in the side of the rock
[1:41:26] and waters came out of the rock
[1:41:28] now that rock was christ
[1:41:32] and it was god's
[1:41:34] judgment the daily the day you got
[1:41:37] smoked christ the cowardice ate that
[1:41:41] bitter agonizing death
[1:41:44] no man never could describe what it was
[1:41:47] or never will
[1:41:48] there
[1:41:50] god placed all the divine judgments up
[1:41:54] on him and shmori to the side and out of
[1:41:56] his heart from water
[1:41:59] and blood
[1:42:01] and spirit
[1:42:03] for our redemption
[1:42:06] how people paint his picture sometimes
[1:42:09] with a robe around him or something
[1:42:10] other on the cross
[1:42:12] that is my soul they disposed that man
[1:42:15] of every
[1:42:17] vowel vulgar thing that they could
[1:42:20] but he had to be
[1:42:22] that he was the highest of all the world
[1:42:26] that ever was or will be and then
[1:42:28] exposed naked on the cross wounded
[1:42:32] smitten bleeding scottish monstery spits
[1:42:35] hanging from his face and mocking crap
[1:42:37] thorns on his head
[1:42:40] but there is once he conquered death
[1:42:43] held in sickness and the grave and paid
[1:42:46] the price for all
[1:42:48] it's often said sometimes therefore he
[1:42:51] took the sting out of death
[1:42:54] that's what paul said oh
[1:42:56] death where is your sting
[1:42:59] i've been told that many insects bees
[1:43:01] and things they got a stinger
[1:43:04] and they're poisoned with it but one
[1:43:06] time they sing they
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:23] speak of it
[1:43:24] there he pulled a singer out of death
[1:43:28] for
[1:43:29] you
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:31] all this thing of death paul said when
[1:43:33] he's going to cut his head off
[1:43:35] in the roman prison he said death what
[1:43:37] is your sin
[1:43:39] pointed back to calvary there's where
[1:43:41] singer was taken out of death
[1:43:43] grave was your victory he said but
[1:43:45] thanks be to god it gives us the victory
[1:43:48] to our lord jesus christ
[1:43:50] amen all right
[1:43:53] the rod the judgment
[1:43:55] and stretch it out
[1:43:57] cover this the sea and divide it and the
[1:44:01] children of israel shall go over on

[1:44:09] the egyptians
[1:44:11] and they shall follow thee
[1:44:13] and i will get me
[1:44:15] honor upon pharaoh and upon all his

[1:46:29] them out tonight that same angel of god
[1:46:32] is in this building right now
[1:46:35] to do just exactly what jesus did in
[1:46:37] that day he's sure to confirm just what
[1:46:40] he did than he is now and will always be

[1:47:10] them and the enemy
[1:47:12] and the angel of god is standing tonight
[1:47:15] between every individual here and the
[1:47:17] enemy
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:21] i know i'm speaking out
[1:47:24] i know i'm standing here now on the
[1:47:26] platform before this little group of
[1:47:28] people tonight i know that god has
[1:47:31] constantly coming down from glory and
[1:47:33] standing in this building now
[1:47:40] if you only dare
[1:47:42] to move out on god's word see if he
[1:47:45] don't move before you
[1:47:47] watch
[1:47:49] and it
[1:47:50] came between the camp and the egyptians
[1:47:54] he's coming between you and your
[1:47:55] sickness he's standing between you and
[1:47:58] your sins right now
[1:48:00] why we are in the exodus of the church
[1:48:04] egypt was always called the world
[1:48:07] and when israel come out remember they
[1:48:10] were church members down there
[1:48:12] but after the blood and the atonement
[1:48:14] was made they become the circumcised of
[1:48:16] god and the circumcision today is the
[1:48:20] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:48:22] all said stephen all you
[1:48:26] uncircumcised in the heart near
[1:48:29] why do you always resist the holy ghost
[1:48:31] as your father said so to you
[1:48:34] the holy spirit circumcised in the heart
[1:48:37] cutting away the things of the world
[1:48:40] it used to be the old-fashioned whole in
[1:48:42] his church living i should like it live
[1:48:45] like it
[1:48:46] but today is just like the rest of the
[1:48:48] world
[1:48:49] it's a disgrace we let on the bar
[1:48:52] old brother spurgeon used to say an old
[1:48:54] methodist preacher friend of mine he
[1:48:56] used to sing a song we let down the bar
[1:48:58] we let out of ours we compromised with
[1:49:01] sin we let out of ours the sheep got out
[1:49:04] how did the ghosts get in
[1:49:06] because you lit on the bar
[1:49:09] that situated on the standard of
[1:49:11] christian living
[1:49:13] because the seminary passed out a few
[1:49:15] preachers and stand out compromised with
[1:49:17] the truth but the holy ghost has always
[1:49:20] been there to condemn sin it is tonight
[1:49:22] and he between the believer and the
[1:49:24] things of the world
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:33] and it came between the camp
[1:49:36] and the egyptians
[1:49:38] and the camp of israel
[1:49:41] and it was a cloud
[1:49:43] of darkness to them
[1:49:45] but it gave life
[1:49:46] by night to thee
[1:49:48] so that the one came not near the other
[1:49:52] all night
[1:49:55] look
[1:49:56] the same thing that was given this group
[1:49:59] of believers life
[1:50:01] was blind and now
[1:50:04] all right
[1:50:05] put on your shockproof jacket should it
[1:50:07] come
[1:50:10] man that rejects life
[1:50:14] goes blind
[1:50:16] and walks in darkness because you don't
[1:50:19] accept life
[1:50:21] amen
[1:50:23] god's tense ministers have preached the
[1:50:25] gospel he sends times and wonders among
[1:50:27] men to have vindicated to be the truth
[1:50:30] and man reject it there's nothing left
[1:50:33] but darkness for you
[1:50:35] walk in the light while the light is
[1:50:37] shining my brother
[1:50:39] receive the light christ
[1:50:42] here's the light he's come to bring life
[1:50:45] to you but those who rejected light
[1:50:48] receive darkness and every man and woman
[1:50:51] tonight who rejects light
[1:50:54] walks in darkness not knowing where he's
[1:50:56] going
[1:50:58] he's staggering all pretty good popular
[1:51:01] with the people but wondering how he
[1:51:03] stands in the presence of god
[1:51:05] notice it
[1:51:06] brought a marvelous finger
[1:51:09] he was light to one
[1:51:11] and darkness to the other
[1:51:13] the israelites then after moses prayed
[1:51:16] they could lay down in peace
[1:51:18] now watch
[1:51:20] and moses stretched out his hand over
[1:51:22] the sea
[1:51:23] and the lord caused the sea to go back
[1:51:27] by a strong east wind
[1:51:29] all that night
[1:51:31] and made to see
[1:51:33] a dry island
[1:51:34] and the waters were divided and the
[1:51:37] children of israel went unto the midst
[1:51:39] of the sea
[1:51:40] upon the dry ground
[1:51:42] if you notice
[1:51:44] wow
[1:51:45] the children of israel who had come out
[1:51:48] of darkness and accepted the light when
[1:51:51] they got in trouble
[1:51:53] the light turned back around and they
[1:51:55] slept all night and while they were
[1:51:57] sleeping god was sending a wind going
[1:52:00] down across the sea opening up a way of
[1:52:02] escape hallelujah to the lamb i'm so

[1:59:02] when he got up his time to speak
[1:59:04] all the religions represented in this
[1:59:06] great gathering

[1:59:54] only clean her hand but it will clean
[1:59:56] her heart amen that's right the blood of
[1:59:59] jesus christ will take the lord

[2:00:56] taste and see the lord is good it tastes
[2:00:59] like honey in the rod
[2:01:01] our lord jesus christ and his love and
[2:01:04] power
[2:01:04] and his great redemptive blessings
[2:01:07] oh how he stands between the church and
[2:01:10] sin tonight how he stands between you
[2:01:12] and judgment bleeding
[2:01:14] playing
[2:01:16] here although i walked into a place up
[2:01:18] here in ohio where i had been just about
[2:01:20] to
[2:01:21] pass my opinion of judgment i've been
[2:01:23] eating a little duncan restaurant which
[2:01:25] had a great meeting i had to stay
[2:01:27] several miles out in the country at a
[2:01:29] little motel i've been eating at a
[2:01:30] dunkirk restaurant nice lovely people
[2:01:32] and on sunday they closed and went to
[2:01:34] church i had to go across to an ordinary
[2:01:36] little common american place to eat my
[2:01:38] dinner when i walked into the door to my
[2:01:41] surprise there stood up state police put
[2:01:44] his arm around the girl playing the slot
[2:01:46] machine now gambling is illegal in ohio
[2:01:50] and there is a law about himself
[2:01:52] breaking the law and perhaps the man at
[2:01:54] my age
[2:01:56] perhaps married to the family somewhere
[2:01:57] with his arms around some young lady
[2:01:59] standing there i look back across the
[2:02:01] reference
[2:02:03] some boys sitting back there drunk and a
[2:02:04] young lady
[2:02:06] not acting morally at all i was sitting
[2:02:08] down to my right side here to a boost
[2:02:10] which i was ready to sit down that said
[2:02:12] an elderly lady somewhat around 58 60
[2:02:14] years old old is my mother
[2:02:16] sitting there skin all anchored up a
[2:02:18] little bitty clothes on and all it was
[2:02:19] terrible and her toenails painted purple
[2:02:22] lips painted purple
[2:02:24] the harvest didn't fight you ever seen
[2:02:26] her hair cut real sharp and streamed up
[2:02:28] like that and she was drinking that's
[2:02:30] the two men with us sitting there
[2:02:32] horribly looking drunk one of them
[2:02:34] laying across the place
[2:02:35] of the table and when they
[2:02:37] excuse themselves and went out to the
[2:02:40] restroom i said that oh god
[2:02:43] how can you stand it
[2:02:45] how can you look at such as that when
[2:02:47] even in my heart mind as bad as i am if
[2:02:50] still i wonder if my little karen
[2:02:52] rebecca will have to raise up in such a
[2:02:54] generation to see that coming on lord
[2:02:57] why don't you just wipe it off from the
[2:02:58] face here uh why don't you just do it
[2:03:01] large
[2:03:02] i sat down there and just started
[2:03:03] weeping i saw a vision
[2:03:05] i saw as it was the world
[2:03:07] whirling around in the air and there
[2:03:09] stood a rainbow around that world and
[2:03:12] someone that was speaking to me that
[2:03:14] that's the blood of jesus christ
[2:03:17] around this world that keeps him from
[2:03:19] destroyed if god can see sin the day
[2:03:21] thereof that day you die every man under
[2:03:24] that blood there has a free moral agent
[2:03:27] to take your choice but if you ever die
[2:03:30] and your soul soars beyond the mercy of
[2:03:32] that blood you're already judged before
[2:03:35] you get there
[2:03:36] there's nothing left for you then i've
[2:03:38] seen myself i see my lord jesus standing
[2:03:40] there put a count of thorns on his head
[2:03:43] and the tears running down mixed up his
[2:03:44] blood as it was washed off with his
[2:03:46] beard and i seen my sins coming before
[2:03:49] him and every time he would come before
[2:03:51] him i guess
[2:03:53] he was shaking the thorns just sticking
[2:03:54] his round or his stagger back his state
[2:03:57] tolerance for giving he don't know what
[2:03:59] he's doing and again i would do
[2:04:01] something and then his blood was like
[2:04:02] the bumper on the car protecting the car
[2:04:05] a shielding me from the wrath of god
[2:04:08] undeserving now come to him slowly knelt
[2:04:12] down to him i said look down there
[2:04:13] laying in front and there was an old
[2:04:15] book of sin and my name wrote across the
[2:04:16] top i said lord will you forgive me
[2:04:19] certainly he said with loving eyes
[2:04:21] reached to his side got some blood out
[2:04:24] and rolled on its heart and
[2:04:25] sold it back to forgetfulness he
[2:04:27] said now i said thank you lord he said
[2:04:30] now i forgive you and you're condemning
[2:04:32] her
[2:04:33] oh that changed the picture for me
[2:04:36] i come out of it i walked over there and
[2:04:37] sat down to her and began to talk and
[2:04:39] she had some rough life back before i
[2:04:41] said well you never christian she said i
[2:04:43] was raised in a christian home

[2:16:28] he prayed and he cried and he prayed and
[2:16:30] he cried yeah and i finally got to the
[2:16:33] place where he just said not my will
[2:16:35] father thine be done
[2:16:37] because what he did have he did have
[2:16:39] that
[2:16:40] that anointing in the flesh
[2:16:43] of god
[2:16:45] and and of the power knowing you've got

[2:17:05] with sin no more he couldn't confront
[2:17:07] with the unbelief of the world no more
[2:17:10] oh yeah death
[2:17:11] and
[2:17:12] no matter where wherever he looked i
