very approach to you this morning is under that shed blood Lord and under that blood Lord there's no sin Lord there's no flaw there's no fault there's no imperfection Lord but there's perfect righteousness Lord because it's yours and Lord we're so thankful this morning that you're not looking at us Lord you're looking at the sacrifice and you look at us through the blood Lord and you see a sinless spotless bride Lord that you've ordained from the foundation of the world Lord and Lord we're resting in that this morning Lord we're resting that it was a perfect sacrifice we're resting in that finished work Lord God lord and that it released your word to go out now and to produce Lord the the thing that was required Lord to restore to redeem a people back to you heavenly father and Lord we're coming in this morning Lord for another portion of that Redemptive work Lord we're coming in to be changed Lord we're coming in to be drawn back to you Lord we're coming in to see your

father that it'll change us Lord in a way we've never been changed before Lord let us go out better than we came in Lord let us go out more like you than we came in we pray Lord we're asking these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen God bless you this morning turn if you would to 1 Corinthians 13 amen good to see brother Gerald and sister Betty back with us amen God's mercies to them as they traveled and Blanca and the boys made it to California safely yesterday with minimal delays so we thank the Lord for that and they're enjoying the sunshine and warmth while we enjoy the well the the warm warmth and the wind amen but uh certainly glad that they've made it safe and trusting the Lord will continue to be with them spoke with Brother David Nash this morning he sent some pictures so I just added them to the slides quickly this morning this was a they did a a TV he preached on TV there and that's the green screen they fill it in with something else when he's when he's preaching but he spoke and they enjoyed it enough that they asked him to come back and preach again so he did two uh television uh broadcast for his preaching then he went to katakam and this is a a new church that they've just built there and I commented on it to him I said that's a pretty nice church for for where they are there and and he said yes he says that's the new building they have and then he sent me this he said and that's the old building and they built the new building around the old building and so that they wouldn't be disrupted at all cuz it in there they don't have money to do it all at one time so they literally sometimes they'll buy one two 3 four five bricks at a time put them up and then they go on and they they save up some more and they build it up so they kept the old church inside the new church and then built up the whole new church all the way around it and then he shared with the brothers it's a a brother uh Eli the pastor and then a brother Eric who's a pastor in the middle in the translator and then brother Eric's father there is the driver that that takes them around and whatnot so he said this was last year and he says they grown and and they so they had to build a new building so that's what it looked like beforehand then he sent me this one at uh pomaro pomarola and this was a full house that they had there and so he he just wanted to share kind of what it looks like there when they're when they're preaching and then he had a wedding and preached two services as well so uh on that day so uh God he just wanted to share that with the church so you can see of course we supported him in this Honduras trip and he just wanted us to to see what he's doing and what the conditions are like and the people he's dealing with and those different things so he sends his greetings and his appreciation this morning he's ministering a couple Services again today Lord willing amen let's turn to the scriptures now to 1 Corinthians 13 chapter 8 and we're continuing with the same thought as the last couple of services Paul said charity never fath but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child as a child there's nothing mature that's what makes you a child as there's no maturity in there he says but when I became a man I put away childish things amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're taking a third and final service on this thought of coming into Perfection and and I want to kind of start off just where we finished last service and we looked at these the we've looked at these attributes that Peter talked about that that would make us brother Bram said a dwelling place for God and the first seven of Faith all the way through brotherly kindness they're in you because you're a child of God and we have them in varying measures you know you look around this church and you look around your family and you look around Believers you know and there's some people have more than others but each one of us has exactly the amount that God has ordained for us to be where we are and the position we're in there's some places you know if you're if you're a mother you got to have a lot of patience and you'll see mothers have a lot more patience than the fathers many times because they're with the kids all day and when you're dealing with children all day you need patience the fathers are usually out dealing with adults and so maybe it's not not so necessary but then you get into things like wisdom and and knowledge in these things well maybe the father has it more or maybe a minister would have it more than a member of the lady or maybe a a Deacon would have it more than another brother in these different things but each one of us has it by the working of the holy spirit in our life for the condition we're in for the place we're in for the purpose we're in and so we don't look and say well why do they have more than I God's given you what you have need of and he gives them what they have need of and sufficient for the day is what he's given us amen but but it's the working of the Holy Spirit to draw those things out of us we don't have the Holy Spirit when we have those necessarily but it's to draw them out of us and to prepare us now for the dwelling place of God but as we said said last service and the service before when when we come to that eighth attribute this charity this agape love this Divine love this isn't an attribute but this is now a person this is a life this is a personality that's inside of us and so we don't we don't have that we've got to get it and when Paul said to add it to you you don't get to add it as if it's it's something that you can develop in yourself but it's something you got to receive you don't earn it but you can receive it it's it's not it's a it's a free gift that's given to us it's not something that that we're owed in any way but we've got to follow a path to get it amen acts 238 is the simple path that we're supposed to follow repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and it reminds me we talked about Revelation 3 where there's a people in this age and it's it's our age that think they're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and the prophet of the age the seventh angel speaking by the holy spirit is to remind them you don't have anything you're miserable you're poor you're wretched you're blind and naked and the worst thing is that you don't even know your condition that's why the prophet had to come was not to tell you your condition but to let you know you don't even understand you're in that condition and to try and open their eyes so they could see their condition and then what follows after that is zealous repentance not just repentance but zealous repentance to really be serious about it you know I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord and it was a zealous repentance because even being raised in a message uh family and a message church and these different things you're raised around the truth you think that you're all right but when you come into to the presence of God that first time in true repentance all you can say is I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I was wrong I am wrong there's nothing here I had didn't have what I thought I had and then all I could say in that presence was forgive me forgive me you couldn't even raise your hand couldn't even raise your eyes you couldn't even raise your head because you were so aware of your own inability to get anything right that's the way it was amen and that's the way we we've got to come today is is with a zealous repentance because otherwise we'll get stuck in Tradition you can be in Tradition in a message church you can be stuck in the teachings of man in a message church you can get stuck in cold formality in a CH Message Church being in a message church is not what makes us a member of the Bride but having the message living in Us in the person of Christ The Living Word for our day that's what makes us a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen when we can recog I we're nothing that we bring nothing to the table except a vessel all we are is a vessel and it's up to him to turn it into a vessel of Glory and Honor and these different things but I want to take us back to our opening scriptures we settle into this thought this morning and Paul said this charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away and we know that this agape love this charity is Supernatural because it never fails and we spent time in the last Services talking about man's failures and everything we do still fails everything we make still corrodes and rusts and breaks and fractures and it's uncertain and we don't know when it's going to fail all we know is that it's going to fail you know it's amazing how you can be driving your car for 150 or 200,000 kilomet and nothing's going wrong and then it seems like in a day you've got5 or $10,000 in repairs why because men's things break doesn't matter how well it was put together doesn't matter the level of quality control whatever man comes up with it's got flaws it's it's got an it's got a finite life to it and things fail and they break amen but there's only one thing that never fails and that's Divine love because what it's the Living Word Christ in you that's what makes it not fail is that it's Christ The Living Word remember the scripture says in Matthew 24 it says Heaven and Earth shall pass away that means everything from the heavens and and the Earth will pass away but it says but my words shall not pass away so when we come into this Capstone of of Charity when we're sealed by the Holy Spirit we're not coming so much to Perfection but Perfection is coming to us amen it's a person of Christ that's coming to us because nothing in my life nothing in my hand I bring only to thy cross I cling we read those words last service amen the simple fact is that God makes himself small enough that we could actually receive him makes himself small enough that we could accept him and understand him in a way that makes him live inside of our lives that we can that he can be revealed to us and he can pour himself into us and he can actually manifest himself through us in our little lives in our little vessels in these Earthly vessels that we have what a thought this morning can you imagine think this morning the great Eternal God if you've got the Holy Spirit has made him SM self small enough to live inside of you I I don't think we understand this morning what we have in inside of us if we've got the Holy Ghost it is the great Eternal Jehovah living inside of us this morning and we're going to get into what that means in the next couple of services about what it means when he's on the inside when you've got a strong man in the house when you've got the great Eternal God living inside of you resident in this domain what is possible what is possible for you and what is possible for those that you come in contact amen but Paul says after this charity though it never fails he says but right now we know in part and we prophesy in part he's not saying we don't have knowledge he's not saying we don't have prophecy he's saying we don't have preaching in fullness but we've got it we've got a portion we've got these things you know and as we come up to this charity everything we've had to this point is a foretaste it's a shadow it's a spoonful of the great picture of the great water that's available to us it's just a little bit he says you've got something good am mean this is a whole process of God and if God's working in your life and you don't have the Holy Ghost and you know you don't have the Holy Ghost don't don't ignore the little things that God's doing in your life there's great things that are that are going on in a person's life when they come to Christ and they receive salvation amen there's deliverances there's Miracles there's provision you know you look at the the life of the Apostles and the the disciples and before they ever got the Holy Ghost there were signs and wonders and healings and great demonstrations of of God in their life but it's all in part it was all in part Peter had it in part he had wonderful things but he had it in part and Peter kept failing he kept failing why because he didn't have it in full but you'll find when Peter comes in full now when he gets the Holy Ghost and things change in Peter's life and he never he never goes back on those things Paul's saying until we get charity until we get Divine love until we get the Holy Ghost everything we have is in part it's a bit it might be 95% it might be 95% remember brother Braham said he says those those those um those make Believers they'll walk right up to Jordan they'll do the entire Journey but they won't Cross Jordan into Canaan 95% 99% of the way there they might have had 100t 150 200 ft to cross of water at that time and they stopped short having walked maybe hundreds and thousands of miles in the desert over 40 years they stopped short over the last couple hundred feet they won't go in brother bam says they see the Holy Spirit they see the full word and they refuse it to go back to where they're comfortable amen but brother Brandon would go so far as to say until you get the Holy Ghost things are out of order you might have everything but it's out of order it's not in the place it's supposed to be it's not set up why because they're perfect gifts and we're going to get into this in a bit they're perfect gifts and perfect gifts need a perfect one to operate them and guess what I'm not the perfect one and unfortunately you're not the perfect one either so we've got to have somebody else come into US amen the problem with having something that is not not not that is in part is that it never just works right do you ever see in Canadian Tire or Princess Auto they'll have a a rack there that's got parts or or or things that are written down marked down they'll give you 50% off and they'll say missing this part and if you know anything about that that instrument or that that that tool you know it won't work without the part so it's worth nothing without that part but they're willing to give it to you at 50 % off in the hopes that you don't realize because it says as is where is no returns no nothing they're hoping that you think you can make that thing work the way it's supposed to even though it doesn't have a critical part and you know what happens when you buy something or you have something that isn't quite the way it's meant to be it never works right you know what we do don't we brother Matt we jury rig it we jury rig it and the whole time you're using something that's jury rigged I'm seeing some smiles here I think some of us have spouses that jury rig from time to time when you jury rig it you're always waiting for it to break for it to snap for it to fail for it to cause damage cuz you know you know it's not right you know it's not right and all you're doing is hoping it holds on long enough to get the job done so you can get it out of the way turn it off unplug it or do whatever it is you need to do throw it out maybe the case is you're just trying to get it there you're just trying to get it to do what you need it to do but the thing is we're in a walk to eternal life and it's not going to work with a jury riged life it's got to have the full picture it's got to have the full assembly there amen amen we talked about La last service how Paul realized early on that charity never fails and he said everything I had all the knowledge I had it was but dun I'm bringing nothing to the table amen and Paul knew his ways weren't perfect Paul knew that he would fail Paul knew that he had faults but Paul realized early on that it's got to be Christ that lives in me we read that scripture in Galatians where he said I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ lived liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul knew Paul was the weak link Paul knew that he was a thing that was going to hold back the working of God in his life and if he could get himself out of the way then God could work in him in a proper way amen we're talking about a dwelling place for God this whole series is on being the dwelling place of God and the simple truth is until God comes in and seals this house the house is open for visitors listen God can come into an unbeliever life he can absolutely he can we see it but guess what Satan can too demons can too because what the house is not sealed anybody can walk in and use it demons live rentree in a lot of homes today if I can put it that way in a lot of bodies and a lot of Lives why because their soul is not sealed but until it's sealed then I can have control and that's as bad as a demon cuz I'm in a fallen condition so until I'm sealed until this Capstone of love comes down then there's going to be problems because the house is not full the house is not complete it doesn't have what we need we need Christ The Living Word inside of us and if we don't then failure is inevitable brother Brown would put it this way he says let God add to the church let God give to the church see those gifts are in the church right in here this morning there Gifts of speaking in tongues there's Gifts of Prophecy there's Gifts of everything setting in here in here today he's not just talking to them in every Church of True Believers the gifts are available he says but if you'll just not go to hanging after that gift he says if you do you're going to get the gift without the giver see the thing of it is seek after God and then he says seek after love of God in your heart and then as God wants you he'll move you into whatever he wants you to do see that's it he says that's how the church is put in order then he says so friends find Divine love and favor with God then God if he finds favor with you will give his gifts unto you but first find The Giver seek the giver and then the gifts will come as God sees fit to give it to you do you believe that he says so now when you go around like this and different people are seeking all night for gifts and things like that he says go back till you find love he says till you shake hands with your brother across the street then then we'll talk about more more about getting gifts in that's right when you love the love when you get the love of God in your heart then you talk about gifts you say brother John I want spoken word Authority I want third pole I want signs and wonders I want Miracles get Divine love because without Divine love the only thing that will operate those gifts is you and that will cause them to fail amen and you'll just just make a bigger mess Paul had experienced the Living God and a God that dwell in him and he's bringing this great Revelation to us and he's saying what you have is good but it's still imp part until the god of those gifts comes inside of you and starts to operate them amen if you don't have the giver then the gifts are of no use because you'll turn them into edifying instead of edifying the body you'll start to edify yourself we're selfish creatures unregenerated we beasts and beasts are selfish beasts are selfish and that's what happens to us every time amen unless God lives in us the gifts will never be perfect or mature that's what that word Perfection means it means it means it means complete or whole amen James said this do not Heir my beloved Brethren he says don't make a mistake he says don't don't be mistaken every good gift and every perfect gift is from Above That Word Perfect means mature complete full grown honorable you know what that tells me it tells me there can be an immature gift then there can be an imperfect gift he says and it cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning now notice the gifts are good and perfect but the Perfection is in The Giver of the gifts not in the gifts themselves he says he explains the the Perfection of the father because the Father of Lights he says there's no variableness there's no changing and then he says there's no sh shadow of turning it means there's no darkness in God and nothing can cast a shadow on God nothing can cast a shadow on the sun the sun will pass light over something else and that will cast a shadow on something else but you can't cast a shadow across the source of light try putting take a light bulb and try and cast a shadow over a light you can't do it you can cover it up you can surround it with something but the light never gets a shadow because it's the source of light a shadow means there is no light he says in God there is nothing that can overshadow him there's nothing that can change him amen he's the source of all light there's nothing can put God Into Darkness he says of his own will begat he us with the word of Truth so we were created we were be birth we were born by the word of truth and that's why we are what we are cuz it was true and so what comes out of it is truth as well amen we come from truth we're living in truth and we are Truth for the world to see how by the word of God God living in us the word of Truth is living out inside of us he said of his own will beat us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures a specific kind is what that means cuz we're the only kind like us there's no other children of God except us he says you're showing something in these perfect gifts he says now wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath so James pointing out God is the author of every good gift every perfect gift every mature gift but as we said there there are not just good gifts but that means there must be not good gifts and there must be immature gifts as well as mature gifts because if you don't have God that's what happens is you're going to have imperfection there we'll talk on those a bit later in the series when we we talk about being fitted into the body of Christ but make no mistake there is such thing as an imperfect gift and I'm going to tell talk about myself even this morning morning about what that looks like but Paul says this he says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is imp part shall be done away with that means there's a time for the impart and then there's a time for the perfect amen there's a time of growing and then there's a time of maturity there's a time of development and then there's a time of perfection you can't come to perfection without the development time you can't come to perfection without the impart time time and I think it's the greatest danger we have in the message is that we're preaching perfection without reminding the people that there's an inart time as well we we look at you know we've heard it so many times over this Pulpit from Brother Gerald and he talk about Luther and justification and Wesley with sanctification and we put that back in those days but that's not what happens we've got to go through the exact same thing just cuz we're at the peak cuz we're at the Pinnacle at the Capstone does not mean we don't go through the entire process we've got to go through that entire thing and because we we have an understanding of what the word is doing and where God's going and how he's done things we think that we can just jump to Perfection but we've got to go through the impart to get to the perfect that's why I Don't Preach from 1963 John word only CU that's the Perfection point but everything leading up to that was the impart point and there's truth there and there's growth there and there's a development that's going on there and you've got to go through the same path that that prophet of God did that Paul went through that Peter went through that all of them went through to come to a place of perfection to come to a place of maturity to come to a place of adoption we don't get to skip to the end because we're in the end time age but rather we have an accelerated growth through that to get us to what rapturing condition in about 70 years give or take amen but I want to talk about this this part that when that was it perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away because I I'm going to talk about my own life because I believe I'm called to preach I believe that God has given me a gift to minister to the people of God I believe I'm anointed to do it and that's something I never wanted and I definitely never expected but let me say this did you know that I preach at work I do I I'm asked to speak on a regular basis both regionally both nationally and and when I do those things I'm using the gift of preaching amen and because we got to realize when it comes to preaching there's two elements there's a gift to present information and that's one element and the second is the gift to be yielded it's two things because you have to study remember what the apostles did they studied and prayed that was that was why they brought in De deacons so they could study and pray you I I was talking I won't I won't name names but I was talking to some ministers and you know or a minister and and and they said you know you you can't go up there with notes you you you can't go up there with an idea of what you're going to say because the anointing is going to tell what to say Well then why did the apostles have to study and pray because you got to have something that outflows something's got to build up this has to be quickened but unless you read it what's going to be quickened without this the only thing that be quickened are my thoughts and what does that do it leads the people to death so you got to come with a thought the prophet of God would come to the pulpit with a set of notes whether he got through them or not that was up to to the Lord but he would come up with those things so you got to study and you got to prepare and you got to have something there so there's a gift to prepare and then there's a gift to deliver and the gift to deliver has to be him not me that's where the real gift is but when I'm at work I can speak as if I'm preaching and I I I've realized what's going on and I know it sounds weird but I just relax when I get into speaking mode and I I had to do a national um presentation here not too long ago and there's a director on the team and we were going through the the slide deck in that and she said she she expressed uncertainty about what I had there because most people when they do a PowerPoint presentation they load it up with text they put all this information on there one I know that's not effective but two that's not the way I work and so I had minimal text on there and she expressed uncertainty but she said it's your presentation you do what you want so I did and I spoke and she listen to the whole thing then afterwards we had a conversation she said Jonathan I don't know how you do it but it just works she said I didn't think it was going to work well based on how you'd set it up it wasn't going to work but she said it just works why because I'm using my gift I literally I I I know exactly what's going on when I do it I know exactly what's going on when I do it amen but that's the imperfect cuz that's just me with a gift and I've had it for a long time if even through high school and in the University I wanton an award in University for speaking but that's not the gift of preaching that's a gift of speaking but a gift of preaching is a gift of speaking yielded to the holy spirit so when I'm at work I'm not yielding to the Holy Spirit I believe I'm a a holy ghost filled man and I believe God can lead and bless me in these things but I'm not anointed to preach about clean tech that's just my job I can get a benefit from the gift but that's not the real gift that's the imperfect that's the impart okay but what happens now is is we come up here to to a service and I've got my 15 pages of notes you know you know what the scariest part of the service is for me the first five minutes because I don't know where it's going to go I I write a I write a paragraph here to give myself something to say cuz you got to start somewhere but then after that I don't know what's going to happen now V show back there him and I chuckle sometimes because he'll look and he'll see I've got 35 slides and I'm 40 minutes in and I've only done 12 and he knows he's off his notes and then sometimes I can rip right through it that's just the way God does it different times but this the the I don't want to call it the scariest moment but but I would maybe call it the the the most curious moment is what's going to happen in those first five minutes because I'll get up with an idea of what what's going to happen and it doesn't it doesn't even happen and that's why we've got to be yielded that's the thing is to yield now everything I've done and say Lord here's my part this is my part I I've spent the time I put in the effort I've marked it down I've developed a path of thought and idea now you take it and turn it into whatever you want that's the gift the perfect is the yielding amen what is it it's matured because now instead of me using it it's him using it the difference between an impart gift an immature gift and a perfect gift a mature gift is the user not the gift it's the user if the perfect one is using it it's a perfect gift if the mature One is using it it's a mature gift but if it's me or you using it what is it flawed failed bound to selfishness that's the way it works amen I I'm not I'm not trying to make myself look good here this morning I I I consider myself the least of preachers you I tell that story about Wendy Bagwell and the sunlighter he was a gospel uh Christian gospel singer and he said Lord give me a great voice you know that I can I can you know just just just Bless the people and he said and the Lord said no but I'll give you an audience that doesn't know the difference that's the way I look at it that's the way I look at it cuz who am I I me I know my own inclinations I know my my my own of doing things and I've said it before when God called me to preach I said I don't think this is a good idea because of my weaknesses because of my inclination my need for Perfection my need for practice my my need for all of those things to to to to come and do the best at things and you can't do that in preaching the harder you try the worse it gets I imagine it's the same for worship for whatever it is the more you try and Lead God the worse it gets and so that's been a real that's been a real test for me it's it's been a real growth for me amen the prophet of God would bring notes to the to the pulpit and how many times would we hear him he'd say you know I've got I I'm not even a third of the way through I'm on page two and I've got 15 and he's three hours into a message why a perfect gift brother brandham got to the place he had a gift to to speak I believe because he could bring things in such Simplicity it's not hard to understand what brother Brandon was preaching amen but that second gift was to take that and now be used of God and brother BR was so gifted that he didn't often even know what he was saying saying remember when he get into the Visions when he get under that specific anointing he'd say now was what he said true cuz he doesn't even know who he said it and if you ever watch the the videos of him doing the discernment lines he'll say now is this the patient is this the patient is this the person he doesn't know who went who's come and gone in that moment he doesn't know if this is a new one the one he just prayed for he doesn't know anything because he's so completely yielded to the Holy Spirit and that's Perfection that's maturity and what is it it's total surrender to let God use you that's what we're talking about but I want to take a quick dive into this thought on US versus God because remember what we read There He says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things Paul points to three elements that are childish I spake I understood I thought see now we focus on the spake understood and thought but the childish is the ey I thought I understood I spake that's the thing that makes us childish amen it's us using it that makes us childish and it's when God uses it that it steps into maturity brother B talks about this he's talking in this is church order after the seals he says now I'm telling you all see now a few years ago you were children with these gifts remember the things got out of order in the church and they actually had a church they had the church split away after this because the people with gifts didn't want them in order they didn't want them in subjection to the Holy Spirit real gifts unyielded vessels he says you were children with these gifts playing back and forth you had it therefore you used it he says but you've been to a long school now and it's time to be men and not use them just to play with they gifts they're sacred they're of God and you don't play with them he says let's let God use them that's what your min wants to be in other words Perfection is when God steps into you and uses you uses your gifts uses your life uses your access uses your opportunity uses your career your job whatever it might be when God steps in and using us uses us that's when Perfection comes in it's not just floating around it it's not just happen sense it's not just well I can do this therefore I will that's not going to work he says you've been playing around too much he says but now you've been through a long school and now you know that God's got to set them in order and you got to let God start using them and how many times a brother Bown say the the the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet he says you might have a gift to speak in tongues but you got to be able to hold that until the preaching's done he's not saying your your your gift is not right or real he's saying it's got to be put in order and it's the same thing for every portion of our life every gift we have whether it's tongues whether it's helps whether it's preaching whether it's laying on of hands healing knowledge whatever it might be it's got to be put in order that God can use it cuz otherwise we get ourselves into situations where we ought not to be and we tend to make a mess of these things and man if we can just recognize the idea that lord I can't do this so if you'll step in it'll work its way out cuz charity never faileth amen my wife and I I think I've mentioned this before we know a man that had a gift of discernment and he was a preacher and you know you know he used that gift regularly in the services and even her own family experienced it at times that man when he was in university was unconverted of course but he still had that gift and he knew what everybody was holding at the card table you can't beat a man that knows every card at the table CU he knows when to fold and when to hold then he comes into the church and he he he has a a salvational experience he gives his life to the Lord and he's preaching doing all these things but what happened eventually was that man was not sealed by the Holy Ghost and today he's living out in the world and he's a dog trainer that's it it never came to maturity the gift never came to maturity and what you would see was he started to use it to embarrass people to put people in a corner rather than doing what doing it for edification for the glory of God to help the body brother Brown he's bringing around this idea of gifts versus versus a surrendered life and a and a life according to the word he says so all of these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues I mentioned how many many of these denominational Services I've kind of scanned through in the last time and you know what I've under come to realize most of them are saying more or less the same thing when they speak in tongues they have a common thing that they say and do and people just say the same thing over and over again it makes no sense it's just people making noise noises he says and all these other things he says when that which is perfect he says and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication brother say God interprets his word how by bringing it to pass that's Divine Vindication God comes behind the word and he says this is my word and I'll show you because I'm here and I'm here in your midst and he do signs and wonders and signs and wonders and signs and wonders and me Perfection can come outside of the full word of God we're in the Omega Church the alpha church had it and they fell away and then we had a restoring Prophet came back to us and what's he doing he's restoring the full word so that we can have the full benefit the full effect of that word inside of our Lives brother Adam was basically saying you you came all the way up to the you did the you came to the fun part the gifts are the fun part that's the blessings the outpouring of the spirit on the out outside you can come into a service you can shout You Can Dance you can see all the effects of the spirit of God that's it's fun it's fun you go into a service like that and you're you come out you're like whoa but then you fall flat on your face on Monday and he says you never came to Perfection because you didn't get the giver you just got the gifts you got the blessings without the blesser amen but I want to come back to that part about I spake I understood and I thought because as we come become an adult in Christ those things start to fall away and you start to realize your lack of of understanding like we talked about job you start to speak less you start to listen a bit more James said this we just read it wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath I've heard it say God gave us two ears and one mouth that means we should listen twice as much as we talk I think that's pretty good for a Believer amen listen more talk less brother Brown says this I believe that every Born Again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves I believe each one of you Methodist and Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine New Birth and has now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox now don't put it on them you can sit in a cold and formal condition in a message Church we've got churches where all they preach is Mysteries and they tend towards colder and more formal and then you got ones that preach all about the blessings and the moving of the Holy Spirit and it's hot you can be in any condition in a church in a message church but watch what he says he says but because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle you might be the only miracle that people will ever see they may never see anything else but you and let me tell you if you go in one day and you're an unbeliever and you come in uh the weekend after or the week after and you've had an experience with Christ you'll be different and they'll say what happened to you and we've seen it we've seen it I remember when I got baptized and gave my heart to the Lord and I went back to school I was testifying to everybody everybody knew I got baptized and every everybody saw a difference but that's got to continue not just a one day a one week experience but something that continues and grows from there on in brother Braham says unless that happens you cannot be a Christian you cannot come to Christ and Christ cannot dwell in you and nothing change it makes no sense because Perfection has come and if nothing changes that meant you already were perfect and we know that's impossible he says there must be a paradox for you to become a Christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of God God Alone is the only one can do it he says and it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it that's the Paradox that's the miracle what it was to bring it now into its full potential what he can make of it I want to add this very familiar scripture before we push into this a little more Paul said I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me what get out of our childish behavior slow to speak quick to hear slow to wrath see we think it's about the big things but before the big things happen the little things have to happen that's it we're we're looking for the supernatural without the supernatural it's all got to happen inside of here first we want the supernatural to be operating but in order to for the supernatural to operate the natural has to die out that's the simple truth the natural has to die out for the supernatural to have preeminence in our life you know when when John had his ministry but as soon as Christ comes on the scene he says he must increase and I must decrease he knew where he stood in the equation and it's no different for our lives when Christ comes then there must be an immediate decrease and a continuous decreasing of us so that the supernatural can come in brother B puts it this way he says God can do without you he can do without me but we can't do without him we've got to have him for he is life and he alone not to know his book not to know this or know that or know the Creed but to know him as life know him as the person Christ in you the word made flesh in you the key there is made flesh because otherwise it can be up here and we think we've got it but it's got to be manifested every revelation God gives us is for manifestation it's to change us not just to know but to be that's what we're looking at he says that's knowing him when he you and he become one like I said last night in the super sign he has got to come in you you God and man must come one he says then you're conscious of your littleness that is the great dying out experience is you are conscious of your littleness and the more that God uses you the more little you become it's the only way God works humility is power with God the prophet of God said amen when we realize our littleness and his greatness that's when things really start to happen that's when you're cooking with gas as we say when he is increased and you are decreased I want to drop into the Practical side of this for a little bit as we go into the second half of this service because like I said last time we can't have a supernatural experience in an Earthly body and not have changes in the Earthly amen when the supernatural comes down it's got to have an effect here and we've read all about what charity does and how it was kind and forgiving and it Bears all things and these different things but the main thing is is that we're here to manifest God we're here to manifest the word for our day and that means that everything that God does everything the Holy Spirit does is to manifest the word through us that's what God's trying to do is produce Christ in US Little Messi hates brother Brandon will call call us the anointed ones that's what we're supposed to be he says this Paul said he could do all kinds of things even move mountains and still he's nothing where there's tongues it'll cease where there's knowledge it'll vanish where there's prophecies it shall fail but when that which is perfect has come it shall endure forever he said and love is perfection he says God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever Shivers whoever s shakes whoever speaks who so he says no whosoever whoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life he says believe that children I'm coming back to Simplicity here he says they try to make it so complicated these things and them things he says it boils right down to one thing your personal faith in God that's it he says that tells it for by faith not by Feeling by faith not by Emotion by faith not by sensation but by faith are you saved and that by he says because you sought the Lord because you were a good person because God by Grace fornew you and ordained you to eternal life so in all of this I love Simplicity and we see Simplicity here and brother Bram says faith is the key faith is the key that unlocks the door it's the starting point it's the foundation and everything in your Christian walk is built on that Faith amen you'll get virtue knowledge patience and all these things but faith is the key that opens up the Christian walk it doesn't have to be complicated and I hope I'm not complicating it with this service I I'm showing you the intricacies of the process of God but let me tell you for many of us we'll go through this entire statue of a perfect man and only have glimmers of the fact that we're actually going through a school of training because for us it's just normal life life as a child of God is different as Life as a child of Satan cuz God's growing and he's training and he's teaching us and that's just life to us us that's normal for us to go through things and to deal with things and half the time we don't even realize what God's done in our life until we come to the trial we come to the test and we pass it and we say how did that happen God have been putting you through normal life which is the raising the training the development of a child of God and then you came to a test and realized that you've been going to school the entire time you've been going to church you've been sitting under the hearing of the word you've been having your devotions you've been humbling yourself to the word of God and it's having this big effect and you don't even realize it until the test comes and you pass with flying colors and you realize oh my goodness God's working with me the test is when you realize God's been working with you so often cuz the day today is just a little bit here and a little bit there but when the test comes it all gets put into action and you realize oh my goodness I have more than I thought you know my wife and I were talking about Simplicity the other day and you know when we had this big believe the sign movement and there were some people that were talking to to to my wife about it and they were they had this they they they gone and found this it's been around a while I'm sure this new fangled way of of of studying your Bible and linking this to that and you had to do this and you had to do that it was very technical and they said that's the way that that you're going to go into Rapture that's the way that you're going to come to Christ and my wife said if that's the case then my parents could never be saved right she said cuz they don't have that technical knowledge to put things together the way you're saying they have to they they don't have that intellect to put together things in study the way that you're saying is required to come to Christ it's simple it's got to be simple amen had he right had no clue about what the Seven Seals were but she had faith in the word of God and she believed it Peter and John the when the priesthood saw them they said that they were ignorant and and unlearned men uneducated but they said but they saw they knew that they had been with Jesus they had a life they had a demonstration that far surpassed the priests now the priests had the intellect that we're talking about to put things together in the Deep study and all these things but Jesus said you are of your father the devil just listening I've been listening to God in Simplicity and I just wrote this in my notes here this morning brother bradam said he reveals himself and works in simp it real simple so that everybody will understand it there isn't a test to get into the Gates of Glory it is not based on your knowledge of Doctrine or your understanding of the Bible the question is if thou can't believe all things are possible do you believe do you believe do you believe and if you say yay you enter in cuz it's by faith that we enter in amen it's not by study but we ought to study it's not by understanding though we gain understanding it's not by knowledge though we have knowledge amen but it is by the receiving of the word of God by Revelation you can't get a revelation unless you read it or hear it you got to hear it to get a revelation of it but you can study yourself until you're blue in the face and not catch it and know if God gives it to you though no amount of study will ever remove it if God gives you a true Revelation it cannot change because God doesn't give a revelation that changes because God doesn't change so if he gives it to you by Revelation the gates of hell can't Prevail against it because it's the word revealed in you and after that no amount of study can take it out but here's the thing no amount of study can put it in either God's got to reveal it to you amen and when he reveals it it'll go into your your life and it'll have an effect and it'll change the way you think and the way you look at things and the way you do things brother B says God so loved you that he gave his son that you might be saved and filled with the spirit and have his love projected in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost he says it makes you love everybody oof everybody brother John yep that's the reason Christians have their ups and downs the way they do while you could be on a Housetop no matter what condition you're in he's talking about a light on a house he says if you love God you know where you stand why if you love God it's because he first loved you you recognize your position in Christ you recognize that you were called before the foundation of the world you recognize your security in him you know when I I I Marvel and I've met men like this that not just Jesus I Marvel at but Jesus response to people and situations always makes me Marvel because he he never gets flustered he never gets worked up he never gets reactive he's always calm cool and Collective why he knew where he stood he knew who he was he knew his purpose he knew his leadership and because of that he didn't have to react to anybody he's just doing and being what he is amen when you know who you are you have no reason to try and be what somebody else wants you to be it doesn't play in you don't have to worry about it I I mentioned brother Phil mugby and and he he lived in Calgary I think he's gone back out out to uh somewhere outside of Africa I think now but he he was the most calm Collective man I've ever talked to and and I marveled and I said Lord I need some of what he's got because he would stand there and people would just be giving him the gears and he is so calm and cool and then he respond in love every time not flare up not get worked up he just speak back the word in kindness and in love time and time again I marveled that I talked to him about it and he gave me some insight on how he got there amen but I want you to understand if faith is the key then love is the Conquering weapon love is the Conquering weapon faith is the key but love is what God has given us for the believer because it's the Holy Ghost making the word work then James said be quick to hear slow to speak slow to wrath then Paul says I put away childish speaking understanding and thinking so what do we have to do we have to be quick to hear the Holy Spirit not ourselves slow to speak why lest it be our own words slow to anger lest it be our anger and not righteous anger what and in that take on the mind of Christ brother Bram had an experience with that demon-possessed man in Oregon if you remember and I want to read the story this morning we're talking about what this looks like practically cuz we're coming to Capstone we're coming to adoption uh we're coming to uh the the the Apex the highest point of the Christian Life and we tend to think it's this big signs and wonders thing and I'm not saying it's not there but those things follow they don't lead us but I want you to look like we see what this looks like in the prophet's life he says you notice at the first part of Portland Oregon that night I was standing on the platform and that Maniac ran to the platform to kill me he said I was just speaking like I am now this fell run down through a crowd of people thousands and they were standing in the street his eyes bulged way out and he was making his hands go up and down he ran up to the platform I thought maybe somebody was sick and he was coming after them he said it was about 150 200 ministers sitting behind me I looked at him and he run up that way and the preacher scattered like flies he says he just hit a preacher that day he was out of the insane institution and broke his jaw his collar bone and the police were after him the man had a reputation people knew what was coming he says and at the platform he runs straight up to me and blow real big like a goose pushed out his chest great big arms I weighed 128 then 128 lbs I won't ask the sisters to tell me their weight but I guarantee you brother Brandon weighed more than a lot of sisters I don't think we realize how small he was a lot of God's Great preachers tiny little men we met him tiny little men 128 lbs I think my lower half weighs 128 lb that's a tiny man folks brother Bram knew how to box though he says he weighed about 250 about 6' 4 in or something and he said you hypocrite you snake in the grass standing up here imposing yourself as a servant of God I'm going to take you apart right on this platform he says you better know what you're talking about when it's a maniac I just kept still and looked at him remember what we just read you have to know where you stand he said calling yourself a man of God rolled his arm up said I'm going to knock that little frame of yours Plum out over that audience there won't be a piece of you together when you land now put put yourself in the prophet's place he's ordained a prophet he's got a gift to preach he's got a calling to preach he's got signs and wonders following he said every Miracle you can think of replicated Jesus Christ in every way in signs and wonders he's been sent by the Holy Spirit to preach in Portland Oregon now listen in our Humanity what's our inclination Force Has Come What do we do match force with Force he brings a wrecking ball we bring a wrecking ball he brings an axe we bring an axe he brings physical threats we bring physical threats right we try and match up to what Satan's bringing the problem with that is we start using Satan's tools and as soon as I pick up Satan's tool I've got no Victory if I respond with what's being taken to me I'm going to lose weapons of our Warfare are not carnal natural human beastly what is it we'd be up there maybe and in our heads we'd be saying I'm the prophet I'm the seventh Church age messenger glory to God I'm here by his word and we go after him we do our best shamgar interpretation wouldn't we we'd pick up whatever we had and we'd start wailing into him until he was dead or out cold maybe we do our best Sons the Thunder of impression what childish speaking thinking and reacting using Authority where it's not needed in a way it's not meant to to be used look at Elisha remember brother Bram has the same spirit that Elisha does right Elisha had an Elijah spirit in double portion and Elisha got mad and got caught up in protecting his name and Elijah's name and he killed 42 children with it under the prophetic authority of his life brother bradam could have done it watch this because that's not Capstone judgment comes after we leave church not while we're here Mercy is always the first option brother Ram said I knew he was well able to carry his threats out he said I just looked at him didn't spring into action not forced with Force he said I just looked at him not a preacher said a word they were gone and I looked and here come two police I just LED them to Christ one of their mothers was healed the Night Before Good Presbyterian woman he says they run out there to grab him and I said this is not a flesh and blood Affair brother just a moment thank you church when you're dealing with situations we've got to recognize we wrestle not against flesh and blood flesh and blood is hiding the supernatural element that inside of that person amen it's not just people it's not just events it's a battle between the supernatural good and the supernatural evil playing out in the natural realm amen you have to realize what's going on that's what Ephesians 6 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and darkness and these different things brother Braham says notice he said says just a moment thank you calm cool unruffled those little fellas backed off stood there a minute I just kept real still I'd be preparing myself he said I kept real still and I was going to tell him I'd say sir what's the matter and he spit right in my face he said you snake in the grass he said tonight I'm going to break every bone in your body and I was going to say I hope you don't that was brother bram's human response even in his Humanity brother bram's response would have been just fine I hope you don't I really don't want every bone in my body broken but listen to this as I started to say that God in his sovereignty the Holy Spirit came down and he said just spoke they thought it was me speaking but it wasn't no more than it is in the vision he said because you've challenge the spirit of God tonight you'll fall over my feet he says there's both prophecies now it had to be shown why he didn't speak the Holy Spirit spoke and God's words can't return to him void he said it said fall over your feet said you hypocrit said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over Drew back his arm and run at me real hard and he started to hit me and I said now the Holy Spirit has spoken catch now brother bram's back in it and he says Satan come out of the man and his arm was up he went M and rolled over like that and fell down right across my feet and pinned me there till the police had to roll him off my feet they said is that man dead I said no sir he worships that Spirit they pulled him out that man loved what he did that man woried the demon that was inside of him he loved to dominate he loved to bully he loved to wreck things he loved to break things up he was a dwelling place for a demonic spirit and when that demon went out of him he lost his strength as big as he was that demon was his strength he loved that feeling of coming in and just wrecking things like I said our inclination would meet his Wrecking Ball with our Wrecking Ball but we can't do that we've got to come with the weapon that God has given us rather than react to Satan the way he does Amen otherwise we're playing his game we've got to meet Satan with God's weapon and that weapon is love it's the Holy Spirit operating in love watch this brother says let me give you just a little inside of my life he's saying you want to you want to understand what happened here here's it is he says I'm going to tell you my brethren don't make any difference how emotional you try to be that's good anything without emotion is dead you can scientifically prove that so if your religion ain't got a little emotion about it you better bury it get some that's got some emotion but look brother the main thing if all your emotions is in sealed by the Divine Holy Spirit love it won't do you any good he said you know how I've had success in this one thing I contribute to it love that's right do you know Love Will Conquer anything no matter what it is why charity never faileth he says what was it did I hate that man I loved him he says a poor mortal in that condition ever have somebody just giving you the gears and you something just comes over you and you think what a horrible condition to be in and you're actually feeling sorry for them because of how bent out of shape how worked up how stressed how negative whatever it might be that person is I've dealt with it at work many times and sometimes you got negative NES everywhere and no matter what happens they've got a negative spin on it and you just sit there and say what a miserable life you must live nothing brother Braham says that poor mortal in that condition that wasn't that man speaking that was the devil he was possessed of the devil and the devil made the challenge and who challenged him back the Holy Spirit challenged him back if I challenge him watch out he'll beat me every time he'll beat me every time remember they had people that were going around and saying in Jesus name and in Paul's name and they said in Jesus name Jes Jus we know Paul I know but you sons of CA who are you and they ran him out and stripped them naked one man seven guys why they were trying to use somebody else's Authority I try and use something I don't have just Falls flat he says the Holy Spirit challenged him back and you know what happened now watch this church watch what happens when you defeat with love real love divine love he says there were wheelchairs Cs and stretchers you know how it was in The First beginning when that happened he says when he was speaking you could have heard a pin drop as the old saying is I I don't know how I'd how I'd act if if some man ran up and brother Matt or brother Joel wasn't able to tackle him and he came up and he fell at my feet I tend to think we'd have raised our hands and just started worshiping and praising the Lord Watch What Happens we're talking about perfection versus impart now he says but when all that Legion saw that their chief man had been slain every sick person Rose to their feet remember we read that quote last service where brother Bram says I believe there's a higher standard coming where the Holy Spirit would just come in love and sweep over the congregation and do what needs to be done he says every C was empty every wheelchair emptied up and the whole group was healed at one time and walked out because the power of hatred and the Power of Love had met together and love will overcome hatred every time he says love your enemy why Perfection had spoke perfect results followed listen laying on of hands is imperfect it's ordained but it's imperfect but now Perfection comes and nobody has to touch them because the perfect one is there love is there and it swept through the building and freedom everyone where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty can you imagine you're having a healing service all you got to do now is finish your preaching and go cuz the job's done why the Holy Spirit responded in love love not Authority not a beating of the chest not I'm this and I'm that the Holy Spirit spoke through 128 pound 5 foot nothing preacher and took the devil right out of the situation completely listen we might hate Satan but we've got to be able to work with people that have him in them all the time we've got to be able to deal with situations in love to wait to hear to speak slow to anger slow to respond not be reactive brother wasn't up there trying to prove anything brother brandham was just doing his job not confrontational not looking for a fight but then the Holy Spirit spoke and now brother brandham gets involved he walked out of that meeting without a scratch on him including no hatred in his heart because what what happens when we're dealing with hatred the danger is that you get nicked with the sword that's poisoned by it and that person that hates you that person that's bringing something against you you walk out with something against that person the same as they've got to against you and you didn't win that fight cuz you walked out scarred you walked out with a poison you walked out with a demon on your shoulder and your head that put Hate in Your Heart why cuz love didn't come into the situation brother Braham says this where there is prophecies it'll fail where there's tongues it'll cease and where there is knowledge it'll vanish away but when perfect love has come into the human heart all demons in hell will never be able to upset it what's Satan trying to do Church upset us what does it mean to upset get out of balance or get you off your foundation if I stand this up and I found a way and there is a point where I could get this to stand up there's a center of gravity mixed with where it rests and I could get this thing to stand straight up maybe I could do it this way maybe not hard to do let's go here it's imbalance surface is flat still good but if I give it a big knock gets out of balance and it starts rolling there's no coming back Satan's trying to get us out of balance reactive stand still brother brah said through all this all he did was Stood Still looked watched and waited for the Holy Spirit to speak and then stepped in he says when perfect love is coming to the human heart all demons in hell will never be able to upset it as we start to close we know that story of that gery bull that was in the field on the farm and it was a killer bull that had already killed one man and brother Brandon was doing out on patrol um for wildlife services I think at that time and he had he said oh I'm close I'm going to go pray for that man and he took a shortcut through the field and he got halfway through the field and the blll rose up and he realized he was in a pickle he said I was too far from the fence to go run and there was no tree around I'm in the middle of the field and I got nothing nowhere to go nowhere to hide but brother says well I was supposed to have a gun but I didn't have one and so I looked back to the fence it was too far to run no tree to get into so I thought this is probably the end then you ever get in a situation you think this is the end it's the end of the relationship it's the end of the job it's the end of the road he says so I looked at him you know he says now this is not a joke when I looked at that bull and he lowered his head and threw his horns on the ground threw the dirt back over him and he started coming what do you do when somebody with bad intentions Comes Your Way Church here's an example he says now instead of hating that bull I was glad I didn't have no gun brother saying you know we talk about spoken word authority and we want power and those different things brother brah saying I'm glad I didn't have any natural power to kill that bull CU otherwise what would he have done killed the bull what had the bull done wrong Church nothing was what the bull doing worthy of death no he's just being a bull our desire for power is easily manipulated to become abuse of power and a gun is one of the most absolute ways to abuse power just because you can doesn't mean you should that's what he's saying he's saying I'm glad I didn't have a gun cuz why now something greater than a gun could step in amen and anger is not the tool of God in a believer's life he said I loved him now that seems strange this is the same service that he's he just talked about the the maniac in in Oregon he said I want you to remember this I love that fellow I thought poor fellow I'm in his place I'm on his territory he was sleeping and I woke him up just got him roused up Church like I said before a beast can't help itself a beast has an ingrained response it's instinctive they can't choose I remember when I was at the San Diego Zoo and they let out the lion cubs to play with the dad and one of them bit down a little too hard well what did he do he turned around he swatted it hard and he growled at it why it's just a kid didn't really hurt the big bad 400b lion in that way but his instinct is to react the way he did what force and swatted him right off they said that actually they'll often eat their children in anger or to preserve the pride too many mouthe to feed beasts have no choice they do what they do when you're dealing with unconverted people they're in a beast nature a man or a woman without the Holy Ghost is a beast and we've got to be able to recognize that beasts act a certain way because they're a beast and they can't help it and it's up to you as a converted soul to act different than the Beast that you're dealing with amen he says just got him roused up up and I said to him not knowing what's happened the holy spirit's entered now slow to speak quick to hear he I said creature of God he's a fallen creature but he's still a creature of God he says I am the servant of God I'm on my way to pray for one of god- sick children now you can't bother me because I'm God's servant now I'm sorry I Disturbed you church sometimes our apology is for disturbing sometimes our apology is for making people act the way they are brother Braham didn't do anything wrong sometimes we don't do something wrong and the apology still has to be made because it caused a reaction not because you did something wrong because you caused a reaction that's a weak point in that person's life maybe they're unconverted sometimes we've just got to apologize why to let them know we value their soul their life their Eternal destination our apologies for for their sake not for ours our our our heart may not condemn us but we can apologize for their sake he says you can't bother me because I'm God's servant now I'm sorry I Disturbed you in Jesus name go lay down he says I was not a bit more afraid of that bull than I was the man that night or my brethren sitting here he says and that bull ran right to me you spoke the word brother brother John I spoke the word stand still remember when the Holy Spirit speaks it never fails he says till he got within about 10t of me he was a ways away I think brother bam said 30 or 40 feet so he covered 2/3 or 3/4 of the distance he ran from Brother Paul to this front Pew I'd have been getting ready to run he said I just stood there he says he came right close to me soorry say till he got about 10t of me and I wasn't no more afraid than I am what than I am now why perfect love casts out fear he says and he got right close to me and he stopped and he looked this way and that way so depleted he had started out angry he's charged 20 or 30 ft and then he gets close and everything that's made him run is gone the wind have been taken right out of his sails he's got nothing left to keep him running at brother brandham why love has defeated his Beast nature he said so depleted sitting there confused standing there confused all snorting and ready to go and then 10 feet away he doesn't even know why he's doing what he's doing why he's heaving and frothing and all of these things why am I so tired why am I so worked up he says and I just looked at him and I thought poor fellow what pity and Sympathy for the Beast he turned right around walked over laid down and I walked right on by him brother Bram says he never even that bull never even looked at him again that's how completely conquered he was not with a bullet with love he says Love Will Conquer anything where there's tongues they shall cease where there's prophecies it shall vanish but when comes it conquers everything God so loved the world there's your great conquering right there he says that's where you're failing friends don't practice so much of whether you got gifts or not but practice that one real gift of love he says then you'd be better what is it love conquers all things love the Lord with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind with all your strength and faith will accompany that love Faith to what stand having done what you've been told to do stand wait trust believe what hold fast let God do the rest amen the musicians could come if they want you know as I was going through this and we we've talked about the childish side versus the mature side and as a man with children I have a firsthand look at what children look like and the younger the child is the more focused they are on the elves and they're very much about the here and now if you've ever seen they do these tests where they tell children okay I'm going to put a marshmallow or two in front of you and if you can and they'll leave them in a room alone for 30 minutes and they'll say if you don't eat it we'll give you 10 at the end and they'll give the children a choice you can have one or two now or you can have 10 at the end and almost none no children make it through to the end they can't handle that Temptation they can't they can't look to the Future and ignore the present I'm hungry it smells so good it looks so good good I've wanted a marshmallow our day whatever it is they can't do it you know and and every morning I make a smoothie and and Jensen and and and and Samuel wants some every time and so I've had to make more and more every morning but when I do I I pour mine in and I fill mine up and then I take whatever's left and I put it into two glasses but you know what if I give them the choice they'll inspect them closely for just the millimetric difference between which one has more and which one has less and they'll take that one every single time what is it me me me I I I now I try and pour them exactly the same but it's never exactly the same and so they'll look and they want the bigger one every single time and Samuel is is especially obvious about it the other day Blanca gave me some some chocolate and uh Samuel came in and he said can I have some so I cracked it in half but it was a it was an odd-shaped piece and so one side was obviously bigger than the other and he said dad can I have the bigger peace no shame no no no anything about him that would say you know maybe dad you're the bigger person you could have it no he wanted the bigger piece you know he's a child and he's all about himself and if can you imagine if I gave Samuel Authority he'd be a dictator everything for him everything for him we're talking about perfect love now who's got the authority in the house I do and then my wife has Authority because I've given her Authority and how are we supposed to act in love every time I'll be the first to say I don't but we're supposed to act in perfect love for their benefit not just for ours but there's times where frustration makes me say and do things that I maybe don't want to do there's times where maybe I'm selfish and I just want some peace or a break or whatever it might be and so I get them to do something that keeps them out of my hair or lets me sit back and relax for a little bit but that's not Perfection Perfection is when the holy spirit's moving for their benefit for their good according to what the word of God says and then Paul's talking about getting us to the place where Divine love dwells in US day by day and expresses itself that way that every action every reaction every move every word has love all over it that love is what prompts it to come out of us amen it helps us keep our mouth shut helps us keep our mouth shut helps us keep our anger in check amen and helps us to speak for the benefit of a soul that's worth 10,000 worlds cuz we're talking about souls that hang in the balance listen we're sealed we're sealed if I drop dead right now I know where I'm going church but when we're talking to people that are still in their Beast nature and sometimes it's still our children not all of our children have the Holy Ghost our co-workers definitely don't have the Holy Ghost everything we do has to be for the benefit of that Soul because that's the only thing that matters and you'll see that in the lives of Christ you'll see that in the lives of the the apostles you'll see in brother life you ought to see it in each and every one of our Lives we're dealing with the Eternal balance of a soul based on what we do what we say let's stand together if we would we read that quote the other day where brother R said we are the only Bible that many people will read I want to close with this one quote because I want to ask you today are they seeing Divine love the Holy Ghost seals you till the day of your Redemption but brother Ram says when you get the Holy Ghost you start seeking other Souls you want them to get what you've got you want them to experience what you have you want them to be where you are brother Braham said this he said I think we need the Christ the only way we see Christ is when he reflects in each other I see Christ in you you see him in me he says that's how we watch Christ amen I've got a ways to go we look at this I sayl help me help Jonathan klette to die out amen help me to be slow to speak quick to hear slow to wrath even righteous indignation needs to be slow so we can make sure it's truly righteous slow to speak have the mind of Christ so that the words that come out are covered in love not in Revenge not in hatred not in spite not getting back but for the sake of that person's soul amen you know there's going to be offenses come the scripture says and it says woe to them that are offended woe to them that cause the offense sometimes our reaction can determine whether that's an offense or whether that's forgiven if we don't get offended where's the sin our reaction could could determine brother Braham said the Eternal destination of the people we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis you know what that tells me we need perfect love every day of Our Lives flowing through us not authority to speak things in and out of existence cast this out and cast that out Lord take out the me first take out the me in the equation and then we'll see what we can do with the rest amen amen let's bow our heads each one heavenly father Lord talk about a higher standard Lord where every word every deed every step every thought Lord brought subject to the Holy Spirit by the word Lord we're preaching a high standard here Lord and we know we still fail Lord we're in frail vessels but Lord our desire is for victory victory in the love divine Lord that victory in the love divine put Souls on the other side Lord it brought people to you Lord it declared your word it manifested your word it made Christ Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in the eyes of the people Lord we desire to Glory you to glorify you Lord that our lives would be a a book that people could read Lord that they could see Lord a word that's living outside of each and every one of of us Lord God lord would you help us Lord even as we come to this table today Lord if we have odd against anyone Lord if we've done anything to offend Lord may we forgive may we ask forgiveness Lord and may we forget Lord and move on in the graciousness and mercy that you've extended us we pray Lord bless your people now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen let's sing that song power of Your Love 797 Lord I come to you let my heart be changed reew flowing
