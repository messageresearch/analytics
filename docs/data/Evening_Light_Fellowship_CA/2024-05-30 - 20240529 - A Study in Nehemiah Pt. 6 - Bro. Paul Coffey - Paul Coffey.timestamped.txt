[35:45] ask these things in the name of Jesus
[35:46] Christ
[35:49] amen okay so let's turn to Psalm 27
[35:59] starting at the 11th
[36:02] verse it's the Rapture Psalm brother
[36:05] randam did in the The Rapture message
[36:07] before he passed on so let start at
[36:11] verse 11 teach me thy way oh Lord and
[36:14] Lead Me in a plain path because of mine
[36:17] enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the
[36:19] will of mine enemies for false Witnesses
[36:21] are resen up against me and such as
[36:23] breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless
[36:26] I believed to see the goodness of the
[36:28] Lord in the land of the living wait on
[36:31] the Lord be of good courage and he shall
[36:33] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[36:36] Lord all right you may have your
[36:42] seats all right so this is part six in
[36:46] our study in Nehemiah I think the last
[36:48] time we talked about was other February
[36:52] and March
[36:53] so as always we'll do a quick
[36:56] review and uh this won't take long
[36:58] because it's we're no longer in the meat
[37:00] of the dates and all the kings and all
[37:02] that stuff is going to be a little bit
[37:03] more simple to do a
[37:05] review which is good for some
[37:08] people all right so the first point that
[37:10] we went through last time was that
[37:12] Nehemiah was not a royal he was not of
[37:14] Royal Blood he was not like Daniel um he
[37:17] wasn't a priest uh like Ezekiel was who
[37:20] was a first priest and then became uh a
[37:23] prophet when he went to Babylon or a
[37:24] scribe like Ezra but he was just a
[37:27] regular believer he was just a simple
[37:31] man just working away in his position
[37:34] and God came to
[37:36] him we talk about the two major themes
[37:38] of NE Nehemiah being restoration and
[37:40] maturity and how we saw that in
[37:43] nehemiah's life and his initial reaction
[37:45] to the news that he heard so he hears
[37:48] about the state of Jerusalem as we know
[37:50] at this point Jerusalem is it has the
[37:53] temple the temple has been restored the
[37:56] mixed marriages have been
[37:58] fixed through Ezra's um
[38:02] efforts but the state of Jerusalem's
[38:04] walls and its Gates were in disarray
[38:07] okay and which meant that at that time
[38:10] Gates and walls are for protect for
[38:12] protection and without protection you're
[38:14] open to any Thief you're open to any
[38:17] attack by all of Israel's enemies and at
[38:19] that time there were many enemies okay
[38:22] the Babylonians Rob the scenes because
[38:23] the Persians were were ruling but
[38:26] Israel's enemies never went away the
[38:28] moabites the am ammonites the
[38:30] amalekites all the different ones they
[38:32] were always there the Philistines they
[38:34] were always trying to take away from
[38:37] Israel okay so the people were in a
[38:39] constant state of angst and fear and
[38:42] distress because at any given moment
[38:46] what they thought they had could be gone
[38:48] any second their children could be
[38:50] kidnapped their wives could be kidnapped
[38:52] they could be killed their possessions
[38:53] stolen their crops stolen it wasn't in a
[38:56] good place okay so Nehemiah actually
[38:59] hears about this from his brother okay
[39:02] his brother brings it back to him tells
[39:05] about the state of Jerusalem and
[39:07] Nehemiah gets an immediate burden for
[39:08] the
[39:10] situation and then his reaction to that
[39:14] is that he goes into immediate prayer
[39:16] okay and this is the first indication
[39:17] that we see of nehemiah's maturity and
[39:20] how he reacts to trouble and stress he
[39:22] doesn't rely on the armor of Flesh he
[39:24] doesn't try to figure it out himself he
[39:27] goes to the main source of wisdom
[39:30] through
[39:31] prayer so that was essentially the gist
[39:33] of everything we went through and we
[39:35] talked about how his approach to God was
[39:38] perfect because he starts off by
[39:41] acknowledging God as God then he reminds
[39:46] God about his word and his Covenant with
[39:49] his people he reminds God this is the
[39:51] Covenant that you gave to your people
[39:53] through
[39:54] Abraham this is what you gave you swore
[39:57] by yourself to uphold this
[39:59] Covenant therefore you are
[40:02] obligated to follow this Covenant
[40:04] through no matter what he admits the
[40:08] sins of the people he includes himself
[40:10] in the sins of those of the People by
[40:13] repenting and says our fathers have
[40:15] sinned I have sinned we repent of that
[40:18] but we need your help now and he makes
[40:21] appeal to the Lord to give him favor to
[40:23] the king who was uh I think it was
[40:26] Darius at the time time could have been
[40:28] someone else it definitely wasn't
[40:31] Cyrus I forget his name now it's one of
[40:35] the huar or ar xeres or something so the
[40:41] the the the main thing that we went
[40:44] through all with all this was that
[40:46] Nehemiah approached God in the correct
[40:49] way he made his appeal to God and then
[40:51] left his request in God's hands for Gods
[40:55] to take for God to take over So today
[40:58] we're going to go through what followed
[41:01] that in terms of his conversation with
[41:03] the King how that went and his first
[41:06] initial uh journey to Jerusalem and how
[41:08] all that
[41:10] went okay so let's go to
[41:15] Nehemiah 1:1 I'm going to have all the
[41:18] scriptures up here it's up to you if you
[41:19] want to follow along I'm probably going
[41:21] to be moving pretty quickly if you want
[41:23] to you can so verse 11 so this is the
[41:25] very last verse in chapter one where
[41:29] Nehemiah is finishing up his prayer to
[41:32] the Lord and just to kind of get us back
[41:34] on the same page oh Lord I beseech thee
[41:38] let now thine ear be attentive to the
[41:40] prayer of thy servant and to the prayer
[41:41] of thy servants who desire to fear thy
[41:43] name and prosper I pray thee thy servant
[41:46] this day and Grant him Mercy in the
[41:48] sight of this man for I was the king's
[41:51] bear cup Bearer okay so a king's cup
[41:54] Bearer during the ancient times is is
[41:57] one of the most critical roles in the
[41:58] king's court okay cuz the king's court
[42:01] had multiple positions you had the the
[42:04] the advisers The Magicians the
[42:06] astrologers but the king's cup bearer
[42:09] was someone who had access to the king
[42:12] constantly okay he was there for every
[42:15] single meal of the king which meant that
[42:17] he had unprecedented access to the most
[42:19] powerful person in the Kingdom at the
[42:21] time okay and the role of the cup bearer
[42:24] was that he had to bring
[42:27] food and drink to the king and he had to
[42:30] drink it and taste it himself and for
[42:32] the reason for that was to check if it
[42:34] was poison or not so this the the the
[42:37] the person that the king would have
[42:38] chosen for this role had to be someone
[42:41] that the king first of all trusted with
[42:43] his life okay meaning that the person
[42:46] that he chose had to be trustworthy he
[42:49] had to be vetted he had to be a man of
[42:51] character a man of integrity because due
[42:55] to his amount of access to the king
[42:57] if you a want to get rid of the king
[43:00] who's who better than the cup
[43:02] bear if you want to get the ear of the
[43:04] king who better than the cup bear who's
[43:07] there three times a day so this role was
[43:09] a very coveted role it was a very uh
[43:12] valued role it was you know it was a
[43:16] very prestigious role okay so by
[43:18] Nehemiah being in that role in the first
[43:20] place especially as a Jew at that time
[43:23] was
[43:24] unprecedented okay but we see throughout
[43:27] this time in history God raises his sons
[43:31] of God into unprecedented positions you
[43:35] see it with Daniel you see it with the
[43:36] three Hebrew children for whatever
[43:38] reason God wanted these Godly men in
[43:42] these prestigious positions okay and at
[43:46] that point is probably just to show
[43:47] forth his glory through through those
[43:49] men especially with Daniel the what a
[43:51] witness Daniel had on that
[43:54] Kingdom so the key here is
[43:58] that
[44:00] Nehemiah due to his access could very
[44:04] easily just go straight to the king and
[44:06] say this is what I
[44:08] need you know the state of of Israel
[44:12] Israel is one of your provinces it's not
[44:14] a good place you know if if things keep
[44:16] on going people could Rebel he could use
[44:19] all this all this logic and all this
[44:21] this politicking to get what he wants he
[44:25] has the full right to he has the ear of
[44:27] the king the king trusts him the king
[44:29] likes him but he doesn't do that okay
[44:32] because ultimately according to the
[44:35] scripture here the king's heart is in
[44:36] the hand of the Lord as the rivers of
[44:38] water he turneth it withersoever he will
[44:42] because Christians don't
[44:47] politic Christians
[44:49] trust Christians
[44:51] wait and they're willing to go
[44:55] through some
[44:57] suffering of waiting in order for the
[45:01] right
[45:02] time okay because God is a god of
[45:05] timing we we see throughout scripture
[45:08] and I've taught it in Sunday school many
[45:09] times that if you're not willing to wait
[45:12] any anything that you do during that
[45:15] time that is outside of the timing of of
[45:17] of God is fully on your own
[45:20] head you look at Abraham and ishmail
[45:22] Abraham has been given a pro promise of
[45:24] his son there's a time of waiting okay
[45:28] and Sarah is looking at her own body
[45:31] thinking there's no way the promise can
[45:33] come through me and she works on her
[45:36] husband saying there's no way that it
[45:38] can to happen through me Abraham listens
[45:40] and they created an ishmail and that
[45:43] problem has continued down to this day
[45:47] because they didn't allow their faith to
[45:51] cover the
[45:53] circumstances because they weren't
[45:54] willing to wait they created a whole
[45:56] mess was there Grace of course there's
[45:59] Grace but it's better just to wait on
[46:03] the Lord's timing because you're save
[46:05] yourself a lot of scars you save
[46:07] yourself a lot of
[46:12] hurt so again by him not taking
[46:16] advantage of his position we see another
[46:18] sign of his maturity and his Integrity
[46:20] this a man that knows God opens the
[46:23] doors I don't kick down
[46:25] doors I have full right right I'm I'm
[46:27] I'm a Jew I'm a son of Abraham I am an
[46:30] administrator I am I'm in a position of
[46:32] great influence and I could change the
[46:34] situation but anything we do in our own
[46:37] flesh by our own will is going to turn
[46:39] to dust and it's going to end
[46:42] badly okay so we come then to chapter 2
[46:47] and just beginning of verse one it says
[46:50] it came to pass in the month Nissan in
[46:52] the 20th year of AR ex xeres the king
[46:55] that wine was before him and I took up
[46:57] the wine and gave it unto the king so
[47:00] just going to pause here for a second so
[47:02] the Jewish calendar has different names
[47:04] obviously we go by the the Greco Roman
[47:06] one and the month of
[47:09] Nissan is equivalent to march today
[47:13] right previously at the beginning of
[47:17] chapter 1 it says that Nehemiah hears
[47:20] about the state of jerus in the month
[47:21] chisu which is present day November okay
[47:25] so he hears it in November
[47:27] and nothing happens until March which is
[47:30] a five-month gap so for five months he
[47:34] gets this burden but he doesn't move
[47:35] right away for five months he sits he
[47:39] waits and he
[47:41] prays despite having access to the king
[47:44] three times a day day in day
[47:48] out okay and why is that God has perfect
[47:53] timing Nehemiah knows not to move until
[47:57] God says
[47:59] go and that's character character has
[48:02] has the strength to be able to withstand
[48:05] the pressure of
[48:08] waiting and within that there's a
[48:10] faithfulness that we see in Nehemiah and
[48:13] brother BR has a great quote here that
[48:15] talks about faithfulness and patience
[48:17] being hand in hand now faithfulness and
[48:20] patience go together in fact patience is
[48:22] the outcome of faithfulness for it says
[48:24] in James 1:3 the trying of your faith
[48:27] worketh patience there's absolutely no
[48:29] other way in which to gain patience it
[48:31] has to come by the trial of your faith
[48:32] Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience
[48:35] how Godly how highly God regards his
[48:38] outworking of our patience is seen in
[48:40] James 1:4 but let patience have a
[48:43] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[48:45] entire lacking nothing God's will for us
[48:48] is perfection and that Perfection is
[48:50] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[48:53] God this is the process of character
[48:55] development
[48:57] and patience is a virtue patience
[49:00] requires
[49:01] strength because you see it like whether
[49:04] or not you make a request and it just
[49:06] sounds like there's nothing God's not
[49:08] answering God's not moving it's
[49:12] frustrating but what God is teaching us
[49:15] is that if we're willing to wait he will
[49:19] reward us according to our hearts the
[49:21] desires of our hearts but if we move
[49:23] ahead of him it's going to be trouble
[49:28] okay so we go to uh the next verse here
[49:33] so it came to pass in the month Nan in
[49:35] the 20th year of art exes the king that
[49:37] wine was before him and I took up the
[49:40] wine and gave it unto the king now I had
[49:43] not been Before Time sad in his presence
[49:45] wherefore the king said unto unto me why
[49:47] is thy countenance sad seeing thou are
[49:49] not sick this is nothing else but sour
[49:52] of heart then I was very sore afraid and
[49:55] said unto the king let the King live
[49:57] forever why should not my countenance be
[49:59] said when the city the place of my
[50:01] father's supplers lith waste and the
[50:04] gates thereof are consumed with fire
[50:06] then the king said unto me for what Dost
[50:08] thou make request so I pray to the god
[50:10] of heaven so first of all
[50:13] here he
[50:15] waits for the opportunity to open to
[50:18] him okay he's not bringing this to the
[50:22] king he's letting it come to him he's
[50:25] waiting for the perfect time when the
[50:27] king does make the request you see here
[50:28] he's saying so I pray to the god of
[50:30] Heaven which is an instantaneous prayer
[50:33] because the next verse is literally
[50:35] saying he gives what he um essentially
[50:39] tells the king what what he's wanting so
[50:41] in that moment despite having praying
[50:44] through that five-month
[50:45] period and that five-month period he's
[50:48] praying not only is he praying he's
[50:49] praying
[50:50] through okay and there's a difference
[50:53] between praying about something and
[50:54] praying through about something
[50:57] praying is
[50:58] simply you pray about it and then you
[51:00] move on praying through is when you're
[51:03] so serious about something that you're
[51:07] you're not wanting at all to be outside
[51:10] of the will of God and what happens when
[51:13] you pray through is
[51:15] that you get away from your own desire
[51:19] you get neutral and that's key to
[51:22] finding the will of God is that you have
[51:24] to be neutral you have to be willing to
[51:26] hear the the word no okay and that's the
[51:29] problem when people just pray about
[51:31] something and then they move they're not
[51:33] wanting to hear the honest truth about
[51:35] what is actually good for them and if
[51:38] it's going to bless them but if you're
[51:40] willing to pray through you're leaving
[51:43] behind any selfishness any desires that
[51:46] you may want because at the at the end
[51:48] of the day what is best for us is God's
[51:51] perfect will not his permissive will and
[51:55] if we're willing to go through work cuz
[51:57] it is work you have to pray through any
[52:00] any major decision even minor decisions
[52:02] we ought to be praying through about
[52:05] it and willing to sit there and wait for
[52:07] the
[52:09] answer and there's times where it comes
[52:11] quick and there's times where it comes
[52:14] slow because what ultimately what God is
[52:16] developing in you is the ability to to
[52:22] sit there despite silence despite not
[52:24] feeling his presence despite not
[52:27] feeling the blessings of God for you
[52:28] just to sit there and to pray and to
[52:30] pray and to pray and to pray and to pray
[52:33] until you finally get an answer because
[52:36] it's it's kind of like when when um you
[52:39] know you're you're in a ship stormy seas
[52:42] and there's no hope and you throw the
[52:44] anchor over the side that Anchor It
[52:47] Takes Time For That anchor a to hit the
[52:49] hit the the the seabed but then it will
[52:52] drag along the
[52:54] floor if it's sand until it hits
[52:57] something that strikes it and once it
[53:00] strikes the Bedrock then that anchor
[53:03] grips and
[53:04] holds and during that entire time of
[53:07] that anchor going down those Sailors are
[53:09] just waiting and waiting for that anchor
[53:11] to hit something strong their only hope
[53:14] is in that anchor hitting something
[53:16] strong so when that anchor finally hits
[53:19] that rope or or the chain goes tot and
[53:22] that doesn't matter what happens above
[53:24] no matter how high the winds go
[53:27] that boat is going nowhere because it's
[53:30] relying on something stronger than
[53:31] itself that it can't see despite what's
[53:35] going on and that's the key to prayer is
[53:38] that when you toss your prayer to God it
[53:41] may take time it may take time and it's
[53:44] dragging along the seabed it feels like
[53:46] nothing's happening but if you stay with
[53:48] it if you stay with it and pray and pray
[53:51] and pray and pray through finally you
[53:54] get the answer and it's unbre breakable
[53:57] it's unmovable no matter what happens to
[53:59] you no matter what people say to you
[54:02] it's not going to shake
[54:04] you and that's what praying through is
[54:07] is getting past
[54:09] yourself it's getting past yourself and
[54:12] taing into that eternal life that's
[54:14] inside of you without anything
[54:17] interfering without any noise without
[54:20] any
[54:24] distractions and I've I've had my own
[54:26] life where it's just if if you don't do
[54:28] that there's
[54:30] uncertainty and you just you're always
[54:34] questioning whether or not you're
[54:34] supposed to be
[54:36] there so there there's a rest and
[54:38] there's an assurance that comes from
[54:41] praying
[54:42] through you know it's it's that song
[54:45] what what needless sorrow what needless
[54:47] pain we Bear all because we do
[54:49] not give it to God In
[54:52] Prayer it's needless
[54:57] you know what the problem is the problem
[55:00] is is that there's a constant pressure
[55:02] to move on to the next
[55:04] thing there's always something to do
[55:07] there's always something that comes up I
[55:10] I was doing my devotions the other day
[55:13] and um I hate it when I sleep in because
[55:15] you got to you know get your devotions
[55:18] in and you got all these notifications
[55:21] coming at you and I was doing my
[55:22] devotions and I have I left my my laptop
[55:25] open and my phone on and it was 15 dings
[55:29] in a matter of 45 seconds it's likeing
[55:33] and if you're trying to read your Bible
[55:35] or pray it's it's mind-numbing and all
[55:38] those things are just pulling you every
[55:40] time to check
[55:42] it and that's the way that the devil has
[55:44] designed the world today is that it's
[55:46] it's
[55:47] constantly pulling at you trying to
[55:49] shift your attent your attention away
[55:51] from him to something
[55:53] trivial cuz at the end of the day if you
[55:55] don't answer your phone
[55:57] if a client is is is calling is it the
[56:00] end of the world
[56:01] no is is this super urgent thing super
[56:05] urgent at the at the end of the day no
[56:07] if God wants you to pray pray for a bit
[56:09] you know you don't need to pray for
[56:10] eight hours but give God his time and
[56:14] he'll take care of you seek ye first the
[56:17] kingdom of God and all these things
[56:19] shall be added unto
[56:21] you so it's just it's imperative it's
[56:24] imperative that like you learn
[56:28] how to follow his leading but it
[56:30] requires your spirit getting
[56:32] quiet because it's it's like in Isaiah
[56:34] he talks about in quietness and in in uh
[56:37] in quietness and in confidence shall be
[56:39] your
[56:40] strength so getting your spirit
[56:43] quiet especially in this age because
[56:45] everything's spinning so fast you have
[56:47] so much technology you have so so many
[56:49] things pulling at you that your spirit
[56:51] can't handle brother BR literally says
[56:53] it the lateran age has so much
[56:55] technology and is evolving so quickly
[56:57] that the human Spirit literally cannot
[56:59] handle it that's why you see much
[57:00] anxiety and and Neurosis depression and
[57:03] all these things brother and said it
[57:05] it's because of
[57:07] technology
[57:09] so that's why it's our job to put these
[57:12] things have to be in their place in
[57:14] order for us to be in our place to keep
[57:17] our focus and attention on him because
[57:19] if we do that then his voice is clear
[57:23] his voice is strong everything has faded
[57:26] away you're in the inner
[57:29] Veil then he can lead you he can
[57:32] position you he can bless you there
[57:34] there there there's nothing getting in
[57:36] the way so that's that's the fight the
[57:37] constant fight God help
[57:41] us
[57:43] okay
[57:45] so in terms of this instant prayer that
[57:48] he does you know I'm I'm a planner I'm
[57:51] an
[57:52] organizer and I love having time for
[57:58] things but you don't always get
[58:00] that and if there's times where God Will
[58:03] Spring major decisions upon you that
[58:05] require instant decisions and that's why
[58:08] it's critical to be prayed up in those
[58:11] moments so that you're not in those
[58:13] moments you're not confessing everything
[58:14] that you've done repenting of everything
[58:16] get everything clear and then you can
[58:18] pray you don't see this here there's an
[58:21] King ask he prays good to go okay
[58:27] so he does an instant prayer okay and
[58:29] when you look up the instant inseason
[58:31] and out of
[58:33] season in the Amplified it says be ready
[58:36] when the time is right and even when is
[58:38] not keep your sense of urgency whether
[58:41] the opportunity seems favorable or
[58:42] unfavorable whether convenient or
[58:44] inconvenient whether welcome or
[58:47] unwelcome okay and what this means is
[58:51] that you can't the Bible talks about the
[58:55] the the man who Waits for favorable
[58:56] weather will never ever have a
[58:59] harvest if you're constantly waiting for
[59:02] everything to be perfect around you
[59:04] you'll never do
[59:06] anything because you're relying then on
[59:11] your conditions to be perfect all the
[59:12] time for you for a for you to be happy
[59:14] and content and all these things no that
[59:16] our contentment is not in that we're
[59:17] content despite the
[59:20] circumstances yeah me and Joe were just
[59:22] talking about today where it's just Paul
[59:25] had to learn
[59:26] to be content despite his circumstances
[59:30] the the the the prophet of first first
[59:32] age had to learn that he didn't have it
[59:34] just by getting the holy ghost or by
[59:36] being the preeminent man of his
[59:40] age so we have to be in a place where
[59:44] When God says go go if it's not
[59:48] perfect fine you know this here is a
[59:53] perfect example of me buying the house I
[59:55] want I had all these plans I had
[59:58] literally rows and rows and rows of
[1:00:01] calculations of interest rates and uh
[1:00:05] you know The Upfront deposit that you
[1:00:07] needed it was just rows and rows and
[1:00:10] rows Kim hated it because I I I
[1:00:12] literally talked to her one day for six
[1:00:14] hours straight about finances and she
[1:00:17] was
[1:00:18] exhausted she did not after that anytime
[1:00:20] I mentioned finances she's like I don't
[1:00:22] want to hear it I I literally can't
[1:00:23] handle
[1:00:24] it so we
[1:00:28] go we go to the
[1:00:31] states Michael gets Co we get we have to
[1:00:34] rush him to the hospital two nights in a
[1:00:36] row that was a
[1:00:38] $2,000 God Bless
[1:00:40] America hospital bill okay we made a
[1:00:45] decision to go down states to uh Kim's
[1:00:48] grandmother's uh yeah Kim's
[1:00:49] grandmother's uh
[1:00:51] funeral and then after Michael gets uh
[1:00:55] goes to the hospital time we're like I I
[1:00:57] felt you need to get back home so that's
[1:01:00] more
[1:01:01] money so I'm I'm I I literally remember
[1:01:04] to this day I was in the bathroom
[1:01:05] downstairs in my mother-in-law's house
[1:01:08] in the bathroom with my head my my hands
[1:01:10] were in my head and I was just like so
[1:01:13] much for the
[1:01:14] house so much for the house just money
[1:01:17] gone and I and it distinctly
[1:01:21] remember there's a voice just dropped
[1:01:23] down said you need to learn to trust me
[1:01:26] me with your
[1:01:28] finances I was
[1:01:30] like fine because for me it's just I I I
[1:01:34] love budgeting I love having my little
[1:01:36] pockets of savings that I can pull from
[1:01:39] and it's nice and safe and secure it's
[1:01:41] nice little cocoon that I can Retreat to
[1:01:44] and be safe without any fear but God was
[1:01:47] saying nope you rely on that way too
[1:01:50] much take out the
[1:01:52] feathers on the way home so the first
[1:01:55] thing was God provided every bit of
[1:01:57] money for the return ticket coming home
[1:02:00] completely down to the down to the scent
[1:02:02] totally covered other PE like people
[1:02:05] just started sending money out of
[1:02:07] nowhere I didn't ask for it just came
[1:02:09] just came on the way home I check VM
[1:02:14] when we
[1:02:15] land that's when uh the government was
[1:02:18] giving out the
[1:02:19] $500 price of living checks I like oh
[1:02:24] that's nice cuz 500 for me 500 Kim okay
[1:02:27] great and then literally we land within
[1:02:31] probably 5 to 10 days we found the house
[1:02:35] had just enough money for the down
[1:02:38] payment had uh everything we needed for
[1:02:42] the lawyers fees everything I needed to
[1:02:43] get a new wood stove everything down to
[1:02:46] the dime I had just enough despite all
[1:02:48] this money gone God provided down to the
[1:02:51] scent and ever since then he's required
[1:02:53] me to trust me with his finances with my
[1:02:57] it's not my
[1:02:59] money it's not my
[1:03:01] money and I've had to learn it and cuz
[1:03:03] you know it's just I try to take after
[1:03:05] dead be financially astute and be a good
[1:03:08] Steward
[1:03:09] and but when God wants it to teach you a
[1:03:13] lesson you're fighting the air if you're
[1:03:16] just trying to just go all these
[1:03:19] different ways of getting security but
[1:03:22] our security is within the word and it's
[1:03:24] within him
[1:03:26] and it's no different
[1:03:29] than say me and Kim like I I if I want
[1:03:32] Kim to trust me I want to Kim to trust
[1:03:34] my decisions for her I want her to to
[1:03:37] know that I will provide for her when
[1:03:39] she needs it I may say no sometimes but
[1:03:42] when I do say no it's for a good reason
[1:03:44] I want her to trust me and God wants to
[1:03:47] trust God wants us to trust him to trust
[1:03:51] us with our desires for our wishes for
[1:03:55] our need needs no matter what it is he
[1:03:57] wants us to trust
[1:04:00] him and eventually it's like a snowball
[1:04:03] when you start trusting him with the
[1:04:05] small things then you start trusting him
[1:04:08] for the bigger things and that's how you
[1:04:10] get go to the Rapture it's a day-by-day
[1:04:12] process of line upon line and learning
[1:04:14] to trust
[1:04:16] him that's it it isn't this
[1:04:19] big I got to pray and pray and pray no
[1:04:23] it's it's it's daily walking with thee
[1:04:28] all
[1:04:30] right moving
[1:04:33] on so this is NE responding to the King
[1:04:37] after praying in that moment and I said
[1:04:40] unto the king if it be if it pleased the
[1:04:42] king and If thy servant have found favor
[1:04:44] in thy sight that thou would send me
[1:04:45] unto Judah unto the city of my father
[1:04:47] sepers that I may build it and the King
[1:04:49] said unto me the que Queen also sitting
[1:04:51] by him for how long shall thy journey be
[1:04:54] and when will thou return so it pleased
[1:04:56] the king to send me and I set him a time
[1:04:59] moreover I said unto the king if it
[1:05:00] pleased the king let letters be given to
[1:05:03] uh given me to the governors beyond the
[1:05:05] river that they may convey me over till
[1:05:07] I come over into
[1:05:09] Judah and a letter unto ASAP The Keeper
[1:05:12] of the king's Forest that he may give me
[1:05:14] Timber to make beams for the gates of
[1:05:15] the palace which app pertain to the
[1:05:17] house and for the wall of city and for
[1:05:19] the house that I shall enter into and
[1:05:21] the King granted me according to the
[1:05:22] good hand my God upon me
[1:05:29] so at this point this five months
[1:05:32] praying God gives neiah desire of his
[1:05:35] heart but the key thing that he is
[1:05:39] Nehemiah is his
[1:05:41] authority Nehemiah now has the Persian
[1:05:44] King's Authority the Persian Empire at
[1:05:47] this
[1:05:48] time are the main Empire of the world
[1:05:51] they defeated Babylon they are the they
[1:05:54] are the great Kings okay
[1:05:57] so because he has the authority now and
[1:05:59] he has a seal on those papers those
[1:06:01] letters any person that he shows that
[1:06:03] seal to has to obey it if they don't
[1:06:06] obey it
[1:06:08] they are open or really they're at risk
[1:06:14] of the Wrath of the King of Persia so
[1:06:17] the full weight of the Persian Empire is
[1:06:19] now behind Nehemiah the full weight
[1:06:22] anyone who disobeys in Nehemiah is
[1:06:24] disobeying Persia
[1:06:30] so this uh quote he says in 64
[1:06:32] scriptural signs of the time say for
[1:06:34] instance a policeman standing out in the
[1:06:36] street he weighs 110 lbs and here comes
[1:06:39] a whole row of traffic at 80 M an hour
[1:06:41] 300 horsepower engines in them and
[1:06:43] they're buzzing down the street 300
[1:06:45] horsepower engines why that little
[1:06:47] fellow doesn't have power to stop one of
[1:06:48] them but just let that bad shine and
[1:06:50] raise up his hand listen at The Brak
[1:06:52] squeak watch them slide sideways it is
[1:06:54] in his power the stops him it his
[1:06:56] authority and the church has an
[1:06:58] authority from Jesus Christ in my name
[1:07:00] they shall cast out Devils speak with
[1:07:02] new tongues if they take up
[1:07:04] servants or drink deadly things it'll
[1:07:07] not harm them if they lay their hands on
[1:07:09] the sick they shall recover that's his
[1:07:11] given Authority now why if the same
[1:07:13] little policeman is afraid to raise his
[1:07:15] hand and step out in that traffic he
[1:07:16] better take off the uniform present the
[1:07:18] badge back because he'll never make a
[1:07:20] policeman neither will he ever make a
[1:07:22] Believer as long as we're afraid to
[1:07:24] exercise the authority
[1:07:26] that's been given us by Jesus Christ we
[1:07:27] have Victory we don't have to fight for
[1:07:30] victory we already have Victory he
[1:07:32] conquered for us not us he conquered for
[1:07:35] us we're not the mighty conqueror he is
[1:07:37] the mighty
[1:07:39] conqueror and this is key to us because
[1:07:43] he's saying that man in himself he's 110
[1:07:46] pounds does not have the power to stop
[1:07:49] those
[1:07:51] cars it's the badge the badge it has the
[1:07:56] power to stop those cars so he's not has
[1:07:59] the power within himself to do that the
[1:08:02] badge has the
[1:08:04] power behind any Authority is the power
[1:08:08] and when we're given the Holy Ghost
[1:08:10] we're presented with a token and that
[1:08:12] token is the authority that says all
[1:08:14] Heaven and Earth belongs to God which
[1:08:19] means that you have to listen to him so
[1:08:22] when we present that token it's saying
[1:08:24] all of Heaven is behind this token you
[1:08:27] cannot stand up to it you do not have
[1:08:29] the power within yourself but God has
[1:08:31] the power and when you present that
[1:08:33] token it's showing Authority and that
[1:08:36] power is behind that
[1:08:37] Authority
[1:08:39] okay but the key thing is is that you
[1:08:41] have to show it you have to present your
[1:08:43] token when you go to prayer to God you
[1:08:46] have to present your token to God saying
[1:08:48] this is the purchase price of your
[1:08:51] blood you said in your word that buy buy
[1:08:55] your Stripes I am healed if you present
[1:08:57] that he has to honor
[1:08:58] that then it's a matter of
[1:09:01] time it's not always an immediate yes it
[1:09:04] could be a maybe it could be a matter of
[1:09:06] time but our job is to present it you
[1:09:09] have to hold it out you have to present
[1:09:11] it to the situation in order for God to
[1:09:14] move on it that's the key thing that
[1:09:16] he's saying there if he doesn't have the
[1:09:18] courage to step
[1:09:19] out then he is no good to him but you
[1:09:22] have to step out you have to move out
[1:09:24] into the situation
[1:09:25] in order for God to start
[1:09:27] moving but Authority is a is a tricky
[1:09:30] thing
[1:09:32] because it has to be in the right
[1:09:36] Channel and you look in scripture and
[1:09:39] and you see that
[1:09:43] uh a person that is fit to
[1:09:45] rule is always given Authority they
[1:09:49] never take
[1:09:51] it okay and what's key there is that
[1:09:55] Authority always comes from a higher
[1:09:57] authority you look at uh
[1:10:00] Aaron Aaron is made high priest by who
[1:10:03] Moses who is the word Prophet for that
[1:10:07] time Aaron is not taking the authority
[1:10:10] he's being given it by Moses to be the
[1:10:14] high priest you look at Joshua Joshua is
[1:10:17] given Authority by
[1:10:19] Moses to be the next leader he doesn't
[1:10:22] take it you look at Gideon gide Gideon
[1:10:26] was commissioned by the angel Gideon
[1:10:28] doesn't take it it's a higher authority
[1:10:30] coming to Gideon David was given
[1:10:34] Authority by Samuel when he was
[1:10:37] anointed okay always a higher authority
[1:10:40] giving
[1:10:41] Authority okay key thing about authority
[1:10:45] authority is always under another
[1:10:48] Authority there's no person on their
[1:10:52] own that they're their own
[1:10:56] entity there's only one
[1:10:59] person who's not under any Authority
[1:11:02] that's
[1:11:04] God the other person who tried to get
[1:11:08] out and not have any uh to be their own
[1:11:10] authority was the devil I
[1:11:13] will I will Ascend as the most high I
[1:11:16] will be as stars of the heavens
[1:11:19] Etc so when anyone takes
[1:11:22] Authority it's always an antichrist
[1:11:24] spirit because it it it started in
[1:11:27] heaven Satan not being content in his
[1:11:30] position in heaven was cast out because
[1:11:33] of Pride and because he tried to take
[1:11:35] authority and that carries on down you
[1:11:38] look at absum absum tries to take
[1:11:41] authority from his father the king in
[1:11:43] order to be the king you look at Jezebel
[1:11:46] Jezebel takes Authority away from the
[1:11:48] priesthood and from the prophets to be
[1:11:51] the Priestess the prophetess of Baal
[1:11:54] okay so all of these situations where
[1:11:58] the person is taking
[1:12:00] Authority the mo of is always wrong
[1:12:04] they're not willing to
[1:12:05] wait they think they can do a better job
[1:12:08] than the person who's doing it their
[1:12:11] heart
[1:12:12] is um really puffed up with pride
[1:12:15] because you saw it with with the devil
[1:12:17] he was puffed up with pride wanted to do
[1:12:19] it himself okay so it always the motive
[1:12:22] is always wrong and then the fruits of
[1:12:24] it are wrong and always ends in death
[1:12:27] you look at absum ends in death look at
[1:12:29] Jezebel ends in death you look at the
[1:12:31] Devil ends in death the
[1:12:34] death he gets cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:12:38] so when someone takes
[1:12:41] Authority it shows they have an
[1:12:44] antichrist
[1:12:45] spirit because God's people are always
[1:12:48] willing to wait they're always willing
[1:12:51] to be
[1:12:52] ready to be given Authority because the
[1:12:55] key to Authority is that you have to be
[1:12:57] ready to handle it God cannot give
[1:13:00] authority to someone who cannot handle
[1:13:02] it otherwise you'll destroy with it and
[1:13:06] that's always the principle you have to
[1:13:09] wait if you're not willing to wait
[1:13:11] you'll hurt people and in that process
[1:13:14] of waiting you develop the character and
[1:13:17] the
[1:13:18] ability to handle that Authority and
[1:13:21] it's always a process of time anything
[1:13:23] that's given quickly is never
[1:13:26] appreciated but
[1:13:28] secondly there there there's no
[1:13:31] appreciation for the authority and what
[1:13:33] that Authority could
[1:13:35] do that's why uh David is such a a
[1:13:39] blessed character in The Bible because
[1:13:42] he no matter how many times he has the
[1:13:44] opportunity to kill Saul he doesn't do
[1:13:46] it because if his kingdom begins in
[1:13:49] blood it ends in
[1:13:51] blood but he also knows that God
[1:13:54] anointed him for a purpose and for a
[1:13:56] time and when that time was up he would
[1:13:59] be ready to
[1:14:00] rule so the the the the the principle is
[1:14:03] that you have to wait and it can even
[1:14:05] come down to relatively minor things or
[1:14:08] uh in this case not minor but you look
[1:14:10] at Saul Saul was in a situation he's
[1:14:13] told by the prophet to wait until I come
[1:14:16] it's seven days and it looks like Samuel
[1:14:19] is late
[1:14:20] Saul
[1:14:22] panics and takes the position of a
[1:14:24] priest and
[1:14:26] offers the sacrifice and what that
[1:14:29] happen and when that happens Samuel
[1:14:31] immediately shows
[1:14:33] up and God has to take away that
[1:14:37] Authority why because Saul stepped from
[1:14:40] his position and Authority as a king
[1:14:42] into the position and authority of a
[1:14:44] priest which are two very different
[1:14:46] things a because God had a bloodline
[1:14:50] that require that that was that wase
[1:14:52] predetermined by God to handle the word
[1:14:55] for that time and what Saul was doing
[1:14:57] was that he was taking Authority in a
[1:15:00] position that wasn't his and God
[1:15:02] immediately takes the kingdom away from
[1:15:04] him
[1:15:05] immediately because God doesn't play
[1:15:08] around does not play around and it was
[1:15:10] the first time once he took that
[1:15:12] Authority for the first time done
[1:15:15] because God if if if Saul did it the
[1:15:18] first time he would do it a second
[1:15:20] time and that that's how Saul was it
[1:15:22] would would have continued and same
[1:15:24] thing for us no matter how small it is
[1:15:28] you have to wait for the predetermined
[1:15:30] time that God has appointed for you to
[1:15:33] take that
[1:15:34] position only then will God be able to
[1:15:36] bless it because it has to come from him
[1:15:38] to you if you take it for yourself
[1:15:41] thinking that I can do a better job than
[1:15:43] him or her or whatever it may be it's
[1:15:47] going to begin badly and it will end
[1:15:49] badly the fruit of it is always death
[1:15:58] so Nehemiah has been given the king's
[1:16:00] Authority the full weight of the Persian
[1:16:02] kingdoms behind him so we're going to
[1:16:05] look now at where Nehemiah is in
[1:16:07] scripture because Nehemiah is not just
[1:16:09] mentioned in Nehemiah he's mentioned in
[1:16:13] Daniel so if you go to um Daniel 9 verse
[1:16:19] 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[1:16:21] people and upon the holy city to finish
[1:16:23] transgression and to make an an end of
[1:16:25] sins and to make reconciliation for
[1:16:26] iniquity and to bring in Everlasting
[1:16:28] righteousness and to seal up div vision
[1:16:30] and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[1:16:33] know therefore and understand that from
[1:16:34] the going forth of the Commandment to
[1:16:36] restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
[1:16:38] Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks
[1:16:40] and three score in two weeks the street
[1:16:42] shall be built again and the wall even
[1:16:44] in Troublesome times
[1:16:46] okay that last line is nemiah and
[1:16:49] brother Bram confirms this in two places
[1:16:52] Nehemiah went and got an order from the
[1:16:53] King and built the wall and some time
[1:16:56] the walls and it will be built in
[1:16:57] Troublesome times and many of us
[1:16:59] remember when it was built they had a
[1:17:00] mortar Block in one hand and a sword in
[1:17:02] the other to watch the enemy and it will
[1:17:04] be built in Troublesome
[1:17:05] times so over a 100 years before
[1:17:08] Nehemiah has been sent on a mission to
[1:17:11] Jerusalem he has been prophesied in
[1:17:12] scripture to do that okay so he is now
[1:17:16] living within the vision he is living
[1:17:18] within prophecy he has a place in
[1:17:20] scripture he has the full weight of the
[1:17:22] Persian Empire behind him he has the
[1:17:24] favor God and he has a burden for the
[1:17:26] situation and he has been prepared for
[1:17:28] this role through the many years that
[1:17:29] he's been serving the king Faithfully
[1:17:31] without complaint without
[1:17:34] anything
[1:17:36] so this man has been specially picked by
[1:17:39] God to do the work that he has been
[1:17:42] given so not only does he have the full
[1:17:44] weight of the Persian Kingdom Beyond him
[1:17:46] he now has the full weight of the
[1:17:47] Heavenly Kingdom behind him so any
[1:17:49] person who comes up against him is
[1:17:51] coming up against almighty God
[1:17:55] so once that move of God begins rolling
[1:17:59] because this was prophesied 100 years
[1:18:00] before and God knew that there was going
[1:18:02] to be appointed time of waiting before
[1:18:05] this would be manifested and during that
[1:18:07] time especially after the the the temple
[1:18:10] was built it just the work just stopped
[1:18:13] and the people suffered and they groaned
[1:18:15] and they suffered and they groaned but
[1:18:17] they didn't know that God during that
[1:18:19] time was preparing a
[1:18:21] man God was answering their prayers
[1:18:24] behind the scenes without them knowing
[1:18:26] it and that's why you have to be patient
[1:18:29] within your trial because God does not
[1:18:32] work by sight he works by faith and if
[1:18:35] we have the faith to be able to see the
[1:18:39] Unseen you will have the strength to be
[1:18:41] able to endure until your faith becomes
[1:18:45] sight if we walk by sight it wouldn't be
[1:18:47] faith and faith is
[1:18:49] hard faith is hard for the flesh the
[1:18:52] flesh wants it easy the flesh wants it
[1:18:54] now
[1:18:55] but God is training his people not only
[1:18:58] to be a blessing here but to rule over
[1:19:00] there and that's why we have to go
[1:19:02] through all these
[1:19:04] sufferings so once that move of God
[1:19:06] begins rolling nothing can stop it all
[1:19:09] of Heaven is now behind Nehemiah and
[1:19:12] Satan was going to rise up against
[1:19:13] Nehemiah Time After Time After Time and
[1:19:16] we're going to start talking about the
[1:19:18] The Men Who came up against him and
[1:19:21] they're a great example of how the devil
[1:19:23] works because the devil will try
[1:19:25] different tactics with you he's
[1:19:27] constantly trying to find a weakness or
[1:19:29] a port hole or a back door in which you
[1:19:31] are weak and that's why you got to be in
[1:19:34] your position because within your
[1:19:35] position is
[1:19:36] protection okay within that that
[1:19:40] position you have authority and that
[1:19:42] Authority has protection from above and
[1:19:45] without that you're on your own and
[1:19:47] you're going to suffer for
[1:19:49] it
[1:19:52] so God was going to keep raising that
[1:19:55] standard and to deliver Nehemiah so
[1:19:58] brother BR has this great quote here
[1:19:59] from 63 just once more just one more
[1:20:01] time lord yes when they tried to fence
[1:20:04] in the power of God they found out that
[1:20:05] they could not do it Sanson picked up
[1:20:08] those great big iron gates that would
[1:20:10] have weighed tons walked up on the hill
[1:20:12] with them and laid them down certainly
[1:20:14] nobody was going to take after him they
[1:20:15] know better and when a man comes in the
[1:20:17] anointing of the Holy Ghost and with the
[1:20:19] word of the Lord with thus sayith the
[1:20:20] Lord you better have better sense than
[1:20:22] try to attack it cuz you'll find the
[1:20:24] there's a hand of the Living God and
[1:20:25] it's
[1:20:27] heavy it's heavy and God was going to
[1:20:30] deliver Nehemiah from the many attacks
[1:20:33] of
[1:20:34] Satan in order for him to do the job
[1:20:37] that he needed to do
[1:20:39] here so in terms of those three men we
[1:20:43] see them here now in verse 9 then I came
[1:20:45] to the governors beyond the river and I
[1:20:46] gave them the king's letters now the
[1:20:48] king had sent captains of the army and
[1:20:50] Horsemen with me when selat the horonite
[1:20:52] and tobiah the servant the amonite heard
[1:20:54] of it agreeed them exceedingly that
[1:20:56] there was come a man to seek the welfare
[1:20:58] of the children of
[1:21:00] Israel so there's two men mentioned here
[1:21:03] there's a third man in the next few
[1:21:06] verses but he's only mentioned twice so
[1:21:08] these two selat and toaya are our two
[1:21:10] main
[1:21:13] villains and we see
[1:21:15] exactly what character they made of by
[1:21:17] their reaction here it griev them
[1:21:18] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[1:21:20] seek the welfare of the children of
[1:21:23] Israel so
[1:21:27] toaya is mentioned here as an amonite
[1:21:29] and amonite was the uh one of the
[1:21:31] descendants of the daughters of lot we
[1:21:33] all know how that began uh which the
[1:21:37] amonites were one of the the groups that
[1:21:39] God had driven from the promised land
[1:21:40] for the
[1:21:41] Israelites and he was a leader um he was
[1:21:45] a governor portion of Samaria there
[1:21:48] whereas
[1:21:50] selat he's called a horonite right so a
[1:21:53] horonite is someone from the city it's a
[1:21:57] city of Moab called
[1:22:00] horum okay and Moab was the other
[1:22:04] descendant of the other daughter of
[1:22:07] lot okay and same the those people came
[1:22:11] from the same uh
[1:22:13] product so he was a moabit who was a
[1:22:16] leader and he was a leader in Samaria
[1:22:18] and he was a leader of the Samaritans
[1:22:19] and we talk about the who the Samaritans
[1:22:21] were they were the mix of the northern
[1:22:24] tribes of Israel with the Assyrians and
[1:22:28] Etc so if we go to the next slide here
[1:22:31] selat is a perfect type of Satan and sin
[1:22:35] so the town that he's from it means
[1:22:38] anger the word selat in Assyrian means
[1:22:42] sin is
[1:22:43] quickened that same word in Babylonian
[1:22:47] means May sin give him life and finally
[1:22:51] in Hebrew it means Bramble Bush or enemy
[1:22:55] in
[1:22:58] secret let's go to the next one so our
[1:23:00] Bramble Bush a Bramble Bush right
[1:23:02] here is any rough Tangled prickly shrub
[1:23:06] especially Hardy plant Bramble bushes
[1:23:08] can also become a nu and garden sending
[1:23:10] down strong suckering roots amongst
[1:23:12] Hedges and shrubs and being particularly
[1:23:14] resilient against pruning many consider
[1:23:17] a weed to its tendency to grow neglected
[1:23:19] areas and it's sharp tough Thorns which
[1:23:22] can be
[1:23:23] hard hard
[1:23:25] hazardous sorry to children and
[1:23:29] pets so just put in
[1:23:33] sin and it all
[1:23:36] works it's a nuisance it sends down
[1:23:39] strong suckering roots it's particularly
[1:23:41] resilient against pruning it's
[1:23:44] considered a weed to its tendency to
[1:23:45] grow neglected areas and it has sharp
[1:23:48] tough thorns and it's hazardous to
[1:23:51] children and pets
[1:23:55] so a bramble bush is anyone who's fell
[1:23:57] into a raspberry bush that's a Bramble
[1:24:00] Bush it hurts and it pokes and it tears
[1:24:04] and it's not
[1:24:07] pleasant and they grow in the weirdest
[1:24:10] places and there's always a trap when
[1:24:12] you're raspberry picking you you step
[1:24:14] and it's 40 feet down despite there
[1:24:16] being a bush it's
[1:24:19] awful so
[1:24:23] sambat is a type of a Bramble Bush and
[1:24:26] you look at the the the Bramble Bush
[1:24:27] there on the right look
[1:24:30] how how big those Thorns
[1:24:34] are and that's what sin is sin's going
[1:24:37] to tear you apart it grows in neglected
[1:24:39] areas if you neglect areas of your life
[1:24:42] do not be surprised to see that and good
[1:24:44] luck clean it out it's going to it's
[1:24:46] going to take some pain it's G to have
[1:24:48] some cuts and you're going to be
[1:24:49] bleeding
[1:24:51] afterward it's going to be H sin
[1:24:53] neglected is going to be hazardous to
[1:24:55] your
[1:24:56] children it's going to send strong
[1:24:58] suckering roots to steal nutrients from
[1:25:01] what is valuable in your
[1:25:02] life it's especially hearty it's
[1:25:05] resilient to
[1:25:07] pruning sin is resilient it's strong and
[1:25:11] it requires you to be on top of
[1:25:14] it and how do you get ahead of it you
[1:25:17] got to apply the token you have to be a
[1:25:19] Watchman of your home you have to be a
[1:25:21] Watchman of your heart and a watch and
[1:25:23] man always says
[1:25:25] a Watchman looks out he looks around he
[1:25:30] looks behind him and he looks within
[1:25:34] him everywhere is accounted for there
[1:25:37] are no areas that an enemy can sneak
[1:25:43] in and that's the way that a Believer is
[1:25:45] supposed to be you're supposed to be
[1:25:46] constantly applying the token to every
[1:25:50] area of your life
[1:25:53] outside around you behind you in you
[1:25:56] everywhere it's like when they were
[1:25:58] spreading the blood
[1:26:00] don't don't put on sparely soak it soak
[1:26:04] the
[1:26:06] lentil and that's the way that God wants
[1:26:08] it in our lives apply the blood
[1:26:12] liberally because otherwise sin has an
[1:26:15] opportunity to grow and it starts off as
[1:26:17] a seed that grows into a choot that
[1:26:19] eventually ends up like this
[1:26:24] so s blat the Bible's very clearly
[1:26:28] saying this guy is not going to be a
[1:26:31] good time he doesn't have nehemiah's
[1:26:34] best interest in mind and you see here
[1:26:37] he just keeps on popping up in most
[1:26:40] random of places Nehemiah will kick him
[1:26:42] out and then you see later in scripture
[1:26:45] samad's son has married or Sam's
[1:26:48] daughter has married the high
[1:26:50] priest so Nehemiah comes in and is like
[1:26:53] get out he literally body and bones
[1:26:56] takes it wasn't selat it was the um it
[1:26:59] was
[1:26:59] toaya nemiah literally comes into the
[1:27:02] temple sees Tobi there and says take
[1:27:04] some body and bones and throws them out
[1:27:06] of the
[1:27:08] temple and I'm about to read why he does
[1:27:12] that so if we go to Deuteronomy 23 so
[1:27:16] Tob is the
[1:27:18] amonite and sand blat the
[1:27:21] Mite an amonite and or mite shall not
[1:27:24] enter into the congregation of the Lord
[1:27:26] even to their 10th Generation shall they
[1:27:28] not enter into the congregation of the
[1:27:29] Lord forever because they met you not
[1:27:31] with bread and with water in the way
[1:27:33] when you came forth out of Egypt and
[1:27:35] because they hired against thee balam
[1:27:37] the son of beor of pethor of mes
[1:27:39] Mesopotamia to curse thee nevertheless
[1:27:42] the Lord thy God would not hearken unto
[1:27:44] balam but the Lord thy God turned the
[1:27:46] curse into a blessing unto thee because
[1:27:48] the Lord thy God loved thee Thou shalt
[1:27:50] not seek their peace nor their
[1:27:53] prosperity all thy days
[1:27:58] forever that was how the Jews were
[1:28:00] supposed to treat amonites and
[1:28:03] moabites and you see now why Ruth had
[1:28:05] such a hard
[1:28:07] time it was not an easy decision that
[1:28:10] Ruth made because she was coming in as
[1:28:13] this and there was a reproach on that
[1:28:15] that's why it's such a beautiful story
[1:28:17] because it's just total restoration and
[1:28:20] God wipes it clean and puts her right
[1:28:22] into the lineage of Christ
[1:28:24] so
[1:28:26] Nehemiah as a Jew being trained in the
[1:28:31] law knows that an amonite and a moabite
[1:28:35] you do not seek their peace nor their
[1:28:36] prosperity all th days forever
[1:28:41] okay so we go to the next
[1:28:44] verse so I came to Jerusalem and was
[1:28:47] there three days and I arose in the
[1:28:49] night and I and some few men with me
[1:28:51] neither told I any man what my God have
[1:28:54] put on my heart to do a Jerusalem
[1:28:55] neither was there any Beast with me save
[1:28:57] the Beast that I rode upon and and I
[1:29:00] went out by Night by the gate of the
[1:29:01] valley even before the dragon well into
[1:29:03] the dung port and viewed the walls of
[1:29:05] Jerusalem which were broken down and the
[1:29:07] gates thereof were consumed with fire
[1:29:09] then I went onto the Gate of the
[1:29:10] fountain and onto the king's pool but
[1:29:13] there was no place for the Beast that
[1:29:15] was under me to pass then went I up into
[1:29:17] the night by the Brook and view the wall
[1:29:19] and turned back and entered by the gate
[1:29:21] of the valley and so returned and the
[1:29:23] rulers knew not whether I went or what I
[1:29:25] did neither had I as yet told it to the
[1:29:27] Jews nor to the priests nor to the
[1:29:29] Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest
[1:29:31] that did the work so what Nehemiah is
[1:29:33] essentially doing is that he arrived but
[1:29:35] then he wanted to see the situation for
[1:29:37] himself so he goes out by night and
[1:29:39] Views every single gate in every portion
[1:29:41] of the wall and seeing okay what is
[1:29:43] salvageable here what is really bad what
[1:29:46] requires the most amount of attention
[1:29:48] and as any good project manager would do
[1:29:51] he then is probably this just me talking
[1:29:54] he's probably triaging this and
[1:29:56] determining okay this needs the best
[1:29:58] people on this gate this gate is really
[1:30:01] bad so it's going to require the skill
[1:30:02] set and going down the line he is not
[1:30:05] just going off the word of his brother
[1:30:07] he's going and seeing it for
[1:30:09] himself because his job was to restore
[1:30:13] and he's going to be a good
[1:30:16] Steward so he reviews the condition of
[1:30:20] the city and then he goes to talk to the
[1:30:21] people cuz up until this point he has
[1:30:23] not said anything he's not given his
[1:30:25] purpose to
[1:30:26] them so verse 17 then said I unto them
[1:30:30] ye see the distress that we are in how
[1:30:32] Jerusalem lith waste and the gates
[1:30:34] thereof are burned with fire come and
[1:30:36] let us build up the house the wall of
[1:30:37] Jerusalem that we be no more reproach
[1:30:40] then I told them of the hand of my God
[1:30:42] which was good upon me as also the
[1:30:44] king's word that he has spoken unto me
[1:30:46] and they said let us rise up and build
[1:30:48] so they strengthen their hand for this
[1:30:51] good
[1:30:52] work so at this
[1:30:55] point the people are like a sheep
[1:30:58] without a Shepherd they haven't done
[1:31:00] anything they have no hope they have no
[1:31:02] leader they have no strength they have
[1:31:04] no ability to push back on their enemies
[1:31:06] and therefore the condition of the land
[1:31:08] has stayed as such God sends a man and
[1:31:11] Nehemiah goes into to them and
[1:31:13] essentially gives them his testimony and
[1:31:15] his vision okay and his vision is this
[1:31:18] is what God has blessed me to do he has
[1:31:21] blessed me so far we're going to do the
[1:31:24] good work and they catch the vision and
[1:31:26] rise up with him to do the good
[1:31:28] work
[1:31:30] so God is using a Godly Man to take the
[1:31:33] situation by the horns okay and in a
[1:31:36] time of chaos God always Rises up
[1:31:39] somebody to start initiating the work
[1:31:43] because God has to use men he has to use
[1:31:46] women to fix things whatever it may be
[1:31:50] okay you see it in
[1:31:52] um brother B talks about all it requires
[1:31:55] is one praying person it could be a
[1:31:58] child could be a woman could be a
[1:32:00] housewife could be anything them praying
[1:32:03] God just needs one to bring God on the
[1:32:05] scene to start a work John just talked
[1:32:08] about it with that woman who set she had
[1:32:10] a burden for those meetings paid for the
[1:32:13] venue just gets one sold and deal
[1:32:16] Moody and that man just went a
[1:32:19] fire so that's all God needs is one
[1:32:21] person given over to him yielded in
[1:32:25] their place positionally positioned for
[1:32:27] them to move and for God to move through
[1:32:29] them cuz that's all he needs he needs a
[1:32:31] conduit what's a conduit it's just a
[1:32:33] pipe it has no characteristic of its own
[1:32:36] other than just being a vessel so it
[1:32:38] just that whatever needs to go on top of
[1:32:40] it goes out the other end and that's how
[1:32:42] we are God pours in his spirit and it
[1:32:45] should go out to bless
[1:32:49] others so if we read here in the seven
[1:32:51] Church age book The Ephesian Church J he
[1:32:54] says now I want to see I want to say
[1:32:56] that I believe in leadership but is not
[1:32:59] the leadership of men I believe in I
[1:33:00] believe in the leadership of the Holy
[1:33:02] Ghost coming through the word I believe
[1:33:04] also that God has sent Men set men in
[1:33:06] the church men who are gifted by the
[1:33:08] spirit and they will keep the church in
[1:33:10] order I believe that I believe also that
[1:33:12] the church is ruled over by men that God
[1:33:14] sends to take charge by but that rule is
[1:33:17] by the word so that is not men really
[1:33:20] ruling but the spirit of God for the
[1:33:22] word and spirit are one and that's
[1:33:25] critical because it's not men of their
[1:33:28] own accord doing their own wish it's men
[1:33:30] yielded to the Holy Spirit led by the
[1:33:32] Holy Spirit doing the will of the
[1:33:35] father because without it you look at
[1:33:38] this
[1:33:39] model and in that first church
[1:33:42] age that Spirit of niol
[1:33:46] nianis looks similar to that men taking
[1:33:50] charge men leading but the difference
[1:33:53] here is that these men are led by the
[1:33:55] spirit which means that they're a
[1:33:56] servant to the people not a tyrant to
[1:33:58] the people what nickel adism did is that
[1:34:01] it cut off the source of the spirit to
[1:34:03] the people so that the people had to go
[1:34:05] through them to
[1:34:07] God okay so the balance there is that
[1:34:11] the church should always be in Perfect
[1:34:15] Balance where the pastor is not over the
[1:34:19] church he's a servant to the church the
[1:34:22] deacons are not over the church Church
[1:34:24] they're a servant to the church the the
[1:34:26] church gives these men The
[1:34:29] Authority by the Holy
[1:34:31] Spirit and then those men by The
[1:34:34] Authority that's given to them by the
[1:34:36] people put things in order keep things
[1:34:39] in order do the will of the Father by
[1:34:42] the authority of the people so it's
[1:34:44] always in Harmony and when it gets out
[1:34:46] of whack you see it where the the pastor
[1:34:48] starts ruling the the church it it's
[1:34:51] it's Anarchy and it crushes the people
[1:34:55] and you you'll see it I I've seen it
[1:34:57] when I visit other other churches
[1:34:59] there's one brother especially in
[1:35:01] Brother Paul's church that came from
[1:35:02] another church and it was like that
[1:35:04] where the pastor
[1:35:06] just it was
[1:35:08] abusive not physically but it was just
[1:35:11] he held them over hell constantly and it
[1:35:14] was just a place where it
[1:35:17] was really he was ruling over the people
[1:35:20] and and you
[1:35:22] saw that poor man just never really got
[1:35:24] over it he was always in a state of it
[1:35:27] just it constantly in fear of of God's
[1:35:30] Wrath rather than living in Liberty
[1:35:32] because when it's out of or like in
[1:35:35] God's kingdom it's like that scripture
[1:35:37] says every joint supplieth when it's in
[1:35:40] harmony there's liberty but when it's
[1:35:43] not when you have someone who is who has
[1:35:45] decided to rule over the people with an
[1:35:47] iron fist it crushes the people it cuts
[1:35:50] off the move of the spirit in the people
[1:35:51] and the people suffer and break down
[1:35:53] down because of it so that's why that is
[1:35:56] so important men who are led by the
[1:35:59] spirit of God but have the humil
[1:36:01] humility to
[1:36:03] know that they are a
[1:36:06] servant because without it you have
[1:36:09] tyrants so the other thing here is that
[1:36:13] the people after so many years of just
[1:36:15] living in a state of disarray are Fally
[1:36:18] catching the vision and they're finally
[1:36:20] getting the faith that that that
[1:36:21] Nehemiah has for the job
[1:36:27] and faith can be contagious sometimes
[1:36:30] because you look at it when you got
[1:36:32] someone who who truly believes and is
[1:36:35] doesn't care what anyone else says it
[1:36:38] will start
[1:36:39] overriding unbelief because where light
[1:36:42] is it overcomes darkness and that's why
[1:36:45] confession is so key and that's why the
[1:36:47] right confession is is so critical is
[1:36:49] because when you start confessing by the
[1:36:51] word through faith and Paul talks it has
[1:36:54] to be mixed with faith the word has to
[1:36:55] be mixed together with faith in order
[1:36:57] for it to be strong and when you start
[1:37:00] proclaiming by faith where there your
[1:37:02] healing or testimonies or whatever that
[1:37:04] faith will start to catch on and move
[1:37:06] through the church and you see it here
[1:37:08] with Nehemiah he has caught the vision
[1:37:11] for what he needs to do and he then
[1:37:13] brings that Vision to the people and
[1:37:14] says work with me you're going to either
[1:37:17] work with me or you can
[1:37:19] leave and the people rise up with him to
[1:37:22] do the good work
[1:37:25] so that faith is so critical and this is
[1:37:27] a famous quote here Faith knows where
[1:37:30] it's standing Faith's got big muscles in
[1:37:31] a hairy chest and when he raises up with
[1:37:34] his big muscles everything contrary sits
[1:37:36] down he lets out a scream and it sounds
[1:37:38] like a panther screaming and every Jack
[1:37:39] Rabbit takes to his den face the boss
[1:37:42] all things are possible to them that
[1:37:43] believe all things well you say I might
[1:37:46] ask God too much brother brandom you
[1:37:48] can't ask him enough he loves to do it
[1:37:50] for you
[1:37:54] and he also says faith is the master of
[1:37:56] all
[1:37:59] circumstances because it's connected to
[1:38:02] someone who's unchanging and sees all
[1:38:04] things and if you can just tap into that
[1:38:06] into that
[1:38:09] source is anything too hard for
[1:38:12] God so you just start applying it to
[1:38:14] your
[1:38:15] situation by faith and God can then
[1:38:17] begin moving and it will set everything
[1:38:20] in its place unbelief has to when When
[1:38:22] Faith really takes
[1:38:24] control unbelief has to sit
[1:38:28] down all right so we see the first
[1:38:32] standoff between Nehemiah and samat and
[1:38:34] tobiah but when samat the horonite and
[1:38:37] tobah the servant the ammonite and gesim
[1:38:40] the Arabian heard it they laughed us to
[1:38:42] scorn and despised us and said what is
[1:38:44] this thing that you do will you rebel
[1:38:46] against the king then answered I them
[1:38:48] and said unto them the god of Heaven he
[1:38:50] will prosper us therefore we as servants
[1:38:52] will arise and build but you have no
[1:38:55] portion no right no Memorial in
[1:38:59] Jerusalem so the key thing here their
[1:39:02] first reaction is to scorn them to mock
[1:39:07] them and that's always the devil's
[1:39:10] reaction when you have been given a
[1:39:12] touch by
[1:39:14] God what is the first thing that happens
[1:39:16] when you step out of the church he
[1:39:18] starts picking away at that
[1:39:22] experience now
[1:39:24] that was just em motion nah that was for
[1:39:26] someone else nah n that's not for you
[1:39:28] you don't you don't have you don't have
[1:39:30] the faith to do that remember what you
[1:39:31] did last night yeah no that's not for
[1:39:33] you that's what he does he he he seeks
[1:39:37] to Rob to steal and to destroy anything
[1:39:41] he says is a lie anything he
[1:39:44] does will not prosper and that's their
[1:39:48] first reaction here they hear that
[1:39:50] Nehemiah and the people have risen up to
[1:39:52] do the good work and their first
[1:39:53] reaction is to laugh them to scorn and
[1:39:55] to despise them the second thing they do
[1:39:58] is that the lie to them will you rebel
[1:40:00] against the king Nehemiah literally has
[1:40:03] the papers in his hands with the king's
[1:40:05] seal on
[1:40:07] them and yet they're saying no you're
[1:40:09] rebelling is the
[1:40:11] king that's why you don't take anything
[1:40:14] from the devil as truth anything he says
[1:40:17] is a lie he will always contradict truth
[1:40:21] no matter what happens
[1:40:24] so nehemiah's reaction is according to
[1:40:26] that scripture that we just read in
[1:40:28] Deuteronomy an anite and a moabite have
[1:40:32] no place in the congregation of the Lord
[1:40:35] so that's why he says here you have no
[1:40:37] right no portion no right nor Memorial
[1:40:40] in Jerusalem you have nothing here you
[1:40:43] and I have nothing in common you will
[1:40:45] share nothing here and you will not have
[1:40:48] any part with
[1:40:49] us and that's the key thing key thing
[1:40:51] here with Nehemiah he knows who he is
[1:40:54] he's a Jew a part of the Covenant of
[1:40:56] Abraham in his
[1:40:58] land doing God's bidding and what God
[1:41:01] told him to do in
[1:41:03] restoring
[1:41:04] Jerusalem he has been prophesied in
[1:41:07] Scripture that this would be done in
[1:41:09] troubl sometimes he has the king's
[1:41:12] Authority and he has God's Authority for
[1:41:14] for the
[1:41:15] job but equally as important he
[1:41:19] knows who his enemy is where they are
[1:41:23] and scripture and what their end
[1:41:25] is so by knowing who his script who his
[1:41:29] enemy is he can put them where they
[1:41:32] belong and the key thing for us is that
[1:41:34] we know we should know who we are but we
[1:41:37] ought to know who our enemy is and when
[1:41:38] he comes up against this you put him
[1:41:40] back where he belongs and if he comes on
[1:41:43] your land you pick him up and you put
[1:41:46] him back where he came from and if he
[1:41:48] keeps on doing it a thousand times you
[1:41:50] do it a thousand times back because he
[1:41:52] is now outow on your
[1:41:55] land that is your portion and if he
[1:41:58] tries to come across it you have every
[1:42:00] right and full authority to kick him
[1:42:04] off
[1:42:07] so they have zero rights and Satan has
[1:42:10] zero rights to your life if he puts his
[1:42:12] hand on
[1:42:14] you he has to take it off and if he
[1:42:17] keeps his hand on there is because
[1:42:18] you've allowed
[1:42:20] him that's why we keep our life clean we
[1:42:24] keep everything under under the blood
[1:42:25] you live the best you can every day so
[1:42:29] that when Satan does come up against you
[1:42:32] you have every right to kick him
[1:42:35] off so we read here in the uh seven
[1:42:38] church8 book again now remember this
[1:42:41] Christ in the true church is a
[1:42:42] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:42:44] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[1:42:46] Antichrist spirit will come into the
[1:42:48] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:42:50] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[1:42:53] revealing his Works attempted
[1:42:55] destruction of God's people and the
[1:42:56] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:42:58] the time he is cast into the Lake of
[1:43:00] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[1:43:02] he knows that the people get the true
[1:43:04] revelation of the true church and what
[1:43:06] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:43:08] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:43:10] an invincible Army if they can get a
[1:43:12] true revelation of two Spirits within
[1:43:14] the framework of the Christian church
[1:43:16] and by God's spirit deser and withstand
[1:43:18] the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:43:20] powerless before her he will be as
[1:43:22] definitely thed today as when Christ
[1:43:25] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:43:26] of him in the desert yes Satan hates
[1:43:29] Revelation but we love it with true
[1:43:31] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[1:43:32] Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[1:43:34] will prevail over
[1:43:37] them so Satan has no right he has no
[1:43:40] claim no Memorial in your life and
[1:43:42] that's why he
[1:43:44] fights who you are so
[1:43:46] much and there gets a point where he he
[1:43:49] won't deny the word to you because you
[1:43:51] know that you will not walk away from
[1:43:52] the word but he will make you deny who
[1:43:54] you are he'll make you doubt who you are
[1:43:57] in Christ no no you're not you're not
[1:44:01] fit to take that promise because of X Y
[1:44:03] and Z he'll give you every reason in the
[1:44:05] world if God accepted Rahab all of you
[1:44:08] are
[1:44:10] fine you're
[1:44:12] fine because if God can accept her there
[1:44:15] is no ditch so deep that he is not
[1:44:17] deeper
[1:44:18] still so there is Grace for each and
[1:44:20] every one of us and if he's brought you
[1:44:22] in into his into his heart and he
[1:44:26] has giv you his holy spirit then that's
[1:44:29] it that's it he who started the good
[1:44:32] work will finish it it's not you who
[1:44:36] finishes it it's him what's the number
[1:44:38] one goal of a Believer get the Holy
[1:44:41] Ghost what's the goal after that get in
[1:44:43] your position what's the goal after that
[1:44:45] stay in your position that's it that's
[1:44:49] the gospel that's it anything more
[1:44:53] convoluted than that I is frankly it's
[1:44:57] it's Satan because that's where we get
[1:45:00] into our own minds of I have to be this
[1:45:03] way or I have to be this big something
[1:45:05] you're not anything until God gives it
[1:45:07] to you can a man add a cubit to a
[1:45:09] stature no it's by God's grace that you
[1:45:12] have anything because what it does it
[1:45:14] levels the playing field for those those
[1:45:17] people like John the discipline the
[1:45:20] German rigidity and I can do it and I
[1:45:23] will conquer God has to allow balance
[1:45:27] there and I'm the same way I will if if
[1:45:31] if the gospel was all works I would love
[1:45:33] it because it's no thinking required a
[1:45:36] plus b equals c no thinking it's easy
[1:45:40] but what God wants is us to be reliant
[1:45:42] on him that no matter what how strong
[1:45:44] your strengths are you're always reliant
[1:45:47] on him it's not your discipline it's not
[1:45:49] your inner strength yes I can get up
[1:45:51] every day and I can read two chapters
[1:45:53] pray for two hours before the sun even
[1:45:55] Rises like no it's not
[1:45:58] that it's not that there's times where
[1:46:02] it's going to be a a very quick prayer
[1:46:05] while you're making the kids
[1:46:07] breakfast and if that's it for the day
[1:46:09] and it's heartfelt and that's all you
[1:46:10] can do there's Grace for
[1:46:12] that should that be every day no but
[1:46:15] there's always Grace for where you're at
[1:46:17] and God is obligated to take care of you
[1:46:21] once he's accepted you
[1:46:24] it's not for you to do the type is Ruth
[1:46:28] Ruth is a rank Heathen who was of the
[1:46:32] religion where they offered
[1:46:34] children on altars of fire she comes
[1:46:38] into the
[1:46:39] land she decides to walk in the way she
[1:46:43] then gleans in the field and she's
[1:46:45] working working working until she Catch
[1:46:48] catches the attention of
[1:46:50] Boaz when she's
[1:46:53] has the cloak of Boaz on
[1:46:55] her her working time is
[1:46:58] over because what what that what that
[1:47:01] what that cloak over her meant was
[1:47:04] you're under my protection now which
[1:47:06] means that your problems are my
[1:47:10] problems you don't have to fight
[1:47:12] anymore you don't have to worry no more
[1:47:16] you can just come to me and then I take
[1:47:18] care of it for you no matter how
[1:47:21] impossible it is because I have made a
[1:47:24] promise to you and I'm not like a man
[1:47:26] who
[1:47:28] lies when I swear I swear by myself
[1:47:31] because my word is so
[1:47:33] strong no one can separate me from you
[1:47:38] and I will take care of you because I
[1:47:39] made a promise by myself that I would
[1:47:41] take you to the end and that is God's
[1:47:45] unconditional Grace Covenant to you you
[1:47:50] don't not have to work for it you don't
[1:47:52] have to think for it you just got to
[1:47:54] believe it and wait on him and he'll
[1:47:58] take care of the rest anything more than
[1:48:00] that I'm sorry but as a Catholic
[1:48:04] Spirit there's no
[1:48:06] Penance when you do wrong you don't whip
[1:48:09] yourself you don't flail yourself you
[1:48:11] don't do confession for eight hours you
[1:48:14] don't come up to the altar 14 times in a
[1:48:15] single
[1:48:16] month I've done
[1:48:19] it got the T-shirt Martin Lu poor Martin
[1:48:23] Luther would he got to the point where
[1:48:25] the priest hated him cuz he confessed
[1:48:28] for so long he would get out and get
[1:48:31] back in because like I just thought
[1:48:32] something
[1:48:34] bad they hated him with a passion
[1:48:37] because is that
[1:48:39] liberty
[1:48:42] no the moment you sin you put it in the
[1:48:44] blood it's done no guilt there's no more
[1:48:48] condemnation to them that that that
[1:48:50] totally forget that scripture how that
[1:48:51] end you know
[1:48:54] it the whole point is that there's no
[1:48:57] condemnation there's no
[1:48:58] guilt because you have come under him he
[1:49:01] now sees you through blood all he hears
[1:49:04] is your voice he sees
[1:49:06] nothing and then there's Grace for each
[1:49:08] day for you to overcome the next
[1:49:10] thing and it's you going to him saying I
[1:49:13] need help with this and as Boaz did and
[1:49:17] I love this scripture where Naomi says
[1:49:20] it to Ruth that man will not rest until
[1:49:24] this work or restoration is over for you
[1:49:26] he will not
[1:49:31] rest his job now was to work her job was
[1:49:34] to rest and what did what did Boaz say
[1:49:36] to her stay here I'm going to give you
[1:49:40] these wheat sheaves you feed on this
[1:49:42] while I come back to you and when I come
[1:49:44] back to you it's going to be
[1:49:45] done and no matter how how small or how
[1:49:48] big the problem is you can have the
[1:49:51] confidence to be able to go to him and
[1:49:52] say this is my problem and he takes it
[1:49:55] but you got to give it and leave it you
[1:49:58] can't give it and hold
[1:50:01] it because what's the hardest thing for
[1:50:03] a human to
[1:50:05] do
[1:50:07] surrender relinquish
[1:50:09] control give up your
[1:50:13] rights that's the hardest thing to do is
[1:50:15] to is to open really open yourself up to
[1:50:19] whatever may
[1:50:20] happen it is terrifying Ling I hate
[1:50:24] it I can't stand it because what it is
[1:50:28] there's a comfort there's a comfort in
[1:50:29] control there's a comfort in doing
[1:50:31] things yourself and and trying to solve
[1:50:34] your own problems because you know it's
[1:50:36] going to happen is but at least you're
[1:50:38] in control and you know what could or
[1:50:40] could not happen with God he requires
[1:50:42] you to give it leave it and then step
[1:50:45] back and just allow it to happen What
[1:50:48] come what
[1:50:51] may but
[1:50:54] but he then has the Liberty to actually
[1:50:58] fix it correctly at the
[1:51:01] root rather than constantly cutting
[1:51:05] off at the
[1:51:08] top so God is so
[1:51:12] willing so willing to be an active God
[1:51:16] in your
[1:51:18] life and the only one holding him back
[1:51:21] is you
[1:51:24] and it could be for a myriad of reasons
[1:51:26] legit
[1:51:28] reasons you know you you see the things
[1:51:30] people
[1:51:31] suffer and it's a
[1:51:34] lot and it can get in the way of their
[1:51:37] relationship with
[1:51:41] God but if you want to
[1:51:43] grow where the BR talks about it where
[1:51:45] it's you'll see a a stock of
[1:51:48] corn and it's growing it's growing but
[1:51:51] then there there could be Rock land on
[1:51:53] it and it bends the corn wheat or the
[1:51:56] the the cornstock over but it it will
[1:51:58] keep on growing cuz not cut off from the
[1:52:01] Life Source but it will grow crooked
[1:52:04] because that rock is on it so it'll grow
[1:52:05] crooked and it will go up and if you
[1:52:08] take that rock
[1:52:10] away the the thing is away the thing
[1:52:14] that was holding you back is gone but
[1:52:16] you're still bent in that shape you
[1:52:19] still feel the same because you've been
[1:52:22] in that position position for so long
[1:52:24] and brother Lon uh compounded uh
[1:52:27] expounded on this and he said the longer
[1:52:30] that rock is there the longer it takes
[1:52:31] for it to to be restored that's why you
[1:52:34] see childhood trauma things that happen
[1:52:37] in your childhood take the longest to go
[1:52:38] is because it happens when you're the
[1:52:40] youngest and when you're the most
[1:52:41] vulnerable so when that thing comes off
[1:52:44] of you you feel the same you're
[1:52:47] delivered but it's it's still you still
[1:52:50] feel the same because you're still in
[1:52:51] the same shape what brother Lonnie said
[1:52:53] is that what fixes that dwelling in the
[1:52:56] presence of the Sun and as you grow and
[1:52:58] feed on the
[1:53:00] word pray and just dwell in his presence
[1:53:05] that Brokenness will start to straighten
[1:53:09] out and there comes a point where it
[1:53:11] doesn't you can't even see where the the
[1:53:14] Brokenness
[1:53:16] was so it doesn't matter how you
[1:53:20] feel is the thing gone or not and if it
[1:53:23] is gone just dwell in his
[1:53:25] presence and you'll come out perfectly
[1:53:30] whole so
[1:53:33] dwell
[1:53:35] dwell lay in the presence of the Sun and
[1:53:39] let that greenness bake out of you
[1:53:42] because more often than not that's the
[1:53:43] part where Satan gets to us you feel the
[1:53:46] same but you're not the
[1:53:49] same he's taking care of the problem you
[1:53:51] just got to believe believe it's gone if
[1:53:53] he said it's true believe it and you'll
[1:53:56] come out whole fixed resilient and able
[1:54:01] to resist
[1:54:02] it no matter what it is and you can plug
[1:54:05] your problem in
[1:54:07] there okay we uh we're getting to the
[1:54:11] end
[1:54:16] here we have the privilege to enforce
[1:54:18] upon Satan the claims that God gives us
[1:54:21] for God has a law in his word is a
[1:54:23] law and God in this word made certain
[1:54:26] claims to the church therefore we have a
[1:54:27] right to enforce these claims upon Satan
[1:54:30] and say give it back and he has to do it
[1:54:32] because we can take our God's
[1:54:34] agent because we can take God's agent
[1:54:36] the Holy Spirit go right down in our
[1:54:38] knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord
[1:54:40] he's got to give it up that's all
[1:54:41] because the holy spirit is there to make
[1:54:43] him do
[1:54:44] it the law of the lands to enforce it's
[1:54:47] by the land for the land but the law of
[1:54:50] the spirit of God is to force Satan to
[1:54:52] give up that which he has unrightfully
[1:54:54] deceitfully taken from God Souls of men
[1:54:57] he took from God Souls of women children
[1:54:59] sickness of the body he placed upon the
[1:55:01] people where God Made Them In His Image
[1:55:04] to be like him and the church has given
[1:55:06] the rightful legal rights by the Bible
[1:55:08] to take the Holy Spirit and force this
[1:55:10] upon
[1:55:11] him so when you are called by God into
[1:55:14] your position you have all of Heaven
[1:55:15] behind you and like shamgar before he
[1:55:20] got to a point where he was sick and and
[1:55:22] tired of the same thing happening every
[1:55:26] year they come and steal everything and
[1:55:29] I'm tired of
[1:55:31] it and God worked a miracle through him
[1:55:33] he took an ox go with just a stick with
[1:55:36] a piece of iron in the in the top of it
[1:55:39] and the First Strike should have broken
[1:55:41] it but I forget how many he killed it
[1:55:43] was like 700 or
[1:55:47] so and brother banam just talked about
[1:55:49] him so much because it was such he was a
[1:55:51] he was a farmer
[1:55:53] he was a housewife he was a you know
[1:55:55] project manager he was a count planner
[1:55:58] he was a hearing aid thing person he was
[1:56:02] a waiter you know it just it doesn't
[1:56:04] matter like it simple
[1:56:07] people who get tired of the same thing
[1:56:11] happening every day and they're saying
[1:56:14] enough is enough I have full legal
[1:56:18] rights in this situation and I'm tired
[1:56:21] of it and I'm going to start enforcing
[1:56:23] it and John said it the other day you
[1:56:25] don't need to do this great thing all
[1:56:26] you got to do is resist and how do you
[1:56:29] resist by the
[1:56:31] word that's
[1:56:33] it not this huge great effort Christ
[1:56:36] showed it he showed that the weakest
[1:56:38] believer could resist Satan just by
[1:56:40] giving Satan the
[1:56:42] word you don't have to take any of
[1:56:45] it so show Satan your token and he has
[1:56:48] no right to he has every right to flee
[1:56:50] he has to flee
[1:56:53] so if the musicians want to come
[1:56:55] up we can
[1:57:00] stand so if you read here in Isaiah
[1:57:05] 41 thou whom I have taken from the ends
[1:57:08] of the Earth and called thee from the
[1:57:10] chief men thereof and said unto thee
[1:57:12] thou my servant I have chosen thee and
[1:57:14] not cast thee away fear thou not for I
[1:57:18] am with thee be not dismayed for I am
[1:57:20] thy God I will strengthen thee y I will
[1:57:23] help thee yeah I'll uphold thee with the
[1:57:25] right hand of my righteousness behold
[1:57:28] all they that were in sense against thee
[1:57:29] shall be ashamed and confounded they
[1:57:31] shall be as nothing and they that strive
[1:57:33] with thee Shall Perish Thou shalt seek
[1:57:36] them and shall not find them even them
[1:57:38] that contended with thee they that war
[1:57:40] against thee shall be as nothing as a
[1:57:43] thing of not for I the Lord thy God will
[1:57:45] hold thy right hand saying unto thee
[1:57:47] fear not I will help
[1:57:50] thee it's all
[1:57:53] him wait on the Lord and He will
[1:57:56] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[1:57:58] Lord and God knows where you're
[1:58:02] at we all got different problems
[1:58:04] different issues and whatever it may be
[1:58:07] God sees it he hears it and there's an
[1:58:09] appointed
[1:58:10] time there's an appointed time for
[1:58:13] everything everything has an expiration
[1:58:16] date and you look at it's in Isaiah as
[1:58:20] well the amplifi does it really well and
[1:58:21] it talk talks about the
[1:58:23] Assyrians and went and it says it so
[1:58:26] well because it says when the Assyrian
[1:58:28] is within sight of his
[1:58:31] goal then God comes down and hws them
[1:58:35] like a lumberjack hewing
[1:58:37] trees and he cuts the head off when the
[1:58:41] enemy is within sight of his goal God
[1:58:44] comes down on the scene if you want a
[1:58:48] scripture that shows what happens when
[1:58:50] God
[1:58:52] finally shows up on the scene read Psalm
[1:59:19] 18 you can pull up
[1:59:22] verse one I will love thee oh Lord my
[1:59:24] strength the Lord is my rock and my
[1:59:26] Fortress and my deliverer my
[1:59:28] God my strength in whom I will trust my
[1:59:31] Buckler and the Horn of my salvation and
[1:59:32] my high tower I will call upon the Lord
[1:59:35] who is worthy to be praised so shall I
[1:59:37] be saved from my enemies the Sorrows of
[1:59:39] death compassed me and the floods of
[1:59:40] ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows
[1:59:43] of Hell compassed me about the snares of
[1:59:45] death prevented me in my distress I
[1:59:47] called upon the Lord and Cried unto my
[1:59:49] God he heard my voice out of his Temple
[1:59:51] and My Cry came before him even to his
[1:59:53] ears then the Earth Shook and trembled
[1:59:55] the foundations also of the hills moved
[1:59:57] and were shaken because he was wroth
[1:59:59] there went up a smoke out of his
[2:00:00] nostrils and fire out of his mouth
[2:00:02] devoured C coals were kindled by it he
[2:00:05] bowed the heavens also and came down
[2:00:06] Darkness was under his feet and he rode
[2:00:08] upon a cherub and did fly yay he did fly
[2:00:11] upon the wings of the wind he made
[2:00:13] Darkness his secret place his Pavilion
[2:00:14] round about were dark Waters and thick
[2:00:16] clouds of the skies at the brightness
[2:00:18] that was before him his thick clouds
[2:00:21] passed hailstones and coals of fire the
[2:00:24] Lord also thundered in the heavens in
[2:00:25] the highest gave his voice hailstones
[2:00:27] and coals of fire yay he sent out his
[2:00:30] arrows and Scattered them and shot out
[2:00:31] Lightnings and discomforted them then
[2:00:33] the channels of water were seen and the
[2:00:35] foundations of the world were discovered
[2:00:37] at thy rebuke O Lord at the blast of the
[2:00:39] breath of thy
[2:00:40] nostrils he sent me from above he took
[2:00:43] me he drew me out of many Waters he
[2:00:45] delivered me from my strong enemy and
[2:00:47] from them which hated me for they were
[2:00:48] too strong for me they prevented me in
[2:00:51] the day of my calamity but the Lord was
[2:00:52] my stay he brought me forth also into a
[2:00:55] large place he delivered me because he
[2:00:57] delighted in me the Lord rewarded me
[2:00:59] according to my righteousness according
[2:01:01] to the cleanness of my hands hath he
[2:01:02] recompensed me for I've kept the ways of
[2:01:05] the Lord and have not wickedly departed
[2:01:06] from my God for all his judgments were
[2:01:08] before me and I did not put away his
[2:01:10] statutes from me I was also upright
[2:01:12] before him and I kept myself from my
[2:01:14] iniquity therefore had the Lord
[2:01:16] recompense me according to my
[2:01:17] righteousness according to the cleanness
[2:01:18] of my hands and his eyesight with the
[2:01:21] merciful thou will show thyself merciful
[2:01:23] with an upright man thou will show
[2:01:25] thyself upright with the pure thou shall
[2:01:27] show thyself pure and with the forward
[2:01:28] th will show thyself forward for thou
[2:01:31] will afflict The Afflicted people th
[2:01:32] will save The Afflicted people but will
[2:01:33] bring down high looks for thou will
[2:01:35] light my candle the Lord my God will
[2:01:38] lighten my darkness and this is
[2:01:41] when this is when it's first
[2:01:45] God God comes down on the scene and the
[2:01:48] difference with God is that he doesn't
[2:01:50] do all of
[2:01:56] he doesn't do all the victory himself he
[2:01:59] wants you to taste victory for
[2:02:01] yourself you look at the those
[2:02:04] kings he put them all in a cave shut
[2:02:07] them up kill all of them and then he
[2:02:09] brought the captains he brought the
[2:02:11] captains to that cave and he said bring
[2:02:13] them out he said put your feet on their
[2:02:16] necks what is that showing they are
[2:02:18] beneath you they are defeated you are
[2:02:23] above them they will never rise you are
[2:02:26] the
[2:02:27] Victor this part next is God saying all
[2:02:32] right now it's your
[2:02:33] turn he wants you to have a part in it
[2:02:36] but it's only by him through you that
[2:02:39] you can do
[2:02:40] it so if we go to the next
[2:02:45] verse for by Thee I have run through a
[2:02:48] troop and by my God have I leaped over a
[2:02:50] wall as for God his his way is perfect
[2:02:52] the word of God the word of the Lord is
[2:02:54] tried he is a buckler to all all those
[2:02:56] that trust him for who is God save the
[2:02:58] Lord and who is a rock Save Our God it
[2:03:00] is God that GTH me with strength and
[2:03:02] maketh my way per perfect he maketh my
[2:03:04] feet like Hines feet and Seth me upon
[2:03:06] high places he teacheth My Hands to War
[2:03:09] so that a bow of Steel is broken by my
[2:03:11] arms thou has also given me the shield
[2:03:13] of thy salvation and thy right hand ha
[2:03:14] holded me up and thy gentleness hath
[2:03:16] made me great thou has enlarg my steps
[2:03:18] under me that my feet do not slip I have
[2:03:21] pursued my enemies and overtaken them
[2:03:23] neither did I turn again till they were
[2:03:24] consumed I have wounded them that they
[2:03:26] were not able to rise they are Fallen
[2:03:28] under my feet for thou is GED me with
[2:03:30] strength unto the battle thou subbed
[2:03:32] under me those that rose up against me
[2:03:35] thou has also given me the necks of my
[2:03:36] enemies that I may destroy them that
[2:03:38] hate me they cried and there was none to
[2:03:39] save them even unto the Lord but he
[2:03:41] answered them not then did I beat them
[2:03:43] small as the dust before the wind I did
[2:03:45] cast them out as the dirt in the streets
[2:03:47] thou has delivered me from the strivings
[2:03:49] of the people and thou has made be the
[2:03:50] head of the heathen a people whom I have
[2:03:52] not known Shall Serve me as soon as they
[2:03:55] hear of me they shall obey me the
[2:03:56] strangers shall submit themselves unto
[2:03:58] me the strangers shall fade away and be
[2:04:00] afraid of their close places the Lord
[2:04:02] liveth and blessed be my rock and let
[2:04:05] the god of my salvation be exalted it is
[2:04:08] God that avenge me and subdueth the
[2:04:10] people under me he had deliver me from
[2:04:12] my enemies yay thou has lift me above
[2:04:14] those that rise up against me thou has
[2:04:16] delivered me from the violent man
[2:04:18] therefore Lord I give thanks unto thee
[2:04:20] Oh Lord among the Heathen and sing
[2:04:21] praise Praises unto thy name great
[2:04:23] Deliverance giveth he to his King and he
[2:04:26] showeth Mercy to his anointed to David
[2:04:29] and to his seed forever more who is his
[2:04:32] seed we are his
[2:04:35] seed that is how God reacts to your
[2:04:38] problems when the appointed time has
[2:04:42] come he delivers you and he strengthens
[2:04:45] you for
[2:04:46] war so that you can be the Victor and I
[2:04:50] love the part of it because it says
[2:04:52] he beats them to Dust Till You can't
[2:04:54] even find a shred of them left and when
[2:04:57] God's Victory is done it's complete it's
[2:04:59] total and it's it's there's nothing left
[2:05:02] of the enemy and he does that in order
[2:05:05] to show
[2:05:07] you that when that enemy is destroyed in
[2:05:10] your life you don't have to fear it ever
[2:05:13] again ever he destroys it destroys the
[2:05:17] memory of it and removes the desire so
[2:05:20] it cannot return ever again again but
[2:05:23] what it requires is
[2:05:24] surrender giving God control being in
[2:05:27] your position and letting him move
