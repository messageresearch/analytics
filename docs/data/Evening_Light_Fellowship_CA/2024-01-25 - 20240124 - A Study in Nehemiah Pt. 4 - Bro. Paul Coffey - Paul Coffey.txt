to the doctors we love you so much Lord and we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen and we can stand turn to uh 1 John N verse four and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness God bless his word you may be seties all right so this is part four in our journey to the uh life of Nehemiah even though we have not talked about Nehemiah yet this is the last stop before we hit Nehemiah okay it's going to make it all worthwhile promise so uh John has me up in two weeks time and I'm already studying the first one I'm excited I hope you'll be excited um realizing that Nehemiah is uh is becoming a treat to study even though that through our parts that um they were a bit more Hands-On back in the Old Testament than they are today um so there's going to be a couple things that he does that wouldn't necess necessarily recommend in a church but um God allowed it and God blessed it and it did did what had to do in for the children of Israel So today we're going to talk about Ezra so today is um is going to be a bit more of a not not a heavy one but the the subject matter is a bit more um bit more intense in terms of what Ezra had to do to kind of turn back the tide of what Satan was trying to do to the children of Israel so so as always we're going to do a bit of review we'll do it quickly so uh the last time we talked about zerubabel um and how he restored the temple so just so everyone's on the same page when David was king um he made Solomon the next king of Israel Solomon did well until he uh started marrying Pagan women and this is what started the process of judgment in the land of Israel and you see that cycle just completely obliterated uh the the land of Israel it just it never recovered until rubel came so because he married those Pagan women those Pagan women brought in Baal and the worship of Baal and what that brought into Israel was every matter of evil and uh every type of perversion and immorality that you can imagine till the it got to the point where you had a king in Judah who was sacrificing his own children and burning them with fire um hezekiah's father was the one who did that and then his son made it even worse to the point where he uh murdered the prophet Isaiah by putting him in a tree and sawing him in half so that idolatry was so was so prevalent in the two kingdoms that God had to do away with both of them obviously the Kingdom of Israel which was the 10 tribes was totally uh given over to Satan essentially and after only a brief few hundred years they get scattered to the winds and they never ever come back ever it was total Annihilation total judgment no Grace they were so given over whereas the land the the the line of Judah there was Grace for Judah why was there Grace for Judah because there was an unconditional Co Covenant called the David Covenant and that promise that was given to David was the only thing that held the line of Judah together and there was Grace for the children of David and the Kings so not all of them were good obviously most it was mainly hit and miss you had a couple good ones in Jehoshaphat you had Hezekiah you had joziah you had joash and a couple other ones and that held off that held off the Judgment that that was coming but because of the alliance of the the kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel through the marriage of Ahab and Jezebel's uh daughter with David's great great great great grandson that conversion of of those two Bloodlines brought in the worship of Baal and that forever infected Judah so sin was in the camp and never got stamped out and it just snowballed and snowballed until finally God had to say enough is enough it's over by the time Jer Jeremiah comes the writing is on the wall judgment comes in the form of the Babylonians they come in three waves they completely strip Judah dry they get rid of all the the the Learned man and that's where we see David or Daniel and the three Hebrew children they were the cream of the crop and you see it that like uh Nebuchadnezzar wanted to take the best out of Israel first and they got rid of it and then they came back for the next best and they got rid of it and finally they were coming back for just the scraps Satan is the same way he doesn't want to leave anything behind he wants to steal crush and Destroy he's not content with the best he wants all of you but but thank thanks be to God we have a covenant amen we have Grace we have an atonement that is he can't cross that bloodline and that's that's the mercy that we have today so even though judgment came in the land the temple was burned all the treasure was taken away the Ark of the Covenant was lost forever there was a promise that after seven years that I will restore sayeth the Lord and Jeremiah says to to the people I know the thoughts towards you thoughts of peace to bring you to an expected end and this process now even though it was so desolate you had the conditions in Jerusalem were terrible you had a land burning you had corpses everywhere you had plague famine every matter of just awfulness present in Jerusalem there was still that promise of of Jeremiah saying to them I know the thoughts I have towards you thoughts of peace and even though it was at its darkest moment there was Grace coming because unfortunately there's a promise that whatsoever man Seth that shall he reap and they had to reap what they sowed but there was Grace coming so they get sent off into the land of Babylon they are there for 70 years that's where we see Daniel is mainly ministering to the kings of Babylon and then Persia Cyrus the Great uh in the year 5 37 declares not of his own accord this is a man completely controlled by prophecy here because he was named by name by Isaiah saying this is my shepherd and whom Israel will be delivered by Cyrus declares the people free he sends zerubabel down into uh Jerusalem and that's where they begin restoring the temple and we remember the the what happened there that the Samaritans came up against them they stopped the work of the temple and it looked like it was just totally done finished the work was completely over but that's where God sends in a a fire brand by the name of hegi and hegi is only on the scene for four very short candle burning on both ends period and he comes in guns blazing and essentially just spanks them from head to toe and says you are complacent you have let this get to you there's no reason for this to get to you you need to overcome this and get the job done they get it done he cleans them up and in four years time they build a temple and this is where we come into with Ezra so uh Ezra is the second so there there's three there's three waves of desolation in terms of what happens to Judah the cre of the crop gets turned away the second is Ezekiel and a number of other people are taken away and then finally the third is the temple and the city get totally burned and demolished in terms of the restoration again it's also three waves zerubba is the first but it starts with the temple first because the temple was the heartbeat of the whole Kingdom without the Temple Israel was nothing it had to be the temple first God restored worship first and only then would he start restoring everything else and Ezra Ezra was that second figure and Ezra comes about 11 years before Nehemiah comes and his his work was quite critical because he comes at a time where again Israel is on the precipice of going back to everything that they they were punished for okay so he gets the job done and then Nehemiah comes on but Ezra stays on and Ezra and Nehemiah are like essentially good cop and bad cop and Nehemiah is essentially the one who does all the dirty work doesn't care what he got to do to get the job done you know it took zerubabel four years to rebuild the Temple it takes Nehemiah 52 days to restore the walls of Jerusalem he was an absolute fire brand whereas Nehemiah Nehemiah after he does what he does here and we're going to talk about it today he then restores the law and he restores the the the the the feasts and and and the reading of the law to the people and then finally Nehemiah restores the wall s and the the protection of the city so so Ezra is a super critical figure and his name actually means God helps and then when Nehemiah comes his name mean God God Comforts so God sends two people that's going to going to be help and comfort to the people of Judah so after and what what's interesting is that you have uh Ezra and Nehemiah working and there's a brief period in the book book of Nehemiah where where Nehemiah goes back to Persia and during that time things slip again and God SS in Malachi during that brief Junction and he Nails all the same things that Ezra is nailing here today and then Nehemiah comes back and with the last chapter one of the craziest chapters that I think we'll read with with Nehemiah and he just sweeps the whole land in terms of everything that he saw so Ezra is a scribe he's a priest but most importantly he is a prophet and he's of the lineage of uh of the priests and he was a very sincere man he by being a scribe he knew the law by heart and he had to if he was going to be a scribe and uh so he was chosen by the king I think it was King haueris and he gets sent uh by um he gets sent with uh with the the the fewest amount of people out of all the the waves of people coming back zerel had had the most amount of people Ezra had the fewest amount so for whatever reason that restoration period was start starting to falter so let's turn to uh Ezra 7 you can either read along here or you can turn to your Bible it's probably better if follow along here so if you go to Ezra 7:6 this Ezra went up from Babylon and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses which the Lord God of Israel had given and the King granted him all his request according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him and there went up some of the children of Israel and of the priests and of the Levites and the singers and the porters and the netham unto Jerusalem in the seventh year of AR arer I thought was Aeris I think Aeris is the king that um dealt with Esther I believe where that is has has thank you verse eight and he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the seventh year of the king for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon him for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments so his main man was to bring the word of God back to the people they had Temple worship which was great they had sacrifices which was great but they had to have the word okay the message for that time was the law and the prophets they couldn't just have the prophets they couldn't just had the law they had to have the law and the prophets okay and that really hasn't changed it it's still the word and and the prophets so there is uh a desire has been put in Ezra's heart to bring this to the people of Israel and when we get there we we we see why and and and what's interesting is that they have just restored the temple the temple has just been restored the sacrifice is there but they need the word okay and for any young person who gets filled with the Holy Ghost the soul is the Temple of the of of of the human once God fills the the soul of of an IND individual with a spirit the word has to be poured out upon that person has to be poured out like water upon a seed and it has to water it and let it grow and let it nourish and strengthen keep on pouring and pouring and pouring because a a young Christian is like a is like a fresh young sprig what does it need it needs the atmosphere of the sun and it needs water to grow and any person who gets filled with the Holy Ghost has to feed feed feed feed feed on the word nothing else nothing nothing else but the word otherwise it's going to get stunted and it's going to grow crooked its roots are not going to go down and eventually once the summer heat comes it's going to shrivel and dry out so that that word the the the the word of God in the heart of of a young person has to be poured on and poured on and poured on otherwise they're not going to survive the test once the test comes because there you notice God doesn't send the same tests to a young Christian like he does to a pastor there's a there's a season and a period of Grace and and what what what God is doing is he's allowing that little Eagle to learn how to fly to learn how H how to deal with with the challenges but the way that little Eagle got got got to grow is by feeding feeding from that mother Eagle all right so ultimately the there there's a there's a higher purpose for why Ezra is is being sent here because the the children of Israel had a higher standard required of them than all the other nations around them even the ones that were because remember Abraham is the father of Israel but Abraham is also the father of many nations so most of the Nations around them are actually related to them because you have Moab who is a descendant of Lot's daughter you have Ammon who's a descendant of the other uh daughter of lot so you have essentially cousins around them they have a form of worship you look at balum he was close he was very close almost identical but he didn't have the spirit he didn't have the law of Moses and the law of Moses for them was life it's not for us obviously but for them that was their message and God had a requirement that they had to be cleaner and more set aside and separate than any any other nations and what was the purpose behind that and we'll get into it so if you go to deuteron omy uh 14:2 for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord hath chosen to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the Earth and brother brandham says here in a blessing Prophet now Israel was a chosen elected selected people that God had chosen Israel for one specific purpose that the blood of Israel should be the cleanest bloodstream for out of that lineage was going to come the Messiah himself okay so that land had to be pure because out of that land was coming the Messiah which was not only Grace and Life to Israel but Grace to All Nations so Israel had to be set aside for that purpose so Ezra is uh he arrives in Jerusalem and there's just a brief period where he's essentially just getting his Affairs in order and the princes come to him and tell him about what's going on in the land and we read it here in verse one of chapter nine now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their Abominations even of the Canaanites the Hittites the parasites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the Egyptians and the amorites for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yay the hand of the prince and rulers hath been Chief in this trespass so what's interesting here is that they have done the exact same thing that their forefathers have done okay and it's just it's like a it's like a bad dream it just keeps on repeating itself over and over and over and they do it again I think twice over before everything is done and the reason for that is that the law of Moses covers the sin but it doesn't remove the desire for sin and you see that in them that they just can't help themselves they keep on going back to it but they knew better and they should have known better because the the desolation of Jerusalem was only should have been fresh in their minds but the desire for sin kept on pulling them back and what's interesting here is that the chief of the Sinners was the rulers the princes but not only that it was the Levites and the priests it was pervasive that sin was coming from the top and that's why you see when whenever um and that's why God requires more of leaders because if the leader does it it's a lot harder for the UN for the underling or the person underneath them to resist doing the same thing okay and that's why God requires more of the father than he does of the child because the child needs the help of the father in order to live right until that that child can reach maturity so you have here these the the the sin is starting from the top so then what happens is that everyone else just gets swept right under and you see that during times past in in the history of Israel that when the King was totally given over to that sin it's ranked throughout everyone else but when the King was righteous you there was a lot less chance of that of that sin being pervasive so it behooves us to to remember of you got to be you got to be mindful of those who are under you but also of those who are weaker than you because it's also that that whole principle in Romans 14 that you got to be careful what you do because if you if you uh a offend your brother but also cause him to do it by uh um through weakness then you're guilty for it because you may be able to handle it but not him so you got to be careful in terms of doing that all right moving on to Deuteronomy 7 so this is where we see the original commandment of Moses of what not to do and which they did verse one when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whether thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before Thee the Hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the Canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites Seven Nations greater and mightier than thou and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee Thou shalt Smite them down uh Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them Thou shalt make no Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto them neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter Thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son for they would turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you and Destroy thee suddenly so the promise here is that if they did this judgment was coming immediately and you saw it there with the the first time that when they came out of Egypt when Moses goes up into Mount Si they after 40 days they start murmuring and complaining and they go to Aaron and say make us a god they make the God God sent she Taps Moses on the shoulder and says this the children have of Israel have commanded pedom with idolatry and you notice when when Moses goes down there he immed it's immediate judgment those who are with God come over here those who are not over there those who did not repent or swallowed them up immediately it it it was it was sudden it was drastic and that's how God dealt with that sin so Ezra knew that Israel here is in a precarious position if God does one thing in the exact same situation before he's obligated to do the same thing again he's he's a he is a god of Mercy but he's also a god of judgment okay and especially due to the fact that they knew better they had just been restored they just had the temple restored so this whole process is mindboggling that that sin set in the camp so quickly despite everything that just happened to them but the grace of the situation here is is that despite what Israel had done here despite what the priests had done the Levites the rulers the princes despite all that God had a man prepared in the background ready for the moment he was he was clean he was not touched by the sin and he was ready to be put in that moment and to be essentially to stand in the gap for the people so let's jump back to the Tom of balum because this is relevant and if we remember about the story of balum he was uh this is the time when Israel was was going from Egypt into Israel for the first time with Moses and the the moabites were afraid of the children of Israel because at the time Israel had defeated essentially the greatest nation of the time Egypt they had the greatest military the greatest Feats they had the greatest um architecture it it was by far the the richest Kingdom of the time and they brought Egypt to their knees to the point where Egypt gave them uh tribute in order to get them out of the land so all the other nations are terrified of them and Moab especially so balum who is a prophet of God he was a legit prophet of God God did speak to him he was hired by the king of of Moab to curse Israel so we all know know the story that bam tries he tries to go Angel stopped all that stuff so finally balum finds a way to get Israel and we see it here in numbers 25 ver1 and Israel Abode in Shum and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bow down to their gods and Israel joined himself unto Bale pure and the anger of the Lord was King kindled against Israel and the Lord said unto Moses take all the heads of the people and hang them before the Lord against his son that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel and Moses said unto the judges of Israel slay everyone his men that were joined into Bale peor so we see here the idolatry happens Israel gets joined to Baal which is the first time ever that this ever happens but we see the difference here of what happens when when there's a man of God on the scene who cuts this thing off so Moses immediately says through God's commandment slay everyone who is worshiping Baal because we all because we we've we've now seen it what happened to the where it goes It goes to to child sacrifice burning children on the fire murdering prophets this that that is the end result but Moses sees the sees the seed Okay so God raises up a man here to take care of the situation and verse six and behold one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his Brethren a medidan itish woman in the sight of Moses in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel who were weeping before the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and when Phineas the son of el Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of Israel okay so because of this this is what the Lord says unto Moses and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Phineas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest hath turned away my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consumed them not the children of Israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold I give unto him my Covenant of peace and he shall have it and is seed after him even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israel so it seems extreme in terms of what phas did what Phineas did but God counted it onto him for for righteousness sake because he sees the sin of what's happening because he knows what Moses said over here don't do it don't do it because judgment is coming if this is tolerated so Phineas goes in and does the deed and what that does is that sin stops immediately it goes no further because everyone steps back and says whoa we're it gets everyone's attention and it stays and that's and that's how sin has to be dealt with it has to be dealt with firmly and quickly because you can't control sin sin is a fire it will consume everything if you allow it and that's why God was so pleased with what Finas did is because it put a giant period behind Baal Baal was stamped out before he had any chance to to have a tow hold because sin always starts with a toll hold no stronghold occurs without a toll hold and because Phineas never tolerated it God was so pleased with that man he said his entire family for all time time is going to be blessed because this one what one man did and there may be generational curses in the Bible but there are generational blessings in the Bible amen okay it's not all negative in terms of the a visit unto the fourth and fifth generation this man has been blessed for All Time and Eternity because he did one right thing and it behooves us that like when it comes to there are the not all days in in our lives are are equally as important there are times where God has prepared you for one specific moment and if you do that right thing you are blessed you know I you know not to put dad on a pedestal but I look at that one moment where Dad sees that ad and he looks back at it that was that moment that from there's three generations of Believers because of that turning back at that ad three generations there's there's a church because of that one ad there's there is there there is a light on this side of the island because of and there's Chad because of that ad especially Chad there'd be no clintar without dad you should thank him after but look at it atonement that one Javelin thrust was atonement because God knows that's where that's going you you don't see it now hard decisions may seem they may look extreme in terms of standing for what's right in your family in terms of what in terms of applying the token in your family it may seem extreme now but the Holy Ghost sees what's coming you don't see it but Faith sees the Unseen and it sees What could happen the wise man seeth the evil far off and hides himself the foolish man gets punished Faith sees what we don't see and you have to trust it you have to trust it brother B talks about and there's a quote later on that that I'll read that love Faith is nothing without love it starts with love love sets it up and Faith goes out in the battlefield but it starts from a foundation of love so anything that you make in terms of a decision for your family for yourself for the church your job whatever it may be it comes from a foundation of love and faith goes out on the battlefield for it and that's the heart thing about the word of God the word of God is the only is the only absolute when it comes to love in this world now love has been so diluted it's been so diluted and you see you see the effect of it now now where because out of love you have to accept every lifestyle you have to accept every every anything and everything everyone does and because of it you the the world's a total mess but by contrast you have the word of God and and God's love which will do things that seem hurtful at the moment but it's like the pruning the pruning seems hard but what it does is that it forces the root down so that the fruit goes up disciplining a child disciplining a child seems hard at the time but you're raising a good citizen it seems troubling to to a person who doesn't understand tough love but at the end of the day it's out of love for that person that you make a stand all right so back to Phineas God was so pleased with that because there was no hesitation he saw it and and and what was so Brazen what was so Brazen about this is that that man LED that woman right in front of Moses right in front of him and essenti she was CH it was a challenge it was a challenge to God are you going to do what you say you're going to do and Phineas immediately goes and does the deed there's no hesitation he sees the sin and he takes it out so God was so pleased with that but you see that God God God has blessed other men for these decisions you look at Abraham um and said by myself have I sworn sayith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply they seed as the stars of the heaven and as a sand which is upon the seashore and thy seede shall be get shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in and in th seede shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice so you see that blessing is upon Abraham's seed not only to Isaac and Jacob and Joseph but for his seed forever and us we're included in that promise so we are blessed because of what Abraham has done and that's 4,000 years of blessings that are perpetually rolling on because of what Abraham did and you see you look at Abraham he his characteristic is is what faith when anyone talks about faith it always goes back to Abraham but you see that characteristic trickle down to Isaac you look at Isaac and how he reacted when he's on that altar there's not a peep out of Isaac he takes it silently he trusts his father he has faith in his father that what whatever his father does is the right thing and that is for his own good and you look at Jacob he may have been a Sher but you look at the faith that he had when he he met up with that angel that man was not letting go of that of that supernatural being until he got what he wanted what is that other than Faith you look at Joseph everything that he went through all all of the the the uh the unfair things that happened to him through it all he's trusting God that there is a greater purpose for this that out of this life is going to come forth what is that other than faith and then there's there's David where um I'll probably just skip reading this but it talks about how because of what David did he was the he was the man after God's Own Heart and he's saying here I will establish Solomon thy son and his seed forever and he did because you look the be despite what Solomon did there was still Grace to to Sal to David and Solomon seed because where did It ultimately end up the ultimate King of Kings Christ he was the seed of David and that continues on further because we are of Christ so and again you look at the the characteristics of David what in my view David's greatest characteristics were were two things one his worship secondly his his his his his first instinct was always run to the temple and pray whenever he was in trouble run to the prophet and pray the mberry bush it was always prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer prayer and you look through his descendants you look at Solomon it was the same thing he was always going to God In Prayer he did mess up afterward but he started well you look at Hezekiah Hezekiah has one of the greatest prayers in the Bible because when he was in trouble he ran to the Lord and his descendants Josiah was the same way joash was the same way these Kings the the the the the blood of David was running through them and they had that same characteristic of always running to the Lord they were always running whereas you look at the kingdoms of of the north of the Israel total total heathens so finally with with with Phineas we read here in Psalms where he kind of recounts everything that happens to him then stood up Phineas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed and that was counted onto him for righteousness unto all generations forever more and I said all that to say this now after these things in the reign of AR exes king of pers Ezra the son of sah the son of azra the son of hilaya the son of shalam the son of zadok the son of Hub the son of amariah the son of Azariah the son of Maro the son of Zariah the son of uzzi the son of bukai the son of abashi the son of vas who is Ezra the descendant of Phineas the son of elar the son of Baron the chief priest so in re so in going through through all that what was the situation that Israel faced you had a situation where Israel was marrying into the Pagan women okay who were all the other nations they were worshippers of Baal and it got to the point where they even had children with these women it was rooted so the descendant of Phineas who dealt with the exact same thing men who were joining themselves to Heathen women who were worshiping Baal the same descendant of Phineas was facing the exact same problem but multiplied by a 100 because he you now have kids rooted in the family so God has given the the same characteristics that Phineas has you see it in Israel so you see this man who is a scribe he's been Sanctified he's been set aside for service he has the blessing of Phineas upon him and you see him in the exact same situation multiplied by 100 we'll see what he does Ezra n and when I heard this thing I rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonished then were assembled unto me everyone that trembled at the words of the god of Israel because of the transgression of the that have been carried away and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment and my mentle I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God so what's interesting is that the uh the the message of the blushing the blushing Prophet is about Ezra and it talks about how how the sins of the people weighed so heavily upon Ezra that he had no choice but to react like he's reacting here because again as a scribe he knows the history he knows what they had just gone through and he knows where this could go if this doesn't get settled and he also knows what the solution always had to be this is not a light situation this is a very heavy situation and it's now falling on him to do we see here in desperations if you made a mistake some woman made a mistake some man made a mistake some boy or girl made a mistake don't sink scream out in in despair Lord save me or I'll perish get desperate about it God will hear you he always hears a desperate Soul that's what I'm trying to tell you about so you see here Ezra Ezra is baptized in a baptism of anguish and you see here a man in travail and and and and you see he's literally plucking out his beard he he's that overcome with grief over the sins of the people he's so ashamed because it's like how could this happen so quickly we just went through this we've been given a small window of Grace and this is what we do we spit in your face so he understands it's a junction of time mercy and grace are right here in front of him or mer mer and judgment are right here before him and he knows what he has to do so he says here in verse six and said oh my God I am ashamed and blushed to lift up my face to thee my God for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespasses grown up unto the heavens since the days of our fathers have we been in great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our Kings and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the king of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day and now for a little space Grace ha been showed from the Lord Our God to leave us a Remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our God May lighten our eyes and give us a little Reviving in our bondage for we were bomman yet Our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended Mercy on to us in the sight of the kings of Persia to give us a Reviving to set up the house of our God and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem and now our god what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy Commandments which thou has commanded by thy servants the prophets saying the land unto which you go to possess it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands with their Abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness now therefore give Not Your Daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth forever that you may be strong in eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass seeing that thou Our God has punished us less than our iniquities deserve and that's true and has given us such Deliverance as this should we again break thy Commandments and join in Affinity with the people of these Abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou H has consumed us so that there should be no Remnant nor escaping or oh Lord God of Israel Thou Art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of this so we see here the weight of of the situation on ezrael he's saying we gotten less than we deserve and we've had a small window of Grace here please forgive us brother Bram says in a blessing Prophet somebody has got to speak the thing somebody has got to place it before the people perhaps Ezra didn't want to do it but it was in his heart and when you see a servant of God get so sincere till he's on his face with his hands in the air a praying to God and blushing because the iniquity of the people then you're going to see a Revival start a man cannot lay in the presence of God a church cannot stay in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and gives unction and power to start a move of God in there amongst those PE amongst those people just got to be and you see here that Ezra is in such travail he's mourning in front of the people and he gets the attention of the people and see all around him because he's groaning in the spirit he's laboring in the presence of God that everyone around him starts to come under that same anointing and everyone starts mourning and weeping and repenting because all all God requires is one one person one person prayed up and desperate a broken and a contrite spirit he won't despise so when it comes to a situation when it get when it seems like it gets to its darkest and at its worst God send someone who's prayed up and that and that and that the the weight the weight of that situation comes on that man and he pulls all of Heaven down he's literally pulling the solution down because God now has a conduit to work through God God needs a vessel he needs a man to work through in a situation so as long as he has one person one person who's given over to him whose heart is tender towards him he can work through that person despite how hard everyone is around them because if they seed God can melt any any hard heart in a moment we've seen it and in terms of you need one power of God come down and it crumbles all the walls it crumbles the walls of of division it crumbles the walls of of complexes of issues of diseases in a moment I'll never forget that that um those first special meetings with brother Ben NORAD the walls were breathing from the presence of God because what happened there was people who went and start laboring in prayer before it happened they were God gives the unction God gives the desire first he sends his holy spirit out first and those people start praying and God comes down so when when God starts sending his holy spirit out what he's saying he's declaring war on this situation he's saying the time has come for deliverance the time of restoration is upon us and there's nothing there's nothing that can get away from it there's nothing that can that that can even push it back cuz when God starts rolling it's like Psalm uh Psalm 18 he comes down on a cloud a thunder cloud upon a chariot and he just he cast everything down and there's nothing that can stand up against it because when God says the time of freedom is upon us it's upon us now when Ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of God there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great Congregation of men and women and children for the people wept very sore so we're now starting to see the effect of this revival now starting okay we see here again in blessing Prophet somebody has got to speak the thing I think this may be a duplicate yes it is usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation see it's too bad it has to do that but human beings are so slothful in their mind that it takes an emergency something arises and when they do it throws them into that desperation and really in doing that in desperation it brings out the real thing that you are it shows What You're Made Of out in the time of desperation it usually pulls out all the good things that's in you because the problem is is that Satan is a master of complacency he is a master at lulling you to sleep Satan doesn't want you to he he's smart because when he's dealing with Believers he doesn't hit you with fullon sin what he does he starts making you busy and then he starts getting you on the phone and you're just scrolling all the time and then suddenly you're not reading your Bible as much suddenly you're not praying as much as he should be suddenly church becomes a secondary um a secondary thing and then soon once you're in a position of weakness then he can start injecting stuff and again it starts small he's a master at just little bits at a time and eventually it keeps on going and it keeps on going and it keeps on going and what God does Charles Spurgeon has a great great quote he says I've learned to kiss the wave that crashes Me Against the Rock of Ages because what it does in those moments is that God is saying wake up wake up you're in a super you need to wake up and those are the greatest moments of Grace in your life because God is saying okay you need to stop this has gone long enough you have a purpose and you need to get back on track and it happens to all of us because of you look in that quote we're slothful we're slothful in our minds the body is or the spirit is willing but the body is weak okay and you get and you look at what happened to the children of Israel they didn't get married to these women and have kids with them immediately it started with a second look and then it turned to a third look and then it started with a conversation and then it started from there maybe the maybe she allowed him to still worship Jehovah but she said can I just worship my God in the privacy of my home and eventually he's worshiping Baal and eventually the kids know nothing about Jehovah and are only worshiping B and that's where it goes and that's why God has to shock you sometimes to put you in a in a place of desperation for you to wake up for you to snap out of your stuper and get back on track and in those moments is when you got to apply the token because you got to clear out all the things that got you there in the first place and applying the Tok is not just things it's not just the TV it's also what you read it's also what you the relationships you have but it's also what you think about what you think about in your heart all those thing you got to apply the token to the whole thing not just certain areas it's not just the TV or you know these days just the phone it's not just the phone so it's one of those things where it's just that's where calling your uh making your calling election sure that's what that is it's just be attentive don't get into a stuper and make sure that you're checking up with God daily that's making your calling election short just making sure that you are where you where you're meant to be and the only way you can do that is daily daily prayer there's no excuse without doing it you know we all struggle with it but you got to do it you got to go to church and you got to do communion communion is so important communion is The Ultimate Showdown because that's where if you do it in the right way and you're where you need to be it's a blessing if you're not if you're doing as a hypocrite it's a curse so that's why God has communion there it's because it's the ultimate like you got to watch how you're living it's the ultimate okay so everyone's weeping because of what's happening with Ezra so this person sheni the son of jel one of the sons of elim answered and said on it unto Ezra we have trespassed against our God and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my Lord and of those that tremble at the Commandment of our God let it be done according to the law arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do it and then arose Ezra and made the chief priests and the Levites and all Israel to swear that they should do according to his to this word and they swear so they're in a situation where they they they've played around with sin and it's it's gone along for too long so this person this man comes up and says this is what we have to do said we have put ourselves in this position and we have to divorce our Pagan wives and send them and the children that we have had with them away it's tough but they broke God's word it's either that or judgment so what they do is that they apply the token and they cast it out you know that's what happens when we tolerate sin if we play around with it if we let it settle in our lives and let it linger and let it just simmer it's easy to get rid of it when it first comes in the longer you let it take root the more severe the solution has to be this is Extreme you know obviously this is not you know we're not typing this naturally this is spiritually applying the token is easy when you do it at the beginning if you let it linger it's hard okay so next up then Israel rose up from before the house of God and went to the Chamber of jeen the son of aelish and when he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the transgression of them that have been carried away and they made Proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto the children of the Captivity that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem and that whosoever will not come within 3 days according to the Council of the princes in the ERS all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that have been carried away then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within 3 days it was the n9th month on the 20th day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the house of God trembling because of this matter and for the great Reign so not only did they have to do this thing but every person in Israel had to do it if they didn't do it all their substance would be torn away from him and he would be separated forever from being allowed to dwell amongst the Jews there was no choice here for the sake and the health of the Kingdom they had to do it if they didn't do it they're gone and at this point everyone is somber they're serious and they realize the importance of it because they're literally trembling because of this matter so it all ends up with the men going through and ahead with it they divorce their wives they get rid of the kids along with the wives and judgment is stayed okay and Ezra his purpose at this point is done and we see him when when we go into Nehemiah that his his his role turns into establishing the law reading out the law establishing the feast and all that stuff so obviously the the the Les for us here this is an extreme case but God is requiring his people to be clean and set aside for service it may not be sins like this but are you allowing your life to get soft are you allowing your life to get complacent are you allowing Satan to dull your senses because all satan wants to do is take the fight out of you okay he just want what what what what's the problem with his age this age is lukewarm he either wants you cold or other want he wants you hot but the worst is lukewarm and that's what Satan is trying to do with us today is try to make you lukewarm try to get you complacent try to get you to the point where you don't really care where church has just become a routine where your Christian walk has just been routine you're no longer you're no longer on fire for God as as you ought to and really what it is is you've lost your first love and what God is wanting is to shake you and you got to learn to listen to listen to those shakings when he's trying to get your attention he's wanting to get get you back into a path where you're laboring because he wants to use you he can he can only work through a human he can only work through a a man or a woman so he needs you and if you're not where you need to be in terms of your life then the blessings are not flowing as they should your family is not going to be thriving as they should and then therefore by trickle effect the church is not going to be doing well as it should because a strong family comes from a strong father and a strong mother a strong church is a collection of strong families so if you're wondering why what's going on with the church take a step back and look at your family and if there's something on the go with your family take a step back further get a mirror up and look at yourself a problem in the church starts with you and God had mercy upon us because it's so easy to look at the other person and say man if they only would just you know only brother Bob would do better songs we' have better song Services you do great songs um it always starts with you it the moving of God is not it it's not like Israel where it's a to it's a total Nation affair they had no choice to do it but when it comes to us it's an individual Affair so God puts all responsibility upon you if you take care of your end he takes care of the rest if you are where you need to be spirit the church will follow because you look at Ezra because he was strong spiritually the rest of them followed so you can't be critical when you're when you get to a point where where you're being critical is because you're getting lukewarm because when you're lukewarm you're looking at everything but yourself because you've become complacent and when you get lukewarm then you're not you're you're not praying as you ought to you're not reading as you ought to you're not you're not that connection between you and God is is is has become clouded so what God is want so then God what God what God has no choice to do is to send situations at you that that will grab your attention snap you out of your out of your funk and if you don't listen they gradually get worse and worse and worse and worse so we have to we have to be to to be to be spiritual minded to recognize when when when God's trying to get your attention because the other thing the other thing is that this age what was this age commandment in Revelation be zealous therefore and repent and you see here with Ezra he was being zealous therefore and and he put himself in there he wasn't saying the the princes and the Levites are the ones at fault judge them but I've been good no he put himself in there so if you want the church to do well you put yourself in there God I have not I'm not where I need to be and if you want if you're wanting the church to go if you think the church is not where it ought to be look at yourself first responsibility is hard this age is an age of selfishness and of self-love and no one there's no such thing as putting in the work anymore everyone wants to be given everyone wants to fast with no friction but that's not God's way at the end of the day we're supposed to have character and character only comes really from suffering from working at it laboring brother Ram talks about you know car developing characters not God you know pulling through a pipe and saying you overcame what is overcoming it's that little it's that little chick in the egg Peck his way out and it does it over and over and over and over and over and over and once it starts to to break out he's not done yet he got to keep on going he got to keep on going so at the end of the day we can't be ignorant of Satan's devices of how he gets us to a place we where we are lukewarm he always starts small he always starts in places that we don't expect it and more often than not like it's your phone it's it's the it's the getting caught up in business of the world it's getting caught up in business of work it's getting caught up with all these different things it's not simple things but it's things that that distract you okay it's it and eventually if if you if if your spirit gets clouded then he's feeding you he's feeding your thoughts then then he's planning things in your mind complexes distractions all these things and what God is is requiring of his people is to clear all the flu you you look at what brother Braham says in the greatest battle of ever fought you got to clean out all those channels clean out the imagination clean out the conscience clean out the affection clean out the the reasoning clean out the memories clear it all out and move forward forget forget all the hurts forget in terms of remember forget all the heurs forget all the things that you did wrong move forward put all under the blood apply the token to your home and move forward because at the end of the day God wants his people to be honest with him be honest with him recognize when you need help recognize when when you when you need him to to take over because more often than not we get he he he steps back and waits until you admit that you can't do it yourself no matter what it is because if you read in job he he he says uh job says there's nothing insignificant under in the sight of the Lord meaning that in in every problem that you deal with it's you can bring every single one of them to the Lord and He will answer you might he may not answer right away he may not answer the way you want him to but he will answer and what God is trying to develop in his people especially in this age is trust and the hardest thing to do for a Believer is to walk completely by faith to not rely on the arm of Flesh and Trust the unseeing eye because more often than not we see a situation and we want to take over because fear sets in we want to fix it human beings are fixers by nature but what God is trying to do is stop that reflex of trying to take over cour ten Boom has a great quote where it says is prayer your spare tire or your steering wheel are you just going to prayer when you're in trouble and you need to get out of it or is it or is it leading you and guiding you in everything that you do from that time 1962 and when God calls a man to work for him he calls you from Total Annihilation from all the things of the world and the sins of the Earth separation God never did bless Abraham till he fully obeyed him he took his father the old man was always a hair in the soup or excuse that expression but he was always wrong in Abraham and then he got lot and then he finally went down there and after lot separated himself then God said to Abraham rise and walk through the land I've give it all to you it's all yours see he never fully blessed him until Abraham fully obeyed and you'll never be able to get anything from God and have favor with God my brothers and sisters wherever you are until we fully obey obey the word of God you make yourself miserable by just halfheartedly approaching it and there's another quote where brother Braham says you just get enough religion to make you miserable and what what what we need to do is just we have to get serious again go back to the altar not in terms of like getting saved again or baptized whatever but go back to to to where you were last on fire for the Lord and be like what has changed since then that has got me to this place and then move forward and living for God is is not that difficult it it really requires two things who can guess what those two things are read your Bible and pray that's it but do it sincerely don't do it like he's saying here half-heartedly approach it it is your lifeline it's your lifeline it's too late to play Church things are you look at Israel Israel is God's time piece things are wrapping up it's time to trick trim the lamps because what is that it's trimming all the excess that's not burning as well as it should because you get to the end and um you got to cut the fat it's like an athlete before a a like I say a pro fight he's cutting he's cutting as much fat as he can in order to make the weight if he's over the weight he doesn't do the fight and that's the thing for us it's not it's not that we have to put this pressure on ourselves to be perfect but our desire has to be that we want to be perfect you have to set yourself towards the Lord and He will come n thee so our desire is just that's the main thing about it is just there's nothing more important nothing else comes close work is fine we need it to to to live and to eat and all that stuff friends are fine it's it's nice to enjoy life but at the end of the day your whole purpose and your whole being has to be I am going to make it nothing else so at the end of the day you know in this situation the the the applying of the token was quite hard it was quite extreme what they had to do in order for them to get back into right standing and sometimes when we let things slide for a while it's going to hurt applying the token the kids get used to it and it's I've been there where you just you let the standard slide and you're going to say nope can't watch that anymore the whole thing is is just we have to stay vigilant daily you look at the the story Gideon it was only those who were kneeling and looking kneeling and looking and they never ever let their guard down no matter what it's like the other thing it's just like vacation vacation should be the best time for reading your Bible and praying I've yet to master it it's terrible you have the most amount of time and you never like this poor thing it's so lonely but it's just that's where I have to stop trying and go say God vacation is is not going well for me I need help with it because you get into this route of just trying and trying and trying and trying and trying and it's just why and why aren't I asking because God you can ask God simple things and he'll answer but at the end of the day when you do the right right thing there is always a war that comes in behind it God never God does not have any unpaid bills when he when he requires you to make a stand or to to to get your life clean and you obey obedience always has a reward it always always has a reward so this we're rounding down here now in Matthew Jesus says and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is Prof for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell and If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for is it is profitable for for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell so the principle here is don't let the body suffer because you're just trying to hold on to the one thing that you may like at the end of the day there's nothing that should outweigh what God requires from you for your life where there it be because the hardest ones more often not our relationships that those are hard those are hard family that's a really hard one because that's where that affection starts to and that reasoning starts to kind of work on you but God requires a full and total separation from unbelief no matter the sour source thorth and when you separate is only when you get blessed like Abraham with lot Abraham never got the promised son until he did a total separation so if you're not if the full flow of the blessings are not happening in your life what are you holding on to and what it requires is honesty it's hard it's hard to look at yourself um when that mirror of the word is presented before you and you see yourself as you are don't be the type that forgets what you saw there's a special Grace that comes from doing the right thing even though it's hard for the Lord because he'll always re he rewards it seven times greater every time uh if the musicians want to come or musician so Ezra was standing in the gap for Israel he was a man anointed in desperation for the moment and ultimately where did that desperation come from it was a love for God and for his people because he could not allow Israel to go the way that it did before he could not allow that to happen again so because he had a love for God his word and his people he was a vessel prepared and ready for the moment and what God does it God baptizes him and pours out that burden upon him and so uses him that he saves Israel from from from Annihilation because Ezra was where he needed to be and at are we holding back God from moving because we are not where we need to be because God has to use someone and once he has a group of people who are honest looking at at themselves sincerely crying unto the name of the lord it's only a matter of time for God to start moving we must have love before we can have faith when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith out on the Battlefront for God genuine Godly love for God and for his word and for his people will push Faith out there love just takes a the hold of faith and just come on let's go and out it goes because that's what love does and when you and when when that happens there's there's there's nothing that can stand against it nothing so as bad as any situation can get in a home in a church at your work whatever it may be relationships friendships whatever it may be if we can get to a place where we can do it through love and you're working by faith then God can use you to change that situation because God is just crying he's crying out for you to be used so all God needs in any impossible situation is one desperate praying person the effectual fervent what does fervent mean burning hot strong longlasting ing continual the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much you have no idea what the power of your prayer can do no idea I've had situation after it's been a bad week for work and Monday it just it was immediate one email from a client okay what is this and immediately I put my head down and pray just Lord you you know what needs to be done here me you take over and me you settle it within 3 hours it was settled we were going to get paid it was and the relationship was fine and got to go over cuz when you're a Son of God with a token on display in your home you have full rights full dominion over Everything You Touch full rights and Satan knows it and the moment that you start knowing that is when he has no control over you anymore but you got to be you got to know who you are and you got to be where you need to be you got to be
