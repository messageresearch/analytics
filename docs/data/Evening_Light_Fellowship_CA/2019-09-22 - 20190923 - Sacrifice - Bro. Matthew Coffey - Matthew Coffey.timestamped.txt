[29:00] [Music]
[29:05] we can just pray our dear gracious
[29:09] Heavenly Father blow we want to thank
[29:12] you for another opportunity father just

[29:16] regardless to whose up behind your
[29:18] father
[29:18] we're here to come to hear from you lord
[29:21] and I pray Lord that you just flow
[29:23] freely among us father
[29:25] Lorie just take this little thought
[29:27] father and me just filling all the gaps
[29:29] father let me just speak to us Lord and
[29:32] me just be a blessing in some way father
[29:35] lord I pray that your grace just be a
[29:37] pause grace to those couldn't make it
[29:39] father
[29:39] and lord I pray that you just bless us
[29:43] Lord with your presence we long for it
[29:45] Lord in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen
[29:56] if we could turn into our Bibles to
[29:59] Exodus 20
[30:12] so want to take just a little thought
[30:14] there today on sacrifice
[30:18] Virgil and a lot of the other ministers
[30:21] have been hitting a lot different area
[30:24] but it's just a thought I felt to take
[30:27] so over in Exodus 20 would start with
[30:29] thee the start of the natural sacrifice
[30:32] X is 20 verses 20 for an altar of Earth
[30:36] thou shalt make unto me and shall
[30:39] sacrifice there on die burnt offerings
[30:42] and I peace offerings thy sheep and dine
[30:45] oxen in all places where I record my
[30:48] name I will come unto thee and I will
[30:51] bless thee god bless the word you can be
[30:54] seated so don't talk about the natural
[31:06] sacrifice we will need to go back to the
[31:10] first sacrifice which is in Genesis 4 so
[31:14] big turn to Genesis 4 I probably keep
[31:18] your Bibles handy I have a few
[31:20] scriptures here today
[31:32] so Genesis four versus one is it an Adam
[31:37] knew Eve his wife and she conceived and
[31:39] bare Cain and said I've gotten a man
[31:41] from the Lord and she again know when
[31:46] I'm not around Scripture
[31:47] I think nope that's right and she again
[31:53] bare his brother and evil and Abel was a
[31:55] keeper of the sheep but Cain was a
[31:57] tiller of the ground an improv time it
[32:00] came to pass that Cain brought out of
[32:02] the fruit of the ground an offering unto
[32:03] the Lord and Abel he also brought the
[32:07] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[32:09] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[32:11] Abel and to his offering but unto Cain
[32:15] and to his offering he had not respect
[32:17] and Cain was very wroth and his
[32:20] countenance countenance fell this year
[32:23] is the first sacrifice that was made in
[32:26] scripture and we see here that Cain de
[32:29] Abel definitely had a revelation of
[32:31] original sin he knew that blood caused
[32:34] to fall and would take blood to redeem
[32:36] them in butter brown puts it nicely here
[32:40] in victory days had but Abel by
[32:41] spiritual revelation revealed to him
[32:44] that it was not the fruit of the field
[32:46] that caused the death it was blood that
[32:48] caused the death so he offered back
[32:50] blood of an innocent substitute and God
[32:53] accepted it and that has been God's
[32:55] propitiation for our sins
[32:57] ever since that very day no other way
[33:00] because if he had accepted on any other
[33:02] basis then we'd have Chaya had to come
[33:05] to that basis to find favor with God but
[33:08] God only accepted only the innocent
[33:10] blood of an innocent subject so we see
[33:16] here even in a very beginning there's
[33:18] very distinct line a true sacrifice back
[33:23] here is bloody it was messy and even in
[33:27] ourselves as we proceed forward and get
[33:29] closer to God we must also die two
[33:31] things and it can be messy at times and
[33:35] over numbers 15 and he says a few
[33:39] scriptures here but they're trying to
[33:41] set it
[33:42] a direction here I said in numbers fifth
[33:53] verse three and we'll make an offering
[33:57] by fire unto the Lord a burnt offering
[34:00] or an up sacrifice in performing a vow
[34:03] or in a free will offering or in your
[34:06] solemn feast to make a sweet savour unto
[34:09] the Lord of the herd of the flock and in
[34:12] Deuteronomy don't need to term if you
[34:14] want to is don't Deuteronomy 12 verse 11
[34:17] then there shall be a place which the
[34:19] Lord your God shall choose to cause his
[34:22] name to dwell there therefore shall you
[34:26] bring all that I command you your burnt
[34:28] offerings your sacrifices your tithes
[34:31] and the heave offering of your hand and
[34:34] all your choice vows would you vow unto
[34:36] God so this is pretty inclusive if God
[34:41] the place where he choose to dwell you
[34:44] should bring everything from there
[34:45] sacrifices to your tithes to your vows
[34:48] scripture is very clear especially under
[34:51] and on the point of vows if you make a
[34:53] value must keep it it must be very
[34:55] fervent and diligent to keep this vow
[34:58] but to think about what making a
[35:01] sacrifice in Leviticus 22 verse 29 Moses
[35:08] says and when you will offer a sacrifice
[35:12] of Thanksgiving unto the Lord offer it
[35:15] of your own free will
[35:17] it has to be of an old free will you
[35:20] can't be doing this begrudgingly
[35:22] everything Christ has done for us wasn't
[35:25] done begrudgingly he just didn't do it
[35:28] out of convenience he did it out of love
[35:30] and it behooves us to do it any other
[35:33] way back to him in 1st Kings 17 and
[35:42] verse 36
[35:50] we read here said but the Lord who
[35:55] brought you up out of the land of Egypt
[35:58] with great power and a stretched out arm
[36:02] they had no they did nothing to get out
[36:04] of Egypt this was all God purely God
[36:07] he's with great power and a stretched
[36:10] out arm him shall you fear and him shall
[36:13] you worship and to him shall you do
[36:15] sacrifice this is all of God even in the
[36:21] Old Testament under the Levitical
[36:23] priesthood and a mosaic lot oh it was
[36:26] very much still God and we need to be
[36:29] willing sanctified vessels to go with
[36:32] the will of God this has nothing to do
[36:34] with us if you look at Abraham I just
[36:38] going to paraphrase some of this in
[36:40] Genesis 15 18 to 21 we read of when God
[36:44] made the first covenant when he made a
[36:46] covenant with Abraham and he told
[36:48] Abraham you this would be your seed you
[36:52] will have a son and here I was like well
[36:53] how can I be sure so God told to go take
[36:57] a heifer and different Creek birds and
[36:59] that and you set your sacrifice up he
[37:02] said and I will pass through so Abraham
[37:06] he went he prepared to sacrifice built
[37:07] the altars prepared the animals caught
[37:10] him and to he had everything already
[37:12] but God didn't show up right away it
[37:15] says here in scripture that abraham
[37:16] spent a good portion of the day keeping
[37:19] the birds from getting at the carcasses
[37:21] and it wasn't till the evening time when
[37:24] he was wore out and tired that God
[37:27] caused him to fall asleep and then God
[37:30] passed through the sacrifice had nothing
[37:32] to do with Abraham it was all God that
[37:35] Covenant was purely God Abraham was just
[37:38] along for the ride he tried everything
[37:42] to preserve and set up the sacrifice but
[37:45] in the end it was God that did
[37:47] everything he also moved forward into
[37:50] Genesis 22 where he already had a son
[37:53] Isaac
[37:54] he saw the fulfillment of that covenant
[37:57] and then God says to him take your son
[38:00] and go and go off from
[38:03] rifice so once again abraham has to go
[38:06] and prepare to sacrifice only this time
[38:08] it's his only son he had to go through a
[38:11] lot of fights and trials to get to this
[38:13] point and now he's been asked to give it
[38:15] up but what's interesting is even I'm
[38:18] sure you're all familiar when they get
[38:21] to the mountain his servants asked him
[38:24] you're worth the sacrifice he said don't
[38:25] worry said I and the lad will return
[38:27] even then he knew that if he did
[38:30] sacrifice and kill his son gob was
[38:32] obligated to raise him up in fulfillment
[38:35] of that covenant
[38:38] so even God let him go right to the
[38:40] point where he he was about to kill him
[38:42] and he stopped him said now I know that
[38:44] you love me and he provided a sacrifice
[38:47] he still trusted right to the end there
[38:50] was no hesitation in Abraham and we must
[38:54] be like that even in ourselves when we
[38:56] come to God or he asked us to do
[38:58] something we must trust in the God who
[39:01] has made a covenant with us if you look
[39:05] in in the Old Testament a lot of times
[39:08] when God moves in someone's life when
[39:12] something is done they have to have a
[39:14] date there is a sacrifice you look at
[39:17] job after everything he went through
[39:19] even his friends God told him go get a
[39:22] job to pray for you but job didn't get
[39:26] healed until he prayed for them and then
[39:30] he offered a sacrifice you look at Jacob
[39:33] Jacob when he wrestled with the angel he
[39:36] wrestled all night but then after he won
[39:38] his victory he went in offered a
[39:41] sacrifice you look at Samson even in his
[39:45] death he offered something he sacrificed
[39:48] something he said let me die
[39:50] and then God moved on the scene brother
[39:53] Paul really brought out well on Hannah
[39:55] in the temple again she warned her son
[39:58] but she had to sacrifice him back to God
[40:00] and then God moved on the scene God put
[40:03] all these people through different
[40:05] struggles to get him to a point where
[40:07] they could say okay lord I give myself
[40:10] to you whatever it is you're going to do
[40:12] it's going to go back to the service of
[40:14] the kingdom
[40:15] even John in the belly once he reached
[40:18] that point then he said I will offer
[40:20] sacrifice of Thanksgiving and paid the
[40:22] vows and then God moved on the scene and
[40:24] spit him out online it's that way even
[40:27] in our lives now this was all under the
[40:32] natural blood of a lamb but let's see if
[40:37] we can bring it forward into the New
[40:38] Testament thing but Abram says here in I
[40:41] will restore he said did you ever hear
[40:43] our lamb dying why is the most pathetic
[40:45] thing you ever heard is to hear a little
[40:48] lamb dying enabled with his head pulled
[40:51] back chopped on his little throat like
[40:52] that and the blood just squirting all
[40:54] over the rock on overs hands his little
[40:57] white wool being bathed God looked down
[40:58] and said that's it
[41:00] hallelujah that's is what did I speak of
[41:03] the Lamb of God being led away with hemp
[41:06] rope around his neck two or four
[41:09] thousand years later they're on the
[41:11] cross with mockeries spits as bloody
[41:13] locks dripped all around the shoulders
[41:15] bleeding bleeding speaking in other
[41:18] tongues when he was dying yonder could
[41:21] able understand his lambs voice no sir
[41:24] but he notice voice but he didn't know
[41:27] his language so when he was speaking in
[41:29] tongues at the cross when he was dying
[41:31] he was God's lamb slain from the
[41:33] foundation of the world for lost
[41:35] sinner's remember Abel died on the same
[41:39] Rock his lamb died on and every man that
[41:42] comes to Jesus Christ man or woman boy
[41:44] or girl has got to die on the same
[41:46] Calvary that Jesus died on
[41:49] self-sacrifice laying on that Rock of
[41:52] Ages sacrificing themselves their own
[41:55] ideas their theories and everything and
[41:58] giving fully over to the Holy Spirit
[42:00] certainly that's it once again we see
[42:04] the true sacrifice is a messy thing in
[42:09] order to butter Joe has here summary
[42:12] said man sees what we do but God sees
[42:14] why we do it when you were truly dying
[42:17] to something you'd better be sure we're
[42:19] doing it with the right motive and the
[42:20] right objective because again God sees
[42:24] why we do it
[42:26] back to Hana and analyzing sawara
[42:29] another example that man saw what they
[42:33] did and thought it was wonderful but God
[42:35] saw the heart and it wasn't the truth
[42:37] sacrifice thence judgment struck in
[42:44] Hebrews in Hebrews 10 6 he says in burnt
[42:49] offerings and sacrifices for sin thou
[42:51] has no pleasure here he's Paul is
[42:55] talking about the change from the Old
[42:57] Testament under Levitical priesthood
[42:59] over into the New Testament there's a
[43:03] dispensation or change and he's saying
[43:05] we don't need offer sacrifices every
[43:07] year as a temporary solution for our
[43:10] sins is that the perfect sacrifice is
[43:12] being made so now you can forget that
[43:16] that is decreased in value what is the
[43:19] higher value now is the perfect
[43:22] sacrifice which is Jesus Christ and this
[43:25] is where he's trying to say like you no
[43:27] longer required the blood of animals and
[43:28] bulls and goats he said but now you need
[43:31] to go to Christ this is the sacrifice
[43:33] and he said what hast thou done the
[43:35] voice yeah we have the you no longer
[43:43] required the blood of animals also he
[43:48] says here but around brings out about
[43:51] the blood what a sacrifice there was a
[43:54] lot of blood and just as I said a mess
[43:57] but the blood speaks over in Genesis
[44:01] 4:10 he says where has that done the
[44:03] voice of thy brother's blood cries out
[44:04] unto me from the ground Abel's blood had
[44:07] representation before Christ same with
[44:11] our blood it's not the chemistry of the
[44:14] blood or anything it's the life in the
[44:16] blood that has we have representation
[44:19] Scripps pastor tells us that the blood
[44:23] speaks can it speak the token speaks yes
[44:28] sir
[44:28] if we look in Genesis 4 the voice of the
[44:30] blood of abel cried out against Cain and
[44:32] we find in Hebrews 12 24 that the blood
[44:36] of Jesus Christ speaks of better things
[44:39] once again referring back to the burnt
[44:41] offerings from the old sacrifice to the
[44:43] supreme sacrifice the blood of Jesus
[44:46] Christ speaks better things to blood
[44:48] speaks it's the life in the blood that
[44:50] does the speaking spoiled a soul that
[44:53] was enable it was the life that was in
[44:55] Christ that cries out better things than
[44:57] any it speaks loud it's the Holy Spirit
[45:01] it speaks plain he tells us that the
[45:04] time is here when we see it for it said
[45:06] it would say it and then we see it come
[45:09] back and identify what I said there's
[45:11] nothing else left to believe it that's
[45:13] right receive it believe for self and
[45:16] applying the token move out some people
[45:19] want to apply the blood and stay in you
[45:23] apply the blood and kick all the trash
[45:25] out and have a house cleaning time
[45:27] sacrifice there's things in our lives
[45:30] that we need to get clear of things we
[45:33] don't even know sometimes but even if we
[45:37] go back to in Sandler's time when the
[45:39] saw went and he was told to kill all the
[45:41] enemy and he didn't he brought them back
[45:44] and had a big sacrifice Samuel said hath
[45:47] the Lord our great delight in burnt
[45:48] offerings and sacrifice as in obeying
[45:51] the voice of the Lord behold to obey is
[45:54] better than to sacrifice and to hearken
[45:56] than the fat of rams I pray that there
[46:01] will be our desires that we would obey
[46:03] and hearken unto God's voice if he's
[46:06] working on our lives we better listen if
[46:08] he's trying to root out some something
[46:10] we better say Lord here am I do to me as
[46:16] the scripture says can the Potter say to
[46:17] the master why have you made me thus
[46:20] it's up to him how he wants to mold us
[46:22] it has nothing to do with what I want in
[46:26] 1st Peter 2:5 he said you also as a
[46:30] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[46:33] house an holy priesthood to offer up
[46:36] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[46:41] by Jesus Christ so we are to offer up
[46:44] spiritual sacrifices well what are some
[46:46] things that we gotta sacrifice in our
[46:47] lives
[46:48] well for some it might be our ideas we
[46:52] might think well we
[46:52] we understand this scripture better than
[46:54] anyone else oh maybe not we gotta
[46:57] sacrifice their own opinions our opinion
[47:01] means nothing
[47:02] what matters is what God says pride
[47:07] there's a lot of pride mentioned in
[47:08] Scripture we have a lot of pride in
[47:11] ourselves sometimes we're proud because
[47:13] we go to this church we're part of the
[47:16] message we understand Scriptures better
[47:18] than others but again who gets the glory
[47:22] me or God we must die the pride we must
[47:25] sacrifice stubbornness there's another
[47:27] big one and unnecessary talk about
[47:29] stubbornness when you trying to solve a
[47:31] problem at work there's a stubbornness
[47:33] where you think you're a little bit
[47:36] above 4 you got something better than
[47:37] someone stubbornness says in Lord I know
[47:39] you want me to do this well you can get
[47:42] yourself in trouble like Balak we must
[47:47] humble ourselves and if the scripture
[47:52] says stubbornness is as our dolla tree
[47:54] we don't want that idolatry means that
[47:58] there's something above Christ there is
[48:00] nothing higher than Christ so for God's
[48:04] grace I pray that we were just humble
[48:05] humble ourselves scripture says home
[48:08] with ourselves unto the mighty hand of
[48:09] God and in due time he will exalt you
[48:11] we'll just leave that with the Lord even
[48:15] our will I want to go here for a
[48:17] vacation well is that the Lord's will
[48:20] for your life I want to work here I want
[48:23] to wait make this much money I want to
[48:24] get married at this point in time go
[48:26] over here for college that's all up to
[48:29] God again God as brother Joel said many
[48:31] times he might want you to be a janitor
[48:33] instead of an engineer he might want you
[48:36] to have a dozen kids instead of two
[48:38] that's God's decision again we have to
[48:42] let God decide what is right for us our
[48:46] ambitions same thing tied with our will
[48:50] we must die to that relations our
[48:54] spouses a kids family unbelieving family
[49:00] again we must sacrifice that to God
[49:03] sometimes these can be a hindrance to us
[49:05] well I'm afraid I might hurt their
[49:07] feelings I'd rather hurt their feelings
[49:10] than hurt God's eye so again we must
[49:13] sacrifice that Matthew 12 speaks dead
[49:15] very plainly over Matthew 12 Matthew 12
[49:33] verse 46 and says while he had talked
[49:37] with the people behold his mother and
[49:40] his brethren stood without desiring to
[49:42] speak with him you're familiar with this
[49:44] and then one said him behold I have
[49:46] mother and life brethren stand without
[49:48] desiring to speak with thee in verse 38
[49:50] he said but he answered and said unto
[49:52] him that told him who is my mother and
[49:54] who are my brethren he stretched forth
[49:57] his hand toward his disciples and said
[49:58] Behold my mother and my brethren for
[50:01] whosoever shall do the will of my father
[50:02] which is in heaven the same is my
[50:05] brother and my sister and my mother he
[50:09] had sold out and died out to his family
[50:11] I'm sure they were a bit offended when
[50:13] he said that and he didn't any refuse to
[50:16] talk to him at that time we must do the
[50:20] same
[50:20] here's an example that's lived before us
[50:22] I know family can be a trap sometimes
[50:24] but again we must sacrifice it our
[50:29] possession our possessions some of us
[50:32] take pride in how much we have really it
[50:36] are we able to truly sing that song at
[50:39] enter a cottage why should I care that
[50:42] do we really care or we just sing in
[50:44] words do we want the big houses to fancy
[50:47] vehicles you look at the rich young
[50:51] ruler Jesus told him one thing he lacked
[50:54] that's it I'm sure I lack a whole lot
[50:57] more than one thing but that's all he
[51:00] lacked and that was his possessions and
[51:02] he wasn't willing to give it up and look
[51:05] where he ended up in hell what injustice
[51:08] a sip of water he didn't give up he
[51:12] didn't sacrifice his possessions
[51:15] time time is another thing that we need
[51:19] to redeem in sacrifice you even just
[51:24] take I'll just take me for instance I
[51:26] spend about nine ten hours a day at work
[51:30] 78 hours a night sleeping so right away
[51:33] I'm up to 18 hours out of 24 I want to
[51:36] get six hours and in the middle of that
[51:38] I got do my other things spend time to
[51:40] family eat so at the end of that I might
[51:43] have an hour left for God out of 24 it's
[51:46] a pretty low percentage so what can I do
[51:49] to sacrifice more time to redeem more
[51:51] time to spend it with him yes I know we
[51:54] got to live in this world but sometimes
[51:57] living in this world involves maybe
[51:59] entertainment or something that takes us
[52:02] away from God as opposed to spending in
[52:04] his presence takes us away from
[52:05] fellowship with one another these are
[52:08] things that have a higher value in God's
[52:10] eyes then in ours past regrets sometimes
[52:17] that there are things that we don't
[52:19] realize that are hindering us they build
[52:22] up complexes in us we must sacrifice
[52:25] these things pray that God would reveal
[52:27] these things to us and that we would go
[52:30] and make these things right better bow I
[52:33] forget now that hopefully st. I you you
[52:36] stubbornness but you can use a lot of
[52:38] these things he said well this is in my
[52:40] past how do I get clear of it he said
[52:43] you go to the author laid before God and
[52:46] walk away don't hold onto it so tightly
[52:49] then when you walk away you're taking it
[52:50] back with you let go leave it turn your
[52:54] back on it when you turn your back on it
[52:56] that means you lose sight of it that's
[52:59] what you got to do when you sacrifice
[53:01] any of these things ourselves there's
[53:05] the biggest hindrance between us and God
[53:08] as ourselves as been said before people
[53:12] will miss heaven by 18 inches to
[53:14] distance between your head and your
[53:15] heart so we must sacrifice that distance
[53:20] everything that stands between us and
[53:22] God a lot of times these our own
[53:23] thinking there's more ideas
[53:26] all these things that were just listed
[53:27] I'm sure there's many more that we could
[53:29] add to this list namekian says he showed
[53:36] the old man what is good but what does
[53:37] Lord require thee but to do justly to
[53:40] love mercy and walk humbly with thy God
[53:43] all these things aren't necessarily
[53:45] humble things ambition is not
[53:47] necessarily a humble attribute we must
[53:50] sacrifice to these things die out
[53:52] forsake it completely lose sight of it
[53:56] if we could turn to Psalms 51
[54:20] Sam's 51 we'll just back up to verse 15
[54:24] he said Oh Lord open down my lips and my
[54:28] mouth shall show forth thy praise for
[54:31] thou desirous not sacrifices else would
[54:33] I give it now delight is not in burnt
[54:36] offerings the sacrifices of God are a
[54:39] broken spirit a broken and a contrite
[54:42] heart O God thou wilt not despise this
[54:47] here is everything in a nutshell
[54:50] humility humble thyself a broken heart
[54:54] that's basically what a broken spirit
[54:56] and a contrite heart is humility with
[54:59] God humble yourselves if you do this it
[55:05] will be well with you God will not
[55:08] dispose it will not reject this
[55:09] sacrifice the more you desire to fall in
[55:12] line with this sacrifice the greater
[55:15] God's movement in your life will be God
[55:18] will move in such ways that you won't
[55:19] even know you'll be surprised in Romans
[55:25] 12 he says I beseech you therefore
[55:26] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[55:28] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[55:30] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[55:35] reasonable service and like you also to
[55:41] turn to Mark Twain under 12 few minutes
[55:44] here on this is over in mark 9
[55:54] and in mark 9 near the end I said 42 to
[55:59] the end of the chapter
[56:00] this here is titled that has a warning
[56:01] about Hell here he also talks about like
[56:08] if thy foot offend thee cut it off
[56:10] if the hand off and he cut it off this
[56:13] is the context of the scripture so if
[56:17] you go down to verse 49 of Mark 9 he
[56:22] said for every one shall be salted with
[56:24] fire and every sacrifice shall be salted
[56:27] with salt salt is good but at the salt
[56:31] hath losses saltness wherewith will you
[56:33] season it have you have salt in
[56:36] yourselves and have peace one with
[56:39] another this is kind of a strange
[56:42] scripture all of a sudden we talk about
[56:44] held in to bring out about salt and in
[56:47] that assault of a sacrifice shall be
[56:51] salted with salt according to the law
[56:54] under Moses a sacrifice was to be salted
[56:58] but this wasn't necessarily for a
[57:01] preservation because once this offering
[57:03] was salted then it was burnt so the idea
[57:08] of a salt being a preservative is not
[57:10] entirely accurate if you read or in the
[57:14] biggest in Leviticus 2 he explains just
[57:16] putting the salt on all the sacraments
[57:18] especially the meat offering the nature
[57:21] of a man has been called flesh and in a
[57:23] lot of times in Scripture flesh refers
[57:25] to the meat and it must be salted in
[57:28] order to be a sacrifice unto God as we
[57:31] just read in Romans 12:1 a living
[57:33] sacrifice so we must have in our souls
[57:37] the savour of grace which is sanctified
[57:40] by the Holy Ghost this is the saltiness
[57:46] Matthew Henry really brings out really
[57:49] well he said those that had the salt of
[57:51] grace must make it appear that they have
[57:54] that if salt in themselves a living
[57:56] principle of grace in their hearts which
[57:58] works out all corrupt dispositions and
[58:01] everything in the soul that tends to
[58:04] putrefaction and would offend our God as
[58:08] unsavoury meat doth our speech must
[58:11] always be with grace seasoned with this
[58:14] salt that no corrupt communication will
[58:17] proceed out of our mouth but that we
[58:19] would love it as much as we were put in
[58:21] putrid mouths in our mouth putrid meat
[58:24] in our mouth as this gracious salt will
[58:27] keep our own conscious void of offense
[58:29] so it will keep our conversations with
[58:31] others so that we would not offend any
[58:34] of Christ's little ones but may be at
[58:37] peace with one another we must not only
[58:40] have this salt of grace but we must
[58:43] always retain the relish and savor of it
[58:46] for if this salt loses its saltiness if
[58:49] a Christian revolt from his Christianity
[58:52] if you step out from underneath the
[58:54] umbrella of God's grace he loses the
[58:58] savour of it and no longer under to him
[59:00] power or the influence of it
[59:02] what can recover him aware with will ye
[59:05] season him as this is said in Matthew 5
[59:08] as an also another example is of a lease
[59:13] on his birthright well he gave his up
[59:16] his birth weight the scripture says that
[59:19] he saw forth and he couldn't find it he
[59:22] wanted it back but he had give stepped
[59:24] out from underneath that covenant of the
[59:26] birthright it was no longer there for so
[59:30] we must have this and stay underneath
[59:32] this covenant and underneath his
[59:34] saltness those that present not
[59:37] themselves living sacrifices to God's
[59:39] grace shall be made for ever dying
[59:42] sacrifices to his justice they would not
[59:49] submit admit that to subdue the corrupt
[59:51] affections they would not submit to the
[59:53] operation they could not bear the
[59:56] corrosives
[59:57] that were necessary to eat out the proud
[59:59] flesh here is referring to solve as
[1:00:02] being a corrosive element salts and when
[1:00:07] you bring in water and air it is highly
[1:00:09] corrosive
[1:00:10] when you applied to meet and leave it it
[1:00:14] will eat up the fatty parts between me
[1:00:15] and make it nice and tender any
[1:00:19] on the steps away from Christ they can't
[1:00:22] stand this corrosiveness to them it is
[1:00:26] like cutting off a hand or plucking out
[1:00:28] an eye and therefore in hell as it go
[1:00:32] back to scripture here he says they will
[1:00:33] be salted with fire over in Ezekiel
[1:00:36] talks about the spring king of fire
[1:00:38] sprinkling of coals on the city and here
[1:00:43] is referring to base of your time in
[1:00:45] Hell you have a choice
[1:00:49] assault is a corrosive preservative in
[1:00:52] its natural context if we apply this to
[1:00:59] our spiritual lives salt is it would be
[1:01:05] used to eat out anything that is not
[1:01:07] christ-like we see the statue of a
[1:01:10] perfect man anything that is not here is
[1:01:13] not of Christ so as this we make our
[1:01:16] sacrifice and in this context as the
[1:01:18] salt sacrifice it is eating out anything
[1:01:22] that is not in line with the stature of
[1:01:23] a perfect man
[1:01:24] only thing that stands and will not be
[1:01:26] rusted or corroded is that which is
[1:01:29] Christ and the preservative portion of
[1:01:34] it means that this is an everlasting
[1:01:35] covenant I'd rather take the cross of
[1:01:39] knitting that corrosiveness now and burn
[1:01:42] and burn everything out now tend to burn
[1:01:45] eternally later that's basically what
[1:01:49] this is saying here take a bit of salt
[1:01:52] now in salt in the wounds now it will
[1:01:55] heal you eventually rather than to be
[1:01:57] burnt later join all this process we
[1:02:02] must have a right attitude again at back
[1:02:05] to today's kiss he must offer the
[1:02:07] sacrifice willingly he must have the
[1:02:10] right motive and objective as Pedrosa
[1:02:12] been preaching lot lately
[1:02:13] you can't just go about this well maybe
[1:02:17] Lord I had this problem maybe you can
[1:02:19] take care of funny thing is sometimes
[1:02:22] when we want healing we get very
[1:02:24] specific but let me ask for forgiveness
[1:02:27] so for something to be taken out of our
[1:02:29] lives we kind of just throw a blanket
[1:02:31] over and say lord if this may be
[1:02:33] this now be specific to if you see
[1:02:37] something your live as scripture says in
[1:02:39] the communion scripture to examine
[1:02:41] ourselves if we see something that is
[1:02:43] wrong a specific that Lord take carry if
[1:02:47] not God will put you through a lot of
[1:02:49] trials to force you to there's a point
[1:02:52] where you will have to ask for and be a
[1:02:55] lot easier if we examine ourselves in
[1:02:58] light of Scripture and bring it to the
[1:03:02] Lord
[1:03:03] sacrifice it now and when it comes to
[1:03:10] attitude is it's not necessarily our
[1:03:14] sincerity trying to find another world
[1:03:17] but I'm just gonna go with sincerity but
[1:03:18] BAM says sit here and sincerity isn't
[1:03:20] what God requires sincerity is alright
[1:03:23] but that's not enough perhaps tonight if
[1:03:26] we go down into the Ganga's River watch
[1:03:29] those mothers with the little black
[1:03:30] babies sticking them into the alligators
[1:03:32] and squish them to death in their mouths
[1:03:34] sacrificing to the God that sincerity
[1:03:36] what if you follow me to India and see
[1:03:39] those people pull off their shoes walk
[1:03:41] through the fire feet burning blisters
[1:03:43] or go to China and find their little
[1:03:46] feet broke up like that and walking on
[1:03:48] their toes how they make sacrifices and
[1:03:50] everything very deeply sincere but still
[1:03:53] that's not salvation sincerity has
[1:03:57] nothing to do with it
[1:03:58] many times the heathens who cut
[1:04:00] themselves and lanced themselves and
[1:04:02] wait deeper than anything you ever seen
[1:04:04] acted in Christianity what Christians
[1:04:07] will hardly walk across the street to a
[1:04:09] revival that's right but people will do
[1:04:12] anything even sacrificing their children
[1:04:15] to their lives but that's it sincerely
[1:04:18] doesn't spell it there's a way that
[1:04:21] seemeth right unto a man but the way end
[1:04:23] thereof is the way of death it behooves
[1:04:27] us to check up now to find out where
[1:04:29] we're standing we're in the end time no
[1:04:33] time for plane it's time now to get
[1:04:35] right and to be sure that you're right
[1:04:39] it's a continual checking don't just
[1:04:43] check today so I'm good and in five
[1:04:46] years time maybe I should check again
[1:04:48] no as parameter settings many times he
[1:04:52] said I sin every day and repent every
[1:04:53] night this is a continual process a lot
[1:04:58] of times you had to give birth
[1:04:58] experience before you even died or
[1:05:00] something
[1:05:01] why do you die to today or you sacrifice
[1:05:04] today you could party couldn't of
[1:05:07] sacrifice 5 10 years ago it's a
[1:05:10] continual process but we must have the
[1:05:13] right attitude join all this to be able
[1:05:15] to accept us no matter what the outcome
[1:05:18] is no matter what we have the give we
[1:05:20] have to have the right attitude but a
[1:05:25] brand brings out on a blind Bartimaeus I
[1:05:28] was really blessed by this the contact
[1:05:31] series his daughter got sick and he
[1:05:35] prayed that God would heal her and if he
[1:05:38] is healer he would give his two
[1:05:40] turtledoves as a sacrifice to God is it
[1:05:45] the next morning little girl was well so
[1:05:47] he took two turtledoves and offered them
[1:05:49] up and a week later his wife took sick
[1:05:52] there was nothing could be done for her
[1:05:54] he said isn't it strange how tragedies
[1:05:57] hit families of believers and so it's
[1:06:00] all for good they went up and he went
[1:06:02] out to pray if that night he said Lord I
[1:06:04] haven't got my doves now my begging is
[1:06:07] getting poorly because there's nothing
[1:06:09] to attract attention I haven't got
[1:06:11] nothing in the world to offer you but my
[1:06:13] lamb but if you'll just let my poor dear
[1:06:15] wife get well I'll give you my lamb and
[1:06:20] he went back to the house feeling his
[1:06:22] way around and the next morning his wife
[1:06:23] got well so it was a beautiful morning
[1:06:26] and he started up the street that I am
[1:06:27] leading him on the hut and the high
[1:06:30] priest stood up on the top on the
[1:06:32] banister of the balcony of the temple
[1:06:34] and he said we're girls now blind
[1:06:36] bartimaeus he said all high priests I'm
[1:06:38] going into the sacrifice room I promised
[1:06:41] God if he'd heal my wife last night I
[1:06:43] give him my lamb they said all blind
[1:06:46] bartimaeus you can't give that lamb I'll
[1:06:48] give you a sacrifice our money to buy
[1:06:50] you a lamb
[1:06:51] off at the stalls the very place where
[1:06:54] Jesus beat them out later he said I'll
[1:06:56] give you the money to buy them they said
[1:06:59] all high priests God's blessings be upon
[1:07:01] you but he said I never promised God a
[1:07:04] lamb I promised him this lamb that's
[1:07:08] right that's where it is what are you
[1:07:12] afraid about you want the world to be
[1:07:14] Christianized but you're afraid of the
[1:07:15] Holy Spirit see what about you are we
[1:07:19] afraid to let the Holy Spirit to dig
[1:07:21] around in our lives are we so afraid to
[1:07:23] let him dig around our past door to our
[1:07:26] private lives let's check our attitudes
[1:07:29] here and let Jesus in there's so many
[1:07:32] blessings to come out on the other side
[1:07:34] he said blind bartimaeus you cannot give
[1:07:37] that lamb that lamb is your eyes you
[1:07:41] ain't got no eyes but that lamb
[1:07:43] bartimaeus and you've trained that lamb
[1:07:45] to lead you
[1:07:46] he said that lamb is your eyes it pulls
[1:07:48] you around you ain't got no eyes but for
[1:07:50] that and he said he raised his feeble
[1:07:53] hands and he said o High Priest God will
[1:07:56] provide a lamb for blind bartimaeus his
[1:07:58] eyes and he offered the sacrifice he had
[1:08:02] made a vow and he kept it no matter the
[1:08:05] consequences he gave up every last bit
[1:08:07] of sight he had a maneuver in the world
[1:08:09] he had nothing else
[1:08:11] he was totally dependent upon God he
[1:08:16] dare no idea what was going to happen to
[1:08:18] him he lived his life as a beggar I'm
[1:08:21] sure he was a good one he provided here
[1:08:23] scripture says he had a wife kids
[1:08:25] he probably provided as best he could
[1:08:27] but it was based on that lamb getting
[1:08:30] them to him from the prime locations for
[1:08:32] begging but Harry sacrificed all that
[1:08:35] his ability to provide cut off he
[1:08:40] continues by saying one corner member
[1:08:42] day he's sitting there chilling in the
[1:08:44] wind and he heard a noise what was it
[1:08:48] God had provided a lamb for blind
[1:08:51] Bartimaeus his eyes that's right
[1:08:53] God got that same land provided this
[1:08:56] afternoon for everyone sitting here he's
[1:08:58] got a lamb provided for everyone who and
[1:09:00] he's here to give it to you and he will
[1:09:02] give you the power of his
[1:09:05] they just do exactly what we've asked
[1:09:08] him to do when in our journey God has
[1:09:11] his land provided the rocks already been
[1:09:13] smitten the waters are flowing freely he
[1:09:16] just had the drinkers in Ephesians he
[1:09:22] says is that a walk in love as Christ
[1:09:24] also have loved us and hath given
[1:09:26] himself for an offering and a sacrifice
[1:09:28] to God for a sweet-smelling savour God
[1:09:33] has already paid everything he's already
[1:09:35] given a sacrifice why do we hesitate at
[1:09:38] times to give up something that is
[1:09:40] contrary to him what do we want to give
[1:09:43] up hold so dearly on the things that
[1:09:45] stand between us and perfect communion
[1:09:47] with him as we see things ramping up in
[1:09:50] this world we should be ramping up our
[1:09:52] walk with Christ we should really be
[1:09:54] getting digging deep getting close a lot
[1:09:58] of a lot of times we concentrate on
[1:10:01] doctrines we need us I thank the Lord
[1:10:03] for but we forget to simpler things or
[1:10:06] walk with Christ our life even even
[1:10:11] sometimes forget about others even in
[1:10:15] Philippians Paul says but I have all and
[1:10:17] abound I am full having received of the
[1:10:20] Pafford itis the things which you sent
[1:10:22] from me an older of a sweet smell a
[1:10:26] sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to
[1:10:29] God so this is not even just about
[1:10:31] ourselves we also have to look to others
[1:10:34] sacrifice for them even give him
[1:10:37] something like even here they must have
[1:10:39] sent some things to all that he needed
[1:10:41] maybe it was just a cloak to keep more
[1:10:44] but he said it is a sweet smell a
[1:10:47] sacrifice acceptable and well pleasing
[1:10:49] to God we can't be afraid we can't
[1:10:52] forget those around us they're there to
[1:10:55] help us as well we're in this together
[1:10:59] Christ gave us all for us why do we
[1:11:02] hesitate to give our all to him and that
[1:11:05] means helping others this is a unit we
[1:11:08] go together as description you know as I
[1:11:12] said
[1:11:13] or jointly fit together that means your
[1:11:16] other fingers not over there and you
[1:11:17] pick them up when you need it no it's
[1:11:19] joined together with the hand everything
[1:11:21] functions together it has a purpose but
[1:11:25] you need the elbow in order to move the
[1:11:27] wrist to lift something you need the
[1:11:30] head to control everything you need the
[1:11:31] neck to hold the head up everything
[1:11:33] works just right for then must he often
[1:11:40] have suffered since the foundation of
[1:11:42] the world but now once in the end of the
[1:11:44] world
[1:11:45] he hath he appeared to put away sin by
[1:11:48] the sacrifice of himself to whom much is
[1:11:53] given much is required we've heard this
[1:11:56] many times we were given all so much
[1:12:00] grace but we must also give all so much
[1:12:03] grace too many times be sorry we measure
[1:12:07] sacrifice by how convenient it is that's
[1:12:12] not true sacrifice sacrifice is when is
[1:12:15] not convenient it wasn't convenient for
[1:12:19] Jesus to be tortured and killed that I
[1:12:22] can assure you but he did it for you and
[1:12:24] me it wasn't convenient for those in
[1:12:28] Hebrews 11 the faith chapter who
[1:12:30] suffered greatly
[1:12:31] the scripture says those of whom the
[1:12:33] world wasn't worthy but they gave their
[1:12:36] all but yet we hesitate sometimes to
[1:12:41] save Jesus name out in public we
[1:12:44] hesitate to say thank you Jesus when we
[1:12:46] see God doing something for us on public
[1:12:50] well frayed someone's gonna look down at
[1:12:53] us
[1:12:54] scripture says if you're ashamed of me
[1:12:56] I'll be ashamed of you died of pride
[1:13:00] don't be afraid to speak his name don't
[1:13:04] be afraid to stand out we sing that song
[1:13:09] we sing that song a lot of times as
[1:13:11] you're all on the altar of sacrifice
[1:13:13] late your heart does the spirit control
[1:13:16] can we really sing that these are all on
[1:13:20] the altar God
[1:13:23] provided some better thing for us that
[1:13:25] they without us should not be made
[1:13:27] perfect but we gotta be willing to die
[1:13:31] out to be sold out to sacrifice to
[1:13:34] forsake everything for Christ we must
[1:13:39] have the right attitude even been going
[1:13:41] through these sacrifices and when you go
[1:13:46] through the sacrifice you look at that
[1:13:48] through Scripture the examples the
[1:13:50] blessings that they received once they
[1:13:52] went through the way through hard times
[1:13:54] but afterwards even job what he made
[1:13:56] that sacrifice look at the blessings God
[1:13:58] bestowed upon him just to bring out a
[1:14:00] little bit of self righteousness but he
[1:14:03] had he had more kids more possessions
[1:14:04] I'm sure he wasn't looking for that but
[1:14:08] God said you did so well you conformed
[1:14:10] you sacrifice I'm gonna bless you above
[1:14:12] and beyond in Psalms 27 as he said and
[1:14:19] now shall mine head be lifted up above
[1:14:21] mine enemies round about me therefore
[1:14:24] will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:14:26] sacrifices of joy I will sing yay I will
[1:14:29] sing praises unto the Lord as we died
[1:14:34] out two different things in our lives we
[1:14:41] become a more short in our peace with
[1:14:46] Christ we become paultalks buddies she
[1:14:53] threw as see through a glass darkly but
[1:14:55] as we get closer to Christ more with
[1:14:58] died out more we sell out that no longer
[1:15:00] becomes a dark picture everything comes
[1:15:03] into focus and the more you die out the
[1:15:06] more sharper depth until one day with
[1:15:09] what you see becomes reality
[1:15:13] and he says let my prayer be set forth
[1:15:16] before thee as incense we must pray
[1:15:19] before God pray that he will show these
[1:15:23] things help us to correct areas in our
[1:15:25] lives he said under lifting up of my
[1:15:28] hands as the evening sacrifice
[1:15:32] if you could turn with Jeremiah or to
[1:15:35] Jeremiah 33
[1:15:56] and Jeremiah 33 verse 11 and he says the
[1:16:00] voice of joy and the voice of gladness
[1:16:03] the voice of the bridegroom and the
[1:16:06] voice of the bride the voice of them
[1:16:08] that shall say praise the Lord of Hosts
[1:16:10] for the Lord is good for his mercy
[1:16:13] endureth for ever and of them that shall
[1:16:16] bring the sacrifice of praise into the
[1:16:18] house of the Lord for I will cause to
[1:16:20] return the captivity of the land as at
[1:16:23] the first as at the first saith the Lord
[1:16:29] we're going back to the way it was they
[1:16:33] came from eternity people come back to
[1:16:34] eternity
[1:16:36] but we must even in as we go through the
[1:16:40] sacrifices we also must sacrifice and
[1:16:42] praise God for everything he's done even
[1:16:45] as we go through these trials thank him
[1:16:47] for it is for our perfecting don't go
[1:16:52] through begrudgingly you'll miss out on
[1:16:54] what God's trying to do if you see your
[1:16:57] brother and your sister don't look down
[1:16:59] on to whom much is required
[1:17:02] we're also required to give grace hold
[1:17:05] them up
[1:17:06] pray for don't just don't just say well
[1:17:09] you're just going through something no
[1:17:11] I'm praying for you I'll help you I'll
[1:17:15] step out with you put my shield above
[1:17:17] you put my arm around you lift each
[1:17:20] other up don't care if you're from India
[1:17:23] or Africa or if you're one side of the
[1:17:25] family or not we're all in this together
[1:17:28] going forward into crisis it's a
[1:17:31] regardless of who what the natural
[1:17:33] connection is location or family
[1:17:36] relations is doesn't mean nothing to God
[1:17:42] Hebrews 13 assists by him therefore let
[1:17:45] us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[1:17:47] continually that is the fruit of our
[1:17:51] lips giving thanks to his name but to do
[1:17:55] good and to communicate forget not for
[1:17:58] with such sacrifices God is well pleased
[1:18:02] don't hole up get hold up in yourself
[1:18:06] communicate do good don't forget to do
[1:18:10] these things don't just keep everything
[1:18:13] over here no don't be afraid to talk to
[1:18:15] your brother and your sister Bible says
[1:18:18] confess your faults one to another
[1:18:20] communicate again their prayer might be
[1:18:23] the one thing that releases you from the
[1:18:25] thing - even fighting for so many years
[1:18:27] how do you know talk about it you late
[1:18:32] before God but if God lays it too late
[1:18:34] tell someone else your experience your
[1:18:36] struggle
[1:18:36] don't hesitate die - pride its pride
[1:18:40] that keeps us from talking to each other
[1:18:42] sometimes they say well I'm going
[1:18:45] through this they're gonna look down on
[1:18:46] me know if their Holy Ghost sanctified
[1:18:48] brothers and sisters they will not look
[1:18:51] down they will come and pick you up and
[1:18:53] pray with you
[1:18:54] so you can overcome these areas in your
[1:18:56] lives a lot of times we fight things too
[1:18:59] long because we don't have our brothers
[1:19:01] and sisters praying for us specifically
[1:19:04] don't just say I'll pray for me I'm
[1:19:06] going through something you know anyone
[1:19:09] can say that but to say the golda better
[1:19:13] Dave is saying is it better I'm fighting
[1:19:14] this problem can you pray with me
[1:19:17] I'm sure he'll pray for you go to a
[1:19:20] sister same thing God might be waiting
[1:19:23] on you to do that one thing before you
[1:19:25] get released from something that has
[1:19:27] been bothering you
[1:19:28] you keep struggling and struggling maybe
[1:19:32] it's time to get someone else to help
[1:19:33] pray with you again die just die out the
[1:19:37] pride humble yourself
[1:19:48] over in Hebrews in Hebrews 10
[1:20:13] this might be a bit of reading here but
[1:20:15] I just we got a bit of time here so in
[1:20:21] Hebrews 10 verse 1 he said for the
[1:20:26] shadow have for the law having a shadow
[1:20:28] of good things to come again he's talked
[1:20:32] about things aren't very clear and not
[1:20:34] the very image of the things can never
[1:20:37] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:20:40] year by year continually make the comers
[1:20:42] thereunto perfect
[1:20:44] so again referring back to the Old
[1:20:46] Testament he said under the blood of
[1:20:48] bulls and goats you couldn't really come
[1:20:50] to perfection it was still a cloudy
[1:20:52] picture you can only go so far and no
[1:20:54] further until the perfect sacrifice came
[1:20:59] for them would they not have ceased to
[1:21:01] be offered because the worst was once
[1:21:03] purged should have not have had no more
[1:21:06] conscience of sins but in those
[1:21:09] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[1:21:12] made of the sins every year this is only
[1:21:15] a temporary thing for it is not possible
[1:21:17] that the blood of bulls and goats should
[1:21:19] take away sins wherefore when he cometh
[1:21:21] into the world he said sacrifice and
[1:21:24] offering that what's not but a body has
[1:21:26] not prepared me in burnt offerings and
[1:21:28] sacrifices for sin but ours had no
[1:21:31] pleasure again this is talking about the
[1:21:34] dispensational change then said i lo i
[1:21:37] come in the volume of the book is
[1:21:38] written of me to do thy will o God above
[1:21:42] when he said sacrifices and offerings
[1:21:44] and burnt offerings and offerings for
[1:21:46] sin thou wouldst not neither has
[1:21:49] pleasure therein which are offered by
[1:21:51] the law then said he lo I come to do thy
[1:21:55] will O God and he taketh away the first
[1:21:58] that he may establish the second by the
[1:22:02] which we are will we by the wit will we
[1:22:05] are sanctified through the offering of
[1:22:06] the blood that the body of Jesus Christ
[1:22:08] once for all and every priest standeth
[1:22:12] daily ministering and offering
[1:22:14] oftentimes the same sacrifice can never
[1:22:18] take away sins referring to the
[1:22:21] Levitical priesthood but this man after
[1:22:23] he had offered one sacrifice
[1:22:25] for sins forever sat down on the right
[1:22:29] hand of God from henceforth expecting
[1:22:32] till his enemies be made his footstool
[1:22:35] for by one offering he has perfected
[1:22:37] forever them that are sanctified
[1:22:41] wherefore the Holy Ghost is a witness to
[1:22:43] us for after that he had said before
[1:22:47] this is the Covenant that I will make
[1:22:49] with them after those days saith the
[1:22:51] Lord I will put my laws in their heart
[1:22:53] and in their minds will I write them and
[1:22:57] their sins and iniquities will I
[1:23:00] remember no more now where remission of
[1:23:03] these is there is no more offering for
[1:23:06] sin having therefore brethren boldness
[1:23:09] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[1:23:12] of Jesus by a new and living way which
[1:23:15] he hath consecrated for us through the
[1:23:18] veil that is to say his flesh and having
[1:23:21] an High Priest over the house of God let
[1:23:25] us draw near with a true heart in full
[1:23:27] assurance of faith having our hearts
[1:23:30] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:23:32] our bodies washed with pure water let us
[1:23:35] hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:23:37] without raving wavering for he is
[1:23:41] faithful that promised and let's let us
[1:23:44] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:23:47] love and to good works again we're not
[1:23:51] in this by ourselves let us consider one
[1:23:55] another to provoke unto love now
[1:23:59] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:24:00] together as the manner of some is but
[1:24:04] exhorting one another and so much the
[1:24:06] more as you see the Day approaching so
[1:24:12] much more as you see the Day approaching
[1:24:14] we can see that fulfillment of Scripture
[1:24:17] as in the day is a protein so let us saw
[1:24:20] much more get in fellowship with each
[1:24:24] other and with Christ nor do this we
[1:24:28] must come under the Express image of
[1:24:30] Christ which is that divine love which
[1:24:34] extends grace for all things
[1:24:38] but Obama he says here he said I believe
[1:24:40] the Bible is inspired Word of God every
[1:24:43] word of it is inspired
[1:24:45] I don't believe just this is not
[1:24:46] inspired and this isn't that is I
[1:24:48] believe it's all inspired and it's
[1:24:51] either all right or all wrong or or it's
[1:24:55] all and if it's all mixed up then we
[1:24:57] don't know what to do but it's every bit
[1:24:59] the truth I'm willing to sacrifice my
[1:25:02] life for what thus saith the Lord is
[1:25:05] here are we willing to sacrifice
[1:25:07] everything for what this publicist
[1:25:10] are we the sacrifice are everything that
[1:25:13] was mentioned our own wills our ideas
[1:25:15] everything for thus saith the Lord if
[1:25:19] God tells us to do something we must do
[1:25:22] it without hesitation if this is true if
[1:25:27] everything in this Bible is true why do
[1:25:30] we still try to control parts of our
[1:25:31] lives scripture says he to put his hand
[1:25:35] to the plow and looks back is not fit
[1:25:37] for the kingdom that's someone still
[1:25:40] trying to control their life you're
[1:25:42] still caught up with the things of the
[1:25:44] world we must look forward never looked
[1:25:48] back we're seeing also their song so I
[1:25:54] am persuaded that he is able to keep
[1:25:57] that which is committed that which he
[1:25:59] has promised he's more than able to keep
[1:26:02] us he's more than able to help us he's
[1:26:05] more than able to help us to die out to
[1:26:07] sell out he's more than able to help us
[1:26:10] to overcome the areas in our lives where
[1:26:12] were weak perfect strength of perfect
[1:26:16] weakness God will take nothing and make
[1:26:19] something he started man with just a
[1:26:22] ball of clay which is nothing but yet he
[1:26:24] created man and we are nothing but a
[1:26:27] ball of clay and he can create something
[1:26:30] wonderful it also says here casting down
[1:26:36] imaginations and every high thing that
[1:26:38] exalteth is saw itself against the
[1:26:41] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:26:43] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:26:46] of Christ
[1:26:48] and Paul says in Philippians I said for
[1:26:51] me to live is Christ and to die is gain
[1:26:55] if we if we get everything in line with
[1:26:59] our attitude humble ourselves seeking
[1:27:02] God's will continually praying then we
[1:27:07] could have said about us as what even
[1:27:11] was said about Solomon he said in second
[1:27:13] chronicles he's now on Solomon had made
[1:27:15] an end of praying the fire came down
[1:27:17] from heaven and consumed the burnt
[1:27:19] offering and the sacrifices and the
[1:27:21] glory of the Lord filled the house may
[1:27:25] that be our prayer that as we sacrificed
[1:27:27] these things that the glory of the Lord
[1:27:30] will fill our house it would fill all of
[1:27:33] our houses and has been coming to God's
[1:27:35] presence we each bring our part of that
[1:27:38] glory into one pillow far we're in this
[1:27:43] together and as he says here for again
[1:27:47] we were to cast down everything cast
[1:27:49] down imaginations every high thing that
[1:27:52] is above Christ those 5 senses of the
[1:27:58] Spirit we fight them daily imagination
[1:28:02] it's pretty powerful sometimes you see
[1:28:05] someone over there talking all but
[1:28:06] they're talking about me we need to cast
[1:28:08] that down that's imagination then your
[1:28:10] reasoning kicks in all these other
[1:28:13] things die to it pants have created
[1:28:16] everything check everything against the
[1:28:18] word if you're struggling give it to God
[1:28:21] I only want that sense of faith be
[1:28:24] tapping into God I prayed that God would
[1:28:27] just help us to rise above those senses
[1:28:30] and just tap into his presence or faith
[1:28:32] only enters and I pray that we would
[1:28:38] continue to walk in love as Christ has
[1:28:43] loved us
[1:28:45] divine love overlooks all these things
[1:28:48] divine love extends grace divine love
[1:28:51] humbles ourselves divine love is not one
[1:28:54] to try to get ahead or to try to control
[1:28:56] the situation divine love that God lead
[1:29:00] may that be our prayer and his mark
[1:29:05] prayer does he would do so with each and
[1:29:08] every one of us that we would die and it
[1:29:12] says once again and winding down here
[1:29:14] now I'm finished with this I'll read the
[1:29:16] scripture again for to for to me to live
[1:29:19] is Christ and to die is gain I prayed to
[1:29:22] God that that is our prayer there's just
[1:29:26] a million but I Bob get ready
[1:29:28] I just just say one of the prayer I'll
[1:29:31] turn it over to butter Bob a dear
[1:29:33] gracious Heavenly Father know what I
[1:29:36] pray that as we wind down this service
[1:29:38] that this would have been a blessing
[1:29:39] some house to someone father I mean each
[1:29:41] and every one just continue to examine
[1:29:43] ourselves father as as the scripture
[1:29:45] says pray Lord that you just show us the
[1:29:48] avenues of our lives father debtor we
[1:29:50] need to overcome and nor that there's
[1:29:52] something we're still struggling with
[1:29:53] for after years of trying to overcome
[1:29:55] normy you just show us the right way to
[1:29:57] get through this father
[1:29:59] maybe humbled ourselves continually is
[1:30:01] my prayer we love you Lord and thank you

[1:30:28] for thought there's a man he meant sure
[1:30:32] enjoyed their members and I was

[1:30:38] sensitivity to that still small voice
