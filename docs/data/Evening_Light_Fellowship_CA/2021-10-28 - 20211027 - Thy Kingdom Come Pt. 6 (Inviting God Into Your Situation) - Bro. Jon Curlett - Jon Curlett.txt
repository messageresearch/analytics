and pray amen amen god bless you this evening thank you musicians if you would turn in the scriptures to james chapter one amen james chapter one certainly good to have brother joe and his family back and good to have sister roberta and brother murrell with us as well amen finally it's no fun being in quarantine i've had to do it a couple times now and the house starts to get small and the walls start to close in no matter how great your family is so it's certainly i'm sure they're happy to be out we're happy to have them out amen most of us amen god bless you james chapter 1 verse 2 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but that patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him but let him ask him faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed drop down to verse 16 if you would i don't have it in the slides but i want to continue verse 19 or 16 says do not air my beloved brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath and verse 25 says but whoso looketh unto the perfect law of liberty and continue it therein he be not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed amen god bless the reading of his word you may be seated tonight and then we're going to continue on our series of thy kingdom come and i want to take for a sermon tonight inviting god into your situation amen inviting god into your situation now we showed in the last service the perfect type the perfect example of provision in our lives and that type was of course christ to the bride and we read scriptures all through the bible you know from genesis all the way through to revelation and we showed that god has provided for us from the beginning to the end amen he has a plan and in that plan he has made provision to make his plan come to pass in every one of us we talked about that jehovah jireh attribute of god and how he's put that in the man to be the provider how he's put it in him to be the one that toils and sweats and and breaks his body for the sake of his family and for his household and then we ended that service with the realistic reminder that we probably didn't need and that's that men are not perfect and men husbands are not perfect and fathers aren't perfect and that can certainly lead to issues and one of those issues we talked about was putting the women into the role of having to provide for the family in some form or fashion and that's where we want to pick up again today to hopefully close us out before i head off for a week of hunting and relaxation and that's walking 10 to 20 kilometers a day in bog and bush and eating my own cooking so we'll see if that actually is a break and relaxation but regardless i'm looking forward to getting out and just getting away from everything for a while amen now let's drop back into the scripture here and see the response we take and really what we're talking about here in this book of james is when a man gets in over his head amen and it doesn't just apply to the brothers of course it applies to all of us but i want us to see what the the scriptural you know response is when we get into something and we say i've got nothing left i don't know what to do i don't have anything to offer i'm out of my depth and these different things so james 1 verse 2 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations that means different temptations we don't face the same thing all the time if we miss if we're going through the same thing all the time it's usually because we haven't actually won that battle yet we haven't gotten the victory but that word temptations means trials and provings and when i took it back to the to the root word there it had this to say it said it is the trial of man's fidelity integrity virtue and constancy it's an enticement to sin temptation whether arising from the desires or from the outward circumstances so it can be something pushing in on you to try and get you to do something that you're not supposed to do or it can be an internal temptation to sin and it reminds us of the temptation which the devil sought to divert jesus the messiah from his divine aaron it's trying to get you to go to an end result without going through the work of the res of what's required to get you there with character and with strength and with victory amen so you have an outside one trying to get you to do something that's against the word but then there's an inward temptation to skip the process and jump to the end goal and we know that never works either it says the condition of things or a mental state by which we are enticed to sin or to elapse from the faith in holiness this is one of those little things where you say i'm just going to do this i'm just going to give in today and then i'll go back to being a christian tomorrow or that sort of thing it's those little things that we give into on a maybe a daily or a weekly basis where we just have this little thing that kind of we like to do from time to time it says adversity affliction trouble now catch this it's sent by god and serving to test or prove one's character faith and holiness so what james is talking about here when he's talking about these divers or different temptations is something that proves whether what you say you are is actually what you are amen whether you've got the goods if you can just not only walk talk the talk but if you can walk the walk and so we have to remember when we're walking through life and when we're talking about these things is that we are one thing and that is a work in progress amen that we are not perfect we are not whole in and of ourselves do we do not have the experience we do not have the knowledge we don't have the training as soon as we are born as soon as we get the holy ghost to overcome necessarily in every situation the simple fact is we don't know what we don't know and it's going to take sometimes a situation to let us realize what we don't know or what we don't have and conversely to let us know what we do have and what we do know amen because the test or the trial proves whether what you have is the real deal whether it's the real goods amen like i said before we're speaking to the men tonight not so much to the women but when we were born a man when we were born a male we did not automatically get everything that we need to do everything we're supposed to do in this world according to the word amen and when we got the holy ghost we didn't get that sudden download of all the character of all the knowledge of all the experience of all the faith of all the strength all of these patiences that we might need we didn't just get that when we got the holy ghost we got access to it and then we got a guide and a trainer and a mentor that can bring us into it we got a god that can change us into his likeness but we did not automatically download that because we need the way to apply it as well and sometimes we get into a situation then we realize i need more of god than i have amen and that's what james is talking about here and the simple fact in all of this is there is no replacement for experience there's a reason why a pastor has to be experienced is because you don't want somebody inexperienced in that role because the inexperience make mistakes amen and sometimes you can't afford those mistakes and so you need to have somebody that's been proven and that has been tested in these things and it's the same thing as we go through our lives as men we've got to get to the place where we have an experience and that experience is not in head knowledge or understanding of the word but it's in the reality of the word it's in the power of the word it's in the provision of the word and that's godly experience that we're looking for as men amen so what these trials are for us and what they're talking about is taking what we believe to be right and testing it to see if it actually is right and if what we believe is right and we're putting it through the test then what comes out on the other side should be the word fruits and the word results and then because if what we believe is the word and what comes out on the other side is not the word then we've got a disconnect somewhere something isn't according to the word like we said before when we look at the stature of a perfect man we have what we have faith and then from there comes strength to believe it and after that comes knowledge and this knowledge is when your faith becomes sight because at this point when god proves himself you no longer have to wonder is he going to do it next time once he proves himself to be a healer you'll believe it for the next time once he proves himself to be a provider then you believe it for the next time brother branham talks about getting into your car and turning the key the first time you get in the car you may not know if it's going to start or not but every time after that after it starts the first time you go in expecting the key to start the car every time and that's what godly knowledge is is that every time you do things according to the word because he's proven it over and over and over again you just go in and you turn the key of the word by faith and what happens happens because what you're believing the word and this becomes sight to you now it's not something you have to work up it's not something you have to pray down it's just knowledge you know that god is real in this area in this situation and so you just say god i'm turning the key and god does exactly what you expect him to do because you're in the word and the word has been made flesh and it's been made an experience and a reality in your life amen what faith becomes routine and when faith becomes routine it becomes knowledge and you can use it all day every day right you don't have to sit there believing believing believing because you know and therefore it's knowledge to you amen verse 3 says knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience so the trying of your faith is what these trials are about is proving what you believe it's proving what you believe the word to say it says it does what it works patience now the word patience means steadfastness constancy and endurance see a lot of times we think of it as the endurance part hold on that's patience but he says no no it's the steadfastness and constancy it's the unwillingness to change from the word in the trial it's the unwillingness to go to the side to the left or to the right but to stay true to the word through it that's your constancy is to stay with what god has said regardless of what the circumstances look like it says here in the new testament it's the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings basically it doesn't matter how desperate the situation gets how bad things get you stay with the word you stay with what god has told you to do each and every time it says a patient steadfast waiting for that's what we think of most often and that says a patient enduring sustaining and perseverance now that means patience can't happen overnight when we pray for patients look out i never pray for patients because you know what patients mean it's going to be a while because that's what patience has to has to see is that there is a space between the request and the answer and in the middle is patience and that's the trial of your faith amen so when i've prayed for things then what the trial is that will we hold on and will we have patience until the answer comes james says the trial and the proving of your faith comes through patience you've got to be able to wait it out you've got to be able to let god be god and come into the situation so a prayerful request always follows with a need for patience because god does not always answer that moment the answer may be on the way but the appearance or the manifestation of that answer is not necessarily going to come the next day he says but let patience have her perfect that means her complete work that you may be perfect that means doesn't mean complete it means brought to an end or finished it's talking about the process of god to change us it means talking about the process of god to grow us to mature to take us to what he wants us to be that's what this patience requires amen and what's what it produces it says that ye may be perfect and entire that word entire means complete in all its parts in no way wanting or unsound they used to call horses they had to check them whether they were sound or unsound you know what unsound meant it meant that they had bad teeth so they couldn't eat properly which meant they'd be malnourished and they wouldn't have their health for very long but the unsoundness was that they would break down after a short burst of exercise you wanted a horse that could go all day long and if it didn't it was unsound and it's the same thing for humans we're looking at somebody that can do what that can hold on for the long run that can work their way through the situation that doesn't fall down as soon as things get a little bit tough it says without blemish or defect free from sin faultless and complete in all respects that's what he's talking about here that's the purpose of these trials these testings that we go through he said what wanting nothing and if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that's what we're talking about when we get in over our head he says if any one of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given to him that means when you ask he doesn't say you're supposed to have this he doesn't say but you've been a child of mine for 22 years and you still don't have this figured out what's going on no no he says if you'll come and ask for what you have need of then he gives to you and he doesn't say you're supposed to have this already and then when we go to him in humility when we go to him with the need and we say lord i need more of you i need you in this situation that he always responds with i'll give you more i'll give you what you have need of i'll step up your game by stepping myself into your situation amen i'll grow and mature you into what you need to be but let who let this man ask him faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed it has no direction it has no control the waves have no choice they go where the wind blows them amen he's saying that's the way that man is if he's wavering on it you'll be pulled and pushed and you'll be turned this way in that way in the situation he says no no hold fast don't expect anything other than what you've prayed for right if you go in asking then come out expecting amen so the question is why do we ever go to god and say we lack something why do we ever go to him and say i have need of something pain pain is what does it isn't it now you say no it's when i have a need but what is that need brought about by it's in pain if you're if you need food what is the pain it's hunger amen if you need more of god in your marriage then what's the pain your marriage isn't doing so well amen if you need if you're going to him and say lord i need financial blessing what is it the needs aren't being met you're in a difficulty and it's causing pain it's causing discomfort in your life and that's the thing that usually drives us to god unfortunately is when things aren't going so well when we're feeling pain rather than we are in feeling loved and protected and provided for that rarely drives us to god but the minute we feel pain the minute we feel discomfort the minute things aren't going our way then we run to god very quickly amen what is it james says look but when you get into those situations go talk to god about it go talk to god and say god you are my great provider we talked about that last time jehovah jair lord you see and you will see to it if i will only invite you into the situation if i will only ask you to do what i need done in this situation now you look at that and you say brother jonathan he's asking for wisdom i don't need wisdom i need more money i don't need wisdom i need deliverance i don't need wisdom i need healing but when we look at wisdom it covers more than just this idea of knowledge or understanding it's it's a whole gamut of things amen you say i don't need wisdom i just need to make a career change or know if i need to make it i need to know if i need to upgrade my education i need to know if i have to move someplace else right i'm not looking for wisdom i'm looking for leadership but we'll find that leadership is encompassed in wisdom if we look a little more closely and we look at the original word in the bible in the greek and it says wisdom is broad and full of intelligence and that's usually what we think about when we say wisdom but then it says the knowledge of very diverse matters specifically the very knowledge of things human and divine what it means is that you know things that are carnal and spiritual because what we're carnal creatures and you've got to be able to address carnal situations through a spiritual filter so you've got to know the carnal but you've got to know the spill spiritual you've got to know how those things integrate and how they can work together he says skill in the management of affairs amen if we're a husband if we're a father we know to know how to manage our affairs don't we if we're in the ministry we need to know how to manage our affairs if we're in any sort of a position of authority or responsibility we have to know how to manage what's underneath ah say amen it says devout and proper prudence in discussion with men not disciples of christ and skill and discretion and imparting christian truth so this is the ability to witness not only to those that are of the household of faith but those that are outside the household of faith the ability to speak to people at their level and then it says the knowledge and practice of the requisites for godly and upright living this is in other words living the life that's what wisdom is is the ability to take what you've been taught and put it into action so that you live what you believe this is all encompassed in wisdom so wisdom does what it takes everything intellectual and everything's spiritual and it brings them into a package that you can apply in your everyday life amen you don't need to be spiritual to step out of the way of a car driving down the road at you you don't need spiritual discernment for that amen that's colonel but you do have to know how you're going to lead your family and that is not something that's supposed to be carnal it's supposed to be spiritual amen so we've got to know when to be practical and we've got to know when to be spiritual if i can put it that way and wisdom takes those two and it puts us together so that we're not over spiritualizing something that's simple and we're not under spiritualizing something that has a far greater impact than we might happen or know amen so when we get into a situation where we're over our heads what is the thing we need wisdom that's what solomon asked for when he was put into the kingdom position when he took the throne of david is he said i need wisdom if you give me wisdom everything else will follow but without wisdom he says i'll fall flat on my face you can give me all these other things but without wisdom i'll waste it right i won't use it in the way that i'm supposed to so what this wisdom encompasses not only the knowledge but it's the experience and you say well how am i going to get experience you get experience through trials that's what god does is he puts you into a situation where you have to apply what you know or what you think you know and then he brings you through it and as you're going through it you start applying what you've been taught how you've been raised the the input you get from the people that you trust and look to and you start to apply it and then you see how it takes you through and you're going to get experience one way or the other aren't you now it might be bad experience or it might be good experience and most of us we get bad experience before we get good experience but it's supposed to teach us for the next time that we do it and we get a good experience the next time and then don't look down because you made a mistake don't look down because you're failing just say what did i learn and how do i keep from doing that the next time amen the righteous man follows down what seven times but he gets up again we want to be able to get up from those mistakes learned from it and move on amen but the thing is god has a way of doing things and god's given us the word to lead us and guide us and we always want to look to that as we step into situations and say god what is your provided way that's what we focused on last time is god has a provided way can we find it can we see in the world where he's provided for where we can find a promise where we can find that guidance and direction and then we can step into that and we can move forward with full confidence amen now we're talking about men and we're talking about provision and i think we've proven at this point by the scriptures that god has put the man in the place of being the provider for the family amen now we're going to be talking a little bit about this and this isn't directed at anyone we don't have any wives in this church that are working as far as i know out in the workforce so i'm not speaking to this church in the sense that there's somebody here that needs this specifically amen but we do have a lot of young people that are coming up and need to know what they're getting into so again we're talking to the brothers not to the sisters specifically and because we've got young men that are coming up that are going to be getting married lord willing and they're going to be raising families because we've got young sisters that lord william will someday accept proposals of marriage they need to know what it looks like when they get into these things and how you make a decision and how you step into that and when you step into it and when will be the best time to do it and then how do you deal with situations as you move forward in finances and whatnot in the family that's why we're preaching it here is because we may not need it right now but we're going to need it very quickly i do believe amen so we want to set ourselves up for success in these things by preaching it before the need is so that you're ready and prepared for it so as you start to move into relationships as you start to get into marital age as you start to move into education as you start to move into the workforce you understand what the influences are and what the impacts are of your decisions as you move forward in life amen our sisters need to know how to pick a proper husband because remember the man asks but the woman accepts and she needs to know if that man is going to be a good provider for her and then she needs to know if he's got the characteristics of the providing husband and if she steps in without him being that then she may pay a price for it later now we're not going to cover all of it today i've got a relatively short stack of notes here but we'll pick up some of this certainly when i come back but the beautiful thing about this is that you don't have to hear my opinion the word speaks to everything that i've just mentioned there is nothing that i've just talked about that the word doesn't tell us amen so we've got word answers so i'm not going to be sitting up here saying i think or i believe i'm going to be pointing us back to scriptures amen i'm going to take us back to the word because we have examples for what men do we have examples for what women do in the workforce in provision when things get tough we have all of it in the scriptures if we'll only look and to me if we only get one example in the scripture that's enough and then if god tells us once that's enough we don't have to do it two or three times if he only says it once that's good enough for me but we have examples for everything in this amen so i'm not preaching down to anyone i'm going to use myself for the bad examples today amen so i'm going to put myself out there for ridicule and and these different things and we'll talk a little bit about about me and my marriage and some of the decisions i've made because i'm preaching one thing but i haven't always lived what i've preached amen we're all like that we're all like that we've we always want to do the best but we don't always do the best if i can put it that way amen so we aren't perfect if we're lucky we've been raised in a christian home with good parents with good mentors with strong ministry and these different things and if we're really blessed we get the holy ghost early on in our life and that gives us at least a fighting chance in some of these things amen but satan is trying to attack us on every front and the first place he's going to go for young people is going to be as soon as they start looking at marriage there's where your biggest battle is going to be is do you get the right one up front because if you don't you're in for a life of serious unpleasantry amen it's going to be very difficult amen we don't know in the end what we don't know like i said and we step into some of these things and and we're young at best like we said last time when you're a young person you're usually just around here you've had faith enough to believe christ for your your salvation you've got the holy ghost and you're starting to work through this and yet when we step into something like marriage if we could step in up here we do it we do great but unfortunately we usually step around here and so we've got to have an understanding of what satan's going to try and hit us with as we go into these things amen now when it comes to that marriage decision and we're going to spend only a very short period of this time and i'm going to pick a scripture that's probably going to make you laugh about what this decision looks like and it's luke 14 31. this is your marriage decision right here it says are what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand now that's a weird scripture for marriage isn't it all the married couples giggled because they think we're talking about marriages fighting and no no no i know they're not but what are we talking about we're talking about make sure you have what's needed to get to the finish line or to get to the goal before you step into it in the first place that's what he's talking you don't start to build a house unless you know you've got the funds to build the house to the end amen otherwise you're going to end up with a half-built house that you can't use and all your money sunk into it and you've got nothing to really show for it amen listen to this one in three first-time marriages doesn't work you got a 33 chance of failing in your marriage from the get-go now you say we're in the message we don't believe in divorce we don't believe in these things doesn't matter look around there's lots of people haven't made it including my own mother and father amen so there's no guarantee that you're going to get it right so know this that when you step into marriage when you step into a relationship that you are on a battle zone and not with each other but rather satan's going to be trying to get in there to get your eyes off the word to get your eyes on each other's flaws and failures and try and drive a wedge inside there and push you apart amen amen now for this scripture i'm going to use myself as an example because i got married when i was 21 and i completed four years of a six-year engineering degree my wife and i have been courting for nearly four years when she accepted my proposal of marriage so i had two years left of university now look at that situation i have no stable job i have a difficulty to provide a steady income because i'm going to be studying and my engineering degree is not completed so my career is not guaranteed beyond that point and there's no guarantee that i'll even finish that once i get married so that's what i did that's the situation i was in when i proposed to my wife amen now if we are wise we would have said wait the extra two years and get married then at least you've got what a career you can step right into the workforce you've got a way of making money in these different things but unlike brother joe and sister priscilla we did not do that and we elected to get married with still some time left before that was done now on the other hand my wife was looking at me and she has no proof that i'm going to be a great husband in terms of the provider role and that's really what we're talking about these days and then she's looking at that and she sees a guy that's gotten great grades that seems to be a hard worker but at the same time i haven't proved myself yet right i've held some jobs down through the summer and these different things and and some internships and what now that and i've done well in them but i still have improved my constancy i mean i haven't proved that i'm able to commit to a job and do the daily grind you know from eight to five every day no matter what to take the low salaries and the the tough gigs and the work that you don't really enjoy and whatnot i haven't proven myself for that but she looks in there and she's saying does he look like he's going to do it and she has to make a calculated decision when she did it and of course we know that she decided to go for it because she accepted my proposal of marriage but knowing that i was going to have to go right back to school within eight months meant that we had made a decision up front for my wife to go into the workforce as soon as she could because it was going to be difficult for me to provide for the family while doing a full-time engineering degree so we in we literally invited strain into our marriage from the get-go because why it wasn't according to the perfect pattern amen we did not go into this into the word pattern where the man is set up to provide for the household we went in for a man that is looking to but in all probability is not going to be able to provide for the family in the fullness that's required amen so what happens when we don't match the perfect type we pay a price amen and we did pay a price and i said this last service and it bears repeating amen when we leave the perfect type the perfect way the perfect plan when we leave the word pattern we always pay a price and that goes whether we're talking about providers whether we're talking about anything when we get off the word a price has to be paid and then somebody always has to pay and guess who pays it's the innocent it's the innocent that pay it's not the one that's doing that work proverbs 22 8 says he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity now iniquity we know is when you do what you know you're not supposed to do now sometimes that's not strict disobedience it's partial disobedience where you say i'm going to do most of it but i'm not going to do all of it well that little bit of all of it is called iniquity when you know not to do it but you do it the amplified says he who sows iniquity will reap calamity and futility now i thought that was interesting because in other words he's saying if you know to do better and you ignore it then you're not going to get the results that you were expecting and you're going to reap something else instead now you may get what you were expecting in the sense of for us we got the finances we needed but what we didn't know was what else was going to come with that amen because we're sowing something different than the word and so we're going to get something different than the word in it now we got the finances and that was great but we know that according to the word when you give way to something else over the word then something important to the word is going to take a hit amen the blessing of god the protection of god the provision of god whatever it looks like something else is going to give on the word side if you get off of the word it's every time anytime you let something from the word slide then something that's in the word will also slide out the other way somebody's got to pay the price something's got to give amen and chances are the thing that's got to give is going to matter more to god amen it's going to be something that matters more to him hosea 10 says sow to yourselves in righteousness and reap in mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and reign righteousness upon you ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity you have eaten the fruit of lies because thou distrust in thy way in the ulti in the multitude of thy mighty men remember we're talking about me here okay so what if you sow in righteousness if you do it the way he wants you to do then he can do what he can provide but if you sow your own way then you're going to reap something else galatians 6 says be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap now that's a curse and a blessing isn't it because if you sow by the word you'll reap by the word and if you sow by your own way then you'll reap by your own way and the only way to gather something different than what you've sown is to sow something else amen you've got to sow something different to get something different you can't sow something and get something different than what you've you've sowed you can't reap something different than what you sowed amen somebody else can give something to you but you can't reap of your own thing that you sowed amen any different than what you put in there if you planted apples you can't reap peaches amen if you sow wheat you can't reap barley right and if you sow sin you can't reap faith amen and if you sow against the word you can't reap the word at any point he says for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not now i find it's interesting that there is no fear of fainting or being weary when we're sowing to our flesh have you ever noticed that we never get tired about doing things that this flesh really enjoys do we'll do that all day long our kids will sit in front of movies for 15 hours a day if we let them and they won't get weary they'll they'll fall asleep of of complete and total exhaustion at midnight maybe if we let them watching movies right but get them to do something healthy like play sports right like go have fellowship play lego build something and they're done after 30 minutes they get weary and well doing don't they what the flesh is never the struggle it's the things that are of the spirit the things that are of the word that are difficult for us to keep doing amen we have so much patience and energy and drive and passion for things that are fun or enjoyable to the flesh but we lack that same constancy that same patience that same endurance when it comes to the things that are in well-doing as the scripture says amen god help us to be rugged in the faithful things of well-doing amen amen but the point in all of this is that what make the word decision reap the word benefit that's what we're talking about tonight make the not so word decision reap the not so word benefit amen now like i said my wife and i made a conscious decision to add strain to our marriage by putting her into the workforce shortly after we got married and so it's never a good thing if anybody's interested adding strain early on to a marriage is never a good thing right we're young we're impressionable we don't know anything we have no practical experience in marriage and then you add strain to that then something's going to break at some point amen and what did we say we said it'll just be temporary we can handle it it's only two years we'll make it through it won't be a big deal and we'll come out on the other side we'll laugh about it that's what we said amen and by the time she got her permanent residence and could work i was back in school and she was not working days she was working nights amen i'd drop her off in the evening pick her up in the morning and then i take her home and i rub her feet because she was working at tim horton's night shift doing the baking every night so she's on her feet for eight and a half hours every night i'd bring her home rub her feet for a little bit put her to bed then i'd jump off the school i'd be gone all day i'd come back and then we'd have a little bit of time together and then i'd have to hit the books to study and then i'd drive her in at you know 11 o'clock 11 30 at night for her shift so we had this big disconnect between when i had time and when i had energy and when she had time and when she had energy so that's going to add strain to the marriage amen and even though you're young and in love and and things you know it's honeymoonish and all these different things it's still adding difficulty because there's a we're not on the same timeline we're not doing the same things together and whatnot i'm going to bed alone and she's going to bed alone and we never see each other and then there's no physical connection there's no emotional connection you're kind of just ships passing by each other in the night half the time amen what is it we left the word pattern and we did it willingly we did it willingly we said it's better for us to marry than for us to be a part and we're willing to take the pain of being married at a time when we shouldn't really be married so we made the choice amen so two years later who comes along selena right out of nowhere selena appears so now what do we do i'm still doing my degree and now my wife can no longer work and now we need the finances that she doesn't have the ability to produce so what did i have to do i had to try and get a job to provide in the meantime and so i got a job with a company that i work with in one of my internships and i actually held down a 32 hour a week job for for a great deal of that time amen and god provided for it now the simple question sort of is why didn't we just do that in the first place why didn't we because it was easier to put her in than it was easier to put me in right had nothing to do with what does the word actually tell john to do we said it's easier for her to do it than for me to do it and she said i'm going to help you you know i'm going to do my part i don't have a ton to do at home you know these different things so i'll step in there she's willing to help but the simple fact is the word way should have been for me to shoulder the load and get in there that would have been tough and it was tough when i finally got into it but we also see that god can provide those things and he can make a way for me to do what i should have been doing all along now that would have added stress to our marriage but we would have had a promise to go back to because i was doing exactly what i was supposed to be doing but in the meantime you're struggling through different things and you don't really have the same thing to go back to because you're out of the word of god and when you're out of the word of god then you're potentially out of the will of god of course amen now we love the fact that we both have contributed to where we are today i don't have anything by my own achievement i have it because my wife has helped me in those things amen i have a finished degree because she helped me in it and she's she's worked with me through all my life and and these different things so i didn't get there i didn't come in with everything and then just added her to the mix sort of thing we've built our life together and that's forged a great deal of strength in our marriage maybe in a way that some younger couples won't have because they haven't had to go through the fire that quickly the simple fact is though that we could have easily just as a i mean it wasn't that bad folks i'm not you know it wasn't brutal but with some people they that would have put them into divorce after two years because of the strain because of the disconnect right so when you step into that you've got to know that something's going to give and something did give and something will give every time we make the less than perfect decision and that's all we're talking about amen but i want to also say this that it's not usually going to kill you and then it's not going to kill you you're not going to die if you do things less than perfectly i'm not advocating getting off the word i'm saying that there's a grace for it if i can put it that way because we didn't think too much if i was to be honest we didn't think too much about whether i should do it or she should do it the idea was john's at school all day and then he's going to be studying all night and so therefore it makes sense for her to do the work right and we we elected to do that we didn't even look that closely at the word i think if i was to think about it we just didn't think about it but i'm telling you today think about it because somebody's got to pay a price at some point and it can be a relationship it can be a person it can be these different things amen but the simple fact is is that there is grace for these things for less than perfect situations there are often less than perfect answers and god has grace for it i've always taken great comfort from this scripture and it's romans 8 28 we all know it it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god that's it that's it all things work together for good it doesn't say that we have to be in his perfect will for him to work it out to our good doesn't mean we have to be perfect for him to work it out for good it says we know that all things work together for good to them that love god and that's it that's simple and i can take great rest in that it says to them who are the called according to his purpose now i've been listening to it greater than solomon is here and brother braham says this about jonah he says let's find out if the footsteps of the righteous isn't ordered of the lord and if we're trusting him with all our heart though we make a mistake god will make it work around to his glory now he's talking about jonah he's talking about jonah and jonas and brother brown said people like to pick on jonah because he disobeyed god he said did you know jonah was in the perfect will of god why because god knew his prophet's response to his request and he knew that he was going to run that he would refuse to do what god asked he knew he was going to get on a boat he knew that he was going to create a storm that would force jonah to say kick me off the boat so the storm will be calmed and then he knew that he would have a fish or a whale prepared for him jonah could go in and then after three days and jonah praying and repenting that fish or that whale would spit him out onto the beach and jonah would walk out onto dry land from the mouth of the god of the people of nineveh because god wanted him in the whale's mouth he wanted him to walk out of their god's mouth so they could say this guy ain't just a normal man i mean this is coming from our god and they'd listen to him maybe in a way that they wouldn't before amen that's why i say in all of this we have to have grace for one another we don't have to condone poor decisions but we can show grace and mercy to the people that do it amen because what i'm putting myself up here to say i haven't always made them i won't always make them i'll make mistakes so we've got to have grace for somebody without condoning what they're doing they've got to learn their own way amen we're raising children guess what do our children ever make mistakes after they come out for our household that we don't agree with all the parents can say yes they do but what do you do you commit them to god we've always committed them to god we're not here for legalistic children anyways right we commit them to god and we say god they're your children before they were ever mine and we're trusting you to work all things for their good even if they're blatantly in contradiction of the scripture amen every one of us has blatantly gone against the word at some point i guarantee you whether our response has been wrong we've lied we've cheated we've said something about someone that we shouldn't we've believed a lie we've gossiped whatever it might be we've all done something amen we've all been blatantly wrong in the word and yet god in his tender and rich mercies has come around and brought us back to a place where he can restore us back to the word amen so he's looking for us to do the same thing to have that grace and mercy and trust him to work it out and let us keep our hands off of the situation amen it's a beautiful thing when we can back away and say god this one's yours i'm not going to do it you're going to have to do it amen amen blanc and i were certain and still are certain for the record that we were meant to be married but were we meant to be married at 20 and 21 i have no idea all i can say is god has worked it around to something good amen and i trust that that's the grace that he's going to have for each and every one of our lives regardless of the decisions we make but be not mocked god is not mocked whatever we sow we're still going to reap but god can take that and still turn it into something good but we're still going to have to pay a price a sacrifice is still going to have to be made amen but if we realize we've made a wrong decision the big principle is this don't try and fix it by making another bad decision that's the problem is when we compound when we double down on our mistake when we compound and double down on our position on our belief whatever it is and we jump even further behind amen two two wrongs don't make a right isn't that what what the world says it's the same thing here don't do another thing that's off the word or the other thing that's off the word pattern can i say that off the word pattern don't do another thing off the word pattern to try and bring you back to the word it'll never work amen now i was talking to brother ellie about this this dowry situation you know in in the african countries in the arab countries in the asian countries they have a dowry system for brides and i'm starting to think this might be the way to go quite frankly but not for my boys because it is a tremendous strain but when we're talking about providers then what the per the dowry system is a great filter for who's a good provider isn't it because before that young man can ever get married he has to prove that he has the stability to financially provide for that young woman now when we look at some of the biggest things that we deal with in marriage finances is one of the top three and so in a dowry system while not perfect it helps to eliminate at least one of those things up front and that's that he proves that he can be committed to a goal that he can focus on saving and putting something in priority and holding to it until he gets it it also shows how much he values that young woman because if he's running around and he's getting vacations and he's buying nice cars and he's doing all sorts of flashy things and having fun and buying man toys then guess what that dowry's not going to come very quickly is it and that young lady knows exactly where she stands in his heart but if he is sitting at home and he is working day in and day out and every dollar that he has is going to provide for the dowry so his love can come and live with him then she knows that she is a priority in his life and there is a now an outward sign of an inward love that he is showing not only to her but to her family so that the father has confidence that this young man is going to provide for my daughter amen it's a beautiful thing when it's applied properly amen so again i'm not endorsing it but it's a beautiful way to screen isn't it now that has nothing to do with spirituality amen and that's where you need a strong father that's where you need a strong pastor just to to have the insight in the and and the uh the discernment to look at that young man and say is he is he gonna provide in the other ways because you have to provide physically but you also have to provide spiritually and if you provide physically and you don't provide spiritually then god help you amen if i had to pick one i'd pick a lazy spiritual husband rather than an unspiritual well-providing husband amen we want to get to glory and that's the thing that matters most and if your husband's on spiritual then it's going to have a real a real strain on your walk with god that's for sure amen but the three most common problem areas in marriage are money and that's due to differing priorities overspending and a lifestyle bigger than your income the second thing is intimacy physical especially for men and emotional especially for women and the third thing is communication mainly the inability to share feelings express concerns or disagree without being offended that's the three areas that satan tends to hit on those that are married or about to get married those are going to be prime considerations obviously not the physical intimacy side amen but knowing that those are the key areas of marriage when we get into situations where we ask our wives to start working then we have to ask which of these areas is going to take a hit because these are the top three and which one's going to take a hit when we move somebody that is supposed to be primarily engaged in one role and we move her into or we ask her to move into a different role something's gotta hit something's gotta go right something's gotta give and then you can't have your wife working at 150 percent of her capacity and you expect her to do everything that you want her to do she can't do it she ain't superwoman right she doesn't have a movie about her right you can't expect her to do everything the word asks her to do and then everything that you ask her to do in the workplace and she do it she can't do it she's not built to do it any more than your built to do all the cooking and cleaning and all those other things and raising the children and go work amen you both got a dedicated primary role and when you push or pull or ask to to go full-time into something or even part-time as the case may be something's got to give something's got to give and she's going to have to be you're going to have to be able to say i'm ok with that because something's going to give and again it's usually the innocent that pay for those things amen the funny thing is so often when we ask our wives to step into the workforce and we say well the scripture doesn't forbid it we're going to read where brother braham says it we say the scripture doesn't forbid her to go into the workforce it's true but the scripture says a lot about what she's supposed to be doing and let's not forget that amen it says she's supposed to be at home it says she's supposed to be taking care of the children raising the children taking care of the household these different things so when we take her out of that and we put her someplace else we're not we're not telling her to do something that the word forbids but we are taking her away from doing something that the word does tell her to do amen and that's often what's forgotten is the sisters often say or the husbands is the case maybe say the word doesn't forbid it yes but the word does have a command for our sisters and then there's a place that they're supposed to be and when we take them out of that then there's a price that has to be paid in those situations amen amen but let's presume for a second that we haven't made all the right decisions let's presume you're like me and you haven't made all the right decisions that you've made mistakes and and you've gotten off of the perfect pattern at different times amen and let's look at what the prophet said i had five pages and i'm going to replace it with one and it's one big quote from brother branham amen let's i figure if there's an opinion out there let's use his rather than mine i think that'll work a little better amen again not directed at anyone but it's directed to what's coming down the road for our young women and our young men especially okay brother branham are women allowed to work in public affairs when they have a healthy husband and children now he's talking to wives not to women he's talking to wives okay and he says well i don't know about that i can't say but i just have this feeling now watch so this is brother branham's opinion this is not the word this is not scripturally based in its totality he says i have this feeling now let me say this i believe if i was a woman and i know that my husband was healthy and had a good job working i believe it would be a great pleasure to me to stay home take care of my children and raise them up and love the lord and the church said amen and if i had any time for my washing and things i was going to do i think i would teach my children how to serve the lord because one of the things that that we'll hear is that well i've got some spare time no mother ever said that ever but just in case they did he says if you've got any spare time then teach them how to serve and love the lord and then if on top of all the daily chores and the errands and the work of upkeeping the house and and getting the kids out the door and that if there's any spare time in it then use that to teach your children how to serve the lord amen now listen to what he says here now if you've got a debt or something that you're trying to help your husband pay for or something you have to do that well i think that's fine if you'll try to help him and you live a lady he says and i think it's hard no man that's got good understanding wants his wife to get in a bunch where there's a bunch of vulgar dirty men and things like that and if the woman has to get in that i think her husband ought to know that she's a genuine christian that can be trusted a trustworthy woman so brother branham's opinion is that the only reason for a wife to go out into the workforce is if there's a debt or a true need in their family amen and then he puts a caveat at the end and he says it doesn't matter the need or the debt because if she's not trustworthy if she's flighty or if she's easily influenced don't put her out there no matter what don't put her in that situation you are first and foremost her protector and you do not sacrifice your wife for the sake of a debt or a need amen so he shouldn't be put in this situation if she can't handle it now i'm going to add something here i'm going to presume i think brother branham backs it up as we go in there but a debt is not the 50 000 truck you went out and bought yesterday and then it's not stuff he's talking about debts things that have to be paid not things you chose to incur debt over to pay amen this is not for toys this is not for living high on the hog amen this is about real needs that he's saying he says but now as to say that she shouldn't work i don't know see there's no scripture to back that up i'm just passing that opinion and he's right there's no scripture that says a woman can't and shouldn't work outside of the home and we actually see examples of her working outside the home and we'll get into that when we start talking about our sisters much later he says now i'm certainly against women working in these offices where all these businessmen that carry on tell them dirty jokes and a nice clean woman sitting there and all these smutty dirty things told around like that i'm against that i think you ought to come out from among such stuff is that so he said it's now a condition for you to put your wife into work there's an environment that she's supposed to be in it can't be a bunch of men standing around saying things they shouldn't be saying and these days these days it's not just the men it's the women as well amen there's a situation the situation is such these days that you don't know what you're dealing with in there and if you find out that that's the situation you need to pull your wife out amen he says don't put her in there don't force her into that situation amen and don't put her someplace where it's all men because when you do it what are you doing you're taking your wife out from under your headship and you're putting her under somebody else's that doesn't have the holy spirit more to the point that isn't anointed or elected or chosen to be her head and then now she's got two heads throughout the day and it's real difficult for her to keep that straight sometimes you're really putting pressure on her he says but now if a woman can hold herself as a real lady and trying to help her husband do something to meet some clothes for the kids to go to school or pay off a bill or something like that and she wants to work till that's over that's why i said he's not talking about 50 000 brand new f-150s we just bought right i hope nobody just bought an f-115 right he's pointing to actual physical needs isn't he he's talking about your kids need clothes before they go to school he's talking about debts he's talking about something that has to be paid amen he's not saying go get the latest and greatest things in your life go for the bigger house go for the nicer car the better vacation the extra vacation no no he's saying you only do this when there is a great and desperate need within the family he says and notice this he puts a time stamp on it and he says what until it's over until the needs met keep her in there and then yank her out as soon as you can why she's not supposed to be in there and she's paying a price every day that she's in there and you're paying a price and the family's paying a price amen now remember at the beginning he said a wife that has a a healthy husband and children so there's two things there the husband's able to work and she's got children at home now you look at what he's saying here he still doesn't think the workplace is a great place for a woman to be in general but if there's a decent job available then he says have at it but he's still saying in general this is only for when there's a physical need in the family that has to be met then he says now this is not the lord because i have no scripture for this i love that i love that the prophet of god is sitting there and saying i can't tell you what to do and if he can't do it why would i presume to do it and why would brother gerald presume to do it amen not here to tell you what to do but i will take a prophet's experience over anybody else's as far as i can tell in this world amen i'll take a prophet's experience that's talked face-to-face with the angel of the lord on these types of situations that's why i took out my five pages of opinion and replaced it with one he also says it better than i do amen he says now to say that she shouldn't work i don't know see there's no scripture to back that up i'm just passing that opinion now i'm oh sorry now this is not the lord because i don't have no scripture for this i'm just saying that to be my opinion but otherwise i wouldn't think just because she wants to work just to run around and have more money to spend run around run to bar rooms or drink or smoke and carry on i don't think she should do it i think she should stay home try to be a lady and take care of her house what's he saying she's not out there to work to get more money to get more stuff to have more fun to have more vacations to get the latest clothes he says that is not the time or the place or the reason to have a wife sitting in a workforce amen now that's hard that's hard preaching brother branham he lays it pretty straight there doesn't he he lays it pretty straight now i could argue in my situation my wife was working because there was a real need but what happened i put her in the position for that need to be met by her i chose we chose together to do it but it was my decision to ask her to marry it was my decision to move into marriage as quickly as i did and i'm the one that put her into that position and i'm the one that put her into a place where she had to pay a price for it amen and what he's saying is man do you really want your wives to pay a price do you want to put her in a place where she's outside of the influence that she's supposed to be under do you really want to put her in there because she's going to pay a price and you're going to pay a price is it really worth it amen i think it's so good when we can work with other believers we can work with family members and these different things because at least we've got a guaranteed atmosphere if i can put it that way amen if you can work with other believers if you can have a believing boss amen brother paul if you can have a believing boss it's a wonderful thing amen but if you've got to go out into the the the natural workforce if i can put it out in the world boy it's a tough place to be it's a tough place to be my own daughter just started work and she's lucky to work in a place where there's a lot of professing christians amen and they're clean but not everybody does it you can't work in retail anymore you can't work in retail anymore without dealing with all the smut and the nastiness and the disgusting things i mean i'm working a government job and i still deal with this sort of thing you know and the the different measures that they put in place and the the you know policies and whatnot it's a messed up world i mean it's tough enough on us brothers and we're supposed to be able to take it and then when we start asking the women to go in there scripture calls her the weaker vessel and then eve when she got out from around her husband what happened that's when she messed up wasn't it if she just stayed tight to him we wouldn't be where we are today i don't believe amen but i want to finish with some encouragement here because that's pretty straight stuff and again i'm glad we don't have i'm not preaching to a person here because we don't have that happening in this church amen but it's a warning to our brothers as you step into this or if you're in a situation where things are difficult this should be the last resort rather than the first resort amen we should go in anticipating and expecting that we will be the provider for the family's physical needs throughout our entire life amen that's the scriptural position but i want to show you how ingrained this provision is into the into christ and the types of christ that we see in the scripture in ruth chapter three this is remember they're on the threshing floor and naomi tells ruth she says go and lay down at boaz's feet and let him know that you know he's the kinsmen redeemer and tell him you want him to redeem you and verse 7 says and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art near kinsmen and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou follows not young men whether rich or poor whether poor or rich sorry and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people that know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsmen well let him do the kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of the kinsman to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor also he said bring the veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said unto me go not empty into thy mother-in-law then said she sit still my daughter until they'll know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he had finished the thing this day now have you ever noticed that as soon as boaz committed to redeeming ruth what's the first thing that he did he provided for her he gave her something that would not require her to labor anymore because up to this point and we don't know how long ruth was there what was she doing every day she was laboring she was toiling she was doing back-breaking work to provide for her house for herself and naomi she's out in the fields doing the work of a man and he sees her out there doing it and everyone sees her doing it and they know she's got great work ethic and they know she's able to do it but as soon as he says you're going to be my wife as long as the other guy doesn't claim you then what does he do he says and because i'm committed to that i will provide for you until i come and get you amen i will provide for you until i come and get you that's how ingrained it was to be the provider for the men at that time a bow as we know was a type of christ amen there was a type of christ in all of this but i want you to notice the significance of the barley because how many measures did he give her he gave her six not five and not seven he gave her six why six if we look in exodus 20 we know that six represents mankind represents humanity and it represents our labor amen it says six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gate the entire household doesn't do any work the six days everybody works but on the seventh you don't work anymore he says for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it what was boaz doing when he gave her six measures he was setting her up for rest he was setting her up for provision he was setting her up for stability he was setting her up so that she wouldn't have to work again under his house amen that he was now the great provider he was the great protector he was the one that was responsible for her and as soon as he committed he says you don't have to work anymore because the other guy was going to going to redeem her if he didn't so he knew somebody's going to take care of her but i've got to get her to that place as soon as i committed i'm going to commit to give her what she has need of until the time that i can come back to her why six because the seventh measure was boaz himself and then he comes back and he has what he has the shoe that says he told me he wouldn't take you so you're mine and now you can come to my house and you don't ever have to work a day in your life amen i will be the great provider i'm the one that knows what your needs are i know what you've done to this point but now you're under my house now you're under my authority and that authority gives me responsibility to make sure that you have every single thing that you have need of now that veil isn't used to carry now that bail is transferred to him and she doesn't have to carry any more because he's carrying the veil and then he's the one that fills her every need amen reminds me of the scripture we read last verse it said the lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou maintaineth my lot amen we've all got a portion we've all got gifts we've all got things that god has given us to do amen we've got attributes different things to offer but he is our portion he's the one that gives he's the one that sets a time he's the one that sets the trials to bring it out he's the one that puts us in a place where we've got to reach out to him and say lord i need more of you i've got to be able to surrender what i've got a little more to you amen that greatest blessing is when we say lord i'm inviting you into my situation amen i am not able to handle what i'm going through i have no answer for it but your word has an answer for it and because your word has an answer i'm asking you to put that word inside of me in a way that i've never had it before amen to lift my faith to a higher plane and then to stabilize the boat amen panic has no place in these decisions and then fear has no place in these these these decisions what is it desperation to get to him not desperation to go against the word amen that desperation should never take us out of that perfect pattern it should drive us to him and say let the pattern be manifested in my life amen amen i want to finish with a promise before we close the service here tonight it's in second corinthians 9 it says and god is able to make all grace abound towards you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things let's read that again always so there's no time where we don't having all sufficiency so there is never a time where he doesn't have the provision that we need in all things all in all in all what is escape from that what can we say that doesn't apply to this scripture amen all sufficiency in all things that in those things we may abound to every good work as it is written he had dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor and his righteousness remaineth forever now catch this verse 10 he says now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seeds sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness what he's saying is that what you have is because god gave it to you in the first place you took it you sowed it and in that he is multiplying it and providing for you what you have need of in your day-to-day life amen the one that gives you the seed will make sure that that seed multiplies when you plant it amen he said being enriched in everything to all bountifulness it doesn't matter if it's a need of this life it doesn't matter if it's a spiritual need a relational need a marital need a physical need an emotional need an intellectual need a career change whatever it might be he says being enriched in everything to all bountifulness but you've got to see bountifulness through his eyes not through the world's eyes amen because he's still doing a work in us right he's trying to bring us into that perfect image and that's the bountifulness that he's most engaged in i mean that's what he's most worried about but if we're working into that he has no problem blessing us with the things of this world because it's not holding us back it's not what's defining our life it's not what's defining our our time and our energy and our efforts amen and he's willing to give us what we have our need of in our life every single day if we can only step into what he's he's showing us amen he says being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god that in all of it we'll be able to say thank you lord thank you lord for the trial thank you lord for the need thank you lord for the difficulty amen how do we know he's god if he never shows himself god if we are in such ease of life and things are going so great that we never get to see god's supernatural amen we want a supernatural god and yet when the time comes to be supernatural what do we do we go back to colonel right that's not the way to experience god the way to experience god is say lord you promise supernatural answers we're looking for supernatural answers and i'm going to be patients i'm going to have that constancy i'm going to have that stability i'm going to have that faith to wait for you to come on the scene amen amen brothers god has promised us the skills the attributes the drive the commitment and the focus to provide for our households and if we don't have it he's promised to give it to us if we ask him right and that doesn't mean it's easy doesn't mean that it's going to be a walk in the park and you're going to pray for it one day and wake up the next and it's there but if we will submit ourselves to him to do the change amen look for god to move in and change us and grow us and mature us then he'll do it amen and then we can stay inside the word pattern and he can bless us in a way that we could never be blessed outside of it amen but when we lack and we will every one of us we will and we do at some point amen when we can't seem to get there what is our solution going to be is our solution going to be well desperate situations require desperate measures or is it going to be desperate situations require supernatural god amen is that what we're going to do are we going to go and ask of him so that he can give us liberally or are we going to say let's resolve it our own way and that's the simplest way it's the simplest may but the price is going to have to be paid amen we know our wives are more than willing to help i believe that with all my heart i got a wife that's that's easily a harder worker as i am maybe harder and then she's got a work ethic that is unparalleled i believe amen but i want that to be the last resource the last resort rather than the first amen amen let it be the work done in me let i let me take the burden let me be the one that steps into that role in a in a greater way in a more more uh committed way rather than have her step into it amen let's stand together if we would we're talking about doing what the harder work and inviting god into the situation amen amen now by god's grace that's it's going to be it for the brothers so sisters you have a couple weeks to psych yourself up and enjoy the break brothers don't get comfortable because we are the bride of christ and as we're preaching to the sisters then what applies to them applies to us in our walk with god amen and i guarantee you it will be a great challenge to all of us as we go through today man pray for me as i'm going through like i said i i don't want to preach opinions i want to stick it to the word and by god's grace the things i'm studying he shows me in the word so i don't have to have an opinion on it where there is an opinion i'll take the prophets i won't inject mine by god's grace but if you feel it is an opinion then you pray for me and we'll trust god to sort it out amen i mean let's bow our heads together lord jesus another challenge to our lives this morning heavenly father to step up to a higher plane lord to increase our faith lord to trust you all the more lord as the situations get desperate as this world lord grows tighter and tighter around us as squeezes happen nor does satan attacks our families our marriages lord our masculinity the femininity of our sisters lord we know
