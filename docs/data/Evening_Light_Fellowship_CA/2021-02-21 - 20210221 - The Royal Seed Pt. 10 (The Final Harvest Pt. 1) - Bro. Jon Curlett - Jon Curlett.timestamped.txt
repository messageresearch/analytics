[21:13] the sweetest name
[21:18] amen praise the
[21:23] [Music]
[21:29] you lord
[22:06] um this song is a dotty rambo song
[22:10] and i don't know if anybody i saw the
[22:13] song before and i kind of told the
[22:14] background of it
[22:15] and and i don't like i don't know how
[22:18] how much people know about daddy ramble
[22:19] but
[22:20] she had a really rough life like a
[22:22] really rough life um
[22:23] i think she was converted at 12 and
[22:27] she was just in country music and i
[22:29] think she helped bring money into the
[22:30] family and when she
[22:32] when she got saved and she began to sing
[22:35] just gospel music her father put her out
[22:38] and she was put out of the house at 12
[22:39] years old and
[22:42] at 17 i think she got married and that
[22:45] man wasn't faithful to her
[22:47] but she stayed married to him so long as
[22:48] far as i know
[22:50] she had a lot of sickness in her life
[22:53] and i think
[22:54] you know um
[22:57] she make really queer things um that you
[23:00] wouldn't talk about really here but like
[23:01] clear things like in her travels like
[23:04] with ministry and stuff she found
[23:06] strange things and then she finally died
[23:09] i think and
[23:09] her bus crashed i think it's funny how
[23:12] she died right
[23:14] but all of it drove her to god and and
[23:16] she's almost kind of like the fanny
[23:18] crosby of today of the 20th century
[23:21] anyway so i give all that to say
[23:25] that she wrote this song and she wasn't
[23:27] talking out of her head
[23:33] the only other thing i want to add to
[23:34] this is she writes the line in here
[23:36] because she was rejected
[23:38] and she says i go to the stone that the
[23:40] builders rejected
[23:41] i just love that line there's a lot of
[23:43] good lies in the summit this is my
[23:44] favorite anyway
[23:49] [Music]
[23:52] where do i go
[23:56] when there's no one else to turn to
[23:59] who do i talk to when there's no one who
[24:05] wants to listen to
[24:07] the while in on

[35:26] on the eighth day
[35:27] shall be a sabbath i mean just let's
[35:29] keep reading i don't have it in my
[35:30] screen here but just reading it in there
[35:32] i wanted to continue
[35:33] just so you'll you'll recognize some
[35:36] things when i reference them later verse
[35:37] 40 says and ye shall take on you the
[35:39] first day
[35:40] the bows of goodly trees and branches of
[35:42] palm trees and the bowels of thick trees
[35:44] and the willows of the brook
[35:46] and you shall rejoice before the lord
[35:48] your god seven days
[35:49] and you shall keep it a feast unto the
[35:51] lord seven days in the year
[35:53] it shall be a statute for ever in your
[35:55] generations
[35:56] you shall celebrate it in the seventh
[35:58] moon ye shall dwell in booths
[36:00] seven days uh all that are israelites
[36:03] born shall dwell in booths
[36:05] that your generations may know that i
[36:07] made the children of israel to dwell in
[36:09] booths
[36:10] when i brought them out of the land of
[36:11] egypt i am the lord your god
[36:14] and moses declared unto the children of
[36:16] israel the feasts
[36:17] of the lord amen you can have your seats
[36:19] this morning may god bless the reading
[36:21] of his word
[36:22] amen we're finally going to close in on
[36:25] the last portion
[36:27] of the royal seed series so i want to
[36:29] take a title this afternoon or this
[36:31] morning on the final harvest and this is
[36:33] a part one
[36:35] so we're on the 10th part but the first
[36:37] part of the final part
[36:38] if you can keep up with that so i'm not
[36:41] sure how many services we're going to
[36:42] take probably two or three
[36:44] but this morning i just want to be
[36:45] conscientious of the people online i
[36:47] don't want to drag it out too long this
[36:49] morning
[36:49] just try and hit it hard for an hour or
[36:51] so maybe
[36:52] and we'll see where the lord will take
[36:54] us but i want to speak this morning on
[36:56] the final harvest and we're going to set
[36:58] just a foundation this morning this is
[36:59] very much just setting the stage
[37:01] for the next service or two as we
[37:02] continue on this but doing a quick round
[37:05] up we uh
[37:06] spoke initially of the germinating
[37:07] season and then where we talked about
[37:09] the predestinated believer where there
[37:11] is a seed of god inside them there's a
[37:12] seed gene of god as brother branham
[37:14] called it
[37:15] and it was an incorruptible seed it was
[37:17] that spora that peter talked about and
[37:19] he said this is incorruptible it doesn't
[37:21] recognize anything but itself
[37:23] it can only respond to something that is
[37:25] of itself and it will only feed on those
[37:27] things
[37:28] and that's the only thing that brings it
[37:29] to life and brings it to full maturity
[37:31] is the very thing that is within it
[37:33] in the first place amen and we know that
[37:35] one day god shone a light on each one of
[37:37] our lives
[37:38] there's some maybe he hasn't shot it on
[37:39] yet just in that way you know but if you
[37:41] haven't accepted him as your savior if
[37:43] he hasn't filled you with the holy ghost
[37:44] but there is a day where he shines a
[37:46] light on you
[37:46] and that life springs up within your
[37:49] soul and that is god's life within you
[37:50] that he placed in there
[37:51] from the very beginning amen then we
[37:54] moved on to the growing season we spent
[37:55] a lot of time with david
[37:57] and going through his trials and
[37:58] hardships as a young man as a teenager
[38:00] in his early 20s
[38:01] and seeing what god puts a real son or a
[38:04] daughter of god through you know and how
[38:05] he tests and tries and he puts things in
[38:07] front of you
[38:08] over and over and over again until you
[38:09] recognize what's happening you recognize
[38:11] what you're supposed to do in that
[38:13] situation then we looked at abraham the
[38:15] the
[38:16] father of our faith amen the the one who
[38:18] had the initial promise that
[38:20] applies to us and we showed all the
[38:22] struggles and the trials and the
[38:23] pitfalls he faced and yet at the end
[38:25] it was all imputed to him for
[38:27] righteousness say man god looked past
[38:28] the mistakes and the failures
[38:30] because abraham kept coming back to the
[38:32] promise kept coming back to god
[38:34] coming back to the path that he was
[38:35] supposed to be walking and god honored
[38:36] that
[38:37] and he was imputing it to his
[38:38] righteousness amen
[38:40] but amen we want to now move on to the
[38:42] final thing we talked about the growth
[38:44] we talked about the or the birth and the
[38:46] growth and now we want to talk about the
[38:47] harvest what does it look like
[38:49] when the believer is about to step into
[38:51] the fullness of the promise because even
[38:53] abraham didn't get the fullness
[38:54] i mean all of these we're looking
[38:55] forward to the scripture says in the
[38:57] book of hebrews
[38:57] they all didn't they all look forward to
[38:59] it but they never received it but now
[39:01] we're in the harvest season
[39:02] we're in the time when everything is the
[39:04] culmination of the gentile age
[39:06] and this is where we're going to see the
[39:07] final harvest we're going to see the
[39:09] final fruits
[39:10] of that promise that he gave to abraham
[39:11] that as it applies
[39:13] to the gentile church amen
[39:16] so we want to just set a bit of a
[39:17] foundation here this morning like i said
[39:20] so what is the harvest in this last age
[39:22] what does it actually look like and we
[39:23] know brother gerald's been preaching on
[39:25] it
[39:25] for for years i think and it's the
[39:28] resurrection and the rapture amen that
[39:30] is the culmination of all of this is the
[39:32] resurrection and the rapture
[39:33] but there's a period of time before
[39:35] there where the harvest is being
[39:36] gathered in and if you look in the
[39:38] scriptures it says
[39:39] you know the harvest is great and the
[39:40] laborers are few and pray that the lord
[39:42] of the harvest will send gatherers to
[39:44] you
[39:44] let send laborers to you to bring them
[39:46] in because there's a gathering that has
[39:47] to happen
[39:48] and then there's the final taking away
[39:50] amen it's gathered in
[39:51] everything else is burned but they're
[39:53] taken in and there's something that
[39:54] happens
[39:55] in that short period that final session
[39:57] there where the fruits are being
[39:58] gathered in
[39:59] amen i started in this scripture in
[40:02] leviticus which brother mark covered
[40:03] extensively through a couple services we
[40:05] know
[40:06] and i loved when he was preaching it
[40:07] because i knew this this series or this
[40:10] portion of this series was coming and he
[40:11] just placed it so beautifully there
[40:13] and i was just i wanted to be shouting
[40:15] and dancing in there because there were
[40:16] so many things that were jumping out at
[40:18] me and i knew
[40:19] i was going to be able to use it hey man
[40:21] i knew that i was going to be able to
[40:22] take that and just place it in some
[40:23] really neat things here
[40:25] so i certainly appreciate the lord
[40:26] leading them in that direction and
[40:27] laying it out so clearly
[40:29] and then i asked him for his notes
[40:30] yesterday and said hey can i just have
[40:32] them real quick
[40:33] because i want to verify some things it
[40:34] saves me a couple hours of work
[40:36] you know to do that so i appreciated
[40:38] that but it's just laid out so clearly
[40:39] and you can see so many types
[40:41] and they're beautifully of the gentile
[40:43] church in this last age amen
[40:46] and i love that we can go into the old
[40:47] testament i was talking brother gerald
[40:48] about this on thursday and
[40:50] i love how we can go into the old
[40:51] testament the new testament is is the
[40:53] new covenant
[40:54] that's really what that is and that's
[40:55] really the bride's book if we could talk
[40:57] about that's the gentile
[40:58] bride's uh set of scriptures there but
[41:01] it's all been typed through six thousand
[41:03] years amen
[41:04] and in the old testament we can go back
[41:06] and that's what paul did paul preached
[41:07] out of the old testament
[41:08] paul didn't have he was writing the new
[41:10] testament but he was preaching from the
[41:12] old testament so
[41:12] everything that we're talking about in
[41:14] the new testament we should be able to
[41:16] go back and find the types and shadows
[41:18] in the old testament
[41:19] amen and so i love how we can do that
[41:21] and we can go in and we can see
[41:22] ourselves in these things
[41:24] brother brown said if you can't see
[41:25] christ in every scripture go back and
[41:26] read it again
[41:27] and if you're a part of christ you
[41:28] should be able to see yourself in the
[41:30] same scriptures that we read
[41:31] amen so this morning i just want to
[41:33] focus more on that 39th verse because
[41:35] it's talking
[41:36] specifically it kind of wraps up this
[41:37] whole idea of the final harvest and it
[41:39] says
[41:40] also in the 15th day of the seventh
[41:42] month when ye have gathered of the fruit
[41:44] of the land
[41:45] so when the harvest is over now he says
[41:48] you'll keep a feast unto the lord seven
[41:50] days
[41:50] on the first day shall be a sabbath and
[41:53] on the eighth day
[41:55] shall be a sabbath so we see this as a
[41:56] final feast celebrating the
[41:58] harvest of the fruit of the land the
[42:00] barley harvest has come
[42:02] in the wheat harvest has come in but
[42:03] this is the fruit harvest now this is
[42:05] the scrumptious stuff this is the
[42:07] succulent stuff this is the really
[42:09] tasty stuff i mean this is where the
[42:10] real enjoyment of the food comes in if i
[42:12] could put it that way
[42:13] and then when you bring in barley what's
[42:15] barley good for it's good for your bread
[42:16] and
[42:17] and those different things your cereals
[42:19] right who's sitting here this morning
[42:20] saying i would just love a thing of
[42:22] shredded wheat
[42:23] right not if you could have your apples
[42:25] and your oranges and your strawberries
[42:26] and all these different things amen
[42:28] the grain and the barley harvest was a
[42:29] staple it was to carry you through
[42:31] and no matter what the fruit harvest did
[42:33] if you had a good grain harvest
[42:35] of the fruit of the wheat and the barley
[42:36] it'd carry you through to the next year
[42:38] and then it was a staple it had to
[42:40] happen you had to have that to
[42:42] to go through and if the drought wipe
[42:44] that out then you were hooped for the
[42:45] next year or two
[42:47] right you couldn't catch up you needed
[42:48] those staples there but then the fruit
[42:50] harvest comes and this is really the
[42:51] cherry on the top
[42:53] i mean this is where you get all the
[42:54] good fruit salads and the pies and the
[42:56] jams and everything this is the things
[42:58] that makes life more enjoyable and
[43:00] that's what we're talking about this is
[43:01] the gathering in
[43:02] of those things that are the peak of
[43:04] enjoyment they are the peak
[43:06] of all that's been done through the year
[43:08] and the thing is with grain you kind of
[43:09] just put it in
[43:10] and then it goes there you don't have to
[43:12] do anything to grain once you put it
[43:13] into the ground you plant it in the
[43:14] ground
[43:15] and as long as it it's watered then it
[43:17] comes up but with fruit you have to tend
[43:20] it
[43:20] you have to care for it amen it's not
[43:22] something that just comes out naturally
[43:23] if you leave a fruit tree to its own on
[43:25] the wild
[43:26] it won't produce nearly as much but if
[43:28] you can prune it and tend it and
[43:29] and do these things to it like we talked
[43:31] about with the vines and whatnot then
[43:33] it'll bring forth a lot more and that's
[43:34] how you get the most out of it is you
[43:36] have to carefully nurture this thing
[43:38] day in and day out week in and week out
[43:40] you don't just leave it to itself
[43:41] and we see that's what christ has done
[43:43] right as he's tending us and he's taking
[43:45] care of us through all these things
[43:46] he doesn't just plant it in and walk
[43:48] away but he's working with us
[43:50] right that's the growing season as he's
[43:51] working with us and taking all of these
[43:53] things out of our lives
[43:54] and adding in what we need so that will
[43:56] bring forth this amazing crop at the end
[43:58] you remember the parable of the the
[44:00] sower and the seeds and what is it some
[44:01] bring forth 30 60 or 90
[44:03] or 100 full but all of them bring forth
[44:05] something they've got to bring forth
[44:06] something otherwise they're cast out
[44:08] hewed down and cast into the fire amen
[44:10] but this is really a celebration time
[44:12] the final harvest and the final feast is
[44:14] a celebration time it's a time
[44:16] to kick back and enjoy the fruits of the
[44:18] labors that have gone on through the
[44:19] year
[44:20] everything's into the into the garners
[44:22] now everything's been brought in it's
[44:23] been stored up and now it's time to just
[44:25] enjoy what you've done throughout that
[44:27] year
[44:27] amen it reminds me of that scripture in
[44:30] psalms 34 where it says i will bless the
[44:32] lord at all times
[44:33] his praise shall continually be in my
[44:35] mouth this is what they'd be going
[44:37] through at that time
[44:38] my soul shall make her boast in the lord
[44:40] the humble shall hear their of and be
[44:42] glad o magnify the lord with me and let
[44:44] us exalt his name together
[44:46] i sought the lord and he heard me and
[44:49] deliver me from all my fears and many
[44:51] deliver me from drought he delivered me
[44:52] from
[44:53] pestilence he delivered me from the
[44:54] insects that were coming in and all
[44:56] these things
[44:57] he kept my stuff when the philistines
[44:59] came in and tried to take it away
[45:00] you know this is a time of remembrance
[45:02] of all that god has done that's good
[45:04] it says they looked upon him and were
[45:06] lightened and their faces were not
[45:08] ashamed
[45:09] this poor man cried and the lord heard
[45:11] him and saved him out of all of his
[45:13] troubles
[45:13] i guarantee the farmers never have a
[45:15] year where everything goes right
[45:17] and this is what they're talking about
[45:18] is it he came and he helped me and he
[45:20] brought me through it and he gave me
[45:22] what i had need of
[45:23] the angel of the lord encampeth round
[45:25] about them that fear him and delivereth
[45:27] them
[45:27] it says oh taste and see that the lord
[45:30] is good
[45:30] why blessed is the man that trusteth in
[45:33] him this is the blessings come from
[45:34] those that have trusted in him
[45:36] and looked to him and taken him at his
[45:38] word and taken him with what he said and
[45:40] said lord we're trusting in you
[45:41] it's up to you this is your work i'm
[45:43] doing what i can but we're trusting in
[45:45] you
[45:45] to give the increase it means like paul
[45:47] said you know this one watered and this
[45:49] one planted but it's god who gave the
[45:51] increase
[45:52] amen so this is the time where the proof
[45:55] of your labor comes out
[45:56] this is who proves who was sitting in
[45:58] the house through the hot summer days
[46:00] and just saying it's too hot and it's
[46:01] too sweaty and there's not enough water
[46:03] out there and i'm not going to go out
[46:04] and waste my time and waste my energy on
[46:06] this
[46:06] and the ones that fought through it and
[46:08] really just put their whole heart and
[46:09] soul
[46:10] into the land and into those trees and
[46:12] those plants and whatnot
[46:13] those are the ones that have the great
[46:15] harvest at the end amen
[46:17] so we know the natural harvest was to do
[46:18] what celebrate your work
[46:21] it was all about what you had did that
[46:22] year it was the lord that had blessed it
[46:24] but you're the one that put in the hard
[46:26] work amen
[46:27] but we're talking about a spiritual
[46:28] harvest now because we're talking about
[46:30] a gentile
[46:30] dispensation we're talking the end of
[46:32] that and so we know it's a spiritual
[46:34] work because we've been talking about a
[46:35] royal seed that's spiritual all along
[46:37] so you have a spiritual seed that was
[46:39] born that grew
[46:40] and now it's going to be harvested so
[46:42] this is not a working of our hands
[46:44] and then we may enjoy the fruits of this
[46:46] but it is not the working of our hands
[46:48] we have a work to do and we'll get into
[46:49] that probably in some other services
[46:51] it's not our work to do but it's his
[46:53] work that he's done and we're just the
[46:55] beneficiary
[46:56] of it amen this has always been a story
[46:58] of grace it's him from start to finish
[47:00] and we just happen to have a little bit
[47:02] of time and and effort and strength that
[47:03] we put into it but it doesn't add to it
[47:05] or take from it
[47:06] it just brings us into alignment with
[47:08] what he wanted in us all along amen
[47:10] but this is a celebration for the
[47:12] believer that the word has become a full
[47:14] reality
[47:14] this is the final stage and this is
[47:16] where you see in your life
[47:18] exactly what they had in that book of
[47:19] acts amen what was it the beginning
[47:21] is at the end it's the alpha omega
[47:23] principle what god was at the very
[47:24] beginning
[47:25] he is at the very end and you'll even
[47:27] see that when we talk about these
[47:28] sabbaths and that
[47:30] it was also a time to put away
[47:31] differences in wealth we talked so much
[47:34] about equality today and equity in these
[47:35] things and
[47:36] really what this was with the boost was
[47:38] this was a putting away of all the
[47:39] wealth and the trappings of life
[47:41] because we read in the scriptures there
[47:42] where they had to go out and they had to
[47:43] take good bowels
[47:45] from trees and build these little they
[47:47] calls them tabernacles but there are
[47:48] booths
[47:49] it's just tiny little rooms basically
[47:51] where they put up some posts
[47:52] try and build a little bit of shelter
[47:54] and shade from the sun
[47:56] but that was it and they had to live in
[47:57] them for seven days they didn't have
[47:59] this big celebration in their mansion on
[48:01] the hill
[48:02] you know it didn't matter if you had a
[48:03] big house a small house a big farm or a
[48:05] small farm
[48:06] everybody lived in just these little
[48:07] booths they didn't have two floors
[48:10] they didn't have multiple rooms it was
[48:12] just one big open room you didn't have
[48:13] decks or anything like that air
[48:15] conditioning nothing
[48:16] it was out there and everybody lived in
[48:18] the same thing for seven days it was
[48:19] everybody was on the same playing field
[48:21] afterwards they could go back and some
[48:23] be poor and somebody rich
[48:24] but for this final one we're all in the
[48:26] same playing field we're all in the same
[48:27] position
[48:28] we're all the same amen
[48:32] and every person they were dwelling on
[48:34] what it was when they came out of
[48:36] israel and they lived in tents it was a
[48:38] temporary nature
[48:39] of their dwelling place and whatnot and
[48:41] it was a time of simplicity and
[48:43] thanksgiving
[48:44] that's a time of simplicity it's not
[48:45] about what you have it's what you've
[48:47] been given
[48:48] and the blessings of god in your life
[48:49] amen
[48:51] now brother brown and brother mark cover
[48:52] this again uh just
[48:54] just quickly that the seven months of
[48:56] the planting and the harvest even
[48:57] season and the seven feasts within them
[48:59] represented the seven church ages
[49:01] if you go into future home then he talks
[49:03] all about that and he talks about those
[49:05] different types in the old and the new
[49:06] testament and how they reflect the
[49:07] christian walk and the christian church
[49:09] and then you have israel typed in there
[49:11] and that you had all these things and
[49:12] brother
[49:13] brother mark covered it extensive
[49:14] extensively and i don't want to go into
[49:16] that
[49:16] but the point is that we're living in
[49:18] the fall season this is where at the end
[49:20] of time
[49:20] i was talking brother mark before and he
[49:22] said you know it it's in a circle when
[49:24] you look at it on a calendar
[49:25] but from beginning to end it's you have
[49:27] the planting season
[49:29] and then you have a you had an early
[49:30] harvest of barley then you had a harvest
[49:32] of wheat and now you have a harvest of
[49:34] fruit and that's at the very end now
[49:36] we're up here now
[49:37] right in a timeline we're at the very
[49:39] very end but you've got a cluster of
[49:41] three feasts there
[49:42] and all of those matter to the bride
[49:43] they all matter to this age we're
[49:45] talking about the fruit harvest but the
[49:47] fruit harvest is surrounded by these
[49:48] three feasts and there's three things
[49:50] that happen inside of there
[49:51] i'm gonna go over them really quickly
[49:52] just as a reminder
[49:54] and then we'll push on through so we
[49:55] know the fifth one was the feast of
[49:57] trumpets
[49:58] and that was an announcement and it's a
[50:00] prophet's voice typically in the
[50:01] scriptures and for us it's malachi 4.
[50:03] right we heard a trumpet we heard a
[50:05] voice and it was the message of william
[50:07] branham restoring the people back to the
[50:08] original faith of the pentecostal
[50:10] fathers we know
[50:11] how did he do it restoration of the
[50:13] original word that's what he said he had
[50:15] to get us out of our dogmas and other
[50:16] denominations and creeds and these
[50:18] different things
[50:19] so our scripture for that is malachi 4
[50:21] verse 5 says behold i will send you
[50:23] elijah the prophet
[50:24] before the coming of the great and
[50:25] dreadful day of the lord and he shall
[50:27] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[50:29] children
[50:29] that was john the baptist in the first
[50:31] coming and the hearts of the children to
[50:33] their fathers and that was william
[50:34] branham in the second coming
[50:35] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[50:37] curse amen this is holding back a curse
[50:39] until this has to happen
[50:40] and he holds it back for the bride and
[50:42] then she goes and then he comes in and
[50:44] he does it for the jews just before it
[50:46] goes off on them as well
[50:47] so two of them have two different things
[50:49] happening we have a coming and they have
[50:51] a coming
[50:51] and he holds it off until so we can get
[50:53] gathered up into that and then he does
[50:54] the same thing
[50:55] with the jews but i want you to catch
[50:57] something here and that's that this
[50:59] season was announced with a trumpet and
[51:02] if you missed the trumpet then you
[51:04] couldn't set your calendar for the rest
[51:05] of the month
[51:06] if you didn't heed the trumpet if you
[51:09] ignored the trumpet or you didn't hear
[51:10] the trumpet
[51:11] then you wouldn't know when the feast of
[51:12] atom when the when the feast of
[51:14] atonement was
[51:15] and the feast of atonement well we'll
[51:17] get into it i won't jump into it there
[51:18] but
[51:18] needless to say if you miss the trumpet
[51:20] or if you don't listen to the trumpet
[51:21] then you're going to miss the atonement
[51:23] because you can't set your calendar
[51:24] right so then you move on to the sixth
[51:26] feast and that's the feast of atonement
[51:28] as brother mark said to the christian
[51:30] this is a time to remember that christ
[51:31] didn't just cover your sins
[51:33] but he actually took your place and
[51:35] fully paid the price
[51:36] this is a time of remembrance you should
[51:39] have already sacrificed the land
[51:41] and it's saying you got to remember what
[51:42] you did and did you do it
[51:44] as brother mark said this is a time to
[51:45] make sure that you got what you say you
[51:47] got
[51:48] right but it's it it's uh the feast of
[51:51] the trumpets for us was that prophetic
[51:53] messenger blasting out a message
[51:55] and that message said you've got to get
[51:56] back to christ you've got to get back to
[51:58] the purity of the word
[52:00] otherwise you're under a false atonement
[52:02] you're making a religious covering for
[52:04] yourself
[52:04] rather than accepting the pure blood of
[52:06] christ and you've got to get under the
[52:08] umbrella of the restored word
[52:10] now you say jonathan you're equating the
[52:12] word to the blood of christ
[52:13] but remember we're looking at christ the
[52:15] word christ is not just a man that
[52:17] walked the earth 2 000 years ago
[52:19] because before he was ever a man he was
[52:21] christ the word john 1. in the beginning
[52:23] was the word
[52:24] the word was with god the word was for
[52:26] god and the word was made flesh and
[52:27] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[52:30] so before he was ever a man he was the
[52:32] word and so you've got to recognize the
[52:34] word and that's the thing that covers
[52:35] you
[52:36] and they didn't they didn't recognize
[52:37] christ the man they missed christ the
[52:39] word
[52:40] that's what they were missing in that
[52:41] thing and so we've got the same thing
[52:43] today
[52:43] the full truth was revealed and it was
[52:45] placed in front of the people of this
[52:46] state and they had to choose again
[52:48] all over again he said you can stay in
[52:50] your denominations
[52:51] you can stay with your creeds you can
[52:53] stay with your fellowships and guess
[52:54] what you can stay with your signs and
[52:56] wonders and speaking in tongues and
[52:57] people running around and shouting and
[52:59] dancing
[53:00] or you can have the revealed word and
[53:01] that will be in it to a degree
[53:03] but you got to take the full word and he
[53:05] says now you've got to make the choice
[53:07] and they didn't they they turned it down
[53:10] they turned it down
[53:11] it reminds me of hebrews 6 they tasted a
[53:14] part of the word right they were it's a
[53:15] restoration
[53:16] so they had a taste of the holy ghost
[53:18] brother brown said they
[53:19] they took the gifts and they refused the
[53:21] giver there was a portion there they
[53:23] tasted of it
[53:24] but they didn't get the full measure and
[53:25] in hebrews 6 it says for it is
[53:28] impossible for those who were once
[53:30] enlightened
[53:30] and have tasted of the heavenly gift and
[53:33] were made partakers of the holy ghost
[53:35] and have tasted the good word of god and
[53:37] the powers of the world to come that's
[53:38] azusa street all over
[53:40] they were sincere there was nothing
[53:42] wrong with the
[53:43] azusa street that was exactly god's
[53:45] moving there there was nothing wrong
[53:46] but they refused to come forward after
[53:49] that those people that were in azusa
[53:50] seat the original ones they're going
[53:52] their bride they were but what happened
[53:55] was they denominated
[53:56] and they stayed with the gifts and they
[53:58] would not go into the word again
[54:00] it says if they shall fall away to renew
[54:02] themselves again to repentance
[54:04] seeing they crucified to themselves the
[54:06] son of god afresh and put them to an
[54:07] open shame
[54:08] that blah blah says this is proof that
[54:10] if you have the fullness of the holy
[54:11] ghost if you've been sealed
[54:12] you cannot fall away but he says you can
[54:15] taste it you can have a portion
[54:16] it can fall on your body it can fall on
[54:18] your spirit that's a taste of it
[54:20] but it's not a sealing of it it's a
[54:22] taste of it and when you do that and
[54:24] then walk away he says there's no more
[54:25] you can't repent after that you've
[54:27] turned away that
[54:28] and you've crucified the son of god
[54:31] afresh amen you have to recognize the
[54:33] word
[54:34] not a man right you don't have to
[54:36] recognize a prophet you don't have to
[54:37] recognize a sermon you don't have to
[54:39] recognize a ministry
[54:40] you have to recognize the word because
[54:42] the word comes in so many different
[54:43] forms
[54:44] once that prophet left we've got a five
[54:45] full ministry to pull it through
[54:47] right that are bringing it to the people
[54:49] but we've got church members that are
[54:50] the word the exact same way
[54:52] and your neighbors and your co-workers
[54:53] have to recognize the word in you if
[54:54] they never hear it over a pulpit
[54:56] right there's many things that they have
[54:57] to recognize so they may say i never
[54:59] went to a message church how do you
[55:00] indict me
[55:01] and he'll say but you had mark coffey
[55:03] that was the word
[55:05] you didn't have to see a man you had to
[55:06] see the word in mark coffee amen
[55:08] that's what he's talking about what is
[55:11] it the people won't accept the fullness
[55:12] of the word and brother branham comes
[55:14] through in 1963 and he says i indict
[55:16] this generation
[55:17] for the second crucifixion of jesus
[55:19] christ he says and now upon this basis i
[55:22] challenge this generation of the
[55:23] crucifixion of jesus christ
[55:25] for crucifying and guilty with dirty
[55:28] wicked
[55:28] selfish denominational hands has
[55:31] crucified the prince of life
[55:32] that wanted to present itself to the
[55:34] people and you say the same person
[55:37] he says in the beginning was the word
[55:38] and the word was god and the word was
[55:40] made flesh and manifested itself
[55:41] the word was manifested in flesh and
[55:44] they condemned the flesh and put it to
[55:45] death because the word was manifested
[55:47] hebrews 13 8 said jesus christ is the
[55:49] same yesterday today and forever
[55:51] it's the same word see and for the same
[55:53] reason they are trying to crucify the
[55:55] word
[55:55] the same reason why did they do it
[55:57] initially it was jealousy
[55:58] right he had what they didn't have he
[56:00] had what they had talked about what they
[56:02] had prayed about
[56:03] what they had seen in the scriptures and
[56:04] he came and we talked about it just last
[56:06] last service he healed the blind man and
[56:09] they said who did this
[56:11] jesus did it this man must be from god
[56:13] they put him out because he identified
[56:15] him with
[56:15] with with god right he did what they
[56:18] were looking for messiah to do in terms
[56:20] of the power
[56:21] but they couldn't recognize him in the
[56:22] flesh amen and he says they're doing the
[56:24] same thing today and that's what
[56:25] happened with william branham
[56:26] was god's there using that vessel and he
[56:29] gives the full messiah
[56:30] sign start to finish you can't you can't
[56:32] say anything other
[56:33] than that he showed the full messiah
[56:35] sign right he could lay his hand on you
[56:37] or he could stand back and he could turn
[56:39] around not look at you and he could walk
[56:40] through that audience boom boom boom
[56:42] scripture says jesus knowing their
[56:44] hearts right knowing their thoughts he
[56:46] didn't have to touch them
[56:47] and we had that same thing happen in
[56:48] this day and people look at it and say
[56:50] yeah but his doctrine's wrong no it says
[56:53] he says if you don't believe my
[56:54] my words believe my works and you have
[56:56] the works coming over and they couldn't
[56:58] accept it it was the word coming forth
[57:00] in power and demonstration not just in
[57:02] word and they turned it down because
[57:03] they were jealous
[57:04] because he didn't identify with them he
[57:06] didn't acknowledge them
[57:08] the job was for them to acknowledge the
[57:09] word not the word to acknowledge them
[57:11] when they acknowledge the word then the
[57:12] word comes back around says that's my
[57:14] son that's my daughter but he doesn't
[57:15] acknowledge you first and say you're my
[57:17] son
[57:17] you have to say you're my father and
[57:18] then he says i'm your son
[57:20] right you're my son but despite this
[57:24] there were people that said that's me
[57:26] right there was that eagle that mother
[57:28] eagle flying overhead and they said
[57:29] that's me
[57:30] i identify with that that's what i've
[57:32] been looking for and man that's how this
[57:33] church started brother mark amen
[57:34] he's sitting there and he says this is
[57:36] it this is it
[57:38] and then from that we have everything
[57:40] grow up because one person recognizes
[57:42] and then all of a sudden
[57:43] that eagle scream is going out and other
[57:44] people are hearing it and other people
[57:45] are hearing it
[57:46] and pretty soon you've got a body of
[57:47] believers here because one person
[57:49] recognized who they were
[57:50] god comes down and confirms that all of
[57:51] a sudden we get the growth that we did
[57:53] amen
[57:54] amen then the third feast so we had the
[57:58] the feast of the trumpets then they had
[57:59] the feast of atonement
[58:00] that's a time to make sure that's the
[58:02] time to make your calling an election
[58:04] sure
[58:04] that's what we're talking about here
[58:05] like brother mark said to make sure that
[58:07] what you say you got
[58:08] is what you got then the seventh feast
[58:10] is the feast of tabernacles and that is
[58:12] supposed to be the dwelling place for
[58:13] god
[58:14] and it's made from temporary frail
[58:15] materials amen this is temporary frail
[58:18] materials that we're talking about amen
[58:20] we're in sinful bodies
[58:21] sinful flesh unredeemed minds unredeemed
[58:24] spirits unredeemed
[58:25] bodies amen but we've got a soul that's
[58:27] redeemed but
[58:28] inside of this is where god dwells and
[58:30] it's a temporary dwelling
[58:31] amen he won't dwell in this forever
[58:33] right there won't always be this
[58:34] contentiousness that's here that's why
[58:36] he gives us a new body
[58:37] so it'll take the contentiousness away
[58:39] amen but those people that have made
[58:41] their calling election sure that are
[58:42] under
[58:43] the blood of the word amen those are the
[58:45] ones that come into this feast of
[58:46] tabernacles
[58:47] and this is where the fruits come in now
[58:48] and this is where they get that
[58:49] enjoyment
[58:50] that's when they get that rest and
[58:51] that's when they get to kick their feet
[58:53] up
[58:53] now don't take me wrong we've talked
[58:55] about battles and battles and battles
[58:56] all through the series
[58:57] kicking your feet up does not mean that
[59:00] there's no battles
[59:01] what it means is that your soul is at
[59:02] rest and we'll touch on that shortly
[59:04] amen
[59:05] brother braham says this again we're
[59:08] speaking of the feast of tabernacles and
[59:09] what it takes to be in there he says the
[59:11] requirement of him today
[59:13] is the blood of his own son jesus christ
[59:16] the token
[59:16] and the token of the holy ghost we
[59:19] haven't got it we might be baptist
[59:21] presbyterian lutheran pentecostals
[59:23] whatever we might be
[59:24] we might shout scream and be also
[59:26] educated that has not one thing to do
[59:27] with it
[59:28] you must present the token which is the
[59:30] holy ghost
[59:31] he says then when you present the token
[59:33] you are a subject
[59:35] for the resurrection because the
[59:36] resurrecting power
[59:38] is already in you like i said when we
[59:41] talked about healing the other day and
[59:42] we had that
[59:43] i don't know if it's still here or not
[59:44] no it's not so we had the body here and
[59:46] every
[59:46] we were talking about looking at healing
[59:48] and deliverance and all these things and
[59:49] it's outside of you
[59:50] he says no you're a candidate because
[59:52] it's in there you're subject to it
[59:54] because it's already in you and that's
[59:56] the recognition that we have now is the
[59:57] fruits of the spirit
[59:58] are going to bring resurrecting and
[1:00:00] quickening power in our lives
[1:00:02] he says the token is the resurrection
[1:00:04] power
[1:00:05] showing that jesus raised up from the
[1:00:07] dead because if he didn't raise he
[1:00:08] couldn't give life to us
[1:00:09] but because he lives we live also right
[1:00:11] in the same life that's in him is in us
[1:00:13] and that's the thing that quickens our
[1:00:14] mortal bodies he says and you are raised
[1:00:17] from the dead the dead things of
[1:00:18] unbelief
[1:00:19] and has been made alive in the word of
[1:00:21] jesus christ
[1:00:22] you believe it and the word lives
[1:00:24] through you it's so simple you believe
[1:00:26] it
[1:00:26] and the word lives through you because
[1:00:28] there's a life inside of you to make it
[1:00:29] live in the first place amen
[1:00:31] all of these feasts are part of the
[1:00:33] fruit harvest and you have to be in all
[1:00:35] three
[1:00:36] to get through to the final in you miss
[1:00:38] one then the clock goes off and all of a
[1:00:39] sudden you're not in the right place at
[1:00:40] the right time but the key point now is
[1:00:42] that we are in
[1:00:43] the feast of the tabernacles this is the
[1:00:45] very end of all this we've already heard
[1:00:47] the message
[1:00:48] right we've already had the word and
[1:00:49] we've already accepted the word we're
[1:00:50] under the shed blood
[1:00:52] we've accepted christ the word for our
[1:00:53] day and now he's dwelling with us in
[1:00:56] frail tabernacles amen and once this is
[1:00:59] over
[1:01:00] the gentile dispensation is over there's
[1:01:01] nothing to come after this it's done
[1:01:03] it's done it's done the rapture happens
[1:01:06] the resurrection happens
[1:01:07] we're gone and he's back to the jews and
[1:01:08] that's a totally different situation all
[1:01:10] over again amen
[1:01:12] but if we look at this and just to read
[1:01:14] this scripture and i'll just put it up
[1:01:15] there for reference
[1:01:17] it happens this feast of tabernacles it
[1:01:19] happens across eight days
[1:01:20] but you notice it starts with a sabbath
[1:01:23] and it ends with a sabbath
[1:01:25] right and if you don't enter a sabbath
[1:01:27] at the beginning you don't enter into a
[1:01:29] sabbath at an end
[1:01:30] right you've got to be in the sabbath at
[1:01:31] the start to be at the sabbath at the
[1:01:33] end you've got to be in the rest at the
[1:01:34] beginning
[1:01:35] to have rest at the end amen and we know
[1:01:37] the sabbath was a rest day and how do we
[1:01:39] enter into that
[1:01:40] there's a rest that is for specifically
[1:01:42] for the believer
[1:01:43] amen matthew 11 jesus said come unto me
[1:01:46] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[1:01:48] and i will give you rest there's a
[1:01:50] promise now he
[1:01:51] takes it a step further in verse 29 he
[1:01:53] says take my yoke upon you
[1:01:55] and learn of me for i am meek and lowly
[1:01:57] in heart and ye shall find rest
[1:01:59] unto your souls not just rest but he
[1:02:02] says rest
[1:02:02] unto your souls and that's the rest that
[1:02:05] we're looking for
[1:02:06] there's only one rest and that's when
[1:02:07] your soul is sealed with the holy spirit
[1:02:10] amen like i said we've been talking
[1:02:11] about the battle that we face and so
[1:02:13] this rest is not in the body this rest
[1:02:15] is not in the mind this rest is not in
[1:02:17] the spirit
[1:02:17] but it's a soul rest that we're entering
[1:02:20] into not a body rest
[1:02:21] amen we still get old we still get sick
[1:02:23] we still get tired and we still have the
[1:02:24] frustrations of life and all these
[1:02:26] things
[1:02:26] satan is continually coming against us
[1:02:28] but he says you will find rest unto your
[1:02:30] souls
[1:02:31] and it's because it's sealed to the day
[1:02:32] of your full redemption which is the
[1:02:34] rapture and the resurrection amen
[1:02:37] and once we go through that period of
[1:02:38] time after those seven days
[1:02:40] we go into the eighth date and that's
[1:02:42] another period of rest
[1:02:44] and brother brown takes this and brother
[1:02:45] mark pointed out and brother brahm says
[1:02:47] there is no eight day he says on the
[1:02:50] calendar there's only seven days in the
[1:02:51] week there is no eight day
[1:02:53] he says you come back to the first he
[1:02:54] says and it's the loop of eternity he
[1:02:56] says now you've stepped right back into
[1:02:58] eternity
[1:02:58] and we're back with god we're back at
[1:03:00] the beginning we're back where we
[1:03:01] started we're in the same condition we
[1:03:03] were
[1:03:03] but you've got to be in that first rest
[1:03:05] so you can set the timing for the second
[1:03:06] rest
[1:03:07] amen because he says we're we'll still
[1:03:09] be in the we'll still be in the in the
[1:03:10] feast of tabernacles he said in the
[1:03:12] millennium
[1:03:13] he says it's only after the millennium
[1:03:15] he says that we step into the fullness
[1:03:17] of rest because there's no more things
[1:03:19] that happen after the millennium amen
[1:03:20] there's no more battles and everything
[1:03:22] there's still one last battle at the end
[1:03:24] and then we go into a perfect union with
[1:03:26] christ amen
[1:03:27] so he says we'll still be in there for
[1:03:29] that time but you have to be in that
[1:03:30] initial rest which is the sealing of the
[1:03:32] holy spirit
[1:03:33] of your soul to get all the way through
[1:03:35] to the end amen
[1:03:36] brother braham says this the feast of
[1:03:38] tabernacles was the last feast the
[1:03:40] seventh feast
[1:03:41] we're worshiping now under the feast of
[1:03:42] tabernacles the seventh church age
[1:03:44] he says in the millennium will be under
[1:03:46] the feast of tabernacles again
[1:03:48] in the seventh day but then after the
[1:03:50] seventh day we have a holy convocation
[1:03:52] and we go back
[1:03:53] into the eternal how by the eternal one
[1:03:55] that came and redeemed us and taken us
[1:03:57] back
[1:03:58] letting us recognize that we were part
[1:04:00] of this he's pointing back to your
[1:04:02] identity and says this is your
[1:04:03] this is him proving that you always were
[1:04:05] a part of this you always were an
[1:04:07] eternity you always were a part of god
[1:04:09] he says now how do you know you're a
[1:04:10] part that's a good question
[1:04:13] how do you know you're a part of this he
[1:04:14] says because at the word of the hour
[1:04:17] the promise of the day what is it a
[1:04:19] restoration
[1:04:20] back to the first day the first
[1:04:23] and he shall restore the hearts of the
[1:04:25] children back to the fathers that's
[1:04:26] malachi 4 5
[1:04:28] bringing a restoration again of the
[1:04:30] pentecostal genuine
[1:04:32] not sensations what he means is not only
[1:04:36] sensations
[1:04:37] because you'll still have sensations i
[1:04:38] have sensations sitting in here
[1:04:40] listening to the song service or sister
[1:04:41] mooring doing a special or
[1:04:43] something like that sensations don't go
[1:04:44] away but he says it's not only sensation
[1:04:46] it's not based on sensations
[1:04:48] and says and will manifest so the
[1:04:51] pentecostal genuine and will manifest
[1:04:53] the evening
[1:04:54] light the same sun that showed in the
[1:04:56] morning light as promised for this day
[1:04:57] he says
[1:04:58] amen and amen so be it so be it alpha
[1:05:01] and omega
[1:05:01] beginning and end amen amen he says
[1:05:05] how do you know you're a part of it if
[1:05:06] you have the genuine pentecostal
[1:05:08] experience
[1:05:09] the same things that they did you do the
[1:05:11] same faith that they had
[1:05:13] you had the same attitude they had you
[1:05:15] have the same life that they have
[1:05:17] you have all of these things if you
[1:05:20] can't place yourself in the scriptures
[1:05:21] for
[1:05:22] the pentecostal day the original
[1:05:23] pentecost then you're lacking something
[1:05:26] now you say today i don't have what they
[1:05:28] all have yes but we're in a restoration
[1:05:31] he's bringing us back to the fullness
[1:05:33] now you may see sparks of it here and
[1:05:35] there and everything
[1:05:36] but the thing is if we go back to the
[1:05:37] fullness they were in perfect unity
[1:05:39] there
[1:05:39] the holy spirit was moving it was
[1:05:40] keeping the church clean it was keeping
[1:05:42] sin out
[1:05:43] it was convicting but it was moving in
[1:05:45] their services it was healing it was
[1:05:47] delivering all these things were
[1:05:48] happening
[1:05:49] but we're being restored back to that
[1:05:52] and so you're seeing sparks of that and
[1:05:53] just here and there and everywhere
[1:05:55] right you see these miraculous healings
[1:05:57] and deliverances and
[1:05:58] and what going on that's all a part of
[1:06:00] it but the thing is that they lived a
[1:06:02] life despite all the persecution despite
[1:06:04] all that was against them
[1:06:06] but the signs and wonders still have to
[1:06:07] be there as well we don't get to write
[1:06:09] that out of the scripture
[1:06:10] it's all part of it and it's a
[1:06:11] restoration back so don't look at it and
[1:06:14] say well i don't have that so i'm not
[1:06:15] going in the rapture
[1:06:16] no it's a restoring work we're coming
[1:06:18] back to the fullness amen and it's in a
[1:06:19] body of believers not just
[1:06:21] in one of us brother braham says this he
[1:06:24] says thy word is the truth
[1:06:26] and every man that'll read the bible and
[1:06:27] believe every word that bible says
[1:06:29] and follow its instructions now don't
[1:06:32] just stop there
[1:06:33] lots of people say they're doing that
[1:06:35] and receive the same holy ghost that
[1:06:37] they received
[1:06:39] right do what it says follow its
[1:06:41] instructions and receive the same holy
[1:06:43] ghost that they received
[1:06:44] the same way they received it because
[1:06:46] you've got lots of people saying today
[1:06:48] i've got the holy ghost and they haven't
[1:06:49] followed acts 2 38.
[1:06:51] right they haven't so they don't have
[1:06:53] the same holy ghost
[1:06:54] they've got a different spirit on them
[1:06:56] and so he says you've got to
[1:06:58] do what it says follow its instructions
[1:07:00] receive the same holy ghost
[1:07:02] the same way they received it with the
[1:07:03] same results they received it the same
[1:07:05] power they got when they received it
[1:07:07] he knows who his mom and papa is that's
[1:07:10] a long list
[1:07:12] that's a long list and god help us
[1:07:14] because we can't make this happen in and
[1:07:16] of ourselves this is a restoring work
[1:07:18] and it's up to him to do it in us now
[1:07:21] that person he says he knows he's washed
[1:07:23] in the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:25] born of the spirit filled with god's
[1:07:27] unction
[1:07:28] he knows where he's standing sure he's
[1:07:30] in canaan
[1:07:31] he knows where he come from he says
[1:07:33] that's the way it is with a real
[1:07:34] christian
[1:07:35] ask him ask her have you received the
[1:07:38] holy ghost since you believed
[1:07:40] and the answer is amen brother i have
[1:07:44] i have received the same thing they've
[1:07:45] got i've got the same thing they've got
[1:07:47] i've got the same holy spirit living
[1:07:49] and working in me amen you don't want to
[1:07:52] miss that
[1:07:53] you can't miss that you have to have it
[1:07:56] this is the token that brother brown
[1:07:57] spoke about
[1:07:58] you have to present the token it is the
[1:07:59] holy ghost the exact
[1:08:01] same way that they had it at pentecost
[1:08:04] the exact same way there's no excuses
[1:08:07] we've got the full word revealed
[1:08:08] there's no place for ignorance anymore
[1:08:10] so all that's left to us is to believe
[1:08:12] it
[1:08:12] if you believe it and accept it and obey
[1:08:14] it he says then it'll follow all the way
[1:08:16] through for you amen
[1:08:18] our baptism of the holy spirit and their
[1:08:20] baptism of the holy spirit should be
[1:08:22] exactly the same thing they meant
[1:08:24] so each one of us has a portion
[1:08:26] sometimes we look in there and we see
[1:08:27] the apostles walking around we think
[1:08:28] that's got to be me
[1:08:30] guess what that's pressure for the
[1:08:31] ministry if i could put it that way
[1:08:33] because they're the apostles
[1:08:34] they're the ministers of the day right
[1:08:36] but you don't see
[1:08:37] dorcas going around laying hands on
[1:08:39] people but what do you see
[1:08:41] you see the power of the holy spirit
[1:08:42] raising dorcas from the dead some of us
[1:08:44] have to be the ones that are lifting up
[1:08:46] and some of us have to be the ones that
[1:08:47] are laying their hands on right there's
[1:08:49] a portion for each and like we talked
[1:08:50] about in the last service some of these
[1:08:52] things are honest so that the works of
[1:08:53] god could be manifested in our life amen
[1:08:56] some of us have to be the ones that are
[1:08:57] afflicted and some of us have to be the
[1:08:58] ones that are bringing that deliverance
[1:09:00] it's not me right it's not a minute not
[1:09:02] a minister it's the power of god working
[1:09:04] in those men
[1:09:05] or those women as the case may be to do
[1:09:07] the works of god in this day amen
[1:09:09] i think sometimes we think that they're
[1:09:11] running around laying hands on everybody
[1:09:12] and they had eight million
[1:09:13] you know healings throughout the church
[1:09:15] there no
[1:09:16] no we see a period of years over there
[1:09:18] and you might see 5 or 10 or 15 miracles
[1:09:21] that are written about
[1:09:21] that doesn't mean there weren't more but
[1:09:23] that wasn't all of their life
[1:09:25] paul didn't come around and start laying
[1:09:26] hands on everybody and doing miracles
[1:09:28] paul came and preached the word right
[1:09:31] then when eutychus fell out the window
[1:09:33] because he was preaching such a long
[1:09:34] time he laid hands on him
[1:09:35] and he was raised from the dead and then
[1:09:37] what did he do he went back to preaching
[1:09:39] today if we raised from the dead it
[1:09:40] would blow the church up we wouldn't be
[1:09:42] able to sit still
[1:09:43] brother gerald would have to sit down
[1:09:45] because we wouldn't allow him to
[1:09:46] continue anymore
[1:09:46] and paul went down laid hands on him
[1:09:48] raised him up and then went back to
[1:09:49] laying in the word for the people
[1:09:51] because that's what they needed right
[1:09:52] the holy spirit was there to do the work
[1:09:54] that was required and then it went right
[1:09:55] back to bringing those people into
[1:09:56] alignment
[1:09:57] into the revelation of the word so that
[1:09:58] they would live it out in a better and
[1:10:00] better way
[1:10:01] right he was bringing them deeper and
[1:10:02] deeper into christ the works are there
[1:10:04] to support the church
[1:10:06] but they are not there to define the
[1:10:07] church if i could put it that way the
[1:10:09] definition is
[1:10:10] is to be in the word is to live the word
[1:10:12] in every part
[1:10:13] and aspect of it amen
[1:10:17] what is it it's this place of rest is
[1:10:19] the leadership of the holy spirit that's
[1:10:21] quickening the word for us today
[1:10:23] making us not only hearers but doers of
[1:10:25] the word
[1:10:26] because if he's leading us then we've
[1:10:27] got confidence amen if we can say
[1:10:30] he is the one that's doing this i would
[1:10:31] not step out this way
[1:10:33] i would not do this of my own free will
[1:10:35] i would not make such a statement
[1:10:37] i remember brother ron spencer talking
[1:10:38] to him or he actually mentioned this
[1:10:40] over the pulpit
[1:10:41] and he said you know when he talked
[1:10:42] about certain things and and he
[1:10:44] prophesied and said something was going
[1:10:46] to happen
[1:10:46] and then he went into the office and he
[1:10:48] said why did i
[1:10:50] say that and he said
[1:10:53] but i didn't say it that's why i said he
[1:10:54] said the holy spirit spoke through me
[1:10:56] and that's why i said it and then it
[1:10:58] takes five years for that to come to
[1:10:59] pass and
[1:11:00] every day every month something worse
[1:11:02] happens to make what he said more and
[1:11:03] more impossible to come to pass
[1:11:05] and then five years later all of a
[1:11:06] sudden there the miracle is and it's
[1:11:07] happened
[1:11:08] why because the holy spoke it holy
[1:11:10] spirit spoke it not ron spencer
[1:11:12] that's the same thing we're doing when
[1:11:13] we step out in faith when i come up
[1:11:15] behind this pulpit it is 100
[1:11:17] by faith because it's foolishness
[1:11:19] otherwise like i prayed at the beginning
[1:11:21] i can prepare and study but if he
[1:11:22] doesn't come and quicken it
[1:11:23] it makes no difference and we'll have a
[1:11:25] dead denomination in this church
[1:11:27] all day long same thing for brother
[1:11:28] gerald if the spirit does not come
[1:11:30] and quicken it then it is dead dead dead
[1:11:33] it will only convict us
[1:11:34] and it will indict us but it will not
[1:11:36] make us live but if the spirit's there
[1:11:37] to quicken it
[1:11:38] then we've got something now that he can
[1:11:39] use amen that's what we're looking for
[1:11:41] and that's where our confidence is is
[1:11:42] not that i'm doing it it's that he's
[1:11:44] doing it through me
[1:11:46] amen paul talks about this rest in
[1:11:49] hebrews 4. he says let us therefore fear
[1:11:51] lest the promise be left of us
[1:11:53] of entering into his rest any of you
[1:11:55] should seem to come short of it
[1:11:57] he says there's a promise there make
[1:11:58] sure you don't stop short
[1:12:00] make sure you get all the way into this
[1:12:01] rest for unto us was the gospel preached
[1:12:04] as well as unto them
[1:12:05] now he says us is those that have
[1:12:07] received it he says as well as unto them
[1:12:09] which was the jews but the word preached
[1:12:11] did not profit them
[1:12:13] not being mixed with faith in them that
[1:12:14] heard it for we which have believed do
[1:12:17] enter into rest as he said as i have
[1:12:20] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[1:12:21] into my rest
[1:12:22] though the works were finished from the
[1:12:24] foundation of the world
[1:12:25] for he spoke in a certain place of the
[1:12:27] seventh day
[1:12:29] in this wise and god to rest the seventh
[1:12:31] day from all his works
[1:12:32] and in this place again if they shall
[1:12:34] enter into my rest
[1:12:35] he's saying god's talked about arrest
[1:12:36] all through scriptures and he's talked
[1:12:38] about those that won't enter in and
[1:12:39] those that will enter in and he says
[1:12:41] it's all been finished from the
[1:12:42] foundation of the world
[1:12:44] right so it wasn't a surprise to god
[1:12:45] when the children of israel turned their
[1:12:46] backs on canaan
[1:12:48] he knew right but there is still a place
[1:12:50] of rest and there's a people
[1:12:51] if there's a place of rest there must be
[1:12:53] a people of rest as well
[1:12:55] he says verse six seen therefore it
[1:12:58] remaineth that some must enter therein
[1:13:00] so you're saying there's still more to
[1:13:01] come not just that we've entered into it
[1:13:03] now
[1:13:04] in his time paul's time but this is an
[1:13:06] ongoing promise this is more than just
[1:13:07] for them
[1:13:08] in that day there's more going to come
[1:13:10] into this rest
[1:13:11] and they to whom it was first preached
[1:13:13] entered not in because of unbelief
[1:13:16] again he limiteth a certain day saying
[1:13:17] and david today after so long a time as
[1:13:20] it is said today
[1:13:21] if ye will hear his voice harden not
[1:13:24] your hearts
[1:13:25] for if jesus had given them rest then
[1:13:27] would he not afterward have spoken of
[1:13:28] another day
[1:13:30] he said if it happened in jesus day then
[1:13:32] he wouldn't appoint it to another day
[1:13:33] and it's the one that we read right he
[1:13:35] says i will give you rest
[1:13:37] therefore there remain or there
[1:13:39] remaineth therefore a rest
[1:13:42] to the people of god for he that is
[1:13:45] entered into
[1:13:46] his rest he also has ceased from his own
[1:13:49] works
[1:13:50] as god did from his that's the rest of
[1:13:52] the believer that it's not me but it's
[1:13:53] christ in me doing it i have ceased from
[1:13:55] my own dead works
[1:13:56] my own desires my own ideas my own
[1:13:59] imaginations all these different things
[1:14:01] i've died from that
[1:14:02] and it's christ that's living in me
[1:14:03] right now and in verse 16 he says let us
[1:14:06] therefore come boldly
[1:14:07] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:14:10] obtain mercy
[1:14:12] and find grace to help in time of need
[1:14:15] why because it's not your work you're
[1:14:17] coming to him you're saying you called
[1:14:19] me
[1:14:19] you chose me now i'm coming to you to
[1:14:22] finish the work
[1:14:22] because i definitely can't do this on my
[1:14:24] own and then i can't do it on my own
[1:14:26] but when i am quick and when that
[1:14:27] quickening power comes down then i say i
[1:14:29] can do all things through
[1:14:30] christ that strengthens me amen i'm
[1:14:33] recognizing my place in him and i can
[1:14:34] step forward in that faith
[1:14:37] now you say why are we talking about
[1:14:38] rest we're preaching on the harvest
[1:14:40] season
[1:14:40] but the harvest season is is finished in
[1:14:43] rest
[1:14:44] it is a time of enjoyment it is a time
[1:14:47] of
[1:14:47] of taking in the good things that have
[1:14:49] come through and you have to enter into
[1:14:51] a rest where you recognize that it's
[1:14:52] god's blessing and god's work and that's
[1:14:54] not you
[1:14:54] and that's when you can relax that's the
[1:14:56] time when you can say
[1:14:58] it's been him all along because when i
[1:15:00] compare myself to the other one right
[1:15:02] next to me
[1:15:03] whether it's the person at work whether
[1:15:04] it maybe it's the person in the family
[1:15:06] they've got the same genetics or they've
[1:15:07] got the same skills the same education
[1:15:09] this that and the other
[1:15:10] thing and i've got something that they
[1:15:12] don't have
[1:15:13] and that's only because of christ amen
[1:15:16] but it's only going to be a small bit of
[1:15:18] time that this happens
[1:15:19] we're talking about a restoration at the
[1:15:21] very end because the rest the initial
[1:15:22] one didn't last that long
[1:15:24] right and then and then john said you
[1:15:26] left your first love
[1:15:27] right 60 years was it something like
[1:15:29] that 50 years 40 years whatever didn't
[1:15:30] last that long
[1:15:31] it's going to be much more compressed
[1:15:33] here because the tendency will be
[1:15:35] to do what they always did and that's
[1:15:37] nominate it right build up clicks build
[1:15:39] up crews whatever it's going to be
[1:15:40] and move on with it he's going to do a
[1:15:42] quick short work romans 9 28
[1:15:44] says for he will finish the work and cut
[1:15:47] it short
[1:15:47] in righteousness because a short work
[1:15:51] will the lord
[1:15:52] make upon the earth amen and you're
[1:15:54] going to have ministers that are just
[1:15:55] like the apostles
[1:15:57] in pentecost you're going to have
[1:15:58] deacons that were like the deacons
[1:15:59] you're going to have prayer warriors and
[1:16:00] faithful people just like they did
[1:16:02] and then peter's in jail and they all
[1:16:04] get together and they're praying and all
[1:16:05] of a sudden
[1:16:06] the doors are open for peter amen
[1:16:07] there's a massive deliverance there and
[1:16:09] walks them through what was it three or
[1:16:10] four gates i think
[1:16:11] three or four sets that all had to open
[1:16:13] up for him and he walked through boom
[1:16:14] boom boom every single one
[1:16:15] knocks on the door and she thinks it's a
[1:16:17] ghost
[1:16:18] she was probably the less faithful one
[1:16:22] you're praying for it and it comes to
[1:16:23] your door and you say you're dead you
[1:16:24] know it's uh
[1:16:25] it doesn't really encourage you maybe
[1:16:27] amen
[1:16:28] but uh i'm trusting we're not all like
[1:16:30] rhoda amen
[1:16:32] but what is it it's alpha and omega
[1:16:33] god's restoring us back to the exact
[1:16:35] same thing
[1:16:36] and you'll see the mighty works but you
[1:16:38] also see the humility
[1:16:39] you'll see that subjection to the spirit
[1:16:42] where they're lifting up because
[1:16:43] everything they did they say we do in
[1:16:45] the name of jesus christ
[1:16:47] we don't do in the name of jonathan
[1:16:48] corlett or gerald lush right it is all
[1:16:51] in the name of jesus christ
[1:16:52] whether it's singing it's in the name of
[1:16:54] jesus christ whether it's going to work
[1:16:56] it's in the name of jesus christ
[1:16:58] whatever it is it's all in the name of
[1:17:00] jesus christ and they testified daily
[1:17:02] of jesus christ jesus christ jesus
[1:17:04] christ they took nothing
[1:17:05] to themselves right paul said i'm the
[1:17:08] least among you
[1:17:09] he's the apostle for the age he's the
[1:17:11] prophet of the age he says i'm the least
[1:17:12] among you i was the worst sinner of all
[1:17:13] of you
[1:17:14] right he did not even he couldn't even
[1:17:16] see himself being lifted up in that way
[1:17:18] right it was always christ christ christ
[1:17:21] christ and that's the fruit that's
[1:17:22] coming out
[1:17:22] is christ christ christ when we see
[1:17:25] ourselves lifted up brother brown said
[1:17:26] what an arrogant spirit
[1:17:27] is never ever ever from god
[1:17:31] and an arrogant spirit is when you
[1:17:32] inject yourself into it and say this has
[1:17:35] something to do with me
[1:17:37] it's not it is christ from start to
[1:17:39] finish amen
[1:17:41] so let's start talking about some of
[1:17:42] those mature believers and men in the
[1:17:44] context of the harvest
[1:17:46] now one thing's for sure if there's a
[1:17:48] harvest season happening there's no
[1:17:49] question as to what you are
[1:17:51] because the harvest season is when you
[1:17:53] see you may have seen at the beginning
[1:17:55] the tree standing there and there's no
[1:17:56] fruit on it and if you don't know
[1:17:58] much about trees then you can say well
[1:17:59] that's an apple tree but you don't know
[1:18:00] because there's no fruit on it
[1:18:02] somebody that really knows it does but
[1:18:03] not you don't but when the harvest comes
[1:18:05] now
[1:18:06] the berries are out the the fruits are
[1:18:08] out all these different things the vines
[1:18:09] have put out the grapes
[1:18:10] and that's when you start to see what
[1:18:12] that actually was and it's in the
[1:18:13] harvest season that you get a
[1:18:15] confirmation of what somebody
[1:18:16] already was right they were from the
[1:18:18] beginning but maybe the fruits are only
[1:18:20] coming out just now
[1:18:22] but again it's not just fruit because
[1:18:24] the scripture speaks and
[1:18:25] we'll get into it in a little bit about
[1:18:27] evil fruit and good fruit
[1:18:29] so you can have fruit that looks the
[1:18:31] same and the only way you know what it
[1:18:32] is is if you take a bite of it
[1:18:34] right you can have an apple tree that's
[1:18:36] got sour apples
[1:18:38] and it looks just the same as the one
[1:18:39] that's got the sweet apples and then you
[1:18:41] don't know until you take a little
[1:18:42] nibble from that and say is this a good
[1:18:44] one or is it a bad one
[1:18:46] you have to taste the fruit matthew 7
[1:18:48] jesus talks about this he says beware of
[1:18:50] false prophets
[1:18:51] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[1:18:53] but inwardly they are ravening wolves
[1:18:55] so the outside looks the same as
[1:18:57] everybody else but there's something
[1:18:59] else driving them and it's a
[1:19:00] it's a destructive spirit ye shall know
[1:19:03] them by their fruits
[1:19:05] do men gather grapes of thorns or figs
[1:19:07] of thistles
[1:19:09] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[1:19:12] good fruit
[1:19:14] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[1:19:17] evil fruit so you can have the same type
[1:19:20] of tree
[1:19:21] with the fruit being poisoned with the
[1:19:24] fruit being wrong
[1:19:25] looks exactly the same you have nothing
[1:19:28] on the outside maybe that would tell you
[1:19:29] that there's something inside that's
[1:19:30] different
[1:19:31] but he says a good tree bringeth forth
[1:19:32] good fruit but a corrupt tree
[1:19:34] brings forth evil fruit and some people
[1:19:37] it's very obvious
[1:19:39] some people it's very obvious you only
[1:19:40] have to conversation with some people
[1:19:41] and you know that the
[1:19:42] the fruit is rotten right that it's sour
[1:19:44] it's there's something not quite right
[1:19:46] there the sweetness isn't there
[1:19:47] but there's some people it takes decades
[1:19:49] to bring it out because they're going
[1:19:51] through the motions
[1:19:52] and they've got a religious covering
[1:19:53] like brother gerald's been talking about
[1:19:54] and that can take you for decades
[1:19:56] for that fruit to come out right and you
[1:19:59] only have to look around newfoundland to
[1:20:00] see it
[1:20:01] unfortunately that's all you have to
[1:20:02] look around and see you you know one day
[1:20:04] we'll give our lives for the seals
[1:20:07] no you won't because he wasn't in you
[1:20:12] right there's nothing in you to keep you
[1:20:13] until that point even you know
[1:20:15] verse 18.
[1:20:18] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[1:20:20] fruit neither can a corrupt tree
[1:20:22] bring forth good fruit every tree that
[1:20:25] bringeth forth not good fruit
[1:20:26] is hewn down and cast into the fire and
[1:20:29] then when it's tasted and it proves that
[1:20:30] it's wrong thing
[1:20:32] out it goes you don't dwell on it you
[1:20:33] can't fix a corrupt tree
[1:20:35] that's what he's saying is it's
[1:20:36] corrupted right it's not that the
[1:20:37] fruit's bad it's at the tree's bed
[1:20:39] and the tree is bringing forth corrupted
[1:20:41] fruit then he says you can't do anything
[1:20:42] with that you got to cast it down into
[1:20:44] the fire you got to cut it down he says
[1:20:46] wherefore
[1:20:47] by their fruits you shall know them now
[1:20:50] listen to this
[1:20:51] he says not everyone that says unto me
[1:20:52] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:20:55] of heaven
[1:20:55] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:20:57] which is in heaven
[1:20:59] amen lots of people identify with the
[1:21:00] bible lots of people identify with jesus
[1:21:02] christ with christianity today
[1:21:04] he says look there's going to be lots of
[1:21:05] them saying that but they don't all get
[1:21:07] into the kingdom of heaven
[1:21:09] many will say to me in that day at the
[1:21:11] judgment day
[1:21:12] lord lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:21:14] name
[1:21:15] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[1:21:17] thy name done many wonderful works
[1:21:19] now you can see one person of note in
[1:21:22] the scripture there
[1:21:23] that's judas judas could come up and say
[1:21:26] lord didn't we do all those things
[1:21:28] right judas didn't fail at the beginning
[1:21:32] judas did three years five months
[1:21:37] three and a half four weeks he failed in
[1:21:39] the last week
[1:21:40] other than that judas was the same as
[1:21:42] all of the other disciples until the
[1:21:43] very end
[1:21:44] but he had some corruption showing
[1:21:46] through there and then he met up with
[1:21:47] the priests and these different things
[1:21:48] and it started to show what was inside
[1:21:49] him
[1:21:50] but judas could come up and say all of
[1:21:51] these things so if you're
[1:21:53] looking for signs and wonders and you're
[1:21:54] following signs and wonders you're going
[1:21:55] to get tripped up
[1:21:57] it isn't just that amen you can go to a
[1:22:00] benny hinn
[1:22:01] revival campaign and get healed why
[1:22:04] because god honors faith
[1:22:05] it's not about benny hin it's about god
[1:22:06] honors faith if they preach the word and
[1:22:08] you come and accept the word god will
[1:22:09] heal you regardless of who's doing it
[1:22:11] right so you can get healed there as
[1:22:13] much as you can in a message church
[1:22:15] but that doesn't make benny hing going
[1:22:16] into the rapture
[1:22:18] right jesus said so he doesn't say
[1:22:22] you didn't prophesy in my name
[1:22:25] you didn't cast out devils and you
[1:22:27] didn't do many wonderful works he
[1:22:28] doesn't say that
[1:22:29] he says and then i will profess unto
[1:22:31] them i never knew you
[1:22:33] he didn't say you didn't do it he says i
[1:22:35] didn't know you you said you knew me but
[1:22:36] i didn't know you
[1:22:38] and the word there is an intimate
[1:22:39] knowledge amen it's a marital knowledge
[1:22:41] if we could put it that way for a mixed
[1:22:42] crowd
[1:22:43] he says i didn't know you intimately i
[1:22:45] had nothing to do with you
[1:22:47] it was you trying to come to me but i
[1:22:48] never came to you he says i never knew
[1:22:51] you depart
[1:22:52] from me ye that work iniquity that
[1:22:54] iniquity we know i've covered it before
[1:22:56] is to not do the things that you're
[1:22:58] supposed to do
[1:23:00] because in verse 21 there it says but he
[1:23:03] that doeth the will of my father which
[1:23:04] is in heaven you got to do the will of
[1:23:06] god
[1:23:07] and then he came and says you worked
[1:23:08] iniquity you knew the will of god i
[1:23:10] showed you the word of god i gave you a
[1:23:12] message in your day
[1:23:13] and you turned it down and you went and
[1:23:14] did things your own way and you built a
[1:23:16] kingdom you built a ministry to your own
[1:23:17] self
[1:23:18] rather than to me and then we talked
[1:23:20] about the two seeds of faith and doubt
[1:23:22] when we were going through
[1:23:23] the the battle for the gate and these
[1:23:24] things and each person's life is going
[1:23:26] to have one or the other
[1:23:27] if you don't have life you automatically
[1:23:28] have doubt that's it there's only two
[1:23:31] if you don't have life then everything
[1:23:32] else is doubt right so if you have life
[1:23:34] if you have faith then that's going to
[1:23:35] conquer all of those other things but if
[1:23:37] they disbelieve brother braham said one
[1:23:38] word he says one word got us into this
[1:23:40] and you've got to believe every word to
[1:23:41] get you out of it he says if you turn
[1:23:43] down one
[1:23:44] word you're lost you're lost if you turn
[1:23:48] down one word
[1:23:49] right he says it's gonna take all of
[1:23:51] that to get them back and the ones that
[1:23:53] have done this that all they've done is
[1:23:54] they've disbelieved that one word
[1:23:56] and they've stepped away and said that's
[1:23:57] not for me or that's not true brother
[1:23:59] brown says there's a revival going on
[1:24:01] this is 1962.
[1:24:02] what is it a sewing you don't hear very
[1:24:05] much of billy graham no more do you what
[1:24:06] about oral
[1:24:07] what about the rest of them you know the
[1:24:09] great revival is not fire's not burning
[1:24:11] what is it
[1:24:12] it's the end time seed sign he says the
[1:24:15] words has been
[1:24:16] sown what is it denomination
[1:24:19] will reap denomination they sowed it and
[1:24:21] that's what they get
[1:24:22] that makes them confederate themselves
[1:24:24] together but the word of god has been
[1:24:26] sowed also
[1:24:27] that's a that ought to give us a rest
[1:24:29] and a peace he says the word of god has
[1:24:31] been sold also
[1:24:32] and when the spirit of god begins to
[1:24:34] fall the word of god will live
[1:24:36] in the people and that false bride
[1:24:40] that's committed adultery out there and
[1:24:41] brought herself into creeds
[1:24:43] and sold out her birthrights will we
[1:24:45] reap what
[1:24:46] a confederation of churches that's to be
[1:24:48] bound and burned like the thorns and
[1:24:50] thistles
[1:24:51] but where the word of god's been sowed
[1:24:53] into the people's heart
[1:24:54] it will reap a bride for christ as
[1:24:56] certain as i am standing here
[1:24:59] end time signs he says there's two
[1:25:00] harvests here wants to be bound and
[1:25:02] burned
[1:25:02] and one's to go into a rapture it's a
[1:25:04] ready-made bride for him amen
[1:25:05] what is it it's the parable of the sower
[1:25:07] the good seed's owned by god and the bad
[1:25:08] seed sown by saint
[1:25:09] two seeds in there you gotta they both
[1:25:11] have to come up and they both have to
[1:25:13] mature and show what they are before
[1:25:14] they can be separated amen
[1:25:17] brother brown continues he says now
[1:25:20] another great seed was planted
[1:25:22] he said in the last days in second
[1:25:23] timothy the third chapter that there
[1:25:25] will come amongst the church of falling
[1:25:27] away from the bible faith
[1:25:29] that's right is that a seed is that a
[1:25:31] promise look at them today look at our
[1:25:32] churches and what are they doing
[1:25:34] they're organizing themselves together
[1:25:36] they're cooperating together binding
[1:25:37] themselves together
[1:25:39] failing don't believe in the bible don't
[1:25:40] believe in the real true word of god
[1:25:42] that's what you see today that's right
[1:25:44] that's all you see is that it's a bunch
[1:25:46] of shouting and dancing and they want to
[1:25:47] worship all day long
[1:25:49] and they want a 15-minute sermon right
[1:25:51] they want an emphasis on the feeling
[1:25:53] good
[1:25:54] and the affirmation that you're okay and
[1:25:56] you're gonna make it
[1:25:57] rather than align with the word of god
[1:25:59] obey it and find life
[1:26:00] amen choose life you say the bible says
[1:26:03] this
[1:26:04] and they say them things are past
[1:26:05] there's no such a thing oh there's no
[1:26:07] such
[1:26:08] a thing the days of miracles is passed a
[1:26:10] long time ago
[1:26:11] there's no such a thing as the baptism
[1:26:12] of the holy ghost that was for a handful
[1:26:15] of people
[1:26:15] 12 back there the apostles see what is
[1:26:18] that seed
[1:26:19] it's maturing it's the end time signed
[1:26:22] seed
[1:26:22] what did jesus say when you see these
[1:26:24] things happening lift up your head
[1:26:26] your redemptions drawing nigh to the
[1:26:28] church we seen
[1:26:30] she would fall away all right so we
[1:26:33] notice then that the maturing of the
[1:26:34] bride is always surrounded by a falling
[1:26:36] away
[1:26:37] that's what he's telling us because if
[1:26:39] you go all the way back
[1:26:40] into the beginning when they were coming
[1:26:42] into canaan what happened there was a
[1:26:43] separation of faith and unbelief wasn't
[1:26:45] there
[1:26:46] it always comes up it comes to the time
[1:26:48] of decision will you go in or will you
[1:26:50] stay out
[1:26:51] and that's a separation that's god
[1:26:52] that's doing that work it's not satan
[1:26:54] this is god doing the work he lets it go
[1:26:56] so far and then he says now the fruit's
[1:26:58] got to come out we've got to do the
[1:26:59] separating because to go into the land
[1:27:01] to go into the promise to take the fruit
[1:27:03] right because they went in at a time of
[1:27:05] harvest do you remember
[1:27:06] they went in they brought out the big
[1:27:07] thing of grapes and all these different
[1:27:08] things they went into the land initially
[1:27:10] at a time of harvest
[1:27:11] came out and the people refused to go in
[1:27:14] right
[1:27:14] they refused the fruits and then he says
[1:27:17] you got to go ahead and claim the fruits
[1:27:18] but only the faithful can go in there
[1:27:20] it was only joshua and caleb two out of
[1:27:21] millions that went in and that was it
[1:27:24] everyone else denied the promise
[1:27:25] wandered around for 40 years they had an
[1:27:27] early death
[1:27:28] they had an early death because of their
[1:27:29] unbelief and caleb goes in and he says
[1:27:31] i'm
[1:27:32] as strong as the day i went in the first
[1:27:34] time i went in he says i'm 40 now i'm 80
[1:27:35] and i don't feel a lick different
[1:27:37] why because faith is the thing that was
[1:27:39] working in him and unbelief killed all
[1:27:40] those other people
[1:27:41] amen no different today and brother
[1:27:44] branham says it's the end time seed sign
[1:27:46] you point to this scripture
[1:27:47] in first john 2 it says little children
[1:27:50] it is the last time
[1:27:52] now he's not talking about that day but
[1:27:54] he's talking about what's happening in
[1:27:56] that day because they saw falling away
[1:27:58] but this is a scripture specifically for
[1:28:00] us today little children it
[1:28:02] is the last time we're in the last feast
[1:28:04] folks we're at the end of the harvest
[1:28:05] this is it
[1:28:06] and as ye have heard that antichrist
[1:28:08] shall come even now are there many
[1:28:10] antichrists
[1:28:11] whereby we know that it is the last time
[1:28:14] they went out from us
[1:28:15] but they were not of us for if they had
[1:28:18] been of us they would no doubt have
[1:28:20] continued with it
[1:28:21] but they went out that they might be
[1:28:24] made manifest that they
[1:28:25] were not all of us that's the working of
[1:28:28] god because god wants to make it clear
[1:28:30] these are not to be identified with my
[1:28:31] bride and so a separation has to come
[1:28:34] there and it's god that causes it
[1:28:35] it's god that draws that line there
[1:28:37] we've seen this happen in the last 10
[1:28:38] years within the message haven't we
[1:28:39] we saw people that put decades in the
[1:28:41] ministry into service
[1:28:43] into working with the bride great man
[1:28:47] and what did they do boom all of a
[1:28:50] sudden separation comes and they're out
[1:28:52] and what are they preaching today they
[1:28:53] know too much they know too much of the
[1:28:55] message
[1:28:56] right they go into a denomination and
[1:28:58] it's like a human walking in and having
[1:29:00] a conversation with a chicken
[1:29:02] they can't stay there because they're so
[1:29:03] far below their level of understanding
[1:29:05] not revelation understanding because it
[1:29:07] was revelation they just stuck with it
[1:29:09] but they go in there and they talk to
[1:29:11] those people and it's so silly and they
[1:29:12] know it's so
[1:29:13] it's so juvenile right there's nothing
[1:29:16] there for them because they know so much
[1:29:18] but they can't live the life that that
[1:29:19] was preached to them because they didn't
[1:29:21] have the holy spirit
[1:29:22] and so what do they do they go out and
[1:29:23] they create their own little groups and
[1:29:25] they preach of
[1:29:26] love and acceptance because that's the
[1:29:28] only thing they have left because they
[1:29:28] can't live in overcoming life
[1:29:30] can't live in overcoming life without
[1:29:32] the power of the holy spirit that's what
[1:29:33] we've been reading
[1:29:34] right so they don't have the holy spirit
[1:29:36] they can't take the full revelation of
[1:29:37] the message but they can't go into a
[1:29:38] denomination because they know that
[1:29:40] that's
[1:29:40] that's corrupt as well so they're making
[1:29:42] up their own little groups and they're
[1:29:43] preaching these little isms for
[1:29:44] themselves
[1:29:45] yeah we're all good and what are they
[1:29:46] doing they're reassuring themselves that
[1:29:48] they're still going to make it
[1:29:49] even though they've walked away from the
[1:29:51] truth right as we read last service
[1:29:52] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:29:55] the power thereof
[1:29:56] from such turn away there's no power to
[1:29:58] live in overcoming life
[1:30:00] that's it they're done they've walked
[1:30:02] away
[1:30:03] right they tasted and they walked away
[1:30:06] god's grace that maybe they could find
[1:30:07] repentance
[1:30:09] it's a shame you think of jeff jenkins
[1:30:11] or someone like that you know put
[1:30:12] decades into it
[1:30:13] decades into it and then to walk away
[1:30:15] the way he has it's a shame
[1:30:17] maybe god will grant them grace we don't
[1:30:19] know it's up to him i guess
[1:30:21] but john gives us a beautiful finish a
[1:30:23] consolation and encouragement at the end
[1:30:24] of
[1:30:25] that chapter he says and now little
[1:30:26] children abide in him
[1:30:28] after all this he says abide with him
[1:30:30] that when he shall appear
[1:30:32] we may have confidence and not be
[1:30:35] ashamed before him at his coming
[1:30:37] if you know that he is righteous you
[1:30:39] know that everyone that doeth
[1:30:40] righteousness is born of him
[1:30:41] so he says that we may when he appears
[1:30:43] we may have confidence why
[1:30:45] because we've been doing the will of the
[1:30:46] father right we are living the life of
[1:30:48] christ we have the mind of christ we're
[1:30:50] living the life of christ
[1:30:52] we'll have confidence and then john says
[1:30:54] you know that he's righteous and if
[1:30:55] you're doing righteousness
[1:30:57] then you're born of god and he says
[1:30:59] that's your comfort is that the
[1:31:00] righteousness that you have
[1:31:02] your own is filthy rags but you've taken
[1:31:03] on his you've taken on the mind of
[1:31:05] christ you have the life of christ he
[1:31:06] says so
[1:31:07] everything that you're doing is the very
[1:31:09] proof that you are born of god
[1:31:11] he says so be encouraged stick with it
[1:31:12] stay with what you've learned stay with
[1:31:14] what you've been taught
[1:31:15] if it's having the effect it's supposed
[1:31:16] to stay with it and that's going to lead
[1:31:18] you to not being ashamed when he comes
[1:31:20] you'll be able to lift up your head
[1:31:22] because your redemption's dry now not to
[1:31:23] turn your head down because he's coming
[1:31:25] in power
[1:31:26] and glory and judgment right you want to
[1:31:28] lift it up because he's coming for you
[1:31:29] not because he's coming to judge you
[1:31:32] and then take it back to hebrews 13 this
[1:31:34] is brother branham's
[1:31:36] scripture amen hebrews 13 8 but verse 7
[1:31:38] is the key one because it says
[1:31:40] remember them which have the rule over
[1:31:42] you he's speaking of the ministry
[1:31:45] who have spoken the prophet you know
[1:31:47] himself and these things he says
[1:31:48] who have spoken unto you the word of god
[1:31:50] that's how he identifies who has the
[1:31:52] ruler viewers the ones that are teaching
[1:31:53] you and preaching to you
[1:31:55] he says whose faith follow but he puts a
[1:31:58] condition he says considering the end of
[1:32:00] their conversations
[1:32:01] so in other words he's saying follow
[1:32:03] after people who have the right kind of
[1:32:04] life conversation is life or lifestyle
[1:32:07] he says so follow after people who have
[1:32:09] the right kind of life not just at the
[1:32:11] beginning
[1:32:12] but all the way through and then that's
[1:32:14] why a pastor has
[1:32:15] can't be a novices because you've got to
[1:32:17] know that he's right
[1:32:18] you've got to know that there's a fruit
[1:32:20] that follows him to make sure that you
[1:32:22] don't put someone behind that pulpit to
[1:32:23] teach you and feed you
[1:32:25] that's got a corrupt seed inside of them
[1:32:26] amen and that's the dangers we when we
[1:32:28] don't do that
[1:32:29] all of a sudden we've got problems in
[1:32:30] churches because you haven't proven the
[1:32:32] man
[1:32:33] there needs to be a proof of a life
[1:32:34] behind them before they ever get to
[1:32:36] inject life to you
[1:32:37] because you want to trust that they're
[1:32:38] going to give you christ's life not
[1:32:40] their own life that they don't
[1:32:41] introduce man seed as the serpent did
[1:32:44] but that it's god's seed that's coming
[1:32:45] forth and that's what the people are
[1:32:46] feeding on amen otherwise you get a big
[1:32:48] mess
[1:32:49] he says and what is their conversation
[1:32:52] what should their life look like
[1:32:54] verse 8 jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:32:57] today
[1:32:57] and forever and that's what william
[1:32:59] branham did more than any other man in
[1:33:01] this
[1:33:01] in this age was he came up and he showed
[1:33:03] jesus christ from start to finish
[1:33:05] false failures absolutely there's no
[1:33:08] denying that he's still a man
[1:33:09] but he showed the works he showed the
[1:33:10] attitude and he showed the faith and he
[1:33:12] showed the dedication to the truth of
[1:33:14] the word
[1:33:15] amen and that ought to give us faith
[1:33:17] that we can have the very same thing
[1:33:18] that we have
[1:33:19] the same thing amen that he's going to
[1:33:21] bring us to the exact same place not in
[1:33:22] gifts
[1:33:23] and signs and wonders necessarily but
[1:33:24] he'll bring us to that exact same place
[1:33:26] where he could we can have the very
[1:33:28] attitude and response that christ would
[1:33:29] have
[1:33:30] and as he showed it in william branham
[1:33:31] when we're reading his life story and
[1:33:33] our family devotions it amazes me
[1:33:34] sometimes
[1:33:35] how things would come up to to just
[1:33:37] challenge him and you know it would rile
[1:33:39] us it would it would drive us nuts
[1:33:40] sometimes the
[1:33:41] the petty things that people tried to do
[1:33:43] to him and he would just breeze over it
[1:33:45] because why he said like jesus we must
[1:33:47] be about our father's will
[1:33:50] right we're always going to have
[1:33:51] naysayers we're always going to have
[1:33:52] critics we're always going to have
[1:33:53] people trying to hitter us
[1:33:54] ignore them and just keep moving because
[1:33:56] god's with us god's not with them
[1:33:58] just keep moving ignore it and we're
[1:34:00] okay to go amen
[1:34:02] so paul continues here he says so check
[1:34:04] their lives that it's jesus christ the
[1:34:06] same yesterday today and forever
[1:34:07] that they had it yesterday they have it
[1:34:08] today and they're going to have it
[1:34:09] tomorrow is what they're looking at
[1:34:11] that christ is exemplified in their
[1:34:12] lives and then he says be not carried
[1:34:15] about with divers
[1:34:16] and strange doctrines for it is a good
[1:34:18] thing that the heart be
[1:34:19] established with grace not with meech
[1:34:22] with some
[1:34:23] which have not profited them that have
[1:34:24] been occupied they're in amen you ever
[1:34:26] see people that are flip-flopping
[1:34:27] doctrines constantly and they're chasing
[1:34:28] after this minister and that minister
[1:34:30] and this one have you heard this have
[1:34:31] you heard this all you need to look at
[1:34:32] this guy he's got the greatest
[1:34:33] revelation he's got the newest thing
[1:34:35] paul saying don't do that because you
[1:34:37] haven't checked the fruits yet
[1:34:39] it's there you can take it you can say
[1:34:41] okay let's see what it is
[1:34:43] but he says you don't dive into that
[1:34:44] because there's no proof of what's
[1:34:46] behind it
[1:34:47] he says it hasn't profited them that are
[1:34:49] occupied therein
[1:34:50] says look at what it's producing and
[1:34:53] then let that help you decide whether or
[1:34:54] not that's true
[1:34:55] because they can give you the truth but
[1:34:56] if they've got a wrong attitude or
[1:34:58] spirit attached to it
[1:34:59] and you get sucked into that now you get
[1:35:00] pulled into a cult
[1:35:02] right and you're going to take on the
[1:35:04] attitude or the spirit of that minister
[1:35:06] and it's not going to be christ they
[1:35:07] could be right in their doctrine wrong
[1:35:09] in their attitude and that's why you're
[1:35:10] looking at the fruits not just the words
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:18] but we don't just want to look for
[1:35:19] ministers to be like that
[1:35:21] right we want to be like that our
[1:35:24] conversation our lifestyle has to be
[1:35:26] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:35:27] and forever
[1:35:28] if we're going to go in that harvest
[1:35:29] amen what went down into the ground what
[1:35:31] jesus said right unless the corn and
[1:35:32] wheat fall into the ground
[1:35:33] and die it can't be raised again the
[1:35:35] same thing that went out it's got to
[1:35:36] come up again at the end
[1:35:37] and so we're looking for the very same
[1:35:39] life the very same attitude the very
[1:35:40] same responses like i talked about
[1:35:42] the very same leadership where our life
[1:35:44] is about the will of god
[1:35:46] start to finish lord what would you have
[1:35:48] me do today i've got to go to work
[1:35:51] you've still got to do that but lord how
[1:35:52] do i interact with people where am i
[1:35:54] going to go what am i going to say
[1:35:55] how am i raising my family right what's
[1:35:58] my portion of the body
[1:35:59] selena was was you know she's looking
[1:36:01] for what to do
[1:36:03] after after she graduates and whatnot
[1:36:05] and and she was
[1:36:06] she was looking for advice and one
[1:36:07] brother said look at what you can do for
[1:36:09] the body of christ in your career
[1:36:11] i thought that was a great idea you know
[1:36:13] when i picked my career i picked
[1:36:14] something that played to my strengths
[1:36:16] and that would that would uh you know
[1:36:18] not keep me in university too long
[1:36:20] but you know and you're looking for
[1:36:23] leadership but i didn't really look at
[1:36:24] it as how i could benefit the body of
[1:36:25] christ
[1:36:26] but if i could have done that maybe at
[1:36:28] the beginning i don't know maybe i would
[1:36:29] have done something different i don't
[1:36:30] know but i thought that was a great way
[1:36:31] to enter into a career is
[1:36:33] how can i benefit the body of christ and
[1:36:34] what i do day to day
[1:36:36] right we got to pay bills we got to have
[1:36:37] a house and pay for vehicles and
[1:36:39] educations and
[1:36:40] all these different things but how can i
[1:36:41] do the the thing that will take
[1:36:43] the body closer to a rapture amen what
[1:36:46] can i do that will build up rather than
[1:36:47] pull me away
[1:36:48] and cause disruption in my life and
[1:36:50] cause a separation between my spiritual
[1:36:52] life and my career if you could put the
[1:36:54] two of those things together where god
[1:36:55] can be a part of your day-to-day life
[1:36:57] where you can be anointed to do things i
[1:36:59] think of joe
[1:37:00] you know he's got a business here that's
[1:37:02] that's that's uh got a few people in the
[1:37:04] church
[1:37:04] employed i think that's the grace of god
[1:37:07] right and that's the leadership of god
[1:37:08] that's working there
[1:37:09] to give him that unction to bring those
[1:37:11] people in and it's been a tremendous
[1:37:12] blessing to him
[1:37:13] and a blessing to them that's great i
[1:37:15] think that's just god moving within us
[1:37:17] amen
[1:37:18] but i love how it says jesus christ the
[1:37:19] same yesterday today and forever
[1:37:21] you can't rest only on what he did for
[1:37:23] you yesterday right you want him to be
[1:37:25] looking today
[1:37:26] moving today and you want to be ready
[1:37:28] for what's coming tomorrow and then it's
[1:37:29] a preparation
[1:37:30] it's a confirmation what he's done it's
[1:37:32] an expectation
[1:37:33] and a constance today and then something
[1:37:36] that's coming for you tomorrow you're
[1:37:37] looking for him from backwards to front
[1:37:39] looking behind and looking forward and
[1:37:40] looking at him today he's there from
[1:37:42] from start to finishing man amen brother
[1:37:46] brown talks about how he was the great i
[1:37:47] am
[1:37:48] not the great i was not the great i will
[1:37:50] be he is the great i am he is the
[1:37:52] ever-present god in our lives amen
[1:37:54] and our lives have to reflect that but
[1:37:57] the brown says there's only one heart's
[1:37:59] desire
[1:37:59] and that is to see jesus christ
[1:38:00] glorified their conduct
[1:38:03] must be with god we're talking about
[1:38:04] mature believers now we're talking about
[1:38:05] harvest ready believers
[1:38:07] it must absolutely nothing else but just
[1:38:10] the glory of jesus christ
[1:38:12] he says and what is jesus the word
[1:38:14] that's right now notice
[1:38:16] and seen his same vindicated method
[1:38:18] proving his resurrection
[1:38:19] now what is it seeing your life by his
[1:38:22] promised word that he said
[1:38:23] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:38:25] forever proving he's still
[1:38:27] alive how do you know you're the ones
[1:38:30] that the bible speaks of
[1:38:32] do you know your position is in christ
[1:38:34] if you're in christ
[1:38:35] you're a new creature do you know this
[1:38:37] word is just like
[1:38:38] everyday living to you can we specify
[1:38:42] that could that be our testimony today
[1:38:43] this word is an
[1:38:44] everyday living to me
[1:38:48] every day all day right not just a
[1:38:51] portion not just when i have my
[1:38:52] devotions or
[1:38:53] when i wake up and i read our daily
[1:38:55] bread but all day every day
[1:38:58] is the word like everyday living he says
[1:39:00] why sure
[1:39:01] it's yours you're an eagle that's
[1:39:04] your food and like i said we're talking
[1:39:07] about mature believers we're talking
[1:39:08] about rapture ready believers
[1:39:10] and it is the word every day living in
[1:39:12] them
[1:39:13] we're talking about people that are
[1:39:14] showing the fullness of the fruits of
[1:39:15] the spirit
[1:39:17] fullness of the fruits of the spirit but
[1:39:18] the brahman says and when the man
[1:39:20] and woman gets into god complete now
[1:39:24] not under some spell not under some
[1:39:27] emotion
[1:39:27] but because what we see people you have
[1:39:30] a special meeting
[1:39:31] and they come in and the anointing is so
[1:39:33] strong and the conviction's there and
[1:39:34] they run up to that altar
[1:39:36] they've been there 17 times already and
[1:39:38] they keep coming up
[1:39:39] and in that moment and they're weeping
[1:39:41] and then they're happy and they're great
[1:39:42] and i've got the holy ghost
[1:39:44] and three weeks later they're right back
[1:39:45] where they were right he's saying that's
[1:39:46] not what we're talking about not under a
[1:39:48] spell
[1:39:49] right not under a temporary anointing
[1:39:51] not under a temporary spirit
[1:39:53] but really when the word in him becomes
[1:39:55] one god has saved that person
[1:39:58] sanctified him from the things of the
[1:40:00] world renovated everything of the world
[1:40:02] away from him
[1:40:03] and the fire of the holy ghost lives in
[1:40:05] that person
[1:40:06] reflecting himself that perfect man or
[1:40:09] woman living by the word
[1:40:12] see that's the earth cleansed he's
[1:40:14] talking about the fire that's going to
[1:40:15] cleanse the earth but he says there's a
[1:40:16] fire that cleanses the earth that you
[1:40:17] have
[1:40:18] and then he's talking about that he's
[1:40:19] referring to earth and vessels
[1:40:21] which is second corinthians he says for
[1:40:23] god who commanded the light to shine out
[1:40:25] of darkness has shined in our hearts
[1:40:28] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:40:29] the glory of god
[1:40:31] in the face of jesus christ but we have
[1:40:34] this treasure in earthen vessels
[1:40:38] now listen to why we have it in earth
[1:40:40] and vessels listen to why we have it in
[1:40:42] earth and vessels now and not in a
[1:40:43] glorified body
[1:40:44] he says that the excellency of the power
[1:40:48] may be of god and not of us why because
[1:40:51] we're in a fallen condition he says the
[1:40:53] only way you can do this
[1:40:54] is that it's by the power of god and
[1:40:57] that's why we're in a fallen vessel so
[1:40:58] that everything that we do
[1:41:00] makes it obvious to ourselves amen we
[1:41:03] know what we were before we got the holy
[1:41:04] ghost amen i know what i was
[1:41:06] completely useless worthless right
[1:41:09] couldn't do anything
[1:41:10] right not nothing godly that's for sure
[1:41:13] and then he says you have the excellency
[1:41:15] of the power of god may be of him and
[1:41:18] not of us
[1:41:19] because we knew what we were and we know
[1:41:21] that what we're doing oft times our body
[1:41:24] our spirit is rebelling against what it
[1:41:27] is and yet we do what we don't want to
[1:41:29] do
[1:41:29] why because the holy spirit is in us
[1:41:31] that unction is in us that power is in
[1:41:33] us
[1:41:33] just driving us forward to do something
[1:41:36] that you don't want to do
[1:41:37] when you've got to make that apology
[1:41:38] that you don't want to do it's the holy
[1:41:40] ghost right
[1:41:41] it's the holy ghost when a minister gets
[1:41:43] up here and says hard things and he
[1:41:44] knows he doesn't want to say it he knows
[1:41:46] somebody's going to take it personally
[1:41:47] but he'll do it anyways
[1:41:49] he'll put himself in a place to be hurt
[1:41:52] or rejected because the word is coming
[1:41:55] out of him and telling him to say
[1:41:56] something that he doesn't want to do
[1:41:57] amen
[1:41:58] how many times did brother bram say i
[1:41:59] hate to say this i don't want to say
[1:42:01] this but i say it because i love you
[1:42:03] right when you'll go in and you'll make
[1:42:05] something right when you twist something
[1:42:06] just a little bit and then you have to
[1:42:08] come back around to that person say
[1:42:09] i didn't quite give you the full story
[1:42:11] there what is it
[1:42:13] it's the holy spirit doing that because
[1:42:14] everybody else just moves back to
[1:42:16] past that and says it's no big deal
[1:42:18] right
[1:42:19] and what is this the holy ghost keeping
[1:42:21] you clean so that he can keep moving and
[1:42:23] you he can keep moving in the services
[1:42:24] he can keep moving in the body and he
[1:42:26] can use you and he says it's the
[1:42:28] power it's that the excellency of the
[1:42:30] power may be of god and not of us
[1:42:32] that's that's my testimony i'm not here
[1:42:35] by anything i've done
[1:42:36] or any desire i've done and every day it
[1:42:38] is only because he keeps pushing me
[1:42:40] to do it that i am able to do it day in
[1:42:42] and day out amen
[1:42:44] but look at this beautiful thing as we
[1:42:45] go through these last three three verses
[1:42:47] here
[1:42:47] he says so we have this this treasure in
[1:42:50] earth and vessels
[1:42:51] he says and we are troubled on every
[1:42:53] side
[1:42:55] yet not distressed we are perplexed
[1:42:58] but not in despair persecuted but not
[1:43:02] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[1:43:05] always bearing about in the body the
[1:43:07] dying of the lord jesus
[1:43:08] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:43:11] made manifest
[1:43:12] in our body notice how despite
[1:43:14] difficulties despite trials and
[1:43:16] tribulations and persecutions and these
[1:43:18] things
[1:43:18] the believer is never overcome and what
[1:43:21] he's talking about here
[1:43:23] trouble trouble is exterior and it can
[1:43:25] be interior amen you're fighting your
[1:43:27] flesh or you're fighting somebody else's
[1:43:28] flesh right one way or the other
[1:43:30] he talks about we're perplexed we don't
[1:43:32] know what's going on we don't understand
[1:43:34] what's happening we don't have a
[1:43:35] revelation or an understanding of it but
[1:43:36] he says we're still not in despair
[1:43:39] why because we have a confidence that
[1:43:41] this treasure in earth and vessels is
[1:43:42] there for a reason
[1:43:43] and it's going to carry us through
[1:43:44] regardless and god has a purpose and a
[1:43:46] plan in all of it
[1:43:47] and therefore we stand regardless
[1:43:50] we do not fall into despair we are not
[1:43:52] completely annihilated or destroyed we
[1:43:54] are not broken down
[1:43:56] but we stand there amen the holy spirit
[1:43:58] raises the standard of the word
[1:43:59] and we stand there and hold hold hold
[1:44:02] fighting every time
[1:44:03] until it brings us through and we're on
[1:44:04] the other side of the trial amen
[1:44:06] that's what he says a mature bride is a
[1:44:08] treasure in earth and vessels and can go
[1:44:10] through all of these difficulties
[1:44:12] and come out smelling like a rose so to
[1:44:14] speak amen
[1:44:15] with the holy spirit just bringing the
[1:44:16] sweetness in their life amen
[1:44:19] this is the fruit of the holy spirit
[1:44:21] it's easy to have a sweet attitude when
[1:44:23] things are going great when there's
[1:44:24] money in the bank when your health is
[1:44:25] good your marriage is good the kids are
[1:44:26] behaving
[1:44:27] you have money in the bank but take a
[1:44:30] lot of that away take one of that away
[1:44:32] and see what happens paul says that's
[1:44:35] not the believer that's not the mature
[1:44:36] believer he says it doesn't matter what
[1:44:38] we're going through
[1:44:38] we aren't going to get cast down from
[1:44:40] our position in the word
[1:44:42] brother brahm takes it and he he puts it
[1:44:44] this way a very simple scripture he says
[1:44:46] he wants us
[1:44:47] to be one with god and god is the word
[1:44:50] each individual not churches not
[1:44:53] families
[1:44:53] each individual in his heart must be
[1:44:56] that one
[1:44:58] with god that's what we're talking about
[1:44:59] that's an end time bride that's getting
[1:45:01] ready amen
[1:45:02] the rapture is for a people that are a
[1:45:04] perfect reflection of christ
[1:45:06] as a body as a body amen because he
[1:45:09] spreads it out amongst all of us
[1:45:11] in all of us we have a perfect
[1:45:12] reflection of him does that mean we live
[1:45:14] a perfect life
[1:45:15] no what do we do under the atonement
[1:45:19] it's not our righteousness it's not our
[1:45:20] works that takes us across amen doesn't
[1:45:22] mean we're not
[1:45:22] we live a perfect life it doesn't mean
[1:45:24] we don't make mistakes but what does it
[1:45:26] mean it means that we are under the
[1:45:27] blood of christ and we accept
[1:45:29] believe and act on the word for our day
[1:45:32] and we are led by the holy spirit that's
[1:45:34] a perfect reflection of christ
[1:45:35] they recognize the word they are the
[1:45:37] word and they act according to the word
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:40] remember we read that prayer about jesus
[1:45:42] in the garden of gethsemane where he
[1:45:43] talked about the unity
[1:45:44] he said said lord it can't just be about
[1:45:46] you and i they need to have the same
[1:45:48] thing that
[1:45:49] you and i have he says not just with me
[1:45:51] but with you and there's a
[1:45:52] interesting triangle that happens there
[1:45:54] we're not going to go into godhead but i
[1:45:55] want to read just a quick portion there
[1:45:57] in john 17 where he says
[1:45:58] that they all may be one as thou father
[1:46:01] are to me and i in thee
[1:46:02] that they also may be one in us but
[1:46:04] there's a reason for it he says it's
[1:46:06] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:46:09] sent me
[1:46:10] that's why he has to come into us is
[1:46:11] that the world may believe that he has
[1:46:12] sent
[1:46:13] us as well that he has called us that he
[1:46:15] has created us to be
[1:46:16] his special reflection amen his perfect
[1:46:18] bride
[1:46:19] and the glory which thou gavest me i've
[1:46:21] given them that they may be one even as
[1:46:23] we are one amen that's the baptism of
[1:46:25] the holy spirit
[1:46:26] i in them thou and me that they may be
[1:46:29] be
[1:46:29] may be made perfect in one and that the
[1:46:32] world
[1:46:33] may know that thou has sent me and has
[1:46:36] loved them
[1:46:37] as thou has loved me amen our unity is
[1:46:40] to cause people to believe on christ
[1:46:43] and to believe that he is here and he
[1:46:44] has a people and he's working in a
[1:46:46] people amen
[1:46:47] brother brandon put it this way and
[1:46:48] we'll close with this
[1:46:51] we've got a lot more to go but i'll just
[1:46:52] leave it here i think for this morning
[1:46:55] he said and as he being the groom had
[1:46:58] the bride has to come forth
[1:46:59] because it's a part of him and it can
[1:47:01] only be the manifestation
[1:47:03] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:47:05] any others has spoke of the bride
[1:47:08] it can only manifest if it does
[1:47:10] something different from the groom
[1:47:12] then it isn't the bride that says very
[1:47:14] simple test
[1:47:16] very simple test are you doing what
[1:47:18] christ did you're the bride
[1:47:20] if you're not then you're not a part of
[1:47:23] the bride
[1:47:23] because he says it's going to act
[1:47:24] exactly the same way why because she is
[1:47:27] flesh of his flesh
[1:47:28] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:47:31] of his power
[1:47:32] that's when you start getting into
[1:47:33] motives and objectives not just actions
[1:47:35] and then we start
[1:47:36] to get real deep with this where it's
[1:47:37] not just what you're doing it's why
[1:47:38] you're doing it and how you're doing it
[1:47:40] that matters equally well
[1:47:41] he finishes and he says she is him
[1:47:45] as men and women are one and the woman
[1:47:47] taken from his side
[1:47:49] she had taken a spirit the feminist
[1:47:50] spirit from him the flesh from his side
[1:47:52] was made both
[1:47:53] mechanics and dynamics we'll get into
[1:47:56] that a little later
[1:47:57] mechanics and dynamics it's built right
[1:48:00] and it's got the power to make those
[1:48:02] right things move he says the wife the
[1:48:04] spirit of him
[1:48:05] and the flesh of him and put it together
[1:48:08] and made
[1:48:09] the mechanics and the dynamics
[1:48:12] amen just more if you would come
[1:48:16] sing a song this morning amen but this
[1:48:17] is about a mature crop this is about
[1:48:19] mature believers and
[1:48:20] lord willing as i whenever i'm up here
[1:48:22] next we'll we'll go into what that
[1:48:24] starts to look like and get into some of
[1:48:25] the attributes and identifications of
[1:48:27] that bride
[1:48:28] because we talk about she is the word
[1:48:30] but what does that look like
[1:48:31] right what was the original church like
[1:48:32] and what are we supposed to look like
[1:48:34] and
[1:48:34] what did brother branham point to and
[1:48:35] say these are the promises for our day
[1:48:37] specifically this is exactly what we're
[1:48:39] going to be looking for
[1:48:40] amen but there's going to be no
[1:48:41] distinction that's what brother bram
[1:48:42] says there's going to be no distinction
[1:48:44] between your life and the life of christ
[1:48:46] that's an amazing thing to believe it's
[1:48:47] an amazing thing to reach for and the
[1:48:49] thing is
[1:48:50] it can only be through him amen it's the
[1:48:52] only way we're going to get there it's
[1:48:53] not going to be anything we inject or
[1:48:54] anything we add
[1:48:55] it's going to be him from start to
[1:48:56] finish amen let's just stand if we would
[1:48:58] and we'll pray
[1:49:01] lord jesus lord we're so thankful for
[1:49:05] your promises
[1:49:07] lord every time i open your word lord
[1:49:10] it's just promise after promise
[1:49:13] lord is grace after grace it's mercy
[1:49:15] after mercy

[1:49:25] has gone forth and quicken these things

[1:49:29] not turned down in shame or regret lord

[1:49:37] lord we see you lord we feel your
[1:49:39] presence so often

[1:49:47] to humble
[1:49:48] lord help us to repent lord help us to
[1:49:51] just be in full obedience to you
[1:49:53] lord may we just look for the good
[1:49:54] things of god lord not for our own self
[1:49:57] lord but may we look for it for the good
[1:49:59] of those around us lord may we have a
[1:50:01] body mindset
[1:50:02] lord where we're looking out for the
[1:50:03] good of the others around us as well
[1:50:05] heavenly father
[1:50:07] lord we pray your grace to each one we
[1:50:08] pray for our pastor lord jesus
[1:50:10] may you just minister grace to him as he
[1:50:12] would come on wednesday lord
[1:50:14] may you just fill him with the fire of
[1:50:15] the holy spirit as he speaks or give him
[1:50:17] strength
[1:50:18] lord give him an unction and a message
[1:50:19] for us we pray
[1:50:21] lord bless us now as we worship or may

[2:09:52] a
[2:09:53] a passing sermon but father may be life
[2:09:55] to our souls
[2:09:57] or maybe just recognize more and more
[2:09:59] the position that we are
[2:10:00] in and the time with which you have
[2:10:03] brought us to lord
[2:10:05] help us lord to come to a greater

[2:10:43] have failed you
[2:10:46] the times father where we've held on to
