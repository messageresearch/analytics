[44:33] portion of this on the token a long time
[44:37] ago
[44:38] so I just wanted to pick it up from

[44:41] points here won't be too long here on
[44:44] the Wednesday night so we just want to
[44:46] just go over a few things let's turn in
[44:49] Exodus 12 3 to 13 tonight Exodus 12
[44:55] which is familiar Scripture has to do
[44:59] with again the token the exodus in Egypt
[45:08] at that time we all know there's 3
[45:14] exodus and that happened in in this age
[45:19] I guess you bring that you can bring
[45:26] that presentation up to other math close
[45:30] it there so
[45:37] Exodus 12 and verse 3 speak ye unto all
[45:42] the congregation of Israel saying in the
[45:44] tenth day of this month they shall take
[45:47] to them every man a lamb according to
[45:51] the house of their fathers a lamb for an
[45:56] house and if the household be too little
[45:59] for the lamb let him and his neighbor
[46:01] next next unto his nose take it
[46:04] according to the number of souls every
[46:07] man according for his eating shall make
[46:10] your count for the lamb your lamb shall
[46:12] be without blemish a male for the first
[46:15] year all this being a type of course ye
[46:17] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[46:20] the goats and he shall keep it until the
[46:22] fourteenth day of the same month and the
[46:25] whole Assembly of the congregation of
[46:27] Israel shall kill it in the evening they
[46:31] shall take of the blood and strike it on
[46:33] the two side posts on the upper door
[46:37] upper doorpost of the houses wherein
[46:41] they shall eat it and we know that it's
[46:48] two sides and and the doorpost
[46:51] it's not on the threshold because you
[46:54] cannot walk over that bullet you can't
[46:56] tread down that blood so they only do it
[46:59] decides in the top verse 8 and they
[47:07] shall eat the flesh in the night roast
[47:09] with fire and of course that was Holy
[47:12] Ghost and unleavened bread and with
[47:15] bitter herbs and they shall eat it eat
[47:17] enough of it raw nor sodden at all with
[47:20] water but roast would fire his head in
[47:22] his legs and the puritans thereof and it
[47:27] was roasted whole it wasn't divided up
[47:29] it was all had to be eaten and and it's
[47:32] type of the word you know is where
[47:36] that's oh you have to take all the word
[47:38] right so he had to eat all the land you
[47:40] have to take all all the word and
[47:42] consume all the word and live by all the
[47:44] word and it would be a you know good for
[47:47] you
[47:51] so first ten and he and he shall let
[47:55] nothing of it remain until the morning
[47:57] and that which remain of it until the
[47:59] morning he shall burn with fire and thus
[48:01] shall we eat you eat it with your loins
[48:04] gird girded and your shoes on your feet
[48:07] and your staff in your hand and he shall
[48:09] eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[48:12] Passover first of all for I will pass
[48:17] through the land of Egypt this night and
[48:20] will smite all the firstborn in the land
[48:23] of Egypt both man and beast and against

[50:36] john john wesley by sanctification what
[50:39] was the third Pentecost with the
[50:41] restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost
[50:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the
[50:45] fourth the word what the word they were
[50:47] the four great prophets one of them
[50:50] Martin Luther he began to shine a light
[50:52] there was a little light just a very
[50:54] small strength of justification
[50:57] Along Came Wesley stronger
[51:00] sanctification after Wesley came to
[51:02] stronger than him Pentecostal the
[51:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost in another
[51:07] great prophets II but in the last days
[51:10] of Malachi for Elijah's to come with the
[51:13] very word the Word of God came to the
[51:15] Prophet in the beginning in the evening
[51:18] lights is to come forth to restore and
[51:21] bring back what to turn the hearts of
[51:23] the children back to the faith of the
[51:25] father and this is the fourth light I'll
[51:28] just continue on with the next one here
[51:29] from the token therefore as the evening
[51:32] shadows are appearing and the wrath is
[51:34] ready to be poured out from the out from
[51:37] on high upon the ungodly nations and
[51:40] upon the ungodly unbelievers the
[51:43] professors without a profession upon
[51:45] these things and I've tried to unfold
[51:47] myself
[51:48] and live right among it and see where
[51:51] we're standing before I said these
[51:53] things now we are living in the shadows
[51:55] and the wrath is ready to strike and God
[51:58] is requiring a token that you yourself
[52:00] have received his token the Holy Ghost
[52:02] it's the only way and the only sign that
[52:05] God will ever pass because it is the
[52:07] literal life of Jesus Christ
[52:09] returned back onto the believer so in
[52:11] you know a brother branham goes through
[52:14] it and he says you know we had to have
[52:15] the Holy Ghost in this age and of course
[52:17] we know that that you know there was
[52:23] Holy Ghost sin and all it was Holy Ghost
[52:26] in the day of Pentecost Holy Ghost in
[52:28] all of the ages and just just a little
[52:31] review there but to explain it and
[52:33] brother Branham brother Branham talked
[52:37] about the son of man when it came in it
[52:39] was the fullest or the Holy Ghost the
[52:41] fullness of God in that in that man
[52:44] Jesus Christ who came and then as he as
[52:48] he went and as he went on the cross and
[52:52] was crucified and he was died and was
[52:55] buried resurrected and came into the
[52:58] Upper Room at that time you know D he
[53:02] came as the Son of God it was the son of
[53:04] God then when his his spirit and it was
[53:08] the first time in the last last time we
[53:12] talked about the promise in Ezekiel 37
[53:16] that he said I will sanctify thee and
[53:18] that was the promise that he would come
[53:21] in and be in his children he would
[53:24] sanctify his his own and he would by the
[53:27] Holy Ghost come into each one's heart
[53:29] and there would be a holy holy life for
[53:33] God to dwell in and that's what he would
[53:35] manifest in his age in order to bring us
[53:38] all back to the beginning and to redeem
[53:40] each one back to into the presence of
[53:42] God wants more so he would sanctify he
[53:45] would sanctify each one and that's what
[53:48] was the beginning of it the fulfillment
[53:49] of it there in the upper room and of
[53:51] course knowing that there was a whole
[53:53] plan of God but in that night and it was
[53:55] it was the first time it was a it was a
[53:58] wonderful wonderful period in the in the
[54:01] whole plan of God was that
[54:02] perón and you know what they were like
[54:04] you know they were they were there and
[54:06] Jesus was raised and he was he was
[54:09] waiting for the 50th day where it would
[54:10] be Pentecost and and and he told the
[54:14] disciples to go into the upper room and
[54:17] to to wait to be endued with power from
[54:20] on high because they were they knew he
[54:24] was a king and they knew there was going
[54:25] to be a kingdom but they were still
[54:26] looking for a physical Kingdom but it
[54:28] wasn't going to be like at that at that
[54:29] point in that period of history it
[54:31] wasn't going to be like that it was
[54:33] going to be the Holy Spirit and the
[54:35] fulfilling fulfillment of those
[54:37] scriptures that he would come and live
[54:39] in a people in a body of people and he
[54:42] would sanctify them and the Holy Ghost
[54:44] would would be their guide in that age
[54:49] so what happened on the day of Pentecost
[54:51] is where they were talking about when
[54:54] his kingdom would come and he say you
[54:56] know you will be in do it on par with
[54:58] power that was the Holy Ghost and that's
[55:00] what happened then so 120 they're right
[55:02] in the Holy Ghost and they were there
[55:04] waiting you know
[55:05] just like us you know you were waiting
[55:07] and you know for the God God's promise
[55:11] to be fulfilled and you know they some
[55:14] of them went back working before that
[55:15] you know before Jesus came and told him
[55:17] you know go and wait for me in the in
[55:20] the upper room in Galilee and then the
[55:23] Holy Ghost came and then there was no
[55:25] difference so at that point a hundred
[55:27] and twenty people became like that one
[55:29] person there was 120 Jesus there and
[55:32] this is you know like if someone like
[55:33] Saul maybe who was watching all this you
[55:35] know there was troublesome you know
[55:37] because he was he would they were trying
[55:39] to eliminate this from Israel and from
[55:42] Jerusalem but at that point you know
[55:45] when they were in dude were on would
[55:47] power on high it became very difficult
[55:49] because there was 120 and then when
[55:51] Peter spoke there was another 3,000 and
[55:53] it started to quickly multiply and these
[55:56] people were full of the Holy Ghost
[55:57] this was the full word coming coming to
[56:00] those people at that time and it was a
[56:02] it was something that wasn't going to be
[56:04] stopped right away I mean it was it was
[56:07] going to be carried I was through out
[56:08] the wall in a very short time when this
[56:10] would spread through so so we know that
[56:14] we talked of
[56:15] you know we talk about the holy holy
[56:19] ghost and then know if that's you know
[56:21] it's it's kind of a stumbling as
[56:23] Burberry explains he talks about the
[56:25] Holy Ghost to have to have the Holy
[56:26] Ghost what we think in terms of Luther
[56:28] and he says Luther had the Holy Ghost
[56:30] and he'll say that you know Wesley had
[56:32] the Holy Ghost and Pentagon said the
[56:34] Holy Ghost not add up you know and then
[56:36] Birdman citizen they told me he gotta
[56:37] have the Holy Ghost and just to
[56:39] differentiate differentiate it out you
[56:42] know it takes he does explain it in
[56:44] there and how it would look just a half
[56:54] hour before really helps you know before
[56:58] you come out here so we so in this case
[57:01] here we see that so with how like how I
[57:10] draw and erase it so here just so we see
[57:23] it so we see in the first I'll just
[57:27] stare with the first four the first four
[57:29] ages here and the church ages and before
[57:34] I say that in here
[57:36] brother Branham explained about the
[57:37] prism and when the dawn when the son of
[57:41] man was here was the fullness fullness
[57:43] in in Jesus Christ he was the fullness
[57:44] of God made flesh the son of man that
[57:47] son of man is is is God in flesh and
[57:49] anyone in spirit and became son of God
[57:51] and brother Branham explains it like a
[57:53] prism and he said when the light goes
[57:55] through a prism and he described as
[57:58] father son Holy Ghost and that the light
[58:00] is broken up into seven colors of the
[58:02] rainbow and he said that's what happened
[58:04] with the that's what happened with the
[58:05] son of son of God ministry and what
[58:09] happened is is that that each age
[58:13] received a portion of that spirit it was
[58:16] a it was a an anointing in that in every
[58:19] one of those ages so the sort of Holy
[58:21] Ghost was never in its fullness it was
[58:23] it was it was just a portion of God in
[58:27] each age that would anoint him and it
[58:29] was enough
[58:29] in the first day so would be Paul and he
[58:33] he had the anointing and then right up
[58:34] through all of these messengers up to
[58:36] Luther and Luther in the fifth age he
[58:41] had an anointing and it was a gift
[58:43] gifted a Holy Spirit of justification it
[58:46] was a gift so wasn't the fool and but
[58:50] but Luther didn't live really a holy
[58:53] life as was taught today and any and and
[58:56] God provided the blood that would that
[59:01] would would be there to as a
[59:04] intercession for the sins that were
[59:07] going on in that age but he had but
[59:09] bourbon said he had the Holy Ghost but
[59:11] wasn't all revealed at that time so then
[59:14] when Wesley came along he had
[59:17] sanctification Holy Ghost and the gift
[59:19] of sanctification and he also had this
[59:22] part but he still needed the blood over
[59:24] here to cleanse his sins he still
[59:27] required to blood right up to Pentecost
[59:29] service the sixth age the cementation
[59:31] all of these had a portion of the full
[59:34] anointing of God and there's the
[59:36] Pentecost so we we can see that it was
[59:39] never perfect in those ages well how do
[59:42] you know that well you know that because
[59:44] of all the black right especially at the
[59:49] end it was all black and as you know
[59:51] Burt Branham only put a portion in there
[59:53] was a lot you know the lot that needed
[59:56] to be covered by the blood and and Jesus
[59:59] was over over here in the eternities and
[1:00:01] he was interested interceding for all
[1:00:04] all of us all of the Saints Trudie ages
[1:00:07] but they were Saints they were wise
[1:00:09] virgins they all will be raptured the
[1:00:12] ones that that were were his in that
[1:00:14] bloodline you know that came to that had
[1:00:17] that portion of the Holy Ghost and it
[1:00:19] wasn't to discredit that's all that was
[1:00:21] there at that time in each age right so
[1:00:24] here they had the in Pentecost they had
[1:00:26] the gift of the Holy Ghost and that was
[1:00:29] that was really what brother Brian says
[1:00:32] is the gifts of the it was just the
[1:00:36] gifts of the Holy Ghost it was the gifts
[1:00:38] that were restored in that day and they
[1:00:40] did have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:41] but it wasn't the full
[1:00:43] word it wasn't a full word it wasn't
[1:00:45] until this aid this is 7a and this is 7b
[1:00:49] so if you take the Laodicean age it was
[1:00:52] really the the first part was the
[1:00:54] pentecostal age it was all Pentecost but
[1:00:56] there was a but there was a part in the
[1:00:58] age in 63 when the word was restored
[1:01:01] right so then that the full word was
[1:01:03] restored and that changed things
[1:01:04] altogether that was a that was a
[1:01:07] different thing altogether in our age so
[1:01:14] just uh just to run through here and we
[1:01:17] know that there was the first Exodus in
[1:01:19] in in in in in the book of Exodus when
[1:01:26] Moses was was there and it would there
[1:01:29] was the second Exodus and third Exodus
[1:01:31] second Exodus being in Jesus time and
[1:01:33] then the third Exodus and the last time
[1:01:35] in our age right
[1:01:36] so we last time we went through the
[1:01:39] first Exodus and in the in the second
[1:01:41] Exodus here we know that you know that
[1:01:44] the things that we see in these ages is
[1:01:46] a prophet on the scene and Christ being
[1:01:48] the prophet in this game he came as a
[1:01:50] prophet he was he was there as as
[1:01:53] prophet and then he would be as priests
[1:01:56] and then he would be as king and we've
[1:01:58] we got who we went through that in
[1:02:00] detail priest
[1:02:03] Trudy's church ages when he was an
[1:02:04] intercessor and then King in the time
[1:02:07] under millennium he would be the son of
[1:02:10] David in the king so here here in we
[1:02:15] know that Jesus was slain and it was it
[1:02:19] was the elements of of the Exodus it
[1:02:21] that it was evening time it was always
[1:02:24] in the evening time into the last part
[1:02:26] when there was darkness upon the earth
[1:02:28] and now we see gross darkness upon the
[1:02:30] earth upon the people and that's that's
[1:02:33] the time of the Exodus and there's only
[1:02:35] been three of these events in you know
[1:02:37] in all the history of time so in this in
[1:02:41] this case there was a prophet on the
[1:02:42] scene just just there was moses in the
[1:02:44] prophet and we had our prophet in this
[1:02:46] age and then he was slain as the lamb
[1:02:50] was slain and he descended into the
[1:02:53] earth
[1:02:54] and he was there for three days and then
[1:02:57] the resurrection and then he made
[1:03:01] appearances at that time to show that he
[1:03:04] had risen and then he ascended to the
[1:03:06] Father because he had to bring that
[1:03:07] blood sacrifice into and show that he he
[1:03:11] had come and fulfilled the penalty price
[1:03:15] of for sin and then and then what
[1:03:19] happened in here in 33 AD is the upper
[1:03:22] room and he had told people to go they
[1:03:26] told us the safest to go into the upper
[1:03:28] room and wait for him until they are
[1:03:30] endued with power on unhide did they
[1:03:32] know what there was no they were still
[1:03:33] expecting something physical to happen
[1:03:35] but in this case it was spiritual and in
[1:03:38] the first Exodus it was the actual blood
[1:03:40] of the Lamb in here was the in this case
[1:03:43] it was the blood of Jesus Christ and it
[1:03:46] wasn't the blood that was going to be
[1:03:47] applied to anybody it was going to be
[1:03:49] the life that was in that blood so the
[1:03:52] actual blood of Jesus just went down
[1:03:53] into the ground and just disappeared and
[1:03:55] and into the ground and went back to the
[1:03:59] earth but that spirit came back as the
[1:04:01] Holy Spirit and endued those people on
[1:04:03] high sort of so we see it as the is the
[1:04:08] first stage at the beginning it is
[1:04:10] really the first stage I would call it
[1:04:12] the first stage was really the end of
[1:04:14] the Old Testament right there was the
[1:04:16] fulfillment right there of many many
[1:04:18] things in the Old Testament and we saw
[1:04:19] the beginning of the New Testament so it
[1:04:21] was a very pivotal point from that
[1:04:23] Covenant to the New Covenant and the it
[1:04:26] it was in that in that period because we
[1:04:29] know that the first stage when brother
[1:04:30] Brian puts it out it only started in in
[1:04:33] 55 ad that's what brother Branham puts
[1:04:35] that first stage really starting though
[1:04:37] you know and you know we really see it
[1:04:40] as it was the beginning of it when the
[1:04:42] disciples were on the earth but it was a
[1:04:44] time that that and I first I heard was
[1:04:48] brother Donnie Reagan saying it is that
[1:04:51] that there was a bride age right at the
[1:04:52] beginning of those those years just like
[1:04:55] we see a bride age at the end there's
[1:04:57] not that there's another age it's a
[1:04:59] brother Brennan said bride age and he
[1:05:01] said bride time and I'll just use bride
[1:05:05] time here not to confuse anyone that
[1:05:08] another age because there's only seven
[1:05:09] ages but there's a portion of time when
[1:05:12] there was a bride age vertebra and since
[1:05:14] I call you no more Church I called you
[1:05:16] bride and in this time time although was
[1:05:18] not mentioned is that it it it would
[1:05:21] appear that it was was the same in in
[1:05:24] the in that that God would show a
[1:05:27] manifestation of himself in the people
[1:05:30] that people would recognize and he said
[1:05:32] in this age it was going to happen as
[1:05:34] well where he would show that that this
[1:05:38] this was the right message of all the
[1:05:40] messages that are on the earth today
[1:05:41] there is going to be a short period when
[1:05:44] his his message is going to be
[1:05:46] manifested on the earth through a people
[1:05:49] and that's that's a people who will be
[1:05:51] totally totally slain
[1:05:55] there be nothing left to those people
[1:05:57] because he won't share it with anyone
[1:06:00] he'll never share it with anyone it has
[1:06:02] to be him so he's gonna all he's gonna
[1:06:05] do is use that vessel he really doesn't
[1:06:07] want anything he got if you think he got
[1:06:09] something that he he wants he doesn't he
[1:06:11] just wants a someone who can move
[1:06:14] themselves out of the way and let him
[1:06:16] come in and dwell and manifest himself
[1:06:18] and his power in inner people upon the
[1:06:22] earth and when you saw with brother
[1:06:23] Graham many times in a prayer line he
[1:06:27] could move out of it away you wouldn't
[1:06:28] even know what was going on you know and
[1:06:30] he'd have to ask you know what happened
[1:06:31] it was this happened December so that's
[1:06:33] that's the kind of manifestation that
[1:06:35] you're gonna see in the last Aeneas and
[1:06:37] you can read about that in the adoption
[1:06:39] series he talks about that a fair amount
[1:06:42] so here we see the the first age and the
[1:06:46] just that little segment before the
[1:06:49] really the definition of the first stage
[1:06:51] is when you know the bride is manifested
[1:06:54] on earth and if you read in acts 6 it
[1:06:56] talks about people who are full of the
[1:06:58] Holy Ghost it is not anywhere partial
[1:07:01] like this
[1:07:01] there's nothing partial in it it's the
[1:07:04] full fullness of the Holy Ghost in these
[1:07:06] people as as the Bible says and then
[1:07:10] there was something lost there was
[1:07:12] something lost you know in in the first
[1:07:15] stage because it says in the first stage
[1:07:17] they lost they fell away from their
[1:07:20] first law
[1:07:21] they lost her it was the first thing
[1:07:23] that said in in revelations chapter 2
[1:07:30] verse 1 says a 1 or 2 it says they had
[1:07:33] they fell away from their first love and
[1:07:34] it started to it started to move away
[1:07:37] from the the fullness that bride bride
[1:07:40] time that was there in the first 20
[1:07:43] years of since the Upper Room and there
[1:07:48] we see the token is that that that you
[1:07:53] know it it had when the token is
[1:07:56] displayed say in the Old Testament when
[1:07:59] in the exodus age when when that blood
[1:08:03] was on the dirt on the door doorposts
[1:08:06] ended and the and the header that and
[1:08:10] and then there was blood inside and
[1:08:12] there was blood outside and Bertram's
[1:08:14] said it had to be displayed outside it
[1:08:16] had to be it had to be shown outside and
[1:08:19] then there was blood inside also but but
[1:08:23] that but it the most important thing it
[1:08:25] had to be out being displayed and as
[1:08:27] they were doing their thing and you know
[1:08:29] all that they had to do and eat the lamb
[1:08:31] and sacrifice the lamb and eat eat all
[1:08:33] of that lamp that was the only that was
[1:08:36] the only thing that would saved him
[1:08:39] you know you could say amen to that I
[1:08:42] mean it was it was only the token and
[1:08:44] then here the only thing that could be
[1:08:46] saved at that point was the token here
[1:08:48] and we're into that same point again now
[1:08:51] you know here you could you you could be
[1:08:55] in Haran and and be saved you know it
[1:08:58] was it was he winked at that ignorance
[1:09:01] here and he knew what was going on he
[1:09:04] knew that all of it wasn't revealed at
[1:09:07] that time that it wasn't the full word
[1:09:09] it wasn't the full Holy Ghost but when
[1:09:11] the full Holy Ghost the token comes on
[1:09:13] the scene when the full Holy Ghost is
[1:09:15] manifested in in a person then it can
[1:09:20] only be the message that's it
[1:09:22] it can only mean where the blood is it
[1:09:24] can only be where the full Holy Ghost is
[1:09:26] you have to have that full Holy Ghost
[1:09:28] you can't be up you can't have that
[1:09:30] Pentecostal Holy Ghost here and the
[1:09:33] gifts to the Holy Ghost you have to be
[1:09:35] under that there's no and and you could
[1:09:37] before you could hear but you can't hear
[1:09:40] it has to be it has to be the the
[1:09:44] message any our the message that the
[1:09:46] Prophet is bringing that where the blood
[1:09:48] is because as we said the last time in
[1:09:51] that quote from indictment I don't have
[1:09:53] it but the word is is the path to the to
[1:09:56] the blood the full word and the full
[1:09:59] blood so in this case is all awful and
[1:10:02] it's it's in this age and it's in that
[1:10:06] age and it's in the exodus age and
[1:10:07] they're all parallel so in this case
[1:10:11] here he did you notice in the first
[1:10:15] twenty years you know a lot of
[1:10:17] scriptures that many of the many of the
[1:10:19] disciples Paul and Peter and Jude and
[1:10:22] all these are giving our warnings at
[1:10:23] this point because they know what's
[1:10:25] coming they know there's going to be a
[1:10:27] fallen in a way and we know there's a
[1:10:28] fallen away we seem to fall in the way
[1:10:30] you know we've been taught the falling
[1:10:31] away and ever since that point and we
[1:10:34] know it from here that it started and
[1:10:38] more and more until it almost has wiped
[1:10:40] off the earth especially in the Dark
[1:10:42] Ages in the fourth age so as an example
[1:10:51] Jude said beloved when I gave all
[1:10:53] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:10:55] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:10:57] to write unto you and exhort that you
[1:10:59] should earnestly contend for the faith
[1:11:01] which was once delivered unto the Saints
[1:11:04] he says you really got a hold on to this
[1:11:06] because there's something coming he
[1:11:08] they're seeing something come I Peter
[1:11:10] said I stir up your pure Minds by way of
[1:11:12] remembrance that he may be mindful of
[1:11:15] the words which were spoken before by
[1:11:18] the holy prophets and of the
[1:11:20] commandments of us the apostles of the
[1:11:23] Lord and Savior knowing this first that
[1:11:26] there shall come the first delay in the
[1:11:29] last days scoffers walking after their
[1:11:31] own lusts so they're aware because
[1:11:35] they're under a full word nothing is
[1:11:37] sealed in like it got sealed in with
[1:11:41] John the Revelator and he was two years
[1:11:43] on that island and he was told to seal
[1:11:46] up the things that are going to happen
[1:11:48] and they wouldn't be revealed until now
[1:11:50] and that seal that sealing up meant that
[1:11:54] the it was it was put in symbol form and
[1:11:59] what we saw in our day and we and last
[1:12:04] time we were talking about this I talked
[1:12:07] about I I put up the quote about I put
[1:12:12] up the quote in in the piece of the
[1:12:15] trumpets and that Christ was freed a
[1:12:18] bird I'm announced that you know price
[1:12:20] was creep freed because he was not
[1:12:22] hindering anymore by creeds and dogmas
[1:12:25] in denominations because the full word
[1:12:27] the token had been had come on the scene
[1:12:29] so now Christ was free you know and that
[1:12:33] these things would be made known in this
[1:12:35] age so in this case in this case in the
[1:12:40] terms of Revelation just like being on
[1:12:42] the Exodus I don't know if it's parallel
[1:12:44] or any I'm saying that but in John's
[1:12:46] time he Saudis he saw John the Revelator
[1:12:49] he saw these these the what was going to
[1:12:52] happen
[1:12:52] and we know that a lot of it has come to
[1:12:55] pass and a lot of it deals with the
[1:12:57] three-and-a-half years of tribulation
[1:12:58] and then after the tribulation when we
[1:13:02] go into millennium and and the new city
[1:13:05] etc but a lot of it that he saw was put
[1:13:09] into symbols form John didn't really
[1:13:11] understand it all he did he was he saw
[1:13:14] it he didn't understand the symbols and
[1:13:16] he wrote he wrote it all down and then
[1:13:19] there was some there was no there was no
[1:13:21] symbols at all like the seventh seal the
[1:13:23] seventh seal didn't have any symbol at
[1:13:25] all you know the other ones that could
[1:13:27] say in you know the first horse rider
[1:13:30] and he had a bow and arrow
[1:13:32] he had a bowl and no arrows and he was
[1:13:35] on a white horse and or you know they
[1:13:37] were timeless scales and you know in the
[1:13:40] third third seal and stuff like that so
[1:13:43] they all had a lot of symbols and we we
[1:13:45] didn't we didn't they were all sealed he
[1:13:48] said to seal it all up and no one knew
[1:13:50] it and if you go back and look at the
[1:13:51] the people who the commentaries and that
[1:13:55] me you go through all of the different
[1:13:58] books in the
[1:13:59] the Bible but if you if you look at
[1:14:03] revelation they'll say well could be
[1:14:05] this and it could be hath and wait to
[1:14:08] this may be that it's hard even to bring
[1:14:10] it back and of course we know that Burt
[1:14:11] Brennan did that so when he came along
[1:14:14] the second time and brother Branham came
[1:14:16] along and what he did is he basically
[1:14:18] took away the symbol so we could see the
[1:14:21] we could see now that you know the horse
[1:14:24] riders were son Antichrist and things
[1:14:26] like that so he removed all of those
[1:14:28] things for the bride and he could he
[1:14:31] could lay out then not that it was
[1:14:34] fulfilled but he could say what was
[1:14:36] gonna come to pass so here when we come
[1:14:38] along in the Third Age and then in
[1:14:40] chapter 4 in all the ages in chapter 4
[1:14:43] he says come up hither and I'll show you
[1:14:45] things that was shortly come to pass and
[1:14:46] then he starts showing us he while
[1:14:49] you're up there in heavenly places he
[1:14:51] starts showing of these things of the
[1:14:53] seals and the ages and what was going to
[1:14:57] happen in the tribulation and that I
[1:14:59] thought and all of this he's just taken
[1:15:01] off the symbols and letting you see it
[1:15:03] and that was the third third really
[1:15:06] changing that by removing those symbols
[1:15:09] and letting you see it and then the last
[1:15:11] one is in the last day when it actually
[1:15:13] all comes to pass and some of it has
[1:15:17] already come to pass and brother Branham
[1:15:18] told us what what all that meant he told
[1:15:21] us what the ages what there were seven
[1:15:23] ages and him represented seven periods
[1:15:25] and there was a messenger and and a lot
[1:15:28] of these in in there a lot of times it
[1:15:30] says angel but it was really people it
[1:15:33] was messengers - who were on the earth
[1:15:35] and doing these things so he showed us
[1:15:38] what has already transpired and then
[1:15:41] he's showing us what it's going to
[1:15:43] transpire and in in and you know just
[1:15:47] listen to like Jenkins and he said that
[1:15:50] when when you get seven when you get to
[1:15:54] seven of something then it's revealed
[1:15:56] it's like the seven ages and in
[1:15:58] Revelation chapter one there's he talks
[1:16:02] about he says seven about twenty times
[1:16:04] because we're in the light he shown that
[1:16:06] it's in the last age it's in the last of
[1:16:09] time and then seven everything is
[1:16:11] revealed so brother Branham
[1:16:13] he was into the Seventh Seal he could
[1:16:14] reveal all the other seals and in the
[1:16:17] seventh age he could reveal all the
[1:16:18] seals but when it came to the trumpets
[1:16:20] he couldn't he couldn't reveal that he
[1:16:22] kind of said I don't know what's one in
[1:16:24] one two three and four but five and six
[1:16:29] things he has a view of it because it
[1:16:31] overlapped with the Gentiles and the
[1:16:33] seven he couldn't but when that seventh
[1:16:35] angel comes in revelation 11 when
[1:16:40] they're there on Israel they will be in
[1:16:42] the seventh trumpet and they will reveal
[1:16:44] all the seven trumpets of what they were
[1:16:46] to the Jews so just like the seals were
[1:16:48] to us is the same as the trumpets were
[1:16:50] to the Jews and they'll be in but
[1:16:52] program couldn't because it wasn't his
[1:16:53] ministry and he wasn't in seven he got
[1:16:55] to be in seven that's it I'm saying I'm
[1:16:58] a numbers guy like that or something but
[1:17:02] it makes a whole lot of sense that it
[1:17:04] would be seven and when all of these
[1:17:06] things are opened up so here in if you
[1:17:09] come around along in Revelation 2 and
[1:17:11] revelation 3 and hearing now you're in
[1:17:14] the seventh age and we go into this
[1:17:16] little period of the bride age same as
[1:17:19] over here now you got the bride age then
[1:17:22] brother Branham was able to reveal all
[1:17:25] these things and show us what will
[1:17:26] surely come to pass and it will quickly
[1:17:28] come to pass and he opened all of that
[1:17:31] and we know that he spent a lot of time
[1:17:33] and revealed much and there's much more
[1:17:35] to be revealed
[1:17:36] but we know what in Revelation 10 he
[1:17:39] said that it will be revealed in the
[1:17:42] last day and it was revealed but doesn't
[1:17:44] mean we understand at all because it it
[1:17:46] it's revealed by coming to pass and so
[1:17:49] we're waiting for it to come to pass and
[1:17:51] then we see oh well that's what brother
[1:17:52] Brian said you know and the fivefold
[1:17:54] ministry does a good job of that so so
[1:17:58] here so these so these three were we're
[1:18:02] into this piece of it where it's being
[1:18:04] revealed to the bride the world still
[1:18:06] doesn't know it they won't know what
[1:18:07] they'll never see it they'll be blinded
[1:18:09] to it unless it's on mr. call to see it
[1:18:12] because it's because the discreet in
[1:18:18] Corinthians it says that that will you
[1:18:21] have to be spiritually discerned and I
[1:18:24] haven't got that here but sits in
[1:18:26] it's in first corinthians 3 i think to
[1:18:30] first corinthians 2 if you want to turn
[1:18:33] to it just for a second
[1:18:44] so in just started verse thirteen so
[1:18:49] this is first Corinthians two and I
[1:18:52] think it's just not worthy here as I
[1:18:56] thought it was good
[1:18:57] we start at verse ten but God has
[1:19:01] revealed them unto us by his Spirit for
[1:19:04] the spirit searches all things she ate
[1:19:06] two deep things of God for what man
[1:19:08] knoweth the things of a man save the
[1:19:11] spirit of Man which is in him even so
[1:19:15] that the Holy Ghost so even so the
[1:19:16] things of God knoweth no man but the
[1:19:18] Spirit of God now we have received not
[1:19:21] the spirit of the world but the Spirit
[1:19:23] which is of God the Holy Ghost we are
[1:19:27] endued with power on high that we might
[1:19:30] know the things which are freely given
[1:19:32] to us of God verse 13 which things also
[1:19:36] we speak not in the words which man's
[1:19:38] wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost
[1:19:41] teaches comparing spiritual things with
[1:19:44] spiritual and verse 14 but the natural
[1:19:47] man receives not the things of the
[1:19:49] Spirit of God for they are foolishness
[1:19:51] unto them that's why they don't
[1:19:53] understand what happened in Revelation
[1:19:56] they still have a veil over them neither
[1:19:58] can he know them because they are
[1:20:01] spiritually discerned and that and what
[1:20:05] that means and you can write it in your
[1:20:07] Bible like I did because it really
[1:20:10] clarifies it it says spiritually
[1:20:13] discerned it spiritually understood so
[1:20:15] it has to be spiritually understood you
[1:20:19] can't understand it through your mind
[1:20:20] and that's Revelation it has to be
[1:20:23] revealed to you
[1:20:24] right so you you know these things by
[1:20:28] spiritually you are spiritually
[1:20:30] discerned
[1:20:31] so you spiritually understand you
[1:20:34] spiritually understand them thank God
[1:20:36] for that so that means you don't have to
[1:20:39] understand everything but you had to
[1:20:41] believe it you know you have to believe
[1:20:42] every word yeah you know you must
[1:20:45] understand every word no you you have to
[1:20:47] believe every word it's all according to
[1:20:49] the heart right you can't leave it off
[1:20:51] where we have to be mindful of those
[1:20:54] things that come about in all you know
[1:20:58] you sound a Peter says there in the
[1:21:03] second second scripture knowing first
[1:21:06] that there shall come in the last days
[1:21:07] scoffers walking after their own lusts
[1:21:09] right and those are the things that
[1:21:12] would deceive you but we are not of them
[1:21:15] that drawback amen
[1:21:17] so we're good and Peter here also would
[1:21:22] another warning wherefore the rather
[1:21:24] brethren give diligence to make make
[1:21:27] your calling election Shore for if you
[1:21:29] do these things you shall never never
[1:21:31] fall I mean they're just planting seeds
[1:21:35] here and you know it's right through to
[1:21:37] the gospel that the epistles there where
[1:21:39] they're talking about you know there's
[1:21:42] something coming and you gotta be you
[1:21:44] know and and it was it was it was hard
[1:21:46] you know right through the first three
[1:21:48] Ages it was continued declining even
[1:21:51] though they're all and still under there
[1:21:52] was messengers but it was Paul's
[1:21:54] teaching to us first three ages and the
[1:21:56] fourth age it was almost white bread off
[1:21:57] the earth and it was only he's only a
[1:21:59] little bit of light left there and the
[1:22:02] Catholic Church came in and were formed
[1:22:04] and grew and as I said before they still
[1:22:07] look at it as their glory years the
[1:22:10] glory years to the Catholic Church then
[1:22:12] when you know those millions were were
[1:22:17] you know persecuted and those are the
[1:22:22] ones they have records for they have
[1:22:24] records to them you know and we know
[1:22:26] there's a lot more than that you know
[1:22:27] but they were keeping records at all so
[1:22:30] they had full dominion over that whole
[1:22:32] thing right and and it was certainly a
[1:22:34] hard time for those in that fourth age
[1:22:38] and it wasn't until the fifties when
[1:22:40] Luther started to come back in and and
[1:22:42] it was just one religion there was just
[1:22:44] one religion then there was nothing else
[1:22:46] it was just a Catholic religion and they
[1:22:49] they they had already said they are
[1:22:52] going to just dare to go and explain
[1:22:54] everything you know no one needs to
[1:22:57] explain anything the church will make a
[1:22:59] decision on all of those things and it
[1:23:01] was and then that's what Luther the full
[1:23:03] thing he was doing was coming in and
[1:23:05] saying you know you got it wrong and
[1:23:08] they really went against him for that
[1:23:10] for that theory that
[1:23:12] he that the catholic church' was wrong
[1:23:14] and he said to just shall live by faith
[1:23:16] and not by an institution or a
[1:23:18] denomination in those days and then what
[1:23:21] it did then which was too bad he said if
[1:23:23] if there wasn't one religion anymore you
[1:23:26] know one way of doing it there was many
[1:23:29] many forms
[1:23:30] you know many denominations and that
[1:23:32] spirited denomination really went off
[1:23:34] but they were the daughters of that one
[1:23:36] and Paul here says and I know this that
[1:23:40] after my departing shall Grievous wolves
[1:23:43] enter in among you not sparing the flock
[1:23:45] also of your own selves shall men arise
[1:23:47] speaking perverse things to draw many
[1:23:50] disciples after them therefore watch and
[1:23:53] remember that by by the space of three
[1:23:55] years I ceased not to warn every one
[1:23:58] night and day with tears and and he did
[1:24:02] because he could they could see it
[1:24:03] coming two disciples knew what was what
[1:24:06] was on the mall so it's always evening
[1:24:08] time and this is just a summary of this
[1:24:10] three would just get back to that but
[1:24:12] you see there's just the similarities
[1:24:14] there's always a pillar of fire and a
[1:24:17] prophet on the scene and then there's a
[1:24:19] death angel in each one there's a lamp
[1:24:21] and then then there's a land of slain in
[1:24:26] the case of this second act is the
[1:24:27] exodus that was Calvary and then there
[1:24:30] was the token was the blood in that age
[1:24:32] and they took that in the first stage
[1:24:34] they smeared us in there in order for
[1:24:36] protection then the second one was the
[1:24:38] blood of Jesus that came and the life
[1:24:40] that was in that blood what came in the
[1:24:42] day of Pentecost and they were in dude
[1:24:43] with power from on high and the first
[1:24:46] one that the exodus was over the Red Sea
[1:24:49] and the same the second Exodus was out
[1:24:54] of the city of Jerusalem at that time it
[1:24:56] was destroyed and they went into that
[1:24:59] Kingdom and due to a time power power in
[1:25:01] the third thing that we have the same
[1:25:03] similarities again it's a pillar of fire
[1:25:04] with with that group and it was a
[1:25:07] prophet so it was vindicated and there
[1:25:09] was a death angel in the land and the
[1:25:13] word was slain there was the indictment
[1:25:15] and all of this happened in a row and
[1:25:17] brother Branham was very excited about
[1:25:19] this when this revelation came and he
[1:25:21] could see all those things like the
[1:25:22] seals and all of the
[1:25:24] the full word coming in the scene again
[1:25:26] so now the the seven spirits that were
[1:25:29] coming through the all all the ages now
[1:25:32] we're up in this cloud and all the seven
[1:25:34] angels were there they could he saw it
[1:25:38] in a vision he saw that coming back in
[1:25:40] the son of man ministry and all those
[1:25:42] spirits into one again just as brother
[1:25:44] Branham explained in the prison and if
[1:25:45] you reverse it it comes back into one
[1:25:47] and that's what happened there in 1963
[1:25:50] is that the son of man ministry started
[1:25:53] and there was the fullness of Christ and
[1:25:55] it was brother Branham he learned after
[1:25:57] it was token time when all of the
[1:26:00] elements that you see here in the other
[1:26:02] ages and he could he he equates to token
[1:26:06] with the exodus so that those three
[1:26:10] periods that mark really the the you
[1:26:15] know those divisions over time over all
[1:26:18] time so the token was there and it was
[1:26:21] the spirit sober I'm saying you know
[1:26:23] it's the Holy Spirit but now it's the
[1:26:25] fullness of the Spirit it was a it
[1:26:27] wasn't before that the the giver was
[1:26:31] giving gifts in in each one of those
[1:26:33] ages but now it was the giver it was the
[1:26:36] full one and he says that he says it in
[1:26:38] various areas in different messages
[1:26:40] where he talks about that this is what
[1:26:42] happened on that on that on earth in
[1:26:45] that last age and in that bride time in
[1:26:49] the last days before the rapture so it's
[1:26:52] a separation it was the time now where
[1:26:54] he had to be under that token and that
[1:26:58] token came through the message became so
[1:27:01] it was okay before 63 it was okay and he
[1:27:05] winked at that he winked at the
[1:27:08] ignorance that was was being taught then
[1:27:10] and he could like Luther
[1:27:12] you know Luther was drinking and smoking
[1:27:15] and and he swore and he wanted to
[1:27:20] eliminate the Jews and you know all of
[1:27:22] those things which were wrong in the
[1:27:23] thing but God winked at it because it
[1:27:25] was just a start of the restoration and
[1:27:28] in Wesley come along and you know he he
[1:27:31] he was justified and he was sanctified
[1:27:33] but he still had the Trinity he still
[1:27:36] ordain women preach
[1:27:37] you know there was a whole lot of things
[1:27:38] that weren't set in order at that point
[1:27:40] and God winked at it and same with
[1:27:42] Pentecost and penny cows thought they
[1:27:44] would they were there but it wasn't
[1:27:46] there you know because it denominated
[1:27:48] they should have never denominated it'll
[1:27:51] never nominate in this stage so we see
[1:27:54] here just the fullness coming here now
[1:27:57] in their spirit that fullness within the
[1:28:00] second days of now in the third Exodus
[1:28:02] it was the fullness again and the Exodus
[1:28:06] here which you know will be the rapture
[1:28:09] it'll be the rapture the exodus will
[1:28:12] take us out into the rapture and there
[1:28:14] will be a tribulation so all similar in
[1:28:19] nature so back to our timeline right so
[1:28:26] now we see in 55 the 80 brought around
[1:28:29] marks the church ages even though it
[1:28:31] really did kind of start but he just
[1:28:33] takes into account that bride age and
[1:28:36] now we see the church ages and and he
[1:28:41] talks about a chasm here he talks about
[1:28:45] a chasm I just
[1:28:56] and it was almost it went on for a long
[1:28:59] time and a lot of things changed in in
[1:29:02] that period as you know but it it was a
[1:29:10] it it couldn't go on that way way all
[1:29:14] the time it had to change it had there
[1:29:16] had to turn a corner and it took a
[1:29:18] profit to turn the corner at that time
[1:29:21] so so at the beginning at that age it
[1:29:26] marked the it might deterioration of the
[1:29:29] of what was delivered on the day of
[1:29:31] Pentecost when they lost their first
[1:29:33] love and he he was he was breaking it
[1:29:36] down in each age you know trying to keep
[1:29:39] it so this is really what I just drew up
[1:29:42] on the board ahead of time and you see
[1:29:44] justification sanctification through all
[1:29:46] these age and I'll true all of these
[1:29:48] ages and I just break up the seventh age
[1:29:51] at 7a and 7b and then we see the Son of
[1:29:54] man coming back and was in its fullness
[1:29:57] in this age which is the bride' age and
[1:29:59] brother Branham announced that he no
[1:30:00] more calls you church but he calls you
[1:30:02] bride and that was marking that that
[1:30:04] change that was going to happen in the
[1:30:06] last age when the word came on the scene
[1:30:09] and we saw that in the first quote there
[1:30:11] so far Brian said desperations and and
[1:30:13] the Holy Ghost is too token that the
[1:30:16] blood has been applied because it
[1:30:17] follows the blood all the way from the
[1:30:20] book of redemption see that was the
[1:30:23] purpose of him coming that's what he
[1:30:25] followed in every age so he he had to go
[1:30:27] through the ages because to recede in
[1:30:29] there so so the the first age really
[1:30:32] could have took a rapture but we know
[1:30:34] the seed went into the ground and the
[1:30:36] cornice the corner this the seed corn
[1:30:40] went into the ground and and came back
[1:30:43] but in this case here you know they
[1:30:46] could have took a rapture down in the
[1:30:47] beginning because the fullness of the
[1:30:48] Holy Ghost
[1:30:48] was there but he had a bloodline that it
[1:30:51] was fallen because he had opened the
[1:30:53] book he you know there was a there was a
[1:30:56] plan of redemption and that that was it
[1:30:58] in a book and when he took that book and
[1:31:01] he opened a book those were the ones
[1:31:03] that were going to be redeemed that were
[1:31:05] in the thoughts of God back in the
[1:31:06] beginning
[1:31:07] he would redeem and bring back in
[1:31:09] rapture so that's what that's what
[1:31:11] happened in that age so it was real
[1:31:14] important that in I just kind of
[1:31:17] rambling a bit here but brother Brian
[1:31:20] said that the fifth chapter of
[1:31:21] Revelation was the most important book
[1:31:23] he said that in in Revelation of the
[1:31:26] church ages in Chapter five and he said
[1:31:29] it was the most important so you know
[1:31:32] because of the church ages and because
[1:31:35] of all the darkness that that Jesus was
[1:31:41] over here on the throne in eternity and
[1:31:43] he was an intercessor so he was gone
[1:31:46] back and he was sitting on the right
[1:31:48] hand of the Father and he was then an
[1:31:50] intercessor for the people in for his
[1:31:53] his people his children in the image in
[1:31:57] the ages and in the what happened in in
[1:32:00] Revelation 5 is that as we read it then
[1:32:04] there was a the the book was closed and
[1:32:08] John went in was just that's just like
[1:32:11] quickly read revelation 5 and verse 1
[1:32:17] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:32:19] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:32:21] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:32:23] seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:32:25] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:32:28] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:32:30] seals around there was no one worthy and
[1:32:32] weak and we know there was only one
[1:32:33] worthy and that was Christ and he was
[1:32:35] over here for the seven ages
[1:32:37] intercessing for the pit was an
[1:32:39] intercessor for the people for all the
[1:32:41] sins and all the things that were
[1:32:44] covered in Luther's day and the
[1:32:46] westerlies day and all that and he was
[1:32:47] interested seating for all of that and
[1:32:49] no man in heaven nor in earth neither
[1:32:51] under the earth was able to open the
[1:32:53] book neither to look thereon and I went
[1:32:55] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:32:57] open and to read the book neither to
[1:33:00] look look upon and one of the elders
[1:33:02] said unto me weep not behold the Lion of
[1:33:05] the tribe of Judah the root of David
[1:33:07] with prevailed to open the book and to
[1:33:10] loose to seven seals thereof and I
[1:33:13] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:33:14] and the four beasts and in the midst of
[1:33:17] the elders to the lamb it had been slain
[1:33:20] have
[1:33:21] seven horns seven eyes which are the
[1:33:23] seven spirits of God knows all the
[1:33:25] sevens is complete and he came and took
[1:33:29] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:33:31] that sat upon the throne and that
[1:33:32] happened Burma and saw that in 63 that
[1:33:35] that's what that's what really happened
[1:33:37] is that was being fulfilled that that
[1:33:40] that Jesus who was who was interceding
[1:33:43] was came out of eternity and he came and
[1:33:46] he took that book and he opened the book
[1:33:49] because in Revelation 10 you see the
[1:33:51] book opened and in that book was the
[1:33:53] names of those that had to be redeemed
[1:33:54] in that age
[1:33:56] so then what he was doing was calling
[1:33:58] his bride he was calling his his bride
[1:34:01] to come stand with him in that period in
[1:34:03] in 63 and that's why you were called
[1:34:05] there today because you heard that call
[1:34:08] and that voice that come and you would
[1:34:10] stand in that last time in the bride age
[1:34:12] with the bridegroom and once all of them
[1:34:15] all of them are comes forth and her
[1:34:17] names are called and they come to the
[1:34:19] Holy Ghost then the rapture will take
[1:34:21] place but this is disi age when he came
[1:34:24] he came in this age in now it began the
[1:34:28] capstone age here and then what what you
[1:34:30] see brother Brian preaching he's he
[1:34:32] starts preaching in perfect faith right
[1:34:35] you're in a perfection now right the
[1:34:38] token is there everything is getting
[1:34:40] ready now for something that never
[1:34:41] happened before which is a rapture I
[1:34:43] needs to be perfect love and everything
[1:34:46] is everything now is right to the final
[1:34:48] until this is all formed and seals onto
[1:34:51] the body so what everyone has to be in
[1:34:53] there and called and we were just
[1:34:56] waiting for that last one to come true
[1:34:57] so he came out of the eternities
[1:35:17] so he said if ever I'm talking about the
[1:35:20] age and he says oh we've had a dip of
[1:35:22] the spirit it was just a portion of that
[1:35:24] spirit in but a branch language there
[1:35:26] was only a portion was allotted to each
[1:35:28] age it wasn't a fullness
[1:35:30] it wasn't a full token it wasn't a full
[1:35:32] word it wasn't a full Holy Ghost it was
[1:35:34] the Holy Ghost a giver given these gifts
[1:35:37] in each age right to bring to build up
[1:35:40] that that Bobby and to call those out
[1:35:42] that they're his aren't a wise virgins
[1:35:45] in those ages absolutely there's their
[1:35:47] water you know Martin Luther will come
[1:35:49] up in the rapture you know because you
[1:35:51] know wasn't his fault that the whole
[1:35:53] world word wasn't revealed if it was
[1:35:55] real Martin Luther would believe it he
[1:35:58] would believe it because you know
[1:35:59] because he was bribed but there was only
[1:36:02] a portion of the Holy Spirit form that's
[1:36:04] why brother Branham says in this age in
[1:36:06] the token he says you know this is the
[1:36:08] Holy Ghost age what it sounds like you
[1:36:10] know well huh didn't Luther have that or
[1:36:13] Wesley no this is the fullness of God
[1:36:15] the full word being revealed it's the
[1:36:17] giver himself it's the full full right
[1:36:21] that will bring a rapture in our age the
[1:36:23] rest won't be resurrected and we're
[1:36:25] waiting for a resurrection because the
[1:36:26] resurrection happens first and then
[1:36:28] those who are alive and remain are
[1:36:29] changed but the first thing is is the
[1:36:32] resurrection and then those that are
[1:36:34] alive and remain will be changed but the
[1:36:36] you'll only be a rapture when there's a
[1:36:38] full word so we've had a dip of the
[1:36:41] spirit we've had spiritual blessings and
[1:36:43] spiritual up rises but we didn't we
[1:36:45] don't need that no more we need a
[1:36:47] revival of the Spirit of the Living God
[1:36:50] in the hearts of the people amen
[1:36:58] some of the Pentecostal people today
[1:37:00] don't even count Martin Luther and them
[1:37:02] because they say he didn't have the Holy
[1:37:04] Ghost he did he might not have had it in
[1:37:06] the depths that we get it in now but it
[1:37:09] wasn't for that time what was it it was
[1:37:15] a body grown from the feet growing up
[1:37:16] comes up more important parts of the
[1:37:19] body from the feet and on into the lungs
[1:37:21] and hearth
[1:37:22] just building up the body who is the
[1:37:24] head and this is the word who who is the
[1:37:27] head
[1:37:27] that's the intelligence house how's the
[1:37:31] body move by the head and the government
[1:37:34] shall be upon watt upon his shoulders
[1:37:37] his body it got it he didn't have any
[1:37:39] trouble government you know hit we have
[1:37:42] trouble with politicians government is
[1:37:44] not the issue there's where the real
[1:37:47] true church speaks in this power there's
[1:37:50] where the Apostolic power returns to the
[1:37:52] church when the government shall be upon
[1:37:54] his shoulders judgment there's coming a
[1:37:56] real church I believe trying to do my
[1:37:59] part to present it have it ready the
[1:38:02] best I know how to present my part in my
[1:38:05] age to Christ when he comes right and
[1:38:08] this is our part here in the fullness
[1:38:12] back to our our timeline here so we see
[1:38:17] in the church ages and there's a there's
[1:38:20] a chasm he talks about a chasm and it
[1:38:22] goes into the breech then when it comes
[1:38:24] to the seals so we see in in 1963 it's
[1:38:32] when the 3rd Exodus really comes at
[1:38:34] brother Branham comes on the scene and
[1:38:36] all of those things that they record
[1:38:38] that we see similar in other Exodus the
[1:38:40] 1st and the 2nd the 3rd comes in now we
[1:38:42] see the pillar fire and the prophet and
[1:38:44] the the lamb and Barbra MCC sinks now
[1:38:48] starting to open up from the seals and
[1:38:50] he says you know that wasn't me to see
[1:38:52] if that was him he did all of that right
[1:38:54] but he sees looking at the indictment
[1:38:56] and he sees the seals being open and the
[1:38:58] word now is being revealed and he's
[1:39:00] starting to see oh there's an indictment
[1:39:02] here you know where they crucified the
[1:39:04] word and he said starting to see the
[1:39:06] similarities until he comes and he he
[1:39:08] preaches to token and he and it's been
[1:39:10] revealed to him now now that we're in it
[1:39:12] and age is the evening hour everything
[1:39:15] is lined up exactly for an exodus in our
[1:39:18] age and he knows then there's going to
[1:39:20] be an exodus which would be the rapture
[1:39:21] not like the second one where it was you
[1:39:26] know it's similar in that you know there
[1:39:27] would be you know power from on high and
[1:39:30] that would come in the bride in this age
[1:39:31] and he's seeing it but it would cause a
[1:39:33] rapture would be you know come to the
[1:39:37] culmination of the time upon earth it
[1:39:40] would be no more right and he sees it
[1:39:42] sees how that's gonna happen in
[1:39:44] Revelation 10 he sees how everything is
[1:39:47] going to happen so here it's a bride
[1:39:50] time at the end so and like I said in in
[1:39:55] the middle here in in this middle part
[1:39:57] and that's and that quote under the
[1:40:01] bloodline is there was seed in here you
[1:40:04] know like this didn't go so well in here
[1:40:06] can you know compared to here with the
[1:40:09] full word and here with the full word
[1:40:11] but there was many seed that had to be
[1:40:12] redeemed in that time and brought
[1:40:14] brought into the into the kingdom and it
[1:40:17] got ready for getting ready for a
[1:40:19] resurrection and they will come up in
[1:40:21] the resurrection and there will be
[1:40:23] people there will be people there
[1:40:25] because and I was going to go into
[1:40:27] Revelation 25 won't get time but there
[1:40:29] is the wise version in the foolish
[1:40:31] virgin and it calls the foolish virgin
[1:40:33] righteous because they were seed but
[1:40:36] they didn't go onto the Holy Ghost but
[1:40:38] in the end you see they all fell asleep
[1:40:40] and then in the last time the word was
[1:40:42] revealed again to a prophet and they
[1:40:44] were they woke and those hair had had
[1:40:47] the oil they had the full loyal they had
[1:40:50] the the The Giver he was he was in there
[1:40:53] and the others wanted to give her but
[1:40:55] you can't give part of that to them you
[1:40:57] know they didn't have it it had leaked
[1:41:00] out they didn't have it they didn't come
[1:41:01] to the Holy Ghost and it was no
[1:41:04] different from what Berta Brennan says
[1:41:06] in terms of you know a cloth like a
[1:41:10] cloth hair and someone was going in
[1:41:12] sewing and they cut out a piece and the
[1:41:15] rest is the remnant which is the foolish
[1:41:17] virgin and they go into into the
[1:41:20] darkness which is tribulation in the
[1:41:22] last day is not is not a hell or
[1:41:24] anything like
[1:41:25] it's a tribulation that they had to go
[1:41:27] through and come up in the second
[1:41:29] resurrection but this part in here they
[1:41:32] go into the first resurrection which is
[1:41:34] the rapture and show up here in the
[1:41:36] second resurrection in Revelation 20 and
[1:41:39] there on the throne would with Christ
[1:41:41] here and the wise were the foolish
[1:41:44] virgins is here before the throne and
[1:41:47] they will be granted eternal life but
[1:41:52] they were these ones weren't in the mind
[1:41:54] of God at the beginning only these were
[1:41:56] and they they they don't go through any
[1:41:59] tribulation because they took it at
[1:42:02] Calvary and they they are here under
[1:42:05] throne with Christ in the second
[1:42:07] resurrection and that's that's when all
[1:42:10] of this is judged and all their foolish
[1:42:13] virgins because they are righteous if
[1:42:14] you read 25 it says the righteous and it
[1:42:17] goes on and says what they did you know
[1:42:19] that gave him that gave him this eternal
[1:42:22] life in the end it was granted to him
[1:42:24] they didn't have that Holy Ghost the
[1:42:28] Holy Ghost at the end the baptism of the
[1:42:30] Holy Ghost so here here now so where
[1:42:35] were we're seeing that there's two ages
[1:42:38] that really come together but in between
[1:42:40] that there was a whole time when these
[1:42:42] he had to follow the bloodline and bring
[1:42:45] these people out and had them you know
[1:42:47] come into the Holy Ghost for a
[1:42:49] resurrection at the end so so brother
[1:42:53] Brian had to deal he in in this in in
[1:42:57] when the seals came along I'm kind of
[1:43:00] touched a whole lot of things here sorry
[1:43:02] if it's a little bit quick here but he
[1:43:04] talks about the abstract title deed and
[1:43:07] he he had to deal with the breach that
[1:43:09] was here in this time because because
[1:43:11] what was made over here was lost so now
[1:43:14] there is had to be a way for them to
[1:43:15] come into and into the fullness of the
[1:43:18] Holy Ghost and he talks about a title
[1:43:20] deed so you could be a Christian you
[1:43:22] have a title of Christian but in all the
[1:43:24] truth of this ages he said they really
[1:43:26] just had a title they didn't have the
[1:43:28] abstract and the abstract is a u.s.
[1:43:30] thing is not Canadian in British
[1:43:32] parliamentary system but the if you you
[1:43:35] could have a title to something but say
[1:43:38] if it was land but you could
[1:43:39] still lose it you know it's possible
[1:43:41] that you could lose it so now in the
[1:43:43] case say Indians who own to that land in
[1:43:46] North America could file a suit and go
[1:43:50] back and search it back and you realize
[1:43:53] the land you thought you owned and your
[1:43:54] parents your grandparents the Indians
[1:43:56] come along and take it because they had
[1:43:58] they had a right to it back then Israel
[1:44:00] says the same thing about Israel right
[1:44:02] they have a they have ownership of that
[1:44:04] right back to the beginning so but in
[1:44:07] this age where Brent said that there was
[1:44:09] an abstract he talks about it many times
[1:44:12] and I have to I have to quote here I
[1:44:15] have it up here and I'll get to it but
[1:44:17] it talks about that in the abstract it
[1:44:20] would it gets cleared right back to the
[1:44:23] beginning right back to God so the one
[1:44:26] who's there in the Garden of Eden like
[1:44:28] they lost that they lost the the title
[1:44:31] deed Adam and Eve did from what they did
[1:44:33] and went back to God so now every part
[1:44:36] for you for every individual because not
[1:44:38] about churches hears about individuals
[1:44:40] they could be that they could be wiped
[1:44:42] out all of what was done right back to
[1:44:46] the beginning to God every one of your
[1:44:48] ancestors whatever trait you have that
[1:44:50] you brought through some Grandpere is
[1:44:52] all gone you were clean right back to
[1:44:54] the beginning so you now you have the
[1:44:56] aunts rank title deed and the abstract
[1:44:58] is the Holy Ghost he says that's what
[1:45:00] you get and what it what it what it
[1:45:02] brought was was the the sea of
[1:45:08] forgetfulness so every bit of that that
[1:45:11] was right back right from the beginning
[1:45:12] was put into the sea of forgetfulness
[1:45:14] and no one can claim anything to your
[1:45:17] inheritance right back to the beginning
[1:45:19] and that's what he talked about in the
[1:45:21] abstract title D and I got some quotes
[1:45:23] there on it so that was a gulf that was
[1:45:28] a gulf that was a chasm that was there
[1:45:30] that no one could cross into until in
[1:45:32] the last stage when the full Holy Ghost
[1:45:34] came and the abstract came so that could
[1:45:37] be cleared and now you got to see a
[1:45:39] forgetfulness and everything is put into
[1:45:40] the sea of forgetfulness and there's no
[1:45:42] one the devil can never make a claim on
[1:45:44] anything you did or your grandfather did
[1:45:47] or your great-grandfather or whatever it
[1:45:48] was all cleared right back and that's
[1:45:50] the difference between an abstract
[1:45:52] and a title deed it was never a rape
[1:45:55] brought right back to the beginning of
[1:45:57] time so in this case then it was we we
[1:46:01] saw this the seals were broken and then
[1:46:04] there was an indictment where they
[1:46:05] rejected it just and the word was
[1:46:08] crucified and then there was a token and
[1:46:15] an exodus took place and after an exodus
[1:46:18] then of course the rest go into a
[1:46:20] tribulation just like in the other ages
[1:46:23] where there was a exit so right here so
[1:46:25] John talking from the breach between the
[1:46:28] seven Church ages and his seven seals
[1:46:31] John hadn't noticed this land before you
[1:46:34] know he hadn't mentioned before now
[1:46:37] nowhere
[1:46:38] had it been mentioned John didn't see it
[1:46:41] all over the heavens see revelation five
[1:46:43] was so important to us because it
[1:46:44] happened in our time it was all
[1:46:47] manifested in our time it's all over the
[1:46:52] heavens as he's looking but here is here
[1:46:55] it come forth where did it come from it
[1:46:58] came from the Father's throne where he
[1:46:59] was seated since he had been slain and
[1:47:02] raised again he raised up and said on
[1:47:04] the right hand of the God right hand of
[1:47:06] God ever living to make intercession
[1:47:08] 'he's raised there today as an
[1:47:11] intercessor with his own blood to make
[1:47:14] intercession upon the ignorance of the
[1:47:16] people all those ages reign his own
[1:47:18] people his bloodline right now now oh
[1:47:22] that's the one I'm depending on he still
[1:47:25] was covered with the bleach the bleach
[1:47:27] of the forgiveness of sin now oh my said
[1:47:32] now the forfeited title deed is now in
[1:47:34] the hands of the original owner Almighty
[1:47:37] God the title deed to the earth and to
[1:47:38] eternal life when Adam forfeited it then
[1:47:42] Satan's dirty hands could not take it so
[1:47:44] it went back to the original owner God
[1:47:46] himself he explains that a number of
[1:47:47] times we're going to find it in just a
[1:47:50] minute there he sits on the throne with
[1:47:52] it with it in his hands the title deed
[1:47:54] and he said that makes me feel religious
[1:47:57] friends a title deed to eternal life
[1:47:59] abstract title deed to eternal life when
[1:48:02] Adam forfeited for wisdom and instead of
[1:48:05] faith it when
[1:48:06] back to the hands of the owner Almighty
[1:48:07] God what a great thing what's it doing
[1:48:10] in the hands of God waiting for the
[1:48:11] redemption claims he made a way of
[1:48:14] redemption he made a way back and
[1:48:16] someday the Redeemer is to take it back
[1:48:19] you see where we're sitting to now we'll
[1:48:23] watch this fellow sitting upon the
[1:48:25] throne all right and this is what
[1:48:27] happened is is that he was called from
[1:48:28] eternity from an intercessor role and
[1:48:31] now he comes as a as a judge he's
[1:48:34] starting to come now as a judge and he
[1:48:37] takes that book and he opens the book
[1:48:38] and he calls his bride in our age and
[1:48:41] that's where we're sitting today waiting
[1:48:45] for the redemption claims it's
[1:48:46] redemption what is this book of
[1:48:48] redemption this title deed this abstract
[1:48:50] title deed you say abstract what does
[1:48:52] abstract mean it means it's searched all
[1:48:55] the way back to its beginning so
[1:48:57] everything is searched means is that
[1:48:58] it's cleared it's clear buried back to
[1:49:00] the beginning like the little drop of
[1:49:02] ink that now he's acquaintance at to to
[1:49:04] see if forgetfulness and that ink this
[1:49:07] morning when it struck that bleach it
[1:49:09] went all the way back and when the sin
[1:49:10] has been confessed and fallen into the
[1:49:13] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:49:14] it gives an abstract right straight back
[1:49:18] to the creator again and you become a
[1:49:20] son of God abstract title deed is held
[1:49:22] in the hand of Almighty they never had
[1:49:24] the abstract to eat only back in the
[1:49:26] first age in that first Bride period
[1:49:28] that they had the abstract deep and they
[1:49:30] lost they lost him it's Redemption means
[1:49:33] all legal possession to all that was
[1:49:35] lost by Adam and Eve oh my what ought
[1:49:37] that to do to a born-again Christian
[1:49:39] it's legal possession of the abstract
[1:49:41] the title deed of eternal life means
[1:49:43] that you persist you possess everything
[1:49:45] that Adam and Eve lost no one can take
[1:49:48] it away from you
[1:49:48] what of it brethren the possession of
[1:49:51] that deed Adam could not meet the
[1:49:54] requirements of redemption after he
[1:49:56] found he lost it he had sinned and he
[1:49:58] separated himself from God and was on
[1:50:01] the side of the chasm so he could not
[1:50:03] redeem it he just couldn't do it he
[1:50:05] needed to redemption himself so he could
[1:50:07] not do it amen
[1:50:10] from the token now the attorney this
[1:50:14] alludes to this indeed token now the
[1:50:16] attorney may think that he was all but
[1:50:18] down but you see
[1:50:20] who is a judge who is a judge is going
[1:50:23] to decide the case whether the attorney
[1:50:25] can make it clear or whether to him that
[1:50:28] you're justified in your deed so he's
[1:50:30] now taken as this abstract title deed is
[1:50:33] being done by him and he's the judge and
[1:50:36] the attorney in 68 paragraph 68 Oh God
[1:50:41] if the people could only see this our
[1:50:43] judges our attorney the case is settled
[1:50:45] it's all over the same one as judge is
[1:50:48] the attorney is our attorney the case is
[1:50:49] settled we have the token both judge and
[1:50:52] journey that's the abstract both judge
[1:50:54] and journey is the same person when God
[1:50:57] was made flesh and dwelt among us our
[1:50:59] judge became our attorney and the case
[1:51:01] is settled and the Holy Ghost is here
[1:51:03] for a token that were ready to pass from
[1:51:06] here into the lands beyond amen bring us
[1:51:10] to I'm just down to 32 to 132 to save
[1:51:17] time you might say I believe it I
[1:51:18] believe it I believe it's the truth I
[1:51:20] accept it as the truth then that's all
[1:51:22] good but it has to be applied it has to
[1:51:26] be deployed just like in the first
[1:51:28] Exodus it goes on the doorpost it Sun
[1:51:30] display and we'll talk about that in a
[1:51:32] minute there's a good quote on the
[1:51:33] abstract getting to the end of the
[1:51:34] abstract here like the Pentecostal
[1:51:36] experience today and the coming of the
[1:51:39] Holy Ghost in the last days this promise
[1:51:40] is like the abstract to a title deed now
[1:51:46] you you can get a title Shore you can
[1:51:49] get a title to a place but that still
[1:51:52] don't say it's yours no sir somebody way
[1:51:55] back yonder could come in and put a
[1:51:57] claim on it like I said but when you get
[1:52:00] an abstract that shows that everything
[1:52:02] that's ever against it is struck off
[1:52:04] plumb back from the foundation right
[1:52:06] from the beginning it's all struck if
[1:52:08] it's abstract and when a man has said
[1:52:11] that he believes to word and then when
[1:52:13] the Holy Ghost comes
[1:52:14] it's the abstract to the title and that
[1:52:17] gives you permission when you have that
[1:52:19] abstract that every bit of that belongs
[1:52:22] to you and everything is on on it
[1:52:24] belongs to you and that gives us the
[1:52:27] abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:52:29] this title deed that God saw back yonder
[1:52:33] for the found
[1:52:33] of the world and put it name and put its
[1:52:37] name on the book of life but was born
[1:52:39] through a man and a woman and subject to
[1:52:41] sin and guilty of sin is the whole plan
[1:52:43] of God there but when he I believe
[1:52:45] believed on it I received the deed but
[1:52:48] then the Holy Ghost come
[1:52:49] it was the abstract so when he believed
[1:52:52] he said I believe you got a title you
[1:52:55] can call yourself Christian it's just
[1:52:57] like you would a Jew you'd be
[1:52:58] circumcised and you can be a Jew doesn't
[1:53:00] mean you got to you know your you got to
[1:53:02] covenant you know you still got to be
[1:53:04] under the Covenant and here it's saying
[1:53:07] you can believe and you got a title but
[1:53:08] you now you need the abstract title deed
[1:53:11] to go right back to the beginning and
[1:53:12] that's what the Holy Ghost brings it was
[1:53:14] the abstract that everything against me
[1:53:16] whether my mother done it my father done
[1:53:18] it my grandfather done it it doesn't
[1:53:20] matter so we see here so sober Bram says
[1:53:25] he says that numerous times in the token
[1:53:27] he says what does it got to be to be on
[1:53:28] display and he says the blood of Jesus
[1:53:31] Christ which is he says what does it
[1:53:33] mean that the token has to be on display
[1:53:35] in my life and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:53:37] which is in your soul has to be
[1:53:39] witnessed on the outside and your whole
[1:53:41] life is a testimony you're actually the
[1:53:44] scripture you get yourself under way he
[1:53:46] comes in and uses that vessel it's not
[1:53:48] you and him is just him the blood is
[1:53:51] applied and the blood is speaking you
[1:53:53] become a living Oracle they are the
[1:53:56] people that the Bible says that it might
[1:53:58] be fulfilled that was spoken by the
[1:54:00] prophets there will be a bride a
[1:54:02] spotless chastened virgin and she will
[1:54:04] be the very image of Almighty God and in
[1:54:07] this message he says there there will be
[1:54:10] a bride and she will be made the same
[1:54:12] thing and clothing the same thing that
[1:54:14] the one was at the beginning she is to
[1:54:16] be called so you don't it the the thing
[1:54:20] on display is that that blood living in
[1:54:24] you that life living in you the full
[1:54:26] life manifested getting to the end here
[1:54:29] I think we come to that spot we've come
[1:54:31] to Katie's Barnea when God has given the
[1:54:34] issue of the church to call a halt and
[1:54:36] back to prayer this is this is this is
[1:54:39] what he's saying now that the believers
[1:54:40] do these believers do who had that
[1:54:43] abstract title deed and and this church
[1:54:45] when God has given the issue
[1:54:47] for the church to call a halt and back
[1:54:49] to prayer life back to a consecration
[1:54:51] these are the ancient landmarks now he's
[1:54:54] laying right these are our ancient
[1:54:56] landmarks that we have to stay with he
[1:54:59] says the back to prayer life back to
[1:55:01] consecration
[1:55:02] back to a spot where we concentrate
[1:55:04] ourselves away from the things of the
[1:55:06] world and away from our little petty
[1:55:08] differences among us and go back to God
[1:55:11] and brotherly love and humility back to
[1:55:13] the power of God again we're just for
[1:55:15] sumin when we're running all right
[1:55:16] because God is blessing he was blessing
[1:55:19] Israel be probably the same day that
[1:55:22] they refused to go up there to the
[1:55:23] promised land talking about kgs Barnea
[1:55:25] and he said that day when they refused
[1:55:27] to go to promised land nice it's the
[1:55:29] same day that they they disbelieved
[1:55:31] despise the manna fell just the same
[1:55:34] that night but they were all together
[1:55:36] out of the will of God he's preaching
[1:55:38] presuming right he's saying don't
[1:55:40] presume because you might be getting the
[1:55:41] blessings of God here and that's what
[1:55:43] Pentecost is probably they think they're
[1:55:44] getting the blessings of God but they're
[1:55:46] right out of the will of God but God
[1:55:48] still goes with the blessing and in the
[1:55:50] in the case of Katies Bernier they were
[1:55:51] still getting the manna fall that same
[1:55:53] day that they refused to go into the
[1:55:55] promised land
[1:55:55] the man who was still fallen right they
[1:55:58] could not win another battle until they
[1:56:00] come back and made things right with God
[1:56:02] so it has to be the word on the word you
[1:56:04] know it's not the blessings it's a word
[1:56:06] because when God gets who God gives doc
[1:56:09] the gifts to the Holy Ghost of Pentecost
[1:56:10] he never takes him away he never took
[1:56:12] justification away from the from the
[1:56:14] Lutheran's they never took
[1:56:15] sanctification away from the Methodists
[1:56:17] they still have it you know if you want
[1:56:18] to partake of it you can it's still
[1:56:20] there
[1:56:20] you're still but God moves on right
[1:56:25] there's no one gonna be born again if
[1:56:27] there's more revealed in another age so
[1:56:30] when the word is revealed Pentecost not
[1:56:31] going to receive the Holy Ghost it's not
[1:56:33] going to happen
[1:56:33] it won't happen because they need to
[1:56:35] move on to the next next thing that work
[1:56:38] where the light is first John first John
[1:56:41] 1:7 you know we'll walk in the light as
[1:56:43] he is in the light you know do you have
[1:56:46] to be in that light in order to receive
[1:56:48] the fellowship with God right that's it
[1:56:50] right through all the angels and okay
[1:56:55] whoa where'd that come from
[1:57:00] so I guess that's the end of it what I
[1:57:02] got here I don't follow notes real good
[1:57:06] you know that right so so there we are
[1:57:12] it's just it I've touched on a bunch of
[1:57:15] things there going through the the
[1:57:17] Exodus - when Exodus three and there's a
[1:57:20] lot of detail around that but I just
[1:57:21] wanted to give it kind of a high high
[1:57:24] because I was I I was kind of taken
[1:57:27] there with the abstract and the title
[1:57:29] deed and what was required in this age
[1:57:32] but mostly what was to us different you
[1:57:34] know in Luther's days in Wesley's day
[1:57:36] when they say they they had the Holy
[1:57:38] Ghost but they didn't have to token you
[1:57:40] don't forget it as what was given in
[1:57:43] this day and try to help us understand
[1:57:46] that a little more that it is to give
[1:57:48] her it is to forward its Holy Ghost
[1:57:50] because he is the word he was main
[1:57:52] question that the Word was with God the
[1:57:54] Word was God and and the word became
[1:57:57] flesh so he is the word you know and the
[1:57:59] Holy Ghost is to work you know and then
[1:58:02] and then this age the abstract is the
[1:58:04] Holy Ghost and in this age we it brought
[1:58:07] what bur Brian talked about many times
[1:58:09] to see if forgetfulness and and and
[1:58:12] these these sins that have been in and
[1:58:17] go right back have all been put into the
[1:58:20] sea of forgetfulness and uh and lost
[1:58:22] forever he's talked about to die and it
[1:58:24] puts in a vat of job X and it just the
[1:58:28] camera is gone it's completely
[1:58:31] evaporated in that in that mixture and
[1:58:36] that's what's happened with us today and
[1:58:38] that all happened in revelation 5 that
[1:58:40] all happened in 63 when you know when
[1:58:43] Jesus came on the scene again came out
[1:58:45] of eternity and went and took that book
[1:58:48] and started to call his bride then at
[1:58:51] that time right and and not that the
[1:58:54] names were on the book but you know they
[1:58:57] would recognize they were underneath
[1:58:58] that and they could recognize the word
[1:59:01] for their for their day and not an under
[1:59:03] day but this day so why did you come to
[1:59:05] it you know you wonder why back then and
[1:59:08] you know it's being revealed more and
[1:59:10] more as we go on that is all god and it
[1:59:15] certainly gives you an assurance an
[1:59:16] arrest you know that you know he's he's
[1:59:20] here to bring us you know into a rapture
[1:59:23] and his the ones that are bit he'll not
[1:59:26] you know not forsake one there would be
[1:59:28] there not be one that won't be there in
[1:59:30] that age and and thank God for that
[1:59:34] amen let's stand and musicians can come
[1:59:38] on and we'll switch this over
[2:00:05] it's just
[2:00:11] number 378 Jesus paid at all I think we
