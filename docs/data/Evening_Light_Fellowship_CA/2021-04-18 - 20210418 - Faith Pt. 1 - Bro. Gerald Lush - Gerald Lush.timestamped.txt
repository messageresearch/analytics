[42:26] the faith to recognize what he's done
[42:28] and what he's doing and what he will do
[42:30] amen that keeps us pressing on
[42:33] with the faith amen the faith that
[42:36] pleases god
[42:37] amen not the faith that pleases you when
[42:40] you're in your head
[42:41] amen not faith of pleasing your neighbor
[42:43] or others in the church is the faith
[42:45] that pleases god
[42:46] amen and that's what god's looking for
[42:49] the faith
[42:50] amen he's got a yet there was a faith in
[42:52] every age and
[42:53] he was looking for those that believed
[42:55] what he would reveal in that age
[42:57] praise the name of the lord so brother i
[42:59] trust that
[43:00] we reveal what he did what we believe
[43:03] what he did reveal
[43:04] and we believe what he is revealing amen
[43:07] you're taking you're going on
[43:08] one step at a time it's not just say oh
[43:10] god told me this or you're going to stay
[43:12] there no
[43:13] that's just another step forward amen
[43:16] and of course the church ages is a
[43:18] testimony of what god has done
[43:20] and god revealed it here reveal it there
[43:22] amen just think faith
[43:23] praise the lord and brother sister where
[43:27] he began that's where he's going to end
[43:29] amen amen brother he started with faith
[43:32] now he's going to look for that faith
[43:34] amen in your heart and mind and that's
[43:37] what i want to
[43:38] eventually measure minister on this
[43:40] afternoon or this morning
[43:41] amen is faith exactly the faith that
[43:45] pleases god
[43:46] faith in the scriptures and and i want
[43:49] to show you
[43:50] the emphasis that god puts on faith
[43:53] to the extent that god said without
[43:56] faith
[43:56] it is impossible to please him amen you
[43:59] got to have faith and brother we got to
[44:01] have the right kind of faith
[44:02] amen not in your head got to be in your
[44:05] heart
[44:05] amen sure why because in your heart it's
[44:08] a testimony
[44:09] that that faith controls you amen from
[44:12] the heart
[44:13] if you've got it in your head like the
[44:14] problem of god said you couldn't have
[44:15] you could have
[44:16] the holy ghost he said in your flesh he
[44:18] said he said 24 hours a day
[44:20] and he said and go to hell amen because
[44:23] it's not
[44:24] in the soul amen what god is looking for
[44:26] when it comes to
[44:27] faith he wants not the faith of your
[44:29] mouth he's looking for the faith out of
[44:31] your heart
[44:32] amen the faith not that controls what
[44:34] you're saying it controls what you're
[44:36] doing
[44:36] amen it is the faith that controls your
[44:39] lived everyday living
[44:40] amen because we're walking by faith
[44:43] living by faith
[44:44] it is faith that controls us thought
[44:47] word and deed
[44:48] amen all based on faith it's all based
[44:52] on the revelation of the will of god
[44:54] amen not all mine and as i ministered on
[44:58] it and i said yeah now the bride's going
[44:59] to come to that place that jesus came
[45:01] when he when he bowed in prayer and he
[45:04] said not my will father thine be done
[45:06] amen even though there came an angel to
[45:09] minister to him an angel to it to
[45:10] encourage an
[45:11] angel to strengthen that physical being
[45:13] amen but yet
[45:15] he said not my will thine be done so
[45:18] brother goddess god is going to allow us
[45:20] to stay
[45:21] just as long amen on television bring
[45:24] out that that confession
[45:25] you bring up that testimony oh lord i
[45:28] believe what you did but
[45:29] lord not what i will what you will amen
[45:33] oh brother it's coming down to that
[45:34] because that's the only ones that are
[45:35] going in a rapture
[45:37] are those who have surrendered and yield
[45:38] to the will of god
[45:40] amen not my will thine be done
[45:43] and jesus laid down his life and picked
[45:46] it up again
[45:47] he endured what man did to him and
[45:49] brother is the seed of god in this hour
[45:51] we endure
[45:52] by the grace of god amen oh yeah we're
[45:55] in the door because the enemy's going to
[45:56] be there
[45:57] so deceitful oh yeah to make you believe
[46:00] you're in the will of god because you
[46:01] believe the message and as i said
[46:03] you know the devil believes the message
[46:05] but look what he's doing
[46:07] but again as i said also i said look at
[46:09] the faith
[46:10] that the message gave william bran or
[46:13] not brother brown but
[46:14] but the devil oh yeah he's come down
[46:16] with great
[46:17] wrath knowing his time is short
[46:21] well how do you know his time is short
[46:23] by by what god's doing
[46:24] amen he knew what god started with he
[46:27] knew what god was doing through the ages
[46:28] and then he knew what god was doing in
[46:30] the last stage amen
[46:32] to make an end of all things and he
[46:34] knows his time is short
[46:36] and that's why we're seeing so much
[46:37] unbelief and we're seeing so much of the
[46:40] devil's works
[46:41] amen more people are more cut out with
[46:43] their flesh
[46:44] and less and less with their soul amen
[46:47] and we'll show you that scripture again
[46:48] in just a moment
[46:50] brother where jesus indicates
[46:53] the kind of faith that will be here at
[46:54] the end of the age
[46:56] amen oh it's tremendous the emphasis and
[46:58] i want to share those scriptures with
[46:59] you
[47:00] the emphasis that the bible is putting
[47:02] on faith
[47:03] the emphasis that the seed of god put on
[47:05] faith
[47:06] amen not and again brother sister is not
[47:09] just a knowledge in your head
[47:11] it's what's in your heart amen god's not
[47:14] looking for faith in your head
[47:15] or in your flesh he's looking for faith
[47:17] in your heart amen
[47:19] why because if it's in your heart it
[47:21] controls you
[47:22] oh yeah it's in your heart it controls
[47:24] your everyday living
[47:26] brother you walk with him you talk with
[47:28] him your every thought your thinking
[47:30] is is the influence of christ in us it
[47:33] is our faith
[47:34] on the inside of the inside by the grace
[47:36] of god
[47:37] amen so i trust by the grace of god god
[47:40] help us to have
[47:41] faith in our hearts not knowledge in our
[47:44] heads but faith in our hearts
[47:46] and we know that faith is a revelation
[47:49] amen it is
[47:50] but many of them got many many even
[47:52] believers around the message
[47:53] they got it in their heads they got it
[47:55] in their flesh and maybe even in their
[47:57] spirits but it's not in their heart
[47:59] amen if it's in your heart it's going to
[48:01] control you
[48:02] thought word and deed no matter what you
[48:05] do
[48:06] if it's in control in your heart
[48:07] whatever you do it's going to be the
[48:09] will of god

[48:12] heart is not going to
[48:14] lead you to do this lead you to do that
[48:15] lead you to say this say that

[48:20] heart brother it keeps your focus

[48:36] that we have
[48:37] true holy ghost faith amen

[48:43] warning

[49:10] revelation of the word

[49:14] that but still not have faith

[49:33] flesh

[59:27] oh his own with sick jensen okay we pray
[59:30] the grace of god to him amen
[59:32] to give us the faith we need turn with
[59:35] me to luke chapter 18.
[59:39] i want to share with you some scripture
[59:41] we may be able to get to some quotes
[59:43] here but
[59:45] if not this this morning or this
[59:46] afternoon i want to share with you the
[59:48] scriptures
[59:49] we're in that the lord is putting the
[59:51] emphasis on
[59:52] faith amen i pray the grace of god that
[59:55] we're putting the emphasis on faith
[59:57] and we can narrow it down narrow it down
[59:59] to this message that message this
[1:00:01] doctrine that doctrine
[1:00:02] and that's basically all it becomes but
[1:00:04] not faith oh i see this and i see this
[1:00:07] and i believe this and i believe that
[1:00:09] but faith cometh by hearing the word
[1:00:12] amen it's giving us the faith to believe
[1:00:14] god giving us the faith to claim the
[1:00:16] promise of god
[1:00:17] amen giving us the faith to get into the
[1:00:19] will of god amen not my will let him be
[1:00:22] done
[1:00:23] but i tell you jesus did it but there's
[1:00:24] not many believers going to say that
[1:00:26] because why because more often than not
[1:00:29] that the will of god for them
[1:00:30] is going to be contrary to what they
[1:00:32] want oh yeah but again if you're a seed
[1:00:34] of god you don't care what god wants you
[1:00:36] to do
[1:00:36] where how and when he wants you to do it
[1:00:38] you're going to do it
[1:00:39] amen you're not even a question because
[1:00:41] it's god in you so lord i follow your
[1:00:43] leadership
[1:00:44] amen by the grace of god amen
[1:00:47] so in luke chapter 18
[1:00:50] and beginning to read at verse 1
[1:00:54] and e jesus spake a parable unto them to
[1:00:58] this
[1:00:59] end that men ought always to pray
[1:01:03] and not to faint amen
[1:01:07] so the grace of god that we'll pray but
[1:01:09] not faint
[1:01:10] amen saying there was
[1:01:13] in a city a judge
[1:01:16] which feared not god neither regarded
[1:01:20] man
[1:01:21] and there was a widow in that city and
[1:01:24] she came unto him
[1:01:25] saying avenge me of mine adversary
[1:01:30] and he would not for a while
[1:01:33] but afterward he said within himself
[1:01:36] though i
[1:01:36] fear not god and as the prophet said god
[1:01:40] doesn't fear himself
[1:01:42] amen and this is god in control
[1:01:46] so he said although i fear not god nor
[1:01:48] regard
[1:01:49] man amen and it says yet
[1:01:52] because this widow troubled me
[1:01:55] i will avenge her lest by her continual
[1:01:59] coming
[1:01:59] she wearing me are we going to
[1:02:02] continually come to the lord as much as
[1:02:03] she came to him
[1:02:05] amen oh yeah you you've got it
[1:02:08] if you want it you'll call for it by the
[1:02:11] grace of god
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:16] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[1:02:18] judge
[1:02:19] said and shall not god avenge his
[1:02:22] own elect amen which cry
[1:02:25] day and night unto him amen
[1:02:29] and praise the lord if we've got a
[1:02:30] relationship with god we're in communion
[1:02:32] with god
[1:02:33] amen we consult the lord by the grace of
[1:02:36] god
[1:02:37] when you walk you're thinking his
[1:02:38] thoughts amen
[1:02:40] when you talk you're going to express
[1:02:41] his thoughts praise the lord
[1:02:43] because it's not you it's christ in you
[1:02:45] amen
[1:02:46] praise the lord and he said avenge is
[1:02:49] the only lack
[1:02:51] which cry day and night unto him though
[1:02:53] he bear
[1:02:54] long with them amen thank god for that
[1:02:57] grace
[1:02:59] and i tell you that he will avenge them
[1:03:01] speedily
[1:03:02] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:03:06] shall he find faith on the earth
[1:03:10] god bless his word you may be seated
[1:03:16] the thing that pleases god is what he's
[1:03:18] looking for
[1:03:19] and it is faith but
[1:03:22] he's indicating the unbelief of the of
[1:03:25] the
[1:03:25] last days to the extent that he said
[1:03:29] when the son of man
[1:03:30] comes will he find faith well brother
[1:03:33] sister is he finding faith in us
[1:03:36] and i'm not referring just to the letter
[1:03:38] of the word the letter of a message that
[1:03:39] god
[1:03:40] spoke by the prophet no but do we have
[1:03:43] the revelation of it in our hearts
[1:03:45] is it in control of us not in control of
[1:03:48] our heads not in control of our thoughts
[1:03:50] not in control of our arguments no no
[1:03:52] it's in control of our lives
[1:03:54] so again the truth is that it's not me
[1:03:57] it's not you that lives
[1:03:58] it is christ the word living in us amen
[1:04:02] is not you in control and you're
[1:04:03] following your feelings no no
[1:04:05] and you're following maybe your spirit
[1:04:08] no no it's following the leadership of
[1:04:10] the holy ghost
[1:04:11] christ in us amen because in our flesh
[1:04:14] we're going to do one thing
[1:04:16] in our flesh we all i feel to do this i
[1:04:18] feel to go here feel it
[1:04:19] go there but you know what is the
[1:04:21] leadership of god in your heart
[1:04:23] amen it's not what you want to do it's
[1:04:25] what god wants to do
[1:04:26] in you is what god wants to do through
[1:04:29] your life
[1:04:30] amen there's too many today whether it's
[1:04:33] out there in denominations whether it's
[1:04:35] around the
[1:04:36] message there are too many just doing
[1:04:37] their own thing what they want to do
[1:04:39] where they want to do it how they want
[1:04:40] to do it and when they want to do it
[1:04:42] but they're not really seriously
[1:04:44] considering the will of god
[1:04:46] amen is this the will of god by the
[1:04:49] grace of god
[1:04:50] and it takes again that anointing within
[1:04:53] yes with our brother
[1:04:54] ellsworth and sister elder there to
[1:04:56] believe that
[1:04:57] that god allowed all this to happen to
[1:04:59] bring us to this place
[1:05:01] just think of that amen god allowed this
[1:05:04] to happen in our brother's life in our
[1:05:05] sister's life
[1:05:06] amen to bring them into this place of
[1:05:09] fellowship with the saints
[1:05:10] amen by the grace of almighty god amen
[1:05:14] is what god permitted and what god
[1:05:16] allowed and god predestinated
[1:05:17] even concerning our brother visual that
[1:05:20] may oh well
[1:05:21] he just left india and he come into
[1:05:23] canada and he come into newfoundland
[1:05:25] to take a university course and so on
[1:05:29] yeah but was that his decision or was it
[1:05:32] god's decision
[1:05:33] amen was that is his choice and a
[1:05:36] conviction within his own mind
[1:05:38] i'd like to do this i'd like to do that
[1:05:39] i want to do this i want to do well was
[1:05:41] it
[1:05:41] god in him hungry and thirsting for it
[1:05:44] was god
[1:05:45] in him convicting him to do this
[1:05:46] convicting him to do that amen
[1:05:48] again as i look back in my own life and
[1:05:51] i see
[1:05:52] i see this and i see this and i see that
[1:05:54] oh my
[1:05:55] the the number of things that i've done
[1:05:57] in my life when it comes to our work
[1:05:59] there worked there
[1:06:00] did this did that and so on i said oh my
[1:06:03] i said it i must be the lord you know
[1:06:05] even as i worked in a department store
[1:06:08] and one of the managers i was just stood
[1:06:10] there
[1:06:11] at a certain counter and one of the
[1:06:13] managers came over and says
[1:06:15] excuse me excuse me yes he said
[1:06:18] do you preach and uh well i said yes
[1:06:22] sometimes i preach
[1:06:23] always i just want to know i thought
[1:06:25] there's something different here
[1:06:27] amen and yet at the same time they're
[1:06:29] depending on me to do this and do that
[1:06:31] amen for their business and only that
[1:06:33] they would they would depend on me to to
[1:06:35] gather the employees together
[1:06:37] and exhort them as to what they should
[1:06:39] do and how they should do it and and so
[1:06:41] on
[1:06:42] and oh yes they say we want you to do it
[1:06:44] come on
[1:06:45] you could you to explain it just get
[1:06:46] them together in there in that room
[1:06:48] amen and tell them what to do and how to
[1:06:50] do it because when i when i started that
[1:06:53] business
[1:06:53] i i did i didn't start as as part of
[1:06:55] management
[1:06:56] but i ended up as part management i

[1:07:02] higher and higher i was doing
[1:07:04] the will of god amen for the glory of
[1:07:07] god amen
[1:07:08] no matter where i was no matter what job
[1:07:10] it was and
[1:07:11] those that i were associated with i
[1:07:13] wasn't ashamed
[1:07:14] of the testimony i wasn't ashamed of
[1:07:17] what god had done for me
[1:07:19] amen and the witness that he wanted me
[1:07:21] to give them
[1:07:22] amen as i told you one time before and
[1:07:25] and then
[1:07:26] they the certain customer came in and
[1:07:28] they wanted to know this and know this
[1:07:30] and i said one minute i'll find out

[1:07:51] and so and that's exactly what he did he
[1:07:53] went and told her
[1:07:55] but i didn't and they knew that and
[1:07:57] again as i said there was issues there

[1:31:14] word but they don't have the dynamics
[1:31:17] brother without the dynamics we can't go
[1:31:19] in the rapture
[1:31:21] without the dynamics we won't be changed
[1:31:24] god's grace to us
[1:31:25] amen that we got the mechanics
[1:31:29] and the dynamics god's grace that the
[1:31:31] mechanics is in control
[1:31:33] or the dynamics is in control amen
[1:31:36] oh the word the message listen i'll tell
[1:31:39] you if any god wants you to do more than
[1:31:41] anything else
[1:31:41] he wants you to live the word more than
[1:31:44] talk it
[1:31:45] walk the talk sons and daughters of god
[1:31:48] are led by the spirit of god and they
[1:31:49] walk in the spirit

[1:32:10] grace amen
[1:32:14] so by faith the elders obtained a good
[1:32:16] report and through faith

[1:32:20] framed by the word of god
[1:32:22] so that things which are seen do not are
[1:32:24] not we're not made of things which do
[1:32:26] appear

[1:35:20] but what god wants is your you you want
[1:35:22] the altar
[1:35:23] amen praise the lord amen
[1:35:28] so brother not only that because of what
[1:35:30] abel offered
[1:35:31] he was righteous amen god saw
[1:35:34] righteousness
[1:35:35] and brother how righteous are you yeah
[1:35:39] well it's dependent on on on your faith
[1:35:43] right does god see your righteousness by
[1:35:45] faith you believe this you believe that
[1:35:47] you and
[1:35:48] and you're not just believing it by and
[1:35:50] saying oh yeah i believe it or i believe
[1:35:51] it yeah
[1:35:52] well go show me don't tell me show me
[1:35:55] amen by the grace of god and by faith
[1:35:59] enoch was translated
[1:36:01] praise the lord that he should not see
[1:36:04] death
[1:36:05] and was not found because god had
[1:36:07] translated him
[1:36:08] for before his translation he had this
[1:36:12] testimony that he pleased god
[1:36:15] with what faith he believed
[1:36:19] amen what god revealed he believed
[1:36:22] well god revealed he kept and fed on
[1:36:25] amen praise the lord
[1:36:29] so he said why verse six he said without
[1:36:32] faith
[1:36:32] it is impossible to please him
[1:36:36] i don't care what you do brother if
[1:36:38] you're not going by faith
[1:36:39] you don't please god you can do this you
[1:36:42] can do this you can do that
[1:36:44] but is it faith or is you you're just
[1:36:47] just your nature good nature no if it's
[1:36:50] a holy ghost nature
[1:36:52] it's going to be faith god did him with
[1:36:54] you god leading you
[1:36:56] sons and daughters of god led by the
[1:36:57] spirit of god amen
[1:36:59] and it's by faith amen
[1:37:02] so that amen you're not going to do what
[1:37:04] you want to do you're going to do what
[1:37:05] god wants you to do
[1:37:08] amen but there's 2 million too many
[1:37:10] today so-called believers
[1:37:11] they're just doing what they want to do
[1:37:13] and they think oh god thank you for the
[1:37:15] message
[1:37:16] yeah thank god for the message the lord
[1:37:19] the lord will appreciate it
[1:37:20] if you're going to surrender to it don't
[1:37:23] appreciate it if you're going to
[1:37:24] let the message control you amen
[1:37:27] so there's not you that lives as christ
[1:37:29] the word living in you
[1:37:32] so he said without faith it is
[1:37:34] impossible to please him
[1:37:36] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:37:38] that he is
[1:37:40] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:37:43] diligently seek him
[1:37:44] not just seek him but you seek him
[1:37:46] diligently
[1:37:48] amen god of us to pay attention to the
[1:37:50] word
[1:37:51] amen god help us to bring ourselves in
[1:37:54] line with the word
[1:37:55] amen because god is going to judge you
[1:37:58] by the word
[1:37:59] amen brother so are we diligently
[1:38:02] seeking him amen
[1:38:06] and do we have the faith that pleases
[1:38:08] him
[1:38:10] god have mercy on us i believe that
[1:38:12] gentleman of that anakin church that
[1:38:14] time
[1:38:15] a few years ago he had the faith that
[1:38:17] pleased god
[1:38:18] amen again because this is this is where
[1:38:21] god was dealing with him down there
[1:38:23] this is where god's dealing with
[1:38:24] somebody else up here and you and me
[1:38:26] further up oh i said thank you jesus
[1:38:28] for that revelation amen
[1:38:31] so brother grace that we have the faith
[1:38:34] that pleases god
[1:38:36] amen for he that cometh to god
[1:38:39] must believe that he is amen
[1:38:42] not he was and will be he is present
[1:38:46] tense
[1:38:47] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:38:50] diligently
[1:38:52] how many of us here are diligent in our
[1:38:54] faith
[1:38:57] most believers are not they started out
[1:39:00] diligent
[1:39:01] oh yes definitely years ago but then
[1:39:04] there's fewer and fewer and fewer who
[1:39:05] are really diligent
[1:39:07] they're really caught up with the word
[1:39:09] and lord i want more of your word i want
[1:39:11] more of the faith for the resurrection
[1:39:13] rapture
[1:39:14] lord i pray in the name of jesus don't
[1:39:15] let it become too common to me

[1:40:42] what it is leave it the way that it is
[1:40:44] amen and yet there are those out there
[1:40:47] and breathing is under a false anointing
[1:40:49] they are making the message bigger than
[1:40:51] what it is or they're making it smaller
[1:40:52] than what it is
[1:40:54] but god wants those that are just
[1:40:55] leaving it the way that it is and walk
[1:40:57] in the light

[1:41:35] challenge to us
[1:41:36] amen so in acts 15
[1:41:41] and certain men which came down from
[1:41:43] judea
[1:41:44] taught the brethren and said except ye
[1:41:47] be circumcised after the manner of moses
[1:41:49] you cannot be saved when therefore paul
[1:41:53] and barnabas add so small dissension
[1:41:57] and disputation with them they
[1:41:59] determined that paul and barnabas
[1:42:01] and certain other of them should go up
[1:42:03] to jerusalem
[1:42:04] under the apostles and elders about this
[1:42:07] question
[1:42:08] and being brought on their way by the
[1:42:10] church
[1:42:11] they passed through phineas and samaria
[1:42:15] declaring the conversation of of the
[1:42:18] gentiles
[1:42:19] and they caused great joy unto all the
[1:42:22] brethren
[1:42:23] when and when they were come to
[1:42:25] jerusalem
[1:42:26] they were received of the church and of
[1:42:29] the apostles
[1:42:30] and elders and they declared all things
[1:42:33] that god had done with them amen giving
[1:42:37] god the premise in their lives
[1:42:39] oh how many are really living for god
[1:42:42] how many really want to give god the
[1:42:44] glory how many really want to testify to
[1:42:47] what he's done for you today
[1:42:49] what he did for you yesterday and what
[1:42:52] you believe he's going to do tomorrow
[1:42:54] yeah giving god preeminence amen
[1:42:58] not just he's a thought he's a good
[1:43:00] thought and oh
[1:43:01] god did this i believe this and i
[1:43:02] believe that no
[1:43:05] he's your lord he's your savior amen
[1:43:09] is your fellowship
[1:43:13] and it says and when they were come to
[1:43:14] jerusalem they were received of the
[1:43:16] church
[1:43:17] and of the apostles and elders and they
[1:43:20] declared all things that god had done
[1:43:22] done unto them well if you did it what
[1:43:25] are you going to say
[1:43:26] god did to you what's your testimony
[1:43:31] what has god done for you today what did
[1:43:33] he do for you yesterday
[1:43:35] do you have any proof that he's with you
[1:43:37] and he's in you and he was leading you
[1:43:41] grace but there rose up certain of the
[1:43:45] sect of the pharisees which believed
[1:43:47] saying that it was needful to circumcise
[1:43:50] them
[1:43:50] and to command them to keep the law of
[1:43:53] moses
[1:43:54] and the apostles and elders came
[1:43:55] together for to consider
[1:43:57] of this matter and when there had been
[1:44:00] much disputing
[1:44:01] peter rose up and said unto them men and
[1:44:04] brethren
[1:44:06] ye know that a good while ago
[1:44:09] god made choice among us that the
[1:44:11] gentiles by my mouth should hear the
[1:44:13] word of the gospel and believe
[1:44:16] and god which knoweth the hearts bear
[1:44:19] them witness
[1:44:20] giving them the holy ghost even as he
[1:44:23] did unto us
[1:44:25] amen and put no difference between us
[1:44:28] and them or the jew or the gentile there
[1:44:31] was no difference
[1:44:33] he said purifying their hearts by faith
[1:44:36] amen for the jew they felt it was
[1:44:39] circumcision
[1:44:40] but brother it was for the jew faith
[1:44:44] what he was looking for this is what god
[1:44:46] wanted in the jews
[1:44:47] oh they said well we did this we did
[1:44:49] that yeah we can go and say we did this
[1:44:51] we did that
[1:44:52] but what god's looking for in you is his
[1:44:54] faith
[1:44:55] do you have faith real genuine holy
[1:44:58] ghost faith
[1:45:00] amen controlling your thoughts your
[1:45:02] words your deeds
[1:45:03] and he's your leader you do nothing
[1:45:06] without consulting the lord
[1:45:08] in all thy ways acknowledge him amen
[1:45:12] by the grace of god but yet there's too
[1:45:15] many believers they're still doing their
[1:45:16] own thing
[1:45:17] and saying we believe the message we
[1:45:18] believe that but brother outside the
[1:45:20] church and
[1:45:21] just when they're when they're going to
[1:45:23] say this and say that
[1:45:24] oh yeah but then when it comes to the
[1:45:27] rest of their days and the rest of their
[1:45:28] weeks or
[1:45:29] months or years they're going to do what
[1:45:30] they want to do not what god wants them
[1:45:32] to do
[1:45:34] god help us it's a challenge a challenge
[1:45:37] a challenge to our faith
[1:45:40] brother do we have the faith that
[1:45:42] pleases god
[1:45:45] you can have faith that pleases your
[1:45:47] your preacher you're gonna have faith
[1:45:48] that pleases you
[1:45:49] your wife you're gonna have faith that
[1:45:51] pleases your husband oh yeah
[1:45:53] mom and dad oh yeah that's my faith
[1:45:56] but does it please god
[1:46:00] amen how many are really stopping to
[1:46:03] consider their faith
[1:46:04] lord does this please you am i in your
[1:46:06] will
[1:46:08] please lord grace of god
[1:46:11] again it's like the story i told you
[1:46:12] about sister burns
[1:46:14] that she was washing the clothes that
[1:46:16] time and and for two hours i believe it
[1:46:18] was the devil that talked to her
[1:46:20] the devil was discouraging her
[1:46:23] and one of the reasons might have been
[1:46:25] because she spent so many hours
[1:46:27] in her house alone that was when brother
[1:46:29] barnes was working
[1:46:30] still working and my brother sister
[1:46:34] her the doors were locked when she went
[1:46:36] to bed they were
[1:46:37] they're locked when she got up they were
[1:46:39] locked through the day locked when she
[1:46:40] went to bed again
[1:46:42] oh yeah because nobody came to visit her
[1:46:47] yeah amazing but then
[1:46:51] amen the devil went down downtown
[1:46:54] until amen like the problem of gods that
[1:46:56] didn't struck you struck his heart
[1:46:58] and her and her heart and her faith she
[1:47:01] said get the behind me satan
[1:47:03] amen and she said the atmosphere went
[1:47:06] from dark to light
[1:47:08] amen praise the lord amen
[1:47:13] verse 8 says and god which knoweth the
[1:47:15] hearts bear them witness
[1:47:17] giving them the holy ghost even as he
[1:47:19] did unto us
[1:47:20] and put no difference between us and
[1:47:23] them
[1:47:24] purifying their hearts by faith
[1:47:27] brother not a physical circumcision but
[1:47:29] spiritual
[1:47:30] in our hearts amen grace of god
[1:47:37] then go to first corinthians
[1:47:40] chapter 16.

[1:47:46] scriptures and then we'll
[1:47:48] move on to another service first
[1:47:51] corinthians chapter
[1:47:53] 16.

[1:48:12] separated from this separate from that

[1:48:15] at the altar and that other believer
[1:48:18] next to me was praying and thanking god
[1:48:20] for deliverance out of denominations
[1:48:22] and she said now she said we don't have
[1:48:24] to be subject to any man
[1:48:26] i said lord she needs a revelation i so
[1:48:29] i pray lord that you'll deal with her
[1:48:31] in her heart because she felt that that
[1:48:33] was to her that was the uh that was the
[1:48:36] oh the blessing of coming out of a
[1:48:38] church i don't have to submit to this
[1:48:39] one but yet
[1:48:41] yet in questions and answers i said i'm

[1:49:29] if you've got the holy ghost and you've
[1:49:30] got a holy lord's faith you're going to
[1:49:31] be more subject
[1:49:33] oh you're going to be you're going to be
[1:49:34] there to surrender by the grace of god

[1:57:55] oh yeah lord as long as you're in our
[1:57:57] lives and you're doing this everything
[1:57:58] is going good
[1:57:59] that's good lord i i believe you but
[1:58:02] then maybe sometimes god lets things get
[1:58:04] rough
[1:58:05] you know like the waters that peter
[1:58:06] stood on sometimes the waters of our
[1:58:09] life would get rough
[1:58:10] sure are we gonna are we gonna still
[1:58:12] leave it with god and keep walking
[1:58:15] amen praise the lord wonderful
[1:58:18] i pray the lord help us amen no matter
[1:58:21] how rough it gets
[1:58:22] that we're going to still believe him
[1:58:24] we're going to still trust him
[1:58:25] amen in all thy ways acknowledge him
[1:58:29] by the grace of god hallelujah
[1:58:32] amen he said he was scared
[1:58:36] oh he thought it was a ghost he said and
[1:58:38] he said lord if it be you
[1:58:39] bid me to come on to you on the water
[1:58:42] and say come on
[1:58:44] and that's just the same as james 5 14
[1:58:46] the same as mark 16.
[1:58:48] it's the same god that said it come on
[1:58:51] and so he started walking and he done
[1:58:53] all right and got
[1:58:55] down out of the ship and started walking
[1:58:58] but
[1:58:59] when he got his eyes on the waves he got
[1:59:01] scared
[1:59:02] and he said what come in his mind first
[1:59:04] thing i'm going to walk because the word
[1:59:06] said for me to walk
[1:59:08] and the next thing he said well he look
[1:59:10] at his
[1:59:11] symptoms yeah but you don't look at your
[1:59:14] symptoms
[1:59:14] stay with the promise yeah
[1:59:17] stay with the promise amen
[1:59:21] praise the lord when he believed he
[1:59:24] could walk
[1:59:25] and he walked but god but he rather he
[1:59:28] got scared in his belief
[1:59:31] then his substance left him see
[1:59:34] that's right amen and he still professed
[1:59:38] his faith
[1:59:39] but he didn't have the substance amen
[1:59:42] whereas paul was saying that faith is
[1:59:44] the substance of things over
[1:59:45] and the evidence of things not seen
[1:59:48] praise the lord
[1:59:49] amen the substance would have went all
[1:59:52] right over the top of that white cap
[1:59:54] and went right on to him oh yeah he
[1:59:56] could if he didn't
[1:59:57] if he didn't worry about it well if he
[2:00:00] started
[2:00:01] he would finish this is amazing that he
[2:00:04] started
[2:00:05] and he walked on the water yeah and and
[2:00:08] he moved on toward jesus but then all of
[2:00:10] a sudden maybe
[2:00:11] he just saw maybe behind jesus or to the
[2:00:13] or to the right
[2:00:14] oh he saw this wave coming up coming up
[2:00:16] and he got scared
[2:00:17] but jesus wasn't scared jesus was still
[2:00:20] walking
[2:00:22] come on no
[2:00:25] he sunk and jesus said to take him by
[2:00:27] the hand lift them up
[2:00:29] amen to god be the glory amen
[2:00:33] brother if it is god's will just trust
[2:00:35] the lord and keep claiming the promise
[2:00:38] amen and pleading the blood of jesus
[2:00:41] amen
[2:00:43] oh my praise the lord he said the
[2:00:46] substance would have went right over the
[2:00:48] top of that weight cap
[2:00:49] and went right on to him see if he has
[2:00:52] the perfect faith
[2:00:54] but he didn't have it i pray and i'll
[2:00:57] tell you
[2:00:58] whether we need anything to go from time
[2:01:00] to eternity we need anything to get out
[2:01:02] of here
[2:01:03] and into the rapture it's perfect faith
[2:01:06] amen and brother god has the
[2:01:09] the revelation of the word in these days
[2:01:12] and the rev the opening of the word the
[2:01:13] opening of the seventh seals
[2:01:14] is to give us the perfect faith for the
[2:01:16] rapture yeah
[2:01:19] what god did brothers not just to say he
[2:01:21] did this he did this he did this
[2:01:23] he did it for a reason
[2:01:26] he did it for a reason that not because
[2:01:29] the bible says he's going to do it bible
[2:01:31] says he's going to do it why was he
[2:01:32] going to do it
[2:01:33] and why did he do it was to give us
[2:01:35] perfect faith
[2:01:37] for the rapture amen but how many are
[2:01:41] really
[2:01:41] really believing with that perfect faith
[2:01:46] god help us and they
[2:01:49] have really put their lives into the
[2:01:50] hands of god
[2:01:52] amen soul body and spirit lord it's all
[2:01:55] under your control
[2:01:56] not my will thine be done so we're going
[2:01:59] to come
[2:02:00] more and more to that position as time
[2:02:02] goes on and brother just think of the
[2:02:04] world we're living in now
[2:02:08] that our the whole world is controlled
[2:02:12] by covid19
[2:02:15] just think it's just not just not
[2:02:17] america it's just not canada
[2:02:19] just not the western world it's the
[2:02:20] whole world
[2:02:22] they're all governed by these rules by
[2:02:24] these regulations they're changing this
[2:02:26] changing that
[2:02:26] and i know things are getting even more
[2:02:28] strict and more strict in in ontario
[2:02:30] getting more strict in british columbia
[2:02:32] getting more and more strict
[2:02:34] yes in in quebec and and other parts and
[2:02:37] other places around the world
[2:02:39] yeah knowing that just think there's
[2:02:41] been so many you know thousands of
[2:02:43] people
[2:02:43] that have been fined an issue is issued
[2:02:46] this and they got to pay pay this to the
[2:02:48] government pay that to the government
[2:02:49] why
[2:02:50] because they didn't do what the
[2:02:51] government ordered them to do when they
[2:02:53] went from one country to another
[2:02:55] they didn't do what the government
[2:02:56] wanted to do when they came out of that
[2:02:58] country and into canada
[2:02:59] oh yeah and there are so many hundred
[2:03:01] and hundred and hundred
[2:03:02] and maybe thousands that are that are
[2:03:04] being sued
[2:03:06] for so many thousand dollars
[2:03:11] god have mercy i pray we're seeing the
[2:03:14] seriousness of it
[2:03:15] of the world in which we live what would
[2:03:17] grandmother and grandfather
[2:03:18] think if they came back to this world
[2:03:23] they would want to get out and get out
[2:03:25] of it again
[2:03:26] they would want to stay not by any means
[2:03:30] so i pray god i pray god that we're not
[2:03:32] going to take for granted
[2:03:33] and not going to take it lightly always
[2:03:35] just as just this it's just this
[2:03:37] brother there's more to it than just
[2:03:40] this the devil has come down with great
[2:03:43] wrath
[2:03:44] knowing his time is short it's serious
[2:03:48] i pray god will not take it for granted
[2:03:51] but
[2:03:52] when we see these things look up
[2:03:55] because your redemption draw at night
[2:03:58] amen oh yeah brother
[2:04:02] if you don't let god separate you from

[2:04:34] faith that trusts him faith that'll
[2:04:36] follow his leadership and his counsel
[2:04:40] but it's too many saying yeah i believe
