[15:58] It's good to be in church tonight. It's
[16:00] good to see all the faces here tonight
[16:02] and some our visitors. Really good to
[16:04] have you with
[16:05] us. Some prayer requests. Sister Laura
[16:08] Snow, I haven't sent an update in a
[16:10] while uh this week, but um I believe
[16:13] she's out of the woods. Um if you think
[16:15] of her, pray for her kidneys. That
[16:17] that's the one of the question marks now
[16:19] is just wanting to see them uh get back
[16:21] to normal. Um, also, you know, she's
[16:23] going through physio and there's
[16:25] different, you know, things like that
[16:26] now she has to face and we just want to
[16:28] keep her in prayer. But it's absolutely
[16:30] a miracle that she's alive. That's uh
[16:32] that's for sure. So, I believe that's
[16:34] because of the prayer. Um, again,
[16:36] brother Adam getting MRI results on the
[16:39] 23rd. We're believing for a good report.
[16:42] The Lord will just take away his
[16:44] symptoms that he's feeling. Um, brother
[16:46] Jeremiah and uh now brother Joshua both
[16:49] taking heart smacks to the head and uh
[16:51] want to keep them in prayer and maybe
[16:53] buy them some helmets. Brother
[16:56] um sister uh Becky we just continue to
[16:59] remember you in prayer and sister
[17:00] Cordella I was in touch with with her
[17:03] and uh she's going to try to be here
[17:04] tomorrow night and uh she did say she
[17:06] was having some uh some challenges with
[17:08] her health and and her energy and and
[17:10] different things. So my heart went out
[17:12] to her and just uh we just want to keep
[17:14] her in prayer. Again, Sister Katrina and
[17:16] Brother Nelson uh Church in Central, the
[17:19] saints there. Just want to remember all
[17:21] them again. Thankful to have him with
[17:23] us. Let's sing uh I'm going to ask

[20:44] this point of time you gave us to come
[20:45] in and gather around with you
[20:47] father to look upon you lord the two
[20:52] living fathers is the God of Abraham,
[20:53] Isaac, and Jacob. There's no beside you
[20:56] this morning.
[20:57] Father, we know in this hour, Father,
[21:00] you send our prophet William Brandham to
[21:03] open our hearts of understanding that we
[21:05] may walk bold to the truth in the hour
[21:07] which we live in, Lord. Because you're a
[21:09] great one, Father, and there's no
[21:11] Messiah.
[21:12] And Lord, we know Lord when
[21:14] you live on upon the earth, Father, you
[21:17] walked in flesh. And Father, you hope
[21:20] looked at blind eyes. The dead one was
[21:22] raised from the dead. Pleasure was
[21:24] father. Truly, Lord, the closer indeed.
[21:28] And this hour we live in, Lord. People
[21:31] are going the wrong ways. Don't get much
[21:34] care for you, much love for your father.
[21:36] But Lord, I'm so glad I can come in and
[21:40] bow my head before you, Father, with the
[21:42] brothers and sisters here, Father, that
[21:43] leaves your word and holds to it. And

[21:53] valley, the bright morning star, and
[21:55] there's no beside me. See, we are. I
[21:58] want to thank you, Father, for your
[21:59] blessings towards us. I'm not worthy,
[22:02] Lord, to stand me on your throne of
[22:03] poverty, Lord. But Lord, I stand because
[22:06] we're asking, Lord, we stand to open up
[22:09] your hearts, Father, that you open up
[22:11] our hearts of
[22:12] understanding. And we'll always walk
[22:14] upon your word, Father, in the close of
[22:16] the hour we live in. Lord, bless the
[22:19] servant, Father. We know, Lord, you
[22:21] really lay your life down. Shed your
[22:24] blood on Calvary, Father, to cover the
[22:26] sins on see never to remember
[22:29] again. Oh Lord, you're known beside me
[22:31] to see me. Father, I ask you Lord to
[22:34] bless each one bow in your presence or
[22:36] receiving. Father, that we may walk with
[22:38] you, one accord, one mind to the closing
[22:40] end of the ages upon us. And Father,
[22:43] we're looking for the resurrection and
[22:46] the chains and the mortal immortality.
[22:48] Father, oh your God, their norm, our
[22:51] father, I love you. I thank your grace
[22:54] to warn us. And father, keep
[22:57] us covering the shed blood of Jesus
[23:00] Christ into your son.
[23:01] Father, because in you, Lord, there's no
[23:04] one there. There there's no darkness
[23:05] whatsoever, Father. And we ought to
[23:08] learn to walk and stand in the truth in
[23:09] the hour which we live in, Lord, because
[23:12] you're you're our blessed savior and
[23:14] only disciple to see me, Lord. So,
[23:17] Father, I ask you once more to bless us
[23:19] about in your presence. Keep us one
[23:21] accord, one
[23:23] mind, Lord, that we always walk in the
[23:25] light of your word, according to your
[23:27] word, that you receive boldly on
[23:28] purpose. I leave all things in your
[23:31] hands now father and thank you for the
[23:33] day which you has given us. Bless each
[23:35] one father. I love each one. I stand for
[23:39] the truth lord as they do. I want to
[23:41] walk and hold to the truth. And father
[23:44] that you'll receive glory honor

[46:07] It's all because of you, Lord Jesus
[46:10] Christ.
[46:11] In all that I do, in all of my life, I
[46:16] will worship you. I'll honor you. I love
[46:21] you because you first love me.
[46:34] Now you're
[46:37] there in the splendor of your
[46:42] holyess. Hear this
[46:47] prayer. Father, grant my one request for
[46:52] this child.
[46:56] One day soon we'll see you face to face.
[47:00] Take and
[47:04] guide. Shower down your sweet, sweet
[47:08] grace. I spread my hands before your
[47:13] throne. I live my life for you alone as
[47:18] worship.
[47:22] as
[47:25] worship and you turn your ear to me.
[47:30] Draw near to me. Hold me when I am in
[47:34] need. And my lips will sing your praise.
[47:38] And my heart's been set ablaze. The
[47:40] glory of your face will I see.
[47:45] It's all because of you, Lord Jesus
[47:48] Christ. In all that I do in all of my
[47:53] life, I will worship you. I'll honor
[47:57] you. I love you because you first
[48:03] loved me.
[48:07] [Music]
[48:24] And you turn your ear to me. Draw near
[48:28] to me. God, I know I'm in
[48:32] need. And my lips now sing your praise.
[48:36] And my heart's been set ablaze. The
[48:39] glory of your face now I see.
[48:44] It's all because of you, Lord Jesus
[48:48] Christ. In all that I do, in all of my
[48:53] life, I will worship you. I honor you. I
[48:59] love you because you first
[49:04] love me.
[49:09] [Music]
[49:30] May God bless you. Let's stand if we
[49:35] would. We're going to sing that song. I
[49:37] worship you, Almighty
[49:41] God. Amen. Beautiful special, brother
[49:43] Paul, Sister Kimberly. Amen. We love him
[49:46] because he loves us. We come to him
[49:48] because he draws us. Amen. It's his work
[49:51] from start to finish. Amen. We're going
[49:53] to sing this song. I've worship you,
[49:54] Almighty God. Before we go to
[49:57] prayer, I
[50:00] worship
[50:02] you,
[50:05] Almighty
[50:07] God, for there is none like
[50:14] you. I
[50:17] worship
[50:18] you, oh
[50:20] prince of peace.
[50:25] That is what I
[50:28] long to
[50:30] do. I
[50:32] give you
[50:37] praise for you are my rightousness.
[50:47] I
[50:49] worship
[50:51] you
[50:53] almighty
[50:56] God. There is none like
[51:03] you. I
[51:05] worship
[51:07] you
[51:10] almighty God.
[51:13] There is none like
[51:19] you. I
[51:21] worship
[51:23] you, oh
[51:25] prince of
[51:28] peace. That is what I
[51:33] long to do.
[51:36] I
[51:37] give you
[51:41] praise for you are my
[51:45] [Music]
[51:51] rightousness. I
[51:53] worship
[51:55] you
[51:57] almighty
[52:00] God. There is none like you. One more
[52:06] time. I
[52:09] worship
[52:10] you
[52:13] almighty
[52:16] God. There is none like
[52:22] you. I
[52:24] worship you.
[52:27] Oh,
[52:28] grace of
[52:32] peace. That is what I
[52:36] long to
[52:38] do. I give you
[52:44] praise for you are my rightous.
[52:54] Oh, I
[52:56] worship
[52:58] you,
[53:00] Almighty
[53:03] God. There is none like you.
[53:09] Hallelujah.
[53:10] Thank you,
[53:11] Lord. Lord, that we could stand here
[53:14] this
[53:15] evening
[53:17] righteous. You declared it. Not me
[53:21] declaring it. Not my brothers and
[53:23] sisters, Lord, but you have declared us
[53:25] to have and be the righteousness of
[53:29] God, Lord, that Christ came and took our
[53:32] sin that we might become the
[53:34] righteousness of God. Lord, that we can
[53:37] stand in your presence this evening,
[53:40] sinless, spotless, cleansed, sanctified,
[53:44] filled with your spirit because you came
[53:47] down and took our place. You exchanged
[53:50] your place for ours. Lord, and we stand
[53:53] redeemed this evening. Hallelujah. Thank
[53:55] you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Lord, we
[53:59] can't thank you enough. We can't praise
[54:02] you enough. We can't worship you enough,
[54:04] Lord
[54:07] Jesus. Lord, if we started from when we
[54:10] woke up to the time that we fell
[54:13] asleep, Lord, it would not be enough to
[54:15] thank you, Lord. But we're saying thank
[54:18] you this evening, Lord. We're thanking
[54:21] you. Lord, we praise
[54:23] you, Lord. May we not do it just by lip
[54:27] service this evening,
[54:29] Lord, Lord, but may we day by day
[54:32] express our love, our appreciation, our
[54:35] thanks, Lord
[54:36] Jesus, for all that you've done, Lord,
[54:40] for a perfect finished work, Lord,
[54:43] that's playing out in these bodies of
[54:45] time. Lord, we thank you.
[54:48] We worship
[54:50] you, Lord. May our lives honor that
[54:54] sacrifice, Lord. Have the
[54:57] preeminence, Lord. It's a special
[55:01] day. It's a somber
[55:03] day, Lord. And yet, it's a day of
[55:06] thanksgiving as
[55:08] well, Lord. May you have the honor, the
[55:10] glory, the praise, and the
[55:12] service. May your spirit
[55:15] move, Lord. May your redemptive
[55:17] blessings be evident in our midst this
[55:20] evening, Lord. For we commit this
[55:22] service to you now in Jesus Christ's
[55:25] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if
[55:29] you would to Psalms chapter
[55:31] 30. Psalms chapter
[55:34] 30. Amen. I don't think a preacher can
[55:36] preach a Good Friday service and not
[55:39] cry. At least not a good
[55:43] preacher. I'm just covering up my
[55:45] emotion.
[55:46] Amen. It's a wonderful,
[55:48] wonderful day to be a
[55:51] believer. Amen. As we look back on a day
[55:54] that happened 2,000 years
[55:56] ago. Amen. But it's a wonderful
[55:58] privilege to be a son and daughter of
[56:00] God this evening. It's good to see
[56:02] Brother Barry, Sister Darlene, Brother
[56:04] Abby, Sister Olive with us. Amen. Good
[56:06] to see our our traveling pastoral family
[56:09] back there. Brother Gerald, Sister Betty
[56:11] back with us again. God bless you. Good
[56:12] to see you with us. certainly enjoyed
[56:14] that special this evening. What a
[56:16] wonderful gift. Amen. Amen. It's
[56:19] wonderful to see the gifts being used.
[56:21] Amen. God bless you, brother Paul,
[56:22] Sister Kim. Psalms chapter 30 and verse
[56:26] one. I will extol thee, oh Lord, for
[56:29] thou hast lifted me up and has not made
[56:32] my foes to rejoice over me. Oh Lord my
[56:35] God, I cried unto thee and thou hast
[56:38] healed me. Oh Lord, thou hast brought up
[56:40] my soul from the grave. Thou hast kept
[56:43] me alive that I should not go down to
[56:45] the pit. Sing unto the Lord, oh ye
[56:48] saints of his, and give thanks at the
[56:50] remembrance of his holiness. For his
[56:52] anger endureth but a moment in his favor
[56:56] is life. Weeping may endure for a night,
[57:00] but joy cometh in the morning. Amen. God
[57:02] bless you. You can have your seats this
[57:04] evening. God bless you. And I want to
[57:05] take a title this evening, perhaps a bit
[57:07] different. I want to speak on enduring
[57:09] the night of we of weeping and Easter is
[57:12] always a bittersweet time. Certainly
[57:14] the, you know, the Good Friday evening
[57:16] is is a is is a a time where it's somber
[57:20] and and it's reflective and it's sad.
[57:23] You know, as I when I read my Bible,
[57:25] I've said this before, I read from five
[57:26] portions or five general areas of the
[57:28] Bible, but I always circle through the
[57:30] Gospels and every time I'm coming up to
[57:32] the crucifixion, I always dread it a
[57:34] little bit because there's nothing
[57:35] enjoyable about reading the crucifixion.
[57:38] There's a price that was paid and it
[57:40] pays for us to remember that. Amen. It's
[57:43] good to read those things to remind
[57:44] ourselves on a regular basis of the
[57:45] price that was paid. But I take no joy
[57:47] in seeing what in hearing and reading
[57:49] what he went through and imagining those
[57:51] things. And yet Easter is a time of
[57:53] celebration. It's a time of wonder. It's
[57:54] a time of praise and worship. And so I'm
[57:57] caught between those emotions of of all
[57:59] the events of that that weekend. Amen.
[58:01] But we just want to dwell a bit on the
[58:04] hardships of that night perhaps. And I
[58:06] don't want to just dwell on that night,
[58:07] but I want to look back through eternity
[58:09] as we go through this because I want us
[58:12] to consider the reality of the price
[58:13] that was paid. Amen. And it's good to
[58:15] dwell on it to really talk about what
[58:17] Christ endured of his own free will and
[58:20] and how that price that was paid allows
[58:23] us today to come to the throne of God
[58:25] every single day without barrier,
[58:27] without boundary regardless of our
[58:29] condition that we could come into the
[58:31] presence of God on a daily basis because
[58:33] of the price that was paid at Calvary.
[58:36] But I want to go beyond that this like I
[58:38] said this evening. I I want to go past
[58:40] the anguish and the pain of the the
[58:41] hopelessness that they must have felt
[58:43] that day. Can you imagine being a
[58:44] disciple, a follower of Jesus that night
[58:47] and you see him and he goes and he dies
[58:49] on the cross and you go home to to to to
[58:52] go through the the rest of the Sabbath
[58:54] and these things and your heart is heavy
[58:56] and you're crying and these sorts of
[58:58] different things. But I want to take us
[58:59] out of that day and I want to go back
[59:01] into the heavenlies because so often
[59:03] that's a the struggle that we face is
[59:05] that we don't see things from God's way
[59:07] of seeing it. But we got to in this case
[59:09] with Calvary, we've got to see the
[59:10] problem from God's eyes so we can see
[59:12] the solution from God's eyes as well.
[59:14] And so I want us to see how big that
[59:16] problem was so we can see why the why
[59:18] the sacrifice why the price that was
[59:20] paid had to be so severe as well. And I
[59:22] want to take us back to Revelation 5
[59:25] this
[59:25] evening. And Revelation 5, if you
[59:28] remember, this is John being caught up a
[59:30] little higher. Remember John was in the
[59:32] the the spirit and then the spirit
[59:34] brought him in and then it said, "Come
[59:36] up a little higher, John." And he said,
[59:38] "I saw on the right hand of him that sat
[59:39] on the throne a book written within and
[59:42] on the backside sealed with seven
[59:44] seals." This is the throne of God he's
[59:46] talking about. This is where deity is
[59:49] sitting and he's sitting there and he
[59:50] has a book that's sealed up. He has
[59:52] ownership and he has sealed it. So you
[59:54] have to take it from him and it has to
[59:56] be opened and read. And it says, "And I
[59:59] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:00:01] loud voice, who is worthy to open the
[1:00:04] book and to loose the seals thereof."
[1:00:06] So, it's not just taking the book that's
[1:00:08] required, but somebody's got to be able
[1:00:10] to open it up and read what's on the
[1:00:13] inside. And he says, "Who's worthy?"
[1:00:14] Today, we'd say, "Who's qualified?"
[1:00:16] There's certain things you have to be
[1:00:18] qualified to do today. If you're going
[1:00:20] to work on electrical systems, you got
[1:00:22] to be a journeyman or or a red seal
[1:00:24] apprentice. If you're going to design
[1:00:26] certain things, you have to be an
[1:00:27] engineer with a degree or professional
[1:00:29] engineering status. If you're going to
[1:00:31] do surgery, you better have a doctor's
[1:00:33] uh training and those sorts of things.
[1:00:35] But here we've got something something
[1:00:37] that requires worthiness. Somebody has
[1:00:39] to have what it takes to open this book
[1:00:42] and loose the seals off of it. And it
[1:00:44] says, "And no man in heaven nor in
[1:00:47] earth, neither under the earth was able
[1:00:49] to open the book, neither to look their
[1:00:51] own." Now notice now, not a single
[1:00:53] person from all of history is worthy to
[1:00:57] open the book. No man, no woman, listen,
[1:01:00] nobody. Look, you'd say, "Well, anyone
[1:01:02] in he in earth, I understand that." But
[1:01:04] there's men in heaven. You look at
[1:01:07] Enoch. God was pleased with Enoch. That
[1:01:09] was Enoch's rapture res revelation was
[1:01:11] that he pleased God. But he didn't
[1:01:13] please him enough to be worthy. Elijah's
[1:01:15] there and he's not worthy either. The
[1:01:18] best of us is still not
[1:01:20] worthy. He says, "And I wept much." The
[1:01:23] literal translation there is I mourned
[1:01:26] or I cried constantly. He was
[1:01:29] inconsolable. John started crying and he
[1:01:31] didn't stop crying. He says, "Because
[1:01:34] why? No man was found worthy to open and
[1:01:37] to read the book." And this is the
[1:01:39] prophet John now. And he's been caught
[1:01:41] up into the heavenlies and he's been
[1:01:43] shown a situation of God seated on the
[1:01:45] throne. And he's holding a book. And
[1:01:47] it's not just any book, but it's a book
[1:01:49] that is meant to be taken. It has to be
[1:01:52] taken. It has to be loosed. It has to be
[1:01:55] opened. And then it has to be read.
[1:01:57] That's its purpose as a book is to be
[1:01:59] taken and read. And if it doesn't get
[1:02:02] opened, it spells doom for humanity. If
[1:02:06] the book is not taken, we are doomed. We
[1:02:09] are of all men most miserable. We cannot
[1:02:11] leave this situation we're in. We would
[1:02:13] have to be separated from God eternally.
[1:02:16] If that book doesn't come back to
[1:02:18] mankind, mankind can never be
[1:02:21] redeemed. That's the situation that
[1:02:23] we're seeing. And John, when he realized
[1:02:25] that this book was not going to be
[1:02:27] opened and read, he cried and he cried
[1:02:30] and he cried. He could not be consoled.
[1:02:32] He could not be comforted. This wasn't a
[1:02:34] situation where you could go and sit
[1:02:35] down with John and say, "John, it's
[1:02:37] going to be
[1:02:39] okay." No, John knew it wasn't going to
[1:02:41] be okay. Because every man had been
[1:02:44] tested and tried and been found wanting.
[1:02:47] Nobody could take the book. And John is
[1:02:50] this weeping doesn't just start. But
[1:02:52] John starts to cry when he realizes, I
[1:02:55] can't do it. You can't do it. We can't
[1:02:58] do it. We can't bind together and do it.
[1:03:00] My good works won't do it. My religion
[1:03:02] won't do it. My pastor won't do it. My
[1:03:05] church attendance won't do it. My
[1:03:06] tithing won't do it. We can't do it. Our
[1:03:09] good intentions, our faithfulness to the
[1:03:11] word still won't do it. That's when he
[1:03:14] started crying when he realized what
[1:03:16] I've done is not good enough and neither
[1:03:18] is anybody else's.
[1:03:20] He's in a situation where he realizes we
[1:03:23] can't make it. And that's when John
[1:03:25] started to cry because he knows we're
[1:03:27] supposed to make it and yet we can't do
[1:03:30] it. If we were to drop out of eternity
[1:03:33] and into time, we would say that
[1:03:35] humanity wept for 4,000 years. John
[1:03:39] represents the elect. John represents
[1:03:41] the bride. John represents those whose
[1:03:44] names are in that book. And they cry and
[1:03:47] they cry and they cry because for every
[1:03:49] bit of trying they do, they cannot draw
[1:03:51] any closer to God. There is a gap
[1:03:54] between us. There's a great gulf between
[1:03:57] us and him and we can't close it. And
[1:03:59] John just starts to
[1:04:01] cry. Why? Because he knows what that
[1:04:03] book
[1:04:04] is. We look at that book and we look
[1:04:07] throughout the book of Revelation and we
[1:04:08] see that that book is the lamb's book of
[1:04:11] life. Amen. I won't read the scriptures
[1:04:13] for the sake of time tonight, but we see
[1:04:15] time and time again there's only one
[1:04:17] book that matters to the elect. There's
[1:04:19] only one book that matters to the bride
[1:04:21] and that is the na the book that has
[1:04:23] their names on it that were written
[1:04:24] there before the foundation of this
[1:04:26] world. That's what this book is. Amen.
[1:04:29] It is the title deed. It's the family
[1:04:31] tree. It's the book of redemption. It's
[1:04:33] the book of the rapture. It's the book
[1:04:35] of life. It's everything that we are
[1:04:37] supposed to have as children of God is
[1:04:40] written inside that book. Amen. Your
[1:04:42] victories in that book. Your rapture,
[1:04:45] your resurrection, your your assurance,
[1:04:47] your insurance, your eternal security is
[1:04:50] written in that book, but it needs to be
[1:04:52] taken and it needs to be read in order
[1:04:54] for us to be restored back. And that
[1:04:56] book was out of reach. Who's going to go
[1:04:59] take it from
[1:05:01] God? Not
[1:05:03] me. Definitely not me. Brother Vichel
[1:05:07] looks like GQ, but that's not going to
[1:05:08] get you there tonight, Brother
[1:05:10] Vichel. We can dress ourselves up. We
[1:05:13] can do all of our good works. It's not
[1:05:16] going to get us
[1:05:18] there. That book wasn't being read. It
[1:05:21] wasn't even
[1:05:22] opened. Wasn't even opened. And John is
[1:05:25] sitting here and he's wanting somebody
[1:05:27] to take that book and redeem humanity.
[1:05:30] And nobody's able to do it. Nobody's
[1:05:32] worthy. They've got to pass God's test
[1:05:34] of worthiness. And none of us can do
[1:05:37] it. That's the title deed to our
[1:05:39] redemption. It's the title deed to this
[1:05:41] earth. What would happen today if you
[1:05:42] don't have a title deed to your house?
[1:05:45] If you don't have a title deed to your
[1:05:47] house, anybody can come into your house.
[1:05:49] If you can't show that that house
[1:05:51] belongs to you, then they get to say
[1:05:53] it's as good as mine as it is yours. If
[1:05:55] you don't have a piece of paper and I
[1:05:56] don't have a piece of paper, then it's
[1:05:57] just as much mine as yours. And they can
[1:05:59] park in your driveway, brother Joe. They
[1:06:02] can go in your shed quarters and take it
[1:06:03] over. They can lay in your bed. They can
[1:06:06] eat your food. And you can't do anything
[1:06:08] about it because you don't have the
[1:06:09] title deed.
[1:06:11] Why? Because you don't have legal
[1:06:13] recourse. If you don't have that piece
[1:06:14] of paper, you don't have your name on it
[1:06:18] that gives you the rights to protect
[1:06:20] your property from anybody that comes
[1:06:21] against it. John's weeping here because
[1:06:23] the title deed's been lost for
[1:06:26] mankind. And there's no way to get it
[1:06:28] back.
[1:06:29] Adam went from being an amateur god, the
[1:06:32] son of God, having everything on this
[1:06:34] earth under his power and authority to
[1:06:36] switching to a place where he's in a
[1:06:38] constant battle with every element of
[1:06:40] this world, including his own self.
[1:06:43] That's the condition mankind fell fell
[1:06:45] into. That's why John's weeping cuz he
[1:06:47] sees no hope to get out of the condition
[1:06:50] that he's in. Even in this situation,
[1:06:52] what happened? Satan got kicked out of
[1:06:54] heaven and he comes down here and he
[1:06:55] takes on squatters rights. He takes
[1:06:58] possession because we've lost the deed.
[1:07:01] We have no authority now. He's a
[1:07:03] squatter. He's a
[1:07:06] pretender. But if you don't have
[1:07:07] authority to kick him out, he's got as
[1:07:09] much right to be here as you do. And
[1:07:11] it's going to take the book to kick him
[1:07:12] out. It's going to take the title deed
[1:07:14] coming back into the hands of men. And
[1:07:16] what happened after Adam fell was that
[1:07:18] man was left to free moral agency. And
[1:07:20] guess what? Satan's had a circus with
[1:07:21] free moral agency ever since. Cuz his
[1:07:24] flesh wants him. And there's only
[1:07:26] something in the inside that fights. And
[1:07:27] so man's never been able to overcome
[1:07:30] completely. But I want to paint a
[1:07:32] picture about why John is weeping so
[1:07:34] bitterly. Because John understood what
[1:07:36] was missing. John knew the book of
[1:07:38] Genesis. John knew what we used to have
[1:07:40] before. Amen. And so John understood the
[1:07:43] magnitude of the problem. And I believe
[1:07:45] you look in scripture, you'll see that
[1:07:47] child after child of God understood the
[1:07:49] problem cuz they kept trying, but they
[1:07:52] could never overcome.
[1:07:54] They could do their best and sometimes
[1:07:56] it was really, really good. You look at
[1:07:58] Samuel, you look at Joseph, near perfect
[1:08:02] and still not
[1:08:03] enough. And when you do everything you
[1:08:05] can and you're almost perfect and that's
[1:08:07] not enough, that's when you realize
[1:08:08] there's a problem
[1:08:11] here. He says this, we find out that
[1:08:15] when John looked and saw that book still
[1:08:17] in the hands of the original owner, God,
[1:08:19] he says, you remember how it was lost by
[1:08:22] Adam? He forfeited the book of life for
[1:08:25] the knowledge of Satan and lost his
[1:08:27] inheritance. He lost everything. And to
[1:08:30] make matters worse, he says there was no
[1:08:33] way for
[1:08:34] redemption. It's one thing to lose it
[1:08:36] and say, "I can get it back." We put
[1:08:38] things I I don't think we do it so much
[1:08:40] these days. People put things into pawn
[1:08:42] shops with the idea that I'm going to
[1:08:43] get it back. This was not a pawn shop
[1:08:46] experience. It was gone. They lost total
[1:08:48] ownership of it. There was no coming
[1:08:50] back. Amen. And John knows what that
[1:08:53] meant because he knew what they had back
[1:08:55] in those days. He knew what it was to
[1:08:57] have relationship with God. He knew what
[1:09:00] it was to have fellowship with God
[1:09:01] because the book of Genesis detailed it.
[1:09:03] How he would come down in the cool of
[1:09:05] the evening and he would walk and he
[1:09:06] would talk and he would comfort and he
[1:09:08] would lay them down to sleep at night.
[1:09:10] And there was no fear, there was no
[1:09:12] pain, there was no suffering, there was
[1:09:13] no sickness. There was full authority,
[1:09:16] perfect
[1:09:18] rest, total
[1:09:20] control in
[1:09:22] love. And he's looking and he's seeing
[1:09:24] there's no way to get back to
[1:09:26] that. Everything that Adam had, he lost.
[1:09:31] And there was no way for Adam or any son
[1:09:32] of Adam to go back and get
[1:09:34] it. And in that knowledge, John knew
[1:09:37] unless that book is taken and opened,
[1:09:39] we're not going back there. Brother Bram
[1:09:41] says this. He says first the
[1:09:42] announcement went forth for who is able
[1:09:44] to come and take the book of redemption.
[1:09:47] See for the whole plan of redemption
[1:09:49] from Adam all that Adam lost there was
[1:09:51] nothing lost until Adam and after Adam
[1:09:53] all was lost in the earth and everything
[1:09:56] on the creation of the earth was lost
[1:09:58] and everything fell with Adam. Adam
[1:10:01] crossed the chasm that no one could get
[1:10:04] back. No way at all. Man when he sinned
[1:10:07] he left his way. He left no way back for
[1:10:10] himself.
[1:10:13] You say, "Why did he have to pay a price
[1:10:14] so great?" Because we had no way back.
[1:10:17] We could not do it. After Adam and Eve
[1:10:19] fell from their position, they went out
[1:10:22] from the presence of God. And you have
[1:10:23] to realize, church, they did not leave
[1:10:25] willingly. They didn't want to leave the
[1:10:27] presence of God. God drove them out. The
[1:10:32] scripture says he drove them out. He
[1:10:34] expelled them. He cast them out. And he
[1:10:36] blocked the way with an angel, a
[1:10:38] cherubam, with a flaming sword. and
[1:10:39] there was no way they could come
[1:10:41] back. You could only see that, I think,
[1:10:44] this evening. And a and just in your eye
[1:10:46] cast a a vision of what that must have
[1:10:50] looked like. They've had a a few minutes
[1:10:53] conversation with God and they've been
[1:10:56] judged and they've been found guilty and
[1:10:59] their whole world comes crumbling
[1:11:02] down and then God starts to take them
[1:11:04] and he starts to drive them out of the
[1:11:06] garden and everything that they've
[1:11:10] known starts to fade away just in that
[1:11:15] moment. They're walking out of the
[1:11:17] garden and those hands are pushing them
[1:11:19] forward. No doubt they're stumbling.
[1:11:20] They're crying. They don't even know
[1:11:22] what's going on. You parents that have
[1:11:23] had children, you know, when they're
[1:11:24] overcome and they don't even know where
[1:11:26] they're going. They don't know what
[1:11:27] they're doing. Have you ever seen that?
[1:11:28] And you're just having to guide them
[1:11:29] along. That's what God was doing.
[1:11:32] Guiding them out of his presence.
[1:11:35] Amen. They're driving them out of a
[1:11:37] perfect
[1:11:38] land, perfect
[1:11:40] relationship, into a battle for the rest
[1:11:43] of their life. He says, "But notice they
[1:11:45] had sinned now." And I can hear God say,
[1:11:48] "Because you came out of the dust of the
[1:11:49] earth, to dust thou shalt return." Poor
[1:11:52] little Eve threw her head over on Adam's
[1:11:54] shoulders and began weeping because she
[1:11:56] knew what she'd done. Adam put his arm
[1:11:58] around Eve and there they go walking out
[1:12:00] of Eden, condemned. I can just hear that
[1:12:03] old bloody sheep skin around the
[1:12:05] beautiful figure of those two people
[1:12:07] slapping against their legs as they're
[1:12:09] going walking out of
[1:12:12] Eden. God was pushing them out of his
[1:12:15] presence. I don't even think they
[1:12:16] realized that's what was happening in
[1:12:17] that
[1:12:18] moment, guiding them out of there. In
[1:12:21] their life, they had always had that
[1:12:23] ability to come into his presence. And
[1:12:25] now they're losing it just in a moment.
[1:12:28] They'd never been without him. And now
[1:12:29] they would never be with him in the way
[1:12:30] they have been all their life. Total
[1:12:33] change. Lost, brokenhearted, unable to
[1:12:36] comprehend what was going
[1:12:39] on. As I was studying, I put a line
[1:12:42] here. said, "It's like having a
[1:12:43] nightmare for the first time, except
[1:12:45] it's
[1:12:45] real." We have
[1:12:47] nightmares and we wake up and we say,
[1:12:50] "I'm so glad that was a nightmare." But
[1:12:52] they're having their first nightmare and
[1:12:54] it's a reality. It's happening right
[1:12:58] there. Brother Bam would he talk about
[1:13:01] it time and time again. He'd say they're
[1:13:02] walking out and that bloody lamb skinin
[1:13:05] is slapping on their thighs as they go
[1:13:07] and they're stumbling and they're
[1:13:10] crying and they're walking
[1:13:13] along and Adam's got his arm around
[1:13:17] Eve and they're not wanting to go but
[1:13:20] there's a hand on the back of their
[1:13:22] necks pushing
[1:13:24] them and they know something bad is
[1:13:28] happening but they can't comprehend it.
[1:13:31] And something keeps pushing them and
[1:13:34] pushing them and then in a minute the
[1:13:37] hand
[1:13:38] lifts and they turn around and he's
[1:13:42] gone disappeared and standing there is
[1:13:46] an angel with a sword and maybe they
[1:13:48] come and they they try and go around and
[1:13:51] that angel moves with them. They can't
[1:13:53] see him. They can't touch Christ. They
[1:13:56] can't come back into his presence. He's
[1:13:59] disappeared. He doesn't even say
[1:14:00] goodbye. He's just gone in a moment.
[1:14:02] They cross the boundary from life into
[1:14:05] death. Separated from the presence of
[1:14:07] God, never to feel that touch again.
[1:14:12] Church, did they
[1:14:14] cry, church? I think they cried their
[1:14:16] eyes out. That hang came off and a chill
[1:14:20] goes up their back for the first time.
[1:14:22] They wonder what's going to happen. What
[1:14:25] does this death look like? Fear starts
[1:14:28] to come in for the first time.
[1:14:30] Can you imagine what's going on? Their
[1:14:34] entire being is being transformed from
[1:14:36] love into
[1:14:40] death. Life has departed. They're
[1:14:43] already dead. They just don't know
[1:14:45] it. And none of that calm, loving
[1:14:48] presence to be felt
[1:14:51] anymore. Disappeared out of their life.
[1:14:53] And they can't go back to him again.
[1:14:58] The scripture says for those that are
[1:15:01] separated from God, they always have
[1:15:02] this one feature. There's wailing and
[1:15:05] nashing of
[1:15:07] teeth. Because when you realize you've
[1:15:09] been separated from God forever, that's
[1:15:12] not something you just shrug your
[1:15:13] shoulders and say, "Ah." When it hits
[1:15:16] you that you are lost, as lost can be,
[1:15:20] and there's no coming back. That is not
[1:15:22] a time when people are going to say,
[1:15:24] "Only God can judge me.
[1:15:27] where they can say, "God knows my
[1:15:29] heart." No, you know your heart. And
[1:15:32] you'll know in that moment your heart
[1:15:34] was not right with
[1:15:36] God. That's why John
[1:15:39] wept. He saw the absolute total
[1:15:43] separation from God that we had without
[1:15:46] that book being
[1:15:47] opened. Nothing we could come back. Adam
[1:15:51] lost it that day in Eden and it went
[1:15:54] back to God because I was the original
[1:15:56] owner. Be like me sitting here and
[1:15:59] somebody comes up to me and says, "Your
[1:16:01] redemption is on the moon. You just have
[1:16:04] to build a bridge from here to the moon
[1:16:05] in your
[1:16:06] lifetime. Could we do it? If the whole
[1:16:10] world got together, we couldn't do it.
[1:16:12] We don't have enough material to get us
[1:16:14] there. We don't have the engineering
[1:16:15] skills. We don't have the money. We
[1:16:17] don't have the
[1:16:19] time. And to sit there and know that in
[1:16:21] myself I could never do it. I wouldn't
[1:16:24] even start. Wouldn't even start because
[1:16:26] I know it could never be done. That's
[1:16:28] why John was crying because he'd already
[1:16:30] been judged. Humanity being judged.
[1:16:32] There's no point in even trying. You
[1:16:34] cannot get back. None of us is worthy to
[1:16:37] take the book. That's why John was
[1:16:39] crying. He saw the value of that book.
[1:16:41] He saw the need for that book.
[1:16:44] But he saw the gap between him and that
[1:16:46] book was too big for any man to cross in
[1:16:49] this earth. You ever started
[1:16:52] something and you get into it a ways and
[1:16:55] you realize I can't do
[1:16:57] this? I've done it so many times mostly
[1:17:00] on car
[1:17:02] repairs. But there are things where you
[1:17:04] think I can do this. I've got the
[1:17:06] discipline. I've got the will. I've got
[1:17:08] the power. I've got the skills. I've got
[1:17:09] the knowhow. I've got the education.
[1:17:11] I've got the
[1:17:13] desire. and you get halfway through and
[1:17:15] you realize, I'm not going to make it
[1:17:16] through. I can't do it. I
[1:17:20] overstepped my
[1:17:22] abilities. Now, take that and tie it
[1:17:24] back to your life. And if you fail, you
[1:17:27] lose your life. And can you imagine
[1:17:29] having that slipping out of your
[1:17:31] fingers? Having to lay down your tools
[1:17:34] for the last time and say, "I've given
[1:17:35] it everything I've got and I can't do
[1:17:37] it." That's what John was feeling in
[1:17:39] this moment. I've given it everything
[1:17:41] I've got and we haven't even started to
[1:17:44] cross this
[1:17:47] gap. Imagine your only hope is in that
[1:17:50] book and God search comes back and says,
[1:17:54] "No one's found worthy. You're going to
[1:17:57] have to stay in your pain. You're going
[1:17:58] to have to stay in your sickness, your
[1:17:59] suffering, your frustration, your worry,
[1:18:02] your hurt for the rest of your life."
[1:18:08] Would you cry? I
[1:18:11] cried. John
[1:18:13] cried. All of humanity cried when they
[1:18:16] realized what they'd
[1:18:18] lost. No one worthy. Says John looked
[1:18:21] around and here sack God on the throne
[1:18:23] with a book in his hand that had been
[1:18:25] sealed with seven seals and the whole
[1:18:26] plan of redemption was in it. And it had
[1:18:29] been lost by the human race, Adam. It
[1:18:31] went back where? Satan couldn't take it.
[1:18:33] He just caused him to lose it. But where
[1:18:35] did the book go back to then? It didn't
[1:18:37] belong to the human race. The blessings
[1:18:40] didn't belong here. Here the human race
[1:18:42] had lost it. So it went right on back to
[1:18:44] its original owner. And that was God. He
[1:18:46] says here he sat with it. He called for
[1:18:49] some man, somebody to come and claim it.
[1:18:52] God wasn't saying I won't give it. He
[1:18:54] was saying if you're worthy, I'll give
[1:18:56] it. He gave us every opportunity.
[1:18:59] John looked around and there was no man
[1:19:01] in heaven, no man on earth, nobody, no
[1:19:03] angel, nothing could take the book or
[1:19:05] loose the seals or to even look on it.
[1:19:08] No man was worthy. And John said, he
[1:19:10] wept
[1:19:11] brotherly. Not only that, see, here's
[1:19:14] the thing. It's one thing to not get
[1:19:16] what you want, but now we're stuck with
[1:19:18] having to take what we don't want as
[1:19:20] well. Isn't that what life is?
[1:19:25] There's a saying that
[1:19:27] says you're born naked, hungry, and
[1:19:30] cold, and things just get work worse
[1:19:33] from
[1:19:34] there. Scripture says life is but a
[1:19:37] vapor. It's a breath. It's a moment.
[1:19:40] There's that song says life is something
[1:19:43] life is is full of
[1:19:46] trouble. That's why John's weeping. He's
[1:19:48] saying, "Is this all we've got? A life
[1:19:51] of trying, a life of trouble and nothing
[1:19:53] to show for it. What a miserable
[1:19:56] condition. I'll tell you, if that's
[1:19:58] where you think you are tonight, you're
[1:20:00] in a miserable condition. And you need
[1:20:02] this book of redemption opened up to
[1:20:04] you. If you say, "If this is all there
[1:20:06] is to life, you've missed the picture.
[1:20:09] You've missed the work of the redeeming
[1:20:11] lamb in the scripture."
[1:20:13] Amen. Trying and trying and trying and
[1:20:15] doing your best and getting nowhere.
[1:20:18] One day you'll break and you'll cry and
[1:20:22] you'll say, "Why can't I do it?" And
[1:20:23] that's a perfect time to have a redeemer
[1:20:25] come into your
[1:20:26] life. Someone has to pay the price,
[1:20:29] though. We can try and pay the price.
[1:20:32] Listen, we pay a price every day as
[1:20:34] believers, but it's not a price for this
[1:20:36] book. We couldn't ever pay it. It has to
[1:20:39] be somebody beyond us. One of us, and
[1:20:41] yet somebody beyond us. We were stuck.
[1:20:43] We were the miserable ones. We were the
[1:20:45] weak ones. We were the unworthy ones. We
[1:20:46] need somebody that's
[1:20:48] strong. We need somebody that's worthy.
[1:20:51] We need someone that's acceptable. We
[1:20:53] need somebody that's
[1:20:54] willing. We've got some pretty good
[1:20:56] people, but how much of us are even
[1:20:58] willing to do
[1:21:01] it? Someone had to take our place of
[1:21:03] weeping so we could come to a place of
[1:21:05] rejoicing. Somebody had to take our
[1:21:07] place of pain so that we could be
[1:21:09] healed. Somebody had to take our place
[1:21:12] of
[1:21:12] death so we could come into life.
[1:21:16] Somebody has to take our
[1:21:17] position. Nobody wants to do it. It was
[1:21:21] no small thing. We see Christ stepped in
[1:21:23] that day at Calvary and he took our
[1:21:25] place and we're preaching on the the the
[1:21:28] sacrifice that he paid at Calvary here
[1:21:30] tonight. And we see that this is a day
[1:21:32] of weeping. This is a night of weeping.
[1:21:34] This is a night of sorrow. The night and
[1:21:36] the the day that Jesus went through and
[1:21:38] then the night that he died and laid in
[1:21:40] that tomb, nobody left that place a
[1:21:42] happy person that loved him.
[1:21:45] Jesus
[1:21:47] wept. Mary wept. His disciples wept. His
[1:21:51] followers
[1:21:53] wept. This was a night of crying. And
[1:21:56] not a single person there except Christ
[1:21:58] himself
[1:21:59] realized that this was a night for
[1:22:03] happiness. It was a night for
[1:22:06] weeping. Not a single one realized that
[1:22:08] the price for sin had been paid. If we
[1:22:11] had, we'd have probably wept and cry.
[1:22:13] wept and laughed at the same time. It's
[1:22:16] a hard thing to do, but sometimes you're
[1:22:17] so happy you cry and sometimes you're so
[1:22:20] sad and happy at the same time. That's
[1:22:22] what it ought to have been. But it was a
[1:22:24] night of weeping and weeping and
[1:22:26] weeping. And we open with that scripture
[1:22:28] in Psalm. It said, "For his anger
[1:22:30] endureth but a
[1:22:32] moment. In his favor is life. Weeping
[1:22:34] may endure for a night, but joy cometh
[1:22:37] in the morning." We look at that his
[1:22:39] anger, his wrath is for a moment. And
[1:22:43] when we look at what Christ took, he
[1:22:44] took the full wrath of God. The full
[1:22:47] wrath, the total wrath of God. Amen. The
[1:22:51] events of his last day were on him
[1:22:53] enduring the penalty for every single
[1:22:56] sin that ever was and that ever would be
[1:22:58] for all of
[1:23:00] time. That's the price that he had to
[1:23:02] pay. You know, as children, we do
[1:23:04] something wrong. We get a spanking for a
[1:23:06] single thing. And that's a rough day,
[1:23:08] isn't it? None of us enjoys a spanking.
[1:23:12] But can you imagine if we got a spanking
[1:23:15] for everything we
[1:23:17] did? That would be rough. But what would
[1:23:20] happen if dad came to you and he said,
[1:23:23] "Daughter, son, we're going to get this
[1:23:26] all over with in a single
[1:23:29] day. I'm going to spank you for
[1:23:31] everything you have done, everything you
[1:23:34] will do, and we're just going to do it
[1:23:35] all today." How many of us would sign up
[1:23:37] for
[1:23:38] that? because you know he's going to be
[1:23:41] there for at least a day, maybe a week,
[1:23:44] just spanking and spanking and
[1:23:47] spanking. And church, if he's using his
[1:23:49] hand, both you and he are going to be
[1:23:50] raw within the first 20 minutes. And
[1:23:53] he's going to keep going and going and
[1:23:55] going. And when he's done, you're not
[1:23:57] going to be able to
[1:23:59] walk for weeks, maybe months, maybe not
[1:24:02] ever. It would destroy your body just
[1:24:05] with a slap like
[1:24:06] that for every time we did something
[1:24:08] wrong.
[1:24:10] Every crossword, every disobedient
[1:24:12] moment, every piece of broken furniture,
[1:24:14] every scratch in dad's
[1:24:17] car, every
[1:24:20] thought, every
[1:24:22] attitude, every bad
[1:24:25] reaction, every little lie. Just one
[1:24:28] spank and he'd still be there for days
[1:24:30] or weeks,
[1:24:32] maybe. Would we take
[1:24:34] it? I don't think we would. We couldn't
[1:24:37] even handle that.
[1:24:39] Now magnify
[1:24:41] that. Now say, who's going to take the
[1:24:44] spankings for
[1:24:45] everybody? Take the family. Who will
[1:24:48] take a spanking for everyone in the
[1:24:50] family? Would Jensen take the spankings
[1:24:53] for our entire group of
[1:24:56] kids? Now we're there for a month of
[1:24:58] spankings and Jensen's never going to
[1:25:00] walk again. He may not survive
[1:25:03] it. Now spread it through the entire
[1:25:05] church. Will one man stand up and take
[1:25:08] the penalty? Not on your life. Now
[1:25:11] imagine taking it for the whole
[1:25:13] world. That's the penalty that he paid.
[1:25:16] And God had to take that suffering, that
[1:25:20] pain, that wrath and compress
[1:25:24] it, compress it into 15 hours of
[1:25:29] anguish. Christ had suffered for 33 and
[1:25:32] 1/2 years. He didn't live an easy life.
[1:25:35] Everywhere he went, he was rejected. He
[1:25:37] was
[1:25:38] persecuted. Things said about him,
[1:25:40] things done to him. Had to had people
[1:25:42] try and kill him multiple times in his
[1:25:44] life, slander him. He didn't have an
[1:25:47] easy life. But in that last 15 hours or
[1:25:50] so, God took all the wrath that was
[1:25:53] supposed to be on every single person
[1:25:56] and he took it out on that
[1:25:58] man. That's the price that he paid.
[1:26:03] Isaiah 53 gives
[1:26:06] us only the
[1:26:09] briefest of insight into what happened
[1:26:12] to Christ. He said, "Who hath believed
[1:26:14] our report unto whom is the arm of the
[1:26:16] Lord revealed? For he, Christ the
[1:26:18] Messiah, shall grow up before him as a
[1:26:20] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[1:26:23] ground. He had no form or comeliness,
[1:26:25] and when we shall see him, there is no
[1:26:26] beauty that we should desire him." Now
[1:26:29] catch the suffering. He is despised and
[1:26:32] rejected of men. He's a man of sorrows
[1:26:37] and acquainted with grief. Not just on
[1:26:39] the cross,
[1:26:40] church. This didn't start on the cross.
[1:26:42] It finished on the
[1:26:43] cross. He says, "And we hid as it were
[1:26:46] our faces from him. He was despised and
[1:26:49] we esteemed him not." He said, "Surely
[1:26:51] he has borne our griefs. We taken and
[1:26:55] lifted and carried away our griefs. The
[1:26:58] grief that we should have felt, he took
[1:27:00] it away. He says, "And he carried our
[1:27:03] sorrows. He held them. He suffered them.
[1:27:06] And he endured our sorrows for us." He
[1:27:09] says, "Yet we did esteem him stricken,
[1:27:11] smitten of God, and afflicted as if he
[1:27:13] had done something to deserve it." And
[1:27:15] it was what you and I did that put him
[1:27:17] there. He said, "But he was wounded for
[1:27:20] our transgressions." That word wounded
[1:27:23] does not speak of physical mauling.
[1:27:26] It means he was
[1:27:28] profained. He was
[1:27:31] defiled. He was
[1:27:33] polluted. He was
[1:27:36] desecrated. In other words, he became
[1:27:39] filthy for you and I. Remember what it
[1:27:42] says? It says that he hath made him to
[1:27:44] be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:27:47] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:27:49] in him. He became
[1:27:51] you. Our description is defiled.
[1:27:56] profigned, polluted,
[1:27:59] desecrated. That's what we
[1:28:02] were. He says he was bruised for our
[1:28:04] iniquities. That's where he got beat up.
[1:28:07] That means he was crushed. He was
[1:28:09] destroyed. He was broken. Now, catch
[1:28:11] this. For our
[1:28:14] willful
[1:28:15] disobedience. That's the killer, church.
[1:28:18] When we know better and we do it
[1:28:20] anyways. That's what he was broken for
[1:28:23] was when I won't listen. When I won't
[1:28:26] obey, when I won't do what I clearly
[1:28:29] know to do. He says, "Now, and the
[1:28:32] chastisement of our peace was upon him."
[1:28:34] That's him taking our discipline. That's
[1:28:36] him taking our spankings as we were
[1:28:38] talking about. It says, "And with his
[1:28:40] stripes, we are healed. By his wounds,
[1:28:43] by his ripped apart flesh, we receive
[1:28:46] healing."
[1:28:48] He says, "All we like sheep have gone
[1:28:51] astray." In other words, none of us can
[1:28:52] say, "No, no, no. That's not
[1:28:54] me." None of us can say, "No, no, no. I
[1:28:58] I wasn't
[1:28:59] profane." He didn't get broken. No, no.
[1:29:02] He says, "Every single one of us, we
[1:29:04] gone out of our way." He says, "We have
[1:29:07] turned everyone to his own way. Every
[1:29:09] one of us went our own way. Every one of
[1:29:11] us was lost. We had no way back, and it
[1:29:13] was our fault." He says, "And the Lord
[1:29:15] hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[1:29:18] He was oppressed and he was afflicted.
[1:29:21] He was harassed and oppressed. Yet he
[1:29:24] opened not his mouth. He is brought as a
[1:29:27] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[1:29:29] before her sheerers is dumb. So he
[1:29:31] openeth not his mouth. He was taken from
[1:29:34] prison and from judgment. And who shall
[1:29:37] declare his generation? For he was cut
[1:29:39] up out of the land of the living. And
[1:29:41] for the transgression of my people was
[1:29:44] he
[1:29:44] stricken. And he made his grave with the
[1:29:47] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:29:50] because he had done no violence. Neither
[1:29:52] was there any deceit in his mouth. It
[1:29:55] says, "Yet it
[1:29:57] pleased it pleased the Lord to bruise
[1:30:01] him. He hath put him to grief." We're
[1:30:05] talking about enduring the night of
[1:30:06] weeping.
[1:30:08] We look at what happened in these first
[1:30:10] 10 verses. That's a time of weeping.
[1:30:12] It's a time of weeping for Christ as he
[1:30:14] goes through it. Church, it's a time of
[1:30:16] weeping for us to realize I put him
[1:30:18] right there. It's for me that he went
[1:30:20] through that. He literally is there
[1:30:23] because I put him
[1:30:28] there. Humanity have been suffering
[1:30:30] under partial judgment for a while
[1:30:32] because under the law there has to be a
[1:30:34] consequence. But the full wrath of God
[1:30:36] was held back by the blood of bulls and
[1:30:39] goats. But now as the perfect atonement
[1:30:43] comes, the full wrath of God gets poured
[1:30:46] out. You look in the book of Isaiah and
[1:30:48] Ezekiel and Jeremiah, you see how bad
[1:30:50] God treated Israel because of their
[1:30:52] daytoday life. And that was only the
[1:30:55] partial wrath of God. It was a response
[1:30:58] to the law. But now as Christ comes up
[1:31:01] and he says, "I'm going to pay the price
[1:31:03] for sin." God says, "I've got to pour
[1:31:05] out my anger on you then." Righteous
[1:31:07] anger under the law. And that body of
[1:31:11] Christ took the full wrath of God. And
[1:31:15] that's what we just read in Isaiah
[1:31:18] 53. The full wrath of God poured out on
[1:31:21] the man of a human on a human body. You
[1:31:24] and I couldn't take that. We couldn't
[1:31:26] take it. Brother Brham would say his
[1:31:28] body was built to take it because it
[1:31:32] would have killed anybody else. And so
[1:31:34] that perfect body took the total wrath
[1:31:38] of
[1:31:39] God. You talk about a reason to cry. He
[1:31:42] couldn't
[1:31:44] die. You know, they say that's that was
[1:31:46] the the sweet mercy of of heavy torture
[1:31:49] was that eventually you died from the
[1:31:51] pain. He couldn't die from the pain. He
[1:31:54] was built to endure it.
[1:31:57] He was built to endure it. He couldn't
[1:31:59] go into sweet
[1:32:02] never. He couldn't pass out. His body
[1:32:05] was too strong to pass out. So, he had
[1:32:07] to stay
[1:32:09] awake, alive, and endure it all the way
[1:32:12] to the bitter
[1:32:14] end. He was built to take our
[1:32:18] suffering. What a horrible thing.
[1:32:21] Brother Ram says, "What did he do? The
[1:32:23] wrath of God was upon us for being
[1:32:25] sinners." Is that right? Noah can save
[1:32:27] himself. He said there's nothing we
[1:32:29] could do. We're all born in sin, shaped
[1:32:31] in iniquity, and come to the world
[1:32:32] speaking lies. And what did he do? He
[1:32:34] says he came to the earth. Hallelujah.
[1:32:36] And he treaded the wine press. All the
[1:32:39] wrath of Almighty God was poured out
[1:32:41] upon him. And it says, "Thou art worthy,
[1:32:44] oh lamb of God, for you were slain,
[1:32:46] taking the sins of the world upon him.
[1:32:48] And he bore our sin. That God poured out
[1:32:51] the fierceness of his wrath upon him. He
[1:32:53] was wounded for our transgressions. He
[1:32:55] was bruised for our iniquities. The
[1:32:57] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:32:59] and with his stripes we were healed. He
[1:33:01] said, "Never a man died like that man.
[1:33:05] He suffered until the blood and water
[1:33:07] separated in his body and drops of blood
[1:33:10] dropped out of his brow before his
[1:33:12] death." Just the thought of the
[1:33:15] agony separated and made him sweat
[1:33:20] blood. He says, "When we look at Christ,
[1:33:22] do you see the penalty? the only one,
[1:33:24] God himself made flesh, God coming down
[1:33:27] to the earth and took on him the sin of
[1:33:29] all of us. And the judgment and wrath of
[1:33:32] Almighty God was poured out upon his
[1:33:34] body and there it was riven at the
[1:33:36] cross. He says that's the real judgment.
[1:33:39] He tread the wine press of wrath of God
[1:33:41] alone. Then he says
[1:33:43] alone he walked the road alone. He died
[1:33:48] with not no help from an angel, from a
[1:33:50] man, from his church, from his mother,
[1:33:52] from his brethren, from his father. He
[1:33:54] was forsaken by God, man, and nature. He
[1:33:57] died alone to show us that even nature
[1:34:00] itself can't help us in the hour of
[1:34:02] death. He says there's no friend, no
[1:34:04] priest, no pope, no pastor. It's death.
[1:34:07] He says, but there was one that took it
[1:34:09] for us. He says that was the penalty. He
[1:34:12] died until the earth got ashamed of
[1:34:14] itself. He died till the stars got
[1:34:16] ashamed. He suffered until the sun
[1:34:18] wouldn't shine. He suffered till the
[1:34:20] moon turned off its lights. He suffered
[1:34:23] till even the elements of the earth were
[1:34:25] so black and dark until it was midnight.
[1:34:27] So dark you could feel it. He said, "No
[1:34:30] one's ever suffered like that or could
[1:34:32] suffer like that. There's no mortal
[1:34:34] could go through it." But he suffered
[1:34:36] through it. God laid upon him the
[1:34:39] iniquity of us all and passed its
[1:34:41] judgments upon him. And he tried the
[1:34:43] wine press of the wrath of God alone
[1:34:45] with no help.
[1:34:46] He said there was nothing to help him.
[1:34:50] That's why John was weeping was there
[1:34:52] was nothing to help him. John there was
[1:34:55] nothing to help humanity. And now one
[1:34:57] man has to come alone with no help. No
[1:35:01] help. He died
[1:35:04] alone. He died a man. He died a
[1:35:08] sinner. He says God placed the penalty.
[1:35:12] Everything was under that penalty and
[1:35:14] nothing could help him because we're all
[1:35:15] guilty. There's no high priest could
[1:35:17] have come helped him. There was nothing
[1:35:19] could help him. No pope, no angel.
[1:35:21] Everyone stood back and watched it. He
[1:35:23] said that was the greatest moment that
[1:35:25] was ever in the history of the world. He
[1:35:27] died until there was not one drop of
[1:35:31] life left in
[1:35:33] him. He said he became like the brass
[1:35:36] serpent just a crystallized ornament
[1:35:39] hanging on the cross.
[1:35:44] Every bit of life had to come out
[1:35:46] because every bit of life had to go
[1:35:48] someplace else.
[1:35:51] Hallelujah. He says he died till there
[1:35:53] was not one drop of life in
[1:35:58] him. You know, when I was looking at
[1:36:01] this
[1:36:02] scene of Calvary and the whipping
[1:36:06] post, I debated whether to share this
[1:36:09] photo I'm about to share.
[1:36:11] But if we're honest, this is nothing
[1:36:13] compared to the reality that there
[1:36:15] was. That's from that movie, The Passion
[1:36:18] of the Christ. And that's the whipping
[1:36:19] post after they've dragged him away to
[1:36:21] the
[1:36:23] left. That's not half of what would have
[1:36:26] been there because they ripped him
[1:36:30] apart. They tore the flesh off of his
[1:36:34] body so you could see his skeleton
[1:36:35] beneath it. David said, "My bones, my
[1:36:38] bones, they stare at me." That's not his
[1:36:41] hands, church. That's his body that was
[1:36:44] ripped apart by these
[1:36:46] catinetails. A whip with metal hooks
[1:36:49] embedded in it to rip the flesh
[1:36:52] off. That just shows
[1:36:54] blood. That's nothing. That's nothing
[1:36:59] compared to what that would have looked
[1:37:00] like after they finished with
[1:37:03] him. They literally tore his body apart.
[1:37:08] Remember, God tore the veil of the Holy
[1:37:10] of Holies. That was the entrance to God.
[1:37:14] But he tore apart the veil of Christ as
[1:37:16] well. He destroyed it. He He obliterated
[1:37:20] it. There was nothing left. The
[1:37:23] scripture says his face did not even
[1:37:25] resemble that of a man
[1:37:26] anymore. They took those thorns and they
[1:37:29] pressed him into his head. They punched
[1:37:31] him. They spat on him. They pulled his
[1:37:34] beard
[1:37:35] out. Even in that perfect body, he was
[1:37:38] too weak to carry the cross at the
[1:37:44] end. This is nothing compared to the
[1:37:47] reality. We're not just talking though
[1:37:50] physical
[1:37:53] pain, mental
[1:37:56] anguish. We're talking about a man that
[1:37:58] had the fullness of God inside of him.
[1:38:02] And in the garden of Gethsemane, when he
[1:38:04] drank from that cup, the spirit of God
[1:38:06] left him and the sins of the world came
[1:38:09] on him in that
[1:38:10] moment. We're talking about an assault
[1:38:13] on body, soul, and
[1:38:17] spirit, completely covered by the filth
[1:38:22] of
[1:38:23] humanity. He died a
[1:38:25] man. He died a
[1:38:28] sinner. So that at the end he said, "My
[1:38:31] God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[1:38:35] me?" Church, we're not talking he took a
[1:38:38] beating. He took total separation from
[1:38:42] God with the sins of the world on his
[1:38:47] shoulders. You know how bad you feel if
[1:38:49] you're a believer and you do something
[1:38:50] you know you really ought not to have
[1:38:53] done? Take that and multiply it by the
[1:38:56] 100red billion people that have existed
[1:38:58] so far.
[1:38:59] in a moment separated from God and those
[1:39:03] sins drop on you like
[1:39:06] that. I don't even think I could
[1:39:09] walk. I'd be
[1:39:11] overwhelmed. And yet he walked and he
[1:39:15] held himself to that whipping post. He
[1:39:19] held his mouth
[1:39:21] closed as they lied and lied and
[1:39:26] lied. As they challenged him, as they
[1:39:29] harassed him, as they beat
[1:39:32] him like a lamb led to the slaughter, he
[1:39:35] was dumb. He kept his mouth
[1:39:39] shut. It's a total changing of places.
[1:39:42] Remember I said John wept cuz he had to
[1:39:46] get to the other side and he couldn't
[1:39:47] get there. Somebody had to come over
[1:39:49] here. And this is what it looks
[1:39:52] like. This is what it looks like when
[1:39:54] somebody takes our
[1:39:56] place. He had been the habitation of God
[1:39:59] for three and a half years in perfect
[1:40:02] unity. The fullness of God inside of
[1:40:05] him. And in a moment he lost that unity.
[1:40:08] And he took your place and he took my
[1:40:10] place. No wonder he thought he'd been
[1:40:13] forsaken. His entire being, body, soul,
[1:40:16] and spirit under the wrath of God. Why
[1:40:19] would he do
[1:40:20] it? Why would he do
[1:40:26] it? We think we
[1:40:29] love. We think we
[1:40:32] sacrifice. Why would he do something
[1:40:34] like this? Willingly. Not forced.
[1:40:41] willingly. Why would he allow himself to
[1:40:43] be separated from unity with
[1:40:46] God? That's what Adam
[1:40:49] had. And now the son of God comes back a
[1:40:52] second time
[1:40:53] now. Perfect unity. And he says, "I'll
[1:40:57] give it
[1:40:58] up." Why?
[1:41:02] Paul said in Hebrews, "Looking unto
[1:41:03] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[1:41:05] faith, who for the joy that was set
[1:41:08] before him endured the cross." Remember
[1:41:11] we said, "Weeping may endure for the
[1:41:13] night, but joy comes in the
[1:41:17] morning." Says, "For the joy that was
[1:41:19] set before him, he endured the cross,
[1:41:21] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:41:23] the right hand of the throne of God."
[1:41:25] What is it? He saw that there was joy
[1:41:27] coming in the morning. There was going
[1:41:29] to be a night of pain. There was going
[1:41:31] to be a night of suffering. There was
[1:41:32] going to be a night of weeping. But
[1:41:33] there was something at the end that was
[1:41:36] worth more than what he was going to
[1:41:38] pay. You know, we we look for good
[1:41:42] deals where we can pay less to get
[1:41:45] more. That's what the scripture says is
[1:41:48] that the price that he paid was less
[1:41:51] than the value that he got out of it. It
[1:41:53] says he despised the
[1:41:56] shame. You know what that means? It
[1:41:59] means he looked at the shame and he
[1:42:01] looked at the joy and he said the joy is
[1:42:04] greater than the shame. This is a man
[1:42:06] that was
[1:42:08] beaten, that was stripped
[1:42:13] naked, that went and gave his life on a
[1:42:16] cross. And all of that compared to the
[1:42:19] joy, he says it's not even worth talking
[1:42:21] about today. We'd say that's what I
[1:42:24] think about that. He spit on the shame.
[1:42:27] He said, "Shame, you're not even worth
[1:42:30] thinking
[1:42:31] about compared to what's at the
[1:42:37] end, church." What's he compar What's he
[1:42:40] comparing to? What's he comparing shame
[1:42:43] to?
[1:42:45] You. You're the
[1:42:47] joy. He's saying, "Barishel, when I look
[1:42:50] at you and I look at being naked and
[1:42:52] being stripped and being beaten and
[1:42:55] being laughed at and being mocked,
[1:42:57] you're worth more to
[1:42:59] me." Sister Lydia, he said, Lydia, her
[1:43:04] value compared to
[1:43:06] this, I'll take
[1:43:08] her. I'll take her 10 times over.
[1:43:16] We sang that song at the beginning of
[1:43:18] service when he was on the cross. I was
[1:43:21] on his mind. The joy that he saw was you
[1:43:24] and I waiting for him at the end of
[1:43:26] this. And he held himself there
[1:43:29] willingly. Your value is more than
[1:43:32] 10,000
[1:43:37] worlds. Does he love you?
[1:43:41] He loves
[1:43:43] you that he would endure this sort of
[1:43:45] thing for
[1:43:47] us. What did he see? It says he saw joy.
[1:43:51] Did he see it there? Could he see it
[1:43:52] with his eyes? Church, could he touch
[1:43:55] it? Could it comfort him as he was going
[1:43:57] through
[1:43:58] this? No. All he saw were people caught
[1:44:02] up in
[1:44:04] themselves. People that rejected him.
[1:44:06] People that turned away. People that
[1:44:08] despised him. All he could see was
[1:44:11] broken humanity with his physical
[1:44:15] eyes,
[1:44:21] despised. Nothing there was joyous to
[1:44:25] him. But remember church, he was the
[1:44:27] word made
[1:44:29] flesh. His joy was not in what he could
[1:44:32] see. His joy is what he knew in the
[1:44:34] word. So he wasn't looking to the
[1:44:37] circumstance. See, so often we're
[1:44:39] looking for the circumstance to change
[1:44:41] uses from weeping to joy. But you can go
[1:44:44] through that night of weeping with a
[1:44:45] different
[1:44:46] attitude. If you know what's coming in
[1:44:48] on the other
[1:44:50] side, it'll change our attitude. Amen.
[1:44:54] It was his personal
[1:44:56] joy to know that he was going to be
[1:44:58] raised. He had already
[1:45:01] testified this body's going to come up.
[1:45:03] Like Jonah was in the belly of a whale
[1:45:04] three days, so will the son of man. He
[1:45:06] says, "If you destroy this temple, I'll
[1:45:08] raise it up again." He had already
[1:45:10] testified that he was going to be
[1:45:12] raised. That was his personal victory.
[1:45:15] And that was a joy for him. That was a
[1:45:18] joy for him to know the victory that he
[1:45:20] had. Amen. That's why he voluntarily
[1:45:22] gave himself. He knew what was coming.
[1:45:24] But there was more to it than just him.
[1:45:27] And if we go back to Isaiah 53, we read
[1:45:29] the first 10 or nine and a half verses.
[1:45:32] But if we go and we finish it out, then
[1:45:34] we see it says, "Yet it pleased the Lord
[1:45:36] to bruise him. He hath put him to
[1:45:38] grief." And but then it says, "When
[1:45:40] that's all done, when thou shalt make
[1:45:42] his soul an offering for sin, he shall
[1:45:45] see his seed, he shall prolong his days,
[1:45:49] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:45:51] prosper in his hand."
[1:45:53] The Amplified says, "Yet the Lord was
[1:45:55] willing to crush him, causing him to
[1:45:57] suffer. If he will give himself as a
[1:46:00] guilt offering, an atonement for sin, he
[1:46:03] shall see something, his spiritual
[1:46:06] offspring. He shall prolong his
[1:46:09] days, and the will, the good pleasure of
[1:46:12] the Lord shall succeed and prosper in
[1:46:16] his hands." When he was on the cross, I
[1:46:17] was on his mind. He went to his death
[1:46:20] with Isaiah 53 in his mind that said,
[1:46:23] "Listen, it's not just one, but except
[1:46:25] the corn of wheat fall into the ground
[1:46:27] and
[1:46:28] die, they can't have the rest of it." So
[1:46:32] he's looking at Isaiah 53:10. He says,
[1:46:34] "When I go down, then I'm going to see a
[1:46:36] seed that comes out of this. I'm going
[1:46:37] to see an offspring that comes up with
[1:46:39] me." That's the joy. That's the victory
[1:46:42] that he was looking at. Why? The word
[1:46:44] told him. Everything in front of him
[1:46:47] screamed, "You'll never see it." His own
[1:46:50] had abandoned him. Those that said,
[1:46:53] "I'll never leave you. I'll give my
[1:46:55] life. I'll go to prison." All
[1:46:57] gone. But the word said, "They're
[1:47:00] coming. And if you'll go down, they'll
[1:47:02] come up with
[1:47:03] you." And he did that. And he died with
[1:47:06] this in the forefront of his mind.
[1:47:09] Brother Brandham said that the church is
[1:47:11] his victory.
[1:47:13] It's not just him that rose, but it's a
[1:47:15] church that rises in victory with him.
[1:47:17] Amen. And he could see us waiting at the
[1:47:19] finish line. Bone of his bone, flesh of
[1:47:21] his flesh, spirit of his spirit. And
[1:47:24] that's the joy that he held in front of
[1:47:27] him. The scripture says that he says,
[1:47:29] "Husbands, love your wives even as
[1:47:31] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:47:35] his life for it." He saw what was
[1:47:37] waiting at the end. He saw a bride
[1:47:39] without spot or wrinkle redeemed back to
[1:47:41] her position with him. Not just in
[1:47:44] relationship but in
[1:47:47] fellowship. That's what he died for. His
[1:47:50] love for you. His love for you is what
[1:47:53] held him at that cross, church. And he
[1:47:55] believed the word enough to lay his life
[1:47:57] down. He put his body on the line. He
[1:48:00] put his soul on the line. He put his
[1:48:02] spirit on the line. And he said,
[1:48:03] "Father, into thy hands I commend my
[1:48:05] spirit." And he rested on the
[1:48:09] word. He rested that the promise of the
[1:48:11] word would come forth if he would lay
[1:48:13] down his life willingly. Church, God's
[1:48:16] not asking us to do anything he hasn't
[1:48:17] done
[1:48:18] himself. He laid his life down. He
[1:48:21] believed his own word. He rested on his
[1:48:23] own word. He acted on his own word. He
[1:48:26] had faith in his own word. And then he
[1:48:28] gave himself over completely to it.
[1:48:32] He says, "He shall see the travail of
[1:48:34] his soul and shall be satisfied. And by
[1:48:38] his knowledge shall my righteous servant
[1:48:40] justify many for he shall bear their
[1:48:42] iniquities." Church, it's a good thing
[1:48:44] when God's satisfied. You know, we think
[1:48:46] we're satisfied. And then what happens?
[1:48:49] The satisfaction fades. Why? Because
[1:48:51] much craves more. This flesh is never
[1:48:54] satisfied. But when God is satisfied,
[1:48:56] that means he's full and he's never
[1:48:58] going to need it again. And here the
[1:49:01] wrath of God was satisfied. Which means
[1:49:03] he can never turn it on you
[1:49:05] again. It's done. It's finished.
[1:49:09] Remember Calvary settled the sin
[1:49:11] question forever. The wrath of God
[1:49:13] cannot fall on the bride. She's already
[1:49:15] been judged in him. Now what you can get
[1:49:18] is
[1:49:19] chastisement. And that's to correct your
[1:49:21] behavior. That's not judgment. That's
[1:49:24] correction because he loves
[1:49:26] us. Amen.
[1:49:28] But God's requirement have been met in
[1:49:31] Christ. As we read in Psalms 30, his
[1:49:34] anger endures but a moment. In his favor
[1:49:37] is life and weeping may endure for a
[1:49:39] night, but joy cometh in the morning. It
[1:49:41] says, "For his anger endures but a
[1:49:44] moment." That moment means an instant, a
[1:49:46] wink of an eye. It's a fleeting time.
[1:49:49] Then it says, "Weeping may endure for a
[1:49:51] night." I I had to laugh a bit at this
[1:49:53] when I read it. It says it stays
[1:49:55] overnight in your
[1:49:57] house like an unwelcome
[1:50:00] guest. Now, I don't know if you've ever
[1:50:02] had an unwelcome guest, but the most
[1:50:04] wonderful thing about an unwelcome guest
[1:50:06] is when they leave. And if you know
[1:50:09] they're leaving, it takes you through
[1:50:11] the
[1:50:13] night. What's he saying? He's saying,
[1:50:16] "Listen, what you go through go through,
[1:50:19] it's just for a moment. If you can only
[1:50:22] see it the way God sees it, it's just
[1:50:24] for a
[1:50:25] moment. The hard times we go through,
[1:50:27] it's just for a moment. But in the
[1:50:30] morning, it'll leave like the unwelcome
[1:50:34] guest. And joy
[1:50:37] comes. What is a moment compared to
[1:50:41] eternity? We get 70, 80 years. Maybe we
[1:50:44] get 90 these
[1:50:47] days. Compared to
[1:50:49] eternity, it's
[1:50:51] nothing. But boy, when we're going
[1:50:53] through
[1:50:54] it, Satan knows how to take a moment and
[1:50:58] turn it into a
[1:51:00] year. Isn't that right, Brother
[1:51:03] Grant? It seems never
[1:51:06] ending. Can you imagine Christ and
[1:51:09] everything in this world, all the sin
[1:51:11] and the pain and the suffering amplified
[1:51:12] into that body? In a moment, I'm sure it
[1:51:15] felt like
[1:51:16] eternity. You know, when you're going
[1:51:18] through something really painful, maybe
[1:51:19] you're at a a doctor getting a
[1:51:21] procedure, you know, when you go and you
[1:51:23] you go to a dentist and they've got to
[1:51:24] put the needles in your mouth to deaden
[1:51:26] you. Doesn't that moment seem to last a
[1:51:28] while? That sharp shooting pain before
[1:51:31] it goes numb and you're
[1:51:35] go trying to get through it. It only
[1:51:38] lasts about five or six seconds, but
[1:51:40] those five or six seconds feel like an
[1:51:42] hour because the pain is just so sharp
[1:51:46] and you can't get away from it. And you
[1:51:48] know, you have to endure it to get to
[1:51:50] the blissful numbing that comes at the
[1:51:52] end of
[1:51:56] it. In the big picture, church, this is
[1:51:58] just a
[1:52:00] moment, but sometimes it feels like an
[1:52:03] eternity. And when we feel it's getting
[1:52:06] into an eternal
[1:52:08] state, it's usually because we've lost
[1:52:11] the eternal
[1:52:13] view. We haven't looked at what the word
[1:52:15] says about it. We haven't looked for the
[1:52:17] joy that comes in the morning because
[1:52:18] we're so caught up in the weeping that
[1:52:20] endures for a
[1:52:21] night. This hardship passes and what
[1:52:25] comes afterwards, church, is so great,
[1:52:28] we won't remember it. Scripture says
[1:52:30] he's going to wipe every tear from our
[1:52:31] eye. There'll be no memory.
[1:52:34] Hallelujah. No memory of all those
[1:52:35] exams, brother
[1:52:37] Garfield. Of all those family
[1:52:41] issues, of all those nights wondering
[1:52:43] what's going to
[1:52:45] happen, of all those frustrations and
[1:52:50] frustrations, broken
[1:52:52] fellowship, broken
[1:52:54] lives, broken
[1:52:58] pieces, failed expectations. It'll all
[1:53:01] be gone in a moment. They say that a
[1:53:04] mother quickly forgets, not immediately,
[1:53:07] but quickly forgets the pain of
[1:53:09] childbirth when she starts to hold that
[1:53:11] baby. Now, I can't say for sure. I think
[1:53:13] it hurts for a while after that, but the
[1:53:16] memory of the pain goes
[1:53:18] away because they're caught up in the
[1:53:20] life that's there afterwards. It's the
[1:53:22] joy that comes afterwards. It amazes me.
[1:53:25] I've been at the birth of all of my
[1:53:28] children and it amazes me how quickly
[1:53:31] that mother transitions from pain to
[1:53:34] taking care and the love of that child
[1:53:35] and it overwhelms them and that's all
[1:53:38] they care about. Let me have my baby.
[1:53:40] Let me hold my baby. Let me take care of
[1:53:42] my baby. Let me keep my baby warm. Let
[1:53:44] me feed my baby. And all the pain just
[1:53:46] goes out. That's what it's supposed to
[1:53:49] be like.
[1:53:52] He says,
[1:53:53] "Therefore," now this is God prophesying
[1:53:56] now forward from the crucifixion,
[1:53:58] forward from his resurrection. He says,
[1:53:59] "Therefore will I divide him a portion
[1:54:02] with the great, and he shall divide the
[1:54:04] spoil with the strong, because he hath
[1:54:07] poured out his soul unto death, and he
[1:54:10] was numbered with the transgressors, and
[1:54:12] he bear the sin of many, and made
[1:54:15] intercession for the transgressors."
[1:54:18] It was but a moment about 15 hours they
[1:54:21] say from the time he was arrested to the
[1:54:24] time that he
[1:54:25] died. Then he had about 40 hours of
[1:54:27] death if we want to call it that way and
[1:54:29] then he rose from that again. But on the
[1:54:32] basis of this scripture there's others I
[1:54:34] know but on the basis of what the word
[1:54:37] said about him Christ laid down his
[1:54:40] life. It said he would inherit a great
[1:54:42] portion and there be others that would
[1:54:44] inherit it with him. It wasn't selfish.
[1:54:48] He already had
[1:54:50] it. But now he's got to come claim you
[1:54:53] and I cuz he didn't want it alone. He
[1:54:56] didn't want it alone. So he comes down
[1:54:58] and he lays down his life. Amen. That
[1:55:01] was his own bride. That was souls that
[1:55:02] were lost. It would seem souls not yet
[1:55:05] born. Died for people that were not yet
[1:55:08] come into reality in this earth. He laid
[1:55:11] down his life for every single one of
[1:55:13] them.
[1:55:15] I want to close with this one thought
[1:55:18] this evening. We go back to Revelation
[1:55:20] 5. John's weeping and weeping and
[1:55:24] weeping. Said, "And one of the elders
[1:55:26] saith unto
[1:55:28] me, weep not. Stop crying, John. The
[1:55:32] lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[1:55:35] David, had prevailed to open the book
[1:55:38] and to loose the seven seals thereof."
[1:55:41] He says, ' And I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:55:43] midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:55:45] beasts, and in the midst of the elders,
[1:55:46] stood a lamb as it had been slain,
[1:55:49] having seven or horns and seven eyes,
[1:55:52] which are the seven spirits of God, sent
[1:55:54] forth unto all the earth. He said,
[1:55:57] "Don't cry, John. The lion of the tribe
[1:56:00] of Judah has
[1:56:02] prevailed." That word prevail means he's
[1:56:04] overcome. He's conquered. He's gained
[1:56:07] the victory.
[1:56:09] But when you look at what prevailing
[1:56:10] means in the life of Christ, it's not
[1:56:13] quite we would
[1:56:14] expect because we talk about overcoming
[1:56:17] power a lot. The seven church ages has a
[1:56:20] group of people in every age that
[1:56:22] overcome. And we look at it as power. We
[1:56:25] look at as authority, as authority, but
[1:56:27] they overcome by the life that they
[1:56:29] live. And it's not them that lives, but
[1:56:32] it's Christ that lives in them. But when
[1:56:34] we look at Christ and his overcoming,
[1:56:36] his prevailing, you'll notice that it
[1:56:38] says that he overcame sin every day. And
[1:56:41] that's what made him
[1:56:43] worthy. But he did not prevail until he
[1:56:46] took care of your sins as well. He was
[1:56:49] worthy because he never sinned. But he
[1:56:51] overcame when he took on your sins. He
[1:56:54] overcame when he took your place. His
[1:56:57] prevailing was to take your place,
[1:56:59] church. His victory was taking your
[1:57:05] place. What did his prevailing look
[1:57:08] like? Being
[1:57:09] torn
[1:57:12] apart. Weeping, crying, groaning in
[1:57:17] agony. So beat till he didn't look like
[1:57:19] a man. Till every ounce of blood dropped
[1:57:22] out of his body. That's what his
[1:57:25] prevailing looked
[1:57:27] like. His nature is a
[1:57:31] lion. And he laid aside his
[1:57:35] nature to become a
[1:57:38] lamb. And he prevailed by keeping his
[1:57:41] mouth
[1:57:43] shut rather than speaking the word out.
[1:57:47] He laid down his very
[1:57:49] nature, his conquering, ruling,
[1:57:53] authoritarian nature, and he became meek
[1:57:56] and
[1:57:57] mild to prevail where you and I couldn't
[1:58:00] do
[1:58:01] it.
[1:58:03] His night of
[1:58:05] sorrow, his night of
[1:58:08] weeping, his enduring through that
[1:58:12] night is what helps us get that book in
[1:58:16] our possession again. And you go back
[1:58:18] and we're not going to touch on it
[1:58:19] tonight. We're going to close
[1:58:21] here. You look at this. When they said
[1:58:24] this, John goes from a weeping prophet
[1:58:28] to a shouting prophet.
[1:58:31] Why? Cuz somebody prevailed where I
[1:58:34] couldn't prevail. Cuz somebody overcame
[1:58:36] where I couldn't overcome. Cuz somebody
[1:58:39] sacrificed in a way that I could never
[1:58:41] sacrifice. And John saw that book and he
[1:58:43] saw somebody come and take the book and
[1:58:47] loos the seals. Now he didn't start
[1:58:48] reading it, but he loosed the seals. And
[1:58:51] that meant redemption was coming. Full
[1:58:54] redemption was coming. And that's when
[1:58:57] John started to
[1:58:59] praise. Weeping had turned to joy in the
[1:59:03] morning. God bless you. The musicians
[1:59:06] would
[1:59:07] come. The brothers can start to get
[1:59:10] ready for
[1:59:11] communion. Why is John
[1:59:14] shouting? Cuz that bridge from Earth to
[1:59:16] the moon has just been
[1:59:18] built. That thing that nobody could do.
[1:59:21] Let's stand if we would. That thing that
[1:59:23] nobody could do, it's been done.
[1:59:26] Can you imagine if you knew we needed
[1:59:28] that bridge to the moon and you woke up
[1:59:30] one morning and the bridge was there?
[1:59:33] What would you do? You'd say, "We're
[1:59:35] saved. We're saved. Everyone come look.
[1:59:38] We're
[1:59:38] saved." You talk about a worship
[1:59:41] service. You talk about a a
[1:59:44] jubilee. That's what we have tonight is
[1:59:47] we have a bridge that's made between God
[1:59:49] and man. Back to our original condition.
[1:59:53] back to our relig our original
[1:59:55] relationship. Back to our original
[1:59:57] fellowship, back to our original
[1:59:59] authority and back to our original
[2:00:02] nature. All of it restore
[2:00:06] back. But the thing is, it wasn't just
[2:00:08] when he died. He has to rise
[2:00:11] again. And that's what we'll go into on
[2:00:14] Sunday, Lord willing. That's the joy in
[2:00:15] the morning. Because if he only
[2:00:18] died, the price is paid. But we still be
[2:00:21] of all men most miserable. But when he
[2:00:23] rose, what did he do? He proved the
[2:00:26] power of the spirit of God for the
[2:00:27] church of Christ so that she could have
[2:00:30] the same effect in their life that he
[2:00:32] had in his. Amen. God bless you. Let's
[2:00:35] bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:00:39] Father, Lord, how wonderful it
[2:00:42] is, Lord, to think of the price that you
[2:00:47] paid, Lord, to see how you stepped out
[2:00:49] of
[2:00:50] glory, Lord. You stepped out of
[2:00:53] rulership. You stepped out of perfection
[2:00:55] and holiness and righteousness, Lord.
[2:00:57] And you came down and you became us so
[2:00:59] that we could become
[2:01:01] you, Lord. We can never thank you
[2:01:03] enough.
[2:01:05] We can never praise you
[2:01:07] enough. But Lord, I pray that in the
[2:01:09] little things that we do with this life,
[2:01:12] Lord, that it'd be a pleasing sacrifice
[2:01:14] to you to give thanks for all that
[2:01:16] you've done, Lord
[2:01:17] God. Lord, when I think about what that
[2:01:20] night must have
[2:01:22] been, Lord, I cannot
[2:01:25] imagine. Lord, I can't imagine holding
[2:01:28] myself to a whipping post while they
[2:01:30] tear me
[2:01:33] apart, Lord. And in it, not just to
[2:01:36] endure it, Lord, but to have a right
[2:01:38] attitude throughout
[2:01:39] it, Lord. What love it is that kept you
[2:01:43] there, Lord. We are unworthy of it
[2:01:45] tonight. But Lord, we are so thankful
[2:01:48] for the free gift you gave us. Lord, let
[2:01:51] our lives, Lord, reflect that love gift
[2:01:53] you gave.
[2:01:55] Lord, as we thank you for your sacrifice
[2:01:57] tonight, Lord, as we commemorate, Lord,
[2:02:00] your death tonight and the price that
[2:02:01] was paid, the blood that was shed so
[2:02:03] that we could go
[2:02:05] free. Lord, I pray you help us never
[2:02:07] forget it day by
[2:02:09] day. Lord, let us testify to all that we
[2:02:12] see that there's a way that's been made
[2:02:14] back, Lord, through the shed blood of
[2:02:16] Calvary. Lord, we thank you. Lord, we
[2:02:19] love you. Lord, we can't say it enough,
[2:02:22] Lord. how much we appreciate what you
[2:02:25] did. But Lord, we'll do our
[2:02:28] best. Thank you, Lord, for your
[2:02:30] goodness, Lord, for your longsuffering.
[2:02:33] Lord, thank you for power to live an
[2:02:36] overcoming
[2:02:37] life. Lord, that you sent Lord, you
[2:02:40] didn't just die, but you rose again and
[2:02:41] you sent that same spirit right back
[2:02:43] into your bride, Lord, to raise her up
[2:02:45] into heavenly places. Lord, bless us
[2:02:47] now. We pray, Lord, as we go into this
[2:02:50] communion service in Jesus Christ's
[2:02:51] name.
[2:02:57] Amen. We know that song, Worthy, the
[2:03:00] Lamb That Was Slain. It's an older hymn,
[2:03:05] 303. Just take pull it up there
[2:03:10] quickly.
[2:03:16] 303. Hear the cries of the shackled. Do
[2:03:19] we know that? Yes. There we go.
[2:03:24] Hear
[2:03:26] the Can you start for
[2:03:30] me? Hear
[2:03:35] the
[2:03:43] Yes. Snow
[2:03:46] key. See? No, that's not it, is it?
[2:03:53] From the
[2:03:55] onset
[2:03:57] of for the chains of defeat, there's no
[2:04:07] key. See the
[2:04:09] tears of the
[2:04:13] broken, the cries of the slaves.
[2:04:19] Is there no
[2:04:21] one worthy to set us
[2:04:28] free? Then the
[2:04:32] Christ is
[2:04:34] still as the
[2:04:37] chorus rings
[2:04:40] out. Oh, the
[2:04:43] shackle release from their chain.
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:51] And
[2:04:54] thousands of
[2:04:56] voices are

[2:05:02] song. Oh,
[2:05:05] worthy the lamb that was slain.
[2:05:13] Oh

[2:05:23] worthy. Oh

[2:06:17] hands. will fall
[2:06:20] down before
[2:06:23] him,
[2:06:25] joining the song.
[2:06:29] Oh

[2:06:33] worthy the
[2:06:38] lamb. Oh
[2:06:44] worthy,
[2:06:49] worthy,
[2:06:52] worthy. In the land that was
[2:07:00] slain. Oh,
