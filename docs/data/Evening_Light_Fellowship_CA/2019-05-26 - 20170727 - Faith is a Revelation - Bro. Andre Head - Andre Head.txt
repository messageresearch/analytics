want to we want to thank rather Jerell us for giving us this opportunity to come and be with you and and you know I'm just a little bit nervous I always get nervous when I come out but how I enjoyed the specials tonight and singing from your heart there I remember I think it's our first year here my wife and I our first year we got to meet your wonderful pastor and and also our precious brother their coffee and we didn't have time on that trip to come and visit you and then last year we thought maybe there would be time and I just want to be honest with you my wife and I kind of got under the radar and actually visited st. John's here and and had a good time we went to the different sites there and we we just had a great time and then this year well last year we talked to brother Geralyn said well Jerry we'd love to come we understand there's a lovely group there in st. John's and and I'm getting to see that group tonight and then of course after I went back home and just fellowship in with my dear beau somebody there brother Chad who I loved dearly and him telling me said brother Andre you know we've moved out to st. John and I'm just feeling just so wonderful my family we feel that we've kind of fit into the believers there and so I wanted this time to come and to be with you and so you know you always want to be in God's time I can tell you and you know these things the last thing we want to do is get ahead of the Lord and sometimes we might move slow and maybe he has to put a little fire under us but I would rather him put fire under me than to get ahead of and so we we just thank the Lord we I think it's been several weeks ago I believe it and now if I get the names mixed up y'all have mercy on me but I believe it was brother Mark and his wife they were down and and we had just a wonderful time of fellowship and and so we were trying to set up some dates to come down and be with you and we the brother said ok we'll go back and talk to the pastor and see if these days will be sufficient for us and so we we had a wonderful time there with him and his wife I tell you what she has such a lovely voice and just a just a sweet spirit and we just had a a wonderful time and I thought my maybe when I go st. John I'm just gonna listen to them all just one by one and just all those angelic voices just just singing the praise of the Lord and I understand tomorrow we'll be in fellowship so we look forward to that and then just this last past weekend and just Colombo God bless you too and your family yeah and just this last weekend we brother Paul and his wife were there and what a fine family and brother Matthew and his wife was there also and because we had some other activities we just kind of got to shake their hand and tell him God blessed them and said hey I believe we're going to be down with you so we we just we appreciate those fine families they're appreciate the little fellowship that we got then but it was good for them and and so here we are by God's grace we when we were coming down I thought well it's a good drive down to st. John's but then brother Karsan he got to talking to me say you know well we if we take off this time and I was thinking well is he gonna I'm not gonna follow him down or what and then he said no no no no brother I'm gonna drive you down so I said well praise the Lord that's gonna be fine and so my wife and I we're thankful that Bella Carlson and his wife they drove us down had a good trip coming down we stopped and visited one of the communities there and it was just very lovely there you I tell you my wife and I this is our third year to visit your Providence and it's Newfoundland is so beautiful we've we last year we were out and grouse mourn and my wife and I we hiked so we were able to hike some trails and go through the boat ride and and just everywhere you go you just you see a lovely place and the shoreline the rivers and the lakes you think well I don't believe I can see any better and then you see another part and it just and so I tell you what God he really put his finger print here on this Providence I mean all of Canada is beautiful you understand brother branham he said in his message I if you want the message I get it to you he said that the most beautiful place in the world to him was Banff and Jasper brother Brown said that was the most beautiful place in the whole earth to him and so when he said that you know as a believer you think man I got to get to Baffin Jasper then and so but I know that the Prophet he didn't have the opportunity we know that he flew into Gander flew out of there but I think the Ministerial Association of Pentecostal gentlemen who was in charge I don't even know whether to call him and gentleman or not but he would not have the prophet coming to Newfoundland but you know that did not stop the hand of the Lord because God knew that he had his seed here and nothing was going to stop that you see and so how beautiful it is to see the very purchase of his blood tonight see the great the great victory has here and new from it and so as as the pastor said we have one more service and Grand Falls we've been there for about a month just enjoying our time fellowship and the brothers there they send greetings to you all here they said well Andre please send our greetings and we do my wife and I we send our greetings from our pastor back in Irwin Tennessee brother Harvey Peterson and so they the church there since their greetings to you also and how thankful we are for that well I think I got all the announcements over but I wanted to get it right you know the first time you you you meet a part of God's body it's just a great blessing and you know you just don't want to kind of run out there and just start ministering you want to be able to enjoy the very Saints sister Betty god bless you yes god bless you I asked brother Jer I said how's your wife doing and I remember last year brother Geralyn and sister Betty they were visiting a brother jerilyn sister but there and so we we had a great time and in that time I really got to fellowship with your pastor and and I already stood understood a little bit about the website and how tremendous and how this has affected so many people all over the world the website there and the the great work that God has used your pastor in spreading the gospel and helping the Saints and I tell you what we we honor those things and we appreciate those things because they are honorable and so we we actually in that time when they were visiting brother and sister there and Grand Falls or Bishop Falls that was when I really got to meet your pastor in and his wife and really our spirits kind of just kind of metal together there I thought my the Bible says how can two walk together except they be agreed and of course we know it's the word that we're looking for we may enjoy other things in life but one thing about a believer they're going to come back to the common denomination in their lives and that is the word of the Lord and so to be able to hear and listen to your pastor I really enjoyed the fellowship and I thought well and brother Chad was praying said well if I get if the Lord brings us up to Newfoundland one more time which we did not have plans to come here we were supposed to be in the church there and and left them Guyana that the Lord is raised up and we're working with that church trying to get them established in the present day truth and and but the the leadership of the Lord brought us back here for his own good purpose so I thought well the Lord if it's your grace we'd like to get over the st. John so here we are this evening not going to keep you long but we're so thankful that we have this opportunity to sit at the Masters table to draw from that Holy Ghost and to see and see the reality of God's Word in our lives and I tell you what a blessed people you are and how the Great Holy Spirit the only revealer of the Divine Word of God has called you out in this hour because you have a part to play and as we said everyone has a part to play in this evening time the bride has a part to play the foolish virgin has a part to play the organizational world has a part to play Rome has a part to play the United States has a part to play Russia has a part to play Israel has a part to play we've all got a part to play here and Sen Tom and how thankful we are that the part that we have to play is to be the manifested victory of God for this hour and we're thankful that God has raised us up for that purpose to manifest his word that Holy Ghost manifesting that word in our lives speaking spirit and life in our lives and connecting with our heart drawing us by his word and revealing himself to us as he said the world will see me no more but you shall see me and the only way that we can see him is by the word and when the word becomes alive in our heart and that word begins to make itself manifest then we're seeing him you can't see God outside of his word because God and his word are inseparable and if a man says he knows God outside of his word he doesn't know God because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God in the word became flesh and we're thankful that the word is becoming flesh in our life and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have found out that we are a part of that word when before the foundation of the world and now our season our time has come to manifest that promised word for the hour blessed be the name of the Lord if you have your Bibles let's stand once more and we'll just go to the word now let's turn to Romans chapter 1 and we're going to read verse 16 and 17 I've been ministering on faith while I've been here and how we thank the Lord as he continues to open this word spiritual faith brother Branham said in the sealed book he says now it'll take those seven unknown thunders to bring rapturing faith to the bride and how thankful we are because and I'm not going to keep you standing alone we'll read the verse but in this hour that we lived in Satan that's put so much scarecrows on the word and so when you say seven thunder then they think you may be a part of the seven thunder virtual group or this group or that group but in spite of all of that there is a people that is having a seven Thunder revival by the Word of God being restored to them and they're not worried about the Scarecrow's because the only one that can keep the bride not only save you but keep you is the Holy Ghost you see we can't keep ourselves if we can keep yourself but in this hour the two spirits would be so close according to Matthew 24:24 that it would deceive even the very elected if it were possible but it's not possible but Satan because of falsehood and discrepancy he gets his perfect anointing in this endtime but God has brought a combat beast the great flying eagle the one that could discern the pale horse rider and called him and said this is death and hell falls then there is a discernment in the broad in this endtime that looks directly at the word and because she is the word in the Word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart then by that living word in you you will discern those two spirits and withstand that the spirit you see God said these things so you're going to do it because the C gene that he planted in your heart is growing up and he is drawing that by this great third pool the opening of the word then there has to come an opening of the word where the broad really catches the reality of the opening of those seals and then the speaking of the word follows those things and that's who you are you are that people and we're not afraid of that amen in Romans chapter 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek now when it says here that it is the power of God unto salvation that Brit that incorporates everything in your life salvation forgiveness faith everything Redemption everything is right there in that word salvation brother Brandon would say many times he said now he's Jehovah Jireh the Lord who provided and he says now if he is the Lord who has provided if he is Jehovah Jireh then he also has to be Jehovah Rapha I am the Lord that healeth all of thy diseases so not only is he but the seven compound redemptive names of Jehovah is in this salvation because God has connected himself to your earthly journey you see let's read verse 17 now and there will be seated he says now for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith so if God is going to be known he's going to be known only by revelation and faith is a revelation you know these things already but a revelation is something real it's not make-believe it's not what I've educated myself up to it's not that I read enough because these men like Peter that were unlearned men and yet when God came to them and revealed to them even before pentacles came to Peter and said Peter flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father has revealed this to you see then this is not well Peter learned or someone gave him an advice or he felt this this was the eternal God giving a direct movement of the Holy Ghost into Peter and Jesus said on this rock of Revelation I will build my church if he's still building his church if he's been building it from faith from Paul all the way up to the broad age then it has to be by divine revelation which is an act of God through the Holy Ghost to you and he's doing that so if God is going to be known he's going to be known he's going to be revealed from faith to faith he says now for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith and is as it is as it is written the just shall live by faith may the Lord at his blessings for the reading of his Holy Word you may be seated so if the Lord will give us strength we want to speak on faces of Revelation I want to read from the message works his faith Express brother Brown says now now faith is a revelation from God now faith is a revelation he says he has revealed it to you by His grace so to have faith it takes the grace of God you can't have faith without God giving you faith he's going to say that here he says it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon revelation he said now a Baptist minister told me not long ago he said I just can't accept revelation and I said then you cannot accept the Bible you cannot accept Christ because he is the revelation of God he's God revealed in flesh therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation able by faith no Bible written in those days by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that which of Cain which God testified he was righteous how by faith by faith by a revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice because it was revealed to him that it was wasn't fruit of the field it was blood and that's why some people can believe it and some can't believe it and some tried to make believe it he says in an audience of people where prayer line comes - you'll find they were all good people will say they there's some that's trying hard to believe it they're trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all and others it's just by grace that it's just given to them now there is the difference see that does it that's a revelation because faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first he says now I want to just stick on that just a moment because we we know so many scriptures that deals with faith the Bible says in Romans 10:17 that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God you see but not ever one that has audible can hear and have faith this is a predestinated people that can hear the word of God and something deep inside of them moves them and they said I believe this and not only that I believe that this is speaking to me personally because the faith personalized the gospel in your life it comes and it changes your life it changes your desires it makes you a new creation and all of these things come by hearing so there's something in the hearing of a believer because by this hearing the Holy Ghost begins to lead our lives maybe there was some brothers or sisters here before you got saved maybe you were out in the world and you live worldly but when the gospel came across your path things that you used to do by revelation conviction come on your heart and you said I won't do those things anymore that came by hearing but there had to be a ground that was cultivated by the Holy Ghost to receive that seed word because if not then we just got emotion or we just got caught up in the moment but we just got conviction you see but there's a people who that that they're not trying to get faith they have come to a very uh a lineage of faith and that's why I listen I don't want to get ahead of myself that's why we know that when Adam failed in the garden and he went after Eve and I have to say this you know these things already but because everything that Adam was and everything that Adam it comes from God because God said let us make man in our own image Adam was a byproduct of no one he was the direct creation of the very image of God he was a son of God he could not be deceived you see everything Adam had it come directly from God God was the umbilical cord to Adam you see so Adam his experience and when God told him Adam you named the creatures here Adam by revelation having the mind of God being so one with God that you could not separate God from Adam that's exactly right that's why God didn't say look Adam that Adam that's a lion right there so on look I asked you to name then that's all right here let me give you the boo here when you see the picture you just call out the names how he didn't do that when Adam said you're the Dove you're so meek and so clean so pure you're the Dove and you're a lamb and you're a lion he was watching their character and what they were displaying but even deeper than that these creatures that he named would become part of the very gospel of Jesus Christ because he would be the lion he would be the dog he would be the lamb so Adam went deeper than just naming animals he had the very long loss of God the very intentions the very desire of God was in him this is a great thing because we are the Bride of Christ this is a great so when Eve went out because all that was in God he poured into Adam see that's just like the threefold purpose all that God was he poured into Jesus Christ and so when we saw Christ we saw the father one day Philip said Lord show us the father and it will suffice us we'll be happy if you'll show us the father and he said Philip how long have I been with you and you haven't seen me he that hath seen me have seen the father because he wasn't the second person or the third person this was God himself the word in human flesh so when Eve went out because Christ is a savior and he carries the attribute of a savior because Christ would save his bride then all that Adam had from God was God a savior sure so Adam had the attribute of a savior in him so when Eve went out he had to go and save her because the attribute of a savior was in him listen now if the attribute of a savior and the attribute of God was an atom what will happen to a people that God would pour himself into would they not expressed God sure they would would they not do the works of God sure they will how thankful we are for these things this is not the Pentecostal age this is the broad age and we and you are the bride in the bride age you are the word in the word age and nothing is going to hinder and stop the faith of Jesus Christ in your heart you say hinder not hinder faith because faith has no hindrances remember brother Branham he talked about the sulfonation woman and a message called press evarin's and he said in that message that this woman had a daughter that was vexed with a devil and the woman said once she had heard that this great one had come and he was healing the people and because faith cometh by hearing she heard these things in her heart and faith rose up in her heart and said get to where he is at and your daughter would be made well and brother Brandon when he dramatizes it and the message pressive arrance he said that the woman said to her women friends said I'm going to go down and to this revival that they're having and they said sister you better not do that if you do that then we're going to kick you out of our sewing party you're going to be kicked out because that's a bunch of Holy Roller holy rollers she said I don't care about your sewing party I'm going my daughters vexed and so brother brother said he though she had hindrances faith has no hindrances because faith honors God and God on his faith you see so the Prophet said that here she was they said to her your husband he's a businessman and you know his business it's you know he'll lose his prestige and his contracting and you better in he'll divorce you he'll leave you and brother Brown she said she said well he leaves me or not I'm going then she went to her priest and he said now and brother Brown and he calls the woman he says I'm just gonna say her name's Lydia he said I hope there's no Lydia but if it is then good because I'm speaking positive of whoever this is Lydia he said then whoever Lydia was that night I'm sure she got blessed he said then Lydia who C went to her pass her priests and said you know my daughter's vexed with the devil and I know that this man he is the Christ and they said to her you know he said you've been in this church so many years and your your parents was in this church your papa and you know he was the godly old priest he said to her you know when your husband was unemployed who do you saying went down and helped him I was the one who went downhill and his church been helping you and your great-grandfather when he when he lost the land who went and stood in before the judge for he was no kind of reason at all said now if and you don't you know I'm I'm grateful so I'm father Solon's hope you know what this would do to my relationship with you and your family and she said are you finished yet because I'm going now it was a humanistic emotion that was drawing her faith was pulling her faith was bringing her into his presence what about your faith tonight anybody can say they believe the message of the hour anyone can say that but faith brother Brandon preached messes words his faith expressed then at the faith the holy faith of God is in you you will do the holy words of God and so she went and there he was the Lord Jesus and she as I said she was studying his approach how am I gonna get there all these people they're crying son of David and here she was a Greek of Gentile she had no representation you know these things you've read these many times in the mess she had no representation but she studied how can I see the people saying that son of David and there seems like he's giving them audience so she creeps other David have mercy upon me son of David have mercy upon me and the disciple looks at know what this Gentile saying summer day that they have no representation of some of David they Jim's out dogs this is a Greek woman so they said master master master so Jesus comes to and you know the story he said woman he says now woman you are of a different race you don't belong up here maybe he would have said woman you are of the black race and you don't belong here oh you prejudiced thing I'm going home I knew I shouldn't have come here in the first place but that's what he said you have a different race but faith had no hindrances faith knew its master and brother Brandon said faith agrees with the word so so he continues to ignore now you think in your own heart you come to get what you needed from Christ and then you get just because you get to wear his hat doesn't mean that you're going to get what you desire because without faith it is impossible to please God now you may have come out tonight with a need but just being at church will not answer that need only face direct faith can bring you into the presence of God and look right at the word and no matter what the hindrances are you're gonna stand right with the Lord look right with the Lord and say Lord you have exactly what I need and faith has brought me here and so there she was and he said listen woman it's not meant to take the children's bread I'm sent to the house of Israel to take the children's bread and give it to a dog what humiliation said you're of a different race and then drew the the card that the Jews say of the Gentiles dogs heathens but because faith had no hindrance now as we've already said if this was just something worked something trumped up something built up some emotion she would've been gone a long time ago but she's looking at him everything he said she said Lord brother Ram said she said Lord he said he was her Lord she said Lord but even the dogs eat the crime that fall from the Masters tail and Jesus said what great friend five to thee according to as you believe and the Bible says that very self-same our God brings us into his presence by his word and one day but if you can break into the the immortal the invisible God if you can break into that supernatural realm then you won't even on me but you will touch Jesus Christ that's not an emotional statement that's the faith of the broad but we have been so Church eyes we have been so program that when we come to a sudden I'm not talking about you I'm saying as a hold we've been so programmed that when we come we say well okay Thursday night or Wednesday night or Sunday and yes you believe the message but it's more than that now listen now when God by your experiences has been building you up on the most holy faith when we look in the scriptures because the Scriptures they are they are a teacher to us a schoolmaster they teach us and when we look at the different ones to look at David in the script and we all know the account with David and Goliath now no one in this room can convince me that Saul did not believe in God and so when David come up to the battle there was saw there was armies of Israel they knew the books of Moses they knew that God had told Abraham thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy they knew he was Jehovah Jireh by the experiences that God had given you see and so here they are you know David goes up to the battle and he says you know and as well what's going on up here and his brother said to him look you need to get back home boy don't you know we fighting the battle here and David said I don't see anybody probably nothing they said look you just want to come up here to see the battle he said well what am I see the only thing I'm seeing it's people still saying that brother Branham was a prophet and we believed the message and we know that this is true and no one can convince us as false but but the devil was still holding them at bay what the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ and the fullness of Calvary being made known the opening of the seals something has to take place because from December the 24th 1965 to July the 27th 2017 what has God been doing he's been doing great things so you know the store we're not going to get into that so we can get back to the message but David said to Saul and that whole army of believers message believers said Saul I believe in Malachi 4:2 in Luke 1730 revelation 2:10 7 and also I know that my name is in the book because it's going to take those seven thunders and the thunder is the voice of God when the seal is open it is bringing back and showing the broad that she has an abstract title deed to everything that lost that's the only reason that the mommy angel descended it's because there were names in the ball and he was going to descend with the living descendants of Abraham and show them their name in the book and by seeing the revelation of the word of God in their life not by going to a church not by some good preacher but because they would see their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life by the mystery that was being revealed in that hour they would withstand Satan and become an overcomer of the day that they lived in so all of them believed so Saul do you believe that Jehovah Jireh that that Jehovah nice Jehovah Nissi the Lord our banner do you believe that he is Jehovah of hosts is he the Lord of hosts is he the lord of the great armies so yeah yes we believe that but they did not have a divine revelation from God the only person that day that had a divine revelation from God was David because David by his experiences God had raised him up by the word and he could look back and point them to God in his life because your experiences are nothing that it's not something that's educated into you it's predestinated into you by the hand of God the Holy Ghost is not something that schooled into you it's predestinated and the Prophet said that God knew before the foundation of the world that you would want that Holy Ghost and predestinated that Holy Ghost to you so this one out of all those message believers he had a direct revelation from God now what if he would have went out there enthused if he'll do went out there when you know the story when Goliath saw David he said these people crazy they must think I'm a dog go I said I know these people have mental problems because we're gonna send a little kid to fight me these people mentally deranged they must be crazy these Jews crazy they don't know a little boy they must think I'm a dog I'm gonna have his head the lines weren't even looking at David like nothing like the devil look at you like you mean that that little teenage girl she gonna withstand me yes that's right you mean that little chow what that childlike faith he doesn't know even he can't even quote a lot of Scripture it's not that it's not quoting a lot of script it's the measure of faith the measure of the revelation that God has made himself real in your life and you operate on that not just for God so loved the world he gave it you you know that - but you operating mom and daddy you remember we prayed and God did that miracle I believe that same God with us mom and daddy so the experience is that David had these experiences by the word David said this God when I was on the backside of the desert and I had those seven sheep because seven represents the seven church ages and the greater David who was Christ would have a bride that he would protect through the seven church ages from the bear from the lion from the dragon from the Beast every creature then David would say you know the Lion King and God delivered me from the paw of the lion and he delivered me from the paw of the bear and because I have a divine revelation of what the word has made me in Christ because what Malachi for preach what brother Branham preached I am I am the manifestation of his ministry that continues own the Word made flesh what the prophet preached has become flesh in the people and so David went out with that slingshot those five stones of grace and then he took his sword and he cut the head and he went home dragging the head of Goliath victory victory why because faith is a revelation it's not just well I believe it praise God I believe if you believe and act upon it I told it and the Holy Ghost the leader of the bride the Holy Ghost that connects you to your theophany and that the often it takes you to the glorified body then that Holy Ghost has to connect you to the word that you bypassed so faith it's not something you worked up faith is coming to you from the Holy Ghost and faith is coming to you from the theophany word that you bypass because that word has come back to get you thank you Lord in that wonderful it's brother brother said when the word of God becomes eagle food to you then you have heard from your theophany you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God then the baptism of the Holy Ghost connects you to your theophany and your drawing from the house of God because that's the Alpha T is your word representation what you and I bypass that we could come here to be tried and tested but when trying and testing is over then he brings that word to you and forms who builds you up into the real you not the you that mommy and daddy brought but one that your spiritual father God because when the seals were open the gene of your spiritual life had been locked up in God's Word the gene of your natural life was in your natural father but the gene of your spiritual life was locked up in those seven seals but when the seals were opened then your name came into view and the gene that was in the word of you gave birth to you in this hour that's exactly right so we're not just saying well I'm gonna have this faith I'm gonna take this faith I'm gonna do this with it's the leadership of the Holy Ghost leading you god-given experiences god-given testimonies you say Lord because your word has been birth in my soul everywhere I go you're with me because that word has been birthed when I get in my car he's in my car because he's in me when I go when you go to the store sister's he's in you he's been birth in you he can never leave you the the gene of your spiritual I have given birth the real you so you can never go anywhere else without God going with you everywhere you go when you came when you came to church tonight you brought him here with you when you go home he gonna go with you brother Chad when you at work driving that truck he right there in you everywhere you go he right there in you because he has been burnt in you then how can he separate from you when he has give new life and quickened the C gene of life in your heart you see that's the rapturing faith as a prophet of God said he says it this way he says now everything that you need in your earthly journey is in you from the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says even the rapture and the next sentence he says don't resent that because the rapture is in you that rapture is in you because the rapture is that word of God so you're not looking for something to come in the future you're just looking at the Word of God unfold itself in your life see but many times people think well the rat one day I'm gonna be walking and there something hit me on the head brother jerem that that was the rapture no don't come that way it grows up in you like the statute like the gene of God growing up into you because the only man that will go in the rapture is the stature of a perfect man a good man ain't going in the rapture a perfect man and that perfect man has been growing in you because this is the gene of God the very DNA of God growing up in you and you'll never find anywhere in the scripture that something's going to come to you from from out in space and that's why we said and the Bible says and the Prophet says that that Holy Ghost in you the Holy Ghost in you is leading you to the glorification and he's taking you from the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't have the quote here tonight in the sealed e-book to ask brother Branham brother Brown please explain the translation of the bride he says now it's just a change and he says now I want to say that it's only to the believer and then he goes home he says now the same word that changed Abraham and Sarah that that word materialized around their born-again experience and he says around that born-again experience there is a body being formed a body being formed you mean my Christian journey is bringing a body that's being formed around my born-again experience is that the reason I hunger and thirst like a pregnant woman who wants to have that body to be a perfect body and cry to her husband husband you're going to have to go and get means some millon you're gonna have to go get me some bananas you're gonna have to go get me some potatoes sweetheart don't you know it's 3 o'clock in the morning I don't care I got to have it I'm craving for it and you craving for the word what brought the Craven because there is a lard body that's being fun around your born-again experience not what not what you trying to work up look what I worked up look what I got brother Gerald look what I am like no no all these things were predestined by the hand of God he does those things let's go to Galatians chapter 2 real quick now it's going on it's about a quarter till nine I don't want to wear yet sir long did it came in and thank you God bless I was just waiting on somebody there but-but-but I'm not gonna try to wait because I'm not that no I'm not that kind but but but you're feeding on the word and I'll see your faith as Paul says I am crucified with Christ and yet I live not live not live but Christ lives in me then I live by the faith of the Son of God every one when you read Hebrews chapter 11 and go through the he the Hall of faith starting a table by faith until the end were Paul says without us they cannot be made perfect there was only one faith that was the faith of the Son of God never did you read verse 8 never come over that faith because he could never come over that faith because this is God and the message super since brother Branham said no everyone can have that super sense it only belongs to the believers and he said that super since it's the Holy Ghost in Galatians chapter 3 and you know Paul was dealing with these Galatians who were falling back into words and legalism and we're thankful that the Holy Spirit has come in this hour crying grace grace the capstone when it come down and United and the capstone has united with the bride when it came down crying it did not crawl cry law legalism it cried grace grace unto it you see then this message that we have is a message of grace we are justified by faith we are kept by faith the whole the whole foundation of the Christian is faith you see not by the works of the law so we see here the the Galatians you know these things the Galatians had begin to fall back others have began to tell them and bring a bad report just like those 10 spies in the days of Joshua in the days of Moses went in spies 12 spies came back those 10 spies brought a bad report to the people and said we're grasshoppers we can never make it we the circumstances is too great but remember when faith finds its bedding ground no circumstance will be considered and so when they come back with a bad report say I don't know if we can make it who were grasshoppers and these are giants they brought a bad report just like these that were in the book of Galatians after Paul had established them in the present-day truth and brought the reality of the gospel to them others begin to take them back into legalism and Paul begins to deal with that you see because we're not going back into legalism our self-righteousness he is our righteousness he is our peace he is our justification and I asked you tonight would there be anyone in the house to say Andre I'm satisfied with just my own righteousness then I would have to tell you what Peter said our righteousness is as filthy rags if they're not even approached the Living God except he made provisions and he made a way for us to know God's provided place of worship see it would take God to do these things and we're standing not on our merits but we're resting on his marriage so Paul began to speak to them on the hearing of faith and how important it is that we hear these things with our spiritual ear Paul says here now I'm not even going to read verse one we're gonna reverse to this only what I learn of you received the spirit that's capitalist by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith he's saying to them did you receive the Holy Ghost by the good words was it good works that brought you the Holy Ghost or was it the hearing of faith because you have representation in God before the foundation of the world and can hear what the Spirit is saying so did you did you receive anything did you receive anything from God because you worked no you have never received anything from God because you worked in what's a good Christian forget it it's His grace and mercy so Paul says verse three are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit capital S are you now made perfect by the flesh have he suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that Minister you the Spirit he says the the ministry that ministered the spirit and worketh miracles among you does he do it by words is it by his own words that he's doing this Oh or by the hearing of faith now I'm saying those things because in our first birth even though we did not come the right way we came and we got here we got here even though we bypassed our theophany we got here even though we come to essential birth we got here even though we may have come to a mixed chromosome in DNA but we got here and because we got here God would bring the correct divine order to you and I because the the perfect will of God you would have not come to a sexual desire you would have come by the word the spoken word is the original seed he would have said brother Chad come forth and you have raised up and came forth and so God who is perfect in his ways when he deals with his family now he's not dealing on the permissive room he's bringing his perfect order to his perfect blood by his perfect word through perfect faith that's right thank you Lord listen now let's go and read this a little bit more verse 6 even as abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen that's us through faith preached be preached before the gut preached the gospel unto Abraham did he preach the gospel time around surely he did when he began to unfold himself as melt patek else a di l know him he was preaching the gospel there Melchisedec came with bread and wine was he's not preaching the gospel he was pointing to the broken body of Jesus Christ sure he was he says now so then so so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham I had to read that because my brother's sister you are blessed with Abraham because you are his seed now I hate to have you turn but let's let's turn over to Romans chapter 4 Romans chapter 4 starting at verse 1 you said well brother hungry no no it's your fault you're pulling on the word I'm just your servant I'm just your service verse 1 Romans chapter 4 verse 1 what shall we say then that Abraham that's Romans chapter 4 verse 1 what shall we say then that Abraham our Father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not of God so I saying let me let me finish her in other words for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt so so Paul he goes into this because he wants to show the believer through Abraham and it was important that he show us through Abraham because after the fall in the garden God and after the noetic flow God began to look for a man that he could bring his race through because Adam the book of Redemption had went from Adam and those whose names were in that Lamb's Book in the book of redemption it had went that book had went back to the original owner God himself but God was looking to find someone that he could reintroduce faith and bring his seed through that person God chose Abraham and that's why the meeting that's why Melchizedek had to come that who was priest and king and have communion with Abraham because God was reintroducing faith and a race of people that could only come by faith that's why we're not looking at Abraham's natural seed it's the faith seed of Abraham you see so from the from God introducing faith to Abraham that faith went from Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses Joshua and on down until that seed become flesh in Jesus Christ who was the faith seed of Abraham he was the beginning of a new race of faith race and through that incarnation of the word through that through the faith of Jesus Christ him being the firstborn among many brethren all those that would come to Christ in this last hour and in every hour of the church ages had to come by faith because this is a race of faith they are faith people not not like the denominator they call this a faith based are you gonna be faith based if you didn't come from Melchizedek because the priesthood of Melchisedec is not like the priesthood of Aaron the Aaron Aaron priesthood through Levite was under a carnal commandment in other words it was trying to make people born in sin live a holy word and they could not do it so Aaron of Levi officiated over that kind of priesthood or every year he had to come to the the atonement every year he had to offer the sacrifice every year and of all the millions and millions and millions of lambs and lambs and Bullock's and doves and escaped goats and oil and all in all not one drop of blood ever forgave any sin no but who came by the flesh tried to take a perfect law and apply that to people who were born under seeing could not do it could not make the worshiper perfect but Melchizedek who was a priest of the Most High God not over carnality no rifice who claim from a pinnacle the New Jerusalem he having terrible subject in himself and he would officiate over him and he would come once and once forever and bring them to him spell in the Bible says how blessed Christ is because he is after the order of Melchisedec he's he's a high priest of a race that before the world was ever made and he bring in faith civilization back to his people in this hour and the just shall live by faith walk by faith judged by faith live by faith just a little bit more now let's turn over let me just read these couple of things and then we'll close but we certainly appreciate your patience with us tonight oh my it's just wonderful when we begin to look into the Holy Word of God and to see what God has made you in Christ before the foundation of the world and that's why the opening of these things brother Branham he talked about going over beyond the curtain of time in the seals but in the seals he never began to bring the ministry of Melchizedek you see and you go back and you check me out on the Seventh Seal when brother Branham he preaches he said now he said I was waiting for someone to stand up and tell me they saw what was happening all this week he said what was it he said it was the angel of the Lord the Holy Ghost he said now it's gone from you the revelation of the seals he said it's gone from you but again you go back and read around the time of the coming of the Lord these things he called it another cycle and that would be the cycle that God would have that seed on the earth that could receive those things that he preached and that week of the seals they would receive those things by the Holy Ghost because it's not been a it's God it's God and so now in this season where the bride we are in the season of the bride's revival these things that you hear and that your press have been preaching this broad material here for the bride's revival so if somebody said well I'm looking for the bridal revival when the squeeze comes that's going to bring the no no no no no brother Brown said national force listen to me now he said national force put Israel in her homeland and national force will put the churches in the world Council but he says it takes the power of God to put the people in the rapture so it's not gonna be national for you're not gonna say well when they come in and shut the door down then I'm gonna have faith in if you didn't have faith in God before the foundation of the world you ain't go get it then because your only manifest in the faith that's in you faith lays in the bride revelation lays in the bride you see that's in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the material that God is revealing to you that's already in you just like the natural Sun controls all botany life the son of God in this third pool what was the third pool it was to go back and bring the life from the seed that was already planted so he's not going to go back and quick and denominational crease and ideas and dogma and doctrine and we're not a group that believes that brother Brown has come back right see a lot of group I dare say brother Brandon didn't finish it he got to come back but but that's not awesome we've been laid by the Holy Ghost we know who the great one is it is the Lord Jesus Christ we know he's leading the bride see and when brother Brandon was finished with his work when that faithful servant was finished with his work then God took his man but you're here though you're here because you were to catch that word and God through your new birth giving you experiences by the word and I know everyone in here you have your experiences build on those experience god-given experience testify those things said Lord Lord you're calling me in this hour I'm being drawn by your word Lord I know who I am Lord I'm taking time now to see what you say Who I am in the word Lord and your word says that on your bride Lord and your word says that the bride is the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ and she won't move until she has the say the Lord and the said the Lord is the message of the hour and your prophet said that the bride would have a seven thunder revival and the seven thunders is the message of this hour that's what it is not something to come not in some new education some new modified seminary taught no no no it's the message of the hour it's God in simplicity but it's God in reality though and so the Prophet said this and we close on this let me read a couple of places here in the scripture and the message of the hour brother Branham says in a message spiritual food in due season he says I want you to get built up now in the Holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up he says in a message rapture I love this one here he says if you if you if you've got eternal life you were in God before there ever was a world you are a part a son of God an attribute of God he know the very age you were coming he predestinated you to this age see to that age to take that place and no one can take it no one can take your place no one that's your place that's yours no one can take that the the mister is not even finished without you taking your place because the bride is the end of the mystery she is his victory let me finish now he said now he says care how many impersonations and things you've got to be there because he knew you would be there now you are made manifest now you can fellowship with him my brother says that's what God wants the the gospel didn't come to make us just mechanical robots God wants fellowship God want to come and say how you doing today you say father Oh father I'm doing I'm doing fine with your presence with me Lord God God wants us to talk to him now oh no well I gotta get down I gotta get down and pray now see now you know there my wife there I love her and sometimes I don't spend enough time with I know that's right sometimes she'll tell you I get in my study or when I'm seeking the mind of God different things and then sometimes he'll say like you don't hardly ever spend enough time with me you'll never talk to me but when you go to the Church of your preacher people talk to them you ever talk to me I'm telling them myself but that's true brother but she knows that it's not because I don't want to ignore her it it's because sometimes I get caught up in things and then I realize and I said hold on and then i say sweet i'll call my wife sweet i said sweet then i'll start asking because my wife she does alot she so she cooks she makes things she she done told herself three or four languages she plays a good tour Quattro for all that and i'm so then when i begin to show interest in her see then I begin to tell I could begin to say this to Lord Lord I'm sorry Lord what a wonderful wife you giving me Lord I don't know what I would do without my wife Lord enough and then then that has to spill over and I go to her and I tell us we I couldn't make it without you you know God knew all of my faults failure frailties and all that so then then I kind of get lined up you know then I'm back talking to my wife but it wasn't like I didn't want to talk to it and if you don't want talk to you why then you need talk to her so so but but if it ever comes in and you know people been married different times and you go through certain seas and different things like that but don't ever be that no I'm just tired of talking to her she always want to talk all the time ain't got time to talk to her don't you see I'm busy what you doing I'm busy woman you see I'm busy don't you see yeah I'm just I'm being like that that's true through them but but see that could be sometimes we doing the lord like that to say lord let me hurry up and prayed in god I love you in Jesus name em I gotta go y'all understand where I'm coming so what if so what what mean what if you want to talk you say honey I've been working all day I've been thinking about what brother Andre said and I want to talk no I'm I'm being sitting down don't talk to my busy and you don't work it up all day you're waiting to get home tells you why she's there no I'm busy you see I'm someone ain't got time for that tell me later you'd be like well I'll tell you what I want but sometimes I'm just saying this sometimes really Christianity becomes religion and we don't want religion but this this God this great god of the love and mercy a God who is rich in mercy a god who's not going to lose you you're not gonna be lost you save your Christians your believers he loves you but that God wants fellowship you know what you say well y'all know this quote I got called this I am yeah yeah that's fine that has this place but this God wants to talk with you he wants you to talk to him he wants you to listen to him he wants you to read his word now you know a mechanical thing you can do wine it up like a robot you'd you want they wanna stop like no I gotta do it wine it up again God don't want that kind of Chris where's it man I gotta wind him up again god he's a real purse and and the message and all these things is so that he could bring fellowship you and him and then he makes us a godly jealous because he shows us with his prophet and their brother branham is and God comes down and brother Bram speaks to the storm different things God's Hill and then God says how would you like to walk with me and then we read those things and said man why God asks brother Brendan walk with him I want what we got him I want him to come down so God knows how to place certain things in the message that will raise up godly jealous in us where we say God I want you to be like that in my life too I want you to express yourself like that to me to God so that's this faith because these things are bringing us into a real divine revelation walking character building loving relationship with God and that's what we're so desired because God has placed that in our heart let me just read this one more we go let me just read this one more and we go and then Lord willing next time if we if the Lord permits we brother Gerald Lord permits maybe on the next trip we can come back here and maybe have another service you know okay let me read this to you and the message perfect faith brother Bram says and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into broad material you see you see you're getting into rapture and condition now that means for each one of us not just for the pastor the Deacons and trustees that means for the laity for every individual walks in a world with God alone you excuse me you're baptized into the kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God see he gives the orders and you packed him out whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt no where you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you just go on just the same now you're coming to perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails god bless it let us bow our head town Heavenly Father how grateful and thankful we are Lord for your precious word Lord there is nothing more precious than your word and your bride all over the earth receiving that word moving into this brides revival by the leadership of life eternal life and Lord when we see your precious word becoming Spirit in life Lord we we hold on to that with the faith of our heart never to release it and never to let it go because it will never let us go and it will never release us and Lord as you prayed and John 17 as your prophet said he said you only desired one thing of the Father that where there will my bride be with me what divine love Lord and father this word bringing us has brought us into a divine relationship an intimacy that no one can ever know that languages and and words that we write on paper it is to the sublime Lord and so father you know every heart here tonight you know every need and you're more than able you've already met the need may our faith the faith of Jesus Christ the faith that began in the beginning from your meeting Abraham our Father and coming all the way down to the bride at this last day who through her she will call her brethren from the dead the dead in Christ shall rise we who are loved shall be changed and we together with them will go to meet you in the air Lord you have brought these things as your prophet said the same Holy Ghost that justified the Lutheran's that sanctify the Westlands that baptized the Pentecostals is setting the bride in order for the going and the rapture we see these things Lord Father we don't have to look at the world condition and the chaos that it's in because we're up here like Abraham was with Elohim he was not down in Sodom he was there where Elohim was revealing himself to Abraham and saying to him tell Sarah I will visit her according to the time of life Oh father father Lord bless your wonderful pastor here Lord how we honor him and respect him Lord the ministry in this lovely group of believers that you have made him Shepherd / Lord we're thankful Lord and humble that we could have this privilege Lord to come and fellowship with them bless them Lord with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and Lord we are so thankful that you have come and made yourself known to us in this hour and that we are your children and you are a heavenly father we give you glory honor praise and we thank you Father in Jesus name we pray amen God blesses we call the pastor well Gerald you come brother amen let's give the Lord a hand amen thank God for the word he may have and again he could have went on of course for another hour or so and maybe I'll have to do like I told you know what I'm going to say told our brother Brandon if he didn't preach for a hour and a half I was going to ask for a refund but but you get into the anointing and the power of the Holy Ghost on you rather you can move on and on on because why you're getting into eternity you're getting into the eternal word the eternal word is in you and brother talk about our brother mentioned patience I said well when we consider the patience that God has with us I saw how much patience knotweed I have with him hey man so we're not good not going to lose patience when it comes to the going forth of the word and at least I haven't gotten ever I don't remember very often getting tired airing airing the preaching of the word because we get into the spirit of the word with the ministry hey man so and what and God is feeding us God is increasing faith by by the revealed word a Mayan so I pray the grace of God to help us and there's a number of things that I made notes here but I said I won't be able to comment on it I said it'll it'll say it'll take maybe another hour or so and and maybe our brother and sister ed would have the leap we would be too late but the saved by the grace of God that faith comes by hearing the word faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word a man so it's tremendous concerning the things that our brother brought out tonight concerning faith but you know it and it is as the finish there tonight with it the thought on God in simplicity it is God in revealing simplicity it is you believing God it is God receiving your testimony it is God acknowledging it by giving you the Holy Ghost and by the Holy Ghost giving you the faith that pleases him a man because again we have been raptured by the grace of God I'm not allowed me to repeat it for those that have not heard that most of you have heard it that when I did minister in a certain church and I did say I said I've been resurrected and I've been raptured and everybody everybody got silent they got really quiet and there was and they stopped responding to the word and I did say I said please I said don't do that I said I'll prove to you I said that I have been resurrected and I'll prove to you I said that I have been raptured and of course and I went and I read them if he's chapter 2 you Athey quicken what does quicken mean it means to make a lie you have him a hill high you have he resurrected because you were dead spiritually now you're alive spiritually a man but you've been born again by the grace of Almighty God then and so I said you had the quick answer I said are you quicken and you experienced the resurrection of Christ in your soul as what makes you a new creation I said now so go on down nice to three or four verses and now I said you're raptured it says we're caught up into heavenly places in Christ a man praise the name of the Lord so I have experienced the resurrection I experienced the rapture yeah you know spiritually now we're moving into it physically by the grace of Almighty God it is God bringing it into manifestation a man from the inside out by the grace of god and the prophet of god quoted that verse can certainly were caught up into heaven ii places in christ and he said now he said he referred to it as the rapture but he said what's going on in heavenly places he said the word is being revealed it's giving us more and more faith for the change but even it's it's it's already in progress and we're moving on by the grace of god amen so god help us is my prayer a man and God bless our brother Andre we thank the Lord for the word tonight please I beg of you in the name of the Lord don't leave it behind take it with you in your heart because because if you're only hurting it in your head that you'll leave it behind it's gone it's in it it's out but it's got to go into the oh but it got to go into the hand but it's got to go down detain it into your soul let him that I've been here we hear with the ears in our heads but now let's go let go down and see if we're going to hear it with the near the ear of the soul the Devon Bethany hear what the Spirit is saying to the to the to the world to the children of God by the grace of God amen so don't leave it behind take it with you meditate on it think about it thank God for it amen and got to come on the scene and bless you for it amen so to God be the glory that we're going to go from faith to faith not knowledge to knowledge but faith of faith the spiritual revelation of the word and they'll prove that we are in heavenly places in Christ and the word is being revealed to us by the grace of Almighty God and I thought I was blessed by what our brother brought out concerning the the Abraham and it was by faith that Abraham named the animals the creatures that was that was good now I've never heard that before brought out in that way but that was good that was the anointing and gaudy and Abraham Annie Annie he didn't just not by you know I just I'll just do this I'll just do that I'll call that one that that one that it's good he knew their nature a man it was the anointing in Helen it was certainly the anointing of God in out a manta to refer to the Dove and call it the DOE to refer to the lion and called the lion because this was the first Adam but there was coming a second Adam and God is reflected he reflects himself in nature but the the good is reflected in nature and evil is reflected in nature a man so I tried trust by the grace of God don't forget it a man that God bless you with that revelation and the first Adam put himself in sin with E that she'd be redeemed and the second Adam came down to identify with the sin that the bride was in you know all points he was tempted like as we are yet without sin but he identified with it he came and he was tested by at all what forward to redeem the bride as that of redeemed it was good to go it was dead to redeem II Christ and to redeem his right forever this is tremendous brother is God hidden and revealed in simplicity it's God in His Word Genesis to Revelation is like I say in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and he had a plan and he had and he had a pattern a man praise the Lord a man and he just looked back and and it's got in simplicity with Luther God in simplicity with Wesley God in simplicity with the old fashioned Salvation Army got in simplicity with the Pentecostals and then God his complicity in the Ministry of William Branham a man a prophet a man that's right that's what amazes a lot of people was the simplicity of the Ministry of William Branham supposed simplicity all William Branham himself and God Agee he was God's chosen servant he made said to call out the bright in these last days praise the name of the Lord so it's tremendous praise the God so I don't don't don't try to make it bigger than what it is smaller than what it is the proud of God in the seal said leave it the way it is a million and as I've said the resurrection is a resurrection don't try to explain the mechanics believe it the rapture the rapture don't try to explain the mechanics believe it amen we're on our way by the grace of God amen praise the Lord again the thought that came out here when as our brother Minister faith honors God he said and God honors faith you can have the knowledge of the message the knowledge of the word but do you have the faith of it the revelation of it in your heart you can have it in your head but God doesn't honor that the only honours within your heart amen God sees what's in your heart by the grace of God and this thought also that really struck me too and we knew about it we wouldn't Shirley we added in our heads but a revelation our hearts when our brother mentioned concerning the woman they came for bread lord have mercy on me for this and that and they called her a dog just think Jesus referenced her as a dog was that Christian well he wanted to bring out something he said it to bring out something he said it to make to make it manifested hallelujah for what for for the Gentiles hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brothers sister that's you and me oh we crawl up to the table and and old she call him dead the son of David and this but then when then when he struck her with the revelation of what he thought she was and he said it's not right to take the children's bread and give it to dogs Jesus you Christian to say such a thing is that well that it's God in simplicity he wanted to get her to the revelation of who she was and what she was and to bring out in her humility hallelujah to get her to what to get her to do what he wanted to uh wants us to do what must I do to be saved what was she had to be do to be saved repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ where she recognized him as Lord and God gave her what she asked for by the grace of God so repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you'll get the you get crumbs all right you get the the eternal bread of the revealed Word well that's tremendous do we have her attitude do we have her spirit or the humility that she manifested are we seeing the truth that she saw as she saw it that's tremendous that is tremendous one thing to read it and say oh yeah I believe it and you know it's amazing you know he called her dog look what look how she reacted but are we reacting the same way when we come into his presence you know personally in him when you go into your prayer room and you and you shut the door and you're praying to the Lord Amen she said yes Lord that's right I'm a dog but even the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from the master's table thank God thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for saving us dogs thank you Jesus for feeding us dogs amen thank you Jesus for giving us the Garmon you're giving giving us a man clothing in the white robes of your righteousness Lord and thank you Jesus that you predestinated us as the Bride of Christ oh that ought to humble us and humble us humble us more and more by the grace of God praise the Lord so the Lord help us rather to believe the word and to walk by faith I believe it's God in simplicity here in Newfoundland God in simplicity anywhere else it's amazing that God has been using us the way that he has over the years to minister not just a Newfoundland but to the world we thank the Lord for that privilege in that honor and will give the glory to Jesus and tell of his wonderful law by the grace of God so maybe there was a reason why that brother Branham landed in Gander in the early 50s and as I said I was 25 miles east of him I might've been five years old but I was just 25 miles away from the airport where the Prophet landed and he did get off the plane he did go into the airport he did come back get on the plane and they did take the picture and the pillar of fire was in the window of the plane where the Prophet was sitting so there was a reason for that a man I believe it I've seen the picture and I'm still trying to locate the copy of it by the grace of God so I believe it was for a reason the Prophet had landed there and it was only about an hour's drive away I guess from their individual Falls that God begin the move among the Saints amen and not only that he sent that brother up from Jeffersonville and have fellowship with brother cater sister cater and brother and sister Manuel and some of the believers back then in 1963 and it was the same brother that took myself and sister Betty around Jeffersonville incepted not the same brother but their brothers some that took us around Jeffersonville in September that's amazing that's absolutely amazing as the Lord I said to God be the glory for what you have done and what you're doing I said here in Newfoundland a man I trust and want to believe that there that there's a number of new for land that's going to be part of the Bride of Christ that and part of the rapture by the grace of God and of course I have a letter that brother Manuel received from brother Branham because he had invited the Prophet to come and ministered in in Newfoundland and they had sent back a report response saying thank your brother for the invitation and that we are putting you on the list and and as the Lord leads will wait on his leadership yes he was invited to minister in mr. Falls anybody and and they were put on the list for waiting on the leadership of God but by that time before that time could come God took the Prophet home a man so it's it's all all in the in the will of God the predestinated plan of God a man so we trusted that the anointing when the Prophet flew up the anointing was still here a man praise the Lord he because why and again it was a miracle a man that bottom to Gander was the plane that ran out of fuel and they were complaining and the brother said to Warner Brothers I got the cassette song that to brother the testified of it enjoy there in jeffersonville and the prophet of God said don't complain people were complaining because that the plane diverted and landed in gander instead of going on to New York somewhere and he said don't complain he said we've been going a half an hour he said on an empty tank and he said he sir wasn't for the grace of God he said we be out there in the in the ocean amen hallelujah it was a miracle but a God had got it ordained it and predestinated for a reason for that prophet to come and land in gander amen and I mentioned to brother brother Billy Paul Brennan and he does recall that he's I remember he said today he said our our landing in gander he could remember that he knew about that because the plane had ran out of fuel but edie was not aware of the picture that was taken and so we're waiting to try to get that but so we can get him a copy of it by the grace of God so you can be in prayer for that so it's all for a reason we thank God for it and it's all for a reason that God sent our brother Andre to minister to us last year and a minister again to us this this time and we're praying the grace of God that the Lord will send them back amen we we need we need that ministry again of our brother so let's be in prayer for brother Andre and sister Sarah the grace of God to them as they as they move on following the leadership of the Holy Ghost and when it comes again hopefully that the Elvia be able to minister more than once maybe three or four times at least you know we'll see as the Lord leads when he returns again so god bless our brother Andre god bless brother sister Sarah so grace to them in their journey and god bless brother Karsan sister Sharon as they journey back as well to Central Newfoundland amen so the Lord be with us this in the melodies of praises number forty I believe it's to God be the glory great things he has done it's amazing but it's all in simplicity great greatness in the eyes of man is one thing greatness in the eyes of God is another so to God be the glory great things he have done so lovely the world that he gave us his son who yielded his life in atonement for sin and he opened the life gate that all may go in the elect and it says great things he has taught us and great things he had done and great our rejoicing through Jesus the son but pure and higher and greater will be our wonder our transport or our

sister is is needing prayer now in for her soul and her spirit and her mind and her body we prayed the grace of God to give her the direction and leadership of the Holy Ghost the grace of God to give her Holy Ghost courage a man for the Lord a man so as says the Lord would deal with her we pray grace Lord a man Lord the Jewish step on the scene move the enemy back Lord and I pray that she'll have that faith that faith that pleases you amen and what is that faith is the revelation of the word and it's the what do you mean the revelation is the word revealed to you in your heart and in your soul as it was going over the pulpit tonight there are those that would understand it then there are those that would not understand it it would be confusing but faith makes it simple amen by the grace of
