[44:17] so perfect is his pattern so perfect is
[44:20] his plan
[44:22] as i said i've ministered on it before
[44:24] where it says in the beginning god
[44:25] created the heavens of the earth
[44:27] amen but he had a plan a perfect and a
[44:30] pattern
[44:30] a purpose and a pattern brother when he
[44:34] did it
[44:35] so i by thankful we're sharing in his
[44:38] plan
[44:38] part of his plan and he and his purpose
[44:41] and his pattern
[44:42] by the grace of god amen brother it's
[44:44] not accidental
[44:46] because a lot of you well you know but
[44:48] mainly out in denominations
[44:50] and back when we you know a lot of
[44:52] people when they first come to
[44:53] church and and believe in god believe in
[44:55] god with for this oh yeah
[44:57] and they feel that oh yeah the what
[44:59] happened in the garden of eden you know
[45:01] god didn't know what was going to happen
[45:03] you know and the devil just did this but
[45:05] god knew
[45:06] amen in the beginning when god started
[45:08] it all he knew what was going to happen
[45:10] and amen and he predestinated redemption
[45:13] praise the lord
[45:14] and again let me give you this 200 so
[45:16] you understand it
[45:18] see if see if you're really coming to
[45:20] where god wants you to be have the
[45:22] attitude god wants you to have
[45:23] and the nature god wants you to have
[45:26] amen
[45:27] say again as well why why
[45:30] why did god allow this why did god do
[45:32] this or well the devil did this so god
[45:34] came back to do this
[45:35] oh that's all that's that's the why
[45:38] no no no no no so
[45:42] i'll tell you what god wanted wanted to
[45:44] reveal to his
[45:45] sons and daughters his nature amen so he
[45:48] allowed it to happen
[45:50] not that he that he was going to well
[45:52] yes surely god will do this god do that
[45:54] no no
[45:55] no no he allowed it to happen so that he
[45:58] could he would in the in that plan
[46:00] amen he would reveal himself his love
[46:04] for you amen in that he laid down his
[46:07] life for you he suffered for you amen
[46:11] he took all your sin and wiped it away
[46:14] and now you're going to love him because
[46:16] of his character
[46:17] amen and he and he and he shares that
[46:20] character with us
[46:21] in the baptism of the holy ghost and
[46:23] many of us really feel that we have the
[46:25] character of jesus
[46:27] we have the character of god amen not
[46:29] just somebody who is religious
[46:31] but we're spiritual sons and daughters
[46:33] of god to god
[46:35] be the glory amen so the lord blesses

[47:31] world the things of the world
[47:33] we well he we respected him and he
[47:36] respected us

[57:13] amen and amen praise the lord god bless
[57:16] us
[57:18] turn with me to deuteronomy chapter 20
[57:20] 29
[57:22] deuteronomy chapter 29 we pray the grace
[57:25] of god to those not with us tonight
[57:27] amen amen that
[57:30] wherever they are they'll call on the
[57:32] lord
[57:33] wherever they are they'll feel the
[57:35] presence of god is there with them
[57:38] as he is with us praise the lord
[57:41] in deuteronomy 29 and
[57:46] verse 1
[57:49] these are the words of the covenant
[57:52] which the lord commanded moses to make
[57:55] with the children of israel in the land
[57:58] of moab
[58:00] beside the covenant which he made with
[58:02] them in horeb
[58:04] and moses called unto all israel and
[58:08] said unto them
[58:09] ye have seen all that the lord did
[58:12] before your
[58:13] eyes in the land of egypt
[58:16] unto pharaoh and unto all his servants
[58:20] and unto all his land
[58:23] the great temptations which thine eyes
[58:26] have seen
[58:27] the signs and those great miracles
[58:31] amen that he saw in egypt and it says
[58:35] yet
[58:35] the lord hath not given you in heart to
[58:37] perceive
[58:39] and eyes to see and ears to hear
[58:43] unto this day amen
[58:46] to bring us to the place that we're
[58:49] going to believe
[58:50] the way he wants us to believe amen
[58:53] we're going to believe amen in the
[58:56] attitude that he wants us to have
[58:58] by the grace of god amen so he was
[59:02] bringing moses
[59:03] to that position bringing moses to that
[59:07] maturity
[59:08] and brother sister god's been working on
[59:11] us to bring us to that maturity
[59:13] to believe god amen that maturity to
[59:16] trust the lord
[59:17] that maturity really to go from time to
[59:20] eternity
[59:21] amen the maturity to go out of this body
[59:24] and into a glorified body
[59:26] amen so here there is a way that god
[59:29] wants us to believe
[59:30] what he has said what he has done amen
[59:33] and
[59:33] what he has promised by the grace of god
[59:36] you can be seated and
[59:40] turn with me to second corinthians
[59:41] chapter four
[59:44] while you're turning the bible again
[59:47] says in deuteronomy chapter
[59:49] 29 and he said lest there be
[59:54] among you man or woman or family or
[59:57] tribe whose heart turneth away this day
[1:00:00] from the lord our god
[1:00:02] to go and serve the gods of these
[1:00:04] nations
[1:00:05] amen god had to do this god had to do
[1:00:07] that amen
[1:00:09] to put them on their guard but some
[1:00:12] still did what god didn't want them to
[1:00:14] do
[1:00:15] amen see why because they didn't believe
[1:00:18] it the way that god wanted them to
[1:00:19] believe it
[1:00:20] are we going to believe what god has
[1:00:22] done the way that he wants us to believe
[1:00:24] it
[1:00:25] amen are we going to believe what god is
[1:00:27] doing the way that he wants us to
[1:00:29] believe it or what god is going to do
[1:00:31] amen brother there they they say they
[1:00:34] believe this they believe it this way
[1:00:36] they believe it that way
[1:00:37] but we got to believe it in a way that
[1:00:39] it's the manifestation of a perfect
[1:00:41] faith
[1:00:42] amen praise the lord it is not it is not
[1:00:45] it's not a
[1:00:46] creed it's not just doctrine and
[1:00:48] theology
[1:00:49] no it is a revelation of the word of god
[1:00:53] that is ordained to give us faith and is
[1:00:56] ordained to give us the faith that god
[1:00:58] wants
[1:00:58] us to have in this day and in this hour
[1:01:01] amen not the faith just the faith that
[1:01:04] luther had or the faith that wesley had
[1:01:06] and the eight even the pentecostals
[1:01:08] but brother god is expecting us to have
[1:01:10] the faith that the bridegroom needs in
[1:01:13] the last day
[1:01:14] god has done that and we believe it god
[1:01:16] has done this and we believe it
[1:01:18] amen what he did in the in the
[1:01:20] pentecostal age we believe it
[1:01:22] but now brother god has done something
[1:01:23] else and god is doing something else
[1:01:25] amen brother they believed that what god
[1:01:28] wanted them to believe
[1:01:29] then and god did what he wanted to do in
[1:01:31] their day
[1:01:33] god did what he wanted to do in their
[1:01:34] age amen
[1:01:36] but brother we're not in that day we're
[1:01:38] not in that age we've gone on
[1:01:40] and brother since since the restoration
[1:01:42] began in luther
[1:01:44] it has been maybe around 500 years amen
[1:01:47] but god is still working in his seed god
[1:01:50] is still working with his word
[1:01:52] amen praise the name of the lord he is
[1:01:55] still revealing his word
[1:01:56] amen but it's he's doing it in in such a
[1:01:59] way
[1:02:00] so as to bring forth what he wants to do
[1:02:03] he is doing it in such a way so as to
[1:02:04] bring forth what god has promised is
[1:02:07] going to happen
[1:02:08] in the last days amen god did it that
[1:02:10] way for luther
[1:02:11] god did it another way for wesley god
[1:02:14] did it another way for the pentecostals
[1:02:16] and the others amen
[1:02:17] but what it what way is god doing it
[1:02:19] today
[1:02:20] well brother what are we looking for
[1:02:22] today what is god doing today
[1:02:25] amen what does god expect to accomplish
[1:02:28] amen and what he's doing and how he does
[1:02:31] it
[1:02:31] brother as we said it was justification
[1:02:34] sanctification
[1:02:35] the baptism of the holy ghost amen but
[1:02:38] then
[1:02:38] comes down to the perfect faith of god
[1:02:41] the perfect love of god amen
[1:02:44] and it says a brotherly kindness but
[1:02:46] it's the holy ghost love amen for him
[1:02:49] it's the holy ghost love for his word
[1:02:51] and he's there because to respond to
[1:02:53] that love
[1:02:54] and to give us what we're hungering and
[1:02:55] thirsting for
[1:02:57] amen so what are we hungry and thirsting
[1:02:59] for well brother i tell you this god
[1:03:01] the prophet of god did say and he said
[1:03:03] listen he said god sends the holy ghost
[1:03:05] to head
[1:03:06] he said to create in the heart of his
[1:03:09] seed he said what he wants to do
[1:03:11] amen so that's why he said the holy
[1:03:14] ghost true to luther
[1:03:15] amen what for to create in luther's
[1:03:18] heart a hunger
[1:03:19] amen for justification amen
[1:03:22] praise the name of the lord because they
[1:03:24] they were
[1:03:25] they were lost in in an idea in a
[1:03:27] religious
[1:03:28] religious thought thinking oh to be
[1:03:30] justified i've got to do this
[1:03:32] to be justified i've got to do that amen
[1:03:34] and god will justify me
[1:03:36] if i'm religious god will justify me if
[1:03:38] i do this no
[1:03:40] and finally brother after a long time of
[1:03:42] fighting with it
[1:03:43] and struggling god gave luther the
[1:03:46] revelation
[1:03:47] that you are justified but you've got to

[1:08:13] the pentecostals went praising the lord
[1:08:15] amen she was getting greater and greater
[1:08:17] and greater
[1:08:18] amen to the point where after the
[1:08:20] pentecostal revival the the world in
[1:08:24] general
[1:08:24] was shocked amen why were they shocked
[1:08:28] because it had such an impact and it's
[1:08:30] such an influence
[1:08:31] amen not just here not just there but he
[1:08:34] went around the world
[1:08:35] amen they said oh my this is amazing
[1:08:38] what's going on here
[1:08:39] the pentecostal revival not just it not
[1:08:41] just in the united states
[1:08:42] and it went on to canada uh excuse me
[1:08:46] went on to canada and it went on a duty
[1:08:48] to this country that country
[1:08:50] and they were shocked because it's like
[1:08:52] it went beyond what luther did it went
[1:08:54] beyond what wesley did amen
[1:08:56] and the ba and well not the pentecostals
[1:08:59] it was them
[1:09:00] brother when god as god was increasing
[1:09:02] the revelation of his word
[1:09:04] increasing the anointing of his presence
[1:09:06] with them amen
[1:09:08] and then went further and further around
[1:09:10] the world amen
[1:09:11] it had an influence on more and more and
[1:09:14] more
[1:09:14] in the world amen well to all the seed
[1:09:17] of god
[1:09:18] that was ordained to believe it or the
[1:09:20] seed of god that was predestinated
[1:09:22] to believe the pentecostal revival to
[1:09:24] believe in the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:27] amen the gifts of the spirit amen coming
[1:09:30] into a oneness with god
[1:09:32] amen oh yes and knowing that when we say
[1:09:35] you think pentecost would believe this
[1:09:36] well i'll tell you this that there was a
[1:09:38] pentecostal generation
[1:09:40] amen under the pentecostal revival that
[1:09:42] was looking for the resurrection and the
[1:09:44] rapture
[1:09:45] and they thought that what oh what god's
[1:09:48] going to do for the resurrection
[1:09:49] what god's going to do for the rapture
[1:09:51] or they thought that god was going to do
[1:09:53] it in the pentecostal revival
[1:09:55] well the prophet god said he did it but
[1:09:57] they didn't recognize it
[1:09:58] amen he did yes he's and then it was in
[1:10:02] 1965 it might have been around in the
[1:10:05] easter during that time and the probably
[1:10:07] god was preaching
[1:10:08] and he said they don't realize that this
[1:10:10] is the capstone
[1:10:11] of the pentecostal passage and the
[1:10:13] pentecostal age
[1:10:15] amen and moved on into a bright age
[1:10:18] because pentecost rejected it amen the
[1:10:21] pentecostal denomination because they
[1:10:22] believe that you had to do this you had
[1:10:24] to do that you had you had to speak with
[1:10:26] tongues and you had
[1:10:27] was like i mentioned to our brother
[1:10:29] jonathan went after he ministered there
[1:10:32] all right so the prophet of god said
[1:10:33] they shall speak with tongues and he
[1:10:35] said revelation
[1:10:37] amen revelation now by the grace of god
[1:10:40] i've spoken with a gift of tongues but
[1:10:42] at the same time i speaking with tom
[1:10:45] with a a greater gift than just the
[1:10:48] the a different language like
[1:10:51] amen i'm speaks preaching revelation
[1:10:54] amen i'm preaching through it is it is a
[1:10:58] gift of tongues
[1:10:59] amen to say what god wants you to say
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:02] do you have that gift of tongues that
[1:11:04] you're going to testify what god wants
[1:11:06] you to testify out
[1:11:07] amen so brother says they shall speak
[1:11:09] with tongues
[1:11:10] and he said revelation amen and brother
[1:11:13] that's what we're speaking of
[1:11:14] and now and how many in the world
[1:11:16] understand the language that we are
[1:11:18] speaking amen this is tremendous amen
[1:11:21] when you're witnessing out there
[1:11:23] to what god has done what god is doing
[1:11:25] amen
[1:11:26] and some will see it and others don't
[1:11:29] they might they might catch a little
[1:11:30] here and catch a little there
[1:11:32] but they're not catching the fullness of
[1:11:34] the language
[1:11:35] amen that's like again
[1:11:39] our brother colombo brothers
[1:11:42] and it was joshua and ellie and they
[1:11:44] were saying brother journal
[1:11:45] uh can you speak with tongues no can you
[1:11:48] speak french
[1:11:49] no no i said i might be able to say a
[1:11:52] word here or there
[1:11:52] french and they said do you understand
[1:11:54] french i said oh yes i can understand
[1:11:57] if i pay attention to it i could have
[1:11:58] maybe just a a word here and a word
[1:12:01] there
[1:12:01] but maybe not completely amen because
[1:12:05] i'm not into that revelation amen
[1:12:08] but but again by the grace of god how
[1:12:11] many are into the revelation that god
[1:12:13] the the yeah that god is giving amen and
[1:12:16] he's speaking the language
[1:12:17] amen i'll tell you only the bride is
[1:12:18] going to understand it
[1:12:20] the bride's going to catch it amen god
[1:12:22] will say this and god will say that got
[1:12:24] to do this and got to do that
[1:12:26] and the rest of the world they don't
[1:12:27] know what what's what's he saying what's
[1:12:28] he talking about
[1:12:30] amen don't know it no i don't know that
[1:12:34] i don't understand that if if we just
[1:12:36] went out there
[1:12:37] and we preached you know uh the gifts of
[1:12:39] the spirit and
[1:12:40] and tongues and this and this oh yeah
[1:12:42] they'd understand that
[1:12:43] but we're going beyond the gifts to the
[1:12:46] giver
[1:12:48] amen most definitely but not putting the
[1:12:51] emphasis on
[1:12:51] on the gifts that's that's where
[1:12:53] pentecost failed
[1:12:55] amen so eventually the luther's doctrine
[1:12:58] became just just a doctrine amen the
[1:13:00] creed
[1:13:01] and whence these decreed the
[1:13:03] pentecostals and what what god had done
[1:13:05] what god was revealing through them
[1:13:07] it became a creed amen oh we believe we
[1:13:10] believe in this we believe in that
[1:13:11] amen but when god came down to
[1:13:14] with the capstone of the pentecostal
[1:13:16] message and the pentecostal age
[1:13:19] and god began to reveal this and reveal
[1:13:21] that
[1:13:22] no amen that's why they want that
[1:13:25] evangelist
[1:13:26] amen that we're again it was a world
[1:13:30] famous evangelist known around the world
[1:13:32] that
[1:13:33] he knew brother branham he met brother
[1:13:34] branham and he appreciated it
[1:13:37] he definitely appreciated the gifts that
[1:13:39] god had given the prophet
[1:13:41] amen and they recognize amen that they
[1:13:44] were special gifts
[1:13:46] when it comes to amen discerning the
[1:13:48] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:13:50] amen and this evangelist went over to
[1:13:52] brother branham
[1:13:53] and he said brother branham he said you
[1:13:56] should do this you do this do this
[1:13:58] and he said stop preaching those things
[1:14:01] that you preach and he said what was he
[1:14:04] preaching
[1:14:04] he was preaching against against
[1:14:06] worldliness he was preaching again
[1:14:08] concerning what the women were doing and
[1:14:10] how they were doing it what the man was
[1:14:11] doing how they were doing it
[1:14:12] and he said brother and he said no no no
[1:14:14] brother brahm you can't preach that
[1:14:16] and he said because they didn't want to
[1:14:18] hear it well he said if i don't preach
[1:14:20] it who's going to preach it
[1:14:21] and he said god wants us to preach it
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:25] because amen even that evangelist maybe
[1:14:27] he preached it in the early days of his
[1:14:29] ministry
[1:14:29] but as he started to get more famous and
[1:14:32] he was looking for more money
[1:14:33] more popularity amen he stopped
[1:14:35] preaching this stop preaching that
[1:14:37] amen and to shock you he was he was born
[1:14:40] and raised as it were
[1:14:41] a pentecostal christian
[1:14:45] amen he spoke in tongues he praised the
[1:14:47] lord hallelujah
[1:14:48] he was preaching and preaching it and
[1:14:50] just think amen
[1:14:52] just a few years before before the lord
[1:14:54] took him off the scene
[1:14:55] he went he left the pentecostal church
[1:14:57] and joined
[1:14:59] a methodist or something like that
[1:15:01] church what
[1:15:02] i was shocked when i read that i said
[1:15:05] what in the world did he do that for i
[1:15:07] said he's going back
[1:15:08] he's whatever the light god was that god
[1:15:10] gave him the revelation of the word
[1:15:12] i said he's turning it down and going
[1:15:13] back what was he doing it for
[1:15:16] he was he was doing it to get more
[1:15:19] support why because he wanted more money
[1:15:24] amen oh yeah and he went and he did this
[1:15:26] he went and he did that he built this he
[1:15:27] built that
[1:15:28] and so on amen brother and and and not
[1:15:32] only that it was another evangelist did
[1:15:33] the same thing
[1:15:34] and and and their motive and objective
[1:15:36] was to get more support more money
[1:15:39] from the people and they were
[1:15:40] compromising to do it
[1:15:42] amen until william brandon went out
[1:15:44] there one day and he was thinking about
[1:15:45] that
[1:15:46] and he said lord he's look what he's
[1:15:47] done and look now look what he got
[1:15:49] he got this big university and he got

[1:16:24] to be influenced by the lord jesus
[1:16:26] christ
[1:16:27] we want to be influenced by god we want
[1:16:28] to be influenced amen
[1:16:30] by what the holy spirit is doing in
[1:16:32] these last days
[1:16:34] amen and brother to know what god is
[1:16:36] doing to know what jesus is doing to
[1:16:38] know
[1:16:38] amen to know what god's required of us
[1:16:41] we've got to get back to the word
[1:16:43] amen and and then i just go back to

[1:16:57] what are the signs of the end
[1:16:59] the end time amen proving that god
[1:17:02] oh yeah he did that he did that and all
[1:17:05] the other ages he did it did it did it
[1:17:07] but what's he doing now
[1:17:09] amen by the grace of god through the
[1:17:12] prophet
[1:17:13] amen by the grace of god he's bringing
[1:17:16] forth the word he's bringing forth the
[1:17:18] revelation
[1:17:19] what for to give us the faith that we
[1:17:21] need
[1:17:22] amen and it's not when it comes to faith
[1:17:24] for the pentecostals and speaking in
[1:17:26] tongues
[1:17:27] and and these things and the gifts of
[1:17:29] the spirit no brother we need more than
[1:17:31] that
[1:17:32] and and again we know that that god
[1:17:34] didn't do away with the gifts

[1:17:39] is right there
[1:17:40] amen you can have access to that and
[1:17:42] access to that
[1:17:43] but brother it's not going to get you

[1:20:30] in control of you when it comes to the
[1:20:32] life you live

[1:20:38] brother because again the revelation
[1:20:40] with a that guy gave leather it
[1:20:42] controlled him
[1:20:43] oh yeah morning noon and night he was
[1:20:45] thanking god justif
[1:20:46] that he was justified and and wesley's
[1:20:49] message
[1:20:49] sanctification amen and the pentecostals
[1:20:53] all morning noon and night
[1:20:54] they were caught up with the anointing
[1:20:56] amen in the gifts of tongues and so on
[1:20:58] and he went on and on and on
[1:21:00] amen but it became a religion
[1:21:04] it became a denomination and brother
[1:21:06] what are the better
[1:21:07] believers of the message of what god has
[1:21:09] done
[1:21:10] oh yeah again there's just too many
[1:21:12] that's still hanging on to that
[1:21:14] what god has done in william branham and
[1:21:16] his ministry
[1:21:18] and brother that was a situation and i
[1:21:19] can see it right now
[1:21:21] that experience that i've had amen
[1:21:24] that why that as the as those back there
[1:21:27] that
[1:21:27] first came to the word first came to the
[1:21:29] message amen
[1:21:31] and and they were they were in oh
[1:21:32] goddess and a prophet god has sent a
[1:21:34] prophet
[1:21:35] amen and they went around the world
[1:21:37] preaching god has sent a prophet
[1:21:38] yeah but then there arose another
[1:21:41] generation that started to get into the
[1:21:43] word
[1:21:44] into the revelation of what god was
[1:21:47] doing
[1:21:48] yeah what he done what he did we
[1:21:50] believed but
[1:21:52] we were moving on in what he was doing
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:55] oh yeah and all that that generation
[1:21:58] they just preached god a son of prophet
[1:21:59] god has sent a prophet
[1:22:00] amen that's right but why did he send
[1:22:03] the prophet
[1:22:04] amen what did he do through the prophet
[1:22:08] amen there's the prophet for what did
[1:22:10] god do
[1:22:11] amen and then and they and they began to
[1:22:13] misunderstand
[1:22:15] the the younger generation that was
[1:22:17] coming up to explain
[1:22:18] oh this is what's going on now the
[1:22:20] revelation that jesus christ has come
[1:22:22] down
[1:22:23] the revelation that he's here to give us
[1:22:25] perfect rapturing faith to take us home
[1:22:28] let's focus on that amen let's have that
[1:22:31] faith
[1:22:31] well they had that faith oh yeah they
[1:22:33] they believed it
[1:22:35] and and that was their morning noon and
[1:22:36] night at night rather
[1:22:39] faith and they were goddess and a
[1:22:41] prophet that was what they were
[1:22:42] preaching
[1:22:42] the preachers preached it people went
[1:22:44] around and testified of it
[1:22:46] god has set a prophet but then arose
[1:22:48] another generation
[1:22:49] amen another generation and they begin
[1:22:53] to oh
[1:22:53] that's right he sent a prophet boom look
[1:22:56] what he did
[1:22:57] amen look what god's doing now amen
[1:22:59] praise the lord
[1:23:00] so we move on beyond the prophet to the
[1:23:03] revealed word that's
[1:23:04] ordained to give us resurrection and
[1:23:07] rapturing faith
[1:23:09] yeah so how many of us are getting more
[1:23:12] and more in line
[1:23:13] and in tune for the resurrection how
[1:23:16] many was getting more and more in line
[1:23:18] in two
[1:23:18] for the rapture amen brother because
[1:23:22] you remember again help me brother that
[1:23:26] all that luther was thinking about and
[1:23:28] preaching and talking about and
[1:23:30] witnessing and testifying
[1:23:31] justification the lutherans all
[1:23:35] justification justification and then on
[1:23:37] down to pentecostals all the baptism of
[1:23:39] the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit
[1:23:41] praise the lord
[1:23:42] amen that's what god was doing but they
[1:23:44] wanted
[1:23:45] they just stopped there they didn't want
[1:23:47] that didn't want to go any further
[1:23:49] oh we don't have to go any further look
[1:23:50] what god is doing oh it's the gift of
[1:23:52] the spirit his tongues
[1:23:54] amen yeah but there was another ministry
[1:23:57] to come
[1:23:59] amen the crowning of the pentecostal
[1:24:02] message
[1:24:02] but they didn't recognize that they
[1:24:04] thought all they had to do was receive
[1:24:06] the holy ghost speak in tongues
[1:24:08] amen believe god mom no no
[1:24:12] let's go on with god amen brother just
[1:24:15] saying
[1:24:16] god didn't stop with luther or wesley or
[1:24:18] the pentecostals
[1:24:19] and there was other other groups that
[1:24:21] god used but he kept moving on kept
[1:24:23] moving on by the grace of god
[1:24:25] amen brother there's a way that god
[1:24:27] wants us to believe it
[1:24:30] amen and what is the way that god wants
[1:24:32] us to believe it
[1:24:33] amen to believe it from the past tense
[1:24:37] to the present tense
[1:24:39] amen oh we believe what god has done god
[1:24:42] has done this god has done that amen but
[1:24:44] what's he doing
[1:24:45] and why why
[1:24:48] did god do that for luther why did god
[1:24:51] do that for wesley or the pentecostals
[1:24:53] and why has god done what he's done in
[1:24:56] william branham amen
[1:24:58] and brother don't worship william
[1:24:59] branham no no
[1:25:02] he's there to point us to jesus amen
[1:25:06] the same to see as john the baptist and
[1:25:08] jesus
[1:25:10] oh yeah there were those that were
[1:25:11] worshipping john the baptist no
[1:25:14] he said he said i i am not him he said
[1:25:16] i'm here i'll marry
[1:25:17] just to forerun him and introduce him
[1:25:19] amen and that's what john did
[1:25:22] you and he entered he baptized him in
[1:25:24] water
[1:25:25] and then he introduced him who he was oh
[1:25:28] yeah
[1:25:28] and brother same thing in this hour in
[1:25:30] this age when god revealed this god
[1:25:32] revealed that
[1:25:33] amen i praise the lord and then
[1:25:37] he said there's jesus amen he said
[1:25:40] that's the trouble with this generation
[1:25:42] he said they don't
[1:25:42] see the other angel amen oh yeah
[1:25:46] they saw william random they saw this
[1:25:48] they saw that but
[1:25:49] they never recognized jesus on the scene
[1:25:53] amen brother i'll tell you this
[1:25:56] as william branham has taught us he said
[1:25:58] now he said i can't do this
[1:26:00] and he said i got to wait for him to
[1:26:02] come on the scene and that was jesus
[1:26:05] amen god help us amen
[1:26:08] he was here to do this he was into that
[1:26:09] the dead was raised
[1:26:11] amen oh yeah even that ministry the dead
[1:26:14] was raised
[1:26:15] why because he who was and is the
[1:26:17] resurrection and the rapture was with us
[1:26:20] he has come down amen by the grace of
[1:26:24] god
[1:26:24] god help us to believe god help us
[1:26:27] that we're going to have the faith that
[1:26:30] that god has ordained for us to have
[1:26:34] through the message of the hour amen
[1:26:38] oh i believe the message of luther and
[1:26:40] i'm justified
[1:26:42] wesley i've sanctified it's done
[1:26:45] and the and the pentecostals the gifts
[1:26:47] of the spirit and so on
[1:26:49] i believe it amen i have that anointing
[1:26:52] in my soul
[1:26:53] praise the lord amen and i believe
[1:26:58] malachi 4. john the baptist
[1:27:02] amen turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:27:06] yeah listen now john the baptist was
[1:27:09] ordained
[1:27:09] to turn the hearts of the jewish fathers
[1:27:13] amen to the pentecostal children
[1:27:17] on the day of pentecost amen and
[1:27:20] the prophecy was again malachi 4 they
[1:27:23] said it's going to turn the hearts
[1:27:25] of the children back to the fathers
[1:27:30] amen amen turn our hearts back
[1:27:33] so that we believe god we believe the
[1:27:36] word
[1:27:37] amen that's why we're here tonight
[1:27:40] because
[1:27:41] we believe the word amen oh but
[1:27:45] th those out there they believe the word
[1:27:47] yes but it's not the word for this day
[1:27:50] amen they believe what god has
[1:27:53] done but they don't believe what god is
[1:27:56] doing amen and that's why
[1:28:00] that that those that don't believe it
[1:28:02] the way that god wants them to believe
[1:28:04] it
[1:28:04] amen they're going to miss the
[1:28:06] resurrection
[1:28:07] they're going to miss the rapture and
[1:28:09] again as i said they're going to say
[1:28:11] where is the rapture
[1:28:12] and that and as it's written it says
[1:28:14] it's already happened and you didn't
[1:28:16] know it
[1:28:17] amen why why because they never got into
[1:28:20] the revelation of what
[1:28:22] god was doing amen
[1:28:25] he was bringing us into fellowship with
[1:28:27] those that are gone on
[1:28:29] amen so that those who are gone on would
[1:28:32] come to us
[1:28:32] amen amen and meet us and that
[1:28:36] we recognizing it we're gonna be changed
[1:28:38] into glory
[1:28:39] and we'll be caught up with them to meet
[1:28:41] the lord in the air
[1:28:42] amen brother said the dead in christ
[1:28:46] shall rise first
[1:28:48] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:28:51] be caught up together
[1:28:52] with them amen but we got to be in the
[1:28:55] spirit
[1:28:56] and we got to be oh yes we got to have
[1:28:58] that faith
[1:29:00] believing believing believing what god
[1:29:02] is doing
[1:29:03] sensitive to what god is doing sensitive
[1:29:06] oh lord
[1:29:06] we're getting closer to it amen help us
[1:29:09] let go
[1:29:10] and let you have your way not my will
[1:29:12] father
[1:29:13] thing be done amen so grace and not
[1:29:17] brother that's going to be that that for
[1:29:19] who's going in the rapture
[1:29:20] it's those that that let god do it
[1:29:24] amen they recognize what he's doing and
[1:29:27] they're becoming a part of what he's
[1:29:29] doing
[1:29:29] amen he makes it flesh
[1:29:32] in them the resurrection the rapture
[1:29:35] praise the lord and again
[1:29:39] as i said i believe i mentioned the last
[1:29:40] sermon there concerning what they
[1:29:42] believe concerning the the dead
[1:29:45] and they think oh that the all the
[1:29:47] graves are going to change their
[1:29:50] brother this is dust though
[1:29:53] the dust shut they'll return that old
[1:29:56] body is cursed
[1:29:57] that whole body is going to stay it
[1:29:58] could be dust and stay dust
[1:30:00] amen and maybe that will be there too
[1:30:05] where the bible or not didn't say that
[1:30:07] ashes
[1:30:08] those that are those that are cremated
[1:30:10] to me that that's not biblical
[1:30:13] so i pray the grace of god because
[1:30:15] there's even believers so-called
[1:30:16] believers
[1:30:17] that are that are planning cremation
[1:30:22] that when they die they want to be
[1:30:23] cremated no
[1:30:25] again as one brother did approach me and
[1:30:28] said well
[1:30:29] did william branham say anything about
[1:30:31] cremation that's yes i said
[1:30:33] he only mentioned it once and i said he
[1:30:35] said that uh
[1:30:37] that the the righteous
[1:30:41] will walk it on the ashes of those that
[1:30:43] are cremated
[1:30:44] that's what the bible says in book of
[1:30:46] revelation
[1:30:47] these were cremated they were cremated
[1:30:49] in judgment and
[1:30:51] the righteous were walking on their
[1:30:52] ashes amen
[1:30:54] so i said what do you want to be
[1:30:57] you want the one the righteous to walk
[1:30:59] out or you won't be the the ashes
[1:31:01] i said for them to walk on amen
[1:31:04] so brother again just the idea oh well
[1:31:08] it's the cheapest
[1:31:09] well they part they put money before god
[1:31:12] the one was more interested in the in
[1:31:14] their financial situation
[1:31:16] rather than the spiritual amen you leave
[1:31:18] it with the lord
[1:31:19] by the grace of god amen
[1:31:23] so brother and again now god did permit
[1:31:26] a lot of believers down through the
[1:31:28] years they were they were
[1:31:30] burned you know and basically many of
[1:31:33] them were burned alive
[1:31:34] amen they laid down their lives graces
[1:31:37] of god
[1:31:37] amen but brother now in this hour in
[1:31:40] this age
[1:31:41] when we know what god word declares
[1:31:44] we're going to stay with the word amen
[1:31:48] and again if there's any question to
[1:31:50] forget it
[1:31:52] don't do it amen it could be the holy
[1:31:55] spirit
[1:31:56] bringing that question to you god help
[1:31:58] us
[1:32:00] brother let's believe it the way we
[1:32:02] should believe it
[1:32:03] unless brother we're not looking for
[1:32:05] death we're looking for life
[1:32:07] we're not learning well what am i going
[1:32:09] to do with this old body
[1:32:11] well god already told you what he's
[1:32:12] going to do with it it was he said ashes
[1:32:15] dusted us and so on so he come from dust
[1:32:19] he made it from dust and it's going back
[1:32:20] to dust
[1:32:21] no no he he didn't make it from ashes
[1:32:25] he said dust amen so brother in this
[1:32:28] hour are we
[1:32:29] truly truly sincerely believing the way
[1:32:32] god wants us to believe the way true
[1:32:35] seed of god
[1:32:36] true believers believe amen
[1:32:41] believe to the to the place where the
[1:32:43] word is made flesh in us
[1:32:46] amen believe the way god wants us to
[1:32:49] believe
[1:32:50] and god bringing israel out of egypt
[1:32:52] they didn't believe the way god wanted
[1:32:54] them to believe
[1:32:55] amen oh just signs and wonders yeah god
[1:32:59] did this god did that go
[1:33:00] moses you did this you did that they
[1:33:03] wanted god do it again
[1:33:04] god said no way amen
[1:33:08] so brother just bear with me to read
[1:33:10] some more of the word
[1:33:11] all right i come out and i felt i'd just
[1:33:14] be a few minutes
[1:33:17] and god help us amen oh yes i want to
[1:33:20] welcome our brother kingsley back here
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:24] god has put a king among us amen
[1:33:28] praise the lord and again reading from
[1:33:31] the
[1:33:32] deuteronomy there he said the lord has
[1:33:34] not given you an heart to
[1:33:36] perceive and eyes to see ears to hear on
[1:33:39] to this day
[1:33:40] but he's given us eyes to see ears to
[1:33:43] hear
[1:33:43] what god has done and what god is doing
[1:33:46] to get us out of time
[1:33:47] into eternity amen
[1:33:51] and he said again in verse 18 lest there
[1:33:53] should be among you
[1:33:54] man or woman or family or tribe whose
[1:33:57] heart turneth away
[1:34:00] this day from the lord our god
[1:34:03] to go and serve the gods of these
[1:34:06] nations
[1:34:07] lest there should be among you a root
[1:34:10] that beareth gall and wormwood
[1:34:14] and it came to pass when he heared the
[1:34:16] words of this curse
[1:34:18] that he blessed himself in his heart
[1:34:20] saying i shall have peace
[1:34:22] though i walk in the imagination of mine
[1:34:24] heart to
[1:34:26] add drunkenness to thirst the lord will
[1:34:29] not spare
[1:34:30] but then the anger of the lord and his
[1:34:32] jealousy shall smoke against that man
[1:34:35] and all the curses that are written in
[1:34:37] this book
[1:34:38] shall lie upon him and the lord shall
[1:34:40] blot out his name
[1:34:42] from under heaven amen and the lord
[1:34:45] shall separate him unto
[1:34:47] unto evil out of the tribes of israel
[1:34:51] according to all the curses of the
[1:34:53] covenant
[1:34:54] that are written in this book of the law
[1:34:59] and verse 29 he said the secret things
[1:35:02] belong
[1:35:02] unto the lord our god but those things
[1:35:05] which are revealed belong unto us
[1:35:09] and to our children forever that we may
[1:35:12] do
[1:35:12] all the words of the law amen
[1:35:16] and as the bible does say another place
[1:35:18] there that god is going to bring you
[1:35:20] home
[1:35:20] he's going to bring you back but he said
[1:35:23] and and to bless you
[1:35:24] he's going to bring your children that's
[1:35:26] good that's encouraging
[1:35:29] oh yes definitely encouraging you that's
[1:35:31] where you commit them to the lord
[1:35:33] amen praise the lord let's get back to
[1:35:36] first
[1:35:37] second corinthians again amen
[1:35:45] second corinthians chapter four
[1:35:48] and well we can start at verse one
[1:35:52] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[1:35:54] as we have received
[1:35:56] mercy we faint not amen
[1:36:01] but no not faint we should be encouraged
[1:36:05] we should be given more strength more
[1:36:07] encouragement amen
[1:36:09] thank god for justification thank god

[1:37:31] christ
[1:37:32] who is the image of god should shine
[1:37:35] unto them
[1:37:37] for we preach not ourselves

[1:38:55] is fulfilled amen
[1:38:58] he says do ye look on things after the
[1:39:01] outward appearance
[1:39:02] if man any man trust to himself that he

[1:55:43] you and have you to do
[1:55:45] so that you become a greater and a
[1:55:46] greater witness of jesus
[1:55:49] you're reflecting jesus amen not
[1:55:52] reflecting the devil
[1:55:53] you're reflecting jesus amen
[1:55:57] and your your your attention is not on
[1:56:00] self
[1:56:01] no no that's what the devil was doing
[1:56:03] with eve
[1:56:06] eve this is going to please you you're
[1:56:08] going to feel good with this you're
[1:56:10] going to like this
[1:56:11] oh that right oh yeah
[1:56:14] so she focused on on what she wanted and
[1:56:17] on our
[1:56:18] on our feelings but not on the word of
[1:56:20] god
[1:56:22] yeah remember the devil only added one
[1:56:24] word
[1:56:25] god said you shall surely die and satan
[1:56:28] said no
[1:56:30] he said that you he said i'll say but
[1:56:33] you shall not surely die i just added a
[1:56:36] word there
[1:56:37] well that's what he does today in your
[1:56:40] experience
[1:56:41] in your your relationship with jesus
[1:56:43] he's there to try and deceive you
[1:56:44] he's just trying to weaken you and what
[1:56:46] he'll do is if you're
[1:56:48] you're you're going to make this
[1:56:49] decision that decision oh
[1:56:51] yeah and satan is right there if you're
[1:56:53] making it you're going to leave with the
[1:56:54] lord
[1:56:55] satan is saying well you don't have to
[1:56:56] do this the lord won't mind you doing
[1:56:58] this the lord will might well
[1:57:01] you better talk to the lord about it
[1:57:08] and i speak those things because it's
[1:57:09] it's what i've experienced over all
[1:57:11] these years
[1:57:13] amen not my will father thine be done
[1:57:22] by grace a holy ghost bible faith
[1:57:25] will always seek to avoid attaching
[1:57:28] any selfish conditions to his prayer
[1:57:31] requests
[1:57:33] not what i want lord is what whatever
[1:57:35] your will is lord i'll accept it
[1:57:38] amen we are instructed to let our
[1:57:42] requests
[1:57:44] be known to god by prayer and
[1:57:46] supplication
[1:57:47] but faith does not tell god
[1:57:50] what to do or how to do it
[1:57:54] lord do this lord do that no lord not my
[1:57:57] will
[1:57:58] thy will be done amen i'm not going to
[1:58:02] tell god what to do
[1:58:03] i'll let god tell me what to do amen
[1:58:07] but it's amazing how many so-called
[1:58:09] believers
[1:58:10] expect god to answer prayer based on
[1:58:13] certain
[1:58:14] selfish preset conditions instead of
[1:58:17] just being prepared to accept
[1:58:19] the will of god amen
[1:58:24] see it's like the sister that
[1:58:27] went to jesus and she said lord
[1:58:31] i want she had two sons there and she
[1:58:33] want them to sit
[1:58:34] each one one under on the left one on
[1:58:37] the right hand of jesus
[1:58:38] yeah he's strong
[1:58:42] what that was a mother's
[1:58:45] love for natural love for for her sons
[1:58:50] and wanting to you know elevate them to
[1:58:52] this elevate them to that listen
[1:58:54] start down here and if they're humble
[1:58:57] god will bring them up yeah if you're
[1:58:59] really sincerely humble gotta bring them
[1:59:01] up
[1:59:02] see again it's like that brother that he
[1:59:05] was he moved from a certain place there
[1:59:06] at province
[1:59:08] in canada and he was working in a high
[1:59:11] position
[1:59:12] and he had a lot of money but
[1:59:15] he had i don't know many children that
[1:59:17] he had but
[1:59:18] and but there was no no church
[1:59:23] and he wanted he wanted to get to a
[1:59:24] church it was you know for his for his
[1:59:26] sons and
[1:59:26] our daughters or children whatever they
[1:59:28] were and so what he did was
[1:59:31] he quit the job that he had and it was a
[1:59:34] very powerful
[1:59:38] rich job and he quit it
[1:59:42] and he said i'm going to move you know
[1:59:44] what he became
[1:59:45] a janitor he moved to a certain city
[1:59:49] in another province in in canada and he
[1:59:52] became a janitor
[1:59:54] what yeah he became a janitor
[1:59:59] he did that for the glory of god he said
[2:00:01] thank the lord praise the lord now he
[2:00:03] had a
[2:00:04] he was going to church and having
[2:00:05] fellowship with the saints and the
[2:00:07] influence of
[2:00:08] of the word of for him for for his
[2:00:10] children and so on
[2:00:11] it was good so he was thanking the lord
[2:00:13] for that
[2:00:14] even though his salary was way down
[2:00:17] low but god blessed him
[2:00:22] and oh i don't think it was brother
[2:00:25] kingsley
[2:00:27] but he did end up with the same thing
[2:00:30] that our bullet kingsley is
[2:00:32] right there he started
[2:00:35] he he became the head of the janitorial
[2:00:38] business yeah

[2:00:42] janitorial business
[2:00:44] and god blessed him amen as we would
[2:00:47] pray our lord to bless our brother

[2:01:16] we let's be be prepared
[2:01:20] to accept the will of god and i'll tell
[2:01:23] you there's a lot of
[2:01:25] believers they're not there to accept
[2:01:27] god's will
[2:01:29] why because they feel that it's not
[2:01:31] their will
[2:01:32] this is not my i want this or they feel
[2:01:34] i need this
[2:01:35] what you need is god's will well i need
[2:01:39] this i need that
[2:01:40] well get god's will first and he and
[2:01:42] he'll give you anything else you feel
[2:01:44] you need
[2:01:45] and he if he fails you really need it
[2:01:47] he'll give it to you
[2:01:49] amen brother sister god help us to have
[2:01:51] faith
[2:01:52] in god and of us to live for god
[2:01:56] elvis amen to be more and more conscious
[2:01:58] of god
[2:02:00] amen brother not just a historical book
[2:02:03] like we
[2:02:04] don't think this is an history in in the
[2:02:06] bible there
[2:02:07] no brother it's a revelation of god's
[2:02:10] personal relationship with you and
[2:02:12] me amen
[2:02:17] listen it's not
[2:02:20] mental or intellectual faith
[2:02:26] that most have it is a perverted faith
[2:02:31] he said and this is this is what the
[2:02:32] devil deceived even to doing
[2:02:35] and what did she do she put selfish
[2:02:37] desires
[2:02:38] ahead of god's perfect will
[2:02:41] amen god help us
[2:02:45] to seek the will of god not my will
[2:02:48] father
[2:02:49] thine be done amen
[2:02:53] i'll try to finish with just a couple of
[2:02:54] quotes here
[2:02:58] amen
[2:03:00] and it was the message perfect faith in
[2:03:02] 1963
[2:03:06] and he said when a man lives by faith
[2:03:09] walks by faith
[2:03:10] i mean substance faith is isolated from
[2:03:13] the
[2:03:13] entire world and becomes a new creature
[2:03:17] in christ there now he says you're
[2:03:20] getting into bright material
[2:03:23] you're getting into a rapturing
[2:03:25] condition amen
[2:03:28] brother substance faith
[2:03:32] it is the substance of things over and
[2:03:35] the evidence of things not seen
[2:03:38] amen and he said that means for each one
[2:03:41] of us
[2:03:42] not just the pastor the deacons or the
[2:03:44] trustees that means for the laity
[2:03:47] every individual walks in a world with
[2:03:49] god alone
[2:03:50] amen and you're baptized into this
[2:03:53] kingdom and there's nobody in there but
[2:03:55] you and god
[2:03:56] and he gives the orders and you pack
[2:03:58] them out and whatever he says
[2:04:00] there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere
[2:04:03] amen
[2:04:03] you walk right on and if the lord says
[2:04:06] this there's nobody in the world can
[2:04:08] talk you out of it
[2:04:10] and if you go right on just the same and
[2:04:12] he said you're coming into a perfect
[2:04:14] faith
[2:04:15] perfect perfection that cannot fail amen
[2:04:20] and he said yes he was a mystic to them
[2:04:24] with his perfect faith and so is it now
[2:04:27] with those who have perfect faith are a
[2:04:29] mystic to others
[2:04:31] amen and we are taught to resist the
[2:04:35] devil
[2:04:37] and he will flee from us amen
[2:04:40] now he said to resist is just to just
[2:04:44] simply turn him down
[2:04:46] just resist him and that is just the way
[2:04:49] walk away from him and god said a
[2:04:51] certain thing no matter what he's trying
[2:04:53] to tell you
[2:04:54] you don't even listen to him he said
[2:04:56] your ears are deaf
[2:04:57] to anything else but what the spirit
[2:05:00] says
[2:05:01] amen and he said to e that at the near
[2:05:05] that listens see what the spirit saith
[2:05:07] unto the churches
[2:05:09] he said the one that's got the listening
[2:05:11] post
[2:05:12] amen he said that catches what the
[2:05:15] spirit says
[2:05:16] amen the spirit of god not the spirit of
[2:05:20] the devil
[2:05:21] amen let's be on our guard because satan
[2:05:24] is there
[2:05:25] amen to get us to focus on self
[2:05:30] amen but we want to give the glory to
[2:05:32] jesus
[2:05:33] amen
[2:05:39] listen
[2:05:44] say i'll finish with a couple of quotes
[2:05:46] here
[2:05:48] he said i think a pastor if he is called
[2:05:50] to be a pastor
[2:05:51] he should be a pastor and i want all
[2:05:54] god's peoples to know
[2:05:56] that that pastor has just as much
[2:05:59] right to pray for the sick as any any
[2:06:01] other person
[2:06:03] and he said now he said get this real
[2:06:05] close
[2:06:06] there is no one in the world that could
[2:06:08] do one thing
[2:06:09] for you towards divine healing only to
[2:06:13] get you to believe in what jesus
[2:06:15] has already done
[2:06:19] god helped us to believe
[2:06:22] because he he did say in another place
[2:06:25] he said
[2:06:26] if you can't believe for healing now
[2:06:27] you're going to believe for the rapture
[2:06:32] rapture is the complete change of the
[2:06:33] body
[2:06:36] so if you can't believe for healing the
[2:06:37] body are you going to wait for the
[2:06:38] rapture
[2:06:41] he said there is no one in the world
[2:06:43] that could do one thing for you
[2:06:45] towards divine healing only to get you
[2:06:47] to believe
[2:06:48] in what jesus has already done people
[2:06:51] say i
[2:06:52] have the i have healing power in my
[2:06:54] hands that's wrong
[2:06:56] he said there's no such a thing as that
[2:06:59] yeah or sometimes in your loud voices
[2:07:02] like t.l osborn
[2:07:05] and in the in the film of brother
[2:07:07] branham that we had played here not long
[2:07:09] ago
[2:07:10] and brother brown was preaching speaks
[2:07:14] to them
[2:07:14] and then then he's behind the pope there
[2:07:17] waiting for the angel to come waiting
[2:07:18] for the pillar fire to come in
[2:07:20] and so on and uh
[2:07:24] i wasn't aware of it that t.l osborne
[2:07:26] was in that meeting
[2:07:29] he was yes he was yeah
[2:07:33] and he said i and he said and what
[2:07:35] shocked him
[2:07:38] concerning william branham and his
[2:07:39] ministry he said well
[2:07:43] he said oh it shocked me he said i i
[2:07:46] just
[2:07:46] oh what's going on here i don't
[2:07:48] understand this he said because he said
[2:07:49] i i'm a very
[2:07:51] noisy he said pentecostal
[2:07:54] when it comes to praying for the sick
[2:07:56] because they would as pentecostal
[2:07:58] evangelists they would lay ends on
[2:07:59] on on a sick person and then they would
[2:08:03] shake them or do this with them do that
[2:08:04] one then they would scream
[2:08:06] shame come out get away
[2:08:10] what and here he said is william branham
[2:08:15] and he said he's standing there and he
[2:08:18] just says
[2:08:19] oh oh he said this is your problem
[2:08:22] right low his voice was right low and
[2:08:25] then
[2:08:25] oh one person there said oh
[2:08:28] always that's the devil he said this
[2:08:31] that's in this child
[2:08:33] and he went over and he laid his hands
[2:08:34] right gentle he was very gentle on the
[2:08:37] child
[2:08:38] and he's very quiet in his voice and he
[2:08:41] said satan
[2:08:42] in the name of jesus christ come out of
[2:08:45] the child
[2:08:46] enter no more into her in the name of
[2:08:49] our lord jesus christ
[2:08:52] and within a few seconds brother brown
[2:08:55] said
[2:08:55] oh he said satan is gone
[2:08:59] he said he left the child he won't be
[2:09:01] back he said praise the lord wonderful
[2:09:04] all right he says sister he said go on
[2:09:06] praise the lord
[2:09:08] and theologian was in the balcony there
[2:09:10] somewhere in the audience and he said i
[2:09:12] was shocked he said why
[2:09:15] what he never even screamed at him
[2:09:18] he said he was right quiet and he
[2:09:22] and he said i and i watched it again and
[2:09:23] he did it again
[2:09:26] i said my what's going on here
[2:09:29] why don't you why one willing random
[2:09:30] scream why won't he ball at him
[2:09:33] no because it was faith faith is not
[2:09:36] noisy
[2:09:37] not that not that faith of praying for
[2:09:39] the sick no no
[2:09:41] but god don't make don't matter if we're
[2:09:44] lord if you get noisy and
[2:09:45] praise the lord amen but when it comes
[2:09:48] to your power over the devil
[2:09:50] no faith no matter how
[2:09:53] quiet you are your faith is in the word
[2:09:57] of god
[2:09:58] satan satan to recognize it satan knows
[2:10:03] amen if anyone recognizes your faith the
[2:10:05] devil does
[2:10:07] yeah amen so brother
[2:10:10] brother osborne tommy of course he died
[2:10:13] a few years ago
[2:10:15] and uh he was one of the evangelists
[2:10:18] that was really appreciating
[2:10:20] brother brown's ministry yeah he and he
[2:10:23] loved brother branham
[2:10:25] so i pray grace lord help us have faith
[2:10:28] amen
[2:10:30] that's why he said i'm a noisy
[2:10:31] pentecostal because when he prayed for
[2:10:33] the sick the pentecostals prayed for the
[2:10:35] sake they had
[2:10:36] raised their voice a loud voice and
[2:10:38] condemned that devil shaped the person
[2:10:41] well but if you're using faith you don't
[2:10:43] have to shake them you don't have the
[2:10:45] ball at them
[2:10:45] just speak the word amen praise the lord
[2:10:51] so he said again
[2:10:56] they may be honestly you know he said
[2:10:58] people say i have healing power in my
[2:11:00] hands
[2:11:01] or or a loud voice no
[2:11:06] no it's faith and he said there's no
[2:11:09] such a thing as that that's wrong
[2:11:11] and he said you just get away from that
[2:11:13] and he said when anyone says that you
[2:11:15] know
[2:11:16] and he said they may be honestly but
[2:11:17] ignorantly interpreting god's terms of
[2:11:20] divine healing
[2:11:21] amen for no one no matter who it is
[2:11:25] no one could already do what jesus has
[2:11:28] already done
[2:11:29] he shall for healing was in the
[2:11:31] redemption the redemptive blessing
[2:11:34] amen one of them is divine healing
[2:11:38] and jesus paid the full price at calvary
[2:11:42] amen and the only thing you do is accept
[2:11:46] it
[2:11:47] he said but i couldn't forgive our one
[2:11:49] sin sin of yours
[2:11:51] but god has already done it and you have
[2:11:54] to accept it
[2:11:55] in christ amen
[2:11:59] he said jesus paid the full penalty for
[2:12:02] sin when he died
[2:12:04] now he said we'll never do you no good
[2:12:06] until you accept it
[2:12:08] you have to accept it and then he said
[2:12:11] it's not hard
[2:12:13] how hard you cry no how much you beg
[2:12:16] how much you persuade it's a surrender
[2:12:19] art
[2:12:21] to god with faith believing
[2:12:24] what he did amen
[2:12:27] and he said even our altar calls in
[2:12:30] bringing people up around the altar
[2:12:32] and he said they didn't do that in the
[2:12:34] bible time that's a tradition of our
[2:12:36] people
[2:12:37] originated formally in the methodist
[2:12:40] church
[2:12:40] but look it's a good thing i don't like
[2:12:43] this dry-eyed repentance
[2:12:46] he said i like to see somebody get up
[2:12:48] and really be sorry for what they've
[2:12:50] done
[2:12:51] and really mean it
[2:12:55] no matter how much that you pray you
[2:12:57] will never be
[2:12:58] forgiven until you believe you are
[2:13:01] forgiven
[2:13:02] amen and it says
[2:13:05] and no one will know no matter how much
[2:13:08] you cry how much you pray
[2:13:10] how much you shout how many times you
[2:13:12] speak with tongues
[2:13:13] whatever you do you're still not he said
[2:13:16] until the fruits of the spirit
[2:13:18] bear record in you for by their fruits
[2:13:21] ye shall know them amen
[2:13:28] above everything that you do love one
[2:13:31] another
[2:13:32] and as you love one another you will
[2:13:34] love god and these things
[2:13:37] that are going on and taking place in
[2:13:39] the meeting
[2:13:40] are only vindication of his presence
[2:13:43] with us
[2:13:44] amen god's grace
[2:13:47] amen we could go on but we'll leave it
[2:13:49] there
[2:13:51] god's grace that we have the faith
[2:13:54] that is substance the faith that
[2:13:58] is real amen it's just not a feeling
[2:14:03] no it is life by the grace of god
[2:14:07] the lord bless you let's stand
[2:14:12] the lord
[2:14:20] amen let's see

[2:14:34] up the steeps of light
