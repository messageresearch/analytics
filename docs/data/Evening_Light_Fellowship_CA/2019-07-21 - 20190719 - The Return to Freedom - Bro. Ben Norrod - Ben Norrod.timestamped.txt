[1:06:00] Christian tonight
[1:06:02] Amen certainly happy in the Lord happy
[1:06:05] to be a Christian a man happy to have
[1:06:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:06:10] without it you know brother
[1:06:12] we don't have much hope laying ahead of
[1:06:13] us I hope you realize that we're not
[1:06:16] born again we're in trouble
[1:06:18] amen but us this got the token applied
[1:06:20] let the death angel pass God's Brides
[1:06:24] safe at last Amen absolutely right amen
[1:06:28] I want to I want to try to go a couple
[1:06:31] places here this evening just as we get
[1:06:33] started into the thoughts that I won't
[1:06:36] try to if it'll will help us lay a
[1:06:37] foundation for the entire weekend I'm
[1:06:40] gonna start Leviticus chapter 25 amen
[1:06:43] pick up on verse 39 well speak to you
[1:06:47] tonight on the return to freedom return
[1:06:51] to freedom vitals probably heard some of
[1:06:55] this already in Edmondson but believe me
[1:06:57] when I tell you I may read the same
[1:06:59] scriptures but it ain't the same message
[1:07:01] amen amen I guarantee every time you
[1:07:04] preach something that ends up being a
[1:07:06] little different amen but with
[1:07:08] evangelism you know that's something you
[1:07:09] you kind of abide by a theme when you
[1:07:12] preach and the theme or the message
[1:07:15] you're trying to get across is not
[1:07:16] really the message here but it's what
[1:07:18] you're trying to use to get across and
[1:07:20] I've noticed many times that you can
[1:07:22] take the same sermon preached at
[1:07:24] different places and depending on you
[1:07:25] depending on you now you're the one that
[1:07:27] works that depending on what you need
[1:07:29] that's where the message will go tonight
[1:07:31] amen and so we don't try to get any
[1:07:33] preconceived idea I just got my notes
[1:07:35] laying here and if Lord wants to use
[1:07:36] them he can use them but not then we go
[1:07:38] wherever he wants a mess it's the way it
[1:07:40] works Leviticus 25 and let's pick up
[1:07:42] verse 39 and if thy brother that
[1:07:45] dwelleth mighty beewax and poor and be
[1:07:47] sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him
[1:07:51] to serve as a bondservant but as a hired
[1:07:54] servant and as a Sojourner
[1:07:56] he shall be with thee and shall serve
[1:07:58] thee unto the year of Jubilee I watch
[1:08:02] here in verse 39 again thou shalt not
[1:08:05] compel him to serve as a bond servant
[1:08:08] and I watch this verse 40 but as a hired
[1:08:11] servant now here's the reason why God
[1:08:14] had its place just this way
[1:08:16] one reason that you have to remember
[1:08:18] about the people that you're talking
[1:08:20] about is these are covenant people these
[1:08:22] are people that have been circumcised on
[1:08:24] the eighth day they're following the
[1:08:26] lineage of Abraham they're the called
[1:08:29] out the church the chosen the
[1:08:30] predestinated the cold you can't treat
[1:08:33] such people like slaves they already had
[1:08:37] a birthright so God said treat them as a
[1:08:40] hired servant if a man falls into debt
[1:08:42] treat him as a hired servant but don't
[1:08:45] you treat him as a slave why because
[1:08:47] he's already got a covenant he's already
[1:08:48] in his for life right now watch and he
[1:08:51] shall serve thee unto the year of
[1:08:53] Jubilee and then shall he depart from
[1:08:56] thee both he and his children with him
[1:08:59] and shall return unto his own family and
[1:09:03] under the possession of his father's
[1:09:05] shall he return I tell you what let's
[1:09:08] pray ask the Lord to help us I'll let
[1:09:10] you be seated we'll catch these other
[1:09:12] texts in just a moment father we thank
[1:09:14] you tonight for the word Lord Jesus what
[1:09:16] a privilege it is for us to be gathered
[1:09:18] here tonight old God in the auspice of
[1:09:21] the presence of the king we love you
[1:09:23] Lord and as we've got an audience before
[1:09:25] you tonight we're asking that you'll
[1:09:27] come and take your word and that you'll
[1:09:29] anoint me as a speaker them as a
[1:09:31] listener anoint the pages of what will
[1:09:33] be read and said and God may you just
[1:09:35] come down tonight and do whatever it is
[1:09:37] you want to do Lord we yield ourselves
[1:09:39] completely to the mind and the hand of
[1:09:42] great Jehovah God give us thy favour
[1:09:44] tonight Lord Jesus as we look into your
[1:09:45] word in Jesus Christ's name Amen and
[1:09:48] amen and the church said amen amen you
[1:09:52] may be seated
[1:09:53] that's a rule in a Pentecostal church
[1:09:54] did you know that you had to say a good
[1:09:56] hearty Amen for you loud to be seated
[1:09:58] that's a rule in Pentecostal churches
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:02] you need no hot done by the Chatterley
[1:10:03] today man I guarantee hey man don't feel
[1:10:06] bad boy that's the way I do it
[1:10:08] you may ever hear me and pull an I yeah
[1:10:10] you thank you something hey listen I
[1:10:13] almost get hoarse so I get more hoarse
[1:10:14] and the preacher dad's pulling on the
[1:10:16] word hey man I like it I like I like a
[1:10:19] good worshipful a man and a praise the
[1:10:21] Lord I think God deserves it I mean I
[1:10:23] think he deserves it he absolutely
[1:10:25] deserves all of it
[1:10:26] now I want to direct your attention now
[1:10:28] to Exodus chapter 21 and I want to look
[1:10:31] at verse 2 and kind of come on down just
[1:10:34] a few verses now mind you you brethren
[1:10:35] in Edmonton out that I you you'll hear
[1:10:37] similar things but it ain't gonna be the
[1:10:39] same message I promise there's a lot of
[1:10:41] different things that you can bring into
[1:10:42] this and sometimes I might have 40
[1:10:45] messages wrapped up into one context and
[1:10:47] I like to keep my messages real full and
[1:10:50] thick and just keep everything packed in
[1:10:53] there because I never know what time
[1:10:54] that the devil is gonna pull something
[1:10:55] and I'll need a new piece of Arsenal to
[1:10:57] go after him a man so I like to keep it
[1:11:00] nice and packed in there and I've got so
[1:11:03] much material tonight I'll be honest
[1:11:04] with you three services would never
[1:11:06] cover what it is I want to try to get to
[1:11:07] you this weekend but God helping us I'm
[1:11:10] going to try to hit the high spots of my
[1:11:11] thoughts and then that way we got
[1:11:13] different preachers sitting here tonight
[1:11:15] they'll be able to dig into these things
[1:11:17] and be able to break it down and bring
[1:11:19] the messages in the coming weeks which i
[1:11:21] think is one of the benefits of being an
[1:11:23] evangelist that you can bring and just
[1:11:25] lay it out there and then the other
[1:11:26] ministries can grab it and keep running
[1:11:28] with it in the coming weeks I've always
[1:11:30] said that Impe reaching I like to build
[1:11:32] a platform so the one I leave there
[1:11:34] everybody can take one step up and come
[1:11:36] up a little bit higher than what there
[1:11:38] was the time before and I feel like if
[1:11:40] we can't come higher then really the
[1:11:42] preaching is no benefit and it doesn't
[1:11:44] do us any good just to get up here and
[1:11:46] read a bunch of statements and put some
[1:11:47] words together except it benefit us and
[1:11:50] edify us it's not really even fulfilling
[1:11:52] what jesus promised that we do when he
[1:11:55] would send these gifts back to the earth
[1:11:56] and that was to edify or perfect the
[1:11:59] body of Jesus Christ that comes by the
[1:12:01] word that comes by your revelation in
[1:12:03] the word that comes by the blood of
[1:12:05] Jesus Christ cleansing you from all sin
[1:12:08] and preaching is important because what
[1:12:10] we need to understand is that part of
[1:12:12] the way that the Bride of Christ
[1:12:14] is ever going to hear truth is going to
[1:12:16] come by the preaching of the gospel I've
[1:12:19] said this a million times allow me to
[1:12:20] say two million and
[1:12:21] on one reason that people they say
[1:12:23] they're against preachers are never
[1:12:25] going to make the rapture if they're
[1:12:26] against a preacher is because the very
[1:12:28] one Jesus Christ who's bringing us into
[1:12:30] a rapture is a preacher himself amen and
[1:12:33] you got to hear him you've got to hear
[1:12:34] his message in order to get yourself in
[1:12:37] a condition to get rapture ready or
[1:12:38] resurrection ready everywhere the Lord
[1:12:40] would take you now preaching is
[1:12:42] important because as we're going to read
[1:12:44] in just a moment that these that were
[1:12:46] out working in the field now from a
[1:12:48] natural perspective you look at this
[1:12:50] from maybe the outside looking in we
[1:12:52] would say it doesn't really look like
[1:12:54] it's that big of a deal here you got a
[1:12:56] man that's falling into debt he owes
[1:12:58] some money and he can't pay the thing
[1:13:00] off maybe his farms went belly-up and he
[1:13:02] has a rich uncle so he goes to his uncle
[1:13:05] and he says hey buddy I need some help
[1:13:06] he says alright I'll help you with your
[1:13:08] debt but I can't just give you
[1:13:10] everything I got and be left penniless I
[1:13:12] need help I need you to help me work and
[1:13:14] do things maybe around the farm so he
[1:13:17] would hire himself out as a hired
[1:13:19] servant he'd go out into the field he'd
[1:13:21] milk cows he raised corn crops everybody
[1:13:23] does and he would work himself you
[1:13:25] remember the story with Jacob how that
[1:13:27] he worked seven years to get Rachel and
[1:13:29] then he ended up getting the ugly one
[1:13:30] Leah I mean sorry for the LEAs it might
[1:13:32] be hiding in here somewhere
[1:13:33] amen but then he gets the pretty one
[1:13:36] that he loved at the very beginning on
[1:13:37] down the road and of course his working
[1:13:40] it out was because he was in a debt of
[1:13:43] needing the money for the dowry and for
[1:13:45] the arrangement of the marriage and so
[1:13:47] as a hired servant he would go into
[1:13:49] working now from the outside looking in
[1:13:51] that ain't that big of a deal most of us
[1:13:53] that are living in someway of debt
[1:13:55] whether it's a house payment or some car
[1:13:57] payment or something like that we go to
[1:13:59] work every single day or we go to work
[1:14:01] five days a week every how you work and
[1:14:03] you work and work and work and work you
[1:14:05] don't let sleep come to your eyes until
[1:14:07] you knock the thing out and you're done
[1:14:09] with it that's the same principle as
[1:14:11] what it was in Israel now you and you're
[1:14:13] on your job you can either walk in or
[1:14:15] you can walk out you have the freedom to
[1:14:17] do whatever you want I like what a guy
[1:14:19] said to me many many years ago when I
[1:14:21] was working as a as just a young teenage
[1:14:23] boy and in the factory and he said I
[1:14:26] would want to do that I'd get fired he
[1:14:29] said hey pal I was looking for a job
[1:14:30] when I found this one he said
[1:14:32] amen so see we're hired servants not
[1:14:35] slavery now if this was a slave time you
[1:14:37] wouldn't be able to have permission to
[1:14:39] come and go as you please
[1:14:40] but a hired servant has rights to have
[1:14:43] freedoms that they can exercise at any
[1:14:46] time they desired now there was
[1:14:48] penalties for a man that would have a
[1:14:49] debt and not pay his debt and many of
[1:14:51] the children of Israel knew what that
[1:14:53] penalty would be not only would it bring
[1:14:54] a slander against the names of the
[1:14:56] family and the people associated there
[1:14:58] but it would also bring a shame upon all
[1:15:01] the future generations so these men they
[1:15:04] knew the magnitude of what it would take
[1:15:06] to be able to go out there and take care
[1:15:08] of their own business so they would work
[1:15:09] and they work as a hired servant and
[1:15:12] listen friend there was no shame and
[1:15:13] then working as a hired servant nobody
[1:15:15] would look down on them nobody would
[1:15:17] call them scum or good we're good for
[1:15:19] nothing or ever what am I say but they
[1:15:21] were doing what they had to do as a
[1:15:23] requirement of paying off the debt so
[1:15:26] the law made a provision and remember
[1:15:28] friends there were ten commandments
[1:15:30] given in the original book ten
[1:15:32] commandments that Moses come on off the
[1:15:33] mountain but as you're dealing with
[1:15:35] people and as always people are it's
[1:15:37] going to take a whole lot more intend to
[1:15:39] solve their problems so there's all
[1:15:41] kinds of amendments that was made not so
[1:15:43] much amendments but addendums if you
[1:15:46] will or additions made to the ten
[1:15:48] commandments for example if a man was
[1:15:50] out chopping wood in the woods and his
[1:15:52] axe handle flew off and hit another guy
[1:15:54] and killed him there had to be a
[1:15:55] provision made for that individual
[1:15:57] because of this accidental death he
[1:16:00] couldn't just say thou shalt not kill
[1:16:01] and then here is he's dead and you've
[1:16:03] killed him and we're gonna stone you
[1:16:04] without mercy so they would make all of
[1:16:06] these provisions in the law in order to
[1:16:09] give the person an opportunity to be
[1:16:11] able to do things justly I for an eye
[1:16:13] tooth for a tooth year for an ear and
[1:16:15] every what it might be now when this man
[1:16:17] would be working in this field trying to
[1:16:19] pay off his debt there was another law
[1:16:21] placed in there the law of Jubilee and
[1:16:24] at the Jubilee sounding or the trumpet
[1:16:26] sounding of Jubilee there was a certain
[1:16:28] set time every fifty days or every fifty
[1:16:32] years of water of his 50th excuse me 50
[1:16:34] days pardon me years months knees I'm
[1:16:36] all mixed up see Bob this is why I need
[1:16:38] you keep me straight boy I get all mixed
[1:16:40] up now the 50th day which would be
[1:16:43] Pentecost or the year of Jubilee
[1:16:45] that 50th time no matter how small the
[1:16:48] debt no matter how great the dead no
[1:16:50] matter what kind of burden the man might
[1:16:52] have been under if he was out in the
[1:16:53] field he had a hole or a plough or
[1:16:55] whatever you had his hands on he could
[1:16:57] just walk away from it throw it down for
[1:16:59] Moses said his debt will be completely
[1:17:02] cleared off now we understand looking at
[1:17:04] this from a natural perspective hey this
[1:17:06] ain't no big deal but remember by the
[1:17:09] brother Ben taught us that the Spirit of
[1:17:10] God was hiding himself in all of these
[1:17:14] little scenarios in the Bible when you'd
[1:17:16] see an individual come such as Ruth when
[1:17:18] you look at the Book of Ruth then four
[1:17:20] little chapters in there you don't think
[1:17:22] a whole lot about it oh my you know just
[1:17:24] a woman that fell in love with a man and
[1:17:26] as man the man's name was Boaz and she
[1:17:28] just fell in love with Boaz Hey ain't no
[1:17:30] big deal but God was hiding in the life
[1:17:33] of Ruth to play out a spiritual type
[1:17:35] that when it was happening the devil
[1:17:37] couldn't recognize it how many women
[1:17:39] were falling in love with men in that
[1:17:40] day there might have been many Ruth's
[1:17:42] there might have been many Boaz's come
[1:17:44] on somebody amen but God was hiding
[1:17:47] himself down in the lives of these
[1:17:49] individuals so that he might take a
[1:17:51] whole mystery and put it together with
[1:17:54] the parts of these individuals lives so
[1:17:57] here this individual he's working as
[1:17:58] dead he's out there paying off his debt
[1:18:00] now to the devil or to anybody else
[1:18:02] might not have been no big thing he's
[1:18:04] working this dead out praise God and
[1:18:06] hallelujah he's being an honest man but
[1:18:08] in a spiritual sense of this God was
[1:18:11] absolutely showing that no matter how
[1:18:13] much we fall into spiritual dead at the
[1:18:16] sounding of the jubilee trumpet we could
[1:18:19] go free can you say Amen amen now let's
[1:18:22] turn in the Bible for just a moment hold
[1:18:24] your place there in Exodus for just a
[1:18:26] moment and let's go to the Book of Luke
[1:18:27] for just a moment I just got a scripture
[1:18:30] coming on my mind I want to bring in
[1:18:31] right now Luke chapter 4 verses 18 and
[1:18:34] 19 now this is Jesus who is going to
[1:18:37] preach what he says the acceptable year
[1:18:40] of the Lord now you know what the
[1:18:41] acceptable years that's the year of
[1:18:43] Jubilee if you want to find that brother
[1:18:45] Bream tells us that in this day the
[1:18:47] scripture fulfilled he tells us about
[1:18:49] how that the one who preached there in
[1:18:51] jeffersonville in 65 this states in Part
[1:18:54] B junior high school if you're trying to
[1:18:56] find it or look it up and brother Brahim
[1:18:58] is preaching image
[1:18:59] join him two congregations is on a split
[1:19:01] side either way it could go this school
[1:19:03] of thought or that school of thought a
[1:19:05] man here's brother Bram standing in the
[1:19:06] gap giving us this day the scripture
[1:19:08] fulfilled
[1:19:09] it's a beautiful message I love it amen
[1:19:11] but he says in there that the year of
[1:19:13] the acceptable year was the year of
[1:19:15] Jubilee now watch her Luke 4:18 the
[1:19:16] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:19:19] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:19:21] the poor see there Jesus was a preacher
[1:19:23] hey man Jesus didn't just push play and
[1:19:25] obey he wasn't just reading the scrolls
[1:19:29] come on somebody he was preaching the
[1:19:32] gospel that's how God does it amen
[1:19:34] anytime the elect is help it comes
[1:19:36] through preaching that's God's Way I'm
[1:19:38] going to show you that in just a moment
[1:19:39] help the Lord now watch yes anointed me
[1:19:41] to preach he has sent me to heal the
[1:19:43] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:19:45] the captives recovering of sight to the
[1:19:47] blind and to set at liberty them that
[1:19:50] are bruised and here comes to preach the
[1:19:52] acceptable year of the Lord now notice
[1:19:55] that if they're poor if they're
[1:19:57] brokenhearted if their captives if
[1:19:59] they're blind if they're absolutely
[1:20:01] bruised in spirit or in heart he come to
[1:20:04] pay off whatever debt or whatever
[1:20:06] bondage would be holding them whatever
[1:20:09] debt that need to be paid off after year
[1:20:11] of Jubilee Jesus come to take care of
[1:20:13] every bit of that and then you realize
[1:20:15] what he was speaking of he was speaking
[1:20:17] of the atonement where his blood would
[1:20:19] be shed for all the humanity for all of
[1:20:22] the world and by shedding his blood if
[1:20:24] you're sick if you're halt you're
[1:20:26] withered you're blind or whatever it is
[1:20:27] he would pay off the sin debt that was
[1:20:30] created in the Garden of Eden and
[1:20:32] everything that followed us down to this
[1:20:34] time will be stricken off our record
[1:20:36] where we can be set free amen but you
[1:20:39] say I still get headaches I still get
[1:20:41] back aches I still get too excited
[1:20:43] heartaches yes but the payments already
[1:20:45] been made your debt has been paid off
[1:20:47] just give it a little time child and
[1:20:49] when that body change and resurrection
[1:20:50] takes place Amen you'll see it's been
[1:20:52] paid in full
[1:20:54] hallelujah because you'll see the Dead
[1:20:56] has absolutely been paid amen stay with
[1:20:58] me just a little while now go to Exodus
[1:21:00] 21 you got your place there and I want
[1:21:03] you to look at this other type of this
[1:21:05] son of this Jubilee time now watch if
[1:21:07] they're by a Hebrew servant this is
[1:21:09] verse 2 6 years shall you serve
[1:21:12] and in the seventh church age I mean I
[1:21:15] mean in the seventh he shall go out free
[1:21:17] for nothing now he's showing us here a
[1:21:21] Titans these numbers you go watch the
[1:21:22] numerology the Bible it all means
[1:21:24] something six years he shall serve but
[1:21:27] in the seventh he shall go out free or
[1:21:30] in the time of releasing or the time of
[1:21:32] freedom would be applied to the seventh
[1:21:35] hour now I want you to understand
[1:21:36] something friends the year of Jubilee
[1:21:38] for the Lady of seein people did not
[1:21:40] take place at 1906 Pentecost no no that
[1:21:43] what exactly they're not at all no no
[1:21:45] that was only the restoration of the
[1:21:47] gifts Amen that's all God did was
[1:21:49] restored the gifts because that brother
[1:21:51] man tells us in the church age book he
[1:21:53] said what was thought to be the
[1:21:54] long-awaited restoration was nothing
[1:21:57] more than just the restoration of the
[1:21:59] gifts our Jubilee sounded at the opening
[1:22:02] of the seven seals
[1:22:03] Amen that's where the lamb takes the
[1:22:05] book remember there was no man worthy
[1:22:07] not in heaven not an earth not beneath
[1:22:10] not around that was able to take that
[1:22:12] book why because he had sin debt upon
[1:22:15] sin debt upon sin debt he did not have
[1:22:18] the ability to pay himself out to make
[1:22:20] himself worthy enough to be able to take
[1:22:23] that book and John got to crying a
[1:22:25] member on a sudden he hears a voice come
[1:22:27] don't you weep John for the line have
[1:22:30] prevailed to take the road and when he
[1:22:33] turns to see a lie and he sees a bloody
[1:22:34] lamb that blood was the purchase the
[1:22:37] token power to be able to set at liberty
[1:22:40] anybody that had their name on that
[1:22:42] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:22:43] foundation of the world
[1:22:44] amen because when was your name put
[1:22:46] there not the night you got saved one of
[1:22:49] the nights you come running to the altar
[1:22:50] you didn't get eternal life the day you
[1:22:51] received the Holy Ghost
[1:22:52] you always were eternal that's why you
[1:22:55] could receive eternal life that's why
[1:22:57] you could receive salvation is because
[1:22:59] God saw fit Amen to put your name in
[1:23:02] that eternal book I mean at one thing we
[1:23:05] have to understand is that the sounding
[1:23:07] of the seven thunders at the breaking of
[1:23:09] the seventh seal at the opening of the
[1:23:11] message of the hour the real true
[1:23:12] mysteries of God coming open all of that
[1:23:15] was the sounding of jubilee for the
[1:23:18] elect of God we were not set free by the
[1:23:21] restoration of gifts the church was
[1:23:24] still in bondage then
[1:23:26] if you don't think so just go look and
[1:23:28] see after the restoration of gifts how
[1:23:29] many splinters the Pentecost showed up
[1:23:31] after that if they were free how come
[1:23:33] they didn't understand the message yet
[1:23:35] how come many I'm was looking at oil
[1:23:36] running out the hands and blood out of
[1:23:38] the forehead and still believe in the
[1:23:39] initial tongues of the evidence of the
[1:23:40] Holy Ghost or initial evidence was
[1:23:42] tongues how come they were still
[1:23:44] believing a lot of nonsense about about
[1:23:46] water baptism being regeneration and
[1:23:49] women preachers and everything yes what
[1:23:51] you could say man and ain't gonna hurt
[1:23:52] me come on somebody it was not freedom
[1:23:56] to them it was only the restoration of
[1:23:58] the nine spiritual gifts but at the
[1:24:00] sounding of the seventh angels message
[1:24:03] we received our Jubilee the revelation
[1:24:08] opened up to a we could receive true
[1:24:11] freedom I've said this a million times
[1:24:13] I'm going to say the million in one one
[1:24:15] thing we've got to understand is that as
[1:24:17] believers of the last day message there
[1:24:18] ain't no gift in this world that can
[1:24:20] fool us I don't care be a preaching gift
[1:24:23] a tongue gift a prophecy gift a healing
[1:24:26] gift we've got the devil's answer for
[1:24:28] every moving of the supernatural love on
[1:24:30] this planet somebody said to me while I
[1:24:34] dream dreams I said I'm glad about it
[1:24:36] I've got a little template I can use to
[1:24:37] see if your dreams of God or non one man
[1:24:41] said to me well it's a spiritual dream I
[1:24:42] said all right if it is and you'll
[1:24:43] follow what he's said in God amen God
[1:24:45] God always a man he talks about God's
[1:24:49] gifts finding their places I know this
[1:24:51] is gonna pinch that's why I'm hesitating
[1:24:52] a little bit here it comes
[1:24:54] amen but he talks about he said if it's
[1:24:56] a spiritual dream it won't have a bunch
[1:24:57] of symbols in it he said there's no
[1:25:00] prophet on the earth to interpret well
[1:25:02] go look it up in 1963 he said without a
[1:25:05] prophet here to interpret he said when
[1:25:06] the Prophet interprets it he sees the
[1:25:09] dream as though you're dreaming yourself
[1:25:10] and will even tell you the parts that
[1:25:12] you left out that's just what he said I
[1:25:14] can't help it I meant and he said if
[1:25:16] it's a spiritual dream God will speak in
[1:25:19] this hour like he did to Joseph of
[1:25:21] Arimathea and say fear not to take unto
[1:25:23] thee Mary thy wife as such as the
[1:25:26] movement of the Holy Ghost so whatever
[1:25:28] I'm out on the field and somebody says
[1:25:29] ho I had this dream I go I pulled my
[1:25:33] meter out he said we'll tell me about
[1:25:36] your dream well you know the Lord spoke
[1:25:37] to me and told me to do such and such
[1:25:39] thing
[1:25:40] that your dream was a spiritual dream
[1:25:41] one preacher estimate I said how can you
[1:25:43] discern that how do you know I said
[1:25:45] because it fits the template Amen it
[1:25:47] fits the outline of what's been given to
[1:25:49] us in this hour I had an individual call
[1:25:51] me about a year ago ins had this big
[1:25:53] convoluted spiritual thing I mean the
[1:25:55] Eagles were flying down on white sand
[1:25:57] and all this kind of stuff and he said
[1:25:59] what do you think it means I said I
[1:26:00] think it means you need to stop eating
[1:26:01] at five o'clock before you go to bed
[1:26:03] stay with me a little bit amen amen we
[1:26:08] have the answer for all of these things
[1:26:10] that brings the elect of God freedom at
[1:26:12] watch in verse three if he came in by
[1:26:14] himself he shall go out by himself if he
[1:26:17] were married than his wife shall go out
[1:26:19] with him if his master if give him a
[1:26:21] wife and she had borne him sons and
[1:26:23] daughters the wife and her children
[1:26:24] shall be our masters and she shall go
[1:26:26] out by or he shall go out by himself and
[1:26:29] if the servant shall plainly say I love
[1:26:32] my master my wife my children I will not
[1:26:35] go out free now I want you to think
[1:26:37] about some for a moment why would this
[1:26:38] be a problem if you were this man now no
[1:26:41] think spirits are now just thank the
[1:26:42] weights wrote this man who falls into
[1:26:45] debt he's under his masters home his
[1:26:47] master treats him well gives him three
[1:26:49] square meals a day he takes gives him
[1:26:51] hot water we would say or gives him a
[1:26:53] nice bed to sleep in and he's got a
[1:26:55] daughter he falls in love with this girl
[1:26:57] he gets married they have kids from a
[1:26:59] natural perspective brother mark I don't
[1:27:01] blame the guy I wouldn't want to leave
[1:27:02] either now far as being in love with her
[1:27:05] if it was Samantha Kay I wouldn't want
[1:27:07] to leave either I'll butcher in slavery
[1:27:09] yeah but this is Samantha Kay we talking
[1:27:11] about a man that's a big deal and I love
[1:27:15] her so much I wouldn't want to leave out
[1:27:16] of that situation now from the natural
[1:27:18] perspective of it you couldn't have told
[1:27:20] by looking at it if there was any kind
[1:27:22] of a thing spiritual going on at all
[1:27:24] well that's a big deal he got a wife and
[1:27:27] kids he wants to stay with his family
[1:27:28] but launched the type that Jesus picks
[1:27:31] up when he uses this I love my master my
[1:27:33] wife and so on and so forth Jesus picks
[1:27:36] this up in the New Testament when he
[1:27:37] said if you'll put father or mother or
[1:27:39] cousins or aunt or anybody else above me
[1:27:41] you're not even worthy to serve me in
[1:27:43] any way whatsoever see these things were
[1:27:45] done to hide from the devil what the
[1:27:47] real plan of God is a man you're writing
[1:27:51] things down I'm going to
[1:27:52] three things to write down I want you
[1:27:53] all to remember the theme of
[1:27:55] Christianity has three parts to it
[1:27:57] reconciliation Redemption and
[1:28:00] restoration there's the three main
[1:28:03] principle themes of the Bible if you're
[1:28:05] a Christian
[1:28:06] those three themes will follow in
[1:28:08] everything that you do when you see
[1:28:10] somebody fall into travel a trouble into
[1:28:12] traps and things you don't want to just
[1:28:14] shove them down so I knew you didn't
[1:28:15] have nothing anyways you want to
[1:28:17] reconcile them that's what the Bible
[1:28:19] said in Galatians right he said you see
[1:28:21] a brother falling you who are spiritual
[1:28:23] go back and try to restore such a one
[1:28:24] amen the theme of reconciliation look
[1:28:27] what he's said in second Corinthians
[1:28:28] five he said that we are ambassadors to
[1:28:31] Jesus Christ to do what work the work of
[1:28:34] reconciliation to bring others back to
[1:28:36] Jesus Christ those that have fallen
[1:28:38] those that are halt blind weary whatever
[1:28:40] they are to bring them back and then the
[1:28:41] femur Redemption but the RAM tells us
[1:28:43] Christ the mystery that scarlet theme of
[1:28:45] redemption goes all the way up and down
[1:28:47] through the Bible so there are three
[1:28:49] main themes to Christianity
[1:28:51] reconciliation Redemption and
[1:28:53] restoration what was Malachi fleurs job
[1:28:56] in the first place
[1:28:57] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:29:00] prophet and he shall restore or turn
[1:29:02] your hearts back to the faith of the
[1:29:04] original fathers in that same message he
[1:29:07] tells us in the church age book that
[1:29:08] Elijah had two missions his first
[1:29:10] mission was to restore and his next one
[1:29:13] was to reveal what is that the book of
[1:29:15] redemption coming open to reveal the
[1:29:18] election of God their position in Jesus
[1:29:20] Christ amen my preaching that fast are
[1:29:23] you listening that slow which won't
[1:29:24] happen
[1:29:24] Amen but these themes brother they all
[1:29:27] lay right in the Word of God and this
[1:29:29] one theme after another that you'll see
[1:29:31] all the way down through the scripture
[1:29:32] reconciliation restoration and
[1:29:34] redemption again and again and again and
[1:29:36] again again now once you notice how in
[1:29:38] verse six that he takes this into a
[1:29:41] different category now of how that if a
[1:29:43] person would be in this condition how
[1:29:45] that they would behave now watch then
[1:29:47] his master shall bring him unto the
[1:29:49] judges and he shall also bring him to
[1:29:52] the door or under the doorpost and his
[1:29:55] master shall bore his ear through with
[1:29:57] an awl and he shall serve him for ever
[1:30:00] now this this all were talking about it
[1:30:02] was like a great big drill and it's like
[1:30:05] a big stab
[1:30:05] looking type a deal like that and what
[1:30:08] they would do is they would take this
[1:30:09] individual that refused to be set free
[1:30:11] they were giving up their own rights to
[1:30:13] the freedom that come with the Jubilee
[1:30:15] trumpet and they would take this person
[1:30:17] and bring them to the judges because you
[1:30:19] realize at the City of Refuge before
[1:30:22] every door there was a judge standing at
[1:30:24] the City of Refuge to judge whether your
[1:30:27] case was worthy to come in or not
[1:30:28] we called him preachers today not just
[1:30:32] pastors now not just evangelist but all
[1:30:35] fivefold ministry I was in Chicago a
[1:30:38] couple weeks ago and I was telling them
[1:30:39] brethren about how the prophet of God
[1:30:41] talked about when he was there and they
[1:30:43] laid the trap for him and he had the
[1:30:44] vision you remember and oh we're not
[1:30:46] going to get this room we're gonna get
[1:30:47] this room and everybody's going to be
[1:30:48] set in a certain place and if they
[1:30:50] thought for sure they was going to get a
[1:30:52] certain room and and the brother said
[1:30:54] now this and brother branham told me
[1:30:56] about this two days ago and he said he
[1:30:57] told us where all of you is going to be
[1:30:58] sitting and he said here we are today
[1:31:00] and brother BAM walked up to the
[1:31:02] platform and he said now you come take
[1:31:04] your Bible and stand by me he said and
[1:31:06] then prove me wrong on the serpent seed
[1:31:07] and water baptism you remember the story
[1:31:09] well he tells Billy Paul and you can
[1:31:11] find it the message right before he goes
[1:31:13] out there he said Billy he said I've got
[1:31:15] to take a word to go down there and
[1:31:17] guard the Tree of Life to guard the Tree
[1:31:20] of Life remember around the book of Acts
[1:31:22] there are four guards that are set there
[1:31:24] Matthew Mark Luke and John are guards to
[1:31:27] eternal life so before a man or woman
[1:31:30] can enter into eternal life
[1:31:32] they gotta cross preachers to do it oh
[1:31:36] god I'm glad y'all believe it I'd be in
[1:31:39] trouble right now I'd be out there with
[1:31:40] the Titanic came in hallelujah exactly
[1:31:43] right now watch now he shall bring him
[1:31:45] if his master shall say bring him out of
[1:31:47] the judge he shall bring him to the door
[1:31:49] under the doorpost his master will bore
[1:31:51] is ear through with an awl now we know
[1:31:53] what the door is the door is Jesus
[1:31:55] Christ in John 10 I am the door now if
[1:31:59] he is the door and he is the way and he
[1:32:01] is the truth and he is the life then I
[1:32:04] want somebody to find me one scripture
[1:32:06] that shows who the judges are going to
[1:32:08] be in the last day it's very simple the
[1:32:11] saints of God shall judge the earth
[1:32:14] amen and in those that that grouping of
[1:32:16] the saints of God there's fivefold
[1:32:18] ministry and those ministerial gifts are
[1:32:21] there to do what to guard the the wicked
[1:32:24] doers and the evil doers and all of
[1:32:26] those to keep them out do you realize
[1:32:28] part of the job of a preacher isn't just
[1:32:30] to swing the door open and let you in if
[1:32:32] you want to turn a life but part of our
[1:32:34] job is to deafen those that can't hear
[1:32:36] it that's part of my responsibility to
[1:32:39] to preach it away that if you're not
[1:32:42] gonna receive it it'll shut you up the
[1:32:44] rest of your days you'll never be able
[1:32:45] to hear it again
[1:32:46] oh don't misunderstand I don't mean to
[1:32:48] leave Church we'll come on now that's it
[1:32:53] right here in the house of God and
[1:32:54] there's no you know though hey come on I
[1:32:57] don't mean I leave Church there been
[1:33:00] plenty of people occupy pews and message
[1:33:02] churches that still can't hear nothing
[1:33:03] is being preached they hear what you're
[1:33:06] trying to say they they got ears as
[1:33:07] brother Gerald said today it's not it
[1:33:09] not Erie's they're not ears to hear but
[1:33:11] ears singular they got plenty of ears
[1:33:13] and like brother Gerald said the ears
[1:33:15] are connected to this but the ear is
[1:33:17] connected to that amen and that's the
[1:33:20] thing if the gospel blinds remember
[1:33:22] Billy Graham blinded all them people out
[1:33:24] there with this preaching if the gospel
[1:33:26] is to let them in remember the same
[1:33:28] water that saved Noah in his household
[1:33:31] was the exact same water the exact same
[1:33:35] preaching that shut the rest of them out
[1:33:37] that's why preaching is such a valuable
[1:33:39] thing I don't mean no harm when I say
[1:33:42] this and I realize this is going to get
[1:33:43] out on the internet and people are going
[1:33:45] to say
[1:33:45] old brother bins just trying to throw
[1:33:47] off on somebody but I'm not trying to
[1:33:49] throw off on somebody I don't care if
[1:33:50] their name is Branham or Smith or lessor
[1:33:52] nor odd or Regan or bisque I don't care
[1:33:55] what their name our coffee or whatever
[1:33:56] the name is I don't care who they are
[1:33:58] any man that tells you that the only way
[1:34:01] that you can figure out how to become a
[1:34:02] Christian and get right with God is push
[1:34:05] play and obey that man's got an
[1:34:06] antichrist spirit on him I don't care
[1:34:07] what his name is
[1:34:09] amen because if you don't have a gift to
[1:34:12] be able to break down that word you can
[1:34:14] listen them tapes every day of your life
[1:34:15] but it takes somebody gifted to break it
[1:34:18] down for you
[1:34:20] you can't just listen to the word and
[1:34:22] understand it yourself you need somebody
[1:34:23] to preach it to you amen you remember
[1:34:26] here last year we took the little fella
[1:34:28] riding in the chariot remember we talked
[1:34:29] about in just a few minutes and he
[1:34:31] talked about how he was reading the
[1:34:33] scroll in Isaiah and he said understand
[1:34:35] what you read he had more common sense
[1:34:37] and half the people in this message he
[1:34:39] said how can I say somebody some men
[1:34:41] guide me some men teach me a mint you've
[1:34:44] got to have a judge to be able to say
[1:34:46] come in or go out it doesn't work any
[1:34:48] other way brother this is God's program
[1:34:51] Amen brother sister and I don't mean no
[1:34:53] harm I'm not throwing off on BGR I'm not
[1:34:55] throwing off on tape churches I'm just
[1:34:57] saying they got a wrong spirit on them
[1:34:58] because they don't line up with the word
[1:34:59] it's not what the Prophet said it's not
[1:35:02] what brother Branham taught us it's
[1:35:03] showing what Paul said amen because Paul
[1:35:06] said keep joining yourselves together to
[1:35:08] do what not just set down here because I
[1:35:10] read the skull of Moses could you
[1:35:12] imagine Paul and him guys and we're
[1:35:13] gonna read from chapter four today that
[1:35:17] ain't the way they operated they preach
[1:35:19] the gospel and as the Holy Spirit used a
[1:35:22] gift a gift that would come from Jesus
[1:35:24] Christ that gift was placed in the body
[1:35:27] of Christ amen for your edification come
[1:35:30] on for your perfection how do you become
[1:35:33] mature preaching it brings you to the
[1:35:38] maturity of Jesus Christ you know what
[1:35:41] else it does it lets you know you can be
[1:35:42] free not just free from sin not just
[1:35:46] born again there are many things after
[1:35:48] you're born again you still need to be
[1:35:49] freed from you get quiet on me now now
[1:35:54] listen you told me to be ready I'm
[1:35:56] telling you the same thing come on out
[1:36:00] now brother this is exactly gospel
[1:36:02] preaching this is why when the jubilee
[1:36:05] trumpet has sounded if you don't have
[1:36:07] ears to hear you will never hear it
[1:36:09] again if you've ever been deaf into that
[1:36:11] sound and the judges would be the one
[1:36:14] that does it it won't be just like folk
[1:36:16] common Lefou but remember I'm told us
[1:36:18] that the third pole there would be a
[1:36:19] group of people in the churches that
[1:36:21] would be absolutely eternally lost could
[1:36:24] never be saved and they'll be in the
[1:36:27] churches oh you say well how do you know
[1:36:29] that indictment message read BAM said
[1:36:31] where is Jesus Christ get as hard as
[1:36:33] Speirs from where did he get his crown
[1:36:35] of thorns from today where's the second
[1:36:38] Calvary he said right there from them
[1:36:40] pulpits well if they can crucify him
[1:36:43] from the pulpit can't they also
[1:36:44] resurrect him in the same place Amen and
[1:36:47] if they can kill the effect of Christ on
[1:36:49] the congregation's can't we also
[1:36:50] resurrect the effect on the congregation
[1:36:53] it goes to prove they're the judges
[1:36:55] they're standing at the door
[1:36:56] even Jesus spoke about it he said why
[1:36:59] are you lawyers that stand in the door
[1:37:01] keeping people from coming in amen no
[1:37:04] matter how we like to think of it you
[1:37:05] can't get past these gospel men they're
[1:37:07] anointed by the Holy Spirit to do the
[1:37:09] job that they're doing and you cannot
[1:37:10] get past them now remember if the
[1:37:13] servant shall say I don't want to be
[1:37:15] free I want to stay with my family then
[1:37:18] he shall be deaf and then never hear the
[1:37:20] sounding of the jubilee trumpet again
[1:37:22] now I want to just take for just a
[1:37:23] moment a couple little pieces here about
[1:37:27] New Testament Christianity if you will
[1:37:29] and listeners pick up Galatians chapter
[1:37:30] 5 verse 13 now is your turn and I just
[1:37:34] want to give you a little a little
[1:37:36] background of what I'm going to try to
[1:37:37] talk about for just a moment and and one
[1:37:40] thing I want you to keep in your mind is
[1:37:41] that every Christian no matter who they
[1:37:43] are no matter how a brand new or how
[1:37:45] many years you've been in it every
[1:37:47] Christian has a sovereign responsibility
[1:37:49] to keep their hearts right before God
[1:37:53] remember that the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost is a free gift but character ain't
[1:38:00] character is a victory it's not a free
[1:38:03] gift you don't work to get the Holy
[1:38:06] Ghost there's nothing you can do
[1:38:08] yourself as far as salvation is
[1:38:09] concerned there's nothing you can do to
[1:38:11] earn salvation and all the legalists
[1:38:14] holiday man
[1:38:16] come on now oh my god I live right after
[1:38:20] you got saved that's true oh I do the
[1:38:22] right things
[1:38:23] after you got saved but nothing you did
[1:38:25] brought you to salvation salvation is a
[1:38:27] free gift that's a scripture that's just
[1:38:29] the Bible I can't I can't say only and
[1:38:32] nothing but only but what the Bible said
[1:38:33] salvation is a free gift but character
[1:38:36] ain't that way character is not
[1:38:38] something that God just gives to you you
[1:38:40] have to obtain victory after victory
[1:38:42] after victory huh you got to go through
[1:38:45] things rather to get there and I promise
[1:38:47] you you think it's easy as some of these
[1:38:49] young girls up here with their long hair
[1:38:50] and dresses if it's easy in this day and
[1:38:52] age you you you boys you know what I'm
[1:38:54] talking about when you see men running
[1:38:56] around their wives and this that and the
[1:38:57] other and then they say well how long
[1:38:59] you been married 21 years to each other
[1:39:03] it's just hard to believe sometimes that
[1:39:05] people can have a an honesty about them
[1:39:08] can have a true cuz the world is so
[1:39:10] corrupted and so wicked and they hate
[1:39:12] you for your stand because you represent
[1:39:15] everything that they hate about
[1:39:16] themselves they know you're the opposite
[1:39:19] and they they hate that about themselves
[1:39:20] but the bottom line it comes down to one
[1:39:23] thing that if we are going to obtain
[1:39:25] victory in Jesus Christ obtained
[1:39:27] character in Jesus Christ there are
[1:39:30] certain things that God will do for us
[1:39:31] and we don't even have to ask for it he
[1:39:32] just does it and then there are certain
[1:39:35] things we got to do ourselves now what
[1:39:37] I'm get ready to show you is some of our
[1:39:39] responsibility as believers all right
[1:39:41] Galatians chapter 5 verse 1 now I want
[1:39:44] you to pay attention to the way Paul
[1:39:46] words is he says for stand fast
[1:39:49] therefore in the Liberty wherewith
[1:39:51] Christ hath made us free all right stop
[1:39:56] a minute aren't you look in your Bible
[1:39:58] and I want you to notice that word 1/2
[1:40:01] it's not present tense
[1:40:03] that's not futuristic it's past tense
[1:40:07] something I want you to get in your mind
[1:40:09] right now you're not waiting on freedom
[1:40:11] you've already been given freedom
[1:40:14] that's the problem with a lot of people
[1:40:17] in this day and age they're trying to
[1:40:18] work themselves in the spiritual freedom
[1:40:20] it's already been given to you as a
[1:40:23] believer Jesus Christ on Calvary gave
[1:40:27] himself for the sins of the world that's
[1:40:29] my sense that's your sins
[1:40:31] that's foolish virgin sins that souls
[1:40:34] under the altar sins that's ah that's
[1:40:37] everybody
[1:40:38] that's why babies go to heaven little
[1:40:42] baby comes to this earth it lives 11
[1:40:44] hours and it dies and somebody say well
[1:40:46] he wasn't bribed he didn't go to heaven
[1:40:47] that ain't what the Bible said the Bible
[1:40:50] said the Lamb of God takes away the sins
[1:40:52] of the world he said until mother man
[1:40:54] said until a baby comes to the age of
[1:40:56] accountability
[1:40:57] he said that child is covered under
[1:40:59] ignorance by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:41:01] babies go to heaven where they wind up
[1:41:04] it in our business whether they're a
[1:41:06] bride or ever who they are but I don't
[1:41:07] believe that God would be just to send a
[1:41:09] baby that can't even decide right from
[1:41:11] wrong to send it to hell amen there's a
[1:41:14] place reserved
[1:41:15] there'll be millions of children that'll
[1:41:17] be may be walking outside the streets of
[1:41:19] New Jerusalem they won't be bribed
[1:41:20] necessarily maybe they wouldn't be
[1:41:22] elected of God maybe they wouldn't be
[1:41:24] those that we would say this is the wife
[1:41:26] of God walking the streets but I don't
[1:41:28] believe that are lost either well
[1:41:30] friends that's what brother Branham said
[1:41:32] we can get all kinds of funny ideas as
[1:41:35] message people because we've got this
[1:41:37] elitism mentality if it ain't bribed it
[1:41:39] ain't nothing hey brother I Got News for
[1:41:41] you there's all kinds of categories that
[1:41:43] God's gonna let me save amen I got three
[1:41:48] girls I'd love to see them be bride I'd
[1:41:50] love to see them receive the Holy Ghost
[1:41:51] but if they're not bride and they're not
[1:41:52] gonna receive the Holy Ghost that ain't
[1:41:54] up to me I can't I can't set him down
[1:41:57] with a message book every day and say
[1:41:59] you're gonna be bride that ain't up to
[1:42:00] me I couldn't set myself down with the
[1:42:02] message book every day and make myself
[1:42:04] bride well come on preach to me now
[1:42:07] amen I can't do that for myself it is
[1:42:10] God that show up the mercy to make me
[1:42:13] bride
[1:42:14] that silver reason I am bride because I
[1:42:17] wanted to be in because I asked to be
[1:42:19] it's because he chose me but there'll be
[1:42:22] million saved he said well the earth is
[1:42:25] an awful little place don't forget we
[1:42:26] got Jupiter Mars and Saturn and all them
[1:42:29] spots out there
[1:42:30] amen there's all kinds of galaxies and
[1:42:32] planets who knows how many millions of
[1:42:34] millions upon millions of people a man
[1:42:36] might be living in other dimensions you
[1:42:37] say well we can't get in a rocket ship
[1:42:39] no but we got to travel like a thought
[1:42:41] we have thought Rockets even a man we
[1:42:45] have the ability if we want to think I'd
[1:42:46] like to be on Jupiter poof there you are
[1:42:48] amen you'll travel like a thought Allah
[1:42:50] brother brems said Amen lightyears
[1:42:53] what's light-years to a god the kids got
[1:42:55] a control of light in time and space and
[1:42:57] matter
[1:42:57] amen and will be like him we'll have a
[1:42:59] body like his own glorious body
[1:43:01] amen will they live on the city where
[1:43:03] they live on the outside of the city
[1:43:05] sure they will amen they'll be plowers
[1:43:07] just like Adam was to till the soil but
[1:43:10] the man taught us that those people will
[1:43:11] have the ability I'll have they'll have
[1:43:13] son they'll have moon they'll have all
[1:43:15] of these type of things on the outside
[1:43:17] of the city why because that's the way
[1:43:19] they lived here in this life but the
[1:43:21] elected lives by the light of the Lamb
[1:43:23] why because that's how she lived on this
[1:43:26] side and then we're not living by the
[1:43:28] light of one revival to another we are
[1:43:30] always in that light that's why we're
[1:43:33] doing what we're doing today by
[1:43:34] worshiping the Lord like we worship
[1:43:36] we're living in the Esso in light the
[1:43:39] Esso in light of God amen now watch Paul
[1:43:42] said you have already been made free now
[1:43:44] if we can understand that if we can
[1:43:46] grasp that then anything you're
[1:43:48] struggling with I don't care how little
[1:43:50] or how big it is
[1:43:50] you need to understand Jubilee has
[1:43:52] already been sounded for you and you can
[1:43:55] be set free no matter what it is now
[1:43:58] watch this now and be not entangled
[1:44:00] again with the yoke of bondage wow
[1:44:04] that's quite a remark so Paul is showing
[1:44:08] us now that we as believers now remember
[1:44:11] he's talking to brethren here you don't
[1:44:14] think so skip down to verse 13 where I'm
[1:44:15] getting ready to read from looking them
[1:44:17] first couple words for ye brethren
[1:44:19] they're not talking to us
[1:44:22] he's talking to believers so as
[1:44:24] believers we with the Holy Ghost have
[1:44:26] the potential of building up a sin debt
[1:44:31] well glory thought y'all said you was
[1:44:34] ready for me hey man now
[1:44:39] you said I'm a believer yes but there's
[1:44:42] the law of sowing and reaping so once an
[1:44:45] you'll reap a whole washtub full they
[1:44:48] just don't think this because you're a
[1:44:49] believer don't mean that you can amass
[1:44:51] debt against your life I'll give you an
[1:44:53] example of what I mean you remember when
[1:44:55] the prophet of God had got up under that
[1:44:57] tax case and they got nervous and it
[1:45:00] meet II was on the phone and said well
[1:45:01] you want me to do business tell him I'm
[1:45:03] not here and he ran out the back door
[1:45:04] real quick well he went to go pray for a
[1:45:06] baby right after that member story
[1:45:08] anyone to go pray for that little baby
[1:45:09] in the Holy Spirit said yeah fit to
[1:45:11] touch that child even pray for it why
[1:45:13] God tell him at not because he wanted to
[1:45:16] believe or not because he didn't have
[1:45:17] the Holy Ghost he had a master sin-debt
[1:45:19] in his life and that debt God was making
[1:45:22] him pay for his dead get a little
[1:45:25] message one time I think it's in he's in
[1:45:27] you I think 63 64 and I can't remember
[1:45:30] the exact spot but anyhow I'll wake you
[1:45:34] up 2:30 in the morning when I remembered
[1:45:35] okay
[1:45:36] but I remember brother Brennan talking
[1:45:38] this much he said that every time he
[1:45:41] come into the city and the Jefferson
[1:45:42] Lily get hives and break out and get a
[1:45:44] cold you know what he said he said it's
[1:45:46] God making me pay for not going out and
[1:45:48] listening to him the very first time he
[1:45:50] said when I listened to my mother-in-law
[1:45:51] God was still making him pay he had a
[1:45:54] debt and that debt followed by the brim
[1:45:56] all the way up to the very last years of
[1:45:58] his life he had stomach trouble and all
[1:45:59] kinds of little things and he stood
[1:46:01] there in and on the wings of a snow
[1:46:03] right dub and he said as of today he
[1:46:05] said I believe I'll ride this trail
[1:46:07] again
[1:46:07] he said I'm God give him brand new life
[1:46:10] rail he wrote it all right and just a
[1:46:11] little bit from that he was riding on
[1:46:13] the trail I guarantee it mm but no
[1:46:15] natural trail with no tent set up around
[1:46:17] him a man he was in in rolling fields of
[1:46:19] bluegrass in just a little bit
[1:46:21] hallelujah but the Prophet had to pay
[1:46:24] all these little debts and things in his
[1:46:26] life because remember you can become
[1:46:29] entangled again usually I don't believe
[1:46:31] that well then you don't believe the
[1:46:32] Bible because I just read it together
[1:46:34] this is what scripture said is it or
[1:46:37] isn't I maybe am i reading something in
[1:46:38] your Bible
[1:46:40] hey man well glory to God I'm the
[1:46:44] elected uh-huh sure you are
[1:46:45] I'm predestinated sure you are oh I'm a
[1:46:48] child of God I know that yes I know that
[1:46:52] but what about this guy in the book of
[1:46:54] Corinthians living with his father's
[1:46:56] wife Paul said turn him over to the
[1:46:59] destruction of the flesh but the saving
[1:47:01] of the soul you know to having that guy
[1:47:02] he repented and got right with God at
[1:47:05] the very end of second Corinthians
[1:47:07] mmm-hmm but what if Paul would have been
[1:47:09] like some of us today in the message all
[1:47:11] there ain't no way a Christian can
[1:47:12] backslide or get little things wrong or
[1:47:15] do something wrong you see our biggest
[1:47:17] problem is as human being is much less
[1:47:19] Christian human beings is we think that
[1:47:21] we can't really mess up and really
[1:47:24] that's our cowardice speaking because at
[1:47:27] the end of the day what we're really
[1:47:28] trying to hide is our inferiority when
[1:47:30] we should be throwing that at the feet
[1:47:32] of Jesus Christ and telling him I am
[1:47:34] inferior I am weak I can't hold on you
[1:47:38] got to hold on to me right out we cut it
[1:47:41] up with some kind of a veil trying to
[1:47:43] pretend like we're more spiritual what
[1:47:45] we really are well I'm a believer
[1:47:47] therefore I can't lust I don't believe
[1:47:49] it I can't lie your silly is what you
[1:47:51] are you're just not thinking about what
[1:47:54] real Christianity looks like because
[1:47:56] we've painted this beautiful picture of
[1:47:58] what Christianity is and that's casting
[1:47:59] out Devils and slaying lions and
[1:48:01] knocking goliaths over and all this kind
[1:48:03] of stuff and really Christianity comes
[1:48:05] down to two things wins and losses and
[1:48:08] you're going to have both of them in
[1:48:10] your life every day of your life so Paul
[1:48:12] is telling us don't become entangled
[1:48:14] again with the yoke of bondage now watch
[1:48:16] this verse 13 for breath again what a
[1:48:21] potent believe Christians could get into
[1:48:22] this why is he calling these guys
[1:48:23] brothers because Paul knew this listen
[1:48:29] he tells us in Romans chapter 7 the good
[1:48:32] I want to do that's the stuff ain't
[1:48:33] doing the stuff I don't want to be doing
[1:48:35] this to sever keep doing anybody a
[1:48:38] relate with what Paul said what was he
[1:48:41] talking about the ability to become
[1:48:43] entangled or build up a sin debt in your
[1:48:46] life that you've got to pay it all you
[1:48:48] say but it's too much I cannot er
[1:48:50] comment but thank god we've got a
[1:48:51] checkbook with Jesus's name sign at the
[1:48:54] bottom of every one of them all we got
[1:48:56] to do is fill out and send it up to
[1:48:58] heaven amen and I don't care if it's a
[1:49:01] complex I don't care if it's a fear huh
[1:49:03] I don't care just sign your name Jesus's
[1:49:07] name is attached to it and you can have
[1:49:09] your freedom remember you're not waiting
[1:49:11] to be free you're already free you're
[1:49:14] already free you just got to recognize
[1:49:15] it
[1:49:16] now watch here again oh I like I says
[1:49:18] this he said for you have been called
[1:49:20] under Liberty amen
[1:49:22] that's why you're sitting here tonight
[1:49:23] you've not been called under bondage
[1:49:25] under this and illegal ism of these
[1:49:27] things but you've been called unto
[1:49:28] Liberty that's your calling
[1:49:29] Amen somebody I wish I was called to
[1:49:32] something you are called to Liberty amen
[1:49:35] only use not Liberty for an occasion to
[1:49:38] the flesh but by love serve one another
[1:49:42] now we all recognize this Paul the word
[1:49:46] he uses here for occasion is actually
[1:49:48] the word resources we all know this
[1:49:51] little part of living because you know
[1:49:53] being believers being elect you know
[1:49:55] seal on my soul I can't never be broken
[1:49:58] I can't never go to hell I can't never
[1:49:59] be lost you know
[1:50:01] God God can't send me to hell you know
[1:50:05] so he probably wouldn't mind y'all look
[1:50:09] at me like a bunch of Methodist and you
[1:50:10] know exactly what I'm talking about
[1:50:13] little things we try to get back oh come
[1:50:16] on don't look at me that way now little
[1:50:18] things we try to slide by because in our
[1:50:20] heart were comfortable I know I'm saved
[1:50:22] I know I've got to hold a ghost I know
[1:50:24] I'm not going to help I'm at a lot o you
[1:50:28] know you know how did you know God
[1:50:32] understands Paul said don't you use your
[1:50:38] Liberty for an occasion don't you don't
[1:50:41] look for resources well you know you
[1:50:44] know the prophet of God you know he had
[1:50:46] a Christmas tree and he gave presents to
[1:50:48] his kids yes that's true
[1:50:50] but when I go by your house and I see
[1:50:52] Santa Claus on the roof and I see him in
[1:50:54] the driveway and I see you dressed up
[1:50:56] like a reindeer I think you've carried
[1:50:58] it too far
[1:51:01] come on outreach to me well you know
[1:51:05] sister Rebecca she had little riding
[1:51:08] scored so on to be able to ride a horse
[1:51:09] yes but that don't give you a right to
[1:51:11] wear breeches every other day of the
[1:51:12] week
[1:51:13] don't use Liberty for resources well I'm
[1:51:17] a Christian therefore I can get away
[1:51:18] with such-and-such and so-and-so listen
[1:51:20] I understand one that when the believe
[1:51:22] the sign bunch bergen's and all these
[1:51:24] guys got in there and they took that
[1:51:26] little picture brother branham in the
[1:51:27] little African garb with the shorts on I
[1:51:29] don't believe brother friend practice
[1:51:31] wearing shorts he done it as a joke for
[1:51:34] his children like many of us has done
[1:51:36] the very same thing but brother Branham
[1:51:39] also wasn't a people-pleaser he wasn't
[1:51:41] looking around waiting to see who he was
[1:51:42] gonna offend he just wanted it something
[1:51:44] funny for his children because he loved
[1:51:46] his children and he wanted to do
[1:51:48] something but malodorous a lot I am
[1:51:50] preaching against shorts and then there
[1:51:51] isn't a pair of shorts see how the devil
[1:51:54] does you got to be careful you cannot
[1:51:58] use your liberty for resources I had a
[1:52:01] fella tell me some time ago you said you
[1:52:03] know cuz if there's anything I'm hard on
[1:52:05] I'm harder on Halloween than damn
[1:52:06] Christmas I promise you that I'll never
[1:52:09] understand how Bible believing God
[1:52:11] called people can go out there and let
[1:52:12] your kids dress like a bunch of ghouls
[1:52:14] and goblins with butcher knives in their
[1:52:16] head and scary faces and the whole thing
[1:52:18] and say and then one fella told me well
[1:52:20] brother branham let his kids dress up in
[1:52:22] Bible characters I said yes but Freddy
[1:52:24] Krueger is a far cry from Esther or from
[1:52:27] Abraham or from Moses not trying to be
[1:52:33] funny forget me but brother this is what
[1:52:35] the Bible said don't use it your liberty
[1:52:38] as a resource well brother better watch
[1:52:43] Gunsmoke yes but I don't think that
[1:52:45] gives you the right to watch all of the
[1:52:47] big trilogies of everything that there
[1:52:48] is to watch brother man I went to a
[1:52:52] movie house and watch the river runs do
[1:52:54] it to see Marilyn Monroe glory to God
[1:52:57] that's using your liberty for resources
[1:53:00] so well hallelujah you can't go watch
[1:53:03] every shoot-'em-up and every r-rated
[1:53:05] thing in everything hey man that's using
[1:53:09] your liberty we had a girl many years
[1:53:11] back in
[1:53:13] in Manchester and I don't mind saying
[1:53:16] this out loud I said it to her in her
[1:53:17] face and at the pulpit and everywhere
[1:53:19] else I thought was wrong what she did
[1:53:20] she said well you know brother Ben she
[1:53:22] said we get dead ends us girls I said
[1:53:25] huh huh she said well you know I don't
[1:53:27] look good uh-huh I knew her she was
[1:53:30] heading but I just don't know how she's
[1:53:31] gonna get there you know she said so
[1:53:34] what I figured out to do she said you
[1:53:35] grip your hair like this and you rip
[1:53:37] like that so you rip all them dead ends
[1:53:39] out there and it makes it nice and even
[1:53:41] and I said sister I got one thing I want
[1:53:44] to tell you I said any spirit that would
[1:53:46] cause you to rip it your glory it's a
[1:53:50] wrong spirit if it's got a pair of
[1:53:51] scissors in his hand or it don't you
[1:53:54] years ago and in Lima when when I used
[1:53:57] to go up that direction there were some
[1:53:59] girls out there that said well the Bible
[1:54:01] said you can't cut your hair so they
[1:54:02] would take a curling iron and get it so
[1:54:04] hot that they'd burn the ends of their
[1:54:06] bangs off to make them nice even and
[1:54:07] straight don't you see if that is using
[1:54:10] your Liberty for an occasion an occasion
[1:54:13] to the flesh and people look for excuses
[1:54:15] to do all kinds of things I'm not
[1:54:18] cutting it yeah but this thing you're
[1:54:20] doing it you're achieving the same thing
[1:54:21] no matter how you doing
[1:54:23] amen we used to tell some of those women
[1:54:26] like that they said well or to God
[1:54:27] you know we're abiding by the scripture
[1:54:30] I said mate maybe you think you are but
[1:54:33] it doesn't make sense to me I'll never
[1:54:34] understand I'm just gonna hate to say
[1:54:37] something right now and it's gonna sound
[1:54:38] hateful but I don't mean for designed
[1:54:39] hateful it's just the truth but a lot of
[1:54:41] the girls they read this thing about
[1:54:42] nail polish you know tell them how they
[1:54:45] realize that they don't put pink and
[1:54:47] blue and purple and all this on her
[1:54:48] fingernails and toes so what do they do
[1:54:50] they go get a French manicure thing and
[1:54:52] put clear note in that nail polish on it
[1:54:53] and you know what people look at when
[1:54:55] they see you like that they see you like
[1:54:57] you got painted toes and painted bangers
[1:54:59] but you know the message you're using
[1:55:02] your Liberty for an occasion to your
[1:55:03] flesh is what you're doing hallelujah
[1:55:07] it's the truth
[1:55:08] I listen y'all know me I'm not a
[1:55:10] legalist I've got Facebook I don't
[1:55:15] believe these things send people to hell
[1:55:17] what sends them to hell is the attitude
[1:55:19] and the way that they operate when they
[1:55:21] do many of the things they do hey listen
[1:55:23] I was telling about the Matthew the
[1:55:24] other night I said many of these people
[1:55:25] that carry on about Facebook being
[1:55:27] I said these are the same people whether
[1:55:28] they're parents that we had to carry on
[1:55:30] about them laying on the phone gossiping
[1:55:32] 24 hours a day
[1:55:33] anyhow god bless you stay with me hey
[1:55:37] man is that Alright don't use your
[1:55:39] Liberty as an occasion let me give you
[1:55:41] an example of this word occasion in
[1:55:42] first Timothy chapter 5 verse 14 Paul
[1:55:44] said I will therefore that the younger
[1:55:46] women marry bear children guide the
[1:55:48] house give none occasion to the
[1:55:51] adversary to speak reproachfully now
[1:55:53] remember he's saying to these two these
[1:55:55] young women don't give an occasion or
[1:55:58] don't give the devil resources to do
[1:56:00] anything amen against your testimony for
[1:56:02] Christ now I want to say something to
[1:56:04] you you realize that the majority of
[1:56:06] where the devil gets resources against
[1:56:09] us you know where it comes from us we're
[1:56:13] the ones that give him a lot of
[1:56:15] resources we wake up on Monday morning
[1:56:17] oh I hate this job
[1:56:18] I hated church last night I hate the bad
[1:56:22] this is too hard
[1:56:23] and the devil sitting there going whoa
[1:56:25] glory preach it preach preach what was
[1:56:29] how to get him cut on our pleasure Jimmy
[1:56:31] and then Friday rolls around and you
[1:56:34] wonder why you've had such a miserable
[1:56:35] week it's because you give him resources
[1:56:39] you give him enough time you give him
[1:56:41] enough work amen that he understands how
[1:56:44] to approach you that's why I tell people
[1:56:46] sometimes I learned a lesson from my
[1:56:48] pastor for the keira before he retired
[1:56:50] brother Carol used to tell everybody he
[1:56:52] said I never let the devil know what I'm
[1:56:53] thinking cuz he can't discern my
[1:56:54] thoughts of my intents he said so I
[1:56:56] never let the devil know what I'm
[1:56:57] thinking somebody asked me how I'm doing
[1:56:59] this I feel so good take to me to handle
[1:57:01] it
[1:57:02] amen and that's true that's true if you
[1:57:05] live your life in such a way so whether
[1:57:07] when Satan is attacking you and you just
[1:57:09] keep smiling and you just keep praising
[1:57:11] the Lord well glory to God and
[1:57:13] hallelujah the definitely what is a
[1:57:14] matter with this guy we've hit him with
[1:57:15] our best stuff I don't want to give him
[1:57:18] any resources nothing to work on he can
[1:57:22] sure do it all he has to do is watch
[1:57:24] somebody cut you off in traffic and he's
[1:57:26] watching your expression to see what
[1:57:27] you're gonna do
[1:57:28] that's why I know I can't hide it if
[1:57:31] somebody cuts me off
[1:57:32] I get mad about it so I just speak it
[1:57:35] out man why do you guys do this stuff Oh
[1:57:37] hallelujah anyhow hey man I just figured
[1:57:41] I can't hide it from the devil no houses
[1:57:42] sometimes I just use a little honesty
[1:57:44] and then I do what I'm supposed to do I
[1:57:46] just commit the thing to the Lord and
[1:57:48] I'll sweat it walk off and leave it
[1:57:49] alone some people can't do that some
[1:57:53] people have got it in their mind they
[1:57:54] got to do certain certain ways and
[1:57:56] certain certain things and you know they
[1:57:58] got a they got to operate when you say
[1:57:59] well how are you feeling today come over
[1:58:01] to God I am on the up side of the
[1:58:03] mountain
[1:58:04] well but you're not you die in you're
[1:58:08] sicker than you've ever been
[1:58:09] you know go to the devil you're just
[1:58:12] telling the truth so somebody knows how
[1:58:13] to pray for you there's a difference in
[1:58:16] being honest and given the devil
[1:58:18] resources the difference of it is is
[1:58:21] whenever you start complaining grumbling
[1:58:24] and murmuring about the different things
[1:58:25] oh you know God don't listen and they
[1:58:28] pray for me 12 times and then ain't
[1:58:29] happening all that and the devil just
[1:58:31] saying huh huh got you right where I
[1:58:32] want you
[1:58:33] Amen there's nothing wrong with being
[1:58:35] honest sometimes you got to be honest if
[1:58:37] you're hurting you just got to say I'm
[1:58:39] hurting something ain't right with me I
[1:58:42] need help somebody pray for me somebody
[1:58:44] you know get me to the doctor or
[1:58:46] something like that I was I was laughing
[1:58:49] I was teasing today and I made a remark
[1:58:50] and I taught my how people you know
[1:58:52] brother Carroll used to say to him and
[1:58:55] it they not going to the doctor or
[1:58:57] something kind of remark like that or
[1:58:58] I'm not going to take my medicine or
[1:59:00] something like that
[1:59:00] brother Carroll say well there's one two
[1:59:02] things wrong with you he said either you
[1:59:03] got a lot of faith or you ain't got no
[1:59:04] brains you said how shall I pray
[1:59:06] [Laughter]
[1:59:11] amen but you got to be honest sometimes
[1:59:14] sometimes that's the reason marriages
[1:59:16] fail because there's no honesty in it
[1:59:18] that's the reason why parents and
[1:59:20] children have so many opposition's and
[1:59:22] adversarial things
[1:59:23] there's no honesty in the thing you know
[1:59:26] what I can't I can't yes you can if
[1:59:28] you're not careful you'll give the devil
[1:59:30] resources to work on that you should
[1:59:32] have never give him in the first place
[1:59:33] amen so don't give an occasion don't
[1:59:35] give the devil a reason to come against
[1:59:37] you now let's turn to first Peter
[1:59:38] chapter 2 verse 15 15 and 16 a man and a
[1:59:44] man well I hope this is all right amen
[1:59:48] because if it's not it's too late now
[1:59:50] hey man I could have you standing we
[1:59:53] could start all over again but I don't
[1:59:55] know if you'd like it alright first
[1:59:59] Peter chapter 2 verse 15 now watch again
[2:00:01] how Peter brings this for so is the will
[2:00:04] of God that with well doing you may put
[2:00:06] to silence the ignorance of foolish men
[2:00:09] so a lot of times brother you don't even
[2:00:11] have to defend yourself you just have to
[2:00:13] live right your life will put the ignant
[2:00:17] put to silence the ignorance of foolish
[2:00:18] man amen now watch what you said as free
[2:00:22] not using your liberty for a cloak of
[2:00:29] maliciousness but as the servants of God
[2:00:32] now you all know how this looks you know
[2:00:36] you've had them guys to come and debate
[2:00:37] you and they start out something like
[2:00:40] this now my precious friend and brother
[2:00:43] we love this message don't we oh look
[2:00:46] out here comes that old boys getting
[2:00:50] ready to get you high guarantee that
[2:00:53] don't use it as a cloak if you've got a
[2:00:56] disagreement just say I don't understand
[2:00:59] help me understand it seems odd to me I
[2:01:01] hear you're talking but I don't get it
[2:01:03] can you explain it to me but often we
[2:01:05] try to use things as a cloak and what
[2:01:08] we've done is we've amassed a sin debt
[2:01:10] in our life and if we're not careful
[2:01:11] those debts will mount up if you ever
[2:01:13] tried to pray and it feels like a church
[2:01:15] is sitting on you you know why that's
[2:01:17] there dad you've got debts you need to
[2:01:20] pay
[2:01:20] you've amassed some sort of cinder
[2:01:22] that's why you need to realize the
[2:01:24] Jubilee has sounded and brought you
[2:01:25] freedom and you can be free but you've
[2:01:28] just got to keep writing checks every
[2:01:29] time some little thing comes up that's
[2:01:31] why the prophet of God said if you can
[2:01:33] get a little spot of bitterness in your
[2:01:34] heart get it right quick because he said
[2:01:36] it'll grow into something big
[2:01:38] don't let little debts start compounding
[2:01:41] I mean because I'll tell you when it
[2:01:43] comes to sin and little things in our
[2:01:44] life they have compound interest on them
[2:01:47] something you start today will triple by
[2:01:49] six months from now
[2:01:50] amen the dividends have it'll be so
[2:01:52] great you were getting a mess you won't
[2:01:54] be able to pay the thing and the only
[2:01:55] way you can get out of it many times is
[2:01:57] just say God I need your help if you
[2:01:59] don't pay this off if you don't get me
[2:02:01] out of this debt I'm gonna be in a mess
[2:02:03] forever that's why when something comes
[2:02:06] up don't wait on it get it right then
[2:02:08] don't wait around for some little thing
[2:02:10] to fester or some little thing to grow
[2:02:12] because it'll grow interest mm-hmm sure
[2:02:17] will
[2:02:17] and before long we're brother Evan said
[2:02:19] take the Christ right out of your heart
[2:02:21] you don't want those things in your life
[2:02:23] because how are you going to be able to
[2:02:25] live as free live as a free individual a
[2:02:29] servant of Jesus Christ how are you
[2:02:30] gonna live in such a manner if you allow
[2:02:32] a little things to build up if you got
[2:02:35] something against a brother don't let it
[2:02:36] just bill you don't talk about go to him
[2:02:40] and say listen buddy I don't understand
[2:02:43] all this I maybe it's me maybe it's you
[2:02:46] maybe it's us maybe it's something else
[2:02:48] I don't know but I need to talk to you I
[2:02:50] mean we don't do that a whole lot
[2:02:52] because we really don't trust the person
[2:02:54] we're trying to talk to we don't know
[2:02:56] exactly what kind of thing they're gonna
[2:02:57] pull off but I guarantee you one thing
[2:02:59] as long as you've got something in your
[2:03:01] heart toward them they've got more power
[2:03:03] over you than you've got over yourself
[2:03:05] and so you can either let it affect you
[2:03:08] or you can go to Jesus Christ and say
[2:03:09] god I'm writing me a check today I need
[2:03:11] to get this thing cleaned out of my life
[2:03:14] Amen that's right that's exactly right
[2:03:16] Peter said don't use your Liberty as a
[2:03:18] cloak of maliciousness a lot of people
[2:03:20] will try to use the message as a
[2:03:22] cover-up for them live in any old life
[2:03:25] they want to live somebody said to me
[2:03:27] one time well brother BAE and I do these
[2:03:29] things because I'm predestinated to make
[2:03:31] it I said hold on a minute
[2:03:32] I said predestination is a generic term
[2:03:35] generalized term I suggest because you
[2:03:38] use the word predestinated doesn't mean
[2:03:40] that you're actually predestinated to
[2:03:42] eternal life
[2:03:43] I said predestinate it could be a lot of
[2:03:44] things this bench right here tonight's
[2:03:47] been predestiny that wood was
[2:03:48] predestinated by God to be a bench
[2:03:50] sitting here in this church house amen
[2:03:53] that's true that suit of clothes you're
[2:03:55] wearing it was predestinated to be
[2:03:56] around your back the tree was
[2:03:59] predestinated to put forth its bloom
[2:04:01] those clouds were predestinated to be
[2:04:03] clouds lots of stuff is predestinated
[2:04:06] the question is what's it predestinated
[2:04:09] to the devil is predestinated demons
[2:04:12] were predestinated well just look at in
[2:04:15] the Bible there's certain are angels
[2:04:17] that God called elect angels
[2:04:19] that's predestination and there are
[2:04:22] other angels that were elected to be
[2:04:23] just like what they are today demons
[2:04:25] because that's where Devils came from
[2:04:27] they fell from heaven and they fell to
[2:04:29] the earth and now they influence man and
[2:04:31] influence everything around us in
[2:04:33] elected predestinated to do that very
[2:04:35] thing then I felt I said to me here's
[2:04:38] some time ago he said you know Paul said
[2:04:41] take a little wine for the stomach's
[2:04:42] sake so I can drink a little
[2:04:43] I'm predestinated I said I don't think
[2:04:47] that's what Paul was getting that boy he
[2:04:50] was trying to tell him because of the
[2:04:51] pollution of the system and things like
[2:04:53] that remember Timothy done the work of
[2:04:56] an evangelist and when he traveled
[2:04:59] different places he come up against all
[2:05:01] kinds of different foods and all kinds
[2:05:03] of different to the drinking's
[2:05:05] conditions and no doubt might have been
[2:05:07] involved in all kinds of things where it
[2:05:10] took bad water drank something that
[2:05:12] wasn't agreeable like that and Paul said
[2:05:13] take a little wine for the stomach's
[2:05:15] sake in other words Paul telling Timothy
[2:05:18] used a little wisdom when you travel so
[2:05:20] that way you don't catch an amoeba and
[2:05:21] die
[2:05:23] hey man but the cloak of maliciousness
[2:05:26] you know how that goes usually that's
[2:05:27] what we call down south being sneaky you
[2:05:30] know robbing Peter to get Paul you know
[2:05:33] I'm talking about how they say one thing
[2:05:35] to you oh I'm glory to God a brother
[2:05:37] told me here just said today in a
[2:05:39] certain country he said you got to be
[2:05:40] careful when you're preaching to him
[2:05:42] because as you're preaching to him he
[2:05:43] said they'll pat you on the back and say
[2:05:45] what a great job that was and said the
[2:05:46] minute you get out there sight they call
[2:05:48] the government on you and have you
[2:05:49] deported out of the country cloak of
[2:05:51] maliciousness you know oh I love you my
[2:05:55] precious brother and then when your back
[2:05:58] is turned they start talking all kinds
[2:06:00] of little things is that or the other
[2:06:02] that's the cloak of maliciousness lujah
[2:06:06] Peter and Paul both said don't do this
[2:06:09] Peter was a man who had the keys to
[2:06:11] heaven right open up the door to heaven
[2:06:13] Paul was the pattern of every messenger
[2:06:15] and every believer in that first church
[2:06:17] age and all these other Church ages Paul
[2:06:19] was a guy you got to listen to if you
[2:06:20] want to understand a message today and
[2:06:22] both of these men said that a Christian
[2:06:25] could become entangled in all kinds of
[2:06:27] little things see the problem is we
[2:06:31] throw people in hell when we see them
[2:06:32] entangled instead of trying to redeem
[2:06:34] him reconcile I'm in restoring a man hey
[2:06:40] man that's right now watch his brother
[2:06:42] Brahim says the hand of the Lord he said
[2:06:43] God doesn't want you being just a
[2:06:45] professor but he wants you to be a
[2:06:47] possessor amen now let's turn it up
[2:06:50] numbers chapter 19 verse 1 now I want
[2:06:52] you to notice this for just a moment how
[2:06:54] that there's another little type here in
[2:06:57] the Old Testament that applies to the
[2:07:00] Lord Jesus but it also applies to the
[2:07:02] church as well using the red heifer now
[2:07:04] I'm just going to use this as a kind of
[2:07:06] a to bring in more of my theme of what
[2:07:08] I'm preaching tonight but notice this
[2:07:10] numbers 19 at first 1 and the Lord spake
[2:07:12] unto Moses and Aaron saying this is the
[2:07:15] ordinance of the law which the LORD hath
[2:07:19] commanded now watch saying speak unto
[2:07:23] the children of Israel that they may
[2:07:24] bring the riddler without spot where it
[2:07:27] is no blemish and upon which never came
[2:07:30] a yoke blood Ram said this has a great
[2:07:34] meaning since you had to be a red one
[2:07:36] and he said wish we had time to go in
[2:07:38] all this but they said the yoke meant
[2:07:40] that Christ was not yoked up with
[2:07:43] anything on this earth a man he wasn't
[2:07:49] yoked up with an affiliation an
[2:07:51] organization Jesus what need a part of
[2:07:54] the boys club and you know the message
[2:07:57] has got plenty of them little circles
[2:08:01] you know they preached for this one and
[2:08:03] that one and preached for that one but
[2:08:04] God helped if anybody from the outside
[2:08:05] tries to preach for him if you're not in
[2:08:08] the circle if you're not in the club you
[2:08:09] might as well forget I'll remember you
[2:08:10] look clicks and things getting churches
[2:08:12] - oh come on preach to me I don't use
[2:08:16] excuse you listen you're doing more and
[2:08:17] listening you about half way huh ah I
[2:08:23] don't like this kind of preacher well
[2:08:25] it's where the rubber meets the road and
[2:08:26] if we're gonna get the car down the road
[2:08:28] this is the kind of preaching we need to
[2:08:29] hear I don't want to say you're pouting
[2:08:32] but you might be a little but if Jesus
[2:08:40] Christ refused to be yoked up with
[2:08:43] anything then why would the elect of God
[2:08:45] want to become bound to any kind of a
[2:08:47] system whenever you find yourself trying
[2:08:50] to please somebody else in order to be a
[2:08:52] servant of Christ in any way any
[2:08:54] capacity your honor you're living with a
[2:08:56] yoke on your neck and you shouldn't have
[2:08:59] to live that way if I have to worship in
[2:09:02] a way to please you or I have to preach
[2:09:04] in a way to please you then I'm not sure
[2:09:05] my yoke amen and remember we're supposed
[2:09:09] to be yoked up to Jesus Christ that's
[2:09:11] the only thing he was ever yoked to
[2:09:13] brother Gerald that was his church his
[2:09:14] body right but if you have to behave in
[2:09:18] a certain way this happens in families a
[2:09:20] lot of times one family member will
[2:09:22] think that Christ looks this way and
[2:09:24] wants everybody else to holler that same
[2:09:25] way hey listen boy your interpretation
[2:09:28] of Christianity and your family is not
[2:09:29] in your minds reputation in mine keep
[2:09:32] yours and yours and I'll keep mine in
[2:09:34] mind
[2:09:35] you worry about sweeping your steps and
[2:09:37] I'll worry about sweep in mind the
[2:09:39] people get under yoke you're gonna tell
[2:09:43] me brother Ben's got Facebook yeah and
[2:09:49] I'm still a Christian imagine that I'm
[2:09:52] still a believer imagine that you think
[2:09:55] that the waters on Facebook the world is
[2:09:58] in Burger King so quit going there what
[2:10:02] I'm trying to say to you as many times
[2:10:04] we get too excited about things that
[2:10:06] really don't have any effect on our
[2:10:09] Christianity at all whatsoever now if
[2:10:11] you find people getting hooked up on
[2:10:12] things in the internet and it's taking
[2:10:14] them to all kinds of deep dark places
[2:10:16] that might be one thing but as a general
[2:10:18] rule somebody using email can get in
[2:10:20] trouble as much as somebody on Twitter
[2:10:23] amen all it takes is for somebody to
[2:10:25] ring up a video chat out of their email
[2:10:27] system gmail has got a system where you
[2:10:28] can ring up a video I was in New Zealand
[2:10:30] my wife was calling me on video chat
[2:10:33] right through email and I thought to
[2:10:35] myself after we hung up I thought now
[2:10:37] how the devil could use that very thing
[2:10:38] writing an email don't need social media
[2:10:40] do it hey man come on preach to me what
[2:10:43] I'm trying to tell you brother I'm not
[2:10:45] trying to take up for Facebook what I'm
[2:10:46] trying to say is we get so excited about
[2:10:49] all of these little specific things
[2:10:51] because in our mind we feel like we have
[2:10:55] to make people Christians there's no
[2:10:59] such thing listen as parents we cannot
[2:11:02] make our children Christians as a pastor
[2:11:05] you cannot make the congregation
[2:11:07] Christians as the teachers and avenges
[2:11:09] we cannot make the people do anything if
[2:11:12] it's not in their heart I don't care
[2:11:14] what you tell them they'll never do what
[2:11:15] you preach it in unless it's in their
[2:11:19] heart I know people in this message I
[2:11:22] mean to tell you what's the truth you
[2:11:24] see them a beard it's red right I get
[2:11:26] that from my mama you don't know nothing
[2:11:28] about red oh do you
[2:11:30] and and we was talking the other day and
[2:11:33] somebody said even a preacher having
[2:11:36] facial hair they said well first of all
[2:11:39] brother BAM said if Jesus was here he'd
[2:11:41] be clean-shaven with a three-piece suit
[2:11:43] on I said I asked you a question
[2:11:45] where's your three-piece suit the point
[2:11:51] I'm trying to make brothers many times
[2:11:52] we try to yoke people up into things do
[2:11:56] it our way do it my way and if you don't
[2:11:58] impeach us are bad for that we try to
[2:12:00] preach to people our convictions do it
[2:12:02] that way cuz I'm the preacher if it
[2:12:04] don't come from the word then your
[2:12:06] convictions not gonna get me ready for
[2:12:07] the rapture I don't care who he is
[2:12:10] awakened from just like a certain place
[2:12:13] mention any names but whenever I've been
[2:12:18] told different places all you know we
[2:12:20] like the Prophet wonderful but God's got
[2:12:23] all kinds of preachers all kinds of
[2:12:25] people that can help in the body of
[2:12:26] Christ not just preachers but how about
[2:12:29] all these musicians sitting out here
[2:12:30] that bring on the Spirit of God you
[2:12:33] don't think we have these lovely
[2:12:34] services like we have over here in st.
[2:12:36] John's just because I walk out here and
[2:12:38] preach it do y'all this is yourself
[2:12:39] saying before I come out you're 90% of
[2:12:43] the reason we have such good services
[2:12:45] but you imagine what the meeting would
[2:12:47] be like if we got out here and nobody
[2:12:49] even trying to enter into worship in the
[2:12:50] first place it's a body move friends
[2:12:54] and we work together but we work as free
[2:12:58] not binding each other to one another's
[2:13:01] philosophies of life there's a certain
[2:13:05] church I know and I'm not just picking
[2:13:07] on people I'm trying to give you
[2:13:08] examples of what I'm talking about and
[2:13:09] and and this man said that a preacher
[2:13:11] cannot wear a colored shirt like yes I
[2:13:13] said oh god I'm in trouble because
[2:13:16] that's all I God just kind of shirts now
[2:13:19] that fella told me preacher shut and
[2:13:20] preach for the tamanna pulpit this is
[2:13:22] what I'm trying to tell you Jesus Christ
[2:13:25] wasn't yoked to anything he lived as a
[2:13:28] free man and we should live as free
[2:13:31] people if we're not careful what we end
[2:13:33] up doing is we use our convictions as a
[2:13:35] pattern of what we think Christianity
[2:13:37] looks like and all it does is puts
[2:13:39] people under bondage all the way through
[2:13:40] the church that's right now I want you
[2:13:48] to listen to this brother time talks
[2:13:49] about you said being you know full way
[2:13:52] Christians instead of halfway I like
[2:13:54] this remark you said Jesus Christ he
[2:13:56] said bears record with your spirit that
[2:13:58] you're a son and daughter of God if old
[2:13:59] things have passed away and all things
[2:14:00] become new he said so the salvation of
[2:14:02] Jesus Christ is not a hope so but it is
[2:14:05] a know so you know it when you are
[2:14:07] Christ now he said not a borderline
[2:14:10] minister not a borderline Christian he
[2:14:13] said if the crowds going this way you go
[2:14:15] with it or if they go that way you go
[2:14:17] with it he said and be not entangled
[2:14:19] again or halfway God said it makes him
[2:14:24] sick in other words he said it's a
[2:14:27] lukewarm so living a half way life is a
[2:14:31] lukewarm type of life this is why if we
[2:14:35] become entangled we should repent write
[2:14:37] some checks say God forgive me God have
[2:14:39] mercy on me because if you ain't careful
[2:14:41] you become lukewarm and if you want to
[2:14:43] live a lukewarm life the devil will
[2:14:45] absolutely allow you to live it he'll
[2:14:48] bother you just enough to keep you
[2:14:50] lukewarm praise the Lord right now watch
[2:14:55] this in questions and answers now I'm
[2:14:56] gonna try to close with this remark but
[2:14:59] I want you to listen at this way brother
[2:15:00] Brennan uses this and when I read this
[2:15:04] statement to you I want you to remember
[2:15:06] one thing
[2:15:06] first of all we
[2:15:08] no if this is a man or a woman they
[2:15:10] never identify themselves and I want you
[2:15:12] to pay attention to how the prophet of
[2:15:15] God discerns this case how he how he
[2:15:18] actually gets the meaning out of what's
[2:15:20] going on here now I'll call your
[2:15:22] attention to the fact that he does not
[2:15:24] use a vision he doesn't use discernment
[2:15:26] he doesn't go in our you live at
[2:15:28] such-and-such a house now these other
[2:15:30] things but I want you to see exactly how
[2:15:32] this comes about and let's read the
[2:15:33] question together he said now I live
[2:15:35] many years in December the rent until I
[2:15:37] found the Lord please I've sinned again
[2:15:39] and I'm not worthy to come before you in
[2:15:40] this holy place please tell me if I can
[2:15:43] be restored holy that's whil a while all
[2:15:45] the person holy again please but he said
[2:15:48] please help me brother Brown I have a
[2:15:50] devil in me he said will you lay your
[2:15:52] hands upon me and restore me again
[2:15:55] now I mind your friend if somebody come
[2:15:57] to you and ask you this kind of question
[2:15:59] like this you'd want to give them the
[2:16:00] very best answer you could possibly give
[2:16:02] them wouldn't you and here this
[2:16:05] individual now is ask him brother
[2:16:07] Branham for the help that they need now
[2:16:09] you would think Malachi for revelation
[2:16:12] 10 he's going to break into a
[2:16:14] supernatural vision of God oh I see you
[2:16:16] when yours a little child and the dog
[2:16:18] chased you on the porch and made you
[2:16:19] nervous he's going to break into some
[2:16:22] kind of a vision type thing or somehow
[2:16:25] to discernment you let it so and so on
[2:16:27] your house is so and so and such once
[2:16:29] you listen how brother Brenda's earns
[2:16:30] this case he said yes you have sinned
[2:16:33] but not so far but what you could be
[2:16:38] restored well how do you know brother
[2:16:43] Branham if you had sinned so far that
[2:16:46] you couldn't be restored
[2:16:47] you'd never want to be restored so
[2:16:54] brother Branham is deserting this case
[2:16:57] based on what the guy's desire or a gals
[2:17:00] desire to want to be restored back to
[2:17:03] Christ again
[2:17:04] oh my Lissa this he said you'd never
[2:17:08] want to be restored he said but see as
[2:17:09] long as there is something dealing with
[2:17:12] your heart you are still in the line of
[2:17:15] restoration that's a capital S that he
[2:17:17] uses there that's something he said
[2:17:20] guilty the lease is guilty the whole
[2:17:21] I have said many times oh I wish people
[2:17:24] would quote that more to message because
[2:17:27] brother Bram was not a perfect man
[2:17:30] mm-hmm that's exactly right he said
[2:17:32] every day every one of us do things we
[2:17:35] don't want to do he said if it's in our
[2:17:41] hearts that we don't want to be that way
[2:17:42] he said and you don't want to be that
[2:17:44] way you wouldn't be asking that question
[2:17:46] that in itself is proof that God is
[2:17:51] still dealing with you
[2:17:52] glory to God he said you've probably got
[2:17:56] nervous probably Satan telling you that
[2:17:58] you can't be restored he's lying
[2:18:00] certainly he is because look if there is
[2:18:03] a deep calling there's got to be a deep
[2:18:06] to respond to that call glory to God if
[2:18:09] there's a hunger for something that
[2:18:12] something has got to be somewhere or you
[2:18:15] would have no hunger for it at all
[2:18:17] oh brother do you know the thing that
[2:18:20] keeps us going the thing that keeps us
[2:18:22] walking forward it's that something that
[2:18:25] keeps holding on to our lives that's
[2:18:28] something of Jesus Christ amen Superman
[2:18:31] wears an S my Jesus does - amen is that
[2:18:35] sucked the game and the reason I can't
[2:18:37] give up is because he won't let me quit
[2:18:41] if I even tried to stop I'd be in
[2:18:45] trouble with him more than if I was to
[2:18:47] center rob a bank because it's more
[2:18:50] important for him than for admit for to
[2:18:52] him for me to keep on going because a
[2:18:57] Christian doesn't begin the race a
[2:18:59] Christian ends the race
[2:19:01] amen it's God that starts everything but
[2:19:04] the Christians got to keep fighting
[2:19:06] until they get all the way to the end
[2:19:07] and then the Holy Spirit takes him on
[2:19:09] home amen he doesn't want us to give up
[2:19:12] or to quit or to get lakhs or lazier or
[2:19:15] backward or any of that that's the
[2:19:17] reason why that every time you think
[2:19:19] you're within an inch of millimeter
[2:19:21] second water i've quitting and get
[2:19:23] something inside of you starts beating
[2:19:25] on the inside saying how can you quit
[2:19:27] something that you never began in the
[2:19:29] first place it's that something of
[2:19:33] Christ that desire that's the reason why
[2:19:36] that you keep moving like you move and
[2:19:39] no matter how much debt you get under no
[2:19:41] matter how much you mess up no matter
[2:19:42] how many mistakes you might make that
[2:19:44] little something on the inside of you
[2:19:46] just keeps pulling and pulling and
[2:19:48] pulling and brother if you've got that -
[2:19:50] not you ought to be the happiest person
[2:19:51] ever Wallace you later because I'll be
[2:19:54] millions go to hell 9 they wind up in
[2:19:56] the regions of the Lost this evening and
[2:19:58] never felt that something but one time
[2:20:00] in their life amen they'll sit on search
[2:20:03] pews they'll go out and hear sermons
[2:20:04] preached they'll turn on the television
[2:20:06] and some preacher be preaching to them
[2:20:08] and they'll feel a touch of God and turn
[2:20:10] it down and never feeling again in their
[2:20:11] life but I felt it every day since I've
[2:20:13] been born in this world I felt the call
[2:20:15] and the power of the Holy Spirit coming
[2:20:21] on me that's the reason I can't quit
[2:20:25] because of that something that keeps
[2:20:30] working on me amen
[2:20:34] this individual asked brother Branham
[2:20:35] brother Brown will you lay hands on me
[2:20:37] brother Branham says I could lay hands
[2:20:39] on you
[2:20:40] he said that's only sanctioning he said
[2:20:43] when we lay our hands on somebody he
[2:20:45] said we're only sanctioning that you
[2:20:46] believe it really I know and if they got
[2:20:49] faith all that the light passes through
[2:20:51] the hand like you said in a Masai on 61
[2:20:52] and if they got faith the Holy Spirit
[2:20:54] uses the hand transmitted burt's you
[2:20:57] down in there when that little woman
[2:20:58] touched Jesus virtue came out his body I
[2:21:00] know all that but the hand itself
[2:21:02] doesn't do anything it's only a sanction
[2:21:05] you say you believe it I say I believe
[2:21:08] it we both believe the word and I
[2:21:10] sanctioned that you believe the word and
[2:21:12] brother brems says these words he said I
[2:21:14] could lay hands on you he said but that
[2:21:15] do you any good he said what would do
[2:21:18] you the best good is to realize that
[2:21:20] you're already free and you just don't
[2:21:23] realize it just recognize that you've
[2:21:26] already been freed so I'm trying to tell
[2:21:28] you the Jubilee has already sounded
[2:21:30] we've already been made freed he talks
[2:21:32] about little Johnny crow remember the
[2:21:34] story he had to rope around his leg and
[2:21:36] was tied up there and you know and he
[2:21:38] went ten foot that way and so forth and
[2:21:39] on then the farmer cut that rope off his
[2:21:42] leg and the little crow went the same
[2:21:43] distances all the way around there amen
[2:21:45] but one day the little crows gonna have
[2:21:47] to look at his leg and realize there
[2:21:49] ain't no rope on me
[2:21:51] there ain't no bondage on me I go as
[2:21:54] high in God as God will permit and as I
[2:21:56] want to be and I go as low as what I
[2:21:58] want to - amen so what I'm trying to say
[2:22:01] is with all these little entanglements
[2:22:03] that exist around us if we're not
[2:22:05] careful we'll get so entangled in
[2:22:08] something the devil say see there you're
[2:22:10] never got just look at your leg little
[2:22:12] Johnny just realize the Rope has already
[2:22:15] been cut and when you get trapped in
[2:22:17] something you just remember that you are
[2:22:19] not trapped that's only the devil lyin
[2:22:21] to you there's always a way out because
[2:22:25] my Bible tells me it's that our
[2:22:28] temptations and things of that nature
[2:22:29] says nothing that's not common to man
[2:22:31] but said with every temptation he makes
[2:22:34] a way of escape for us to be able to get
[2:22:37] out of it amen when I can fall under the
[2:22:40] valley it's like like you used to say
[2:22:42] back home in Manchester and we preach
[2:22:44] this a lot to the people and we tell
[2:22:45] them back home and say when you get in
[2:22:48] the mat there was a group of women it
[2:22:49] used to sing a song so when you get in
[2:22:51] the valley just remember that in the
[2:22:53] valley all you're doing is just changing
[2:22:54] mountaintops amen amen
[2:22:57] you're not even really just trying to
[2:22:59] live in the valley so much but you're
[2:23:00] looking for a road because somehow
[2:23:02] another you wound up there somehow
[2:23:04] another you wound up in the valley you
[2:23:05] can't help that that's Christianity
[2:23:07] character is a victory not a gift
[2:23:10] somehow another you wind up in them
[2:23:12] places but not I forget hey man just
[2:23:15] keep looking for a road out of there
[2:23:16] because God's made a way of escape you
[2:23:19] can be free if you want to be free but
[2:23:23] it's up to you
[2:23:24] Jubilee has sounded and depending on the
[2:23:27] amount of debt that you've got against
[2:23:29] your life
[2:23:29] maybe if it's a little small thing for
[2:23:31] some people you know his fella told me a
[2:23:34] joke the other day and I know we
[2:23:35] shouldn't joke in the pulpit but it's
[2:23:36] applicable to what I want to talk about
[2:23:38] but what I've been talking about and he
[2:23:40] said this guy got down and him Holy
[2:23:42] Ghost meeting and said one was a lawyer
[2:23:44] and one was a doctor and he said he got
[2:23:46] down and said he the doctor knelt down
[2:23:48] he started praying and he said Oh God
[2:23:51] forgive me I'm a sinner he's God
[2:23:52] fulfilled him when the Holy Ghost right
[2:23:54] there said hours into the night some
[2:23:56] eight or ten or twelve hours he said
[2:23:58] that lawyer was still praying all of a
[2:23:59] sudden 1269 he broke through to the Holy
[2:24:02] Ghost and got a foot in the Holy Ghost
[2:24:03] and he said how is I noticed you got the
[2:24:06] Holy Ghost pretty quick he said how'd
[2:24:07] you get it so quick he said well you're
[2:24:09] a lawyer see he said I'm a doctor he
[2:24:12] said first of all he said as a doctor he
[2:24:13] said I don't do like lawyers do he said
[2:24:16] you spent all night pleading your case
[2:24:17] he said I just walked in and told the
[2:24:19] surgeon just cut on me do what you got
[2:24:21] to do alleluia alleluia
[2:24:26] amen it just depends on whether we want
[2:24:28] to recognize whether we're free or not
[2:24:31] you stand with me amen returning to
[2:24:37] freedom now if you want to be free you
[2:24:40] can be listen this statement brother
[2:24:43] brems said laying on a hands he said
[2:24:44] that's a great thing yes I believe in
[2:24:46] that he said but that that's just a
[2:24:48] tradition if I could lay hands upon
[2:24:51] people week in and week out now you know
[2:24:57] how people are today
[2:24:58] boy if the Prophet was here whoo glory
[2:25:01] to God the proper was here he said I
[2:25:05] could lay hands on you week in and week
[2:25:07] out and still that wouldn't do you no
[2:25:09] good he said until you accepted what
[2:25:13] Jesus Christ has already done for you it
[2:25:17] ain't about who lays their hands on you
[2:25:19] it ain't hear about plays the piano or
[2:25:22] plays the guitar or the organ or the
[2:25:23] bass or who sings the songs that end
[2:25:26] about the the messenger it ain't about
[2:25:28] any of that
[2:25:29] it's about your faith that's tied it's
[2:25:32] not about who pastors or who teaches or
[2:25:35] who deacons or who whatever that's
[2:25:37] that's our problem we've attached
[2:25:39] Christianity and we put a certain face
[2:25:41] to it
[2:25:42] and so if the face is something that we
[2:25:44] like well that's Christianity and we
[2:25:46] don't like it well yeah jury's still out
[2:25:50] and we'd have a tendency to to I'd we'd
[2:25:54] we brand almost if you will we brand
[2:25:56] what we think Christianity looks like
[2:25:58] when really the truth of the matter is
[2:26:00] is that really it's not about the person
[2:26:03] themself remember the message look into
[2:26:06] the unseen in California and fifty-nine
[2:26:09] brother Bram is that the platform he's
[2:26:10] preaching and the he's worked with the
[2:26:12] people and he's standing up there and
[2:26:14] all of a sudden the Holy Spirit speaks
[2:26:15] through remember that I this is I the
[2:26:17] Lord this is not William Brennan this is
[2:26:18] I the Lord why don't people identify
[2:26:21] that way when I listen to tapes that
[2:26:24] ain't brother Brennan they're hearing
[2:26:25] the voice of God speaking in that word
[2:26:27] and I don't mean everything brother
[2:26:29] Branham ever said was God I don't
[2:26:31] believe the best cooks are in Texas or
[2:26:33] Arkansas or Kentucky or the 12 of the
[2:26:36] places he said the best cooks work I
[2:26:38] don't believe that stuff saith the Lord
[2:26:39] but when I hear them starting working
[2:26:42] into that message and the Holy Spirit
[2:26:44] starts falling on that gift I realize
[2:26:46] that's not William Branham that's the
[2:26:49] Lord speaking through a voice and that
[2:26:51] same voice can speak through me speak
[2:26:53] through you speak through any of us and
[2:26:57] we don't need necessarily brother
[2:26:58] Branham to stand here like this and say
[2:27:00] all right now good evening friends and
[2:27:03] all my you know people and brother Ram
[2:27:04] will walk down the platform and say you
[2:27:05] step behind that curtain so you feel the
[2:27:07] Holy Ghost go Lord people start crying
[2:27:08] and weeping well sure when you have a
[2:27:11] ministry that's supposed to attract the
[2:27:13] entire world God gives you an anointing
[2:27:16] that will attract the entire world why
[2:27:19] don't I have that kind of anointing
[2:27:20] because my ministry is supposed to
[2:27:21] attract the whole world I've got my 15
[2:27:24] or 20 that I attract and that's about it
[2:27:26] hopefully I remain attractive to my wife
[2:27:29] as long as they as I get older that is
[2:27:34] you know what I'm saying the people they
[2:27:38] in their mind that have oh boy if
[2:27:39] brother Brennan was here but see it's
[2:27:41] not about brother Branham it's about
[2:27:44] you're realizing I'm a Christian I've
[2:27:47] got the Holy Ghost
[2:27:48] do you realize he said that whenever
[2:27:50] somebody would come up to be prayed for
[2:27:52] for divine healing the you realized
[2:27:53] brother Brennan said it really wasn't
[2:27:55] him that had
[2:27:55] gift of healing do you know that he said
[2:27:59] it's you
[2:27:59] he said the gift of healing is in you he
[2:28:03] said I know it angel told me and he said
[2:28:05] I'll be faithful to my Commission he
[2:28:07] said but my precious friends he said
[2:28:09] when you woke up here
[2:28:10] he said that gift is in you you're the
[2:28:12] one that's believing for healing and the
[2:28:14] gift of healing is in you but we attach
[2:28:17] faces identities and we said well hold
[2:28:21] mine we get in trouble you know how well
[2:28:22] I thought and so was here to pray for me
[2:28:24] if you just only knew the God that lives

[2:34:09] Romans 3:23 said for all of sin comes
[2:34:11] short of the glory of God being
[2:34:14] justified freely by His grace through
[2:34:15] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[2:34:18] the word redemption here is actually in
[2:34:21] two parts it comes from a Greek compound
[2:34:24] word and one apple which means the
[2:34:28] separation of one thing from another and
[2:34:31] then the union or fellowship of those
[2:34:35] two those ones that were unionized
[2:34:37] destroyed and then the other part of
[2:34:40] this word Lutron which means the paying
[2:34:43] of a ransom in order to literature led
[2:34:47] to liberate so in order for us to be
[2:34:49] free somebody had to come and separate
[2:34:53] us from the union of that old nature
[2:34:55] that we live with and in doing so he
[2:34:59] could pay our price pay our debts that
[2:35:03] we can be free once you receive the Holy
[2:35:07] Ghost remember this all the rest of your
[2:35:09] days you are not waiting to be free you
[2:35:13] are all ready free you just don't
[2:35:16] recognize the church you think you do
[2:35:19] but you don't recognize it like you
[2:35:20] should yet but one day that revelation
[2:35:23] is going to strike your deeper that's
[2:35:24] ever struck you before and when that

[2:35:28] body and say change
[2:35:33] amen you'll just speak to it change the

[3:04:04] 4:00 in the morning last night trying to
[3:04:05] get here to Newfoundland I am exhausted
[3:04:08] I'm going to bed yeah I told you that
[3:04:13] because I want you to pray for me
[3:04:14] grateful my lord gives me strength now
[3:04:17] what you heard tonight might be
[3:04:19] regurgitated food from Edmonton I guess
[3:04:21] a little bit maybe but I got so many new
[3:04:23] things coming this weekend but I wanted
[3:04:26] to set the tone for this meeting by what
[3:04:27] I preach tonight that's what I want to
[3:04:30] dig into this weekend I got some fresh
[3:04:31] stuff coming I never preached before and
[3:04:33] all of my years 28 years I've preached I
[3:04:35] never preached this one get ready preach
[3:04:36] tomorrow and Sunday by the help the Lord
[3:04:38] have got to give me grace to get into it
[3:04:40] but I wanted to set the tone tonight
[3:04:42] because I wanted every one of you to
[3:04:43] hear the message the message the theme
[3:04:45] of tonight is this one thing no matter
[3:04:47] what you get entangled with you're
[3:04:49] already been made free you don't have to
[3:04:52] live under bondage I love you Church god
[3:04:57] bless you for the job I appreciate you
[3:05:00] friend
[3:05:03] precision good night I'll see you
[3:05:06] tomorrow
[3:05:07] hey man face the Lord just to say thank
[3:05:15] God for the word I won't make more many
[3:05:18] more comments I could go by my notes I
[3:05:21] got here but they'll go on for another
[3:05:23] hour but thank God I believe it was it
[3:05:26] wasn't brother man it was the Lord amen
[3:05:28] I really truly believe it was God
[3:05:30] ministering to us as individuals here
[3:05:32] tonight a mayor there was not one of us
[3:05:35] but God said something here tonight for
[3:05:37] you so I trust that we read the Holy
[3:05:39] Ghost on on the inside of the inside so
[3:05:42] that we recognize God speaking to me a
[3:05:45] man you had that ear of the soul a man
[3:05:48] so that wasn't somebody else wasn't this
[3:05:51] one wasn't that one it was you
[3:05:53] a man so we got to take the word and we
[3:05:56] will apply it personally to ourselves by
[3:05:58] the grace of God and again thank God
[3:06:01] we're free he whom the Sun sets free is
[3:06:04] free indeed
[3:06:05] that's good a man because the Bible says
[3:06:08] now nobody can lay a charge against
[3:06:10] God's elect a man why because our sins
[3:06:12] are gone in the sea of this
[3:06:14] forgetfulness past present future it's
[3:06:16] gone so I pray God we got that faith
[3:06:19] amen in the finish work of Calvary
[3:06:22] praise the name of the Lord he's not
[3:06:25] doing it and got to do it again and
[3:06:27] again he's done it amen it's settled by
[3:06:30] the grace of God to God be the glory
[3:06:32] amen
[3:06:34] that's the maybe we're seeing seeing
[3:06:37] this course again Lord help me run in
[3:06:39] the race
[3:06:39] amen praise the name of Lord and God
[3:06:42] bless brother Ben being prayer for it
[3:06:43] God give him rest in his body rest in
[3:06:46] his soul rest of his spirit amen
[3:06:49] so we're going to come forth tomorrow
[3:06:50] and hear the word of God again amen come
