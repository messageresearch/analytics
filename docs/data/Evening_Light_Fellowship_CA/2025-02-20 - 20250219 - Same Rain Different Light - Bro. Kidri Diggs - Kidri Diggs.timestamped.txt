[43:54] so many things he said in that you know
[43:56] it just
[43:57] it it Tu me to a place to where I begin
[44:01] to ask myself am I growing in
[44:04] Christ you know and all together church
[44:07] we ought to be asking ourself are we
[44:09] growing in Christ now let's just start
[44:12] with the anointing Hallelujah when the
[44:14] anointing when the rain comes Hallelujah
[44:18] the Bible said at just the smell of it
[44:21] at the smell of it at the smell of water
[44:24] something begins to connect with that
[44:27] seed and life begins to come forth now
[44:30] if I ask the question how do you respond
[44:33] in church when the rain
[44:35] falls how do you respond when the
[44:37] anointing comes in the midst of bethl
[44:40] Hallelujah now it's the same rain
[44:44] Hallelujah that's that's that's falling
[44:46] in denominations hallelujah amen they
[44:49] sing some of the same songs they're
[44:52] inspired by some of the same music but
[44:55] the question is when the rain come comes
[44:57] is something being unlocked in your
[45:00] life because clearly in job the Bible
[45:03] says that that this tree can be cut down
[45:06] and when the root Hallelujah comes in
[45:09] contact with the smell of water
[45:11] something begins to be unlocked and It
[45:14] prepares itself to grow again Hallelujah
[45:18] even though it went to a season where
[45:21] something cut it down it went to a
[45:23] season where something was dry just the
[45:25] smell of water Hallelujah just just the
[45:29] presence of that anointing that rain
[45:32] unlock something in that tree to say I
[45:35] want to give
[45:36] more hallelujah hallelujah and and one
[45:41] of the reasons why I believe we go I'm
[45:44] going this way because uh in my travels
[45:48] I look around and I go places and people
[45:50] don't even respond when the anointing is
[45:54] falling on Amen
[46:02] we've gotten so used to uh good songs
[46:05] and a good song service you know and the
[46:08] presence of God comes down the rain
[46:11] comes down Hallelujah to drive demons
[46:14] away the rain comes down to give us
[46:17] strength the rain comes down in the
[46:20] power of his resurrection and we don't
[46:22] even respond to
[46:25] it but the rain comes so it can unlock
[46:30] something in the seed Hallelujah but not
[46:33] only unlock it comes and it falls so
[46:36] that you don't remain in the same
[46:40] condition that's the purpose of the
[46:42] anointing the anointing comes to break
[46:45] yolks the anointing comes to destroy the
[46:49] hole that the enemy has on you amen
[46:52] these songs these atmospheres that we
[46:55] are experiencing not for us to walk out
[46:57] the same way we came in but it's
[46:59] supposed to ignite something in our
[47:03] lives something Hallelujah is is
[47:06] supposed to respond when the rain comes
[47:10] Hallelujah we used to sing a song open
[47:13] the flood gates of
[47:16] Heaven Let It
[47:19] Rain think about that Hallelujah if the
[47:22] rain is coming from the heavens
[47:26] Hallelujah amen and we don't acknowledge
[47:29] it that means we're not even
[47:32] understanding his
[47:33] presence hallelujah amen oh my but look
[47:38] the reason why I said sing rain
[47:42] different light Hallelujah because we
[47:45] all have seen maybe churches online or
[47:48] whatever uh uh let me take the group um
[47:51] that everybody's listening to right now
[47:53] uh Maverick City
[47:57] H I keep going I get you
[48:01] now but you take some of the songs they
[48:04] sing like promises and and all the rest
[48:08] of them you know what I'm talking
[48:10] about some of these same songs that we
[48:13] listen to Under the inspiration of the
[48:17] rain Hallelujah see it's the same rain
[48:21] they feel the presence of God just like
[48:23] we do Hallelujah but the difference is
[48:27] the light Hallelujah see there's two
[48:29] things that's going on Hallelujah even
[48:32] in this service church one the rain
[48:35] which is the anointing and the other is
[48:37] the light Hallelujah the light is what
[48:40] the word hallelujah people have
[48:43] experienced the anointing but there's a
[48:45] different light that we walk in
[48:48] Hallelujah if I can by the grace of God
[48:51] I want to read to you what the what the
[48:53] prophet of God said see what we ought to
[48:56] do is uh not uh if I can say it like
[49:01] this let worship and things get so
[49:04] common to us on Amen because when it
[49:07] gets common then it starts to lose its
[49:12] fire when it gets caling Hallelujah then
[49:15] it starts to lose the effect of it
[49:18] Hallelujah and normally when things get
[49:21] common to us hallelujah we just ignore
[49:24] it when it gets common to us I never
[49:27] want the rain presence anointing of God
[49:30] to get comeing to me cuz it's those
[49:33] times Hallelujah when you least expected
[49:36] when God is in the
[49:38] room church for a moment Hallelujah ask
[49:42] yourself are you conscious of God are we
[49:45] conscious when we worship that you're
[49:47] not worshiping brother
[49:49] Tony Hallelujah these songs we sing We
[49:52] Sing unto almighty God hallelujah these
[49:55] brothers that are playing instruments
[49:57] and sisters that are playing the
[49:58] instruments is not unto their own doing
[50:01] but it's for one reason Hallelujah and
[50:04] it's to exalt the
[50:08] king but when the rain falls how do we
[50:11] respond to the Rain listen the prophet
[50:15] of God say he says now we can do many
[50:17] things we can take communion Hallelujah
[50:21] we can be baptized we can come to church
[50:25] have our names on the book
[50:27] or just be or or be just as respect and
[50:32] reverent as we can be and still be
[50:37] lost oh my think about that you can sit
[50:41] in the presence of God reverent you can
[50:44] be baptized pay your tithes do all these
[50:47] things and still be lost right amen amen
[50:52] he said that's a solemn he said that's a
[50:55] solemn warning
[50:57] we could be
[50:58] just as just rejoice when the spirit
[51:02] would fall and in a meeting when the
[51:05] word was being preached and our souls
[51:08] would just Rejoice with the word and
[51:10] still be lost listen what he says the
[51:13] rain falls on the just and
[51:17] unjust now if I can stop right there
[51:19] Hallelujah the anointing the Bible
[51:21] brother DS ain't making us up the Bible
[51:23] the the Bible says that the rain the
[51:26] anointing in is in the message and is in
[51:28] denominations all
[51:33] right H hallelujah or should I say it
[51:37] like this the rain when it falls in our
[51:40] midst Hallelujah people with the Holy
[51:42] Ghost are blessed and people without the
[51:44] Holy Ghost are blessed Hallelujah and
[51:47] brother Jason I think that's what the
[51:48] problem is we walk out experiencing the
[51:50] rain and we walk out saying I'm all
[51:52] right no we must come into a birth
[51:57] we must come into an experience with God
[51:59] but when God comes we acknowledge his
[52:04] presence all of creation acknowledges
[52:08] the sun when it
[52:10] rises not by choice they don't have a
[52:15] choice cuz nothing's going to stop the
[52:18] Sun from
[52:19] rising but listen he said the rain falls
[52:22] on the just and the unjust the same rain
[52:25] that makes the wheat grow make weeds
[52:27] grow hallelujah amen but if I could say
[52:31] it like this my inspiration is tonight
[52:33] church is are you growing amen
[52:36] hallelujah amen we experience good
[52:39] Services good word good atmospheres but
[52:42] are you growing cuz the only reason why
[52:45] Hallelujah rain connects with the seed
[52:48] is to unlock the life that life may come
[52:51] forth now there's two things that a seed
[52:54] must have it must have water and life
[52:56] you're already
[53:03] dirt hallelujah hallelujah we already
[53:07] five and six feet of dirt so there's two
[53:10] things that we need in our journey one
[53:13] is water we need a holy a holy ghost
[53:17] filled
[53:18] atmosphere H we need to come in contact
[53:22] with the anointing of God the reign of
[53:25] God H cuz it's by that rain that you
[53:28] grow it's by that rain that it unlock
[53:31] something in your life Hallelujah to
[53:33] give back to God what he put inside of
[53:36] you Hallelujah you see how important it
[53:38] is to respond when the rain is
[53:41] falling Hallelujah that seed is no good
[53:45] if it doesn't come in contact with
[53:49] rain amen
[53:52] hallelujah it can't grow without water
[53:55] am it can't produce without water we
[53:58] need the anointing but don't take it for
[54:01] granted
[54:03] on no I ain't going to be long I'm about
[54:07] to
[54:08] close but church if we look and we
[54:10] examine think about how many powerful
[54:14] worship Services we've
[54:15] had amen and we walk out with the same
[54:18] struggles we walk out with the same
[54:21] problems the same questions the
[54:24] anointing came to do something in life
[54:27] hallelujah amen and I love how the
[54:30] Pastor said it's it's it's lifting us up
[54:33] hallelujah amen it's not by choice but
[54:36] when we get in the presence of God this
[54:38] is the thing I want you to understand in
[54:40] that atmosphere when the rain Hallelujah
[54:43] is falling either you're yielding or
[54:48] resisting that's right amen some people
[54:52] don't like
[54:54] rain cuz they don't want to
[54:56] touched
[54:58] Hallelujah but sometimes the rain
[55:01] Hallelujah it'll identify what kind of
[55:04] material you
[55:06] are
[55:07] oh now I got certain shoes that I wear I
[55:11] don't like to wear in the
[55:12] rain because the what the rain will do
[55:15] the rain will War the the material or or
[55:18] mess it up so I don't wear that kind of
[55:20] stuff in the rain but then there are
[55:22] some things in the rain that are
[55:24] waterproof Hallelujah and you know what
[55:27] church there are too many Christians
[55:29] Hallelujah that are
[55:32] waterproof Hallelujah there too many
[55:35] Christians that can be in the presence
[55:36] of God and not be
[55:39] touched there too many people that can
[55:42] experience the rain and not be affected
[55:44] H I don't know about you guys but when
[55:46] I'm in a storm and I run from my car
[55:49] Hallelujah when I run from my car to the
[55:51] house I get whack I get affected by the
[55:54] storm Hallelujah sometimes I have go and
[55:56] change clothes sometimes I have to go
[55:58] was wipe my head Hallelujah but I get
[56:01] touched by the rain
[56:03] Hallelujah ask yourself what was the
[56:05] last time you were touched by the rain
[56:08] no I'm not trying to make you jump and
[56:10] Shout I'm asking you are you
[56:13] growing that's good brother that's right
[56:16] cuz the rain comes to unlock that seed
[56:20] even though it's been cut
[56:23] down amen
[56:28] even though it's been cut down when the
[56:30] rain
[56:31] falls something is supposed to be
[56:34] unlocked yes now you ask yourself am I
[56:37] in the same spot I was in last year that
[56:40] means you're not growing even though
[56:42] you're experiencing the same
[56:45] rain same rain yeah same rain same song
[56:49] leader same musicians some of the same
[56:52] songs same church same atmosphere and
[56:56] you are still in the same place
[56:59] spiritually something's wrong with that
[57:01] picture Hallelujah either Hallelujah
[57:05] you're not Hallelujah being reverent to
[57:08] the anointing hallelujah or you're
[57:10] ignoring it
[57:12] wow amen that's the thing about being a
[57:15] free more agent
[57:17] Hallelujah listen you say brother DS
[57:20] what do you mean look Hallelujah there
[57:22] are people hallelujah in this church
[57:25] that used to do specials I haven't heard
[57:27] do a special in years amen amen does
[57:31] that mean you're growing or you're
[57:33] dodging the
[57:36] rain think about it Hallelujah when the
[57:40] anointing Falls it's supposed to bring
[57:43] more out of you Hallelujah but how often
[57:48] we leave a good service and we know God
[57:51] was in there we know God talked to us
[57:55] and we walk out with the
[58:00] attitude church now I I'm preaching to
[58:03] myself
[58:04] also because I feel like all of us who
[58:08] are still here that means we haven't
[58:11] obtained yet that means there's still
[58:14] room for growth Hallelujah there's still
[58:16] more that God wants to unlock out of
[58:18] your life Hallelujah I've seen Hall
[58:21] young people pray and pray for a spouse
[58:24] and then they get the spouse and they
[58:25] disappear
[58:31] come on anointed
[58:34] to anointed
[58:37] lies same
[58:39] rain different light amen so we can see
[58:44] that the rain
[58:46] Hallelujah the rain the anointing
[58:49] Hallelujah that's the type of the rain
[58:51] the anointing he says he says um he says
[58:55] in that day
[58:56] I'm going go back and read it Isaiah 10
[58:59] it
[59:01] says and it shall come to pass in that
[59:03] day that his burden shall be taken away
[59:07] from off thy shoulders some of you got
[59:10] heavy shoulders you know why cuz you're
[59:12] dodging the anointing all right
[59:15] on whoa oh my he said and his Yol from
[59:19] off thy neck and the Yoke shall be
[59:22] destroyed because of the
[59:24] rain because of the anointing
[59:27] how often do we come to church and we
[59:29] look for
[59:31] deliverance Hallelujah I ain't talking
[59:33] about a special meeting hallelujah
[59:35] sister J what about what about I'm sorry
[59:37] you're not sister y she look like a
[59:38] little bit but but but think about it
[59:41] what if we Hallelujah are in a place in
[59:44] our life Hallelujah before we get to
[59:48] Camp amen before we get to Camp we're
[59:51] already anointed before we get to Camp
[59:54] we're already walking in his presence
[59:57] before we come back Sunday morning we've
[59:59] already bathed in the
[1:00:00] rain the rain not just a drizzle but a
[1:00:04] downpour you bathed and you've labored
[1:00:07] In God's Presence till all your yolks
[1:00:09] and burdens have been destroyed because
[1:00:11] of the
[1:00:13] rain what if right now you would tap
[1:00:15] into the anointing God would do
[1:00:17] something special in your
[1:00:20] life
[1:00:24] God but what do we do we resist the
[1:00:27] anointing because people are afraid of
[1:00:32] emotion and if I can hallelujah what you
[1:00:36] call the thing uh a pet
[1:00:39] piece I got a pet
[1:00:41] piece why all of a
[1:00:44] sudden Ministries are badgering the
[1:00:48] worship come on come on well all of a
[1:00:51] sudden Ministries are taking a stab at
[1:00:53] to worship h because it's the enemy
[1:00:57] Hallelujah trying to keep you from
[1:00:59] Catching the
[1:01:01] anointing trying to keep you from
[1:01:03] Catching your freedom and your Liberty
[1:01:06] by looking at Hallelujah the way you
[1:01:08] worship and the way it sound who cares
[1:01:10] long as I get
[1:01:17] delivered oh brother you were just a
[1:01:20] little too
[1:01:23] loud knock it out come on oh brother no
[1:01:27] kicking and shouting you know what you
[1:01:30] people that feel like that I doubt they
[1:01:32] could have been in brother Brandon's
[1:01:35] meetings they say they message Believers
[1:01:38] but when they see the anointing
[1:01:40] sometimes they fall under the same tree
[1:01:42] that the Sadducees and Pharisees fall
[1:01:44] under because yeah they were fundamental
[1:01:47] yeah they had all their Traditions but
[1:01:49] when Jesus came who was the opening of
[1:01:51] the word who was the anointing himself
[1:01:54] they called it a devil
[1:01:56] right my and it's still the same Spirit
[1:01:59] looking at the true anointing of God
[1:02:02] calling it a
[1:02:04] devil praise God that's Hallelujah but I
[1:02:08] refuse to become cold formal and
[1:02:13] Powerless
[1:02:17] I I refuse to be a church with no
[1:02:21] testimony I refuse to be a church
[1:02:23] Hallelujah that'll be quiet about
[1:02:26] goodness of
[1:02:27] [Applause]

[1:03:07] wouldn't be able to have children

[1:07:27] mind in a certain place
[1:07:30] Hallelujah to where all the distractions
[1:07:33] wouldn't deter his
[1:07:35] vision all the distractions with with
[1:07:38] with life wouldn't destroy what was in
[1:07:41] his mind Hallelujah and there's one
[1:07:44] place he says hallelujah if you knew
[1:07:47] what it take Hallelujah to get where I
[1:07:50] am you wouldn't want to follow
[1:07:53] me oh my
[1:07:56] church we haven't come through a
[1:07:58] Hallelujah a bed of ease so I say to all
[1:08:01] of you you have a right to rejoice in
[1:08:05] God oh my if we can hit it we can hit it
[1:08:08] real good you got a right to clap on a
[1:08:10] twofold or 13 a 56 a 8 n however the
[1:08:15] Lord want to leave you to praise you
[1:08:17] praise amen come on
[1:08:20] amen amen oh myj
[1:08:26] but are you growing in the presence of
[1:08:29] that rain Hallelujah because the rain
[1:08:33] comes to pull something out of you yes
[1:08:37] that's right now that's the first
[1:08:38] initiation all right we've experienced
[1:08:40] the rain but now the other thing that
[1:08:43] happens with the seed when it rains what
[1:08:46] also makes it grow is the light you need
[1:08:49] light but we don't have the same light
[1:08:52] we have a different light a more complex
[1:08:55] light
[1:08:59] oh
[1:09:01] my church you know as time went along
[1:09:04] don't get nervous I ain't going to be
[1:09:05] too much longer you know as time went
[1:09:08] along how they how they projected
[1:09:12] light it progressed Hallelujah but it
[1:09:16] was always there
[1:09:19] amen only a certain group of people
[1:09:22] could walk in that light the revealing
[1:09:25] of that light now look Hallelujah the
[1:09:28] Bible
[1:09:29] says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[1:09:34] a light unto my path H so the word is a
[1:09:39] type of light Hallelujah see we don't
[1:09:41] have the same light that Luther had we
[1:09:45] don't have the same light that Noah had
[1:09:48] we don't have the same light that Moses
[1:09:50] had we got the same rain but a different
[1:09:53] light Hallelujah
[1:09:56] he's still the same God the same
[1:09:57] anointing throughout the generations but
[1:10:00] now there's a different message
[1:10:01] Hallelujah because there's a different
[1:10:03] achievement or overcoming that God wants
[1:10:06] from this church are you growing in the
[1:10:09] light hallelujah look he said Thy word
[1:10:13] is a lamp unto my feet Hallelujah the
[1:10:17] light a light unto my path oh my so
[1:10:21] church as we walk in the light it
[1:10:23] illuminates our Direction
[1:10:27] it'll show you where you should go and
[1:10:28] where you shouldn't go that's what the
[1:10:30] word of the hour will do if you're
[1:10:34] participating and paying attention in
[1:10:36] and let me say like this when the true
[1:10:38] anointing Falls it'll make you want to
[1:10:40] go
[1:10:41] study oh that was kind of
[1:10:46] weak
[1:10:47] oh I hope y'all not waiting on the
[1:10:49] ministry to give it all to
[1:10:52] you Hallelujah
[1:10:57] look I just want to give you some forms
[1:11:00] of
[1:11:01] light one form of light is called
[1:11:03] hologen yeah we've heard of that right
[1:11:06] amen a hologen light is is that kind of
[1:11:10] light that gives you a natural feeling
[1:11:13] of white light now everything I'm going
[1:11:15] to every every every form of light I'm
[1:11:17] talking about I want you to put it in a
[1:11:21] bulb amen now you take a hologen and put
[1:11:24] it in a bulb it's it's it's a it's a
[1:11:27] natural feeling of white light but then
[1:11:30] there's another one called
[1:11:33] incandesent it said this light
[1:11:35] Hallelujah is heated up until it
[1:11:40] glows
[1:11:42] wow oh my it's still anointed H but now
[1:11:47] it's a different light huah one light is
[1:11:51] is is is is there to feel more natural
[1:11:54] or more natural white but this light
[1:11:56] Hallelujah the next light is heated up
[1:11:59] Hallelujah but when it projects white it
[1:12:02] looks like it's glowing
[1:12:05] Hallelujah when was the last time the
[1:12:07] word was in your life and you felt like
[1:12:09] you were
[1:12:11] glowing you feel like the word was
[1:12:13] having such an effect in your life that
[1:12:15] when somebody seeing you they say when I
[1:12:17] see you I see the
[1:12:23] Father John the Baptist was
[1:12:26] glowing oh
[1:12:28] my the disciples Hallelujah they were
[1:12:32] glowing oh
[1:12:34] my listen those are two forms of light
[1:12:37] but then if we keep going in the stages
[1:12:39] of light the light gets brighter there's
[1:12:42] another light called
[1:12:46] fluorescent fluorescent it gives off a
[1:12:49] color of white see not only is it white
[1:12:53] but it's giving off the natural color of
[1:12:55] white it's not glowing but when you look
[1:12:57] at florescent see the thing about
[1:12:59] florescent fluorescent light you can add
[1:13:02] different colors in it
[1:13:05] amen oh my but the one I
[1:13:08] like is the one I think we're all
[1:13:11] familiar with
[1:13:13] LED
[1:13:16] oh most of our cars have what kind of
[1:13:20] light
[1:13:22] LED because LED is is 90% brighter than
[1:13:27] the other ones I named but it's still
[1:13:30] light what makes it brighter
[1:13:36] Hallelujah LED light
[1:13:39] Hallelujah it lights up 90% more
[1:13:43] efficient Hallelujah than the other
[1:13:45] lights because they said there's a
[1:13:47] certain energy moving through the above
[1:13:49] Hallelujah there's more energy moving
[1:13:51] through a LED Hall see it's not just
[1:13:53] coming to church it's not
[1:13:56] just Co but an experience there there's
[1:13:59] something that's taking place there's an
[1:14:01] energy there they can feel God in the
[1:14:04] room Hallelujah we need an LED
[1:14:11] experience that's right awesome praise
[1:14:15] God it's still light but it's giving off
[1:14:18] more
[1:14:21] energy W God some of us we come to
[1:14:25] church and we give off the same
[1:14:27] energy every time we come come on we
[1:14:32] hear we experience the anointing we sing
[1:14:35] good
[1:14:36] songs and we hear good
[1:14:39] preaching and this is all the energy we
[1:14:47] have
[1:14:51] mer your amens are not even a voice
[1:15:05] what kind of energy is that come on
[1:15:08] knock do you think God will respond to
[1:15:10] that Hall you get what you expect
[1:15:14] hallelujah
[1:15:15] hallelujah oh my look Church listen what
[1:15:19] the prophet of God says and I and I
[1:15:21] ain't going to be too much longer by the
[1:15:23] grace of God but I want to I want I want
[1:15:25] to show that Hallelujah that seed you
[1:15:28] and I our seeds in these two things
[1:15:30] every time we come to
[1:15:33] service every time we need to experience
[1:15:37] the water the rain amen the
[1:15:41] anointing and we also need to be present
[1:15:44] when the light is
[1:15:45] shining not your mind drifting off way
[1:15:48] no because this light this light what is
[1:15:50] it doing every time that light comes in
[1:15:53] contact with that seed it pulls it up a
[1:15:55] little bit
[1:15:56] higher just like the Su n when it comes
[1:16:00] in contact Hallelujah with the S D it
[1:16:03] what does it do it has the effect to
[1:16:05] pull it out of its
[1:16:07] conditions it pulls it out of the dirt
[1:16:11] pulls it out of the surroundings and
[1:16:13] nothing can stop it once it comes in
[1:16:15] contact why because there's something on
[1:16:18] the inside
[1:16:22] happening you can have a hurricane and
[1:16:24] hurricane come through and tear
[1:16:26] everything up but when that season of
[1:16:28] light comes back around that seed will
[1:16:30] continue to grow just like it
[1:16:36] did

[1:19:17] revelation of how you see God hallelujah
[1:19:20] hallelujah that's where the anointing
[1:19:22] lies Hallelujah cuz you look at it when
[1:19:25] David Hallelujah be to fight Goliath he
[1:19:28] wasn't fighting with his own strength he
[1:19:30] was fighting by Revelation and that
[1:19:32] anointing that was there to help him
[1:19:34] defeat a lion and a bear was there to
[1:19:37] meet him when he fought Goliath what no
[1:19:39] music
[1:19:40] playing what was that anointing that
[1:19:43] anointing was supreme power under
[1:19:46] control knowing how and what Hallelujah
[1:19:50] now is the time David say
[1:19:55] what we've done we've made it a a good
[1:19:58] song I pledge alance
[1:20:08] to and there's nothing wrong with
[1:20:11] worship and worship and songs
[1:20:14] Hallelujah but is God still there when
[1:20:17] there's no
[1:20:19] music can you still say am
[1:20:24] come on listen the prophet of God tells
[1:20:26] a story he's sitting in the living room
[1:20:30] and he's telling some of the Saints
[1:20:33] about the third pool he's talking about
[1:20:36] the Silver Tip Grizzly he's talking
[1:20:38] about Hallelujah the storm on the
[1:20:40] mountain he's talking about the little
[1:20:43] fish that rolls Hallelujah he's talking
[1:20:45] about the caribou and there was a woman
[1:20:48] sitting there
[1:20:50] listening who wasn't there at any of
[1:20:53] those events but she cut the anointing
[1:20:56] she cut the anointing for salvation Hall
[1:21:00] she caught the anointing for the
[1:21:01] supernatural by just doing what
[1:21:06] saying but just saying that ain't
[1:21:08] nothing but the truth you know what she
[1:21:10] was telling the prophet she was saying
[1:21:12] so be
[1:21:16] it and the devil don't want us to amen
[1:21:18] the word the devil don't want us to be
[1:21:20] free enough to say hallelujah he don't
[1:21:23] want us to be free enough to say thank
[1:21:24] you Jesus for the word that's your
[1:21:27] power thank you Lord
[1:21:31] God and don't give me that nonsense
[1:21:34] that's just the way I'm built
[1:21:41] oh yeah you need to be torn down and
[1:21:45] rebuilt Hallelujah but she sitting there
[1:21:49] and she is listening to all the stuff
[1:21:51] the prophet was saying and she wasn't
[1:21:54] there at none of those events but
[1:21:57] something was
[1:21:58] clicking the rain was coming
[1:22:03] down was no instruments being played
[1:22:07] hallelujah amen was no music was nothing
[1:22:10] just the light begin to

[1:22:19] the same anointing that was there on the
[1:22:22] mountain the same anointing that was
[1:22:24] there there with the bear in The Caribou
[1:22:26] the same anointing that was there with
[1:22:28] the little fish was the same anointing
[1:22:30] right there in that living room when she
[1:22:32] said say ain't nothing but the
[1:22:34] truth it was the same
[1:22:39] anointing

[1:22:43] another
[1:22:45] seedall church we can experience some of
[1:22:48] the same things that the prophet
[1:22:50] experienced if we would just amen the
[1:22:53] word god
[1:22:59] that's why I ain't got time to be
[1:23:00] fussing and arguing with people about
[1:23:02] what's right and what ain't
[1:23:04] right
[1:23:06] Hallelujah Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:23:09] led by what the spirit of

[1:24:15] free when we are to feel free In God's
[1:24:19] Presence yes sir Hallelujah
[1:24:24] but what the enemy tries to do he tries
[1:24:26] to make us feel

[1:24:46] same message and then I'mma back up a
[1:24:47] little
[1:24:48] bit I want to come down to this
[1:24:51] point this is in a message um
[1:24:54] a man can turn on light the prophet of
[1:24:57] God says all natural life comes by his
[1:25:00] spoken word and the Sun is his spoken
[1:25:04] word the Su n is his spoken word how he
[1:25:08] said let there be light amen and it
[1:25:12] appeared amen so light appearing is the
[1:25:16] manifestation of the spoken word being
[1:25:18] spoken right amen catch me now yes sir
[1:25:22] listen he said the son is his spoken
[1:25:24] word he
[1:25:26] said he said he created a great light in
[1:25:29] the heavens for the day and a lesser
[1:25:31] night a lesser light for the night seat
[1:25:34] and all natural life has to come by
[1:25:37] God's spoken word hallelujah see so as
[1:25:40] we're
[1:25:41] experiencing as we experiencing the the
[1:25:44] anointing and the rain Hallelujah let's
[1:25:46] not try to live a word for another

[1:31:48] brother dig say this this where I'm
[1:31:51] comfortable
[1:31:56] and that's why you miss God because
[1:31:58] youve become
[1:32:00] comfortable I don't never want the
[1:32:02] presence of God to get comfortable to me
[1:32:05] Hallelujah I want him to shake me up
[1:32:07] every time I come Hallelujah I want to
[1:32:09] expect the unexpected H I want God to
[1:32:12] sweep in and touch me like he didn't
[1:32:14] touch me last week I want God to come in
[1:32:17] and speak words to me that I've never
[1:32:19] heard before I don't want to be
[1:32:21] comfortable Hallelujah I want to be hurt
[1:32:24] I want to be on edge Hallelujah I want
[1:32:26] to be All Shook
[1:32:30] Up I want to be to a place almost I'm
[1:32:33] I'm just almost uh shaking because I
[1:32:37] don't know what he's going to do
[1:32:40] next come
[1:32:42] on that's where I want to
[1:32:45] be I want to be all traditional and all
[1:32:48] got everything together I'm a message
[1:32:50] believer you know who was like that the
[1:32:52] Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:32:54] they were so traditional with Moses's
[1:33:00] message that when Hallelujah The Light
[1:33:03] Came they were stuck in the same
[1:33:07] anointing come on The Light
[1:33:10] Came
[1:33:11] Hallelujah and they called it a
[1:33:15] devil because it didn't match up with
[1:33:17] their Traditions that's
[1:33:19] right I'm all right I know you know
[1:33:21] people call me all kind of stuff it's
[1:33:24] all good my mama still call me by
[1:33:28] name you can say what you want just
[1:33:30] spell my name
[1:33:32] right
[1:33:33] Hallelujah and now I'm getting to a
[1:33:35] place where I'm correcting people on how
[1:33:37] they pronounce it it's been too long for
[1:33:40] people to be still calling me
[1:33:43] kidy Hallelujah come on it's like Sky
[1:33:47] Kai
[1:33:50] Dre right K Dre all right okay praise
[1:33:55] the
[1:33:56] Lord but look what the prophet of God
[1:34:00] says this is what the prophet of God
[1:34:03] says he says now what God separates
[1:34:07] Darkness from
[1:34:08] light or light from darkness and he
[1:34:12] separates death from life and he does it
[1:34:15] by his word his word is what always
[1:34:19] brings this forth amen see so church is
[1:34:23] not just only the anointing that
[1:34:25] separates us it's the word that we're
[1:34:29] hearing it's the word that you're living
[1:34:32] that separates you from any denomination
[1:34:35] hallelujah it's the light that you're
[1:34:37] walking in it's the path that's been
[1:34:40] illuminated hallelujah it's all these
[1:34:43] things that coincide with the revealing
[1:34:45] of light that makes you who you
[1:34:48] are
[1:34:51] Hallelujah so when we come to church we
[1:34:54] ought not just to be here to be here but
[1:34:57] there should be an expectation and a
[1:35:01] participation Hallelujah I'm going ask
[1:35:03] the question again tonight are you
[1:35:07] growing because the rain causes the seed
[1:35:10] to unlock and the light pulls the seed
[1:35:13] out of its present
[1:35:15] condition Hallelujah so if we got the
[1:35:18] rain which is the anointing and we got
[1:35:20] the word which is the light we should be
[1:35:23] different
[1:35:25] we should be
[1:35:26] growing Hallelujah God we shouldn't be
[1:35:29] just coming around with the same old
[1:35:31] experiences the same old testimony no
[1:35:34] there should be growth in our
[1:35:36] journey Hallelujah yes sir he says now
[1:35:39] like well now need was always was was
[1:35:43] already upon the earth I believe God had
[1:35:45] PL plant the seed and just as long as
[1:35:49] the sun could get to that seed it begin
[1:35:52] to grow and I believe in this church God
[1:35:56] can get to the
[1:35:58] seed let's stop blocking the light and
[1:36:01] let's open up the way so the light can
[1:36:04] just Shine On Us yeah we experience the
[1:36:08] anointing the anointing is
[1:36:10] here but let's let the word have its way
[1:36:13] in our
[1:36:17] life
[1:36:20] Hallelujah
[1:36:21] listen he says and that that's the way
[1:36:24] God has today his seed is already here
[1:36:27] somebody say amen he said his word the
[1:36:30] only thing it needs is light amen and I
[1:36:35] believe in this church the truth of the
[1:36:38] light is being preached so what what am
[1:36:41] I saying that we should be
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] growing you you you you can call me
[1:36:49] crazy but I believe when we come to
[1:36:51] church Supernatural things should take
[1:36:53] place every time we
[1:36:56] come if the anointing is here if God is
[1:37:00] here there should be a testimony every
[1:37:03] service amen amen come
[1:37:07] on sometimes God will do things and
[1:37:09] you're not even aware of
[1:37:11] it
[1:37:13] Hallelujah he said the only thing it
[1:37:15] needs is light upon it and he is that
[1:37:18] light for he is the word the word and
[1:37:21] the light is the same thing right are
[1:37:24] you with me Church the light I'm talking
[1:37:27] about is the word which is the same
[1:37:31] thing the word and the light is the same
[1:37:34] thing the life is in there in the light
[1:37:37] of the word see is the life Hallelujah
[1:37:41] your life is where in the word that
[1:37:44] you're hearing for your
[1:37:46] day amen and as long as the anointing is
[1:37:49] present Hallelujah and the word comes
[1:37:52] forth we should be experiencing
[1:37:54] spiritual
[1:37:55] growth amen amen when your baby is born
[1:38:00] you don't expect that baby to stay an
[1:38:02] infant but you expect that baby to grow
[1:38:05] and as it's growing you're teaching it
[1:38:08] Hallelujah based upon what is going to
[1:38:11] [Applause]
[1:38:13] become you teach it how to walk why
[1:38:16] because you knew the potential was
[1:38:17] already there you teach it how to talk
[1:38:20] why because you knew the potential was
[1:38:22] already there praise Lord hallelujah God
[1:38:25] teaches us how to walk spiritually why
[1:38:27] because he knows the potential is
[1:38:29] already there God teaches us how to talk
[1:38:32] spiritual why because he knows the
[1:38:34] potential is already
[1:38:36] there amen hallelujah praise God some of
[1:38:40] us have been babies too
[1:38:45] long and if that one ain't good enough
[1:38:47] for you I got it in blood
[1:38:51] too amen
[1:38:55] Church let's get on the agile
[1:38:58] seats Hallelujah let's stop getting
[1:39:02] trapped in true tradition on let's stop
[1:39:04] getting trapped in walls of
[1:39:07] religion and let's get back to being
[1:39:09] free as God made
[1:39:11] us hallelujah where God can have his way
[1:39:14] with our lives but we would come and
[1:39:17] expect to be touched by God we will come
[1:39:20] and expect to hear from God we will come
[1:39:23] and expect Our Lives to be
