[54:13] back there in some denomination some of
[54:15] you here maybe would be back at a in a

[1:17:20] i want to remember our
[1:17:23] brothers in new brunswick in prayer and
[1:17:25] god bless them we've had fellowship with
[1:17:27] them i've had fellowship with them for
[1:17:28] many years and uh
[1:17:32] and i just had an email from our brother
[1:17:34] carmen mills there and he's uh i think
[1:17:37] he's brother carr's son-in-law but my he
[1:17:40] might be also by the car's assistant
[1:17:41] pastor there and he uh
[1:17:44] and he told me that brother carr is uh
[1:17:47] 92 years old
[1:17:50] and he's still preaching
[1:17:51] and he said he's he's he's active
[1:17:54] he said he's very on the goal
[1:17:56] i i i believe it
[1:17:59] knowing brother carr i believe it
[1:18:01] because even when i've been with him and
[1:18:03] he you know i
[1:18:04] i considered myself young and i
[1:18:06] considered him whole but brother he was
[1:18:08] as active or more active than me oh yes
[1:18:11] he was on he was on the go
[1:18:13] constantly and he's still on the go at
[1:18:15] 92 years old amen and i would say sister
[1:18:19] cara maybe maybe in her late 80s so god
[1:18:22] bless her she was active too
[1:18:24] so uh the the lord has really blessed
[1:18:27] them
[1:18:27] and so as i said brother our brother
[1:18:29] cara is still ministering
[1:18:31] in the church in new brunswick and i i
[1:18:34] believe uh his uh
[1:18:36] brother carmen i think that's his
[1:18:38] son-in-law and i think that that he
[1:18:40] ministers here too but i think brother
[1:18:42] car ministers twice during the week and
[1:18:44] brother carmen and ministers so god's
[1:18:47] god's grace to them amen oh brother
[1:18:50] but
[1:18:52] belakara
[1:18:53] he won't mind looking up
[1:18:56] he won't mind going up come on he's he's
[1:18:59] he's that active
[1:19:01] you know he's that active physically i
[1:19:03] trust he's dead active spiritually
[1:19:05] amen just move move move amen
[1:19:08] so again uh we we love the lord and
[1:19:10] brother carr did minister here some
[1:19:12] years ago you know so uh so i don't know
[1:19:15] if he'll ever be back here
[1:19:17] but if not we trust by grace we'll meet
[1:19:19] him in glory
[1:19:21] if he's that active here he'd be very
[1:19:22] active there
[1:19:24] amen well i believe that
[1:19:26] by the grace of god
[1:19:27] so
[1:19:29] god give us that faith to step out of
[1:19:31] time into eternity give us that faith
[1:19:33] that we're going from these old bodies
[1:19:35] to glorified bodies amen
[1:19:38] and that it will not be in any way
[1:19:41] be affected or influenced by by age no
[1:19:44] no we'll be back into eternity
[1:19:46] sons and daughters of god
[1:19:48] oh yeah and again
[1:19:51] oh brother sister in this world that
[1:19:54] we're living in where everything is
[1:19:55] getting
[1:19:56] getting more and more negative when it
[1:19:58] comes to the world what's going on in
[1:19:59] the world everything's getting negative
[1:20:02] brother brother because why
[1:20:05] satan has taken complete control
[1:20:08] over of the world and the things of the
[1:20:10] world but god has given us the word
[1:20:13] to get out
[1:20:15] amen to get back to eternity
[1:20:17] praise the lord
[1:20:18] so i pray grace brother sister we have
[1:20:20] that faith where we're looking and
[1:20:23] believing for eternity

[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:21] in deuteronomy chapter 32
[1:22:25] and beginning to read at verse 9
[1:22:30] for the lord's portion
[1:22:33] is his people
[1:22:36] jacob is the lot of his inheritance
[1:22:40] he found him in a desert land and in the
[1:22:43] waste owling wilderness
[1:22:45] he led him about
[1:22:47] he instructed him
[1:22:49] he kept him as the apple of his eye
[1:22:53] as an eagle stirth up her nest
[1:22:56] fluttereth over her young
[1:22:58] spread of the broad ur wings
[1:23:01] taketh them
[1:23:02] bear them on her wings
[1:23:04] so the lord alone
[1:23:06] did lead him
[1:23:07] and there was no strange god with him
[1:23:11] he made him right on the high places of
[1:23:14] the earth
[1:23:15] that he might eat the increase of the
[1:23:17] fields
[1:23:19] and he made him to suck honey out of the
[1:23:21] rock and oil out of the flinty rock
[1:23:27] butter of kind
[1:23:29] and milk of sheep
[1:23:30] with fat of lambs and rams of the breed
[1:23:34] of bastion
[1:23:35] and goats
[1:23:37] with the fat of kidneys of wheat
[1:23:40] and thou didst drink the pure blood
[1:23:43] of the grape
[1:23:46] but jeshurun waxed fat referring to
[1:23:49] israel
[1:23:52] and kicked
[1:23:54] thou are waxing fat
[1:23:56] thou had grown thick
[1:23:58] thou art covered with fatness and then
[1:24:01] he forsook god which made him
[1:24:05] and lightly esteemed the rock of his
[1:24:08] salvation
[1:24:09] amen
[1:24:10] they provoked him to jealousy
[1:24:13] with strange gods and brother as israel
[1:24:17] was guilty of this so there's the
[1:24:19] gentile world's becoming guilty of it
[1:24:21] amen god help us
[1:24:25] let me read it again again
[1:24:28] concerning
[1:24:30] jesus
[1:24:31] wax fat and kicked
[1:24:33] he said thou art waxing fat thou are
[1:24:36] grown thick
[1:24:37] and it says thou art covered with
[1:24:39] fatness and then he forsook god which
[1:24:42] made him
[1:24:43] and lightly esteemed the rock of his
[1:24:46] salvation
[1:24:48] god help us
[1:24:50] they provoked him to jealousy
[1:24:53] with strange gods
[1:24:55] don't lightly esteem the rock of our
[1:24:57] salvation
[1:24:59] our lord jesus christ
[1:25:03] and this is they provoked him to
[1:25:04] jealousy with strange gods
[1:25:07] yeah
[1:25:09] you're giving more preeminence to the
[1:25:10] natural things of life than to then to
[1:25:12] the lord
[1:25:13] god help us
[1:25:15] with abominations provoke the am to
[1:25:18] anger
[1:25:20] they sacrificed unto devils
[1:25:23] and not to god
[1:25:26] to god's room they knew not
[1:25:28] to new gods that came newly up
[1:25:31] whom your fathers feared not
[1:25:35] yeah
[1:25:36] the more and more and more inventions
[1:25:38] rising on the earth god help us
[1:25:42] of the rock that beget thee the art
[1:25:44] unmindful
[1:25:46] and has forgotten god that formed thee
[1:25:50] oh my how many have forgotten what god
[1:25:53] has done truly
[1:25:55] in revealing himself through the message
[1:25:57] of the hour
[1:25:59] god help us
[1:26:02] brother let's recognize that
[1:27:43] amen
[1:27:44] because there's anything that god's
[1:27:45] looking for brother whether it was in
[1:27:47] abel and cain it was faith
[1:27:51] but
[1:27:52] i trust by the grace of god that we have
[1:27:55] faith that pleases god
[1:27:57] you can have wisdom
[1:27:59] you can know the word but yet not
[1:28:01] believe it the way that god wants us to
[1:28:03] believe it amen not to act on it the way
[1:28:06] that god wants us to act because again
[1:28:09] we were reminded of this and warned of
[1:28:11] this concerning wisdom versus faith amen
[1:28:16] and not referring just to the wisdom of
[1:28:18] man when it comes to all that's going on
[1:28:20] intellectually in the world but you can
[1:28:22] have you can have a lot of wisdom in the
[1:28:24] word of god amen you can know this the
[1:28:27] bible says this the bible says that but
[1:28:29] do you have the faith that it's ordained
[1:28:31] to give us
[1:28:33] you can have the letter of the word but
[1:28:34] what about the spiritual revelation of
[1:28:36] the word amen it strikes us in our heads
[1:28:40] but does it strike us in our hearts amen
[1:28:43] because faith comes out of the heart not
[1:28:45] the head
[1:28:47] because it is it is by the letter of the
[1:28:49] word in the mind that many are deceived
[1:28:52] it's the truth
[1:28:54] and we have been warned concerning
[1:28:56] wisdom versus faith
[1:28:59] oh yes and the wisdom is the
[1:29:01] intellectual knowledge of the word and
[1:29:03] you can know this you can know that the
[1:29:05] bible says this the bible says that and
[1:29:07] yes and maybe sometimes we're doing this
[1:29:09] or doing that but the thing of it is
[1:29:11] brother the thing of it is is
[1:29:14] we we believe
[1:29:16] what god
[1:29:17] wants us to believe
[1:29:19] but
[1:29:20] do we believe it the way he wants us to
[1:29:22] believe it amen
[1:29:25] but there's one thing to say i believe
[1:29:26] it god said this god said that but
[1:29:28] brother do you believe in the way that
[1:29:30] he wants you to believe it and the way
[1:29:32] that you need to believe it amen because
[1:29:34] if you believe in it just intellectually
[1:29:36] and ages becomes a doctrine it's just
[1:29:38] comes theology but brother you got to
[1:29:40] believe it in a spiritual way so that it
[1:29:42] so that it it's a part of your life it
[1:29:45] controls your life it controls your
[1:29:47] thoughts amen it controls your motives
[1:29:49] controls your objectives amen and the

[1:30:16] word that this this is the will of god
[1:30:18] god wants you to do this god wants you
[1:30:20] to do that amen so brother sisters sons
[1:30:23] and daughters of god are led by the
[1:30:24] spirit of god led by the holy ghost amen
[1:30:28] and i tell you this
[1:30:29] it's causing us to line up amen with the
[1:30:32] word it's causing us to give preeminence
[1:30:34] to jesus it's composite because it will
[1:30:36] say man they let go and let god have his
[1:30:38] way not my will father thy be done amen
[1:30:43] but yet we're living in a generation
[1:30:44] where we're brothers and sisters and yes
[1:30:47] it's a generation that's caught up with
[1:30:49] with with their intellect as a
[1:30:51] generation caught up with with their
[1:30:52] education their gender cut out with this
[1:30:55] they're cutting with the inventions amen
[1:30:57] oh yes inventions that's why god said
[1:31:00] when he come he was going to destroy
[1:31:02] their inventions
[1:31:04] yeah because
[1:31:06] well israel got in trouble why because
[1:31:08] after a god delivered israel they went
[1:31:10] out and and they went this way and went
[1:31:12] that way yeah even that was kane's line
[1:31:15] right where you go right back to genesis
[1:31:17] and you'll find brother that abel who
[1:31:18] was staying with the word of god and he
[1:31:21] laid down his life amen for the sake of
[1:31:23] the word he wouldn't change
[1:31:26] but cain and the lord of cain they went
[1:31:28] out and they've invented this they
[1:31:30] invented that invented oh yes amen
[1:31:33] we'll we don't have time to get it right
[1:31:35] now we can go back to genesis right
[1:31:36] there and and see oh yeah this is what
[1:31:40] happened to abel but god raised up seth
[1:31:42] and that seth went this way but cain's
[1:31:45] line went the other way oh yeah and they
[1:31:47] got caught up with inventions they got
[1:31:49] caught up with the natural life
[1:31:53] amen whereas seth and his generation got
[1:31:56] caught up with the spiritual revelation
[1:31:58] of god amen god blessed them but brother
[1:32:02] god cursed cain
[1:32:03] and his seed
[1:32:05] so and then brother we're living in a
[1:32:06] generation now that has cut up more and
[1:32:08] more and more with the things of the
[1:32:10] world with the inventions of the world
[1:32:12] oh they're they they're they we can do
[1:32:15] this we can do this we're going to do
[1:32:16] that oh my never a generation that that
[1:32:19] saw what we are seeing
[1:32:21] never a generation experienced what you
[1:32:23] and i are experiencing when it comes to
[1:32:25] the inventions of man and they want to
[1:32:28] do this to please the flesh the flesh
[1:32:30] wants to do that the flesh wants to do
[1:32:31] that oh we like this and we like that
[1:32:33] this is good this is good but is it the
[1:32:35] will of god
[1:32:36] amen
[1:32:38] but again what we we could say maybe
[1:32:40] maybe what cain offered us as a
[1:32:43] sacrifice on his altar there amen oh
[1:32:45] that was good that's good okay that's
[1:32:47] good my you're a very generous king
[1:32:51] and yet like you said abel just offered
[1:32:53] just a lamb
[1:32:54] a dead a dead one
[1:32:56] what
[1:32:57] a dead lamb
[1:32:59] abel
[1:33:00] you're not giving nothing to god
[1:33:03] you give you give the lamb to god kill
[1:33:05] them
[1:33:06] yeah
[1:33:08] and well we thought maybe if he did that
[1:33:11] to us well we wouldn't be able to do
[1:33:12] anything with that lamb you know we'd
[1:33:14] have to go and bury it yeah
[1:33:16] we wouldn't be able to go in and maybe
[1:33:18] get get some more and replenish you and
[1:33:20] get more and more and more lambs no
[1:33:22] no see mccain never had the revelation
[1:33:25] abel had a revelation
[1:33:27] amen and brother i tell you this that as
[1:33:30] that revelation costs abel is life
[1:33:32] brother i tell you sometimes the
[1:33:33] revelation that god gives us amen
[1:33:36] because it causes many to lose their
[1:33:38] lives or and it does cost us our lives
[1:33:41] when it comes to the natural out here oh
[1:33:44] yeah we got to let go and let god have
[1:33:45] his way we're not going to live for the
[1:33:46] world like like maybe the family is
[1:33:48] living this way families living that way
[1:33:50] but brother tell you this it brings us a
[1:33:52] separation
[1:33:55] oh yeah because they do this but we
[1:33:57] don't do that we're not into that we
[1:33:58] don't have that spirit we don't have
[1:34:00] that anointing but for the for the
[1:34:02] generation we're living in especially
[1:34:04] now brother
[1:34:05] family friends neighbors who are there
[1:34:07] more and more they're caught up with
[1:34:08] what's going on in the world
[1:34:10] more and more they'll cut out with we
[1:34:11] want to do this we want to do that oh
[1:34:13] yeah this is good oh my wonderful
[1:34:16] concerning this invention that invention
[1:34:18] or or they're having this program and
[1:34:19] that program oh yeah
[1:34:21] and oh yeah more and more the devil is
[1:34:24] bringing things in to try to get more
[1:34:26] and more yes even so-called christians
[1:34:27] get caught up with it
[1:34:29] amen one time the christian all down
[1:34:32] through the ages brother they lived that
[1:34:34] totally separated life unto the lord
[1:34:37] amen
[1:34:39] but now
[1:34:40] they they they might go to church on a
[1:34:42] sunday on a wednesday but that's it the
[1:34:44] rest of the world they're going to live
[1:34:45] like the world
[1:34:47] oh yeah they're going to you know
[1:34:49] do what the world does and basically
[1:34:52] you know feed on the things the world is
[1:34:54] feeding on they want this they want that
[1:34:56] but no i'll tell you this the christian
[1:34:57] is if you've got the anointing of god in
[1:34:59] your heart your soul you're going to
[1:35:00] live a separated life unto the lord
[1:35:03] amen you have no desire for fellowship
[1:35:06] just out there or with this one with
[1:35:08] this one without no your hunger and
[1:35:10] thirst is for fellowship with the saints
[1:35:12] of god
[1:35:13] amen with brothers and sisters in the
[1:35:15] faith
[1:35:18] it's very rare that that we're going to
[1:35:19] get cut out with just family natural
[1:35:21] family or friends
[1:35:23] not like they did no no
[1:35:25] oh well there's nothing wrong with that
[1:35:27] it's oh yes
[1:35:29] but oh yeah why because they can
[1:35:31] influence you
[1:35:33] their spirit can get on you
[1:35:35] probably god said he said now he said he
[1:35:37] said their spirit can get on you he said
[1:35:39] but your spirit won't get on them
[1:35:42] if you're born again
[1:35:44] if you have the spirit of god or spirit
[1:35:45] of christ no no that's why that's why
[1:35:47] the the word of god brings separation
[1:35:51] amen because why because god knows the
[1:35:54] influence of that spirit of the world
[1:35:56] that's on them
[1:35:58] brother and all you can do is be a
[1:36:00] witness and and and

[1:37:55] totally different
[1:37:57] amen and i've had witnesses over the
[1:37:59] years where people you know
[1:38:02] no knew that they knew you were a
[1:38:04] christian even even family members
[1:38:06] although they did didn't didn't hold it
[1:38:08] against me and i thank the lord for that
[1:38:09] or at least most of them didn't and uh
[1:38:13] when it comes to our stand for the word
[1:38:14] and our standard is they knew that we
[1:38:16] were different but they knew too that we
[1:38:19] it was because that our confession is
[1:38:21] christians
[1:38:22] our experience as christians oh yeah and
[1:38:26] even though even though some of my
[1:38:27] family members they were so-called
[1:38:29] christians of certain churches but again
[1:38:31] they didn't hold it against us
[1:38:32] just well lord bless you
[1:38:34] just move on
[1:38:36] amen thank you
[1:38:37] amen they still kept the right attitude
[1:38:39] and the right to spirit
[1:38:41] you got to keep the right attitude
[1:38:43] you keep a right spirit
[1:38:45] and they will
[1:38:46] oh most definitely
[1:38:48] amen but i've seen over the years i've
[1:38:50] seen where believers that have had a
[1:38:51] wrong attitude and a wrong spirit toward
[1:38:54] those up there as i've said i've seen
[1:38:56] them when i first come to this message
[1:38:58] and oh yeah there's the believers a lot
[1:38:59] of the believers i met oh they they were
[1:39:01] they were condemning this one condemn me
[1:39:03] that brother we're not going to condemn
[1:39:04] the them
[1:39:06] we will condemn the church we'll condemn
[1:39:07] the denomination but better not condemn
[1:39:10] them
[1:39:11] no no
[1:39:12] no no because
[1:39:13] some of them are jesus said some of them
[1:39:15] are my children
[1:39:18] amen praise the lord brother they they
[1:39:22] they felt you don't do this do this
[1:39:24] jesus said no wait some of them are my
[1:39:26] children
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:28] and jesus would fellowship with with
[1:39:30] certain sometimes with ones that that
[1:39:33] that the disciples would never have
[1:39:34] nothing to do with
[1:39:36] they wouldn't have anything with them
[1:39:38] but jesus did why because he said some
[1:39:40] of them are my children
[1:39:42] amen so he kept his attitude he kept his
[1:39:45] spirit right
[1:39:46] he stayed with the truth
[1:39:48] amen and brother we'll stay with the
[1:39:50] truth but yet again no matter who we're
[1:39:52] dealing with we'll still you stay with
[1:39:54] the truth we'll still maintain our
[1:39:56] testimony
[1:39:57] amen but we'll keep a right spirit and a
[1:39:59] right attitude
[1:40:01] amen
[1:40:03] exactly
[1:40:04] brother thank god that jesus had the
[1:40:06] right spirit toward you and me and a
[1:40:08] right attitude for to say to save us
[1:40:11] amen so grace oh god ellis
[1:40:14] amen so that's what i've been preaching
[1:40:16] all down through the years is to
[1:40:18] encourage the believers to have a right
[1:40:19] spirit and a right attitude amen to
[1:40:23] those out there in in denominations oh
[1:40:25] yeah we just pray the grace of god to
[1:40:27] help them and deliver them amen
[1:40:30] amen because he did to us well we don't
[1:40:32] know
[1:40:33] again
[1:40:34] i got to highlight this because it's
[1:40:36] needed more and more and more where
[1:40:39] where the angel of god came down and and
[1:40:41] rebuked brother branham
[1:40:43] for what criticizing that sister
[1:40:48] this or the sisters and criticizing them
[1:40:50] because of the way that they were
[1:40:51] walking and dressing and had their hair
[1:40:53] cut and so on and and the angels said
[1:40:55] don't you do that he said some of them
[1:40:57] are my children
[1:40:59] yeah
[1:41:00] and i said over the years i've seen
[1:41:02] believers condemn
[1:41:05] denominational people oh yeah they were
[1:41:07] so they were rising up as they were
[1:41:10] judging them and condemning them and
[1:41:12] sending them to hell and so on oh yeah
[1:41:16] no that's the truth
[1:41:19] i didn't i didn't feel that was a right
[1:41:20] spirit or right attitude amen
[1:41:23] to have had
[1:41:24] no
[1:41:25] amen
[1:41:26] brother why because jesus said some of
[1:41:28] them are my children as i said they may
[1:41:31] not be bright but brother maybe they'll
[1:41:33] be outside the city
[1:41:35] keep your attitude right keep your
[1:41:36] spirit right
[1:41:37] because the blood of god did warn us he
[1:41:39] says you're gonna be surprised who made
[1:41:41] it
[1:41:42] and who didn't make it
[1:41:44] amen what do you mean surprise means no
[1:41:48] that person there you thought they would
[1:41:49] never make it they and when you get
[1:41:51] there they'll be there
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:54] and there's there's gonna be others that
[1:41:56] you thought oh yeah they'll make it
[1:41:57] they're gonna make it man you get there
[1:42:00] they weren't there
[1:42:02] they wouldn't be there
[1:42:05] god why
[1:42:06] oh they were righteous no they were
[1:42:07] self-righteous
[1:42:09] their spirit wasn't right gratitude
[1:42:11] wasn't right amen keep your spirit right
[1:42:14] and your attitude right
[1:42:17] amen
[1:42:18] love
[1:42:20] amen amen amen if there's anything
[1:42:22] you've got to have
[1:42:23] you've got to have love
[1:42:25] praise the name of the lord
[1:42:28] by the grace of god because why why did
[1:42:30] god feel the way that he did to those
[1:42:32] people he was he was telling the the
[1:42:34] jews he said keep your attitude right
[1:42:36] keep your spirit right amen
[1:42:39] because he said some of them are his
[1:42:41] children and he loved them and he was
[1:42:42] care he was he cared for them
[1:42:44] and he was concerned for them
[1:42:47] god help us
[1:42:49] is there anything brother we got to
[1:42:50] fight anything we gotta amen overcome is
[1:42:54] self-righteousness
[1:42:57] there's too many self-righteous
[1:42:59] oh they think they're good they think
[1:43:01] they're this the things are that we're
[1:43:02] all sinners
[1:43:05] saved by grace
[1:43:07] amen

[1:48:15] denominational christians or
[1:48:16] non-christians they'll recognize it
[1:48:19] they'll recognize oh you're
[1:48:21] you're a christian
[1:48:23] how do you what do you mean oh we know
[1:48:26] you your spirit is so different
[1:48:30] and they knew that we weren't
[1:48:31] self-righteous
[1:48:33] they know that i'll tell you there's
[1:48:34] there's those out there that that know
[1:48:37] they they refuse your testimony why
[1:48:39] because they feel you're self-righteous
[1:48:41] because that's maybe the way that we
[1:48:43] might act don't do that
[1:48:45] then we might talk self-righteously
[1:48:49] no no
[1:48:50] you've got to humble yourself to the
[1:48:51] grace of god
[1:48:53] amen and if there's anything that that
[1:48:55] god wants you to reflect to them is
[1:48:57] humility
[1:48:58] holy ghost humility
[1:49:01] amen if you're born again i'll tell you
[1:49:03] this is any is any nature any any
[1:49:06] attribute that you're going to manifest
[1:49:07] is humility
[1:49:10] jesus humbled himself
[1:49:13] god humble himself and brother when
[1:49:15] christ come back into your life he
[1:49:17] humble you
[1:49:19] yeah
[1:49:20] god help us
[1:49:22] by the grace of god
[1:49:24] weather let's have the wisdom of the
[1:49:25] revealed word but let's pray the grace
[1:49:28] of god that we have the faith that it's
[1:49:30] ordained to give us
[1:49:32] as the prophet preached again in 1962
[1:49:35] in
[1:49:36] it was during the easter easter i think
[1:49:38] 1962 wisdom versus faith because why
[1:49:43] because more and more people were
[1:49:45] boasting about the wisdom of god but
[1:49:47] they never had the faith of god
[1:49:50] oh yeah they oh they believed this they
[1:49:52] believed that but brother they didn't
[1:49:54] live the life
[1:49:56] they had the wisdom but not the faith
[1:50:00] brother grace of god that we what we
[1:50:03] have the wisdom of god we have the faith
[1:50:05] of god
[1:50:08] the first recorded message
[1:50:10] of the prophet
[1:50:12] the first recorded message
[1:50:15] is
[1:50:16] faith
[1:50:17] is the substance
[1:50:21] faith is the substance that god wants
[1:50:23] faith is the substance that god
[1:50:26] is recognizing in us
[1:50:29] it's not the intellectual letter of the
[1:50:31] word oh they know this they know that oh
[1:50:34] that you know they know whether there's
[1:50:35] one god they know about water baptism
[1:50:38] they know about this this just
[1:50:39] revelation that not revelation but this
[1:50:42] doctrine that doctrine amen no no what
[1:50:44] god's looking for that pleases god in
[1:50:46] you is faith
[1:50:48] it's a revelation in your heart
[1:50:50] not understanding in your head
[1:50:53] so are you living are you living the
[1:50:54] life you live are you living it out of
[1:50:56] your heart
[1:50:58] are you living it out of your head
[1:51:01] amen is it just physical
[1:51:04] or is it spiritual in your heart
[1:51:07] as the prophet of god has warned us he
[1:51:09] said you can have the holy ghost he said
[1:51:11] with you and over you around you 24
[1:51:14] hours a day
[1:51:16] and he said and go to hell
[1:51:19] why because he's not in your heart to
[1:51:21] control your nature
[1:51:24] he's not in your heart to keep you
[1:51:26] humble
[1:51:27] and sincere
[1:51:30] and over the years i've met many a
[1:51:32] so-called believer many a so-called
[1:51:34] christian oh they had a lot in their
[1:51:36] heads but i tell you this they never had
[1:51:38] it in their heart
[1:51:40] no
[1:51:41] anything they lacked was humility
[1:51:45] brother
[1:51:46] if there's any attribute of a true
[1:51:48] believer it's humility
[1:51:50] humble yourself and the lord will draw
[1:51:52] near you
[1:51:54] amen
[1:51:56] if there's anything the bible teaches is
[1:51:57] humility
[1:51:59] the attitude and the attributes that god
[1:52:01] is looking for in us is humility
[1:52:04] humble yourself
[1:52:08] and again that's why
[1:52:11] many
[1:52:13] miss the revelation of jesus is because
[1:52:15] of humility
[1:52:17] he could have exalted himself
[1:52:19] just consider he was god in flesh and
[1:52:22] consider what he what he did
[1:52:25] yeah consider what he could have done
[1:52:29] but he didn't do it
[1:52:31] he did do this he did do that oh yeah
[1:52:34] and it was revealing revealing god in
[1:52:36] flesh
[1:52:37] revealing that yeah the ministry of the
[1:52:38] word in in in flesh amen our lord our
[1:52:42] savior or brother
[1:52:44] oh what he could have done
[1:52:46] he didn't do
[1:52:49] no no
[1:52:50] well he could do this yes he could
[1:52:52] are you sure yes
[1:52:54] if he if he couldn't
[1:52:56] then when he laid down his life he
[1:52:58] wouldn't be able to pick it up
[1:53:01] but if he laid down his life and picked
[1:53:02] it up again
[1:53:03] amen
[1:53:04] and went up into a rapture
[1:53:07] brother sister what could he have done
[1:53:09] when he was here
[1:53:10] just just with the disciples
[1:53:12] fellowshipping with the disciples in the
[1:53:14] flesh before they crucified him he had
[1:53:16] the power to do this he had the power to
[1:53:17] do that oh my brother
[1:53:20] the power that he could have manifested
[1:53:24] yeah he did any remember he spoke he had
[1:53:28] the spoken word
[1:53:29] he did
[1:53:30] oh yeah
[1:53:31] because of the the ones that he went out
[1:53:33] and he fed he fed so many thousand with
[1:53:36] just a few loaves of bread and a couple
[1:53:38] of fish
[1:53:40] huh how did he do that
[1:53:43] how did he do that
[1:53:47] spoken word
[1:53:49] he was god
[1:53:51] he multiplied it
[1:53:53] and when when he told the disciples gold
[1:53:56] and he said and feed them with this feed
[1:53:57] them when they said oh there's so many
[1:54:00] thousand out there he said well what do
[1:54:01] you got and he said oh we got just maybe
[1:54:03] five loaves or two fish something and i
[1:54:05] said go feed him i'll tell you something
[1:54:09] happened when they went to go feed them
[1:54:11] god must have been multiplying the fish
[1:54:14] brother whatever whatever they were in
[1:54:16] it when they go back there's more there
[1:54:17] there's more there there's more amen
[1:54:19] where'd they come from
[1:54:21] god help us
[1:54:24] do you believe it
[1:54:25] do you believe that he did it
[1:54:27] he spoke it into existence brother if we
[1:54:29] don't believe those things we don't
[1:54:31] believe in the resurrection and the
[1:54:32] rapture
[1:54:34] god
[1:54:37] brother yes faith believes god
[1:54:40] faith trusts god but faith obeys god
[1:54:43] amen faith is doing what god wants us to
[1:54:46] do
[1:54:47] and how god wants us to do it
[1:54:50] amen
[1:54:52] there's too many that do have the wisdom
[1:54:54] or they profess to believe this profess
[1:54:56] to believe that we think they think they
[1:54:58] know a lot but yet brother
[1:55:00] what they do how they do it proves what
[1:55:02] they really know
[1:55:06] as i said
[1:55:07] you can have the faith or you have
[1:55:09] wisdom to oh
[1:55:11] repent and be baptized but yet refused
[1:55:15] to be baptized in his name
[1:55:18] oh yeah
[1:55:22] they feel uh well i'll go and get
[1:55:23] baptized in the name of father son holy
[1:55:25] ghost yeah but what is the name
[1:55:28] you've got to identify with the name
[1:55:31] because in the name is salvation
[1:55:33] in the name is redemption in the name is
[1:55:35] healing and whatever whatever you ask in
[1:55:38] the name he said i'll do it call it
[1:55:39] you'll get it and so on praise the lord
[1:55:42] so god help us brother
[1:55:44] sister thank god for wisdom
[1:55:47] but brotherless thank god for the faith
[1:55:51] that he gives us
[1:55:52] amen
[1:55:53] so that it becomes not just a dead
[1:55:55] letter
[1:55:56] yes it becomes the living word
[1:55:58] made flesh in us
[1:56:01] that's the difference
[1:56:02] so is it do you have the dead letter of
[1:56:04] the message are you reflecting the dead
[1:56:06] letter of the message or you're
[1:56:08] reflecting the living word
[1:56:10] of the of the message
[1:56:14] brother it's the life you live it's your
[1:56:16] attitude your spirit proves it
[1:56:21] jesus look at the life that jesus lived
[1:56:24] look at the attitude jesus had the
[1:56:26] spirit that he had amen
[1:56:29] it was the word
[1:56:31] made flesh
[1:56:34] so brother
[1:56:37] we need the substance faith
[1:56:39] hallelujah
[1:56:41] not just saying i believe this and i
[1:56:42] believe that a doctrine or theology
[1:56:46] but it's a substance that's controlling
[1:56:48] our lives by the grace of god
[1:56:52] and just think again
[1:56:53] the first message he preached in
[1:56:56] in this hour the prophet
[1:56:58] was faith is the substance and was in
[1:57:00] 1947
[1:57:03] and the last message on faith
[1:57:08] was
[1:57:09] works is faith expressed
[1:57:13] and that was
[1:57:14] november
[1:57:16] 1965.
[1:57:19] amen
[1:57:20] it was less than a month before the lord
[1:57:22] took the prophet home
[1:57:25] so brother if there's anything
[1:57:27] that god wants requires of us now after
[1:57:30] all that he's done after all he's
[1:57:31] revealed it is the faith that pleases
[1:57:34] him
[1:57:36] it is the faith that's ordained to give
[1:57:38] us the resurrection and the rapturing
[1:57:40] faith
[1:57:41] oh yeah
[1:57:43] as i said
[1:57:47] that
[1:57:48] what god revealed through luther gave
[1:57:50] them the faith for justification
[1:57:54] and the others the faith for
[1:57:55] sanctification
[1:57:57] and
[1:57:57] because
[1:57:58] after the church agents went into and
[1:58:00] into darkness and they began to preach
[1:58:02] just works works works you got to do
[1:58:04] this oh yeah the catholic church was
[1:58:07] preaching did you had to do this you had
[1:58:08] to do this and even martin luther were
[1:58:10] going to the catholic church into the
[1:58:12] porch and he'd do this and he do this he
[1:58:14] do that amen but yet there's something
[1:58:17] bothering him amen and finally he did go
[1:58:21] in
[1:58:22] into the fortune in in the church and he
[1:58:25] opened the bible
[1:58:26] and oh when he opened the bible
[1:58:30] it says the just shall live by faith
[1:58:34] amen and that jesus had justified us
[1:58:38] it struck him he he was taught according
[1:58:40] to the church he was taught that he was
[1:58:42] justified by his works
[1:58:44] oh
[1:58:45] but he when he read the read the
[1:58:46] scripture he opened up and there it was
[1:58:50] jesus did it
[1:58:52] now of course wesley got the revelation
[1:58:54] jesus sanctified us
[1:58:56] it's not our works
[1:58:57] it's our faith
[1:58:59] see it's all faith
[1:59:01] faith is what is what god's looking for
[1:59:03] faith is what god wants brother sister
[1:59:05] so brother and sister again
[1:59:07] what with the word that came in luther's
[1:59:09] day gave them faith
[1:59:12] justified by faith and wesley's day gave
[1:59:14] them faith and again in the pentecostal
[1:59:16] age they gave them the faith and the
[1:59:18] restoration of the gifts oh they're
[1:59:20] getting more spiritual
[1:59:21] and brother again you
[1:59:23] they were they're just moving on moving
[1:59:25] on moving on but then when they got into
[1:59:27] the pentecostal age there i tell you
[1:59:29] with what god was doing under the
[1:59:30] pentecostal revival
[1:59:32] and oh my it was tremendous they and
[1:59:35] there were some pentecostals felt that
[1:59:37] maybe all this is going to go on to the
[1:59:39] coming of the lord
[1:59:41] why because they knew that god had
[1:59:43] justified us sanctified us and now they
[1:59:46] were experiencing the baptism of the
[1:59:47] holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit
[1:59:50] now my praise the lord the only one
[1:59:52] thing left notice they felt was let's go
[1:59:54] into resurrection let's go into rapture
[1:59:56] amen but god
[1:59:58] was was going to bring in the elijah
[2:00:00] ministry
[2:00:01] with the revelation of the word to give
[2:00:03] us resurrection and rapturing faith
[2:00:07] amen
[2:00:08] as i said we thank god for this faith in
[2:00:11] previous ages
[2:00:12] amen right on through through down to
[2:00:15] pentecostals but what about now the
[2:00:17] bride age
[2:00:21] how many want to go home
[2:00:23] i i don't know i don't mean here in st
[2:00:24] john's or paradise
[2:00:27] no no
[2:00:29] no no how many want to go to glory
[2:00:32] to be with jesus
[2:00:33] and how many we won't want to oh how
[2:00:35] many want to
[2:00:37] to be with the saints that are going on
[2:00:42] you gotta want it
[2:00:44] jesus
[2:00:45] jesus came from there and he wanted to
[2:00:47] go back there
[2:00:49] yeah
[2:00:50] why he was getting tired of the world he
[2:00:52] was living
[2:00:54] he was getting tired of oh
[2:00:56] all around was everyone that was born in
[2:00:58] sin
[2:01:00] but he wasn't born in sin
[2:01:03] no
[2:01:05] he wasn't he was born in flesh
[2:01:07] but brother that flesh didn't come by
[2:01:09] sin
[2:01:10] not by any means and that's why my
[2:01:13] brother and sister amen
[2:01:15] and if we're born again
[2:01:18] and we got a new nature
[2:01:19] we got that same feeling jesus had let's
[2:01:21] get out of here
[2:01:23] lord we want to go now
[2:01:25] take us home lord
[2:01:27] why oh well brother we want
[2:01:30] we want to stay here until this one is
[2:01:32] saved i want to say well you well i tell
[2:01:34] you
[2:01:35] god knows
[2:01:37] who god has got it you leave that with
[2:01:39] the lord if you got that anointing in
[2:01:41] your life due to gold to get out of here
[2:01:43] god put it there
[2:01:45] and if he if he put it there then you
[2:01:47] then you then when it comes to family
[2:01:48] and friends and neighbors you just leave
[2:01:50] them with the lord say lord thank you i

[2:01:54] you'll save them every predestinated
[2:01:56] seed is going to be there
[2:02:00] god god help us
[2:02:06] again
[2:02:07] the first recorded message is faith is
[2:02:09] the substance the last recorded message
[2:02:13] is works is faith expressed
[2:02:16] amen so is the life we live in
[2:02:19] expressing our faith
[2:02:23] faith
[2:02:24] that you believe
[2:02:26] in the end time
[2:02:28] faith that you believe in the rapture
[2:02:32] faith that you believe in the
[2:02:33] resurrection
[2:02:41] again like i quoted some years ago with
[2:02:44] a picture
[2:02:47] that some brother had painted
[2:02:49] and it was in a
[2:02:51] religious book
[2:02:54] that i was going through and there's
[2:02:56] somebody had pictures there in it
[2:02:58] that wasn't based on message but just
[2:03:00] based basically on the word of god
[2:03:04] and uh
[2:03:06] right on down through the revelation of
[2:03:08] the resurrection and the rapture and so
[2:03:10] on
[2:03:12] and uh
[2:03:13] he painted a picture of the resurrection
[2:03:16] oh yeah
[2:03:18] and in the in the picture oh yeah the
[2:03:21] like
[2:03:22] in a graveyard a cemetery
[2:03:24] oh yeah and you and it had the painting
[2:03:26] there of
[2:03:28] of the
[2:03:29] grandmother and grandfather coming out
[2:03:31] of their graves and going out
[2:03:33] to meet jesus
[2:03:35] but
[2:03:37] they were old
[2:03:39] and then
[2:03:40] they had pictures of others you know
[2:03:42] just their whatever age they were when
[2:03:44] they would have died or they came up and
[2:03:46] they were going out to meet jesus then
[2:03:48] they had pictures there oh a baby's
[2:03:50] coming out of their
[2:03:52] grave and they were going out to meet
[2:03:54] jesus babies they're still babies
[2:03:58] but the bible says there's no known old
[2:04:00] man that hasn't fulfilled his days nor
[2:04:02] an infant
[2:04:03] amen nor an infant of days and so on
[2:04:06] no
[2:04:07] because we're all going to be around you
[2:04:09] know well maybe 19 20 years old
[2:04:12] 21 years old that's what you're gonna be
[2:04:14] like
[2:04:15] you're gonna be like that that's that
[2:04:16] that's what you as the appearance you're
[2:04:18] gonna have
[2:04:19] amen
[2:04:20] but uh
[2:04:21] my
[2:04:22] grandfather that died in his 90s he
[2:04:24] certainly won't look like that when we
[2:04:26] see him by the grace of god you know
[2:04:29] he's going to he's going to be just
[2:04:30] maybe 21 years old that's what he's
[2:04:32] going to father god said oh yeah
[2:04:36] they all will be young there forever
[2:04:39] transformed in a moment of time
[2:04:41] immortal will stand in his likeness the
[2:04:43] son of the stars to shine amen by the
[2:04:46] grace of god
[2:04:48] oh yes that's that's common sense
[2:04:50] because old age is a result of sin
[2:04:54] you know so but we're going into it into
[2:04:56] into a dimension into a land where there
[2:04:58] will be no sin oh i've talked to the
[2:05:00] lord and
[2:05:01] quite a bit recently just thinking about
[2:05:03] heaven thinking about the new avenue
[2:05:05] earth i said oh lord this is going to be
[2:05:07] wonderful i said when we get to the new
[2:05:09] heaven he said i said a new earth and i
[2:05:10] said there won't be no sin
[2:05:12] i said this there'd be none of this
[2:05:13] going on none of that going on i said in
[2:05:15] that new heaven new earth i say thank
[2:05:17] you jesus i said i'm longing to get
[2:05:19] there
[2:05:20] i said oh yeah i said we want to get out
[2:05:22] of this and get away from this whole
[2:05:24] world we're living in i wonder how many
[2:05:27] really want to go
[2:05:28] how many want to get into a world like
[2:05:30] that
[2:05:33] i said
[2:05:36] there's unfortunately there's a lot
[2:05:38] going to be bored
[2:05:40] yeah
[2:05:42] oh yes if you go up there with still
[2:05:44] remembering down here you'll be bored in
[2:05:46] heaven oh yeah because this is not there
[2:05:49] that's not there oh my
[2:05:53] they'd be bored because there's no tv
[2:05:57] to be bored because there's no books
[2:06:00] and this you know or or no no uh
[2:06:04] computers
[2:06:05] no internets
[2:06:08] oh i'm bored they'll be
[2:06:10] but i'll tell you this if you've got the
[2:06:11] holy ghost
[2:06:12] you want to go back there
[2:06:14] you want to holy go you got the holy
[2:06:15] ghost you want to get out of time and
[2:06:17] into eternity amen because if you have
[2:06:20] the holy ghost
[2:06:22] you you can't you can't put up with no
[2:06:24] more of this whole world
[2:06:26] as jesus said how much longer shall i be
[2:06:28] with you lord you mean tell me you're
[2:06:31] bored
[2:06:32] yeah
[2:06:33] you're bored
[2:06:35] he was bored with it i can't take it
[2:06:38] can't take it any longer
[2:06:40] amen
[2:06:41] well even when peter
[2:06:44] oh he was delighted
[2:06:47] on one sense he was delighted when he
[2:06:49] was getting to the place where he had to
[2:06:50] go down to jerusalem
[2:06:52] but when he when he made him remark
[2:06:54] concerning what was going to happen in
[2:06:56] jerusalem
[2:06:57] oh peter didn't like that
[2:06:59] and peter was going to stop it
[2:07:01] and he said get behind me satan
[2:07:05] why
[2:07:06] jesus knew oh yeah he was going to
[2:07:08] suffer and he had to do this he had to
[2:07:09] endure this
[2:07:10] but he knew
[2:07:12] that he was going to get out of time and
[2:07:14] into eternity
[2:07:16] and he wanted to go do it knowing that
[2:07:18] he you want to do it too because you're
[2:07:20] going to redeem us
[2:07:21] he had to do that to redeem us
[2:07:24] amen there's one thing to get out of
[2:07:26] time into eternity but brother i tell
[2:07:28] you this
[2:07:29] another reason that he was pushing his
[2:07:31] way down to jerusalem was to redeem you
[2:07:33] and me
[2:07:36] he knew
[2:07:37] thank god
[2:07:41] so brother
[2:07:44] i pray grace is the substance that we
[2:07:46] live by
[2:07:48] and that grace and our works rather is
[2:07:50] our faith expressed
[2:07:55] wisdom
[2:07:56] is the revelation of what god requires
[2:07:58] us to do but faith is the revelation of
[2:08:01] how
[2:08:02] god wants us to do it
[2:08:06] amen and i believe that's why we're here
[2:08:10] we're not out into something
[2:08:12] denomination
[2:08:14] god has brought us out god has delivered
[2:08:16] us amen why
[2:08:18] because why we're going by the faith
[2:08:20] we're going by the revelation of
[2:08:22] how god wants us to do it
[2:08:25] how god wants us to serve him
[2:08:28] amen
[2:08:31] so are you are you into the revelation
[2:08:33] of how god is bringing the resurrection
[2:08:35] rapture
[2:08:40] god elvis
[2:08:44] brother
[2:08:47] cain
[2:08:51] and the revelation of what god required
[2:08:56] but
[2:08:57] abel had the faith
[2:08:59] well
[2:09:00] of how god required it
[2:09:03] both had the revelation of sacrifice
[2:09:06] yeah
[2:09:07] but
[2:09:08] abel had the revelation of what god
[2:09:10] wanted
[2:09:11] amen and how god wanted it
[2:09:14] but brother i tell you the cain
[2:09:17] he had a revelation of maybe what god
[2:09:18] required him to do in the sacrifice
[2:09:21] but or how god required it
[2:09:24] to have a sacrifice
[2:09:25] and so on but he never had the faith the
[2:09:27] revelation of what god required
[2:09:32] he didn't have the revelation of the
[2:09:34] shedding of blood
[2:09:35] a abel did but not came
[2:09:39] so brother
[2:09:40] we may have a revelation oh well yes i
[2:09:43] want to do this for the lord do this for
[2:09:44] the lord but is that what god wants you
[2:09:46] to do is that what god requires of you
[2:09:49] for the resurrection and rapture what
[2:09:51] does god require of us
[2:09:57] brother i believe we got to believe the
[2:09:59] revelation that god gives us amen
[2:10:02] oh yeah
[2:10:04] can cain had one revelation
[2:10:06] well yeah
[2:10:07] sacrifice
[2:10:10] can you sacrifice abel was making a
[2:10:12] sacrifice
[2:10:13] but look at as i preached years ago
[2:10:17] when we were in the church on empire
[2:10:19] avenue
[2:10:21] and i mentioned it i said well what
[2:10:23] church would you go to
[2:10:26] would you go to cain's church
[2:10:28] or would you go to abel's church
[2:10:32] i said if you went to abel's church i
[2:10:33] said oh my
[2:10:35] look abel
[2:10:37] you know he had an altar there and he
[2:10:39] had a lamb and all blood
[2:10:43] oh
[2:10:44] i said not many would want to go into
[2:10:46] that kind of a church
[2:10:48] i said well cain oh he had the altar and
[2:10:50] with all these beautiful
[2:10:52] maybe vegetables whatever he was grown
[2:10:54] and maybe maybe some flowers oh
[2:10:57] wonderful i said which church would you
[2:10:58] go to
[2:10:59] cain or abel
[2:11:01] and i noticed that there was a stranger
[2:11:03] in the church at the time that he had
[2:11:05] never been in this in one of our
[2:11:07] services before
[2:11:09] and i haven't seen him since
[2:11:11] but after the service
[2:11:14] he said pastor
[2:11:17] he said thank you
[2:11:18] he said i never heard that before
[2:11:22] he said buddy said you're right
[2:11:26] he said most would want to go to cain's
[2:11:28] church
[2:11:31] yeah because it was more nice
[2:11:34] beautiful but abel's church oh no
[2:11:38] we don't want to go where they're going
[2:11:39] to kill lambs
[2:11:41] and blood all over the altar
[2:11:43] oh my brother sister god help us
[2:11:46] please let's have faith
[2:11:50] not good not go to the church where
[2:11:51] everything is nice and you know
[2:11:53] everybody recognizes the church they
[2:11:54] love the church and all that now
[2:11:57] oh yeah
[2:11:58] you can love our worship and our singing
[2:12:00] and our praise yeah
[2:12:02] but
[2:12:03] when it comes to the preaching of the
[2:12:05] word not everybody loves the preaching
[2:12:07] of the word
[2:12:09] i don't know if you're going to you're
[2:12:10] going to really preach the truth like
[2:12:12] jesus did
[2:12:15] oh my
[2:12:16] if
[2:12:17] there's anything that turned
[2:12:18] the pharisees against jesus was what he
[2:12:20] preached
[2:12:22] oh they couldn't they couldn't take it
[2:12:24] no no because he just laid it in laid it
[2:12:26] in the word oh yeah god help us
[2:12:30] stay with the word
[2:12:34] see which church would you attend
[2:12:37] abel's church or keynes
[2:12:42] oh
[2:12:44] cain kane that's nice you got there
[2:12:47] oh my surely the lord is pleased with
[2:12:49] that
[2:12:50] oh it's beautiful all all that he had
[2:12:52] laid on the altar there and so on oh
[2:12:54] wonderful
[2:12:58] they would rather go to cain's church
[2:13:00] but not going to abel's church and see
[2:13:01] the altar
[2:13:05] abel
[2:13:06] a dead would you kill that lamb
[2:13:10] look at a mess of blood you got
[2:13:11] everywhere
[2:13:14] yeah
[2:13:15] so i said most would go to cain's church
[2:13:17] and that visitor did agree he said
[2:13:19] you're right
[2:13:20] but he never heard it before
[2:13:25] god help us
[2:13:29] let's believe what god wants us to
[2:13:31] believe but let's be do what god wants
[2:13:33] us to do and how
[2:13:34] how god wants us to do it
[2:13:37] and brother what about family what about
[2:13:39] abraham and his family
[2:13:41] when god called him out
[2:13:43] into a promised land
[2:13:46] let's do what god wants us to do
[2:13:49] and how god wants us to do it
[2:13:52] abraham brought his summer members of
[2:13:54] his family out
[2:13:56] and god wouldn't take him into the
[2:13:58] promised land
[2:14:00] he came out
[2:14:04] but he brought members of his family
[2:14:06] with him
[2:14:07] and god wouldn't deal with abraham no
[2:14:09] more and didn't deal with him until his
[2:14:11] father died
[2:14:15] and after his father died then god came
[2:14:17] and spoke to abraham and called him up
[2:14:19] again why now he had to separate him
[2:14:22] from
[2:14:23] it was it his
[2:14:24] brother or a cousin lot
[2:14:28] yeah
[2:14:30] he said abraham i wanted to do this but
[2:14:32] he didn't want lot there
[2:14:35] god help us
[2:14:40] we're going to do what god wants us to
[2:14:41] do
[2:14:42] but
[2:14:43] you got to do it how god wants you to do
[2:14:44] it
[2:14:46] how does god want you to do it
[2:14:50] oh yes we can go through the scriptures
[2:14:51] there and see god calling this one and
[2:14:54] god calling that one but they they
[2:14:56] responded
[2:14:57] to god
[2:14:58] but they did they did it the way they
[2:15:00] thought that they should do it
[2:15:02] but god eventually had to come down and
[2:15:04] correct them
[2:15:05] i said don't do this don't do that and
[2:15:08] god had to separate them
[2:15:14] we never thought about that before
[2:15:16] we figured oh maybe maybe abraham
[2:15:18] thought well oh wonderful lord you're
[2:15:20] going to call me out and you're going to
[2:15:22] call me into a promised land this is
[2:15:23] going to be wonderful so he brought his
[2:15:25] father with him and some other relatives
[2:15:27] with him and god no
[2:15:29] god called him but he didn't call them
[2:15:33] well i'm not saying they weren't they
[2:15:34] wouldn't they wouldn't want to be lost
[2:15:38] again
[2:15:39] like god called us but again brother all
[2:15:41] it is called is not going to be bright
[2:15:45] the bride is going to be in the city but
[2:15:47] there's going to be many others outside
[2:15:48] the city will you leave it with the lord
[2:15:53] how many really trust god
[2:15:55] and they really have faith in god
[2:15:59] you know and and believe to believe lord
[2:16:01] i believe you're righteous lord i
[2:16:02] believe you are lord i trust you lord
[2:16:05] that you're not you're not going to
[2:16:06] unrighteously condemn this wonder the
[2:16:08] condemn that one no no so lord i leave
[2:16:11] that with you
[2:16:12] because you are righteous
[2:16:15] amen god knows
[2:16:17] but yet there's believers feel that they
[2:16:18] got to do this or they got to do that oh
[2:16:20] we're christians no no
[2:16:22] do what god wants you to do and do where
[2:16:25] god wants you to do it how god wants you
[2:16:26] to do it when god wants you to do it
[2:16:29] brother he's not asking your ideas no no
[2:16:32] he's asking you to accept his stay with
[2:16:34] this
[2:16:35] stay with his will
[2:16:37] not yours
[2:16:39] grace
[2:16:42] so brother abram came out but he brought
[2:16:44] lot and his family
[2:16:47] and he shouldn't have done it
[2:16:49] not that lot was lost no no
[2:16:52] no no
[2:16:55] see there are those that are live in the
[2:16:57] city there are those outside the city
[2:16:59] god help us
[2:17:03] brother let's not try to tell god what
[2:17:05] to do
[2:17:06] let god tell you what to do
[2:17:09] and how to do it
[2:17:11] so there's many other examples in the
[2:17:13] bible that god did god did this and god
[2:17:15] called this and god called that and man
[2:17:18] responded but man added to it
[2:17:21] amen he added to it
[2:17:23] man did it this way and did it that way
[2:17:25] well i'll do it this way lord i'll do
[2:17:27] that no god wants you to do it he's his
[2:17:28] way
[2:17:30] and he had a reason
[2:17:33] he had a reason
[2:17:34] brother we need wisdom thank god but we
[2:17:38] also need faith
[2:17:40] the thing that pleases god is faith
[2:17:43] by the grace of god
[2:17:45] amen
[2:17:49] just bear with me
[2:17:54] didn't realize it was this late
[2:17:57] listen
[2:17:59] don't reason with god
[2:18:01] and don't reason with his word believe
[2:18:03] his word obey his word amen
[2:18:08] listen he said i did quote this before
[2:18:12] he said a reasoning he said god is too
[2:18:15] good
[2:18:16] and he said god's too merciful he loves
[2:18:19] you too much he says you hear that some
[2:18:21] old devil you hear that same old devil
[2:18:24] today he's that's what they feel
[2:18:26] he said god's too good to do this god
[2:18:28] won't do this god won't punish he'll do
[2:18:31] just exactly what his word said he'll do
[2:18:34] amen you shall not surely die see what
[2:18:37] he's trying to do getting her to reason
[2:18:40] with him in a minute
[2:18:41] that you reason on god's word he said
[2:18:44] then you're losing faith
[2:18:46] don't reason
[2:18:48] on the word
[2:18:49] he said don't have no yes no maybe
[2:18:53] he said or so or stay right with it
[2:18:56] he said eve had the right approach but
[2:18:59] she listened to the devil's reasoning
[2:19:02] he suggests just so many people today
[2:19:05] that has the right knowledge
[2:19:07] that knows this word should be god's
[2:19:10] word and it is god's word but they stand
[2:19:14] and let some seminary student
[2:19:17] reason them out of it
[2:19:19] amen
[2:19:20] oh yeah
[2:19:23] it's like the brother
[2:19:26] it was a i won't say what he was
[2:19:30] but he was a
[2:19:32] professional
[2:19:33] out there in the world
[2:19:36] in what he was doing
[2:19:38] and he approached me
[2:19:42] and
[2:19:44] he said gerald i got a question
[2:19:46] a bible question i said okay
[2:19:51] he said you mean to tell me
[2:19:54] he said that
[2:19:55] somebody out there
[2:19:57] that never went to a
[2:20:00] a bible school
[2:20:02] would
[2:20:03] he he maybe would know more about the
[2:20:05] bible nor more about you know what it
[2:20:08] says and what it means then he said
[2:20:10] somebody that went to a bible college
[2:20:12] for six years
[2:20:15] i said yes
[2:20:20] he said are you sure
[2:20:22] i said yes i'm sure
[2:20:24] i said because the one in the bible
[2:20:25] college is taught by man
[2:20:27] i said the one over there
[2:20:29] i said just i said with no education but
[2:20:32] he's a christian
[2:20:34] and i said he's got the anointing and
[2:20:35] baptism of the holy spirit i said he's
[2:20:38] taught by god
[2:20:40] i said god's revealing the word to him
[2:20:42] and that's why i said he can explain it
[2:20:44] and maybe understand it better than
