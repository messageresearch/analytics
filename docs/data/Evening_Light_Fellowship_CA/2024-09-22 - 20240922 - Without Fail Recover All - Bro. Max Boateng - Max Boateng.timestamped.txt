[46:59] if you want to take a title this morning
[47:01] amen we we we want to speak on without

[47:10] recover all amen we we know that we're
[47:13] living in an age amen we're living in an
[47:15] age of the greatest battle that has ever
[47:17] been fought amen as an age of the
[47:20] greatest battle that's s been fought and
[47:21] we know that this battle is not it's not
[47:24] a caral battle amen the battle ATT that
[47:27] we're facing is not a caral battle but
[47:29] it's a spiritual battle amen and if we
[47:31] look in the book of Ephesians Ephesians
[47:33] chapter 6 verse verse 10 to 15 will say
[47:36] finally my brethren be strong in the
[47:38] Lord and in the power of His might put
[47:41] on the whole armor of God that ye may be
[47:44] able to stand against the voids of the
[47:46] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[47:49] and blood but against principalities
[47:51] against Powers against the rulers of the
[47:54] darkness of this world against spir
[47:56] spiritual Wicked winess in holy places
[47:59] amen so Paul is showing us that a battle
[48:01] that we're facing is not a caral battle
[48:03] amen we're facing enemies that are
[48:05] operating in a spiritual Dimension amen
[48:08] no matter what we we we do no matter
[48:10] what we face no matter what comes away
[48:13] it is a power it is something that is
[48:14] fighting against us it's the enemy that
[48:16] that is encroaching us now I just want
[48:18] to read a quote here from brother
[48:19] Brandon in the service a blushing
[48:21] Prophet you know brother brandom is
[48:23] coming to the end of the service and and
[48:25] as he come to the end of the service
[48:27] there are people at the altar and they
[48:28] praying and they calling on the Lord and
[48:31] brother brandham will begin to make the
[48:32] statement and you say to see these young
[48:36] women coming weeping Lo before them he
[48:39] said they are at a crossroad he said
[48:41] they are a victim of circumstances and
[48:43] then brother brand began to say Do You
[48:45] Realize old man when we were boys our
[48:48] boys has got 10 times the Temptation
[48:51] that we had it says sister do you
[48:53] realize that your daughter has 10 times
[48:56] The Temptations you had when you was a
[48:59] girl is said that will that will her
[49:02] daughter have is said what will her
[49:04] daughter have look at the T the pictures
[49:06] the devil's paint amen so brother
[49:09] Brandon is saying listen you know and
[49:10] this is 1956 and was telling the the
[49:14] older man there to say listen your
[49:16] children are going to have 10 times the
[49:18] Temptation that you had amen now if we
[49:21] were to do the calculation you can only
[49:23] imagine what the Temptation is today
[49:25] that we are faced as parents as young
[49:28] people whatever age you are the
[49:30] Temptation has increased amen and this
[49:33] temptation that we are facing it is not
[49:35] just the natural temptation but it's a
[49:38] spiritual Temptation it's a battle that
[49:39] is going on in our minds amen it's not a
[49:43] physical battle but it's a battle that
[49:45] is going on in our mind amen if we were
[49:48] if we were to trace you know any any
[49:50] Temptation that we face if we were to
[49:53] trace you know any lukewarm Spirit or we
[49:55] were to trace any trouble in the home or
[49:58] any trouble in the church if we were to
[50:00] trace it back we will always find out or
[50:03] most of the time we will find that that
[50:05] the root course of it began with a
[50:08] thought that was contrary to the word
[50:11] amen amen if you trace back any issue
[50:14] whether it be in the home whether it be
[50:16] in the church whether it be in your own
[50:18] personal life if you trace it all the
[50:20] way back you will find out that
[50:22] somewhere you receive the thought
[50:25] somewhere you accepted the thought
[50:27] somewhere you accepted something that
[50:29] was contrary to the word of God Amen and
[50:32] when you were accepted that what did you
[50:34] do it was like you took in you a seed
[50:36] amen and when you took that seed into
[50:39] your mind it begin to mature amen it
[50:42] begin to mature and as it began to
[50:44] mature every seed when you take it and
[50:47] you plant it and it begins to mature
[50:49] it'll begin to bring forth fruits amen
[50:52] so if you take an evil seed and you keep
[50:54] feeding on it and allowing it to mature
[50:57] it'll begin to bring forth negativity
[50:59] amen and so it'll begin to bring forth
[51:02] trouble in a home or or trouble in your
[51:04] life or whatever it is why because you
[51:06] took a seed that was contrary to the
[51:08] word of God but if you were to take the
[51:11] word of God in your mind the word of God
[51:14] in your mind will begin to bring forth
[51:16] the fruit of the word it'll begin to
[51:18] bring forth peace it'll begin to bring
[51:20] forth Joy it'll begin to bring forth
[51:22] unity in the home why because it is the
[51:25] word of God Amen so whatever seed you
[51:28] take in your mind and you allow it to
[51:30] mature it will bring forth the fruit and
[51:33] you know brother brand would say there
[51:34] is where we are facing our greatest
[51:36] battle amen it is in our mind amen
[51:40] because we have being bombarded by the
[51:42] enemy from every front amen you walk
[51:45] down the street the enem is bombarding
[51:47] you in your mind wherever you go you
[51:50] have a bombarding of the enemy but on
[51:52] the other hand there is a God of
[51:55] destroying to get a hold of you there is
[51:57] a God of a try to fulfill a second fold
[52:00] purpose which is to have the preeminence
[52:02] in his Bri amen and if we allow him to
[52:06] have that preeminence and so it of it
[52:09] will bring forth the fruits amen it'll
[52:12] bring forth the fruit that the word
[52:14] speaks about amen but if we accept amen
[52:18] the the the thought of the enemy it will
[52:20] yield an evil fruit amen I believe that
[52:23] the church amen has come to a place
[52:25] where we need to recognize the two
[52:28] spirits that are operating in the
[52:29] framework of the church amen we've come
[52:33] to a place where we need to recognize
[52:35] the two spirits that are operating in
[52:37] the framework and in the of the church
[52:40] and resist the Antichrist Spirit now now
[52:42] brother Brandon will speak again in
[52:44] Revelation in the in the church age book
[52:47] Amen in the introduction portion of it
[52:49] brother brand will say now remember this
[52:51] Christ in the true church is a
[52:53] continuation of the book of Acts is said
[52:56] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[52:58] that the Antichrist spirit will come
[53:01] into the church and defoil it making it
[53:03] look warm formal and Powerless is that
[53:07] it exposes Satan revealing his work
[53:09] attempted destruction of God's people
[53:12] and the discrediting of God's word is
[53:14] that right down to the time he is cast
[53:17] into the Lake of Fire he forced that he
[53:19] cannot standard he said he knows that if
[53:22] the people can get the true revelation
[53:25] of the true church and what she is what
[53:28] she stands for and that she can do the
[53:31] greater work she will be an invincible
[53:33] Army it said if they get a true
[53:35] revelation of the two Spirits within the
[53:38] framework of the Christian church and
[53:41] boy God spirit deser and withstand the
[53:44] Antichrist Spirit it that Satan will be
[53:46] powerless beforee it said he will be as
[53:50] definitely toward today as when Christ
[53:52] with stod his every effort to gain power
[53:55] over him in the the do he said yeah
[53:58] Satan hates Revelation but we love it he
[54:01] said with through Revelation in our
[54:03] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[54:06] against us but we will prevail over them
[54:09] amen now we we read this quote and we
[54:12] know it very well but you see we can
[54:14] leave it as a quote sitting on a on a
[54:16] page of a book amen we can leave it as a
[54:19] quote sitting on a page of the book but
[54:21] we can take this code amen if we were to
[54:23] take this code and begin to meditate
[54:25] upon it allow this Cod to be a seed on
[54:28] the inside of us because brother Bram is
[54:30] saying that there are two spirits in the
[54:33] framework of the church that is working
[54:35] an antichrist Spirit and the spirit of
[54:38] God but brother brand is saying if we
[54:39] will withstand the Antichrist spirit
[54:42] amen and how are we going to withand it
[54:45] brother bam said that that if we withand
[54:47] it just the way Jesus did I think you
[54:50] Matthew chapter 4 where he Resto with
[54:52] the word he said that the enemy will be
[54:55] just ased as it was when Jesus Resto him
[54:59] that day in Matthew chapter 4 when he
[55:01] came down off the mountain amen he said
[55:04] if we would and then and if we do that
[55:06] it says that the Gates of Hell cannot
[55:08] Prevail against us amen it can Prevail
[55:11] against the church amen because you see
[55:13] if we don't discern the spirit these two
[55:16] spirits in the framework of the church
[55:17] and listen as I'm talking about the
[55:19] church I'm not just talking about the
[55:21] church as a body now you ought to
[55:22] remember that you are a church amen you
[55:25] are the church yourself you individually
[55:28] you are the church amen so when I'm
[55:30] talking about the church it's not just
[55:32] the group amen but put yourself in the
[55:34] picture amen because within you is a
[55:36] battle amen the true battle is within
[55:39] you brother brand was saying my greatest
[55:41] enemy is not is not anyone else but my
[55:43] greatest enemy is William iron brandham
[55:46] amen and our greatest enemy is our own
[55:48] selves amen there is where the battle is
[55:50] taking place amen there is where the
[55:53] enemy is fighting us amen because these
[55:55] two spirits the church the Antichrist
[55:57] Spirit if we don't withstand it amen it
[56:00] will bring the church to a powerless
[56:02] condition listen if we don't withstand
[56:04] the Antichrist Spirit it'll bring you
[56:06] and me to a powerless situation amen
[56:08] it'll bring us to a place amen where
[56:11] Satan will continually Rob us amen Satan
[56:15] will continually Rob us and Rob us and
[56:17] Rob us why because we are not recogniz
[56:20] them and withand them that Spirit are
[56:23] destroying to rob the seed of God has
[56:26] been predestinated and placed on the
[56:28] inside of us
[56:31] amen amen but what we want is that true
[56:35] Revelation boy the spirit in our lives
[56:39] that will prevail against amen against
[56:41] the Gates of Hell amen see Satan's
[56:45] tactic of infiltrating into our lives
[56:49] amen is boy invad in our
[56:53] minds amen listen he hasn't changed
[56:57] the way
[57:00] he infiltrates himself into our lives is
[57:04] boy invading our
[57:06] minds amen what does he do he invades
[57:09] our minds and he create camps amen now
[57:11] now we can go back in the Old Testament
[57:13] and and we can we can see the strategy
[57:15] of the enemy you see when the enemy in
[57:18] the Old Testament when he wanted to take
[57:19] a city when the enemy came against the
[57:22] city and wanted to take it you know what
[57:23] they will do there is an instance in the
[57:25] Bible in the Old Testament what the
[57:27] enemy will do is that they will besiege
[57:29] the
[57:30] city amen they will besiege that City
[57:33] amen and when they besiege the city they
[57:36] won't attack it right away but they just
[57:38] sit there they just sit there around the
[57:41] city what are they doing they're not
[57:43] allowing anyone to go out of the city
[57:45] and they not allowing anyone to come
[57:47] into the City and they just leave them
[57:50] just left alone in the city why because
[57:53] they know that there's going to come a
[57:54] time where they're going to run out of
[57:57] resources there's going to come a time
[57:59] they're going to run out of of all the
[58:01] food that they have and so and so
[58:03] they'll just Bes and just sit there and
[58:05] wait until the the city is completely
[58:09] weak amen they'll just sit there and
[58:11] watch and wait until amen they've run
[58:14] out of all their substances if the
[58:15] people don't want to give up right away
[58:17] they'll sit there and wait until the
[58:19] people are weak until the enemy is weak
[58:21] and once everyone is weak what does the
[58:23] enemy do he just walks in and takes it
[58:25] off over amen that's what that that's
[58:28] the way that was one of the strategies
[58:30] by which the enemy would take a city in
[58:32] the Old Testament but you know the enem
[58:34] is doing the same thing to us but in a
[58:36] spiritual in a spiritual way amen listen
[58:39] he will come and he will sit in your
[58:41] mind amen he'll just sit in your mind
[58:44] he'll just give you a thought and just
[58:45] sit there in your mind amen he he's not
[58:48] really doing much but he's just allowing
[58:50] you to just take that thought and just
[58:53] begin to mature that thought are you
[58:55] with me and you just sit there and allow
[58:57] you just to mature it and mature it and
[59:00] very soon you just find yourself being
[59:02] discouraged very soon you just find
[59:04] yourself having trouble with your
[59:06] brother very soon you start finding
[59:08] yourself you know having trouble at home
[59:11] with your wife or with your children
[59:12] what did he do he just sat in your mind
[59:15] he just gave you a thought that was not
[59:17] true amen and you just accepted that
[59:19] thought and when you accepted that
[59:21] thought it begin to mature amen and then
[59:23] he will stay there until you come to a
[59:25] place where you begin to lose your faith
[59:28] in the word of God where you begin to
[59:30] lose your confidence in approaching God
[59:34] now you begin to see the temple starts
[59:36] to rise and different things of your old
[59:38] nature start to rise up again why
[59:41] because he came and he just encamped
[59:44] besiege your city amen he just besieged
[59:48] the seed of God that is on the inside of
[59:50] you what was he doing he was trying to
[59:53] block by reasoning he was trying to
[59:57] block the inflow of the
[59:59] word are you with me he was trying to
[1:00:02] block the inflow of the word he will get
[1:00:05] you because once he gets into your mind
[1:00:07] listen you will sit in a service and the
[1:00:09] preaching of the word will go forward
[1:00:11] but you can't receive it amen you can't
[1:00:14] receive it because there is a thought
[1:00:17] there is something that Satan has put in
[1:00:19] you that the word is just passing you
[1:00:21] boy and you're reasoning every word
[1:00:23] listen he can bring you to a place where
[1:00:25] you in the service and the preacher will
[1:00:27] be preaching and you would think oh he's
[1:00:29] against me your pastor will be preaching
[1:00:31] you be thinking he's against me but he's
[1:00:33] not against you it is the holy ghost
[1:00:36] that is speaking to the church but
[1:00:38] because you've allowed a certain thought
[1:00:41] are you with me this morning because
[1:00:43] you've allowed a certain thought to take
[1:00:45] root now you're not being able to
[1:00:48] receive the word and the word is what
[1:00:50] you need to fight your battles amen but
[1:00:53] now you can't receive it because you
[1:00:56] allow a thought to command and when that
[1:00:58] thought begins to mature now you can't
[1:01:01] receive the word there is no inflow of
[1:01:04] the word and if there is no inflow of
[1:01:06] the word then there is no outflow of the
[1:01:09] manifestation of the same word and you
[1:01:12] know what you've what the enemy has done
[1:01:14] he has just made you
[1:01:17] powerless he has just made you powerless
[1:01:20] that is the Antichrist spirit that is
[1:01:22] trying to operate and destroy the Church
[1:01:25] of the Living God well let me say to you
[1:01:28] this morning I believe that it's time
[1:01:30] for the bride of Christ to rise above
[1:01:33] amen it's time for the bride of Christ
[1:01:36] to rise above the Antichrist Spirit
[1:01:39] listen brother Brandon will tell us a
[1:01:41] story above an eagle he said it was an
[1:01:44] eagle and there was a storm that came
[1:01:46] and he said that the storm brought down
[1:01:48] the eagle amen it said the storm brought
[1:01:51] down the eagle and when the storm
[1:01:53] brought down the eagle it said now the
[1:01:55] eagle was sitting down there and there
[1:01:57] was this squirrel you remember Brandon
[1:01:59] was watching the scene and it said there
[1:02:01] was this squirrel that was just going
[1:02:03] chatter chatter chatter and chatter
[1:02:05] chatter chatter and brother brand said
[1:02:06] he thought that the squirrel was
[1:02:08] speaking was concerned of him but he
[1:02:10] said when he looked the squirel wasn't
[1:02:12] really concerned of him but the squirel
[1:02:14] was concerned of the eagle amen and the
[1:02:17] eagle was sitting there and it was just
[1:02:19] L into the chatter chatter of the
[1:02:21] squirrel amen but it came a point where
[1:02:24] the eagle got s and tired of the chatter
[1:02:27] chatter of the squirel are you with me
[1:02:30] listen it's time for the Brio to begin
[1:02:32] to get sick and tired of the chatter
[1:02:35] chatter of the enemy of the many voices
[1:02:37] that we're hearing it is time for the BR
[1:02:40] to get to a place where we say I am sick
[1:02:42] and tired of hearing that this enemy
[1:02:45] completely you know with a voices that
[1:02:47] is completely bombarding over and over
[1:02:49] again my mind and brother Bram said you
[1:02:52] know what the eagle did he said the
[1:02:54] eagle just begin to set us when Wings
[1:02:56] amen it said the eagle began to set his
[1:02:59] swing brother Bram said I pulled out my
[1:03:01] rifle and I could have shot that eagle
[1:03:03] but he said the eagle wasn't worried
[1:03:05] about me and my rifle amen it said it
[1:03:08] wasn't worried about me and my rifle
[1:03:10] because the eagle was trusting in his
[1:03:12] wings it's time for the church to trust
[1:03:15] in the word that has been given to us
[1:03:18] and brother BR said he had two wings and
[1:03:20] it said it was the old and the New
[1:03:22] Testament listen when you take the full
[1:03:24] word when you take the full word the
[1:03:27] enemy has no power or no authority over
[1:03:31] you amen it's not just about taking the
[1:03:33] full word but when you cast the
[1:03:36] Revelation when you cast the revelation
[1:03:38] of the word the enemy has no power or
[1:03:42] authority over
[1:03:44] you oh
[1:03:46] hallelujah oh
[1:03:49] hallelujah it's time to rise up amen
[1:03:52] it's time to rise up amen
[1:03:55] oh
[1:03:57] hallelujah hallelujah he's using the
[1:04:00] same strategy amen try to block the
[1:04:03] inflow amen of the word of
[1:04:07] God remember as we said that the enemy
[1:04:11] will always start with a thought he will
[1:04:13] always start with a thought that is
[1:04:15] slightly contrary to the word of God
[1:04:17] listen that's exactly what he did to Eve
[1:04:20] amen he came to Eve with a thought that
[1:04:22] was slightly contrary to the word of God
[1:04:25] listen it was
[1:04:26] 99.999% right amen but that that
[1:04:30] .1% that was wrong was enough to destroy
[1:04:34] amen was enough to bring chaos in the
[1:04:37] order that God has placed amen listen we
[1:04:39] need to take the full word not just a
[1:04:42] part of the word amen not just a part of
[1:04:44] the message that we've received but we
[1:04:47] need to take it all amen you see the
[1:04:49] moment Eve the moment Eve begin to
[1:04:51] listen to listen to that Serpent and
[1:04:54] what he was saying amen it start to
[1:04:56] bring Eve to a place where he start to
[1:04:59] get out of Fellowship amen start to get
[1:05:02] out of Fellowship amen out of fellowship
[1:05:06] with the word of God Amen to bring a chm
[1:05:09] between him and the word but listen I
[1:05:11] believe that this evening I am not
[1:05:13] speaking to the first Eve but I believe
[1:05:15] that this morning I'm speaking to the
[1:05:17] second Eve and the prophecy that is gone
[1:05:20] about concerning the second Eve is that
[1:05:22] the second Eve cannnot be deceived amen
[1:05:26] there's a prophecy that has gone up over
[1:05:29] you as the Bry that you can't be
[1:05:31] deceived now I want you to know that the
[1:05:33] prophecy wasn't just you know a thought
[1:05:35] of a man but was God's declaration over
[1:05:38] you that you cannot are you with me he
[1:05:41] said that you cannot be deceived amen
[1:05:45] why because listen you are not just the
[1:05:47] boy product amen but you are made off of
[1:05:51] the same seed amen you are a part you
[1:05:54] are an attribute of god listen right now
[1:05:57] that you were sitting there it might be
[1:05:59] hard for you to believe it but right now
[1:06:01] you were sitting there there is a
[1:06:02] portion of God on the inside of you are
[1:06:05] you with me there is a portion of God on
[1:06:07] the inside of you though it's been
[1:06:09] covered and wrapped around with your
[1:06:11] body but in you is God in you is dy
[1:06:18] amen and if you are being deceived then
[1:06:21] that means that God can be
[1:06:23] deceived are you with me
[1:06:26] if you can be deceived then God can be
[1:06:28] deceived because you have a portion of
[1:06:30] God in
[1:06:31] you that's why he said that you cannot
[1:06:34] be deceived amen why because you have
[1:06:37] God in you and God cannot be deceived so
[1:06:39] you also cannot be deceived amen that is
[1:06:43] the second Eve that I believe I'm
[1:06:44] talking to this eve this morning amen I
[1:06:47] believe that not only am I talking to
[1:06:49] the second Eve but I'm also talking to a
[1:06:51] Shar outfit amen now now how many know
[1:06:54] Shar in the boy
[1:06:56] you know Samar in the Bible listen I
[1:06:58] believe that I'm talking to a Samar
[1:07:00] outfit you know a Samar outfit is the
[1:07:02] kind of outfit that they get to a place
[1:07:04] where they begin to come to a revelation
[1:07:06] of who they are amen that's the sh guy
[1:07:09] right listen you might have been sitting
[1:07:11] there and watching the enemy rob you
[1:07:13] year after year you might have been
[1:07:15] sitting there watching the enemy rob you
[1:07:17] service after service listen you might
[1:07:19] be sitting there watching the enemy
[1:07:21] destroying your home destroying your
[1:07:23] family tearing your home apart listen
[1:07:25] you might be sitting there watching that
[1:07:27] year after year but listen the shamba
[1:07:30] outfit comes to a point where they say I
[1:07:33] am sick and tired of watching this enemy
[1:07:35] coming year after year Time After Time
[1:07:38] robbing my
[1:07:40] crop amen amen sha just had to come to a
[1:07:45] revelation of who he was and this Bri
[1:07:49] only has to come to a revelation of who
[1:07:52] she is amen because when you begin to
[1:07:56] realize that this whole program is not
[1:07:59] about
[1:08:00] you are you with me this whole program
[1:08:03] is not about you this whole program is
[1:08:07] not about your flesh this whole program
[1:08:09] is not about a battle of your face and
[1:08:11] in your mind but this program is God's
[1:08:14] program this program is about to
[1:08:17] predestinate a seed of God that is on
[1:08:19] the inside of you amen and when you
[1:08:22] realize that when that seed comes under
[1:08:25] the Lord
[1:08:26] amen when it comes under the light of
[1:08:28] the word it will bring forth its fruit
[1:08:31] amen and you can go back in the Bible
[1:08:33] and look at the fruit that it brought
[1:08:35] forth listen there was no sickness that
[1:08:37] could stand in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:08:40] that would not be healed listen the dead
[1:08:42] was raised amen now you may look at that
[1:08:44] and say well but that was Miracles and
[1:08:46] that was in the natural well bring it
[1:08:48] down to the spiritual what are the dead
[1:08:50] conditions in your life amen what are
[1:08:53] the dead conditions in your home what
[1:08:55] are the dead conditions that you are
[1:08:56] facing amen listen that same Jesus that
[1:08:59] walked on Earth amen that the raised up
[1:09:02] every dead is that same Jesus that is in
[1:09:04] you boy the Holy Ghost amen he's the
[1:09:08] same one that is in you boy the Holy
[1:09:10] Ghost to do what to turn every dead
[1:09:13] condition into life amen listen the
[1:09:16] scripture said that he came to B the
[1:09:18] Brokenhearted Amen to set the Liberty
[1:09:20] the captive uh to open the prison doors
[1:09:23] to those that are in prison amen listen
[1:09:25] that same spirit is still here to
[1:09:28] operate in you and in
[1:09:30] me amen that same Jesus is here to open
[1:09:35] every prison door he's here to set every
[1:09:37] captive free he's here to do the same
[1:09:39] thing that he did at the beginning but
[1:09:42] we are going to have to allow him to do
[1:09:44] it we are going to have to come to a
[1:09:46] realization that it's not about your
[1:09:50] mistakes listen Church the enemy will
[1:09:53] try to condemn you he man he'll condemn
[1:09:56] you over and over again well I want to
[1:09:59] say to you this morning you have been
[1:10:01] released from
[1:10:04] condemnation you have been released from
[1:10:06] any condemnation listen you you may
[1:10:10] bring to God and say you know I did this
[1:10:12] and I did that amen you may be sitting
[1:10:14] here this morning and say you know I'm
[1:10:16] not worthy to be here I'm not worthy
[1:10:18] because of what I said or because of
[1:10:19] what I did or because of what I watched
[1:10:21] but let me say this the moment you
[1:10:23] confess it it is
[1:10:26] gone amen listen forget about your
[1:10:28] condemnation Satan has used that tactic
[1:10:31] to rob the church for too long where the
[1:10:33] people will sit in the church and with
[1:10:35] condemnation that is not actually the
[1:10:38] truth because God is not looking at you
[1:10:41] in the natural God is looking at you
[1:10:43] through the blood amen and listen when
[1:10:46] he looks through the blood he sees a
[1:10:48] perfect picture amen listen God is
[1:10:50] looking at you as at the seed that is on
[1:10:53] the inside of you that seed is
[1:10:56] perfect amen that seed is perfect listen
[1:11:01] whatever happens on the outside that is
[1:11:03] not you that is the unredeemed flesh
[1:11:06] that you are carrying with
[1:11:09] you don't allow Satan to take that and
[1:11:12] Rob
[1:11:13] you because that is not
[1:11:16] you that is not you listen brother
[1:11:20] brandham had mistakes but the same
[1:11:21] brother brandham would speak squir into
[1:11:23] existence
[1:11:25] are you with me he was a man amen he was
[1:11:29] a man he was under a prophetic Ministry
[1:11:31] indeed he was but he was a man he made
[1:11:33] mistake and he was he he he he was a
[1:11:36] Hest man enough to talk about his
[1:11:38] mistakes to show to us that we are
[1:11:40] humans and we can make mistakes but the
[1:11:43] moment we make the mistake and we
[1:11:44] confess it it is gone amen it is gone
[1:11:48] like brother Bram talks about the bleach
[1:11:49] it is gone it's been wiped away he
[1:11:52] doesn't remember it anymore listen you
[1:11:54] can go to you can sit in a church and
[1:11:56] Satan will telling you listen you can't
[1:11:58] approach God because of this or because
[1:12:00] of that or because of this or because of
[1:12:02] that and God is sitting in heaven saying
[1:12:04] what are you talking about what are you
[1:12:07] talking about I don't remember any of
[1:12:09] these things it's been erised it's been
[1:12:11] put on the sea of God's
[1:12:15] forgetfulness oh
[1:12:17] hallelujah it's been put in the sea of
[1:12:20] God's forgetfulness it is time for us to
[1:12:22] come to a revelation of who we truly are
[1:12:25] that we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:12:28] and come to a place where you know
[1:12:29] brother brand said that sham girl's
[1:12:30] righteous indignation rose up to say I'm
[1:12:33] sick and tired of this you know we need
[1:12:35] to come to a place where we I'm sick and
[1:12:37] tired of watching the enemy over and
[1:12:39] over again battling me in my mind and
[1:12:41] rob a me of the promises that God has
[1:12:44] given me because you know the reason why
[1:12:47] we we we not seeing the Bible coming to
[1:12:49] effect in our life the way it's supposed
[1:12:51] to be is because of Fe it's because the
[1:12:53] battle in the m
[1:12:56] that's the reason why is because we we
[1:12:59] feel like we are unworthy but God has
[1:13:01] counted you
[1:13:02] worthy he's already counted you worthy
[1:13:06] amen so it's time to begin to look at
[1:13:09] past the mistakes and we're going to
[1:13:11] make mistakes of course we make mistakes
[1:13:14] we are always going to make mistakes
[1:13:15] because of the flesh we are in but God
[1:13:17] is not looking at your mistake the
[1:13:19] moment you confess it amen there's a
[1:13:23] reason why he said confess your sins one
[1:13:25] to another amen because once it's
[1:13:28] confessed it's gone amen you are just as
[1:13:31] perfect as you've never done it in the
[1:13:33] first place you were
[1:13:35] Justified amen you were Justified but we
[1:13:39] need to come to that realization because
[1:13:42] you see once condemnation begins to hurt
[1:13:45] then we lose the confidence amen we lose
[1:13:48] the confidence because you know if your
[1:13:50] heart condemns you not then have you
[1:13:53] confidence towards God
[1:13:55] but when your heart condemns you oh then
[1:13:57] you have no confidence you're going
[1:13:59] before God and you're praying but in
[1:14:01] reality you you have a date in your mind
[1:14:04] because why you feel like you know I'm
[1:14:06] not worthy to receive what I'm asking
[1:14:07] offer but God is saying if you can just
[1:14:10] have faith if you could just break it
[1:14:12] past this dat and whatever you you think
[1:14:14] because God doesn't doesn't doesn't
[1:14:16] remember it it is the enemy that is
[1:14:19] trying to remind you of things that have
[1:14:21] been
[1:14:23] forgotten and he's using that to rob the
[1:14:25] church and he's using that to to to take
[1:14:28] us to a place where we don't have the
[1:14:30] confidence to go before the Lord in
[1:14:32] faith and claim what has been given to
[1:14:35] us amen and the Shamar outfit is those
[1:14:38] kind of people who come to a place that
[1:14:40] says you know what I am sick and tired
[1:14:42] of this I am sick and tired of watching
[1:14:44] the enemy robing me this way and come to
[1:14:47] place and say you know what I'm going to
[1:14:48] take the word I'm going to take the word
[1:14:51] I'm going to take God out his word and
[1:14:53] I'm going to believe it and watch God
[1:14:55] bring his word to pass listen brother
[1:14:58] Brown talk about God proving his word
[1:15:00] God is ready to prove his word he's
[1:15:02] ready to prove his word amen but we have
[1:15:05] to come to a place where we believe that
[1:15:07] he can prove his
[1:15:09] word because he's ready to prove it amen
[1:15:12] that's where shra had to come to to a
[1:15:14] place where amen he got to know who he
[1:15:16] was and when he got to know who he was
[1:15:20] amen was about I think 6 600 or 6,000
[1:15:23] Philistines and he told them all
[1:15:26] apart amen he told them all apart Bo
[1:15:29] because he came to know who he is amen
[1:15:32] listen our mind wasn't given to us to be
[1:15:34] the playground of the enemy are you with
[1:15:37] me that's not what our mind was given us
[1:15:39] to be it's not given to us to be the
[1:15:41] playgr of the enemy amen but our mind
[1:15:44] the scripture will tell us he said have
[1:15:46] the mind of God or have the mind of
[1:15:48] Christ he said let the mind that is in
[1:15:51] Christ be in you he said love the Lord
[1:15:53] with all your mind and your
[1:15:55] your heart and your mind he will say you
[1:15:58] know we talk about you know be the same
[1:16:01] be likeminded one towards the order amen
[1:16:04] so we can see that the mo is a place
[1:16:06] where God wants you to operate because
[1:16:08] listen there is where you begin to
[1:16:10] meditate upon the word of God Amen
[1:16:13] listen brother brandom that day when he
[1:16:15] was sitting there be under that tree do
[1:16:17] you know what he was doing he was
[1:16:19] meditating upon the word of God Amen he
[1:16:22] was creating an atmosphere and then the
[1:16:25] presence of the Lord through now amen
[1:16:27] and the scri was spoken into existence
[1:16:29] but you see we have to come to
[1:16:31] realization that we are facing two
[1:16:33] Powers we are facing two Powers there
[1:16:36] are two powers that are wanting to gain
[1:16:38] preeminence in our mind amen only two
[1:16:42] powers and that's the power of Satan and
[1:16:44] the power of God Amen and I want you to
[1:16:47] realize that that this power the Battle
[1:16:50] of these two Powers didn't begin when
[1:16:52] you were born but the Battle of these
[1:16:55] two Powers
[1:16:56] began Ro In Heaven There is where the
[1:17:00] battle began when Lucifer PR Pride was
[1:17:03] found in the heart of Lucifer there is
[1:17:06] where the battle began Isaiah chapter
[1:17:08] 14: 13-4 will say is that for thou has
[1:17:11] said in D heart I will Ascend into
[1:17:14] Heavens is that I will exalt my throne
[1:17:16] above the stars of God I will say is
[1:17:18] that oil will sit also upon the mate of
[1:17:21] the congregation in the so of the north
[1:17:23] is that oil will Ascend above of the he
[1:17:25] of the CL clouds and it said I will be
[1:17:28] like the most high who was that that was
[1:17:30] Lucifer speaking amen Pride Rose upon
[1:17:34] his heart amen and Lucifer in his
[1:17:36] attempt in his attempt to overthrow the
[1:17:39] kingdom of God you with me Lucifer in
[1:17:42] his attempt to overthrow the kingdom of
[1:17:44] God you know what he begin to do he
[1:17:46] begin to get into the mind of some of
[1:17:49] the angels in
[1:17:50] heaven amen he begin to get into the
[1:17:53] mind of some of the Angels in heaven and
[1:17:55] letting those angels think that he had a
[1:17:58] better idea than dear Creator had amen
[1:18:02] it begin to let them think amen that he
[1:18:05] had a better plan than what the Creator
[1:18:07] had amen he begin to get them to a place
[1:18:10] that they begin to doubt dear Creator
[1:18:13] amen are you with me isn't not exactly
[1:18:15] what the enemy is doing to us he's
[1:18:17] trying to get us to a place to dat our
[1:18:20] creator he's trying to get us to a place
[1:18:22] to think that he has a better idea
[1:18:25] than what the creator has he tried to
[1:18:27] get us to think that we have a better
[1:18:29] idea than what the bible say that we
[1:18:31] have a better idea than what the message
[1:18:34] says that's exactly what he began to do
[1:18:37] in in heaven try to get into the mind of
[1:18:40] these angels and the scripture will say
[1:18:42] that he drew oneir of the angels of
[1:18:45] heaven with what with his tail in other
[1:18:48] words with his Lo amen with his Lo he
[1:18:51] drew oneir of the Angels the were in
[1:18:56] heaven because he Loy to them and he
[1:18:58] drew oneir of those angels and these
[1:19:01] oneir of angels gather themselves
[1:19:03] together to do what to fight against
[1:19:05] Michael amen Michael and his angels now
[1:19:08] we know that Michael is the figurative
[1:19:10] part or type of Christ amen we know
[1:19:14] that's what Michael is amen just like
[1:19:16] you know Jesus was was was was Christ
[1:19:18] made flesh in the Angelic realm Michael
[1:19:21] is like the representation of Christ
[1:19:24] amen and so Lucifer he gathered these
[1:19:26] angels to fight against Michael and his
[1:19:29] angels but the scripture will tell us
[1:19:31] the end of the battle amen the scripture
[1:19:34] will tell us the end of the battle in
[1:19:35] Revelation 12 verse 7-9 and it said and
[1:19:39] there was war in heaven and said Michael
[1:19:41] and his angels fought against the dragon
[1:19:44] and the dragon fought against his angels
[1:19:47] and the scripture says that and
[1:19:48] prevailed not neither was their place
[1:19:52] found anymore in heaven and it said the
[1:19:54] Great Dragon was cast out the old
[1:19:56] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[1:19:59] deceived the whole world he was cast out
[1:20:01] into the Earth and his angels were cast
[1:20:04] out with him so that is when the battle
[1:20:09] moved from a Heavenly realm to an
[1:20:11] Earthly realm and the mo became the
[1:20:14] battle gra amen the mo became the battle
[1:20:18] gra but I want you to notice
[1:20:20] something we believe that we are the
[1:20:22] predestinated seed of God we came from
[1:20:25] God and we're going back to God Amen how
[1:20:28] many believe that this morning that we
[1:20:30] came from God and we're going back to
[1:20:32] God so if we reading the scriptures and
[1:20:34] Revelation is telling us that the battle
[1:20:36] that took place in heaven between Michel
[1:20:39] and the devil and his angels amen if we
[1:20:42] are reading in the scripture that the
[1:20:43] devil did not Prevail now now if you
[1:20:45] look back if we came from God then when
[1:20:49] this battle was taking place in heaven
[1:20:51] you were
[1:20:52] there amen when this battle was taking
[1:20:55] place in heaven you were there your
[1:20:57] predestinated seed was there fighting
[1:21:00] this battle amen and the end result of
[1:21:03] this battle was that the enemy did not
[1:21:06] Prevail amen the end of this battle was
[1:21:09] that the enemy was cast out the end of
[1:21:11] this battle was that the enemy Was
[1:21:13] Defeated amen so if we were in the
[1:21:16] battle in heaven and the enemy was cast
[1:21:18] out and now we've come to the Earth and
[1:21:21] we are facing the same battle in our
[1:21:23] mind and we we have the exact same
[1:21:26] predestinated seed that we had when we
[1:21:29] were in heaven then you tell me what is
[1:21:32] going to be the end result of the battle
[1:21:35] that we are facing now in our mind
[1:21:37] listen if Satan did not Prevail in
[1:21:39] heaven then Satan cannot Prevail here on
[1:21:42] Earth are you with me this morning if it
[1:21:45] did not Prevail there it can't Prevail
[1:21:47] here listen no matter what you will face
[1:21:50] you are greater than the enemy that is
[1:21:52] battling you in your mind because you
[1:21:54] see it it in you has already won the
[1:21:57] battle you see it in you has already
[1:22:00] overcome the see in you has already cast
[1:22:03] out the enemy listen that day on the
[1:22:06] cross when he said that it is finished
[1:22:08] it was finished every enemy Was Defeated
[1:22:12] every sickness Was Defeated every battle
[1:22:14] in the mind was destroyed amen but the
[1:22:18] BR has to come to a
[1:22:21] realization the BR has to come to a
[1:22:24] realiz ation to know that you are a
[1:22:27] Victor to know that you are a winner you
[1:22:30] are on The Winning Side you've already
[1:22:33] overcome you've already won the battle
[1:22:36] amen all you have to do is stand your
[1:22:39] grounds stand your grounds listen when
[1:22:42] they got into Jericho before they got
[1:22:45] into Jericho the captain of the host of
[1:22:48] the Lord had already gone forth brother
[1:22:50] Brandon said you know what the captain
[1:22:52] did the captain went and weaken the GRS
[1:22:55] of the walls amen listen there might be
[1:22:58] walls that have been built in your mind
[1:23:01] there might be walls that the enemy has
[1:23:02] placed there that is hindering you from
[1:23:05] fully producing the power of the word
[1:23:08] but let me say this to you this morning
[1:23:10] those walls the foundation of those
[1:23:12] walls has already been weakened by the
[1:23:15] captain of the host of the
[1:23:17] Lord listen brother brandham said that
[1:23:20] captain of the host of the Lord he said
[1:23:21] you know you know who he was he said it
[1:23:23] was the same pill of fire he said the
[1:23:25] same Pillar of Fire that follow the
[1:23:28] children of Israel he said that Pillar
[1:23:30] of Fire had become a man amen he said
[1:23:33] that Pillar of Fire had become a man and
[1:23:36] he stood there as the captain of the
[1:23:37] host of the Lord and he said that same
[1:23:40] Captain is the same one that stepped
[1:23:42] down in the form of
[1:23:44] Jesus Amen are you looking at a trace of
[1:23:47] him it is the same God as a pillar of
[1:23:50] fire came down as a captain of the host
[1:23:52] of the Lord came down in the form of
[1:23:55] Jesus and what is the holy ghost in
[1:23:58] you what is the holy ghost in you it is
[1:24:01] the same Jesus in the form of a spirit
[1:24:04] in you so if you trace it all the way
[1:24:06] back it is the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:24:09] is on the inside of you if you trace it
[1:24:11] all back it is the same captain that is
[1:24:14] on the inside of
[1:24:16] you so no matter what the walls are in
[1:24:19] your mind those foundations have already
[1:24:22] been
[1:24:22] weakened and all they had to do was just
[1:24:25] March around March around just obey the
[1:24:28] word because that's what Joshua told
[1:24:30] them just March around and they March
[1:24:33] around oh glory be to God listen they
[1:24:35] March around those walls seven times are
[1:24:39] you with me this morning they March
[1:24:40] around those walls seven times what was
[1:24:43] it it was the seventh age amen at the
[1:24:46] seventh age they had to March around and
[1:24:48] a not seven times what was it it was the
[1:24:50] opening of the seals are you with me
[1:24:52] this morning it was the opening of the
[1:24:54] seal in the seventh age at the opening
[1:24:57] of the seventh seal what did they have
[1:24:59] to do they had a
[1:25:02] sh they had a shout you go back in the
[1:25:05] book of Thessalonians what does it say
[1:25:08] that the Lord will descend with what
[1:25:09] with a shout with a voice and with a
[1:25:12] trump so what was the shout brother
[1:25:14] brandham said the shout is the message
[1:25:16] of the
[1:25:17] hour the shout is the message of the
[1:25:20] hour you know how you're going to bring
[1:25:22] down your walls it's boy the the word
[1:25:25] what was the seven seal it was the third
[1:25:28] pool what was the third pool it was the
[1:25:30] opening of the word and other words the
[1:25:33] speaking of the word you Sav today is
[1:25:37] when you can speak the
[1:25:39] word when you begin to speak the word
[1:25:42] the walls begin to crumble that's the
[1:25:45] age that you were living
[1:25:48] in you are living in the age of the S
[1:25:51] don't allow the enemy to rob you don't
[1:25:54] allow the enemy to rob you your walls
[1:25:57] have already been been
[1:25:59] weakened your walls have already been
[1:26:02] weaken amen listen the enemy is going to
[1:26:05] attack you amen he is going to come amen
[1:26:09] he said he'll come and as a flood amen
[1:26:11] he'll come and ask a flood but that is
[1:26:13] not the end of the scripture the
[1:26:15] scripture says that he'll raise a
[1:26:17] standard amen so the enemy is going to
[1:26:20] attack you when you Mo but there will be
[1:26:22] a standard raised what is the standard
[1:26:24] is the word and where is the word the
[1:26:28] word is in the
[1:26:29] bride you are the standard that has been
[1:26:32] raised to destroy the works of the
[1:26:37] enemy but many time we are so
[1:26:40] afraid we are so afraid to speak the
[1:26:42] word we are so
[1:26:45] afraid what if it doesn't
[1:26:47] happen that is where the enemy gets
[1:26:51] you right there what is it is a thought
[1:26:55] that is contrary to the
[1:26:57] word because he said you say to the
[1:27:00] mountain and the mountain will move he
[1:27:02] didn't say if if it will move or maybe
[1:27:05] it'll move or or what if it doesn't move
[1:27:08] that's not what the word says but the
[1:27:09] enemy will come and he'll tell you what
[1:27:11] if it
[1:27:13] doesn't you say what if it doesn't
[1:27:15] happen and right away we listen to that
[1:27:19] we listen to that and once we start to
[1:27:21] listen to that what is it is it Tau is a
[1:27:24] seed it begins to grow and the next
[1:27:27] thing we know well you know what I might
[1:27:29] as well not say it because it won't
[1:27:33] happen you with me this morning I might
[1:27:37] as well not say because it won't happen
[1:27:38] I'm going to make it full off
[1:27:42] myself that is the Loy of the enemy the
[1:27:45] scripture said you confess the word and
[1:27:48] it will come to pass listen church it's
[1:27:51] time to move past the reasoning of the
[1:27:53] enemy
[1:27:55] God is ready to fulfill his word he's
[1:27:58] never going to back off off his word he
[1:28:01] will bring it to pass but someone is
[1:28:03] going to have to confess it someone is
[1:28:06] going to have to speak it someone is
[1:28:08] going to have to have the faith to say

[1:28:35] his soul he believed that he was going
[1:28:38] to receive that child brother Brenham
[1:28:40] will tell us the morning day after day
[1:28:44] he'll ask Sarah listen Sarah how are you
[1:28:47] feeling Sarah said I feeling no
[1:28:49] different but BR say and Abraham said

[1:28:56] attitude of Abraham's seed that
[1:28:58] regardless of condition need to praising
[1:29:01] the Lord to say I will receive my
[1:29:04] blessing they keep praising the Lord to
[1:29:07] say my children are coming home listen

[1:33:59] the Lord because as I am seeing the time
[1:34:01] drawing I I am seeing the promise
[1:34:03] drawing even closer because as if is
[1:34:05] coming and he said he won't lose one

[1:34:20] in he will bring them home
[1:34:25] oh glory be to
[1:34:27] God he will bring them
[1:34:29] home but these two powers are fided
[1:34:33] brother brandham said there is only two
[1:34:35] powers and there's only two kingdoms two
[1:34:37] powers and two kingdoms is that all the
[1:34:40] rest of of the little Minot tens are
[1:34:42] connected to either one of those Powers
[1:34:44] is that in those Powers is God's power
[1:34:47] and Satan's power and it said that's
[1:34:49] what every war every disorder everything
[1:34:51] that comes along it's either controlled
[1:34:53] by God's power or Satan's power he said
[1:34:56] because that's the only two Powers there
[1:34:58] is and that is the power of life and the
[1:35:01] power of De he said now that's the only
[1:35:03] two Powers he say Satan can only he said
[1:35:06] he's he his power he's God he said he's
[1:35:09] God is is a perverted power of God
[1:35:12] that's Satan's power he that Satan is
[1:35:14] God a perverted power of God he said it
[1:35:16] isn't no real power is that it's a it's
[1:35:19] a it's a per it's a perversion of God's
[1:35:23] power power is that everything that
[1:35:25] Satan has that is only perverted life is
[1:35:28] that aoy is only the truth mow is that
[1:35:30] see adultery act misused a righteous act
[1:35:33] misused it says see everything that
[1:35:35] Satan's God is something that was
[1:35:37] perverted but it's a power and I want
[1:35:40] you to notice that is that everything
[1:35:42] that Satan's got is something perverted
[1:35:44] but it's a power listen the thought that
[1:35:47] Satan sends into your mind is God power
[1:35:49] to bring you doubt and to bring you down
[1:35:52] even though it's a perverted power it's
[1:35:54] still God power amen but Brown said it's
[1:35:57] a perverted power but it's still God
[1:35:58] power he said and we are today sitting
[1:36:01] here and one of the other power is going
[1:36:03] to control us it say so let us cast out
[1:36:05] the evil one it said let's take our
[1:36:07] position like the stars of the
[1:36:11] heavens is that as we sitting here one
[1:36:14] of these two powers are going to control
[1:36:16] you is that we're sitting in the church
[1:36:19] listen go back in the Book of Job in the
[1:36:22] Book of Job they got it
[1:36:24] the sons of God gathered and who showed
[1:36:26] up Satan showed
[1:36:29] up Satan showed up right where the
[1:36:32] children of God we gaed listen while
[1:36:34] you're sitting here there are two forces
[1:36:36] there's an enemy that is telling you I
[1:36:38] have had up before there's an enemy that
[1:36:40] is telling you listen it's just another

[1:36:45] in services like this before you've had
[1:36:47] all of this before and you've seen no
[1:36:49] result and today is just going to be
[1:36:51] just as the same as it has always been
[1:36:53] now you've got a you've got a choice to
[1:36:55] make you can either listen to him and
[1:36:57] take his ideas and take his thoughts or
[1:36:59] you can say listen Satan you get behind
[1:37:02] me because this day is a different day

[1:37:31] word to you if you can only believe it

[1:37:35] word to you if you can only believe it

[1:37:41] us to take our position amen like the
[1:37:43] stars of Heaven I believe it's time for
[1:37:45] the bride to take her position as sons
[1:37:47] of God and Daughters of God Amen listen
[1:37:50] the stars of Heaven since they were put
[1:37:52] there they've stayed
[1:37:54] there are you with me they are doing
[1:37:57] exactly what they were told to do from
[1:37:59] do from the foundation of the world they
[1:38:01] just doing the what they they were told
[1:38:03] to do they there to doing the AAR amen
[1:38:06] because God put them there amen listen
[1:38:08] you can look at the Moon you see the
[1:38:10] moon when the moon was created the moon
[1:38:12] was said you know you're going to give
[1:38:13] light in the absence of the sun amen and
[1:38:17] the moon the Lord told the moon list the
[1:38:20] moon you you are going to be the one
[1:38:22] that is going to control the toy amen
[1:38:25] you're going to be the one that will
[1:38:26] control the toy of the waters amen when
[1:38:29] the water is coming coming too much Moon
[1:38:31] you can rise up and tell the water you
[1:38:34] go back you've come too far are you with
[1:38:36] me that was the authority that God Gave
[1:38:38] To The Moon And since God gave the Moon
[1:38:41] that Authority the Moon is constantly
[1:38:43] doing that he will never allow the water
[1:38:46] to rise above where is supposed to come
[1:38:48] now I want you to come to realization of
[1:38:50] something that brother Brandon said that
[1:38:52] the church is a type of the Moon amen
[1:38:55] that is Shinning the Lord in the
[1:38:58] darkness of our in the absence of the s
[1:39:00] o n are you with me this this morning
[1:39:03] the church is the type of the moon so if
[1:39:06] the moon in the natural was given the
[1:39:08] authority to push back the toy are you
[1:39:10] with me this morning if the moon was
[1:39:12] given the authority to push back the toy
[1:39:15] whenever the Toy Rose up and you are the
[1:39:17] moon today then you also have the same
[1:39:21] Authority are you with me this morning
[1:39:23] you also have the same authority to push
[1:39:26] back any toy that the enemy will try to
[1:39:28] bring against your home to push back any
[1:39:31] toy that the enemy will try to bring
[1:39:33] against your your life to bring against
[1:39:36] your family you have a right to push
[1:39:38] back that toy amen because you are the
[1:39:42] representation in the spiritual of the
[1:39:45] Moon in this day
[1:39:49] amen we're going to have to come in
[1:39:51] harmony
[1:39:54] because the mo is in harmony with
[1:39:56] God and the only way we're going to push
[1:39:59] back the toy is for us to come back in
[1:40:01] harmony with God Amen to come back in
[1:40:05] harmony with God now listen to this
[1:40:08] quote brother brandham says in the
[1:40:10] greatest battle ever fought he said and
[1:40:13] I W to God this
[1:40:15] morning that we will bring this to a
[1:40:18] real healing
[1:40:19] service now you say it's almost well
[1:40:22] they told me
[1:40:24] take so he blame the go standing back
[1:40:30] there but it said and I W to God this
[1:40:33] morning that we would bring the service
[1:40:35] to a real healing service is that that
[1:40:38] we could keep this part this part of the
[1:40:41] group that we are gaed under the roof
[1:40:44] this morning in such a Harmony that the
[1:40:47] holy spirit will place every member of
[1:40:50] the body that's here this morning in in
[1:40:53] such Harmony till there will be such a
[1:40:57] spontaneous healing of soul and body and
[1:41:02] I said if we'll just hold our
[1:41:08] possession listen I
[1:41:10] believe that that
[1:41:12] quote is not just the
[1:41:14] quot but I believe that that was the
[1:41:18] desire of God and I believe that that
[1:41:21] desire hasn't changed that if this
[1:41:23] church this morning this group that is
[1:41:25] gathered here this morning if we can
[1:41:28] come into that Harmony such Harmony amen
[1:41:32] such Harmony that that would be a
[1:41:35] spontaneous not someone working it up
[1:41:38] not someone forcings into us but a
[1:41:42] spontaneous a spontaneous healing of
[1:41:46] body and
[1:41:48] soul amen if we will hold our position
[1:41:53] and what is our position as Sons and
[1:41:55] Daughters of God knowing who we are to
[1:41:59] know that the authority has been given
[1:42:01] to us listen God is ready to back up
[1:42:05] your
[1:42:06] word he's ready to do it Amen brother
[1:42:10] Bram said we have to believe and he will
[1:42:14] perform
[1:42:15] it amen we have to believe and he will
[1:42:19] perform it now we believe that we're
[1:42:22] living in an age where we've been
[1:42:24] predestinated to come to that Harmony
[1:42:27] Amen to come to that Unity to that
[1:42:30] Oneness with God where there can be a
[1:42:32] spontaneous healing of body and soul
[1:42:36] amen and not only body and soul but
[1:42:39] there can be a spontaneous healing of
[1:42:41] scars a spontaneous healing of the
[1:42:44] broken homes a spontaneous healing of
[1:42:47] the broken heart a spontaneous healing
[1:42:50] amen of any Brokenness in our life
[1:42:54] amen I believe that there is where God
[1:42:57] is wanting to move Amen to bring a
[1:43:00] spontaneous healing listen there came a
[1:43:03] day amen that God told his
[1:43:06] disciples he said to us disciples going
[1:43:09] up to the open room amen going up to the
[1:43:13] open room and is that when you go up in
[1:43:15] there I am going to mess with you in
[1:43:17] there amen listen when they got into
[1:43:20] that that open room from what the
[1:43:23] scripture says in those 10 days they had
[1:43:26] not come into
[1:43:28] harmony are you with me in those 10 days
[1:43:31] they hadn't come into harmony but in
[1:43:34] those 10 days they were figuring 10 days
[1:43:36] in those 10 days I don't know because
[1:43:38] listen up there were Pharisees up there
[1:43:41] were Sadducees up there were were the
[1:43:44] disciples all kind of peoples were in
[1:43:47] there can you imagine Peter sitting in
[1:43:49] there with all these Pharisees
[1:43:53] you think they're just going to get
[1:43:54] along in the next five minutes they sure
[1:43:57] won't but there were some Pharisees that
[1:44:00] believed that Jesus was the Christ that
[1:44:02] Jesus was the Messiah there were 120
[1:44:05] people got it up there amen so there
[1:44:07] were more than the 12 disciples amen
[1:44:09] they were GA it up there waiting for the
[1:44:12] promise but before the promise could
[1:44:14] come the scripture said that they they
[1:44:17] came into what into one
[1:44:21] Accord are you with me they came into
[1:44:24] one Accord amen they came to a place
[1:44:27] where they began to say to themselves
[1:44:29] listen folks why are we here listen we
[1:44:32] forced for these last KN days we've done
[1:44:35] nothing but forcing and fighting and
[1:44:38] arguing about this and the other but
[1:44:40] listen what is the reason why we are
[1:44:43] here are we here to force or are we here
[1:44:46] to receive the promise and I believe
[1:44:49] that the people the 120 people in there
[1:44:51] as they begin to hear right on don't
[1:44:53] know who was the spokesman but as they
[1:44:55] begin to hear one of these disciples or
[1:44:57] whoever was that stood up and said it's
[1:44:59] time to come into the reason why we are
[1:45:03] here it is time for us to come into
[1:45:06] Unity of Mind in receiving the the what
[1:45:10] we have been promised listen and I
[1:45:12] believe there is where the bride is to
[1:45:14] come to amen where we GA it together in
[1:45:17] a service listen we don't just come
[1:45:19] together to say well it's a Sunday
[1:45:21] morning and I ought to go to church amen
[1:45:23] or it's a Sunday morning and we ought to
[1:45:25] be here and but if we can come into that
[1:45:28] Accord into that Unity into that Harmony
[1:45:33] Amen to say you know what we've come
[1:45:35] here to receive the promise to say I've
[1:45:39] come into the service not to leave the
[1:45:41] same I've come into the the service to
[1:45:44] claim what God has promised to me amen
[1:45:48] listen that is how those people in the
[1:45:50] upper room there is where they had to
[1:45:52] come to to a place where the promise
[1:45:55] became a reality to a place where the
[1:45:57] promise became the most important thing
[1:46:00] nothing else mattered anymore amen
[1:46:04] nothing else mattered anymore it didn't
[1:46:06] matter what they were going to do
[1:46:07] tomorrow nothing else mattered all that
[1:46:09] mattered is that in this moment we are
[1:46:12] here to receive the promise amen we are
[1:46:15] here to receive the promise let me say
[1:46:17] this church if this PE if this group of
[1:46:19] people that we are gued here this
[1:46:21] morning if we can come into that that
[1:46:23] same Unity into that same one Accord
[1:46:25] brother Bram said there are two Powers
[1:46:27] right now that are trying to gain the
[1:46:29] preeminence there are two powers that
[1:46:31] are trying to get a hold of your mind
[1:46:34] one power that is trying to get you to
[1:46:36] doubt another power that is trying to
[1:46:38] get you to believe and if this morning
[1:46:41] we can come to a place where we get a
[1:46:43] hold of the power of God that is trying
[1:46:45] to get us to believe amen if we get a
[1:46:48] hold of that faith that God has Desiring
[1:46:51] to use to bring us to receive the
[1:46:54] promise listen we will see a spontaneous
[1:46:58] healing listen I believe the words of
[1:47:00] the message I believe the words of God
[1:47:03] listen and if the prophet said it I
[1:47:05] believe it wasn't just the prophet but I
[1:47:07] believe it was God that was speaking it
[1:47:10] amen and if he was speaking it and if he
[1:47:12] was
[1:47:13] saying that if we come into unity and
[1:47:16] one Accord that there can be a
[1:47:18] spontaneous
[1:47:19] healing I believe it can happen
[1:47:23] or you believe it can happen listen it
[1:47:26] is not
[1:47:27] impossible God is willing to do
[1:47:30] it God is willing to do
[1:47:33] it but we are the ones that needs to
[1:47:35] come into that Harmon we are the ones
[1:47:37] that needs to come into thy own accord
[1:47:40] and into thy Unity to say listen we are
[1:47:43] here to receive the promise no matter
[1:47:45] what you were going through no matter
[1:47:46] what the battle is no matter how the
[1:47:48] home is looking at looking like you can
[1:47:50] sit here this morning and say
[1:47:53] I am living here believing that
[1:47:56] something is going to
[1:47:59] change because listen when you come to
[1:48:01] the H of God you never going to live the
[1:48:04] same you're going to either live better
[1:48:07] than you can man or you're going to live
[1:48:09] worse than you care
[1:48:10] man and that is going to depend which
[1:48:13] spirit that is going to depend which
[1:48:15] anointing which that is going to depend
[1:48:17] which power you're going to allow you to
[1:48:18] control you this
[1:48:21] morning you with me morning listen I
[1:48:25] believe that God is ready to do it
[1:48:28] listen I don't know why God changed my
[1:48:29] service last night but I believe he's
[1:48:32] got a purpose for it are you with me
[1:48:34] this morning I believe he's got a
[1:48:36] purpose for it because this was
[1:48:38] absolutely not the direction we were
[1:48:40] going to go this morning but last night
[1:48:43] the Lord said no we changing that we're
[1:48:45] changing
[1:48:47] gears because he had you on his
[1:48:50] mind he had you on his mind
[1:48:54] and what he had to say to you this
[1:48:55] morning is that if you will come into
[1:48:57] thy Unity if you will come into thy one
[1:49:00] Accord if you allow to that power of God
[1:49:02] to get a hold of you he's ready to
[1:49:05] perform his word he's ready to perform
[1:49:08] the miraculous listen we were in a
[1:49:10] meeting bab three weeks ago we were in a
[1:49:13] meeting in in in

[1:49:19] second service we were taken and and and
[1:49:23] and and there was a motor in the in the
[1:49:24] service amen there was a motor in the
[1:49:26] service and we were speaking along these
[1:49:28] lines amen of God being ready to perform
[1:49:32] his word of we that the same thought
[1:49:35] that if we were to come to a place where
[1:49:37] we receive the power of God and we we
[1:49:39] allow the power of God to control us
[1:49:41] that God is ready to perform his word
[1:49:43] and there was a motor that was sitting
[1:49:44] in the meeting amen now this m has had
[1:49:47] her daughter her daughter has been
[1:49:49] Wayward for 15 years for 15 years her
[1:49:53] daughter has been living in the world

[1:50:06] everything she could have for 15 years
[1:50:08] she was living outside of the world
[1:50:10] indeed God started to deal with her but
[1:50:12] she still didn't want to have anything
[1:50:13] to do with church but in that service as
[1:50:17] this same quote was being read as the
[1:50:19] spirit of God began to move in that
[1:50:21] service that woman begin to take God at
[1:50:23] his word she wasn't taking me at my word
[1:50:26] she was taking God at his word to say if

[1:50:32] want to step in it and I want to declare
[1:50:34] my claim and in that service that woman

[1:52:17] the same yesterday today and
[1:52:20] forever he hasn't changed
[1:52:23] he hasn't
[1:52:25] changed brother pram continuing to say
[1:52:28] if this church right now could be put
[1:52:31] together and knitted together with such
[1:52:35] that every person would be in one
[1:52:40] Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt
[1:52:45] anywhere are you with me this
[1:52:48] morning if we can come to a place in one
[1:52:52] Accord
[1:52:53] with not one shadow of death
[1:53:00] anywhere brother Bram says there would
[1:53:03] be there would not be a feeble person in
[1:53:08] our m in another five
[1:53:15] minutes listen we can read that
[1:53:18] quote and we can say well maybe one day
[1:53:23] maybe one day maybe one day one day it
[1:53:27] will happen but what about right
[1:53:30] now what about right now what about this
[1:53:35] service what about this moment is there
[1:53:38] anything too hard for the
[1:53:40] Lord is there anything too hard for the
[1:53:43] Lord what about this hour what about
[1:53:46] this
[1:53:48] moment we've always put it off we've
[1:53:52] always put it
[1:53:53] off but what to be
[1:53:55] now he said there wouldn't be one Fe
[1:53:58] person in the next 4
[1:54:00] minutes is that if there there would be
[1:54:03] nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but
[1:54:06] what would receive it if you could just
[1:54:09] get the if you just if you could just
[1:54:11] get that certain T fixed and B began to
[1:54:15] talk about it is that now there is where
[1:54:18] the battle begins right in your mind
[1:54:26] point there is where the battle
[1:54:29] begins
[1:54:31] amen there is where the battle begins
[1:54:34] the Battle of trying to break the
[1:54:38] unity the Battle of doubt the Battle of
[1:54:44] fear well listen always believe that God
[1:54:46] is more than able this morning God is
[1:54:49] more than able this morning amen
[1:54:53] God is more than able this
[1:54:56] morning brother brandom continuing to
[1:54:58] say here he said you can have little
[1:55:02] consciences and little feelings and
[1:55:05] little sensation all these things that
[1:55:08] has nothing to do with it listen you can
[1:55:12] be sitting here having some Sensations
[1:55:14] some feelings and thinking but what
[1:55:16] about that and what about this and can
[1:55:18] this really
[1:55:20] be could it really be this morning
[1:55:22] moment but brandham says that has
[1:55:24] nothing to do with
[1:55:27] it he said that's just little Sensations
[1:55:30] and tense is said but when it comes to
[1:55:32] reality is that your mind opens it up is
[1:55:37] that your mind either accepts it or
[1:55:41] rejects
[1:55:43] it he said that's it friends is said God
[1:55:48] let none he said God let none of them
[1:55:50] mes it's your mind that opens up the
[1:55:53] door or closes the door and listens to
[1:55:57] your consent listens to your memory
[1:56:00] listens to your affection he said but
[1:56:02] when your mind closes itself to these
[1:56:06] things and what are these things the
[1:56:08] little feelings and the doubt and the
[1:56:11] fears is that when your mind closes
[1:56:14] itself to these things and let God the
[1:56:17] spirit of his word come in is that it
[1:56:21] blows the rest of the stove out he said
[1:56:25] every doubt is gone he said every fear
[1:56:28] is gone is that every sensation of Doubt
[1:56:31] is gone is that every feeling is gone is
[1:56:34] that there is nothing standing there but
[1:56:37] the word of God and it say Satan cannot
[1:56:40] battle against
[1:56:45] that when you push everything
[1:56:49] eight when your mind rejects everything
[1:56:52] every day rejects every fear and puts
[1:56:56] the word there to say I am believ in the
[1:56:58] word of God he says Satan cannot battle
[1:57:04] that Satan cannot battle that listen
[1:57:09] Church God's confidence is not in your
[1:57:12] fresh God's confidence is not in your
[1:57:16] sensation God's confidence is not in
[1:57:18] your feelings God's confidence is in the
[1:57:21] seed that is put on the inside of
[1:57:23] you that is what is coming to
[1:57:27] Rapture and that seed is going to get a
[1:57:29] new
[1:57:30] body amen that seed is going to get a
[1:57:33] new body so God's confidence is not in
[1:57:36] your body God's confidence is not in the
[1:57:38] mistakes that you're going to make but
[1:57:40] God's confidence is in the seed that is
[1:57:43] on the inside of you he's got confidence
[1:57:45] that that seed has the power to produce
[1:57:48] what the word says that's where his
[1:57:50] confidence is at
[1:57:54] but many times we put our confidence in
[1:57:56] our flesh we put our confidence in our
[1:57:59] feelings and and our doubts and and the
[1:58:01] wrong things we made and the wrong
[1:58:02] things we did that's where our
[1:58:04] confidence always go to but there's not
[1:58:06] where God's confidence is at his
[1:58:09] confidence is in the seed amen his
[1:58:11] confidence is in the
[1:58:13] seed and see the reason why Satan is
[1:58:16] trying to get into our mind is because
[1:58:19] Satan wants us to look at the
[1:58:20] circumstance
