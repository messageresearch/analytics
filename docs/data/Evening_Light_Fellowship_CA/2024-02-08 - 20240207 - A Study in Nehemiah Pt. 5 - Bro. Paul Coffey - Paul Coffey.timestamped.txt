[37:34] Father Lord we're just thankful for this
[37:36] time together tonight we're just
[37:38] thankful Lord for your presence we're
[37:40] thankful Lord that you abide by that
[37:42] promise that even though that there are
[37:44] only two or three Lord you'll be in the
[37:46] midst father and you've proven that over
[37:48] and over lord it doesn't matter about
[37:49] the amount of people lord it's just all
[37:51] that matters is that you're here with us
[37:53] so we're just praying father may you
[37:55] just be pleased tonight with our worship
[37:58] Lord and Lord may we just hear from you
[38:01] tonight may you just completely help me
[38:03] Lord to get out of your way Lord so you
[38:05] can just speak clearly to the people may
[38:07] you just clear our hearts Lord and our
[38:09] minds you anoint our hearts Lord to hear
[38:12] what is needed to be heard Lord or
[38:16] without you this is all in vain and
[38:18] we're just praying father Lord may it
[38:20] just be edifying for all of us here
[38:21] myself included and we're just praying
[38:24] Lord for all the needs and those that
[38:25] need to touch from you those who are
[38:27] away Lord we pray your grace to them we
[38:28] ask these things in the name of Jesus
[38:30] Christ
[38:32] amen all right let's turn to Psalm 1
[38:36] Psalm 1 we'll begin with the first
[38:39] verse small crowd tonight we're one more
[38:43] than the Ephesian
[38:44] church
[38:47] tonight so but thank the Lord does not
[38:51] matter how many people are here as long
[38:54] as people are listening and pulling so
[38:57] the bird may be heavier on your
[38:58] shoulders tonight but please listen and
[39:02] pull uh verse one blessed is the man
[39:06] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[39:07] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[39:09] Sinners nor sth in the seed of the
[39:12] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[39:14] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[39:16] meditate day and night and he shall be
[39:18] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[39:19] water that bringeth forth his his fruit
[39:21] in his season his Leaf also shall not
[39:24] wither and whatsoever he doth shall
[39:26] prosper
[39:27] the ungodly are not so but are like the
[39:29] chaff which the wind driveth away
[39:32] therefore the UNG ungodly shall not
[39:33] stand in the in the Judgment nor sinners
[39:35] in the congregation of the righteous for
[39:37] the Lord knoweth the way of the
[39:39] righteous but the way of the ungodly
[39:40] Shall Perish you may have your
[39:45] seats okay so tonight is part five in
[39:49] our study and we are finally talking
[39:51] about Nehemiah tonight it's been a long
[39:53] wait it's been a long journey okay but
[39:56] the
[39:57] foundation was needed it was worth
[40:00] it and it gives us a greater
[40:02] appreciation of everything that we are
[40:05] going to discuss here with Nehemiah I do
[40:08] not know how long it will take to go
[40:10] through Nehemiah I never know how long a
[40:13] series will ever take the girls can
[40:15] attest to that David took almost two
[40:18] years Abraham was how long almost a year
[40:21] and a half so 13 chapters can stretch a
[40:25] long way if you go by verse by verse but
[40:28] the beauty of it is that you you kind of
[40:31] squeeze all the blood from the turnip
[40:33] and every bit of goodness that you can
[40:34] get out of it you get out of it and I
[40:36] don't think the girls will ever forget
[40:39] anything about Saul and David forever
[40:42] now way I but you you get it's just
[40:45] there is something about just chewing it
[40:46] and chewing it and chewing it and you
[40:48] get a lot of goodness from it so I'm
[40:51] personally enjoying studying Nehemiah
[40:53] there's a lot that Nehemiah reminds me
[40:55] of this age
[40:57] and uh hopefully you'll be blessed by
[41:01] it I'm not going to be labor this
[41:03] because we've been through it a million
[41:04] times but last last time we talked about
[41:07] Ezra and how he came in a situation
[41:10] where again the children of Israel were
[41:12] kind of going off the rails going the
[41:14] same direction that they got judged for
[41:16] God brings a man a praying man a
[41:19] descendant of Phineas and he does
[41:21] essentially the same Deeds as Phineas um
[41:24] and what's interesting is that studying
[41:26] for this I stumbled across why Phineas
[41:29] had to do what he did and the Bible
[41:32] explicitly states that if someone is
[41:35] caught in the act of idolatry they are
[41:37] to be taken out and stoned
[41:40] immediately so that's essentially why
[41:42] Phineas was blessed in what he did it
[41:44] seemed extreme for everyone but there's
[41:48] a uh there's a reason why he did it and
[41:51] God blessed him for it because he
[41:52] followed the word to the letter and that
[41:55] was God's requirement for that sin and
[41:58] if he didn't do what he did they would
[42:01] have been judged the people would have
[42:02] been judged and you know ultimately it
[42:05] was atonement for the people so there's
[42:08] always a reason for Why God does things
[42:11] and we got to trust that even though
[42:13] it's it's like all those times he told
[42:15] David and Saul you got to kill everyone
[42:18] because at that time it's it's a it's an
[42:21] eye for an eye it's a tooth for a tooth
[42:23] and there's no Grace and during that
[42:26] time there's no blood buffer around the
[42:28] earth so when God sees sin it gets
[42:30] judged and that's why he always had to
[42:33] tell the the children of Israel everyone
[42:36] goes because little pagans turn into big
[42:39] pagans big pagans invade the land of
[42:42] Israel so there's always a reason for
[42:44] Why God does that does those things and
[42:46] you know the type for us spiritually is
[42:48] that little sins turn to big sins so all
[42:51] right so tonight we're talking about
[42:52] Nehemiah and during this whole process
[42:55] of building this Foundation it's
[42:58] understanding there's things that
[42:59] Nehemiah does that again are similar to
[43:01] what we just talked about they seem
[43:03] extreme they seem harsh but there's a
[43:05] reason for why Nehemiah does it so in
[43:09] terms of the the broad shokes of what we
[43:10] talked about we learned that there
[43:12] there's an original uh Commandment that
[43:14] Moses gives about idolatry and idolatry
[43:17] is you know there's a reason why you
[43:19] know the the first two Commandments are
[43:22] so focused on that because it's the most
[43:23] important thing you know Thou shalt love
[43:25] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[43:27] with all thy soul and with all thy might
[43:28] period no others and Moses when he was
[43:32] giving the word to to the children of
[43:35] Israel you have the initial bit in
[43:37] Exodus but in Deuteronomy is right
[43:39] before the going into land and he's
[43:41] repeating all this stuff and saying
[43:42] there's a ble Deuteronomy is a is is a
[43:45] book of blessings and curses blessings
[43:48] if you follow curses if you
[43:50] don't and they're going into the land
[43:53] which is the type of the Holy Ghost and
[43:54] he's saying if you do this you you live
[43:56] if you don't do it you die it may not be
[43:58] the same circumstances but it's the same
[44:01] seriousness that we deal with today if
[44:04] you don't follow the message of the hour
[44:06] it's a curse unto you and you see it
[44:09] with people who leave when they're in
[44:11] they may not be even filled with the
[44:12] Holy Ghost but they're still blessed
[44:14] because you're in the presence you're in
[44:16] that atmosphere of life and there's
[44:18] there the the what's what's the U the
[44:22] type of the the rainfalls on the just
[44:24] and the unjust and they both rejoice and
[44:27] there's a blessing that comes with it
[44:28] but once you get out of that
[44:30] atmosphere you don't people don't
[44:33] realize how much secondary blessings
[44:36] just comes from being in that
[44:38] atmosphere
[44:39] so in terms of what uh Moses discusses
[44:43] there he's saying it's very clear you
[44:45] have a path of life and you have a path
[44:47] of death and it's your
[44:49] choice and what's interesting is that he
[44:51] there there's specific things he talks
[44:54] to the people but he also talks to the
[44:55] the leaders and we discussed this W with
[44:59] David there was three things that a king
[45:02] of Israel was not supposed to do that
[45:04] Moses said and the first one was he
[45:06] wasn't supposed to collect unto himself
[45:07] wealth the second thing is that he
[45:09] wasn't supposed to collect unto himself
[45:11] chariots and horses and thirdly not to
[45:14] collect un unto himself
[45:17] wives okay those are the three things
[45:19] that Moses says do not do that okay
[45:23] wealth is an obvious reason for why and
[45:26] you saw it with Hezekiah Hezekiah
[45:27] collected unto himself and he got to the
[45:29] point where he shows the Babylonians all
[45:32] the wealth that he gathered and
[45:35] literally Isaiah comes to him everything
[45:36] that you've shown him will be taken away
[45:38] by these same men and it happened may
[45:40] not be it didn't happen in hezekiah's
[45:42] lifetime but it happened to his children
[45:45] and then in terms of Chariots and and
[45:47] all those things anytime Israel went
[45:49] down to and allied with Egypt during the
[45:52] period of the Kings they always paid for
[45:54] it because they're they're leaning on
[45:56] the arm of Flesh Jehovah wants to be the
[46:00] protector of his children and anytime
[46:02] you rely on the arm of Flesh you get in
[46:04] trouble and then finally when it came to
[46:06] the
[46:07] women what's interesting is that David
[46:10] actually starts the
[46:13] slide David broke the rule of gathering
[46:16] unto himself wives and the difference is
[46:20] that David starts off with good Godly
[46:24] women and God allowed it and it was a
[46:27] type of a multi-member bride okay but
[46:30] Solomon like the Next Generation takes
[46:32] it a step further and like anything what
[46:35] one generation
[46:37] tolerates the Next Generation Embraces
[46:40] and you see it you see the old gods you
[46:43] know I can name a bunch of things in
[46:45] terms of things are coming back and what
[46:48] one generation tolerates the Next
[46:50] Generation Embraces and you look with
[46:53] David it was nice and good good Godly
[46:55] women but Solomon takes it a step
[46:59] further right Solomon takes it a step
[47:04] further and it starts the slide okay and
[47:10] he
[47:10] breaks what the the the third thing that
[47:13] Moses said but he also breaks the
[47:15] Commandment of not following the gods of
[47:17] Canaan and also not into Maring with the
[47:20] Pagan women and we you know we've talked
[47:22] about a lot where that started the
[47:25] slaughter into idolatry and Solon goes
[47:28] from the
[47:30] person who is so blessed that the actual
[47:32] shik Glory comes down and so engulfs the
[47:36] temple that the priests have to stop
[47:38] speaking and worshiping because the
[47:40] cloud was so thick to a person offering
[47:44] food to an
[47:46] idol because he intermarried that that
[47:49] was a fall that Solomon did and there's
[47:52] Grace for Solomon you know it's kind of
[47:54] like Saul like they just get through the
[47:57] skin of their teeth they'll be over
[47:58] there but it's just by the skin of the
[48:01] teeth so Moses said if they obey that
[48:03] commandment they would be blessed and if
[48:06] they failed to obey they would be cursed
[48:08] and we saw that that the moment that
[48:10] that that commandment is disobeyed sin
[48:13] enters into the kingdom and it just
[48:15] starts breaking down everything the
[48:17] kingdom gets divided into two idolatry
[48:20] is widespread especially when Ahab and
[48:23] Jezebel come on the scene it explodes
[48:27] the amount of deprivation that happens
[48:29] just gets worse and worse and worse God
[48:31] has to judge
[48:32] them and because of that God has to
[48:36] judge it if they don't repent and they
[48:39] sure had plenty of opportunities to
[48:42] repent you think about all the prophets
[48:44] you had Joel you had Amos you had
[48:45] Obadiah you had habac you had Micah you
[48:49] had Zephaniah Zachariah hegi you had
[48:53] Jeremiah you had Isaiah Ezekiel all
[48:56] these men are giving opportunities for
[48:58] the children to repent and they don't so
[49:00] God cannot be blamed for what happened
[49:03] to them so we all know that everything
[49:05] leads to this where they get robbed of
[49:07] their independence they no longer have
[49:11] Independence up until the time that the
[49:14] Greeks are um defeated by the by the
[49:17] macbes and that's only always brief 100y
[49:19] year period and then the Romans crush
[49:21] them okay so they never really regained
[49:23] their independence only for a very short
[49:25] period
[49:27] the uh glorious Kingdom of Solomon was
[49:31] renowned in the land for all the riches
[49:33] and God blessed him and abundantly above
[49:34] and beyond anything he could ever hope
[49:36] or imagine and it all got taken
[49:39] away the 10 kingdoms that or the 10
[49:43] tribes of Israel are so destroyed that
[49:47] they're dispersed to the four king four
[49:49] corners of the earth okay and really the
[49:52] restoration only really happens to the
[49:54] tribes of benjam and Judah because of
[49:57] how sold out to idolatry those 10 tribes
[50:00] were Jerusalem was burned to the ground
[50:02] as we as we can see here the temple was
[50:04] burned and destroyed the Ark of the
[50:06] Covenant was lost
[50:07] forever um which was huge because that
[50:11] was literally the the where the mercy
[50:13] seat was where atonement was and they
[50:16] lost that forever so it just the wages
[50:19] of sin is death and they lured that in
[50:22] Spades so but fortunately and thank God
[50:26] that this is not the end this is not the
[50:28] end of the story this is not the period
[50:30] this is the bottom of the
[50:32] barrel okay and because Israel did not
[50:36] learn and they did not heed they had to
[50:39] learn what the bottom of the barrel
[50:40] looked like but eventually they learned
[50:42] to appreciate what they what they
[50:44] lost okay because we saw in the Psalms
[50:47] as they were leaving Jerusalem they wept
[50:51] bitterly by the Rivers of Babylon we
[50:53] wept so they they learned unfortunately
[50:57] too late of what they had but thankfully
[51:00] God is a god of restoration and he would
[51:03] restore and we saw that through through
[51:07] men like zeruel and men like Ezra and
[51:09] Cyrus the Great that eventually it would
[51:12] become a city restored and built up like
[51:14] this so this is where we're heading is
[51:16] the city of Jerusalem totally restored
[51:19] totally protected totally
[51:22] blessed okay and eventually and the
[51:25] reason why God had to restore everything
[51:27] why he had to get Israel positioned
[51:30] place for the Messiah to come back and
[51:33] Messiah had to be clean or the the the
[51:35] kingdom had to be clean in order for the
[51:36] Messiah to come
[51:39] back okay so uh that is our quick review
[51:44] and that was our foundation that we've
[51:45] been building up over the last four uh
[51:48] Services four lessons rather and it's to
[51:52] show that everything in Nehemiah
[51:57] the burden that Nehemiah has is all
[51:59] because of what he learned from his
[52:02] fathers of what they
[52:03] lost and how important it was to stick
[52:08] to the law of Moses because the law of
[52:10] Moses for them is like the the what is
[52:16] the um preaching of the Apostle Paul for
[52:18] us everything that brother brandom
[52:20] taught is pointing back to what Paul
[52:22] preached when he went over on the other
[52:23] the curtain of time he said I only
[52:25] preach what Paul preached and everyone
[52:27] there screamed we're counting on that so
[52:30] for us everything that Paul preached is
[52:33] what we're we're we're aiming for is
[52:35] that first church God wants to restore
[52:38] back to that to that Original Seed in
[52:42] order before the Rapture can come and we
[52:43] got to aim for
[52:45] that so uh or before I get into that so
[52:48] Nehemiah like I talked before is the
[52:50] last uh technically the historical book
[52:53] in the Bible it's right before uh really
[52:56] the the the gospels after Nehemiah you
[53:00] have the Greeks defeating Persia as we
[53:03] see in um Daniel's Visions the Greeks
[53:06] get defeated by the M macbes then Rome
[53:10] conquers them and they're the ones in
[53:13] place from then all time it it never
[53:16] changes it goes from P Pagan Rome to
[53:18] Papa Rome Herod the Great then comes on
[53:21] the throne as a essentially a vassel uh
[53:24] for the Romans and he's just a puppet
[53:26] ruler and he's the one that actually um
[53:30] renovates zerubbabel's Temple and makes
[53:32] it what it was during Jesus time so it
[53:35] they he built out like the the plaza
[53:38] around the temple and made it a bit
[53:40] bigger and all that but the the the main
[53:43] core Temple was what it was with uh
[53:47] zerubabel and then finally the uh we we
[53:50] see the New Testament begin so that that
[53:52] is like a 400e period from when Nehemiah
[53:56] dies when we see the the first bits of
[53:59] the gospels being
[54:01] written okay so not much unfortunately
[54:04] is known about nehemiah's background uh
[54:06] upbringing or story or whatever when we
[54:09] come on to him we we see him where he
[54:11] was and we don't get to see it's like
[54:14] David like David's great because you can
[54:16] see when he before the prophet came to
[54:19] him so he you see him you know when he's
[54:22] not respected and he's not in any
[54:24] position of authority and he's not
[54:26] someone who who's a great man so you get
[54:29] to see the whole EV evolution of of
[54:32] David but with Nehemiah you kind of get
[54:34] see him when he's grown and he's
[54:35] established and all that stuff but
[54:38] that's okay so Nehemiah is not a royal
[54:42] okay zerubabel was was the prince
[54:45] zurubabel was was of the lineage of
[54:47] David he he if if if uh Babylon did not
[54:50] conquer uh Judah zuru probably would
[54:54] have been King okay okay and you look at
[54:57] Ezra Ezra is a prophet and you know God
[55:00] venerates His prophets but Nehemiah is a
[55:02] different sort he's not a king he's not
[55:04] a prince he's not a royal he's not a
[55:06] prophet he's not a son of a prophet he's
[55:07] not even a priest not a scribe not
[55:10] anything he's just a regular
[55:13] believer okay and the beauty about
[55:16] Nehemiah is that God used him in such a
[55:19] degree zerubabel was a starter okay he
[55:22] started the work but God needed a
[55:24] certain C personality to finish it and
[55:29] you see it God has different
[55:31] personalities and people for different
[55:33] positions for different reasons not
[55:35] everyone's a starter okay I can't start
[55:38] nothing if if if you give me a blank
[55:41] page and said you need to start from
[55:43] scratch with something I will be totally
[55:44] lost but if you give me something that's
[55:48] all right this is what needs to be done
[55:50] this is the end goal of what we need to
[55:51] do I can do to to my heart's content
[55:54] whereas Joe
[55:55] Joe is a great blank page person dad's a
[55:58] great blank page person I could never do
[56:01] it but God has different gifts different
[56:04] personalities different
[56:06] trainings for different reasons okay and
[56:11] it's it's where it's learning to work
[56:13] together in those gifts where Harmony
[56:16] starts to happen and where Harmony
[56:19] is growth can happen Okay when
[56:22] everything is working together is when
[56:24] we can start growing
[56:27] so Nehemiah was was was prepared and
[56:31] unfortunately we don't see all that
[56:33] training we don't see any of the
[56:35] training but he was obviously trained
[56:37] Because by the time you get to Nehemiah
[56:38] he's a mature established believer and
[56:41] there's not much you can touch on on
[56:43] neem nehemiah's life me and Dad were
[56:45] talking about it there's literally like
[56:47] there's hardly anything with neemi where
[56:49] you can say uh that that was wrong so he
[56:52] he's someone who who's just
[56:55] he was a prayer Warrior he he knew how
[56:58] to wait he knew how to wait for that hat
[57:03] to be in the right place in order to go
[57:06] and that's a sound of maturity that's a
[57:07] that's a sound of someone who who's
[57:09] whose ear is tuned to the voice of God
[57:13] because someone who is immature doesn't
[57:16] doesn't hasn't learned how to lean they
[57:19] haven't learned how to wait for the
[57:21] voice of God of like no no this is not
[57:23] the time yet your desire is good but you
[57:25] need to wait it's not the right time as
[57:27] some someone who's established knows
[57:29] when to wait for the right timing you
[57:32] may be the right right person but is at
[57:33] the right time and that that that takes
[57:36] experience that takes suffering to be
[57:39] able to learn that okay it's not a gift
[57:43] that stuff ain't a gift that like that
[57:45] that experience is not just laid on you
[57:48] from birth you have to suffer to to gain
[57:50] experience and this is what you see with
[57:52] Nehemiah it's someone who's obviously VI
[57:55] ly gone through the paces of learning
[57:58] the voice of
[58:00] Jehovah so and really that that's the
[58:03] whole aim of this study is is to show
[58:05] that it's not just the prophet of the
[58:08] age that God used it's not just you know
[58:13] brother Perry green or brother Lonnie
[58:14] Jenkins that God used or the fivefold
[58:16] ministry today God is wanting to use
[58:19] each and every member of the Body for a
[58:22] use and it's not just the fivefold
[58:24] ministry that is going to do these great
[58:26] works these signs shall follow them that
[58:30] believe who is them them is you them is
[58:35] me and the signs are not always the same
[58:38] we always put signs as Miracles but
[58:40] signs is just evidence what's evidence
[58:43] the fruits of the spirit it's it's the
[58:45] way you walk it's the way you talk it's
[58:47] a sign and it's an Evidence of who you
[58:50] are and and and I think you sent this to
[58:54] me about brother Lonnie used to say that
[58:57] you want to talk to the person who's
[59:00] experienced the most amount of
[59:02] Supernatural go talk to the
[59:04] housewife all the those little moments
[59:07] where they're they're in the house and
[59:09] they lost something they pray and
[59:11] somehow appears or they're dealing with
[59:13] a child and God touches them and they're
[59:16] praying for their Lost Child and God
[59:18] brings them back it's it's it's those
[59:21] people who are working silently in the
[59:24] background that more often than not God
[59:26] is using the most cuz you look at it
[59:29] motherhood is the back for said is the
[59:31] backbone of the nation you break
[59:33] motherhood you break the nation and
[59:34] we've seen it today and it's just you
[59:36] look at all these Great Men of all the
[59:40] ages you point back to them it's a great
[59:42] mother behind them you look at
[59:45] Samuel you got Hannah praying one of the
[59:49] greatest prayers of the Bible and that
[59:52] woman who has yearned for years to have
[59:54] a
[59:57] child and
[59:59] she she yearns and she goes to God and
[1:00:02] she asked him
[1:00:04] please if you can just give me a child
[1:00:06] I'll give him right back to
[1:00:08] you and from that the moment that child
[1:00:11] is born and is is of age that can go to
[1:00:14] the temple she gives him back to the
[1:00:15] Lord and God says here's all the kids
[1:00:18] you
[1:00:19] want and that child goes on and is the
[1:00:22] greatest Prophet since Moses cuz he gets
[1:00:25] he gets Israel back in line for Who
[1:00:29] David who's going to be the line of to
[1:00:32] the Messiah without without Samuel
[1:00:35] there's no David and it's because of
[1:00:37] that one woman you look at Yosh without
[1:00:40] Yosh there's no
[1:00:42] Moses without Jesus without Mary there's
[1:00:45] no Jesus that poor 15-year-old girl
[1:00:49] experiencing shame like no 15-year-old
[1:00:52] girl should ever experience but she for
[1:00:55] because she
[1:00:56] believed she believed that the
[1:00:58] impossible was happening you don't know
[1:01:00] if she even knew the scripture that a
[1:01:02] verion shall conceive what she said was
[1:01:04] insane any logical person says you're
[1:01:07] insane and yet it was true and without
[1:01:10] her there's no gospel do we venerate her
[1:01:13] like the Catholic Church does no but we
[1:01:15] honor
[1:01:17] her I believe a huge portion of way of
[1:01:19] heaven was was a son to
[1:01:23] Mary what she experienced was she
[1:01:25] perfect no by no means but it's these
[1:01:29] mothers these often ignored
[1:01:32] mothers it's the
[1:01:34] backbone and you have no idea how
[1:01:36] important it is because almost every
[1:01:38] great man was because of a great mother
[1:01:39] you look at Charles and John Wesley she
[1:01:42] had how many kids 13 kids or whatever
[1:01:45] and she would set aside time every day
[1:01:47] to teach those children about
[1:01:52] Christ so
[1:01:55] the whole point of the study is that God
[1:01:57] is wanting each and every person to be
[1:02:00] enabled okay it's not just because you
[1:02:03] look you look at what what the spirit of
[1:02:05] Christ has been battling for 2,000 years
[1:02:07] it's the spirit of nicoladis it's the
[1:02:09] spirit of balum and what's the spirit of
[1:02:11] nicoladis nicoladis it's conquer the
[1:02:15] lady it's to remove the lady from the
[1:02:19] equation and what's tied to the spirit
[1:02:21] of nicoladis is the is the doctrine of
[1:02:23] the trinity
[1:02:25] because what the Trinity does is that it
[1:02:27] removes God in phases in vessels to God
[1:02:33] just in three three people it takes away
[1:02:36] a personal God working in a people it
[1:02:39] completely robs people of the identity
[1:02:41] it puts God up in heaven and we're just
[1:02:44] Sinners saved by grace no it's God
[1:02:47] changing deities changing phases and
[1:02:50] it's God in Me therefore as sacriligious
[1:02:54] as it sounds I am
[1:02:56] God because Christ said it you are many
[1:03:00] gods so between the Trinity and the
[1:03:03] spirit of n nicoladis it completely
[1:03:06] takes a it it totally breaks the power
[1:03:11] of the church denying the power of
[1:03:12] thereof because it says it's not God in
[1:03:15] you and the power is only to the
[1:03:21] priesthood so that's what you see today
[1:03:25] in in the in the modern church it's a a
[1:03:27] a church with no
[1:03:29] teeth they're
[1:03:31] powerless I I I was listening to a song
[1:03:34] today and you look at the way they're
[1:03:37] worshiping it it's just like turn it off
[1:03:41] because it was ridiculous the way they
[1:03:43] were getting on it was just this is not
[1:03:46] even emotion this is weird and that's
[1:03:50] and that's what they call light
[1:03:51] now what are you Conjuring and that's
[1:03:54] why you got to be careful listening to
[1:03:56] some of that stuff because just they're
[1:03:57] tabbing into something that's strange
[1:03:59] it's strange fire some of it's fine but
[1:04:02] a lot of it is Strange
[1:04:04] Fire so that's what God is is is has
[1:04:07] that's what God is restoring to us today
[1:04:10] is that there's a a people who are
[1:04:13] vessels for Christ to work
[1:04:16] through and it's not just the ministry
[1:04:19] thank God for the Tim puits thank God
[1:04:20] for the Donnie Reagan but it's the
[1:04:23] brother Dale's the Brother Davis the
[1:04:24] sister Brenda that God is wanting to
[1:04:26] work through as well in equal
[1:04:30] measure
[1:04:31] because it's going to be a strong
[1:04:35] powerful Victorious bride at the end we
[1:04:38] are not it you because the type is
[1:04:42] Israel in uh
[1:04:44] Canaan other than that one slip up with
[1:04:48] uh
[1:04:49] uh aen other than that one slip up they
[1:04:54] are
[1:04:57] unbeatable that's who brother bandam
[1:04:59] said we were Ephesians types Joshua we
[1:05:03] will be
[1:05:06] unbeatable and anyone who tells you any
[1:05:11] less it's not matching up with what I
[1:05:14] see in the
[1:05:15] word because the prophet said she's
[1:05:17] going to be
[1:05:21] invincible so is it going to take time
[1:05:23] yes that's the whole point of
[1:05:24] restoration restoration is bringing you
[1:05:26] back to that the first church it's like
[1:05:29] um I was reading brother Bram said at
[1:05:32] the beginning God waved Christ over over
[1:05:36] the Harvest okay it was the very first
[1:05:38] to come up but it had to die and now
[1:05:41] that same the first one to come up
[1:05:43] really was brother brandom he came to
[1:05:45] maturity first and God waved him over
[1:05:47] the people saying it's coming it's
[1:05:50] coming it's coming and everything that
[1:05:52] you saw in him you'll see in US maybe
[1:05:54] not to the same obviously degree but
[1:05:57] you'll still see it like um like the T
[1:06:00] Vision it will be sometimes hidden just
[1:06:03] between you and God but it's just as
[1:06:06] strong just as
[1:06:08] powerful and it's the same life it's the
[1:06:11] same
[1:06:14] life all
[1:06:16] right
[1:06:21] so perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[1:06:24] the important thing one of the most
[1:06:25] important things that we must Master now
[1:06:27] remember this and especially young
[1:06:28] preachers and lay members alike lay
[1:06:30] members is just a normal believer
[1:06:33] someone who is not a minister there's
[1:06:35] one thing that we got to master if we
[1:06:37] expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[1:06:39] life that is we have to master the
[1:06:40] thought of human ability if we ever get
[1:06:43] to a spot that where we think that we
[1:06:44] can do it with our own intelligence and
[1:06:46] our own abilities we got to master that
[1:06:48] in such a way that we can get rid of the
[1:06:50] thing and lay it aside so that God can
[1:06:51] use us that's right one of my favorite
[1:06:55] quotes second that's what we need to do
[1:06:57] have to do today that's what I need
[1:06:59] that's what every man needs is a loss of
[1:07:01] himself loss of his ability loss of what
[1:07:03] he is that he might have a complete
[1:07:05] yielding to the Holy Spirit the
[1:07:07] housewife needs that the school boy
[1:07:09] needs that even our little
[1:07:11] children no one is exempt and what's
[1:07:14] what's interesting is by him saying you
[1:07:15] need to lose the thought of human
[1:07:17] ability that means that God can use down
[1:07:20] to the little child once that child is
[1:07:24] aware so that's why we got to be careful
[1:07:28] in terms of dealing with the young that
[1:07:30] you're not
[1:07:31] crushing because the young ones are the
[1:07:33] young
[1:07:34] sprigs and without realizing it we can
[1:07:39] stunt we can stunt growth if we're not
[1:07:42] careful so that's why you got to be um
[1:07:45] you got to be mindful you got to be
[1:07:46] mindful of the Little
[1:07:48] Eagles so really the the whole aim here
[1:07:51] is to show that like Nehemiah is a
[1:07:53] Layman he's a regular believer he's not
[1:07:54] a priest he's not a scribe he's not a
[1:07:56] prophet or a nobleman he is a normal
[1:07:59] believer type of us and God used him
[1:08:03] tremendously tremendously and the whole
[1:08:06] point is that if he can use a man
[1:08:08] without the Holy Ghost in such a degree
[1:08:11] how much more can you use one of us a
[1:08:14] housewife School child you know whoever
[1:08:17] it may be he can use you it's not just
[1:08:19] for the ministry that's the worst thing
[1:08:20] we could do if there's someone sick you
[1:08:23] remember that story of brother
[1:08:25] brandham there was a a woman he was
[1:08:28] going to pray for and before that happen
[1:08:30] and and she was she was in the prayer
[1:08:32] line after it but a woman next to her
[1:08:35] kept on feeling pressed pray for her
[1:08:38] pray for her pray for her she couldn't
[1:08:40] shake it so she just puts her hand on
[1:08:42] her like I just feel pressed to pray for
[1:08:44] you and she's like sure she prays for
[1:08:46] her nothing seemly great happens that
[1:08:49] woman that got prayed for goes up to
[1:08:50] brother bandam and he said why you're up
[1:08:52] here you're you're healed
[1:08:55] and then the Holy Spirit discerns it and
[1:08:57] goes wait a minute you were prayed for
[1:08:59] by that woman there he said the moment
[1:09:02] you prayed for her she was healed so why
[1:09:05] is God allowing that that that to happen
[1:09:07] is to show that like that woman is
[1:09:11] tapping into the same resource that the
[1:09:14] prophet is it's not brother brandom it's
[1:09:16] not brother brandom with magic hands
[1:09:18] it's brother brandom getting out of the
[1:09:20] way and allowing Christ to work through
[1:09:21] brother brandom the same way that woman
[1:09:23] is stepping out of her way to allow
[1:09:25] Christ to work through her it's not it's
[1:09:28] not just for the man it's for the woman
[1:09:31] it's for the child it's for anyone who
[1:09:34] has been filled with the spirit because
[1:09:36] where he is there is life and when
[1:09:38] there's life there's evidence of life is
[1:09:40] it all the time no is is everyone here
[1:09:43] going to raise the dead probably not is
[1:09:45] everyone here going to stop the weather
[1:09:48] probably not but there are there where
[1:09:50] life is it expresses itself it has no
[1:09:53] choice but to express itself you light a
[1:09:56] match in a dark room it bursts with
[1:10:00] light can't hide
[1:10:03] it okay so Nehemiah was a man of prayer
[1:10:06] and of great discernment okay you see it
[1:10:09] he sees through all these tactics of the
[1:10:11] enemies and we'll get to that obviously
[1:10:14] in time but overall he led Israel with
[1:10:17] great wisdom you very wise
[1:10:20] man so the the major themes in Nehemiah
[1:10:23] there two major themes obviously
[1:10:25] restoration is the overall overarching
[1:10:27] theme it's uh because it's not just the
[1:10:30] walls that he restores it's it's the law
[1:10:33] the law of Moses gets restored the uh
[1:10:36] tithing gets restored uh he also
[1:10:41] um or no I'm getting that mixed up with
[1:10:44] the the rich were oppressing the poor
[1:10:46] with interest they they they were
[1:10:48] putting Shackles on it which is against
[1:10:50] scripture interest was for the stranger
[1:10:53] not for for the believer if the believer
[1:10:55] put interest on another believer it was
[1:10:57] it was an offense against God so there
[1:10:59] was a bunch of those things that he he
[1:11:01] he um he cleaned up so he was a He
[1:11:03] restored all of it physical spiritual
[1:11:07] all of
[1:11:09] it and you know we we see that like God
[1:11:13] had had begun that process of
[1:11:14] restoration through zerubba with the
[1:11:16] temple and then Ezra with the with the
[1:11:19] the Pagan
[1:11:20] relationships and God was wanting
[1:11:24] Nehemiah to complete the work that they
[1:11:26] started and the way that Nehemiah
[1:11:28] restored Jerusalem was it wasn't like a
[1:11:31] a miraculous
[1:11:33] thing it was very boots on the ground it
[1:11:36] was one stone on top of the other there
[1:11:39] was a lot of sweat involved in in in the
[1:11:42] restoration involved with with Nehemiah
[1:11:45] but it was nonetheless miraculous he
[1:11:46] finished the work in 52 days the temple
[1:11:50] took four years he didn't in 52 days so
[1:11:52] little is much when God is in it and it
[1:11:55] it doesn't matter how insignificant the
[1:11:57] the process of one footstep looks in the
[1:12:00] process of your restoration one foot is
[1:12:03] one foot that was recently Devil's
[1:12:06] Ground so you know with us each day if
[1:12:11] we're as long as we're ining forward is
[1:12:12] a victory God it some days it may be you
[1:12:16] know a couple steps but as long as
[1:12:18] you're facing the right direction your
[1:12:21] heart is aiming in the right direction
[1:12:23] and you're inching forward if you can't
[1:12:25] run walk and if you can't walk
[1:12:29] crawl and The Crawling days look like
[1:12:32] defeated
[1:12:33] days but it's still
[1:12:39] progress okay so it's
[1:12:42] um you know as we learn you know
[1:12:45] restoration is is
[1:12:48] is it starts the moment that you really
[1:12:51] give your heart to the Lord but it
[1:12:52] really starts when you get filled with
[1:12:54] the Holy Ghost because the moment that
[1:12:56] he he fills you
[1:12:58] entirely he's now in the position of
[1:13:02] headship which means now he's at the
[1:13:04] head and now he's going to move you
[1:13:07] forward and it's like a a great great
[1:13:09] sermon is uh doors and door because
[1:13:12] brother R talks about there's one door
[1:13:14] to your heart but there's many doors in
[1:13:16] that heart and it's what God is doing is
[1:13:18] that over time he's opening up more and
[1:13:20] more doors to have access to your life
[1:13:23] okay because if he worked on on us
[1:13:25] immediately and in in every area we
[1:13:28] would just be a grease spot because it
[1:13:29] would be so painful and he he's not
[1:13:31] going to give you more than you can bear
[1:13:34] so that's why he restores over
[1:13:36] time because he does he works with the
[1:13:39] lowest hanging fruit first he he what is
[1:13:41] the
[1:13:42] most what are the things that are going
[1:13:43] to cause the most hiccup immediately
[1:13:45] that's what he starts working on first
[1:13:47] because that's why you see even at an
[1:13:49] elderly age a Believer still is supposed
[1:13:52] to be worked on
[1:13:54] if they're
[1:13:55] honest because everyone is in sinful
[1:14:00] flesh this is not going to be restored
[1:14:03] here but inside should be and the Soul
[1:14:07] should have dominion over
[1:14:09] this it doesn't mean that you know
[1:14:12] you're going not going to have your
[1:14:13] hiccups and all that stuff but it should
[1:14:14] have
[1:14:17] dominion so you know it's uh I've said
[1:14:20] it before leacy is the age of
[1:14:22] restoration brother random said it it's
[1:14:24] the time where everything is coming back
[1:14:26] to what it should be there is the word
[1:14:29] has been completely released on the
[1:14:31] church today and the only thing holding
[1:14:33] back God is your
[1:14:36] permission it's your permission you're
[1:14:39] the only reason why you're not further
[1:14:40] ahead than what you are and it's the
[1:14:42] harsh truth because if you're struggling
[1:14:46] with something have you given it
[1:14:48] up have you given access for him to do
[1:14:51] it and the way it works is that the more
[1:14:56] you go to God the easier it gets to go
[1:14:59] to God and then the more he can start
[1:15:01] working on you so overtime is a process
[1:15:03] of restoration it's every area it's not
[1:15:06] just church it's your marriage it's your
[1:15:09] finances it's your kids it's your career
[1:15:12] it's the way you do your career it's
[1:15:14] where you live it's how you live it's
[1:15:16] what you look at is what you read it's
[1:15:18] what you watch it's what you listen to
[1:15:19] it's everything he's restoring
[1:15:20] everything he should be restoring
[1:15:22] everything okay because it has to be a
[1:15:25] Victorious prde at the end does it mean
[1:15:28] that you are
[1:15:29] sinless no but it should mean that you
[1:15:32] have
[1:15:33] dominion and what God is doing is that
[1:15:35] slowly by little by little like the
[1:15:37] scripture here in
[1:15:39] Deuteronomy verse 22 and the Lord thy
[1:15:41] God will put out those Nations before
[1:15:43] thee little by little and little thou
[1:15:46] mayest not consume them at once lest the
[1:15:47] beasts of the fields increase upon thee
[1:15:49] but the Lord thy God shall deliver them
[1:15:51] unto thee and shall destroy them with a
[1:15:52] mighty destruction until they be
[1:15:54] destroyed and he shall deliver the Kings
[1:15:57] into thine hand and thou shalt destroy
[1:15:58] their name from under Heaven there shall
[1:16:00] no man be able to stand before thee
[1:16:02] until thou have destroyed them and
[1:16:05] what's interesting here is that he's
[1:16:06] talking about and he shall deliver their
[1:16:08] kings into thine hand and we saw that
[1:16:09] come to pass
[1:16:11] with he puts the five Kings into the
[1:16:13] cave locks them up kills the whole Army
[1:16:16] comes back to the cave and says to the
[1:16:17] captains now put your no you put your
[1:16:20] foot on their
[1:16:21] neck okay and what was the reason for
[1:16:24] that Joshua is saying to the captains
[1:16:27] you have power over these Kings now they
[1:16:30] were once your enemies they no longer
[1:16:32] have power over you and God does the
[1:16:34] same thing when he delivers delivers you
[1:16:36] from say a struggle with something he'll
[1:16:40] lead you back to that thing and he'll
[1:16:43] show you your neck now is on your foot
[1:16:46] is on that that Demon's neck it's done
[1:16:49] it's over and he'll show you it's done
[1:16:54] because more often than not we we don't
[1:16:56] we don't believe that we have the
[1:16:57] ability to do it in
[1:16:59] ourselves we we don't doubt God but we
[1:17:01] doubt The Vessel and what what what does
[1:17:04] God allow in those moments he's saying
[1:17:06] no no you you have power over this thing
[1:17:10] I have given you the authority over this
[1:17:12] thing and it's your job to put your foot
[1:17:14] on
[1:17:17] it okay it takes suffering you have to
[1:17:20] dig oh my if you only knew it's not easy
[1:17:23] anything that's hading to you on a
[1:17:24] platter you don't enjoy it certainly you
[1:17:26] can't appreciate what's given to you God
[1:17:28] told Moses and said I give you Palestine
[1:17:30] I've swept out all the houses and hung
[1:17:31] up the curtains you all just go right up
[1:17:34] and live there would that have been it
[1:17:35] they never would have they never would
[1:17:38] have enjoyed it he said I'll give it to
[1:17:40] you it's full of giants you'll have to
[1:17:41] fight every inch of the way whatever
[1:17:43] Place The Souls of your footsteps that's
[1:17:45] possession go take it sure as I'll be
[1:17:48] with you that's the way Divine Healing
[1:17:49] is that's the way the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:51] everything you could walk behind you
[1:17:52] it's footsteps his possession keep
[1:17:54] walking keep going that's the way you
[1:17:56] just move your finger couldn't move move
[1:17:58] it at all you move that much today move
[1:18:00] that much tomorrow and that much more
[1:18:02] the next day just keep on moving moving
[1:18:03] moving footsteps is
[1:18:05] possession because during that time you
[1:18:08] know Israel learned that God would
[1:18:11] provide for each enemy and for each
[1:18:12] battle cuz I think John has said it that
[1:18:15] not every battle was the same some were
[1:18:17] like Jericho but some they they sieged
[1:18:22] and it was a time before it went away
[1:18:24] they starved him out and each one was
[1:18:26] different and what what did that require
[1:18:28] that required trusting Jehovah for what
[1:18:31] the next battle entails because we don't
[1:18:33] deal with every problem the same
[1:18:35] way we have to be led by the spirit and
[1:18:39] God gives us the direction that we need
[1:18:40] to defeat whatever is in our path and
[1:18:43] what does that do it it develops trust
[1:18:46] between you and God because over time
[1:18:48] you start to learn that God has
[1:18:51] everything in control
[1:18:53] faith is the master of all circumstances
[1:18:56] and faith is the entire leaning of the
[1:18:59] human personality upon God it's leaning
[1:19:03] entirely on God there's none of you in
[1:19:06] there you are not holding you up God is
[1:19:09] the one leading
[1:19:10] you so God you know in the quote
[1:19:15] here says it well that's the way the
[1:19:17] things of God are after you've trusted
[1:19:19] him and watched him do so many things
[1:19:21] till become like a regular
[1:19:23] and that's a condition I think the
[1:19:24] church will be in just before the coming
[1:19:26] of the Lord so the Rapture will just go
[1:19:28] on right on that way and it'll just be a
[1:19:30] regular routine of following the
[1:19:31] scriptures and the plans of
[1:19:33] God okay because we are led by spirit
[1:19:36] and truth because there's going to be
[1:19:39] times where the scripture says it best
[1:19:41] where God leads you in strange ways
[1:19:44] there's times where you may not find an
[1:19:46] exact scripture for what you're dealing
[1:19:48] with okay but there may be a scripture
[1:19:52] principle that that applies to it okay
[1:19:55] cuz there's nothing new Under the Sun
[1:19:57] and there's a scripture for everything
[1:19:59] it just may not be like there's a
[1:20:00] scripture for your phone there's no but
[1:20:03] there's be ignorant be not ignorant of
[1:20:05] Satan's devices though that's pretty
[1:20:07] clear right but there's times where
[1:20:10] God's going to lead you down strange
[1:20:11] paths where it feels like uh Noah has
[1:20:14] gone down this path I'm
[1:20:17] sure but when he leads you through the
[1:20:20] valley of the shadow of death it may
[1:20:23] seem dark and lonely during those times
[1:20:25] where he's leading you down a dark
[1:20:26] Corridor and you can't see your way out
[1:20:29] but you got to trust that the tender
[1:20:32] hand of Jehovah who's LED you this far
[1:20:35] will lead you through okay and that's
[1:20:38] where it it it takes
[1:20:41] um it takes praying
[1:20:44] through because praying through is a
[1:20:47] lost art today people say that they pray
[1:20:51] but all really that they're doing is
[1:20:53] that they shoveled up their request up
[1:20:55] with God and said I've prayed about it
[1:20:57] and then continue the way that they want
[1:20:58] to go John has been saying all the time
[1:21:00] about you know you're you're directing
[1:21:04] God in that direction versus getting
[1:21:07] neutral and sitting and waiting for the
[1:21:10] answer and once you get the answer that
[1:21:12] doesn't mean you go you then pray
[1:21:14] through until it's settled once and for
[1:21:17] all and that's the Lost Art and that's
[1:21:20] what God is trying to get us to the
[1:21:22] point where you're sure Beyond sure that
[1:21:26] where you are is where you're meant to
[1:21:28] be because unfortunately if you don't do
[1:21:31] that you're presuming you're venturing
[1:21:32] without Authority and anything that
[1:21:35] happens to you when you're presuming is
[1:21:37] on
[1:21:39] you if you step outside of God's will in
[1:21:43] order to do something that you want to
[1:21:44] do you're outside of the protection and
[1:21:47] the authority of the
[1:21:49] word and you have no one else to blame
[1:21:52] but you if for any scars that you get
[1:21:53] turn that so it just the whole point is
[1:21:57] pray through make sure that where you're
[1:21:59] standing make your calling and election
[1:22:00] sure make sure what that what you're
[1:22:02] doing is Led of the Lord and we all have
[1:22:04] scars from
[1:22:06] that you got the evidence for it and
[1:22:10] hopefully you'll learn from
[1:22:12] it okay so the the the second theme of
[1:22:15] Nehemiah is is maturity and we see
[1:22:17] it in in in spad with Nehemiah in terms
[1:22:20] of how he reacts to situations
[1:22:23] okay Nehemiah is a veteran he's not a
[1:22:26] rookie in terms of how he reacts to
[1:22:30] situations because you see how he reacts
[1:22:32] when Trouble Comes he doesn't
[1:22:35] react he doesn't just fly off the handle
[1:22:38] his first thing is always go to God go
[1:22:41] to God go to God go to
[1:22:43] God and that should be our first reflex
[1:22:46] every time go to God there's a situation
[1:22:48] at work go to God situation at home go
[1:22:51] to God okay doesn't take long it's the
[1:22:55] ultimate insurance policy go to
[1:22:57] God you'll save yourself a lot of
[1:23:00] scars so with every obstacle that
[1:23:03] Nehemiah faces he goes to God and then
[1:23:05] God gives him the leadership that he
[1:23:07] needs and because he gives him the
[1:23:08] leadership he needs he has the faith to
[1:23:10] do what he needs to do no matter how
[1:23:12] hard it gets and how hot it gets because
[1:23:15] scripture talks about Nehemiah outside
[1:23:17] of Nehemiah of how it's going to be and
[1:23:20] was it going to be easy and maturity
[1:23:21] Comes A Time
[1:23:23] okay no one is born a veteran it comes
[1:23:26] with time it comes with experience it
[1:23:27] comes with suffering it comes from
[1:23:30] falling down and getting back up it
[1:23:31] comes from sometimes being over your
[1:23:34] head and you learn that even when you're
[1:23:36] drowning there's still Grace just like
[1:23:40] Peter because eventually this is where
[1:23:42] we need to go in Ephesians 4 that we
[1:23:44] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[1:23:46] and fro and carried about with every
[1:23:48] wind of Doctrine by the Slate of man and
[1:23:50] cunning craftiness whereby they lay and
[1:23:52] wa in wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:23:55] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:23:57] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:23:59] he is the head from whom the whole body
[1:24:02] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:24:04] that which every joint supplieth
[1:24:05] according to the effectual working in
[1:24:07] the measure of every part maketh
[1:24:09] increase of the body unto the Ed
[1:24:11] edifying of itself in love this is a
[1:24:14] body here that's mature that's in her in
[1:24:17] her place in her position she's not
[1:24:19] trying to steal Glory from the next
[1:24:21] person she is lo and step with the
[1:24:23] person next to her and she's staying in
[1:24:25] line and because of that the body the
[1:24:28] body is now in subjection under the head
[1:24:30] and the head can deliver commands as
[1:24:32] needed and it's effective the body then
[1:24:35] is effective it can be edifying and you
[1:24:38] see the basis of it speaking the truth
[1:24:40] in love the very end of it unto the
[1:24:44] edifying of itself in love it begins
[1:24:45] with love and ends with love okay
[1:24:48] brother R says in perfect faith without
[1:24:50] you can't have faith without love
[1:24:52] you can't have it it always starts with
[1:24:55] love why because God is love the only
[1:24:57] thing that will get over there is
[1:24:59] perfect love perfect faith and without
[1:25:02] perfect faith without love you can't
[1:25:04] have per perfect Faith so a son of
[1:25:07] maturity is someone who settled
[1:25:08] controlled and
[1:25:10] calm a situation arises you're not
[1:25:12] flying up the handle I'm not always the
[1:25:15] best at that
[1:25:19] okay when we're removing from our our
[1:25:23] house our apartment to the house I was
[1:25:25] flying around didn't have any food and
[1:25:26] me and Auntie Brenda comes over and like
[1:25:29] Paul just sit down okay have some water
[1:25:30] you'll be
[1:25:32] fine okay thank you and that's that's
[1:25:36] the that's the way we can be sometimes
[1:25:37] we're flying around trying to do
[1:25:38] everything and you're trying to figure
[1:25:40] it out and you know you just kind of
[1:25:42] need someone with a bit of experience be
[1:25:43] like you just you just need a cookie get
[1:25:45] your blood sugar
[1:25:47] up so that's the thing you know it's
[1:25:49] just maturity comes with this experience
[1:25:53] and we're not born with it it takes time
[1:25:56] it takes God putting trials on us and
[1:25:58] what it requires is constant
[1:26:00] trials constant heavier and heavier
[1:26:04] loads Joe always talks about his
[1:26:06] favorite scripture in Isaiah or it's in
[1:26:08] the Amplified I think and it says the
[1:26:10] Lord will harden you to
[1:26:13] troubles it doesn't mean it it's
[1:26:15] hardening your heart it's hardening you
[1:26:19] to the difficulty of the trial meaning
[1:26:22] meaning that God can trust you with more
[1:26:24] and more and you stay soft you you stay
[1:26:27] pliable and that's only the grace of God
[1:26:30] you learn it's you getting a tougher
[1:26:33] skin but still staying soft to your
[1:26:36] brother you know and that takes only the
[1:26:38] grace of God to do that because the what
[1:26:40] does the world get the world gets hard
[1:26:43] people go through incredible trauma and
[1:26:45] they get hard and they get bitter and
[1:26:46] they get and it's just angry the child
[1:26:49] of God does not get angry they
[1:26:51] shouldn't if if God is with them they'll
[1:26:53] they'll get hammered out but when when
[1:26:56] someone goes through a trial and it's
[1:26:57] hard and it's difficult once you're
[1:26:58] through it a child of God always sees
[1:27:00] and said it was worth every
[1:27:02] second it was worth every second that is
[1:27:06] only the grace of God that you can go
[1:27:08] through the most horrific thing and say
[1:27:11] I am blessed because of
[1:27:13] that and that's
[1:27:15] maturity cuz God God God is not going to
[1:27:17] be you know it's not like the education
[1:27:19] system today where it's just like here's
[1:27:21] a cookie for what you did good but I
[1:27:23] failed doesn't matter you go up the next
[1:27:25] grade God is not like that if you fail
[1:27:27] you go back to the back of the line and
[1:27:28] you do the test again and you go back
[1:27:30] again over and over and over until you
[1:27:34] pass and then once you passed that there
[1:27:37] may be a small brief moment of rest bite
[1:27:40] enjoy it while it lasts and then God
[1:27:42] will start hammering on something else
[1:27:44] again because the whole point is that
[1:27:46] our rest is not here in our bodies Our
[1:27:49] rest is over there but our rest should
[1:27:51] be inside throughout it and that only
[1:27:54] comes from
[1:27:56] him I love this quote and I tried
[1:27:59] forever to find it and I finally found
[1:28:00] it and I was so happy when I found it
[1:28:03] like you're learning to swim and you
[1:28:04] know you splash the water and go across
[1:28:06] the pool and I made her now after you
[1:28:10] learn to swim more graceful is the
[1:28:12] stroke and it don't wear you out so much
[1:28:15] see that's it you learn how to do it and
[1:28:16] cut every corner and make it better and
[1:28:18] that's more of an ease a little boy that
[1:28:20] never walked and would try to walk down
[1:28:21] the aisle here he would fall down a
[1:28:23] dozen times and be wore out before he
[1:28:24] got
[1:28:25] there but anyone who knows how to walk
[1:28:28] an athlete would walk right down that
[1:28:29] aisle and never even noce doing it at
[1:28:32] all well he had to start with that's
[1:28:34] what he is now well that's the same way
[1:28:36] with preaching Divine Healing or
[1:28:37] anything else as you go along you begin
[1:28:39] to learn and if you don't learn there's
[1:28:41] something wrong you got to learn and you
[1:28:43] got to learn how to accept God and what
[1:28:44] it really means and the whole point here
[1:28:46] is that you look at someone who's
[1:28:47] learning on the swim there's a lot of
[1:28:48] noise there's a lot of splashing there's
[1:28:51] a lot of
[1:28:52] mess but as someone gets experienced The
[1:28:56] Strokes get smoother they go faster with
[1:28:59] less movement I thing was you would
[1:29:01] always talk about Nate Nate swimming it
[1:29:04] would be a ton of noise and and movement
[1:29:06] and just and he's going as fast he can
[1:29:08] he's just this literally how fast he's
[1:29:11] going okay but someone you look at dad
[1:29:15] what the greatest moment my childhood
[1:29:16] we're at the cabin and Dad dives off the
[1:29:19] the deck dad never swam when we were
[1:29:21] kids so when did it was was it was an
[1:29:22] event dad dives off the warf and does a
[1:29:25] butterfly stroke the entire way across
[1:29:28] the pond and we were amazed at kid as
[1:29:31] kids because it was the most incredible
[1:29:32] thing ever but it was fast but it was
[1:29:35] efficient okay and that's the way a
[1:29:37] Believer should be as they grow those
[1:29:41] movements gets Tighter and Tighter you
[1:29:42] may not be it's not swimming obviously
[1:29:45] it means that like you begin to trust
[1:29:47] God more there's less complaining
[1:29:49] there's less whining there's less
[1:29:52] groaning there's less talking about the
[1:29:55] other guy and what he should be doing
[1:29:56] better there's less envying someone
[1:29:58] else's position like well I should be
[1:30:00] there there's less you know all the junk
[1:30:04] and it should be tighter more trust more
[1:30:07] peace more joy in in
[1:30:10] Trials as it goes on and if you're not
[1:30:12] learning that there's something
[1:30:15] wrong means that you're not you're not
[1:30:18] growing okay so that's the maturity that
[1:30:21] we looking
[1:30:27] at
[1:30:29] okay could have a bit more time I
[1:30:30] haven't even gotten in Nehemiah
[1:30:34] head
[1:30:35] okay it will be worth
[1:30:39] it all
[1:30:41] right Nehemiah we made
[1:30:43] it Nehemiah chapter 1 verse one the
[1:30:47] words of Nehemiah the son of healah and
[1:30:49] it came to pass in the month chisu in
[1:30:52] the 20th year as I was in shushan the
[1:30:55] palace the henani I one of my brethren
[1:30:57] and later on scripture it um it confirms
[1:31:00] that hanani is actually nehemiah's Blood
[1:31:04] Brother uh verse two that hanani one of
[1:31:06] my brethren came he and certain men of
[1:31:08] Judah and I asked them concerning the
[1:31:10] Jews that had escaped which were left of
[1:31:12] the Captivity and concerning
[1:31:15] Jerusalem and they said unto me the
[1:31:17] remnant that are left of captivity there
[1:31:19] in the province are in great Affliction
[1:31:21] and approach the wall of Jerusalem also
[1:31:23] is broken down and the gates thereof are
[1:31:25] burned with fire so this is a first
[1:31:28] introduction to the to the book of
[1:31:30] Nehemiah there is no Preamble there's
[1:31:31] nothing it's just immediate here's the
[1:31:33] problem
[1:31:35] okay and you know the obvious the
[1:31:40] problem the problem is very obvious with
[1:31:42] Without Walls you have problems okay in
[1:31:45] ancient times a wall was the most
[1:31:48] critical thing it protects you from your
[1:31:50] enemies all right right and and what did
[1:31:53] those Broken Walls signify so the the
[1:31:54] two things that are mentioned here is
[1:31:56] Affliction and reproach and
[1:31:59] affliction caused by the Broken
[1:32:02] Walls is that it left the people
[1:32:04] defenseless against their enemies most
[1:32:07] obviously it allowed weather to come in
[1:32:12] it allowed wild animals to come
[1:32:15] in thieves
[1:32:18] vagabonds there's no
[1:32:20] protection anything and everything can
[1:32:24] happen so what that causes for a people
[1:32:28] living there is great angst no one there
[1:32:31] is comfortable living there you're
[1:32:34] constantly afraid of what's going to
[1:32:35] happen you don't know if something's
[1:32:37] going to hit you from behind you're
[1:32:38] going to get robbed any second your
[1:32:40] daughter is going to get kidnapped or
[1:32:42] whatever it may be there is no peace
[1:32:45] whatsoever in the
[1:32:47] situation no peace and then in terms of
[1:32:50] reproach
[1:32:53] it says here that the
[1:32:54] remnant are are in reproach
[1:32:58] okay and a city with Broken Walls
[1:33:00] reveals a defeated people it's a
[1:33:03] constant reminder of what they lost of
[1:33:06] what they were and what they are now
[1:33:08] okay of people who are chosen of the
[1:33:11] king are living like a bunch of
[1:33:15] rats in a totally broken down disheveled
[1:33:18] State there's no there's no glory in
[1:33:21] that
[1:33:23] and the Jews who had
[1:33:25] returned in their to their Homeland were
[1:33:27] were were just they they felt unsafe and
[1:33:29] they felt humiliated in what position
[1:33:31] they were especially as children of the
[1:33:33] king we are descendants of King
[1:33:36] David Solomon the most glorious King in
[1:33:40] in that time and they are now living in
[1:33:42] Rabel okay and this reflected badly on
[1:33:44] the name of Jehovah okay because anyone
[1:33:48] who who's looking at that situation
[1:33:50] there's no way that that Jehovah is is
[1:33:52] is protecting
[1:33:53] them so God is obligated okay to take
[1:33:56] care of them so we're going to see what
[1:33:59] ne's reaction is
[1:34:01] here if we
[1:34:03] click okay verse four and it came to
[1:34:06] pass when I heard these words that I sat
[1:34:07] down and wept and mourn certain days and
[1:34:09] fasted and prayed before the god of
[1:34:10] Heaven okay so his first reaction is
[1:34:13] what he goes and fasts he prays he weeps
[1:34:18] he Mourns and finally he goes before the
[1:34:21] Throne of God okay so his his first
[1:34:24] reaction is really it's an immediate
[1:34:26] burden for the situation and the way
[1:34:29] burdens work is that you can't you can't
[1:34:32] just you know take someone else's burden
[1:34:34] or burdens happen they arrive okay no
[1:34:40] one forces a burden no one really asks
[1:34:42] for a burden if they're honest except
[1:34:45] for burden for lost souls that this
[1:34:46] should always be there but when it comes
[1:34:49] to our burden for a situation the those
[1:34:51] just arrive okay it do you don't choose
[1:34:55] it it chooses you okay cuz the same news
[1:34:59] that hanani his brother heard had no
[1:35:02] effect he just shared the news and went
[1:35:04] on but with Nehemiah it has an effect
[1:35:07] there's an
[1:35:08] immediate groaning in the spirit there
[1:35:11] and and with a burden what is a burden
[1:35:13] it's a thing that you carry it's a
[1:35:16] weight it's a there's a sorrow with it
[1:35:19] okay and that burden comes on Nehemiah
[1:35:22] and he feels the weight of it
[1:35:23] immediately okay cuz that burden chose
[1:35:26] him he didn't choose it he was just
[1:35:28] walking on his merry way and this burden
[1:35:29] comes out of
[1:35:31] nowhere okay and why is
[1:35:37] that where am I supposed to
[1:35:42] point God wants his people to pray and
[1:35:44] when Israel had got so taxed in such a
[1:35:46] condition that they could not go any
[1:35:47] further their time was fulfilled and
[1:35:49] their burdens was lay further than what
[1:35:51] they thought then and then they begin to
[1:35:53] pray and when the people begin to pray
[1:35:55] then God begin to hear it was time for
[1:35:57] God's word to be fulfilled and so when
[1:35:59] amran and Jose Yosh saw that it was time
[1:36:02] for the word to be fulfilled they went
[1:36:03] to prayer to God and it's usually those
[1:36:06] who pray is the one who's got the burden
[1:36:08] the one who gets something it's those
[1:36:10] who pray that's ordained of God to do so
[1:36:14] okay and you'll see it you'll see in
[1:36:17] certain situations that there will be
[1:36:19] news at land and you may be on face but
[1:36:21] the person next to you is just laboring
[1:36:25] laboring in prayer I remember I forget
[1:36:27] who it was but it was a young man he had
[1:36:29] a young
[1:36:30] family and he he other had like really
[1:36:33] late stage cancer and we a couple years
[1:36:37] back before I had kids and you know we
[1:36:40] were kind of keeping updated on it and I
[1:36:43] remember Joe Joe had such a burden for
[1:36:45] him and we we were at brunch and we
[1:36:48] heard we heard the news turn and Joe
[1:36:50] just immediately like I have I I I can't
[1:36:53] sit here so he went in the bedroom and
[1:36:55] he was in there for like an hour or so
[1:36:57] just crying uh crying and praying to the
[1:36:58] Lord and for me it was just like you
[1:37:01] feel empathy for the man and and and you
[1:37:03] pray but but that was it but for Joe it
[1:37:05] was just he L he was he was laboring in
[1:37:07] prayer he was in travail over this man
[1:37:10] and and I realized it's just like Joe
[1:37:12] can Joe has kids Joe is almost the same
[1:37:17] age as this man and he knows what this
[1:37:20] man is feeling in this moment he doesn't
[1:37:22] know if he's staying or going and for me
[1:37:25] I felt bad cuz I didn't have the same
[1:37:27] level of of of Burden but the burden
[1:37:30] chose Joe at that moment and it's not
[1:37:33] always the case there's things that I
[1:37:35] have a burden for that Joe may not have
[1:37:37] and there's nothing wrong with either
[1:37:39] because God has specific people for
[1:37:41] specific purposes okay and you'll see it
[1:37:45] like there's one person meeting this
[1:37:46] need but I'm meeting another and you
[1:37:50] know Amber may be meeting another need
[1:37:51] that I can't do because God has trained
[1:37:53] her for that purpose and what that does
[1:37:55] is that every person is now in lock step
[1:37:58] with each other to the ultimate
[1:38:00] edification of the body no one is
[1:38:02] crossing each other up they're not
[1:38:05] fighting they're not
[1:38:08] fighting for the other role because they
[1:38:10] know that if I stay in my place
[1:38:12] everything will work out perfectly
[1:38:15] because it's the head that directs the
[1:38:17] body if we can get in subjection to him
[1:38:21] everything
[1:38:23] flows everything flows because he is the
[1:38:25] head of of the body not us if we get in
[1:38:27] the way it's a
[1:38:30] mess total mess so there's a need
[1:38:34] Nehemiah here's a need okay and the
[1:38:37] beauty of a situation is that all God
[1:38:39] needs in a broken situation is one
[1:38:42] person one empty
[1:38:46] vessel not empty in the sense they don't
[1:38:48] know have the Holy Ghost no one empty
[1:38:51] vessel that's ready and prepared for
[1:38:53] service they are ready to go into action
[1:38:56] they're just not being used yet and
[1:38:58] that's all God needs he needs one
[1:39:00] praying man and it wasn't going to be a
[1:39:02] prince again it wasn't going to be a
[1:39:04] prophet it was going to be a lowly cup
[1:39:06] Bearer someone whose job was to taste
[1:39:09] the cup of the king to make sure it
[1:39:10] wasn't
[1:39:12] poisoned someone whose job was daily
[1:39:16] death because at that time
[1:39:17] assassinations were you know regular
[1:39:21] occurrence so his job every day was just
[1:39:23] am I going to die and God chose him for
[1:39:27] that
[1:39:30] moment and the key was is that Nehemiah
[1:39:32] was yielded he's a yielded vessel he's
[1:39:35] ready to go into
[1:39:39] action I've often said the greatest
[1:39:41] enemy I got is William brandham he's the
[1:39:42] one that gets in God's way he's the one
[1:39:44] that gets lazy he's the one that gets to
[1:39:46] a place sometimes where he thinks he can
[1:39:48] do something about it and when he does
[1:39:50] that shoves God right out of the picture
[1:39:52] but when I can get rid of that guy when
[1:39:54] I can get to a place that he's out of
[1:39:56] the way then God can come over and do
[1:39:58] things that William brandham knows
[1:40:00] nothing about thank God for an honest
[1:40:05] Prophet God's strategy is to take empty
[1:40:08] human vessels and shake the world with
[1:40:10] them like at Pentecost what did he do it
[1:40:13] taken them 10 days to get all emptied up
[1:40:15] and when they was all standing there
[1:40:16] with their vessels turned up and God
[1:40:18] took himself and filled them up that's
[1:40:20] all they shook the world God poured
[1:40:22] himself into them and that's the
[1:40:26] thing we may not be empty vessels at
[1:40:28] this point because any child of God who
[1:40:30] is filled with the Holy Ghost should be
[1:40:32] filled but there's constantly refilling
[1:40:35] you look at the book of Acts right after
[1:40:39] the acts
[1:40:40] two it's like either two or three
[1:40:42] chapters after you have Peter and James
[1:40:44] and all them going back we need more of
[1:40:46] the spirit and they see them they get
[1:40:48] down again and God refills them in again
[1:40:50] then they go out out cuz they needed
[1:40:52] more boldness they knew that they didn't
[1:40:54] have all that they needed and God fills
[1:40:56] them up again and that's what we need
[1:40:58] for what we have need of God will start
[1:41:00] filling us because the way it works is
[1:41:02] that you got to empty out of yourself
[1:41:05] for God to fill up more and a constant
[1:41:07] it starts with us emptying out and then
[1:41:09] he fills in more there's too much of us
[1:41:13] there's too much of me and
[1:41:14] me like brother saying there's I'm the
[1:41:17] one that gets in God's way because
[1:41:20] there's too much of me
[1:41:21] cuz we have him in measure we don't have
[1:41:23] in like Christ had him in fullness but
[1:41:26] every day we got to empty out a bit more
[1:41:28] so he can
[1:41:29] fill but the beauty the beauty of God
[1:41:32] God is God is
[1:41:33] uh he's the master
[1:41:36] builder and he's the one that's he sees
[1:41:40] he sees down the road this is the role
[1:41:42] that you need this is the role that
[1:41:43] you're meant for and between now and
[1:41:46] then he has it perfect laid out for you
[1:41:49] to start being molded
[1:41:51] and shaved down and cut down and emptied
[1:41:54] out for you to be ready for that
[1:41:56] role you I I look at you know John
[1:42:00] brother John as
[1:42:01] as one of the greatest examples I've
[1:42:04] ever seen that he goes
[1:42:05] out when he's young and every situation
[1:42:09] that he's in is grinding John down it's
[1:42:12] preparing John for the current role that
[1:42:15] he's in at the moment did John realize
[1:42:17] what he was in probably not did he know
[1:42:20] that he was going to be Pastor probably
[1:42:21] not but each of those things that he
[1:42:23] went through is preparing him to be of
[1:42:27] service to have the character and the
[1:42:29] majority to be able to handle situations
[1:42:31] that come his
[1:42:33] way and it only takes God to do that and
[1:42:35] that's why you got to thank God for the
[1:42:36] fleas you got to thank God for the
[1:42:38] situations that you come in that you're
[1:42:40] just why am I dealing with this it's
[1:42:42] training it's all training and the
[1:42:44] sooner you realize that it's training
[1:42:46] the sooner you'll be more content and
[1:42:48] more
[1:42:49] joyful count it all
[1:42:52] joy when you fall into diverse
[1:42:54] Temptations It's just that's the whole
[1:42:57] rule you got to be joyful because it's
[1:42:59] for your edification no chastisement at
[1:43:01] the time seems nice but it has a an
[1:43:06] eternal blessing attached to
[1:43:10] it so God had chosen NE Nehemiah for
[1:43:13] this moment and was going to use
[1:43:15] Nehemiah to shake the world
[1:43:17] okay so before Nehemiah ever began to
[1:43:20] the to rebuild that wall he start
[1:43:22] started working on that wall 800 miles
[1:43:24] away on his
[1:43:25] knees that's where he started working on
[1:43:27] that wall cuz because you see it when as
[1:43:31] he starts
[1:43:32] praying there's already a desire in
[1:43:35] there for him to finish the
[1:43:37] work he knows it's
[1:43:41] him somehow he just it falls on him and
[1:43:45] he knows I meant to do
[1:43:49] this uh can go a bit longer or we good
[1:43:53] 834 go a bit
[1:43:55] longer nemiah verse uh 1
[1:43:59] verse5 and said I beseech thee Oh Lord
[1:44:01] God Of Heaven the great and terrible God
[1:44:04] that keepeth Covenant and mercy for them
[1:44:06] that love him and observe his
[1:44:07] Commandments let thine ear now be
[1:44:08] attentive and Thine Eyes Open that thou
[1:44:11] mayest hear the prayer of thy servant
[1:44:13] which I pray before thee now day and
[1:44:15] night for the children of Israel thy
[1:44:16] servants and confess the sins of the
[1:44:19] children of Israel which have sinned
[1:44:20] against against thee both I and my
[1:44:22] father's house have sinned We have dealt
[1:44:24] very corruptly against
[1:44:27] thee and have not kept the Commandments
[1:44:30] nor the statutes nor the judgments with
[1:44:32] thou commandest thy servant Moses
[1:44:34] remember I beseech Thee the word that
[1:44:36] thou command thy servant Moses saying if
[1:44:38] ye transgress I will scatter you abroad
[1:44:41] among the Nations but if you turn unto
[1:44:43] me and keep my Commandments and do them
[1:44:45] though they were of You cast out unto
[1:44:48] the uttermost part of the heaven yet I
[1:44:49] will gather them from from from then and
[1:44:51] will bring them unto the place that I
[1:44:53] have chosen to set my name
[1:44:55] there now these are thy servants and thy
[1:44:57] people whom th Redeemed by thy great
[1:44:59] power and by thy great hand oh Lord I
[1:45:01] beseech thee let now thine ear be
[1:45:04] attentive to the prayer of thy servant
[1:45:06] and to the prayer of thy servants who
[1:45:08] desire to fear thy name and prosper I
[1:45:10] pray thee thy servant this day and Grant
[1:45:12] him Mercy in the sight of this man for I
[1:45:14] was the king's cup
[1:45:19] bear
[1:45:21] so that phrase right there and Grant him
[1:45:24] Mercy in the sight of this man this man
[1:45:25] is the King of Persia okay what Nehemiah
[1:45:30] is asking here is Grant me favor with
[1:45:32] the King because I'm in a position where
[1:45:35] I can talk to the king but give me
[1:45:38] favor so nehemiah's approach to God what
[1:45:42] is it
[1:45:43] correct you have to come with the right
[1:45:45] kind of approach to God if you come
[1:45:47] selfish if you come in any other
[1:45:48] approach but the right mental attitude
[1:45:50] towards God or any Divine gift you'll
[1:45:52] never receive any benefits from it
[1:45:54] you've got to come with your surrendered
[1:45:56] all to God just remember now as I go on
[1:45:58] record in these tapes I say this with
[1:46:00] all my heart that if any persons will
[1:46:02] take the right mental attitude toward
[1:46:04] any Divine promise that God has made
[1:46:06] it'll bring to pass if you could take
[1:46:09] the right attitude toward what he said
[1:46:10] it'll bring it to
[1:46:12] pass because you're many
[1:46:16] creators as a man thinks in his art so
[1:46:19] is he
[1:46:22] life and death lay in the power of the
[1:46:23] tongue so what you think and what you
[1:46:26] confess is what will happen if you
[1:46:29] confess the negative it will happen What
[1:46:32] joob feared Came Upon him but if you
[1:46:35] confess
[1:46:37] life it will bring more more
[1:46:40] abundantly
[1:46:45] okay because it's like the first
[1:46:46] scripture that we said he should but
[1:46:49] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:46:50] water whatsoever he doth shall prosper
[1:46:53] why because he's plugged into the the
[1:46:56] water of life and in order for you to to
[1:47:00] to overcome
[1:47:02] yourself your atmosphere has to be right
[1:47:06] okay what you think has to be right it
[1:47:08] has to be the word what you confess has
[1:47:11] to be the word right because you look at
[1:47:14] today there's a perversion of that today
[1:47:17] and that is the power of positive
[1:47:19] thinking
[1:47:21] and I have family members who are like
[1:47:23] it who it's just I can do it I can do it
[1:47:29] man every day and there just it's
[1:47:32] constant just
[1:47:34] driil it's con it just I could I had no
[1:47:37] patience for it because it was just like
[1:47:40] because you they would say it to me like
[1:47:44] yeah man if you can just do it and just
[1:47:46] think about it and manifest it man it's
[1:47:49] going to be great and and just you look
[1:47:51] at that person's life it
[1:47:54] was why because it's all sails and no
[1:47:57] anchors it has no anchor there's no
[1:47:59] Foundation to it there's no life behind
[1:48:01] it it's driil it has a power for a
[1:48:05] season because that's why people do it
[1:48:08] because they're they're they're finally
[1:48:10] not thinking about their problems but
[1:48:12] eventually it caves in on
[1:48:15] them but the true biblical version of
[1:48:18] that is keep your mind stayed on me and
[1:48:23] I will keep you in perfect
[1:48:25] peace that's the biblical version of
[1:48:27] that and what's the difference is that
[1:48:29] it's tied to a Life
[1:48:31] Source the the power that created the
[1:48:34] heavens and the Earth that has no
[1:48:35] obstacle known to it that can defeat any
[1:48:39] attack of the
[1:48:41] enemy so if you confess the word you're
[1:48:43] tapping into creative
[1:48:46] power and then you're getting into Eden
[1:48:49] territory story where you're now taking
[1:48:53] dominion and the thing about it is
[1:48:56] that it's the whole principle of say to
[1:48:58] this
[1:49:00] mountain and the principle there is that
[1:49:03] the the Clause there is that it's not
[1:49:04] immediate it could be
[1:49:07] immediate but more often than not it's
[1:49:09] not it's sometimes just a trickle of
[1:49:12] sand at the base of it that's
[1:49:14] movement so the principle is speak to
[1:49:17] this mountain and keep speaking unto it
[1:49:20] until it moves and then once it moves
[1:49:23] then you move past it to the next
[1:49:25] mountain and you speak against that and
[1:49:28] that and what what and what happens that
[1:49:30] if like when when when you're in a
[1:49:32] situation that seems hopeless it seems
[1:49:35] so
[1:49:36] mechanical but it's like praising the
[1:49:38] Lord when you're cold and
[1:49:40] starchy you can get in a situation where
[1:49:43] it just it feel you feel stiff being in
[1:49:45] the presence of the
[1:49:47] Lord but if you yield
[1:49:52] it was interesting Saturday night I was
[1:49:54] uh praying next to the uh next to the
[1:49:56] wood
[1:49:57] stove and
[1:49:59] um there was a an
[1:50:03] ember that fell
[1:50:06] out from the last time I I uh stoked the
[1:50:10] fire and it was completely and totally
[1:50:13] cold about this big totally
[1:50:18] cold and it was one of those moments
[1:50:21] where it just like I I felt it was like
[1:50:22] a lesson in the making I didn't realize
[1:50:24] at the time and I I I picked it up and I
[1:50:25] was like H I wonder how fast it'll take
[1:50:27] for this
[1:50:28] to get back to where it should be so I
[1:50:30] open up and toss it in real roll Hawk
[1:50:32] coals in there nice fire I toss it back
[1:50:34] in there and I'm telling you within 7
[1:50:36] Seconds that thing went from straight
[1:50:38] black and cold to burning hot no
[1:50:41] difference between it and the other
[1:50:42] Embers it went from being totally
[1:50:45] useless and alone by itself to now
[1:50:48] producing the same amount of heat as the
[1:50:51] other ones that have been in there the
[1:50:52] entire
[1:50:54] time why because it was in the presence
[1:50:57] of life it was in the presence of heat
[1:51:01] and it couldn't help but push out the
[1:51:03] same as everything else what was the
[1:51:05] difference it was just in the wrong
[1:51:07] position that was the only difference so
[1:51:11] you take a Son of God who's pulling
[1:51:13] themselves
[1:51:14] away from people from fellowship from
[1:51:17] whatever it may be you're starting to to
[1:51:20] cool
[1:51:21] down and you're going to start to get
[1:51:23] cold you're still a Ember you're still
[1:51:26] part of the family but you are
[1:51:28] withdrawing yourself whatever it may
[1:51:30] could be hurts could be complexes it no
[1:51:32] matter what it is no matter the the
[1:51:35] reason may be you are pulling yourself
[1:51:37] away and all it takes for you is to get
[1:51:39] back in the presence just long enough
[1:51:41] for you to catch fire again it's all it
[1:51:44] takes for a person for a Believer it
[1:51:48] doesn't take long at all for you to go
[1:51:51] from cold and starchy to Red Hot and
[1:51:53] blazing as long you get in that
[1:51:56] presence okay so whenever someone who's
[1:52:00] been out for a while or they just
[1:52:02] haven't been you know praying as much as
[1:52:04] they have been or feeding on the word
[1:52:06] and just they just feel all stiff and
[1:52:09] and locked
[1:52:10] up it God is Not punishing that that
[1:52:15] that that fire knew no difference all it
[1:52:18] did was just here's the Heat
[1:52:20] now push it out
[1:52:21] yourself and that's the same thing with
[1:52:23] God God is Not punishing you he wants
[1:52:25] you back in the saddle he wants you
[1:52:28] effective you're more use being where
[1:52:32] you need to be than just sulking in the
[1:52:36] corner just get back in the saddle it's
[1:52:39] all it
[1:52:40] takes I just I when when I saw I was
[1:52:42] like that is
[1:52:44] amazing it was so fast so
[1:52:48] fast
[1:52:50] but it doesn't take long if you if
[1:52:52] you're cold and serge you get back in
[1:52:53] the presence you you watch you look at
[1:52:55] special meetings that's why special
[1:52:56] meetings are so important because the
[1:52:57] heat is pushing out it's blazing hot you
[1:53:00] get someone who's cold and searchy it
[1:53:02] will just peel off of them and it's
[1:53:05] liberty it's total
[1:53:08] Liberty so in terms
[1:53:11] of nehemiah's approach here he he
[1:53:14] approaches God wonderfully because he
[1:53:17] begins
[1:53:18] first with
[1:53:21] reminding God that you are a covenant
[1:53:23] keeper you made a covenant with Moses
[1:53:27] okay that if we would do if we would sin
[1:53:30] you will punish us but if we would
[1:53:32] repent you would accept us back and
[1:53:34] restore us so he reminds God of that
[1:53:37] first secondly he repents of the sin of
[1:53:39] Israel and he puts himself in that
[1:53:42] repentance he says I have sinned and my
[1:53:44] fathers have
[1:53:47] sinned so he is putting himself back
[1:53:51] into the correct position by repenting
[1:53:54] thirdly he reminds god of the promise of
[1:53:57] repentance through the word of
[1:53:59] Moses if we acknowledge our sin and come
[1:54:04] back to you you will take care of
[1:54:06] us and that's what we're doing and then
[1:54:09] fourthly he then makes his his request
[1:54:13] known to the Lord to Grant him mercy and
[1:54:15] favor in the sight of the king so he
[1:54:17] waits until the very last before he
[1:54:19] comes to God with his request he doesn't
[1:54:23] come in kick in the door and say I need
[1:54:25] this and then walks out that is not the
[1:54:28] correct approach to God the correct
[1:54:31] approach to God is humility he is the
[1:54:33] king of kings and he deserves due
[1:54:37] respect he deserves your time and he
[1:54:41] deserves unrushed
[1:54:44] time too often are we the two second you
[1:54:48] know Grace in the
[1:54:50] five minute devotion prayer and we're
[1:54:52] out if we have time to spend hours on
[1:54:57] this he deserves unrushed
[1:55:02] time so Nehemiah was willing to take the
[1:55:05] time to with a correct approach to God
[1:55:07] because you remember in ancient times
[1:55:08] the approach to the King was life and
[1:55:11] death if they didn't approach in the
[1:55:13] right way it was life or death so with
[1:55:16] that principle of Mind Nehemiah is
[1:55:19] coming humbly to Jehovah
[1:55:21] saying you are the great king you have
[1:55:25] made this Covenant may I remind you this
[1:55:28] Covenant and what he's and what he does
[1:55:31] is that he opens the channel for the
[1:55:33] blessings that flow because he's now
[1:55:36] taking the right approach to God he's
[1:55:38] having the right mental attitude towards
[1:55:41] the promise that Moses gave by which God
[1:55:44] would start
[1:55:46] answering okay and it's the same thing
[1:55:49] for for us you don't have a casual
[1:55:53] callous relationship with
[1:55:56] him we approach god with
[1:55:58] reverence we approach god with humility
[1:56:02] we approach him with
[1:56:03] love and that's the key is that if you
[1:56:06] want anything from God you can't just
[1:56:09] you don't treat God like a vening
[1:56:10] machine you just don't give him your
[1:56:13] demands and
[1:56:14] leave he is your
[1:56:16] husband and he deserves your time and
[1:56:19] when more often than not he doesn't he
[1:56:20] doesn't need all the time in the world
[1:56:22] he just wants some of your time and I've
[1:56:25] seen it the the the most sweetest times
[1:56:27] if I just go to God and say God I just
[1:56:28] need a little bit of time with you can
[1:56:31] you just spare me some of your time and
[1:56:33] I'm telling you it's almost every time
[1:56:36] presence comes
[1:56:37] down because it's just he wants to talk
[1:56:40] to
[1:56:41] you talk to
[1:56:43] him and at the end make your request
[1:56:46] known but spend some time with him first
[1:56:50] and what that what happens there is that
[1:56:54] yes he's Jehovah Gyra for you but more
[1:56:57] what he is more and more he's your
[1:57:00] bridegroom and what's the most important
[1:57:02] thing to fall in love with
[1:57:05] Jesus because it's relationship
[1:57:07] relationship is what differentiates us
[1:57:10] from anyone
[1:57:11] else because you get over on the white
[1:57:13] Throne what's what's what's the
[1:57:16] differentiator I don't know you you
[1:57:19] haven't spent time with
[1:57:21] me you haven't accepted
[1:57:23] me because you look at it that that
[1:57:26] scripture about those seven women that
[1:57:27] went to that man we want your
[1:57:29] name but we want to have our own money
[1:57:33] our own house our own independence and
[1:57:36] that's the church today they want his
[1:57:37] name but none of the headship none of
[1:57:40] the rulership they want to be saved but
[1:57:42] they don't want the
[1:57:44] rulership so what God what what does God
[1:57:46] want he wants to save you and he wants
[1:57:48] to he wants to lead you cuz he knows
[1:57:51] that outside of ourselves we would be
[1:57:56] aess mom if you want to come up you can
[1:57:58] come up I'm going to have to cut it off
[1:58:01] there God wants a relationship most most
[1:58:05] most of
[1:58:06] all because he wants what what what was
[1:58:09] the the three-fold purpose of
[1:58:13] God the last one was to have a have a
[1:58:17] bride that loved him that was a family
[1:58:20] that would rule with him forever that
[1:58:22] was his ultimate purpose and that's what
[1:58:25] he wants from you now is to have a
[1:58:28] relationship with you because without a
[1:58:30] relationship you have no
[1:58:35] Authority No Authority you have no power
[1:58:39] and without
[1:58:40] power you have no
[1:58:43] effect so God
[1:58:46] is God is leading us
[1:58:51] to realize that without him everything
[1:58:53] is empty everything is vain and if
[1:58:56] you're holding back on him and you're
[1:58:57] his he will ensure that you learn that
[1:59:00] it's empty without
[1:59:02] him and you'll go through the the the
[1:59:04] the School of Hard Knocks and you'll
[1:59:07] be you'll have no one else but to blame
[1:59:10] but yourself but eventually if you're
[1:59:11] his you'll get back into that condition
[1:59:13] of subjection and once you get back into
[1:59:15] subjection full blessings
[1:59:17] flow without that subjection there's no
[1:59:20] you'll have some you'll have some
[1:59:23] blessings CU you're a Believer when
[1:59:25] you're when you're in the at atmosphere
[1:59:27] there's there's benefits but if you want
[1:59:29] full blessings to live above your
[1:59:32] privileges rather than the below
[1:59:35] subjection subjection to Authority when
[1:59:38] that happens everything happens all
[1:59:40] these things shall be added unto you and
[1:59:42] that takes time that takes experience to
[1:59:44] learn to get back into subjection when
[1:59:46] you get out of his will cuz all If we're
[1:59:50] honest it happens to all of us and it's
[1:59:52] his grace for him to teach
[1:59:54] us and we can
[1:59:59] stand let's
[2:00:01] pray dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord
