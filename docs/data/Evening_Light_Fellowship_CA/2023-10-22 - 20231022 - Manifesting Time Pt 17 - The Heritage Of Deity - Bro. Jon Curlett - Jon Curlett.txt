thankful for your goodness we're thankful for for answered prayer this morning Lord we're thankful for healing for deliverance for provision Lord God we're thankful Lord that your Holy Spirit anoints us to live in a dark and Fallen World Lord that makes us Overcomers Lord God we're thankful we're elected Lord we're thankful we're chosen this morning that we stand here Lord not on our own merits but by the Lord unending Grace Lord that you chose us before the foundation of the world Lord would you just speak once again this morning we pray Lord minister to us Lord grant traveling mercies to those that are traveling Lord grant healing to those that are sick this morning we pray Lord Lord touch Our Lives now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen and amen amen God bless you welcome each one here this morning in the name of our Lord Jesus Christen good to see brother Gus and and his wife here sister Columbo amen God bless you amen good to see each one that's that's here this morning certainly and talked with brother Joe and brother Matt this morning so brother Joe got his moose on Friday morning and brother Matt got his moose on Saturday morning and you know it's the Lord's timing is perfect and you know usually if you know brother Matt he gets his moose in the first hour of the first day and then the rest of us have to walk around wondering where the rest of them went and he didn't get his until yesterday morning and so they're all busy you know trying to get the Moose ready and packaged up and taken over to The Butchers and whatnot so they couldn't leave and then last night brother Mark got a call from from Central new land and a brother there his son-in-law wanted to be baptized and it needed to be done this week because he was leaving on the boats for 5 weeks so I believe God just held the Moose back until brother Matt and brother Joe could could be in a position in a time where they could go so at 8: this morning they met up met up with him and they baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is Brother Jared he's a 24 year-old young man married to brother Derek but's uh daughter so they just had some fellowship with them in carmenville baptize them and then they're on their way in this morning so we certainly just see that uh you know we talk about patience patience is understanding that God has a will and a time and not being worried when it doesn't happen the way that we want to and to see that this who knows who knows what could happen to that young man in the next 5 weeks maybe it had to be now but in a time and in a season he had somebody there that was able to baptize that young man and maybe they were sitting there frustrated out don't know you know it gets down to the wire many times and it not didn't get down to the wire for their sake it got down to the wire so that God could do something for that young man's life amen so we say praise the lord we see you preach on it and then God does something like that and you just say God does all things well amen so we're thankful for that brother Ellie God bless you this morning I didn't see you when I walked out but it's good to see you amen this morning also uh brother Bob and sister Brenda will be traveling this week so we want to remember them I'm traveling as well so just keep each one of us in prayer I know Jeremiah is sick also this morning so just pray God's grace to him amen second Peter chapter 1 very familiar scripture force of course says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness amen God bless you you can have your seats I guess brother Columbo is not here I just saw from the back when I walked in I assumed it was brother Columbo but I guess it's just Ellie and sister Alisa is that right okay very good God bless you both amen we're continuing our Series this morning on on manifesting time and I want to take a a subtitle this morning of the heritage of deity amen the heritage of De deity and we're going to be speaking on this attribute of godliness this morning and brother Brandon would take us in a number of different messages on this attribute of God godliness he take us into Matthew 5 and he where where Jesus said this be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and then he would say in the Statue of a perfect man he says fifthly now add godliness now what does godliness mean godliness means to be like God he says oh my after you get Faith and virtue and knowledge Temperance patience then be like God he says woo you say I can't do that he says oh yes you can now there's a mystery if ever there was one because we're speaking of the attributes of a Christian and this is before the Holy Ghost this is before the holy ghost that comes at the very end that's charity that's love and yet Peter's telling us we have to have godliness and Jesus is telling us you have to have godliness before you even have the Holy Ghost now that's a mystery if ever there was one but I want to start out by saying this your ultimate Perfection is never realized in this world in this time in this Fallen body we're we're born in sin we're sh shaped in iniquity and our our soul is saved our soul is sealed and our our mind is changed and our our heart is is replaced with another one but yet we're always in a body that's going to fight us and so we cannot come to perfection in this body physically speaking because this body will hold us back Amen on this Earth We're constrained by the physical body that we're living in and we still make mistakes and we're still fighting every day and some days we win and some days we lose and and we've got to be able to accept that that is not the perfection that would keep us out or put us in that's not what he's talking about here I mean full adoption Paul said isn't until the Redemption of our bodies full redemp adoption isn't until we actually get out of here because that's where we have nothing holding us back where we've been brought back to our original place as Sons and Daughters of God that's full adoption is when you're back to your eating condition but the scriptures would say that only god is perfect only God is Holy only God is righteousness and those are attributes we cannot hope to have in ourselves ESP especially without the Holy Ghost but yet the scripture is say telling us that we're supposed to be perfect now brother Brown would say this he says so who can say that this is Holy and that is Holy there's only one thing holy and that's Jesus Christ the son of the Living God who has been made perfect and then he says and our requirement is to be perfect he says there's only one and then he says but your requirement is to be perfect as well now how are we going to be it he says try it yourself I'd hate to try to get to heaven on the merits of I was born 5 minutes ago and I'm going out of the world right now basically saying you're born and you die and that made you perfect and so you could go to heaven he says I'd be lost if I never had an evil thought in my life if I never spoke a bad word in my life if I never looked at anything evil never thought anything evil or nothing I'm just as Rank and black as the smudy walls of hell he says I'm a sinner he says I could come through life and be locked up in a room like some of the carlite sisters or something never see the world stay in there pray all my life do good born a millionaire give to the poor everything I've got and I'm still a sinner and will go to hell I might join the Lutheran Church Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian when I'm on the Cradle role and live faithful to that church until a 100 years and my life is taken and no man could Point their finger at me and say he's never ever had as much as a bad thought he says I'll go to hell just as sure as I'm standing that means we're doomed we're Fallen we're sinful no matter what we do our very existence speaks of sin and if you know what the original sin is then you understand that your very existence today not being by the spoken word of God sh says that you're sinful you you've gone against the way that God had meant things he says I'm a sinner that's correct I have nothing so don't try and bring anything I have nothing he says there's no way at all I can find any price to be paid God required death and if I give my own life if I give my life then how can I Repent he says the debt has got to be paid first and God was the only one who could lay his life down and take it up again so he could become sin lay his life down and pick it up and call it justice he says and the debt is paid that's where our rest is that's where our hope is is that the price has been paid and God has accepted it he says they say nobody can be perfect the Bible said none is there is none perfect he says there's your contradiction you cannot be perfect in yourself but then he clarifies he says if you're trusting in what you've done you're lost he says so be ye perfect even just as perfect as god is perfect so in ourselves we're hopeless to produce this attribute of godliness this Perfection that he's speaking of the attribute of godliness in its in its fullness takes a working of God it takes the holy spirit in our life and it's a process it's always a process all these things as we showed a few Services ago it starts small and it grows big your Faith starts small and then it grows big then on top of that your virtue small and it grows big and each one is growing as the other grows beneath it as the foundation grows everything else can grow with it and so there's a process to this and Paul would talk about this in Hebrews 6 he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection so you did something and it was right but he says you've got to go on to Perfection he says not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctr doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment what's he talking about it's right teaching it's obedience all those things they're foundational but they're not life they're right but they're not righteous they're good but they're not perfect but they are a part of the working of God he says but what is that Paul said it's all dead Works he's referring to the scripture he says it's something that you do it's right you're supposed to do it but it's still just dead works because the priest could do it he says now let's go on to Perfection oh my we're coming into the Tabernacle not the foundation the Tabernacle itself remember we're talking about the building up of the dwelling place of God he said that's the foundation the law the righteousness joining Church being baptized laying out of hands they're all orders of the church but now let's go into Perfection he says and there's only one place that is perfected and that's Jes Jesus we're talking about being a dwelling place for God and Paul said make sure you go all the way to the person of Christ amen what is that that's the Holy Ghost he says you this is all good and it's foundational but you've got to go to the person before you can ever come into Perfection but it's leading you into these things Romans 8:1 says this and brother this is where brother brandham starts to take us he says there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and then he repeats that line and then he says that the things that he says that who walk not after the flesh he says the things that they see walking by sight he says everything that you see with your eyes is Earthly but it's the things you see in your spirit through the word he says the word is God's looking glass that reflects what he is and what you are he says hallelujah oh my it tells you there is the only book in the world that tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going he says show me any page of literature anywhere with all the science or anything else every good book that's been written none of it can tell you that this is God's looking glass that shows you what he is and what you are now catch this last line he says then in between there is the bloodline that shows what you can be how if you make the choice he says there you are we're looking at this idea of godliness and brother B saying you've got a choice to make and you look at the word of God and you see what it says about you you see what it says about him he says and you've got to decide are you interested in being it or are you not interested in being it and that's a choice it's a conscious choice you may be a child of God but you get to choose when you start acting like one that's a conscious choice because remember you hear the word and you hear acts 238 and that's a that that's a physical hearing but then you got to make a conscious choice to repent you've got to make a choice for that then you've got to make a choice to get baptized and then you've got to make a choice to physically and emotionally and spiritually and mentally pursue the baptism of the Holy Ghost until you get it you've got to choose what you want you got to choose how far you're going to go and when you're going to go now if you're a child of God God's going to work with you and and he's going to you know he's going to guard you he's going to protect you he's going to put you in a place he if you're a child of God he's going to bring you to a place where you'll make the right choice but you'll still make the choice you still have free moral agency but he'll bring you to a place amen we're T we know that this whole series is leading to the thought of adoption and we're very much now in the season of making the choices that'll decide do we come into adoption or not because remember you can be a child of God and never come to adoption very clearly the scripture teaches that you look in first Corinthians 3 I think it is where it says that every man's work is going to be tried and there's going to be some come in and they don't have anything they have something but it doesn't withstand the fire of God and all they're left with is their soul so they don't lose their soul but they bring nothing with them they never came to adoption they wasted everything God gave them amen but this statue of the perfect man is before our adoption it's the time where we're under a tutor and we're being taught and we're making our our decisions and it's really our spiritual teenage years if I could put it that way the statue of a perfect man is where you're spiritually a teenager you know and as a child we make choices and and if we make enough of the right choices that's when we become an adult see the law says you're an adult at 18 or 21 depending on where you live and you get to make choices there and nobody else can take it from you but you're not truly an adult until you make adult decisions and choices until you start choosing what an adult would choose you're not an adult you could be a 50-year-old child today if you don't make the right choices amen but we have a choice to make every day of our life and those choices are on us not on God we get to choose what we're going to do with every moment of our life brother R would say this speaking of Ed Adam and Eve he says now he had to let them get lost he had to let them sin he put them on free moral agency he could not make them sin and remain God and then punish them for something he made them do but when he put man on partnership with him then let man act as a free moral agency the same thing he's got you on today see you act any way you want to you're a free moral agent so therefore he if he put it the first like that he has to put the second like that he has to put everyone like that or he act acted wrong in the first place see but everybody is on the same basis so we're children of God but we still have to have a a make a choice and the choice is when we look in the word will we start acting like what the word says we are or will we continue in our own thoughts and preferences and the the carnality of this body that we're in like I said if God you're a child of God God's going to work with you every child of God he's going to be corrected he's going to be tested he's going to be tried but you're going to decide how quickly this moves across Absol absolutely cuz God I've said it before he'll take you around the mountain you keep making the wrong decision he'll take you around the mountain and around the mountain and around the mountain until you make the right decision and you go where you're supposed to go God's got all the time in the world he's got all the time in the world he's not worried if you're not going to make the right choice he's going to get you to the place where you'll make it of your own free will but the thing with God is he'll start tightening up the screws and he'll make it more and more desperate he'll make it more and more difficult he'll make it hurt more and more because he's trying to get you to make the decision on your own so that you can progress in your in your in your life with him amen but our choice to be a child of God is a choice that we make every day every day it's no different than our choice to be married our choice to love our spouse to love our children we decide that every day it's something we've got to do amen but we're speaking on the side of the heritage of deity and I want you to understand that if you're a child of God then you have the attributes of God built into you you have the DNA of a child of God spiritually speaking that's built into you and the statue of a perfect man is the Holy Spirit the tutor drawing those things out to prove what's inside of you so that he can now come down and start to fill you with these things but no child of God is born without purpose or intent not a single one and we'll see that as we get into Ephesians and these different places is that God attaches a role and a responsibility and a purpose to every single name that's on the Lamb's Book of Life we all have a purpose and some of us have bigger roles and some of us have smaller roles but if you take any anything in your body the smallest things are sometimes the most critical you look at the the capillaries the tiny little U blood vessels that go out to your extremities you take those out and your your body will start to to rot the tiniest thing single cells flow through there and if you take them away then you start to rot your fingertips and your toes and then it starts to creep its way in every single one of us is needed that's why it matters who's in the body and who's not cuz if you're not and we need then the body suffers the body suffers if we're not in our place amen but this term godliness brother Bram he says it means to be like God and it has many different aspects to it and I want to focus more on what he focused on in stature of a perfect man because the the the the term of godliness is really the attribute of being able to receive the word of God which is the will of God and act on it by Revelation be ye perfect as your father's perfect and then he said there's only one perfect and that's Christ so Christ's actions Christ's way that he lived his life is godliness personified in flesh if we could put it that way now remember if you come from God you'll hear God that's a simple thing Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and so you're built you're tuned to hear the voice of the word if you're a child of God now listen my kids know my voice and we can be in a crowd and they can hear me speaking amen we're in a place where there's many voices today in this world but if we're in a place and they hear me speaking they know that's dad and though there are many fathers speaking maybe there's only one that's their father and when they hear me they say that's my dad and they can follow my voice and they can come find me in a crowd they they talk about the Penguins you know and there's millions and hundreds of thousands of these things in one spot and as soon as the chick is Born the parents speak to that chick over and over and over again and they have a particular song a particular sound that they make and and the chick becomes tuned to the parents and they can find it and it can find them in a crowd of hundreds of thousands of penguins because what they're tuned to only one voice and it's the same thing for a child of God Amen is we're tuned to hear the voice of God we're tuned to hear the word of God and godliness is the ability to recognize who God is and what he does and what he's expecting from us that's what it means but how can you be Godly unless you know who God is how how can you know how God acts unless you you've seen how God acts how can you have godliness unless you're taught what it looks like how can you have godliness unless you're a part of God let me put it that way because you can't be Godly unless you got something of God in you that's impossible because we're not we're not black birds putting peacock feathers in us remember you have to be God to have Godly attributes that's the simple fact of the truth and brother Brandon would cover this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed we'll touch on a little bit amen but this idea of godliness and being a part of God brings us all the way back to Eden because this was the great dilemma for Eve in the Garden of Eden was that she felt that she was being held back from being like God she felt that she wasn't the way that God was and this is what you know Adam was made in the image of God he was made in the likeness of God he was the son of God Amen he was perfect in his form and then God came down he said it's not good for him to dwell alone and so he took out of that man a portion of that man the exact same DNA the exact same Supernatural Heritage that Adam had and he formed a body around it and he built a woman that was no less Supernatural than Adam she was of the image of God but Adam was the masculine attributes now she was the feminine and she was a she was as much an expression of God as Adam was she was just a further revealing of God if we could put it that way that's what we're seeing today isn't it a further revealing of God in a bride body but if we go back we start to see that they were amateur Gods brother Bron would say that that Adam and Eve were amateur gods and that they have full dominion over the Earth they didn't have it over the rest of the universe they didn't have it for different planets or anywhere else but they were in a place where they were a God for that place and they had full control over the elements and the animals and the plant life and everything they had full dominion over where they were but we see that they lost it and if we can look at how they lost it we can see how we can get it back so if we go to Genesis 3 it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman y ha God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die that was his lie it says for God do know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil now notice the Serpent's temptation to Eve was at God's holding back God's making himself a leak God's placing himself above you God doesn't want you to be exactly the way he is that was his temptation to Eve his temptation to Eve was you're going to be as God you know what he was 100% right because the fact is remember Eve was God on Earth with Adam and she went from being God to as God like God but not God he didn't lie that she would be as God but what happened was she failed to recognize her position and he's he then tempted her he fooled her into thinking that she could come up higher when really she was already where she needed to be and he was going to drag her down lower amen everything he said there was 100% correct but she missed that she was an amateur God that she was God on this Earth amen and that's what we'll find with Satan every single time he never tells us who we really are he'll try and make you think there's a higher plane he'll tell there's a deeper depth there's going to be something that he can offer you but he'll never tell you that you're a blood bot born again sinless son or daughter of God he'll never tell you that you're the bride of Christ that you're the revealing of the word for this age he'll never tell you that but he'll tell you I've got something better for you and God's holding back remember what it said about Adam it says it's going through the lineage he said he was the son of Enos which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God Adam was the literal First Son of God on this Earth in a physical body he was the first one and he fell from that now remember this the the the this the serpent told Eve he says you're going to you're going to become as God he didn't tell her she was going to lose her position he didn't let her realize that amen but it didn't mean anything to her because she had forgotten her position in the first place she didn't perhaps even realize that this is what it means to be a God that this thing that's so normal to me this thing I have every day is actually being a God she didn't know what she had she didn't know who she was and so as soon as the serpent got her alone he could fool her but remember he didn't fool Adam Adam knew who he was he knew who God was he knew what the word was and he stuck to it and so he joined himself to her brother Ram says he quickly joined himself to her so that God wouldn't destroy them and he was trusting that God would work it all out later but the serpent separated Eve away and if if only temporarily she forgot who she was God will separate you from fellowship he'll separate you from the word he'll separate you from these things that help keep us aware of who we are and we'll get into how he does that amen but he says this brother Bram says when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate he says and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornications with the WIS world of man's Wisdom rejecting the authority of God's word the Bible said committing spiritual fornications and any word in the Bible That's rejected or of any self interpretation is put to it it's absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the god that is your husband that's serious that's serious he says an adulterous never enters the kingdom of heaven we know that see now see that's what Eve did at the first place so Eve lost her godliness and she became as God instead she knew right and wrong she knew good and evil but she didn't have the authority didn't have the power she didn't have the position that she had before listen God dogs produce brother Braham said God dogs produce dogs cats produce cats Gods produce Gods God produces Gods we're meant to be Gods we're meant to be the very expression of God on this Earth amen the scripture says we're going to rule with him we're going to reign with him we're going to sit in his throne but it's in a future tense but we've got to go through this process of adoption this process of the Statue of a perfect man to be restored to that place and now Peter's coming back around he's saying you've got to come back to that godliness you've got to come back to what knowing who you are youve got to come back and know who he is and you got to recognize your place in it and when you do that then godliness starts to flow through you because to be like God you've got to recognize that you're a part of God Peter saying you got to recognize what's going on that this isn't just an emotion that this just isn't an experience but this is the literal life of God coming back into us to restore us back to Eden this is the working of God amen we've got to know where we're going we've got to know where our purpose is how by the word of God he gave us a word of God so that we know these things amen there's always a process the the whole development of a child of God is a process and God shows it through the scriptures now brother Romy would take us back to Ephesians 4 when he's preaching on statute of a perfect man and this thing of godliness and this is how he says we get to Godliness he says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for what purpose for the perfecting of the Saints remember the scripture says Jesus said be ye therefore perfect this is how you get perfect in the sense that Christ meant it he says it's for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ until we all come all of us we don't get to look down at the person next to us we can't get out of here until they are ready to go so let's not look down but let's pull up let's work together let's have patience with each other let's support each other amen we've all got to get out of here we can't get out till every one of our children has the Holy Ghost impossible they've got to have a new birth amen till every one of us is found in our position in place in the body of Christ but this is the tie in here in Ephesians 4 between second Peter 1 which is the attributes of the statute of a perfect man and Paul's tying it in he's saying you get there by the hearing of the word of God you'll find that's the the the Common Thread between all these things the word of God can't lie and the word of God says that God has Anointed God has appointed God has ordained a fivefold Ministry to perfect the body of Christ through the preaching of the Gospel that's what the word says amen and every single one of those Ministries is required to perfect us and I said this recently and I I'll say it again I have heard a minister say recently that we don't need evangelists anymore that we don't need prophets anymore that the word put it in there and I don't see where he took it out brother Brandon would say he says because people would say well it's only for the days of the Apostles the Holy Ghost is only for that Divine Healing is only for that and all these different things and brother Ram said I can show you where he put it in you show me where he took it out so that means today we still need prophets Apostles evangelists teachers and pastors not a word Prophet but there is the position of prophets in the body God has men that have prophetic gifts inside the body absolutely so we don't throw those away but a word Prophet is completely different so we're not trying to preach something like that but every single one of these things is happening is supposed to be happening in the body of Christ because I don't know and those ministers don't even know what's going on in people's lives but God sends us a message for the people and that's why we're supposed to pray and that's why we're supposed to study until we felt laid led to go in a direction because God knows all things things I don't know what's going on in your life I know what you tell me and even then it can be tempered or Changed by your feeling on it or your thought on it or your perception but God knows what we truly need so he sends a Ministry to us to meet the need that's what's happening and sometimes it takes an evangelist to meet the need and the pastor can't do it sometimes it takes a teacher to meet the need we've got all these different needs in our bodies and God knows what we truly need and he'll send anointed man to feed us for those things godliness requires knowing who God is and that takes an evangelist and that takes a missionary to tell you who the true God is remember Paul was going through the Gentile Nations and he came to a place and they were worshiping the unknown God he said how about I tell you who God is that's their work is to tell them who Christ is and get him to a place of saving but then you've got to know who you are and that's usually the work of a pastor and a teacher and then sometimes we need to know the direct will of God for a situation and that's the work of a prophet cuz they can go and they can get a direct word from the Lord and they can come back and say thus sayeth the Lord You're supposed to do this or don't do that they can do it absolutely every single one of them is needed and every one of those roles is for the perfecting and edifying of the body not for themselves not to build up a Ministry not to build up a comfortable living but it's for the sake of the people Amen brother R would say this he says faith cometh by hearing then God has set in the church upon Apostles prophets evangelists teachers and pastors all for the Perfection of the Saints now watch what he's doing he says now if he can get a hold of your heart then he can work his works there are some things the pastor can't deal with in your life so he sends an evangelist he sends a teacher maybe he sends another Pastor in we've got to be okay with that but he knows how to what get a hold of your heart so that he can do his work he says but as long as you get yourself out of the way as long as you can relax yourself and let the Holy Spirit take over he said I'm the vine you are the branches and the vine doesn't bear fruit but it energizes the branch to bear fruit and he says this is what the ministry of the word is doing is it's God speaking to you and it's energizing you if you can relax yourself get yourself out of the way then the word can come in and it can start to have an effect in your life what's the effect what's the effect of of anointed Ministry Paul continued in Ephesians 14 he says that we henceforth be no more children we grow up watch what he says we're not now CU this is what children are tossed to and fro up one day out the next down the next in one day out the next emotional one day and completely depleted the next up and down in and out there's no constancy to a child children have Tantrums right children love us one day and hate us the next or so they say right nobody wants to be working with children all the time when it comes to spiritual because you can't depend on them he says they're carried about by every wind of Doctrine one Minister rolls through and we follow that one then the next one roll through and we follow that one and then the next one the next one the next one he says by the Slate of men we easily manipulated he says and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but watch what we are he says but speaking the truth in love we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ that's what it looks like to be in godliness he says from what from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love the most difficult scripture that you can ever read what does that mean in the amplifi says from him the whole body the whole church and all its various parts is joined and knitted firmly together by what every joint supplies that means that what happens is as you come into a body the body recognizes your need and your fit and that's what joins you in cuz you're not a child you're an adult you you have purpose you have meaning you have the strength and the maturity to step in and fulfill a role that's what draws us together is that we recognize how you fit into the body we all have a part to play he says when each part is working properly so we might recognize a gift but it's got to be in operation properly that's a continuous growing process God's always working on us he's always working on us it says and when each part is working properly it causes the body to grow and mature building itself up in unselfish love godliness you'll see unselfishness is a great deal to do with godliness the preaching of the word is meant to restore us back to our position in Christ and we preached on this many times how our names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and God's entire purpose of giving us this word is to bring us back to what he said about us to our position in Christ to our place with God before it All Began amen it's to restore us to our even condition and he's got us to got to get us to recognize him so that we can recognize ourself in him and then the two of those things start us on a journey that brings us back to our Perfection and it's only through a perfect sacrifice that we can do that Amen brother Brown would say this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says what's his purpose now Express himself as a son see and now that in him might dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily all through the scriptures that's what God's purpose was then through this life of this son his cross the blood it says here of his cross that he might reconcile to himself a body a bride which is Eve the second Eve the same thing he did in Adam and Eve giving a type that they were Christ and the bride he says he is the second Adam the church is the second Eve so he has to he had to succeed where Adam failed willingly Adam fail willingly Christ had to succeed willingly and that was through surrender it was the same sacrifice but but because he was imperfection then his had the effect that it was supposed to have amen but we know this that not all who hear this gospel will respond we preach the gospel as if everyone's going to be saved but we know that not everyone is amen there are children of God and then there's everyone else and that's hard but it's true and I can say it because we don't have any visitors this morning but it's true that not everyone that hears it is a child of God Jesus said as much in John 8 he says Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and come from God neither came I of myself but he sent me he says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word that word here means hearken obey and consider he says you can't even consider my word it wasn't even in them to stop and think that he might be right because there was nothing in them to respond to it in the first place you would think that as a as as a group of ministers as a group of priests that they could at least sit back I mean they they love to debate the the Jews love to debate they they love to sit down and go through the word and yet the word in flesh stands in front of them and they wouldn't even stop to consider is he right they couldn't do it it wasn't in them to do it they rejected it without consideration he says ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he's a liar and the father of it he said and because I tell you the truth you believe me not why because it's not in you the truth is not in you you can't respond to it he says which of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God ouch what an indictment you can't hear my words because you are not of God Jesus would say in Luke 10:21 and brother Brandon would reference this he says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent wise and prudent in their own eyes they weren't truly wise and prudent but in their own eyes they were he says and you have revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight brother Brown would say this way he says so but God has purposed that and hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent and wise and revealed it to the predestinated babes he says who were predestinated to receive it that's the reason watched out through the age whatever that light hit s some they turn it away and it flashed away they each one heard it but they rejected it and so it just went on to the next one he says great intellectuals and those great priests standing there there were rabbis from great teachers and Authority like Nicodemus and them the man Polished in scholarship and he couldn't even understand it the ministry of that day the priesthood of that day they couldn't listen to Jesus because they were not of the heritage of Jesus there was no deity in them there was no God in them amen they were they were those that heard Jesus and then there were those that heard him gladly they all heard but only a certain group heard him gladly why because they were of him amen they came from the same Source they were from the same family bloodline spiritually speaking they came from God and just like Christ they'll go back to God and now Christ is there preaching to them to help redeem them and bring them back to God and only some of them can hear it and some of them can receive it taking us over to Psalms 82 we're coming back to this s of godliness and tying this all together he said David said God stands in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods we'll see that the congregation of the mighty and the gods are the same group and it's the children of God he says how long will you judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked St he says defend the poor and fatherless do justice to The Afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the Earth are out of course who's they the poor and needy the fatherless The Afflicted those that are in darkness they they don't understand they're walking in darkness and he says the world's out of course the world is out of kilter the world is messed up the world is in chaos and he says but I have said ye are gods and all of you are the of the most high the whole earth scripture says it's groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God now I'm jumping way ahead in this series but let me tell you they're not groaning for the manifestation we had before the Rapture because that doesn't change the earth everything that changes is only temporary look at brother brandham brother Bram steps into adoption remember and he's going across that field and there's a bull there and he comes up and he arouses the bull and he angers the bull because the bull owns the field and brother brandham an adopted son of God now he apologizes to the bull for waking him up for disrupting him but he says I'm on a mission for the Lord so he says you will have to go back and lay down cuz I've got something to do for the Lord he says in the bowl kind of shook his head a couple times and then he went and laid down and didn't even look at brother brandham as he continued on what did he do he restored that bull back to that Bull's eating condition but let me tell you the next time a person walked in that field that bull was right back to where he was before right temporarily there was a manifestation of a Son of God effect on that bull but it didn't stick it out that bull went back to being a mean killer but as in the presence of an adopted son of God it would have an effect but it wasn't a lasting effect the Earth's groaning for a lasting effect and that doesn't come until we're out of here and we come back and there's a millennial rain really it doesn't come back until the whole thing is is is completely burned with fire and then we rain with him eternally cuz that's when there's no more sin left remember Satan's Bound by by by chains of uh there's nobody left for him to change of circumstance I believe brother Braham said because there's nobody left for him to use in the Thousand-Year Reign amen and the the cattle lie down and the they they'll eat straw and the the Sheep will lie down with the the line and these different things but then it's all destroyed and it all comes back in a perfect way it's complete and total restoration amen but he says I've said you are gods and all of you are children of the most high the the scripture is surrounded as we see here where God is rebuking the children of God because they're not doing what he said to do he sent his word to them he said you need to step up there are people that need you there are situations that need you there's people that can't get anywhere unless you step into your position and if you finish out that scripture he says and you don't do it and so they're going to die just like men and so are you because you didn't step into the word of God the people need help and unless the children of God step into their position then they can't be helped then we come to Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians 5:5 and it says this ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness amen we're supposed to be a beam of hope we're supposed to be a light a shining light that people can see Jesus said a light that's on a hill cannot be hid we don't put it under a bushel God doesn't hide who we are people ought to be able to see us amen and they ought to be able to see that we live by something different than they live and it's by the word of God amen they ought to see us as an example of obedience of humility of leadership and all these things they ought to see us as a place to go when they have questions and concerns you know what you'll find that often in the workplace they'll talk to everyone else about everything else but when it comes down to where things really matter in life you know where they usually come to the believer cuz you've got it together they see that you've got a marriage that works they see you've got good kids they see that you've got a way that seems to handle the pressures and the failures of life or keeps you out of them in some cases and so they go to us and they say how do you do it we're supposed to be obvious amen we're not supposed to be just hearers but we're supposed to be doers of what we hear amen the people in Psalms 82 they didn't do it and they failed to achieve what God had purposed for them and other people suffered because they didn't step into their role amen you can't be in darkness and help somebody that's in darkness you can't be in sin and help a sinner amen you got to be at a place where you can pull them out if you're not walking in light you can't help anybody that's in darkness James said this he says but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only but look how he he finishes it he says deceiving your own selves it's striking to me that when we don't act it the only one we're fooling isn't the only one I'm fooling is me because we don't fool anybody else around us we can be known as a great talker but if we're not a great doer then people will figure out pretty good that we're just a big bag of hot air remember we read in I think it was in the in the temperance service we did recently brother Bram said let someone cross you up one time and that'll show who you are let somebody do something that they really ought not to do let somebody hurt your feelings let somebody take credit for something you've done whatever it might be let somebody do something badly to you and then see what comes out they'll see real quick whether we're Christians or Not by how we respond to those things but we come to Jesus day and he takes us back to the scripture that's what I love about Jesus is he was the word and the word comes to the word and the word always refers to the word and he would take us back time and time again he lived by the word he fulfilled the word he died by the word he rose by the word all of his life was by the word and it was an example to us amen of how it ought to just flow through our lives Jesus said this in John 10 he says I and my father are one what a statement then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him they were always trying to Stone Jesus they picked him up again that means they picked him up earlier and they laid them down and now they picked them up again we're going to offend people by by our claim you claim you're a child of God people don't mind that you say I'm the word made flesh for today look out look out they won't accept it they won't accept it but you're supposed to be and you will be the word of God manifested for today he says the Jews took up stones again to Stone him you notice the only ones that want to Stone were religious people he says Jesus answer them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of these Works do you stole me I've done a bunch of good things what are these good things that I've done that's offended you and then the Jews answered him saying for good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou that thou being a man maketh thyself God Jesus is saying I've done all these good things you're stolen me for this they said no no no it's that you make yourself God and you're in flesh I I don't I sometimes wonder what they thought Messiah was going to be if not God in flesh then what was it Moses was as close as you could get to God in flesh and Christ comes and he does way more than Moses ever did fulfills every aspect of the scripture and then they come and say sorry you're not allowed to be it you're not allowed to be the manifestation of the word for this day you're not allowed to be the Messiah why because it didn't line up with what they thought it was going to be why because it didn't what affirm them in their position and place jealousy is what caused them to do these things Envy amen and so they had to deny claim and that meant what he was saying was blasphemy instead of Prophecy being fulfilled but they didn't stop Prophecy from being fulfilled he was still the word made flesh amen they denied him being in flesh they denied the manifestation they denied the deity of God in flesh that's what they did they literally turned down God in flesh they couldn't accept it but jesus takes them right back to the scripture and he takes us to Psalm 82 which we just read and it says Jesus answered them and said is it not written in your law that I said ye are gods he says if he called them Gods now watch the definition if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou Blasphemous because I said I am the Son of God Jesus said the definition of a God is that it is a person to whom the word comes Jesus putting it right back in their laps he's saying you're saying that flesh cannot be deity but yet your word says that flesh is deity and not just one but many not just one person but there's many of you are Gods when it comes to the truth of the matter amen what is it he says the defining characteristic of a child of God is that the word comes to you remember the word comes to many people but it's sent to an elect group behold I send you Elijah the prophet if you don't recognize him as Elijah the prophet he wasn't sent to you if you don't recognize your day and its message it wasn't sent for you but it's sent for a purpose but it's like the parable of the net Jesus said where the net goes out and it catches a bunch but they only take the ones that will sell they only take the ones that they want from market and it's the way the word of God goes It goes out and it catches some but only a few are really meant to be in there and that's the ones that come through the whole process this attribute of godliness is demonstrated in the ability to hear the word and act on it many people hear it many people hear it but the ability to act on the word of God by Revelation when you're a child of God and the word of God is preached it has an effect on your life not just on your mind it changes our thinking it definitely changes our thinking but it has to come from here into here and it has to be lived out in our lives amen it brings our thoughts into subjection it tells us to lay down our rights it tells us to lay down our emotions and to stay with what the word says cuz that's going to have the lasting effect that's what's going to bring us into our fullness as Sons and Daughters of God Amen God subject to his own word god bound himself to his word and how can we as his children do any less we're Bound by the word of God and this godliness attribute is the attribute that causes us to hear the word and act on the word by Revelation by the quickening of the word by the Holy Spirit that's what it takes in our lives amen not all who hear it but all who are sent it are the go are the children of the Gospel they're the children of God it's targeted for our ears and what he's saying here is if the word of God is brought to you then you are a child of God but if you don't recogn is the word then how can you be a child if you don't recognize of the voice of God how can you be of God cuz my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow they can't even hear it amen the word comes to the word that's the simple truth you're a part of God the word comes to you amen listen we don't always understand it I don't always understand it but something in me responds to it nonetheless I think that's the the most wonderful thing as a child of God is that you can respond to something without even necessarily fully understanding it there's you know David said the Deep calleth unto the Deep there's something in me that responds to what's coming over the pulpit there's something that I respond to when I read this word and even though I don't always get it all I say that's still me that's part of my Heritage that's what I believe and I might only have a part of it at times but yet it's something in me that holds on to it and says that's what I identify with that's me that's my Heritage that's my inheritance that's my DNA amen I didn't choose this he chose me and it's you know I am what I am by the grace of God but I respond to this amen it's our Supernatural DNA that's responding to this word and says that's me I didn't know it and now I do know it I know it in part but there's coming a day when I'll know it in fullness there won't be any Shadow there won't be any mirror in front of me and I'll understand what it's all about John one1 says this speaking of Christ he says he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own Naturally Speaking he came to the children of Abraham naturally he came to the Natural bloodline it says and his own received him not but then it says but as many as received him this is a mixed group look around us we got a mixed group today we got people from all over Canada we got people from all over the world sitting in church today it's a mixed multitude why because we are talking about the Royal Seed of Abraham we're talking about the bloodline of Christ the supernatural spiritual race amen it says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name the power is in you to believe in the first place and then he fills you with power to become what was in there in the first place but you have to have something in there to even respond to it in order to become that thing you respond because you are you don't do not become because you respond but you respond because of what you are you're a son you're a daughter of God he says which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God let me shorten that which were born of God that's how you were born that's how you come into this place that's how you come into this time that's how you come into this message that's how come you can receive what you hear and what you read is because you were born of God and that which is of god responds to God every single time like I said before David said deep calls unto the deep and you're deep and you're responding to your origin your Source of Life anden your father you hear that voice brother bam always uses the chicken in that was born in the eagle or the eagle that was born in the chicken pen and when he hears that eagle voice the first time he says that's me and though he can't Fly Like an Eagle yet though he doesn't know how an eagle eats yet he responds and he keeps working and working and working until he can fly out of that chicken pen and he starts to go up into the Heights and then he can really become the eagle that he was meant to be he always was an eagle but there's a day where he heard the voice amen but what brother Brown's saying with this this idea of godliness is is that we've got a choice of what to do with our sunship we've got a choice to do with being a daughter of God Amen I've got a choice in how I live my life I've got a choice on what I say what I look at what I watch How I spend my day who I spend it with all of these things are choices and like I said before like like like Paul would say in First Corinthians he said every man's work will be tried and it'll be Tried by fire I'm going to make it no matter what because I'm a Child of God I I cannot be lost Jesus said I'm thankful you've given me every one he says and I won't lose a single one okay I cannot be lost there's a that's a form of Eternal uh you know certainty but I can come with something or I can come alone and that's the choice we make as Sons and Daughters of God am I going to come alone or am I going to bring something we going to bring jewels in our Crown to lay at his feet are we going to bring souls are are we going to bring those that would have been lost at those would have been destroyed without us are we just going to walk in and say I'm so thankful for the grace of God here I am give me my eternal life no that's the choice we make every single day what are we going to do with this gift he's given us of what God inside of us of the nature of a son or daughter of God John 8 he said but he that sent me is with me the father ha had not left me alone for I do always those things that please him we look at jesus' life and we see the the the the big highs and we see the scriptures that says and they brought their their sick and their Halt and they're lame and they're blind and they're deaf and he healed them all and we think what a glorious time that must be and then we see the tiredness and The Agony and the abuse that Jesus went through people would use and abuse Jesus they come for the Loaves and the fishes they come for the signs and wonders they come for the this and that but when it really came down to it they used him they abused him and then and they killed him and Jesus said everything I do he said I do it because it pleases you so in the hard times in the worn out times in the painful times when he knew people were using him and yet he would do whatever the father told him to do that's what godliness looks like he says and as he spake these words many believed on him Christ literally died gave his life because that's what he was told to do that's what godliness looks like you'll do whatever he says then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed I love that idea of continuing because what happens is we have an initial experience with God and we repent and we're baptized and there's that scouring out that happens that I hope most of us know and then there's something that works and now God takes us into a sanctification process and he starts to clean up our life and he starts to clean up our relationships and our intents and our desires and all these different things then there comes a point where he fills us with the Holy Spirit but he says you've got to continue no matter where you at you've got to continue don't rest on your laurels don't rest on your Revelation don't rest on your ministry don't rest on where you are but keep pressing toward the prize of the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus because what happens if I could just get a little pastor this morning is we get comfortable in our maturity and we don't grow where we're immature so what does God do he changes our ministry he changes our relationships he changes our location he changes our job he changes our fellowship he changes our financial situation God moves us to a place where he can start to focus on our immaturity rather than resting on our maturity a Christian Life is uncomfortable because he's constantly growing and maturing his bride so what he's saying don't rest on your laurels remember they came to Jesus you know he gave them power over spirits and sicknesses and that and they came back rejoicing he said don't rejoice in that Rejoice that your names are in the Lamb's Book of Life why because Judas wasn't in the Lamb's Book of Life but yet he did all those things you can't rest on where you're at but you got to be thankful you got to be content for what he's given but you got to keep being willing to say Lord grow me change me mature me make me into the fullness of what you meant for me to be he says if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed I love how I can read a Bible you know I I I I cycle through the the four gospels in my devotions constantly I always read those over and over again and then I read a portion in the Old Testament and a portion further on in the New Testament but I love how you can sit there and you can read something you can underline it you can put a note in the margin and then you come read it three or four months later and you say how in the world did I not see that and it's something completely different why because we're continuing in the word we don't just say well I've read it I've underlined it I already know what that means so I must move on to the next one no it's constantly unfolding and it's unfolding so that it can unfold in your life not so it can just unfold in our minds in our heads or in our words amen he says ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free brother BR would would finish with this he only he only gave us five or six uh paragraphs on godliness in this message of stature of a perfect man he says perfect takes godliness but you know what godliness meant Godly always looking for one thing I always do that which pleases the father he says that's godliness why do we come to hear the word of the Lord why do we come to hear preaching in church why don't we just stay at home and and read our Bibles or listen to our messages or do these different things because brother Randon pointed us to Ephesians 4 he says God has placed God has ordained God has appointed God has anointed a variety of Ministries to help bring us to a place of perfection and it's literally the voice of God speaking I was listening to brother Bram speaking he says I'm the voice of God speaking he says now that offended some of you he says but you've got to recognize it's the voice of God speaking I'm not putting anything on myself by no means but I'm saying there's a place that God has ordained for each and every one of us to be fed the word of God Amen and when we come in there then we have what the effect of the washing of the water of the word and it cleans our life up and it puts us in our place amen this is a place where Perfection is put into the body that's what he's doing he's got a five-fold Ministry that is perfecting us that is edifying us that is unifying us it ought to be unifying us amen and they're anointed for your benefit not for theirs they're anointed for your edification not just for theirs amen they're a part of the body every minister is subject to the word of God and they get a benefit from the preaching of the word but it is for the entirety of the body that they're doing it amen God's chosen them as a means of bringing us to Perfection brother Ram says Perfection takes godliness Perfection is a reflection of godliness that's why we preach things that convict no Minister likes to preach on things that convict especially if we know it's in your life who wants that that's conflict but we do it why to get you to straighten up that's why we exhort to to get you to see what God is trying to do and what God wants us to do in our lives amen it's why we preach things that remind us of our position in Christ to elevate your thinking to elevate your desires to put you in a place where you start to think like God wants you to think that's why we do those things why we preach repentance to keep our lives clean to keep us from walking too far down a road that's going to take us to a place of pain or destruction or hurt or these different things amen it keeps us from following a path of our own choosing all of these things have to pre preached and it takes a different type of ministry to do certain ones of those amen but it keeps us moving into Perfection which is godliness amen let's stand together if we would the musicians can come you know I said that before Christ comes back he doesn't touch this this Earth we go to meet him in the clouds men the dead in Christ rise first and then we rise and we meet them in the air nobody's going to see Christ the only Christ they're going to see is in you and me the revealing of the word today if I could put it this way the only God they're going to see is in the last AG bride that's the only thing they're going to see is in you and I amen the world won't see him the only thing they can see is you and I and that's the only testimony they're going to get yes they can see signs and wonders they can see healings they can see these acts of God but dayto day walking down the Street Christ ain't doing it it's in you you're the only hope that they have Jesus said this in Matthew 5:14 he says ye are the light of the world you're the light of the world you're the light of the world each and every one of you is the light of the world how's your light looking these days can the world look at us and see do they know who we are amen do people know what you are if we got godl he says you can't you can't be hid people are going to know it they ought to know these things things as they look at us they ought to see the effect I mean we're in a Godless world I mean we're in a a world that's full of gods but not the true God if I could put it that way I mean you look at what people are worshiping they're worshiping music they're worship I mean it's insane it's insane when you stop and look at what the world is worshiping today music and movie stars and athletes and the things that go that people focus on and they're fanatical about it our our fitness our ambition our career uh whatever the world is is is absolutely led by so many things how do you know what's your God whatever you're serving whatever your purpose is for a day is your god and the world has so many different gods am me they have so many different things that they're worshiping but they ought to be able to see that we don't worship the things they worship that we don't live the way that they live they don't that we don't make decisions the way that we make decisions they ought to see the constancy of a gospel life in our lives amen that's what godliness looks like is we can catch the will of God by the word and we can go do it and we can be satisfied in it we can be happy in it we can be joy in it whether it feels good or whether it brings persecution and reproach we can be satisfied with what he's got for us amen first Peter says this ye are a chosen generation chosen not not happen stance you're chosen supernaturally chosen a royal priesthood I I I don't know if anybody's seen have you have you did you hear about the group of mountain bikers that ran into King Charles recently they were in the I think the Scottish Highland somewhere and they were mountain biking down a trail and they literally I mean they didn't literally run into him but they he was walking along the property and so they stopped to talk to him it was King Charles and you know what he was dressed with just a a cap on and kind of some some country clothes and whatnot and he had a stick in his hand but everything everything he did was kingly the way he talked the way he acted his approach his friendliness but yet his slight pullback as well he knew he was a king and he acted like a king no matter what he was wearing no matter the fact that they caught him out with mud on his boots in the middle of the country he acted like a king because he was a king his diction was perfect I loved listening to him talk because everything he said was absolutely perfect why he was a king he's been trained right he's been brought right brought up right scripture says we're Royal we've been brought upright we've been raised by a god we've been raised by a word that's perfect do our lives reflected he says a holy nation my wife was speaking to a woman recently and she said this woman has a a farm out in the country and my wife said you're living my dream and she looked at my wife she said you're living my dream she says you're modest she says I've always had a heart for modesty but I've never done it my wife you know she said to she said to I think someone yesterday she said it's not hard just put a skirt or dress on they're a holy nation we ought to live holy clean pure undefiled from the things of the world Amen he says you're a peculiar people now that one I think we all identify with real quickly don't we we're weird but be weird because you're holy not because you're weird remember I read that quote where brother Ram says don't be weird to be weird you know kind of putting it tightly he said don't be weird just to be weird don't be different for the sake of being different but be different because you live by the word of God you live according to the word of God he says what's the purpose that you should show forth the Praises of him that ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light one last scripture he says whatsoever you do in word or deed do all godl brings us to the place where we can say I did that and I can put Jesus Christ's name after what I just did said my reaction my action whatever it is I can put his name at the end not mine that's what we're talking about that I can say whatever I'm doing today whatever I'm doing now Jesus Christ is happy with it he says do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him amen you say brother Jonathan I'm not there hey we're all growing I'm not saying because I've got it all either by no means amen but we're growing in maturity we ought to see a change day by day week by week month by month amen that God is calling us to a higher plane that God is calling us to a place where everything we do is by his Direction by his word by his inspiration that we can hold when he says hold and we can go when he says go and we're happy to do either one amen amen let's bow our heads each one Lord God Lord we sang at the beginning of this service Lord that when you are in the house Lord that's what makes the difference and Lord we're children of yours Lord you've given us the nature of a god of a holy God of a righteous God of a just God of a sacrificing God of a loving God lord I pray you help us to exhibit it Lord that day by day people would see us Lord Lord that in our words and in our actions Lord that we'd not be talkers only but that we'd be doers Lord of this word that we profess Lord this message that we've received Lord God lord may we be just living Lord fleshly tablets Lord that people could see your word written on day by day Lord may we seek your will seek the leadership of your Holy Spirit Lord God lord may we earnestly earnestly Lord wait on you to see what you would have us to do heavenly father but Lord help us to be quick to catch your voice Lord may we become just so as so so used to it Lord so associated with it Lord that we could block out anything that we hear Lord I pray your grace to us each one Lord let us catch your spirit Lord what is speaking to the church today Lord into our individual lives we ask in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you know many times when I'm in the gym I wear a head my headphones because they're always playing music that is unfit to listen listen to but you know what if I start to focus even through my headphones I can listen to that music I don't want to but sometimes as you move around you'll get right under a speaker and you'll say hey what was that I didn't notice that because I was far away and I didn't hear it but something brought me closer the equipment I was using and I start to hear something and you know what if I focus on it if it's a song maybe that I knew when I was still not serving the lord or whatnot I can focus on that and I can literally drown what's in my ear to catch what is outside but at the same time if I focus on what's in my ear it doesn't matter how loud they play it I can block it out to hear what what what's in my ear I choose what I focus on I choose the voice I choose the music that I'm listening to in every situation that's what we're talking about with godliness I'm making the choice to listen to your word and to obey your voice that's what we're talking about amen let's sing that song I give my mind 11:20 I give my mind completely to you Lord fill me with your thoughts and make it all brand new and change my life and let me live in all that's
