each one and in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen and God bless you turn if you would to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter one and we'll start in verse 11. amen welcome brother Jim Dooley here and Manny made the trip just in special he had meant to be here maybe uh this week or and then wasn't sure and then I said well I'm Gone the rest of the time so I think he just made the trip just to just because I wanted him to come in so I I did promise that I wouldn't promise my wife I wouldn't ask him to minister tonight or exhort us that would be unfair last time he was here if you remember he said he came to have a vacation and listen to Brother John preach and he came and he preached and I went on vacation so so I don't want to do that to them tonight but brother Jim it's always good to see you amen as brother Bob mentioned just to remind you I'm headed to Edmonton tomorrow morning bright and early I'll be gone and back the following Friday so just pray for me as I travel and that God would grant me Grace keep me safe I'll be doing some dangerous things while I'm there in fast Machinery going around a track with other men that are hell-bent on on beating me to the finish line so just trusting God will bless me there I'll be in the special services as well for a bit with brother Ron Spencer and brother Ray Erickson brother Nathan Erickson so just keep those in prayer and I'll be fellowshipping with Brotherhood hammermeister while I'm there as well so just keep me in that amen and I'll be praying for you trusting that brother Paul will be a blessing as he he brings his his Sunday school lesson on on Sunday and then brother Berry coffee Lord willing will minister to us on Wednesday I mean God bless you Genesis chapter 1 and verse 11 says and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself off upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass in her building seat after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're stepping into another series and and really it's just the end portion of the Redemption series and so it's a focus on on Final that final stage and what that looks like and kind of what's going on uh through the word and through the bride and through the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God so I want to start a maybe a a an end phase series called manifesting time manifesting time and I want to take a thought tonight of the certainty of a seed amen the certainty of the seed and we're going to be taking this all the way back to the scriptures and we're going to be looking at this Final Phase of redemption what it looks like how it works how we know we're a part of it and the responsibilities and the benefits that come with being a son or daughter of God in this age amen and like I said last service I'm studying these things and I'm taking a closer look at these things and I'm revising some of these things and I want to be very open about that I don't want to hide and say you know that I had it right I had it right no sometimes we get things wrong and sometimes we just have to come up a little higher amen I I was reading in Revelation where the angel said to John he says here's this and then he says now come a little higher and let me show you other things let me show you greater things that maybe you haven't considered thus far even brother Branham had to grow in his Revelation so I'm not ashamed to say I'm growing in my Revelation that God can correct me that God can add to these things and and show me different things amen if we've got it all figured out we can't be much used to an all-knowing God Amen we we step into his shoes when we do that Amen brother Brown would say this just as a as a preface as we start he would say see God's got it all figured out for us that's the only thing we have to do is just hold on to him and just go right on see that's all he says believing that's all he asked us to do he will take us right through amen and that's what I'm resting today is that as we talk about this thought on the certainty of a seed we're going to take it right back to Genesis 1 and I love it when I can open a series or a thought or a scripture from Genesis 1 because if you can show where it started then you can be sure that it's continued all the way through him and you've got a you've got a real Foundation if you can take it back to the foundation that original book in the scriptures amen so if we look back in this word principle we're opening up this this evening in Genesis 1. it says and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so so in other words we see God here is speaking to the seeds he's speaking to the Earth he's speaking to the creation and he's saying be what you are grow into what is already inside of you break out and become what was determined for you already just bring out what's inside of you that's what the word of God is supposed to do is bring out something that's inside of you already the creative work has already been done here what is is what is and what is is what will be amen there is no changing it after this has gone forth amend God's order God's principle is for a seed to produce what is inside of it now see what Catches Us off so many times is that seeds can lay dormant and we look at it and we say there's nothing coming out there's nothing coming out but see it still has life inside of it even though it's dormant it has life inside of it it has potential inside it and so the fact that it's dormant does not mean it's not a good seed it does not mean it's not a bad seed either it just means that it hasn't been in the right conditions for life yet that's all it means the conditions aren't right but we see here that God set the conditions for the earth to bring forth life and all of a sudden he sets the atmosphere right he sets the temperature right he says the the carbon dioxide and and he sets the the hydrogen and the nitrogen and all these things and he forms this perfect atmosphere and then he brings water to water it and something happens and what happens is verse 12 and you can literally take 11 verse 11 and transpose it into verse 12 and just change from Let It Be to it was because that's the way the word works is it just takes it from a word spoken to a word reality it says in the word brought forth grass and herbuilding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good so voila God speaks it God sets the conditions he speaks this and then he sets the conditions there's often a separation between the speaking and the right conditions but God's in all of it amen and as soon as he sets the right conditions and the seeds produce what was inside of them each one of them was packaged and maybe some of them look very very much the same but they were different when they came out other ones look completely different but notice that the dormancy did not change them the fact that they had laying there for who knows how many days or hours or years or Millennia or whatever it was how long they were laying there that did not alter them in any way whatever God had created by his spoken word in terms of seeds were still the exact same seeds when he finally set the conditions right Amen brother Brandon would say it this way he says now God in 6 000 years have planted all these wonderful seeds or he had spoke his word notice he says he had spoke his word he says it shall be this way this tree shall be this shall be everything was perfect it was just good and he commanded each one of those seeds that they would be that they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word of God had spoken in them should be if it was an oak tree it was to bring forth an oak if it was a palm it was to bring forth a palm he says because the great Creator had just sent forth his word and the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed he says the word formed the seed you've got to catch that principle here because he says before the reality was there there was a word that went forth there was something to call forth that which became reality and it was spoken and before it was spoken we'll see it was a thought and then it became a reality he says the word formed the seed see he made the world out of things that do not appear he made the world by his word God spoke everything into existence and being God the Creator speaking all things into existence it must have been a perfect world he says it was a beautiful place it was a real genuine Paradise here on the earth why because it was Word Perfect it was exactly the way as God had ordained it was exactly the way that God had said it was supposed to be so notice here that the original creation was brought by the spoken word but it was a part of the word itself they are not separate but one is a manifestation of what was spoken amen so that original condition on the Earth was word perfect because it was exactly according to what God had thought and what God had said and then it came into reality it was exactly right but notice why was it right why was it good because everything brought forth of what it was everything brought forth exactly as it was ordained to that was a Perfection of it it was exactly the way it was designed that it came forth we look today and we see how things can vary even within a species and one will be wonderful and fruit bearing in the next seed of that same tree or plant will come out it'll be all gnarled up and it won't produce anything or it'll produce bad fruit or it just won't be able to go through the jail but in the original creation everything brought forth perfectly the way that he had told it to that's the certainty of a seed that's the Perfection of a seed is that it does not change that's the certainty of a seed as it does not change when you plant the seed whatever you plant it will grow it doesn't sit there and change itself overnight it can't change itself even if it had intelligence to want to change itself it cannot change it can stay dormant for a thousand years and you can plant it and it'll produce exactly what it was when you laid it in the ground or you laid it in a seed packet and said sit there until I plant you amen it cannot change itself if you take a seed from an orange you're going to get an orange tree every time it's never going to become a half an orange tree and half an apple tree it's never going to become like an orange maybe an apple tree or or a lemon tree or something in the Citrus thing it cannot do it because the DNA is set within the seed already and it cannot reprogram itself it cannot choose to be something else it must come out based on what it's it's programmed to do here's the thing consider this you take an apple tree and you plant it in the midst of an Orange Grove you think well the influence of the oranges would surely have something on it but no it'll come up an apple tree and it'll be the only Apple Tree in that whole Grove of orange trees but because the seed is in it to be an apple tree it'll be an apple tree that's how we can sit here today and we can be surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people that don't have the seed of God inside of them and we can come up in a desperate age and an unbelieving age and we can be children of God it's because we cannot change what we are we can only be what he said we were going to be he can only be what he said we are amen it doesn't have a choice a seed doesn't have a choice it must produce what it is now we can say yes the environment has an effect on it the size of a tree the shape of a tree how much fruit it produces how fast it grows that is all based on environment if you are in a tree that doesn't have a lot of of sunlight it's not going to grow quickly and it's not going to produce a lot of fruit if you have a tree in a place where there isn't much water and it needs a lot of water it's going to grow very slowly but it will still grow into what it is it doesn't change because the environment changes it just maybe slows it down on the other side you put it in a place where it has lots of water the correct amount of sunlight and it's it's not being surrounded by weed sucking the nutrients out you you put everything it needs into the soil and that tree will grow faster than anything else why it's in the right environment but it's no different than the one that's growing slowly they're the exact same tree they're just in a different environment they're just in circuits in different circumstances because here's the thing all orange trees share one thing they're orange trees they're all orange trees no matter if one just produces one orange all its life or one produces one a day they're both orange trees it's in their DNA so in other words seeds cannot be corrupted seeds cannot be messed with amen a seed is inevitable it cannot change itself even if it wanted to now that's a wonderful thing if you're a good seed isn't it because we're talking about Sons and Daughters of God we're not talking about trees or plants or anything but if you're a good seed that's a wonderful thing it's not so wonderful if you're a bad seed and by bad we mean something that has no value or something that is a life Sucker from something that is amen but we see seeds and we look at them and if we don't know what a seed is based on you know being trained or educated in those things we can look at a sea a seed and we'll see see something's got lumps all over it lumps all over it right it's got Spikes all over it and it's got all those things and you say how can anything good come out of that seed look at it it looks horrible it looks prickly it looks like it just wants to hurt but it's surrounded by something that has nothing to do with what's inside of it what's inside of it is what's inside of and the outside can look horrible and on the inside can be something that is life-giving that's wonderful for us amen the shape of the seed the the appearance of the seed is is not at all something that we take into consideration it doesn't matter it's what's inside it that's really going to determine is it good or is it bad so like I said we're not talking natural seeds we're talking spiritual seeds we're talking Sons and Daughters of God and sometimes we look at the Shell that we have and it can be pretty frankly sometimes it can be pretty lumpy sometimes it can be pretty ugly but guess what it's meant to be ugly it's meant to rot it's meant to die and that's why we don't focus on it but we focus on what's inside we focus on the word that God has given us amen so I want to take us now so we can see our portion in this this evening we want to see the seed principle in us that we cannot be corrupted Paul would say we're born of a seed that's incorruptible amen so if we can see the certainty of a seed in our lives it ought to give us faith that we compress the battle that we can keep moving forward day to day now John would see this John was a wonderful Apostle because he saw things as a prophet he didn't just look at things in terms of what was in front of him but he saw things kind of from beginning to end and he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and so we're looking at the nature of a seed or the certainty of a seed we can see there's something in the beginning in fact we see something that was before the beginning and that was the word and that's what we want to tie ourselves to because if we're going to be here when all of time is over we've got to have been here before time ever began we want to tie ourselves to that word but John he's looking through God's eyes and with the understanding of the Holy Spirit he says before there was anything there was the word amen so that begs the question what is the word what is the word we look at it and we say it's a scripture or or we might say it's this or that but it's the start of everything it's the start of everything it's not just the Bible in print amen but it's the start of everything and so we better know what that word is when it was in its original form not just in the form that we say is the word today brother Brandon would say this he said for his word as we saw this morning has to be fulfilled it is God's thought made manifest by his word and brought to a reality he says now the word was the beginning it wasn't in the beginning it was the beginning everything had an origin everything comes from that word point forward it says but before it was a word he says a word is a thought May manifest God had to think it before he could make it a word then he spoke the word and it materialized so we're talking about this concept of manifesting time and we see here that there's a manifestation that brother Branham is talking about now that word manifest means to make evident or certain by showing or displaying in other words manifest means to materialize and brother but I'm saying here that the word had to be in the thought and then it had to be in the mouth to be spoken and then it had to materialize amen so he's saying a seed word will manifest when it shows or displays what it is that's how you know it's manifesting time is when you show what you truly are so in other words a seed will manifest when it comes to life and grows into its form and produces the same thing that produced it see there is no new seed it's all old seed It's All Original Seed and so you've got to produce what produced you in the first place coming to life just isn't enough that's not what a scene is about you know it's not just growing a little bit because if you plant things I remember in in elementary school we would get we were given those beans remember and we had to grow them but sometimes they give us other things throughout the different years and whatnot and everybody would plant a seed but some of them had beans and some of them had corn and these different things and when both of them came up all they were was a little green sprig that might have had a leaf here and a leaf there and guess what they both look more or less exactly the same just having life is not enough just coming up and breaking out isn't enough but you've got to come all the way to the maturity of what called you out in the first place of what produced you in the first place amen otherwise you just have two plants that look the same you take it back to the scriptures remember of the wheat and the tares and they said listen you've got bad bad bad seed here should we pluck it all up he says no you got to wait till they become mature because otherwise you'll pluck up one that's right in your Zeal to get the one that's wrong that's why we don't do it it's God that's got to do these things amen he sends Messengers to do those things he sends angels to do it but if we take that concept of what the word is it's a thought Express and from that thought has to come A Spoken element and from the spoken element has to come a physical element and brother Brandon would say this he said sitting way back in eternity that was God he says and then going out of God he says or God unfolding himself come the logos which was the son of God or the word of God so brother I'm saying the manifestation of God or the materialization of God is God unfolding himself God revealing himself God unveiling himself he would say it's God projecting himself not just from thoughts but to words and now into a reality or a materialization or manifesting amen the first thing that God pulls himself into is the word and that's what John points us back to the word was a thought first in the mind of God and then he spoke it and that came into being and that being brother Bradham called the logos it was the body it was the spoken word body of God himself it was a body prepared for God and we call that the Son of God we call that the logos and God stepped into that body and that became Christ the anointed one it was the anointing of God inside of a body and that's what we call the logos that's what we call the the the the Jesus Christ the the anointed one so in the beginning was the word in thought form and the Word was with God it was a body created and then he steps into it and now the body becomes God the word because was with God the word becomes God Amen and that is God now manifested in his fullness in the heavenlies nothing has touched the Earth yet this is all up in the heavenlies this is not here but it is Jesus Christ the person of the word he's the materialization of the word in its fullness and everything now is starting to unfold and now it has to come through Christ because he's the fullness of the word being expressed amen so I want to dwell on this thought of what is the word because if you can recognize what the word is and if you can put yourself in it then we've got now we're cooking with gas as they say right we've got something we can work with we can nail that down we've got rest we've got Assurance we've got peace we've got a comfort we've got a faith that what we're going to be is exactly what he said we were going to be well if I would say this he says now first place the word of God is the only plan and the only truth of God about God he says the word is God you understand I'm quoting scripture in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so the word is God now then if God has said something it's up to God to take care of his own word that's probably the greatest quote I could read you is that God takes care of his own word amen if he said it then he's going to do it if he said it then it cannot return to him boy amen that's Isaiah 55 my word will accomplish that which I sent it to and it will prosper Prosper that means it'll produce everything it'll bring a benefit it'll bring a blessing when I send it out it cannot return void God takes care of his word him and so if you're a part of the word it's up to God to bring you forth if you're struggling then it's up to God to bring you through it amen if you're down it's up to God to bring you out because his word has to produce itself amen but it's up to God to take care of it and all he's looking for is somebody to rest on faith and believe that he'll do it to stay there until he does it to let him work in our lives amen brother I would say this he says there is one thing that we're sure he can't do he can't go against his word and remain God he has to keep his word because the word is God and God is identified through his promised word at an age the next thing he says is the word is the absolute amen so it was before anything else came into existence it was the original and everything else therefore is a pretender because it is second there's only one first contrary to what they're teaching kids today there's only one first we don't all get we don't all get participation Awards there's only one first and that is the word that is the absolute that is the original amen Romans 3 4 says let God be true and every man a liar that is our absolute amen now listen he says the word is the expression of a thought it has to be a thought before it can be a word so God in the beginning gave the thought of what would be spoke the word for it to be then we received the word and it produces what God thought it was he said the word is the gospel in seed form so in other words what is and what will be may not look the same it takes time to show this thing to be what it really is there's a time element to the manifesting of the word because God is revealing this all through time amen then he would say the word is the truth well if it's an absolute it has to be the truth amen he says the Bible said so Jesus said father sanctify them through the truth Thy word is truth then he would say Jesus said the word is the seed and every seed is a promise in there and if you can just take them seeds into your heart no matter what it's for God will honor it and it'll bring forth just exactly what it promised that means it'll produce eternal life it'll produce Faith it'll produce Joy love peace patience kindness all of these things it'll produce the changing power of God for your life it'll position you in the body of Christ it'll give you overcoming power every bit of it is in there as a promise it is a seed that's growing that's coming forth amen everything is is packed inside of that seed remember brother bam says you get the Holy Ghost he says it's it's like you just might only have a drop of what's in the scene but it's the exact same thing as in the sea that's what's in your life by the word is you've got everything that's in the word packed inside of you and all you need is a power to make it live all you need is a life inside of you that'll draw it out and then you've got exactly every bit that was in the ocean in the first place he would say this the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ the Bible said so Christ being revealed in his word and that really ties into the next one it says the word is the testimony of God remember Revelation 1 2 says who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ then he would say God is going to judge the World by Jesus Christ and Christ in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he said God and the word is the same he said this is God on print the word is a lot of things isn't it we so often limit it to this because this is the written portion but way before this was there was something else there was something else and that's what we want to tie all the way back to he would say the body sure was Christ it was the anointed one and if Christ means the anointed one and he's the same yesterday today and forever and he is the word then the word is the anointing if you abide in me and my word abide in you then say what you will he says it's the word of God the anointed word that's what does it remember John 6 63 says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the word is the anointing amen then he says now the word is the conductor of the spirit because where the word is preached the spirit follows it wherever it goes why the spirit follows the word he says Oh I like that I like sound Bible teaching we like teaching don't we I love to sit down and hear the teaching but he says and don't stop at teaching and the Bible holy ghost coming back confirming Bible teaching acts 10 44 says while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word why the word was conducting the Holy Spirit down into their midst so that they could live the teaching that they were hearing so the word is a conductor of the Holy Spirit then he says the word assures us of the promise because it is the promise the word is the promise and the word is the God and the word is ours and we become the word and the word becomes us if you abide in me and my word in you then see it just becomes one great big family see it assures us because why well it's a part of us see second Corinthians 1 20 says for all the promises of God in him are yea are yes and in him amen so be it unto the glory of God by us then he would say this he is the light the truth the light and there is no darkness in him and he scatters the darkness when he comes in because he is the word the word is the light because he spoke and said let there be light that was the word that become light when he speaks this it's the light of that age each time remember Psalms 119 105 says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path then he would say this he says there is your name on The Book of Life he says the Book of Life is the word of God because the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on Word before this was ever printed see we look at this as this is where it is but before that was it had to be someplace else it had to be someplace else because before this was ever written we were in what we were in Christ we were there before the foundation of the world so you look at all of those things I just read three pages of quotes I think and you put it into one single slide and we see what is the word the word is all of these things and these are the attributes of God they're the attributes of the word they're the characteristics of the word they're the effect of the word all of these things are packaged into this and you look at that and you can see it's supernatural and and it's not it's supernatural in the way that we are and the way we we think of things because remember the word was first a thought it was an idea if we could put it that way but when we have an idea it usually just stays an idea doesn't it if we're to be honest most of our D ideas we don't even speak them much less produce them but when God thinks something it produces something because that's the nature of the supernatural God that we serve amen so it's because this is in the thought of God it is of god it becomes God and now because it's of him it has a power behind those thoughts that bring out what are supposed to be happening why our thoughts have very little power behind them I was reading this morning my devotions were were in the book of Isaiah where it says my thoughts are not your thoughts why because his have power might have only my carnality behind it and my ways are not your ways because he speaks and it happens and so often we're trying to do everything and our speaking never lines up with what happens in the first place his ways work our ways don't his thoughts produce ours don't they don't create usually what do they do they destroy here's what I'm glad his ways aren't like my ways I'm glad that his ways are higher than mine amen but John takes us a little deeper we started with John 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and we see this Supernatural in that and you say well how do I even fit in that that that's Perfection right there that's the absolute that's the beginning that is everything of God in there and now you want to stick Us in there how's that going to work well John does it he says the same was in the beginning with God so in other words all that was in the word was in the beginning with God if you can identify yourself in the word then you can put yourself right in the smack dab middle of that of that that picture we just showed you amen Paul that great prophet by the Holy Spirit take us all the way back to this point himself in the book of Ephesians he would say blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him that's Christ the anointed word the original before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love so that means that's what's in the seed that's inside of you that's what is going to be produced is a person that is Holy and Without Blame before God in love amen that's what it's meant to produce that's what it's programmed to produce therefore that's what it's going to produce not because of anything you do but because the word has already declared that it's going to be and that's the certainty that we're resting upon amen we can't produce anything else if we're part of that Holy seed that seed that has no blame inside of it he says having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved brother Brian would say this he says now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purpose in themselves in Ephesians 1 9 he says and in Romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself that means you don't have anything to say about it good or bad positive or negative it doesn't matter he's already chosen you and being Eternal it was decreed before the foundation of the world he says watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God he says God's an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God he said he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was he says she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God he says they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you he's trying to drive it home are the thoughts of God Eternal he says if you can see this you will see many things he says God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior God is infinite in his ability so therefore he is God he as God must be omniscient he must know all things he says if he is omniscient then he is not now learning he says nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he always had and always will have and he knows the end from the beginning because he is God he says thus the thoughts of God are eternal but then he says they are real isn't that a beautiful thing that his thoughts don't just stay in his mind then he just have a beautiful mind but he takes them out and he speaks them and that word Goes Forth with power It Goes Forth with purpose and it becomes real it has to become real it has to materialize it has to manifest it says they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he is drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form he says but they are already real and eternal and part of God I'm an engineer I'm sure brother Matt can identify with this sometimes we're designing something up to match a particular issue or a problem where we're making a machine or a tool or a jig or something like that and we drive once do we ever get it right the first time brother Matt Almost Never and so what do we do that thought though it's on paper it's written we rip it up and we throw it aside or if it's on a computer you know what we do we delete that file and we start all over again or we start to modify it he says God's not like that God gets it perfect the first time and then he just moves on with it amen he says these thoughts are already real and eternal and part of God these who are of the royal seed are the elective God they are the predestinated for known of God and we're in the mind of God and His Thoughts he says in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season you're here because this is where you were meant to be brother Branham said this is the greatest age you could ever live in you want to if you want an encouragement this evening God chose you to be in the greatest age that's ever been in this earth that's the caliber of the people that I'm talking to tonight I hope I'm a part of that that I'm not just talking but I'm a part of it that he picked he saved the best for last in the most difficult and the most twisted and the most sick in the most evil age he chose you because in your thoughts you have everything you need to come out of this age an overcomer a Victor somebody that has power and authority to what take Satan in every aspect out of your life that's what he's put inside of you as a seed he says as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body he says thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed Pride very familiar quote I know for each of us but he says what we're real we're Eternal we're expressed the prophet is saying this about the Bride of Jesus Christ he says this is something that began ever Before Time began we can see what God Said in his word and we read in this and you know we spend so much time talking about Moses and the children of Israel and we see the great promises and the prophecies and we can look and we say God did what he said he was going to do you know why God did that so that we can look today and say as he spoke those things for them he spoke the same in a a special word for us and he's going to do exactly what he's been doing all Through the Ages that's why brother Brandon would come at this age and he would show us everything that's happened in six ages perfectly perfectly according to the scriptures so that you can read your portion of the scripture and say he's going to do it for me he's not going to leave me hanging it may take time but he's not going to leave me hanging remember that that story brother Brown would talk about that that rich young man that went to the ranch and he was looking for a wife and all the girls were around and trying to catch his eye and he got real sick and tired of it he went out back and he saw a girl washing dishes and something about her Drew him to her and he fell in love with her and he says I'm going to come back at an appointed time he says you be ready I'll be there and brother Brandon would say he didn't come in the morning and she had to stay there robed in her wedding dress prepared having testified of the man that was coming for her that rich man coming for her and he says they're making fun of her and they're saying you really think that he meant it and this and that the other thing and then he says and then come the sounds of her feet and then came the carriages and the coaches he says he rides up and he takes her and he walks takes her away and they're left standing there saying how did that happen they didn't see it happening why she knew that she had his word and that he would be there when he said he would and she had to go through the score and she had to go through the waiting she had to go through the trial of it all but he showed up exactly the way he said he was going to exactly when he had to amen if he did it for them what's going to keep it from doing it for us that's his promises at every word that he says is going to come to pass brother Brown's telling us you're in there you're in here just the same way as every single other child of God we look at those Heroes of the faith in Hebrews 11. you are no less in the scripture though not named specifically than Abraham and Moses and Samuel and David and Joseph and all these ones your name is written there just as clearly as there there's is but it's under the name of the Bride the elect the elect lady that's your inclusion amen that's why you've got to receive a message for your age that's why you've got to receive the word for your age so you know what's supposed to be coming your way but he's saying look don't look at this as an external thing I think that's the greatest thing that we can recognize is that this word is not external it's internal it's built into us it's a part of us we're a part of it it's one big body we're one big entity so he's saying don't look outside but recognize yourself inside of it and that's going to put you in a whole different perspective so now you're not going to something you are something you're not going to be something you are something do not perfectly expressed yet and so you're looking now by eyes of faith that I am this even though it doesn't yet appear what I shall be amen so we take that first slide that we saw and buried inside of that the very attributes the very character the very nature of the word we have the Bride of Jesus Christ embedded right in the middle by his eternal thoughts Before Time Ever began what is it a literal spoken word seed bride he said you were in his thoughts therefore you are part of the spoken word therefore you are part of the written word therefore you've got to come forth exactly as he was talking about amen once we see ourselves in our position as true believers what do we start to understand that there's a word behind us right and so that means there's an intent and there's a purpose and there's a power and there's a call and there's a push and there's a watering and there's a feeding and all these things and what is it doing it's rotting away this prickly Old Shell that's around us and it's producing the DNA of the word that's buried deep inside of us that see Gene of God that's in US amen why because his word never returns to him void John would continue and he would say this all things were made by him Christ the word and without him was not anything made that was made that's why the original Earth was perfect it was a word Earth it was made by Christ the person of the word it was word upon word that's what made it perfect brother Brown would put this way he says now so were you in if you've got eternal life you were in God before there ever was a world you are a part A Son of God an attribute of God he knew the very age you were coming he predestinated you to that age to take that place and no one else can take it he says I don't care how many impersonizations and things you've got to be there because he knew you would be there and now you are made manifest now you can fellowship with him and that's what he wants he's longing for Fellowship to be worshiped he says and if your life was not always an attribute in God you're just a mimic of Christianity see he says there'll be millions and billions of them they'll just be mimics of Christianity we see that with esan Jacob tried and he tried and he tried to live right he tried to desire right he tried to be right he tried to find a place of repentance with tears yet he could not do it why because he was just copying what he had seen there was nothing in him that was calling out for it brother I would say this it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the beginning he's saying that this Christian walk that we have the reason why we come to church the reason why we live the way we do the reason why we talk the way we do the reason why we do our hair the way we do the way we dress we do all these different things he says it's because there's something inside of us that's pushing out it is not legalism it's legalism for us in that we can't escape it it's legal because it's in us it's written in us it's a part of our DNA it's a part of our very inner being so we can't escape it but everyone else he says they're mimicking it they're just trying to be a Christian rather than being a Christian you are or you aren't and you can't put on a robe of Christianity and be a Christian you just have to be one from what the beginning he says in the beginning was of the creation of God when God began to create he bring you into existence you see you started back there as a seed and worked down to where you are now he says and then you were all in Christ and then when Christ died he died to redeem all of you and you are a part of this word he says oh the Bible all of it he says it's precept upon precept line upon line here a little there little not one jot or a tittle shall fail we're talking about the certainty of a seed and catch what he's saying he's saying if you were in Christ in the beginning then there's something that's bringing you to where you are today what is it it's a word that's encoded inside of you you know we look at programming today and if you program something and you tell it to execute you tell it to run it'll do everything that's written in that code unless it hits an error and then it can go into a loop then it can just kick itself out of the program but he's talking about in God's perfect program and he says not one jot not one Tittle not one line of code not one line of DNA what not one not not one word promise none of it can fail not one jot or tittle can fail let me tell you some of us are just jots and some of us are just tittles but not a one of us can fail as long as we're part of the word that's what he's trying to tell us amen it's not that we decided to come to God it's not that we decided to accept the message of the hour it's not that we decided to become a Christian but there's a jot inside of us there's a tittle inside of us that says I cannot fail and so it brings us to a place where it can produce that jot or tittle that's written in the word inside of us amen not one little bit he says will fail you'll produce what's In You by the predestinated thought word of God in your age in your season by his will in his timing not yours amen you will be the manifested word for this day you will be Christ the word on display because you come from the word you are the word and therefore the word will come out it has to because the word cannot fail amen but here's the thing where the word in a shell and that shell is Prickly it stinks and then it stinks it's rotten sometimes it's not so nice to be around when life's coming out because of the rotten flesh that's on the outside amen and we look at that and we say how can that be the word but look to the word that's coming out don't look at what's breaking away as the word comes forth as you see it breaking away say that's what proves it's the word coming forth because all that's rotting and dying away has nothing to do with what's inside of me that's what we want to focus on don't focus on your faults and failures hey you got false and failures I got false and failures take them to the Lord and say Lord kill them Rob them destroy them but above all bring the word out of that rottenness don't let me just rot here because there's a lot of people just rotting because there's nothing inside of them they're trying to bring forth something and they're they're bringing forth purple hair and they're bringing forth crazy clothes and they're bringing forth crazy music and they're bringing forth crazy doctrines and they're bringing forth all these alphabet everything why they're trying to produce a life but there's no life inside of them but for us as that rottenness breaks there's a real life there's a word life that comes out of it amen we don't focus on the dead rotting part that's why we need the blood remember the word that's coming out of it is going to be perfect because it is the word amen we're focused on living and coming to maturity program would say then see God came down and the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible he says notice God made visible in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God's an object of worship the only thing he was was the Eternal and in him were attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and word was made manifest what is it he says it's all God becoming tangible we're tangible we're the tangible word that is revealing Christ in this age you can pinch us you can touch us you can hug us you can slap us you can like us you can dislike us but we are the tangible God being revealed we are the word being made tangible he says and you are a part of God and Jesus came to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem he says in them as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there that's why brother Mark could read an ad and something would strike him and immediately he responded because there was a life inside of him that summer takes longer than that we've all got to have our own experience we've got to have our own revelation of Christ the word to us but there's a time where it strikes and something responds something comes out why because that's what happens to the word when the word strikes the word something's going to happen he says but if the life innocent in there then what can they do see they don't see it they'll never see it see and the whole thing is Jesus said at that day you'll know I am in the Father the father and me I in you and you and me he says the whole thing is God becoming material I love that the whole thing this whole word is about God becoming material it's manifesting time he says like a husband and wife becoming one together God and his church becoming one he said and remember if you never was in God's thoughts you'll never be with God how many knows that he was a redeemer were then anything redeemed has to come back where it fell from so if he come to redeem us how could we one time didn't have to be redeemed and we were all born and sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies it shows that the real Christian is an attribute of God's thinking before there was a world or a star or air or anything else it's Eternal and he comes back comes to redeem us back it's God's thought spoke into a word made manifest and brought back to his thought we're not going back to his thought as in in his mind we're going back to the thought that was in his mind we're materializing the thought amen we're becoming exactly what was in his mind because today we're all twisted up Satan got his fingers in the pie and he messed up all of humanity and so there's a redeeming work coming now by the power of the spoken word to what bring us back into the original image thought that God had in his mind before we all began amen I'm going to read one more quote before we close here because I want to end on a high note because I'm trying to let you see who you are what you are where you came from where you started what you're a part of what's inside of you what God said about you what God's doing for you and all these things we look at you look at what I'm talking about here tonight and the only way we've got this is we heard a voice from heaven that's the only way we've got it you will not find a lick of this in the denominations today that can take us all the way back to Before Time began to the very thoughts and mind of God and say you were there therefore you will be you won't find it you won't you won't see they can't even grasp the idea of true predestination because predestination as they preach it is that you made a choice and God saw your choice and the prophet of God's taking us all the way back and saying he chose you he put you are an attribute you are a thought you are a characteristic of God and that's why you are going to make it because you are a part of the word you're not choosing it he did it he made you that that's what's coming forth as the very thought that God had for you of you as what a materialization of God in this world today we are blessed we're blessed to hear Jesus said blessed are your ears blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear them amen he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he said see the word was in God it was God it was his thoughts that was with him always he said God's thoughts are as Eternal as God is so if you're a thought of God you're as Eternal as he is brother Brown would say we skipped our theophany and came down here we didn't realize what we were and we come down here and we have to realize that here we have to fight our way back we're in a Redemption process to bring it back he says but you're as Eternal as God as amen he says that ain't skilled milk brother here it comes he says God's thoughts was his word in the beginning he says that's in eternity now when beginning first started time he says we are literally the beginning of it all see his thoughts are what he was that's you too what your thoughts is is what you are no matter when you what you try to live by something else your thoughts is what you are you might go along and act like a nice fellow but in your heart you're an adulteress or whatever it is he says that's what you are your thoughts that's how you know one of the ways you know you've got the holy spirit is when your thoughts and your nature changes and you desire something different than you used to deserve because we're all born the children of Wrath we're all born in sin-shaped iniquity come to the world speaking lies as he would say but when your thoughts start to become like his thoughts you know there's a work going on he says and God's thoughts were his word that was with him and in him so you were with him and you were in him and it was God God's thoughts were expressed in the human body May fashion dwelt Among Us he says there you are now if you have eternal life today you are in God and by God's being in you you are God's expressed thought little you little me is God's expressed thought today I'll say this we're not big thoughts there's a bunch of us and brother Dale's got a little thought and sister Amber's got a little thought and brother Jim's got a little thought and sister Brenda has a different one and Becca and Selena each one of us is a portion of God and we have a little thought and maybe one is stability or commitment or strength or Grace or patience some of us are expressions of healing some of us are expressions maybe of power and authority in a way that others aren't but each one of us is a thought of God we are a portion of the express word of God today he says who then don't listen to any reasonings lest your crown be taken and given to another remember circumstances can trim you down it won't change you but it can trim you down and your glory can go to another he says don't take any reasonings at all just believe what God Said is the truth and stay with it amen God bless you let's stand together if we would I know I'm teaching and I don't want to take us too long and honestly sometimes I get going in this and I start preaching and I never know when how long it's going to be so I try to keep it a little bit tighter tonight amen but I want you to see you're not just here today by some choice or by happenstance or or just some freak event that somehow brought us here remember you're here because God has ordained you to be here he's ordained you to be a believer he's ordained you to be an overcomer he's ordained you to be the word expressed in your own way as he has designed it for this day in this age and there's nothing that can stop us from doing today man what did he say don't listen to any reasonings he says just believe what God Said is the truth and stay with it that's the nature of our believers they stick with it and then they believe it and against all hope they believe it and they keep believing it and they keep believing it and they keep believing it until it comes out why because his word will not return unto him void his word always agrees with his word brother Brown would say I didn't put it in here he said he had a quote he says he says if you're the word then you can never disagree with the word because you'll be disagreeing with your own self you're literally built into it it's in your nature to agree with the word of God because you're a part of it and it's a part of you amen amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how wonderful your word is Lord how wonderful and perfect are your thoughts Lord your ideas Lord that they don't just stick in your mind Lord but they come out and they produce these wonderful things that we see Heavenly Father Lord I pray you help us to come up a little higher Lord that as we read your word Lord as we hear your message for this age Lord that it would help us to see that this is not just a little event Lord but it's a great event it's a great calling out of the loved elect lady Lord that you've got a people you've got a church you've got a bride that's supposed to come forth Lord and she is going to be a perfect image of that original word Lord I pray you help us to dedicate Our Lives anew lord it's not by our power Lord but let us not hinder Lord let us be in step with your word let our spirit agree with your spirit Lord let our life let the way we spend our time lord our energy Lord may it reflect Lord the calling out and the manifestation of a true bride in this age Lord God Lord encourage us along the way Lord let us keep looking to you trusting you believing in you Lord where we felt Lord that you maybe left us hanging Lord let us keep looking to the promise Lord knowing that all things Lord in your time you make them beautiful Lord just be with us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen do we know that song I worship you almighty God there is none like you 882. I worship you almighty God there is none like you I worship you oh Jesus that is what I long to do but like give you praise [Music] Mighty God there is none like you I must [Music] like you I worship you peace [Music] over my righteousness [Music] I worship you God there is none like you I worship you [Music] there is none [Music] to do I give you praise [Music] Mighty God there is none like you power of Your Love 797.

literal seed word pride something anchors you something holds you something keeps you something pull pushes you that's not you that's something inside of you that's the Eternal word thought that God's pulling out of you that Satan's trying to Tamp down that your flesh is resisting every day that's the word of God being expressed that is Christ himself being blossomed out of your life that's what's going on Amen this isn't just church it's not just a message but it's the word materializing in human flesh and whether it's the fruits of the spirit whether it's the Deliverance of the Holy Spirit whether it's the healing power of the word whatever it is that's what's holding us inside it's on this path and keeps pulling us and drawing us day by day that keeps us going when we're disappointed
