[1:02:29] Exodus chapter 23
[1:02:32] verse 20 says behold I send an angel
[1:02:34] before thee to keep thee in the way and
[1:02:37] to bring thee into the place which I
[1:02:39] have prepared beware of him and obey his
[1:02:42] voice provoke him not for he will not
[1:02:44] pardon your transgressions for my name
[1:02:47] is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey
[1:02:50] his voice and do all that I speak then I
[1:02:53] will be an enemy unto thine enemies and
[1:02:55] an adversary unto thine adversaries for
[1:02:58] mine Angels shall go before thee and
[1:03:00] bring thee in unto the amorites and the
[1:03:02] Hittites and the parasites and the
[1:03:04] Canaanites and the hivites and the
[1:03:06] jebusites and I will cut them off Thou
[1:03:09] shalt not bow down to their gods nor
[1:03:11] serve them nor do after their works
[1:03:14] notice that not just worship but don't
[1:03:17] do the things that they do those that
[1:03:18] worship idols live differently they act
[1:03:20] differently they speak differently he
[1:03:22] says don't serve them nor do after their
[1:03:24] works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow
[1:03:26] them and quite break down their images
[1:03:28] and you shall serve the Lord your God
[1:03:31] and he shall bless thy bread and thy
[1:03:33] water and I will take sickness away from
[1:03:36] the midst of the
[1:03:38] thing God bless his word you can have
[1:03:39] your seats this morning God bless you
[1:03:40] remember we're going to continue on our
[1:03:42] series on Redemption
[1:03:44] we're at part 26 now and I want to
[1:03:47] continue where we left off last service
[1:03:48] in this idea of preparing to inherit and
[1:03:51] as you can see we're using the types and
[1:03:53] shadows of the Redemption of the
[1:03:54] children of Israel to to show us where
[1:03:56] we're at today and and what it looks
[1:03:58] like for the believer and what
[1:04:00] inheritance awaits for us and we know
[1:04:02] that in in this scripture in Exodus 23
[1:04:04] they're not even close to crossing over
[1:04:06] to the land yet and God's preparing them
[1:04:08] even as early as as 40 years before
[1:04:10] they're going to go in he's preparing
[1:04:12] them for what it's going to look like to
[1:04:14] inherit and what they need to be ready
[1:04:15] for and what they're supposed to be
[1:04:17] doing as they they lay the groundwork
[1:04:18] for this Redemption process and and
[1:04:20] their part in it amen so God took them
[1:04:23] out of Egypt with a mighty hand we know
[1:04:25] the scripture says and that was the
[1:04:26] going out part of redemption and then he
[1:04:29] took them through the desert and that
[1:04:30] was the preparing them for the going in
[1:04:32] part and then there's a going in part
[1:04:34] and and so this preparation to inherit
[1:04:36] this preparing to inherit is letting us
[1:04:38] know that we're about ready to go into
[1:04:40] something that there's something waiting
[1:04:42] for us that all this time that we've
[1:04:43] we've spent in all walking in the desert
[1:04:45] and this this Dusty dry land that we've
[1:04:48] been going through and the trials and
[1:04:49] tribulations we've been going through
[1:04:50] are there to prepare us for something
[1:04:52] that's far better than we've experienced
[1:04:53] so far it's a wonderful thing to be set
[1:04:56] free from your sins and to be justified
[1:04:58] as if you never did it and to accept the
[1:05:00] blood of Christ and then you have the
[1:05:01] sanctification of the desert the
[1:05:03] separating and these different things
[1:05:05] but there's something greater even than
[1:05:06] all of those things amen we're so
[1:05:08] thankful for what God has done for us
[1:05:10] that he's he's buried our sins in the
[1:05:12] sea of forgetfulness that we're under
[1:05:13] the shed blood of Calvary that he
[1:05:15] separated us from the things of the
[1:05:17] world and the ideas of the world but he
[1:05:18] says there's something greater coming
[1:05:20] and I want you to know I prepared a way
[1:05:22] and I prepared a person to take you even
[1:05:24] into what you're looking forward to amen
[1:05:27] so we want to move past the desert
[1:05:29] experience we want to talk about what
[1:05:30] awaits ahead of us and what this this
[1:05:32] whole Journey's been about so let's
[1:05:34] start as we go back to these scriptures
[1:05:36] here and it says behold I send an angel
[1:05:38] before thee to keep thee in the way and
[1:05:41] to bring thee into the place which I
[1:05:42] have prepared now I want you to notice
[1:05:45] that this is not an angel
[1:05:47] this is really the angel because this is
[1:05:50] not little little a angel this is
[1:05:52] capital a angel this is the person of
[1:05:55] God this is the theophany of God in
[1:05:57] Angelic form that is leading the
[1:05:59] children of Israel that says he's going
[1:06:01] to take you into the land that I have
[1:06:03] prepared
[1:06:04] amen and we want to realize that there
[1:06:06] is a big Angel and there's a little
[1:06:07] angel for every stage
[1:06:10] because what happens is we know that
[1:06:12] people get stuck on the little a angel
[1:06:14] and they forget the big a angel if I can
[1:06:16] put it that way how many times has that
[1:06:18] Pastor said that brother Brown says they
[1:06:20] neglect to see the angel behind me he
[1:06:22] was an angel messenger but that was an
[1:06:24] Earthly messenger but there's always a
[1:06:26] supernatural Angel there's always the
[1:06:28] presence the holy spirit of God that's
[1:06:30] leading and guiding the children of God
[1:06:31] Amen
[1:06:32] we know that Moses was not this angel
[1:06:35] that that spoken of here we know that
[1:06:38] because he's talking to Moses
[1:06:40] Moses can't be the angel if he says I'm
[1:06:42] going to send an angel before you before
[1:06:44] the children before Moses before Joshua
[1:06:46] and these different things Moses spake
[1:06:48] of an Angel and Joshua spoke of an Angel
[1:06:50] and Moses met an angel and Joshua met an
[1:06:53] angel and so we know that that angel was
[1:06:55] not those men but it brings us to the
[1:06:57] idea of where we are in this age because
[1:06:58] in Revelation 3 it says and unto the
[1:07:01] angel the little Aid
[1:07:04] under the Earthly messenger of the
[1:07:06] Church of the laodiceans right these
[1:07:08] things saith thee amen the faithful and
[1:07:10] true witness the beginning of the
[1:07:12] creation of God and then in verse 22 it
[1:07:14] says he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:07:17] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:07:19] so it says that there's something that's
[1:07:21] speaking and it is the amen it is the
[1:07:24] faithful and true witness it is the
[1:07:25] creation of God and then he says hear
[1:07:27] what the spirit is saying so this is
[1:07:29] nothing less this Angel is nothing less
[1:07:31] than the spirit of God dropped into an
[1:07:34] Angelic form
[1:07:35] that's what we're supposed to be looking
[1:07:37] at amen so in our her church age who is
[1:07:40] the inspiration what is the inspiration
[1:07:42] is it a man that we say was a prophet no
[1:07:45] no more than it was for Moses or Joshua
[1:07:47] but we're looking to what the amen the
[1:07:50] faithful and true witness the creation
[1:07:51] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:07:53] which is Christ himself that's who's
[1:07:56] leading us that's who's guiding us and
[1:07:58] we can't get stuck on the man but we
[1:08:00] have to recognize what the man is
[1:08:02] echoing and he's echoing a voice from
[1:08:04] eternity which is the spirit of the
[1:08:05] Living God speaking to you bringing you
[1:08:08] a message taking you what you need to
[1:08:11] take you into your inheritance he's
[1:08:13] delivering something from the Throne of
[1:08:15] God that is meant to drive you all the
[1:08:17] way to your Eternal destination people
[1:08:19] think we're looking to a man we're not
[1:08:20] looking to a man but we're looking to
[1:08:22] the Unseen voice behind the man that is
[1:08:25] calling us out of this world and into an
[1:08:27] eternal Place amen
[1:08:29] what are we doing we're looking to the
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:32] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:08:34] the Alpha and the Omega the beginning
[1:08:35] and the end because we're in him and
[1:08:38] that's what we're looking to as we've
[1:08:40] responded to a cry that was what just
[1:08:42] like what was inside of us there's a
[1:08:44] deep calling to the deep inside of our
[1:08:46] Lives amen so what was he doing our
[1:08:48] messenger came to turn us back to what
[1:08:50] the amen not to himself but he said turn
[1:08:53] you back to the fullness of the word to
[1:08:55] restore us to the word so that we could
[1:08:57] have the fullness of it inside of our
[1:08:59] Lives each one amen
[1:09:01] so an angel has to go before us but a
[1:09:03] man will speak supernaturally of that
[1:09:05] angel
[1:09:07] when you catch what the holy spirit is
[1:09:09] saying you speak as God speaks not just
[1:09:12] the man not just the prophet not just
[1:09:14] the messenger not just the leader not
[1:09:16] just the ministry but you as a Believer
[1:09:18] when the Holy Spirit speaks into your
[1:09:20] life that is the Angel speaking into
[1:09:22] your life and when you speak what he
[1:09:24] speaks you speak as God speaks that's
[1:09:26] how powerful it is church when you have
[1:09:28] the Holy Ghost leading you and guiding
[1:09:30] you amen what is it it's not me leading
[1:09:32] the church it's not brother Gerald
[1:09:33] leading the church it's not William
[1:09:35] Branham leading the church it's not any
[1:09:36] Minister that you like to listen to but
[1:09:38] it's got to be the angel of the church
[1:09:40] age that's leading us the capital A the
[1:09:43] spirit the Yea and amen it's got to be
[1:09:45] the life of the word the person of Jesus
[1:09:47] Christ amen
[1:09:50] what is it we've got to learn to listen
[1:09:53] because the angel was not there remember
[1:09:55] he says I'm sending an angel to lead you
[1:09:57] but now as soon as they Cross Jordan
[1:09:58] they're not going to see a cloud they're
[1:10:00] not going to see a pillar they have to
[1:10:02] follow a voice they have to follow an
[1:10:04] angel now and we've got to do the same
[1:10:05] thing we don't have the visible Pillar
[1:10:07] of Fire here anymore do we
[1:10:09] but the same angel that was in that
[1:10:11] pillar fire is here to lead us all the
[1:10:13] way we sing that song I know Jehovah is
[1:10:15] here to lead us all the way listen we've
[1:10:17] got the same Angel today and it's the
[1:10:19] holy spirit in the life of each and
[1:10:21] every one a believer
[1:10:22] of the Believers amen but the problem is
[1:10:24] that we know what's supposed to happen
[1:10:27] we know what's coming our way we've been
[1:10:29] well taught we know what's in here for
[1:10:31] the Believers of the last Church age we
[1:10:33] know it's here for the Believers it's
[1:10:35] the manifestation of the sons and God
[1:10:36] and Daughters of God comes into its
[1:10:38] fullness and so what happens is we try
[1:10:40] and get ahead of it we try and make it
[1:10:43] happen but we see here that he said what
[1:10:45] I'll send an angel before you to lead
[1:10:48] you we are not to lead but we are to be
[1:10:51] led we're sheep we're supposed to have a
[1:10:53] Shepherd we're supposed to have one that
[1:10:55] goes before us the angel goes before us
[1:10:58] to prepare a way and to keep us in the
[1:11:00] way that's what the holy spirit is here
[1:11:03] for is not to to to drive us but to lead
[1:11:06] us somewhere to follow
[1:11:07] I read a quote and will maybe preach on
[1:11:10] in the next service brother Brown says
[1:11:12] we don't use the Holy Spirit
[1:11:15] the Holy Spirit uses us
[1:11:18] that's where we have to get to because
[1:11:19] what happens so often is we think we
[1:11:22] have something and we try and use it and
[1:11:24] know the idea is to get out of the way
[1:11:26] so that he can use you and then the
[1:11:28] supernatural can flow through you
[1:11:30] because it's him and you it's Christ in
[1:11:31] you it's the holy spirit in you that's
[1:11:33] doing the work it's not you that's
[1:11:34] trying to make it happen
[1:11:37] Paul would say this in Romans 8 he says
[1:11:40] for if you live after the flesh you
[1:11:43] shall die
[1:11:44] but
[1:11:46] there's a remedy you don't have to die
[1:11:49] he says but if you through the spirit do
[1:11:52] mortify the Deeds of the body you shall
[1:11:54] live then he says for as many as are led
[1:11:57] by the spirit of God they are the sons
[1:12:00] of God
[1:12:01] the defining characteristic of a son or
[1:12:03] a daughter of God is that they're led by
[1:12:04] the spirit of God
[1:12:07] ultimately
[1:12:09] you may not be there yet
[1:12:11] But ultimately this is what proves the
[1:12:13] Son and Daughter of God is that they are
[1:12:15] led by the spirit of God and until the
[1:12:17] Holy Spirit leads us we will fail
[1:12:19] constantly
[1:12:21] we'll get halfway we'll get three
[1:12:23] quarters of the way we'll get somewhere
[1:12:25] and then it'll stop it'll fail because
[1:12:26] it's us trying to do the supernatural
[1:12:28] rather than the supernatural working
[1:12:30] through Us in the first place
[1:12:32] I was reading as I was studying this I
[1:12:34] came on this quote and brother Brown
[1:12:35] does this this really long sentence and
[1:12:37] I want to I broke it down because he
[1:12:39] says there's eight things that tell us
[1:12:41] when we're ready and this is not
[1:12:42] conclude you know this is not the only
[1:12:44] list or anything like that but but I
[1:12:46] want I broke it down into bit by bit so
[1:12:48] it would be more impactful here now
[1:12:49] watch this he says and when the
[1:12:51] Christian is he's talking about when
[1:12:52] you're ready he says and when the
[1:12:54] question is number one packed with the
[1:12:57] gospel filled with the goodness of God
[1:12:59] and all the good things of God are
[1:13:01] laying in him
[1:13:03] with an open heart
[1:13:06] ready to work
[1:13:09] willing to be positionally placed
[1:13:12] do anything that the Holy Spirit tells
[1:13:15] him to do
[1:13:16] is pass from Death unto life is
[1:13:19] Sanctified from all the things of the
[1:13:22] world and is walking in the light as the
[1:13:25] light comes to him moving on he's ready
[1:13:29] should I read it again
[1:13:32] when the Christian is packed with the
[1:13:34] gospel and with the goodness of God when
[1:13:36] the Christian has an open heart when the
[1:13:39] Christian is ready to work when the
[1:13:41] Christian is willing to be positionally
[1:13:43] placed when he's willing to do anything
[1:13:45] that the Holy Spirit tells him to do
[1:13:47] when the Christian is passed from Death
[1:13:49] unto life when the Christian is
[1:13:51] Sanctified from all the things of the
[1:13:52] world when the Christian is walking in
[1:13:54] the light as the light comes to him
[1:13:57] as it comes to him
[1:14:00] just because you can see it doesn't mean
[1:14:02] you're in it yet don't get ahead of the
[1:14:04] working of God he says when you've done
[1:14:06] all that when you have all of that then
[1:14:08] he or she is ready
[1:14:10] he says then
[1:14:12] God shuts the door of the world behind
[1:14:14] him and kicks it together like that and
[1:14:17] seals him with the Holy Ghost Of Promise
[1:14:19] hallelujah how long how long are you
[1:14:22] still church until the destination don't
[1:14:25] get him out here on the railroad track
[1:14:26] and break it open and see if
[1:14:28] everything's all right again it's all
[1:14:30] right just leave it alone the inspector
[1:14:32] has inspected it how long are you sealed
[1:14:35] he says until the day of your Redemption
[1:14:36] that's how long you're sealed listen
[1:14:39] there's lots of people doing great works
[1:14:41] today
[1:14:42] great Ministries great influence maybe
[1:14:45] you could say they've got hundreds and
[1:14:46] thousands and maybe even millions of
[1:14:47] souls that they've led to Christ
[1:14:49] supposedly
[1:14:51] but until
[1:14:53] you have the Holy Spirit leading you
[1:14:55] they'll all come to not
[1:14:58] because remember it's a scripture that
[1:14:59] I've quoted so many times that said in
[1:15:01] that Dale they'll come to him and say
[1:15:02] Lord have we not done many wonderful
[1:15:03] works in your name and heal the sick and
[1:15:05] all these different things and he says
[1:15:06] depart from me you that work iniquity I
[1:15:09] never knew you because you didn't listen
[1:15:11] to the spirit you did it of your own
[1:15:13] accord for your own glory for your own
[1:15:15] purpose for your own reasons and that's
[1:15:18] not what I'm looking for I'm looking for
[1:15:19] somebody that will be subject to my work
[1:15:21] which is by the Holy Spirit quickening
[1:15:23] it to us amen
[1:15:26] brother Brown talks about people that
[1:15:27] can't wait he says Adam's bride could
[1:15:29] not wait
[1:15:30] God had told Adam and Eve multiply and
[1:15:33] replenish the Earth he says it was an
[1:15:35] oncoming thing a promise this is the
[1:15:37] most dangerous place for believers when
[1:15:39] you see the promise and you say I've got
[1:15:41] to get it now
[1:15:44] she was not his wife as yet because he
[1:15:46] had never lived with her he says the
[1:15:48] bride of Christ is not his wife yet the
[1:15:50] wedding suppers to take place get it he
[1:15:52] says notice oh this is Rich she got in a
[1:15:55] hurry and what should she do what did
[1:15:57] she do she crossed her seed she mingled
[1:16:00] it with the serpent seat and when she
[1:16:02] did what did she bring she brought a
[1:16:04] child of death a child that she
[1:16:07] perverted every child after that notice
[1:16:10] an oncoming thing a promise a prophecy
[1:16:13] laying there that God had given her and
[1:16:16] she tried to bring it to pass her own
[1:16:18] way and all she did was make a mess and
[1:16:20] she brought
[1:16:21] to the rest
[1:16:28] of the rest he says and when the Church
[1:16:30] of Jesus Christ was perverted in the
[1:16:32] time of wrong after a virgin birth and
[1:16:34] was given to Christ at Pentecost what
[1:16:36] did she do she crossed herself with
[1:16:39] Roman dogma and the Protestant church
[1:16:41] has done the very same thing she can't
[1:16:43] wait a woman is engaged to a fine young
[1:16:46] clean man and before they come together
[1:16:48] what she's done she's found pregnant by
[1:16:50] someone else then her own body which is
[1:16:53] patrolled to her boyfriend her engaged
[1:16:55] husband is found full of seed of another
[1:16:57] man he says what a disgrace that's
[1:16:59] exactly what Adam found
[1:17:03] he says that's what Christ has found
[1:17:04] they couldn't wait that's the matter
[1:17:07] with people today they can't wait for
[1:17:09] the real Holy Spirit to take the church
[1:17:12] in position
[1:17:14] they've got to manufacture something
[1:17:16] work up something
[1:17:18] don't think we're excluded from this
[1:17:21] within this message that we preach
[1:17:24] we know so much
[1:17:26] we know so much we've had a Prophet come
[1:17:28] and show signs and wonders and we see
[1:17:30] them in part in The Bride today
[1:17:33] but everyone's trying to get there and
[1:17:36] the thing is you can only get there as
[1:17:37] God makes it real to you that's the
[1:17:39] simple fact
[1:17:40] he says that they work up something they
[1:17:42] try and manufacture something the
[1:17:44] initial evidence speaking in tongues
[1:17:45] what were they trying to prove we've got
[1:17:47] the fullness
[1:17:48] and so they made a sign of it and they
[1:17:50] said what is it it's speaking in tongues
[1:17:51] that's your proof everyone wants proof
[1:17:54] we want assurance
[1:17:56] we want Surety we want to know that we
[1:17:59] know that we know
[1:18:01] don't we
[1:18:03] as a young person we want to know don't
[1:18:05] we do I have the Holy Ghost am I sealed
[1:18:07] to the day of my Redemption am I going
[1:18:09] in a Rapture am I going in a
[1:18:10] resurrection if I go by way of the Grave
[1:18:12] that's what we want is that assurance
[1:18:14] and so what people do is they make up
[1:18:16] signs they make up ideas they make up
[1:18:17] the the checklist of their own making
[1:18:21] to make themselves feel that they've got
[1:18:22] it
[1:18:23] he says they they say initial evidence
[1:18:26] is speaking in tongues to get more
[1:18:27] members in the church all these kinds of
[1:18:29] Tommy rot instead of waiting upon the
[1:18:32] Lord for the real manifestation of the
[1:18:34] resurrection of Christ making himself
[1:18:36] known among the people she can't wait
[1:18:39] what did she do she went out and become
[1:18:42] pregnant with denominationalism first
[1:18:44] was Assemblies of God then come the
[1:18:46] Oneness then come walk after that he
[1:18:48] says now the so-called bride is
[1:18:50] pregnated with all kinds of Tommy rot a
[1:18:52] disgrace the women won't pay a bit more
[1:18:55] attention to what God's word says and
[1:18:56] nothing in the word and neither will the
[1:18:58] men or even the preachers he says then
[1:19:01] call that a bride what is it she's
[1:19:03] pregnant Christ's bride has become
[1:19:05] pregnant with the world dressing like
[1:19:07] the world acting like the world big
[1:19:09] churches fine what it shows what she is
[1:19:12] she is of the devil
[1:19:15] That's what Satan done in the first
[1:19:17] place was trying to build a big
[1:19:19] beautiful kingdom in the heaven and was
[1:19:21] kicked out for it and excommunicated
[1:19:22] from heaven
[1:19:24] he says that's what Christ's Modern
[1:19:26] Bride is she's kicked out because she's
[1:19:28] excommunicated from God because she is a
[1:19:30] and not a virgin
[1:19:32] he's not speaking of the real bride
[1:19:33] obviously
[1:19:35] but he's speaking of what the church
[1:19:37] the church natural the people that
[1:19:39] profess to be Christians christ-like and
[1:19:42] he says God is nowhere near her because
[1:19:44] she's been found pregnant by everything
[1:19:45] that Satan's thrown her way because
[1:19:47] she's trying to manufacture something
[1:19:50] he says it's deep but I hope you get it
[1:19:52] Adam's bride could not wait and she
[1:19:54] mingled her seat illegally he says we
[1:19:57] are supposed to believe God's word and
[1:19:59] that alone
[1:20:01] now Brethren do you see why I'm
[1:20:03] contending for the word word by word
[1:20:05] I've told you I believe that this is
[1:20:07] God's truth God has predicted that Bible
[1:20:09] he's got to judge the World by something
[1:20:11] through Jesus Christ which is the word
[1:20:13] and the Word was made flesh to become
[1:20:15] Jesus Christ I'm just letting it soak in
[1:20:18] he says remember the word
[1:20:20] and now he finds her all messed up you
[1:20:23] think he'd marry such a thing as that
[1:20:25] never
[1:20:26] he's holy and she couldn't wait and
[1:20:29] she's illegal that's the way today the
[1:20:31] bride today she wants to manufacture
[1:20:34] something glory to God she's got to work
[1:20:36] it up on the platform she's got to have
[1:20:38] everything see what is she's doing
[1:20:40] manufacturing something look where it's
[1:20:43] going you can see there's nothing to it
[1:20:45] it's a phony exactly right he says watch
[1:20:49] this if it wasn't this world would be a
[1:20:52] flame with the power of God the church
[1:20:54] will be on fire he says oh what the dead
[1:20:57] will be raised and all kinds of things
[1:20:59] will be taking place
[1:21:02] I believe we're at a time of transition
[1:21:05] globally globally
[1:21:08] because what we're at the end of the end
[1:21:12] time is wrapping up it's going to be a
[1:21:14] very quick short work
[1:21:16] and we're looking at it and we look in
[1:21:18] the word and we see our place and we see
[1:21:19] our position we recognize our day and we
[1:21:22] recognize its message and we hear what
[1:21:23] the holy spirit is saying and then
[1:21:25] brother Brown's saying don't get ahead
[1:21:27] of God
[1:21:28] let God lead the way let the angel the
[1:21:31] capital a angel let the Holy Spirit lead
[1:21:34] the church into this
[1:21:36] we've got some of the fullness
[1:21:38] we have some signs and some wonders we
[1:21:41] have some gifts we have some
[1:21:42] manifestations but we don't have them
[1:21:44] all do we brother Brown says if it did
[1:21:47] the world will be a flame with it
[1:21:49] you pick the greatest message church
[1:21:51] that there is and even then they don't
[1:21:53] have it all yet
[1:21:55] they might say they do but they don't
[1:21:56] because otherwise we'd see it
[1:21:59] why because the time's not ready yet
[1:22:01] because it has to be quick and short
[1:22:02] otherwise the whole world would see it
[1:22:04] and there'd be people that would be
[1:22:05] attracted to it it would make a mess of
[1:22:07] it all over again it's a quick short
[1:22:08] work and then we're out of here
[1:22:12] it's a quick short work it's always been
[1:22:13] that way God does it boom takes it and
[1:22:16] then everyone Falls away afterwards they
[1:22:18] mess it up and they do the and things
[1:22:19] but it won't be this time because he's
[1:22:21] promised he's going to take a bride out
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:24] listen you can have something and
[1:22:26] whatever you have that's real
[1:22:28] that's wonderful
[1:22:29] but don't make yourself pretend
[1:22:32] that you have something that you don't
[1:22:35] that's the trial for the bride is to say
[1:22:37] I believe it and not necessarily have it
[1:22:40] all
[1:22:41] because if you look at what happened
[1:22:42] when they went into Canaan it took them
[1:22:44] 10 years to get everything that God
[1:22:45] promised and then there was still work
[1:22:47] for them to do individually
[1:22:49] promise was no different on the day they
[1:22:51] went in than 10 years later but there
[1:22:52] was a process of time for God to give
[1:22:54] them everything that they were supposed
[1:22:55] to get
[1:22:57] look what brother Brown says he says
[1:22:58] your priest Your Leader or so forth can
[1:23:01] teach you your religion you can learn
[1:23:03] the message that we are trying to teach
[1:23:05] but that still won't give you eternal
[1:23:07] life
[1:23:09] this message
[1:23:13] he says you've got to accept the person
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ you understand that all of
[1:23:18] you you've got to accept the person
[1:23:20] Jesus Christ to have eternal life he
[1:23:22] says now sometimes other leadership gets
[1:23:24] so much influence on us till we don't
[1:23:27] know what to do then when that time
[1:23:29] comes
[1:23:32] that's not what a Ministry is supposed
[1:23:33] to be seeking as influence
[1:23:36] because if they're not there what are
[1:23:37] you going to do
[1:23:39] you've got to have your own influence
[1:23:41] it's got to be the great influencer
[1:23:43] himself Jesus Christ through the holy
[1:23:44] spirit in your life amen listen I
[1:23:46] believe that every gift is available to
[1:23:49] the bride of Christ today every single
[1:23:51] one faith and healings interpretation
[1:23:53] prophecy knowledge discernment Miracles
[1:23:55] Gifts of administration whatever it
[1:23:57] might be I believe every one of them is
[1:23:59] available to the bride today
[1:24:02] we know that the gifts were given back
[1:24:04] at the Azusa Street Revival they're
[1:24:06] available
[1:24:07] but that is not where we focus
[1:24:09] but they're available
[1:24:11] and I believe that as we need them and
[1:24:13] if we need them God will open them up in
[1:24:14] our lives and in our local body and
[1:24:16] these different things but we're being
[1:24:17] restored back to a word
[1:24:20] not just written
[1:24:23] not just written but a word person a
[1:24:26] word reality in the Holy Spirit a life
[1:24:28] in the Holy Spirit a power in the holy
[1:24:30] spirit that gives us overcoming victory
[1:24:32] in our life overcoming power inside of
[1:24:34] our Lives amen listen I'll take a simple
[1:24:37] humble Victorious Christian Life which
[1:24:39] is the sign of the Overcomer over gifts
[1:24:41] every day of the week
[1:24:43] but if there's a gift that's needed God
[1:24:45] help me to be ready for that gift and
[1:24:47] you to be ready for that gift
[1:24:50] heaven knows we don't want the
[1:24:51] Ministries to be doing it all right we
[1:24:54] want you guys involved we want everyone
[1:24:55] involved this is a body we're all
[1:24:57] supposed to be supplying these things
[1:24:58] amen but it's not gifts that we're
[1:25:00] seeking now but it's leadership and
[1:25:01] anointing
[1:25:03] because when you're anointed
[1:25:06] then God can use you for anything
[1:25:08] listen you can have a you don't have to
[1:25:10] have a gift of Prophecy to prophesy all
[1:25:13] you have to be is Sanctified and full of
[1:25:15] the Holy Spirit and God can drop down
[1:25:16] and use you in a service just like that
[1:25:19] then there are those that do it all the
[1:25:20] time Gifts of healing Gifts of Faith all
[1:25:22] these different things
[1:25:24] I believe that a brother or a sister can
[1:25:26] lay hands on somebody and pray for them
[1:25:27] and they can be healed they can be
[1:25:29] delivered they can do all of these
[1:25:30] things why because you're full of the
[1:25:32] Holy Ghost and it's using you to what do
[1:25:34] the things that are needed in the body
[1:25:36] each and every one of us
[1:25:39] just don't try to manufacture it
[1:25:41] like I said earlier brother Brad said we
[1:25:43] don't use the Holy Spirit it uses us
[1:25:45] and what happens is when we try and
[1:25:47] drive the agenda when we try and do
[1:25:48] things then what happens is we get ahead
[1:25:50] of it and we're going to fail miserably
[1:25:51] every time
[1:25:52] he says where is our faith to believe
[1:25:55] the simple word of
[1:25:59] listen scripture says that the the path
[1:26:02] the way to life he says is is so is so
[1:26:04] easy says that a fool won't err on it
[1:26:08] won't fall off of it he says where is
[1:26:11] our faith to believe the simple word of
[1:26:12] God just what God Said take him at his
[1:26:15] word god hides himself now in Simplicity
[1:26:18] in a humble little bunch he says but one
[1:26:21] of these days he'll manifest himself as
[1:26:23] he always has in the days passed by
[1:26:27] remember last year I was talking with
[1:26:29] another Minister kind of my age myself
[1:26:30] and we were talking about different
[1:26:32] Ministries and different men and
[1:26:34] different gifts and whatnot and he was
[1:26:36] sharing this story that a certain
[1:26:37] brother told him and I said I don't know
[1:26:39] about you but I've never experienced
[1:26:40] that he said neither have I and that was
[1:26:42] very refreshing for me
[1:26:44] because what happens so often is that a
[1:26:46] person has a gift or somebody has an
[1:26:48] experience and everybody wants to toe
[1:26:51] the line and come up and match them
[1:26:53] and so what happens and again you'll see
[1:26:55] this in ministers especially is that one
[1:26:57] man gets a gift of discernment and then
[1:26:58] everyone suddenly has discernment they
[1:27:00] say
[1:27:00] they say and they're this and they're
[1:27:01] that and they're this and they're that
[1:27:02] and I was refreshing for me that another
[1:27:04] man would say you know what I've never
[1:27:05] experienced that
[1:27:07] because he wasn't pretending and he
[1:27:08] didn't feel the need to pretend he
[1:27:10] didn't feel a need to lift himself
[1:27:11] higher than where he was at that point
[1:27:13] because what if he'll stay humble like
[1:27:14] that God will raise him higher than he
[1:27:16] is now
[1:27:17] if you'll stay humble that's what
[1:27:18] brother Gerald talked about on Wednesday
[1:27:19] night wasn't it how much time did he
[1:27:21] spend on humility
[1:27:24] so often we get lifted up in Pride
[1:27:25] because of what the word says to us
[1:27:26] rather than humbling ourselves to what
[1:27:28] the word says we ought to do
[1:27:29] let's humble ourselves to the word so
[1:27:31] that God Can Lift us up amen but like I
[1:27:33] said one person gets a gift one person
[1:27:35] gets a this or that and all of a sudden
[1:27:37] everybody's trying to do it and it makes
[1:27:38] a mess because only one of them is real
[1:27:39] and the rest are pretenders
[1:27:41] and that just leads to disappointment
[1:27:43] and failure for the people and for the
[1:27:44] Ministries themselves be what you are
[1:27:47] be what God made you to be stay in your
[1:27:49] lane
[1:27:50] stay in your land stay with your gifts
[1:27:52] stay with the thing that God's placed in
[1:27:53] your life and just stay simple with it
[1:27:55] and God will open it up if he needs to
[1:27:58] brother Brian says now just be yourself
[1:28:01] simple humble waiting for the coming of
[1:28:04] the Lord
[1:28:05] he says now we don't believe in glamor
[1:28:07] something's shining you know I always
[1:28:09] said Hollywood shines but Christianity
[1:28:11] glows there's a lot of difference
[1:28:13] between shining and glowing Hollywood
[1:28:15] shines with great class and society and
[1:28:17] glamor but the Christian grows with
[1:28:20] humility the way up is always down
[1:28:23] listen we have celebrities in this
[1:28:25] message
[1:28:27] whether you think it or not whether you
[1:28:28] believe it or not and it's not always
[1:28:30] because those men are lifting themselves
[1:28:32] up it's because the people will lift
[1:28:33] them up so often we've got Hollywood
[1:28:35] royalty in this in this message
[1:28:38] there are men that could do certain
[1:28:39] things and we'd let them do it
[1:28:41] because we believe so much in their gift
[1:28:43] and in their calling and that ought not
[1:28:44] to be
[1:28:45] every one of us is held accountable to
[1:28:47] this word
[1:28:48] amen
[1:28:49] a simple humble Victorious Christian
[1:28:51] walk is the son of the Overcomer not
[1:28:53] gifts
[1:28:54] not gifts listen gifts
[1:28:58] for one they're outside of repentance
[1:28:59] the scripture says
[1:29:01] so you can have a gift and never be
[1:29:02] sealed with the Holy Spirit
[1:29:04] so why would you follow a gift
[1:29:07] listen Cora had a gift
[1:29:10] and look what happened to him
[1:29:12] Balaam had a gift
[1:29:14] Balaam was a prophet
[1:29:16] and look what happened to him
[1:29:18] you've got to follow the word not these
[1:29:20] men amen secondly gifts will fail First
[1:29:24] Corinthians 13 says there's only thing
[1:29:25] that what one thing that doesn't fail
[1:29:27] what is it
[1:29:28] God's love it's the only thing he says
[1:29:30] where there's prophecy it'll fail where
[1:29:32] there's Visions they'll fail and tongues
[1:29:34] and all these things he says they'll
[1:29:34] always fail they'll fall away
[1:29:37] or the people that have them will fail
[1:29:39] but he says one thing that won't fail is
[1:29:41] God's love for you that's
[1:29:43] through in these things
[1:29:45] get back to Exodus
[1:29:46] what I'm saying is don't get caught up
[1:29:48] on a minor
[1:29:50] don't get caught up in a minor the major
[1:29:52] is always the word
[1:29:53] the major is always the word after that
[1:29:56] everything comes second
[1:29:58] Exodus 23 21 says beware of this Angel
[1:30:01] and obey his voice provoke him not for
[1:30:04] he will not pardon your transgressions
[1:30:06] for my name is in him how many times did
[1:30:09] the children of God provoke God
[1:30:11] children of Israel time and time again
[1:30:14] they provoked them and they provoked him
[1:30:15] and he's warning them before they get
[1:30:17] too far into the desert he says when you
[1:30:19] go when you cross over don't provoke him
[1:30:22] you see what happened after somebody
[1:30:23] provoked him what happened when Aiken
[1:30:25] provoked him
[1:30:27] everybody died in Aiken's family his
[1:30:29] wife his kids his animals everything
[1:30:30] they killed it all buried it and then
[1:30:32] moved on and went into victory God
[1:30:34] doesn't mess around when you cross over
[1:30:36] like that
[1:30:37] when he's Justified you when he
[1:30:38] Sanctified you once he crosses you over
[1:30:40] into the into the land of promise he
[1:30:42] says this is a different game now I need
[1:30:44] a different kind of people and you can't
[1:30:46] be wishy-washy you can't be up and down
[1:30:47] you can't be provoking by complaining
[1:30:51] you can't be provoking by looking back
[1:30:52] and saying I liked it better the old way
[1:30:55] then you've got to be able to move with
[1:30:56] him as he leads and guides
[1:30:59] what is it we've got to be able to trust
[1:31:00] God no matter what the picture looks
[1:31:02] like today no matter what the situation
[1:31:04] looks like that's what determines what
[1:31:06] we really think of him amen we're
[1:31:07] trusting him to take us to the good
[1:31:09] picture when even when it doesn't look
[1:31:10] so good right now
[1:31:12] first Thessalonians 5 8 says in
[1:31:14] everything give thanks
[1:31:18] in everything give thanks for this what
[1:31:21] everything is the will of God in Christ
[1:31:24] Jesus concerning you listen our
[1:31:26] attitudes towards God when things don't
[1:31:28] look so good is what really shows us
[1:31:30] what we think of him
[1:31:32] because in a relationship if
[1:31:34] everything's good and hunky dory all the
[1:31:36] time and you've got a great relationship
[1:31:37] that is no test or proof of your
[1:31:39] relationship
[1:31:40] if you've got all the money in the bank
[1:31:41] great health you know everybody's the
[1:31:43] the size weight and shape that they want
[1:31:45] to be and and everything's good and
[1:31:47] fulfilling that's not a hard
[1:31:48] relationship to be in but when things go
[1:31:51] south and all of a sudden there isn't so
[1:31:52] much money or or somebody lose gains
[1:31:55] weight or or the money's not in the bank
[1:31:57] or or their stresses in life and these
[1:31:59] different things and things change
[1:32:00] that's the real test of relationship
[1:32:02] I know a man that made a lot of money
[1:32:04] this is this is an actual story I know a
[1:32:06] man that made a lot of money and life
[1:32:09] was great and he had all sorts of trips
[1:32:10] and travel and good times and and all of
[1:32:13] these things and his wife was wonderful
[1:32:15] to be around
[1:32:16] she was so dedicated and and so good to
[1:32:19] him and so so happy and so contented and
[1:32:22] as soon as he lost his money and he lost
[1:32:24] every penny
[1:32:25] she said this isn't fun anymore
[1:32:28] and she left
[1:32:30] that showed what she really thought of
[1:32:32] him
[1:32:33] that she was there for what he had not
[1:32:35] for who he was
[1:32:36] and sometimes God will take away
[1:32:38] something we have to see if we're there
[1:32:39] for what he has or for who he is
[1:32:42] because when the chips are down when
[1:32:44] things aren't going so good the question
[1:32:46] is is this about him or is it about his
[1:32:48] gifts is about his provision is about
[1:32:50] his healing is it about all of these
[1:32:52] different things there's that song that
[1:32:53] says help me want to give her more than
[1:32:55] the giving
[1:32:56] and I believe that sometimes a test for
[1:32:58] the Believers is are you just looking
[1:33:00] for what he has rather than who he is
[1:33:03] I'm reminded of job
[1:33:05] what a believer
[1:33:08] in just a few a few short days or weeks
[1:33:11] God allowed job to lose all of his
[1:33:14] possessions and all of his children all
[1:33:17] of his wealth
[1:33:18] even
[1:33:20] his influence to where he was called a
[1:33:22] secret sinner
[1:33:24] when he had all of his wealth and when
[1:33:25] he had all of his family nobody would
[1:33:26] dare
[1:33:27] accuse job of that but as soon as he
[1:33:29] lost everything all of a sudden it comes
[1:33:30] out of the woodwork people are saying
[1:33:32] maybe you really are a sinner Joe
[1:33:34] maybe you aren't as good as we thought
[1:33:35] you were job
[1:33:37] but God took the lives of his children
[1:33:39] in a sudden tragic event and job gets
[1:33:41] all that news and I want you to look at
[1:33:43] what job does when he gets the news
[1:33:45] then job arose and tore his mantle and
[1:33:48] shaved his head and fell down upon the
[1:33:50] ground you'd say he's getting ready to
[1:33:52] mourn but what is he does what does he
[1:33:54] do and worshiped
[1:33:57] and said naked came out of my father
[1:33:59] mother's womb and naked shall I return
[1:34:01] there the lord gave and the Lord had
[1:34:03] taken away blessed be the name of the
[1:34:06] Lord in all of this job's sin not nor
[1:34:09] charge God foolishly when he's tearing
[1:34:12] his clothes and shaving his head and all
[1:34:14] these things you think he's really tore
[1:34:15] up about this and he was church
[1:34:18] it's never good when a parent buries a
[1:34:21] child
[1:34:24] and you say job was he's tore up about
[1:34:26] this
[1:34:27] he's really sad and he is but the first
[1:34:30] thing job does is he worships God
[1:34:33] he's lost everything Church everything
[1:34:37] and he falls on his knees and he
[1:34:39] worships God
[1:34:40] can we do that
[1:34:42] can we do that that's a challenge this
[1:34:43] morning when everything falls apart
[1:34:45] praise His name
[1:34:49] why did he worship
[1:34:53] why was the first thing he did worship
[1:34:56] job every day worship God do you know
[1:34:58] that
[1:34:59] and he'd sacrifice for his children job
[1:35:02] had a relationship with God
[1:35:04] and it was not based on the fact that he
[1:35:06] was wealthy or had great kids or had no
[1:35:09] issues in life that he had his health
[1:35:10] and all these different things he knew
[1:35:12] that God gave it to him and God would
[1:35:13] take it away and that didn't change a
[1:35:15] thing about God
[1:35:17] didn't change a thing about God whether
[1:35:19] God gave it or God took it away job
[1:35:21] loved God and he knew the reality of God
[1:35:23] in his life
[1:35:24] but listen when it was all said and done
[1:35:27] job did more than worship
[1:35:29] because he got a revelation
[1:35:31] he got a revelation that he wasn't just
[1:35:33] going to raise on the other side
[1:35:36] that those children were waiting for him
[1:35:38] over there
[1:35:39] that he hadn't lost anything he'd lost
[1:35:41] them here
[1:35:42] but he hadn't lost them over there
[1:35:44] and he says I know my redeemer liveth
[1:35:48] and all the the fleshwarms destroy this
[1:35:50] body says he says yet I know that I'll
[1:35:52] see him
[1:35:53] job never had that understanding he had
[1:35:55] that question before all of this and
[1:35:57] when it was all said and done he came
[1:35:58] out and he had the answer that he'd been
[1:36:00] asking his whole life
[1:36:01] and God allowed all of those things to
[1:36:03] be taken away from him just so Joe could
[1:36:05] get a revelation of the what the reality
[1:36:07] of the resurrection of the Dead
[1:36:09] if God could only let us see and we
[1:36:11] could catch and hold on to the
[1:36:12] revelation of what lays Beyond this
[1:36:14] trial what lays Beyond this world what
[1:36:17] lays Beyond this testing what lays
[1:36:19] Beyond these hard times that we go
[1:36:20] through and if we could hold on to that
[1:36:22] Revelation it'll carry us through what
[1:36:24] we're going through today amen
[1:36:26] we sing that song in the good times
[1:36:27] praise His name in The Bad Times do the
[1:36:30] same in everything give the King of
[1:36:32] Kings all the praise
[1:36:35] what's our response going to be Church
[1:36:39] they're going to be worship
[1:36:42] listen we're allowed to mourn
[1:36:44] we're allowed to mourn lost it's not
[1:36:46] wrong to do that
[1:36:48] just don't blame it on God
[1:36:51] say Lord I trust you I love you and I
[1:36:54] know you love me
[1:36:55] and I know you've done this for a reason
[1:36:57] it says in all this job sin not nor
[1:36:59] charged nor accused God foolishly
[1:37:03] in fact Exodus 23 it says but if
[1:37:06] Thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[1:37:09] and do all that I speak then I will be
[1:37:13] an enemy unto thine enemies and an
[1:37:15] adversary unto thine adversaries the
[1:37:18] programmers were no you used to have the
[1:37:19] if then statements if this then do that
[1:37:22] and God said this is so different if you
[1:37:24] obey his voice if you follow his
[1:37:25] leadership then I'll be an enemy to your
[1:37:28] enemy and I'll be an adversary to your
[1:37:30] adversaries listen I've said it before
[1:37:32] I'll say it again you can't be neutral
[1:37:34] there is no neutrality in this word in
[1:37:36] this world you're either for God and he
[1:37:39] says if you're not for me you're against
[1:37:40] me you can't stand there and see how
[1:37:42] it's going to play out you've got to
[1:37:44] make a choice you've got to make a
[1:37:45] decision am I for God or am I not
[1:37:48] because if you're not you're just as if
[1:37:49] you're fighting against them even if
[1:37:50] you're not doing anything
[1:37:52] you obey God God goes to battle for you
[1:37:54] that's the way this works you follow the
[1:37:57] leading of the Holy Spirit you do what
[1:37:58] the word says now God's got something to
[1:38:00] act on because your faith
[1:38:02] has manifested because you've taken a
[1:38:04] stand for the word of God and now God's
[1:38:06] got something to work with God's got his
[1:38:07] word to back up because remember God
[1:38:09] doesn't back up his children
[1:38:11] you'll never find the scripture where
[1:38:12] God says I'll back up my children
[1:38:14] he says I'll back up my word
[1:38:16] so you got to get with the word you got
[1:38:18] to get on his side so that he can back
[1:38:19] you up in these things amen how many
[1:38:22] times in the the last service I spoke
[1:38:24] did did we cover where God said stay
[1:38:26] with the word stay with the word stay
[1:38:27] with the word and we talked about
[1:38:29] brother Bradham and that vision of the
[1:38:31] bribe where he said stay in line stay in
[1:38:32] line stay in line why because if you
[1:38:34] stay in line with the word then God can
[1:38:36] battle for you but otherwise you're left
[1:38:38] to to do things on your own and that's
[1:38:40] never going to work out well
[1:38:42] don't give yourself an excuse to step
[1:38:44] away from it
[1:38:46] excuses we have many
[1:38:49] we have so many excuses church for the
[1:38:51] believer there's no excuse to step away
[1:38:53] from the word
[1:38:54] he says for mine Angel if you do all
[1:38:56] this he says mine Angel shall go before
[1:38:59] thee and bring thee in
[1:39:01] you say praise the Lord and then watch
[1:39:03] what he's bringing you into the amorites
[1:39:05] Hittites parasites Canaanites heavites
[1:39:07] the jebusites he says but I will cut
[1:39:10] them off when you think of an
[1:39:11] inheritance and
[1:39:14] you know maybe our parents have done
[1:39:16] really well and and they say I've left
[1:39:18] you an inheritance when I die you're
[1:39:20] going to get an inheritance and we think
[1:39:21] oh it's a a lovely Cottage by the lake
[1:39:23] or by the Sea and I can go there and I
[1:39:26] can relax on the weekends and enjoy the
[1:39:28] outdoors and get away from it all and
[1:39:30] disconnect from from the networks and
[1:39:33] work and all these different things or
[1:39:35] maybe it's a wonderfully maintained home
[1:39:37] in the city where you know it's close to
[1:39:39] school and it's close to church and
[1:39:40] shopping and it's a place that's paid
[1:39:42] off
[1:39:44] and you say that's the kind of
[1:39:45] inheritance I'm looking for
[1:39:47] maybe it's a successful business
[1:39:50] and Daddy's just going to hand me over
[1:39:51] his successful business and I'm going to
[1:39:52] make hundreds of thousands of dollars a
[1:39:54] year or I'll sell it for millions and
[1:39:56] I'm set for life that's the kind of
[1:39:57] inheritance we all want isn't it
[1:39:59] if our parents are going to leave us we
[1:40:01] want that kind of an inheritance brother
[1:40:02] Bob we want a good one
[1:40:04] this
[1:40:06] this is God's inheritance
[1:40:08] I've given you a land and it's full of
[1:40:10] amorites Hittites parasites Canaanites
[1:40:12] hivites and jebusites
[1:40:15] not a whole lot of rest to relaxation
[1:40:17] initially for God's inheritance but it's
[1:40:20] still God's inheritance isn't it
[1:40:23] he says my angel is going to lead you
[1:40:25] into the middle of a bunch of people
[1:40:27] that want to kill you
[1:40:30] demonic powers
[1:40:32] unbelievers
[1:40:34] people that don't like you people that
[1:40:35] don't you want you in their business
[1:40:36] people that don't want you around people
[1:40:38] that don't want your testimony people
[1:40:40] that don't want your your code of
[1:40:42] conduct your dress whatever it might be
[1:40:43] to convict them he leads you into the
[1:40:46] middle of all of them
[1:40:47] and then he says I'll cut them
[1:40:50] up but your inheritance is in the midst
[1:40:53] what did David say he says Thou prepares
[1:40:55] the table before me in the presence of
[1:40:57] mine enemies
[1:40:59] thou anoint us my head with oil surely
[1:41:01] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:41:03] the days of my life Church God's
[1:41:05] inheritance looks a lot like work
[1:41:09] I'm sorry to say it but that's what it
[1:41:10] looks like and we're going to cover that
[1:41:11] maybe a bit in the next service or two
[1:41:12] brother Brian puts it this way he says
[1:41:14] now could you imagine God said there's a
[1:41:16] land over there that's flowing with milk
[1:41:18] and honey and I've given it to you it's
[1:41:20] yours
[1:41:21] and we say praise the Lord
[1:41:23] but now before you get into it you've
[1:41:26] got to knock down all the hivites and
[1:41:28] the jeopicites and all those other
[1:41:30] different ites before you got it got to
[1:41:33] it
[1:41:34] he says now that was strange wasn't it
[1:41:35] now the people today is that the same
[1:41:38] thing God has given you a promise of
[1:41:39] Divine Healing he's given you a promise
[1:41:41] of divine Health he's given you all
[1:41:43] these promises but you're afraid to face
[1:41:45] the enemy that's trying to Buck you off
[1:41:46] from it he says that's exact exactly
[1:41:48] right we're not serving a God that
[1:41:51] coddles us
[1:41:54] he's preparing soldiers he's preparing
[1:41:56] Warriors
[1:41:58] listen he's going to come back with ten
[1:41:59] thousand times thousands of his Saints
[1:42:01] in the Millennium and there's going to
[1:42:03] be war and we're going to be a part of
[1:42:05] it
[1:42:05] but you got to win a battle here and
[1:42:07] that's what this is all about amen he
[1:42:09] builds us up so that we can what get to
[1:42:11] the place where we'll trust him and he
[1:42:13] can trust us and then he'll start to use
[1:42:15] us for the victories that he intends
[1:42:17] amen God trains us always for a future
[1:42:19] purpose
[1:42:21] and even if you're in a battle now he'll
[1:42:22] use the battle now for the next battle
[1:42:24] later and the experience and the Victory
[1:42:26] and the lessons learned and all these
[1:42:27] different things to do what gets you to
[1:42:29] the place where you can take possession
[1:42:30] of what God has ordained for you in his
[1:42:32] word
[1:42:35] and in all of it he says nothing will
[1:42:37] stand before you
[1:42:38] nothing will stand before you if you
[1:42:40] follow that angel if you follow my word
[1:42:42] nothing's going to stand in front of you
[1:42:44] that's the promise he gave
[1:42:47] he says Now isn't it strange he says
[1:42:49] it's yours but it's full of Hittites and
[1:42:52] jebusites and Canaanites and all kinds
[1:42:54] of enemies in there they're rolled up
[1:42:56] heavy now it's yours go take it it's
[1:42:58] yours now I give it to you but you go
[1:43:00] get it now that's people today if you'd
[1:43:03] only see when I tell you about Divine
[1:43:05] Healing you'd say well brother Bradham
[1:43:07] look I was prayed for last night I can't
[1:43:09] move my hand anymore that don't have one
[1:43:11] thing to do with it not a thing it's
[1:43:13] yours go get it sure he says God gives
[1:43:15] it to you
[1:43:17] God didn't just get up there and take
[1:43:19] his brush and sweep them out loud and
[1:43:21] said now come in here you are sit down
[1:43:27] he says never did God do that you show
[1:43:30] me your faith without your works and
[1:43:31] I'll show you my faith by my work see
[1:43:33] you've got to go do it and you've got to
[1:43:36] fight for every inch of ground that you
[1:43:38] have he said every man in here
[1:43:41] every woman in here that's born again of
[1:43:44] the spirit of God knows that you've had
[1:43:47] to fight for every inch of ground until
[1:43:50] the mark with Satan
[1:43:52] listen it is a battle it is a struggle
[1:43:54] it is a fight to get anything
[1:43:57] that is good
[1:43:59] when it comes to the things of God
[1:44:02] you've had to fight for every inch of
[1:44:04] ground tow the mark of with Satan isn't
[1:44:06] that right he says friends this is not a
[1:44:09] picnic this is a Battleground see we
[1:44:12] never come here to eat cookies and so
[1:44:14] forth we're in a battle listen cook
[1:44:17] eaters don't need the armor of God
[1:44:20] cookie eaters don't need a sword
[1:44:23] we need those things because it's going
[1:44:25] to be a battle amen
[1:44:27] he says the doctors say the mirac days
[1:44:29] of Miracles has passed I believe in
[1:44:32] doctors I find more believing doctors
[1:44:33] than I find believing preachers that's
[1:44:35] right more doctors believe in Divine
[1:44:37] Healing but there are some of them
[1:44:38] they've got some cracks we got them on
[1:44:41] both sides it's true but let me tell you
[1:44:42] that preacher or doctor or whoever it is
[1:44:45] that don't believe that almighty God can
[1:44:46] do all things set it aside God is
[1:44:49] Almighty
[1:44:52] we are Christians
[1:44:54] we believe the truth of God and we must
[1:44:57] stand for the truth of God and we must
[1:45:00] live the truth of God
[1:45:02] and every promise is ours that God gave
[1:45:05] to us he says let's go get it amen
[1:45:09] he's pumping us up
[1:45:12] but he's not also
[1:45:13] minimizing the work we're going to have
[1:45:15] to do
[1:45:16] but how many times did God say I've
[1:45:19] given it into your hands I'll lead the
[1:45:22] way I'll deliver you I'll cut them off
[1:45:24] I'll give you Victory I'll give you
[1:45:26] overcoming power I'll lead you and guide
[1:45:28] you into everything that you have need
[1:45:30] of just follow me
[1:45:32] just follow and you've got to be able to
[1:45:34] take that first step and then the next
[1:45:36] step and the next step as he leads and
[1:45:39] that's where you're going to find your
[1:45:40] victory
[1:45:42] he says Thou shalt not bow down to their
[1:45:44] gods nor serve them nor do after their
[1:45:46] works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow
[1:45:48] them and quite break down their image
[1:45:51] images
[1:45:53] listen sometimes we see things in battle
[1:45:55] that our flesh likes
[1:45:57] you get hanging around with certain
[1:45:58] people and you get in certain situations
[1:46:00] and guess what you can see something
[1:46:02] that your eye likes Aiken saw something
[1:46:04] he liked he liked the clothes he liked
[1:46:07] the gold and he liked the silver didn't
[1:46:09] he
[1:46:10] he liked that Babylonian garment
[1:46:12] listen we pick on the sisters so often
[1:46:15] not pick on them we we warn them because
[1:46:17] I believe the danger is greatest for
[1:46:18] them but listen we're getting to the
[1:46:20] place where we've got to talk to men
[1:46:21] about what they wear
[1:46:22] and the haircuts they have seen it in
[1:46:25] Preachers now Church
[1:46:26] where they're changing their hairstyles
[1:46:28] to match what the world is doing and I
[1:46:30] say what in the world is leading you to
[1:46:32] that
[1:46:33] what in the world is leading you do that
[1:46:34] what are you feeding on that makes you
[1:46:36] think that you need a new hairstyle now
[1:46:37] I've had two hairstyles in my life two
[1:46:40] on my face and two up top and that's
[1:46:42] based on how much hair I had
[1:46:44] that's what makes me change my hair
[1:46:46] stylist how much hair I actually have so
[1:46:48] I've got to cover the balding spots now
[1:46:50] right
[1:46:51] but listen the fact that we're having to
[1:46:53] talk to Brothers about stay away from
[1:46:55] the the clothing of the world and the
[1:46:58] hairstyles of the world and these
[1:46:59] different things
[1:47:00] God help us church God help us when
[1:47:03] we're having to talk to them the sisters
[1:47:05] I understand listen it's it's a lot
[1:47:08] harder to find clothes than these
[1:47:09] different things that are that are
[1:47:10] modest and whatnot
[1:47:12] but when our brothers are doing it I say
[1:47:14] where has the spirit of God gone
[1:47:17] where has the spirit of God gone I'm
[1:47:19] happy to see that we aren't changing
[1:47:21] here
[1:47:23] especially brother Chad
[1:47:25] amen
[1:47:26] amen but you know what brother Chad
[1:47:28] could do stuff with his beard and
[1:47:29] everything like that and make himself
[1:47:30] all this set and the other thing listen
[1:47:31] you want to find a way to be like the
[1:47:33] world you'll find a way to be with the
[1:47:34] world but he says listen when you're in
[1:47:36] the battle and you come across something
[1:47:38] and sometimes our flesh will respond to
[1:47:40] it I've talked many times about how I
[1:47:42] like cars anything with a motor guess
[1:47:44] what that's why I stay away from battles
[1:47:46] with motors
[1:47:47] just leave it away don't go down that
[1:47:49] road John because that's a weakness for
[1:47:51] me it's something that I can get caught
[1:47:52] up in if I start trying to deal with it
[1:47:54] too much so I just stay away from it and
[1:47:57] you've got your place stay away from it
[1:47:58] kill it now
[1:48:00] kill it now while it doesn't have any
[1:48:03] power while God's given you the victory
[1:48:04] kill it now and get ahead of it and
[1:48:06] destroy it completely and don't leave
[1:48:08] any strings or or anything attached to
[1:48:10] it that's the worst thing is when you
[1:48:12] keep those contacts you keep those
[1:48:13] friends you keep those inroads into
[1:48:15] where you used to be
[1:48:16] burn your Bridges get away from it
[1:48:19] destroy it while you have it amen listen
[1:48:21] we can get caught up in church Hannity
[1:48:22] too
[1:48:24] absolutely we can amen
[1:48:27] by that I mean we get caught up in
[1:48:28] what's happening in other churches
[1:48:30] and we try and bring it here
[1:48:32] you want something to happen in this
[1:48:34] church get down on your knees and pray
[1:48:36] to God for right here
[1:48:39] I heard a guy say you've probably all
[1:48:41] heard of this is it Asbury
[1:48:43] this revival thing that was going on in
[1:48:45] that college town they called the Asbury
[1:48:47] Revival it's just a bunch of worship
[1:48:49] there's I don't think they're actually
[1:48:50] preaching the word so we know it's not
[1:48:52] going to last very long if they're just
[1:48:53] singing all the time but he said he this
[1:48:57] lady said I drove 17 hours to go to the
[1:48:59] Asbury Revival and he said and you won't
[1:49:01] get on your knees and pray for 17
[1:49:03] minutes
[1:49:04] what are you expecting you're going
[1:49:06] where somebody else has done the work
[1:49:08] and expecting to get the results you get
[1:49:10] the results by doing the same work that
[1:49:12] they did get down on your knees get
[1:49:13] serious with God sanctify your life get
[1:49:16] close to the word and the things of God
[1:49:17] and you'll start to see a change in your
[1:49:19] life you'll start to see a change in
[1:49:20] your church you can change the ministry
[1:49:22] just by what you're doing in your life
[1:49:24] absolutely 100 percent
[1:49:26] listen if God's giving you what you need
[1:49:28] through the ministry
[1:49:30] then as you grow then the ministry will
[1:49:32] grow to accommodate
[1:49:35] I can't grow brother Gerald can't grow
[1:49:37] until the people grow because what is
[1:49:38] the point of me growing if you can't
[1:49:39] keep up
[1:49:41] not that I'm ahead but you know what I'm
[1:49:42] saying the feeding of the people will be
[1:49:44] where the people are for that time so as
[1:49:46] you grow the ministry will grow with you
[1:49:48] so if you want me to grow if you want
[1:49:50] brother Joe to grow then you start
[1:49:51] growing and start driving it in your
[1:49:53] personal life in your prayer life in
[1:49:55] your devotion lives and you'll see that
[1:49:56] you'll start to get to a place in the
[1:49:58] word where you need a higher level of
[1:49:59] preaching and the ministry will rise to
[1:50:01] meet it because the holy spirit's there
[1:50:02] to take you where you need to go and
[1:50:04] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:50:06] amen
[1:50:07] listen we can we can look at the
[1:50:09] different song leaders we can look at
[1:50:11] the different music Styles and
[1:50:12] everything they do and all of a sudden
[1:50:13] we can start be trying to be that listen
[1:50:15] we're a sovereign body we're a sovereign
[1:50:17] church with Sovereign gifts that God has
[1:50:19] placed here let's be Who We Are
[1:50:22] God has blessed us God has blessed us
[1:50:24] that we have who we have and what we
[1:50:26] have
[1:50:27] in the worship and in the in the music
[1:50:28] and these different things we don't need
[1:50:30] anything big what we need is people that
[1:50:32] are dedicated and led by the Holy Spirit
[1:50:34] that's all we need that's all we need
[1:50:36] how many times I mean you let me speak
[1:50:39] carnally for a second if I can put that
[1:50:41] way you listen to brother Brandon
[1:50:42] singing brother Brandon was not a great
[1:50:44] singer listen they didn't have great
[1:50:45] musicians there but how many of us can
[1:50:47] say that we've stood up in the and the
[1:50:49] piano kept playing the great physician
[1:50:51] now is near the sympathizing Jesus
[1:50:53] look I'll take that
[1:50:56] over somebody that can play anything in
[1:50:58] the world
[1:51:00] and then we want the holy spirit in our
[1:51:01] services
[1:51:03] not just gifts and Personalities in
[1:51:05] these things amen we want the reality of
[1:51:06] God in the individuals within this
[1:51:08] church amen
[1:51:12] because although above all those things
[1:51:14] we want the Gift Giver not
[1:51:17] that yes we want signs and wonders but I
[1:51:19] want the sign maker
[1:51:21] more than I want the signs and wonders
[1:51:23] amen that's what I want a reality and
[1:51:25] God says break down every Idol
[1:51:27] don't let their worship become your
[1:51:29] worship
[1:51:30] don't let the little thing that they
[1:51:31] have in their life become the little
[1:51:32] thing in your
[1:51:35] in you because sometimes as Believers we
[1:51:36] think we can handle it
[1:51:38] sometimes what happens is you're going
[1:51:40] through a battle and you're running
[1:51:41] across a believer that has given up on
[1:51:43] the battle you're trying to win
[1:51:45] and you say I don't need to fight
[1:51:46] because they don't have to fight
[1:51:48] they've accepted in their life that
[1:51:51] they're going to have this habit this
[1:51:52] problem the situation for the rest of
[1:51:54] their life and you can stop because they
[1:51:56] stopped that's churchanity
[1:51:58] that's a false idol that's something
[1:52:00] that they've allowed to creep into their
[1:52:02] life you don't have to stop because
[1:52:03] somebody else didn't get the victory if
[1:52:05] your heart is telling you to keep going
[1:52:06] on if your conscience says there's more
[1:52:08] if there's a cry in your heart for
[1:52:10] something greater you keep going even if
[1:52:12] they have stopped amen though none go
[1:52:14] with me still I will follow with a song
[1:52:16] says amen let's keep going as he leads
[1:52:18] us
[1:52:21] Let the Fire of God consume that failing
[1:52:23] in your life destroy it all break it
[1:52:25] down
[1:52:27] ashes
[1:52:28] hard to put something back together when
[1:52:30] it's in ashes
[1:52:31] don't get complacent amen
[1:52:34] but Brown puts it this way he says the
[1:52:35] first thing you know you go to petting
[1:52:37] your sickness around petting your little
[1:52:40] petties around and things like that
[1:52:41] because your neighbor don't believe in
[1:52:42] healing your neighbor don't believe in
[1:52:44] the Holy Ghost he says destroy the thing
[1:52:49] the thing let's go over and take the
[1:52:51] land Hallelujah God said it's ours and
[1:52:54] if he said it's ours it belongs to us
[1:52:55] the promise is unto you and to your
[1:52:58] children and to your children's children
[1:53:00] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:53:03] amen he says that's what the matter with
[1:53:05] the church today we've got a wishbone
[1:53:07] instead of a backbone what we need is
[1:53:09] something in there that'll stand you
[1:53:13] amen every man that ever amounted to a
[1:53:16] hill of beans had to fight for what he
[1:53:20] if you're not fighting you're not moving
[1:53:22] forward
[1:53:23] it's just a simple fact of it because
[1:53:25] everything that God has is surrounded by
[1:53:27] the enemies it's surmounted by demonic
[1:53:29] forces it's surrounded by people it's
[1:53:31] surrounded by situations it's surrounded
[1:53:32] by decisions that you've got to make
[1:53:34] based on the word of God any man that
[1:53:37] ever amounted to a hill of beans had to
[1:53:38] fight for what he got God don't give it
[1:53:40] to you on a silver platter he said
[1:53:42] there's the promised land she's flowing
[1:53:44] with milk and honey but before you get
[1:53:46] there you're going to have to go through
[1:53:47] all these hivites and Canaanites and
[1:53:49] everything but don't you bow to one of
[1:53:51] them you destroy the things as you come
[1:53:55] to them
[1:53:56] stop building a fire on the enemy's
[1:53:59] altar amen oh I like that destroy the
[1:54:02] things as you come to them
[1:54:04] listen sufficient to the day is the evil
[1:54:06] thereof the scripture says don't be
[1:54:08] looking ahead and fighting what's ahead
[1:54:10] fight what's in front of you right now
[1:54:11] deal with the situation that's in front
[1:54:13] of you right now deal with the trial
[1:54:15] deal with the struggle right here don't
[1:54:17] borrow from tomorrow
[1:54:19] listen what you're dealing with 10 miles
[1:54:22] down the road don't worry about it
[1:54:23] because if you don't defeat what's in
[1:54:25] front of you today you're never going to
[1:54:26] get to what's down the road fight the
[1:54:28] battle that he has put in front of you
[1:54:29] because he's LED you to that battle
[1:54:31] because you can win it
[1:54:33] you're in the battle today that you can
[1:54:35] win so don't worry about the Battle
[1:54:37] tomorrow that's the battle for tomorrow
[1:54:39] fight the one that's in front of you get
[1:54:41] the victory today the Habit you're
[1:54:42] dealing with today fight it today
[1:54:45] don't say I got another habit I gotta
[1:54:47] defeat defeat the Habit that God has put
[1:54:49] on your conscience defeat the Habit that
[1:54:50] God you bowed down defeat the thing
[1:54:52] that's holding you back remove the
[1:54:54] hindrance that's in your life today and
[1:54:56] then we'll worry about the other one
[1:54:57] tomorrow and the one after that the day
[1:54:59] after and the week after and the month
[1:55:00] after once you get one Victory he'll
[1:55:02] move you on to the next Victory move you
[1:55:04] on to the next Victory move you on to
[1:55:05] the next
[1:55:06] fee man
[1:55:08] if you're led by the Holy Spirit
[1:55:10] the battle he wants you to fight and
[1:55:12] you'll get the victory every single time
[1:55:16] the time is going to matter
[1:55:18] it's going to be different for every
[1:55:19] time
[1:55:20] every battle is different
[1:55:22] every situation is different
[1:55:24] the battle you're in is the one that
[1:55:25] he's given you to be victorious soon
[1:55:28] as we close he says You Shall Serve the
[1:55:31] Lord your God and he shall bless thy
[1:55:33] bread
[1:55:34] and thy water
[1:55:36] and I will take sickness away from the
[1:55:38] midst of Thee
[1:55:40] you say brother John I got needs
[1:55:43] problems we've got struggles
[1:55:45] trials
[1:55:47] my spouse is bothering me I'm bothering
[1:55:50] my spouse
[1:55:51] weight issues whatever it is
[1:55:54] he says you serve the Lord your God
[1:55:58] I'll take care of the rest
[1:56:01] all you're asked to do Church
[1:56:03] follow the word
[1:56:05] obey the word
[1:56:06] seek the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:08] and he takes care of everything else he
[1:56:11] says I'll bless your bread I'll give you
[1:56:13] food to eat
[1:56:14] he says I'll satisfy your thirst and
[1:56:16] take away anything that's by
[1:56:19] that's it
[1:56:24] we read that quote earlier where brother
[1:56:25] Brown says can we believe or accept the
[1:56:28] simple word of God
[1:56:31] we've made it so complicated
[1:56:34] just obey the word
[1:56:36] seek the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:38] and God will take care of the rest
[1:56:39] that's it
[1:56:41] in quietness in humility
[1:56:43] that's it that's all he's looking for
[1:56:46] is a bride that'll seek Him and listen
[1:56:49] and he'll lead her exactly where she
[1:56:50] needs to go
[1:56:52] one more quote before we close he says
[1:56:54] God's here leading you
[1:56:58] that's what's talking to your heart and
[1:57:01] telling you to do it is the Holy Spirit
[1:57:03] now I can see the people as they went
[1:57:05] marching on but did you notice the angel
[1:57:08] of the Lord went into Jordan before them
[1:57:10] I like that the angel of God took Jordan
[1:57:12] first the angel of God will lead you
[1:57:15] every step of the way
[1:57:17] sometimes you think that the trials are
[1:57:19] hard
[1:57:20] God ain't in no hurry you're the only
[1:57:22] one that's in a hurry God let the Hebrew
[1:57:25] children go right in the fiery furnace
[1:57:27] he let Daniel get right in the Lion's
[1:57:29] Den and everything before he ever come
[1:57:31] he says just rise up and start walking
[1:57:34] by faith
[1:57:35] God I believe
[1:57:37] I'm Bound for the promised land god you
[1:57:41] promised it to me and here I come I'm
[1:57:43] following the leading of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:45] I'm going out of here tonight I'm going
[1:57:48] to prove to the world that I'm a
[1:57:50] Believer in Christ Jesus I accept my
[1:57:52] healing and I walk by faith right now I
[1:57:56] believe it he says I like that I mean
[1:57:59] God bless you let's stand
[1:58:05] when it was all said and done
[1:58:07] God told 601 000 men cross over
[1:58:11] he says and go to swinging
[1:58:13] go to fighting
[1:58:15] footsteps his possession how many times
[1:58:17] have we heard footsteps is possession
[1:58:20] don't worry about how many footsteps you
[1:58:22] take every day just take one get the one
[1:58:24] footstep every day and you'll eventually
[1:58:26] conquer your land amen don't fall back
[1:58:29] don't fall back keep pressing
[1:58:31] all you have to do he says is cross over
[1:58:33] and follow me and I'll be the one that
[1:58:35] gives you what I promised you I'll be
[1:58:37] the one that drives him up before he
[1:58:39] says I'll send Hornets before you
[1:58:41] I'll make their life miserable it amazes
[1:58:43] me how that when the when the spies went
[1:58:45] in the second time and they went into
[1:58:47] Jericho and they came in and everybody
[1:58:49] was scared of them
[1:58:51] everybody was scared listen when the
[1:58:53] enemy's scared that's when you know
[1:58:54] you're going to win because an enemy is
[1:58:55] already defeated when they're worried
[1:58:57] about what's coming their way and they
[1:58:58] went in there and they said and Rahab
[1:59:00] told him she says we've all heard we've
[1:59:02] all heard of what God's done for you and
[1:59:04] we know we're next
[1:59:06] and that gave them Faith to step up
[1:59:08] we ought to be able to listen to this
[1:59:10] and look at this and say listen Satan's
[1:59:12] more scared of us
[1:59:14] then we ought to be scared of him
[1:59:17] Prophet God said when the when the
[1:59:19] weakest Christian Falls to their knees
[1:59:22] all of Hell trembles something along
[1:59:24] those lines that's where you stand today
[1:59:27] Church
[1:59:27] when you get on your knees and you get
[1:59:29] in the presence of almighty God and you
[1:59:31] start praying and you start seeking and
[1:59:33] you start following his will Heaven is
[1:59:36] behind you and Hell starts to Quake
[1:59:38] because they know that they're about to
[1:59:39] get
[1:59:42] he's trying to get us ready to walk in
[1:59:44] the next Source we'll talk about what
[1:59:45] he's trying to get us into amen God

[2:07:00] we open the service and
[2:07:01] songs we were singing in the brother
[2:07:03] Mark's prayer
[2:07:05] I said Lord
[2:07:07] I've got the message to go with it
[2:07:10] and brother Gerald gave me the service
[2:07:11] there at the very end but I want to sing
[2:07:13] that song that we sung earlier here we
[2:07:15] are I think 572. I thought that was just
[2:07:18] perfect for the Bob I thought you were
[2:07:19] right on the money right on the mark
[2:07:21] this morning I thank the Lord for that I
[2:07:23] thank the Lord from that like I said
[2:07:24] even brother Mark's prayer was just
[2:07:26] right in line with this idea of of the
[2:07:28] leadership of the Holy Spirit and the
[2:07:30] angel going before us and these things
[2:07:32] and you know we sing that song and we
[2:07:34] think it's about healing of sickness but
