[44:28] [Music]
[44:36] [Applause]
[44:38] amen grace Jesus
[44:49] [Music]
[45:00] amen me and I will be a man
[45:18] [Applause]
[45:19] [Music]
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:25] a man
[45:27] [Music]
[45:30] Oh Lord
[45:33] I will be healed by the grace of God a
[45:39] man
[45:43] a man
[45:45] [Applause]
[45:46] [Music]
[45:48] a man
[45:57] Amen praise the Lord Amen thank God for
[46:02] His grace amen to God be the glory
[46:06] there stands the only really all things
[46:08] are possible as we go to the word and
[46:11] let's be in prayer amen for the grace of
[46:13] God to be with us and but those not with
[46:17] us today we pray grace to them amen that
[46:19] or be with them all things are possible
[46:23] amen but well we want to make sure is
[46:27] that it's the will of God amen again as
[46:31] our prophet brought out and it was
[46:33] really the first time although I've
[46:35] maybe read it never thought about it the
[46:37] prophet of God said you know why do you
[46:39] want to be healed we think because
[46:41] they're sick they want to be healed no
[46:44] you got to have a right motive and a
[46:46] right objective and it's got to be for
[46:49] the glory of God amen because you could
[46:52] have that selfish mortal and say well I
[46:54] just want to be you because I'm sick and
[46:56] he's the healer and many times that's
[46:58] why that's why they were after the
[47:00] Prophet is because why they just wanted
[47:02] a sign they want they want a God to do
[47:04] this they want a God to do that but they
[47:06] weren't going to do anything for God a
[47:08] man just to say they believed in God
[47:10] just maybe to go to church but when it
[47:12] comes to believing what God wanted
[47:14] wanted them to believe there was
[47:16] something else
[47:17] a man so again this way the prophet of
[47:19] God did say and there's a tremendous
[47:21] statement he says you can be healed and
[47:23] go to hell a man why because your motive
[47:27] is not right and your objective was not
[47:28] right a man you're not there for the
[47:31] glory of God you're there for selfish
[47:33] motives and selfies objectives a man my
[47:36] brother in all things we want to give
[47:38] God the glory a man-friend of realizing
[47:41] why because we were born in sin and he
[47:43] and he came and did what he did to save
[47:45] us he came into what he did to take us
[47:47] back to a to Eternity and he didn't have
[47:49] to do it
[47:50] a man the probably God said he could
[47:52] have started all over again he could
[47:54] have wait the whole thing off and and
[47:56] there there are there are ministering
[48:00] brethren over the years they really
[48:02] believe that God to all that he did that
[48:05] because this is in the beginning God
[48:07] created the heaven in the air
[48:08] period so but what happened they said
[48:13] well we believe according to what was
[48:15] written in Jeremiah was written in by
[48:18] another prophet to some where God had
[48:20] created and another creation there and
[48:23] what happened he said they just turned
[48:25] themselves over to the devil and what
[48:27] did God do he said God come down and
[48:29] wiped the whole thing off and he started
[48:31] again and that's why the Genesis 1 and 2
[48:34] in the beginning God created the heavens
[48:37] and the earth
[48:37] hey man and an Indian into one or two
[48:40] where he made eat meat this he made this
[48:42] he made this he brought the light a man
[48:45] he brought the light he said let there
[48:47] be light that he made this he made it
[48:49] then he made Adam and he a man again he
[48:52] started over but this time he had the
[48:56] predestinated plan of redemption a man
[48:58] that man was going to fall but he was
[49:00] going to redeem man but that first
[49:03] creation gave themselves completely over
[49:06] to the devil and brother there's a
[49:08] reference to it in the book of
[49:10] Revelation where the Bible says all of
[49:12] these demons are brought down out of out
[49:14] of the river
[49:14] all these demons come out of the end of
[49:16] the water amen in the end the last days
[49:19] God's going to turn it loose on the on
[49:22] the world amen brother
[49:24] what is it where these demons come from
[49:27] that was the Jim that was that
[49:28] regeneration that was that that first
[49:30] creation that God destroyed a man and
[49:33] then you know the Bible says the earth
[49:35] was covered with water a man God did
[49:39] that so when God came in and he told the
[49:41] water to go back and the water for this
[49:43] water for that those demons were still
[49:45] in the water
[49:46] where did when Jesus cast the demons out
[49:50] of this man where do they want to go hey
[49:54] man thank God for thank God for the
[49:56] revelation see scripture scripture bears
[49:58] witness the scripture scripture balances
[50:00] scripture a man and they wanted to they
[50:03] wanted to go into the water they wanted
[50:05] to go into the ocean they wanted to go
[50:06] into this end into the river a man and
[50:08] they went in that's right okay said go
[50:11] and they left they left the man thank
[50:14] God brother for the scripture
[50:17] a man thank God for God vindicating his
[50:19] word by grace all brother oh there's no
[50:23] as I said there's nothing wrong with
[50:25] this book there's no mistakes here it's
[50:28] now it's not like the brother that wrote
[50:30] me as I said everybody he sent me an
[50:32] email some years ago and he said always
[50:34] said I read this book he said three
[50:36] times and he said of so full of mistakes
[50:38] he said I don't believe it and I said
[50:40] brother brother there's no mistakes I
[50:42] said the book is written in such a way I
[50:45] say this is to get the attention of the
[50:47] believer and give them faith and I said
[50:49] it just cause the the make believer to
[50:51] doubt and I sister turned the unbeliever
[50:53] away I said God wrote it in this way so
[50:56] I said what are you I saw you a make
[50:59] believer and unbeliever or a believer he
[51:02] never answered a man so I say maybe an
[51:06] unbeliever but I tell you this if you're
[51:08] a believer you're gonna believe it in
[51:09] you because you know God don't make no
[51:11] mistakes a man the mistakes are in man
[51:14] man but not God so God God is perfect
[51:18] thank God for the revelation of his word
[51:21] praise the Lord just give him the glory
[51:23] amen brother there's no mistakes as a
[51:27] believer with the mind of God and the
[51:29] revelation of the Holy Ghost we read
[51:32] from Genesis to Revelation amen and we
[51:35] see the plan and the purpose of God amen
[51:38] and God is doing exactly what are your
[51:40] deign to do from the beginning
[51:41] I pray that he's doing what he Ponk want

[1:00:09] amen god bless you turn with me to the
[1:00:12] book of Exodus chapter 31 32 Exodus
[1:00:18] chapter 32 a man I was bring greetings
[1:00:25] from brother Tom snow that I spoke with
[1:00:28] him a couple of nights ago and
[1:00:33] appreciate his fellowship on the phone
[1:00:35] and he mentioned the the brother that he
[1:00:38] was maybe expecting some time next year
[1:00:40] and but he has no assurance of exactly
[1:00:43] when and he's sort of hoping that it
[1:00:47] might be sometime in June of next year
[1:00:49] and it's a brother Andrew Glover but he
[1:00:52] said again we have no assurance or to be
[1:00:54] exact that exact time and so he would
[1:00:57] keep in contact and let us know and
[1:01:00] because he had already mentioned to the
[1:01:02] brother concerning coming to st. John's
[1:01:06] that he would minister in central new
[1:01:08] plan and that he would come to st.
[1:01:12] John's again that's why he wanted to
[1:01:16] meet to him to assure him of that and so
[1:01:19] I said yes brother just keep us in
[1:01:21] contact I said and and let us know
[1:01:24] exactly that when the brother would come
[1:01:26] so we'll see and as he hears from the
[1:01:30] brother because the brother is
[1:01:31] ministering and he is he's got a like I
[1:01:34] say is watch on his on his agenda
[1:01:38] so we pray the grace of God and the will
[1:01:41] of God at the time that God would want
[1:01:42] him to be here a man and also a brother
[1:01:46] Andre head of course that and he would
[1:01:49] prefer not to come here in wintertime
[1:01:51] but he see wilfer prefer to come come
[1:01:54] maybe during the spring or the summer so
[1:01:56] no doubt maybe he might be considering
[1:01:58] driving here and that's why you would
[1:02:00] not want to come wintertime I don't
[1:02:03] think it would mind him when it comes to
[1:02:05] the weather if he were just flying but
[1:02:07] again this a brother was was here one
[1:02:11] time and visiting the me he was saying
[1:02:13] oh my he said I don't think I would be
[1:02:16] able to live here you might consider it
[1:02:18] you see her during the winter and I said
[1:02:20] what brother if you're called of God you
[1:02:22] will live here and I said remember I
[1:02:24] said you you God's got to have somebody
[1:02:26] here to be a witness so I see regardless
[1:02:29] of the weather oh yes he said he never
[1:02:31] thought about that
[1:02:33] I said well I said there are those that
[1:02:35] want this and want that and want that so
[1:02:36] maybe I said it if we went and did what
[1:02:39] we wanted to do maybe we would be well
[1:02:42] we wouldnt want to go to Florida we pray
[1:02:45] for the the grace of God for the saints
[1:02:46] that are in Florida we want we want to
[1:02:48] go to California and we pray for the
[1:02:50] grace of God to those in California but
[1:02:53] we would like go somewhere where there
[1:02:55] is a less snow and more Sun but again if
[1:02:59] it's the will of God for us to be here
[1:03:01] be here amen
[1:03:03] thank God for our sisters here from the
[1:03:05] United States a man that and there's
[1:03:10] some of the feel that like they were
[1:03:11] born raised here they've been after a
[1:03:13] few years they settled right in so God
[1:03:16] God blessed our sisters a man as they
[1:03:19] just yield to the change amen
[1:03:22] by the grace of God so it's the calling
[1:03:24] of God what is the will of God where
[1:03:26] does God want you to be that's that's
[1:03:29] the question
[1:03:30] a man so brother wherever God wants me
[1:03:32] to be that's where I want to be a man
[1:03:35] regardless again the weather got nothing
[1:03:37] to do with it
[1:03:37] there's nothing at all no not by any
[1:03:40] means and whatever the will of God is
[1:03:43] we're there to be a witness for the word
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:47] so God's grace to us and the Lord help
[1:03:51] our brother Andre
[1:03:52] and lead him at the right time to be
[1:03:55] here when the Lord would want him to be
[1:03:58] here I pray the Lord then he'll be here
[1:04:00] but at the same time again if God is
[1:04:04] doesn't want our brother to be here
[1:04:06] during the winter we'll that's fine the
[1:04:08] will of God be done a man so grace to us
[1:04:12] and also oh yeah i I did to share a
[1:04:19] quote with our brother concerning the
[1:04:21] taint that we that we played and he was
[1:04:25] blessed by the by the quote and
[1:04:28] concerning yes amazing concerning that
[1:04:32] the tension that a believer is under as
[1:04:34] a Christian we when you become a
[1:04:37] Christian you come into her into a life
[1:04:39] of tension and man and knowing that on
[1:04:42] Monday we were visiting with my brother
[1:04:46] in paradise there and of course my
[1:04:50] brother from Gander was in as well and
[1:04:52] his wife she had to see a doctor and my
[1:04:57] brother who lives here he turned on the
[1:05:00] television there and he turned on I'm
[1:05:03] not sure I not sure well I think was
[1:05:05] YouTube he said and he and he turned on
[1:05:07] a service a church service and it was a
[1:05:11] Salvation Army church service and it was
[1:05:14] the church service that he was to
[1:05:16] himself on Sunday and his wife and the
[1:05:20] so the Army's well you might be pleased
[1:05:23] with with his sermon it's only thirty
[1:05:26] minutes and so I said well or die says
[1:05:31] they should be thankful that it's not me
[1:05:33] that's preaching and as I got some notes
[1:05:37] here from brother brother Matthew and he
[1:05:40] was saying I think he took an hour so
[1:05:42] yeah he said well I said with you he
[1:05:44] said to be several months he said using
[1:05:48] those notes and it would be a man but
[1:05:50] this brother
[1:05:51] this army officer and I don't recall his
[1:05:54] name now but it was good I appreciate it
[1:05:59] he was leading the people in worship and
[1:06:01] praising the Lord then he went into the
[1:06:03] word
[1:06:04] and a nicer well I said he was preaching
[1:06:07] basically what I was preaching on and I
[1:06:10] said on Sunday we were we were preaching
[1:06:13] on basically the same thing and he was
[1:06:15] talking about the scripture be thankful
[1:06:17] and he said you don't be thankful the
[1:06:20] but ask the Christian life is a thankful
[1:06:21] life and it but he said it doesn't mean
[1:06:24] that I said he said everything is
[1:06:25] according to the way you want it and he
[1:06:28] says sometimes you said God puts us
[1:06:29] under the pressure under the stress
[1:06:31] under the strain he said buddy said be
[1:06:34] thankful don't just saying God he said
[1:06:36] for a win-win when God does this and God
[1:06:39] does that oh yeah you like this and you
[1:06:40] like that no no he said even even when
[1:06:43] you're going through the hard time we're
[1:06:44] going drawing going through the trials
[1:06:45] and the testings he should be thankful a
[1:06:48] man and he was bringing out all these
[1:06:50] things and and I said O Lord I said
[1:06:53] that's good I said I said bless him
[1:06:55] a man and so it was a blessing to us
[1:06:59] could we listen to his entire sermon and
[1:07:01] and the service so I pray God continued
[1:07:04] Lester brother see like keep your
[1:07:06] attitude right toward those out there
[1:07:08] because remember the many of them are
[1:07:11] going to be saved many they were going
[1:07:13] to be there outside the city not
[1:07:15] necessarily in the city they're now
[1:07:16] bright but they are believers a man and
[1:07:20] brother god bless them is my prayer
[1:07:22] there they're going to stay faithful to
[1:07:24] what what he what he is ministered by
[1:07:26] the grace of God amen so again God is
[1:07:31] not only very speaking it to us he God
[1:07:34] is revealing to us one way but he's
[1:07:36] speaking it to the others another way so
[1:07:38] God blessed them and also just to ask
[1:07:44] you to keep brother John in prayer
[1:07:47] he's as these decisions to make and of
[1:07:50] course he'd be going to Ontario I
[1:07:53] believe to start some studying there or
[1:07:58] some something in in in a university
[1:08:01] there so we prayed God help our brother
[1:08:04] and meet our brothers needs by grace a
[1:08:08] man so keep him in prayer and I
[1:08:10] understand that if he goes he'd be going
[1:08:12] of course he'd be starting in January
[1:08:14] and he'd be there until August so grace
[1:08:18] man gonna miss our brothers fellowship
[1:08:19] for sure and brother Matthew will miss
[1:08:22] him them there same thing so God has
[1:08:26] blessed us with his presence for sure a
[1:08:28] man and also to keep our brother vital
[1:08:31] in prayer enjoy his fellowship at
[1:08:33] brother Matthew's a man and Sundy so we
[1:08:36] thanked I thank the Lord for that and
[1:08:39] two for the Rebbe for the fellowship we
[1:08:43] had around the Word of God and what God
[1:08:45] has done for him and what God's doing
[1:08:47] for a man it was good thank the Lord may
[1:08:50] have to get him to give another
[1:08:52] testimony a man part - hey man
[1:08:55] so also - I was going to ask her brother
[1:08:59] market he would minister for us on
[1:09:01] Wednesday a man so I just let him know
[1:09:03] so he's got time to get ready a man
[1:09:07] and also these items right here now I
[1:09:13] received I think we received these last
[1:09:15] year from the voice of God from brother
[1:09:18] Joseph so just to let you know that
[1:09:20] there are some extra extra ones we have
[1:09:23] here I was plenty of maybe sending them
[1:09:25] overseas but I brought them back here
[1:09:28] just and if you would like to add them
[1:09:29] you can take them or share them with
[1:09:32] somebody else and it is what it is of
[1:09:36] course it's the key and and it says take
[1:09:40] this key the key of the name of Jesus
[1:09:45] and open every gate that as you bound a
[1:09:50] man in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:53] so you can have another copy of it and
[1:09:59] also the letter that comes with it
[1:10:01] explaining about the key amen praise the
[1:10:04] Lord in Exodus chapter 32 verse
[1:10:12] one and when the people saw that Moses
[1:10:15] delayed to come down out of the Mount
[1:10:17] the people gathered themselves together
[1:10:21] under Aaron and said unto them said unto
[1:10:26] Him up make us gods which shall go
[1:10:32] before us for as for this Moses the man
[1:10:36] that brought us up out of the land of
[1:10:39] Egypt we know not what has become of him
[1:10:43] and Aaron said unto them break off the
[1:10:49] golden earrings which are in the ears of
[1:10:51] your wives of your sons and of your
[1:10:55] daughters and bring them unto me and all
[1:11:00] the people break off the golden earrings
[1:11:02] which were in their ears and brought
[1:11:05] them unto Aaron and he received them and
[1:11:09] their hand and fashioned it with a
[1:11:13] graving tool after he had made it a
[1:11:17] molten calf this is amazing amazing we
[1:11:24] think well this won't happen and that
[1:11:26] won't happen around the message well if
[1:11:28] this happened here around Moses message
[1:11:30] what will happen around the province
[1:11:32] message a man sure brother and
[1:11:35] especially in this our Father where
[1:11:37] we're in the we're in Jesus said it was
[1:11:39] so bad and it said in the world is going
[1:11:42] to be so insane he said he didn't
[1:11:44] shorten time there being no flesh saved
[1:11:46] a man so consider what they did here
[1:11:49] coming out of Egypt and just think what
[1:11:52] they experienced a man the the ministry
[1:11:55] they experienced a message that through
[1:11:57] Moses and they were they were hearing
[1:11:59] and seen in Egypt my oh my oh my the
[1:12:03] spoken word of God coming down in Egypt
[1:12:05] and doing this and doing this and doing
[1:12:06] this amazing and yet when they come out
[1:12:09] because the Prophet was gone into the
[1:12:12] wilderness and into the mountain longer
[1:12:13] than they thought he should a man here
[1:12:16] is Aaron going out to make a gun an
[1:12:18] image for them to worship a man and it
[1:12:21] wasn't it was it didn't make the image
[1:12:23] of Moses they
[1:12:26] so brother I pray the grace of God
[1:12:28] brother in this hour and they say when
[1:12:30] the Prophet has been gone for over fifty
[1:12:32] years
[1:12:32] Moses was in the end in the mountain for
[1:12:34] over forty days a man so brother Bentham
[1:12:39] has gone for over 50 years so brother
[1:12:41] and we're still here amen
[1:12:43] but now tuna there's a lot of becoming
[1:12:45] it just all my they're just a form of
[1:12:48] godliness in their faith a form of
[1:12:49] godliness in what they believe they're
[1:12:52] not believing exactly the way the
[1:12:54] problem of God would want us to believe
[1:12:55] it in this hour not even the seal or the
[1:12:58] enthusiasm that they had when the father
[1:13:01] of God was here amen
[1:13:02] they don't have the seal in the
[1:13:04] enthusiasm that we had 50 years ago they
[1:13:07] don't have the zeal and enthusiasm that
[1:13:09] they had even 40 years ago a man they
[1:13:12] know they and they never had that zeal
[1:13:14] and enthusiasm amen 40 days after Moses
[1:13:17] was in the mountain a man so they wanted
[1:13:20] my they wanted a errand to do they do
[1:13:22] something else stir them up Oh God have
[1:13:24] mercy on us brother in this late hour
[1:13:27] brother they all God that he'll shorten
[1:13:30] time so that you're you're going to be
[1:13:32] saved here shorten time so that we're
[1:13:34] going to be saved
[1:13:35] shorten time so that we'll go in a
[1:13:37] resurrection and in the rapture by the
[1:13:39] grace of God amen because that's the
[1:13:41] insane world we're living in a man and
[1:13:45] Aaron said unto them again verse 2 break
[1:13:48] off the golden earrings which are in the
[1:13:50] ears of your wives of your sons and of
[1:13:52] your daughters and bring them unto me
[1:13:54] and all the people break off the golden
[1:13:57] earrings which were in their ears and
[1:13:59] brought them under Aaron and he received
[1:14:02] them at their hand and fashioned it with
[1:14:05] a graving tool and after he had made it
[1:14:08] a molten calf and they said these be thy
[1:14:12] God's o Israel which brought thee up out
[1:14:17] of the land of Egypt brother it was
[1:14:20] Jehovah not the golden calf and when
[1:14:24] Aaron saw it he built an altar before it
[1:14:27] and Aaron made Proclamation and said
[1:14:30] tomorrow is a feast to the Lord and they
[1:14:33] rose up early on the morrow and offered
[1:14:36] burnt offerings and they brought peace
[1:14:38] off
[1:14:38] and the people sat down to eat and to
[1:14:41] drink and rose up to play a million
[1:14:45] brother the hour was serious they came
[1:14:48] out but let's go in a man that was the
[1:14:52] problem they had there they never had
[1:14:54] the zeal the enthusiasm to go in they
[1:14:57] wanted to come out but whatever going in

[1:15:59] to go in by the grace of God Amen so
[1:16:04] brethren and it says they rose early on
[1:16:07] the morrow and offered burnt offerings
[1:16:09] and brought peace offerings and the
[1:16:12] people sat down to eat and drink and
[1:16:14] rose up to play and the Lord said unto
[1:16:18] Moses get the go he said get thee down
[1:16:21] for thy people which have brought us out
[1:16:24] of the land of Egypt and corrupted
[1:16:26] themselves amazing and they have turned
[1:16:30] aside quickly out of the way which I
[1:16:34] commanded them that they have made them
[1:16:36] a molten calf and a worship yeah worship
[1:16:41] the calf and have sacrificed their on -
[1:16:45] and said these be thy God's o Israel
[1:16:48] which have brought thee up out of the
[1:16:50] land of
[1:16:51] and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen
[1:16:55] this people and behold it is a
[1:16:58] stiff-necked people they were stubborn
[1:17:02] now therefore let me alone that my wrath
[1:17:05] may wax art against them that I may
[1:17:08] consume them and I will make of thee a
[1:17:11] great nation and Moses besought the Lord
[1:17:15] his God and said Lord why death I wrath
[1:17:19] wax art against thy people which thou
[1:17:22] has brought forth out of the land of
[1:17:24] Egypt with great power and with a mighty
[1:17:27] hand wherefore should the Egyptians
[1:17:29] speak and say for mischief did he bring
[1:17:34] them out to slay them in the mountains
[1:17:37] and to consume them from the face of the
[1:17:40] earth turn from thy fierce wrath Moses
[1:17:45] was interceding a man on behalf of
[1:17:48] Israel and he said I repent of this evil
[1:17:51] against thy people remember Abraham
[1:17:54] Isaac and Israel they servants to whom
[1:17:59] thou swearest by thine own self and sets
[1:18:02] unto them I will multiply your seat as
[1:18:05] the stars of heaven and all this land
[1:18:07] that I have spoken of will I give unto
[1:18:10] your seat and they shall inherit it for
[1:18:13] ever and the Lord repented of the evil
[1:18:16] which he thought to do unto his people
[1:18:20] it was the Spirit of Christ in Moses
[1:18:23] Amen it are sitting for Israel their
[1:18:26] spirit of Christ interceding for you and
[1:18:29] me God bless his words you may be seated
[1:18:32] turn with me to Leviticus chapter 10
[1:18:40] Leviticus
[1:18:42] 2:10 and the inning read at verse 1 and
[1:18:53] net ebb and a bayou the sons of Aaron
[1:19:00] took either of them his censer and put
[1:19:03] fire therein and put incense thereon and
[1:19:08] offered strange fire before the Lord a
[1:19:12] mayor it was not according to the Word
[1:19:15] of God they offered strange fire before
[1:19:19] the Lord and there's many a believer
[1:19:21] this offering strange fire before the
[1:19:24] Lord
[1:19:24] strange worship based on a strange
[1:19:27] revelation a man is not exactly
[1:19:30] according to what God has revealed is
[1:19:32] not exactly according to what God has
[1:19:34] done in this day an hour is not what God
[1:19:37] is looking for a man brother God
[1:19:39] revealed in his word and through Moses
[1:19:42] and through and yes Aaron - we exactly
[1:19:45] what he was doing and what he wanted in
[1:19:47] the people a man God has revealed
[1:19:49] through the Prophet in this hour exactly
[1:19:51] what even what he did and what he what
[1:19:54] he's doing and what he wants to see in
[1:19:56] you and me a man sir brother sister are
[1:19:59] we reflecting the message of the hour
[1:20:02] are reflecting what God wants us to
[1:20:05] reflect a man what is God looking for in
[1:20:08] your life whether it's God looking for
[1:20:09] in my life a man when it comes to the
[1:20:12] spiritual revelation a man I'm not
[1:20:15] talking about the natural or the
[1:20:17] physical things but the spiritual things
[1:20:19] a reflection of the revelation of the
[1:20:22] message Sarah how am i reflecting it how
[1:20:25] am i responding to it brother an and
[1:20:28] when it comes to the believers out there
[1:20:29] as I say their lives are not reflecting
[1:20:31] what what was they used to do for
[1:20:33] reflect back back 40 years ago or back
[1:20:36] 50 years ago a man brothers sister and
[1:20:39] not only their the father was
[1:20:41] recognizing it back even before the Lord
[1:20:43] called him off the scene and we might as
[1:20:46] we get into these messages right here we
[1:20:48] might maybe touch on that quote where
[1:20:51] the power of God is acknowledging that
[1:20:54] the people are
[1:20:55] not experiencing exactly what God has
[1:20:58] done a man there there that it's not it
[1:21:01] is not is not coming out of them the way
[1:21:03] they're graded that he felt that it
[1:21:05] should come out of them they're not
[1:21:06] responding to it the way that he felt
[1:21:08] they should respond to the revelation of
[1:21:10] what God was doing a man it would turn
[1:21:13] through brother branham it was a
[1:21:14] tremendous thing brother concerning the
[1:21:18] the owe me of the word concerning the
[1:21:20] revelation of the seven seals it was
[1:21:22] absolutely amazing a man but again he
[1:21:25] felt that the people were not responding
[1:21:27] to the word the way they they had the
[1:21:29] bride would respond amen brother and
[1:21:33] when he left to see if how he felt
[1:21:35] everything was getting cool a man and a
[1:21:38] form of godliness and it was it was her
[1:21:41] brother's sister I trust by the grace of
[1:21:43] God that we're not going to stay under
[1:21:45] the influence of the religious spirit
[1:21:47] and just have a form of godliness a man
[1:21:50] I trust by the grace of God the word is
[1:21:53] going to strike us the way that God
[1:21:54] wants in this drinketh hey they made the
[1:21:56] word that the word were striking Israel
[1:21:58] the way that God wanted to strike the
[1:22:00] Jews when they were in Egypt amen
[1:22:02] they they really wanted to come out they
[1:22:05] really wanted to do this so God came
[1:22:07] down in the end Moses and God did this
[1:22:09] and God did that brother you talked
[1:22:11] about the signs and the wonders they saw
[1:22:13] a man in the Ministry of Moses in Egypt
[1:22:16] and what God came in God did this we God
[1:22:19] did that you tell me the miracles a man
[1:22:21] and God God was showing that he was gone
[1:22:24] a man it wasn't the God said that the
[1:22:26] Egyptians were worse for me amen it was
[1:22:29] it was it was Jehovah
[1:22:31] hey man and brother and you think about
[1:22:33] it you could consider the things that he
[1:22:35] did in Egypt and he do this and he did
[1:22:38] that and showing brother that man
[1:22:40] couldn't do it ain't married holy God
[1:22:43] could do it a man only hello him could
[1:22:46] do it only Jehovah could do it the
[1:22:48] self-existing one by the grace of
[1:22:50] Almighty God ain't man but again maybe
[1:22:53] they thought back here the same thing
[1:22:55] that some were thinking here in this day
[1:22:57] an hour and I was and I was surprised
[1:23:00] when her brother mentioned to me just
[1:23:02] two or three months ago and he and he
[1:23:04] said all he said I was talking to a
[1:23:08] certain sister
[1:23:09] and she was telling me about whether
[1:23:11] Branham there brother Branham was there
[1:23:12] was a magician and I brother Baron the
[1:23:16] OED just he just in magical things and I
[1:23:20] say what oh yeah he said that's what she
[1:23:23] thought about brother Branham that he
[1:23:25] wasn't a prophet he was a magician and I
[1:23:27] and I wish I was surprised when I was
[1:23:30] going through the messages a couple of
[1:23:31] nights ago and I came across this one
[1:23:34] right here and I said oh my
[1:23:36] I said Lord I said maybe this is where I
[1:23:39] don't know if she got in here she would
[1:23:41] I don't say yes she would have these
[1:23:42] books and it was a message in 19 and 64
[1:23:45] paradox and and this is what he said and
[1:23:49] he said a certain Baptist Church he said
[1:23:52] that my little family went to the other
[1:23:55] day and they have been down at the
[1:23:57] median Tucson and he said the pastor got
[1:24:00] up and he said not knowing that the boy
[1:24:04] that goes with my daughter might be
[1:24:06] brothers George Smith he said as a
[1:24:10] member there and he said the pastor said
[1:24:15] you know I just learned brother
[1:24:18] branham's father and mother traveled in
[1:24:21] a circus and he said oh they were
[1:24:29] magicians a man just sing over 50 years
[1:24:34] later they're still believing it over 50
[1:24:37] years later they're still saying that's
[1:24:39] what that said that's the anointing that
[1:24:40] was on William Branham that's here
[1:24:42] that's the only that caused him to do
[1:24:44] this and cause him to do that he was
[1:24:46] just a magician amen and he said he said
[1:24:51] they were magicians and he said that's a
[1:24:54] little trick that William Brown does
[1:24:56] yeah
[1:24:58] and he said I guess it was a trick that
[1:25:02] heals the sick and he said I doubt he
[1:25:08] said whether my father and mother ever
[1:25:10] seen a circus he said they weren't in a
[1:25:14] circus they had seen a circus and he
[1:25:19] said they'd never seen an automobile til
[1:25:21] I had one
[1:25:22] a man so we're in the world to get that
[1:25:26] revelation that they were in a circus
[1:25:28] and they were magicians
[1:25:29] and that what brother Brown did was just
[1:25:32] a magic but they don't make sense
[1:25:35] and he said they said they'd never
[1:25:38] brother Allen said his parents he says
[1:25:41] they never know nothing about it and he
[1:25:43] said you see the devil has always got to
[1:25:46] say and he said they told Jesus this do
[1:25:51] or they do this by Beelzebub yeah they
[1:25:55] said Jesus was influenced by the devil
[1:25:57] to do what he was doing and basically
[1:25:59] were saying that William Branham was
[1:26:00] influenced by the devil doing what he
[1:26:03] was doing what he loved the sink brother
[1:26:05] you don't you dare to be anointed by the
[1:26:07] devil to say something like that you'd
[1:26:09] have to be anointed by the devil to
[1:26:10] believe something like that a man why
[1:26:13] for someone to come and do good for
[1:26:15] someone to come and heal the sick not
[1:26:17] only of the sick but the Rays of the day
[1:26:19] a man because even the Dead was raised
[1:26:22] up whether there's anything in the
[1:26:24] Ministry of Jesus whether in the
[1:26:25] Ministry of William Branham and only
[1:26:27] that be even even our brother Wesley
[1:26:31] John Wesley Oh mine the old my shirt I
[1:26:36] believe it something to died even in
[1:26:38] this day and he went and prayed and the
[1:26:41] dead raised up hey man and another time

[1:26:46] he broke his leg and he got off the
[1:26:49] horse and got down and put his hand on

[1:26:52] man and the horse was ready to go again

[1:27:19] faith in that they got faith in natural
[1:27:21] thing more faith than they got in the
[1:27:23] spiritual that is the absolute truth

[1:27:28] faith for healing how are we going to
[1:27:30] add the faith whether for the rapture

[1:54:16] hey Mary yes as like I said I preached
[1:54:19] that years ago over fifty years ago I
[1:54:21] pressed it as a young man right because
[1:54:24] I saw believers believers believers
[1:54:26] professing believers with wrong spirits
[1:54:28] and wrong attitudes and they were
[1:54:30] looking down their noses and those up
[1:54:32] there in denominations oh yeah they were
[1:54:34] oh they thought that they were up here
[1:54:36] and they were righteous and they were
[1:54:37] good oh yeah
[1:54:39] because they believed the message and
[1:54:41] the Prophet you know and so on no they
[1:54:43] didn't now and they were looking they
[1:54:46] don't know oh they go that church ah
[1:54:49] they go to that church I said well
[1:54:53] that's you what for the grace of God
[1:54:56] yeah
[1:54:57] I said don't you do that and as I said
[1:55:01] and you know the I guess I mentioned so
[1:55:04] often did you know the scripture that I
[1:55:07] used back there over fifty years ago
[1:55:12] Matthew you don't have to turn to it
[1:55:18] you have heard that
[1:55:20] sandé thou shalt love thy neighbour and
[1:55:23] hate thine enemy but I say unto you love
[1:55:27] your enemies amazing praise the Lord
[1:55:31] love your enemies bless them that curse
[1:55:35] you do good to them that hate you yeah
[1:55:39] don't look down your noses thank God for
[1:55:43] the grace in your life and he said pray
[1:55:47] for them which despitefully use you and
[1:55:49] persecute you know believers came out
[1:55:52] and persecuted them mother believe your
[1:55:56] little children now that's the truth to
[1:55:58] that now that's true back there years
[1:56:01] ago and even today they're believers
[1:56:03] persecuting those out their persecutors
[1:56:04] you know you don't do that jesus never
[1:56:08] persecuted them not only that when they
[1:56:11] questioned Jesus Jesus never opened his
[1:56:13] mouth didn't say anything and that they
[1:56:18] would they marvel at that you're not
[1:56:20] saying nothing oh very why don't he
[1:56:26] condemned the Pharisees why don't he
[1:56:28] contend the scribes look they're out
[1:56:31] there and they all want to crucify him
[1:56:32] crucify him crucify him and he never
[1:56:35] opens mouth and yet believers are hoping
[1:56:41] their mouth to condemn to criticize
[1:56:46] don't you do that that's their go show
[1:56:49] but for the grace of God and the proud
[1:56:53] like the prophet of God said he said I
[1:56:55] can condemn what what they do but not
[1:56:57] damned
[1:56:58] I can't contain them no no you keep it
[1:57:00] right attitude toward them a bright
[1:57:03] spirit toward them personally but you
[1:57:06] you just take your stand for the word
[1:57:07] and he and you got to make sure your
[1:57:11] spirit is right you add to his right if
[1:57:12] you and you got to do it right when it
