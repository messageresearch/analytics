[17:12] amen 369 well this he brought me out the
[17:17] Myrick fight
[17:18] amen before we sing you just wanted to
[17:20] mention but a journal has been to
[17:21] mention as well he's been putting new
[17:24] Bibles a few new Bibles out there in the
[17:26] back it's done it several times but they
[17:29] seem to be disappearing mister word is
[17:34] disappearing
[17:36] however he mentioned I gave you if you
[17:39] borrow it you know it's for those that
[17:40] maybe don't have a Bible or maybe a
[17:42] visitor or something because he needs a
[17:44] Bible so if by mistake you take it home
[17:48] would you maybe return them Stuart there
[17:51] is a cost involved with that or you'll
[17:53] get a bill in the mail I guess that's
[17:54] possible too
[17:56] so if he just asked me to mention that
[17:58] just just seems to be several of them
[18:01] disappear he was wondering where they're
[18:02] going so anyway we're not we're not
[18:05] pointing fingers that's not what this is
[18:07] about so if you do have one just slip it
[18:11] back nobody will say anything
[18:12] I don't think god bless you let's sing

[45:28] turnover by the Gerald as he as he comes
[45:31] in here he was brother George to be in
[45:33] prayer for him as he comes with the word
[45:37] of the Lord tonight amen so let's sing
[45:39] it into thy chamber and I come Holy

[47:11] [Music]
[47:31] [Music]
[47:52] [Applause]
[48:05] a man praise the Lord
[48:11] thank Jesus for his presence with us
[48:13] tonight a man I believe that Jesus is
[48:17] here I trust that you believe he's here
[48:20] I trust you have the assurance that when
[48:23] you came he came a man that he was with
[48:26] you and that he is in you and that you
[48:29] are the word Christ made flesh a man
[48:33] it is Jesus walking in you it is Jesus
[48:37] talking in you
[48:39] it is Jesus bringing his word to pass in
[48:42] you by the grace of God and let's
[48:45] believe tonight that it is Jesus that
[48:47] will bring his word to pass in our
[48:49] brother George Smith and we want to
[48:52] thank our brother for traveling as far
[48:54] as he has and coming even beyond as I
[48:58] would say beyond Canada in the
[49:01] Newfoundland a man to bring the word and
[49:04] then to be able to go out to central new
[49:06] Flannan and minister to the Saints there
[49:09] and as we traveled of course to where to
[49:12] Deer Lake and and Cormack to see the
[49:15] Saints he was ministering in the Samuel
[49:20] brother guys assembly in st. John or in
[49:24] Grand Falls but little from what I heard
[49:28] god bless the people through the word
[49:31] amen and then the comments that I heard
[49:35] it was excellent they were faith feeding
[49:38] on what our brother George had to say
[49:40] and when myself and sister Betty said in
[49:43] the service of Friday night we were
[49:45] feeding on the word amen and I believe
[49:48] it is what it should be and in the
[49:51] ministry it should be God hidden and
[49:54] revealing simplicity a man as it was in
[49:58] the prophets so it is in the fifl
[50:00] ministry the word coming forth is God
[50:03] hidden and revealing himself in
[50:05] simplicity and those that will humble
[50:07] themselves are going to get the
[50:09] revelation of God in simplicity
[50:12] a man let's not make it as the father
[50:14] warned us in the seals
[50:16] he said don't make it any smaller than
[50:18] what it is and don't make it any bigger
[50:20] than what it is and he said don't try to
[50:23] figure it out and he said if you think
[50:25] you've got to figure it out he says you
[50:27] can be sure of one thing he says you're
[50:28] wrong
[50:29] a man is God in simplicity and work and
[50:32] we're going word by word by word we're
[50:35] going step by step by step trusting the
[50:38] Lord a man that's it and then it's God
[50:41] in the ministry and he did bring that
[50:44] quote out I believe either in the
[50:46] service or somewhere else
[50:48] where the prophet of God has someday
[50:50] asked the Prophet does the bride having
[50:52] ministry before the coming of the Lord
[50:54] and he should sure and has been going on
[50:56] he says since the day of Pentecost and
[50:58] is going on now and he said it's the
[51:00] fifl ministry it is the Holy Ghost in
[51:03] the Bible ministry
[51:05] Amen is a ministry that now recognizes
[51:08] the revealed Word in the prophetic
[51:11] ministry of Malachi for a man and that
[51:14] bride is going to stay with that word
[51:16] that bride is going to get the faith
[51:18] that God that pleases God in their word
[51:21] amen
[51:22] so I want you to be in prayer for our
[51:24] brother George Smith as he comes god
[51:26] bless him amen for taking the time to
[51:30] come to minister to those in central
[51:33] Newfoundland
[51:33] god bless they were taking the time to
[51:35] come back and to minister to us here in
[51:37] st. John's hey man we was here in 1984 I
[51:42] believe it was that was the first time
[51:45] he was there now he's there again and we
[51:47] trust by the grace of God he'll be
[51:49] hurricane of the Lord tarries a man so
[51:52] let's pay attention to the word I want
[51:54] you to pull on the word amen
[51:57] and and let God speak to you amen
[52:01] there's good answer there's going to be
[52:02] something there for you that's right

[56:05] James
[56:08] I believe
[56:14] [Music]
[56:59] Oh
[57:14] let's pray precious Heavenly Father we
[57:17] thank you for this opportunity to be
[57:19] here with this section this proportion
[57:22] of the Bride of Christ in st. John
[57:24] Newfoundland
[57:25] well you knew before the foundation of
[57:27] the world that we'd be here because with
[57:29] you there's no surprises there's no news
[57:32] for you and so you knew who all would be
[57:35] here will we be wearing what our
[57:37] attitude would be father we just pray
[57:39] that you'd bless your word now to your
[57:41] people let each one have their portion
[57:44] Lord there's something here for everyone
[57:46] and you've given it to me I want to give
[57:49] it out now help us we ask in Jesus name
[57:54] while you're standing turn to the second
[57:56] page of your Bible Genesis 1:27 now
[58:04] you'd be surprised that people start
[58:05] flipping looking for that Genesis 1:27
[58:11] the Word of God says so God created man
[58:14] in his own image in the image of God
[58:16] created he him he may be seated he's
[58:24] privileged to be here and to see the
[58:26] growth and different faces that there
[58:30] were 30 years ago
[58:31] I barely remember being here myself but
[58:34] stayed in touch with brother Israel
[58:37] during these years and somehow we're
[58:39] still friends because we're going to the
[58:42] same heaven oh there's no it's not
[58:45] sectioned off like it is overhead
[58:47] cemetery heaven is one there's one
[58:50] heaven if you're going or you're not
[58:53] going
[58:55] so tonight we want to look at a subject
[58:58] what am i reflecting you are reflecting
[59:01] something all the time now Adam and Eve
[59:08] were there in the garden Adam was made
[59:13] in the image of God we just read that so
[59:16] we don't have to worry about what he
[59:17] looked like or how he was in the image
[59:19] of God sometime later in chapter 2 we
[59:22] have the fact that Eve was taken from
[59:24] Adams side now some of you are a lot
[59:30] smarter than I am so I'm not going to
[59:31] try to pretend like I know a lot of
[59:32] things but you know I do understand that
[59:35] the foot has 26 bones in it so now Adam
[59:38] could have missed one of those bones but
[59:42] you just crack one of those small bones
[59:44] one day find out that you can't walk so
[59:48] God could have taken a bone out of the
[59:50] foot to make Eve then he got a kicked
[59:52] her around like he kicked the cat you
[59:54] know he could have trampled her and
[1:00:00] despised her and he didn't take a piece
[1:00:03] from the head because then there'd be a
[1:00:05] matter of always overpowering you know
[1:00:08] you didn't take it from the hand slap
[1:00:11] her around that's our that's a princess
[1:00:14] you know that's that's too when the
[1:00:16] cooks not happy you got a lot of
[1:00:17] problems you got to keep the cook happy
[1:00:20] but he took from the rib which is
[1:00:24] closest to the heart so that Adam would
[1:00:27] love her and cherish her until death and
[1:00:32] beyond hey let's see the merge ceremony
[1:00:35] says till death do us part
[1:00:37] some people just can't wait till she
[1:00:40] dies move on to something better that's
[1:00:45] not the way it works
[1:00:49] now I've been in a few countries and I
[1:00:53] was in the Congo and over there they
[1:00:56] take Church very serious yeah when we
[1:00:59] when we finished Sunday School where
[1:01:01] they finished study school there was
[1:01:04] 4700 people present and only 250 Bibles
[1:01:09] so of course the American missionary
[1:01:11] gotta help these poor people the brother
[1:01:13] said look we got plenty of money we're
[1:01:15] building this church and they don't know
[1:01:16] what drywall is they know only
[1:01:18] reinforced concrete so they got plenty
[1:01:20] of money and they said they'd sell
[1:01:22] Bibles right over there the problem is
[1:01:25] these people can't read there's only 20
[1:01:27] percent literacy at there in that place
[1:01:29] so they're doing fine
[1:01:32] and by the time church is over there's
[1:01:34] like 6,000 people there then you look
[1:01:36] outside and there's maybe five cars and
[1:01:39] maybe 400 motorcycles small motorcycles
[1:01:43] and 500 bicycles and everybody else
[1:01:46] walked but after the service the pastor
[1:01:48] jumps up and he says now we don't know
[1:01:51] when brother George is coming back so
[1:01:54] does anybody have any questions
[1:01:58] what were you bugs drove I needed six
[1:02:02] thousand people so the questions are in
[1:02:04] France and Lingala and then they come to
[1:02:06] me and then I give the answer so that
[1:02:07] took a while so the only question I
[1:02:09] remember was that one sister had passed
[1:02:11] up a question
[1:02:12] well since the Lord took your wife why
[1:02:14] are you still wearing the ring well I
[1:02:16] couldn't say scare away the women could
[1:02:19] I
[1:02:19] no but I said because my commitment to
[1:02:22] Rebecca was not just til death do us
[1:02:23] part but to Eternity you see and so
[1:02:27] that's the way that love should be amen
[1:02:32] there's a three ladies - okay so they
[1:02:38] were in the image of God and being an
[1:02:42] image of God they reflected the glory of
[1:02:43] God for a while now we don't know how
[1:02:46] long it might have been a long time they
[1:02:49] didn't have watches back then but it was
[1:02:51] every day every night a hundred percent
[1:02:52] and they reflected perfectly but they
[1:02:57] also reflected God in balance
[1:03:00] if you don't remember anything else
[1:03:02] remember that you can't build this
[1:03:04] church without one of these and God
[1:03:07] can't build character in you without you
[1:03:09] doing your best to stay in balance so
[1:03:12] just keep that in mind
[1:03:14] so everything was peaceful everything
[1:03:17] was in perfect harmony there was no sin
[1:03:20] there's no temptations it was nice
[1:03:23] no I think they eat whatever they wanted
[1:03:25] to eat they they camped out every night
[1:03:29] and how many people really like to camp
[1:03:31] out let's see your hand
[1:03:32] yeah let's melt like me I like hotel
[1:03:36] right there's clean sheets and hot water
[1:03:38] but these people had a perfect
[1:03:41] environment and they camped out every
[1:03:44] night they slept in a different place
[1:03:45] every night the animals were all there
[1:03:47] and so we can imagine that one day evoke
[1:03:52] up and and she said not Adam I love you
[1:03:54] but you know that that tree I can't see
[1:03:57] the mountain too well do you think he
[1:03:59] put up a fuss like we did like we would
[1:04:02] know he said well yes dear why wouldn't
[1:04:04] I think of that and he moved the tree
[1:04:05] you see now we would have to get a lot
[1:04:08] of expanse and help and machinery but
[1:04:11] men the sooner we learn to say yes dear
[1:04:14] the smoother your life is going to be
[1:04:17] now I didn't always do it but it does
[1:04:19] work okay
[1:04:23] that was free so they didn't have any
[1:04:27] temptations and so they they were in up
[1:04:30] a perfect environment but one day the
[1:04:33] most cunning and subtle of all the
[1:04:36] beasts of the field
[1:04:37] everything God had created he came along
[1:04:39] and began to speak to Eve they were
[1:04:42] communicating somehow now I wasn't there
[1:04:44] and neither would you
[1:04:45] but our prophet give us enough
[1:04:47] information to know that they
[1:04:48] communicated for a while wasn't just one
[1:04:51] encounter they've come around and so
[1:04:53] they became friends and one day after
[1:04:56] the confidence was very well-established
[1:04:59] he lied to her because she God had told
[1:05:02] him if you do these things here you're
[1:05:04] going to die and Satan says you're not
[1:05:08] gonna die surely not you know and he
[1:05:11] just changed one word and so Eve
[1:05:14] could have said really did she started
[1:05:17] listening and she started having more
[1:05:19] dialogue and well he may have a better
[1:05:21] idea it sounds good to me you know and
[1:05:23] where was Adam well he was over with the
[1:05:25] animal someplace so this is how things
[1:05:27] started and that's why we have sin in
[1:05:30] the world until today okay that's where
[1:05:33] it started and we still have it today
[1:05:34] because he had a better explanation she
[1:05:37] came out she was fortified behind the
[1:05:39] Word of God very simple it was only a
[1:05:43] few words in in English I think it's
[1:05:47] thirty nine words that she had for her
[1:05:49] little fortification and she came out
[1:05:51] from behind the fortification and double
[1:05:55] got her you see because she was
[1:05:57] listening to her new friend and from
[1:06:00] that moment till tonight we have these
[1:06:01] problems now they didn't have Ten
[1:06:03] Commandments they didn't have a Bible
[1:06:06] they couldn't read anyway
[1:06:08] you know they just had these thirty-nine
[1:06:10] words do this everything worked fine but
[1:06:13] they failed because of reasoning well I
[1:06:15] think and I believe in my thinking in my
[1:06:20] opinion we don't care we want to know
[1:06:23] what God says because this will not pass
[1:06:26] away
[1:06:26] see this is God in printed form now all
[1:06:29] the Bibles are going to burn one day but
[1:06:31] the Word of God will be here forever
[1:06:33] and we are part of that word now elijah
[1:06:36] says in the harvest time message God is
[1:06:38] a great sculptor he made man in His
[1:06:40] image to reflect him that's what we're
[1:06:42] here for
[1:06:43] and he is the word and what did he do he
[1:06:45] tried and Adam he failed
[1:06:47] Moses failed all the rest of them failed
[1:06:49] but there's one perfect one hallelujah
[1:06:52] what is it nothing less than God himself
[1:06:54] in flesh the word reflected in him
[1:06:56] brought the fullness of the Godhead
[1:06:57] bodily not a prophet yet he was a
[1:07:00] prophet not a man yet he was a man Jews
[1:07:04] don't try to claim him as yours or
[1:07:07] Americans or Africans or new foods new
[1:07:10] fees or whoever it's not belong to any
[1:07:13] one of us you know he was neither Jew
[1:07:15] nor Gentile he was God so we'll just go
[1:07:18] with what the Prophet says not with what
[1:07:20] some of my good friends say and say well
[1:07:23] Jesus wasn't God well excuse me we have
[1:07:26] somebody that knows what they're talking
[1:07:27] about
[1:07:28] we'll listen to him instead so Jesus
[1:07:31] Christ was the last Adam see the Lord of
[1:07:33] Heaven to reflect perfectly and take
[1:07:36] care of the sin problem 1st Corinthians
[1:07:38] chapter 15 we have the song we probably
[1:07:41] sing here he paid a debt he didn't know
[1:07:43] I ordered it I couldn't pay I needed
[1:07:47] someone to wash my sins away you know
[1:07:50] and now I sing a brand-new song amazing
[1:07:53] grace for Jesus paid a debt that I could
[1:07:56] never pay Jesus is the Redeemer William
[1:07:59] Branham is the restoration prophet stay
[1:08:02] in balance I know a lot of people that
[1:08:05] are not in balance so the original
[1:08:07] couple reflected God very well until
[1:08:12] they listened to Satan incarnate in the
[1:08:14] Beast everything was fine there was no
[1:08:17] problems until they started listening
[1:08:19] that guy you see and it didn't sound so
[1:08:22] bad you know it wasn't evil it wasn't
[1:08:25] bad it wasn't ugly it sounded reasonable
[1:08:27] well he could be right how many times we
[1:08:30] heard that well it sounds ok it's it's
[1:08:33] kind of what the scriptures say no we
[1:08:36] want to know exactly what it says you
[1:08:38] see so at that point the reflection was
[1:08:41] interrupted they reflected God perfectly
[1:08:43] until then but then when they start
[1:08:45] listening to what could be right maybe
[1:08:47] what do you think huh and the reflection
[1:08:49] then was interrupted they couldn't see
[1:08:51] themself clearly in the mirror of God's
[1:08:54] Word as they did the day before you see
[1:08:57] so what happened words and then
[1:09:00] attitudes and actions came between them
[1:09:03] and the god of creation and they at that
[1:09:07] time were out of balance it only got
[1:09:10] worse it got worse and worse and worse
[1:09:12] ok now
[1:09:16] they were still God's children you're
[1:09:20] God's child you wouldn't be here if you
[1:09:22] weren't you see and so they were still
[1:09:24] God's children his marvelous creation
[1:09:26] but the fellowship was broken you see
[1:09:28] only the fellowship was broken not the
[1:09:32] relationship so when you go out and you
[1:09:35] listen to this other stuff and you
[1:09:37] listen to your Mormon friends or whoever
[1:09:38] you listen to you start going in that
[1:09:40] direction it's not the same fellowship
[1:09:43] you don't feel comfortable but you see
[1:09:46] you're still a child of God now if
[1:09:48] you're not he'll go over there and
[1:09:50] you'll feel comfortable and you'll keep
[1:09:51] going but if you're a child of God you
[1:09:54] will be uncomfortable he will bring you
[1:09:56] back you're gonna pay if you you know
[1:09:59] you're gonna pay a price but he will
[1:10:00] bring you back now of course we have a
[1:10:02] story of Jonah Peter and others that
[1:10:05] then there may be something here today
[1:10:07] in a similar condition similar situation
[1:10:10] you are a child of God just a little bit
[1:10:12] out of fellowship you need to get back
[1:10:14] into fellowship you see out of balance
[1:10:17] with the God of the Bible now in Luke
[1:10:20] chapter one we have the story of
[1:10:23] Zechariah and Elizabeth they were old by
[1:10:26] this time now as a Cariah had a job in
[1:10:28] the temple and he was doing his duty
[1:10:30] whatever he was doing there and an angel
[1:10:33] from heaven appeared on the right side
[1:10:35] of the pulpit on the platform there of
[1:10:38] the altar and he tells him hey your
[1:10:42] prayer has been heard you can have a son
[1:10:44] well Zachariah didn't didn't you know
[1:10:47] get ugly about it he just showed a
[1:10:49] little bit of hesitation just a little
[1:10:52] bit of unbelief see and that developed
[1:10:54] into an attitude problem so you don't
[1:10:57] have to do a being seen a bunch of stuff
[1:10:59] and and go to Las Vegas and go to all do
[1:11:01] these awful things only show a little
[1:11:03] bit of fear a little bit of unbelief
[1:11:06] both are contrary to God's Word and the
[1:11:10] fellowship is broken but not the
[1:11:12] relationship so there's still hope but
[1:11:15] we're here to tell you that this is
[1:11:17] infallible Word of God it's got in
[1:11:20] printed form and you need to be able to
[1:11:23] see your reflection now this mirror is
[1:11:27] always clean you don't have to clean it
[1:11:29] yeah but the ministry does is adjust it
[1:11:32] to where you can see yourself see now
[1:11:37] Daniel the prophet reflected God so
[1:11:39] perfectly one day and he hadn't obeyed
[1:11:43] these these you know religious laws they
[1:11:46] had because they said no look we can't
[1:11:49] have people worshipping other gods you
[1:11:52] will not do this and this and this he
[1:11:54] said well I don't care what y'all say
[1:11:55] I've got a my window and prayed to
[1:11:57] Jerusalem every day well they caught him
[1:11:59] and they threw him in the lines and
[1:12:01] others Lions then was full of hungry
[1:12:04] lions not like we have at the zoo that
[1:12:06] they feed him four times a day
[1:12:07] now these clans were hungry and either
[1:12:10] thing that fell in there it disappeared
[1:12:12] in ten minutes
[1:12:13] but when he fell in this this pit with
[1:12:15] all these hungry lions they saw a
[1:12:18] reflection of the god of creation they
[1:12:20] saw something oh that's the creator and
[1:12:22] they couldn't take a bite and in the
[1:12:25] king saw it and brought him out you know
[1:12:27] well the Lions were afraid now he had
[1:12:32] some friends and they gave him new names
[1:12:34] and we're not going to go over there and
[1:12:35] find all their names but anyway they
[1:12:37] called him Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:12:39] see that was the heathen names they put
[1:12:42] on them and so they reflected God in
[1:12:44] such a powerful way one day that the
[1:12:47] fire could not burn them they were put
[1:12:49] in a white-hot fire and it didn't burn
[1:12:52] and just burned off the rope so they
[1:12:53] could worship God you see and they
[1:12:57] became indestructible and burnable but
[1:13:00] why were they in this predicament why
[1:13:02] were they in the fire now I know you've
[1:13:04] studied this in Sunday school but I'm
[1:13:07] only here today and tomorrow and so
[1:13:09] we're gonna try to just be real honest
[1:13:12] and show you God in simplicity it's okay
[1:13:15] I promise to come back for another 30
[1:13:19] years I don't want to come over here and
[1:13:23] see brother Daryl on crutches you know
[1:13:26] but you see what happened back then they
[1:13:30] why they were in this predicament the
[1:13:34] king at that time was so in love with
[1:13:36] the prophet of God and so he loved him
[1:13:39] so much that's Daniel
[1:13:41] and he said now he told us his uh his
[1:13:43] craftsman said I want you guys to make a
[1:13:46] statue
[1:13:46] we're gonna big statue and and we're
[1:13:50] gonna when you get up there at the head
[1:13:51] we're gonna make it look like Daniel I'm
[1:13:53] sure some of you seen the picture of the
[1:13:55] statue of Christ in South America Christ
[1:13:58] the Redeemer it's 98 feet tall so it's
[1:14:01] about the same size as that but the the
[1:14:04] the the statute over here with Daniel
[1:14:05] was not concrete or plastic or wood or
[1:14:09] aluminum it was gold 90 feet tall and so
[1:14:14] they had this law that when the certain
[1:14:17] music sounded they would all have to bow
[1:14:20] on two knees towards the statue while
[1:14:22] the music's playing and that was the law
[1:14:25] but you see these two from these three
[1:14:27] friends of Daniel they knew better
[1:14:29] because in the scripture it says in
[1:14:31] Leviticus you shall make no idols nor
[1:14:33] graven image amen neither rule you up a
[1:14:38] standing image neither shall you set up
[1:14:40] any image of stone in your land or bow
[1:14:42] down to it for I am the Lord your God
[1:14:44] there's only one God see we reflect the
[1:14:49] god of glory but there's one God so when
[1:14:52] they did when the music sounded and
[1:14:53] these three guys didn't bow well the
[1:14:57] religious police came by and grabbed him
[1:14:58] brought him in to the king now the King
[1:15:01] loved them too because they were
[1:15:02] Daniel's friends so they brought him in
[1:15:04] there and they said I look Oh King live
[1:15:05] forever and these three guys you know
[1:15:08] they're foreigners in the first place
[1:15:09] but they're here and they didn't bow to
[1:15:11] the image now you know we have these
[1:15:13] laws so the King says no look boys I
[1:15:15] love you guys and you know I'm trying to
[1:15:19] understand this religion of yours but
[1:15:21] but hey I love Daniel and you love
[1:15:23] Daniel what's the problem so they quoted
[1:15:25] in the scripture from you know leviticus
[1:15:26] 26:1 and he said well I'll tell you what
[1:15:30] you go down on one knee and we'll call
[1:15:32] it even
[1:15:33] and they said note not one need not two
[1:15:36] knees we're not
[1:15:37] Allen well then we got to throw you in
[1:15:39] the fire Thor's in the fire we don't
[1:15:40] care our God is able to deliver us we
[1:15:43] believe that much you see so it was time
[1:15:45] for them to really believe well they
[1:15:48] wouldn't bow to the image of the prophet
[1:15:50] of God they wouldn't Bend in their Holy
[1:15:52] Ghost convictions and they would not
[1:15:54] burn in the horrible fire how those
[1:15:57] things are there for our admonition to
[1:15:59] see and neither will the elect lady
[1:16:01] God's bride
[1:16:02] she won't bow she won't Bend and she
[1:16:05] won't burn but only before you get too
[1:16:08] excited only a few qualify
[1:16:09] one-in-a-million ok brother Brendan says
[1:16:13] the Gentile age began with forced
[1:16:16] worship of a holy man and the Gentile
[1:16:18] age goes out the same way with forced
[1:16:20] worship of a holy man now God knows
[1:16:23] who's who I was just telling you what
[1:16:25] the word says but nowadays you know
[1:16:28] there's there's forces around well you
[1:16:30] either do it our way or we'll draw you
[1:16:32] out of the circle that's fine draw us
[1:16:35] out of the circle we're serving God not
[1:16:38] man and we will attempt to make your
[1:16:41] life miserable it's going on and it's
[1:16:47] happening in October of 2015
[1:16:50] now some people reflect Satan and many
[1:16:54] of his attributes in full color because
[1:16:58] if you haven't noticed the newspapers or
[1:17:00] the television or the city sin is
[1:17:03] painted to be very beautiful Las Vegas
[1:17:07] and Atlantic City are beautiful it's not
[1:17:10] ugly you see and so following Satan you
[1:17:15] form addictions when you when you follow
[1:17:17] Satan you form addictions just like when
[1:17:19] you follow the word you have a time that
[1:17:21] you read a time that you pray a time
[1:17:23] that you listen now you want to call it
[1:17:26] a habit fine or an addiction but it's
[1:17:28] it's it's a habit that it takes you
[1:17:29] closer to God
[1:17:30] but if you're going to follow Satan
[1:17:32] you're gonna form addictions to
[1:17:34] television the movies the gambling etc
[1:17:39] and carrying spoken-word books at the
[1:17:41] same time it's happening we have all
[1:17:46] kinds of things that are going wrong
[1:17:47] today now it used to be the television
[1:17:49] well today we've got it all right here
[1:17:51] this is your personal branch of the tree
[1:17:54] of knowledge and depends where you put
[1:17:57] your fingers
[1:17:58] what kind of ugly things come up so be
[1:18:01] careful you're warned now don't be like
[1:18:05] some people I got this one friend he's
[1:18:07] got a cell phone he only turns it on
[1:18:09] when he's using it so I can't call him
[1:18:11] unless he happens to have it off it's
[1:18:15] probably good if you turn it on well
[1:18:17] anyway there's all kinds of addictions
[1:18:22] that you form when you follow it Satan
[1:18:23] and of course it's reasonable because
[1:18:26] well I'm not so bad that guy well
[1:18:28] there's worse there's always somebody
[1:18:30] worse than than you you see and these
[1:18:35] people never get enough now Satan is a
[1:18:37] bad bad boy
[1:18:39] now he will he will tempt you to go into
[1:18:42] the store and rob the store for your
[1:18:45] habit but while you're in there verse he
[1:18:47] he's outside on his cell phone calling
[1:18:49] the police on you that's how bad Satan
[1:18:53] is so the fruits the fruit of following
[1:18:59] Satan is death eternal separation and
[1:19:03] there's only two forces in the world
[1:19:04] today you might think there's a lot no
[1:19:06] there's different colors but it's only
[1:19:08] two forces you're either on God's side
[1:19:10] or on satan's side which one are you
[1:19:14] following which one are you reflecting
[1:19:16] now we do live in a apparently a very
[1:19:19] enlightened age we got these little guys
[1:19:21] we got nice lights we've got you know
[1:19:23] microphones got nice everything did
[1:19:27] anybody walk to church I don't think so
[1:19:29] no you know every we all got nice things
[1:19:33] but we live in dark Laodicea
[1:19:36] now when brother Branham was preaching
[1:19:38] in the islands of the Caribbean in 1959
[1:19:41] there were some Americans with him and
[1:19:44] one of them asked him and there for our
[1:19:46] interview you said he had they sent a
[1:19:48] brother Brown why do you say so much
[1:19:50] about 1977
[1:19:52] which was 18 years in the future right
[1:19:54] preach in the coming the Lord we don't
[1:19:55] know if we've been getting there so
[1:19:57] brother Brennan said well very simple
[1:19:59] when I was looking through the stream of
[1:20:00] time and of course prophets can do that
[1:20:02] they can see the years he said when I
[1:20:04] got to 77 it was so dark that I didn't
[1:20:08] see how any believer could live in such
[1:20:09] darkness and that's why I said what I
[1:20:11] said about 1977 well that's reasonable
[1:20:15] well anybody can figure out that we're a
[1:20:18] long ways from 77 now about 30-something
[1:20:25] years right
[1:20:25] so how dark is it it's very dark but
[1:20:29] there are going to be some people that
[1:20:30] are going to be victorious out of
[1:20:32] Laodicea and when you get to heaven they
[1:20:37] may give out a t-shirt I don't know but
[1:20:41] it's not gonna say survivor it's going
[1:20:43] to say overcomer
[1:20:45] we are the overcomers elata sia you know
[1:20:50] some some Christians reflect their
[1:20:53] pastor they can coughs just like the
[1:20:55] pastor they can walk like the pastor
[1:20:57] they can buy a car like the pastor you
[1:21:00] know that's all quite natural but the
[1:21:03] past are supposed to be pointing us to
[1:21:05] Jesus Christ the great Shepherd
[1:21:08] you see we follow the pastor as long as
[1:21:11] the pastor follows and reflects Christ
[1:21:13] so when the parent gets on a tantrum it
[1:21:16] starts blasting everybody didn't see it
[1:21:17] his way or whatever whether it's time to
[1:21:20] pick up beautiful things and move on you
[1:21:22] see but the pastor you have a parent has
[1:21:25] done a good job you know he's done a
[1:21:28] good job but the job of the minister is
[1:21:32] to make Christ real to the people that's
[1:21:36] it that's his only job you see otherwise
[1:21:38] he's wasting his time and your time now
[1:21:43] when Eleazar went to get Rebekah
[1:21:46] remember the story and the camels okay
[1:21:50] so Elly's just coming back with Maria
[1:21:52] back on these camels he was her pastor
[1:21:54] during the trip
[1:21:56] you see and but guess what he didn't
[1:21:59] molest her he didn't he didn't bother
[1:22:01] her he only told her the stories about
[1:22:04] where they're going
[1:22:05] they had a lot of questions and answers
[1:22:06] and that's the only wish you didn't have
[1:22:09] I pet it and have pictures and she would
[1:22:12] ask questions and he would give answers
[1:22:13] about Isaac and so he brought her safely
[1:22:16] to Isaac you see now there's people that
[1:22:19] reflect their church they're always on
[1:22:21] the defensive because their church is
[1:22:22] the best and their pastors the best and
[1:22:24] so forth but the the fact is that you
[1:22:30] can pretty much see these people when
[1:22:32] you go to town
[1:22:32] because they have they have an attitude
[1:22:34] about them their church is the best you
[1:22:36] know and then we have people that
[1:22:39] reflect a good moral family we have the
[1:22:42] story in where's it at in mark 10 I
[1:22:44] believe of the rich young ruler now this
[1:22:46] guy was very wealthy he had the best
[1:22:49] horse he had the best silver saddle he
[1:22:51] had everything nice in today's world
[1:22:54] he'd have he wouldn't be driving a
[1:22:55] little sorry $50,000 van no he never the
[1:22:58] Lamborghini didn't he really nice and so
[1:23:01] um so he had everything but something
[1:23:03] was missing
[1:23:04] any-any searched and he came running
[1:23:07] desperately and he bound to Jesus said
[1:23:10] what shall I do to inherit eternal life
[1:23:12] so first of all he had the correct
[1:23:15] attitude of approach he came in humility
[1:23:18] he didn't section off twenty ten minutes
[1:23:21] okay tell me what I need to do I gotta
[1:23:23] go no he came humbly to see what the
[1:23:26] answer would be and so of course humbly
[1:23:29] many much more than a lot of Christians
[1:23:31] but Jesus immediately said well you know
[1:23:33] what the commandments are because they
[1:23:34] discerned him right away he said you
[1:23:36] don't do this you know and the guy said
[1:23:38] yeah I know all that since I was a
[1:23:39] little boy you know I've been to church
[1:23:41] activities I know all the rules and but
[1:23:44] it was all ritual there was no life it
[1:23:46] was just plastic you know and he was
[1:23:48] very religious but he was only
[1:23:50] reflecting the church teaching this what
[1:23:54] we have here is a whole lot more than
[1:23:55] just church teaching it's immortal and
[1:23:58] then Gerald's preaching it's the Word of
[1:24:00] God and it'll live through you if you
[1:24:03] subject yourself to it the same so none
[1:24:06] of this was real to him it was just a
[1:24:07] bunch of quotations so forth and you
[1:24:10] know we all face difficulties in life
[1:24:12] nobody has an easy road the very rich
[1:24:15] people there have a lot of difficulties
[1:24:18] you know sure enough be
[1:24:19] or nothing no silver dollars roll away
[1:24:21] you know everybody's got problems you
[1:24:23] see and some when they have their
[1:24:26] problems in a church of course probably
[1:24:28] not here but some other place I've been
[1:24:29] they automatically blame the pastor oh
[1:24:31] it's got to be the pastor's fault that
[1:24:33] this happened you know well guess what
[1:24:36] it's not always the pastor's fault now
[1:24:38] God allows a pastor to have one or two
[1:24:43] really hard-headed sheep they're there
[1:24:46] for the pastor's perfection yeah you see
[1:24:50] so it all works together
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:55] it was thinking later now in Psalm says
[1:25:01] I was shaped in iniquity and in sin did
[1:25:03] my mother conceive me in Psalm 58 they
[1:25:05] go straight as soon as they're born
[1:25:06] speaking lies that happens in the Smith
[1:25:08] family the Brandon family and all
[1:25:10] families those little guys are
[1:25:12] hard-wired to lie to protect theirself
[1:25:16] you know and so the scripture tells us
[1:25:21] also in Romans 3:23 for all have sinned
[1:25:23] no matter what your name is all have
[1:25:26] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:25:27] God now we claim our children and it
[1:25:30] does work you see in mark 10 we have the
[1:25:34] story of you know Jesus and the children
[1:25:38] he took him up in his arms and he
[1:25:40] blessed him now what was the the mighty
[1:25:41] disciples doing they were trying to
[1:25:43] scare him away they hadn't learned yet
[1:25:47] that the kingdom of God is like a little
[1:25:50] child you got to be a little like a
[1:25:51] little child to get there you see
[1:25:52] because see the little children they
[1:25:55] were having this personal contact
[1:25:57] they're innocent they're trusting you
[1:26:00] know they have no guile they don't need
[1:26:02] a bunch of explanations so we got to say
[1:26:04] what we mean and mean what we say
[1:26:06] why because children are discerning
[1:26:09] these children are our offspring that
[1:26:12] are fruit of the Blessed union they're
[1:26:14] precious and they can tell when you're
[1:26:16] lying
[1:26:17] faith look right through you you know of
[1:26:21] course little children like a little
[1:26:22] sponge you know they're collected stuff
[1:26:24] all the time
[1:26:25] they don't collect everything you click
[1:26:27] but they collects if you know
[1:26:28] information and and they record all
[1:26:32] these things and then there's a time
[1:26:34] when it has to be manifest it's usually
[1:26:37] at Grandma's house or some embarrassing
[1:26:39] situation or it comes out you know but
[1:26:42] they're interested innocently reflecting
[1:26:45] what they are in the spirit world you
[1:26:47] see so no one was born right
[1:26:50] no one automatically reflects God you
[1:26:52] have a process that you come through but
[1:26:54] God has made a way he has a way to
[1:26:56] straighten everybody out and get him on
[1:26:58] the right path everybody has to come to
[1:27:01] repentance because Romans 6 says for the
[1:27:03] wages of sin is death and raised
[1:27:07] specifically but the gift of God is
[1:27:09] eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[1:27:11] Lord no there's no other path you see
[1:27:14] only through Jesus Christ sin looks
[1:27:17] really good it looks delicious but it
[1:27:19] pays really bad death eternal separation
[1:27:22] from God
[1:27:24] and there's only one form of eternal
[1:27:27] life now I've got four brothers that are
[1:27:28] Baptist preachers and they posed the
[1:27:31] question to their people every week
[1:27:32] where do you want to spend eternity with
[1:27:34] God or Satan well that's certainly not
[1:27:37] the choice because if you don't accept
[1:27:39] eternal life the way God print paints it
[1:27:42] for you then you're gonna be an eyelid
[1:27:44] you're gonna go to zero it's gonna be a
[1:27:46] lot of suffering so there's only one way
[1:27:48] by the way the cross okay now brother
[1:27:52] Brennan says I would rather have the
[1:27:54] wrong doctrine you don't misunderstand
[1:27:56] the Bible but have the right spirit then
[1:27:59] to have the perfect doctrine in a wrong
[1:28:01] spirit because the wrong the wrong
[1:28:06] spirit won't take you to the right
[1:28:08] doctrine the right doctrine might not
[1:28:12] take you to the right spirit you've got
[1:28:14] to have the right spirit to get anywhere
[1:28:15] you see you got to be balanced it's not
[1:28:19] an option now we've heard the gospel
[1:28:22] many times we're very educated in the
[1:28:25] prophetic message you've heard many
[1:28:27] explanations through the years but the
[1:28:29] question tonight for every one of us
[1:28:31] have we been born again that's not just
[1:28:35] Billy Graham Smith says it's our message
[1:28:36] they say
[1:28:37] is Christ real in your life or only in
[1:28:40] your mind in your imagination see we
[1:28:43] have to face that many on the planet
[1:28:46] haven't even heard of Jesus Christ
[1:28:47] Romans 10 tells us that somebody has to
[1:28:50] go preach to him somebody brought the
[1:28:53] gospel here and didn't come in parachute
[1:28:55] somebody came over here in a boat
[1:28:57] brought the gospel to this island you
[1:29:00] know and there's people out there that
[1:29:02] still need to hear so God calls
[1:29:05] ministers they're sent to preach and God
[1:29:08] does the work supernaturally in the
[1:29:10] human heart there's no guaranteed
[1:29:12] results if I preach this they're all
[1:29:14] going to repent it doesn't say that we
[1:29:16] spread the gospel the seed come to God
[1:29:19] you see so then it's not just an
[1:29:22] explanation you see now Billy Graham
[1:29:25] said it's on the wall down at his
[1:29:27] library he said I've had the privilege
[1:29:29] of preaching the gospel in every
[1:29:30] continent of the world and I found that
[1:29:32] when the gospel of Jesus Christ is
[1:29:33] presented with Authority quoting the
[1:29:35] very word of God he takes the message
[1:29:37] and supernaturally drives it into the
[1:29:39] human heart we can't do that we can only
[1:29:42] make Christ real to the people but they
[1:29:45] have to respond and so that's why it
[1:29:47] works the brother Branham says here did
[1:29:50] you know he says did you know God knew
[1:29:53] that we'd be standing here 10 million
[1:29:54] years before the world was ever founded
[1:29:56] did you know that he knew we'd be
[1:29:57] standing here the infinity of God knew
[1:30:00] every fly every gnat every cockroach
[1:30:03] every mosquito all those things that we
[1:30:06] kill in the summer time
[1:30:07] God knew all that and how many times
[1:30:11] each one would bat his eye and how much
[1:30:13] tattle that would produce that's quite a
[1:30:16] computer sin he knew all that before the
[1:30:18] world's ever formed so he says now you
[1:30:21] say well if he knows all that then why
[1:30:24] are you preaching that's part of God's
[1:30:26] program preaching is his program now
[1:30:30] there's something that a lot of people
[1:30:31] can't quote
[1:30:32] tomorrow morning because they have
[1:30:34] another idea of how the gospel should be
[1:30:36] preached the brother Brennan says
[1:30:38] preaching is his program when he looked
[1:30:40] upon the Apostles he looked upon the
[1:30:41] harvest he said the harvest is ripe and
[1:30:43] the laborers are few
[1:30:44] the only Dupree to the Lord of the
[1:30:46] harvest it will send laborers into his
[1:30:47] harvest
[1:30:49] and he says well why would they have to
[1:30:52] pray to the Lord of the harvest to send
[1:30:53] laborers into his harvest if the Lord of
[1:30:55] the harvest was standing there knowing
[1:30:57] how it would be done good question
[1:31:01] he says God has so arranged it that his
[1:31:05] program cannot move without you and me
[1:31:07] and as long as we're not doing what God
[1:31:10] leads us to do were paralyzing his
[1:31:12] program but when the church moved by the
[1:31:16] anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:17] then we're in God's will doing this
[1:31:19] program see then we're reflecting a God
[1:31:22] of glory
[1:31:22] then things can happen so after
[1:31:25] conversion then the obedient humble
[1:31:28] harmonious life begins to reflect the
[1:31:30] reality of Christ 24/7 excuse me did
[1:31:39] anybody notice that the pastor wasn't
[1:31:41] speaking quite right tonight I've got a
[1:31:43] bad throat well he's a lot better than
[1:31:45] it was three days ago
[1:31:47] he was preaching me all the way down
[1:31:49] there
[1:31:56] so you see they have people have to come
[1:32:00] to conversion then a harmonious life
[1:32:02] begins to reflect Christ
[1:32:04] now some grow faster than others now all
[1:32:07] of us have most of us have raised some
[1:32:09] children they're all different you don't
[1:32:11] have the same rules for the know they're
[1:32:13] all a little different so they grow
[1:32:15] differently you see but it's a process
[1:32:17] so your life is reflecting something
[1:32:20] every moment of the day while you're
[1:32:23] awake you're reflecting something now
[1:32:26] you own if you have a circle of
[1:32:28] influence I don't live here but you live
[1:32:30] here you got a circle of influence
[1:32:31] people that are looking at you they're
[1:32:33] watching you closely because they have a
[1:32:36] thirst to see something real now here
[1:32:39] you are saying your believer sometimes
[1:32:41] you carry in your Bible sometimes you're
[1:32:43] praying over your food they're watching
[1:32:44] that you see they're watching and they
[1:32:47] want to see a reality because there's
[1:32:49] been too much fantasy too much
[1:32:50] make-believe and too many explanations
[1:32:52] so your life should make others wonder
[1:32:56] and ask questions
[1:32:58] and you can't always take him to brother
[1:32:59] Gerald he's got it life too you need to
[1:33:03] have some of the answers you can't
[1:33:05] always take people to the pasture now we
[1:33:08] all know I should say we all because
[1:33:10] there's some people here again used to
[1:33:14] be believers they don't believe that
[1:33:16] there's five coming to Elijah but we do
[1:33:18] because the scripture says it so you if
[1:33:21] you've been in this church over six
[1:33:22] months you should be able to open your
[1:33:24] Bible and show the five comings of
[1:33:26] Elijah when somebody asks you or what do
[1:33:29] y'all believe so simple then after they
[1:33:32] start asking questions then maybe put a
[1:33:34] book in their hand or a tape or a DVD or
[1:33:37] something but first it's your life
[1:33:38] that's what the first thing is and we're
[1:33:41] not out proselytizing we don't want all
[1:33:43] this city in here what we're going to
[1:33:44] put them we only want the Eagles there's
[1:33:47] still some Eagles out there don't know
[1:33:48] their Eagles you see and so the non
[1:33:52] Eagles they don't care they don't
[1:33:53] respond now everybody knows that the
[1:33:58] current Pope is named Francis right
[1:34:00] right does anybody know what name his
[1:34:05] mother gave him when he was born
[1:34:08] aha gotcha she called him George
[1:34:19] but when he came to Rome he wanted to be
[1:34:22] real nice meek and humble so he takes on
[1:34:26] the name Francis because Francis lived
[1:34:28] about 900 years ago and he was the one
[1:34:30] that talked to the birds and so forth
[1:34:31] and so he wanted to be that well we know
[1:34:35] where the bread said Francis was a
[1:34:36] gospel preacher okay and among other
[1:34:39] things that Francis said back then he
[1:34:41] said preach always use words when
[1:34:44] necessary all but that's not our way
[1:34:47] we're North Americans we know it all
[1:34:50] look what we've got you know so we like
[1:34:52] to talk and talk and talk
[1:34:54] no you're wrong on this you're on it
[1:34:56] wait a minute all this talking
[1:34:58] eventually it doesn't you know square
[1:35:00] off with your it doesn't balance with
[1:35:01] your testimony even you've been tell
[1:35:03] them what great believer you're on
[1:35:04] William ran in a blah blah blah and then
[1:35:06] and then what about your testimony all
[1:35:10] these words so just live your message
[1:35:12] then if they if they ask a question you
[1:35:15] can give them an answer out of the Bible
[1:35:17] you see why do women wear long long hair
[1:35:22] because the Bible says so where there
[1:35:25] were long dresses because the Bible says
[1:35:26] so okay
[1:35:30] in John chapter 12 there were some
[1:35:32] Greeks that had heard about Jesus they
[1:35:35] saw the reflection in some people now
[1:35:37] they want to see the real one you see
[1:35:39] they want to see him and so brother Ram
[1:35:42] says these Greeks were not looking for a
[1:35:44] lecturer now some of you guys were
[1:35:46] school right
[1:35:47] you know what lectures are like pretty
[1:35:49] boring aren't they okay they were
[1:35:54] looking for a lecture they weren't
[1:35:56] looking for pulpit clowns
[1:35:58] y'all ever see the pulpit clown well
[1:36:01] maybe she ever get off the island you'll
[1:36:02] see him there down there we got him they
[1:36:06] weren't looking for that they were not
[1:36:07] looking for entertainers they wanted to
[1:36:09] see him the person Jesus Christ okay
[1:36:13] let's move ahead here now as parents
[1:36:17] what are we reflect into our children a
[1:36:20] minor already growing I got
[1:36:21] grandchildren bigger than I am so you
[1:36:23] know already come through all this now
[1:36:25] youth is beautiful but I don't want to
[1:36:27] live these 50 years over again see I'm
[1:36:30] only 20 years old a 50 years experience
[1:36:34] but you see what I'll be reflecting to
[1:36:38] our children they are young but they're
[1:36:40] not deaf they're not blind
[1:36:42] they're very discerning you see Jesus
[1:36:45] except you become like one of these if
[1:36:48] you're not going
[1:36:49] you see soap estimate pessimistic
[1:36:52] parents breed children with very low
[1:36:55] self-esteem attitudes begin with us we
[1:37:00] are the teacher we are the adult we give
[1:37:02] them love unconditionally we listen
[1:37:06] unbiased the door is always open come in
[1:37:09] and talk we trust them till they give us
[1:37:12] reason not to that's what I told my
[1:37:14] children I'm gonna trust you so I got
[1:37:16] good reason not to trust you
[1:37:17] you know we serve them unselfishly we
[1:37:21] honor them as little miracles from God
[1:37:23] and God that these children will imitate
[1:37:26] your actions much quicker than the words
[1:37:30] and your desires because they're
[1:37:32] watching us know what you say they're
[1:37:33] watching how you act see so we all want
[1:37:36] something better for our children we try
[1:37:38] to smooth out the way you know and let
[1:37:40] them not get hurt or face adversity but
[1:37:43] that's not always the best way you see
[1:37:45] remember what you're raising is your
[1:37:47] replacements these are your replacements
[1:37:50] okay so if you're critical rebuke
[1:37:54] or hypocritical children will be that
[1:37:57] way amen
[1:37:59] so you know that we send them to school
[1:38:03] or did you pick up that kind of stuff
[1:38:05] come home repeat and stuff you know so
[1:38:08] it's a vicious cycle but we have to be
[1:38:10] very careful how we have we raised them
[1:38:13] we instruct them in the scriptures and I
[1:38:17] did steal something out of your office
[1:38:19] for the drill this little paper here on
[1:38:22] Susanna Wesley
[1:38:24] how to raise children
[1:38:29] so everything with children starts at
[1:38:31] home you can't be living in your way
[1:38:34] come in here and expect them to be
[1:38:36] little angels it doesn't work that way
[1:38:37] they got to know how to act before they
[1:38:39] get here there's a couple over in
[1:38:42] Saskatchewan that they the kids play
[1:38:45] church you know at home can they they
[1:38:48] learn to sit still they learned to
[1:38:50] listen no way to get there real church
[1:38:51] sitting still now this is a couple I
[1:38:55] know down in North Carolina they got
[1:38:56] this little four year old you never sit
[1:38:58] still you just turn things up it's going
[1:39:01] to cost them dearly one of these days
[1:39:02] but it all starts at home parents are
[1:39:05] their first line of defense an
[1:39:07] instruction and training and molding
[1:39:09] reflecting the glory of God so as
[1:39:11] parents we have the awesome
[1:39:13] responsibility to be a friend to the
[1:39:16] child see we don't repeat conversations
[1:39:19] to others that's gossip where we can be
[1:39:22] a confidante you know the door is always
[1:39:24] open it stops right here
[1:39:26] and we must work with and not against
[1:39:29] these these kids are our friends to a
[1:39:32] certain extent but we're still the adult
[1:39:34] you save it and this begins at 12 months
[1:39:37] not at 12 years you see but we got to
[1:39:40] stay balanced that stay positive got to
[1:39:43] remember who the adult is okay so after
[1:39:46] receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:39:47] Peter reflected God in such a way that
[1:39:50] just his shadow passing over the people
[1:39:53] healed on me there was only a few days
[1:39:55] before that he was blasting and cutting
[1:39:57] the guy's ear off and done all kinds of
[1:39:59] things right lying and swearing won't
[1:40:04] got into Peter here he'd been operating
[1:40:07] these this gift and been following the
[1:40:09] master for these years and and and Jesus
[1:40:11] said and I've always seen him anybody
[1:40:13] got a weapon oh yeah we got two swords
[1:40:16] plant that's all we need so they go into
[1:40:18] the garden they're praying they're over
[1:40:20] there and and there's a place where they
[1:40:23] were sleeping they weren't sleeping
[1:40:25] under the trees and it was cold so
[1:40:27] anyway they're there and so here comes
[1:40:30] the the Pharisees and the Romans you
[1:40:32] know they're gonna take Jesus now he
[1:40:33] looked like everybody else he didn't
[1:40:35] have a halo it didn't they didn't know
[1:40:36] who he was
[1:40:37] Judas had to kiss him to know which one
[1:40:39] he was so all of a sudden when Jesus
[1:40:42] tell him he's telling the disciples my
[1:40:45] guys gonna get really tougher a little
[1:40:46] bit
[1:40:46] they're gonna come they're gonna give
[1:40:47] y'all no no I'm Peter they got to come
[1:40:50] to me first
[1:40:51] and Jesus said Peter you better just zip
[1:40:54] in and stop got to come through me now
[1:40:58] where was all the Earth's time they were
[1:40:59] back there Amen Peter you tell him and
[1:41:01] so and so when they when they got there
[1:41:05] and there they were there with the
[1:41:07] torches and things and Peter got all man
[1:41:10] well he got in the flesh real quick
[1:41:12] and you think he was aiming for the year
[1:41:13] that's pretty good slice isn't it he was
[1:41:15] aiming for here we missed he got the ear
[1:41:18] now there's that there's the ear laying
[1:41:20] on the ground oh wow this guy's bleedin
[1:41:24] and Jesus picks up the ear and puts it
[1:41:27] on perfect operation everybody should
[1:41:31] have been on their knees but they had
[1:41:35] such hate and such just venom
[1:41:37] it took him you know and so he's over
[1:41:40] there at Caiaphas house and that's the
[1:41:42] only night he spent in Jerusalem all the
[1:41:44] other places they went out but this
[1:41:46] night they got him in a prison in
[1:41:48] Jerusalem so he's a prisoner and Peter
[1:41:52] must have paid somebody somehow he got
[1:41:54] into the same yard and it was cold so
[1:41:57] they got this fire going he's over there
[1:41:58] warming his hands at the enemy's fire
[1:42:01] didn't bring his own fire and so he's
[1:42:03] warming his hands and so the girl comes
[1:42:05] by serving the tea and she when she gave
[1:42:08] it to him he said well thank you but see
[1:42:11] he was from Galilee it's like you guys
[1:42:13] say and thank you down in Georgia
[1:42:14] it's obviously you're not from there so
[1:42:18] when he spoke you're one of them never
[1:42:21] heard of him big swear word came out and
[1:42:23] so then another one came by hey I saw
[1:42:27] you at the meeting last week a you're
[1:42:28] one of them
[1:42:29] never heard of him that's just a few
[1:42:31] hours before that he was willing to
[1:42:33] fight for him and kill him
[1:42:35] and now he's just being this girl says
[1:42:38] you're one of them never heard of a big
[1:42:40] swear word comes out and when he did the
[1:42:43] third time the rooster crows
[1:42:45] a little bit late Peter but now that
[1:42:48] he's received the Holy Ghost now just
[1:42:51] the just shadow was him he's one of the
[1:42:54] spokesman for the big church going home
[1:42:56] you know so these were all normal people
[1:42:59] like us they weren't super humans but
[1:43:02] they all had an experience you see now
[1:43:05] Hebrews chapter six brother Brent says
[1:43:08] you may impersonate the right thing you
[1:43:11] may impersonate a Christian but by and
[1:43:13] by there will come a time when the
[1:43:15] strain will be put on then it'll show
[1:43:17] what you are when Christ the Son of God
[1:43:20] was put to the test it showed what he
[1:43:21] was when you're put the test it'll prove
[1:43:24] what you are your life always reflects
[1:43:26] what's on the inside by and by your sins
[1:43:29] will find you out jesus said in Saint
[1:43:32] John 5:24 he that heareth not he the
[1:43:35] shaketh there he the speaketh he that
[1:43:36] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:43:38] that sent me has eternal life and shall
[1:43:40] not shall never come into the judgment
[1:43:44] but has passed from death unto life you
[1:43:47] see now he says it's your faith and your
[1:43:51] faith confessed by your lips only makes
[1:43:54] manifest to the people that you can hear
[1:43:55] that still doesn't solve anything
[1:43:57] anybody can hear and repeat see that you
[1:44:01] can hear but your life is open to all so
[1:44:05] see like like back there with Francis is
[1:44:06] a fourth it doesn't matter what you say
[1:44:08] it's what you live see so no matter how
[1:44:12] much you try to act like this or that
[1:44:14] it'll never work it's got to be in you
[1:44:16] that's the real kernel of the whole
[1:44:18] story your personal faith and the
[1:44:20] resurrected Christ as your Savior that
[1:44:22] he's at the right hand of God acting in
[1:44:23] your place this morning as you're acting
[1:44:25] in his place down here as a witness okay
[1:44:28] the witness is to act instead of
[1:44:31] somebody stand for you as a witness and
[1:44:33] as your life reflects here what your
[1:44:36] testimony is in Christ
[1:44:38] it reflects their and it reflects here
[1:44:41] he is up there as what he is for you
[1:44:44] reflects both here and there so by your
[1:44:47] faith are you saved in that alone now
[1:44:52] there's something else here that says
[1:44:56] here
[1:44:57] okay so what are we reflecting in 2015
[1:45:02] are we were infecting just just demand
[1:45:05] william branham I mean I know people
[1:45:06] they know he likes cherry pie and they
[1:45:09] know he likes to hunt squirrels and all
[1:45:10] these things but what about the word he
[1:45:12] preached what about the real meat of it
[1:45:15] you know you see
[1:45:16] so are we reflecting just churchianity
[1:45:18] or what you see if you're reflecting
[1:45:20] rock and roll music be careful it'll
[1:45:22] take you down you see let's see we got
[1:45:26] too many Pharisees too many actors now
[1:45:29] years ago and some of you can barely
[1:45:32] remember but we had a black telephone
[1:45:34] and had a dial okay
[1:45:38] then later they had push-button but they
[1:45:40] had the dial okay so in the phone rang
[1:45:43] you had to be nice because you had no
[1:45:45] clue who it was it might be the bank
[1:45:48] it might be mortgage company might be
[1:45:51] your mother-in-law we don't know so it
[1:45:53] could be real nice
[1:45:54] now that's an actor it's a Pharisee now
[1:45:58] today we got these nice little guys and
[1:46:00] and we know exactly who it is we can
[1:46:04] just I'm not here still actors brother
[1:46:14] Brennan says brother Brennan says I'm a
[1:46:15] Christian oh ho church he bought you
[1:46:17] there's only one I've been at Brandon 55
[1:46:19] years and never did join the family I
[1:46:22] was born one that's how you're born in
[1:46:24] the kingdom of God and you're and your
[1:46:27] reflection of his word okay and the
[1:46:30] questions and answers 54 is real good
[1:46:32] what you are somewhere else is what you
[1:46:34] reflect here
[1:46:35] what's your celestial body is somewhere
[1:46:38] else it's what you're reflecting back
[1:46:39] here he says that three times here in
[1:46:42] the spirit land what you are it's what
[1:46:44] you are here if you're still vulgar
[1:46:46] minded and so forth it's all in
[1:46:49] Galatians five we're not going to go
[1:46:51] into it and so forth
[1:46:56] and the spirit land then your vulgar
[1:46:58] mind adhere see the Pharisees again if
[1:47:01] you're still got if you still got malice
[1:47:03] envy and strife you're in the spirit
[1:47:05] land with that and it reflects back here
[1:47:07] but if your whole innermost being has
[1:47:09] become cleansed and purged it shows that
[1:47:12] you've got a body out yonder waiting see
[1:47:15] and that's why the scripture says if
[1:47:17] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:47:19] have one already waiting to see so this
[1:47:22] isn't fantasy this is reality okay in
[1:47:25] the images of Christ he says brother
[1:47:27] I know it's called heresy it's called
[1:47:29] fanaticism but if I had a choice to make
[1:47:32] tonight my choice would be to be like
[1:47:35] him this is after many years preaching
[1:47:39] the gospel okay after 25 years of a
[1:47:41] world-shaking ministry he's saying
[1:47:43] things like this
[1:47:44] I want if anything in my life to reflect
[1:47:46] the image of the Lord Jesus in my life
[1:47:49] he says I'm going tomorrow night after
[1:47:52] this wedding I'm going out to the
[1:47:53] wilderness and I'm gonna stay there
[1:47:55] because way down in my soul I feel I
[1:47:58] need a closer walk with God Wow
[1:48:01] and not just a closer walk I want to
[1:48:04] walk right I tried to walk Mauri before
[1:48:05] him but I want to walk closer all the
[1:48:08] Branum Tabernacles hang a revival I want
[1:48:10] one myself
[1:48:11] I don't just happen in the building I
[1:48:13] want it to happen in me I want a closer
[1:48:15] walk I want more of the Holy Spirit in
[1:48:18] me to reflect Christ in me that would
[1:48:22] look good on the refrigerator wouldn't
[1:48:23] it I want to be like him I know that
[1:48:26] every true Christian wants to be like
[1:48:27] him
[1:48:28] that's my heart's desire to be like
[1:48:30] Jesus well he is the example of what I
[1:48:33] want to be and look it'll take the Holy
[1:48:36] Ghost to do that it's the only thing
[1:48:38] that can do it he says I'm not
[1:48:39] interested in cemeteries and what
[1:48:41] somebody's got to tell me I don't care
[1:48:43] about kissing a crucifix or pulling
[1:48:45] through on your heart or saying prayers
[1:48:47] to the Dead I'm interested in one thing
[1:48:48] that's more of the Holy Spirit to take
[1:48:51] over William Brown
[1:48:53] I'm not interested enjoying a greater
[1:48:55] Church so forth I want more of the Holy
[1:48:59] Ghost in my life to reflect Christ whom
[1:49:02] I love now I knew William Branham okay
[1:49:06] he's my father-in-law and he reflected
[1:49:09] Christ in such a way that some thought
[1:49:12] he was Jesus Christ
[1:49:13] so such it's such a marvelous way of
[1:49:16] handling things and the way he talked
[1:49:17] and everything he was such a yielded
[1:49:19] vessel and some tried to worship him
[1:49:21] some baptized in his name you see which
[1:49:24] is very wrong
[1:49:25] there's people tonight that are that are
[1:49:28] burning candles to William branham's
[1:49:30] picture in South America because they're
[1:49:33] Catholic to start with we still got a
[1:49:35] lot of Catholic people here too you see
[1:49:37] and so he reflected Christ in such a way
[1:49:39] or maybe that's him
[1:49:41] no it's not him he's the restoration
[1:49:43] prophet you see are we in hurry no let
[1:49:49] me just drop this in on June the 6th of
[1:49:53] 61 brother Branham had been gone for
[1:49:56] three weeks hunting missionary and up in
[1:49:58] Canada someplace
[1:49:59] anyway comes back and so all the
[1:50:02] pastor's back so everybody's in their
[1:50:03] places you know because when the
[1:50:04] pastor's not here it's time to go do
[1:50:06] things right so when the pastor came
[1:50:08] back everybody's in their places and and
[1:50:10] and so they're all attentive well guess
[1:50:12] what he comes in he preaches on June the
[1:50:15] 6th of 61 and that's when he let the
[1:50:18] bomb drop that there's people he said
[1:50:22] that are that are actually they have a
[1:50:25] card says William Brandon my lord so he
[1:50:28] he got to his attention that they were
[1:50:30] doing these things that they were that
[1:50:32] they were they were worshiping him he
[1:50:34] said this what's wrong you make me
[1:50:35] Antichrist well you went through all
[1:50:37] these details well prior to this Sunday
[1:50:40] Rebecca had plans to go home with some
[1:50:43] of these people because they had some
[1:50:44] kids for age so you know that plan was
[1:50:47] in motion so hey after church she goes
[1:50:49] home with these people and they lived in
[1:50:51] and out in a trailer park and I had to
[1:50:53] inference and exit so she goes home with
[1:50:57] these people and while she's there with
[1:50:58] the kids and everything she's listening
[1:51:00] to the adults well the adults are in the
[1:51:01] other room and they're really speaking
[1:51:04] against what he just said in the service
[1:51:06] that morning
[1:51:06] Wow did you see how how smooth that was
[1:51:09] well he really put those people off now
[1:51:11] we really know that it's him they're
[1:51:13] saying things like that
[1:51:14] and so she was very sensitive so she
[1:51:20] goes to the phone she was about 15 and
[1:51:22] 14 or 15 so she goes to the phone and
[1:51:26] she calls her dad dad you won't believe
[1:51:28] what they're doing over here well of
[1:51:31] course you would and she says they're
[1:51:35] crazy come get me
[1:51:38] and so he said well I'll come get you
[1:51:41] but I can't stop the car because they'll
[1:51:43] want me said that he wants for that
[1:51:45] other entrance and when you see the car
[1:51:46] coming in and you get out in the road
[1:51:48] and I'll slow down and he jump in we'll
[1:51:49] go so she did well so they're leaving
[1:51:53] this place and they're going down the
[1:51:57] road and he says now look I'm glad you
[1:51:59] called me he says one of these days all
[1:52:02] that's gonna look real good to y'all no
[1:52:04] dad no not not me no believe me it's
[1:52:08] gonna look good to you and so he he had
[1:52:10] a way of getting your attention he said
[1:52:12] I see see where we are there was a
[1:52:14] railroad crossing there 100 he said now
[1:52:18] you see this crossing okay I just
[1:52:21] remember I'm telling you today that one
[1:52:23] day it's gonna look good to you but
[1:52:24] don't you ever fall for that nonsense
[1:52:27] so he wasn't leaning towards that but he
[1:52:31] said the truth has a very sharp edge and
[1:52:33] some people on this side some people on
[1:52:35] this side know so just keep the balance
[1:52:42] Jesus Christ as a redeemer William
[1:52:44] Branham is the restoration prophet okay
[1:52:48] so what else we got here okay now when
[1:52:56] Jesus was here he went to a wedding one
[1:52:59] day remember now if you go look he went
[1:53:03] to Cana of Galilee which is little
[1:53:04] village they went over there to this
[1:53:06] wedding now
[1:53:09] Tuesday is the third day see Sunday is
[1:53:12] the first day Monday is second day
[1:53:14] Tuesday is the third day Tuesday is the
[1:53:17] favourite day for Jews to be married
[1:53:20] because in the creation if you read
[1:53:25] Genesis day one created these things
[1:53:28] it's good day to it's good but on day
[1:53:32] three you said it's good twice so they
[1:53:35] grab that day to be the marriage day
[1:53:37] well so when Jesus at this wedding and
[1:53:41] all these people were there and they ran
[1:53:43] out of wine
[1:53:44] remember all it and and they went to
[1:53:47] marry well she can do anything whatever
[1:53:48] he says so they lined up the six big
[1:53:51] pots of water and you know it was wine
[1:53:54] well there was an occasion in the
[1:53:58] Brandon Tabernacle when one of the
[1:54:00] members of the tabernacle who lived next
[1:54:03] door to a mr. Hill the mr. Hill belonged
[1:54:06] to the Church of Christ and so the
[1:54:09] member I don't know what their name was
[1:54:10] was always inviting mr. Hill to come to
[1:54:12] church at the brown tabernacle so one
[1:54:14] day mr. Hill said okay I'll go well I
[1:54:17] happened to be communion sunday so they
[1:54:21] have open community or Christian you've
[1:54:24] received the Lord Jesus then you can
[1:54:26] have the communion it's not closed like
[1:54:27] only us and so the people are standing
[1:54:32] in front of the altar
[1:54:33] there's mr. Hill and then the others and
[1:54:36] mr. Hill heard brother
[1:54:38] Neville say to brother Branham we're out
[1:54:40] of wine what should we do well it's a
[1:54:43] embarrassing situation she ran out of
[1:54:44] wine in the middle of the service you
[1:54:45] know and so brother Brandon says well
[1:54:48] just pray so brother Neville's holding
[1:54:52] the tray with his little cups in it and
[1:54:54] everybody's praying and we got their
[1:54:56] heads down but mr. Hill was the visitor
[1:54:57] so he kept one eye open see what's going
[1:55:01] on here so his testimony was that his
[1:55:05] brother Branham prayed little glasses
[1:55:07] filled up the wine well
[1:55:11] so he couldn't go back to church Christ
[1:55:14] if he had to stay but that was that was
[1:55:19] things like that happened brother
[1:55:21] Brian's life they never said a thing
[1:55:22] about he had such power with God you see
[1:55:25] so I knew him he was very humble man he
[1:55:28] spoke with great authority heaven backed
[1:55:30] up what he said you know and he knew
[1:55:33] where he stood and he reflected the
[1:55:36] glory of God
[1:55:38] he lived what he preached you see so in
[1:55:45] a prophet of God of course is a seer he
[1:55:47] was born a seer you see the scripture
[1:55:50] already had Malachi in their scriptures
[1:55:53] been the scripture forever but when
[1:55:56] brother bran was born he was born a seer
[1:55:59] but he had to come to the place where he
[1:56:01] yielded to the Lord Jesus for all this
[1:56:03] to come into effect
[1:56:04] you see that's what it started happening
[1:56:06] you see so a singer can look over the
[1:56:10] fence and see what's going on in here
[1:56:11] where we can't see but then his
[1:56:14] challenge is and how much of this do I
[1:56:16] tell him and what words do I use see
[1:56:19] that was his challenge and see like with
[1:56:21] Moses God had him write the first five
[1:56:26] books of the Bible in the beginning God
[1:56:30] created the heavens and the earth but
[1:56:32] was William Branham he goes farther back
[1:56:34] that goes back in the mind of God before
[1:56:37] the creation so his words are important
[1:56:43] in the tape this great servant Moses
[1:56:46] brother Brent says as Moses went with
[1:56:48] the judgment stick before him that same
[1:56:50] stick tonight to the church is Jesus
[1:56:52] Christ
[1:56:52] if those Egyptians could ever got that
[1:56:54] little simple stick out of Moses hands
[1:56:56] they would had him quipped and when the
[1:56:59] devil could ever get the deity out of
[1:57:01] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:02] he's got the church quit now that it's
[1:57:06] one of those kind of things it's just
[1:57:07] kind of stuck in there he never says it
[1:57:09] again but guess what there's people
[1:57:11] today people that we know that are
[1:57:13] slowly removing the deity out of Jesus
[1:57:16] Christ out of the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:17] that's what he says
[1:57:18] get the deity out of the name of Jesus
[1:57:20] Christ they're taking the dhih dhih
[1:57:22] attitudes Christ they're putting it over
[1:57:23] here in this organization
[1:57:25] this man in this and that and the church
[1:57:29] is powerless it looks good but it's not
[1:57:31] right you see then he covered it in the
[1:57:36] tape here you him God wants to see the
[1:57:38] reflection of himself and in his church
[1:57:40] reflecting the power and the glory to
[1:57:43] the world that's what we're here for in
[1:57:46] another place he says so when we see
[1:57:48] that our life here is in the negative
[1:57:50] and knowing that we're in the image of
[1:57:52] some life somewhere then we know that
[1:57:55] there's a positive somewhere that the
[1:57:57] light has struck and it's reflected
[1:58:00] something here on the earth and we are
[1:58:02] only that reflection we are only that
[1:58:07] reflection the genuine object is
[1:58:09] somewhere now and for those that you
[1:58:13] know watching date since 1964 thank you
[1:58:15] he says if that isn't that way that I'm
[1:58:19] the worst deceived man in the world I've
[1:58:21] spent my life in vain but I know beyond
[1:58:24] a shadow of a doubt that it's there
[1:58:25] that's why we're here there's a positive
[1:58:28] we're the negative we're going there now
[1:58:33] John chapter 13 says by this shall all
[1:58:36] men this whole city is going to know
[1:58:39] that you belong to Jesus Christ because
[1:58:41] you have a certain picture oh the way
[1:58:44] you love each other the way you treat
[1:58:47] each other that's just their sign you
[1:58:50] see so only a prophet could say this
[1:58:53] listen what he says do you know what God
[1:58:55] did he reached out with his hand and he
[1:58:56] stopped it he's holding time in his hand
[1:58:59] for the church to make itself ready
[1:59:00] there's a few more members yet to come
[1:59:02] in into the body of Christ maybe one of
[1:59:05] them's here today that's why I'm here
[1:59:06] that's why I'm led to be here that's why
[1:59:08] not to persuade you're not saying don't
[1:59:10] be Catholic don't be Memphis no but I
[1:59:12] want you to be filled with his spirit
[1:59:15] just remember I'll meet you at that day
[1:59:17] and these words will be witness against
[1:59:19] you it's all on God's tape-recording and
[1:59:22] with this great picture camera and you
[1:59:24] sitting there and walking away and
[1:59:26] leaving it you'll see your own self at
[1:59:28] that day in the mirror of God that's for
[1:59:32] sure so William Branham lived a balanced
[1:59:35] life okay he reflected the life of Jesus
[1:59:37] Christ
[1:59:38] and you can live a victorious life you
[1:59:42] can reflect Jesus Christ right here in
[1:59:44] the closing hours of lurid Asiya you see
[1:59:46] how by living your message in balance
[1:59:50] all the extremes are dangerous
[1:59:53] we've got people today knowledgeable of
[1:59:56] the message somewhere over here burning
[1:59:58] candles to wean brands picture others
[2:00:00] are saying it's all lies but you got to
[2:00:03] stay in balance you got to know where
[2:00:05] you're at
[2:00:05] it's your choice let's stand together
[2:00:12] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[2:00:14] time together we thank you for the
[2:00:16] attention of your people Lord we just
[2:00:18] thank you that there's people that are
[2:00:20] still interested in the gospel people
[2:00:22] who want to live and reflect your glory
[2:00:24] and father was just glad to be here with
[2:00:26] pray that you'd bless your people give
[2:00:28] us the rest we need or just back at the
[2:00:30] appointed hour and father would just
[2:00:31] thank you for all things help us in
[2:00:34] Jesus name Amen
[2:00:51] amen I have been discouraged from Frank
[2:00:58] preaching after our brother finished
[2:01:04] [Applause]
[2:01:05] I've reached before he came so I'm not
[2:01:10] supposed to preach after he finishes but
[2:01:14] a man is hard to resist that that holy
[2:01:21] temptation amen
[2:01:23] to me a comment and a man I can say this
[2:01:27] that the thing that we are looking for
[2:01:29] the thing that we need to think God
[2:01:31] wants to but and the thing that our
[2:01:34] brothers emphasize tonight is balanced
[2:01:36] by the grace of God because the manna
[2:01:40] what God has done
[2:01:41] withers you where brother's starting the
[2:01:44] Garden of Eden
[2:01:46] the balance was broken between God and
[2:01:48] man song down through outside the garden
[2:01:52] the enemy kept again to attacking and
[2:01:55] breaking the balance he meant keeping us
[2:01:57] religious but we lose the balance and
[2:02:02] the balance is is staying with God in
[2:02:06] and revealing simplicity and if there's
[2:02:09] anything that our brother brought up
[2:02:11] tonight it was that revelation it was
[2:02:14] not in vain it was for a reason that a
[2:02:17] prophet of God preached God hidden and
[2:02:19] revealing simplicity before the opening
[2:02:22] of the seven seals a man and then warned
[2:02:26] us at the end not to try to figure it
[2:02:28] out but to let God do it as our brother
[2:02:32] administer night let God really letting
[2:02:34] their God live it out do you just give
[2:02:36] yourself over to God amen praise the
[2:02:40] Lord that's that's this way to keep the
[2:02:42] balance you got you got to get in the
[2:02:45] spirit of the word and what struck me I
[2:02:48] said he like hey if I can't preach I
[2:02:51] said I just want to comment on this yeah
[2:02:54] I something our brother was sane and
[2:02:56] concerning what happened in the Garden
[2:02:58] of Eden that's good praise the name of
[2:03:01] the Lord oh my god this scene was good
[2:03:05] I'm not talking about that I've gone
[2:03:06] about what happened after after a man
[2:03:09] fell after after they they put
[2:03:12] themselves under Satan's influence amen
[2:03:14] and our brother brought out this this
[2:03:16] this revelation he said the fellowship
[2:03:20] with God was broken but not our
[2:03:25] relationship that's good
[2:03:27] amen and the preaching of the word
[2:03:29] identifies what our relationship with
[2:03:33] God and those who are related to God
[2:03:35] those who are the sons and daughters of
[2:03:38] God those who are the seat of God Amen
[2:03:41] in your life and in your life God by the
[2:03:44] Holy Ghost is going to bring out his DNA
[2:03:47] a man physically we got physically we
[2:03:50] got mom and dad and Grandma and
[2:03:52] Grandpa's DNA but not when you're born
[2:03:55] again
[2:03:57] while the God's DNA takes control amen
[2:04:00] sons and daughters of God that we that
[2:04:03] were with him before the foundation of
[2:04:05] the world within those theophany bodies
[2:04:08] brother an is coming forth that DNA that
[2:04:12] attitude there those actions those
[2:04:14] reactions so it's not like Paul Paul
[2:04:17] when he was born again he dieter to the
[2:04:22] flash and become alive to God he says
[2:04:25] not me that lives now he said as Jesus
[2:04:27] lives in me praise the name of the Lord
[2:04:30] now God's DNA was in control and it was
[2:04:33] God's DNA
[2:04:34] it'll dovetail with this a man and our
[2:04:37] brother is bringing it out here here
[2:04:40] here here little by little to show us
[2:04:42] that that is that is not all you know
[2:04:45] way up there or you know a great big
[2:04:50] doctrine and all of a saint getting some
[2:04:53] getting real deep or real high you would
[2:04:55] cook down run god's level a man say was
[2:04:59] trying to as that's what he did to eat
[2:05:01] and he was trying to make he believed
[2:05:03] that she could go higher he was fighting
[2:05:07] they believed he believed that God would
[2:05:09] God put her to look and her sings that
[2:05:12] he was hiding from you and he and yeah
[2:05:16] yes God said bought but I say unto you
[2:05:19] I'm gonna give you something you know
[2:05:21] and you're gonna feel gonna be as gods
[2:05:23] she was to God a man and her brother
[2:05:27] mentioned had him moving the tree for
[2:05:29] Eve because the prophet of God said all
[2:05:32] he had to do was speak to work a man he
[2:05:35] didn't need an axe he didn't he aged
[2:05:37] groped and do this and do that with her
[2:05:39] to speak the word and it was gonna move
[2:05:41] by the grace of God but again and it's
[2:05:45] getting away from God hidden in
[2:05:46] revealing simplicity so brother what
[2:05:50] Satan did it wasn't keeping us under
[2:05:53] that revelation simplicity of God and
[2:05:56] what God wanted and what God wanted to
[2:05:58] do no no it make life complicated
[2:06:03] and getting more and more complicated in
[2:06:07] this hour that we're living in now god
[2:06:09] help us to live and reflect the life of
[2:06:11] God in and reveal and simplicity amen
[2:06:14] that's good as much be Christians and
[2:06:17] what is a Christian not a churchgoer the
[2:06:20] Christian is the church and a Christian
[2:06:22] is christ-like
[2:06:24] amen let's go ahead and be like Christ
[2:06:27] is not what you wanted to do what does
[2:06:29] Jesus want you to do you're not living
[2:06:31] no more as Christ living in you but the
[2:06:34] enemy is there working on your flesh to
[2:06:36] get you to do what the flesh wants but
[2:06:38] God is on the inside by the only goes to
[2:06:40] get you to do my god wants to reflect
[2:06:43] God his nature is character a man and
[2:06:45] yes brother a man you tired looking into
[2:06:50] the word and so on see yourself in the
[2:06:53] word the word in you look right look
[2:06:55] into the mirror what do you see
[2:06:57] hey man what do you see Paul says look
[2:07:03] into the mirror you look and you walk
[2:07:05] away and forget what you look forget
[2:07:07] what you saw but how can you forget it
[2:07:10] if you're seeing a reflection of Christ
[2:07:13] what who's that I like our brother Mike
[2:07:18] that was here said he he was shocked
[2:07:21] when he looked into the mirror and he
[2:07:24] and he could ruin the world is that old
[2:07:26] man he couldn't believe that was him a
[2:07:30] man but they're looking to the mirror of
[2:07:33] the word and let's see ourselves as the
[2:07:36] sons and daughters of God amen that's
[2:07:40] good
[2:07:41] listen to it again on the DVD
[2:07:48] and don't forget that the fellowship was
[2:07:51] broke broken but not the relationship
[2:07:55] make sure test your relationship with
[2:07:59] this word your relationship will come
[2:08:02] back to the word line up with the word
[2:08:04] and manifest the word unfortunately it
[2:08:09] was broken by sin in the garden and if
[2:08:11] you allow the flesh to interfere it'll
[2:08:13] break your relationship with God but not
[2:08:16] your it'll break your fellowship not
[2:08:19] your relationship that's why the John
[2:08:22] said if we see he said seeing probably
[2:08:27] God said thus in John referred to he
[2:08:30] said it's not going to is not going to
[2:08:32] break your relationship with God he said
[2:08:36] a little interfere with your fellowship
[2:08:38] a man he said you're born again if you
[2:08:43] stumbled and fell and sinned well he
[2:08:45] said though you're a theophany well back
[2:08:47] off and your fellowship is is stopped
[2:08:50] with God but now your repentance will
[2:08:52] restore it amen
[2:08:54] praise the name of the Lord that's good
[2:08:57] I pray God we got the revelation that we
[2:09:03] are the sons and daughters of God that
[2:09:07] we are not Satan Satan seat or serpent
[2:09:10] seat but the seat of God and the true
[2:09:14] seed see themselves yes what our brother
[2:09:17] said the true seed see themselves in the
[2:09:20] mirror of Lord we need to die more to
[2:09:28] ourselves
[2:09:29] die more to the flesh stop listening to
[2:09:32] your mind and let's start listening to
[2:09:34] the voice of God in our souls it's not
[2:09:38] what you want to do what does God wants
[2:09:40] you to do and what God wants you to do
[2:09:43] will be will bring you closer to him and
[2:09:45] reflect him and hide you by the grace of
[2:09:51] God it's got to be for the glory of God
[2:09:53] to the suceed see themselves in the
[2:09:56] mirror of the word good
[2:09:59] and it humbles them praise the Lord
[2:10:07] [Applause]

[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:56] Satan was trying to force him to worship
[2:11:00] idolatry this this something of the
[2:11:04] flesh and word that's the beginning and
[2:11:09] at the end Satan is still trying to get

[2:23:41] when we're doing we would say hey is
[2:23:43] that the will of the Lord yes it was
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:48] it was his flight was delayed maybe for
[2:23:52] a couple of hours because of the falling
[2:23:56] out of facts we maybe we want to blame
[2:24:01] it on the devil and then and the devil
[2:24:03] this devil that and everybody's God's
[2:24:06] timing this guy's planning there was
[2:24:10] God's predestinated will because of what
[2:24:14] he had predestinated to for me to do and
[2:24:17] were for something to happen at the
[2:24:19] airport while I was waiting for our
[2:24:21] brother George
[2:24:23] [Music]
[2:24:24] [Applause]
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:32] I said well I said I'll have to go get
[2:24:34] gay gave myself a lunch I said it's
[2:24:38] going to be another Harold Hamm before
[2:24:39] that flight arrives so I went in and and
[2:24:45] as I was going out to the counter to get
[2:24:47] the lunch there was this gentleman there
[2:24:49] and he was sitting at a table and he had
[2:24:51] a small computer there he was working on
[2:24:53] and he he had a cell phone that he was
[2:24:56] talking to somebody on he was business
[2:25:01] doing his business but he sold me and I
[2:25:06] just passed by and and he saw me in and
[2:25:08] he kept waving for me to come and I just
[2:25:14] I just way back but no he said no and he
[2:25:20] kept you a kept talking so I went over
[2:25:23] and I waited for him to just finish this
[2:25:26] conversation and then he finished it
[2:25:30] within within a couple of minutes and
[2:25:31] and then he turned off his cell phone
[2:25:33] and and laid it down and and later say
[2:25:36] his computer aside
[2:25:38] [Applause]
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:40] he sees your pasture lush I see yes I
[2:25:44] said but who are you
[2:25:48] don't know me no he's I was in your home
[2:25:53] I said I don't remember he said when he
[2:26:01] was in 1997
[2:26:03] [Music]
[2:26:05] I said what yes
[2:26:09] he said I was looking for a Christian
[2:26:11] confident to do some work and for some
[2:26:18] reason I he got connected to us anyway
[2:26:21] when David was through I think maybe the
[2:26:24] the church where we were worshiping at
[2:26:27] the time and I said well I don't
[2:26:32] recognize you but I said maybe your name
[2:26:39] this is what God's looking for the name
[2:26:44] for some of you that may recognize the
[2:26:46] name and it was Chris Walsh and he's got
[2:26:52] a contracting business and he knew by
[2:26:57] the message we talked about the Lord we
[2:27:01] talked about the condition of the age
[2:27:03] the end of time he said I listen to
[2:27:06] brother Branham he said every week I
[2:27:10] said what yes he said and he took his
[2:27:14] computer and he and he moved it over and
[2:27:16] he showed me where were you it all he
[2:27:19] had to do was just click on this and all
[2:27:21] the sermons our brother man was listed
[2:27:24] yes he said I'm listening to a brother
[2:27:27] man Ami's and every week and he said
[2:27:28] what he's saying it's the truth so I
[2:27:33] believe that's why God delayed our
[2:27:35] brothers coming maybe we look at our
[2:27:38] watch and say I wish early I'm coming
[2:27:41] because because we got to go on to Grand
[2:27:42] Falls Lord well you know why are you
[2:27:46] allowing this we can look back and see
