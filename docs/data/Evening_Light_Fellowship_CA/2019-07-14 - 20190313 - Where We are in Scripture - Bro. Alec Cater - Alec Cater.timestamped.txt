[0:01] Emily and things like that you know it's
[0:03] I forgot that thought that I was going
[0:07] to bring out a man but when it comes to
[0:12] a family there's sometimes they don't
[0:14] recall you know the relationship between
[0:16] family and but it's just there's a
[0:20] relationship there we got this in common
[0:22] we're just cousins or whatever but it's
[0:25] a relationship and it ought to bind us
[0:27] together by the grace of God you know
[0:30] that's in the natural I'm much more in
[0:33] the spiritual a man that I got my memory
[0:37] back oh yes my cousin that did go
[0:40] he nearing the end of his journey right
[0:44] committees his soul into the hands of
[0:46] God but nearing the end of his journey
[0:48] that he didn't know those around him he
[0:54] didn't know where he was he didn't know
[0:57] when it comes to naturally speaking
[1:00] where he was going or where he come from
[1:02] because he was just out of it his mine
[1:06] and you know sin did that to you and me
[1:10] spiritually but God came by the Holy
[1:13] Ghost with the blood of Jesus a man to
[1:16] give us back our memories so that now
[1:19] now we know him and he know a well he
[1:23] know who knew us and he out but now we
[1:25] know him now he's our Father by the
[1:28] grace of God amen
[1:30] so he came and revealed himself to us as
[1:33] our Lord and Savior to take us back home
[1:37] so brother sister well like I say I've
[1:41] got it typed and and I got his stuff
[1:45] here in my Bible where I said some call
[1:48] it heaven but I call it home and that is
[1:52] the truth
[1:53] you know there's a lot of people there
[1:56] when did they feel in religion when I
[1:57] die I'm going to heaven I'm going to
[1:59] heaven
[2:00] yeah but for the elect we're going to
[2:02] we're going home if we're the sons and
[2:05] daughters of God we're going home
[2:07] by the grace of God event because that's
[2:10] where we come from and that's where
[2:12] we're going
[2:12] a man so thank God for that revelation
[2:15] as the wisdom of God but it says get
[2:19] wisdom but get understanding you can
[2:23] know a lot about God but how much do you
[2:24] understand about God
[2:26] do you understand he's your father a man
[2:28] do you understand that those with you
[2:30] are your brothers and sisters because
[2:33] we're all the sons and daughters of God
[2:35] so they're your brothers and sisters in
[2:37] Christ a man and that's why there's a
[2:40] greater relationship with your spiritual
[2:42] family than it is with your natural
[2:44] family a man and we know that there was
[2:48] problems with that when it comes to
[2:49] brother Branham and his natural family
[2:51] because they admitted that they they
[2:54] were jealous they did yeah one of his
[2:58] children said well we got we were
[2:59] jealous he said because dad was giving
[3:02] more attention to the to the Christians
[3:05] and those that he was ministry to than
[3:07] he was to his natural family and so on
[3:09] so the only way that they could enter
[3:11] into a full relationship with whether
[3:13] Randall was to stay under the word and
[3:16] be faithful a man so I pray the grace of
[3:19] God god help us to have the wisdom of
[3:21] god but God help us to have the
[3:23] understanding of the Holy Ghost
[3:25] he says the old egos the life of the
[3:27] blood to give us understanding amen
[3:30] there is the knowledge of God there is a
[3:32] wisdom of God
[3:33] but again salvation Latian the
[3:36] understanding amen and we act according
[3:39] to our understanding by the grace of God
[3:42] it says take fire soul of instruction
[3:45] that are not go keeper for she is the
[3:48] life amen grace of God that we're going
[3:52] to take the instructions of the words
[3:54] through our brother Alec tonight thank
[3:56] God for sin it's amazing grace
[3:58] I would sweep this out amen as brother
[4:02] Bob is the daughter Sara sings the song
[4:04] that amazing is the only word that
[4:07] explains grace amen
[4:09] it is amazing grace they met because we
[4:13] knew each other so for me I'm and my
[4:15] brother Alec we knew each other
[4:17] 50 years ago but the
[4:21] we became strangers but then goddess God
[4:25] renewed the fellowship thank the Lord
[4:27] amen so I appreciate that and we thank
[4:30] the Lord for bringing our brother to
[4:32] fellowship with us and we pray in the
[4:35] grace of God that he will minister to us
[4:38] tonight
[4:38] the Holy Ghost will minister through our
[4:40] brother a man and and give us not just
[4:43] the wisdom of God but the understanding
[4:45] of God a man that will get what God
[4:48] wants us to get we'll catch what God
[4:51] wants us to catch
[4:52] we'll see what God wants us to see a man
[4:55] by understanding amen the grace of God
[4:59] there are those that have wisdom but no
[5:01] understanding that's the truth I went to
[5:04] school and one time and then thank God
[5:07] for understanding and be even back then
[5:10] as a teenager there were those in in my
[5:13] class all mine and they said oh what are
[5:17] they like I saw they're smart I said
[5:19] they got a lot of wisdom and they can do
[5:22] this do this that they can they can get
[5:25] a hundred percent I said on their exams
[5:27] and I said I'll only get in the 50s or
[5:29] 60s he said I said on my exams but I
[5:33] said them I said they wouldn't had the
[5:35] sense to boil a kettle you know and they
[5:38] said what I said no I said they know of
[5:41] this they know this they know that but
[5:43] when it comes to the basics the
[5:44] simplicity of life I said they don't
[5:46] have no revelation and that is the truth
[5:49] it's like I said about the girl one time
[5:50] that in from my own town I knew her and
[5:54] I think she said their living area st.
[5:57] John's now and as many years ago they're
[5:59] with the University and she come over
[6:01] from University and her mother said
[6:03] you'll have to help me to get supper and
[6:05] she said why would you want me to do
[6:07] what she said I want you I want you she
[6:10] said to get some bolon already she said
[6:12] in the fighting pan and so on oh she
[6:16] said how do I do that she's just she
[6:20] going to university amen and she was
[6:23] taking a break from university but
[6:25] didn't know how to fry Bellona a man it
[6:28] shocked her mother and she said you
[6:31] don't know no
[6:33] she said me why because she wants to
[6:35] taught that in university but it's
[6:38] common sense a man
[6:40] so it's the same thing in the in school
[6:43] that I went to in the high school there
[6:44] were many there oh they could get up to
[6:48] a hundred percent and their exams but
[6:50] couldn't do anything simple a man and I
[6:54] said well it's someone did after you one
[6:56] thing what's the problem I said you get
[6:58] I said they got wisdom but no
[7:00] understanding and I said they they need
[7:02] understanding so God help us is my
[7:05] prayer and God give us understanding
[7:07] through the going forth of the word and
[7:09] by the Holy Ghost about praising God law
[7:12] God's going to anoint anoint our brother
[7:14] Alec and they're going further the word
[7:16] and he anoint us in the receiving of the
[7:18] word a man and one you know how the Holy
[7:21] Ghost is is so it's the life of the
[7:23] blood of Jesus a man not many realize
[7:27] that not many know that they think it's
[7:30] different no no it's not different
[7:31] remember the blood of the natural lamb
[7:33] couldn't come back to you and me because
[7:35] it was an animal were humans but he came
[7:38] down in flesh in sinless blood a man you
[7:41] sinless human blood so that the life
[7:44] could come back to you and me that's the
[7:47] Holy Ghost thank God
[7:48] why because the price for sin was paid
[7:50] and you're amazing we mentioned it today
[7:54] in prayer and we're talking to the Lord
[7:55] but what's Lord this is amazing that you
[7:58] took our sin and you put it in the sea
[8:01] of forgetfulness I said this is amazing
[8:04] grace that would do such as they
[8:08] forgetfulness that no man can lay a
[8:11] charge against God's elect a man God
[8:13] doesn't see it any man oh this is true
[8:16] that's grace thank God for grace so
[8:19] let's pray the grace of God to our
[8:21] brother Alec as he comes but brother's
[8:23] sister again let's pray the grace of God

[10:06] [Music]
[10:09] s really Jesus
[10:16] [Music]
[11:08] we know Jesus is here because he's in
[11:11] these work he's here because he said
[11:15] we're tours here gathered even unto the
[11:20] end so I'm so thankful for that tonight
[11:23] I trust you prayed for me when brother
[11:28] journal contacted me today to let me
[11:31] know I was gone a little bit surprised
[11:34] because I thought it would be on a
[11:36] Sunday but I thought brother mark would
[11:38] be ministering tonight but it seems like
[11:42] it's following my heart but that's okay
[11:45] the Lord knows what he's doing we have
[11:48] to come with confidence amen confidence
[11:51] in him in his word and he's leading his
[11:54] flock
[11:54] praise the Lord was a wonderful spirit
[11:57] here tonight into worship I was really
[11:58] blessed when I was in the room I was
[12:00] just worshiping the Lord it's such a
[12:03] wonderful spirit you know I think this
[12:05] this assembly here is probably one of
[12:07] the best worship assemblies in the whole
[12:09] message I really special anointing cease
[12:13] to be under on this assembly when it
[12:15] comes to worshiping galore that's
[12:17] something you should be thankful for my
[12:20] trust a night that you came with joy in
[12:22] your heart and you know came expecting
[12:26] and didn't come to hear me because
[12:28] you'll be disappointed if you hear me
[12:30] but if you came and just hear the word
[12:33] hear what God has for us and feed your
[12:38] soul about it and I believe you'll be
[12:39] blessed I believe God has God has laid a
[12:42] little message on my heart tonight for
[12:44] you a one talk about the body change and
[12:46] it's a continuation from what but other
[12:49] journals been preaching on the rapture
[12:51] because this is the hour for we're
[12:54] living in a tremendous time brother and
[12:56] sister a tremendous hour when the
[13:00] revelation of the word is going forth
[13:02] and the bride Paul called it the
[13:05] dispensation of the fullness of times
[13:07] all right
[13:08] hey man this is the is the age that
[13:10] we've come to this is the hour so but
[13:14] you know sad to say maybe around the
[13:17] message they're missing what God is
[13:18] doing as brother journal said why does
[13:20] God doing now weathers are calling an
[13:22] election but we are called to bring a
[13:25] body change we are called to bring bring
[13:28] the dead from the grave you think about
[13:31] that and it is just tremendous but God
[13:34] has given us God has given us everything
[13:36] we need to do that in this message and
[13:40] we're living under the seventh seal the
[13:42] opening of the word we're living in the
[13:45] time of the Son of Man be revealed and
[13:49] he's open that word for a reason for us
[13:52] to bring us to a place perfection yes
[13:55] more that they had in any other age so
[13:58] by God's grace we'll just go down
[14:02] tonight I want to go for the lab news of
[14:05] faith and how do we bring forth a man we
[14:09] got to have the faith that Enoch had and
[14:12] Enoch walked with God so there is a walk
[14:16] we got to find it Enoch swap and I
[14:18] believe he not swap also a walk of faith
[14:21] as we read in Hebrews 11 and he held a
[14:24] testimony to please God amen
[14:28] so I believe the broad will have that
[14:29] same faith a man rapturing faith praise
[14:33] the Lord Amen so brother Branham said
[14:37] and I was thinking about this today that
[14:40] we have the perfect interpretation of
[14:43] the word with divine vindication just
[14:46] think about how blessed bride should be
[14:48] you know because all tables are full of
[14:50] vomit outside this right there on the
[14:53] regurgitating food of another generation
[14:56] another age contest yeah it's not fifty
[14:59] eat to the bride see the Eagles got to
[15:02] have the fresh-killed word
[15:04] and we've got to be careful in this
[15:06] message that we don't feed on something
[15:08] that is not for us or we'll get very
[15:11] sick God has provided everything we need
[15:14] we Jesus has a table spread where the
[15:17] saints of God her faith brother Brown
[15:19] called it the seven-course meal amen so
[15:23] we're gonna be feeding on some of that
[15:25] tonight I told brother Bob when he came
[15:27] in there I had about ten different
[15:29] thoughts messages I could have
[15:32] approached but and I was trying to find
[15:34] the leadership of the Lord today and you
[15:38] know we can preach on the light we can
[15:41] preach on Son of Man we can preach on
[15:44] the wall we can preach on so many
[15:46] different subjects as the table is
[15:48] completely full and around the world
[15:50] some of the brothers are preaching some
[15:52] tremendous messages I know some of you
[15:55] brothers have been keyed into some of
[15:57] them and boys that ever bring you faith
[15:58] in our hearts so I trust the night that
[16:01] you know when you leave here tonight
[16:03] you'll be more built up in the faith
[16:06] than you were when you came my brother
[16:08] Brandon said every time you come to the
[16:09] house of the Lord you should blow the
[16:11] better person and the more a better
[16:13] Christian more faith muscles as it were
[16:16] you know praise the Lord so don't look
[16:19] at me look at the word Amen praise Lord
[16:22] Amen so let's all stand for the reading
[16:27] of the word and maybe we'll begin in 2nd
[16:34] Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 familiar
[16:43] Scripture 2nd Timothy 3
[16:50] all Scripture is given by inspiration of
[16:53] God and is profitable for doctrine for
[16:57] reproof for correction for instruction
[17:01] in righteousness that the man of God may
[17:04] be perfect thoroughly furnished
[17:08] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[17:11] amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[17:15] you tonight Lord for this privilege we
[17:19] have a game father too coming to your
[17:21] house of prayer to give you thanks for
[17:23] all they do done for us father to be
[17:27] identified with the gospel in this our
[17:30] Lord that you have sent to know Lord
[17:33] that you call us out of darkness into
[17:34] light and to think Lord so many today
[17:39] Lord that they've turned away from the
[17:42] walk of faith Lord but you kept us by
[17:45] your grace Lord Oh father help us to
[17:48] appreciate it tonight I pray so many are
[17:53] maybe in churches tonight Lord in the
[17:55] realm of Christendom worship you in vain
[17:58] Lord for you said they that worship me
[18:01] must worship me in spirit and in truth
[18:04] father that's why we're here Lord look
[18:08] into our hearts tonight father take away
[18:11] anything Lord that would hinder the
[18:12] moving of your spirit father just
[18:15] breathe upon that word tonight I pray
[18:17] bless each brother and sister from the
[18:20] youngest to the oldest Lord we mother
[18:21] draw closer to you lord we know father
[18:25] the dating Christ are waiting on us as
[18:27] her brother journal has preached many
[18:29] times Lord father so help us Lord to
[18:32] draw closer Lord to lift up higher in
[18:35] heavenly places to sign father we're
[18:39] here to do your bidding Lord we ask
[18:42] these things in Jesus name a man may be
[18:45] seated
[18:47] praise the Lord
[18:51] let's turn to another scripture shall we
[18:53] you second Corinthians chapter 4
[19:05] and let's read verse six say ingredients
[19:10] for and verse six for God who commanded
[19:14] the light to shine out of darkness has
[19:17] shined in our hearts to give the light
[19:20] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[19:24] the face of Jesus Christ there's a
[19:27] tremendous scripture let's this go now
[19:30] to second Corinthians three in verse
[19:33] eighteen to tie this in together
[19:36] you see God speaks to us brother Branham
[19:40] said this Bible is a love letter to the
[19:42] bride you know many people can read it
[19:45] and think they know it but God's got to
[19:47] reveal it and brother Graham said you
[19:50] know he talked about how he my sister
[19:52] Brandon with great letters when he gives
[19:54] away and how he would read the letter
[19:57] and he'd read between the lines and he
[19:59] said that's what that's the way the Lord
[20:01] is with his bride and this Bible we this
[20:05] is his love letter to the bride and we
[20:07] have to read bethought between the lines
[20:09] to get the meaning in the understanding
[20:11] what he's trying to tell us
[20:14] 2nd Corinthians 3 and 18 but we are with
[20:17] open face beholding as in the glass the
[20:22] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[20:25] same image from glory to glory even as
[20:29] by the Spirit of the Lord and one more
[20:37] Philippians 3 and 21
[20:53] while this relates now to our team on
[20:57] body change well let's read verse 20 for
[21:02] our conversation or our citizenship is
[21:04] in heaven from whence also we look for
[21:08] the Saviour Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[21:11] change our vile body that it may be
[21:14] fashioned like unto his glorious body
[21:16] according to the working whereby he is
[21:20] able even to subdue all things unto
[21:23] himself
[21:24] praise the Lord so brother and sister
[21:30] both of 0 has been ministering for a
[21:33] couple of months now on the rapture and
[21:38] I'm going to probably hit some
[21:42] scriptures that he's he's already gone
[21:47] through but that's alright it's good to
[21:49] go over them again and I may just have a
[21:52] few more little things to it to add to
[21:54] it but I trust you know because we're
[21:57] just coming from that team will stay
[21:59] with that for now maybe we'll put on the
[22:05] slide first slide there brother
[22:08] and we start here the coming of the Lord
[22:17] we know that the promise that they were
[22:21] looking for for the coming of the Lord
[22:23] you know was look tore through seven
[22:25] ages but it has happened here in our
[22:28] generation that has happened here in the
[22:31] end time or revelation 10 says what
[22:35] tenem one says I saw another mighty
[22:37] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[22:39] a cloud this has been fulfilled you see
[22:42] it in the photo there 1963 and you can
[22:45] you tie these scriptures together
[22:46] Matthew 24 30s you can see it all up
[22:50] there then shall appear the sign of the
[22:52] Son of man in heaven jesus said and they
[22:55] shall see the Son of man coming in the
[22:57] clouds of heaven
[22:58] now scripture is compound meaning but
[23:01] for us who are going to be changed this
[23:05] is already
[23:07] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[23:10] eye shall see him revelation 1:7 every
[23:14] spiritual eye of the elect are going to
[23:17] see him who he is and see him in his
[23:19] word but some day he'll come to Israel
[23:22] and every spiritual I'd ever see him but
[23:25] this is fulfilled for us see Scripture
[23:28] is compound meaning and we don't want we
[23:32] don't want to miss our college and our
[23:34] our the portion is for us okay let's go
[23:38] to the next slide all right so the Bride
[24:00] of Christ who are we
[24:02] we're creatures of eternity caught in
[24:05] the time element that's who we are
[24:08] that's what the scripture tells us who
[24:10] we are
[24:11] so you think about that I've got the
[24:13] little licks of fire here to show you
[24:15] I'll try to get some little diagrams
[24:17] here to make it more you know a little
[24:21] better but so here we are down here
[24:23] worshiping and we're creatures of
[24:25] eternity kind of a time element yes okay
[24:33] so this little diagram here just to show
[24:36] where we are from the Ministry of Jesus
[24:40] of course there was the early church
[24:42] Peter and the Apostles then Paul in
[24:44] Ephesus Smyrna so on and so forth right
[24:48] up to the latest thing in age and this
[24:50] is where the Prophet came on the scene
[24:52] so we know all that and here to show it
[24:54] again an important thing to understand
[24:57] this the messenger comes at the end of
[24:59] the age so the bride age comes at the
[25:03] end of the latest C&H sea so we're just
[25:07] places all in perspective there now
[25:09] we're we're getting there so there was a
[25:11] dispensational change in 1963 with the
[25:15] cloud came and the seals rope and now
[25:17] you have to understand this we're still
[25:19] in later to see
[25:20] as you can see on the bottom there and
[25:21] the Pentecostal age basically from 1906
[25:25] up to around 1963 when the cloud came
[25:29] Dan brother branham said he began to
[25:32] talk about the bride age because up to
[25:34] that point he didn't just didn't mention
[25:36] that actually was very late in his in
[25:39] his ministry that he began to refer to
[25:41] the bride age and they began to say I
[25:43] don't call you church I call you abroad
[25:45] he was making the distinction here so we
[25:48] have to come to that from 1963 on every
[25:52] message brother Brennan began to preach
[25:54] that some people think that when brother
[25:56] Branham preached the seals in March of
[25:58] 1963 that was it you know we read the
[26:00] seals oh that was it no that wasn't it
[26:03] the seals revealed and confirmed the
[26:06] things that he preached in the church
[26:07] ages but when he came to the seventh
[26:10] seal he he was very people were
[26:14] expecting something but he and they went
[26:17] have probably disappointed but it wasn't
[26:19] for everybody it's only to the elect and
[26:22] then when you begin to follow the
[26:24] prophets message and I would encourage
[26:26] you to read all his messages are what we
[26:30] call main messages because he did preach
[26:33] if angelically outside of the tabernacle
[26:36] and breath in in jeffersonville but you
[26:39] know all these messages were for too
[26:41] late and there to bring us rapturing
[26:44] faith see paul said their glory were
[26:48] changed from glory to glory so brother
[26:51] banner put it this way he said it'll be
[26:53] word upon word about word I'm under seed
[26:56] this in your heart that's going to bring
[26:57] that change to your body
[27:00] that's amazing bonuses how many people
[27:03] in the world have made notice but God
[27:05] has given us this hidden manna you see
[27:09] for outside of that the time would come
[27:13] it says in the word in Hosea when they
[27:15] would come a famine for the hearing of
[27:17] the word see but we would we would hear
[27:23] because God has an elected purpose for
[27:26] our lives and our calling the election
[27:28] as I said is to bring on that that
[27:30] resurrection
[27:31] man let's go to the next one so the body
[27:34] changed will come at the end of the
[27:36] bride age are calling in the bride age
[27:39] is to bring on the rapture and body
[27:41] change and translation of the endtime
[27:44] bride to finish up the Gentile
[27:46] dispensation of grace they were at the
[27:49] very end there's no eighth Church age
[27:52] and so we know when we when the
[27:54] resurrection takes place and our bodies
[27:56] are changed we're cut away to be with
[27:59] the Lord then that's when tribulation
[28:01] will sit in that's when the gospel will
[28:04] go back to the Jews and Moses and Elijah
[28:07] the two witnesses will rise up on the
[28:10] scene over there
[28:11] I trust you understand all those things
[28:16] okay so the Bride of Christ or creatures
[28:19] of eternity and we're caught in a time
[28:22] element now that's turning the
[28:23] scriptures and let's go a little further
[28:25] into this see if we can enhance our
[28:28] understanding a little bit word is good
[28:33] isn't it it's just such a wonderful
[28:36] thing I get so blessed when I'm reading
[28:38] the word you know I trust you read your
[28:41] Bible every day brother and sister I
[28:43] trust you pray read your Bible because
[28:46] you know that's brother and saver they
[28:48] asked him how do I stay close to God he
[28:50] said read your Bibles and pray that
[28:51] sounds so simple but God is hidden in
[28:53] simplicity that's the way the Lord does
[28:55] that you see amen John 14 let's let's
[29:00] turn John 14 verse one brother journals
[29:02] register for well I'm just gonna go a
[29:05] little further with you dear let not
[29:06] your heart be troubled you believe in
[29:09] God believe also in me and my father's
[29:11] house are many mansions if it were not
[29:14] so I would have told you I go to prepare
[29:18] a place for you and if I go and prepare
[29:21] a place for you I will come again and
[29:24] receive you unto myself that where I am
[29:28] there you may be also so you see the
[29:32] first slide of shoulders - coming to the
[29:34] Lord and Jesus is saying I'm coming
[29:36] again I will come again I go to prepare
[29:39] a place for you now
[29:43] brother branham's tied this person
[29:47] scripture into the death burial and
[29:50] resurrection of Jesus because we know
[29:53] that he ascended on high you remember
[29:57] when he rose the first day Mary
[29:59] Magdalene was the first to see him and
[30:02] he said touch me not
[30:04] I have not ascended to my father so
[30:07] Jesus had to go to prepare a way for us
[30:10] he had to go and bring the blood to the
[30:12] mercy seat you see because but Adam had
[30:15] done in the garden when he had seen he
[30:18] had separated fellowship no one could
[30:22] approach unto God and to it that holy
[30:24] God so that until that perfect sacrifice
[30:26] came in Christ and brought that blood
[30:29] here is the proof he's purchased so yeah
[30:32] that's how he prepared the way to get us
[30:34] back to God see he's not up there
[30:37] brother Graham said building houses and
[30:39] so huh you know like so on and actually
[30:42] the Old English witness says in my
[30:44] father's house it was like the House of
[30:47] Tudor or the House of Windsor
[30:48] it was the domain like Kings would have
[30:52] a domain you see that's me sounded and
[30:54] many mansions are you and me
[30:57] you see Hebrews 9 to 24 says Christ
[31:02] enter once entered into heaven itself -
[31:07] now to appear in the presence of God for
[31:09] us that's how he made that way for us
[31:13] amen he was the firstfruits of them that
[31:16] slept see that's how we would know the
[31:18] way he would be the first to go there
[31:20] and because he has he has preeminence in
[31:23] all things and but bringing that atoning
[31:27] blood to God on our behalf to satisfy
[31:30] the requirement of sin in order to
[31:33] restore our fellowship with God again
[31:34] and reclaim that book of redemption
[31:37] which Adam had Warfighter amen
[31:40] praise the Lord so when my father's
[31:43] Kingdom are many dwelling places or
[31:46] places of abode
[31:51] where was that when I laid the
[31:53] foundations of the earth God asked Joel
[31:56] the terephthalic a sunder standing verse
[32:02] 7 of chapter 38 when the morning stars
[32:06] sang together and all the sons of God
[32:09] shouted for joy a man it's nice to see
[32:13] yourself in the world isn't it
[32:14] I see brother Chad dear they shouted for
[32:18] joy
[32:18] I see brother Paul I trust I see you all
[32:21] a man we should all rejoice amen
[32:25] praise the Lord is great to see yourself
[32:26] through the word brother chant amen
[32:28] praise the Lord brother a man that's why
[32:31] I was shouting rejoicing tonight I guess
[32:33] we just feel the blessings of Lord
[32:35] Ephesian wants as according as he had
[32:37] chosen us in him before the foundation
[32:39] of the world that we should be wholly
[32:42] without blame before him love so Paul is
[32:46] showing the same thing that job has been
[32:48] asked by God here where were you before
[32:50] I laid the foundations of euros a good
[32:52] question but see if you're a part of God
[32:55] brother branham said you always were
[32:56] we've talked you sure you got the
[32:59] eternal life now you always had eternal
[33:01] life praise the Lord so you know it says
[33:04] there that they sang and shouted now you
[33:08] say well that was in the mind of God was
[33:10] it or did they have some kind of body
[33:12] that they sing it and show these are
[33:18] things brother the Bride of Christ has
[33:20] got to get into the heart now so let's
[33:23] look at who are we anyway
[33:25] well events that were trying be mean up
[33:28] a body spirit and soul this is
[33:29] confirming Scripture 1st Thessalonians 5
[33:32] he says Paul said I pray that God that
[33:35] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[33:37] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[33:40] the Lord Jesus Christ so there's the
[33:42] confirmation of the triune being and
[33:45] these are basic things I guess everybody
[33:47] has been thought in the message pretty
[33:50] well but the body we know is Jews for
[33:53] feel see hear taste and smelled I said
[33:57] we can't that's what we use for
[33:58] everybody's contact in our spirit realm
[34:00] brother branham does the way he laid it
[34:03] out and I just put it your way he says
[34:04] it conscience reason affection the
[34:07] imagination and memory the five outlets
[34:10] for the spirit but in the soul and I
[34:13] believe brother Gerald mentioned just
[34:15] last Sunday or Sunday before and
[34:17] disorders other faiths or doe yeah let's
[34:21] go a little deeper into this now oh
[34:24] brother sister the Bride of Christ has
[34:27] been taught these things were a reason
[34:28] to bring us to perfection we have to
[34:32] understand these things so we don't be
[34:33] deceived we should be thankful to the
[34:36] Lord that he sent us a prophet but don't
[34:38] say it the Lord so our body can contact
[34:42] our earthly home my brother band said
[34:45] our body was put together around really
[34:47] because of sin he winced it went through
[34:50] Satan's perversion that's right that's
[34:52] where it was perverting the beginning
[34:53] and his subject to sin and death is only
[34:56] temporal you know it's all gonna dog
[34:58] we're all aging and so on it's in the
[35:01] time element and it's in the realm of
[35:04] the scene in spirit in our spirits we
[35:08] can be anointed by God
[35:09] or we can be anointed by Satan there's
[35:13] figlio love in our spirit that's like
[35:16] human affection and so on like we're Eva
[35:18] and it's in the realm of beyond seeing
[35:20] as well because we can't see your spirit
[35:22] but we manifest sometimes what our
[35:24] spirit let our spirits are experiencing
[35:27] but now in the soul this is where
[35:30] predestinated G seen of God is placed by
[35:33] the man said and you can reject the word
[35:36] and if you do your non-si well the brand
[35:39] said you go give him a word they keep
[35:41] tearing down he's dead go back go back
[35:44] this is where the agape he'd obvious as
[35:47] opposed to figlio love figlio love this
[35:50] heart and a lot of people worship God in
[35:54] a fear they love Jesus you know they've
[35:56] got an imagination that this man with a
[35:58] long robe on and sandals o my Savior
[36:01] he's so good he forgives me but if you
[36:04] give him a word I don't believe that I
[36:06] don't have to get baptized I don't you
[36:09] see that's they're rejecting the word
[36:11] but the agapo love of God is corrective
[36:14] law brother Branham said like little
[36:17] Johnny that goes out into the street you
[36:20] know fill your low sister little Johnny
[36:22] you know corrective lobsters Johnny get
[36:25] back here
[36:26] get off that Street because he doesn't
[36:29] want Johnny to be killed and that's the
[36:31] way God is what else he has to correct
[36:33] us all said any man that don't take
[36:36] correction he's uh he's not genuine you
[36:39] know jail time so you know we can be
[36:43] even in our worship worshipping God and
[36:45] praising God like many Pentecostal
[36:47] groups evangelical groups do but if we
[36:50] don't have the C gene in here that's
[36:55] what we got to be careful of even in
[36:56] this message we've got to be careful now
[36:58] you know don't misunderstand me we love
[37:00] the worship the Lord I love the worship
[37:02] Lord much as anybody but but I always
[37:06] remember the final test is do they
[37:09] receive the word that they believe the
[37:10] word it's in the realm of the unseen
[37:14] it's eternal the soul is there's no time
[37:17] element and his subject things above and
[37:20] that's where our walk we did not we'll
[37:25] get to that may be another message but
[37:27] things above we set your affections on
[37:29] things above not on things on the earth
[37:32] and a context the sixth dimension you
[37:36] remember brother Brown and went beyond
[37:37] the curtain of time amen he sold after
[37:40] his body he looked back on the bed he
[37:42] sigh sigh self laying in the bed and he
[37:45] went beyond the curtain of time amen
[37:48] there was another body
[37:50] so Genesis born we see the body that the
[37:57] distinction here I just thought I'd
[37:58] mentioned this and so God created man in
[38:01] his own image in the image of God
[38:03] created he him male and female created
[38:06] he them now we see in this white
[38:08] depiction here this is let's say it's
[38:11] the Genesis 1:27 man later on God puts
[38:15] Adam in to an earthly man and the Lord
[38:17] God formed man of the dust of the ground
[38:19] and breathed into his nostrils the
[38:21] breath of life man became a living soul
[38:24] before his soul
[38:25] was in the sea awfully now he comes over
[38:27] to this earth and body and the Lord God
[38:30] planted the garden eastward meeting then
[38:32] he put the man whom he had formed boban
[38:36] said Adam would not have sinned in this
[38:38] body over here Genesis 1 but once he
[38:42] went into a body of flesh you see he was
[38:45] subject in let's go a little deeper on
[38:49] this now so the gene seat of God this is
[38:52] the real you
[38:53] that's why the sons of God shouted for
[38:56] joy it's a heavenly theophany it's
[38:59] perfect
[39:00] it's immortal this river it's sinless
[39:03] you spot a bird and you written in the
[39:06] Lamb's Book of Life it possesses Zoe
[39:10] like for God's own life and it's too
[39:12] real you well I said we know where we
[39:16] come from we know where we're going
[39:17] praise the Lord but the earthly man he's
[39:21] earthly he's flesh not put together
[39:23] right he's imperfect he's mortal he's
[39:26] born in sin he loves the things of the
[39:28] world that's your nature you're born in
[39:30] sins come to rural speaking life he all
[39:33] his acts are written in the book of life
[39:35] everything you do some men's sins go
[39:37] before them others follow after to judge
[39:39] me see
[39:41] hey they need new birth and it's a
[39:44] negative view so so that's the
[39:47] distinction that we make there amen
[39:50] praise the Lord
[39:52] now I just put this little one in here
[39:54] does God always types down through
[39:57] scripture see the triune Man and in the
[40:00] tabernacle there was the outer court
[40:02] it's like the body there was the inner
[40:03] court or the Holy Place that's like the
[40:05] spirit and on the inside to do the
[40:07] inside is beyond the veil there's where
[40:10] the soul is that's why we got to get
[40:12] beyond our flesh and our spirit get into
[40:16] when the Holy Spirit comes in we are
[40:19] born again is two quickening the Holy
[40:21] Spirit on that gene seed that's in your
[40:23] soul that brings it to the new birth
[40:25] amen so I just showed that you know
[40:28] scripture see God's pattern as brother
[40:31] Joe said God doesn't change his pattern
[40:32] this pattern is playing on these purpose
[40:35] so the pattern that he showed in the
[40:37] traffic
[40:37] because we are Tabernacles every night
[40:41] so we know of this earthly House of this
[40:43] Tabernacle will dissolved we have a
[40:46] building of God a house not made with
[40:49] hands eternal in the heavens
[40:52] anything this eternal brother man said
[40:55] had no beginning
[40:56] there's got no answer praise the Lord
[40:59] so when this earthly Tabernacle this old
[41:02] body man flesh dies amen we go to we go
[41:07] into our theophany praise the name of
[41:09] the Lord Nestor okay
[41:10] the prophet went beyond the curtain of
[41:12] time brother what excuse are they going
[41:13] to give on the day of judgment all that
[41:16] God has done for us and showed to us yea
[41:19] and told us and we're going to reject
[41:22] that I mean we've got no excuse it's
[41:25] like the spies that came back with the
[41:26] evidence you see they brought back the
[41:29] brother Brendan came back and he said
[41:30] whatever you do don't miss it he said
[41:33] words can't explain how glorious it is
[41:35] you know here we are these old shriveled
[41:39] up bodies getting old with aches and
[41:40] pains and sickness why what God has well
[41:44] the scripture says man has not seen or
[41:46] heard the things that God has for them
[41:48] that love him amen now who we are we
[41:57] were with God before the foundation
[41:58] twirl and it says here for as much then
[42:00] as the children are partakers of flesh
[42:03] and blood you see as much as we are in
[42:06] desert Lea man we had to be redeemed
[42:09] Jesus see he also himself likewise took
[42:13] part of the same so here we see Jesus in
[42:17] flesh and blood upon the earth you see
[42:19] this scripture alone confirms what the
[42:22] prophet the same you see confirm where
[42:24] were you before the foundation of the
[42:25] world right praise the Lord
[42:28] and Galatians says and because you are
[42:32] sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[42:35] his son into your heart crying every
[42:37] thought you were with God before the
[42:39] foundation of the world because you are
[42:41] sons Amen he sends forth his spirit and
[42:48] here's a scripture brother Branham often
[42:50] referred to Matthew 18 tense where I say
[42:52] unto you that in heaven their angels do
[42:55] always behold the face of my father
[42:57] which is in heaven and Bob Ryan said
[42:59] this is speaking of the theophany bodies
[43:01] that are over there remember he said
[43:04] it's to come as a child and so on
[43:06] there's a little picture depicting Jesus
[43:08] speaking to the children and he was
[43:10] saying appeal hinder their faith or then
[43:13] engage them to be better that millstone
[43:14] was hung around your neck and thrown to
[43:16] depths of the sea see because they are
[43:19] the children of God a man speaking of
[43:23] dirty and Easter face is always there
[43:25] angels do always people the face of my
[43:27] father which is in heaven
[43:31] now here's Moses and Elijah I'm no
[43:35] Transfiguration and behold there
[43:38] appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[43:40] talking with him Matthew 17:5 la borde a
[43:44] brother branham's headed north ER
[43:45] anybody's and they're talking to Jesus
[43:48] now Jesus allowed this for our benefit
[43:51] you see this confirms everything else
[43:54] you see you hear dinner there little see
[43:56] we got a place to work throughout right
[43:58] so they were there and the three Peter
[44:03] James and John and you remember Jesus
[44:05] said no don't tell this to any man until
[44:07] after
[44:08] Son of Man is risen you see because he
[44:13] was transfigured before them amen and
[44:16] they were shown the brother Brennan said
[44:19] of prevision my brother and sister and I
[44:21] stood under dimensioned that's that
[44:23] sixth I mentioned and I personally
[44:25] believe that the bride of Jesus Christ
[44:27] their thoughts are gonna be on things
[44:29] above heavenly thoughts heavenly things
[44:32] we're whole who we are we're gonna
[44:35] realize when these days Bill Graham said
[44:37] when the bride comes to realize who she
[44:39] is asking the rapture although that's
[44:41] when our bodies have changed face puffy
[44:45] we've got to keep always you know in our
[44:49] hearts and our souls
[44:51] contact with that other dimension when
[44:54] we're praying when we're believing for
[44:57] it for needs will become here and
[44:59] someone has some
[45:01] whatever you need is we got to just
[45:03] always be higher in heavenly places that
[45:06] says six dimension we have nothing to do
[45:09] with the world and the further we grow
[45:11] in faith to further away that is you
[45:14] know and you know how bad is getting in
[45:16] the world I mean it's just insane over
[45:19] there but on the opposite side we're
[45:22] moving yes every day passes we're
[45:25] getting closer to the body change closer
[45:27] to the body change all the time see
[45:29] God's wheels move slowly but you know 50
[45:33] years ago we didn't understand a lot of
[45:35] things like we do today God is
[45:37] unraveling that revelation wrangle or by
[45:39] more by now we're getting closer closer
[45:41] ESPO I told brother zero number of
[45:43] months ago I said brother God's got some
[45:45] wonderful things in store for his bride
[45:47] we just got to keep posting about keep
[45:51] searching keep digging that's brother
[45:53] journal
[45:53] even read quote on Sunday their
[45:55] relevance they keep taking in the
[45:57] rapture message a man amor belong full
[46:00] and someone a ministry around the world
[46:02] are digging into some wonderful things
[46:04] and I believe that we don't want to be
[46:06] behind he meant we want to be right
[46:08] there moving right on brother one of
[46:10] these days we'll take a step like he he
[46:12] not did in the program said he said
[46:15] praise the Lord
[46:19] so here's a quote from brother Branham
[46:23] from the message fellowship he says now
[46:25] when John 14 when he said in my father's
[46:27] house as many mansions
[46:29] speaking to the disciples before going
[46:32] away he said I can't imagine that being
[46:34] stones in the bricks and mortar I
[46:35] believe the tabernacle he was speaking
[46:38] of was another body see so this is just
[46:41] to confirm about John you see in my
[46:43] father services many Tabernacles four
[46:45] mansions destroyed his tabernacle all
[46:47] raised up in three days in the beam if
[46:50] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we
[46:52] have all one one already prepared and
[46:55] waiting raised the name of the Lord and
[46:58] then let's turn now to second
[47:00] Corinthians Amen and we quoted this one
[47:05] a little earlier 2nd Corinthians 5 verse
[47:08] 1 for we know that our earthly House of
[47:11] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[47:13] building of
[47:14] god amen a house not made with hands
[47:18] eternal in the heavens single burner
[47:22] sister amen hallelujah for in this
[47:25] tabernacle this earthly one we groan
[47:28] earnestly desiring to be clothed to bond
[47:30] but the house which is from heaven if so
[47:33] be that being clothed we shall not be
[47:35] found naked I remember in the parable of
[47:38] indeed one went into the marriage supper
[47:40] without the wedding garment he was naked
[47:42] he never had his stuff he wasn't you see
[47:46] he couldn't good instead he had strong
[47:48] to other darkness if so be that being
[47:50] thought about we shall not be found
[47:51] naked for we that are in this tabernacle
[47:54] do groan being burdened not for that we
[47:57] would be unclothed but clothed the bond
[47:59] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[48:02] light Paul is talking about taking that
[48:05] other body amen
[48:06] praise the Lord one that's eternal in
[48:09] the heavens
[48:10] amen let's go back to first Corinthians
[48:15] chapter 15 if you would I'll try not to
[48:21] keep you too long but I think we should
[48:23] look at a few scriptures are you
[48:27] enjoying the work amen the Lord is so
[48:30] good first twenty of first Corinthians
[48:36] 15 but now is Christ risen from the dead
[48:39] and become the firstfruits of them that
[48:41] slept for my man came death for since by
[48:47] man came death by man came also the
[48:50] resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam
[48:52] all die even so in Christ shall all be
[48:56] made alive but every man in his own
[48:58] order Christ the firstfruits afterward
[49:01] they that are Christ's at his coming
[49:04] amen let's go to verse 35 but some men
[49:09] will say well how are the dead raised up
[49:11] and with what body do they come
[49:14] good question amen Paul says therefore
[49:17] that which star solace is not quickened
[49:19] except to die and that would still
[49:22] solace does so us not that body that
[49:24] shall be but bare grain it may chance
[49:27] sweet or some other green but God had
[49:30] given me the body as it has pleased him
[49:32] and to every seed his own body
[49:35] hey man every elected Gene seed of God
[49:39] has a body praise the Lord every seed
[49:42] his own body all flesh is not the same
[49:46] flesh for this a pound of flesh man
[49:49] another fish and beast not a fishes and
[49:52] other birds but there are also celestial
[49:56] bodies as theophanies and bodies
[49:59] terrestrial that's your earthly body but
[50:02] the glory of the celestial is one and
[50:04] the glory of the terrestrial is another
[50:07] there is one glory of the Sun another
[50:10] glory of the moon glory of the stars one
[50:13] star different from another and glory so
[50:16] also was the resurrection of the Dead it
[50:18] is sown in corruption and his race and
[50:22] in corruption praise the Lord it is sown
[50:24] in dishonor it is raised in glory it is
[50:27] sown in weakness it is raised in power
[50:30] it is sown a natural body it is raised a
[50:34] spiritual body there is a natural body
[50:37] and there is a spiritual body praise the
[50:41] Lord and so it is written the first man
[50:43] Adam was made a living soul last man and
[50:46] last Adam was made a quickening spirit
[50:48] howbeit that which was that was not
[50:51] first which is spiritual but that which
[50:53] is natural but afterward that which is
[50:55] spiritual same with you a new birth
[50:58] their natural do not then after when you
[51:01] get born again then you become
[51:02] spiritually men as is the earthy such
[51:06] are they also that are earthy and as is
[51:09] the heavenly such are they also that are
[51:11] heavenly yes and as we have borne the
[51:14] image of the earthy we shall also bear
[51:17] the image of the heaven you will look
[51:20] like yourself as whatever image you were
[51:23] when you were 20 years old brother I'm
[51:25] said that's the way you look in that new
[51:27] body
[51:29] yeah we'll recognize each other and
[51:32] that's something he praise the Lord all
[51:34] I just love them to work you know the
[51:38] word is the scripture comes to my heart
[51:40] now it's just turn to Luke 24 just see
[51:42] about that scriptures just turn to Luke
[51:44] 24 this really blessed me when I read
[51:48] this this we have borne the image of the
[51:56] earthy we shall bear the image of the
[51:58] heavenly Luke Luke 24 and let's read
[52:01] verse 39 this let's quote the 36 and as
[52:08] they were sand as they thus spake Jesus
[52:11] himself stood in the midst of them and
[52:13] saith unto them peace be unto you but
[52:16] they were terrified and freighted to
[52:17] suppose that they had seen the spirit
[52:19] and this is the account of Jesus
[52:20] appearing unto them after his
[52:22] resurrection and he said unto them why
[52:25] are you troubled
[52:26] why do thoughts arise in your hearts you
[52:30] hold my hands and my feet that it is I
[52:32] myself
[52:33] hang on me and see for a spirit hath not
[52:37] flesh and bones as ye see me have see he
[52:39] said see look at me I'm the same one
[52:42] that you knew before as the earthly
[52:44] souls to heaven be born praise the Lord
[52:47] isn't the wonderful brother Amen so
[52:51] let's continue now back in 1st
[52:54] Corinthians 15 again verse 50 now I say
[52:58] brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[53:00] inherit the kingdom of God neither doth
[53:02] corruption inherit incorruption behold I
[53:05] show you a mystery we shall not all
[53:08] sleep see but we shall be changed
[53:11] where everybody changed brother and
[53:12] sister so we're going to be on the earth
[53:15] we don't know the Living Dead you know
[53:17] we don't commend the grave of course but
[53:19] what goes just going to change see God
[53:21] showed this to Paul way back in that
[53:23] first stage in a moment in the twinkling
[53:25] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[53:28] trumpet shall sound and the dead in
[53:30] Christ shall rise shall be raised
[53:32] incorruptible and shall be changed
[53:34] praise the Lord and courses ties into
[53:36] 1st Thessalonians 4:16
[53:41] but you see the last Trump is the
[53:43] seventh angels message to the Gentile
[53:46] see is the sounding forth of the word
[53:48] trumpet always descending forth of the
[53:50] word and remember scripture is compound
[53:52] meaning there will be a trumpet to the
[53:54] Jews also but the trumpet shall sound
[53:56] and enhanced and the dead in Christ
[53:58] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[54:00] shall be changed for this corruptible
[54:01] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[54:05] must put on immortality amen so when
[54:09] this corruptible has put on him
[54:11] corruption and his mortal shall have put
[54:13] on immortality then shall be brought to
[54:16] pass the saying that is written death is
[54:17] swallowed up in victory amen
[54:20] we know that the last thing to me to be
[54:22] destroyed is death
[54:23] praise the Lord Amen but thanks be to
[54:27] God
[54:28] a man sting of death where is thy sting
[54:31] grave where is thy victory for the sting
[54:33] of death is sin and the strength of sin
[54:34] is the law but thanks be to God which
[54:36] has given us the victory through our
[54:39] Lord Jesus Christ the heir for my
[54:41] beloved brethren and this is for us
[54:43] tonight be be steadfast immovable always
[54:47] abounding in the work of the Lord for as
[54:51] much as you know that your labor is not
[54:53] in vain in the Lord I trust you know
[54:55] better tonight that your labor is not in
[54:57] vain in the Lord Amen we were going to
[55:00] take our possessions someday take our
[55:02] inheritance
[55:02] brother and Branham was asked questions
[55:05] and questions and answers in 1964 about
[55:08] the dead in Christ he said but those who
[55:10] are sleeping in the dust will be
[55:11] awakened first and they'll these
[55:15] corruptible bodies will put on
[55:16] incorruption in the rapture in grace of
[55:18] the Lord and then we'll all get together
[55:21] when they begin to get together then we
[55:23] which are alive and remain shall be
[55:25] changed these mortal bodies will not see
[55:28] death but just of a sudden there will be
[55:30] like a sweet go over us then you'll be
[55:32] changed and imagine brother and sister
[55:33] thinking about that and your turn back
[55:36] like Abraham was from an old man to a
[55:39] young man turn back Allah gave my mother
[55:41] an old man to a young man and to a young
[55:44] woman from an old woman to a young woman
[55:46] what's this sudden change after a while
[55:49] you were travelling like a thought and
[55:51] you can see those who are already
[55:52] resurrected
[55:54] Oh what an hour practicing think of it
[55:56] praise the Lord rally that's gonna be
[55:58] something that's we're rejoicing now
[56:00] well what'll that be you know you'll see
[56:03] sister coffee or this burning this
[56:05] sister why I'm lyin what an hour the
[56:08] Prophet said and then we'll be gathering
[56:10] dem be cut off with them to meet the
[56:12] Lord in the air
[56:14] amen as the scripture said then we which
[56:18] are alive and remain if we cut off
[56:20] together with him you cloud to meet the
[56:22] Lord near that's gonna be quite an event
[56:24] brother I came to eat a man but here's
[56:28] the thing
[56:28] Paul said many bought that fool might
[56:31] have told you often and now tell you
[56:32] even weeping they're not they are the
[56:34] enemies of the cross of Christ who's in
[56:36] this destruction whose God is their
[56:38] belly and whose glory is in their shame
[56:39] who mind earthly things so those who
[56:43] mind earthly things are not going to get
[56:44] caught away where our conversation is in
[56:47] heaven from whence also we look for the
[56:49] Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[56:52] change our vile body that it may be
[56:55] fashioned like unto his glorious body
[56:57] according to the working whereby he is
[57:00] able even to subdue all things
[57:03] praise the Lord see so this is why I
[57:06] said keep your mind on heavenly things
[57:09] amen and affections on things above not
[57:12] the things of the world for our
[57:15] conversation is in heaven that means in
[57:17] heavenly places seem to work amen around
[57:19] the revealed birth a man where he look
[57:22] for the Savior who will change raw body
[57:25] praise the Lord that's what it's all
[57:27] about that's the calling of this hour
[57:29] amen
[57:31] let's turn to Romans for another
[57:33] scripture I guess time is going okay
[57:37] they're still got a few more minutes
[57:40] maybe you're tired
[57:43] amen praise the Lord Romans 8 and 11
[57:48] says but if the spirit of him that
[57:50] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell he
[57:52] knew see he that raised up Christ from
[57:55] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[57:57] body by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[58:00] now he's already quickened it you see
[58:03] but he's going too quick of these even
[58:06] more just first twenty three explains
[58:08] you just go down to verse 23 not only
[58:11] day but ourselves also which have the
[58:13] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[58:16] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[58:18] for the adoption to wit that means to
[58:20] know or to experience or to realize to
[58:23] wit the redemption of the body that's
[58:26] the that's the completion of salvation a
[58:29] body change you see you're born again
[58:31] you save the Holy Spirit but you're not
[58:34] fully redeemed until you get that body
[58:36] change Paul is saying hey to wit and to
[58:39] experience or to having to know a man
[58:42] the changes of that body amen the
[58:45] redemption of our body praise the name
[58:47] of the Lord amen don't you love the word
[58:52] a man let's read a little further Romans
[59:00] 8 again and we're going to read from
[59:04] verse 16 the spirit itself bears witness
[59:08] with our spirit that we are the sons of
[59:11] God that's how we identify she were in
[59:14] agreement with the word all the time he
[59:16] meant and if children then heirs heirs
[59:18] of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so
[59:22] be that we suffer with him that we may
[59:25] be also glorified together that's why
[59:28] we've got to be bearing the reproach for
[59:30] the word see there's no glory without
[59:32] that suffering though the Jareau use
[59:34] that scripture from Philippians many
[59:36] times you see you know we suffer with
[59:39] him Paul saying the same thing here amen
[59:41] so we've got to bear that reproach and
[59:43] every time you go even if you're walking
[59:46] the mall or whatever every time you
[59:48] speak to your neighbor you're always a
[59:50] witnessing you don't have to say much
[59:52] they says look at you the scripture says
[59:55] you were written
[59:56] was rid of all you got to hold a ghost
[59:58] Road they know what okay and all your
[1:00:01] different there's no zero the streets
[1:00:02] and sunny and your and that's that's
[1:00:05] required that's the requirement that the
[1:00:07] holy spirit you've got to walk in the
[1:00:08] spirit at all times
[1:00:10] you can't come to church on Sunday and
[1:00:12] then on Monday you know be afraid be
[1:00:14] ashamed of him if he you're shaming him
[1:00:16] down here you'll be shame of you up
[1:00:18] there well we got a various reproach
[1:00:23] Amen by God's grace for I reckon Paul
[1:00:27] said in 18 verse 18 and I reckon that
[1:00:29] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:00:30] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:00:33] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:00:37] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:00:38] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:00:42] sons of God amen for now for me no well
[1:00:50] verse 20 for the creature was made
[1:00:53] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:00:55] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:00:57] in Hope because the creature itself also
[1:01:00] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:01:02] corruption praise the Lord
[1:01:03] see this is a body change right
[1:01:06] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:01:08] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:01:10] children of God for we know that the
[1:01:12] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:01:14] in pain together unto now not only day
[1:01:18] but ourselves also which had the
[1:01:20] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[1:01:23] ourselves amen we groan within ourselves
[1:01:26] waiting for that full adoption so full
[1:01:29] adoption is not going to come until we
[1:01:31] get that body change first corinthians s
[1:01:35] alone ian's every down now 1st
[1:01:38] Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13
[1:02:03] well I would not have you eating up
[1:02:05] rather than concerning them that are
[1:02:06] asleep oh we just read this from the
[1:02:08] wall ago that you saw all not even as
[1:02:10] others which have no hope for if we
[1:02:12] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:02:14] even so then that sleep in Jesus will
[1:02:17] God bring with him for this we say unto
[1:02:20] you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:02:22] which are alive remain unto the coming
[1:02:25] of the Lord shall not prevent them which
[1:02:27] are asleep for the Lord himself shall
[1:02:29] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:02:31] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[1:02:33] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:02:36] shall rise first
[1:02:37] as brother Joel was ministering on
[1:02:39] Sunday from the prophets message to
[1:02:42] rapture he said all these things happen
[1:02:44] together right the shout is the message
[1:02:46] going for we've heard the voice of the
[1:02:49] Lord hey Manny Archangel and the voice
[1:02:51] and the Trump of God and brother Burns
[1:02:54] said one of them will call the dead from
[1:02:56] the grave so we're very close brother
[1:02:58] and sister a man for that catching away
[1:03:00] time verse 70 and we which are alive and
[1:03:05] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:03:07] them in the clouds to meet the lord in
[1:03:08] the air and so shall we ever be with the
[1:03:11] Lord therefore wherefore comfort one
[1:03:13] another
[1:03:14] Amen with these words praise the Lord I
[1:03:21] have another quote here okay okay we
[1:03:28] read that one all right
[1:03:29] praise the Lord one more scripture
[1:03:33] second test villain 1710 sake that's
[1:03:41] baloney in 7 so 2nd Thessalonians 1 7 to
[1:03:48] 10 and to you who are troubled rest with
[1:03:53] us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
[1:03:55] from heaven with his mighty angels now
[1:03:59] this is what happened in 1963 you see in
[1:04:04] flaming fire what was there to Pillar
[1:04:07] fire in that profits message taking
[1:04:09] vengeance on them that know not God and
[1:04:11] that obey not the gospel of the Lord
[1:04:14] Jesus Christ
[1:04:15] we shall be punished with everlasting
[1:04:17] destruction from the presence of the
[1:04:19] Lord and from the glory of his power
[1:04:21] when he shall come to be glorified in
[1:04:24] his Saints and to be admired and all
[1:04:27] them that believe because our testimony
[1:04:29] among you was believed in that day my
[1:04:33] brother sister this scripture here has
[1:04:37] been fulfilled now there will be
[1:04:40] multiple fulfilling some scriptures we
[1:04:43] know but you can't deny that when the
[1:04:47] Lord is descended in 63 in that cloud
[1:04:50] the angels came with him all right we
[1:04:54] know the pillar fired a flaming fire was
[1:04:56] in the province ministry and it was
[1:04:58] bringing judgment on one hand the dogs
[1:05:01] that rejected the word but it was grace
[1:05:03] to us who received it so it says in
[1:05:06] verse 9 who shall be punished with
[1:05:07] everlasting destruction from the
[1:05:09] presence of the Lord now the presence of
[1:05:12] the Lord would ease brought because the
[1:05:14] presence is always weak better mind at
[1:05:16] work wherever the word is to presence is
[1:05:19] and in the ark we remembered it to the
[1:05:22] two angels were there its cherubim and
[1:05:25] and God told Moses that his presence
[1:05:29] would be between the cherubim and you
[1:05:31] know brother Brian's ministry was a type
[1:05:34] Moses and Elijah and the presence of the
[1:05:36] Lord that pillar of fire was with the
[1:05:38] Prophet you see that's the octet were
[1:05:42] with amen
[1:05:43] that's the secret place that the bride's
[1:05:45] gone into beyond the veil praise the
[1:05:48] Lord
[1:05:48] even though the Prophet was gone you see
[1:05:50] the mantle of Elijah went back to Elisha
[1:05:53] and Elijah was a type of the bread a man
[1:05:57] and he had a double portion raised the
[1:05:59] Lord so I did the bride's going to have
[1:06:01] a double portion a man of that spear
[1:06:04] that was under prophet he said kept do
[1:06:06] became more will unfold amen please gone
[1:06:11] so all scripture brothers and sisters
[1:06:13] given by inspiration of God as we read
[1:06:15] to begin and is profitable for doctrine
[1:06:19] for reproof for correction and for
[1:06:21] instruction in righteousness
[1:06:23] Amen aren't you thankful for the word
[1:06:26] that God has given us

[1:14:23] the word amen and again it is faith that
[1:14:27] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[1:14:30] a man so we got to hear the word so I

[1:14:37] tonight so our brother Alec in lining of
[1:14:39] the word a man this scripture this
[1:14:43] scripture this scripture a man is
[1:14:45] amazing that he could take you just over
[1:14:47] an hour maybe and have so many
[1:14:49] scriptures it would take me a month or
[1:14:54] longer a man but thank God for the
[1:14:58] scriptures that our brother brought out
[1:15:00] and God by the grace of the by grace
[1:15:03] through the Holy Spirit lining them up
[1:15:05] and brother it's all pointing it's the
[1:15:08] truth it's all pointing to a body change
[1:15:10] a man God did this and God did that and
[1:15:13] God said you did this down through the
[1:15:15] ages in the last four thousand years for
[1:15:17] what's he doing now a man made that by
[1:15:20] science and history and religion they're
[1:15:23] all identifying what God has done but
[1:15:26] how many are identifying with God it
[1:15:29] with what God is doing a man and when
[1:15:32] brother our brother brought it out and
[1:15:34] and summarized it and then he just
[1:15:36] brought it to a conclusion it's somebody
[1:15:38] change a man say then beyond beyond and
[1:15:42] what is the body change it is the
[1:15:43] resurrection and it is the rapture and
[1:15:45] he and again he brought know the dead in
[1:15:47] Christ shall rise first a man then we
[1:15:50] which are alive remain but baby what is
[1:15:54] to bring on that resurrection what is to
[1:15:56] bring on that rapture it is the Lord
[1:15:58] descending from heaven with a shout with
[1:16:00] the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:16:02] Trump of God and the cloud and it's all
[1:16:05] in the cloud and I like that oh praise
[1:16:09] the Lord I say thank you Lord God
[1:16:10] brought out the boat the cloud the cloud
[1:16:13] the cloud the cloud God revealed himself
[1:16:15] in a cloud through a cloud
[1:16:18] and and and it's not just it's just not
[1:16:20] clothes of rain it's not clouds of
[1:16:22] moisture that you and I are experiencing
[1:16:25] it's clouds of glory and clouds of glory
[1:16:28] or the clouds of angels a million
[1:16:30] because that's that's what the prophet
[1:16:33] of God saw and what our brother brought
[1:16:34] out there was tremendous when he when he
[1:16:37] started with the picture of the cloud a
[1:16:39] man because the Lord should descend from
[1:16:42] heaven with a shout and as the voice of
[1:16:44] the it would be in a cloud and he ate
[1:16:47] pardon in the Lord Himself amen
[1:16:50] and he's exactly he brought it with one
[1:16:52] scripture after another after another
[1:16:54] after another and I noted I said it's
[1:16:57] all clouds
[1:16:58] eisah God in the cloud God in the cloud
[1:17:01] God in the cloud and and and and the
[1:17:04] part of God near the end of his ministry
[1:17:06] before God took all of all he because
[1:17:10] why he was to be the witness they made
[1:17:13] this when he was east I'm not the son of
[1:17:14] man he said I am Ehsan a man revealing
[1:17:17] the son of man a man and he was he was
[1:17:20] pointing us to the revelation of the
[1:17:22] coming so that we were going to context
[1:17:24] it's going to take us into the
[1:17:26] resurrection and Rajshri faith a man and
[1:17:29] her brother was a lady also tonight but
[1:17:32] for it is the body change a man
[1:17:35] he was the body change in crisis the
[1:17:37] money changing you and me by the grace
[1:17:39] of God the Old Testament know the New
[1:17:41] Testament a man and the prophet of God
[1:17:44] said oh and he was talking about the
[1:17:46] coming of the Lord he was talking about
[1:17:47] Jesus being here and with us these are
[1:17:49] there he is cuz people one of the only
[1:17:52] hasn't come he's not here but he is
[1:17:54] there is he said looking down at us
[1:17:57] because it was it was Christ coming in
[1:18:00] the clouds of glory and we know that it
[1:18:02] was it was the Father God did see seven
[1:18:05] angels and there was one of them that
[1:18:08] was attracted to him and he was
[1:18:10] attracted to them and then again what
[1:18:13] did they tell what was the message the
[1:18:14] word go back would go back to age for
[1:18:17] the old me of the word and what was they
[1:18:20] were going to do any man it was Alleluia
[1:18:23] praise the Lord have brought a God
[1:18:24] elbows that is not just things not just
[1:18:27] the unveiling of this mystery of this
[1:18:29] doctrine of that doctrine of that
[1:18:31] doctrine no brother it's the body change
[1:18:34] as our brother was bringing out tonight
[1:18:36] is the body change
[1:18:37] we're brothers anything we need right
[1:18:39] now is the body change right not because

[1:19:22] what is that it is the testimony of the
[1:19:25] fall it's a testament in what happening
[1:19:27] the beginning in the Garden of Eden a
[1:19:29] man Adam and Eve did not get old a gold
[1:19:33] brother until the sin amen when the sin
[1:19:37] struck and God put him out of the garden
[1:19:38] out of the presence of God amen brother

[1:20:02] woman and he she didn't say you know
[1:20:05] this or that or something else she said
[1:20:08] God didn't say what God said who again
[1:20:12] they say you know again in the city the
[1:20:15] city at the idea of sin it was a Eve
[1:20:18] eating an apple you know and again we've
[1:20:21] heard a lot of people say if eating an
[1:20:23] apple made a woman look realize she was
[1:20:26] naked we should pass the apples again
[1:20:28] hey man it was an apple that Eve that he
[1:20:32] ate and when God came to her he wasn't
[1:20:36] asking what she did or what did this or
[1:20:40] what did that but
[1:20:40] who did it amen because God knew that it
[1:20:45] was it was a being and it wasn't an
[1:20:47] apple there wasn't a fruit and so far no
[1:20:50] but it's like the particle someone said

[1:20:58] arpa ir a mad it was that pear on the
[1:21:01] ground he said Adam and Eve he said that
[1:21:04] was the original syrup and so on but God
[1:21:07] kept coming down a man to bring out the
[1:21:11] sin to reveal the sin and so on and God
[1:21:15] said and rather a God God did give them
[1:21:20] a promise he said I will put enmity
[1:21:22] between thee and the woman between thy
[1:21:25] seed and her seed and it shall bruise
[1:21:27] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:21:29] and the Father God said the devil's been

[1:31:24] it's going by the grace of God a man is
[1:31:30] wonderful
[1:31:31] so don't forget that it's a body change
[1:31:34] everything is focusing on the body
[1:31:36] change and we know that because of
[1:31:40] what's going on in Israel and also to
[1:31:45] have the revelation don't forget this
[1:31:46] the revelation that was brought her
[1:31:49] tonight concerning God and the clouds
[1:31:54] every time that guy came down there was
[1:31:57] a cloud they saw a cloud so in this day
[1:32:01] in this hour brother he was in the cloud
[1:32:04] he came down by the grace of Almighty
[1:32:07] God he descended from heaven with a
[1:32:10] shout and so on could more more thoughts
[1:32:15] on that but they praying the grace of
[1:32:19] God that all of us all of it what God
[1:32:21] has done is to give us the faith of the
[1:32:24] body change not just wisdom but
[1:32:28] understanding one thing to know
[1:32:31] something another thing is to understand
[1:32:33] it understanding is what puts us into
[1:32:36] action a person can have wisdom and do
[1:32:39] nothing
[1:32:40] but understanding puts them into action
[1:32:42] by the grace of God amen god bless you
[1:32:46] turned to number or in the in the book
[1:32:52] it's 40 but I'm not sure what it is here
[1:32:54] praise the Lord sister God be the glory
[1:32:57] great things he has done so loved you
[1:33:00] the world that he gave us his son who
[1:33:04] yielded his life an atonement for sin
[1:33:06] and he opened the life gate that all may
[1:33:10] go in all the elect and it says old
[1:33:14] perfect redemption the purchase of blood
[1:33:17] to every believer the promise of God the
[1:33:20] violence of fender truly believes that
[1:33:23] moment from Jesus a pardon receipts so
[1:33:28] great things he has taught us great
[1:33:30] things he had done a man and he's been
[1:33:33] teaching us tonight a man if we've
[1:33:36] learned anything tonight I trust me
[1:33:38] learned that all that God has revealed
[1:33:40] is plenteous to a body change to give us
[1:33:44] the faith for a body juice it's all
[1:33:46] faith you gotta believe it's not God
[1:33:51] doing it you do it by grace but pure and
[1:33:55] iron greater will be our wonder our
[1:33:58] rapture the books is our transport but
