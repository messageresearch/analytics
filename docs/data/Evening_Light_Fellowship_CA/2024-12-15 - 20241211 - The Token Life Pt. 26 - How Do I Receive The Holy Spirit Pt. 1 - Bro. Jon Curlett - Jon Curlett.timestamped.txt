[44:18] that might be listening this morning but
[44:20] we pray God will be with them give them
[44:21] a break certainly take our greetings to
[44:23] brother Jerry and and uh sister Debbie
[44:26] and the Church there and of course
[44:28] brother Adam and sister uh Jamie and the
[44:31] family there as well amen you can see
[44:33] I'm in glasses this morning just a minor
[44:35] irritation in my eye but I'm just
[44:38] abundance of caution I guess try not to
[44:39] aggravate it so Paul had a thorn in his
[44:42] flesh that seems to be mine these days
[44:44] so you keep me in your prayers just
[44:46] trusting the Lord that he is my healer
[44:48] amen amen God bless you Ezekiel 36 and
[44:51] 24 he says for I will take you from
[44:54] among the Heathen gather you out of all
[44:56] countries and will bring you into your
[44:58] own land then will I sprinkle clean
[45:00] water upon you and you shall be clean
[45:02] from all your filthiness and from all
[45:04] your Idols will I cleanse you a new
[45:07] heart also will I give you and a new new
[45:09] spirit will I put within you and I will
[45:11] take away the Stony heart out of your
[45:13] flesh and I will give you an heart of
[45:15] Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[45:17] you and cause you to walk in my statutes
[45:20] and ye shall keep my judgments and do
[45:23] them amen God bless you you can have
[45:25] your seats this morning we're continuing
[45:26] our series on the Holy Ghost and maybe
[45:29] you'd think this would be one we'd start
[45:31] this series with and I want to speak on
[45:32] how do I receive the Holy Spirit but you
[45:35] know sometimes we don't know we need to
[45:37] receive it there's been a lot of
[45:39] teaching there's been a lot of preaching
[45:41] about the Holy Spirit and how do you get
[45:43] it and how do you know you have it and
[45:45] people have messed it up to such a point
[45:47] that they don't know if they're coming
[45:48] or going if they're in or they're out if
[45:50] they're saved if they're not they don't
[45:51] know where they're at and so they they
[45:53] have church experiences and they have
[45:55] Camp experiences and all these different
[45:57] things and they don't know if they've
[45:58] got the Holy Spirit or not and so we've
[46:00] got to know how do you receive it and
[46:02] we've got to know what it means when you
[46:04] receive it we've got to know uh the the
[46:06] proof that you've received it and so I'm
[46:07] going to teach this very tightly this
[46:09] morning I don't believe it'll be a
[46:10] preaching service it'll be a teaching
[46:12] service but I want to say and started
[46:14] with this there's a lot of people that
[46:16] think they have the Holy Ghost and they
[46:17] don't and I don't say that as a judgment
[46:20] or as a criticism by any means amen but
[46:22] I speak that because the word tells us
[46:24] that and we'll get into that a little
[46:25] bit this morning but the condition of
[46:27] the Rel of the the latest and church age
[46:29] is religious
[46:31] self-deception and that's a people that
[46:33] believes that they're rich and increased
[46:34] in goods and have need of nothing
[46:36] spiritually they think they have it all
[46:39] and the scripture says you don't know
[46:40] that you're miserable poor wretched
[46:42] blind and naked they don't have anything
[46:44] that God requires of them and so we've
[46:46] got a world that's a Christian world
[46:48] that's created their own standards to
[46:50] make themselves comfortable with where
[46:52] they're at so that they don't have to
[46:53] change and they think in all of that
[46:55] because they're happy and they're
[46:56] satisfied that they have the Holy Spirit
[46:58] and nothing could be further from the
[47:00] truth and I'm not talking about the
[47:02] world out there I'm talking about the
[47:03] message and then don't ever think that
[47:05] this is outside this is something we
[47:07] have to look at internally because we
[47:09] have people that believe that they have
[47:11] the Holy Spirit because they recognize a
[47:12] prophet in this age we have people that
[47:14] believe because they know the Seven
[47:15] Seals are open that they've got the Holy
[47:17] Spirit we've got people that believe
[47:19] that because they sit under a particular
[47:20] Ministry they have the Holy Spirit
[47:22] because they go to a particular Church
[47:23] they have the Holy Spirit because they
[47:25] go to a message Church they have the ho
[47:26] Holy Spirit and I'm not saying they
[47:28] don't have the Holy Spirit but I'm
[47:30] saying those are not the reasons why you
[47:32] have the holy spirit amen so we've got
[47:34] all sorts of ideas that to make us
[47:36] comfortable and make us think we're
[47:37] going to make it amen but there's only
[47:39] one way to receive the Holy Spirit and
[47:41] it's simple it's time tested and it's
[47:44] available today amen it's it's it's
[47:47] never changed amen it doesn't change
[47:49] with time if God gives it to one person
[47:52] one way he has to give it to the other
[47:53] person the same way he can't change it
[47:55] because we're in a different time and
[47:57] season it's all the same way but I want
[47:59] to start with us in Ezekiel because this
[48:01] is the promise of the giving of the
[48:02] spirit one of the prophecies that God
[48:05] gave regarding the pouring out of his
[48:06] spirit and and the starting point is in
[48:09] Ezekiel 36:25 he says then will I
[48:12] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[48:14] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[48:17] from all your Idols will I cleanse you
[48:20] the starting point to receive the holy
[48:22] spirit is to recognize your condition
[48:25] you have to recognize that this is the
[48:28] the one of the the the the key
[48:29] prophecies regarding when God was going
[48:31] to pour out his spirit and it starts
[48:33] with a people that are filthy and
[48:36] worshiping Idols now today we don't tend
[48:38] to look at idol worship the way they did
[48:40] back then back then they had other gods
[48:42] they would make them out of stone or
[48:44] clay or or some sort of metal or gold
[48:47] whatever it might be and we don't have
[48:49] that in North American culture today we
[48:50] don't have people that prop up typically
[48:52] something in their house or they go to a
[48:55] church and they have a statue there
[48:56] unless you're Catholic maybe but you go
[48:59] to India and they have that you go to
[49:01] Africa and they might have that you go
[49:02] to China and you go to Japan they may
[49:04] have an idol that they worship but we
[49:06] don't have those things but we know that
[49:08] an idol is anything that is worshiped
[49:11] it's an object of worship and so it can
[49:13] be something or it can be someone that
[49:15] you give special attention to from your
[49:18] time from your money from your energy
[49:20] from your attention it's something that
[49:22] you place a lot of value in and it's
[49:24] something that you seek out to place in
[49:26] Pre Ence in your life and so we have all
[49:28] sorts of Idols today and I'm not going
[49:30] to SP spend a bunch of time but if
[49:32] you're out in the world some people's
[49:33] Idol is drinking and they they they live
[49:36] to drink they put their money to drink
[49:38] whatever they have left over at the end
[49:40] of the week or the end of the month that
[49:41] goes into drinking for some people it's
[49:43] partying for some people it's carousing
[49:45] for some people it's racing cars for
[49:47] some people it's sledding for some
[49:48] people it's skiing and all they live for
[49:51] is to do that one thing and what is it
[49:54] it's an idol in their life amen but we
[49:57] can have religious Idols as well we can
[49:59] have people that live to go to church to
[50:01] speak in tongues we have people that go
[50:04] to church to sit down and hear the
[50:06] Mysteries and they've turned these
[50:07] things into idols and if the church
[50:09] service isn't this way and if you don't
[50:11] do this and if you don't do that then
[50:12] you don't have what they have and they
[50:14] turn these things into an idol we can
[50:16] have church Traditions listen we do
[50:19] things differently in this church than
[50:20] other churches around the world and we
[50:23] do it by choice and by preference in
[50:25] some cases not because it's by the word
[50:27] of God there are things we do according
[50:29] to the word of God and those are
[50:31] absolute and we don't change them but
[50:33] there are ways that we operate in here
[50:35] as a church as a sovereign local body
[50:37] that others don't and guess what we can
[50:39] try and force people to bow down to that
[50:41] and it's just a church tradition it's
[50:43] just a preference it's not right it's
[50:45] not wrong it's just the way that we do
[50:47] it and yet somebody can come into this
[50:49] church and we try and force them into a
[50:50] certain way because that's the way
[50:52] everyone else does it but if the word
[50:54] doesn't say it's supposed to be that way
[50:55] then we aren't supposed to be doing that
[50:57] we're creating a religious Idol out of
[50:59] the Traditions that we've had all of our
[51:00] lives but he says regardless of where we
[51:03] are regardless of who we are we are
[51:05] filthy and we're Idol worshippers we've
[51:07] got something we bow down to every
[51:09] single day and we're dirty compared to a
[51:11] holy God doesn't matter if we're raised
[51:13] in a in a Christian Home doesn't matter
[51:15] if we're raised out in the world on the
[51:16] streets in the filthiest of homes by a
[51:19] scriptural standard we're all Filthy
[51:21] compared to a holy God Amen so you can't
[51:24] come to God thinking you don't need to
[51:26] be changed
[51:27] Jesus would talk about this Parable in
[51:29] Luke 18 of the of the Publican and the
[51:32] Pharisee and he said he spake this
[51:34] Parable sorry he spake this Parable unto
[51:37] certain which trusted in themselves that
[51:41] they were righteous and they despised
[51:44] others self-righteousness despises
[51:47] others that's what we'll see he says two
[51:49] men went up into the temple to pray one
[51:51] a Pharisee a
[51:52] priest a man that was dedicated to not
[51:55] so much a priest didn't have to be a
[51:57] priest to be a Pharisee I don't think
[51:58] but they were taught a certain way and
[51:59] the other was a Publican and the
[52:02] Pharisees stood and prayed thus unto
[52:04] himself God I thank thee that I am not
[52:09] as other men
[52:11] are can you imagine extortioners unjust
[52:15] adulterers or even as this Publican
[52:18] brother Mark I'm not going to but he's
[52:21] pointing to somebody in the
[52:25] church have you you ever say God I am so
[52:29] thankful I'm not like brother John in a
[52:31] certain certain
[52:33] way sister still has she
[52:37] giggled but
[52:39] Church don't we do
[52:42] it we look at a family we look at a
[52:45] person and we say boy aren't we just so
[52:48] glad we're not like
[52:50] them we might say it up here we might
[52:52] never say it here come on let's be
[52:55] honest
[52:57] okay maybe we'll do some preaching this
[53:01] morning thank God thank God I'm not like
[53:05] him I'm not like
[53:07] her
[53:09] self-righteous
[53:12] religion I fast twice a week twice in
[53:17] the week I give tithes of all that I
[53:20] possess he's well
[53:22] taught he's smug and he's convinced of
[53:26] his own
[53:28] righteousness the symptoms of a person
[53:31] like this of a self-righteous P person
[53:34] is they talk about themselves a lot in a
[53:37] glowing way and they talk about other
[53:40] people in a dismissive way let's check
[53:43] up let's check up this morning but the
[53:47] Publican standing AAR off see he
[53:50] wouldn't even come and approach but he
[53:53] stood a far off it says and he says he
[53:56] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[53:59] unto heaven but smed himself upon his
[54:03] breast saying God been merciful to me a
[54:07] sinner he's
[54:09] repentant he's acknowledging his natural
[54:12] condition and he has no thought of
[54:15] worthiness Jesus says I tell you this
[54:18] man the Publican that said I am God be
[54:21] merciful to me a sinner this man went
[54:24] down to his house Justified rather than
[54:27] the other why because one Justified
[54:29] himself the other asked God to do it he
[54:33] says for everyone that exalteth himself
[54:35] shall be abased and he that humbleth
[54:37] himself shall be
[54:40] exalted repentance is a key element of
[54:44] receiving the Holy Spirit we said before
[54:46] and we've preached this before that
[54:47] repentance is the Zeal of the leodan age
[54:51] in in Revelation 3 Jesus said as many as
[54:53] I love I rebuke and chasen repent be
[54:56] zealous therefore and repent so we can't
[54:59] start in a position of I am awesome I am
[55:01] great I am acceptable I am Holy I am
[55:04] good we have to come in saying I am a
[55:07] sinner even if we're better than most
[55:10] people we're still just the best of the
[55:13] worst we're still Sinners we're still
[55:15] filthy in God's eyes compared to his
[55:18] Holiness and his righteousness we are
[55:20] filthy amen that's a hard thing to
[55:22] preach these days because people are
[55:24] sitting here saying I am who I am I am
[55:27] who God made me don't we hear that I God
[55:30] made me like this how can he judge me no
[55:32] God didn't make you like that sin made
[55:34] you like that sin has dropped us from
[55:37] our image in the from the image of God
[55:39] and it's made us now in the image of man
[55:41] it made us in the image of a fallen Adam
[55:44] and so we are not in the image of God
[55:46] yes God is the source of our life and we
[55:48] live and Breathe by his grace and mercy
[55:51] but we are not the way he intended our
[55:54] original condition and nature is not one
[55:56] of godliness nor is it from God it is
[55:59] satanic it is in sin it is infilled so
[56:02] it's broken Humanity that needs to be
[56:04] changed and that's what God's trying to
[56:06] do that's what it's going to take that
[56:08] working of Ezekiel 36 so we have to
[56:11] recognize our original condition and
[56:13] that's the hardest thing in a religious
[56:16] World The World Isn't So religious these
[56:19] days but in some places it is and the
[56:21] hardest thing is to get a religious
[56:22] person to recognize their
[56:24] condition but he can continues in
[56:26] Ezekiel 36 he says now after I've
[56:29] cleaned you up he says a new heart also
[56:32] will I give you and a new spirit will I
[56:35] put within you and I will take away the
[56:37] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[56:39] give you a heart of Flesh now this is
[56:42] one of the trickiest elements of the new
[56:43] birth of receiving the Holy Spirit and
[56:45] it's a lot of it's where a lot of people
[56:47] get hung up because God says I'll give
[56:50] you a new heart and a new spirit in
[56:52] other words God says I'm going to change
[56:54] your life
[56:56] and when he does that because it's such
[56:58] a drastic change people think because
[57:01] I'm changed I've received the Holy
[57:04] Spirit but what's the change he takes
[57:07] away the Stony heart he takes that
[57:09] rebellious heart he takes away that
[57:10] stubborn heart that heart that can't
[57:12] receive correction that heart that can't
[57:14] receive
[57:15] love he takes that away and he gives us
[57:18] he says a heart of Flesh now a heart of
[57:21] Flesh if you think about flesh you think
[57:23] about your body and so you can squeeze
[57:25] flesh it's not
[57:26] this is hard it's
[57:29] resistant it's stiff necked it's
[57:32] stubborn but a heart of Flesh you can
[57:34] squeeze amen it can respond to God it
[57:37] can be changed by God it can move with
[57:39] the spirit of God it can allow the word
[57:41] to have an
[57:42] effect he would write in Jeremiah he
[57:45] says but this shall be the Covenant that
[57:47] I will make with the house of Israel
[57:49] after those days sayith the Lord I will
[57:51] put my law in their inward parts and
[57:53] write it in their hearts and will be
[57:56] their God and they shall be my people so
[57:59] this changing of our heart and the
[58:01] spirit is what allows us to receive the
[58:04] word of God in its fullness that's a
[58:07] work of the holy spirit it's what allows
[58:09] us to receive it to respond to it to
[58:11] accept it and to obey it amen it's what
[58:14] cleans up our lives what takes away
[58:16] those worldly desires and it puts a
[58:18] Godly desire inside of our hearts now
[58:21] listen to this quote he says now the
[58:22] Bible said that he would give us a new
[58:24] heart and he would give us a new spirit
[58:26] and many people even Pentecostal people
[58:29] and Full Gospel people have been
[58:31] deceived in that many times God said
[58:33] I'll give you a new spirit he says that
[58:35] wasn't his Spirit that's your spirit
[58:39] then I will put my spirit in you I'll
[58:41] give you a new spirit then I'll put my
[58:43] spirit in you he says and many times you
[58:46] get the new spirit and think you've got
[58:48] the Holy Spirit and you're trusting upon
[58:50] emotions and signs and things he says
[58:53] when your life doesn't match up to that
[58:56] he says now that's just a little raw but
[58:58] remember it's the truth he's saying
[59:00] you've got a change of heart you've got
[59:01] a change of attitude your spirit's
[59:03] changed but your life hasn't changed to
[59:05] line up with the word
[59:07] yet he's not saying they're wrong he's
[59:10] just saying you haven't finished the
[59:13] process amen he says many people that
[59:17] new spirit God has to give you a new
[59:19] spirit to get along with his Spirit why
[59:22] cuz what we have is the spirit in the
[59:24] nature of our mom and our dad and our
[59:26] grandpa and our Grandpa Grandma and
[59:28] Grandpa we have it in our DNA we have
[59:30] something that we've received from our
[59:32] family some of us have pretty good
[59:34] attitudes naturally but that's still not
[59:37] good enough we all of us need these
[59:39] things he says God had to give you a new
[59:41] spirit to get along with his Spirit Well
[59:43] some people are so mean they can't even
[59:45] get along with themselves let alone with
[59:47] God if he come in that's right he says
[59:50] they're so doubtful and up and down God
[59:53] has to give you a new spirit give you a
[59:55] new nature so you can get along with his
[59:58] Spirit when it comes he says amen I hope
[1:00:01] you see it God gives you a new spirit
[1:00:03] for yourself and then he puts his holy
[1:00:06] spirit in there to dwell with you and
[1:00:08] abide with you notice he doesn't
[1:00:11] dechristianize these
[1:00:13] people we can't take away from what
[1:00:16] people have amen if they're at a place
[1:00:18] of repentance we say praise the Lord
[1:00:21] because that's the working of the holy
[1:00:22] spirit amen this is a process and it may
[1:00:25] take some time if they're at a place
[1:00:27] where their lives cleaned up and there's
[1:00:28] a change of heart and attitude we say
[1:00:32] praise the Lord because that's a working
[1:00:34] of the holy spirit amen but that won't
[1:00:37] get you into heaven that's not eternal
[1:00:40] life the holy spirit is eternal life so
[1:00:43] don't stop don't rest because you've
[1:00:46] received a life-changing experience go
[1:00:48] until you've received eternal life
[1:00:50] itself because eternal life is not
[1:00:52] accepting just accepting the work at
[1:00:54] Calvary for what Christ did there in in
[1:00:57] that he shed his blood and paid your
[1:00:59] sins that's not it the full work of
[1:01:01] Calvary was to put his life inside of
[1:01:04] you and so many people are preaching
[1:01:06] today that you receive you you you say
[1:01:09] I'm a sinner I accept what Christ did at
[1:01:10] Calvary now you're saved no the
[1:01:13] Salvation is what it's in receiving
[1:01:15] eternal life you've got to go all the
[1:01:17] way you've got to take the full work of
[1:01:19] redemption forgiveness is not the full
[1:01:22] work of redemption it's the starting
[1:01:24] point of redemption amen a new new heart
[1:01:26] and a new spirit isn't Redemption but
[1:01:28] it's on the path of redemption but it
[1:01:30] takes the body change to have our full
[1:01:32] Redemption and you got to have the Holy
[1:01:33] Spirit to Quicken that body to give you
[1:01:35] a body change so the the fullness of
[1:01:38] redemption is the receiving of the holy
[1:01:40] spirit in a way that's going to change
[1:01:42] your body and so that we can be caught
[1:01:43] up with him amen so we see that the the
[1:01:46] and we'll get into this probably in the
[1:01:48] next service that receiving the Holy
[1:01:50] Spirit can be something that you hear
[1:01:52] the word and it comes in a moment it can
[1:01:55] be a process of days it can be a process
[1:01:57] of weeks it could be a process of years
[1:01:59] and you could be truly on the path to
[1:02:02] eternal life you're a child of God but
[1:02:05] that Holy Spirit may not come at the
[1:02:07] beginning it may come a ways down your
[1:02:08] life it took me six months to receive
[1:02:10] the Holy Spirit after I got baptized in
[1:02:12] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:14] Christ some people receive it
[1:02:16] immediately some people receive it
[1:02:18] before some people receive it after
[1:02:19] we'll see as we go through scripture
[1:02:21] amen the timeline is not what's set in
[1:02:23] stone what's set in stone is the results
[1:02:26] the effect of the holy spirit in your
[1:02:27] life is the same for every single person
[1:02:30] amen but like I said we're facing the
[1:02:32] challenge of a religious people
[1:02:34] especially in North America and so we
[1:02:37] come to God and we try and fit him into
[1:02:39] our lives and we try and blend him into
[1:02:42] our programs and our way of doing things
[1:02:44] and that's never been the way that God
[1:02:46] works God always requires a total
[1:02:49] separation amen where we can't invite
[1:02:51] God into our program we have to leave
[1:02:53] ours and go to his that's what he said
[1:02:55] to Abraham he says leave your Kindred
[1:02:57] leave your land leave everything behind
[1:02:59] and come to me and that's been the same
[1:03:01] way it is through every time in history
[1:03:03] amen listen who's being redeemed us or
[1:03:06] God the redeemed are the ones that have
[1:03:08] to move the Redeemer stays where he is
[1:03:12] if God has to change to suit us then
[1:03:14] he's the one that's being redeemed he's
[1:03:15] the one that's being changed but the
[1:03:17] scripture says I am the Lord I change
[1:03:18] not so he can't be changing to suit us
[1:03:21] rather we have to be changed back into
[1:03:23] our original condition in what we were
[1:03:25] in the word in Christ Before Time Ever
[1:03:27] began amen so we can't invite God into
[1:03:30] our decisions and into our way of living
[1:03:32] and into our plans and that we have to
[1:03:34] lay those things down and take Christ
[1:03:38] and then once he's there then he makes
[1:03:40] our decisions he makes our plans he sets
[1:03:42] our life in order and we follow him
[1:03:44] rather than try and blend him into what
[1:03:46] we've already decided
[1:03:49] amen he's looking for
[1:03:52] surrender not not cooperation not we put
[1:03:55] in a bit and he puts in a bit right it's
[1:03:58] all or it's none that that's the only
[1:04:01] way God's going to work he's got to have
[1:04:03] total control and he will have total
[1:04:05] control scripture or he says now the
[1:04:08] Bible said here a new heart will I give
[1:04:09] you he says I like it always God
[1:04:12] speaking of something new that he's
[1:04:15] going to do that doesn't mean he'll just
[1:04:17] patch up that old condition but a new
[1:04:20] heart will I give you and I'll take away
[1:04:21] the Stony heart which you have and a new
[1:04:23] spirit will I give you Jesus Jesus
[1:04:25] taught the same thing in Luke when he
[1:04:27] said you can't put new wine into Old
[1:04:30] bottles he says wine has a life in it
[1:04:33] and wine new wine especially it's
[1:04:35] fermenting yet and it might spread out a
[1:04:38] little and if it goes to pushing in the
[1:04:40] old bottle the old dry Hive will burst
[1:04:43] and fly open see in those days they put
[1:04:45] wine into animal skin bottles and Jesus
[1:04:48] said you can't put new wine in Old
[1:04:50] bottles because why that old bottle has
[1:04:53] already been stretched and it's dry out
[1:04:56] it doesn't have any flexibility anymore
[1:04:58] and you fill it with new wine that new
[1:04:59] wine is fermenting so it's expanding
[1:05:02] inside there and what'll it do it'll
[1:05:03] bust the bottle open so he says if it
[1:05:06] goes to pushing in the old bottle the
[1:05:08] old dry Hive will burst and fly open and
[1:05:10] then the hide is ruined and also the
[1:05:12] bottle is ruined and the wine is spilled
[1:05:14] he says now that's about the picture we
[1:05:16] have before us today you can't come to
[1:05:18] an old formal bunch of intellectuals and
[1:05:21] with your ideas and try and adopt God's
[1:05:24] program into your intellectual program
[1:05:27] it just won't work that old dry cwh high
[1:05:29] will blow up because it just can't take
[1:05:32] it what's the problem today we've got
[1:05:35] Christians that have created Christians
[1:05:37] that have created their own Christian
[1:05:39] programs and they've left the word
[1:05:41] behind because it's not socially
[1:05:43] acceptable it doesn't fill the seats of
[1:05:45] the church it doesn't draw in big crowds
[1:05:47] and they've set their own way of worship
[1:05:49] and then what do they do is they invite
[1:05:51] God
[1:05:52] in and God can't come in because the way
[1:05:54] that they worship ship is contradictory
[1:05:56] to the word of God and so what is left
[1:05:59] if you aren't worshiping God then you're
[1:06:01] worshiping somebody else and the only
[1:06:02] thing that's left is Satan if God's not
[1:06:05] there listen today real Christianity is
[1:06:08] heresy to nominal Christianity see in
[1:06:11] the old days Paul said the way that I
[1:06:12] worship is the way that's called heresy
[1:06:15] because the way he worshiped was
[1:06:16] contrary to what the Jews believed now
[1:06:18] Christianity is come full circle to what
[1:06:21] where Paul believed is now heresy again
[1:06:23] they've fallen so far from the original
[1:06:25] word that it's called heresy again and
[1:06:28] so that's what they call us they call us
[1:06:30] Heretics they call us Cults they call us
[1:06:32] uh you know uh Fanatics because why we
[1:06:34] don't believe what the mainstream
[1:06:36] believes in critical
[1:06:39] areas and what are they doing they're
[1:06:41] worshiping doctrines they're worshiping
[1:06:42] Creeds they're worshiping a way of
[1:06:44] worship they're worshiping a way of
[1:06:45] preaching they're worshiping a way of
[1:06:47] service has to go rather than worshiping
[1:06:49] under the true word of God we've got to
[1:06:52] come out of all of it lay it down lay
[1:06:54] our opinion or preferences down lay it
[1:06:57] down and come to Christ I've said it
[1:06:59] before when I got saved listen I was
[1:07:00] raised in this message taught very well
[1:07:03] but between brother Mark and Sunday
[1:07:04] school brother Gerald over the pulpit I
[1:07:06] was raised listening to the word of God
[1:07:09] I understood it intellectually but when
[1:07:11] I got the Holy Spirit my application of
[1:07:14] the word changed drastically for
[1:07:16] starters I had a lot more grace I had a
[1:07:19] lot more grace why because I needed
[1:07:21] Grace I needed Grace because when I
[1:07:23] looked in the mirror of the word I saw
[1:07:25] my shortcomings and guess what it didn't
[1:07:27] matter how good or bad brother Bob was
[1:07:29] then cuz now he's working on
[1:07:31] me I needed that Grace and I continue to
[1:07:34] need that Grace and the thing is when
[1:07:36] God's busy working on me I don't have
[1:07:37] too much time to worry about how bad
[1:07:39] somebody else
[1:07:40] is and so what does it do yes I
[1:07:43] understood intellectually many of the
[1:07:45] doctrines but the application of the
[1:07:47] word change because now it's focused on
[1:07:49] me rather than focused on everybody else
[1:07:52] amen that's my testimony so it changed
[1:07:55] life is a part of the process of the new
[1:07:57] birth of receiving the Holy Spirit but
[1:07:59] it's not the end I thank God for every
[1:08:01] professing Christian that's had a
[1:08:03] changed life but that may not be the end
[1:08:06] depending where they at a life changed
[1:08:07] is not eternal life it's just a part of
[1:08:10] coming to eternal life Jesus spoke of
[1:08:12] the foolish virgins you realize in the
[1:08:14] Book of Matthew and you realize that a a
[1:08:17] virgin is a woman that has been
[1:08:18] Untouched by a man she's never been uh
[1:08:22] in any way
[1:08:25] soiled if you want to put it that way
[1:08:28] she is completely
[1:08:30] pure there's nothing that's been touched
[1:08:32] about her and if you look at those those
[1:08:35] those virgins there was five wise and
[1:08:37] there was five foolish so the foolish
[1:08:39] virgins they lived a clean life they had
[1:08:42] a Sanctified life they had the right
[1:08:44] Doctrine they went perhaps to the right
[1:08:45] Church they were dedicated to God they
[1:08:48] were sincere in every way on the outward
[1:08:51] expression and appearance the wise
[1:08:53] virgins and the foolish virgins looked
[1:08:54] exactly the same the foolish virgins
[1:08:57] dressed the right way they talked the
[1:08:59] right way they acted the right way
[1:09:00] everything about them was the same as
[1:09:02] the wise virgins what was the only
[1:09:04] difference one had the oil of the Holy
[1:09:06] Spirit the other one didn't but every in
[1:09:09] every other way they were exactly the
[1:09:11] same you can have a changed life and not
[1:09:14] have the Holy Spirit is what I'm getting
[1:09:16] at amen Judas had a changed life for
[1:09:19] quite some
[1:09:20] time but he didn't receive the Holy
[1:09:23] Spirit Paul worked with a bunch of
[1:09:25] ministers that had changed lives and
[1:09:27] then they walked away why they didn't
[1:09:29] have the Holy Spirit a changed life is
[1:09:31] not the only proof that we have
[1:09:33] amen what is it that they turn down
[1:09:35] Christ The Living
[1:09:37] Word that he comes in and he'll change
[1:09:39] us and he'll take away everything and
[1:09:41] he'll bring us subject to his
[1:09:44] word he continues now in Ezekiel 36 he
[1:09:47] says yes I'll give you a new heart I'll
[1:09:49] give you a new spirit he says and I will
[1:09:51] put my spirit within you and cause you
[1:09:54] to walk in my statutes and you shall
[1:09:57] take my keep my judgments and do them
[1:09:59] we'll get into the evidence of the holy
[1:10:01] spirit in a future service but briefly
[1:10:03] I'll say this if you have the Holy
[1:10:05] Spirit you'll receive and obey the word
[1:10:07] of God as it comes to you that's what he
[1:10:09] says here you'll walk in my statutes
[1:10:11] you'll live according to my word amen
[1:10:15] and it won't be by
[1:10:17] legalism it won't be by discipline it'll
[1:10:20] be by a desire in your heart it'll be
[1:10:22] something inside of you that wants to do
[1:10:23] it you'll want to do what the word word
[1:10:25] says I'm not saying this flesh doesn't
[1:10:27] fight this flesh hates the word of God
[1:10:30] absolutely it hates the word of God why
[1:10:31] because it's uncomfortable it causes
[1:10:33] separation it causes us to give up
[1:10:36] things this flesh wants so I'm not
[1:10:39] saying there's not a battle there don't
[1:10:40] take the battle to think that you don't
[1:10:42] have the Holy Spirit but what's winning
[1:10:44] that'll tell you if you've got the Holy
[1:10:46] Spirit or not but look he says I'll give
[1:10:48] you a new spirit then I'll put my spirit
[1:10:50] in you what's the difference between a
[1:10:51] new spirit and his Spirit Well a new
[1:10:54] spirit is new and his spirit is
[1:10:57] unchanging it's always been there amen
[1:11:00] one is from God the other one is God
[1:11:04] anden one is a work of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:07] the other one is the Holy Spirit what
[1:11:09] we're talking about is an effect versus
[1:11:11] the person that's really what we're
[1:11:13] talking about that new spirit has its
[1:11:15] ups and downs it's in and outs it's not
[1:11:18] a perfect spirit it's a spirit that's
[1:11:20] meant to get along with God but it is
[1:11:22] not God it's just from him amen it's
[1:11:25] still subject to conditions and
[1:11:27] circumstances and events of life amen
[1:11:29] but the holy spirit is unmoving
[1:11:31] unchangeable all powerful it stands
[1:11:34] alone it stands sure it's a sure
[1:11:37] foundation so our new spirit is still
[1:11:40] variable the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:11:43] change brother R puts it this way he
[1:11:45] says if you won't accept righteousness
[1:11:47] then unrighteousness will take over if
[1:11:50] you won't receive Christ the world will
[1:11:52] take you you can't go out that door the
[1:11:54] same person you were coming in here you
[1:11:57] can't be the Holy Spirit brooding wooing
[1:12:00] calling oh if you'll come I'll take away
[1:12:03] that Stony heart if you'll come I'll
[1:12:04] place a new spirit in you and if you'll
[1:12:06] come I'll come into this new spirit he
[1:12:10] says then when the Devil comes back what
[1:12:12] does he find he finds his old tinan
[1:12:15] alley that's what our life was before
[1:12:16] it's an alley between two buildings
[1:12:18] dirty Dark full of junk people throwing
[1:12:20] their stuff in he says God sent his big
[1:12:23] bulldozer down and cut all the thing to
[1:12:25] pieces and bulldozed it and scraped it
[1:12:28] all off and a Hallelujah Avenue is built
[1:12:31] there it isn't the same place there's a
[1:12:33] big modern home built there the Holy
[1:12:35] Spirit has brooded big beautiful flowers
[1:12:38] of Salvation standing up he says you
[1:12:41] don't have to try to impersonate
[1:12:43] anything it's a new heart it's a new
[1:12:46] dwelling place it's a new spirit
[1:12:48] everything is new he says how can the
[1:12:50] devil walk back there and expect the old
[1:12:52] card table and cigars and the old fussy
[1:12:55] fighting stewing and everything else you
[1:12:58] had in you he's saying it's a complete
[1:13:00] change of your
[1:13:02] life he says when he walks back he finds
[1:13:05] God took his bulldozer and run the whole
[1:13:08] thing out and turned the whole ground
[1:13:09] upside down made a big Terrace and put a
[1:13:12] beautiful home and moved in himself he
[1:13:15] says hallelujah the Holy Spirit turns
[1:13:17] over the old tinan alley and dumps you
[1:13:20] upside down sweeps the devil's stuff out
[1:13:23] there and creates a new heart and a new
[1:13:25] life he says not only that I love this
[1:13:29] but he moves in to see that everything
[1:13:32] goes all right he says glory to God
[1:13:36] remember what uh the scriptures say it
[1:13:38] says that a man a spirit leaves him and
[1:13:41] it goes out of a person's life and what
[1:13:43] do they do he says they clean up the
[1:13:45] house and they put everything in order
[1:13:48] but when that Spirit comes back finding
[1:13:51] nothing in the house he comes back with
[1:13:53] seven others worse than himself and the
[1:13:56] the final condition of that person is
[1:13:58] worse than when they started because it
[1:14:01] does you no good to clean up your life
[1:14:03] if you don't put a strong man in the
[1:14:04] house and that's what the holy spirit is
[1:14:07] that's what he's saying God moves into
[1:14:09] that cleaned up life see God does the
[1:14:11] work cuz he can't live in a filthy
[1:14:13] vessel so he cleans up the life he
[1:14:15] cleans up your attitude he cleans up
[1:14:17] your spirit he takes away those desires
[1:14:19] he cleans up the habits but then he has
[1:14:21] to come in to secure the house to seal
[1:14:25] your soul to the day of your Redemption
[1:14:27] and he comes in to make sure that
[1:14:28] nothing else comes back and gets on you
[1:14:31] cuz once he's in the house the soul is
[1:14:33] sealed and Satan can't ever get in that
[1:14:35] Soul oh he can press into your mind he
[1:14:37] can press into this body by way of
[1:14:39] sickness and stresses and fears but he
[1:14:41] cannot get into the soul because that is
[1:14:43] where God is living
[1:14:45] amen we've talked about the brooding of
[1:14:48] the Holy Spirit the last couple of
[1:14:49] services and how that purpose of the
[1:14:51] Holy Spirit was to bring out those seeds
[1:14:54] and produce and sustain the life that
[1:14:56] was in them but watch how Jesus sets
[1:14:58] things up after his resurrection he's in
[1:15:00] a glorified body and he comes to the
[1:15:02] disciples the doors are all locked to
[1:15:04] the room they're in and he appears in
[1:15:06] the middle of them he's in his glorified
[1:15:07] body now and he and he points to the
[1:15:09] Future and it says then Jesus said to
[1:15:12] them again peace be unto you as my
[1:15:15] father has sent me even so send I you
[1:15:18] and when he had said this he breathed on
[1:15:20] them and saith unto them receive ye the
[1:15:24] Holy Ghost
[1:15:26] this is a very strange
[1:15:28] event because Jesus says receive ye the
[1:15:31] Holy Ghost and did they receive the Holy
[1:15:33] Ghost right
[1:15:34] then no if we have to be so careful how
[1:15:39] we interpret
[1:15:40] events because you have Jesus Christ
[1:15:44] there in a glorified body breathing on
[1:15:46] them and saying receive the Holy Spirit
[1:15:49] and what happens absolutely nothing why
[1:15:53] because he's speaking prophetically he's
[1:15:55] not speaking for the moment because
[1:15:57] every single one of them went up on the
[1:15:59] day of Pentecost and they did receive
[1:16:01] the Holy Ghost so what he said came to
[1:16:04] pass but it didn't come to pass when he
[1:16:06] spoke it but he was pointing to the
[1:16:08] Future to the time and to the season
[1:16:11] amen and I'm saying that because I
[1:16:13] preach the same message here today and I
[1:16:15] will continue to preach it I preach that
[1:16:17] you are the Spotless sinless bride of
[1:16:19] Christ and you are and yet we still make
[1:16:23] mistakes what because our sinlessness is
[1:16:26] not in this flesh but it's in Christ but
[1:16:28] there's a day where we will be
[1:16:30] transformed completely to full sinless
[1:16:34] Perfection amen I preach what that we
[1:16:38] are a resurrected people we're seated in
[1:16:40] Heavenly places in Christ that's a
[1:16:43] spiritual place for now but it's an
[1:16:44] eternal place after this resurrection
[1:16:46] and Rapture is over but nonetheless you
[1:16:49] are
[1:16:49] there you're there but we only see the
[1:16:53] effects of that rather than the full
[1:16:55] reality of it right now we're moving
[1:16:57] into it and we're experiencing it but we
[1:16:59] don't have it yet we're on the road but
[1:17:02] we're not to our destination we could
[1:17:03] say so we can't get ahead of ourselves
[1:17:05] we believe the word we accept it by
[1:17:08] faith but God has to make it happen in
[1:17:10] our lives before we can say I've got it
[1:17:13] amen he's got to actually do the work by
[1:17:16] faith we can say it's ours but it takes
[1:17:19] God to say here it is in his time and in
[1:17:22] his season we're looking for the time
[1:17:24] where we can say this is it we've got it
[1:17:27] that's what we're looking for with the
[1:17:29] word so we have to be so careful how we
[1:17:31] interpret events and experiences amen a
[1:17:34] fanatic would have said right there I've
[1:17:36] received the Holy Ghost because Jesus
[1:17:37] breathed on me and said receive ye the
[1:17:39] Holy
[1:17:40] Ghost but that's not how it works amen
[1:17:42] we've got to take the full word of God
[1:17:44] if Jesus had given them the Holy Spirit
[1:17:46] then then they would have done the works
[1:17:47] that they did on the day of Pentecost
[1:17:49] right then and there but they knew
[1:17:51] nothing had changed but a fanatic would
[1:17:53] say well it's changed because he said it
[1:17:55] You' got to take the full word you got
[1:17:57] to take everything he said about that
[1:17:59] we're not trying to push down someone's
[1:18:00] Faith but we're trying to say make sure
[1:18:02] you compare to the whole word of God not
[1:18:04] just this one experience you have see
[1:18:06] brother B would say he says we we judge
[1:18:08] things by our experiences rather than by
[1:18:10] the word we've got to make our
[1:18:12] experiences subject to the word of God
[1:18:15] because that's the only way that we'll
[1:18:16] interpret them properly but we see now
[1:18:18] that Jesus goes and he ascends to heaven
[1:18:21] and now after he ascends they're in the
[1:18:23] season of receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:18:24] Spirit that's the time it's the season
[1:18:26] it's it's when he said it was going to
[1:18:28] happen and before he went away he said
[1:18:30] these words and he says behold I send
[1:18:33] the promise of my father upon you but T
[1:18:36] ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be
[1:18:40] ued with power from on high and he led
[1:18:43] them out as far as Bethany and he lifted
[1:18:45] up his hands and blessed them and it
[1:18:47] came to pass when he blessed them he
[1:18:49] parted from them and carried up into
[1:18:52] heaven and they worshiped him and
[1:18:54] returned to Jerusalem with great joy and
[1:18:57] were continually in the temple praising
[1:19:00] and blessing God Amen I want you to
[1:19:03] catch because we're in a season Church
[1:19:06] they're in the season of the promise of
[1:19:08] receiving the spirit they're in the days
[1:19:11] they're in the months or the week that's
[1:19:13] leading up to receiving it they know it
[1:19:15] Jesus has said it he's confirmed it he's
[1:19:17] breathed on them they are the people of
[1:19:19] the promise of Ezekiel 36 of Joel 2:28
[1:19:23] and they're just buzzing about it
[1:19:25] there's a Revival sweeping through their
[1:19:27] midst and what do they do they go into
[1:19:30] the temple and they're worshiping and
[1:19:32] praising and they don't even have the
[1:19:34] promise yet but because they've received
[1:19:37] a revelation that the promise is for
[1:19:40] them what are they doing they're acting
[1:19:42] as if they've got it it's not wrong to
[1:19:45] act as if you've got it because when the
[1:19:47] word of God comes and it's personally
[1:19:49] revealed to you you can say I'm going to
[1:19:52] get it that scripture tells me we don't
[1:19:55] have to wait to receive it to thank God
[1:19:57] for it we don't have to wait for our
[1:19:59] healing to thank God for his healing
[1:20:01] promise we don't have to thank wait to
[1:20:03] thank God for his provision before he
[1:20:05] gives us a provision when he gives us
[1:20:07] his word and we receive it in a heart of
[1:20:09] faith we can come to church and we can
[1:20:11] have a Hallelujah service even if we
[1:20:13] haven't received it why cuz we're in the
[1:20:15] season of receiving the promise he's
[1:20:18] made it personal to you he's made it
[1:20:20] personal to me so our praise doesn't
[1:20:22] have to start after the victory after
[1:20:24] after the overcoming after the provision
[1:20:26] after the healing it can start as soon
[1:20:29] as we realize it's for me I'm a part of
[1:20:32] the promise I'm a part of the word and
[1:20:34] the reality is coming and I'm going to
[1:20:35] give him a praise of it this morning
[1:20:37] that's how our attitude ought to be
[1:20:40] church then we move jump we jump forward
[1:20:43] to Acts chapter 2 it says and when the
[1:20:45] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:20:48] were all with one Accord in one
[1:20:51] place scripture there says fully come
[1:20:55] there's a first fruits Feast right after
[1:20:58] the Passover and that's the day that
[1:21:00] Christ rose from the dead the F the the
[1:21:03] the the day of the first fruits the
[1:21:05] original first fruit it's the first of
[1:21:07] the first and so Christ was raised from
[1:21:09] the dead by the spirit of God on that
[1:21:12] day of the first
[1:21:13] fruits what was he he was the first of
[1:21:16] many Brethren he was the first of many
[1:21:19] he was telling us that there's more
[1:21:20] coming like this so the day of Pentecost
[1:21:23] is the fullness of the Harvest the day
[1:21:25] of Pentecost is when the rest of the
[1:21:28] plants are in the condition that the
[1:21:30] first plant was they've come to where it
[1:21:32] was amen it's the Harvest celebration
[1:21:35] the day is the day of Pentecost is when
[1:21:38] the Harvest matches the first fruit amen
[1:21:41] so notice now it says they're all with
[1:21:43] one Accord in one place that word that
[1:21:46] phrase one Accord means they're all in
[1:21:48] unity they're all there for the same
[1:21:50] reason what's the reason start a church
[1:21:54] start a
[1:21:55] movement make a name for yourself no
[1:21:59] they're there to receive the promise of
[1:22:01] the word that's the only reason they're
[1:22:04] there they've been waiting for 10 days
[1:22:06] amen their promise of the word was his
[1:22:09] life in them the holy spirit inside of
[1:22:11] them not just on them not just around
[1:22:14] them but the personal presence of God in
[1:22:16] their lives that's why we come to church
[1:22:19] we either come to receive him or we come
[1:22:21] because we've received him that's the
[1:22:23] only reason to be be in church and what
[1:22:25] happens as we come into church is
[1:22:27] because we've received the word then the
[1:22:29] word continues to come and we continue
[1:22:31] to receive we continue to be cleaned
[1:22:33] encouraged corrected strengthened
[1:22:35] whatever we have need of that's what
[1:22:36] brings us into church is because we've
[1:22:38] received it or we're trying to receive
[1:22:40] it that's the purpose amen so they're
[1:22:43] not just there but the scripture says
[1:22:44] not just for the same purpose but
[1:22:46] they're in the same place they're
[1:22:48] gathered in one place now we stream our
[1:22:50] services because there are people that
[1:22:52] don't have churches to go to genuinely
[1:22:54] don't
[1:22:55] almost impossible for them to do it
[1:22:57] because of finances age whatever that
[1:22:59] might be but I want to say this this
[1:23:00] morning streaming is not the same as
[1:23:02] being in church and there are those that
[1:23:05] are streaming this morning that could be
[1:23:07] in
[1:23:08] church scripture doesn't say they were
[1:23:10] gathered online they were gathered in
[1:23:12] one place together and there is no
[1:23:15] comparison between being in a service
[1:23:17] here versus a service online it is
[1:23:19] completely different so I will say this
[1:23:21] to those that are listening if you can
[1:23:22] get to a church go to a church
[1:23:24] that's the scriptural requirement for a
[1:23:26] Believer is to be a part of a local body
[1:23:28] amen it's just no
[1:23:32] comparison verse two says so they're in
[1:23:34] one Accord they're in one place they're
[1:23:36] there for the same purpose they're all
[1:23:38] pulling on the word of God for the same
[1:23:40] thing says and suddenly there came a
[1:23:43] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[1:23:45] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:23:47] they were sitting now notice the wind
[1:23:50] was not them receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:23:52] the wind was the effect of the Holy SP
[1:23:54] Spirit coming into the building the
[1:23:56] noise is not
[1:23:58] life the moving of the spirit is not
[1:24:01] life it's just what proof that he's
[1:24:03] there potentially amen they're not the
[1:24:07] same don't confuse the noise with the
[1:24:08] person the noise is in effect but the
[1:24:11] person is life itself it says and there
[1:24:14] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[1:24:16] of as fire and it sat upon the entire
[1:24:20] congregation it's not the way it says it
[1:24:22] it says it sat upon each of them it's an
[1:24:26] individual Affair it's an individual
[1:24:28] experience you do not get into heaven by
[1:24:30] Church
[1:24:32] affiliation you don't get there it's a
[1:24:34] personal experience amen it's an
[1:24:36] individual event every person got their
[1:24:39] own
[1:24:40] portion it says and they were all filled
[1:24:43] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:24:45] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:24:47] them utterance so they finally received
[1:24:49] this great promise of Ezekiel 36 of Joel
[1:24:52] 2:28 and what do they do with it
[1:24:55] what do they do with this great promise
[1:24:57] they do what we all ought to do they go
[1:24:59] tell other people about it if you got
[1:25:02] something like the Holy Spirit you'll
[1:25:03] let people know there's something out
[1:25:05] there for them amen they have the
[1:25:07] reality of the Gospel that they've never
[1:25:09] had they've had signs and wonders
[1:25:10] they've had Miracles healings raising
[1:25:12] from the dead walking on water storms
[1:25:15] spoken out of existence but they have a
[1:25:17] greater reality now by the Holy Spirit
[1:25:19] than they ever had with all of those
[1:25:20] experiences why they have passed from
[1:25:23] Death unto life
[1:25:25] they've received eternal life now Peter
[1:25:27] goes down and he starts to stand up and
[1:25:28] speak and you'll notice one thing when
[1:25:30] everyone has the holy spirit it's in
[1:25:33] order not everyone tries to stand up and
[1:25:35] speak not everyone wants to be the the
[1:25:38] spokesman for the for the new movement
[1:25:40] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ one stands
[1:25:42] up and he starts to preach and what does
[1:25:45] he do he takes them back to the word of
[1:25:48] God that's what the holy spirit will do
[1:25:50] it'll take you back to the word of God
[1:25:52] and he shows them where they're at at
[1:25:54] what they're seeing and he shows how
[1:25:56] it's the experience that the word of God
[1:25:58] promised them the holy spirit always
[1:26:00] confirms the word amen what's Peter
[1:26:04] saying this is it he said what you've
[1:26:07] read about for hundreds and hundreds of
[1:26:10] years this is it that's what the message
[1:26:13] always is this is it that's what happens
[1:26:16] amen it points us to the time we're in
[1:26:18] it points us to the season we're in and
[1:26:20] then it gives us the opportunity to
[1:26:21] accept it or reject it that's what the
[1:26:23] holy spirit's always trying to do trying
[1:26:25] to get the people to where God is at in
[1:26:27] his Plan of Redemption and then the
[1:26:29] invitation made be a part of it come
[1:26:33] join accept it and be a part of it amen
[1:26:36] and he he starts to go and he he said he
[1:26:38] shows them all the events that have
[1:26:39] happened in the last three and a half
[1:26:41] years and in particular the last few
[1:26:42] months and he tells them what they did
[1:26:44] to Jesus and he tells them who Jesus is
[1:26:46] and he tells them what they did and he
[1:26:48] tells him now but it didn't stop him
[1:26:50] he's risen from the dead he's Lord in
[1:26:52] Christ and he tells him there's a
[1:26:54] purpose to all of it and then he gives
[1:26:57] the opportunity and he lays it right in
[1:26:58] their lap he says therefore let all the
[1:27:01] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[1:27:03] ha made the same Jesus whom ye have
[1:27:06] crucified both Lord and Christ now when
[1:27:09] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:27:10] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[1:27:12] the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:27:14] Brethren what shall we do so under the
[1:27:17] inspired preaching of the word of God by
[1:27:19] the Holy Spirit their consciences are
[1:27:22] bothered you you know what preachers are
[1:27:25] trying to do today keep from pricking
[1:27:27] the people's consciences why cuz people
[1:27:30] with their consciences bothered don't
[1:27:31] want to come back to church but these
[1:27:34] people
[1:27:35] do when these people when their
[1:27:37] consciences were pricked when they're
[1:27:39] they started to bother them they
[1:27:41] recognize their condition they recognize
[1:27:43] their failure that they don't say I
[1:27:45] don't want to hear anymore they say how
[1:27:47] do I change it how do I fix this
[1:27:50] condition that I'm in how do I get back
[1:27:52] into the the the good Graces of God Amen
[1:27:56] the holy spirit in their life working in
[1:27:59] their midst drew them to a place of
[1:28:01] change it did not condemn
[1:28:03] them
[1:28:05] amen we're not here to drive people away
[1:28:08] this
[1:28:08] morning Book of Revelation says the
[1:28:11] spirit and the bride say come it's
[1:28:13] always an invitation we're not here to
[1:28:15] put people out if people want to go out
[1:28:17] let them go out themselves we're here to
[1:28:19] say come in come in get a little closer
[1:28:22] I preached on uh on that woman at the
[1:28:24] well you know it amazes me and it goes
[1:28:27] to show the predestination of God
[1:28:29] because Jesus goes through her life and
[1:28:32] he says you're bound in sin because you
[1:28:34] can't stay in a marriage you're divorced
[1:28:36] and remarried and now you're living
[1:28:37] common law and then he says oh by the
[1:28:39] way you don't even know how to worship
[1:28:42] God that would drive most people right
[1:28:44] out of the church doors you don't know
[1:28:46] where you're at you don't know what
[1:28:47] you're doing but what did he say he said
[1:28:50] there's a solution and I've got it he
[1:28:52] said cuz when he comes he's to come in
[1:28:54] spirit and in truth and that'll fix
[1:28:56] every problem you've got in your life
[1:28:58] sister and that's when she Drew in she
[1:29:01] Drew in because she recognized her
[1:29:03] condition but she saw no condemnation
[1:29:06] but she saw an invitation for her life
[1:29:08] to be
[1:29:09] changed that he wasn't putting her down
[1:29:12] because she was a Samaritan a mixed
[1:29:14] breed a mixed blood a mixed religion a
[1:29:16] fallen life a fallen woman but she heard
[1:29:19] mercy and Grace coming through that man
[1:29:21] as it discerned her life that's what
[1:29:23] Drew her in amen we don't have to worry
[1:29:26] if we're wrong church we have to worry
[1:29:28] if we won't accept the correction of
[1:29:30] being wrong when the word comes our way
[1:29:32] that's when we ought to say hey this is
[1:29:33] me that's me doesn't matter if you're a
[1:29:36] pastor to the
[1:29:37] janitor we ought to be able to say I'll
[1:29:40] take the correction when it comes and
[1:29:42] they ask that simple question what shall
[1:29:45] we do how do we fix this how do we make
[1:29:48] it right how do we get back in the good
[1:29:50] graces of God they know they've
[1:29:52] crucified the Messiah
[1:29:54] the scripture says these were devout
[1:29:56] Jews sincere
[1:29:59] Believers committed to the word of God
[1:30:02] and then they realize they broken
[1:30:03] everything that he told them and they
[1:30:05] say what do we do what does p what does
[1:30:08] Peter tell them join the church pay your
[1:30:12] ties dress
[1:30:14] right no that's putting the cart before
[1:30:17] the horse he says get a life-changing
[1:30:21] experience what you have hasn't worked
[1:30:23] you you need a different life you need a
[1:30:25] different religion you need a different
[1:30:27] thing you need to accept the changer
[1:30:29] rather than trying to be the change
[1:30:30] yourself that's the greatest struggle I
[1:30:33] find in young people is they're trying
[1:30:34] to change themselves for God rather than
[1:30:36] letting God do the work you can't do it
[1:30:39] you can't do it you've got to surrender
[1:30:41] and say I can't do it I need a
[1:30:44] lifechanging presence in my own life
[1:30:49] amen what does Peter say then Peter said
[1:30:52] unto them repent
[1:30:54] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:30:56] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:30:58] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:31:01] of the Holy Ghost first thing he says
[1:31:03] repent first work of the Holy Spirit
[1:31:06] repentance that means it's not my work
[1:31:08] and it's not your work that word repent
[1:31:11] means a changing of the mind that leads
[1:31:14] to a changing of a lifestyle see you
[1:31:16] have to realize up here that what you're
[1:31:18] doing is wrong that the way you think
[1:31:20] the way you act the way you respond the
[1:31:22] lifestyle you live whatever it might be
[1:31:23] it's wrong so you can't repent of
[1:31:25] something unless you come to a new
[1:31:27] revelation that what you do is wrong so
[1:31:29] he's got to change the mind and that
[1:31:30] will come down and that'll convict your
[1:31:32] heart amen and only the Holy Spirit can
[1:31:35] change your
[1:31:36] mind otherwise man will move it here and
[1:31:38] man will move it there and one will
[1:31:39] convince you in and want to convince you
[1:31:40] out and it's just the whims of men
[1:31:43] moving in our lives but he changes our
[1:31:45] mind and there's a new heart and a new
[1:31:47] spirit that comes with that amen but
[1:31:49] after we're we repent we must be saved
[1:31:51] right that's that's what the world
[1:31:53] teaches
[1:31:54] if you repent and he forgives you of
[1:31:56] your sins then you're saved right that's
[1:31:58] not what Peter said Peter says repent
[1:32:01] and and what be baptized in the name of
[1:32:05] Jesus Christ wait a second that's not
[1:32:07] what Jesus told them to do Peter's not
[1:32:10] repeating word for word what Jesus said
[1:32:12] did he World teaches this and it's in
[1:32:14] the scriptures so we have to preach it
[1:32:16] he says go then and make disciples of
[1:32:18] all the nations baptizing them into the
[1:32:21] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:32:23] the the Holy Spirit I recognized
[1:32:25] something yesterday in studying that I
[1:32:27] have never recognized before and I
[1:32:29] guarantee you if I told you to quote
[1:32:31] this scripture every single one of us
[1:32:32] would quote it wrong we would say
[1:32:34] baptizing them in the name he doesn't
[1:32:37] say in the name did you notice in the
[1:32:41] denominations when they do it they don't
[1:32:42] say into the name they say baptizing in
[1:32:45] the name that is not what the scripture
[1:32:48] says has anybody else ever noticed this
[1:32:51] I have never noticed it cuz it's always
[1:32:52] been quoted to me in in the name of the
[1:32:54] father Son and the Holy Spirit that is
[1:32:56] not what Jesus said he says baptizing
[1:32:58] them into the name that completely
[1:33:01] changes it completely changes it amen
[1:33:04] that word into means indicating a
[1:33:07] direction or change of position towards
[1:33:10] something and if you go to the New
[1:33:12] Testament Paul uses that same word to
[1:33:14] describe the real
[1:33:16] baptism he says for by one Spirit are we
[1:33:19] all baptized into one body in Christ one
[1:33:25] body in Christ and everyone sorry
[1:33:28] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:33:30] we be Bond or free and have been all
[1:33:32] made to drink into one so it's not the
[1:33:35] same as the word in that Peter uses in
[1:33:37] Acts 238 where he says baptized in the
[1:33:39] name of Jesus Christ into and in are not
[1:33:42] the same word here not even close not
[1:33:44] even close because that word in the name
[1:33:46] of Jesus Christ in means upon the basis
[1:33:48] of or by and through so he says you're
[1:33:50] baptized through Christ it's in the name
[1:33:53] or on the basis of the work of Calvary
[1:33:56] that's how we're baptized but that is
[1:33:58] not being baptized into the name that's
[1:34:01] baptizing in the name two very different
[1:34:04] things watch what Paul says now he says
[1:34:06] in Romans 12:5 he says so we be many are
[1:34:09] one body in Christ and everyone members
[1:34:13] one of another now this word in means a
[1:34:15] finished work this is at the end of it
[1:34:17] all you're in Christ amen first we were
[1:34:20] going into but now he says we're in how
[1:34:23] by the the Holy Spirit not by water
[1:34:25] baptism by the baptism of the holy
[1:34:27] spirit so we're in one body of whom
[1:34:30] Christ the word so we're not looking for
[1:34:33] water baptism we're looking for Holy
[1:34:36] Ghost baptism that's the baptism that's
[1:34:38] going to make the change water baptism
[1:34:40] is just the outward sign outward work
[1:34:43] outward sign of an inward work water
[1:34:46] baptism does not change you it
[1:34:49] represents it's symbolic of a change
[1:34:51] that's supposed to have happened where
[1:34:52] you have died out to sin
[1:34:54] and you've risen a new creation or new
[1:34:56] creature in Christ baptism doesn't
[1:34:58] change you amen it's a symbol that we've
[1:35:02] died out to self listen to what John
[1:35:05] said was Jesus came before he came up to
[1:35:08] the River Jordan he says I indeed
[1:35:10] baptize you with water unto repentance
[1:35:13] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[1:35:15] than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to
[1:35:17] Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy
[1:35:20] Ghost and with fire scripture says our
[1:35:23] God is a consumer in God so John says
[1:35:25] I'm not saying he's not going to baptize
[1:35:27] you with water but the water is not what
[1:35:29] makes the difference it's the fire of
[1:35:31] the Holy Spirit that's going to make the
[1:35:32] difference and isn't that exactly what
[1:35:34] we saw on the day of Pentecost we saw
[1:35:36] him come down and baptize them with the
[1:35:38] Holy Ghost and Fire the Holy Ghost
[1:35:40] falling down tongues of fire and it
[1:35:42] changed the lives of 120 people in an
[1:35:45] instant so when Jesus said baptizing
[1:35:48] them into the name of the Father the Son
[1:35:50] and the Holy Ghost what was he saying he
[1:35:52] was saying get them into the body of
[1:35:54] Christ get them into Holy Ghost baptism
[1:35:57] not just into water baptism get them
[1:35:59] into the new birth John the Baptist
[1:36:01] baptized people with water did it change
[1:36:03] them no Jesus baptized all of his
[1:36:07] disciples including Judas was that the
[1:36:09] new birth no it was a part of the
[1:36:12] process but that was not the
[1:36:14] life-changing experience it was symbolic
[1:36:16] but the actual right of baptism the
[1:36:18] ritual of
[1:36:19] baptism is not a life-changing
[1:36:22] experience that's not what's going to
[1:36:24] make the
[1:36:25] difference it can hold you
[1:36:28] back but it's not what gives you New
[1:36:30] Life the scripture tells us how to be
[1:36:33] baptized so it matters how we're
[1:36:35] baptized amen but what matters most is
[1:36:39] are you baptized into the body of Christ
[1:36:42] because without that we're
[1:36:43] lost so if we take all those four
[1:36:45] scriptures we just
[1:36:47] read saying baptizing them into the name
[1:36:51] and then saying be baptized in the name
[1:36:53] and then being baptized into one body
[1:36:55] and then saying that one body is Christ
[1:36:57] if we put all of those together if
[1:36:59] you'll grant me a little bit of
[1:37:00] mathematical leverage this morning we
[1:37:03] can take if a is equal to B and B is
[1:37:05] equal to C then we can substitute a for
[1:37:07] C right right right Jonathan yes we can
[1:37:12] so we come up with a very simplified
[1:37:13] scripture where he says go then and make
[1:37:16] disciples of all the nations baptizing
[1:37:18] them into what is the name of the father
[1:37:21] Son and Holy Ghost Jesus Christ
[1:37:23] baptizing them into Jesus Christ how by
[1:37:27] receiving the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:37:29] baptism that he came with lots of
[1:37:31] baptisms before that but this is the
[1:37:34] only one that'll make the big
[1:37:35] difference he says you got to make
[1:37:37] disciples how do you make a disciple
[1:37:40] what what determines if we're a disciple
[1:37:42] or not we live by the word Jesus said he
[1:37:44] said if ye continue in my word then are
[1:37:47] ye my disciples indeed you got to live
[1:37:49] according to the word and we already
[1:37:51] read Ezekiel 36 that said the only only
[1:37:53] way you can live by the word is if you
[1:37:55] have the spirit of God in you that's the
[1:37:56] thing that'll make you watch in his stat
[1:37:58] walk in his statutes and judgments so it
[1:38:00] takes the spirit of God to live the word
[1:38:01] of God which is what makes you a
[1:38:03] disciple so you can't be a disciple
[1:38:05] unless you've got the holy spirit so
[1:38:07] what was Jesus saying he was saying get
[1:38:09] them into me get them into Christ The
[1:38:11] Living Word water baptism no matter how
[1:38:14] perfectly done will not make you live
[1:38:16] according to the word you need a new
[1:38:18] heart you need a new spirit to get along
[1:38:20] with God to change your desires and then
[1:38:22] you need the spirit of God to come in
[1:38:23] and make those things all live so when
[1:38:27] we look at acts 238 that is the
[1:38:29] Fulfillment of Matthew 28:19 because
[1:38:31] remember Jesus said to Peter he says I'm
[1:38:33] giving you the keys to the
[1:38:34] kingdom however you unlock it is how
[1:38:37] I'll unlock it and whatever you unlock
[1:38:38] on Earth I'll unlock in heaven and vice
[1:38:40] versa so Peter's words on the day of
[1:38:43] Pentecost acts 238 is the Fulfillment of
[1:38:46] Matthew 28:19 so that if we want to
[1:38:49] interpret Matthew 28:19 we just jump up
[1:38:51] to acts 238 and that is the way that
[1:38:53] Jesus intended it so if you're baptized
[1:38:56] in titles you're baptized
[1:38:59] wrong cuz G because Peter never baptized
[1:39:02] in the titles he baptized in the name of
[1:39:04] Jesus Christ you can't find a single
[1:39:07] place in scripture where anybody
[1:39:08] baptized in anything other in the name
[1:39:10] of Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus you
[1:39:13] can't find it that's the interpretation
[1:39:16] of the scripture is how they did it not
[1:39:18] by how we believe it by we I mean a
[1:39:21] denomination or something like that they
[1:39:23] interpret it but then you look at the
[1:39:25] interpretation by the apostles and it
[1:39:26] was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:30] amen it matters how we're
[1:39:33] baptized Paul goes to Ephesus or
[1:39:36] Corinth no he came to Ephesus it came to
[1:39:39] pass that when while Apollos was at
[1:39:40] Corinth Paul having passed through the
[1:39:42] upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding
[1:39:44] certain disciples he said unto them have
[1:39:46] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:39:48] believed the word had come to them and
[1:39:50] he says have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:39:52] yet and they said unto we have not so
[1:39:54] much as heard whether there be any Holy
[1:39:55] Ghost they said what are you talking
[1:39:57] about we haven't heard nobody's preached
[1:39:58] to us about the Holy Ghost and he said
[1:40:00] unto them unto what then were ye
[1:40:03] baptized see this was the litness of how
[1:40:06] far they' gone with the
[1:40:08] word it says and they said un John's
[1:40:11] baptism so they have received the word
[1:40:13] they received the message of John they
[1:40:15] were in line to receive eternal life but
[1:40:18] the word had moved on from John's
[1:40:20] message they were sincere they were
[1:40:23] children children of God they were
[1:40:24] living according to the message they
[1:40:25] have received but they were yet in
[1:40:28] ignorance but God doesn't leave us in
[1:40:30] our ignorance he sends the messenger of
[1:40:32] the age directly to their door and says
[1:40:34] have you moved on in the word they say
[1:40:36] we don't even know about this thing
[1:40:37] called the Holy
[1:40:39] Ghost and so then Paul said John ver
[1:40:42] verily baptized with the baptism of
[1:40:44] repentance saying unto the people that
[1:40:47] they should believe on him which should
[1:40:49] come after him that is on Jesus Christ
[1:40:51] so the world have been the word have
[1:40:52] been revealed further but they hadn't
[1:40:55] caught it they weren't around for it but
[1:40:57] now the Holy Spirit comes to them by way
[1:40:59] of Paul and he gets them back in the
[1:41:01] full light of the word and now what's
[1:41:02] the question will you accept it or will
[1:41:04] you not it's a very simple thing it says
[1:41:07] and when they heard this they were
[1:41:09] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:12] brother V I remember you asking this
[1:41:14] question why do we baptize in the name
[1:41:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ not in the name
[1:41:17] of Jesus Christ because Peter said Jesus
[1:41:19] Christ and Paul said Lord Jesus you put
[1:41:21] it together you get Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:24] he says ' and when Paul had laid hands
[1:41:26] upon them the Holy Ghost came on them
[1:41:28] and they spake with tongues and
[1:41:29] prophesied they get baptized the right
[1:41:31] way they've been baptized they followed
[1:41:33] the word as far as they knew how the
[1:41:35] word is further revealed to them it
[1:41:37] corrects their baptism as soon as
[1:41:39] they're baptized Paul lays hands on them
[1:41:40] and they get the Holy Ghost what was
[1:41:42] holding them back not
[1:41:44] sincerity not their
[1:41:46] life they just needed the word and as
[1:41:49] soon as the word came and showed them a
[1:41:51] further level a further stage than then
[1:41:53] they jump into it and all of a sudden
[1:41:54] they receive the promise and they
[1:41:56] receive eternal life right then see
[1:41:58] we've got to walk in the light of the
[1:41:59] word of God the message as we understood
[1:42:02] it in 1970 is not as we understand it in
[1:42:05] 2024 God is continuing to open up his
[1:42:08] word why because he's bringing us into
[1:42:10] resurrection and Rapture that's the
[1:42:12] season we're in and so he's continuing
[1:42:14] to unfold it and there are things that
[1:42:16] we beli back then that maybe we weren't
[1:42:17] quite right maybe we were flat out wrong
[1:42:20] or maybe we just didn't take it far
[1:42:22] enough and we've got to be able to
[1:42:24] Humble ourselves and say there's more
[1:42:26] there's more because I don't have it all
[1:42:28] there's more because I'm not out of here
[1:42:30] there's more because I don't have all
[1:42:31] the victory I need and so we're looking
[1:42:33] for the word of God to come to us and do
[1:42:35] that now notice this now as we start to
[1:42:37] close today we'll pick it up again on
[1:42:38] Wednesday to close it out Lord
[1:42:40] willing Peter says for the promise is
[1:42:43] unto you and to your children and to all
[1:42:47] that are a far off even as many as the
[1:42:49] Lord Our God shall call so is the holy
[1:42:51] spirit only for the apostles
[1:42:54] is it only for the people is it that
[1:42:56] were gathered that day is it only for
[1:42:57] the ministry Peter said it's for
[1:43:00] whosoever is called of God whosoever is
[1:43:03] called of God it's for the children of
[1:43:05] God they might not know they're a child
[1:43:07] of God but that's what the holy spirit's
[1:43:08] doing now is it's going out and it's
[1:43:10] brooding and it's wooing and it's
[1:43:12] calling them in amen it's not just for
[1:43:14] parents it's not just for people raised
[1:43:16] in a religious home it's for the
[1:43:19] children of God that the holy spirit is
[1:43:21] calling back to him amen
[1:43:23] it's not just for the days of the
[1:43:24] Apostles it's for every single age if
[1:43:29] they can hear what the spirit's saying
[1:43:31] they get the reward of the holy spirit
[1:43:33] amen now they had to T and wait for 10
[1:43:36] days until God's timing on the day of
[1:43:39] Pentecost but since then it's always
[1:43:41] been God's time brother Braham says we
[1:43:43] don't have to T anymore you're sitting
[1:43:46] here this morning saying I need the Holy
[1:43:47] Ghost but I've got to wait you're wrong
[1:43:49] it's available this morning we don't
[1:43:51] have to wait it's available able to
[1:43:53] whosoever will this morning the kingdom
[1:43:56] the the door to the kingdom of heaven is
[1:43:57] wide open and it stayed wide open and
[1:43:59] it's open till God shuts it by way of a
[1:44:01] resurrection and Rapture amen I I shared
[1:44:04] a clip with uh some ministerial Brothers
[1:44:07] this week and as Pope Francis telling
[1:44:12] preachers within the Catholic church I
[1:44:14] assume that they were preaching upward
[1:44:16] too long upwards of 20 to 30
[1:44:20] minutes he was admonishing them to
[1:44:22] preach short services and these are his
[1:44:25] exact words he says preachers must must
[1:44:27] preach an idea a feeling and a call to
[1:44:32] action Beyond 8 minutes the preaching
[1:44:34] starts to fade it is not
[1:44:40] understood I think he needs to talk to
[1:44:44] Peter because we would say Peter your
[1:44:46] message is given you've given the
[1:44:48] opportunity you've explained it all now
[1:44:50] it's in their laps they can take it or
[1:44:52] leave it
[1:44:55] Paul preached so long that uus fell out
[1:44:57] of the window
[1:44:59] asleep but what happened Paul went down
[1:45:02] and raised him from the dead and then he
[1:45:04] said get back up in that window and
[1:45:05] we're going to continue the
[1:45:07] service I'm not admonishing that we're
[1:45:09] going to preach long I'm at 67 minutes
[1:45:13] that's since I left my office we're
[1:45:14] doing okay this morning I'm on my last
[1:45:17] page but Peter didn't stop there it says
[1:45:21] and with many other
[1:45:23] words did he testify and exhort saying
[1:45:28] save yourselves from this UNT
[1:45:30] generation I am talking to more and more
[1:45:33] people today in this world and they're
[1:45:35] saying what is wrong with the
[1:45:38] world I was talking to well I just put
[1:45:41] this way I was talking to somebody the
[1:45:43] other day and they said it's just all
[1:45:45] doom and gloom and it seems like we're
[1:45:47] going down down down he said to the
[1:45:50] point where you can't even look at the
[1:45:52] news anymore
[1:45:55] we've got an answer and it's the same
[1:45:56] answer that Peter had save yourselves
[1:45:58] from this untar generation get into
[1:46:01] Christ
[1:46:03] amen it says then they that gladly
[1:46:06] received his word were baptized and the
[1:46:09] same day there were added unto them
[1:46:11] about 3,000 Souls Church how do we add
[1:46:13] Souls not by baptism not by water
[1:46:17] baptism amen you add a soul to the body
[1:46:19] of Christ by the Holy Spirit by one
[1:46:22] spirit were baptized into the body 3,000
[1:46:25] people received the Holy Spirit that
[1:46:27] day on the basis of Peter's testimony
[1:46:30] and exhortation under the anointing of
[1:46:32] the Holy Spirit they obeyed what he said
[1:46:35] they repented they were baptized in the
[1:46:37] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:46:38] of sins and their obedience and their
[1:46:40] actions were accepted by God and he
[1:46:42] confirmed it by giving them the Holy
[1:46:43] Spirit verse 42 says this and they
[1:46:47] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[1:46:49] Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking
[1:46:51] of bread and in prayers amen God bless
[1:46:55] you let's stand this
[1:46:57] morning how do you receive the Holy
[1:47:01] Spirit receive the word for your
[1:47:04] day I don't mean that to say pick and
[1:47:07] choose from the word by any means but
[1:47:09] take what God gives you and act on it
[1:47:12] and apply it and let it live through you
[1:47:14] remember what Jesus said to his
[1:47:15] disciples he says go and
[1:47:18] T Go wait till you get it and don't do
[1:47:21] anything until you get it
[1:47:23] that was the word for their day they had
[1:47:25] been baptized they had repented he says
[1:47:28] now you go and wait because I've got a
[1:47:30] time
[1:47:31] appointed he never told anyone else to
[1:47:34] do that the word for their day was go
[1:47:36] and wait until you get it and after that
[1:47:39] he never tells anyone else the word for
[1:47:40] their day was you got to go and wait
[1:47:42] until I come and give you the promise
[1:47:45] after that Peter says just do what we
[1:47:46] did and you'll get the same thing except
[1:47:49] the word except what he's telling you
[1:47:51] this morning
[1:47:53] repent be baptized the right way in the
[1:47:55] name of Jesus Christ and you'll get the
[1:47:58] holy
[1:47:59] spirit it's that simple it's that simple
[1:48:03] now some brothers May disagree with
[1:48:06] me but I'll say this I believe you can
[1:48:08] get the Holy Spirit just about anywhere
[1:48:11] if the word comes your way and you
[1:48:12] receive
[1:48:13] it you can get the Holy Spirit but it
[1:48:16] will lead you into all truth it will not
[1:48:19] leave you where you're at
[1:48:23] some people believe you can only get the
[1:48:24] Holy Ghost in this message no I believe
[1:48:26] that the Holy Ghost will lead you to
[1:48:28] this message amen but there are many
[1:48:31] sincere people out there that are
[1:48:32] children of God and they're coming this
[1:48:35] way what is it it's the Holy Spirit
[1:48:37] leading and guiding them but he's got to
[1:48:39] get a hold in their life first and so he
[1:48:41] takes them out of where they are and he
[1:48:43] brings them into truth
[1:48:45] amen that's the power we're looking for
[1:48:48] that's resurrection power that's Rapture
[1:48:50] power that's healing power that's saving
[1:48:52] power that's changing power that's
[1:48:54] overcoming power amen that's what we
[1:48:57] need not just Doctrine not just coming
[1:48:59] to church but we need the very life of
[1:49:01] Jesus Christ inside of us amen we'll
[1:49:04] cover this a little more on Wednesday
[1:49:06] Lord willing get into how do we get it
[1:49:08] Beyond this what does it look like what
[1:49:09] does the timeline look like and then
[1:49:11] we'll start to get into how do I even
[1:49:12] know I have the Holy Ghost scripture
[1:49:14] says make your calling and election sure
[1:49:16] in other words check up make sure that
[1:49:18] your life matches what the word says you
[1:49:20] ought to have if you're a Believer and
[1:49:22] that's really really how we're going to
[1:49:23] focus on this series for the next couple
[1:49:25] of services Lord willing amen let's just
[1:49:27] bow our heads if we would Lord God Lord
[1:49:31] I love the clarity of your word Lord I
[1:49:33] love the Simplicity of your word Lord
[1:49:36] where if we do what you say we get what
[1:49:38] you told us we get Lord and you told us
[1:49:41] that if we'd sincerely repent Lord we'd
[1:49:43] be baptized the right way Lord that you
[1:49:45] would give us the gift of the Holy
[1:49:47] Spirit not by our works not by our
[1:49:50] righteousness not by our goodness Lord

[1:50:01] spirit in their life Lord they would
[1:50:03] recognize the Simplicity Lord that they
[1:50:06] would fully surrender their lives to you

[1:50:10] life-changing power of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:12] Come into

[1:50:25] people Lord I pray you give them
[1:50:27] overcoming power Lord that you would
[1:50:29] separate them out Lord that you would
[1:50:31] keep them clean and uncluttered from the
[1:50:33] things of this world Lord I pray for
[1:50:36] those that are out and about Lord that
[1:50:38] need to come back in Lord we pray that
[1:50:40] your spirit would just be wooing them
[1:50:42] that it would be brooding over them that

[1:50:47] Lord until they can come back into your
[1:50:49] presence and be baptized into the body
[1:50:51] of Christ Lord I pray for those that
[1:50:54] have your spirit this
[1:50:55] morning Lord that they would be refilled
[1:50:59] Lord that they would be resaturated with
[1:51:01] your presence Heavenly Father Lord that
[1:51:04] where we're dry and worn out where we're
[1:51:06] weary Lord where we've lost the joy of

[1:51:11] back in Lord not our soul our soul is
[1:51:14] sealed Lord but you would pour yourself
[1:51:16] on our spirit and on our flesh Lord that
