[56:07] understand brother carr
[56:10] sister

[56:16] few others in the church they've got

[56:22] so keep them in prayer amen so the lord
[56:25] be with them today i i don't know if
[56:27] they'll be gathering much today but
[56:30] they're
[56:30] not not gathering today in the church

[56:37] there there were no they weren't allowed
[56:39] to get together no church was allowed to

[57:44] we pray minister to each heart and soul
[57:46] we ask in jesus christ's name we pray
[57:48] amen god bless you thank you musicians
[57:51] if you'll turn the scriptures to titus
[57:53] ii titus the second chapter and
[57:55] this morning i have notes but no slides
[57:57] i felt i was safe
[57:59] as of nine o'clock last night but
[58:01] apparently i was not so i didn't do
[58:03] slides i'm sorry so i'll try and go a
[58:05] little bit more slowly certainly on the
[58:06] quotes when you can read it i i usually
[58:08] rip through it pretty quickly but this
[58:10] morning we'll we'll try and take our
[58:12] time a bit amen
[58:14] titus 2
[58:16] verse 1
[58:17] it says but speak thou the things which
[58:19] become sound doctrine that the aged men
[58:22] be sober grave temperate sound in faith
[58:26] in charity impatience the aged women
[58:28] likewise that they be in behavior as
[58:30] becometh holiness not false accusers not
[58:33] given to much wine teachers of good
[58:35] things that they may teach the young
[58:37] women to be sober to love their husbands
[58:39] to love their children to be discreet
[58:41] chaste keepers at home good obedient to
[58:44] their own husbands that the word of god
[58:47] be not blasphemed amen god bless his
[58:49] word you may be seated we spent the last
[58:51] couple of services speaking on bride
[58:53] authority we showed how the bride of
[58:55] christ receives authority she does not
[58:57] take it it's not something that she
[58:58] wrestles with it's not something that
[59:00] she fights for but it is something that
[59:02] is given to her amen and that we know
[59:04] that christ is the one that has the
[59:06] power it is christ that has the strength
[59:07] that is christ that has the abilities
[59:09] and all we are doing is we are going to
[59:11] him and we're taking advantage of what
[59:13] he has to apply to our situations and
[59:15] into our lives amen he gives us
[59:17] authority to call him on the scene amen
[59:19] and we talked about the token as brother
[59:21] ellie mentioned his prayer that we hold
[59:23] that token before us when we go into
[59:24] prayer and that is what proof that he
[59:26] has given us the authority to ask for
[59:28] things and to receive what we would ask
[59:30] for amen but we talked about when it
[59:33] comes to bride authority that the key to
[59:35] it is always that trusting and loving
[59:37] relationship amen and it's not just him
[59:39] to us but it is us to him the thing that
[59:42] god's doing on this earth right now is
[59:43] he's getting us into a place where we
[59:45] will trust him completely because if we
[59:47] will have full obedience we have to have
[59:49] full trust amen we've got to believe
[59:51] that the word is and will do what it
[59:53] says it will do amen we've got to
[59:54] believe that god is who he says he is
[59:57] and that he has the power to do the
[59:58] things that that we would want him to do
[1:00:00] so the greater trust that he has for us
[1:00:03] the greater the authority that he gives
[1:00:05] us but again it's got to be that we
[1:00:07] trust him because with that authority
[1:00:09] has to come trust to do it the way he
[1:00:11] would want to in the way that he's asked
[1:00:12] us to rather than pulling things to
[1:00:14] ourselves and doing it in our own
[1:00:16] strength amen and you're of no use to
[1:00:18] god if you don't trust them because
[1:00:20] there's going to be times where god says
[1:00:22] what
[1:00:23] no
[1:00:24] we're going to go to him in prayer about
[1:00:25] a situation we're going to go to him
[1:00:26] with the request and god is going to say
[1:00:28] one of two things sometimes he'll say no
[1:00:30] or he'll say wait and that's where the
[1:00:32] trusting relationship comes in is
[1:00:34] because you trust that he sees something
[1:00:36] that you don't see you trust that he has
[1:00:38] a bigger picture in mind and so you're
[1:00:40] willing to wait on the lord rather than
[1:00:42] try and ram it through by just i'm a
[1:00:44] christian i'm a bride of christ in these
[1:00:46] different things and say you owe it to
[1:00:47] me you said whatever i asked i give it
[1:00:49] to you no we have that trusting
[1:00:51] relationship with them where when he
[1:00:53] says just hold on a second son hold on a
[1:00:55] second daughter that we are resting in
[1:00:57] that that he's going to do what it what
[1:00:59] needs to be done in that situation at
[1:01:00] the right time amen
[1:01:02] so if even if we trust him completely he
[1:01:05] has to trust us as well and that is done
[1:01:07] by what proving you over time he puts
[1:01:09] you into situations to see what you're
[1:01:11] going to do to see if you'll stick to
[1:01:12] the word to see if your full obedience
[1:01:14] will shine through or if your human
[1:01:16] nature if your human character will
[1:01:18] bleed through and he knows that he's got
[1:01:20] to work with you a little bit more
[1:01:21] before he puts you into a higher level
[1:01:23] of authority and trust amen because we
[1:01:25] don't run around doing everything in
[1:01:27] jesus name do we we've got to do what he
[1:01:29] wants us to do in his name amen we have
[1:01:31] to be focused on the kingdom purpose not
[1:01:33] on our own purpose and that's what he's
[1:01:35] looking to see in us amen like we talked
[1:01:37] about last service we read the quote
[1:01:39] where brother branham said we'd have to
[1:01:40] pray in every situation amen well what
[1:01:43] are we doing we're going and we're
[1:01:44] talking to our husband we're going and
[1:01:46] talking to the bridegroom and saying
[1:01:48] what do you want us to do in this
[1:01:49] situation you've given us
[1:01:51] you've given us authority you've given
[1:01:53] us gifts you've given us discernment
[1:01:54] you've given us knowledge you've given
[1:01:56] us all these things but what do you want
[1:01:57] us to do in this situation because we're
[1:01:59] still bound in a body that's two-thirds
[1:02:02] uh unredeemed amen and unredeemable if
[1:02:04] we could put it that way amen but just
[1:02:07] as a quick refresh remember the
[1:02:08] authority we're under
[1:02:10] is what tells us how much power is
[1:02:11] available to back up what we're doing
[1:02:13] amen and so when we come under god's
[1:02:15] authority we have unlimited power
[1:02:17] because we read that all power in heaven
[1:02:19] and on earth is given to him so if we
[1:02:21] can come under god's authority then
[1:02:23] guess what we have all power in heaven
[1:02:25] and earth is behind us to back us up as
[1:02:27] long as we are in his kingdom authority
[1:02:29] amen as long as we are doing it for the
[1:02:31] purpose of his kingdom but what happens
[1:02:33] is when we go under our own authority
[1:02:35] then we are our own limitation and as i
[1:02:38] pointed out we have a certain amount of
[1:02:39] power we have power to create we have a
[1:02:42] power to make to manufacture we have
[1:02:44] power to choose how we eat power to make
[1:02:46] money and how to spend it and when we
[1:02:47] look at that so often we do so poorly
[1:02:50] and that's why god doesn't give us power
[1:02:52] right he gives us authority and then he
[1:02:53] chooses to apply that power or not apply
[1:02:55] it amen and the other thing is is that
[1:02:58] when you're on your own side when you're
[1:02:59] under your own authority then you're not
[1:03:01] on god's side are you so there's only
[1:03:03] one other authority that you're under
[1:03:04] then and that's going to be satan's
[1:03:05] every time when we fall into our own
[1:03:07] thinking when we fall into our own ways
[1:03:09] when we fall into man's ways of doing
[1:03:11] things we are putting ourselves on
[1:03:13] satan's side every time we don't like to
[1:03:15] think that but that's what's happening
[1:03:16] because if you're not for god then
[1:03:18] you're against god there is no offense
[1:03:20] right the fence belongs to satan if
[1:03:21] you're on the fence you're on satan's
[1:03:23] side because you haven't committed to
[1:03:24] god right so he's got to know that
[1:03:26] you're going to be on his side and doing
[1:03:28] what you're doing amen
[1:03:29] so that's what we were preaching to the
[1:03:30] whole congregation that's to the
[1:03:32] brothers and sisters collectively as the
[1:03:33] bride of christ but we want to bring it
[1:03:35] down now to our sisters specifically
[1:03:38] because the the principles that we
[1:03:39] talked about of a trusting relationship
[1:03:41] a loving relationship they come right
[1:03:43] down into where our sisters live every
[1:03:45] single day and we want to tie that in
[1:03:47] there and the the principle of a
[1:03:48] trusting relationship is the key to all
[1:03:50] of this and that's that your husband is
[1:03:52] going to have to trust you your father
[1:03:54] if you're a single sister is going to
[1:03:55] have to trust you before he gives you
[1:03:57] any authority in the family name and
[1:03:58] those different things amen so the key
[1:04:01] here is us men have to earn that trust
[1:04:03] god doesn't have to earn it god is god
[1:04:05] amen he is the great sovereign one he's
[1:04:07] yeah we were made for him right and so
[1:04:10] he doesn't have to earn it he proves
[1:04:11] himself he proves himself by his word
[1:04:13] but us men are in a fallen condition so
[1:04:15] we're asking the women to trust us and
[1:04:18] we have to earn that trust don't we we
[1:04:19] have to day by day show that we put the
[1:04:22] concerns and the cares of the family and
[1:04:23] the body of christ above our own because
[1:04:26] by nature we're selfish so we have to
[1:04:27] earn it and so the men are having to do
[1:04:30] a work there and then the women have to
[1:04:31] what have faith that we're going to do
[1:04:33] the right thing and even after we don't
[1:04:35] do the right thing they still have to
[1:04:37] keep having faith that we're going to do
[1:04:38] the right thing that god will continue
[1:04:40] to grow us and and teach us and mature
[1:04:42] us to the point where they can trust us
[1:04:44] fully where what they trust us as much
[1:04:46] as we trust them right it's got to be
[1:04:48] back and forth for both of them
[1:04:50] now we open with this scripture and
[1:04:52] titus for a reason and i want to dive
[1:04:54] into it a little bit a little bit deeper
[1:04:55] because we have to know our position to
[1:04:57] know our authority like we said before
[1:04:59] if i work for the prime minister's
[1:05:01] office i have the power of the prime
[1:05:02] minister behind me but if i work at
[1:05:04] canadian tire i have the manager of
[1:05:06] canadian tires authority behind me i'm
[1:05:08] limited by my position so i have to know
[1:05:10] my position inside the relationship that
[1:05:13] i'm in amen and if i can know my
[1:05:15] position then what's going to happen
[1:05:17] then i can act within it and then i
[1:05:18] don't make a big mess of things and i
[1:05:20] don't get out of out of my place i mean
[1:05:22] if i'm at my job and i start trying to
[1:05:24] act like my boss the director what
[1:05:26] happens i make a big mess for my
[1:05:28] director i i i uh you know cause my
[1:05:31] coworkers to not think very highly of me
[1:05:33] and i make a mess of my own life as well
[1:05:35] don't i because i'm trying to act in his
[1:05:37] stead when i don't have that position
[1:05:39] but when i can stay in my position then
[1:05:41] all of a sudden things work really well
[1:05:43] because i'm acting within the authority
[1:05:45] that i have in my own job right what is
[1:05:47] it when i get out of place it causes
[1:05:48] trouble above me and below me and with
[1:05:51] me but if i can stay in my position that
[1:05:53] things tend to work out beautifully
[1:05:56] so brother braham says this in the
[1:05:57] message the easter seal he says jesus
[1:05:59] was so full of quickening power he said
[1:06:02] if you can destroy this temple that took
[1:06:04] you 40 years you thought to build i'll
[1:06:06] raise it up in three days
[1:06:08] why why could jesus say that he knew
[1:06:11] that he was amen i wish i could make
[1:06:13] that stick he knew who he was he knew
[1:06:16] that every word god had wrote in there
[1:06:18] of him he had fulfilled it
[1:06:20] amen he knew he was the one david spoke
[1:06:23] of do you know you're the one the bible
[1:06:25] speaks of do you know your position is
[1:06:28] in christ if you're in christ you're a
[1:06:30] new creature do you know that this word
[1:06:33] is just like everyday living to you
[1:06:35] is the word everyday living to us that's
[1:06:37] what it's supposed to be
[1:06:39] why sure it's yours you're an eagle
[1:06:41] that's your food and he knew that by the
[1:06:44] power of god he would do it because it
[1:06:47] was prophesied he would do it he didn't
[1:06:49] know it because he thought about it and
[1:06:51] he sat down for a while and said you
[1:06:53] know what let's let them kill me and
[1:06:54] then i'll raise up but he went into the
[1:06:56] word he found his position and as he
[1:06:59] fulfilled that position and he saw it
[1:07:01] coming to pass in his life he said that
[1:07:03] means the rest of it's got to come to
[1:07:05] pass as well so if because it's happened
[1:07:07] now let me take it into the future and i
[1:07:10] can speak with confidence that the thing
[1:07:12] that is impossible is going to happen
[1:07:14] because it is prophesied of me
[1:07:17] because he has proven who i am that
[1:07:19] means the rest of what he said i'm going
[1:07:20] to be is going to happen as well amen
[1:07:23] that's the reason he wasn't scared to
[1:07:25] say destroy this temple and i'll raise
[1:07:27] it up in three days because david said
[1:07:29] i'll not leave his soul in hell neither
[1:07:32] will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:07:34] corruption
[1:07:35] he knowed not one cell of his body could
[1:07:38] corrupt and it corrupts in 72 hours so
[1:07:41] he said destroy this temple i'll raise
[1:07:43] it up again in them three days why he
[1:07:45] was so full of that quickening power
[1:07:48] that quickened every word
[1:07:51] didn't quicken his every thought it
[1:07:52] didn't quicken his every idea but it
[1:07:54] quickened every word that was written
[1:07:56] about him in his life even into his very
[1:08:00] body amen he says he looked back and saw
[1:08:03] every word god wrote to him and the
[1:08:05] prophet said he fulfilled it and he know
[1:08:07] that will be fulfilled too amen he found
[1:08:10] himself in the word he recognized his
[1:08:13] position and he stepped right into it
[1:08:15] and with full confidence he said you'll
[1:08:18] kill me but i'll raise up in three days
[1:08:20] what a thing to say amen never happened
[1:08:22] before that somebody gave his life and
[1:08:24] rose himself of what his own word but
[1:08:27] yet he was willing to do it so i want
[1:08:29] you to see three things here jesus knew
[1:08:32] what was written about him in the word
[1:08:34] he knew his word position
[1:08:37] right not because his family said so not
[1:08:39] because his colleagues said so not
[1:08:40] because his disciples said go said so
[1:08:43] but he went into the word and he said
[1:08:44] the word says this is what i am and it's
[1:08:46] proven in my life
[1:08:48] and then he knew that he was living out
[1:08:50] what was written about him in the
[1:08:52] scripture now jesus knew his scriptural
[1:08:54] boundaries because remember when he gets
[1:08:56] up in the temple and he reads from
[1:08:58] isaiah he doesn't read the full
[1:09:00] scripture because he knows his position
[1:09:03] is now to do something different than
[1:09:05] what the end of that scripture said when
[1:09:07] he comes back what in the tribulation in
[1:09:10] the millennium that's when he gets to go
[1:09:12] to do the last half of that scripture so
[1:09:14] he stops in the word because he's what
[1:09:17] he's bound by the word the word is
[1:09:19] setting up a boundary on his first
[1:09:21] coming and he cannot cross that boundary
[1:09:23] and still be what he says he is he
[1:09:25] sticks with what the word says about him
[1:09:28] amen he knows where it's supposed to be
[1:09:31] he's not there they're under oppression
[1:09:33] they could have used that messiah that's
[1:09:35] coming in the tribulation in the
[1:09:36] millennium couldn't they they were ready
[1:09:38] for it but that was not his place but if
[1:09:41] he had listened to the people around him
[1:09:43] if he had listened to peter that kept
[1:09:44] drawing his sword if he had talked to
[1:09:46] the zealots and listened to them they
[1:09:48] would have said you've got the power
[1:09:50] deliver us from the romans but in the
[1:09:52] word he knew he couldn't do that he was
[1:09:54] bound he had boundaries on his position
[1:09:57] though he was a god-man amen
[1:10:00] and then what the third thing is that he
[1:10:01] knew that if he did what the word told
[1:10:03] him he must do the rest of the word
[1:10:06] written about him would be fulfilled
[1:10:08] remember brother braham says full
[1:10:10] obedience is what entitles you to the
[1:10:12] token right and the token is what's
[1:10:14] going to take us all the way through
[1:10:15] isn't it the token is what's going to
[1:10:17] give you power to stand when everyone
[1:10:19] else falls the token is what's going to
[1:10:20] give you patience when everybody else is
[1:10:22] all fussing and fighting right the pa
[1:10:24] the holy ghost is what gives you rest
[1:10:26] when everyone else is in chaos right
[1:10:29] that's what's going to take us through
[1:10:30] amen you have to know your word position
[1:10:32] and that's what jesus was showing there
[1:10:34] is i know who i am and i know the
[1:10:36] limitations i have
[1:10:38] we've got to know that there are
[1:10:39] limitations to our position amen we
[1:10:42] don't run around taking off satan's
[1:10:43] property satan has property that belongs
[1:10:46] to him
[1:10:47] satan's seed belongs to satan god's seed
[1:10:50] belongs to god so if we find god's seed
[1:10:52] then we take them but if it's satan's
[1:10:54] seed we leave them amen that's up to
[1:10:55] satan to take care of we have to know
[1:10:57] our position if you're a pastor you have
[1:10:59] a word position and you have boundaries
[1:11:01] to that position now the funny thing
[1:11:03] about positions is you have to have
[1:11:05] qualifications and then you also have
[1:11:07] limitations and then you have benefits
[1:11:09] within there so a pastor has to marry a
[1:11:11] certain type of woman he has to have
[1:11:13] children he has to have a family he has
[1:11:15] to act a certain way he has to have a
[1:11:17] certain reputation and he can't have
[1:11:19] certain vices they're not allowed in his
[1:11:21] life there are qualifications there are
[1:11:23] boundaries to that position but if he
[1:11:26] meets those qualifications and he has
[1:11:28] the call of god in his life he can step
[1:11:30] in there and he gets benefits from it
[1:11:32] right and the people benefit from him
[1:11:34] staying in his position now a pastor
[1:11:37] that runs around evangelizing what is he
[1:11:39] doing he's out of his position because a
[1:11:41] pastor is not an evangelist he's
[1:11:43] supposed to stay and guard and feed the
[1:11:44] sheep
[1:11:45] now you get an evangelist tries to be a
[1:11:47] pastor what's the problem he doesn't
[1:11:49] work very well either he needs to be out
[1:11:51] evangelizing and usually what it really
[1:11:53] is is he doesn't have the pure
[1:11:55] qualifications of a pastor he doesn't
[1:11:57] have that desire to stay home with the
[1:11:58] sheep he has a desire to run around he
[1:12:00] shouldn't be there and so everybody has
[1:12:02] a it causes difficulty in the church
[1:12:04] because of it because he's not really
[1:12:06] where he's supposed to be amen a husband
[1:12:08] and a father has qualifications that are
[1:12:10] required of him amen we think that
[1:12:12] because you can father a child that
[1:12:13] means you should be a father no that's
[1:12:14] not it at all by the scripture you're
[1:12:16] supposed to have qualifications as a
[1:12:18] father there's responsibilities that are
[1:12:20] given to you and you have to be willing
[1:12:22] to apply yourself to meet those
[1:12:23] responsibilities before you ever get
[1:12:25] married before you ever become a husband
[1:12:27] before you ever become a father amen
[1:12:30] so what you have authority over your own
[1:12:32] house but you have no authority over
[1:12:33] somebody else's house do you i have
[1:12:35] authority in my home but i can't go tell
[1:12:37] brother matt what to do in his house i
[1:12:38] can't tell his family how to dress i
[1:12:40] can't tell him where no why because
[1:12:42] that's outside of the boundaries of my
[1:12:44] husband-father relationship right but
[1:12:47] within there i have all sorts of
[1:12:48] authority right i can tell the family
[1:12:50] this is the church we're going to attend
[1:12:52] this is where we're going to live this
[1:12:53] is how i'm going to spend my time this
[1:12:55] is the way i'm going to make a living
[1:12:57] right but i don't have a right to beat
[1:12:58] my wife and children do i
[1:13:00] there are boundaries to that authority
[1:13:02] it doesn't give me full ability to do
[1:13:04] what go against the word i'm bound by
[1:13:05] the word in my conduct of how i run my
[1:13:08] family and how i run my marriage amen
[1:13:10] and our sisters therefore also have a
[1:13:12] position and there are qualifications
[1:13:14] for that position you are a woman and
[1:13:17] that puts you within certain boundaries
[1:13:19] but you have to earn certain rights and
[1:13:21] trust within that that part of true
[1:13:23] womanhood as we talked about before and
[1:13:25] the scripture places boundaries about
[1:13:26] our sisters so we want to talk about
[1:13:28] today what those boundaries are and then
[1:13:31] lord willing in the next service we'll
[1:13:32] talk about what the benefits are within
[1:13:34] there amen but if we can set the
[1:13:35] boundaries and we can work within those
[1:13:37] boundaries and guess what god can bless
[1:13:39] you because you're within his word now
[1:13:41] and when you're in his word position
[1:13:43] then god will give you everything that
[1:13:44] you have needed for that position amen a
[1:13:47] woman has authority in the scriptures
[1:13:49] and we'll get into that she has specific
[1:13:51] authorities she has certain rights she
[1:13:53] has certain responsibilities that god
[1:13:54] has not just called her to do but he has
[1:13:56] ordered her to do he's placed it in her
[1:13:58] wheelhouse to do it's her job to do
[1:14:00] these things and there's a wonderful
[1:14:02] blessing if we'll do that amen
[1:14:05] but just like everyone else she has
[1:14:07] limitations there's nobody in scripture
[1:14:09] has ultimate authority even a prophet
[1:14:11] doesn't have ultimate authority why
[1:14:13] because we are all subject to one thing
[1:14:16] and that is the word the word is the
[1:14:17] only thing that has
[1:14:19] and even the word is a limit to itself
[1:14:21] god bound himself to his own word god
[1:14:23] can't work outside of his word and
[1:14:25] that's a comfort to us because it means
[1:14:27] if we do what he tells us to do he won't
[1:14:29] do something different than what he
[1:14:31] promised to do amen our rest is in his
[1:14:33] constancy not in ours and then we're all
[1:14:35] playing by the same rule book that's the
[1:14:37] beauty of it we're all playing by the
[1:14:38] same rule book so if we read it the same
[1:14:40] way and the holy spirit will quicken it
[1:14:42] the same way then we're going to be in
[1:14:43] good shape aren't we
[1:14:45] now when we start talking about a
[1:14:47] woman's authority in the word we need to
[1:14:48] see where the word points her and then
[1:14:50] we see it want to see where the word
[1:14:52] sets up boundaries we want to see the
[1:14:53] qualifications that require authority
[1:14:55] and when then we want to see after it's
[1:14:57] all said and done the blessings and the
[1:14:58] goodness that come out of that so in
[1:15:00] titus 2 3 it says the age of women
[1:15:02] likewise that they be in behaviors
[1:15:05] becometh holiness not false accusers not
[1:15:07] given to much wine and teachers of good
[1:15:10] things so these are the qualifications
[1:15:11] of a woman that is supposed to teach
[1:15:14] right one is that she is aged but
[1:15:17] there's a bunch of things that come
[1:15:18] after that just because you're older
[1:15:19] doesn't mean that you get to teach
[1:15:21] because there's lots of older women that
[1:15:22] shouldn't be teaching anybody because
[1:15:24] their life was in shambles and they've
[1:15:25] never come under the authority of the
[1:15:26] word amen
[1:15:28] so it says what that they have to have a
[1:15:31] holy lifestyle
[1:15:32] it says not false accusers it means that
[1:15:34] they have to keep their mouth shut
[1:15:35] unless they have all the facts yes amen
[1:15:38] they can't be inclined to going
[1:15:40] overboard with alcohol now i don't think
[1:15:41] that's a problem in most churches
[1:15:44] but i want to point you back to
[1:15:46] something because you know what the
[1:15:47] great was drunk with
[1:15:49] her own fornications and you know what
[1:15:52] that wine is is that is her own ideas
[1:15:54] that she is what taking ahead of her
[1:15:56] headship and then she's sitting there
[1:15:58] and they're they're getting there by
[1:16:00] going against the word of god she's
[1:16:02] drunk on moving against the word of god
[1:16:03] that's what the great was right
[1:16:05] she was doing the things she wanted she
[1:16:07] was drunk on self-will and empowerment
[1:16:10] that's what we're talking about here
[1:16:11] amen so sisters you might be sitting
[1:16:13] there saying well i don't drink but do
[1:16:15] you drink of your own thoughts to the
[1:16:17] point where it puts you in rebellion
[1:16:18] against headship amen take it all away
[1:16:21] we can look at it naturally but we can
[1:16:22] look at it spiritually as well because
[1:16:24] the great was drunk all the time
[1:16:25] and it was drunk because she had no
[1:16:27] headshift she was drunk with her own
[1:16:29] power and her own self-will if we want
[1:16:30] to put it that way amen
[1:16:32] what you have to get out of your
[1:16:34] personal opinion and preferences and put
[1:16:36] it under word authority
[1:16:37] amen and then the last thing it says
[1:16:39] they have to be teachers of good things
[1:16:41] now you can be a teacher of bad things
[1:16:42] as well
[1:16:43] right so there's good things that you
[1:16:45] want to be teaching you don't want to be
[1:16:46] teaching bad habits you want don't want
[1:16:48] to be bringing rebellion you don't want
[1:16:49] to be bringing pain and offense to
[1:16:51] people you want to bring the good things
[1:16:53] of god to them amen
[1:16:55] now i want to stop here and say one
[1:16:57] thing and i have it here in my notes and
[1:16:58] it goes for men and women alike and
[1:17:00] that's that if you're a teacher you're
[1:17:02] going to be humble because a teacher
[1:17:04] will always teach by experience not just
[1:17:06] by theory and the thing is you will not
[1:17:09] teach without having made a mistake in
[1:17:10] your life and so often what you're
[1:17:12] teaching people is don't do what i did
[1:17:15] because there's a price to pay if you do
[1:17:16] what i did and then so you're often
[1:17:18] using your own mistakes of teaching not
[1:17:21] just what well everything's great and
[1:17:23] everything's good and i've never made a
[1:17:24] mistake in my life amen we don't teach
[1:17:26] because we've read the bible we teach
[1:17:28] because we've read the bible and found
[1:17:29] it to be true in our lives amen we want
[1:17:32] the word to be alive to us not just a
[1:17:34] theory and so humility is the key in
[1:17:36] teaching because it keeps you from being
[1:17:38] put on a pedestal either by your own
[1:17:40] self or by the people that are listening
[1:17:42] to you if all i did was get up here and
[1:17:44] point it to my good qualities the
[1:17:45] inclination could be to raise me up same
[1:17:47] thing with any other minister brother
[1:17:49] gerald or what not if all we did was got
[1:17:50] up here and talked about the good things
[1:17:52] god was doing in our life and never
[1:17:53] showed how god has humbled us how we've
[1:17:55] made mistakes how we've had to backtrack
[1:17:57] how we've had to realize that we were
[1:17:59] doing things of our own leadership and
[1:18:00] not holy ghost leadership then we'd have
[1:18:02] a lot of problems right but we've got to
[1:18:04] keep ourselves humble as we're doing
[1:18:06] that teaching amen the simple fact is if
[1:18:08] you're teaching and you feel you've
[1:18:10] never made a mistake you're either naive
[1:18:13] in thinking you haven't or you're
[1:18:14] ignorant because you don't even realize
[1:18:16] you have already amen we've got to be
[1:18:18] humble when they do that
[1:18:20] in verse 4 it says that they may teach
[1:18:22] the young women to be sober to love
[1:18:24] their husbands to love their children to
[1:18:26] be discreet chaste keepers at home good
[1:18:30] and obedient to their own husbands that
[1:18:31] the word of god be not blaspheme
[1:18:34] now we're talking about a woman's
[1:18:35] position and paul starts to go into now
[1:18:37] the characteristics that he's asking the
[1:18:39] older women to teach the younger women
[1:18:41] now remember if you have to be taught
[1:18:43] that means it doesn't come naturally
[1:18:45] just because you have the holy ghost
[1:18:46] doesn't mean that you have every
[1:18:47] character or characteristic that you
[1:18:50] have need of right because why we're
[1:18:52] being changed from glory to glory word
[1:18:54] upon word line upon line there's a life
[1:18:56] that's being built there's a character
[1:18:58] that's been perfected in our lives so he
[1:19:00] says this is something that is taught
[1:19:03] right some of it you have by nature and
[1:19:05] some of it you've got to overcome that's
[1:19:07] what character is is a victory if we
[1:19:08] remember amen
[1:19:09] so what so some of these are specific to
[1:19:12] just being a woman in her word position
[1:19:14] if you're in your position sisters
[1:19:15] you're going to have these
[1:19:16] characteristics and he starts with sober
[1:19:19] it means to restore one to her senses to
[1:19:21] moderate to control to curb to disciple
[1:19:25] and to hold one to her duty
[1:19:27] loving
[1:19:28] we know what loving means i don't think
[1:19:30] we need to go too much further into that
[1:19:32] but discreet means of a sound mind sane
[1:19:36] in one's senses curbing one's desires
[1:19:39] and impulses self-controlled and
[1:19:42] temperate meaning there's no wild swings
[1:19:44] in the way you act that there's a
[1:19:45] constancy in your attitude in your
[1:19:47] approach to things
[1:19:49] now chase means that your
[1:19:51] your exciting reverence meaning that
[1:19:53] your life causes people and yourself to
[1:19:56] be reverent not irreverent
[1:19:59] venerable sacred pure from carnality
[1:20:02] modest immaculate and clean
[1:20:05] keepers at home means to be caring for
[1:20:07] the house working at home the watcher or
[1:20:10] keeper of the house and taking care of
[1:20:13] household affairs
[1:20:15] good means of a good constitution or
[1:20:17] nature useful pleasant agreeable joyful
[1:20:21] happy excellent distinguished upright
[1:20:23] honorable
[1:20:25] obedient to subject oneself to obey to
[1:20:28] submit to one's control to yield to
[1:20:30] one's admonition or advice that's quite
[1:20:33] a list of qualifications
[1:20:34] i'd say most of those are just standard
[1:20:36] christian qualifications if we're honest
[1:20:38] that's not just for sisters us men ought
[1:20:40] to be
[1:20:41] you know have the majority of those as
[1:20:42] well
[1:20:44] but what there's a pointed emphasis here
[1:20:46] on where and how a woman should spend
[1:20:47] her time i think we've run into some
[1:20:50] issues today because what happens is the
[1:20:51] sisters say well the word doesn't tell
[1:20:54] me i can't do this
[1:20:56] but what they're ignoring is that the
[1:20:57] word does tell you what you should be
[1:20:59] doing so if you're spending your time
[1:21:01] doing something that god doesn't care to
[1:21:03] spend the time to tell you not to do
[1:21:05] rather than not spending your time on
[1:21:07] the things he tells you to do then
[1:21:08] there's a problem because you're
[1:21:10] majoring on a minor that isn't even
[1:21:11] important enough for him to mention
[1:21:13] while ignoring all the things that he
[1:21:14] told you to do in your life and you'll
[1:21:16] see here that he points time and time
[1:21:18] again to sisters stay in your home
[1:21:21] okay now that doesn't mean you have to
[1:21:24] but that's where he says that's where
[1:21:26] you should be focused amen and we'll get
[1:21:28] into that that is not the only
[1:21:29] limitation for a sister and i've got
[1:21:31] scripture after scripture to show you
[1:21:33] where a woman fits outside of the home
[1:21:35] as well but the main area the main
[1:21:37] thrust of where a woman should be
[1:21:39] spending her time is in the care and
[1:21:41] caretaking of the home that's where he
[1:21:43] points her to and as we talked about
[1:21:45] before where paul even goes as far as to
[1:21:47] say that a woman is saved in
[1:21:49] childbearing that that is what keeps her
[1:21:50] out of trouble and keeps her focused on
[1:21:52] the word of god there's a there's
[1:21:54] something that comes with that right so
[1:21:56] paul's saying here sisters focus on this
[1:21:58] when he's talking to titus he's saying
[1:22:00] focus on these things focus on
[1:22:01] developing these characteristics focus
[1:22:03] on learning focus on grow growing here
[1:22:06] and the rest will be added to you right
[1:22:08] if god wants to move you into something
[1:22:10] if god puts a gift in your life if god
[1:22:12] puts a different type of ministry into
[1:22:13] your life that's well but this is where
[1:22:15] your bread and butter is sisters because
[1:22:17] if your attitude is outside of this
[1:22:18] you're going to run into trouble no
[1:22:20] matter where you go no matter what you
[1:22:21] do you've still got to have the attitude
[1:22:23] whether you're married or unmarried you
[1:22:24] still have to have the same attitude the
[1:22:26] sisters are called to have the same
[1:22:28] approach the same atmosphere around them
[1:22:30] the same the same way of doing things
[1:22:32] amen because paul says if you do what
[1:22:34] i'm telling you to do he says it will
[1:22:37] keep you from blaspheming the word of
[1:22:39] god
[1:22:40] that's a serious thing he's saying if
[1:22:41] you get outside of that then you're
[1:22:43] going to have problems and it's going to
[1:22:44] bring a reproach that where blasphemy
[1:22:46] means you'll cause people to speak evil
[1:22:48] of or speak reproachfully to rail at to
[1:22:51] revile or to make defamatory comments
[1:22:53] about the word of god so you bring a
[1:22:55] reproach on the gospel of christ when
[1:22:57] you get outside of those characteristics
[1:23:00] so if you'll focus on them it'll keep
[1:23:01] you out of trouble if you say that's not
[1:23:03] for me i'm going to focus on something
[1:23:04] that god didn't say i couldn't do you're
[1:23:06] going to get into trouble every single
[1:23:08] time
[1:23:09] but if you have those attributes and
[1:23:10] characteristics you'll be a blessing and
[1:23:12] not a stumbling block because you'll be
[1:23:14] representing christ the word beautifully
[1:23:17] amen now that's old-fashioned
[1:23:19] that's old-fashioned what we're talking
[1:23:20] about here is old-fashioned and
[1:23:22] if anybody outside of this church you
[1:23:24] know in the world listen to this they'd
[1:23:26] say they'd say all sorts of things about
[1:23:28] me in particular and you for sitting
[1:23:30] there and listening to it amen but what
[1:23:32] if you want to have authority sisters
[1:23:34] you've got to know your word position if
[1:23:36] you want to have word authority you can
[1:23:37] have all sorts of authority in this
[1:23:38] world if you want it anything a man has
[1:23:40] is available to you but if you want a
[1:23:42] word blessing you've got to stay in your
[1:23:44] word position and it's that simple amen
[1:23:46] that's why i say it's old-fashioned
[1:23:47] because the word is old-fashioned right
[1:23:49] it changes not
[1:23:51] when he said it he kept it and he hasn't
[1:23:53] changed it ever since amen
[1:23:56] so we see what's happening is that we've
[1:23:58] got the same thing happening today where
[1:24:00] they're telling women you have authority
[1:24:02] go take it but they're doing it under a
[1:24:04] title of something else and what is that
[1:24:06] female empowerment right that's the
[1:24:08] bride authority for the word it for the
[1:24:10] world is what they call it female
[1:24:13] empowerment amen and he's telling her
[1:24:15] what that she has greater value greater
[1:24:16] impact greater autonomy greater
[1:24:18] happiness and greater fulfillment by
[1:24:20] stepping out of the word pattern that
[1:24:22] god gave
[1:24:23] right that's what they're saying is
[1:24:24] they're saying get out of the word of
[1:24:25] god they don't say the word of god
[1:24:26] because most of them don't even realize
[1:24:27] that's where this originated in the
[1:24:28] first place and they're saying do this
[1:24:30] and you'll be happier and you'll have a
[1:24:32] better life and you'll be more fulfilled
[1:24:33] in all these different things
[1:24:36] and i will say in response to that and
[1:24:37] i'll say it straight especially to our
[1:24:39] younger sisters if you're looking to
[1:24:40] break the traditional mold of what god
[1:24:42] has called a woman to be you're stepping
[1:24:44] onto antichrist territory right because
[1:24:47] you're stepping outside of the word
[1:24:48] boundaries right if he set a boundary
[1:24:51] you don't get to cross it no matter what
[1:24:53] and we'll get into that a little bit
[1:24:54] more amen but if you step outside of
[1:24:56] that now i'm not saying again that every
[1:24:58] woman has to get married and stay home
[1:24:59] and clean the house in these different
[1:25:00] things we'll see in the scriptures is in
[1:25:02] the next couple of services where god
[1:25:04] has clearly showed there are women that
[1:25:05] had other purposes that paul even
[1:25:07] commissioned women to do certain things
[1:25:09] and he he asked the churches to support
[1:25:11] him and those things and whatnot so
[1:25:12] there is a place outside of this but the
[1:25:14] characteristics of a sister never change
[1:25:16] and that and that is that she has
[1:25:18] to be under the authority of men's
[1:25:20] headship she has to no matter what
[1:25:22] single married it doesn't matter amen
[1:25:25] but i looked this up this is this thing
[1:25:26] on female empowerment and i went to the
[1:25:28] european institute of gender equality
[1:25:32] amen
[1:25:35] female empowerment they say is the
[1:25:37] process by which women gain control and
[1:25:39] power over their own lives and acquire
[1:25:42] the ability to make strategic choices
[1:25:44] now on the face of that that sounds
[1:25:45] great
[1:25:46] who doesn't want that
[1:25:48] right we ought to be able to decide our
[1:25:50] own things right
[1:25:52] and let me point you back to the
[1:25:53] scriptures sisters you do have a choice
[1:25:55] you have a choice to serve god or to
[1:25:57] serve the world
[1:25:59] and if you're going to serve the world
[1:26:00] then by all means go by female
[1:26:01] empowerment if you're going to serve god
[1:26:03] then go but by the way the word but a
[1:26:05] sister even within the word she has a
[1:26:07] choice and that choice is do i accept
[1:26:09] the headship of a husband or do i stay
[1:26:11] stingle and as soon as you say i'm going
[1:26:13] to get married i'll accept that proposal
[1:26:15] you bind yourself by the word to the
[1:26:17] headship of that man whether he's good
[1:26:19] whether he's bad whether he changes in
[1:26:21] your marriage it doesn't matter you're
[1:26:23] bound to that headship because by the
[1:26:25] word is what you're really binding to
[1:26:27] you're not binding to him you're binding
[1:26:28] to him because the word says that's what
[1:26:29] you're supposed to do but if you're
[1:26:31] single now you're bound in headship
[1:26:33] under what your father as long as you're
[1:26:35] under his roof as long as you're eating
[1:26:37] his food and these things you're under
[1:26:39] his head ship the scripture specifically
[1:26:40] says of a young woman under her father's
[1:26:42] roof if you want to leave and you want
[1:26:44] to pay your own rent and buy your own
[1:26:45] food you can do your own thing but now
[1:26:47] you're doing it in your name not your
[1:26:49] father's name and you have to be doubly
[1:26:51] careful of that because now you answer
[1:26:52] directly to god if you go out from under
[1:26:54] your father's headship and that is the
[1:26:56] most dangerous place for most women and
[1:26:58] most of what they do if they're smart is
[1:26:59] they stay close to their dads they say
[1:27:01] dad i i might be out from under your
[1:27:03] roof i might be out from under your
[1:27:05] direct headship i don't talk to you and
[1:27:07] see you every day but i'm going to let
[1:27:09] you be the one that helps guide me
[1:27:10] through or they'll get close to a pastor
[1:27:12] the problem is that's dangerous for the
[1:27:13] pastor and the woman because she's
[1:27:14] single so it caught you know causes some
[1:27:16] issues there so if they're smart and
[1:27:19] they look at what the word says they'll
[1:27:20] stay close to their father because he'll
[1:27:21] help guide her through those key
[1:27:23] decisions in her life right
[1:27:26] but being single doesn't mean you can do
[1:27:28] whatever you want means you what you can
[1:27:30] do whatever you want within the
[1:27:31] scriptural boundaries of a woman no
[1:27:33] matter what you're still bound by the
[1:27:34] word
[1:27:36] this european institute for gender
[1:27:37] equality said the key area of focus is
[1:27:39] women's empowerment has five components
[1:27:42] their sense of self-worth the right to
[1:27:44] have and to determine choices their
[1:27:46] right to have access to opportunities
[1:27:48] and resources their right to have power
[1:27:50] to control their own lives both within
[1:27:53] and outside the home and their ability
[1:27:55] this is key their ability to influence
[1:27:57] the direction of social change to create
[1:28:00] a more just social and economic order
[1:28:04] nationally and internationally
[1:28:06] now that's a lot of big words and what
[1:28:07] he's saying is he said that the final
[1:28:09] linchpin is that they have the power to
[1:28:12] change the way things are be done
[1:28:13] everywhere around the world that's
[1:28:15] that's the linchpin to all this is that
[1:28:17] they have as much influence as men do
[1:28:19] amen
[1:28:20] now i want to contrast that against what
[1:28:22] the prophet said would happen this is
[1:28:24] the end goal of this movement and
[1:28:25] they're going to succeed they're going
[1:28:27] to succeed to where women will run
[1:28:28] everything they practically are in many
[1:28:30] ways now but he says did you know this
[1:28:32] is in the message choosing of a bride do
[1:28:34] you know the fall came by women at the
[1:28:36] beginning
[1:28:37] the end is going to wind up the same way
[1:28:39] women coming into authority and ruling
[1:28:41] over men and so forth he says do you
[1:28:43] know the scripture says that
[1:28:46] in
[1:28:47] the exposition of the seven church ages
[1:28:48] in the laodicean church age he says the
[1:28:50] fifth vision had to do with the moral
[1:28:52] problem of our age centering mostly
[1:28:55] around women god showed me that women
[1:28:57] began to get out of their place with the
[1:28:59] granting of the vote then they cut off
[1:29:01] their hair which signified they were no
[1:29:03] longer under the authority of a man but
[1:29:05] insisted on either equal rights
[1:29:08] that's great or in most cases more than
[1:29:11] equal rights
[1:29:14] this is a prophet speaking
[1:29:16] from from visions that he had 80 years
[1:29:19] ago
[1:29:20] okay and where are we at today
[1:29:23] he says she adopted men's clothing and
[1:29:25] went into a state of undressed until the
[1:29:27] last picture i saw was a woman naked
[1:29:29] except for a little fig leaf type apron
[1:29:32] and with this vision i saw the terrible
[1:29:34] perversion and moral plight of the whole
[1:29:37] world
[1:29:38] so the rallying cry for women's
[1:29:39] empowerment is what rise up cast off
[1:29:42] your change claim your rights you're as
[1:29:43] good as men are or better
[1:29:45] right
[1:29:46] listen we're all in a fallen condition
[1:29:49] there's no one better the men are not
[1:29:50] better than the women the women are not
[1:29:52] better than the men right but we do have
[1:29:54] a position that god tells us to stay in
[1:29:56] and that's the only reason we are where
[1:29:58] we are the only reason mannerism are in
[1:30:00] in authority in a scriptural principle
[1:30:03] is because god put us there not because
[1:30:05] we're better not because we're worse not
[1:30:07] because we're more capable or less
[1:30:08] capable he put us there and that's just
[1:30:10] the simple answer amen we're no better
[1:30:12] we're no worse it's just the way god put
[1:30:14] it and that's what we fall back on amen
[1:30:17] the simple fact is no matter what you
[1:30:19] choose to live your life by you're going
[1:30:21] to have boundaries right you're going to
[1:30:22] have boundaries you're going to create
[1:30:23] your own moral code if you're going to
[1:30:25] live outside the word but you're still
[1:30:27] going to have boundaries there's things
[1:30:28] you won't do and there's things you will
[1:30:29] do and there's things you'll agree with
[1:30:31] and things that you won't agree with
[1:30:32] amen but the thing is what saudi society
[1:30:34] is pushing us towards with no boundaries
[1:30:37] is what they say is what they really
[1:30:38] mean is let's put up boundaries to hold
[1:30:40] back the things we don't like and let's
[1:30:42] knock down the boundaries to get more of
[1:30:44] what we think would be better there's
[1:30:46] still boundaries there but what they're
[1:30:47] doing is now they're saying we're going
[1:30:48] to limit one side of the equation and
[1:30:50] we're going to open it up for the other
[1:30:51] one to try and bring balance into the
[1:30:53] world
[1:30:54] right what they're really doing is
[1:30:55] they're determining what's good and
[1:30:57] what's bad for society the word has no
[1:30:59] place in it good is bad bad is good now
[1:31:01] black is white white is black that's
[1:31:02] where we're at today amen all we can see
[1:31:04] is them determining with their oh i
[1:31:06] don't know where they get it from but
[1:31:07] they're determining what's right and it
[1:31:09] has nothing to do with what god has ever
[1:31:11] said amen
[1:31:12] what they're trying to do catch this
[1:31:14] because they're trying to bring back a
[1:31:15] position of equality listen we're all
[1:31:17] equal in christ there's no male or
[1:31:19] female jew nor greek right bond or free
[1:31:22] amen it doesn't matter in christ but we
[1:31:25] each have a position but what they're
[1:31:27] trying to do is bring us back to
[1:31:28] equality when is the only time that we
[1:31:30] saw true equality eden
[1:31:32] what are they trying to do they're
[1:31:33] trying to bring us back to an eating
[1:31:35] condition without paying the price that
[1:31:36] had to be paid for eden they're trying
[1:31:38] to do it outside of the cross that where
[1:31:40] christ paid the price at calvary right
[1:31:42] they're trying to bring us back to eden
[1:31:44] without recognizing that the very thing
[1:31:46] they're doing is what brought us out of
[1:31:48] eden in the first place they're giving
[1:31:50] power to the woman
[1:31:52] brother branham said this he says now a
[1:31:54] dominating female is the greatest curse
[1:31:56] in the world the wisest man the world
[1:31:59] could ever the world ever saw was
[1:32:01] solomon and he said and he reads the
[1:32:04] scriptures out of ecclesiastes it says i
[1:32:06] applied my heart to know and to search
[1:32:08] and to seek out wisdom and the reason of
[1:32:10] things and to know the wickedness of
[1:32:12] folly even the foolishness and madness
[1:32:14] he was trying to find out why are things
[1:32:16] the way they are why are things as bad
[1:32:18] as they are this is solomon speaking he
[1:32:20] says and i find more bitter than death
[1:32:23] the woman
[1:32:24] whose heart is snares and nets and her
[1:32:27] hands as bands
[1:32:28] who so pleases god shall escape from her
[1:32:32] but the sinner shall be taken by her
[1:32:35] behold this have i found saith the
[1:32:37] preacher count them one by one to find
[1:32:40] out the account which yet my soul
[1:32:42] seeketh but i find not so he's looking
[1:32:44] for a good person he says one man
[1:32:46] amongst the thousand have i found one in
[1:32:49] a thousand for men he says but a woman
[1:32:51] amongst all those have i not found i
[1:32:53] sometimes wonder if solomon hadn't got
[1:32:55] his heart broken when he wrote this you
[1:32:56] know but he says look it's tough to find
[1:32:58] a good man he says it's even tougher to
[1:33:00] find a good woman
[1:33:02] that's an amazing thing i looked up what
[1:33:04] that verse 26 says in the amplified
[1:33:06] bible and it says and i found that of
[1:33:08] all sinful follies none has been so
[1:33:11] ruinous and seducing one away from god
[1:33:13] as idolatrous women
[1:33:15] more bitter than death is the woman
[1:33:17] whose heart is snares and nets and whose
[1:33:19] hands are bands whoever pleases god
[1:33:22] shall escape from her but the sinner
[1:33:24] shall be taken by her and what do we see
[1:33:26] today sinners being taken
[1:33:28] over and over and over again and happy
[1:33:30] to do it happy to be there
[1:33:32] brother bradham continues he says paul
[1:33:34] said i suffer not a woman to us to teach
[1:33:37] or usurp authority but from the garden
[1:33:40] of eden onward man woman has constantly
[1:33:42] and successfully tried to take control
[1:33:44] over the man and right today it is a
[1:33:47] woman's world with the goddess of
[1:33:48] america being a naked female
[1:33:51] as the female idol falling out of the
[1:33:52] skies remember her arms were iron bars
[1:33:55] characterized the first ephesian age so
[1:33:58] her power has grown until she has gained
[1:34:00] absolute authority such authority being
[1:34:03] usurped by her iron disposition
[1:34:06] right they won't back off
[1:34:07] they won't back down they will not be
[1:34:09] under authority they'll go their own way
[1:34:10] remember what brother brahm said when he
[1:34:12] continues in that quote he says an iron
[1:34:14] disposition is what never of the holy
[1:34:15] spirit right it can't be
[1:34:18] so the system they're proposing through
[1:34:19] female empowerment can't work it won't
[1:34:22] work the bible tells us it won't right
[1:34:24] it can't do it that's what happened in
[1:34:25] the ephesian age and it carried all the
[1:34:27] way through and we see it now as the
[1:34:28] great horse sitting on the thrones with
[1:34:30] many kings and these ones with her it
[1:34:32] doesn't work and in the end what happens
[1:34:34] destruction total destruction it brings
[1:34:36] everything down amen nothing will hold
[1:34:38] it up
[1:34:39] why
[1:34:41] we see today even in the age of laodicea
[1:34:43] people's rights you think with people's
[1:34:45] rights everybody would have rights but
[1:34:46] it's not it's only a select group of
[1:34:48] people that have rights and they'll
[1:34:49] trample everybody's else to get there
[1:34:51] amen what is it somebody then other than
[1:34:53] god thinks that it's the right thing to
[1:34:55] do and it just leads us to more problems
[1:34:57] brother braham says this in
[1:35:00] in the message
[1:35:01] oh it's a long one i don't even have it
[1:35:03] on two pages he says let us go back to
[1:35:05] the beginning he's setting a contrast
[1:35:07] here he says in the original physical
[1:35:09] creation as we know it today god made
[1:35:11] everything in pairs male and female
[1:35:13] there were two chickens a rooster and a
[1:35:14] hen there was two cattle the cow and the
[1:35:16] bull and right down the line but when it
[1:35:18] come to man there was only one they were
[1:35:20] not a pair adam had been made in the
[1:35:22] image of god and he was a son of god and
[1:35:24] as a son of god he could not be tempted
[1:35:26] and fall that would be impossible satan
[1:35:29] had no access he had access to adam but
[1:35:31] adam gave him no access if i could put
[1:35:33] it that way adam had no desire to to
[1:35:35] talk it over with the serpent right and
[1:35:38] he says he could not cause adam to fall
[1:35:40] so god took a byproduct of a man to
[1:35:43] cause the fall the woman never stepped
[1:35:45] fresh from the hand of god as a true
[1:35:46] product of god she was produced from man
[1:35:49] and when god caused her to be brought
[1:35:51] forth from men she was vastly different
[1:35:53] from the other females he had created
[1:35:55] she was able to be seduced
[1:35:57] no other female in creation can be
[1:35:59] immoral but the human female may be
[1:36:01] touched at almost any time and that
[1:36:03] weakness in her allowed satan to seduce
[1:36:05] her by way of the serpent and has
[1:36:07] brought the woman to a very peculiar
[1:36:10] position before god in his word
[1:36:12] so brother bram sets up this big
[1:36:14] contrast here because he says the
[1:36:15] animals are all made one way but he says
[1:36:17] when it came to humanity a woman is made
[1:36:19] different than every other creature in
[1:36:20] the world and he says it brings her to a
[1:36:22] peculiar place now watch how he pulls
[1:36:25] this out now
[1:36:26] because he's giving us a big picture he
[1:36:28] says she is the type of all things
[1:36:30] vulgar foul and loathes them on one hand
[1:36:34] and nobody said amen
[1:36:37] but listen he says and on the other hand
[1:36:40] she is the type of all things clean
[1:36:42] beautiful and holy as the receptacle of
[1:36:46] the spirit and blessings of god
[1:36:48] so you can be death and you can be life
[1:36:51] sisters
[1:36:52] on the other hand she is called the
[1:36:54] who is drunk with the wine of her
[1:36:56] fornications and other on the other she
[1:36:59] is called the bride of christ
[1:37:02] on one hand she is called mystery
[1:37:04] babylon the abomination before god and
[1:37:06] on the other hand she is called new
[1:37:08] jerusalem our mother
[1:37:10] on one hand she is so foul and wicked
[1:37:13] and lewd that she is summarily cast into
[1:37:15] the lake of fire as the only fit place
[1:37:18] for her
[1:37:19] and on the other hand she is exalted to
[1:37:22] heaven sharing the very throne of god as
[1:37:25] the only place befitting such a queen
[1:37:29] i ask you today
[1:37:31] what are you choosing
[1:37:33] are you going to choose to go satan's
[1:37:34] where are you going to choose god's way
[1:37:35] because one is foul and loathsome and
[1:37:38] lewd and the other one sits at the right
[1:37:39] hand of power
[1:37:41] as befitting a queen
[1:37:44] amen the beautiful things that i
[1:37:46] underlined here all the good things you
[1:37:47] can't see it on the screen but what it's
[1:37:50] the only thing that takes you to
[1:37:52] god's end goal
[1:37:55] is by submitting to the word that he's
[1:37:56] given to us amen you don't get there by
[1:37:59] stepping outside of the boundaries you
[1:38:00] have to stay within the boundaries to
[1:38:02] get the reward of that position you've
[1:38:04] got to stay in your position is what
[1:38:05] we're talking about amen so what does
[1:38:07] that mean it means you're going to face
[1:38:09] times of disappointment you're going to
[1:38:11] face times of pain discomfort hurts
[1:38:13] suffering even
[1:38:14] neglect
[1:38:16] why because you're under failed headship
[1:38:19] in men
[1:38:20] and so you're going to have to deal with
[1:38:22] that failure while staying in your
[1:38:24] position and that's the test of your
[1:38:26] character and faith that's what it is
[1:38:28] for a sister is to stay there when it's
[1:38:30] not going so good isn't it hey why
[1:38:32] imperfect men are in the place of
[1:38:34] perfect headship
[1:38:35] it doesn't work
[1:38:36] but yet we have to stay there as men we
[1:38:38] have to leave and as women we have to
[1:38:39] submit right
[1:38:42] so the question i'd ask the sisters is
[1:38:43] do you think you could do any better
[1:38:47] everybody would say yes often yes we can
[1:38:49] do better but the simple fact is as men
[1:38:51] are not doing great or poorly because
[1:38:53] they're great we're in a fallen
[1:38:55] condition
[1:38:56] right and a woman's in a fallen
[1:38:57] condition so whether we have a man
[1:38:59] leading or a woman leading we're in a
[1:39:00] fallen condition ain't nobody going to
[1:39:02] do better
[1:39:03] right because why in the end without a
[1:39:05] new birth we're all going to fall back
[1:39:06] on selfishness and we're all going to
[1:39:08] look to ourselves and that's what causes
[1:39:10] destruction is when we do only what is
[1:39:11] good for ourselves we forget the golden
[1:39:13] rule isn't it right so a woman if we
[1:39:16] gave everything over if we men just
[1:39:17] stood up and said you know what women
[1:39:19] take it we're going to reverse roles
[1:39:21] today the world would not go to into
[1:39:23] some utopia why because women are as
[1:39:25] fallen as men are it's never going to
[1:39:27] change what needs to change is what a
[1:39:29] new heaven and a new earth right we got
[1:39:31] to change the whole thing and we got to
[1:39:32] come back with character this time and
[1:39:34] that's the great reset that we're really
[1:39:36] talking about isn't it it's not changing
[1:39:38] our emissions and it's not going to
[1:39:40] electric vehicles and cutting out coal
[1:39:41] power it's what the power of the holy
[1:39:43] spirit burning us out so that we've got
[1:39:45] character to rule and reign with him
[1:39:48] and then we all need the new birth and
[1:39:49] the only way that a man's going to lead
[1:39:51] properly is if he has the new birth
[1:39:53] right he'll still make mistakes but
[1:39:55] he'll do a whole lot better won't he and
[1:39:56] he'll humble himself to the word and
[1:39:58] he'll apologize when he fails and falls
[1:40:00] to the ones that he's supposed to be
[1:40:02] leading and what he'll point back to the
[1:40:04] word every time
[1:40:06] amen amen the path of god's leadership
[1:40:09] is not easy but it has proven results
[1:40:12] amen we've seen it we've seen it with
[1:40:14] those that are around us we've seen it
[1:40:15] in our our grandparents and our parents
[1:40:17] and those that have gone by way of the
[1:40:18] grave already we've seen it in the
[1:40:20] scriptures amen but if we look at
[1:40:22] satan's path it's much easier isn't it
[1:40:24] because you get to do whatever you want
[1:40:26] as long as you don't do the word you're
[1:40:28] in satan's path
[1:40:29] right and it's much easier brother
[1:40:31] braham says this he says in this
[1:40:32] thyatarana church shade she is a
[1:40:34] dominating female she's mystery babylon
[1:40:37] she's the great she's jezebel a
[1:40:39] false prophetess why because the true
[1:40:42] female is submissive to god
[1:40:44] christ is her head she has no word but
[1:40:46] his no thoughts but his no leadership
[1:40:49] but his but what about this church she
[1:40:51] has cast out the word destroyed the
[1:40:53] bibles and worthy essays of the godly
[1:40:56] she has slain those who have preached
[1:40:57] the truth she has taken over kings and
[1:40:59] princes and nations she controls armies
[1:41:02] and insists that she's the true body of
[1:41:04] christ and her popes are the vicars of
[1:41:06] christ
[1:41:07] she is entirely seduced by the devil
[1:41:11] until she in turn has become the seducer
[1:41:13] of others she is the bride of satan and
[1:41:15] has produced his bastard child religions
[1:41:18] he's talking about the catholic church
[1:41:20] there right
[1:41:22] so go tell the world that's where
[1:41:23] they're headed and they'll laugh at you
[1:41:24] they'll say no no no we're just bringing
[1:41:26] back balance
[1:41:28] we're not bringing back balance every
[1:41:30] time you'll see it no matter what in
[1:41:32] churches and companies and whatever when
[1:41:34] they try and fix things what happens is
[1:41:36] they're on this side and they swing way
[1:41:38] past the middle and they go bounce off
[1:41:40] the rev limiter on the other side and
[1:41:41] then they come back in and they just do
[1:41:43] this they just go back and forth
[1:41:45] overcompensating over reaching their
[1:41:47] goal every single time and it's just
[1:41:49] problem after problem after problem it's
[1:41:50] the way humanity is right there's no
[1:41:52] eden to be had by bringing equality the
[1:41:54] way they want to it's not going to
[1:41:56] happen right
[1:41:57] but what are those boundaries
[1:41:59] and why does god put boundaries in why
[1:42:01] does god put boundaries is it to protect
[1:42:03] god
[1:42:04] god puts boundaries in to protect us
[1:42:06] right god puts boundaries in there to
[1:42:08] make it easy in the body if we have
[1:42:10] defined roles and positions and places
[1:42:12] and authorities that makes the body work
[1:42:14] really really well because it means that
[1:42:16] i don't have to step on your toes and
[1:42:17] you don't have to step on mine to do our
[1:42:19] jobs and he did the same thing for men
[1:42:21] and women he put them in these nice
[1:42:22] little beautiful boxes and there is a
[1:42:24] little bit of crossover of grace
[1:42:26] right but generally there's two defined
[1:42:28] boxes and that's so that the two of them
[1:42:30] together work really really well but if
[1:42:31] each of them doesn't know who's supposed
[1:42:33] to do what then you get into problems
[1:42:35] because sometimes we'll fall back on
[1:42:37] capability rather than what the word
[1:42:38] tells us that's when we get into
[1:42:40] problems so often right what does it do
[1:42:43] when god puts us in positions it cuts us
[1:42:45] down on confusion
[1:42:47] it keeps it out of the body keeps it out
[1:42:48] of the marriage it allows you to play
[1:42:50] within your own sandbox
[1:42:52] first timothy 2 says this these we're
[1:42:54] talking about some boundaries now let
[1:42:56] the woman learn in silence with all
[1:42:58] subjection
[1:43:00] you can stay silent but if you're not in
[1:43:01] subjection you're still in trouble
[1:43:02] aren't you
[1:43:04] he says i suffer not a woman to teach
[1:43:05] nor to usurp authority over the man but
[1:43:08] to be in silence for adam was first form
[1:43:10] then eve
[1:43:12] now that doesn't mean anything in and of
[1:43:13] itself but listen to the next verse in
[1:43:15] verse 14 he says for adam was not
[1:43:17] deceived that's where brother branham
[1:43:19] says satan couldn't fool adam because
[1:43:21] adam wasn't deceived that's how you know
[1:43:23] adam couldn't be fooled because he
[1:43:24] wasn't fooled that's the proof right
[1:43:26] that's right adam was not deceived but
[1:43:28] the woman being deceived was in the
[1:43:30] transgression that's where the sin was
[1:43:31] because she was deceived
[1:43:33] notwithstanding she shall be saved in
[1:43:35] childbearing if they continue in faith
[1:43:37] and charity and holiness with sobriety
[1:43:40] and i want you to catch here because he
[1:43:41] sets up two boundaries here and often
[1:43:43] those are misunderstood about why
[1:43:45] they're there and what they look like
[1:43:47] the first thing he says is a woman can't
[1:43:49] teach the men
[1:43:50] that's the first boundary he sets up now
[1:43:52] does that mean a man can't learn
[1:43:54] anything from a woman
[1:43:56] absolutely not
[1:43:57] right does that mean a woman can't tell
[1:43:59] a man something that he doesn't know
[1:44:01] no
[1:44:03] does that mean that a woman can a woman
[1:44:05] remind a man of something he ought to
[1:44:06] know
[1:44:07] of course
[1:44:08] right this isn't about conversations
[1:44:10] that happen about day to day this isn't
[1:44:12] about fellowship but this is
[1:44:13] intentionally looking to sit men down
[1:44:15] and straighten them out
[1:44:17] right that's what we're talking about
[1:44:18] here right it doesn't have to be formal
[1:44:20] it can absolutely be informal and if you
[1:44:23] sit down with the intention of
[1:44:24] correcting men
[1:44:26] brothers are unbelievers it doesn't
[1:44:27] matter by the word of god then it's
[1:44:29] forbidden to the sisters to do that
[1:44:31] that's what he's saying is the woman
[1:44:32] does not handle the word to try and
[1:44:34] correct authority
[1:44:35] why because the man doesn't answer to
[1:44:36] the woman he answers to god so that
[1:44:38] correction comes through god again not
[1:44:40] saying he can't use a woman but she's
[1:44:42] got to be very careful how she's going
[1:44:43] to do it that word teach this is where
[1:44:46] the misunderstanding often is is they
[1:44:48] think well that means you can't preach
[1:44:50] he didn't say preach he said teach
[1:44:53] right they say well you can't get behind
[1:44:54] the pulpit but i can go do it someplace
[1:44:56] else no he says i suffer a woman not to
[1:44:58] teach period
[1:45:00] right it means to be a teacher
[1:45:02] to hold discourse with others in order
[1:45:05] to instruct them so if you're sitting
[1:45:06] down and having a conversation with the
[1:45:09] intent of teaching of instructing
[1:45:11] somebody then you're going to be off the
[1:45:13] word unless you've been given authority
[1:45:15] to do it and we'll get to where that is
[1:45:16] in a second
[1:45:17] to deliver moral instruction
[1:45:20] to tell people they're doing things
[1:45:21] right or wrong is not for a woman to sit
[1:45:23] down and do
[1:45:24] to conduct oneself as a teacher you say
[1:45:26] well i'm not formally a teacher it
[1:45:28] doesn't matter if you're acting in the
[1:45:30] capacity of a teacher in any way and you
[1:45:32] haven't been given the authority to do
[1:45:34] it you are off the word of god sisters
[1:45:36] to impart instruction to instill
[1:45:39] doctrine into one
[1:45:41] to explain or espound a thing or to
[1:45:43] teach one something from the scriptures
[1:45:45] so again there is a place where women
[1:45:47] are allowed to do that but he says when
[1:45:49] it comes to men you're not allowed to do
[1:45:51] it you are not allowed to address or
[1:45:52] instruct the men in anything formally or
[1:45:55] informally
[1:45:57] that's a very tight boundary isn't it
[1:45:58] that's a strong boundary sisters
[1:46:00] i noticed there that it said to conduct
[1:46:02] oneself as a teacher because that was a
[1:46:04] big that really jumped out to me these
[1:46:05] days because of social media because
[1:46:08] what we have here is a sister would
[1:46:09] never presume to do that in person but
[1:46:11] if you put her on social media all of a
[1:46:13] sudden she'll sit there and she'll start
[1:46:14] to do what spread doctrine teach to give
[1:46:16] moral instruction say what she thinks is
[1:46:18] right say what she she thinks is wrong
[1:46:20] and she's doing exactly what paul told
[1:46:21] her not to do he says you're to stay in
[1:46:23] silence on these things right and
[1:46:26] they'll say well i'm not doing it to men
[1:46:27] i'm just putting it on social media but
[1:46:29] if you can't control your audience then
[1:46:31] you're speaking to men
[1:46:33] right if you have men in your social
[1:46:34] media feeds you're speaking to men so
[1:46:36] you you are instructing men whether you
[1:46:38] agree to it or not if they can see it
[1:46:40] then you're instructing them and you're
[1:46:42] not supposed to be doing those things if
[1:46:43] your intention is to teach or deliver
[1:46:45] moral obstruction or expound on the word
[1:46:48] of god you are forbidden to do it if man
[1:46:50] can
[1:46:51] will or could see it that's the
[1:46:54] requirement for her sister she is not to
[1:46:56] give that type of instruction at any
[1:46:58] time
[1:46:59] unless she's given authority to do it by
[1:47:01] a man specifically right and if you're
[1:47:03] going to do it only to women which is
[1:47:05] where you are instructed to do it as we
[1:47:06] read earlier you are what it is given to
[1:47:09] the aged women with a proven life and
[1:47:11] life experience of living and
[1:47:13] experiencing the word of god in their
[1:47:15] personal lives that's who does it amen
[1:47:18] so there's a boundary for a woman to
[1:47:20] teach and it's given to ones that have
[1:47:21] the experience to do it now remember the
[1:47:23] reason i brought up social media is the
[1:47:24] first time i saw this happen was by a
[1:47:28] very well-known message minister's wife
[1:47:31] and she got online and she wrote up a
[1:47:33] post about something and my wife shared
[1:47:35] it with me and i said this ain't gonna
[1:47:37] be good
[1:47:38] and you know what happened
[1:47:40] is a bunch of women flocked to her and
[1:47:42] they started getting all riled up
[1:47:44] and so she riled up all of these women
[1:47:46] and then finally what happened is
[1:47:48] somebody let her husband the minister
[1:47:50] know what was going on and that post
[1:47:52] disappeared like that and she has never
[1:47:53] done it since
[1:47:55] because why she gotta be in her bonnet
[1:47:57] she got on there to give her deliver
[1:47:59] moral instruction to her social media
[1:48:01] followers and she started doing
[1:48:03] something that she wasn't supposed to do
[1:48:05] and it was a rebuke to her it was a
[1:48:07] rebuke to her husband's ministry and it
[1:48:08] was a rebuke to the church that she was
[1:48:10] representing as well she got out of her
[1:48:12] place now did she do it with good intent
[1:48:14] absolutely right maybe she was uh
[1:48:17] frustrated with something that happened
[1:48:19] maybe she there was an injustice there
[1:48:20] that she felt needed to be corrected but
[1:48:22] she took it on herself to do it rather
[1:48:24] than taking it to her husband her head
[1:48:26] and letting him deal with the situation
[1:48:27] she went straight to social media and
[1:48:29] what she do she put a mark on her
[1:48:30] testimony because she stepped out of her
[1:48:32] word position amen
[1:48:35] what is it she was speaking to an
[1:48:36] uncontrolled audience taking the
[1:48:38] corrective role of a teacher and giving
[1:48:40] moral instruction by the word of god and
[1:48:42] she's forbidden to do it in the
[1:48:43] scriptures that's the greatest danger to
[1:48:45] our sisters right now is social media
[1:48:47] because you can preach on there as if
[1:48:49] you're in a pulpit you have a bigger
[1:48:51] audience than i have
[1:48:52] i sit here and i preach to 30 people you
[1:48:54] can go online and you can have six seven
[1:48:56] hundred eight hundred a thousand fifteen
[1:48:57] thousand whatever it is that are
[1:48:59] following you and you can sit there and
[1:49:00] preach to every one of them and you're
[1:49:02] off the word of god every single time
[1:49:03] you do it and it's a dangerous thing
[1:49:05] sisters
[1:49:07] she may have had great motives and i'd
[1:49:09] like to think she did but good motives
[1:49:11] don't allow you to cross the word
[1:49:12] boundary
[1:49:13] and that's what i find so often is we
[1:49:14] have great motives we have great reasons
[1:49:16] for doing it but if you don't follow the
[1:49:18] word you're still wrong
[1:49:20] listen to what brother branham says
[1:49:22] he says there she stands there she is
[1:49:24] that's her she preaches the word handles
[1:49:25] the word becomes a goddess and is the
[1:49:28] cause of every sin the bible said i
[1:49:30] suffer not a woman to teach or usurp any
[1:49:32] authority but be in obedience is also
[1:49:34] saith the law see she can't do it but
[1:49:37] they make her a ruler of the land a
[1:49:38] mayor or governor soon shall be
[1:49:40] president sure there you are that's the
[1:49:43] way it goes see and the people do that
[1:49:45] because they don't care about this word
[1:49:48] they'll never see it
[1:49:50] so that's all speaking to you know the
[1:49:51] world in general but then he brings it
[1:49:53] into the ranks of christianity and the
[1:49:54] message choosing of a bride and he says
[1:49:57] she eve persuaded him adam out of the
[1:50:00] will of god and caused him to do
[1:50:02] something that he should not have done
[1:50:04] and by it caused death to the whole
[1:50:06] human race that's why the bible forbids
[1:50:08] her to teach or to preach or to handle
[1:50:10] god's word in any manner okay so
[1:50:12] everything i've said forget i said it
[1:50:14] and here's the prophet saying
[1:50:16] right if you believe malachi 4 it says
[1:50:18] simple he points us back to the
[1:50:19] scripture and he says it so you don't
[1:50:21] have to say that's just brother john
[1:50:22] talking that's brother branham talking
[1:50:24] that's a malachi 4 the prophet of the
[1:50:25] age saying it he says i know sisters
[1:50:28] many of you say the lord called me to
[1:50:30] preach
[1:50:32] listen to this i'm not going to argue
[1:50:35] with you
[1:50:36] but i'm going to tell you the word says
[1:50:38] you're not to do it she shall not teach
[1:50:40] or usurp any authority but to be in
[1:50:42] silence
[1:50:44] right
[1:50:45] the lord called me to preach
[1:50:47] he says well you say the lord told me to
[1:50:50] do it
[1:50:51] listen to this
[1:50:52] he says i don't doubt that one bit
[1:50:56] did you hear my message the other night
[1:50:57] about balaam
[1:51:01] i think this was a trap wasn't it
[1:51:04] he says
[1:51:06] balaam got the first straight cut
[1:51:09] decision out of god
[1:51:10] don't do it
[1:51:14] but he kept on fooling around until
[1:51:16] finally god told him to do it
[1:51:19] so you don't have god's will
[1:51:21] you have god's permission
[1:51:23] that is not what he's talking about amen
[1:51:26] god might permit you to preach i don't
[1:51:28] say he didn't but it's not according to
[1:51:30] his original word and plan for she is to
[1:51:33] be under obedience is also say at the
[1:51:34] law it's true therefore she's not
[1:51:37] supposed to do it the hallmark of a true
[1:51:39] ministry is not to be identified as a
[1:51:41] balaam ministry if i can put it that way
[1:51:43] if you've got to go the balaam route to
[1:51:44] be in your ministry you're off the word
[1:51:46] and what happened to balaam after he
[1:51:48] went in his own way
[1:51:50] brought him to his death didn't it right
[1:51:52] he couldn't even achieve what he wanted
[1:51:54] to he did it out of selfish desire he
[1:51:56] wanted the rank he wanted the money he
[1:51:58] wanted the recognition he was a true
[1:52:00] prophet
[1:52:00] he had a real prophetic gift but he
[1:52:03] wasn't supposed to use it of his own way
[1:52:05] and he pushed and he pushed until god
[1:52:07] said go ahead and do it and then what
[1:52:09] did he do he went he couldn't even
[1:52:11] deliver the message he wanted to and
[1:52:12] then he was killed in doing so right
[1:52:14] balaam lost his life because he insisted
[1:52:16] on it he got god's permission but he
[1:52:18] didn't have god's will and he definitely
[1:52:20] didn't have god's blessing and it led to
[1:52:22] his destruction not to his benefit all
[1:52:25] it did was benefit the ones he was
[1:52:26] trying to knock down actually
[1:52:28] amen balaam died fulfilling his call to
[1:52:31] minister not god's call to minister if
[1:52:33] we could put it that way right god
[1:52:35] didn't tell balaam to do it god gave him
[1:52:37] permission to do it and that's a big
[1:52:39] difference i don't want to go to god for
[1:52:40] permission i want to go to god for
[1:52:42] leadership direction and guidance amen
[1:52:44] that he would tell me what to do not
[1:52:46] that i would tell him what i want to do
[1:52:48] amen now paul ties together that idea of
[1:52:50] teaching with usurping authority and
[1:52:52] that's where we get some clarity on the
[1:52:54] matter because you can't take authority
[1:52:56] to teach but you can be given authority
[1:52:58] to teach sisters amen you can't presume
[1:53:00] or assume or take that position or
[1:53:02] authority over men informally or
[1:53:04] formally you have to be given it that
[1:53:06] word usurp means one who acts on their
[1:53:09] own authority to govern an absolute
[1:53:11] master to govern exercise dominion over
[1:53:14] one to unilaterally take up arms meaning
[1:53:16] you decide to do it without any
[1:53:18] consultation i.e you're acting as an
[1:53:20] autocrat somebody that has no headship
[1:53:22] literally you are self-appointed acting
[1:53:25] without submission
[1:53:26] or headship so you can't take authority
[1:53:29] to give moral instruction or handle the
[1:53:30] word of god but you can be given it amen
[1:53:34] and who do we have teaching our young
[1:53:36] people youngest people in sunday school
[1:53:39] is it a brother or a sister is it a man
[1:53:41] or a woman
[1:53:42] it's a sister isn't it sister kim
[1:53:45] so why does sister kim get to do it and
[1:53:46] nobody else get to do it
[1:53:48] because sister kim has been given
[1:53:50] authority
[1:53:52] by the pastor by the sunday school
[1:53:54] superintendent and by her own husband to
[1:53:56] sit there and teach those youngest of
[1:53:58] children in the word of god
[1:54:01] right but you'll notice that as soon as
[1:54:03] we start getting deeper into doctrine
[1:54:05] into instructive truths of the word who
[1:54:07] do we have doing it we put it into the
[1:54:09] hands of a man
[1:54:11] right out of respect for the age that
[1:54:13] they're coming into they receive
[1:54:14] instruction from a man not from a woman
[1:54:17] our sisters are sitting at home and
[1:54:18] they're teaching our children all day
[1:54:20] long aren't they they are given
[1:54:22] authority to raise the children in the
[1:54:24] fear and admonition of the lord that's a
[1:54:26] word authority that's given to him not
[1:54:28] just your husband would give that your
[1:54:29] husband can't deny you that that
[1:54:31] authority to teach your children the
[1:54:32] word gives you that authority you're
[1:54:34] supposed to do that you're supposed to
[1:54:35] keep the word of god in your mouth day
[1:54:37] in and night you're supposed to be
[1:54:38] teaching them and telling them the
[1:54:39] stories and and raising them up in these
[1:54:41] different things so you have authority
[1:54:43] but it's given to you either by the word
[1:54:45] or by the headship that is there in the
[1:54:47] first place but you can't presume to
[1:54:49] take it amen like brother brown says it
[1:54:51] all goes back to eve she mishandled the
[1:54:53] word and that's why the woman's not
[1:54:55] allowed to take it anymore unless she's
[1:54:56] given authority to do it amen right
[1:55:00] now let me say this i can absolutely
[1:55:01] allow a woman to teach me i've had many
[1:55:03] fine women old and young tell me things
[1:55:06] that i needed to know share things with
[1:55:08] me encourage me correct me in those
[1:55:10] different things i don't think any man
[1:55:11] that's worth assault is going to sit
[1:55:12] there and say a woman can't teach me
[1:55:14] anything you have to be an idiot to
[1:55:16] think that amen if a woman's got the
[1:55:17] holy ghost then absolutely god can use
[1:55:19] her mouth if he can use balaam's donkey
[1:55:21] and he can use my mouth he can use a
[1:55:23] woman's mouth amen there's no reason he
[1:55:25] can't but you got to be humble to
[1:55:26] recognize that amen we all need to be
[1:55:29] humble scripture says we're supposed to
[1:55:30] be humble one to another to submit and
[1:55:32] subject ourselves one to another so if
[1:55:34] sister maureen or sister brenda or
[1:55:36] sister betty came up to me and said
[1:55:37] brother john i'd like to share something
[1:55:39] with you i guarantee you i'd sit and
[1:55:40] listen to it amen why because they've
[1:55:43] earned that respect for me to say
[1:55:45] absolutely sister share with me what's
[1:55:47] on your heart i wouldn't turn her down
[1:55:49] right
[1:55:50] but the other thing is is she wouldn't
[1:55:51] do it without having to talk to her
[1:55:53] husband first i guarantee you that if
[1:55:54] there was a real issue there and chances
[1:55:56] are he'd come and talk to me not her
[1:55:58] but sometimes she'll just have it's in
[1:56:00] conversation she'll shut you know one of
[1:56:01] them will say something i'm i've got to
[1:56:03] be able to receive that amen
[1:56:05] we're believers we have the holy ghost
[1:56:07] we are part and members of the bride of
[1:56:10] christ we ought to be able to accept
[1:56:11] that but to sit down and formally
[1:56:13] instruct she's not allowed to do it or
[1:56:14] informally instruct if her intent is to
[1:56:16] do that then she's got to be very
[1:56:18] careful because it has to be given her
[1:56:19] she can't take it amen remember usurping
[1:56:22] is when you take permission
[1:56:24] when you take something without
[1:56:25] permission and that's where you what
[1:56:28] presume and brother bram says to presume
[1:56:29] is to venture without authority
[1:56:32] first corinthians 14 is the scripture
[1:56:33] he's been referring to and he says let
[1:56:35] your women keep silence in the churches
[1:56:37] for it has not permitted them to speak
[1:56:39] but they are commanded to be under
[1:56:41] obedience as also saith the law and it's
[1:56:43] like we said before it's not just okay
[1:56:45] to be quiet but you have to be in
[1:56:46] subjection and obedience in your
[1:56:47] quietness if rebellion is stirring in
[1:56:49] your heart while you're sitting there in
[1:56:51] silence you're not doing a very good job
[1:56:52] are you you've got to be in subjection
[1:56:54] to headship when you're doing these
[1:56:55] things and if they will learn anything
[1:56:57] let them ask their husbands at home
[1:56:59] their fathers if they're single for it
[1:57:01] is a shame for a woman to speak in the
[1:57:02] church that's why we don't allow a woman
[1:57:04] to minister in the church is that it's
[1:57:06] expressly forbidden she can sing
[1:57:09] she can testify she can speak in tongues
[1:57:11] she can express the gifts of the spirit
[1:57:13] but she's not allowed up here to handle
[1:57:15] the word of god it's forbidden her in
[1:57:16] the scriptures amen they're not to leave
[1:57:18] but they're to obey they're to be in
[1:57:19] obedience as paul said when it comes to
[1:57:21] the operations of the church and the
[1:57:22] positions within it she can't hold any
[1:57:25] of those things they're not to preach
[1:57:26] they're not to teach formally or
[1:57:27] informally and they're not to try and
[1:57:29] tell the men what to do in those
[1:57:30] positions either
[1:57:32] brother bram says this and we're closing
[1:57:34] he says and he made her for man and not
[1:57:36] man for her did you know that the woman
[1:57:38] was made for men and not the man for the
[1:57:39] woman the bible teaches that all right
[1:57:42] she was given a place in man before the
[1:57:44] fall equal over all creation that's
[1:57:47] where she started equal
[1:57:49] no one greater no one lesser fully equal
[1:57:52] but after the fall now here we bring the
[1:57:54] subject up but after the fall he was her
[1:57:57] ruler she must keep uh silent in all
[1:58:00] matters now after the original beginning
[1:58:03] is over
[1:58:04] that's an interesting phrase he says the
[1:58:06] original beginning is over you had an
[1:58:08] original beginning where all were equal
[1:58:09] in the eyes of god right he says that
[1:58:11] original beginning is gone now
[1:58:14] but guess what there's a new beginning
[1:58:15] coming isn't there we've got a new
[1:58:16] heaven and we've got a new earth where
[1:58:18] we come back and rule and reign with him
[1:58:20] and that's where the that's where the
[1:58:21] equality is going to come back but until
[1:58:23] then we're stuck in this broken system
[1:58:25] where you have fallen men and fallen
[1:58:27] women just trying to make it worth by
[1:58:28] work by one thing and one thing alone
[1:58:30] and that is the new birth the baptism of
[1:58:32] the holy ghost in each one of you it's
[1:58:34] the only way to make it work amen
[1:58:36] amen we'll stand if we will
[1:58:38] amen i'm looking forward to a new
[1:58:40] beginning and i'm looking forward to a
[1:58:42] place where it's christ above all amen
[1:58:44] he's got to be above all right now but
[1:58:46] i'm looking to a place where he takes it
[1:58:48] all amen we're just sitting and we're
[1:58:50] resting and we're relaxing in his
[1:58:51] presence where we don't have to rely on
[1:58:53] ourselves where we don't have to look at
[1:58:55] our own failures where we don't have to
[1:58:56] see where we we mess things up but where
[1:58:58] we can just look at him where he is the
[1:59:00] light he is the ever-present one he is
[1:59:02] the ever gracious one he's the one
[1:59:04] that's made it all possible and we're
[1:59:06] literally just able to sit there and
[1:59:07] rest in his presence amen it'll be a
[1:59:09] wonderful place i do believe let's bow
[1:59:11] our heads together heavenly father
[1:59:14] lord some strong words this morning no
