[46:05] it is christ in me thank god he's in me
[46:08] thank god he's in the believers and he's
[46:09] right there a man so that he's going to

[46:15] crosses your path
[46:16] he's going to respond to it amen and i

[46:20] discern his leadership in our lives
[46:23] amen so the lord bless you so keep
[46:26] sister betty
[46:27] in prayer amen and again
[46:30] of course we need to pray for one
[46:32] another constantly including the token
[46:34] life of the blood of jesus
[46:36] and also again let me remind you that
[46:39] brother we got to keep looking up we got
[46:42] to keep looking
[46:43] to god we got to keep looking to the
[46:45] word
[46:46] and not not what's down here what's up
[46:49] there
[46:50] amen by the grace of god what's down
[46:52] here is being judged
[46:54] by the word but by the grace of god we
[46:56] believe that the message was the grace
[46:58] of god to
[46:59] to give a bride rapturing faith it is by
[47:02] grace
[47:02] through faith amen it's not just grace
[47:06] no no and that's been quoted for many
[47:09] many years
[47:10] or we're saved by the grace of god no no
[47:12] no
[47:13] we're it goes beyond that how are we
[47:16] saved by the grace of god
[47:18] by faith grace is going to give us the
[47:20] faith
[47:21] that god wants us to have in the hour
[47:24] and in the day
[47:25] that we're living amen god is going to
[47:27] require this of you and me
[47:29] he required one thing of luther's
[47:31] generation wesley's generation
[47:33] the old-fashioned salvation army
[47:35] generation the pentecostal generation
[47:37] what was he requiring of us in our
[47:40] generation
[47:41] amen so i pray the grace of god that
[47:44] that we're going to
[47:45] enter into the revelation the faith
[47:49] that god wants us to have amen i mean
[47:52] why
[47:52] because what he did in luther's
[47:54] generation was one thing amen
[47:56] so he give them they give them the word
[47:58] that will give them the faith
[47:59] that pleased him amen and brother like i
[48:02] said it was just justification
[48:04] so he wasn't going into all the rest
[48:07] because that was that was the burden
[48:08] that
[48:09] that they had in that day to be
[48:11] justified
[48:12] and i'll imagine to be justified do this
[48:14] do this do this no
[48:16] you've got to you've got to accept what
[48:17] he's already done
[48:19] by the grace of god amen so
[48:22] and and again that was that was here and
[48:25] then wesley then the old-fashioned
[48:27] salvation army the pentecostals
[48:29] but now brother god requires more of us
[48:32] than he did of them
[48:34] amen and brother to to to for us to
[48:37] manifest it
[48:39] amen and go and live it we got to let it
[48:42] control us amen so amen
[48:45] sure we're going to go out and live
[48:46] justified lives sanctified lives
[48:49] and life with the baptism and access to
[48:51] the gifts yeah
[48:52] that's right but now god's looking for a
[48:54] greater faith
[48:55] to for the resurrection and the rapture
[48:58] amen
[48:59] and and when they got the revelation
[49:02] back then
[49:02] that's all they focused on morning noon
[49:05] and night
[49:05] yeah and brother to pentecostals
[49:08] morning noon and night around the world
[49:11] but brother
[49:12] the bride in this hour we're focusing on
[49:16] thank god for what he did then amen
[49:20] but we're focusing on what he's doing as
[49:22] done and he's doing now
[49:23] and that's the opening of the word the
[49:25] mystery of god to give us resurrection
[49:27] and rapturing faith amen god's not
[49:30] looking for us just to go say oh yeah
[49:31] i'm justified thank you lord and go on
[49:33] no
[49:34] yeah he wants you to believe that plus
[49:37] wesley plus the pentecostals amen
[49:41] but now let's believe that plus the
[49:44] messenger
[49:44] the prophetic messenger of the age the
[49:47] prophetic message
[49:48] that god ordained to open the word and
[49:51] reveal
[49:52] the mystery of god so that we know the
[49:54] word of god the revelation of god
[49:57] that luther never had amen that's right
[50:00] we we were going beyond that
[50:02] luther never didn't know what we're

[53:08] hope

[53:11] by believing what he said two
[53:12] six thousand years ago amen and by grace
[53:16] through faith
[53:16] we are going to enter into a
[53:18] resurrection rapture we're saved
[53:20] by what believing what he has revealed
[53:22] and is revealing in these
[53:23] last days amen pentecostals will see it
[53:27] they but they what they saw god god's
[53:30] grace to them
[53:31] amen and that again the the methodist
[53:34] didn't see it
[53:35] no no they saw what god revealed amen
[53:38] they went along with god
[53:40] amen it was satisfying the hunger for
[53:42] that age
[53:43] but i tell you concerning what god has
[53:47] done in this hour is to satisfy the
[53:48] hunger we have
[53:49] amen and what is that hunger it's for a
[53:52] resurrection rapture we want to get out
[53:54] of here
[53:55] amen because we know if we don't get
[53:57] into the resurrection rapture
[53:58] we're not going to be saved no that's
[54:01] how that's how bad the world is
[54:03] so god help us that we're going to press
[54:05] on into the faith
[54:07] that god's looking for in you and me and
[54:10] brother think that i
[54:11] i oh well can i have that faith yes all
[54:13] that god has done
[54:14] was ordained to give us resurrection and
[54:17] rapturing faith
[54:18] amen well i believe brother brown said
[54:20] it'll come to the place
[54:22] oh my why what concerning what god has
[54:24] done he said it ought to come to the
[54:25] place where he said it might be a it
[54:27] might be a man a woman or he said it
[54:29] might be just a boy or a girl
[54:31] and he said what were they with it with
[54:33] the the influence of that anointing
[54:35] of the revealed word in their hearts and
[54:37] in their souls he said
[54:39] he said a boy or a girl he said just
[54:40] look up there and say lord
[54:42] we're coming home and he should lift up
[54:45] their hands and they're gone
[54:46] amen it's that simple praise the name of
[54:50] the lord
[54:50] are we coming to that place amen
[54:54] what emphasis are we putting on the
[54:56] revelation of what god
[54:57] has done and what god is doing
[55:00] amen or you can go preach the doctrine
[55:03] and the doctrine and the doctrine
[55:04] and go to hell oh yeah or end up in a
[55:08] great tribulation
[55:09] amen but brother let's see what god was
[55:12] pointing to
[55:13] in putting the emphasis on these
[55:14] doctrines putting the emphasis on the on
[55:16] these
[55:17] church ages putting the emphasis on
[55:19] these seals
[55:20] amen brother increasing our faith
[55:23] increasing our faith
[55:24] what for to do as jesus said
[55:28] amen to go on amen praise the lord
[55:31] hallelujah brother the rest were
[55:35] redeemed they entered into the
[55:36] revelation of jesus as their redeemer
[55:39] now we're entering into the revelation
[55:40] of jesus as the redeemer of our bodies
[55:43] our souls yes amen all that gone on
[55:47] before us
[55:48] they were redeemed in their souls and
[55:50] they got out of this body
[55:51] and went into a theophany body praise
[55:54] the lord
[55:54] amen by the grace of almighty god
[55:57] but the bride is going amen oh you're
[56:00] going to meet them
[56:01] but then that faith is going to quicken
[56:03] us into a glorified body
[56:06] amen like the body that jesus went up
[56:08] with
[56:09] amen so the grace of god to help us to
[56:12] truly
[56:12] believe amen amen now just believe it
[56:16] but help us to so that what we believe
[56:19] controls us
[56:21] what we believe governs what we think
[56:23] and how we think what we do and how we
[56:25] do it amen
[56:26] you're controlled by that faith because
[56:28] luther went out and did this and did
[56:30] this because he thought he had to do it
[56:31] for justification
[56:33] but no no but when god revealed it to
[56:35] him the revelation of justification
[56:37] oh he went out and preached it and given
[56:39] to god the glory praise the lord praise
[56:41] the lord
[56:41] he was emphasizing justification and to
[56:44] us
[56:44] in this hour brother what did god do in
[56:46] the ministry of a prophet
[56:48] he amen he gave us the revelation of the
[56:51] resurrection
[56:52] amen brother god god not only raised
[56:54] raise humans from the dead from the
[56:56] death not from the grave or from death
[56:59] under the ministry of william branham
[57:00] amen oh yeah he raised animals to life
[57:03] again
[57:04] praise the lord praise the lord amen
[57:07] showing that we're in the hour of the
[57:09] resurrection praise the lord so brother
[57:12] god's going to raise the rays of his
[57:14] sons and daughters
[57:16] into glorified bodies but he's also
[57:18] going he's also going to bring in some
[57:19] of those animals
[57:21] amen by the grace of god somebody asked
[57:23] me and said oh
[57:24] brother is there going to be any animals
[57:26] in in the new heaven and new earth
[57:28] i said sure amen they're going to be
[57:31] there
[57:31] i said maybe not all that we see now but
[57:33] there's still going to be animals there
[57:35] amen praise the lord the lion will lay
[57:37] down with the lamb
[57:39] amen the bible explains that the the the
[57:42] the
[57:42] nature of animals where they fight one
[57:44] another and kill one another
[57:46] not in in glory know what he said
[57:49] that not not not by any means lying will
[57:51] lay down with the lamb this animal will
[57:53] do this
[57:54] this one will do that amen because why
[57:57] because there's nothing negative that's
[58:00] one thing that i
[58:02] thought about and give god the glory for
[58:04] i said lord i'm longing to get out of
[58:06] here
[58:06] and into a country into a kingdom i say
[58:09] where there's nothing
[58:10] negative and i said everything is
[58:13] positive
[58:14] and right now we're we're living in a
[58:16] world that's all mine
[58:17] it is tremendously negative
[58:21] right around the world this cobit issue
[58:24] is negative
[58:25] amen so the grace of god that the
[58:27] bride's looking up
[58:29] because we know don't look down on the
[58:31] covet issue look up
[58:32] to the promise of god amen because he's
[58:35] going to bring more
[58:36] and more and more of that amen they
[58:38] allow it to come into the into the world
[58:40] what for it's the influence of the
[58:42] bright the bride's going to look up
[58:44] oh yeah oh yeah it's just just your
[58:46] it'll be just your your holy ghost
[58:48] nature in you
[58:49] look up amen jesus went up
[58:53] brother and he's given us the faith to
[58:55] do this for the same thing
[58:57] amen we have come to the place that
[58:59] jesus came to
[59:00] after his death burial and resurrection
[59:03] amen to go up
[59:04] in he was resurrected now he was going
[59:07] to rap
[59:08] be raptured amen and be caught up
[59:11] and the angels went with him said open
[59:13] up the gates
[59:15] and let the king of glory come in amen
[59:18] and they said who is who is the lord of
[59:20] oceans the lord of lords
[59:22] oh it's he's the king of glory amen
[59:25] he's the one that's that's fought and
[59:27] has gotten the victory
[59:28] praise the lord hallelujah so the grace
[59:31] of god
[59:32] that we're going to experience the
[59:33] victory and go home
[59:35] amen so i trust you have that anointing
[59:38] in your heart
[59:39] that anointing in your soul amen you're
[59:41] hungry and thirsting
[59:43] not just for religion but you want to
[59:45] get out of here
[59:46] it is the word amen faith cometh by
[59:49] hearing
[59:50] the word amen and again
[59:53] oh yeah by grace i'm saved yeah but
[59:55] through faith
[59:57] so what is the faith that god's
[59:59] requiring of you today
[1:00:00] and so by the grace of god is more than
[1:00:03] what he required of
[1:00:04] mom and dad and the grandmothers and
[1:00:06] grandpas
[1:00:07] more than what he required of another
[1:00:09] generation so brother
[1:00:11] it's ordained to give us resurrection
[1:00:13] and rapturing faith
[1:00:14] and i'll tell you this it was so simple
[1:00:17] like i said the prophet said that a
[1:00:19] child
[1:00:20] a boy or girl could just raise their
[1:00:21] hand and say lord i'm coming home
[1:00:23] gone and he said another brother
[1:00:25] approached brother branham
[1:00:26] he said brother branham he said
[1:00:29] my where's the rapture he says surely
[1:00:32] after all that god has done
[1:00:34] in this generation it ought to give us
[1:00:36] the faith for the rapture
[1:00:38] and that's the truth and i believe if if
[1:00:41] if if the prophet stayed
[1:00:43] i think eventually he would have walked
[1:00:44] off in a rapture
[1:00:46] amen but but that's right brother but
[1:00:49] god took him
[1:00:50] amen god took him because the hour
[1:00:53] hadn't come yet for the rapture
[1:00:55] but brother it's been 55 years so
[1:00:58] whereby the grace of god
[1:00:59] help us lord that we're going to get
[1:01:02] into the revelation of the word
[1:01:03] amen yes lord but we're going to get the
[1:01:06] faith that we need
[1:01:08] and what faith do we need we need the
[1:01:10] faith for the resurrection
[1:01:12] the faith for the rapture why again let
[1:01:14] me repeat it again
[1:01:16] if i got to do it because peter said he
[1:01:19] said your forgetful ears
[1:01:20] amen well let it let everyone remembered
[1:01:23] and control you
[1:01:25] amen and by the grace of almighty god
[1:01:28] he said that the dead are waiting on us
[1:01:32] amen they're waiting on us to get to
[1:01:35] that faith
[1:01:36] for the rapture why when we get to that
[1:01:38] faith and we really get into it it
[1:01:40] controls us
[1:01:41] then they're going to appear to us and
[1:01:43] the prophecies we're going to be changed
[1:01:44] instantly
[1:01:46] he said into a glorified body amen we'll
[1:01:49] gather with all the rest he said we'll
[1:01:50] rise to meet him in the air
[1:01:52] amen what we've what we have seen by the
[1:01:55] grace of god in the pillar of fire
[1:01:58] brother he's going to he's going to be
[1:02:00] there in a cloud of glory
[1:02:02] and brother the prophet was preaching
[1:02:04] one time he said see
[1:02:05] he said there he is he's looking down on
[1:02:08] us
[1:02:09] amen praise the name of the lord it's a
[1:02:12] cloud of angels
[1:02:13] so brother i pray grace that we're not
[1:02:15] going to miss
[1:02:16] the rapture not going to miss the
[1:02:19] resurrection
[1:02:20] remember the resurrection has got got to
[1:02:22] take place first
[1:02:24] amen and then the dead in christ appear
[1:02:26] to us
[1:02:28] are we sensitive to that are we really
[1:02:30] looking for it are we expecting it
[1:02:33] amen so brother because all of it down
[1:02:36] through the ages
[1:02:37] when they got a revelation from god for
[1:02:38] that age brother
[1:02:40] that it controlled them morning noon and
[1:02:42] night they lived it lived it lived it
[1:02:44] talked it talked it
[1:02:45] amen it was their testimony one to
[1:02:47] another
[1:02:48] and they give god the glory for it amen
[1:02:51] praise the name of the lord the lord
[1:02:53] bless you sorry let's stand
[1:02:55] but that's all right shouldn't be sorry
[1:02:58] why
[1:02:58] because we want to by grace we want to
[1:03:01] go on come on
[1:03:02] tell say it again brother because maybe
[1:03:04] it helped me to get get that faith
[1:03:06] that i need amen by the grace of god
[1:03:10] so it'll get to the place where brother
[1:03:12] morning new tonight
[1:03:13] it's just the word the word the word
[1:03:16] it's like i said every revival
[1:03:18] people just oh they made fun of them
[1:03:20] those that got caught up with their
[1:03:21] revival made fun of them why
[1:03:24] they're always there getting together

[1:03:58] talking about it morning noon and night
[1:04:00] talking about it and until through the
[1:04:03] day
[1:04:04] that's why the bible says after the day
[1:04:06] of pentecost
[1:04:07] boy they got together in in their homes
[1:04:09] oh yeah
[1:04:10] and just talking about the revelation

[1:04:17] that there was there's nothing the devil

[1:13:48] possible now
[1:13:52] i'd be
[1:14:05] [Music]

[1:14:12] possible now
[1:14:16] i believe amen
[1:14:19] praise the name of the lord god bless
[1:14:21] you turn with me to the book of genesis
[1:14:24] chapter one
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:32] just a confirmation
[1:14:35] i guess these thoughts and
[1:14:38] what i've said thus far is we had a
[1:14:41] ministering brother here one time and
[1:14:44] and uh he said brother and i he might
[1:14:47] have told to the assembly as well
[1:14:49] he said i'm a notes preacher he said but
[1:14:52] brother gerald is a
[1:14:54] is inspirational preacher amen
[1:14:57] and the inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:15:00] the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:15:02] so he said that's he said i'll just go
[1:15:04] according to my notes
[1:15:05] he said well brother joel's going to
[1:15:07] just follow what god puts in his mind
[1:15:09] and in his heart amen amen so i don't
[1:15:12] maybe our brother jonathan is a note
[1:15:14] preacher
[1:15:15] but also he's there with that that
[1:15:17] anointing
[1:15:18] then i noticed that he's got to keep
[1:15:20] putting himself back to the notes
[1:15:22] go back to the notes go back to the
[1:15:24] notes amen so i pray grace that i will
[1:15:26] get
[1:15:27] will get to to my notes amen
[1:15:30] and again i did i it's amazing that god
[1:15:33] provided the notes
[1:15:35] right there so
[1:15:38] so i thank the lord for that i want to i
[1:15:41] want to highlight some scriptures
[1:15:43] that will help us and lead us to again
[1:15:46] this message that i referenced
[1:15:48] before our brother mark came and
[1:15:50] preached and our brother jonathan
[1:15:52] ministered
[1:15:53] and i did say i said lord willing we'll
[1:15:54] get i'll get to these
[1:15:56] thoughts i said maybe in another message
[1:15:59] and so we'll try to get back to this
[1:16:00] message right here and i don't know if
[1:16:02] you remember what it was
[1:16:04] but i was highlighting god's word
[1:16:08] calls for a total separation from
[1:16:11] unbelief
[1:16:12] amen so i highlighted some scriptures
[1:16:15] and we'll do some scriptures again
[1:16:17] tonight and then the lord willing
[1:16:19] again i'm endeavoring to get get to
[1:16:21] these notes right here
[1:16:23] so but it usually tells sometimes it
[1:16:25] takes a long time
[1:16:26] but we'll see and again as i highlighted
[1:16:29] that
[1:16:31] all due respect to our brother uh lee
[1:16:34] vale
[1:16:35] that somebody's compared me to level one
[1:16:39] time they said oh no you're not lee vale
[1:16:42] why because he said brother he'll take a
[1:16:44] message and he'll preach 60
[1:16:46] 60 sermons on that one message
[1:16:49] but he said you don't do that well we'll
[1:16:51] see what the lord will do
[1:16:52] i don't think i'll go to 60. but i did
[1:16:54] one time i preached a certain message
[1:16:56] one time i can't remember the name of it
[1:16:58] now
[1:16:59] and i went oh my i might have been 59
[1:17:02] messages
[1:17:03] and and uh sister coffee i always
[1:17:06] remember
[1:17:07] she said that was the best she ever
[1:17:08] heard and i said well praise the lord
[1:17:12] amen not not three or four messages but
[1:17:15] 59.
[1:17:16] amen so god rest our rest your soul amen
[1:17:19] it was a blessing to her so the grace of
[1:17:22] god be with us
[1:17:23] see why is it like that it's because
[1:17:25] we're go we're
[1:17:26] we're not in time we're read eternity
[1:17:30] amen whether it's brother jonathan or
[1:17:32] his brother mark or whatever whatever
[1:17:33] brother
[1:17:34] that might be here ministering amen
[1:17:36] we've got to get out of time and into
[1:17:38] eternity
[1:17:39] so it's not me in control not you in
[1:17:40] control it's god in control
[1:17:42] amen it is the holy ghost so the lord
[1:17:45] bless us and
[1:17:46] again want to do what god wants us to do
[1:17:49] and we'll try to get through the
[1:17:50] scripture and
[1:17:52] if we don't get all of these quotes
[1:17:54] we'll get some of them
[1:17:56] amen so in the genesis chapter 1
[1:17:59] and beginning to read at verse 1
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:08] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:18:11] and the earth
[1:18:12] we are in the end of that beginning
[1:18:17] and the earth was without form and void
[1:18:22] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:18:25] deep
[1:18:26] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[1:18:30] face of the waters
[1:18:32] and god said let there be light
[1:18:37] and there was light
[1:18:40] because why god saw the light
[1:18:43] that it was good and god divided
[1:18:47] or separated the light from the darkness
[1:18:52] and as he was doing in that natural
[1:18:54] creation
[1:18:56] of the heaven new heaven and new earth
[1:18:58] so he is doing
[1:18:59] in your life and in mind that god is
[1:19:02] separating
[1:19:03] light from darkness so grace that we're
[1:19:05] going to recognize the light
[1:19:08] by the grace of god and that we are
[1:19:10] getting more and more
[1:19:11] into the light and out of the darkness
[1:19:14] that we are being separated by the
[1:19:16] ministry of the word
[1:19:18] that we are being separated more and
[1:19:19] more from darkness and god has taken
[1:19:22] darkness taken taken darkness
[1:19:24] out of our hearts a man until brother
[1:19:27] comes to that place where it's a hundred
[1:19:28] percent light
[1:19:29] and we're going into the resurrection
[1:19:31] and we're going into the rapture
[1:19:32] amen because there won't be any negative
[1:19:35] things there
[1:19:36] to hinder us in our faith amen for the
[1:19:39] resurrection
[1:19:39] and the rapture so god divided the light
[1:19:43] from the darkness he did it and he's
[1:19:45] doing it
[1:19:46] he did it in the natural he did it when
[1:19:48] it comes to the natural sun
[1:19:50] and the moon he's he divided it amen
[1:19:53] then
[1:19:53] the night versus the day he divided it
[1:19:56] he divided the light from the day
[1:19:59] darkness
[1:20:00] amen so he has he done here naturally so
[1:20:02] he's doing to us spiritually amen
[1:20:05] god is working in us through the
[1:20:07] ministry of the word amen
[1:20:09] to make sure that the light is separated
[1:20:11] from the darkness
[1:20:12] amen so that darkness is not in control
[1:20:15] darkness is not guarding us
[1:20:16] amen the oh yeah the the the imputed
[1:20:19] revelations of the devil
[1:20:20] amen saying this this and that like he
[1:20:22] said to eve in the garden
[1:20:24] oh yeah yes god said but amen
[1:20:28] and remember again the sheep don't butt
[1:20:30] that's the goats amen
[1:20:32] the goat's butt but not sheep amen so we
[1:20:35] pray the grace of god that we are
[1:20:37] shape amen and that we are the lambs of
[1:20:39] god
[1:20:40] by the for the glory of god so brother
[1:20:43] let's let it be a confirmation that we
[1:20:46] are born again a confirmation that god
[1:20:48] is in control
[1:20:49] amen you have the evidence of the
[1:20:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:53] amen what is it well god is working on
[1:20:56] me
[1:20:57] amen morning noon and night amen and
[1:20:59] he's separating constantly in my life
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:02] he's separating light from darkness
[1:21:04] light from darkness till you're all
[1:21:06] light and no darkness
[1:21:08] amen amen we're all light in no darkness
[1:21:11] then we're ready for the resurrection
[1:21:13] then we're ready for the rapture
[1:21:15] so he said god divided the light from
[1:21:17] the darkness
[1:21:18] and god called the light day and the
[1:21:21] darkness
[1:21:21] he called night amen and the
[1:21:25] evening and the morning were the first
[1:21:28] day amen verse 6
[1:21:32] and god said let there be a firmament in
[1:21:34] the midst
[1:21:35] of the waters and let it divide the
[1:21:37] waters
[1:21:38] from the waters god amen
[1:21:42] working on separation god bless you you
[1:21:44] may be seated
[1:21:47] and what god is looking for and what god
[1:21:49] is calling for
[1:21:50] is in our lives is total separation
[1:21:53] from unbelief total separation amen from
[1:21:56] doubt
[1:21:57] told separation from the works of the
[1:22:00] flesh amen
[1:22:01] versus what god is doing in your heart
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:04] so we're not subject to the flesh we're
[1:22:06] not subject to the leadership in the
[1:22:08] flesh we're subject to what god is doing
[1:22:09] in our hearts
[1:22:10] amen again to understand as the prophet
[1:22:13] is highlighted
[1:22:14] that the devil is working in our minds
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:17] through the instincts of the mind
[1:22:18] through the instincts of your flesh
[1:22:20] but he said god is working in our hearts
[1:22:22] through faith amen
[1:22:24] so the enemy is he's got got seven
[1:22:27] senses to work on amen and through your
[1:22:30] mind and through
[1:22:31] through the through the flesh there's
[1:22:33] there's i believe i've already said it
[1:22:35] do it again the instincts are the five
[1:22:38] five instincts of the flesh
[1:22:40] that the enemy works on amen five
[1:22:43] instincts of the flesh that the enemy is
[1:22:45] working on
[1:22:46] amen god help us brother that we'll
[1:22:49] recognize it and we'll keep pleading the
[1:22:51] token life of the blood of jesus
[1:22:53] christ amen keep putting these instincts
[1:22:55] under the control
[1:22:56] of the holy ghost amen so he's working
[1:22:59] on your flesh
[1:23:00] with what you see amen he's working on
[1:23:04] your flesh
[1:23:04] with what you taste and feel and smell
[1:23:08] and what you you're hearing amen brother
[1:23:12] and he wants to apply his thoughts to it
[1:23:14] he wants to apply his ideas to it amen
[1:23:16] amen he wants you to oh just just bring
[1:23:19] us through the senses of your flesh
[1:23:21] your mind in a sense of your flesh so
[1:23:23] that you're gonna you're gonna be
[1:23:24] governed
[1:23:25] by the instincts of your flesh but the
[1:23:28] instincts of the spirit
[1:23:30] amen is imagination conscience
[1:23:34] memory reason and affection and the
[1:23:36] enemy is working on that
[1:23:38] amen to get you to oh yeah you can be
[1:23:41] religious but not spiritual amen he's
[1:23:44] working on that to get you to focus more
[1:23:46] and more
[1:23:47] on the natural life and not on the
[1:23:49] spiritual amen
[1:23:50] it's working on these instincts of your
[1:23:53] flesh and of your spirit
[1:23:54] amen the human spirit able to make us
[1:23:57] more and more and more human
[1:23:59] amen and subject to what's going on in
[1:24:01] the realms around us
[1:24:03] amen somebody what's going on in the
[1:24:05] earth
[1:24:06] oh yeah because many are caught up with
[1:24:08] see taste feel smelling here
[1:24:10] any and and imagination conscious memory
[1:24:13] reason and affection
[1:24:14] but god is working in your soul amen to
[1:24:17] con
[1:24:17] to to give those instincts of spiritual
[1:24:22] nature amen so you're not governed
[1:24:25] by the worldly sinful nature amen but
[1:24:28] you're governed by the holy ghost nature
[1:24:30] amen showing that it's not the devil
[1:24:32] controlling you is jesus
[1:24:34] it is god by the holy ghost controlling
[1:24:37] you
[1:24:37] amen brother this is why we've got to be
[1:24:40] born again
[1:24:42] amen we've got to be born again and
[1:24:44] become new creatures from the soul
[1:24:46] out to your spirit out to your flesh
[1:24:49] amen
[1:24:49] god is working us working on us from the
[1:24:52] inside out
[1:24:53] amen and that's where he warned us that
[1:24:56] you can have the holy ghost anointing in
[1:24:58] your flesh
[1:24:59] you can have the holy ghost anointing
[1:25:00] yes even in your human spirit
[1:25:02] but he says got to be gotta not come
[1:25:04] from the outside to the end
[1:25:06] it's got to start from the inside and
[1:25:07] work out amen
[1:25:09] it's working that's taking control of
[1:25:11] your human spirit and has taken control
[1:25:13] amen of your flesh so why
[1:25:16] is he hallelujah to god be the glory
[1:25:20] amen we're new creatures in our souls
[1:25:22] we're going to become new creatures in
[1:25:23] our spirit
[1:25:24] and a new creature in our flesh amen
[1:25:27] we're going to enter into a glorified
[1:25:28] body
[1:25:29] like unto his glorious body amen
[1:25:33] so brother what is god accomplishing
[1:25:35] that in you
[1:25:36] are you becoming more and more spiritual

[1:26:24] raised there all the all your lives
[1:26:26] amen maybe in this country or that
[1:26:29] country and then you had to go and take
[1:26:30] a journey somewhere else to do something

[1:26:36] oh i want to get back to my family i
[1:26:38] want to get back to my friends that i
[1:26:40] knew there
[1:26:40] i feel it it's better for me to be there
[1:26:42] than here amen
[1:26:44] well brother by the grace of god let's
[1:26:46] hunger and thirst to get out of here and
[1:26:48] we want a hunger to get home
[1:26:49] let's make sure amen that you know where
[1:26:53] you come from
[1:26:54] amen by the grace of god and you want to
[1:26:56] get back there
[1:26:57] by the grace of god amen because all
[1:27:00] that god did
[1:27:01] amen and brother from genesis to ray
[1:27:04] down through to revelation
[1:27:05] all that god did and all that god is
[1:27:07] doing it is to get us from time to
[1:27:09] eternity
[1:27:10] amen brother brother sister amen
[1:27:13] and it comes from eternity down into
[1:27:15] time and all this has happened and it's
[1:27:17] happening
[1:27:18] but no brother in it all well this is
[1:27:20] the wonderful book
[1:27:21] hallelujah the bible brother oh we want
[1:27:24] to know what
[1:27:25] what god has done what god is doing what
[1:27:27] he will do it's right here
[1:27:29] amen this is what this book is all about
[1:27:32] and even concerning what the devil has
[1:27:33] done what the devil is doing what the
[1:27:35] devil will do
[1:27:36] and the end of the devil amen it's all
[1:27:39] in this book there is a plan
[1:27:41] and there is a purpose and there is a
[1:27:43] pattern amen
[1:27:45] and it's sad that that many that many
[1:27:47] say they recognize that maybe
[1:27:49] they have some idea about the plan oh
[1:27:52] yeah
[1:27:52] and but they but they haven't got the
[1:27:54] true revelation of the purpose
[1:27:56] and they don't understand the pattern
[1:27:59] amen
[1:27:59] because if they understood that god had
[1:28:01] a pattern amen
[1:28:03] and god this is how god did it this is
[1:28:05] how god did it in the middle and then
[1:28:07] and in the beginning and this is how
[1:28:08] he's doing it in the end amen
[1:28:10] god has a pattern this is the way that
[1:28:13] god
[1:28:14] gives his word this is the way that god
[1:28:16] makes his word flesh this is the way
[1:28:17] that god
[1:28:18] amen is taking us from time to eternity
[1:28:21] amen
[1:28:22] brother amen we all came out of time out
[1:28:25] of eternity into time
[1:28:26] to be tested and tried amen so that god
[1:28:30] in time would reveal to us is
[1:28:31] his love amen and it would produce in us
[1:28:34] a love for him because remember he's not
[1:28:37] easy
[1:28:38] again he's not that he wants us to come
[1:28:40] there
[1:28:41] and we like him because oh yeah we like
[1:28:43] you lord and we appreciate what you did
[1:28:45] amen no he wants you to love him amen
[1:28:49] it's a relationship of love amen
[1:28:52] so brother not love the world and the
[1:28:54] things of the world amen
[1:28:56] but to love god but yet there are those
[1:28:59] that have a greater love for the world
[1:29:01] and have a greater love for the things
[1:29:03] of the world and less and less love for
[1:29:05] jesus
[1:29:06] amen brother whatever you're giving your
[1:29:08] preeminence to in your everyday
[1:29:10] life that's what you love amen
[1:29:13] so when you in morning noon and night
[1:29:15] what are you living for how are you
[1:29:17] living what are you doing and what are
[1:29:19] you hungry and thirsty for amen
[1:29:21] that determines what your where your
[1:29:23] love is amen
[1:29:25] and then again brother it's what love is
[1:29:27] what he's looking for
[1:29:28] a divine love yes but it's a love for
[1:29:31] him
[1:29:32] amen amen by the grace of almighty god
[1:29:37] amen so brother i pray the grace of god
[1:29:39] amen that our love for him
[1:29:41] is what's bringing us closer and closer
[1:29:43] to the resurrection
[1:29:44] our love for him is bringing us into a
[1:29:46] greater and a greater
[1:29:48] amen experience of the anointing of the
[1:29:50] holy ghost resurrection and rapture in
[1:29:52] us
[1:29:52] amen listen we're looking for the
[1:29:54] rapture looking for the resurrection but
[1:29:56] again
[1:29:57] understand that what god is going to do
[1:29:59] in the natural and physically god has
[1:30:01] already done
[1:30:02] in the spiritual amen he has resurrected
[1:30:05] us
[1:30:06] amen praise the lord and he has
[1:30:09] raptured us by the grace of god and
[1:30:12] again
[1:30:12] like i said before allow me to repeat it
[1:30:16] that when i i mentioned that in another
[1:30:18] church and i was preaching and
[1:30:20] and not in newfoundland and uh
[1:30:24] and i ministered and when i said that
[1:30:26] everybody got quiet
[1:30:28] i said i've been resurrected i've been
[1:30:29] raptured and they they they
[1:30:32] i can see them now getting right quiet
[1:30:34] and looking at one another
[1:30:36] yeah and i remember even the pastor
[1:30:38] looking around at the congregation and
[1:30:40] shaking his head
[1:30:41] no no and i said well i gotta prove it
[1:30:46] i said because he has quickened me
[1:30:49] because i was dead in sins he's made me
[1:30:51] alive
[1:30:52] amen i've experienced resurrection for
[1:30:55] you at the quicken
[1:30:57] i trust you had that experience amen
[1:31:00] now you have the experience with jesus
[1:31:01] you have the experience with god amen
[1:31:03] you're not dead you're alive
[1:31:05] amen spiritually eternally amen you've
[1:31:08] got eternal life
[1:31:09] in your soul amen and
[1:31:13] you had the quicken who were dead
[1:31:16] quicker means to make alive
[1:31:18] amen you are the quicken who were dead
[1:31:20] in sins
[1:31:22] and trespasses we were born in sin amen
[1:31:25] spiritually dead but by the grace of god
[1:31:28] responding to the word god quickened the
[1:31:29] seed
[1:31:30] hallelujah and we came back to life in
[1:31:33] our souls
[1:31:33] instead of looking and living for the
[1:31:35] world and the things of the world
[1:31:37] oh my we started to focus and put the
[1:31:40] emphasis on on god
[1:31:41] on jesus on the word of god on what god
[1:31:43] has done and what god is doing and what
[1:31:45] he will do
[1:31:46] amen we begin to live for that by the
[1:31:48] grace of god
[1:31:49] amen because i you at the quicken
[1:31:52] amen the power the anointing of the
[1:31:54] resurrection brings you back to the word
[1:31:56] amen because we need it to get the faith
[1:31:59] to go on
[1:32:01] we need it to know what god requires of
[1:32:03] us know what god's expecting of us
[1:32:05] in the hour that we're living amen and
[1:32:07] so i said now i said go on down another
[1:32:09] four verses
[1:32:10] or five verses in ephesians two and i
[1:32:13] said it's right there
[1:32:14] and i said we have been caught up into
[1:32:16] heavenly places in christ
[1:32:18] amen praise the lord you have i said
[1:32:21] yeah
[1:32:22] i said i was resurrected no i said i'm
[1:32:24] raptured i'm caught up into a heavenly
[1:32:26] place in christ
[1:32:27] and the prophet of god said well he said
[1:32:29] what's going on there
[1:32:31] what's going on in every phase of christ
[1:32:34] he said the word is being revealed
[1:32:36] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:32:39] the word is being revealed to give us
[1:32:40] the faith
[1:32:41] to keep moving on amen the word is being
[1:32:44] revealed to give us resurrection and
[1:32:46] rapturing faith
[1:32:47] for our physical bodies amen so to get
[1:32:50] out of time
[1:32:51] and into glory praise the name of the
[1:32:53] lord
[1:32:54] so i said i pray grace that you're that
[1:32:56] you that believe god you that

[1:33:00] you have experienced
[1:33:01] resurrection in your soul and your and

[1:33:06] and raptured spiritually into christ
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:10] praise the lord you're here because you
[1:33:12] believe that you've had that experience
[1:33:14] and why because now you're you're
[1:33:15] raptured out into every place in christ
[1:33:18] and he's revealing the word

[1:33:22] revelation of the word he's really
[1:33:24] given make this real to you make that
[1:33:26] real to you amen
[1:33:27] but yet there are so many professing
[1:33:29] christians that
[1:33:30] christians that brother that have not
[1:33:33] experienced that resurrection
[1:33:35] now they haven't experienced that
[1:33:38] rapture
[1:33:39] of being caught up in heavenly places in
[1:33:40] christ they're religious
[1:33:43] but they're caught up into a church but
[1:33:44] not into glory
[1:33:46] not inc not in christ amen by the grace
[1:33:49] of god

[1:34:28] preached
[1:34:29] but that was his purpose in doing what
[1:34:31] he did amen
[1:34:32] was to bring us into fellowship with him
[1:34:35] and with the revelation of who he
[1:34:37] is our relationship with god
[1:34:40] amen brothers see we got to get out of
[1:34:42] the natural

[1:35:27] and is crowned
[1:35:28] with divine love amen

[1:35:35] amen amen but this is what he said
[1:35:38] in revelation concerning the church ages

[1:35:42] and concerning the last age the days
[1:35:45] that you and i are in and that
[1:35:47] we've experienced it amen and we know
[1:35:49] that according to the scriptures
[1:35:51] this is this is what's going on and has
[1:35:53] gone on in the churches
[1:35:55] amen oh yes i believe that when it comes
[1:35:57] to
[1:35:58] denominations out there i believe that
[1:36:00] there's many out there and i believe
[1:36:01] that
[1:36:02] they'll be they'll lay down their lives
[1:36:03] in the in the great tribulation
[1:36:05] many will but they won't go into the
[1:36:07] rest they're not going into a rapture
[1:36:09] amen but but i bet if they're
[1:36:12] predestinated and they're
[1:36:13] ordained of god and they're part of the
[1:36:15] bride of christ or they're going to go
[1:36:16] into rapture they're going to get what
[1:36:18] god
[1:36:18] is doing in this hour they're going to
[1:36:20] oh yeah god will bring them into the
[1:36:22] word to the message to give them
[1:36:23] rapturing faith
[1:36:24] amen and it is the invisible union of
[1:36:27] the heavenly bridegroom
[1:36:28] and the earthly bride amen that's going
[1:36:31] on
[1:36:32] but again there are many that are not
[1:36:34] bright amen
[1:36:36] the bride is going to live in the city
[1:36:37] and the rest are going to be outside the
[1:36:39] city
[1:36:40] so keep your attitude right as i said
[1:36:42] keep your spirit right
[1:36:44] keep your motive and your objectives
[1:36:45] right amen don't look down your noses
[1:36:48] and say well they don't believe the
[1:36:49] message they're doing this they're going
[1:36:51] there they believe that
[1:36:52] well well if if they do then they're not
[1:36:56] bright
[1:36:56] if they're bright they will believe the
[1:36:58] message but brother all that
[1:37:00] although that to receive eternal life
[1:37:02] and we're going to heaven
[1:37:04] amen and we're going to come back to
[1:37:05] earth in the new jerusalem
[1:37:07] and so on a new heaven and new earth
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:11] brother we're going to be in the in sit
[1:37:14] with the bride
[1:37:14] groom in his throne set with the
[1:37:17] bridegroom
[1:37:18] at the marriage supper of the lamb by
[1:37:19] the grace of god but still there's going
[1:37:21] to be many others
[1:37:23] outside the city amen
[1:37:26] don't think and as i've said i've had to
[1:37:27] deal with that from the first time i
[1:37:29] come to this message
[1:37:30] and as i said april night when i was
[1:37:32] asked to preach for really the first
[1:37:34] time in a congregation
[1:37:35] amen being 20 years old whatever and uh
[1:37:39] and i had to preach on matthew chapter
[1:37:41] 20 matthew
[1:37:43] 5 rather chapter 5 the last maybe a few
[1:37:45] verses
[1:37:46] and i said if you love them which love
[1:37:48] you what reward of you
[1:37:49] but he said you got to love those out
[1:37:51] there too amen
[1:37:53] gotta have respect to them by the grace
[1:37:55] of god
[1:37:56] and so i preached that and again let me
[1:37:59] say this
[1:37:59] that was it the truth well i believe it
[1:38:02] was the truth
[1:38:03] and after i preached it god vindicated
[1:38:05] it with a message in tongues
[1:38:07] and a brother bill again interpreted
[1:38:11] amen and he confirmed he was confirming
[1:38:13] what i
[1:38:14] said what i preached and he said it
[1:38:17] wasn't a man
[1:38:18] it was god it was my word said the lord
[1:38:21] amen and they were encouraged to to take
[1:38:24] heed to what was preached
[1:38:26] amen and the pastor getting up amen and
[1:38:29] he and he was encouraging me good he
[1:38:31] said thank the lord
[1:38:32] brother you explained it thank you amen
[1:38:35] because he was misunderstanding me as
[1:38:37] well
[1:38:38] god help us brother sister amen and just
[1:38:41] to think again
[1:38:42] that uh basically and i'm the only
[1:38:45] pastor in newfoundland that i know of
[1:38:47] right now
[1:38:47] amen so the great and better yet i was
[1:38:50] even prophesying those things
[1:38:52] of what was going to happen oh yeah i
[1:38:55] told this pastor i told this one
[1:38:57] this is what's going to happen amen and
[1:39:00] again there's
[1:39:00] maybe i might have been 10 or 15 years
[1:39:02] ago now that i
[1:39:04] i was talking to our brother guy and i
[1:39:06] said brother listen let me
[1:39:07] show you this amen this was moving
[1:39:11] around the message this was going on i
[1:39:14] said brother
[1:39:14] be on your guard i should be on your
[1:39:17] toes
[1:39:18] amen i said because you're going to be
[1:39:21] dealing with those
[1:39:21] those things amen that's right
[1:39:25] and he had a church oh my
[1:39:28] i guess when he started there might have
[1:39:29] been 100 people there or more
[1:39:31] and now there might be a dozen although
[1:39:34] he's gone on
[1:39:36] amen he's gone on and just before he
[1:39:39] went on
[1:39:40] amen he called me and said brother
[1:39:43] pray for me pray for me i said brother
[1:39:46] encourage
[1:39:47] let me encourage you he said i should
[1:39:49] just keep trusting the lord
[1:39:50] and move on and in three months the lord
[1:39:53] took him home
[1:39:55] now amen so brother been fighting those
[1:39:58] spirits amen
[1:39:59] god has ordained it why because the
[1:40:01] ministry is going to be
[1:40:02] what encouraging believers to believe
[1:40:05] this believe this amen to have this
[1:40:07] attitude in this spirit
[1:40:08] amen and because god is going to do this
[1:40:10] god is doing this now
[1:40:12] amen and god is going to do this
[1:40:13] tomorrow amen
[1:40:16] bro help us lord to keep our spirits
[1:40:18] right our attitude is right
[1:40:20] brother because jesus loved them
[1:40:24] oh yeah even on the cross he suffered so
[1:40:26] much and then he said
[1:40:27] father forgive them for they know not
[1:40:29] what they do
[1:40:31] oh amazing so we thank god god help us
[1:40:35] to have that
[1:40:36] that love that he had amen if we get
[1:40:39] into that phase
[1:40:40] and where we're whereas jesus was
[1:40:42] crucified
[1:40:43] naturally that we might be end up and be
[1:40:45] crucified spiritually
[1:40:47] that they're going to put a pressure on
[1:40:48] us that we are going to believe
[1:40:50] amen but before they begin to kill the
[1:40:53] people
[1:40:53] amen during the great tribulation

[1:44:14] in you and around you
[1:44:16] to a lot of people that's just outside
[1:44:19] oh yeah the prophet acknowledged that
[1:44:21] he said they got the anointing in their
[1:44:22] flesh but it's not in their heart
[1:44:25] not in their soul and again let me say
[1:44:27] it again he said you're in the message
[1:44:29] but the message is not in you
[1:44:31] amazing he was preaching that to his own
[1:44:33] church
[1:44:35] amen he said you're in the message but
[1:44:37] the message is not in
[1:44:39] you amen make sure the message is in you
[1:44:44] because god brother amen regardless of
[1:44:47] the age and the message
[1:44:48] brother god's looking for the message in
[1:44:51] us
[1:44:52] he was looking for the message in it all
[1:44:54] down through from paul
[1:44:55] irenaeus and martin and columba and
[1:44:57] luther wesley
[1:44:59] and the elijah ministry of this hour
[1:45:02] amen

[1:45:06] you
[1:45:07] in you and controlling you from the soul
[1:45:10] by the grace of god
[1:45:11] amen so brother because that in luther's
[1:45:14] age
[1:45:15] there were those that god was looking
[1:45:16] for and the message of justification was
[1:45:18] in them and they went and lived it
[1:45:21] amen it was sincere they were sincere
[1:45:24] with that revelation
[1:45:25] amen and they really lived and the life
[1:45:27] their lives proved it
[1:45:29] amen by the grace of god so brother
[1:45:32] amen our lives are going to prove what
[1:45:35] we believe
[1:45:36] because why because we're going to be
[1:45:38] living looking looking looking
[1:45:39] for the resurrection looking for the
[1:45:41] rapture all looking up all looking up

[1:45:57] rich
[1:45:58] and white raiment that thou mayest be

[1:46:12] you're going to see what and the way
[1:46:14] here god sees it
[1:46:15] amen not the way the church is telling

[1:53:01] but now thus saith the lord that created
[1:53:04] thee
[1:53:06] yes did he continue his relationship
[1:53:09] with you
[1:53:11] amen
[1:53:15] thus saith the lord that created thee o
[1:53:17] jacob
[1:53:18] and he that formed thee
[1:53:22] o israel fear not
[1:53:26] for i have redeemed thee
[1:53:29] i have called thee by thy name
[1:53:32] thou art mine amen
[1:53:36] are you is i trust you belong to him not
[1:53:38] to the church
[1:53:41] amen when thou passes through the waters
[1:53:45] i will be with thee and
[1:53:49] through the rivers they shall not
[1:53:51] overflow thee
[1:53:52] and when thou walkest through the fire
[1:53:54] thou shalt not be burned
[1:53:56] amazing neither shall the flame
[1:54:00] kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy
[1:54:04] god
[1:54:04] the holy one of israel thy savior
[1:54:08] i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and
[1:54:11] siba for thee
[1:54:12] and since thou was precious in my sight
[1:54:16] thou has been honorable and i have
[1:54:19] loved thee amen
[1:54:22] but brother what this relationship
[1:54:24] produced with a total separation from
[1:54:26] unbelief amen staying
[1:54:30] with the lord therefore he said will i
[1:54:33] give men for thee
[1:54:34] and people for thy life and he should
[1:54:37] fear not
[1:54:38] for i am with thee and i will bring thy
[1:54:41] seed from the east
[1:54:42] and gather thee from the west amen
[1:54:46] and i will say to the north give up and
[1:54:48] to the south keep not back
[1:54:50] bring my sons from far and my daughters
[1:54:53] from the ends of the earth
[1:54:54] amen it's it's his children
[1:54:58] it's his seed it's his sons it's his
[1:55:00] daughters
[1:55:01] are you his son are you his daughter
[1:55:05] amen are you the seed of god
[1:55:08] by the grace of god amen
[1:55:11] brother so that we're born of god not of
[1:55:14] the devil
[1:55:15] amen brother god
[1:55:18] said the lord that created jacob and he
[1:55:21] formed jacob
[1:55:23] and he's and he said fear not for i have
[1:55:26] redeemed thee
[1:55:28] amen i have called thee by thy name
[1:55:32] thou art mine amen
[1:55:35] because they're totally separated onto
[1:55:37] the lord
[1:55:38] in god in in delivering israel out of
[1:55:41] egypt
[1:55:42] god gave them the the instructions and
[1:55:44] the command
[1:55:45] that when you come out and you're going
[1:55:47] to journey to the land that i have
[1:55:49] promised you
[1:55:50] the promised land and he said you're
[1:55:51] going to pass through this
[1:55:53] you're going to pass near this city
[1:55:55] you'll pass near this one and that one
[1:55:57] but he said if you want water if you
[1:55:59] want something extra
[1:56:00] go down and get it but don't stay there
[1:56:02] come back
[1:56:03] amen so then why because that's going to
[1:56:07] influence you
[1:56:08] that will influence israel and that they
[1:56:10] were going to maybe
[1:56:11] live like them and so on and it got to
[1:56:14] the place
[1:56:15] where they where they got to the
[1:56:16] promised land and they wouldn't go in
[1:56:18] and possess the promised land
[1:56:19] yet in spite of all that god did for
[1:56:22] them
[1:56:23] in delivering them out of egypt and all
[1:56:25] that god did for them
[1:56:26] in delivering them through the
[1:56:27] wilderness that they traveled amen
[1:56:30] still they never had that faith to
[1:56:32] believe god would deliver them
[1:56:34] from those that were living in the
[1:56:35] promised land amen
[1:56:37] brother i pray god in the name of jesus

[1:56:42] the resurrection

[2:00:08] hunger for it wesley had what was in him
[2:00:10] and he was hungry for it
[2:00:11] and the pentecostal photographer amen
[2:00:13] yeah it's like the salvation army

[2:00:35] in the bible amen praise the lord and
[2:00:38] the prophet of god

[2:08:43] amen because he went and he went and he
[2:08:46] went and
[2:08:46] i don't know how long that he was
[2:08:47] searching for searching for it wondering
[2:08:49] what he had to do wondering what he
[2:08:51] could do
[2:08:51] to be justified until finally he was
[2:08:54] overwhelmed and oh my
[2:08:56] exhausted till he came into the church
[2:08:58] he was oh my
[2:09:00] he's coming to the end that he that all
[2:09:02] after all these years he didn't he never
[2:09:04] found the revelation
[2:09:05] until finally he came into the church
[2:09:08] and into the vestibule
[2:09:09] and they had a bible on a table there
[2:09:12] and he just went over
[2:09:13] and he opened it up and he looked looked
[2:09:16] at it

[2:09:22] he said what he read it again
[2:09:25] oh jesus justified me oh he said
[2:09:29] it struck him and he was overwhelmed
[2:09:32] amen

[2:09:36] amen oh he made all kinds of sacrifices
[2:09:39] he did this he did that
[2:09:40] his good works and everything thinking
[2:09:42] that oh this will justify me that'll
[2:09:44] justify me
[2:09:45] then he came and he said show it in the
[2:09:47] word jesus justified him
[2:09:51] he struck him and he gave him the peace
[2:09:53] and the love and he started to cry
[2:09:55] and praise the lord and worship jesus
[2:09:58] thank you thank you thank you he went
[2:10:00] away with peace
[2:10:02] he was justified but still
[2:10:07] do you believe he smoked yes he smoked
[2:10:11] yeah and i sure might have been pipes
[2:10:14] that that spoke back then
[2:10:16] but he smoked yeah and he did this and
[2:10:19] he did that
[2:10:20] well that's as far as that's the
[2:10:21] revelation that god was looking for
[2:10:23] so he went forth and living praising the
[2:10:26] lord hallelujah thanking god
[2:10:28] amen but again as more and more light is
[2:10:31] revealed
[2:10:32] more and more revelation is revealed
[2:10:34] down through the ages
[2:10:35] where we're getting more and more
[2:10:37] separated unto the lord
[2:10:39] by the grace of god amen more and more
[2:10:42] celebrated
[2:10:42] on for the resurrection and for the
[2:10:44] rapture amen
[2:10:46] because brother but if but that's but
[2:10:48] god did what he wanted to do in the in
[2:10:50] the in the lutheran age
[2:10:52] in the methodist age the same thing in
[2:10:54] the pentecostal age where he was coming
[2:10:56] more and more into
[2:10:57] holiness and they were getting more and
[2:11:00] more revelation
[2:11:01] separate god was taking away the desire
[2:11:03] for sin taking away the desire for that
[2:11:05] the desire for that god help us
[2:11:07] amen brother till we get into another
[2:11:11] oh yeah i tell well tell you this oh my
[2:11:14] praise the lord
[2:11:15] god took away the the the desire for sin
[2:11:17] and luther and wesley
[2:11:19] but in wesley's age it was more they
[2:11:21] separated themselves from more
[2:11:23] unbelief more of the works of satan
[2:11:27] amen and in the pentecostal age it was
[2:11:30] even greater
[2:11:31] more and more separation why because
[2:11:33] what god had done
[2:11:34] what god was doing in that pentecostal
[2:11:36] age amen the anointing took this away
[2:11:39] from them took that away from them took
[2:11:40] this away why
[2:11:41] they were all becoming more and more and
[2:11:43] more new creatures
[2:11:44] in christ amen reflecting jesus
[2:11:48] more and more and more amen like the
[2:11:51] prophets of old
[2:11:52] that in the old testament they were
[2:11:54] reflecting jesus amen
[2:11:56] praise the lord and jesus they were
[2:11:58] prophets but they laid down their lives
[2:12:00] but they never picked them up again
[2:12:01] amen but jesus was the god prophet amen
[2:12:05] he laid down his life picked it up again
[2:12:07] praise the lord
[2:12:08] and he went on to this went on to that
[2:12:10] life that life that life
[2:12:12] amen and through the baptism of the holy
[2:12:14] ghost but then brother it all went into
[2:12:16] darkness
[2:12:17] and then god started to god started to
[2:12:19] redeem the church
[2:12:20] amen bring us to redemption in luther
[2:12:24] amen and and again they cease from this
[2:12:27] but not that but then in wesley's age oh
[2:12:30] my there's a greater separation
[2:12:32] from sin in the pentecostal age a
[2:12:35] greater separation from sin
[2:12:37] amen and now in the bright age it ought
[2:12:39] to be a greater
[2:12:40] separation from sin amen
[2:12:44] yeah the works of the flesh and also
[2:12:47] believe in the word
[2:12:48] or not believe in the word god help us
[2:12:52] the bride that goes in a resurrection
[2:12:54] rapture totally believes god
[2:12:56] she is separated unto the lord
[2:12:59] totally amen that he is our bridegroom
[2:13:04] and we are his bride
[2:13:08] god help us amen
[2:13:12] so he said again
[2:13:15] in corinthians
[2:13:18] what agreement is the temple of god with
[2:13:21] idols
[2:13:21] for year the temple of the living god as
[2:13:24] god has said
[2:13:25] i will dwell in them and walk in them
[2:13:27] and i will be their god
[2:13:29] and they shall be my people amen that
[2:13:32] he's living in you
[2:13:34] praise the lord that's tremendous he's
[2:13:37] living in you
[2:13:38] you're spiritual you're spiritual in
[2:13:40] your thoughts
[2:13:41] spiritually in your words spiritually
[2:13:42] your deeds your counsel
[2:13:44] yeah by the grace of god
[2:13:47] amen
[2:13:52] and he said wherefore come out from
[2:13:54] among them
[2:13:55] and be separate said the lord and touch
[2:13:58] not the unclean thing
[2:14:00] and i will receive you and will be a
[2:14:03] father unto you and ye shall be my
[2:14:07] sons and daughters saith the lord
[2:14:10] almighty amen brother
[2:14:14] and it calls for a total separation from
[2:14:17] unbelief
[2:14:18] a total separation from the thoughts of
[2:14:21] man
[2:14:21] to the revelation of god amen is not
[2:14:24] what i think it's
[2:14:26] not what i see is what god reveals amen
[2:14:30] by grace so i can't again
[2:14:34] i want to i don't have time oh
[2:14:38] so just to share with you a couple of
[2:14:39] the quotes and we can
[2:14:41] share others later but you find in the
[2:14:43] scriptures
[2:14:44] god always has and always will require
[2:14:48] separation amen
[2:14:53] and now he should the thought of god's
[2:14:55] word
[2:14:56] after he read his scripture he said is
[2:14:59] calling a total separation
[2:15:02] and we only know this as we read the
[2:15:04] word and see the word
[2:15:05] manifest itself he said god separated
[2:15:09] the light from the darkness
[2:15:11] so the word of god began to separate the
[2:15:14] light from the darkness
[2:15:15] from the beginning so does it remain
[2:15:17] till this day
[2:15:19] amen and he said as i said last night
[2:15:22] of jesus when he was only 12 years old
[2:15:25] and being a mistake of his mother
[2:15:28] who claimed by people to be the mother
[2:15:30] of god
[2:15:31] and now that the woman said why thy
[2:15:33] father and i have sought thee with tears
[2:15:37] and quickly he being the word said
[2:15:40] knowest thou
[2:15:41] that i must be about my father's
[2:15:44] business she says my father and i have
[2:15:47] sought thee with tears
[2:15:49] we've been looking for you but he was in
[2:15:51] the temple
[2:15:52] teaching the elders amen he was 12 years
[2:15:55] old
[2:15:57] amen see she was declaring him to be
[2:16:00] joseph's son but he wasn't joseph's son
[2:16:04] and if he had been joseph's son he had
[2:16:06] been with him
[2:16:08] but he he was with the father
[2:16:11] amen about his business so the word is
[2:16:14] always corrective
[2:16:16] and always write and the word will
[2:16:18] correct
[2:16:19] every wrong amen amen amen
[2:16:23] the holy ghost is there to convict us
[2:16:26] and brother we're gonna
[2:16:27] we're gonna sense that quite often why
[2:16:29] because we're born in sin
[2:16:32] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[2:16:34] speaking lies
[2:16:35] amen this sinful this body
[2:16:38] we came by by way of the original sin
[2:16:41] amen
[2:16:42] oh yeah and that sin as an influence
[2:16:46] in our lives yeah
[2:16:49] oh it does thank god but only when you
[2:16:52] get in a new body it won't be there
[2:16:55] that's right that original sin
[2:16:58] you know what i'm talking about yeah
[2:17:02] by the grace of god but thank god
[2:17:06] he's given us grace to control it
[2:17:09] that original sin oh yeah by the grace
[2:17:12] of god
[2:17:13] amen so i i said i'm not going to say
[2:17:16] what it was you know what it was
[2:17:18] we could mention that some other time
[2:17:21] amen
[2:17:22] but pray the grace of god in your
[2:17:24] experience with jesus
[2:17:25] that you control hit and it doesn't
[2:17:28] control
[2:17:28] you amen
[2:17:32] amen because we are all came by
[2:17:35] as a result of that original sin that's
[2:17:38] why we're born in sin
[2:17:41] it's because we came that way amen
[2:17:45] that's not to see people don't
[2:17:46] understand you know they think it's just
[2:17:48] just the thought of god
[2:17:50] oh god said this so i believe god that
[2:17:52] we were born in sin
[2:17:54] you know and that's why i have this
[2:17:55] nature and so on but they don't stop to
[2:17:57] consider
[2:17:58] how they were conceived and how they
[2:18:00] were born
[2:18:02] god had mercy on us amen
[2:18:06] but god is there by the holy ghost
[2:18:10] amen to give us more and more and more
[2:18:12] control
[2:18:13] over the sin in the flesh
[2:18:17] amen to god be the glory amen
[2:18:21] grace brother
[2:18:25] because i know that sometimes people
[2:18:27] just don't don't quite
[2:18:28] catch it concerning that original sin
[2:18:32] until until one time a certain brother
[2:18:36] approached me
[2:18:39] and he said brother girl
[2:18:43] i want you to pray for so and so
[2:18:47] and i said oh i said what's the need
[2:18:50] oh he said well it has to do with the
[2:18:54] original sin
[2:18:57] but they're not fulfilling it in in
[2:19:00] their marriage life
[2:19:02] they wouldn't do this and wouldn't do
[2:19:04] this and wouldn't do that
[2:19:06] well well
[2:19:10] maybe they were entering the will of god
[2:19:12] for the birth of a seed of god
[2:19:15] because the prophet said that he said
[2:19:17] serpent seed
[2:19:19] can bring forth the seed of god
[2:19:23] and he said there's seed of god sons and
[2:19:26] daughters
[2:19:27] king that the woman can give birth to a
[2:19:29] serpent seed
[2:19:31] oh yeah that's definitely god help us to
[2:19:34] recognize it
[2:19:36] god help us to give us his leadership in
[2:19:39] it
[2:19:39] and his control by grace amen
[2:19:44] grace i said all right brother i'll pray
[2:19:47] grace
[2:19:47] god's grace to him i said he needs to
[2:19:50] they need to come to
[2:19:51] a greater revelation of what it's all
[2:19:55] about
[2:19:56] amen amen
[2:20:01] see christ being the word said knowest
[2:20:06] thou
[2:20:06] not that i must be about my father's
[2:20:09] business
[2:20:10] amen and she was declaring him to be
[2:20:14] joseph's son
[2:20:15] but he wasn't he had been with him but
[2:20:18] he was with the father
[2:20:19] about his business so the word is always
[2:20:22] corrective
[2:20:23] always right and the word will correct
[2:20:26] every wrong
[2:20:27] always amen praise the lord
[2:20:32] let the word correct you not my will
[2:20:34] father
[2:20:35] thine be done grace
[2:20:39] amen remember again he said he separated
[2:20:42] the light from the darkness
[2:20:44] he said let there be light and it's been
[2:20:47] doing that ever since
[2:20:48] separating light from darkness and god's
[2:20:51] word was
[2:20:52] also separated the water from the land
[2:20:55] in the beginning god spoke
[2:20:56] and the water was separated from the
[2:20:59] land
[2:21:00] amen by the grace of god
[2:21:03] well yeah that's why we
[2:21:07] have the oceans but we have the land as
[2:21:10] a sister
[2:21:11] an elderly sister that was in some years
[2:21:14] ago

[2:21:32] i always took an hour
[2:21:34] one hour and i came out one day
[2:21:37] and this manager of the home or the the
[2:21:39] one that run the home was sitting on a
[2:21:41] chair outside

[2:22:38] others they'll say
[2:22:40] it takes them all year to say it he said

[2:23:35] going to come back to
[2:23:36] to as earth again oh

[2:24:25] city
[2:24:26] oh yes he said it's going to be a big
[2:24:27] city but it's going to be 1500 miles
[2:24:30] it's not like i heard a preacher
[2:24:32] preaching in a denominational church one
[2:24:33] time all to respect him
[2:24:36] and he was preaching about the new
[2:24:37] jerusalem but to him
[2:24:39] he made the people believe that it was
[2:24:41] square it's going to be
[2:24:43] coming it's like a square chunk and it's
[2:24:45] going to be 1500 miles up
[2:24:47] across and down you know but no
[2:24:51] it's it's coming 1500 miles at the
[2:24:53] foundation
[2:24:55] amen but when it comes to and it'll be
[2:24:57] 15 mile 100 miles up
[2:24:58] high but it's like it's like a
[2:25:02] a pyramid amen now
[2:25:05] where in the world you're going to live
[2:25:06] in a city that that's there's a square
[2:25:09] block
[2:25:10] you know 1500 miles wide narrow
[2:25:14] high you know all around the foundations
[2:25:17] and everything
[2:25:17] i said lord i said i don't understand i
[2:25:20] said why he believes that i said that's
[2:25:22] not normal
[2:25:23] but the foundation it's going to be like
[2:25:25] a pyramid by the grace of god
[2:25:27] and the bride is going to sit with him
[2:25:29] amen the bride's going to have access
[2:25:31] amen by the grace of god and if you you
[2:25:34] want a copy of it you want to like a
[2:25:36] little more
[2:25:37] testimony of it go
[2:25:40] yeah you won't be able to go now but if
[2:25:42] you had the opportunity you go to the
[2:25:44] pyramids in egypt
[2:25:45] amen wonderful it's amazing because in
[2:25:49] the pyramid one of the pyramids in egypt
[2:25:51] oh yeah they got a door to go in and you
[2:25:53] can go down
[2:25:54] and you can go up and you climb climb
[2:25:58] climb you've got you got steps for this
[2:26:01] level of that level and finally the
[2:26:03] steps at the top is seven
[2:26:05] steps for the last to the last level
[2:26:08] amen and it's where the king
[2:26:12] dwells amen and you can climb climb
[2:26:15] climb up
[2:26:16] those seven steps and here's the king
[2:26:19] amen
[2:26:20] and the queen is going to sit with him
[2:26:21] in his throne
[2:26:23] amen it's going to be that new jerusalem
[2:26:27] so by the grace of god i trust we're
[2:26:28] going to be there
[2:26:30] amen in the new jerusalem
[2:26:33] and there were those that were thinking
[2:26:35] that well where is it going to be
[2:26:38] well the prophet did i like the fact
[2:26:39] that it could be somewhere
[2:26:41] where in the area where israel is but
[2:26:43] it's not going to be there be no
[2:26:45] mediterranean sea won't be there for
[2:26:47] sure the dead sea won't be there
[2:26:50] sure that and uh but it could be in that
[2:26:53] area
[2:26:53] when it comes to 1500 miles because
[2:26:56] israel is not that
[2:26:57] not very big you know because again some
[2:27:00] of us had been to israel and so on
[2:27:03] so it's not not big and it may take
[2:27:05] longer to go around newfoundland than it
[2:27:07] would be israel
[2:27:08] so so thank thank god for that
[2:27:12] but i don't know where it's going to be
[2:27:13] others were saying it's going to be in
[2:27:15] in the united states i don't think so
[2:27:19] no definitely not and
[2:27:23] they even they even gave us the names of
[2:27:25] the place
[2:27:26] in states where where was going to be i
[2:27:28] said no no no no
[2:27:30] no and the prophet of god delight he
[2:27:33] said oh
[2:27:33] it's gonna cover all of jerusalem all of
[2:27:36] israel and
[2:27:37] and cover this and cover that all he
[2:27:39] said when it goes it'll go from there
[2:27:41] down to here there over there he was
[2:27:44] explaining it
[2:27:45] so thank god glory i pray grace that
[2:27:48] we're going to be there
[2:27:50] in the new jerusalem amen by the grace
[2:27:53] of god
[2:27:55] i'll let the finish with a quote here
[2:27:58] amen
[2:27:59] and like i said we'll try to finish the
[2:28:01] rest of it
[2:28:03] in the next service god in the beginning
[2:28:06] again
[2:28:07] he said he separated the light from the
[2:28:09] darkness and it's been doing that
[2:28:11] ever since separating light from
[2:28:15] darkness
[2:28:16] so if there's anything that's darkness
[2:28:18] in your in your heart or in your
[2:28:20] in your life not your heart but in your
[2:28:22] life
[2:28:23] any darkness that you're involved with
[2:28:25] or caught up with
[2:28:26] god's going to separate us from it
[2:28:29] remember it's got to be a total
[2:28:30] separation for the resurrection and the
[2:28:33] rapture
[2:28:34] oh yeah totally brother i tell you this
[2:28:38] the prophet did say he said you know and
[2:28:40] when that rapture happens when the
[2:28:41] resurrection takes place
[2:28:43] he said what's going to happen well he
[2:28:44] said you could be walking down here and
[2:28:46] you'll see somebody
[2:28:48] who's that oh
[2:28:52] oh that's that's my brother
[2:28:56] oh we're he's he's dead no
[2:29:00] he's come back from that other dimension
[2:29:02] because the dead in christ are going to
[2:29:04] appear to the living saints
[2:29:06] amen and then we re some
[2:29:09] i tell you the rest of the world won't
[2:29:11] recognize them but if you're seed of god
[2:29:13] you'll recognize them
[2:29:14] amen praise the lord so you'll recognize
[2:29:18] them
[2:29:19] and you're going to be cut into that
[2:29:20] dimension with them and we're going to
[2:29:21] be in glorified bodies
[2:29:23] and look up and there's jesus amen
[2:29:26] because that pillar of fire christ and
[2:29:28] the pillar of fire will rise up
[2:29:30] and he'll go up and get into that body
[2:29:32] called jesus and come back down
[2:29:35] to receive us unto himself how many want
[2:29:38] to see him
[2:29:41] probably god said he wanted to enter us
[2:29:42] to introduce us to jesus
[2:29:45] but then then he said he himself he
[2:29:47] wanted to crawl up
[2:29:49] and put his hands on jesus feet and bow
[2:29:52] to him
[2:29:53] yeah grace of god thank you jesus
[2:29:58] amen he said the water was separated
[2:30:02] from the land well god's going to do
[2:30:04] away with most of the water
[2:30:06] and there'll be a testimony of that in
[2:30:08] in revelation chapter 21 i believe it is
[2:30:11] grace it says god never speaks a word
[2:30:16] unless he's got a reason for speaking
[2:30:18] that word and god had a reason for
[2:30:20] speaking that word tonight
[2:30:22] he is not like you and i
[2:30:26] or especially myself he said that speaks
[2:30:28] so many foolish things
[2:30:31] god speaks every word with a meaning and
[2:30:33] something that he is trying to achieve
[2:30:36] and will achieve by his word and it will
[2:30:39] perform exactly what he said
[2:30:41] it will do and if god said let there be
[2:30:44] light there was and there was no light
[2:30:46] he said it wasn't god that said it
[2:30:50] or he said when god says anything he
[2:30:52] must back up what he says
[2:30:54] and when the word of god has been
[2:30:55] vindicated the word has been vindicated
[2:30:57] that is light
[2:30:58] and he said the word itself
[2:31:02] isn't light until it is a vindicated
[2:31:05] light amen god said let there be
[2:31:10] light amen now today said if god has
[2:31:13] made a promise
[2:31:14] and he said when that promise is
[2:31:16] vindicated then that
[2:31:18] is light that's the light of the day
[2:31:20] when the word is vindicated
[2:31:22] he said the word for the hour is
[2:31:24] vindicated
[2:31:26] amen the word that we're believing and
[2:31:28] pressing on
[2:31:30] amen he spoke and separated the waters
[2:31:33] from the sea
[2:31:34] and then also he separated in genesis
[2:31:38] life from death and if we believe the
[2:31:41] word of god it's the word of life
[2:31:43] to us but if we question the word of god
[2:31:47] it's death to us amen
[2:31:50] like eve eve questioned one little face
[2:31:54] of god's word and what did it do caused
[2:31:57] all this trouble that we have
[2:32:00] today but you see there came death
[2:32:04] and god also at an atonement being
[2:32:06] merciful to us
[2:32:08] he accepted a substitute death for their
[2:32:11] death
[2:32:12] amen he separated life from death
[2:32:15] in the garden of eden he did it by his
[2:32:19] word
[2:32:20] amen and he is still speaking his word
[2:32:22] of life
[2:32:23] to those who want to believe it
[2:32:27] amen you got to want the word of god
[2:32:31] you want to god want the revelation oh
[2:32:34] yeah
[2:32:35] amen because your relationship with god
[2:32:38] it doesn't just begin when a person
[2:32:40] comes to an altar
[2:32:42] or you say lord i receive you as my
[2:32:43] savior and you go on just being
[2:32:45] religious
[2:32:45] so i'll come to the church you know
[2:32:47] sunday and wednesday or whatever
[2:32:50] yeah i'll do this and do that no it's
[2:32:53] your life
[2:32:54] everyday living by the grace of god
[2:32:58] yeah jesus has constantly told us that
[2:33:02] there is a separation
[2:33:04] and we find that the last thing that's
[2:33:06] predicted
[2:33:07] to the human race before the great and
[2:33:10] final day
[2:33:10] when we ascend into the presence of god
[2:33:13] quraish
[2:33:14] there will be a final separation and he
[2:33:17] will separate the sheep
[2:33:19] from the goats grace that we're all
[2:33:21] sheep
[2:33:23] amen amen
[2:33:26] god will continually has been separating
[2:33:30] separating and that's what he's doing
[2:33:32] tonight

[2:35:53] experience that experience this one that
[2:35:55] one
[2:35:56] amen to the grace of god
[2:35:59] and he said god will continually
[2:36:03] constantly told us that there is a
[2:36:05] separation and we find the last thing
[2:36:07] that's predicted
[2:36:08] to the human race before the great final
[2:36:10] day
[2:36:11] when we ascend into the presence of god
[2:36:13] there will be a final
[2:36:14] separation he will separate the sheep
[2:36:17] from the goats
[2:36:18] and continually has been separating
[2:36:20] separating and that's what he's doing
[2:36:22] tonight
[2:36:22] he separates faith from unbelief and we
[2:36:26] find out in number
[2:36:27] six chapter that a nazarite call and
[2:36:29] nazareth call was to separate themselves
[2:36:31] from
[2:36:32] all the world to the word of god
[2:36:35] that's a nazarite call separated
[2:36:39] he said samson was us nazareth unto the
[2:36:41] lord
[2:36:42] and god separated him amen
[2:36:45] i believe tonight that every man and
[2:36:47] woman every boy and girl that's born of
[2:36:50] the spirit of god
[2:36:51] is a nazarite on to the lord and you'll
[2:36:54] experience
[2:36:54] god's separation from the world the
[2:36:57] things of the world
[2:36:58] by the grace of god amen we'll leave it
[2:37:01] there
[2:37:02] and it's page four
[2:37:06] so we cut some of it we'll see
[2:37:09] what the lord would lead us to do okay
[2:37:12] but lord
[2:37:13] but brother sister my encouragement is
[2:37:16] please in the name of jesus
[2:37:19] consider what god is doing in your life
[2:37:22] on a daily basis
[2:37:23] and don't fail to recognize if god is
[2:37:26] doing something in your life
[2:37:29] separation if god has separated you from
[2:37:31] this separating from that
[2:37:33] god don't want you to get involved with
[2:37:34] this don't want to get involved with
[2:37:36] that
[2:37:36] by the grace of god lord why is it
[2:37:39] sometimes god help us that we're not
[2:37:42] going to blame the devil
[2:37:45] brother if it's if it's satan god
[2:37:47] permitting the devil to do it
[2:37:49] oh yeah last god will do that so brother
[2:37:52] i pray the grace of god that we'll pray
[2:37:54] about it
[2:37:54] and say lord this is your will amen
[2:37:57] praise the name of the lord
[2:37:59] so remember when things going on in your
[2:38:02] life going on in your life
[2:38:03] lord why are you permitting this why are
[2:38:05] you permitting that the lord is
[2:38:07] is it that you want me separate from
[2:38:08] this separate from that what is it lord
[2:38:11] amen it could be god
[2:38:14] working out total separation from
[2:38:16] unbelief in your life
[2:38:18] amen so we'll get into some of the
[2:38:20] thoughts that the prophet brings out in
[2:38:22] that message
[2:38:24] concerning separation where
[2:38:27] when how oh well uh i i don't
[2:38:31] maybe some of you did but now oh you
[2:38:33] went to the pubs
[2:38:35] you went there and there oh lord i don't
[2:38:37] go there no more i'm separated from them
[2:38:38] now
[2:38:39] no it could that separation could come
[2:38:42] closer
[2:38:43] oh yeah maybe god wants you to separate
[2:38:46] from this
[2:38:46] separate from that separate for
[2:38:48] something else separate from that one
[2:38:50] god help us god help us god bless you
