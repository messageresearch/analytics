[40:20] name we're asking it amen
[40:23] amen God bless you this evening thank
[40:24] you musicians you turn your scriptures
[40:27] to First Peter chapter 1 First Peter
[40:30] chapter one they may not have certainly
[40:31] been rejoicing over the news of the sale
[40:33] of the church so quickly considering it
[40:36] took the last uh the last owner a year
[40:38] and a half to sell it and we lowballed
[40:40] him heavily
[40:41] um and for us to be able to sell it for
[40:43] for what we did in as easily as we did
[40:45] we're just believing that was the Lord's
[40:47] work amen so we're very thankful for
[40:48] that certainly appreciate the hard work
[40:50] of the trustees to get us this far and
[40:53] just trusting the Lord to get us across
[40:55] that finish line but certainly looking
[40:57] forward to a place where we can have
[40:59] more time and fellowship and and draw
[41:01] closer together in the bonds of unity
[41:03] and love amen so I'm so thankful for
[41:05] that God is good and uh you know as as
[41:08] they were saying it goes quick
[41:11] and then when God wants to do something
[41:12] he can do it quick if he wants to amen
[41:15] and so we're just trusting he's in it
[41:16] and we're thankful for it and just want
[41:19] to make sure we each put our shoulder to
[41:20] the wheel where we're asked where we can
[41:22] help we want to do that to support our
[41:24] trustees and the body in general amen
[41:26] amen God bless you we're going to read
[41:28] from First Peter 1 and verse 18 says for
[41:30] as much as you know that ye were not
[41:32] redeemed with corruptable things as
[41:34] silver and gold from your vain
[41:36] conversation received by tradition from
[41:39] your father's catch that see normally
[41:40] Redemption comes by payment through
[41:43] silver and gold through money he says
[41:45] the redeeming you need was from your
[41:47] vain conversation your vain life that
[41:49] you received from your fathers it had
[41:51] become a tradition to them amen it was
[41:53] no longer life it was no longer
[41:54] relationship it was just tradition to
[41:56] them he says you can't be redeemed from
[41:58] that with money you can't be redeemed
[42:00] from that with things that are corrupted
[42:01] with things that are natural of this
[42:03] Earth he says but with the precious
[42:05] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[42:07] blemish and without spot amen God bless
[42:10] you you can have your seats this evening
[42:13] I was kind of expecting to be able to
[42:14] keep my jacket on this evening giving
[42:16] that somebody ordered up winter all of a
[42:18] sudden but I'm feeling pretty warm up
[42:20] here amen so God bless you this evening
[42:21] we're going to continue our series on
[42:24] Redemption and and I want to preach on a
[42:26] wonderful thing tonight I want to preach
[42:28] on a title called debt free and then
[42:30] debt free we hear a lot about debt these
[42:32] days don't we we've been through a
[42:33] pandemic where the government spent
[42:35] almost a trillion dollars and put us
[42:38] into debt almost a trillion dollars in
[42:40] the last three years almost and we look
[42:42] at that and we see our provincial
[42:43] government and they get a surplus and it
[42:46] makes the news because we had a surplus
[42:47] rather than we went into further and
[42:49] further debt you know we have a half
[42:51] billion dollar Surplus and we have what
[42:52] 10 or 12 billion dollars sitting in the
[42:54] background that we can't pay off amen we
[42:57] have unpayable debts already as a
[42:58] country and as a province and we see it
[43:00] even happening in our personal lives
[43:02] don't we we see that the the economists
[43:04] look at it and they say personal debt is
[43:06] ratcheting Higher and Higher and Higher
[43:08] and now 25 30 50 of your income is going
[43:12] to different kinds of debt and they've
[43:14] got people in some of the higher cost
[43:15] areas of the country where 80 and 90
[43:17] percent of their their money is going to
[43:19] debt a lot of that's for housing of
[43:21] course but personal debt and and people
[43:22] racking up their credit cards and these
[43:24] things and they look at it and they say
[43:25] that it's unsustainable
[43:27] you know when we look at those things
[43:28] and we know that we don't get in debt by
[43:30] making the right decisions do we you
[43:32] don't uh generally I mean obviously
[43:33] there are those that have harder times
[43:35] and I remember I was in debt early on in
[43:37] my life and you're you're young and you
[43:39] buy a house and you're not making a
[43:41] whole lot of money and maybe you go into
[43:43] debt for certain things but as you make
[43:45] a better living and as you make more
[43:46] money you pull yourself out from it amen
[43:48] and if you can live within your means
[43:50] you don't have to go into debt except
[43:51] for the most you know maybe a house on
[43:53] these different things but you see that
[43:55] debt is built up on poor decisions
[43:56] usually amen and we speak about
[43:58] Redemption tonight and we know that as
[44:00] soon as Adam as soon as Adam sinned that
[44:02] a debt was created right there and it
[44:04] was a debt that he could never pay and
[44:06] since that time since the very the very
[44:09] moment that time began that we stepped
[44:11] out of Eternity and into time there's a
[44:13] lifestyle that we were living that
[44:14] started building up a sin debt and every
[44:17] day that we lived there was a sin that
[44:19] that was being built up and more and
[44:21] more and more of these things amen our
[44:22] very existence as we preached on before
[44:24] was a reflection of the original sin
[44:26] every breath we took was a reminder of
[44:29] the sinful way that we came into this
[44:30] world and then you think about how many
[44:33] people have lived in the world this far
[44:35] and that would live until the Lord would
[44:37] come in the very end of time you would
[44:38] see that great debt of sin that was
[44:40] built up and you could see God standing
[44:42] there before time ever begins and
[44:44] knowing the end from the beginning he
[44:46] could look and he see where time began
[44:48] because time began when sin began when
[44:50] sin came into the world and he would see
[44:52] that great mountain of debt built up
[44:54] over time and we can't even comprehend
[44:56] that but I'm going to try and give us
[44:57] maybe a way to to look at that remember
[45:00] I remember way back when in one of the
[45:02] special meetings I preached here before
[45:04] we moved I spoke about how big a book
[45:06] would be if you sinned one hour once an
[45:08] hour every day of your life and when we
[45:11] look at what Sin is Sin is unbelief sin
[45:13] is not just saying the wrong thing or or
[45:15] having the wrong attitude or responding
[45:17] the wrong way but sin is even the wrong
[45:19] thought the wrong motive and the wrong
[45:20] objective so the holiest among us if we
[45:23] could say I only sin 24 times a day we
[45:25] would be in really great company we
[45:27] would be among the greatest people on
[45:29] the Earth in terms of our Holiness such
[45:31] as we would label it 24 times a day if I
[45:35] if my book of sin if my sin that book
[45:37] was 24 a day and each of those sins was
[45:41] only one word lusted cheated lied
[45:45] one word
[45:47] by the end of my life if I lived 75
[45:49] years the rough average for a North
[45:50] American these days I'd have 1600 pages
[45:53] of sin
[45:55] one word descriptions for my entire life
[45:59] that's a lot of debt
[46:01] it's a lot of sins they say we have a
[46:03] hundred and Seventeen billion people
[46:05] that have existed in the earth thus far
[46:08] so you take 117 billion people and you
[46:11] multiply them by the roughly 657
[46:14] 000 sins that they would do in their
[46:16] life or 1600 pages of that and you would
[46:19] stack those books in standard five by
[46:21] eight inch format
[46:22] you would have a a stack that is one and
[46:25] a half million kilometers tall and that
[46:28] would be all the sins of the world in
[46:30] one words in one word descriptions
[46:32] that's it no details just one word and
[46:35] that'd be enough to convict us you could
[46:37] go around the world 38 times almost with
[46:39] that stack of sins you could go to the
[46:41] Moon back and back all the way to the
[46:43] moon and back twice with a stack of
[46:46] those books and that would be the sin
[46:47] debt of the world so far
[46:51] that's the mountain that God could see
[46:53] from the very beginning when there was a
[46:55] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[46:57] world that's the debt that he was
[46:58] putting up against the Lamb of God
[47:00] that's how big it was we start looking
[47:03] at something like that you take all of
[47:05] those sins those one-word sins and say
[47:07] each of those is worth a dollar which is
[47:09] cheap for a sin when you think about it
[47:11] considering what a dollar buys you today
[47:12] we would owe eight quadrillion dollars
[47:17] in Cinder at a dollar a piece and we
[47:20] only do 24 a day each person
[47:22] it would take us 812 years if we took
[47:25] every bit of the gross domestic product
[47:28] of the entire Earth and put every cent
[47:30] against that debt it would take us 812
[47:32] years to pay it off
[47:34] that's if we didn't pay anything for
[47:36] anything
[47:36] if we didn't have any food if we didn't
[47:38] have any energy if we didn't have any
[47:39] clothes nothing if we took every cent we
[47:41] had it would take us 812 years of every
[47:44] bit of money that we produce in this
[47:46] world anything that's of value 812 years
[47:48] to pay it off which you can't do of
[47:50] course you can't do you can't put
[47:51] everything into your debt because you
[47:52] have to live and so it's an unpayable
[47:54] debt now you look at that and you say
[47:57] that's a dollar a piece but consider
[47:59] this that every single one of those
[48:00] debts was worthy of death
[48:03] so it was eight quadrillion deaths that
[48:05] would have been required looking from
[48:07] the very beginning of time that's the
[48:10] mountain of debt that that we've built
[48:12] up if the numbers are to be correct ever
[48:15] since Adam first fell in the garden
[48:18] that's the price that has to be paid for
[48:20] us
[48:21] that's the price each one of us would be
[48:23] over six hundred and fifty thousand
[48:24] dollars at a dollar a sin to pay off you
[48:27] say well I can do that I can pay off a
[48:28] house like that they're doing it all day
[48:29] long in Vancouver and Toronto try paying
[48:32] that off while you live in those places
[48:34] with interest
[48:36] because you got to pay interest God
[48:38] doesn't do free financing does he
[48:40] that's the debt that we're talking about
[48:42] on the best day if you stayed in bed
[48:46] and did nothing you'd still have that
[48:48] mountain of debt behind you screaming
[48:50] guilty guilty guilty
[48:53] Isaiah 64.
[48:55] says this it says we are all as an
[48:58] unclean thing
[48:59] and all our righteousness says
[49:02] righteousness is
[49:04] you know what stands out to me
[49:06] righteousnesses because we would say all
[49:07] our righteousness
[49:10] righteousness is things that we do that
[49:13] we think somehow certify us in front of
[49:15] God that qualifies to be in his presence
[49:17] that's what he's saying all of our
[49:19] righteousness is all the things we do
[49:21] that think of that that we allow to take
[49:23] us into God's presence it says every one
[49:26] of them are as filthy rags and we all do
[49:28] Fade as a leaf we know all about that in
[49:31] the season and our iniquities like the
[49:33] wind have taken us away you can't get
[49:36] close to God because the wind takes you
[49:37] as a leaf and it's blowing you away
[49:39] because you're an iniquity that can't be
[49:40] in the presence of God he says there is
[49:43] none that calleth upon thy name that
[49:45] stirth up himself to take hold of thee
[49:47] for thou Hast hid thy face from us and
[49:50] Hast consumed us because of our
[49:53] iniquities
[49:54] what he says none of us could approach
[49:56] God none of us could reach up
[49:57] effectively and grab hold of God and say
[50:00] Have Mercy On Us
[50:01] on the best day all we could do is
[50:03] Scream have mercy because we could never
[50:05] touch him we could never get close
[50:06] enough into his presence to lay hold of
[50:09] him and have any sort of an effect on
[50:10] him amen wretched lost incomplete
[50:14] dissatisfied
[50:16] unable to get the victory
[50:18] that's what we were looking at to pay
[50:20] amen what would you do to pay it
[50:23] what would you do if somebody would
[50:25] offer to take care of every sin in your
[50:26] life what price would you pay
[50:30] if you knew that it would restore you to
[50:32] Eternal fellowship and eternal life with
[50:34] God what would you pay
[50:37] it's a question we ought to ask
[50:38] ourselves what would you be willing to
[50:40] pay we see in the dark ages what would
[50:42] they do they do these great pilgrimages
[50:44] wouldn't they and they go to Jerusalem
[50:47] or they go to Rome or they go to some
[50:49] place that was declared as a holy site
[50:51] and some of these people would crawl for
[50:53] hundreds even thousands of miles the
[50:56] entire way it would take them years to
[50:58] get there and they would destroy their
[51:00] bodies and their joints trying to get
[51:02] there doing what doing Penance doing
[51:05] something in a humble way something that
[51:06] was difficult to show God how serious
[51:09] they were about having their sin debt
[51:10] paid or for the sake of one of their
[51:12] relatives that they knew wasn't good
[51:13] enough to get in
[51:15] to do Penance they would do these
[51:17] amazing things
[51:18] remember we read the story of Martin
[51:20] Luther and he sees these people going up
[51:22] and down the stairs
[51:24] right and they're doing Penance and
[51:26] they're going up and down those Stone
[51:27] stairs that are so cold and so hard and
[51:30] ripping up their knees and that's when
[51:32] he got the Revelation that what the just
[51:34] shall live by faith but they were trying
[51:36] to justify themselves by what doing acts
[51:38] of penance of Holiness of great
[51:40] sacrifice and hopes that they could pay
[51:42] the debt off for somebody they pay great
[51:45] sums to the Catholic Church
[51:47] just for the opportunity to get their
[51:49] family out of what Purgatory hell a
[51:52] place where they could stay for a while
[51:54] maybe get them out a little quicker from
[51:55] these places
[51:57] it's incredible the things that people
[51:58] would do
[52:00] and you see God looking at that and and
[52:02] I think sometimes we could sit back and
[52:03] say why is God so harsh to us
[52:06] why doesn't he reach out to us in that
[52:08] way why doesn't he see that we're trying
[52:10] to do something and reach out and say
[52:12] all I'll take that
[52:15] why does he seem so so standoffish at
[52:17] times looking back through history is
[52:20] what I'm talking about not today of
[52:21] course amen why could we not move the
[52:23] needle of his compassion towards us in
[52:26] Goodwill
[52:27] why couldn't we do it
[52:31] brother Brown would say this in the
[52:33] latest in church age he said these
[52:35] things saith the faithful and true
[52:37] witness now I want to show you what I
[52:39] find in the thought of faithful you know
[52:42] we often talk about a great unchanging
[52:44] God whose word does not change and when
[52:46] we speak of him after that manner we
[52:48] often get a view of him that makes him
[52:50] seem very impersonal
[52:52] it is as though God made the whole
[52:54] universe and all the laws that pertain
[52:56] to it and then stood back and became a
[52:58] great impersonal God it is as though God
[53:01] made a way of salvation for lost mankind
[53:03] that being the cross and then when the
[53:06] death of Christ has atoned for our sins
[53:07] and his resurrection gave us an open
[53:09] door to him God just folded his arms and
[53:12] stood back because you see what happened
[53:14] through here and there was no closeness
[53:16] there was this great thing in the middle
[53:17] but it just seems like God let it go to
[53:19] pot as we would say today right he just
[53:22] let the world go into shambles he let it
[53:23] go back into chaos he let it go into a
[53:26] lost condition so often just total
[53:28] darkness there was no God there was no
[53:30] Holy Ghost for most of it just
[53:32] completely died away
[53:34] he said it is as if we majored in
[53:37] believing in a great Creator who having
[53:39] created lost personal interest in his
[53:42] creation
[53:44] you say I don't think that brother John
[53:46] sometimes we do
[53:48] we get into situations we get into the
[53:50] depths of Despair we get into difficult
[53:52] times we get
[53:53] amen he knows what's good for us amen
[53:55] he's saying God is working in our lives
[53:57] and for our good even when we can't see
[53:59] it and catch this even when we don't
[54:02] deserve it
[54:03] because why he has a personal interest
[54:05] he is has a vested interest because he
[54:08] has given a word and it can return to
[54:10] him void so he has a personal interest
[54:12] in losing the Holy Spirit to produce
[54:14] that which he has called for us to
[54:16] produce in this time and in this age
[54:17] amen
[54:19] and we see that in this unpayable sin
[54:21] debt we look at it and we ask and we say
[54:23] what would it be worth to you to restore
[54:25] yourself back to the presence of God
[54:27] now if you really believed that I could
[54:29] get you back to the presence of God what
[54:31] would you pay
[54:32] I'd pay everything
[54:34] I pay everything if I knew beyond a
[54:37] shadow of doubt that whoever this person
[54:38] was standing before me could restore me
[54:41] back to my original condition my
[54:43] original position and give me eternal
[54:45] life in the presence of God I give
[54:46] anything up I give anything up because
[54:48] what he's giving me is worth way more
[54:50] than anything I have
[54:52] if you value the presence of God
[54:55] so what would you pay for it if no you
[54:58] say I pay anything but what would you
[55:00] say if somebody said I'll give it to you
[55:02] for free
[55:05] you've already said what you'll say
[55:08] you've already decided what you're going
[55:10] to say John coffee has decided what he
[55:12] will say
[55:14] amen he says I'll take it
[55:16] I'll take it and so many times what's
[55:18] happening is people say if you offer me
[55:20] that I take it and yet it's standing
[55:22] right there before you and people won't
[55:24] take it they won't take it because what
[55:26] they don't believe it
[55:28] they don't believe it
[55:29] or they're not looking for it it has no
[55:31] value to them amen
[55:33] brother bam says this way he says God is
[55:35] building a church as a memorial a
[55:37] memorial of his sacrifice Christ never
[55:40] come to Earth to die in vain his death
[55:42] will not be in vain he said God is able
[55:45] of these stones to rise up children unto
[55:47] Abraham if people won't live it if they
[55:50] won't take it under consideration and
[55:52] realize what a great gift that God has
[55:54] given them God is able of the stones to
[55:56] raise children to Abraham truly he'll do
[55:59] it and when I think of that and think of
[56:01] the great price that we had to pay
[56:03] everything everybody wants everything
[56:06] free that's the American way of life
[56:08] today get everything you can for nothing
[56:11] I'm reminded even of what happened when
[56:12] brother Mark you know the first one of
[56:14] all of us really to get saved to come to
[56:17] the Lord and it was what kind of like
[56:18] out of these Stones I'll produce a child
[56:22] I'll raise up children are these Stones
[56:24] because guess what there are
[56:25] Pentecostals all over this island that
[56:28] were a whole lot closer to the knowledge
[56:29] of what it meant to be his son and a
[56:31] daughter of God right the prophet was
[56:33] calling them out over the the previous
[56:35] 30 40 50 years they should have been
[56:38] called out
[56:39] and they weren't and they didn't and so
[56:42] what did God do God raised up a young
[56:43] man that had no clue what God really was
[56:45] and took him and pulled them into the
[56:47] fold and then from there he pulled in
[56:49] another one and another one and another
[56:50] one and then he brings in a pastor and
[56:52] all of a sudden we've got 40 or 50
[56:54] people in a church Faithfully serving
[56:56] him why because one stone was turned
[56:58] into a child of God now we believe he
[57:00] was always a child of God of course we
[57:02] believe that but out of nothing out of
[57:04] nowhere out of out of the strangest
[57:06] place out of somebody just walking down
[57:08] the street a heathen in so many ways
[57:11] that's what we would say if you're
[57:13] Catholic you're heathen
[57:14] no idea what it means to serve God and
[57:17] out of that turns them into a holy
[57:18] ghost-filled Son of God
[57:20] he can do it out of nothing and he can
[57:22] do it out of the strangest places
[57:24] he says brother you get nothing that's
[57:26] worth anything for nothing you pay for
[57:29] what you get that's right you have to
[57:31] pay for it and it comes dear he says and
[57:33] your salvation come dear to God it costs
[57:36] his only begotten son to give eternal
[57:38] life to every man and make him happy
[57:40] tonight and live for things that's
[57:42] worthwhile Living For
[57:44] you not for to leave something to our
[57:46] children
[57:49] said we died but if we die he says this
[57:51] is not what you're looking for is to
[57:53] leave something to your children he says
[57:54] this is what you want to leave to your
[57:56] children eternal life life that's worth
[57:59] living for he says no Heritage to be
[58:01] left greater than the salvation of our
[58:05] Lord Jesus Christ
[58:06] he's made a way he's made a way and it's
[58:09] through the blood of the Lamb now I'm
[58:11] going to Romans 5 and I know we've read
[58:13] this a few times but it it's worth
[58:15] repeating and Paul says for when we were
[58:17] yet without Strength In Due Time Christ
[58:20] died for the ungodly
[58:22] what's he pointing to he's pointing to
[58:24] the mountain of debt and we didn't even
[58:26] know we were wrong didn't even know we
[58:28] were wrong we weren't under the Covenant
[58:29] we had no clue who God was who the real
[58:31] God was and that we had a price to pay
[58:34] we had no clue he says first scarcely
[58:37] for a righteous man will one die yet
[58:39] Perhaps for a good man some would even
[58:41] dare to die but God commendeth his love
[58:44] toward us and that while we were yet
[58:46] sinners all of us all of us were Sinners
[58:50] all of us are sinners until we're under
[58:52] that blood he says while we were yet
[58:54] sinners Christ died for us much more
[58:57] than being now justified by his blood we
[59:00] shall be saved from wrath through him as
[59:03] I was reading this we have all these
[59:05] initiatives these days that working in
[59:07] the world and they call it EDI Equity
[59:09] diversity and inclusion amen and it's
[59:12] what it's trying to level the playing
[59:14] field they're trying to bring more women
[59:16] into work and they're trying to bring
[59:17] more people of color and more indigenous
[59:19] people and and the transgender and and
[59:22] lgbtq and all these things they're
[59:24] trying to bring more and more of them
[59:25] into work and make sure that they get
[59:27] all of the opportunities that everyone
[59:28] else apparently does
[59:30] listen this is the greatest EDI program
[59:32] that was ever given to the world because
[59:34] he says while we were all yet sinners
[59:37] that covers Every Nation every color
[59:39] every gender everything you might have
[59:42] wrong with you is included in that he
[59:44] says while you are yet sinners he died
[59:46] for you this is the greatest equalizer
[59:48] that was ever in the history of mankind
[59:50] as he said while you are yet sinners I
[59:52] die for you I paid the price and he
[59:54] didn't care who and what you were every
[59:57] sin price was paid that day
[59:59] there's no sin price that's not paid
[1:00:00] today you say what about a Sinners his
[1:00:03] price was paid and the only reason he
[1:00:04] doesn't get the benefit of it is because
[1:00:06] he doesn't receive the pardon
[1:00:08] but his prices paid
[1:00:10] but he doesn't receive the pardon and so
[1:00:12] he's got to go a different path
[1:00:15] Paul continues he says for if when we
[1:00:17] were enemies we were reconciled to God
[1:00:19] by the death of his son much more being
[1:00:21] reconciled we shall be saved by his life
[1:00:23] not only so but also we joy in God
[1:00:26] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we
[1:00:28] have now received the atonement
[1:00:31] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[1:00:33] the world and death by sin and so death
[1:00:35] passed upon all men for that all have
[1:00:38] sinned
[1:00:39] verse 15 says but not as the orphans so
[1:00:42] also is the free gift we're talking
[1:00:44] about debt free tonight he says so also
[1:00:46] is the free gift for if through the
[1:00:49] offense of one many be dead much more
[1:00:51] the grace of God and the gift by Grace
[1:00:54] which is one man Jesus Christ hath
[1:00:57] abounded unto many he says one man
[1:00:59] brought us into that one man's going to
[1:01:01] bring us out and it's a free gift and
[1:01:03] it's a gift of Grace you cannot earn it
[1:01:05] it is on merited favor
[1:01:08] he says and not as it was by one that
[1:01:10] sinned so is the gift for the Judgment
[1:01:13] was by one to condemnation but the free
[1:01:15] gift is of many offenses under
[1:01:18] justification for If by one man's
[1:01:21] offense death reigned by one much more
[1:01:23] they which received the abundance of
[1:01:26] Grace and of the gift of righteousness
[1:01:28] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[1:01:31] therefore is by the offense of one
[1:01:33] judgment Came Upon all men to
[1:01:34] condemnation even so by the
[1:01:37] righteousness of One Man the free gift
[1:01:38] came upon all men unto justification of
[1:01:42] life every man it's available it's
[1:01:45] available to every single person on the
[1:01:48] planet always has been and always will
[1:01:49] be
[1:01:51] he says for as by one man's disobedient
[1:01:53] many were made Sinners so by The
[1:01:55] Obedience of one shall many be made
[1:01:57] righteous moreover the law entered that
[1:02:01] the offense might abound
[1:02:03] Paul says the Sin didn't didn't didn't
[1:02:05] exist until the law was given
[1:02:08] you could do anything but until the law
[1:02:10] says it's wrong it's not sin but he says
[1:02:12] as soon as Allah entered then what
[1:02:14] offenses might abound now you could you
[1:02:16] could sin and you could sin a whole lot
[1:02:18] he says but where sin abounded Grace did
[1:02:22] much more abound amen he says that has
[1:02:24] sin hath reigned unto death even so my
[1:02:27] grace Reign through righteousness unto
[1:02:30] eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord it
[1:02:32] jumps out of me where he says rain
[1:02:33] because what does it mean if you Reign
[1:02:35] it means you are the king it means you
[1:02:38] are the ultimate deciding Authority on
[1:02:40] what happens in the kingdom and he says
[1:02:42] listen Grace is what's going to rain all
[1:02:44] the way until you come into that
[1:02:45] Perfection of eternal life in Christ
[1:02:47] Jesus I'm so glad I'm under a Grace
[1:02:49] Reign this morning this evening amen
[1:02:51] that he doesn't look at me that he looks
[1:02:53] at a perfect sacrifice that he doesn't
[1:02:55] look at my many faults and failures my
[1:02:57] flaws
[1:02:58] what does he look at he looks through a
[1:03:00] lens of Grace
[1:03:01] and he says what I see a perfect lamb I
[1:03:04] see a perfect sacrifice sitting over
[1:03:05] there
[1:03:06] Hebrews 9 says but Christ being come and
[1:03:08] high Priests of good things to come
[1:03:11] isn't that a wonderful thing that you
[1:03:12] have a high priest of good things to
[1:03:14] come
[1:03:15] that's the kind of high priest I want
[1:03:17] because under the love of sin and death
[1:03:19] and under the law of the blood of bulls
[1:03:21] and goats he would only do it for a year
[1:03:23] and guess what I don't know if there was
[1:03:25] ever a year where that high priest
[1:03:26] didn't come out
[1:03:27] because remember he went in first for
[1:03:29] himself and then if he came out alive
[1:03:31] then he went in for you can you imagine
[1:03:32] if he went in and died that was not a
[1:03:35] priest that went in into good things was
[1:03:37] it
[1:03:37] but this one goes into what good things
[1:03:40] to come by a greater and more perfect
[1:03:42] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[1:03:45] the same not of this building neither by
[1:03:47] the blood of goats and calves but by his
[1:03:49] own blood he entered in once into the
[1:03:51] holy Place having obtained Eternal
[1:03:54] Redemption for us jumping down to 24 it
[1:03:56] says for Christ is not entered into the
[1:03:58] holy Place made with hands which are the
[1:04:00] figures of the true he says but into
[1:04:02] heaven itself now to appear in the
[1:04:05] presence of God for us
[1:04:07] see the high priest had to go into what
[1:04:08] the holy of holies down here on Earth
[1:04:11] and he had to go into the presence of
[1:04:12] God and he had to go in first for
[1:04:13] himself and then he had to go in if God
[1:04:16] accepted that sacrifice and that blood
[1:04:18] then he came out and he got more blood
[1:04:19] and he went in for the sins of the
[1:04:20] people as well and then if he came out
[1:04:22] still alive then the sins of the people
[1:04:24] were put off for another year he says
[1:04:25] Christ didn't go into that Temple he
[1:04:27] says he went directly to Heaven he went
[1:04:29] directly into the presence of the father
[1:04:30] and he says he only won him once that's
[1:04:33] all it was required because what he was
[1:04:35] the blood he was the blood he wasn't
[1:04:37] carrying blood he was the blood the sins
[1:04:39] of the people were with him and when
[1:04:40] that was accepted it settled the sin
[1:04:42] question forever
[1:04:44] he says into heaven itself now to appear
[1:04:46] in the presence of God for us nor yet
[1:04:48] that he should offer himself often as
[1:04:50] the high priest entireth into the holy
[1:04:52] place every year with blood of others
[1:04:53] for then he must have often suffered
[1:04:56] since the foundation of the world but
[1:04:58] now once in the end of the world had he
[1:05:01] appeared to put away sin by the
[1:05:03] sacrifice of himself now I I bolded it
[1:05:06] or I I I oversized that that phrase
[1:05:09] there put away
[1:05:10] because you've got to realize that under
[1:05:11] the sin of death your sins weren't put
[1:05:13] away
[1:05:14] they were covered remember we preached a
[1:05:16] couple Services ago we said when I see
[1:05:18] the blood I will do what pass over you
[1:05:21] he didn't say the sins were gone he says
[1:05:23] I'll look past them they're covered he
[1:05:25] can see it's like if I covered this
[1:05:27] Pulpit with a tarp
[1:05:29] and that tarp was the blood and the
[1:05:30] pulpit was your sins he could see there
[1:05:32] were sins but he couldn't he couldn't
[1:05:34] tell the details of them because they
[1:05:35] were under the blood they were covered
[1:05:37] but they still existed so he knew there
[1:05:39] was a problem he knew there were issues
[1:05:42] but the blood covered it and it took
[1:05:43] what it knew that it settled his wrath
[1:05:46] so that he could move on
[1:05:48] and he could show you Grace and he could
[1:05:49] show you mercy and these different
[1:05:50] things amen
[1:05:52] the details were hidden from him but we
[1:05:54] see when Christ comes and even early on
[1:05:56] as just as he's coming to John and John
[1:05:58] Cena and says the next day John see it
[1:06:01] Jesus coming to him and say Behold the
[1:06:03] Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[1:06:06] the world and when you look at those
[1:06:08] words taketh away it means to disannull
[1:06:10] to abolish
[1:06:12] in another place brother Branham says
[1:06:14] that he he divorced Sin from us there
[1:06:17] was a complete and total separation of
[1:06:19] The Sinner from his sin because before
[1:06:22] it just covered it but now he says
[1:06:24] there's a separation of who you are and
[1:06:26] what you did
[1:06:27] and if you can separate that then you
[1:06:30] can stand with who you are and not be
[1:06:32] judged because your sin is over here and
[1:06:34] it's being judged aside from you and God
[1:06:35] doesn't impute it to you God doesn't see
[1:06:37] it connected to you and so in that
[1:06:39] separation there's a righteousness that
[1:06:40] comes but there needs to be a Separation
[1:06:43] by A Perfect sacrifice and Paul and John
[1:06:45] both said that when he came he didn't
[1:06:47] just atone for sin like the blood of
[1:06:49] bulls and goats and lambs and doves but
[1:06:51] he separated it this atonement was the
[1:06:53] perfect atonement in that he separated
[1:06:54] you from your faults and failures from
[1:06:56] all the things that you had ever done
[1:06:58] amen
[1:06:59] brother Brian would say this this is
[1:07:00] 1965 exactly a month before the day he
[1:07:03] died
[1:07:04] he's talking about this this this
[1:07:06] annulment of your sin he says you are
[1:07:10] standing completely Justified as though
[1:07:13] you never did it at the beginning
[1:07:16] he says this is my message to the church
[1:07:19] now
[1:07:21] he knows he's going off the scene the
[1:07:23] seals have been opened he's done
[1:07:24] everything that his ministry was
[1:07:26] supposed to do and he says you've got to
[1:07:27] realize Church you're free
[1:07:30] everything that you've ever done
[1:07:32] everything you will do he says you never
[1:07:34] did it in the first place that's his
[1:07:36] message to the church just before he
[1:07:37] goes off the scene he says you are
[1:07:39] standing if you're standing on God's
[1:07:41] word and with God's word every amen
[1:07:43] every jot every Tittle where are you
[1:07:46] standing I'm trying to tell you pull
[1:07:48] away from them Shucks and get out here
[1:07:50] in the weep where you can get right
[1:07:52] before the sun he says I hear the coming
[1:07:54] of the combine he says there's a
[1:07:56] preparation being made and the time is
[1:07:58] now to ripen you've got to pull away
[1:08:00] from everything that's ever been before
[1:08:02] you you've got to separate yourself from
[1:08:04] everything
[1:08:05] he says I hear the coming of the combine
[1:08:08] what's the combine it's the big machine
[1:08:10] that harvests
[1:08:11] anyone that's been in Saskatchewan in
[1:08:13] particular would know all about those in
[1:08:15] Alberta massive machines just going and
[1:08:17] they're just rotating and grabbing up
[1:08:19] all the wheat and the canola and these
[1:08:20] things
[1:08:21] he says you're standing complete
[1:08:23] Justified like you never did it in the
[1:08:26] first place Hallelujah talk about it
[1:08:29] Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more
[1:08:31] thankful for that than anything I know
[1:08:33] of you are the pure virtuous sinless
[1:08:37] Bride of the son of the Living God and
[1:08:40] every man and woman that's born of the
[1:08:43] spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[1:08:45] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:08:48] God stands as though you never sinned in
[1:08:50] the first place you are perfect he says
[1:08:54] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:58] you're standing there perfect you're
[1:08:59] standing there Justified he says you
[1:09:01] never did it in the first place
[1:09:04] what's he trying to get the people away
[1:09:05] from doing stop trying to pay for it
[1:09:08] stop trying to atone for it stop trying
[1:09:11] to be worthy of it stop beating yourself
[1:09:13] up you're under grace he's not looking
[1:09:17] at you you don't have to be beat up you
[1:09:20] don't have to be pushed down you don't
[1:09:22] have to be stuck in a rut you never did
[1:09:25] it in the first place
[1:09:27] sometimes we're trying to do what
[1:09:29] qualify ourselves for the good things of
[1:09:31] God we already read how many times they
[1:09:34] say it is a free gift it is a free gift
[1:09:39] it is a gift of Grace
[1:09:41] is a gift of his atonement his blood his
[1:09:45] qualifications it's free it's free it's
[1:09:49] free you're free
[1:09:51] so he says why are you stuck here
[1:09:53] time's moving he's coming for us get
[1:09:57] ready to go and stop trying to justify
[1:10:00] yourself in his eyes step back into his
[1:10:03] grace and let him work through your life
[1:10:05] the way that he's been wanting to do for
[1:10:07] 2000 years since the first church get
[1:10:10] out of your own head get out of your own
[1:10:12] thinking get out of trying to deserve
[1:10:14] the blessings of God you don't deserve
[1:10:17] it you'll never deserve it I don't
[1:10:19] deserve it I don't deserve to be here
[1:10:20] this evening
[1:10:22] but he said I should be here he called
[1:10:24] me here by a free gift and he paid my
[1:10:27] debt and he paid the price and so I can
[1:10:30] stand here free this evening because he
[1:10:31] says you are free scripture says he who
[1:10:35] the son sets free is free indeed
[1:10:38] you don't have to pretend when you're
[1:10:39] free you know when you're free you don't
[1:10:42] have to pretend to know the the joy of
[1:10:45] God in your life you don't have to
[1:10:47] pretend to know the peace you don't have
[1:10:49] to put on a front because you got it you
[1:10:52] got it you don't have to pretend these
[1:10:54] things
[1:10:55] the worst thing is when we put up a
[1:10:57] facade that we have something that we
[1:10:59] don't as a Believer instead of crying
[1:11:01] out and say I want the free gift
[1:11:04] that's all he's waiting for you to do
[1:11:05] ask
[1:11:07] says you have not because you ask not
[1:11:10] I think sometimes we have not because
[1:11:12] we're trying to get it ourselves rather
[1:11:14] than saying it's a free gift Lord
[1:11:16] and that goes for deliverance that goes
[1:11:18] for healing
[1:11:20] that goes for the spirit of Praise in
[1:11:22] your life that goes for joy goes for
[1:11:24] love goes for rest
[1:11:27] you can't work yourself into rest
[1:11:28] whoever got Rest by work
[1:11:32] you can't do it it's a free gift
[1:11:35] that's what he paid the price for
[1:11:39] there's these misconceptions about
[1:11:41] punishment and pain these days I feel
[1:11:44] I want to share something with you
[1:11:45] because people think that if they're
[1:11:47] going through pain then God is punishing
[1:11:48] them
[1:11:50] absolutely
[1:11:51] absolutely and not just in the
[1:11:53] denominations right here in the message
[1:11:54] people think that if I'm in pain God is
[1:11:57] punishing me
[1:11:58] listen every bit of punishment that you
[1:12:01] deserve Christ took
[1:12:03] so any pain you're going through today
[1:12:05] is not punishment
[1:12:07] it's not punishment I'll prove it to you
[1:12:09] now everybody goes back to Galatians 6 7
[1:12:11] and says be not deceived God is Not
[1:12:13] mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that
[1:12:15] shall he also reap and they look and
[1:12:17] they say well look I'm reaping what I
[1:12:19] sowed I did wrong and now God is
[1:12:22] punishing me
[1:12:24] I'm hurting because I did wrong no no no
[1:12:26] because guess what this scripture is a
[1:12:29] blessing
[1:12:30] and it's a curse
[1:12:32] because if you saw the right thing
[1:12:34] you'll rape the right thing and if you
[1:12:36] saw the wrong thing you'll get the wrong
[1:12:38] thing my favorite saying I think in in
[1:12:40] these situations is do stupid things win
[1:12:43] stupid prizes right so this is not a law
[1:12:47] of punishment and blessing this is a law
[1:12:49] of what Harvest what you put in is what
[1:12:53] you get out God doesn't have to do
[1:12:55] anything to you
[1:12:56] you put it in you're going to get it out
[1:12:58] and as a believer that does not exclude
[1:13:00] you you are not excluded from this you
[1:13:02] do the wrong thing you'll get the wrong
[1:13:03] thing out every single time
[1:13:06] but listen what's going to happen is
[1:13:08] that God to his children acts in a
[1:13:11] different way than he does to those that
[1:13:12] are not his children
[1:13:14] remember what if you're going through
[1:13:16] pain as a Believer it is always with
[1:13:18] purpose and there's two reasons for it
[1:13:20] and the first one is that you're going
[1:13:22] through purification
[1:13:23] because God sees something in your life
[1:13:25] that needs to come out so what does he
[1:13:27] do he puts you in uncomfortable
[1:13:29] positions to bring that issue to the
[1:13:32] Forefront
[1:13:34] that flaw that characteristic that
[1:13:36] attribute that attitude whatever it
[1:13:38] might be and he puts you under pressure
[1:13:40] so that that comes out and it causes
[1:13:43] what pain it causes stress it causes
[1:13:46] discomfort it causes a shame sometimes
[1:13:49] because we react and we do things that
[1:13:51] we ought not to do and what's he doing
[1:13:53] is he's putting you in uncomfortable
[1:13:55] positions to do what
[1:13:57] pull it out of you
[1:13:58] because remember he says in Revelation 3
[1:14:00] when he's talking to the Legacy and
[1:14:02] church age he says I counsel thee to buy
[1:14:04] me gold tried in the fire he says I
[1:14:06] counsel thee he says he doesn't say I'm
[1:14:09] going to force you he says I counsel you
[1:14:11] to submit to it because gold is what
[1:14:13] Godly character
[1:14:15] and what you can only purify gold in a
[1:14:18] fire you can beat on it and you can sort
[1:14:20] it out and you can put it in the in the
[1:14:22] pan you know and get all the dirt away
[1:14:24] but there comes a place there where you
[1:14:25] get that fire has to go into the fire
[1:14:27] and get all of the impurity Zone
[1:14:29] and so that pain is purification he's
[1:14:31] not punishing you he's bringing you to a
[1:14:33] state of perfection
[1:14:35] but so often we say because it hurts I
[1:14:37] did wrong no no no
[1:14:39] if you didn't hurt I would be worried
[1:14:40] about your Christian condition because
[1:14:42] he's always working on us amen
[1:14:44] but on the other side is what
[1:14:47] chastisement
[1:14:49] because remember he says in Hebrews 12
[1:14:51] we'll get to it a minute chastisement we
[1:14:53] think that what again I did something
[1:14:56] bad and so he's giving me a spanking
[1:14:58] because what do we do with our kids
[1:15:00] if they do something wrong we give them
[1:15:02] a spanking we say that's what God is
[1:15:04] doing
[1:15:05] no no that's not the way chastisement
[1:15:07] Works do you know the root word for
[1:15:08] chastisement teaching
[1:15:11] and we get it so wrong as parents is
[1:15:13] that they do something wrong and we
[1:15:14] spank them first and teach second no no
[1:15:16] God always gives us the word first
[1:15:19] and what does he do he says here's the
[1:15:20] right thing to do
[1:15:21] and he does it over the pulpit he does
[1:15:23] it through our parents he does it
[1:15:24] through the people in our church it
[1:15:26] messages whatever it might be and he
[1:15:28] gives you that teaching and then he says
[1:15:29] will you live by it and then if you
[1:15:32] don't do it then what does he do he
[1:15:34] chastises you he gives you a spanking
[1:15:37] it's not punishment what's he trying to
[1:15:39] do he's trying to let you know you don't
[1:15:40] want to do this
[1:15:42] I don't spank my kid I shouldn't spank
[1:15:44] my kid kids
[1:15:46] because I'm angry
[1:15:48] I should spank it to keep them from
[1:15:50] doing it again for their sake
[1:15:52] because if they do it it's going to
[1:15:54] cause a lot more pain it's going to
[1:15:55] cause a lot more discomfort it's going
[1:15:57] to be a lot worse than if they continue
[1:15:58] it doing in it now remember this is
[1:16:01] Hebrews 12.
[1:16:03] you got to realize chastisement is not
[1:16:05] paying just for the sake of punishment
[1:16:06] it's pain that is given for a purpose
[1:16:08] Hebrews 12 says and have ye forgotten
[1:16:11] the exhortation with speaketh unto you
[1:16:13] as unto children my son despise not thou
[1:16:15] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[1:16:17] when thou art rebuked of him
[1:16:19] for whom the Lord loveth
[1:16:21] whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[1:16:24] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
[1:16:26] we'd say spanking these days we don't we
[1:16:28] don't whip
[1:16:29] most of us
[1:16:32] he says he spanks every son that he
[1:16:34] receives the ones that he's working with
[1:16:36] the ones that he is has welcomed into
[1:16:39] his home the ones that he has what
[1:16:41] vested interest in
[1:16:43] because he has that vested interest in
[1:16:45] every person in the world
[1:16:46] but the sons that he has received the
[1:16:48] ones that he's bringing to him those are
[1:16:49] the ones that he spanks he says if you
[1:16:51] and they're chastening God dealer with
[1:16:53] you as with sons for what son is he whom
[1:16:55] the father chasteneth not that ought to
[1:16:57] tell us whether or not we ought to spank
[1:16:58] our kids
[1:17:01] but if he be without chastisement where
[1:17:03] of all our partakers then are ye
[1:17:05] bastards and not Sons so Paul's saying
[1:17:07] God
[1:17:08] if you're a child of God he doesn't let
[1:17:09] you get away with anything anything I'm
[1:17:12] a testimony to that he doesn't let you
[1:17:14] get away with anything
[1:17:16] nothing
[1:17:17] why because if he sees you going down
[1:17:20] the wrong road the first thing he's
[1:17:21] going to do is try and holler at you and
[1:17:22] say don't go down that road
[1:17:25] so what does he do he takes it and it's
[1:17:28] love that drives it it's not frustration
[1:17:30] it's not disappointment it's not shame
[1:17:32] that is not the way God operates he is a
[1:17:34] god of love so everything is operated
[1:17:36] under love and so what is he doing is he
[1:17:38] sees you going a certain direction and
[1:17:40] what does he do listen if an unbeliever
[1:17:42] goes down that road God just lets him go
[1:17:44] and in the end they get a lot of pain
[1:17:46] don't they but it's what reaping what
[1:17:48] they sowed but you start down that road
[1:17:51] as a son or a daughter of God and what
[1:17:52] does he do he ratchets the pain up to
[1:17:54] 11. on a scale of one to ten he ratchets
[1:17:56] it up to 11. why because he loves you
[1:17:58] like brother Brahm said if you've got a
[1:18:00] kid that's out in the middle of the road
[1:18:02] you don't come out and say now little
[1:18:03] Johnny you shouldn't play in that road
[1:18:05] he says you go out there and you grab
[1:18:07] him up and You Yank him off that road
[1:18:09] why because the pain of being hit by the
[1:18:11] truck that's coming is way worse than
[1:18:13] what you just did to him if it wrenches
[1:18:15] his neck you know if it strains his
[1:18:17] shoulder socket doesn't matter because
[1:18:19] what you're doing is way better than
[1:18:20] what's going to happen if he goes down
[1:18:21] there so that's what God does to us
[1:18:23] believe her so many times is we go down
[1:18:25] the road and what does he do he just
[1:18:26] cranks up the paint
[1:18:28] all he's doing is he's saying you do not
[1:18:29] want to go down this path because what's
[1:18:31] down there is way worse than what I'm
[1:18:32] doing to you right now and I love you
[1:18:34] too much to let you get those scars
[1:18:36] hold up there reverse your decision come
[1:18:39] back do the right thing don't do the
[1:18:41] wrong thing go the way that I've taught
[1:18:42] you to go and you'll be okay and all of
[1:18:45] a sudden the pain goes away and guess
[1:18:46] what as long as we learn then the pain
[1:18:48] is done you never have to go back again
[1:18:51] amen
[1:18:52] and then the unbeliever right next to
[1:18:54] you they go down the same road and they
[1:18:55] reap a whirlwind because they don't have
[1:18:56] a Godly father they don't have a loving
[1:18:58] father that's looking over them so pain
[1:19:00] is not punishment
[1:19:02] pain is love trying to get you back to
[1:19:04] the way that he wants you to be amen and
[1:19:06] that chastisement is a reflection of
[1:19:07] your position it's a reflection of your
[1:19:09] heritage
[1:19:11] and if you don't have it Paul says
[1:19:12] you're not even a child of God
[1:19:14] because those who he loves he always
[1:19:15] corrects
[1:19:17] I mean I'm speaking of pain a lot just
[1:19:19] in this moment because pain is the price
[1:19:21] that was paid
[1:19:22] Christ went through an awful lot of pain
[1:19:24] so that we don't have to take punishment
[1:19:26] pain
[1:19:27] so we don't have to take the beating and
[1:19:29] the whipping and all of these things
[1:19:31] that he went through amen
[1:19:33] we spoke last service I think it was
[1:19:34] about how his ministry alone was painful
[1:19:37] and every day he was tired and when he
[1:19:40] laid his head down at night he could
[1:19:42] barely sleep just sore and in agony and
[1:19:44] people pulling and pushing at him and
[1:19:46] doing all these things and we saw it
[1:19:47] aged him prematurely he was half again
[1:19:49] as old in appearance than he was in real
[1:19:51] life
[1:19:52] and that was a great price that he paid
[1:19:53] but in the last 24 hours before he died
[1:19:56] he went through a level of pain he went
[1:19:58] through a level of punishment he went
[1:19:59] through a level of suffering that we
[1:20:01] cannot even imagine we can't even
[1:20:03] imagine what it was like just his life
[1:20:05] would have been difficult
[1:20:06] and why did he do it listen I'd have
[1:20:09] been happy if he just took my sins away
[1:20:11] because if he just went to the cross and
[1:20:13] died my sins would have been covered but
[1:20:15] he did a lot more than go to that cross
[1:20:16] and die before he died
[1:20:18] didn't he he did a lot of really
[1:20:20] uncomfortable things
[1:20:22] I want to talk about that for a little
[1:20:23] bit we read this last service he said in
[1:20:26] Isaiah 53 he is despised and rejected of
[1:20:29] men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with
[1:20:32] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[1:20:34] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[1:20:37] him not surely have borne our griefs
[1:20:40] carried our sorrows yet we did a scene
[1:20:43] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[1:20:45] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:20:48] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:20:50] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:20:53] was upon him and with his stripes we
[1:20:55] were healed that's an awful lot of pain
[1:20:58] and suffering crammed into one verse
[1:21:00] wounded
[1:21:01] bruised chastisement and striped whipped
[1:21:07] just in one thing it covers the greatest
[1:21:09] pain that a man in this world has ever
[1:21:10] gone through
[1:21:12] brother Brown said this he says the
[1:21:13] Bible said this man was marred above all
[1:21:15] men
[1:21:16] he was marred so much till he didn't
[1:21:19] even look like a son of man he was
[1:21:21] beaten he was bruised he was Bloody he
[1:21:25] was striped everything that could be
[1:21:27] done he looked like just a big pile of
[1:21:30] Blood and Bones walking together he
[1:21:33] didn't even look like a human being as
[1:21:35] he drug that up Calvary he said God
[1:21:37] smote him for us that's what makes him
[1:21:40] the perfect Masterpiece oh how I love
[1:21:42] him know that he did that for me know
[1:21:44] that he did that for you how could we
[1:21:46] match it no one could match it no one's
[1:21:48] worthy to match it we were here without
[1:21:50] hope we were without god without any way
[1:21:53] of redemption every one of us born
[1:21:55] sexual and we just had to pay the price
[1:21:57] but he came the perfect one and was so
[1:22:00] perfect and so pleasing till God smote
[1:22:04] him for you and I
[1:22:06] so perfect that God had to strike him
[1:22:09] because what he was exactly what God
[1:22:12] required
[1:22:14] LeBron says then I hear that howling mob
[1:22:16] in our scene
[1:22:17] look at him there they're crying for his
[1:22:19] blood his own children screaming out
[1:22:21] away with him their creator their God
[1:22:24] their maker their father away with him
[1:22:26] now he's become their redeemer
[1:22:29] he's speaking as Christ now he says now
[1:22:31] they reject me they don't know who I am
[1:22:33] they don't know I'm the very one that
[1:22:36] pronounces curse upon them Yonder in the
[1:22:38] Garden of Eden I've come down to redeem
[1:22:40] them if I refuse why I could speak in
[1:22:42] Legions of angels would come to me but
[1:22:45] if I would they're going to be lost and
[1:22:46] after all I was the one that put the
[1:22:48] curse on them now I'm going to come to
[1:22:51] take the curse off of them and let them
[1:22:53] through their sins crucify me
[1:22:55] he says there he goes dragging through
[1:22:57] the street beat they backed him hooked
[1:23:00] him up to a pulse like this and put a
[1:23:02] cat of nine tails stood out there and
[1:23:04] beefed till his ribs showed through he
[1:23:07] was a little man
[1:23:08] the Bible said no beauty that we should
[1:23:10] desire him look at his body beaten Riven
[1:23:14] bruised mockery spit from his own
[1:23:16] children spitting in their daddy's face
[1:23:18] a crown of thorns on his head tears and
[1:23:21] things mingle running down his body
[1:23:23] tears and blood running together and
[1:23:25] spit dropping off
[1:23:27] here he comes we'll look out the window
[1:23:29] and see what he looks like there he goes
[1:23:31] I hear his old cross dragging through
[1:23:33] the streets making a roaring bumpy noise
[1:23:36] as it goes down his poor little body's
[1:23:39] moving and they're walking along
[1:23:40] whipping him with a whip and the Very
[1:23:43] Creator moving there in flesh that's
[1:23:46] that blood cell moving up he says just
[1:23:48] bathing down his back he moves a little
[1:23:51] further let's look
[1:23:53] I notice over his back he's got a robe
[1:23:57] throat across his shoulders and it's
[1:23:58] wove through without seam and look all
[1:24:01] over that little robe now a little white
[1:24:02] robe there comes a little red spot it's
[1:24:06] that blood coming through his back
[1:24:07] whereby his stripes were healed oh could
[1:24:10] I deny that he says God keep me mentally
[1:24:13] right I don't care if it costs my blood
[1:24:15] what would my old dirty adulterated
[1:24:18] blood be at the side of his
[1:24:20] there I see him moving watch as he goes
[1:24:23] up those spots get bigger bigger and
[1:24:27] bigger as he moves on I see him fall a
[1:24:30] colored man come along and help him bear
[1:24:31] the cross put it up on his shoulder he
[1:24:34] moves on he can hardly move now look at
[1:24:37] him as he goes
[1:24:39] as he's moving on all them little spots
[1:24:42] run into one big spot
[1:24:46] his back has bled so much that instead
[1:24:48] of just spots here and there it's just
[1:24:50] one big red mess
[1:24:53] after a while I hear something now going
[1:24:55] what is it he says it's that old bloody
[1:24:58] garment beating against his legs
[1:25:01] what is it
[1:25:03] animal blood he says finished
[1:25:06] that's the second Adam there's the Son
[1:25:09] of God that's the god of Heaven that's
[1:25:12] not animal blood
[1:25:14] that's God's blood beating against the
[1:25:17] legs of the second Adam going to die for
[1:25:20] the human race
[1:25:21] God made Adam himself and living on
[1:25:24] Earth going down to die for the human
[1:25:27] race
[1:25:28] the blood of goals bulls and goats could
[1:25:30] not take away sin
[1:25:32] but in due season Jesus Christ came and
[1:25:35] makes the worshiper perfected by the
[1:25:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost who Jesus
[1:25:40] Christ died in his place at Calvary
[1:25:43] we talked about that last time remember
[1:25:45] as Adam and Eve were leaving the Garden
[1:25:47] of Eden and they had the Garment of that
[1:25:49] animal skin that was we believed to be a
[1:25:51] lamb as they walked out he says it was
[1:25:54] just what slapping against their leg in
[1:25:56] the blood running down he says the
[1:25:57] second Adam comes and it's not the blood
[1:25:59] of Alan it's the blood of the lamb and
[1:26:02] he's got another garment
[1:26:04] and it's covering him soaked in his own
[1:26:07] blood running down his own legs is what
[1:26:09] there is a fountain filled with blood
[1:26:17] all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:26:19] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:26:22] and the Lord had laid on him the
[1:26:23] iniquity of us all
[1:26:24] he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he
[1:26:27] opened not his mouth he's brought as a
[1:26:28] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[1:26:30] before her shears is done so he openeth
[1:26:33] not his mouth
[1:26:34] he was taken from prison and from
[1:26:36] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:26:38] generation for he was cut off out of the
[1:26:40] land of the living and for the
[1:26:42] transgression of my people was he
[1:26:44] stricken and he made his grave with the
[1:26:47] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:26:48] because he had done no violence neither
[1:26:50] was there any deceit in his mouth yet it
[1:26:53] pleased the Lord to bruise him he had
[1:26:56] put him to grief when thou shall make
[1:26:59] his soul and offer him for sin he shall
[1:27:01] see his seed he shall prolong his days
[1:27:04] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:27:06] prosper in his hand
[1:27:08] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[1:27:11] shall be satisfied we spoke of that last
[1:27:14] service and sister Maureen said I said
[1:27:16] who wants to travail and she said I will
[1:27:18] you know what it means to travail
[1:27:21] it means to strive to work to bring
[1:27:24] forth life
[1:27:26] he says the travail of his soul is what
[1:27:29] to bring forth life
[1:27:31] because it was what women travailing in
[1:27:34] birth
[1:27:34] and it was Christ travailing what that a
[1:27:37] birth could happen after he was gone and
[1:27:39] that new life would come forth and a
[1:27:41] bride would come out of it he says and
[1:27:43] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:27:45] servant justify many for he shall bear
[1:27:47] their iniquities
[1:27:49] therefore will I devoid divide him a
[1:27:51] portion with the great and he shall
[1:27:53] divide the spoil with the strong because
[1:27:55] he had poured out his soul unto death
[1:27:57] and he was numbered with the
[1:27:59] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[1:28:01] many and made intercession for the
[1:28:04] transgressors
[1:28:05] after all that pain all that Agony all
[1:28:07] that suffering now he had to go die
[1:28:10] brother man puts it this way he says
[1:28:11] Mary his beloved mother though she stood
[1:28:14] and seen him stripped down naked before
[1:28:16] the people beat into a pulp bones in his
[1:28:20] hands parted by the cruel Roman nails
[1:28:22] and all these things in disgrace and
[1:28:25] heard him screaming for Mercy as he died
[1:28:27] thinking surely that no man of that
[1:28:30] caliber could ever die such a death
[1:28:33] but God works all things together for
[1:28:35] the good
[1:28:37] he had to bring him that as I said this
[1:28:39] morning how would you have confidence in
[1:28:41] your loved ones ever raising from the
[1:28:42] dead if we only had Enoch who was
[1:28:45] translated Elijah who went home to
[1:28:47] heaven in a chariot if we only had them
[1:28:49] we would be miserable
[1:28:51] how do you know that because we already
[1:28:52] were
[1:28:54] didn't matter that Elijah and Enoch had
[1:28:56] gone on we were still miserable
[1:28:58] he says but this man died he died until
[1:29:01] the son knew he was dead he died until
[1:29:03] the moon and stars knew he was dead he
[1:29:06] died till everything in Earth and Heaven
[1:29:08] knew he was dead that he might die the
[1:29:11] death of every Mortal that ever lived
[1:29:15] because he died is because we live he
[1:29:19] says he died
[1:29:20] he died every death that we were
[1:29:23] supposed to die
[1:29:25] I estimated eight quadrillion if we live
[1:29:27] pretty good lives
[1:29:29] he died eight quadrillion deaths on that
[1:29:31] cross
[1:29:32] all in a moment
[1:29:34] can you imagine what that felt like
[1:29:36] he says there he's screaming for mercy
[1:29:39] screaming for Mercy my God my God why
[1:29:42] hast Thou forsaken me
[1:29:45] he's in a moment
[1:29:47] he went from Pure holy perfect and
[1:29:51] sinless to the smut and filth of this
[1:29:54] Earth in its totality in its sum over
[1:29:57] entirety of time he went from perfect to
[1:30:01] the most lost dirty smutty disgusting
[1:30:05] thing that this world has ever seen in a
[1:30:07] moment
[1:30:09] he went from Perfection to Absolute and
[1:30:12] total judgment
[1:30:14] and he screamed for Mercy under that
[1:30:17] separated from the presence of God he
[1:30:19] didn't die there as a god
[1:30:23] and die there's a God can't be
[1:30:25] associated with filth he died as a man
[1:30:28] God is the blood of God but he died as a
[1:30:31] man he didn't have the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:30:33] him when he died
[1:30:35] because what he says I commend my spirit
[1:30:36] and thy hands he gives away
[1:30:38] so we could get it he died as a man
[1:30:42] with every bit of pain and suffering he
[1:30:44] took you think how bad it is to be
[1:30:46] separated from God for a moment you do
[1:30:48] something wrong and you know you do
[1:30:49] wrong and you sit there and you just say
[1:30:51] I don't even want to go to prayer
[1:30:54] every moment that you've ever had like
[1:30:56] that for every person that's ever
[1:30:58] existed and will exist was compounded
[1:31:00] into One Moment One brief day for Christ
[1:31:02] and he stayed there and under that
[1:31:04] burden he lived an entire day it would
[1:31:06] have killed any of us
[1:31:08] and then when the last word was
[1:31:10] fulfilled what did he do he died and he
[1:31:13] died of a broken heart
[1:31:15] he died of a broken heart and it's not
[1:31:17] just because of us I believe he died of
[1:31:19] a broken heart because he had lost that
[1:31:21] relationship that had been his guide his
[1:31:24] his strength his joy for his entire life
[1:31:27] he was completely separated from the
[1:31:29] very thing that was life to him he
[1:31:30] couldn't live without it
[1:31:32] so he died of a broken heart
[1:31:35] brother Brown says now that rock was
[1:31:36] Christ and it was God's judgment the day
[1:31:39] you eat thereof the day you die he smoke
[1:31:41] Christ at Calvary and paid that bitter
[1:31:43] agonizing death no man never could
[1:31:46] describe what it was and never will
[1:31:49] there God placed all the Divine judgment
[1:31:52] upon him and smote him in the side when
[1:31:55] out of his side come water and blood and
[1:31:57] spirit for our Redemption he says now
[1:31:59] people paint his pictures sometimes with
[1:32:01] a robe around him or something another
[1:32:03] on the cross that is not so
[1:32:06] they dispose that man of every fowl and
[1:32:09] vulgar thing that they could
[1:32:11] but he had to be there he was the
[1:32:14] highest and Loyalist of all the world
[1:32:15] that ever was or will be and then
[1:32:18] exposed naked on the cross wounded
[1:32:21] smitten bleeding gobs of mockery spit
[1:32:25] hanging from his face a mocking crown of
[1:32:27] thorns out of his head he says but there
[1:32:31] but there he conquered death hell sin
[1:32:35] sickness and the grave and paid the
[1:32:37] price for it for it all you look at his
[1:32:40] ministry and you say no no he did that
[1:32:41] before because he healed the sick and he
[1:32:43] raised the dead and he delivered this
[1:32:45] one and and many miracles and wonders no
[1:32:48] no those were battles and what was he
[1:32:50] doing he was proving who he was
[1:32:52] but that was not the victory we needed
[1:32:54] that was not the payment of the debt
[1:32:56] that was just showing what happens when
[1:32:58] God comes into a person
[1:33:00] that's all he was doing he was proving
[1:33:01] his what he was but when he died at
[1:33:03] Calvary brother Brown says that's where
[1:33:05] he paid the price
[1:33:07] if he lived his entire life and never
[1:33:09] died the price would never have been
[1:33:10] paid he says that's where the victory
[1:33:13] was won that's where true Freedom was
[1:33:14] bought he says but on that day at
[1:33:16] Calvary there wasn't a lamb of this
[1:33:17] Earth but it was the Lamb of God that
[1:33:19] was dying wallowing in his own blood he
[1:33:22] was hacked and chopped and beat and spit
[1:33:26] on and slammed and smacked and
[1:33:28] everything by the world and the blood
[1:33:29] was dropped dripping off his locks when
[1:33:32] Abel's lamb died it died speaking in a
[1:33:34] language that Abel could not understand
[1:33:35] it was bleeding but when bleeding but
[1:33:38] when God's lamb died that day at Calvary
[1:33:40] he spoke in a language that no one
[1:33:42] understood of my God my God why hast
[1:33:44] Thou forsaken me it was God's lamb
[1:33:47] hacked to pieces and chopped up he was
[1:33:49] the very lamb that Abel had in mind when
[1:33:51] he seen the promise seed of the woman he
[1:33:53] was the lamb that Daniel saw that was
[1:33:55] hewed out of a mountain without hands he
[1:33:57] was the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:33:59] for the prophet they all had foresaw all
[1:34:02] they had foresaw was met on that day
[1:34:04] that day at Calvary that brought the
[1:34:06] great thing in that broke the back of
[1:34:09] Satan
[1:34:10] listen Satan always had an answer to
[1:34:12] this point Satan could stand in the
[1:34:15] presence of God and he could always
[1:34:16] point at that mountain of sin death
[1:34:18] behind he could always Point down there
[1:34:20] and say you know it's there
[1:34:22] you know it's there you see it you know
[1:34:25] what they're doing he could point to our
[1:34:26] failures he could point to our faults he
[1:34:28] could point to our flaws he could point
[1:34:30] to our genetics he could point to our
[1:34:32] family traditions he could point to our
[1:34:34] religious spirits and say you know they
[1:34:36] don't deserve anything they ought to be
[1:34:38] dead right now and for decades and
[1:34:41] centuries and Millennia God had to
[1:34:44] listen to it
[1:34:46] because Satan had something to talk
[1:34:48] about
[1:34:49] he had something to point to
[1:34:52] he could look at our lives and see look
[1:34:53] at what he's doing right now
[1:34:56] look at what she's doing you know that
[1:34:58] they're not allowed to do that and God
[1:35:00] had to sit there and take it it was
[1:35:01] under the blood but he knew there was
[1:35:03] something there
[1:35:05] but on this day I can just see Satan up
[1:35:07] there
[1:35:08] and he's making the acute accusations
[1:35:10] against the brother
[1:35:12] against the sisters
[1:35:13] as he does
[1:35:15] and I can see him and he's in
[1:35:16] mid-sentence and saying did you see with
[1:35:18] Jonathan curly and God says well hold on
[1:35:22] a second
[1:35:23] he says no
[1:35:26] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:35:29] I can't see anything
[1:35:33] it was just right there you saw he says
[1:35:35] I can't see anything Satan
[1:35:38] he didn't do it
[1:35:39] and Satan's going to his phone and he's
[1:35:41] saying let me show you
[1:35:43] and he's got his iPhone pulled up and he
[1:35:45] goes there play and he's got a blank
[1:35:47] screen
[1:35:49] Sonny's talking to the demon next to him
[1:35:50] you got that right you got that give me
[1:35:52] and he plays his phone and there's
[1:35:53] nothing on it he's like well surely we
[1:35:55] have audio of what he just said
[1:35:57] and guess what the tape recorder doesn't
[1:35:59] work
[1:36:01] what's happened
[1:36:02] in that moment
[1:36:04] the mountain of sin that disappeared
[1:36:07] Satan's sitting there saying what do I
[1:36:08] do now
[1:36:09] he can't see it and I got no proof
[1:36:12] what does he do he runs down to Hell
[1:36:14] with Satan he saves Like Jesus Does it's
[1:36:17] just up in the cloud
[1:36:19] and he's got a backup of everything
[1:36:20] we've ever done
[1:36:22] but it's all back in hell and he goes
[1:36:23] back to Hell doesn't he he sits down and
[1:36:25] he's furiously walking at his computer
[1:36:27] trying to pull up all of the sin debt
[1:36:29] the proof the ledgers of everything
[1:36:31] we've ever done the one and a half
[1:36:33] million kilometers of sins that we have
[1:36:36] written in the books in the ledgers of
[1:36:38] hell
[1:36:39] and all of a sudden he starts to get a
[1:36:42] cold clammy feeling
[1:36:44] because nothing's showing up
[1:36:47] nothing showing up
[1:36:50] says something's wrong
[1:36:52] Amazon told me they'd never ever fail me
[1:36:55] but they'd have a perfect backup every
[1:36:57] time and it's gone
[1:37:00] now at that moment
[1:37:03] there's a knock on the door
[1:37:06] the brand puts it this way he says that
[1:37:07] price was paid
[1:37:11] and the bondage of Satan was broke
[1:37:14] gotta put back into the hands of man
[1:37:15] away that he was looking back for he had
[1:37:18] to weep no more
[1:37:19] hit when he broke the backbone of Satan
[1:37:22] there Calvary the backbone of sin and
[1:37:23] sickness and it brings every Mortal
[1:37:26] being on the earth back into the
[1:37:28] presence of God with sins forgiven
[1:37:30] hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more
[1:37:33] can Satan block us off from God there's
[1:37:35] a highway made there's a telephone
[1:37:36] sitting there there's a line that Glory
[1:37:39] brings every person in reach of that
[1:37:41] line if a man is full of sin it
[1:37:43] connected him in unscentral he can be
[1:37:45] forgiven of that sin not only that but
[1:37:47] that sin is paid for he says oh you
[1:37:50] don't have to say I'm not worthy sure
[1:37:52] you're not you never could be but what a
[1:37:54] worthy one took your place you're free
[1:37:56] you don't have to wander anymore you
[1:37:58] don't have to be a pleasure-seeking man
[1:37:59] out here on the earth there is a
[1:38:02] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[1:38:04] Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plunge
[1:38:06] beneath the flood lose all their guilty
[1:38:08] stain you don't have to be lost there is
[1:38:11] a Highway and a way and it's called the
[1:38:14] way of Holiness the unclean don't pass
[1:38:16] over it for he comes through the
[1:38:18] fountain first and then he enters the
[1:38:20] highway he broke the powers of Satan he
[1:38:23] opened the prison doors of Hell to every
[1:38:26] man that was shut up in this earth in
[1:38:27] the prisons fearing that when he died
[1:38:29] what death would be to him on Calvary he
[1:38:32] opened those cell doors and let every
[1:38:34] captive Go free you don't have to no
[1:38:37] longer be torn down by sin you don't
[1:38:39] have to no longer yield your members to
[1:38:41] sin to drinking to smoking to gambling
[1:38:43] to telling lies you can be honest just
[1:38:46] an upright and Satan can do nothing
[1:38:48] about it because you've got a hold of a
[1:38:51] line a Lifeline that's anchored in the
[1:38:53] rock of of Ages nothing can shake you
[1:38:56] from it no winds can shake you no
[1:38:57] nothing not even death itself can
[1:39:00] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:39:01] in Christ Jesus that's what Calvary
[1:39:03] meant men that were in bondage were set
[1:39:07] free men that were once under fear of
[1:39:09] death can no longer fear death a man who
[1:39:12] Longs for a city whose Builder and maker
[1:39:14] God he can step on the highway and set
[1:39:17] his face towards heaven because he's
[1:39:19] free Hallelujah he's redeemed he don't
[1:39:22] need to wander no more for there is a
[1:39:24] way of knowing whether you're right or
[1:39:26] not God gives us life our sins are gone
[1:39:29] that day at Calvary pay the price
[1:39:33] Satan's sitting there and he's sitting
[1:39:35] there and that knock comes on the door
[1:39:36] and like I said he's got that little
[1:39:38] inkling something isn't quite right
[1:39:40] something's changed he says but I know I
[1:39:43] killed him
[1:39:44] I know he's dead
[1:39:46] so we should be good and then that knock
[1:39:48] comes on the door brother Bradham
[1:39:50] dramatizes it he says oh he come down
[1:39:52] into the lower pits of hell he went he
[1:39:54] knocked at the doors of the
[1:39:56] devil's hell and the Devil comes to the
[1:39:59] door as we would look to see and there
[1:40:00] he said well here you are after all I
[1:40:03] sure thought I had you when I killed the
[1:40:04] prophets I was sure I had you when I had
[1:40:07] John's head cut off in prison but now
[1:40:09] after all you've got here
[1:40:12] Satan thought he still had an ace
[1:40:15] I can hear him say it as he said
[1:40:17] straighten himself up and said Satan
[1:40:21] I'm the virgin-born son of the Living
[1:40:23] God my blood's still wet on the cross I
[1:40:28] paid the price I've conquered and I've
[1:40:31] come down to take over and strip you of
[1:40:34] everything you claim you had he reached
[1:40:38] over to his side and jerked those keys
[1:40:40] of death and hell off of him kicked them
[1:40:42] back into the place where he belonged he
[1:40:44] conquered hell when he rose he had the
[1:40:46] keys of death and Hell hanging on his
[1:40:48] side what's the church scared about then
[1:40:50] he says amen he conquered Satan he
[1:40:53] conquered sickness he conquered death he
[1:40:56] conquered hell he's on his Road out
[1:40:59] he's on his Road out I want you to put
[1:41:01] that today because he's come and then
[1:41:03] there's a road that's going out he says
[1:41:05] remember there's some more faithful that
[1:41:08] went on too they were in A Place Called
[1:41:10] Paradise they could not go into the
[1:41:12] presence of God
[1:41:13] because they have worship under the shed
[1:41:15] blood of lambs and goats and so forth he
[1:41:18] says it never divorced sin it only
[1:41:20] covered sin and that's it today friend
[1:41:23] you can't cover your sins and get in
[1:41:25] it's got to be got rid of and there's
[1:41:27] only one thing will do it that is in
[1:41:30] your church that isn't your baptism by
[1:41:32] the water that's the blood of Jesus
[1:41:35] Christ that covers sin and divorces it
[1:41:37] that me the only means of conquering
[1:41:40] that there is is through the blood of
[1:41:43] the Lord Jesus
[1:41:45] that was a rough day to be Satan he's
[1:41:48] sitting there he's got a sore bottom
[1:41:50] where Jesus kicked him he doesn't have
[1:41:52] the keys to his own house or his kingdom
[1:41:54] and half of it's been emptied and
[1:41:56] they've gone up in a general
[1:41:57] Resurrection
[1:41:59] what a day that was for Satan
[1:42:02] and ever since he's been trying to tell
[1:42:03] us it didn't happen
[1:42:06] that's what he's trying to tell us every
[1:42:07] single day because what's he doing he's
[1:42:10] trying to pull up something that's not
[1:42:11] on the screen anymore and he sits there
[1:42:13] and he tries to tell you and he tries to
[1:42:15] tell me that you're not worthy
[1:42:17] that you've done too much you've sinned
[1:42:20] away your day of Grace
[1:42:22] you're not consistent enough
[1:42:25] you have no gifts
[1:42:29] come on
[1:42:31] what does he tell us
[1:42:33] everything that he remembers that's
[1:42:35] buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:42:37] listen The Ledger is empty
[1:42:40] he holds it up
[1:42:42] I'm not going to hold up the Bible
[1:42:43] because that's not it I'm going to hold
[1:42:44] up for the Bob's songbook he says I got
[1:42:46] everything you ever did in here you know
[1:42:48] what you do say Satan
[1:42:50] show me
[1:42:52] because I'm going to read mine
[1:42:55] and it says I never did it
[1:42:57] so let's compare ledgers
[1:42:59] let's compare ledgers and you start
[1:43:01] pointing him to what this word says you
[1:43:03] didn't didn't do and he'll go away real
[1:43:04] quick
[1:43:06] amen
[1:43:07] every record completely erased amen he
[1:43:10] has no ammunition against US unless you
[1:43:12] let him
[1:43:14] yeah and when you realize the price is
[1:43:15] paid he can't hold it over your head
[1:43:17] once you repent there is nothing to be
[1:43:18] held against you
[1:43:21] brother man says oh I'm not excited I
[1:43:23] know exactly where I'm standing I know
[1:43:25] exactly what I'm talking about oh if I
[1:43:28] could only express my feelings if I
[1:43:30] could only tell this audience what it
[1:43:31] really means to be sitting under the
[1:43:33] anointing of this rock Jesus Christ
[1:43:35] Jesus he already paid your judgment boy
[1:43:38] your sickness took your sorrow and
[1:43:40] settled the question before God are you
[1:43:43] scared to put your trust in him you
[1:43:45] don't have to be judged you don't have
[1:43:47] to think yourself worthy you'll never be
[1:43:49] worthy but Christ was worthy in your
[1:43:52] stead that paid the price he says not
[1:43:54] trying to redeem something you can't
[1:43:56] redeem it because you ain't got the
[1:43:58] money to but God had the money and he
[1:44:00] sent Christ and settled the bill and
[1:44:02] redeemed you from your sickness your
[1:44:05] Sorrows your worry your sin and your
[1:44:07] backsliding
[1:44:09] he sent the money which was Christ Jesus
[1:44:11] and deposited it on Calgary on
[1:44:13] golgotha's hill and tonight every one of
[1:44:16] you is free if you'll just believe it
[1:44:20] if y'all just believe it he says you're
[1:44:22] free from anything that Satan tries to
[1:44:24] lay on top of you don't ever he says
[1:44:26] ever try and make payments
[1:44:29] don't ever try and pay for it
[1:44:32] you can't do it
[1:44:33] why price has already been paid
[1:44:37] there's nothing to pay
[1:44:39] so why are you trying to pay on it
[1:44:42] you can't do it there's nothing there
[1:44:43] but Abraham says you're free if you'll
[1:44:45] just believe it if you'll just believe
[1:44:48] it amen we're going to preach on freedom
[1:44:49] here pretty soon on that scripture that
[1:44:51] he who the son sets free is free indeed
[1:44:53] amen but the beauty is when you're free
[1:44:55] like I said you don't have to pretend
[1:44:57] there's no pretense in a true son and
[1:44:59] daughter of God you know when you've got
[1:45:01] it you know when you've got it remember
[1:45:03] brother Brahm said there's a way to know
[1:45:04] that you're right with God he says it's
[1:45:06] when he puts you through the blood and
[1:45:08] puts you on the road on the Highway of
[1:45:10] Holiness and you can stay in there and
[1:45:12] you can continue all the way into that
[1:45:14] eternal life that he promised amen it's
[1:45:16] always through the blood of Calvary
[1:45:17] Church you're debt free tonight
[1:45:19] you've been debt free and you didn't
[1:45:20] know it
[1:45:22] don't let Satan try and put it back on
[1:45:24] you
[1:45:25] man let's stand together if we would
[1:45:33] you know when he
[1:45:36] we get down
[1:45:38] we mess up
[1:45:39] we fail
[1:45:41] say the wrong thing do the wrong thing
[1:45:43] sometimes we don't just quite do it
[1:45:45] perfectly right and we sit there and
[1:45:47] we'll beat ourselves up sometimes we
[1:45:49] mess up bad and sometimes we mess up a
[1:45:50] little but guess what a Son of God a
[1:45:52] daughter of God you mess up it it hurts
[1:45:55] hurts your conscience it it shames you
[1:45:57] it makes you feel like you're maybe not
[1:45:59] what you ought to be and Satan will
[1:46:01] build on top of that every single time
[1:46:02] that is a foundation for Satan to start
[1:46:04] trying to build up that mountain of sin
[1:46:06] dead on you you got to say it is paid it
[1:46:09] is paid and you can't put that on me it
[1:46:11] doesn't even exist I've repented I'm a
[1:46:14] son I'm a daughter of God he paid the
[1:46:16] price for me and you ain't laying that
[1:46:18] one on me and you throw it right back at
[1:46:19] him and say listen this one's on you
[1:46:20] buddy this one's on you you go pay for
[1:46:23] it because guess what he's going to pay
[1:46:25] the price in the end isn't he
[1:46:27] and let's just bow our heads together
[1:46:29] Lord God
[1:46:32] Lord how it humbles us
[1:46:35] Lord to sit and listen to the
[1:46:39] Lord the beating
[1:46:41] the whipping
[1:46:42] the mangling
[1:46:44] Lord the destruction that you went
[1:46:46] through in your body
[1:46:47] Lord to pay a price for all of us
[1:46:51] Lord and you didn't do it because we
[1:46:53] were going to pay you back
[1:46:55] Lord you did it of your own free will
[1:46:58] and Lord we want to thank you tonight

[1:47:20] may we not get caught up in our own self
[1:47:22] and our own spirituality in our own
[1:47:24] Revelation and our own goodness Lord
[1:47:26] that we'd ever Place ourselves next to
[1:47:28] you when it comes to these things Lord
[1:47:30] but may we stay ever close to Calvary we
[1:47:32] pray Lord keep us humble Lord

[1:47:39] price that you paid for us we ask Lord
[1:47:41] Lord if there's any here that's burdened
[1:47:43] tonight Lord may they know they are free

[1:47:48] beating on Lord may you deliver them
[1:47:50] this evening we pray Lord if there's any
