[43:28] by the grace of God Amen brother I tell
[43:31] you the ministry of the hours of Malachi
[43:33] for ministry proved Immanuel a man as
[43:37] the father God stood many times behind
[43:39] the pulpit and said he said I can't do
[43:41] this he said I got to get out of the way
[43:43] so he can do it
[43:44] a man so he got out of the way so Jesus
[43:46] could do this and Jesus could could
[43:48] reveal the thoughts and intents of the
[43:50] heart
[43:51] Jesus could discern the thoughts and
[43:52] intents of the heart and you know what
[43:54] he did and he's still doing it a man
[43:57] through the Ministry of the word he's
[43:59] still doing it and we're praying tonight
[44:00] that's where the Ministry of the word
[44:01] through our brother George Smith the
[44:03] Lord is going to discern the thoughts
[44:05] and the intents of arts a man so I want
[44:08] you to be there pulling on the word a
[44:10] man if you wanted you have to pull on it
[44:13] by the great you have to have a hunger
[44:15] for it and a third sort by the grace of
[44:17] God amen no matter who was behind the
[44:19] bull but even if the Prophet himself
[44:21] were here a man you'd have to pull on
[44:24] the word the public God said he said you
[44:27] know I come out and stood in the bull
[44:29] but and the anointing wasn't in the in
[44:30] the congregation he said I did this to
[44:32] the preacher might as well just just get
[44:34] away from the bull be a man because why
[44:36] because what goes on here depends on
[44:38] what's going on there a man there has to
[44:41] be a hunger there has to be a thirst a
[44:43] man and God is going to respond to that
[44:46] hunger and respond to that thirst by
[44:48] ending the ministry anyway we're
[44:51] believing tonight that God is going to
[44:52] respond to your hunger your thirst and
[44:54] he could have known the ministry of our
[44:56] brother George Smith amen

[45:21] testimony hey man now he send them to

[51:45] [Music]
[51:48] let's look the Lord in prayer
[51:51] my precious Heavenly Father were so
[51:53] thankful to be here one more time thank
[51:55] you Lord that you've made this possible
[51:57] that you've arranged the details or
[52:00] there's many places that we could be and
[52:02] there's many congregations but you've
[52:04] got us here father we're just thankful
[52:07] to be in fellowship with like-minded
[52:08] believers pray that you anoint your word
[52:11] help us Lord to speak only what's truth
[52:14] Lord than me we may go from here better
[52:17] than when we came in bless each one Lord
[52:19] we ask in Jesus name Amen you may be
[52:23] seated it's good to be back in the what
[52:29] I call the edge of the universe out here
[52:31] but what's amazing to me is you can
[52:36] travel this far and they still speak
[52:37] English it's usually with another
[52:43] language by the time you go that far but
[52:45] we're glad to be here and thank God that
[52:48] there's saints that are staying true to
[52:50] the word that's that's not true
[52:53] everywhere
[52:54] recently I was over in Africa in Malawi
[52:58] which is small country just west of
[53:01] Mozambique and so it's a very poor
[53:06] country it's not a first world country
[53:08] by any means but they had invited us
[53:10] over for a few days and we had some
[53:12] tremendous meetings I was there ten days
[53:14] we had 14 services so this is restful
[53:17] here it's compared to that but the
[53:22] they've done a good job the brothers
[53:24] have have spread the gospel and they're
[53:26] doing doing great work we were in one
[53:28] service where they had like 700 people
[53:31] and they didn't have benches like these
[53:35] there wasn't any cushion and there
[53:38] wasn't in the back just bored did you
[53:41] sit on so nobody goes to sleep in that
[53:43] church
[53:44] and they had one keyboard and two lights
[53:48] and that was service but they sang in
[53:51] time and they sang beautifully so we had
[53:53] a good time in another place we saw
[53:55] where that people weren't turning to the
[53:57] Bible you know with the translator had a
[53:59] Bible so I knew they had it in their
[54:00] language but the people didn't have
[54:03] Bibles none so we've come to find out
[54:05] that a lot of the homes just did not
[54:07] have a Bible in their home so we checked
[54:11] with the local Bible story yeah we got
[54:12] Bibles and three or four languages and
[54:15] so we got a list from the pastor you
[54:18] know so that there would be one Bible
[54:20] for home and we're gonna give everybody
[54:22] about well it's impossible but we
[54:24] promise to to try to get a Bible for
[54:26] each home so think at least how do you
[54:28] preach the people don't have a Bible you
[54:30] know and so we got the list and the
[54:34] Bibles were like ten dollars a piece or
[54:35] something nice nice Bible from their
[54:37] language
[54:38] well now we're not going to fuss about
[54:39] whether it's King James or that's not
[54:41] important the fact is they have
[54:42] scripture in their language and God
[54:45] speaks to them in their language so as
[54:49] far as I know it's a great translation
[54:51] and we were able to supply know that
[54:55] need and then there's another one over a
[54:57] little farther people couldn't get there
[54:58] but I also checked with the local
[55:01] brother in charge of you know the
[55:05] distribution of books oh no we don't
[55:07] have anymore church age books well
[55:09] that's too bad so we're gonna print some
[55:12] in South Africa and get them over there
[55:13] because some of them speak English and
[55:16] some of them speak the local local
[55:17] language which is chicha Wow
[55:19] that means nothing to you but did you
[55:23] see God loves variety you know he's got
[55:28] a little bit of each kind of person to
[55:31] ministers word so anyway that's where we
[55:33] were recently and other places but God
[55:38] knows what he's doing and he's got us
[55:41] here to listen and see if we can learn
[55:43] something so in these three services
[55:45] we're going to see how far we can get
[55:47] into the book of Acts the book of Acts
[55:49] is the only book that's not finished all
[55:52] the other books come to a conclusion but
[55:54] the book of Acts has been going on
[55:56] you're part of the book of
[55:58] 21st century and it's not really the
[56:02] book of Acts of the Apostles it's book
[56:04] of Acts it's the book of the Holy Spirit
[56:07] acts of the Holy Spirit in the lives of
[56:10] early believers because these are this
[56:13] is a summary and all these details of
[56:15] what was going on and so keep your keep
[56:19] your Bible handy because we're gonna go
[56:20] into some some details of the book of
[56:23] Acts and you can make notes you can you
[56:26] know study it and this is designed to
[56:29] make you want to go in and read your
[56:31] Bible and confirm these details and see
[56:35] what else God has for you but it's very
[56:38] foundational because sometimes we've got
[56:40] to go back and see why do we believe
[56:42] this why why did we do these things you
[56:44] know so the writer of this book is
[56:47] brother Luke he was a beloved physician
[56:49] and he was a doctor of a high level
[56:54] Greek citizen he was a writer and he
[56:56] accompanied Paul on a lot of his
[56:58] missionary journeys he did a lot of the
[57:02] writing Paul did the speaking and so
[57:05] he's believed that Luke actually wrote a
[57:08] lot of the New Testament and of course
[57:11] we have the other point that we got to
[57:12] make here that we have the argument
[57:15] today well you know that church age book
[57:17] I don't know it sure looks like somebody
[57:18] else well yeah because brother branham
[57:21] didn't have you know grammar like you
[57:24] that graduated from high school in
[57:25] college but we always think of the book
[57:28] of Romans as you know oh yeah Paul wrote
[57:32] the Romans uh everybody agrees on that
[57:34] well if you look at Romans 16 and what
[57:37] is it verse 22 I turn to us who wrote
[57:40] this epistle salutes you in the Lord so
[57:42] even back there we have the author and
[57:45] the writer so end of argument so you
[57:49] might think well why is this important
[57:50] we thought you just going to come over
[57:51] here and bring us a revival no the
[57:53] revival is in you it's in the word
[57:56] it's reviving what you have so we're
[57:59] just trying to let you see where we came
[58:03] from that we're part of this this family
[58:05] and we're here at the end time the world
[58:07] is falling apart and the resurrection is
[58:09] imminent
[58:09] well you see
[58:11] in brother Browns ministry he had a
[58:14] visitation with you which he called
[58:17] beyond the curtain of time and of course
[58:20] what we like to remember is the
[58:22] beautiful girls was along here and the
[58:23] crystal eyes and the nice white teeth
[58:25] and all that but he did say that
[58:28] everything was beyond perfect he didn't
[58:31] have word to describe it and so then
[58:33] when it got down to the fact that he's
[58:35] got to be judged for what he said then
[58:37] he didn't have to start biting his
[58:40] fingernails well I wish I could go back
[58:41] and erase something like I would know he
[58:43] just said well what about Paul well
[58:45] he'll be judged for his message also and
[58:49] so immediately brother Bram said well
[58:51] then there's no problem I preached what
[58:53] Paul preached and all of us that were
[58:56] there we said we're depending on that
[58:58] we're not depending on whether he got
[59:00] Mary's name right or whether this or
[59:02] that all these details people arguing
[59:04] about he preached what Paul preached and
[59:06] so we're totally with the green light to
[59:09] go in and see how this church started
[59:11] what did Paul preach how did we get to
[59:14] where we are today and so we are a vital
[59:19] part of God's program you're out here
[59:22] other people are farther west and
[59:24] there's other people in London and all
[59:26] these places around the world but no one
[59:28] is gonna go in the rapture without the
[59:32] baptismal Holy Ghost you're not gonna be
[59:34] going anywhere it's got to be in you and
[59:37] divine love reflecting daily and that is
[59:40] why we come to church to see what's
[59:42] missing you know when you when you go
[59:44] get ready for church you look in the
[59:46] mirror you know to see what's
[59:47] everything's in place now see I don't
[59:49] need a narrative mirror to call my hair
[59:51] like you know these sisters do but those
[59:54] of you that have to look in the mirror
[59:56] it's important that you have a clean
[59:58] mirror well this mirror is always clean
[1:00:01] all we're trying to do is hold it at the
[1:00:03] right angle so you can see yourself you
[1:00:05] know and so we have the the fact that
[1:00:10] brother Branham says back to the word
[1:00:12] over 200 times
[1:00:14] well then might be important that we go
[1:00:16] back to the word another place he says I
[1:00:18] think we're not getting people to Christ
[1:00:20] no we're getting people to a theory we
[1:00:23] can't we have brand mites and then we
[1:00:24] got
[1:00:25] we got people that are they're only good
[1:00:27] to argue about oh you left out the thaw
[1:00:29] and you should have said this look we're
[1:00:32] not in the start here we come here to
[1:00:34] worship God and to see what's missing so
[1:00:37] Luke became a disciple not an apostle a
[1:00:41] disciple as they follow her okay
[1:00:43] well Jesus was on earth he had 12
[1:00:45] disciples and apostles one that it sent
[1:00:49] out a missionary like an axe one and
[1:00:51] eight
[1:00:51] Luke accompanied Paul the great
[1:00:53] missionary and the original disciples
[1:00:57] were mostly fishermen and many of them
[1:00:59] couldn't even sign their name so when
[1:01:02] you go looking and reading in 1st to 2nd
[1:01:05] Peter okay that's that's kind of what he
[1:01:07] said but those aren't his exact words
[1:01:09] because he didn't speak like that they
[1:01:10] edited it to where you could understand
[1:01:12] what he was saying but they were
[1:01:14] fishermen one was a tax collector one
[1:01:18] was a revolutionary Simon the zealot he
[1:01:21] was a fanatic
[1:01:22] that's all in chapter 10 of Matthew so
[1:01:24] these eleven disciples they became
[1:01:27] apostles okay and they were ordinary man
[1:01:31] the God used in extraordinary ways to
[1:01:33] spread the gospel they and they were
[1:01:36] endued with power early in chapter 2
[1:01:39] that we'll get to that before you get
[1:01:40] too excited there's most of you probably
[1:01:42] know there's 28 chapters in the book of
[1:01:44] you know the Acts we won't get to all
[1:01:47] those chapters in these three days so
[1:01:50] wherever we get to we'll just say ok
[1:01:53] continued and we'll come back another
[1:01:54] time
[1:01:55] but these these people that we're going
[1:01:59] to talk about these were God's choice
[1:02:01] okay and it all worked out a lot of
[1:02:04] times we look at situations
[1:02:05] why is God using him why didn't he use
[1:02:08] me and that kind of stuff well god knows
[1:02:10] what he's doing you know there's a
[1:02:12] scripture in Psalms 46:10 be still that
[1:02:16] means just zip it we don't need your
[1:02:19] opinions be still I'm God I got it all
[1:02:23] figured out you know so extraordinary
[1:02:27] acts the Holy Ghost in ordinary people
[1:02:29] so we're going to see and there were
[1:02:31] people just like us okay they were
[1:02:33] filled with God's power Christ in spirit
[1:02:36] form showed them how to apply
[1:02:38] their faith and we can learn we can
[1:02:40] repeat and you know memorize but we
[1:02:44] don't have the the grace to make it live
[1:02:46] it's just more words see so God still in
[1:02:50] business today he's still changing lives
[1:02:52] filling believers to live through dark
[1:02:55] Laodicea okay so this was originally a
[1:02:59] letter that dr. Luke wrote to his pagan
[1:03:02] friend Theophilus a great wealthy Greek
[1:03:05] man in order to give the complete
[1:03:07] narrative of Jesus life his works and
[1:03:10] his teachings and thereby proved that
[1:03:12] Christianity is the only true religion
[1:03:14] okay and it is for everyone no matter
[1:03:18] what the class or position of life but
[1:03:20] not everyone is interested to receive it
[1:03:23] because jesus said what oh here in John
[1:03:26] 3:16 just read it here quickly and John
[1:03:32] 3:16 where he says for God so loved the
[1:03:34] world
[1:03:35] that's the Pope's favorite Scripture Oh
[1:03:37] Oh world yeah everybody's welcome
[1:03:39] ok then we've got another part of the
[1:03:41] verse then He gave His only begotten Son
[1:03:43] you notice Mary's not mentioned there
[1:03:45] didn't give Mary he gave his only
[1:03:47] begotten Son that whosoever believeth on
[1:03:50] him shall not perish but have
[1:03:53] everlasting life for God sent not his
[1:03:55] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:03:57] but that the world through him might be
[1:03:58] saved
[1:03:59] he that believeth on him is not
[1:04:01] condemned but he who believeth not is
[1:04:03] condemned already because he has not
[1:04:05] believed in the name of the only
[1:04:08] begotten Son of God then name there's a
[1:04:11] whole teaching right on that and we're
[1:04:13] gonna see some of that in our study here
[1:04:15] but the Gospel of Luke and the book of
[1:04:19] Acts are a two volume set that are
[1:04:23] written maybe 30 years after the
[1:04:24] resurrection and of course dr. Luke
[1:04:26] being a cultured highly trained Greek
[1:04:28] citizen he spoke in the classic Greek
[1:04:31] style another point that you're going to
[1:04:33] notice is the Holy Spirit is referred to
[1:04:35] more than 50 times in this one book
[1:04:37] either the Holy Ghost the spirit
[1:04:40] relation to the baptism the Holy Spirit
[1:04:43] or being filled with Holy Spirit or
[1:04:45] being led by the Holy Spirit it's all
[1:04:47] part of this and of course that's the
[1:04:50] message that carries over to our day
[1:04:52] we must have the holy spirit or you will
[1:04:55] stay behind guarantee aim okay no
[1:05:00] shortcuts there's no respect to persons
[1:05:02] no matter what your name is no matter
[1:05:04] who your grandpa is or anything there's
[1:05:06] one way to God no other way one way now
[1:05:10] in when you see the cross and I was
[1:05:13] looking for that you have a cross here
[1:05:14] somewhere well you know what the cross
[1:05:16] looks like there's a long part there's a
[1:05:18] short part okay now we take out the
[1:05:22] level to show you that the long part is
[1:05:25] your prayer life and as you continue if
[1:05:29] you keep a steady prayer life God will
[1:05:33] take care of the horizontal and keep you
[1:05:36] in balance hope it's good if not we got
[1:05:42] start there so God knows what he's doing
[1:05:46] and in verse 1 of chapter one the former
[1:05:49] treaties have I'm a daught the awfullest
[1:05:51] of all that Jesus began to both to do
[1:05:55] and teach so that's the Book of Luke
[1:05:56] until the day in which he was taken up
[1:05:58] after that he through the Holy Ghost
[1:06:03] said given Commandments unto the
[1:06:05] Apostles whom he had chosen here's what
[1:06:07] he told him to whom he also showed
[1:06:09] himself alive after his passion by many
[1:06:12] infallible proofs being seen of them
[1:06:16] forty days and speaking of the things
[1:06:19] pertaining to the kingdom of God okay so
[1:06:22] this is the only mention that you're
[1:06:24] going to find in Scripture of the
[1:06:26] timeframe between the resurrection and
[1:06:30] the Ascension 40 days okay and we have
[1:06:34] our prophet that comes along now and he
[1:06:36] says can't you see that we're at the end
[1:06:38] time it's all over now this is 19 and 62
[1:06:42] a long time ago the next thing will be
[1:06:44] the it will be a sweep that will get
[1:06:47] that little group together in a month or
[1:06:49] so she'll be gone as soon as she has
[1:06:51] gathered together we're at the end
[1:06:53] there's no hope stuff nowhere run to
[1:06:56] Christ and then he said somewhere else I
[1:07:00] think we're not quite getting people to
[1:07:02] Christ we're getting them to a
[1:07:04] arguing point maybe but the point is we
[1:07:06] got to make Christ's real to the people
[1:07:08] of our generation and in this case here
[1:07:12] we don't know what he said in those
[1:07:13] forty days I have no idea speaking of
[1:07:15] the things pertaining to the kingdom of
[1:07:17] God so today let's not waste time and
[1:07:20] energy wandering out into the desert of
[1:07:22] speculation you know and wondering oh
[1:07:25] just leave it alone God's in charge to
[1:07:28] the details I've got too many friends
[1:07:31] that are so worried about what's going
[1:07:32] to happen over there they've ignored
[1:07:34] right here and their kids went to the
[1:07:35] world now they're worried oh why because
[1:07:38] you didn't have a proper atmosphere at
[1:07:39] home if we have things running through
[1:07:41] that home and provide the proper
[1:07:42] atmosphere of the word they're not gonna
[1:07:44] be running away and doing things no
[1:07:46] they're gonna stay here but so what
[1:07:47] we're so busy arguing about doctrine and
[1:07:49] things go just come back to the word you
[1:07:51] know so we just need to focus on getting
[1:07:55] to the door of the resurrection you know
[1:07:58] now verse four so we're going slow
[1:08:01] because so you can get it and being
[1:08:03] assembled together with them commanded
[1:08:05] them that they should not depart from
[1:08:08] Jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:08:10] the father which he said ye have heard
[1:08:13] of me according to hear of him that's
[1:08:16] back in John 14 and and then verse five
[1:08:20] for John truly baptized with water but
[1:08:23] you shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:08:24] Ghost not many days hence when they
[1:08:26] therefore were come together they asked
[1:08:29] him they had some questions they're
[1:08:31] talking with a resurrected being never
[1:08:34] happened before in the world and here
[1:08:35] they're talking to resurrected being and
[1:08:37] they said Lord will you restore again
[1:08:40] the Kingdom of Israel will you take the
[1:08:42] Romans off our back and and let us you
[1:08:45] know come into a peaceful Israel so
[1:08:48] after experiencing these these
[1:08:50] infallible proofs having close
[1:08:52] fellowship with the resurrected being
[1:08:53] and having meals together Lord this is
[1:08:57] wonderful but now are you are you gonna
[1:08:58] give her these guys you know that was
[1:09:01] the greatest question there were humans
[1:09:02] like us here they put they were blessed
[1:09:05] into the meetings they were blessed and
[1:09:07] yet they were worried about politics in
[1:09:10] the lom's uh Bible on if you ever heard
[1:09:12] of it but this is the Blom's of Bible
[1:09:14] okay let me give you a short explanation
[1:09:16] the Bible we have
[1:09:18] came from the Greek and Hebrew into
[1:09:21] Latin and then it came to German and he
[1:09:24] came to English and finally we ended up
[1:09:26] with King James Version where as alums
[1:09:29] of Bible came straight from the ancient
[1:09:31] text didn't come through German and so
[1:09:33] forth and the Spanish Bible came right
[1:09:35] from the Latin and they're all very
[1:09:38] similar but in verse 7 he says it is not
[1:09:42] for you to know the time or the times
[1:09:44] which the father has put under his own
[1:09:45] authority in other words it's none of
[1:09:48] your business what we would say today
[1:09:50] they should have understood by now that
[1:09:53] rebellion and retaliation against Rome
[1:09:55] was not the proper Christian attitude I
[1:09:58] should have been able to see that but
[1:10:01] rather faithfulness to the message of
[1:10:02] the hour and the lifestyle of the gospel
[1:10:05] and simply imitating the master that's
[1:10:08] what they should have understood by that
[1:10:09] you see so brother brems says over here
[1:10:12] and we're gonna be in dispersing you
[1:10:15] know parts of the message in here so
[1:10:17] that she can you know bring it to light
[1:10:19] but he says how we need in services well
[1:10:21] thousands of lived voices the thunder of
[1:10:24] God thundering out now that has been
[1:10:27] taken in such a bad context that we're
[1:10:29] trying to beat people in submission but
[1:10:31] he says thundering the the thunder of
[1:10:34] God thundering out in sweetness holiness
[1:10:37] purity undefiled lives walking around
[1:10:40] the earth today without a blemish
[1:10:42] that's the thunder of God yes sir real
[1:10:46] Christians that's the thunder against
[1:10:48] the enemy the devil doesn't care how
[1:10:49] loud you can holler
[1:10:50] he doesn't count how how high you can
[1:10:52] jump all these things what hurts the
[1:10:54] devil is to see that sanctified holy
[1:10:58] life consecrated to God that's how you
[1:11:01] hurt the devil it's not screaming and
[1:11:03] shouting say anything to this person
[1:11:05] call him anything he's just as sweet as
[1:11:07] can be
[1:11:08] moves right along that throws him away
[1:11:10] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:11:12] and that's what was going on in these
[1:11:14] lives fears were gonna see okay so verse
[1:11:17] eight he's talking to him still but you
[1:11:21] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:11:23] has come upon you and you shall be
[1:11:25] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[1:11:26] that's right here in town or in Judea
[1:11:31] or in Samaria and to the other most part
[1:11:33] of the earth right here gospel didn't
[1:11:37] come in a pair of sheep people somebody
[1:11:39] became in a boat or a horse and brought
[1:11:42] it over here yeah so and then in verse 9
[1:11:47] he disappears vanished into a cloud and
[1:11:50] they went and did what he said
[1:11:53] tarry in Jerusalem until you've received
[1:11:56] the power now you might be thinking well
[1:11:59] this is kind of shallow yeah it's very
[1:12:01] shallow because we got all kinds of
[1:12:03] Christians here we got a guy back here
[1:12:06] named Levi is probably not over what six
[1:12:08] years old huh seven small seven okay so
[1:12:14] there's all kinds of people so we have
[1:12:17] to bring it so that everybody can eat
[1:12:19] you see but we you know yeah but we're
[1:12:22] the bride we're up here in the top of
[1:12:23] the pyramid we're ready to blast off are
[1:12:24] you with all the stuff still going on
[1:12:27] you know and we want to hear the deep
[1:12:29] things of God well just listen you'll
[1:12:31] find something here but we don't want to
[1:12:33] be careful how we judge you know we have
[1:12:36] an entire library of prophetic
[1:12:38] recordings you can go there and hear all
[1:12:40] the mysteries and all the great things
[1:12:41] and it all points to Jesus Christ okay
[1:12:46] so that's what we got stay balanced okay
[1:12:49] and did you see not everybody had the
[1:12:53] same kind of breakfast or same kind of
[1:12:54] supper we don't even like the same kind
[1:12:56] of coffee do we all a little different
[1:12:58] see and not everybody came the same kind
[1:13:01] of car out there well we're not no we're
[1:13:03] not the Xerox machine here we're
[1:13:05] Christians from progress okay Bible
[1:13:08] tells us in first John three four this
[1:13:11] is the message that you have heard from
[1:13:13] the beginning that we should love one
[1:13:15] another now we can try in this flesh but
[1:13:18] it's very a very automatic when you have
[1:13:19] the baptism all Holy Ghost and the
[1:13:22] baptism the Holy Ghost is not optional
[1:13:23] it's imperative if you want to be with
[1:13:25] us at the meeting in the air okay so
[1:13:29] Jesus leaves and these two angels
[1:13:31] appeared in verse 11 you men of Galilee
[1:13:34] why stand ye gazing into the heaven the
[1:13:37] same Jesus which is taken from you into
[1:13:40] heaven shall so come in like manner as
[1:13:42] you have
[1:13:43] see him go into heaven and from this
[1:13:46] first we have the private interpretation
[1:13:48] that the cloud of 1963 is the
[1:13:51] fulfillment of these words but that's
[1:13:53] nowhere on tape okay
[1:13:56] it's not stated anywhere let's stay with
[1:13:58] what we know that was brother brems
[1:14:00] vision it was for him and we're just
[1:14:03] trying to live our message today okay
[1:14:08] verses 12 through 15 they got together
[1:14:10] in the upper room Mary the mother was
[1:14:13] there the mother of Jesus
[1:14:15] yes his very family she was saintly she
[1:14:18] was obedient she was walking in the
[1:14:21] truth of the hour she was not arrogant
[1:14:24] selfish or demanding she was just an
[1:14:28] obedient lamb she's one of the believers
[1:14:30] and it really scares me when I see
[1:14:33] preachers that can't sit on the second
[1:14:35] row and say man they got a if they can't
[1:14:37] be up here they can stay home well
[1:14:39] that's not God's Way that's arrogant
[1:14:42] then in verse 12 we have what's called
[1:14:45] the Sabbath day's journey we could make
[1:14:47] a whole study on that but it's
[1:14:48] approximately 3,000 feet and there was a
[1:14:51] reason for that because they lived under
[1:14:52] the law there were strict things they
[1:14:54] could do and couldn't do the same and
[1:14:57] first Corinthians 15:6 he says he was
[1:14:59] seen about five hundred brethren at once
[1:15:02] at once so it's commonly understood that
[1:15:04] that's the 500 that was on the Mount of
[1:15:06] Olives and so I am go away you know we
[1:15:09] don't know but if that's the fact
[1:15:12] then only 120 actually made it to the
[1:15:15] Upper Room which is only 24% what
[1:15:20] happened to the others maybe they didn't
[1:15:22] take it serious because there's always
[1:15:25] been the twins you know and there's
[1:15:28] always been three kinds of believers
[1:15:29] you got the believers to take it serious
[1:15:32] such as you and those others that well
[1:15:34] you know it's Friday and we got to do
[1:15:36] this and go see grandma or whatever so
[1:15:39] we have all along we've had those things
[1:15:42] see so 76 percent didn't make it to the
[1:15:45] upper room now we've been to the upper
[1:15:47] room it might have been a little bigger
[1:15:49] at that time I don't know but there's
[1:15:50] not room for no 500 anyway so God knows
[1:15:53] what he's doing
[1:15:55] so that verses 15 through 25 they're
[1:15:58] discussing the facts of the death of
[1:16:02] Judas the traitor and here's where they
[1:16:04] were quoting from they're quoting from
[1:16:08] song 41 just bring that up real quick
[1:16:12] here so psalm 41:9 says yay my own
[1:16:17] familiar friend in whom i trusted which
[1:16:20] the deed of the my bread has lifted up
[1:16:22] his heel against me they were also
[1:16:25] remembering Psalm 69 25 where it says
[1:16:35] let there have let their habitation be
[1:16:37] desolate and let no let none dwell in
[1:16:41] their tents okay so the regard regarding
[1:16:45] the fact that this man died no one shall
[1:16:47] live there they knew their Bible the
[1:16:50] Bible they had back then was only the
[1:16:52] Old Testament and it was about a
[1:16:53] 200-year old translation that they were
[1:16:55] using and to this day that hillside
[1:17:00] where Judas died there nobody lives
[1:17:02] there Jerusalem is a city of 900,000
[1:17:04] people but that is desolate nobody lives
[1:17:08] there because God's Word always says
[1:17:10] fulfillment see it's a field of blood
[1:17:13] and the rest of the chapter has to do
[1:17:17] with the replacement that they chose his
[1:17:19] name was brother Matthias
[1:17:20] and he was probably a good brother you
[1:17:22] know probably attended church regularly
[1:17:24] might even paid tithes but that's the
[1:17:27] last mention we have of him okay so they
[1:17:30] were all very human like we are just
[1:17:32] remember that they were humans like us
[1:17:34] they had the same kind of problems just
[1:17:37] maybe a little different but and brother
[1:17:40] Brennan was like us he was very human
[1:17:43] you know but the more that these people
[1:17:46] yielded to God the more he could use
[1:17:48] them brother Brennan was born a prophet
[1:17:51] but it was basically worthless
[1:17:53] until he yielded to the gospel you see
[1:17:56] so God can use you in your circle the
[1:18:02] dying generation and this is the only
[1:18:04] book that's not finished so God is still
[1:18:07] in business today
[1:18:08] you see just like in the book of Acts
[1:18:11] and we're living in the continuation of
[1:18:14] the same spirit manifesting through
[1:18:16] ordinary people that are yielded
[1:18:18] completely to Jesus Christ and Hebrews
[1:18:21] 13:8 is in effect
[1:18:22] it wasn't back there it's it's today you
[1:18:25] know he's living so get into chapter 2
[1:18:27] verse 1 it says and when the day of
[1:18:30] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:18:32] with one Accord to one place and
[1:18:35] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:18:38] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:18:41] filled all the house where they were
[1:18:42] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:18:45] cloven tongues that's like split tongues
[1:18:47] of fire and what came down on each one
[1:18:51] of them and they were all filled with
[1:18:53] the Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[1:18:54] other tongues as the Spirit gave them
[1:18:56] utterance so this is day 10 of this wait
[1:19:01] he said go there and wait he didn't say
[1:19:04] how long he didn't give him an exact
[1:19:06] Clues what was going to happen but he
[1:19:08] will know when something happens so
[1:19:10] they're waiting up there 120 in prayer
[1:19:14] and one Accord in agreement seeking the
[1:19:17] promise of chapter 1 and verse 8 and
[1:19:20] this noise from heaven came and filled
[1:19:22] the house and fire appeared on each one
[1:19:25] and so forth so the church is launched
[1:19:27] at Jerusalem okay that was the Alpha
[1:19:30] church we are the Omega church and
[1:19:32] through seven ages through two thousand
[1:19:34] years we're now restored back to the
[1:19:36] original it took it took some you know
[1:19:38] dives and you see on the graph here
[1:19:40] where there's more light and less light
[1:19:42] and so forth but we're back to the
[1:19:44] original now God has fulfilled his word
[1:19:47] we're back with a prophetic message now
[1:19:50] in verse 5 there was people from every
[1:19:53] nation God's timing is always perfect
[1:19:57] okay don't you worry about the promises
[1:20:00] and the prophecies and so forth God is
[1:20:04] on time
[1:20:06] always and so they were gathered in
[1:20:11] Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost
[1:20:13] now that was orders that they had from
[1:20:16] back in the Book of Leviticus chapter 23
[1:20:18] where God's dealing with this chosen
[1:20:20] people he instituted seven feast
[1:20:23] sessions throughout the year and in
[1:20:27] three of these feasts all the men needed
[1:20:30] to come to Jerusalem to the temple okay
[1:20:33] they're required that's in Exodus
[1:20:35] chapter 23 so this is the feast of
[1:20:38] Pentecost or feast of harvest it's a
[1:20:40] celebration of six days and that's why
[1:20:43] all these people were in Jerusalem in
[1:20:45] the first place you see and so so
[1:20:48] they're over here or spring God and the
[1:20:50] only way they know you know by the Book
[1:20:53] of Moses and so forth and up here in
[1:20:56] their upper rooms he's hundred and
[1:20:57] twenty hiding out from fear that they're
[1:20:59] going to get stoned and God had it all
[1:21:02] planned out that during these six days
[1:21:05] these ten days would also be
[1:21:07] accomplished and they would come out
[1:21:09] into the street speaking languages that
[1:21:10] these people understood now back then
[1:21:13] these people were from different
[1:21:18] countries because the Jews went
[1:21:20] everywhere but most of the people were
[1:21:25] at least bilingual maybe three languages
[1:21:27] because they knew the language of the
[1:21:29] temple that was Hebrew they all spoke
[1:21:31] Hebrew but they also spoke the language
[1:21:33] where they come from and in the in the
[1:21:37] in the scripture here we have for at
[1:21:39] least 16 different languages that are
[1:21:41] together now they're speaking Hebrew in
[1:21:43] the temple but when they're out in the
[1:21:45] street and here comes these guys
[1:21:47] bouncing out of the upper room and
[1:21:48] they're speaking in the language of
[1:21:50] their countries but with a Galilee
[1:21:52] accent now you guys all know all about
[1:21:55] odd accents like mine right and so they
[1:21:59] were speaking stuff that these guys
[1:22:01] could understand but hey they're from
[1:22:03] Galilee they're Hicks they're unlearned
[1:22:05] you know and it's exactly the opposite
[1:22:08] of what happened in Genesis 11 dat the
[1:22:10] tower Babel over there they all spoke
[1:22:13] the same language trying to build this
[1:22:14] brick thing to get to heaven God
[1:22:16] confused their languages and that was in
[1:22:18] program you know but only God can do
[1:22:20] these kind of things so while Peter had
[1:22:23] their attention he launches into his
[1:22:26] first sermon in verse 14 maybe 30
[1:22:28] minutes or less we don't know and he
[1:22:31] ends up over here in verse 36 of chapter
[1:22:34] 2 therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:22:38] know assuredly that God has made that
[1:22:40] same Jesus whom you guys crucified both
[1:22:43] Lord and Christ
[1:22:46] led entirely by the Holy Spirit in this
[1:22:49] short sermon here and he did not beat
[1:22:53] them into submission
[1:22:54] he simply was faithful to the truth you
[1:22:57] see he didn't call for an immediate
[1:22:59] response but he offered them here in
[1:23:05] verse 37 now when they heard these
[1:23:07] things they were pricked in their heart
[1:23:09] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[1:23:12] them the Apostles men and brethren what
[1:23:14] shall we do
[1:23:15] what's the next step here and Peter said
[1:23:18] repent be baptized every one of you in
[1:23:21] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:23:22] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:23:24] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:23:28] promise is unto you and your children
[1:23:31] and to all those afar off even as the
[1:23:34] many as our Lord our God shall call so
[1:23:38] this would look like it's in direct
[1:23:42] contradiction to what the Lord took told
[1:23:45] them over here in Matthew 28:19 just a
[1:23:48] few days before that and we're just
[1:23:50] going to take a few minutes on this now
[1:23:52] did I did I send you these tracts yet
[1:23:56] have you seen this everybody seen okay
[1:23:59] we have more but its history and
[1:24:02] scripture but Jesus told them over here
[1:24:04] very clearly just before he left and it
[1:24:07] wasn't you know 10 years it was just a
[1:24:09] few days ago when he's with them and he
[1:24:13] said over here in Matthew 28 all power
[1:24:19] is given unto me in heaven and earth go
[1:24:22] therefore teach all nations now make
[1:24:25] disciples out of people baptizing them
[1:24:28] in the name of the Father and of the son
[1:24:30] of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:31] teaching them to observe all things
[1:24:32] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[1:24:35] am with you always even to the end of
[1:24:37] the world
[1:24:38] a few days later first chance he gets
[1:24:41] with the microphone he comes up with
[1:24:43] this formula so I'm you know I'm not too
[1:24:46] far off base I don't thinking believing
[1:24:48] that there's one or two guys there Peter
[1:24:51] he just told us this I wrote it down he
[1:24:54] telling these people but it was the
[1:24:56] revelation of those words it was the
[1:24:58] reality and nowhere in all the book of
[1:25:01] acts until three hundred years later all
[1:25:05] that time they baptize in the name of
[1:25:06] the Lord Jesus Christ so it's the right
[1:25:10] way okay so verse 41 of chapter 2 and
[1:25:17] they they gladly received his word were
[1:25:20] baptized and the same day there were
[1:25:22] added unto them about 3,000 souls well
[1:25:27] when I get to heaven I want to find
[1:25:29] Peter he's probably not real tall you
[1:25:31] know he's probably short kind of like
[1:25:33] brother Gerald now Peter now we got to
[1:25:37] solve this there's no River there's no
[1:25:39] lake in Jerusalem where did you baptize
[1:25:41] 3,000 people
[1:25:46] but they did so this small yielded band
[1:25:50] of believers and one day grew from 120
[1:25:54] over 3,000 at the first gospel meeting
[1:25:58] God's in charge you know we can only
[1:26:01] speak the word it's up to you whether
[1:26:03] you receive it and let God do something
[1:26:05] you know Billy Graham said I have found
[1:26:08] that when the gospel of Jesus Christ is
[1:26:10] presented with Authority quoting from
[1:26:12] the very word of God he then takes that
[1:26:14] message and drives it supernaturally
[1:26:16] into the human heart only God can do
[1:26:18] that brother Brennan says preaching is
[1:26:21] God's program we we preached the truth
[1:26:24] honestly but God does the work in the
[1:26:26] human heart so you may not be gifted
[1:26:31] like Peter like some of these people you
[1:26:33] know that we're talking about but your
[1:26:36] life is preaching every moment well
[1:26:38] that's because you have the long hair or
[1:26:39] the short hair brothers be sure we
[1:26:45] thought we're talking about and I mean I
[1:26:49] think I mentioned this before francis of
[1:26:51] assisi was a gospel preacher about 900
[1:26:54] years ago he said preach always use
[1:26:57] words when necessary oh yeah but we like
[1:27:01] to talk pontificate and tell all these
[1:27:05] things know just be still just live your
[1:27:08] message God will put the question in
[1:27:10] their hearts you know and so verse 42
[1:27:14] and they continued steadfastly in the
[1:27:18] Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in
[1:27:21] breaking of bread and in prayers and
[1:27:24] fear came up on every soul and many
[1:27:26] wonders and signs were done by the
[1:27:28] apostles this is a fear like we're
[1:27:30] afraid this just as reverence and all
[1:27:34] they believed were together and had all
[1:27:36] things in common and sold their print
[1:27:38] possessions and goods and part of them
[1:27:40] to all men as every man had need okay
[1:27:43] there was unity of purpose there was
[1:27:46] fellowship and that was God's program at
[1:27:49] that time okay some have tried
[1:27:53] oh let's let's sell everything and bring
[1:27:55] it all in oh that's not
[1:27:57] program so I've tried it God's prophet
[1:28:00] told him this will not work
[1:28:01] okay so verses 46 to 47 they went to
[1:28:06] church every day they met together daily
[1:28:08] in their homes he had all those
[1:28:09] fellowship they ate together they
[1:28:12] remembered the Lord and we're having
[1:28:14] communion because in Luke 22 as often as
[1:28:17] you do this they were doing it every day
[1:28:20] so says and the Lord added to the church
[1:28:23] daily he's in charge were only the
[1:28:26] instruments you see so brother Branham
[1:28:30] says very plainly over here he says I'm
[1:28:33] just a public servant of God to you the
[1:28:37] preacher is a public servant we are not
[1:28:40] the managers of God's bride but some
[1:28:43] brothers think they are well I'm not so
[1:28:47] we only follow the New Testament
[1:28:50] examples so like you said preaching is
[1:28:54] his program and the preaching goes out
[1:28:56] through many ways I mean here we are
[1:28:57] speaking to you know 20 people or less
[1:29:00] but it's going out to who-knows-where
[1:29:01] out there and the you know the internet
[1:29:04] and then they're gonna read a brother
[1:29:06] George said brother L got up and said
[1:29:08] and so it keeps bouncing around you know
[1:29:11] and radio is one way that we've tried it
[1:29:15] in America and it doesn't work people
[1:29:17] are not interested but in Spanish it
[1:29:19] works very well
[1:29:20] people are still listening and so we're
[1:29:23] sponsoring a broadcast it actually goes
[1:29:25] out tonight I think it's from 12:00 to
[1:29:28] 10:30 to 12:00 something anyway the
[1:29:31] originates down in Dallas Texas trying
[1:29:33] to minds in charge of all this and it's
[1:29:35] um it's going out and people are
[1:29:38] listening Americans are going to
[1:29:40] Canadians it up and a half bill the
[1:29:42] night listen to gospel but they do and
[1:29:45] it goes into prisons goes a lot of
[1:29:47] places and we can't go and some of the
[1:29:50] fruit of it I was you know gonna tell
[1:29:53] you this later but woman shot now
[1:29:55] there's a very famous person that was
[1:29:59] tried in New York in February and sent
[1:30:02] to prison out in Colorado they're all
[1:30:03] aware that well this man heard the
[1:30:05] gospel in prison and he liked what he
[1:30:10] heard
[1:30:10] and so he sat down word through his
[1:30:13] people he said hey let's see if there's
[1:30:15] some literature I want to read more
[1:30:16] about this so they sent him the book of
[1:30:18] the life story and it's got the drawing
[1:30:21] on the front Wow he believed it likes it
[1:30:24] he said you tell those people we need
[1:30:27] 10,000 copies for my people because he
[1:30:30] had before he went to jail he had 10,000
[1:30:33] people they were armed and their job is
[1:30:35] to bring the drugs from the growers to
[1:30:37] the consumers the reason there's the
[1:30:39] drug problem is because there's
[1:30:41] consumers they've got I have they'll
[1:30:43] give me any money for that and so these
[1:30:46] people are just in business they're
[1:30:47] businessmen bring it across well we
[1:30:52] didn't have no 10,000 copy so we give
[1:30:53] him a memory stick and they go and print
[1:30:57] it with their money spend it on
[1:30:59] something good and they've printed other
[1:31:01] things the man is a believer he was
[1:31:05] raised in the Apostolic Church when he
[1:31:07] was young his mother was a figure in
[1:31:10] that an apostolic church she was a
[1:31:12] believer and so his mother's been
[1:31:15] baptized his wife been baptized his
[1:31:18] father-in-law's been baptized and he
[1:31:21] said as if they ever give me a little
[1:31:23] liberty why don't you guys come baptize
[1:31:25] her you've heard the name El Chapo well
[1:31:31] that's him he's a whole lot smarter than
[1:31:34] Al Capone ever was but he's just a
[1:31:38] businessman but he's on vacation now in
[1:31:41] Colorado
[1:31:45] but it's all because of the preaching of
[1:31:47] the gospel okay that's gonna do though
[1:31:50] what time I got here anybody in hurry to
[1:31:54] go Oh
[1:31:57] burl 8:30 okay chapter three and four
[1:32:00] kind of go together
[1:32:01] it's a five-part drama the power in the
[1:32:05] name of Jesus Jesus means Jehovah is
[1:32:08] salvation and we're not going to go
[1:32:11] through all of this but Act one of this
[1:32:14] five-part drama is verses 1 through 11
[1:32:16] of chapter 3 it records the healing of
[1:32:20] the lame man at the gate beautiful
[1:32:22] now this gate is the golden gate it's
[1:32:25] the eastern gate it's been sealed up
[1:32:27] since 1541 in an effort by the non-jews
[1:32:31] at that time to prevent the Messiah from
[1:32:34] arriving like that's gonna stop God you
[1:32:36] know so Peter and John they went up to
[1:32:39] the temple to pray at the appointed time
[1:32:41] they went you know they believers arrive
[1:32:43] on time so they're up there at 3 p.m.
[1:32:47] and verse 2 and a certain man lame from
[1:32:51] his mother's womb was carried when they
[1:32:53] laid daily at the gate of the temple
[1:32:55] which is called beautiful to ask for
[1:32:57] money of them that entered into the
[1:32:59] temple now this man was born wrong like
[1:33:02] we would say we don't see that too much
[1:33:04] today but I have seen people that like
[1:33:06] brother of Al used to say if they're
[1:33:08] like spaghetti they had no muscle they
[1:33:10] just they're just there and that was one
[1:33:12] of them so they taking up every day he
[1:33:14] looks pitiful people giving him money
[1:33:16] so when this man saw Peter and John
[1:33:19] about to go into the temple he asked
[1:33:21] them for alms her money and Peter
[1:33:23] looking at any of you know fasting his
[1:33:25] eyes upon him said look on us so he pays
[1:33:31] attention expecting to receive something
[1:33:34] from them and Peter says we don't have
[1:33:37] any silver gold but what we do have
[1:33:39] we're going to give you in the name of
[1:33:41] Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[1:33:43] walk
[1:33:45] he didn't just stand there and wait for
[1:33:47] the miracle he reached down and got him
[1:33:49] by the hand lifted him up and
[1:33:52] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:33:54] received strength
[1:33:55] he's never walked he's never had any
[1:33:57] muscle he has no
[1:33:58] idea of how to walk all of us from
[1:34:00] instant instant miracle
[1:34:02] now he's leaping up standing up walking
[1:34:05] went into it them to the temple walking
[1:34:08] and leaping praising God and all the
[1:34:10] people which knew about this guy for
[1:34:12] years saw that and that he was walking
[1:34:16] and praising God and they knew that it
[1:34:19] was him which had been sitting at the
[1:34:20] gate they were filled with Wonder in
[1:34:24] amazement at what had happened well yeah
[1:34:28] very amazed
[1:34:30] so that's part 1 1 a is where they're
[1:34:34] greatly wondering so when Peter saw that
[1:34:37] he had their full attention he preached
[1:34:39] a sermon number 2 and this is just a
[1:34:42] street meeting it's out in the open
[1:34:43] they're not inside the temple the temple
[1:34:45] is very small that's where the priest
[1:34:47] goes in now people out in the courtyard
[1:34:48] you know so they're out there in this
[1:34:50] courtyard who knows how many people are
[1:34:51] out there and so part two of the drama
[1:34:55] is where Peters sermon identifies Jesus
[1:34:57] with the I M of Israel's history because
[1:35:01] see they excuse me he could have titled
[1:35:03] it covenants will be fulfilled there's
[1:35:07] all these promises but they had to
[1:35:08] almost proved of the people this is the
[1:35:10] fulfillment everybody didn't understand
[1:35:12] that you know so verse 12 through 26 he
[1:35:17] he's preaching to them identifying Jesus
[1:35:20] as the I M of Israel's history and so it
[1:35:26] goes on because C prophets spoke words
[1:35:31] those words had to be fulfilled the
[1:35:33] manner smaller there will be a
[1:35:34] fulfillment and so in chapter 3 verse 12
[1:35:40] we've got here and when Peter saw it he
[1:35:42] answered to the people hey you men of
[1:35:44] Israel why are you marveled with this or
[1:35:47] why are you looking on me as though we
[1:35:49] had done something you know by our
[1:35:50] holiness
[1:35:51] verse 13 the God of Abraham and Isaac
[1:35:54] and Jacob the god of Our Fathers which
[1:35:57] glorified His Son Jesus and see that he
[1:35:59] had to put it in there he could just
[1:36:01] leave it alone you know that God did
[1:36:03] sure worship glorified His Son Jesus
[1:36:04] whom you all delivered up and denied him
[1:36:08] in the presence of Pilate when he was
[1:36:10] determined to let him go but
[1:36:12] you denied the holy one the just and
[1:36:15] desired a murderer to be granted unto
[1:36:17] you and killed the Prince of life whom
[1:36:20] God hath raised from the dead they
[1:36:22] couldn't handle that either we are the
[1:36:24] witnesses of that and his name through
[1:36:28] faith in his name had made this man
[1:36:31] strong tell me you now see the faith
[1:36:35] which is by him has given him his
[1:36:37] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[1:36:40] all and now brethren I wot that means
[1:36:44] I'm sure that through ignorance she did
[1:36:46] it as also did your father's but those
[1:36:50] things which God before had showed by
[1:36:52] the mouth of his holy prophets that
[1:36:54] Christ should suffer he hath so
[1:36:57] fulfilled in other words it's coming to
[1:36:59] pass right before your eyes
[1:37:00] all this was spoken back here it's it's
[1:37:03] going on right now in real time you know
[1:37:06] so prophet said it here's the
[1:37:08] fulfillment see salvation is by faith in
[1:37:12] the name of Jesus Christ repent you
[1:37:16] therefore and be converted that your
[1:37:18] sins may be blotted out when the times
[1:37:20] of refreshing shall come from the
[1:37:22] presence of the Lord and he shall send
[1:37:24] Jesus Christ which before was preached
[1:37:27] unto you he's looking at the future whom
[1:37:30] the heaven must receive or it is like in
[1:37:32] the Spanish Bible retained keep back
[1:37:34] until the times of restitution of all
[1:37:37] things which God has spoken by the mouth
[1:37:38] of his holy prophets since the world
[1:37:40] began
[1:37:41] okay so here's here we are in this
[1:37:44] picture we're part of this restoration
[1:37:45] you see we're part of the same program
[1:37:48] and all he's waiting for is for people
[1:37:50] to repent
[1:37:50] get with the program understand what's
[1:37:52] God's doing and receive him so when we
[1:37:58] look at the bigger picture oh that's how
[1:38:01] it works yeah it's not your little
[1:38:02] narrow way of seeing things you see and
[1:38:05] where we've been turned back to the
[1:38:07] original we understand these things and
[1:38:09] so from verse 24 all the prophets from
[1:38:15] Samuel and those that follow after as
[1:38:17] many have spoken have likewise foretold
[1:38:19] of these things y'all just don't know
[1:38:21] your Bible your children of the prophets
[1:38:24] and the Covenant which God made
[1:38:26] with your father's sitting under Abraham
[1:38:28] and in thy seed shall all the Kindred's
[1:38:30] of the earth be blessed
[1:38:32] unto you first God having raised up his
[1:38:35] sons Jesus sent him to bless you in
[1:38:37] turning every one of you from his
[1:38:40] iniquities well God has made a way you
[1:38:45] just gotta pay attention so simple now
[1:38:48] that takes us through part 2 of this
[1:38:50] five-part series that we're talking
[1:38:52] about but if you'll notice here where he
[1:38:56] says God sent him to you now back in and
[1:38:59] I think it's in Matthew 10 somewhere
[1:39:01] Jesus said only go to the house of
[1:39:03] Israel yet they're only dealing with
[1:39:05] with Jewish believers here sitting has
[1:39:07] it we're not gonna not gonna get
[1:39:09] Gentiles for a while so in in chapter 4
[1:39:14] we have an as they spake under the
[1:39:16] people the priests and the captain of
[1:39:19] the temple the Sadducees came upon them
[1:39:20] in other words they came over to
[1:39:21] investigate what is going on here
[1:39:24] what's all this confusion you all think
[1:39:27] you're religious you bunch of ignorant
[1:39:28] fishermen being grieved ah they're upset
[1:39:32] that they taught the people and preached
[1:39:34] through Jesus the resurrection from the
[1:39:36] dead oh we got a problem
[1:39:39] these guys are talking about
[1:39:40] resurrection we don't believe in
[1:39:42] resurrection and and they laid hands on
[1:39:47] that's a nice way of saying they grabbed
[1:39:48] him and put him in jail till the next
[1:39:51] day before it was already you know
[1:39:53] sundown okay howbeit many of them which
[1:39:58] heard the word believed and the number
[1:40:00] of the men only was about 5,000 and they
[1:40:04] didn't have microphones so they had to
[1:40:06] be quiet when their preaching is
[1:40:07] everybody could hear that's just the man
[1:40:10] or 5,000 big crowd might even 10,000
[1:40:13] people just just preaching that little
[1:40:16] sermon sermon number two many believed
[1:40:20] okay so they spent the night in jail
[1:40:25] because they preached the truth to a
[1:40:27] very large crowd verse 5 and it came to
[1:40:31] pass in the morning that their rulers
[1:40:33] and elders and scribes and Anna's the
[1:40:35] high priests and all these people
[1:40:38] the high priest verse seven and when
[1:40:41] they had sent and when they had set them
[1:40:43] in the midst in other words they brought
[1:40:44] these two preachers in hey but what
[1:40:47] power what name have you guys done this
[1:40:50] huh well you don't ask a preacher a
[1:40:55] question unless you got qala listen you
[1:40:58] know they're not gonna give you a small
[1:40:59] answer so Peters defense starts in verse
[1:41:03] nine if we this day be examined of the
[1:41:07] good deed done to this impotent man by
[1:41:09] what means he's made whole be it known
[1:41:11] unto you all and to all the people of
[1:41:14] Israel in other words you know hey
[1:41:15] listen up it's by the name of Jesus
[1:41:19] Christ of Nazareth whom you all
[1:41:21] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[1:41:23] they tell you all but it's the truth
[1:41:26] even by him that this man stand here
[1:41:29] whole before you this is the stone which
[1:41:33] has said it not by you builders which
[1:41:34] has become the head of the corner
[1:41:36] neither is there salvation in any other
[1:41:39] for there's none other name under heaven
[1:41:41] given among men whereby we must be saved
[1:41:44] so not in the name of Peter not a name
[1:41:51] of any of these other guys here
[1:41:52] preaching the name of Jesus Christ he
[1:41:56] never gave up an opportunity to put it
[1:41:59] on him because they did it well who else
[1:42:02] crucified him it was them as the
[1:42:03] religious people so part four thirteen
[1:42:07] through twenty two and when they saw the
[1:42:09] boldness of Peter this guy's pretty
[1:42:11] pretty bold and John and knew that they
[1:42:15] were unlearned and ignorant not only
[1:42:18] they did not know anything they were
[1:42:20] ignorant how were they coming up with
[1:42:22] all this stuff they marveled and they
[1:42:25] had to take knowledge that they had been
[1:42:27] with Jesus and and be holding the man
[1:42:34] which was healed standing on them they
[1:42:37] could not send it they didn't they
[1:42:38] weren't arguing whether the guy was
[1:42:39] healed or not he's healed but when they
[1:42:42] cut commanded them to go aside out of
[1:42:44] the council they conferred among
[1:42:46] themselves so y'all will stand outside
[1:42:48] we're gonna have a little powwow here
[1:42:50] and we're gonna decide what to do with
[1:42:51] you guys because this is we can't have
[1:42:53] this going on as this is earlier this is
[1:42:55] changing everything you know and well
[1:43:00] shall we do to these guys for indeed a
[1:43:02] notable miracle has been done and here
[1:43:05] he is you know we can't deny that verse
[1:43:07] 17 but then it spread no further among
[1:43:09] the people let's threaten them that they
[1:43:12] speak henceforth to no man in this name
[1:43:15] there it is again the name of Jesus
[1:43:18] Christ has power it's not just anything
[1:43:21] and they call them commanded them not
[1:43:24] speak or teach in the name of Jesus but
[1:43:27] Peter you know he had a bit of a mouth
[1:43:29] probably he just couldn't keep quiet you
[1:43:30] know whether it be right in the sight of
[1:43:33] God to hearken unto you more than God
[1:43:36] well you'll be the judge of that we can
[1:43:39] only speak that which we've seen and
[1:43:40] heard so when they had further and
[1:43:43] threatened dama
[1:43:44] they let him go and they had no reason
[1:43:48] to punish him because of the people aha
[1:43:52] see because the people they knew that
[1:43:54] they made their life difficult all these
[1:43:56] I mean just in that one meeting was over
[1:43:58] 5,000 people there's another 3,000 he
[1:44:00] got baptized so they had all these
[1:44:02] people believing they want get stoned so
[1:44:04] they had to be real careful how they
[1:44:06] went about this for all men glorified
[1:44:09] God for that which was done for the man
[1:44:12] was above 40 years old he'd been laying
[1:44:14] the gate for 40 years and all of a
[1:44:16] sudden he's walking you know so they
[1:44:22] they knew what they were doing they were
[1:44:24] led by the Holy Ghost
[1:44:25] so part 5 is the twenty three three
[1:44:29] thirty is the testimony service okay so
[1:44:32] we went through all these trials and and
[1:44:34] they beat us up threatened us and so
[1:44:36] forth and verse 23 they went to their
[1:44:40] own companies went back to their people
[1:44:41] and reported all the chief priests and
[1:44:43] elders had said unto them here's what
[1:44:45] they said is what they did and when the
[1:44:48] people heard that they lifted up their
[1:44:49] voice to God with one Accord Lord thou
[1:44:51] art God thou has made heaven and earth
[1:44:53] and so far they go through this long
[1:44:55] prayer and they're so happy and they're
[1:44:58] so so blessed that God sent an
[1:45:01] earthquake yeah
[1:45:03] verse 30 31 and when they had prayed the
[1:45:07] place was shaken where they were
[1:45:08] assembled together and they were all
[1:45:10] filled all the ghosts and they spake the
[1:45:12] Word of God with boldness so 32 to 37 is
[1:45:18] where they shared everything it was due
[1:45:22] to the time of persecution and it was
[1:45:24] voluntary and it was only in Jerusalem
[1:45:27] now brother mem says in 1955 he says as
[1:45:34] Moses went with the judgment stick
[1:45:36] beforehand that same stick tonight to
[1:45:38] the churches Jesus Christ
[1:45:39] if those Egyptians could ever got that
[1:45:41] little stick out of Moses hands they
[1:45:44] would have had him whipped and when the
[1:45:47] devil could never get the deity out of
[1:45:48] the name is Jesus Christ he's got the
[1:45:49] church whipped and that's going on right
[1:45:52] now in pulpits in our country where
[1:45:56] they're trying to prove that Jesus was
[1:45:58] only your brother really yeah Jesus
[1:46:01] wasn't God well I'm sorry if prophet
[1:46:04] said he was so we have to stay balanced
[1:46:07] put things where they belong
[1:46:09] doesn't matter who it hurts you know
[1:46:13] Paul wrote in Philippians 2 that at the
[1:46:16] name of Jesus every knee should bow yeah
[1:46:19] all the Muhammadans all the ices all
[1:46:21] those people are on a bow one day things
[1:46:24] in heaven earth things under the earth
[1:46:25] and that every tongue should confess
[1:46:27] that Jesus Christ is Lord so we're on
[1:46:31] the winning side just stay with it don't
[1:46:34] don't get off the path you know maybe
[1:46:40] we'll go to one more chapter I'll be
[1:46:41] okay
[1:46:43] nobody double-parked right we're okay
[1:46:46] let's check so brother brems says in
[1:46:52] 1964 if things go on the way they are
[1:46:55] now whatever he was focusing on I don't
[1:46:57] know
[1:46:58] he said if things go on the way they are
[1:46:59] now in 50 years we'll be total insanity
[1:47:02] well guess what that was about five
[1:47:05] years ago where that was fulfilled so
[1:47:07] when you see all these things happening
[1:47:09] it's because people are insane the devil
[1:47:13] feeds him through the television and
[1:47:15] through here that's worse than
[1:47:17] television
[1:47:18] so the devil well he's on the rampage he
[1:47:22] knows what he's doing and he knows how
[1:47:23] much he's he knows better than we do how
[1:47:25] much time he's got left so it's total
[1:47:28] insanity right so when we look at
[1:47:32] chapter four
[1:47:34] I mean Chapter five we look back in
[1:47:36] chapter four back in 33 and 34 they were
[1:47:40] having things in common 34 neither was
[1:47:45] there any among them it'll act as many
[1:47:48] it was had possessors of land they sold
[1:47:50] them brought them to the prices to the
[1:47:52] things that were sold and so forth
[1:47:54] so there was unity there was peace they
[1:47:56] cared for one another greatly the one
[1:47:58] just had god bless you didn't know they
[1:48:00] took him to eat no they they helped each
[1:48:01] other love about it and so there are no
[1:48:04] needs amongst the believers there was no
[1:48:06] competition there was no looking down on
[1:48:08] anybody
[1:48:08] those that had something they sold it
[1:48:10] and they brought it proceeds to the
[1:48:12] Apostles and they distribute it fairly
[1:48:15] so they had all things in common okay
[1:48:19] this was simply a model and it's an
[1:48:25] ideal that is advocated by communism and
[1:48:28] socialism but it's never been achieved
[1:48:30] okay there's no way to make it even
[1:48:33] across the board
[1:48:34] these early believers we're not setting
[1:48:36] up an economic system they were simply
[1:48:38] responding to each other in gracious
[1:48:40] Christian living okay and compassion and
[1:48:45] they were demonstrating the love of God
[1:48:47] that's just in words everything was
[1:48:49] running smoothly but unfortunately are
[1:48:53] not all believers in New Testament times
[1:48:56] shared the same godly concerns 5:1 but a
[1:49:01] certain man named ananias and his lovely
[1:49:04] wife sapphire you notice that nobody
[1:49:05] ever calls her little girl Sapphira
[1:49:07] bible name what's problem they sold a
[1:49:12] possession and they kept back a little
[1:49:14] part of it you know for hard times his
[1:49:16] wife also being privy she understood she
[1:49:18] green and they brought a certain part
[1:49:20] and laid it at the Apostles feet they
[1:49:23] look good on the outside right and Peter
[1:49:25] said Ananias why has Satan filled your
[1:49:28] heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and keep
[1:49:34] back part of the price why was yours hey
[1:49:38] do what you want after it was sold was
[1:49:40] not your own power why hast thou
[1:49:42] conceived this thing an EIN heart and
[1:49:44] there has not lied to man but to God and
[1:49:49] when Ananias heard these things he fell
[1:49:51] down dead finished
[1:49:55] nobody rushed up to pray for him great
[1:49:57] fear come on Paul those that heard these
[1:49:59] things and the young man rose up they
[1:50:01] wound him up carried about and buried
[1:50:02] him finished about three hours later
[1:50:05] here comes lovely so far not knowing
[1:50:09] what happened Oh wasn't she concerned
[1:50:11] where's my man three hours you know and
[1:50:15] and Peter said tell me he sold the land
[1:50:19] for so much oh yeah yeah that's right
[1:50:21] verse nine and Peter said how is it that
[1:50:24] she have agreed together to tempt the
[1:50:26] Spirit of the Lord behold the feet of
[1:50:28] them which I buried your husband are at
[1:50:29] the door and they're going to carry you
[1:50:31] out of here and she fell down dead and
[1:50:34] the young man wound up took her out and
[1:50:36] buried her and great fear came upon all
[1:50:38] the church and upon as many as heard
[1:50:40] these things now it wasn't so much that
[1:50:46] they didn't turn it all in because God
[1:50:48] wasn't concerned about their cash but
[1:50:50] they lied see the sin was that they lied
[1:50:53] they acted like what yells it it wasn't
[1:50:55] it who knows how much they kept back you
[1:50:58] know and so they they tried to deceive
[1:51:01] the servants of God and thereby God
[1:51:03] Himself back in verse 34 through 37 in
[1:51:08] chapter four it they brought the entire
[1:51:09] amount
[1:51:10] that's what they promised and this man
[1:51:13] in verse 36 his original name was Joseph
[1:51:16] but they give him a nickname Barnabas
[1:51:19] which means son of encouragement we'll
[1:51:22] see more about him Lord well in Chapter
[1:51:23] 9 so these two they sneaked apart to
[1:51:27] themselves for hard times you know
[1:51:29] making it look like this was the total
[1:51:31] amount so they looked good on the
[1:51:33] outside but on the inside there were
[1:51:35] cheats now this whole thing of living in
[1:51:39] common that we covered a couple times
[1:51:40] here it was a historical event it's not
[1:51:43] a doctrine we don't find that as a
[1:51:46] mandate for believers anywhere there
[1:51:48] have been those who have tried to make
[1:51:49] it work and it is failed every time you
[1:51:53] mainly to human greed and lack of the
[1:51:57] Holy Ghost where the RAM told some dear
[1:51:59] friends of mine it will not work sister
[1:52:02] Ruth Ozzy was part of that group out
[1:52:04] there
[1:52:05] verse 11 fear came upon the believers
[1:52:08] they they perked up you know they paid
[1:52:09] attention they were not afraid like in
[1:52:11] danger but much greater respect for
[1:52:14] God's holiness and his moral law was
[1:52:18] going on so the fact is no one is
[1:52:20] perfect we don't have a you know truth
[1:52:23] detector out here okay you can come in
[1:52:24] you can't come in no one's perfect
[1:52:26] God does forgive but when you're given
[1:52:29] the chance to confess it's very
[1:52:31] important to confess the truth and not
[1:52:33] lie like these to make believers you
[1:52:35] know so we're in chapter 5 and verse 12
[1:52:39] through 16 is the miracle ministry by
[1:52:41] the hands of the Apostles and attracted
[1:52:44] opposite responses there was the
[1:52:46] unbelievers and the make believers don't
[1:52:48] do mess with them leave him alone stay
[1:52:50] away but the believers flock to the
[1:52:52] meetings they brought the signif elected
[1:52:54] from other villages in verse 16 around
[1:52:59] about Jerusalem bringing sick folks and
[1:53:01] with them which were vexed with evil
[1:53:04] unclean spirits and they were healed
[1:53:06] every one so there was great deliverance
[1:53:11] so the first persecution was over here
[1:53:14] in chapter 4 where the disciples spent
[1:53:16] one night in jail remember them because
[1:53:18] the equipment was he'll spent one night
[1:53:21] in prison
[1:53:22] and then in verse 18 you know they let
[1:53:26] it after they threatened them go just
[1:53:28] don't just don't speak the name of Jesus
[1:53:30] okay and then they had the great meeting
[1:53:34] with the earthquake and so forth and now
[1:53:35] in Chapter five
[1:53:36] is the second persecution or 17 then the
[1:53:41] high priest rose up now here all these
[1:53:43] people it says it healed everyone
[1:53:44] they're having great success great
[1:53:47] things are happening got these two dead
[1:53:49] make believers gay they're buried and
[1:53:51] then we have this great success going on
[1:53:52] from 12 to 16 then the high priest who
[1:53:57] knew his Bible perfectly rose up on all
[1:53:59] of them they're whipped with him all the
[1:54:01] Sadducees they were filled with
[1:54:03] indignation they should have been happy
[1:54:05] that prophets words were being fulfilled
[1:54:07] in their lifetime
[1:54:09] no they're mad they're upset very upset
[1:54:12] now the Sadducees it's a Jewish
[1:54:17] denomination that denied angels denied
[1:54:20] miracles resurrection and supernatural
[1:54:24] if you take all that all the way you got
[1:54:26] dead letter you got nothing you know and
[1:54:29] so in verse 18 they took him straight to
[1:54:32] jail yeah put him in prison like that's
[1:54:36] gonna solve something verse 19 but the
[1:54:39] angel of the Lord by night opened the
[1:54:41] prison door and brought them forth and
[1:54:43] said go over there to the temple preach
[1:54:47] the words of life to the people okay and
[1:54:52] so they go over there they have an early
[1:54:54] church you know and verse 21 and when
[1:54:57] they heard that they entered in Temple
[1:54:59] mourning that taught them but the high
[1:55:02] priest came and then his whole crowd and
[1:55:04] got the council together all these
[1:55:07] people and sent some people oh hey go
[1:55:10] get those guys we're gonna take care of
[1:55:12] business so they got all together and of
[1:55:15] course in verse 22 they came back
[1:55:17] empty-handed hey we saw the prison it
[1:55:19] was all locked up but prisoners weren't
[1:55:23] there and you know it's looking bad
[1:55:26] except something something's going on
[1:55:29] here
[1:55:29] so the verse 24 they're really upset
[1:55:33] they doubted them weren't who this would
[1:55:36] grow if we don't take care that's just
[1:55:38] going to get out of hand you know we've
[1:55:41] got to investigate this in verse 25 they
[1:55:44] got the real news flash behold those
[1:55:47] guys that you put in prison
[1:55:49] throw whether it's a temple teaching the
[1:55:51] people oh we thought was gonna put this
[1:55:54] fire out how's this gonna have this
[1:55:56] happen you know so they were arrested
[1:55:58] nicely uh-huh
[1:55:59] the captain the officers brought them
[1:56:01] without violence let's just come with us
[1:56:04] you know just come with us we got to
[1:56:06] talk cuz all these people are watching
[1:56:08] all these believers are out here you
[1:56:10] know and they didn't wanna get stoned
[1:56:14] they this crowd is growing daily you
[1:56:19] know because if you'll remember in know
[1:56:22] in Chapter two three thousand souls
[1:56:27] ratted Wow in verse 47 out of the church
[1:56:31] daily such as should be saved so we
[1:56:33] don't know how many verse 4 of chapter
[1:56:35] four five thousand men and verse 14 of
[1:56:40] chapter five the believers were the more
[1:56:42] added to the Lord multitudes of men and
[1:56:44] women so God's moving things are
[1:56:47] happening you know and verse 16 they're
[1:56:49] healed everyone so with the religious
[1:56:52] leaders were taking notice
[1:56:53] here's the word coming to life in these
[1:56:55] people they're happy they got victorious
[1:56:58] lives but these church leaders are upset
[1:57:01] you know they had their their organized
[1:57:03] religion it's got to happen this way the
[1:57:05] way we say no you're stupid you don't
[1:57:07] have it you don't really know how to
[1:57:08] read will tell you how to do it will
[1:57:10] tell you when to listen what to do it's
[1:57:13] organized religion and so the people are
[1:57:16] happy but these guys are upset so we're
[1:57:20] at verse 28 of chapter 5 didn't only
[1:57:24] straightly command you that you should
[1:57:26] not teach in this name you're feeling
[1:57:30] Jerusalem with this doctrine and you
[1:57:32] intend to bring this man's blood upon us
[1:57:34] well who else we're not the ones that
[1:57:37] put him on the cross it's you guys you
[1:57:39] know then Peter said in the Apostles we
[1:57:44] ought to obey God rather than man
[1:57:46] the god of Our Fathers raised up Jesus
[1:57:49] whom you guys slew and hanged on a tree
[1:57:51] him has God exalted with his room with
[1:57:55] his right hand to be the Prince and
[1:57:56] Savior for to give repentance to Israel
[1:57:59] all of you forgiveness of sins and we
[1:58:02] are his witnesses of these things and so
[1:58:04] is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath
[1:58:07] given to them that obey Him and it's the
[1:58:09] only place you're gonna find in the
[1:58:10] Bible he gives all he goes to those that
[1:58:12] obey Him very simple so the message was
[1:58:17] positive it was factual you know he was
[1:58:20] just speaking truth it was all about
[1:58:23] God's plan and power and Peter spoke it
[1:58:27] with love you know he did not slander
[1:58:30] and show disrespect to the superiors
[1:58:32] there was not they weren't arrogant with
[1:58:34] the message of Christ and if you listen
[1:58:36] closely to brother Branham you'll never
[1:58:38] find where he is throwing rocks that
[1:58:41] people don't see it exactly his way he
[1:58:44] just preached the truth you never found
[1:58:46] him arrogant on any tape or blasting
[1:58:49] people so when they heard this mini
[1:58:51] sermon here by Peter they wanted to kill
[1:58:56] him on the spot yeah I mean they were
[1:58:59] they were upset when they heard that
[1:59:02] they were cut to the heart and took
[1:59:05] counsel to slay him we got to get this
[1:59:07] guy you know they're bad yeah let's see
[1:59:11] what brother Alonzo says over here in
[1:59:13] 6:30 we're going at 5:33
[1:59:15] I've got a note here for some reason
[1:59:21] chapter 5 and verse 33 when they heard
[1:59:25] these words they were enraged and
[1:59:27] thought to murder the Apostles these
[1:59:31] same words a little more color to it
[1:59:32] we've got to get rid of these people
[1:59:35] now there's thousands of believers but
[1:59:36] these are the these are the ones that
[1:59:37] are guilty so then we have brother
[1:59:41] Gamaliel the great teacher he got up hey
[1:59:43] take the apostles outside we gotta have
[1:59:46] a conference here he says you all might
[1:59:48] want to be careful verse 36 he says here
[1:59:58] before these days just a while ago we
[2:00:00] had this guy named Theo Dias boasting to
[2:00:03] be somebody and I'm about four hundred
[2:00:05] men joined themselves to it and when he
[2:00:07] was killed
[2:00:08] those that obeyed him scattered the
[2:00:11] whole thing came to zero and then we got
[2:00:13] the guy named Judas of Galilee in the
[2:00:15] days of the taxing and he carried a
[2:00:19] bunch of people away also perished the
[2:00:21] whole thing came to zero okay so he's
[2:00:24] reminding of what just happened just a
[2:00:25] few years ago
[2:00:26] examples of fake leaders and how it all
[2:00:29] came to nothing and now I say refrain
[2:00:33] from these men leave them alone for if
[2:00:36] this council this whole business is a
[2:00:38] work of man it'll come to zero don't
[2:00:40] problem don't worry about it but if it
[2:00:42] be of God you're not gonna overthrow it
[2:00:45] and you might be fighting against God in
[2:00:48] other words it's none of your business
[2:00:49] you know don't worry about it
[2:00:54] so when something's not going to cording
[2:00:57] to your narrow understanding or your
[2:01:00] great revelation remember God's still in
[2:01:04] charge over here in the last chapter of
[2:01:08] John we had a very good example in 21
[2:01:13] and 20 we have Peter turning about see
[2:01:17] at the disciple whom Jesus loved
[2:01:19] following which also leaned on his
[2:01:21] breast at supper and said Lord this is
[2:01:27] John is asking the Lord at the supper
[2:01:28] which is either the betrayeth II and
[2:01:30] Peter seeing him say it to Jesus Lord
[2:01:34] what about the sky jesus said hey Peter
[2:01:37] if I will that he tarry until I come
[2:01:40] what's it to you follow you me in other
[2:01:44] words Peter sending your business you
[2:01:46] don't have to figure everything out
[2:01:47] leave it alone you know so God doesn't
[2:01:50] need our opinions our little you know
[2:01:52] chicken brain ideas and how things work
[2:01:54] our judgments he's the judge he will
[2:01:58] work it out you know so they agreed over
[2:02:01] here you know in these verses and okay
[2:02:04] if we have two good meal you're the
[2:02:05] smart guy you might have something on
[2:02:06] there and now they call the believers in
[2:02:09] they beat him up a little bit
[2:02:10] and they sent him on their way but in
[2:02:12] verse 40 says here they beat him up and
[2:02:15] commanded that they should not speak in
[2:02:17] the name of Jesus and they let him go so
[2:02:21] friends the anti spirit was alive there
[2:02:24] and it's alive now just whatever you
[2:02:28] don't mention the name and there's all
[2:02:31] kinds of things going on under the
[2:02:33] umbrella of Malachi 4 that are not
[2:02:35] pointing the people to Jesus Christ to
[2:02:38] themselves - some big deal no just get
[2:02:41] back to the original it's not hard to do
[2:02:45] it you see and so in 41 they left the
[2:02:48] core they're rejoicing that they could
[2:02:50] be counted worthy to suffer some
[2:02:52] dishonor on account of the mighty name
[2:02:54] of Jesus Christ they weren't you know
[2:02:57] what are we gonna do now oh no they were
[2:03:00] happy I think they could be you know
[2:03:03] suffer for his namesake the verse 42 and
[2:03:07] daily in the temple in every house they
[2:03:09] ceased not to teach and preach Jesus
[2:03:12] Christ
[2:03:13] so just in review of these five chapters
[2:03:16] we'll stop there for the ninth but these
[2:03:19] people had trials this was not an easy
[2:03:21] road you know and they had relatives
[2:03:25] like we have they were preaching to
[2:03:27] mixed multitudes and only in heaven well
[2:03:31] they're not being make believers and
[2:03:32] unbelievers we're gonna have to put up
[2:03:34] with them here because they're here you
[2:03:36] see some I'm landed in prison they were
[2:03:40] persecuted for using the name of Jesus
[2:03:42] Christ but they moved out into the deep
[2:03:45] waters of Revelation they faced
[2:03:48] persecution and we're gonna face
[2:03:50] persecutions things things are gonna
[2:03:51] happen it's not gonna because you busted
[2:03:53] a fingernail you know or toenail but
[2:03:57] genuinely suffer for the name of Jesus
[2:04:00] Christ so let me just leave you with one
[2:04:03] testimony that we know is real when
[2:04:09] missionaries were up in the mountains of
[2:04:11] Mexico they were called up there by
[2:04:13] invitation to preach to a little
[2:04:15] Pentecostal church but besides that they
[2:04:21] ran into some other people
[2:04:24] up there not knowing that this is a
[2:04:26] hotbed for the cartel people the
[2:04:31] government doesn't go there nobody goes
[2:04:32] up there but somehow these three guys
[2:04:35] went up in an old beat-up Toyota car
[2:04:37] that one of them had they get up there
[2:04:39] and they were there several days they
[2:04:46] end up baptizing the the mother of you
[2:04:48] know the big man and this other guy he
[2:04:52] comes up and he says hey yeah I believe
[2:04:53] what Schaller teaching him so he can I
[2:04:55] have your Bible well you know somebody
[2:04:58] asks you for your Bible what you can do
[2:04:59] no you can't have it so he gives them
[2:05:01] the Bible
[2:05:01] well he's turned up a few other times

[2:05:07] man was baptized he has baptized himself

[2:05:14] so he's out there doing his little work
[2:05:16] the care of us looking for him they
[2:05:18] can't find him anyway so when they leave
[2:05:22] this area they got the little car and
[2:05:24] they're coming down the mountain well
[2:05:25] down the road there's another bunch of
[2:05:28] people that hate those people and so
[2:05:31] you're coming from there you must be one
[2:05:32] of them anyway they stopped him and of
[2:05:36] course they saw they were Christian see
[2:05:38] I had nothing no drugs no nothing but
[2:05:41] they were mad because they had been up
[2:05:42] there so here's the here's they have the
[2:05:45] victory here you get down here here's
[2:05:47] the other twin you know shows up with a
[2:05:49] problem

[2:06:19] rejoicing because they had been chosen
[2:06:22] to to suffer for his namesake the same
[2:06:25] thing that's going on here so the book
[2:06:27] is still being written see it's still
[2:06:29] gonna

[2:06:32] think it's soon but we're gonna stay
[2:06:36] faithful see these are our brothers and
[2:06:39] sisters this is our family this work

[2:06:44] of it so come back tomorrow night we'll
[2:06:47] carry on god bless you
[2:06:49] the journal I found out a long time ago
[2:06:53] it's better to leave people kind of
[2:06:54] hungry thank you
[2:06:56] stuff I might come back thank you very
[2:07:00] much amen praise the Lord
[2:07:12] I've got one of these in fact when I
[2:07:16] heard of jord the gorge coming I was
[2:07:19] thinking about bringing my my own level
[2:07:21] or put it but and I put it on the pulpit
[2:07:23] here it would be a bit bigger a man oh
[2:07:28] you got a big one amen maybe for a
[2:07:33] bigger Church well I think I want to
[2:07:37] thank the Lord for the word and brother
[2:07:40] again proving that the prophet of God
[2:07:42] preached in the going forth of the seven
[2:07:44] seals and the just think the first
[2:07:47] sermon he preached was God hidden and
[2:07:49] God revealed in simplicity a man why
[2:07:52] because he knew then approaching the
[2:07:53] seven seals and as our Brotherhood was
[2:07:56] at the revelation here tonight
[2:07:58] concerning approaching the message a
[2:08:00] crook approaching the book of Acts that
[2:08:03] we're going to look at this we're gonna
[2:08:04] look at this and make it bigger than
[2:08:06] what it is or smaller than what it is
[2:08:07] but brother if we can only just take it
[2:08:10] the way our brother preaches tonight a
[2:08:11] bad brother it's not it's not going
[2:08:14] bigger than they're bigger they're
[2:08:15] smaller smaller no it was God in his in
[2:08:20] his apostle's it was God in His
[2:08:22] disciples I like what he brought oak and
[2:08:24] he concerning Lukey see he wasn't an
[2:08:25] apostle he was the disciple and a
[2:08:27] disciple was a follower a man and
[2:08:30] brother that's what that's what God's
[2:08:31] looking for you and me is to see if we
[2:08:34] would see if were two disciples we're
[2:08:36] following Jesus following the revealed
[2:08:38] Word and I thank God tonight for that
[2:08:40] word that our brother to our Brotherhood
[2:08:43] the book of Acts and just took it burst
[2:08:45] by verse by verse mother why for to show
[2:08:49] us God in and reveal in simplicity and
[2:08:52] I'll what to give us understanding that
[2:08:55] the book of Acts wasn't finished
[2:08:57] 2,000 years ago a man it was the
[2:09:00] beginning I like that that's good it was
[2:09:03] God God started in the book of Acts a
[2:09:05] man and and what and he continuing right
[2:09:08] on down to this hour and you know what
[2:09:10] he had to do in Malachi 4 he had to turn
[2:09:13] our hearts back to the book of Acts a
[2:09:15] man began to turn our hearts but why
[2:09:17] because we were going this way going
[2:09:19] this way this church sisters just
[2:09:21] dismissed faith of that faith you know
[2:09:23] the doctrines and so on but he turned he
[2:09:25] turned our hearts back to let us go back
[2:09:27] to the beginning and let's let's see
[2:09:30] what God started with and see what God
[2:09:33] is doing right on through down to the
[2:09:35] seven churches I like that Oh it struck
[2:09:39] me when he said that the book of Acts is
[2:09:41] still going on a man and I yes I said
[2:09:47] thank God said I will restore you
[2:09:50] restores the book of Acts I like that
[2:09:53] praise the Lord
[2:09:54] so this is absolutely amazing that her
[2:09:56] brother could take that the scripture in
[2:09:59] the book of Acts and and to bring out so
[2:10:01] much revelations give us so much
[2:10:03] understanding of God a man brother I
[2:10:06] trust that you can go back and start the
[2:10:08] book of Acts again and read it with a
[2:10:10] different understanding read it with a
[2:10:12] better understanding a man so you can
[2:10:15] you can identify with we're those that
[2:10:18] are that are in the book of Acts I oh I
[2:10:20] like it
[2:10:21] thank God brother that is still going on
[2:10:24] and if and is not bigger than what what
[2:10:27] it is it's not smaller than what it is
[2:10:28] these exactly the way that God ordained
[2:10:30] it to be a man God God isn't a brother
[2:10:34] sister or whatever God has done
[2:10:37] you know man makes it bigger that God
[2:10:39] what does God do God sends another
[2:10:41] another anointing on the scene to bring
[2:10:42] it back down to God and simplicity amen
[2:10:46] because there make a denomination out of
[2:10:48] it you know whether whether Luther or
[2:10:50] Wesley or the Pentecostals what God does
[2:10:53] you know it's easier as our brothers
[2:10:56] brought out it's all
[2:10:57] like it Oh Acts chapter one after
[2:11:00] scepter to Acts chapter 3 4 5 right on a
[2:11:02] man see don't you get the glory to God
[2:11:05] not demand a man for the remain always
[2:11:09] bills man off see like like they did in
[2:11:12] Luther's day Wesley's day the
[2:11:13] Pentecostal age and so on yeah but God
[2:11:16] had to keep sending the messenger bring
[2:11:19] him back down to God in simplicity a man
[2:11:22] and the same thing in this in this hour
[2:11:24] through the men and ministry of Malachi
[2:11:26] for brother they missed and they failed
[2:11:29] to comprehend God in simplicity that's
[2:11:32] the truth they they wanted the signs
[2:11:34] they wanted the wonders but they didn't
[2:11:36] want the simple revelation of the word
[2:11:38] he may come back to the truth come back
[2:11:42] to the world God's God's revelation
[2:11:44] God's understanding that he wanted to
[2:11:46] give to you and me by the grace of God a
[2:11:48] man and like in our brother broto
[2:11:53] concerning that the disciples were on
[2:11:55] learned and ingrid amen
[2:11:57] I'll try not to preach too long I'll try
[2:12:01] to go as long as I brother did so but he
[2:12:06] said they were unlearned and ignorant Oh
[2:12:13] will be too ashamed to take that oh I
[2:12:18] don't want to have that real reputation
[2:12:20] that idea I think people are gonna thank
[2:12:22] me is that be not learned and ignorant
[2:12:24] well brother that's what God's looking
[2:12:27] for if you Rea if you know that then
[2:12:30] God's able to come down and give you
[2:12:31] something that you need to know by grace
[2:12:33] it says they were on learned that
[2:12:35] ignorant but they had been with Jesus a
[2:12:39] man brother I I thank God for that
[2:12:44] this isn't me go back to that scripture
[2:12:46] that our brother was bringing out here
[2:12:48] boy this is tremendous oh brother
[2:12:51] he in an hour and a half he covered five
[2:12:54] chapters I don't think I'd be able to do
[2:12:56] it
[2:12:58] so I thought that's a gift of God in our
[2:13:01] brother's ministry for sure Brees the
[2:13:04] name of the Lord and again in Acts
[2:13:08] chapter 4 and verse 13 is see oh excuse
[2:13:15] me just for a moment here extra or 13
[2:13:20] and when they saw and be the boldness of
[2:13:24] Peter and John and perceived that they
[2:13:29] were unlearned and ignorant what made
[2:13:32] them bold was the Holy Ghost they humble
[2:13:35] themselves to God a man as they were on
[2:13:39] learned and ignorant they marveled and
[2:13:42] they took knowledge of them that they
[2:13:46] had been with Jesus I like that God
[2:13:48] bless your brother see they humble
[2:13:51] themselves and God got in them to use
[2:13:54] them you want God to use you you got a
[2:13:57] humble yourself you got acknowledged
[2:14:00] Lord I don't know what I should know a
[2:14:01] man I don't understand what I should
[2:14:04] understand are all right but Lord I'm
[2:14:05] depending on you what is it it's the
[2:14:07] Holy Ghost amen
[2:14:08] that's good God taking us back to that
[2:14:12] day of Pentecost that's good see no
[2:14:16] wonder rose it is still going on exactly
[2:14:18] because in every age you had to receive
[2:14:21] the Holy Ghost you had to repent receive
[2:14:23] the Holy Ghost a man god help us brother
[2:14:27] to recognize our need of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:30] and that and to get it we got to humble
[2:14:33] ourselves well acknowledge that when it
[2:14:37] comes to the things of God we are on
[2:14:38] learned and we are ignorant but he's
[2:14:40] there with the Holy Ghost to reveal what
[2:14:43] we need a man but they marveled and they
[2:14:47] took knowledge of them do they take
[2:14:49] knowledge of us that we have been with
[2:14:51] Jesus amen
[2:14:54] or is it oh you you study the word you
[2:14:57] studied this message you studied that
[2:14:58] message all really knows the message no
[2:15:02] not knowing the message is knowing Jesus
[2:15:05] Jesus is the message and he'll reveal it
[2:15:08] hey man
[2:15:09] praise the Lord that's good thank the
[2:15:11] Lord for the
[2:15:12] don't forget it go back to it humble
[2:15:15] yourself amen
[2:15:17] you want to be exalted you're gonna all
[2:15:19] be yourself and colleagues aren't you
[2:15:23] and verse 33 in chapter 4 he said and
[2:15:27] with great power gave the Apostles
[2:15:30] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[2:15:32] Jesus that's good
[2:15:34] that's given witness of the resurrection
[2:15:36] I am what I am because the resurrected
[2:15:39] Christ is in me
[2:15:40] and in you I know what I know because
[2:15:43] the resurrected Christ is in me amen
[2:15:46] and again our brother bought up the
[2:15:47] scripture he saw me with you even in you
[2:15:50] to the end of the age you'll never leave
[2:15:52] us nor forsake us amen brother
[2:15:56] we need a minister brother it's not it's
[2:15:58] not just reading a book you got to have
[2:16:01] Christ in you and even even when it
[2:16:04] comes to the scripture the word you want
[2:16:07] to know what understand it you won't
[2:16:10] wanted to be a blessing to you you gotta
[2:16:11] have Christ in you a man and he said
[2:16:15] with great power gave the Apostles
[2:16:16] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[2:16:18] Jesus Christ and good he said great
[2:16:22] grace was upon them all as the grace of
[2:16:26] God thank God for the for the testimony
[2:16:30] of grace in you in me tonight a man well

[2:17:02] in me in our brother George in the Bride
[2:17:05] of Christ that's good praise the Lord
[2:17:08] hallelujah and one other scripture - I
[2:17:11] liked but again go back to those
[2:17:14] scriptures concerning the disciples
[2:17:16] being ignorant and I learned but what
[2:17:19] made them different David they had been
[2:17:21] with Jesus
