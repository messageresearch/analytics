it's an experience and that's what makes it real to you amen it's not because somebody said this or somebody said that oh they say god is love i know i've experienced it amen we know we've experienced it we're here because of the love of god and praise the lord and god is with us god is there to encourage us god is there to get grant us what we have need of amen brother that's love amen considering the world we're living in and that god is there to meet our needs god is there to give us what we need god is there amen to reveal this reveal that amen is to get to give us the revelation of his will praise the lord hallelujah to give us the revelation of the blessed hope grace grace grace to us brother sister let's give the lord glory amen let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe and again keep keep all the saints of god around the world in prayer and also our brother uh ed cater uh we were in contact with him uh i maybe a couple of times this week and so remember our brother ed in prayer and apparently he's having a service on sundays two o'clock sunday afternoons in central newfoundland i assume it would be somewhere in grand falls windsor area so he's asked us to remember him in prayer and keep him in prayer so we pray the grace of god be with him i don't know if he's he's got very many at all when it comes to attending uh maybe a service that he would have on a two o'clock sunday afternoon so i pray the grace of god to grant our brother his anointing grant our brother is leadership amen by the grace of god so he's requested that we we keep him in prayer amen so again we know the situation is central you know it's not exactly encouraging but we pray that the lord will be with our brother ed amen and uh also uh to remember our not to remember him now no you don't need to be remembered now pray grace that he remembers us and that is a brother george was his last name in dearly george heath amen that our brother just went to be with the lord just recently and a man and uh no he was he he was in a senior's home in deer lake and i have uh met him and i have seen him in the seniors home in deer lake because i've been there visiting another brother and sister amen so we pray the grace of god to the family a man that would mourn our brother george's passing but brother considering our brother's age and considering his condition and being in the home we rejoice that the lord has called him home amen not to a senior citizen's home no not by any means because there's there's there's no there's no old man that hasn't fulfilled their days neither an infant that has to fulfill their days no not by any means we're our brother's god so we pray the grace of god amen that keep us mindful of where he is and that believing by grace that we're going to that same place by the grace of god amen so by god i pray grace to rest our brother george's soul in peace and to bless his family amen and encourage his family and also of course to remember our brother doug sister beverly gayle in uh in that in that uh area as well and of course they they have spent a lot of time visiting in in the in the senior zone there and but mother dog sister beverly is is right there in the area by the grace of god encouraging amen believers to stay with the word amen and i'll tell you brother doug and sister berry they're staying with the world amen they're taking their stand for the truth taking their stand with the word amen and again i've i've been i've known our brother and sister for many many many years amen oh it can go back many years even before the lord called our brother emanuel home oh yeah i that our brother sister was was was part of the believers then prior to fellowship then amen and they're still there amen still there for for the believers they're still there for their brothers and sisters in christ amen so god bless them is my prayer and grace again to brother george's family amen as they release our brother into glory amen and again of course to remember again our brother and cater in prayer and god bless him and maybe there's other needs there too in central so the lord be with them amen it's a lot of memories there for me considering well when i first come to this message in 1966 amen where was i baptized in bishop falls amen oh yeah i could take you there right there now and take it right down to the to the river right down below the falls amen and there's where i was baptized amen i remember our brother bill agat he baptized me in the name of the lord jesus christ and he said oh he said praise the lord he was baptizing others there and he said now we have a young man he said not young now but back then he said now we have a young man he said from saint john's and he said he wants to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and i walked it into the water and our brother that brother bill agat baptized me amen so of course our brother bill has gone on to be with the lord now so i pray the grace of god be with us lord we're pressing on it's been it's been a long time for me to come to this word come to this message in 1966 it's a long time maybe not for our young people here some of you weren't even born amen but i was i was a just a young man i was a teenager maybe 18 or 19 years old back then oh yeah but again the law again 19 let me say this that was in december of 1965 that i was baptized in in the pentecostal church here in st john's elim pentecostal tabernacle amen but again it was in july or august 66 that i was re-baptized in bishop falls amen because i came to the revelation of the message the revelation of water baptism in the name of our lord jesus christ amen praise the lord hallelujah oh brother what a history that i can go back and see what god has done praise the lord i can see what god's doing amen to god be the glory amen so we'll keep the saints of course in prayer and our brother eden cater in prayer and again the family of our brother george in prayer amen and of course remembering our brother doug and sister beverly gale they're there constantly for the believers in western newfoundland they're always there amen they're there to just to keep giving us reports here to keep us up to date concerning what's going on amen so god bless them as well and again regarding any other issues in central newfoundland we pray the grace of god to be with the saints and be with the believers amen of course it's a lot of history for me in central a lot of history for me when it comes to grand falls and bishop falls in that area amen because that's where the message highlighted that's where the message started because when we went to gamble and i i was fellowshipping in gambling cottage meetings and oil was brother and sister burns and a couple of other brothers and sisters and oh yeah we are in cottage meetings even before we heard the message but let you know this that one day our brother burns god rest his soul amen one day he he just went went into a store to do some shopping in gamble amen and and the gentleman the the owner of the building there the owner of the store and he come over to brother burns and he said oh he said excuse me he said you know he said you brother and he said because we had cottage meetings in gamble middle brook then and he said you you brethren he said you know he said that there's a there's a group he's in bishop falls he said that's that's who you're you're like and brother barnes never heard of that before amen and brother barron said in bishop falls yes so he got into it to find out who they were amen he got in contact with brother manuel and the other believers and then they came out to gamble to have a to have a meeting a cottage meeting and i remember the college meeting amen i was there amen and they had it usually would be in sister burns's house but we added his brother sister golding's at home at the time amen so that was the beginning bringing us into the message in 1966 amen so i thank the lord to god be the glory because great things he has done oh let's let's humble ourselves and thank god brother for what he's done for you amen and what he's doing for us now amen praise the lord to move us on bring us out of of brother brown said bring us out of that denominational egypt amen and into the promise of the resurrection and the

believe us out this amen now i believe all things are possible now i believe amen praise the lord god bless you turn with me to second kings chapter 2 the second book of kings chapter 2 amen praise the lord grace of god be with us tonight amen in the going forth of his word to provide what we have need of a man to increase our faith amen to increase our faith and our understanding and revelation of what hour that we're living and exactly what what god is doing amen and what god's requiring of us god help us and in second kings chapter two i'm beginning to read at verse one and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today amen god had given them a revelation amen and he said yea i know it owed ye your peace and elijah said unto him elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho amen and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him notice thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today where'd they get that revelation amen praise the lord amen knowing the ministry of elijah knowing that maybe that he had come to the end of his ministry knowing that what god had promised god had done through his servant elijah and it was finished amen and they had the revelation that god was going to rapture elijah oh god god have mercy and give us the faith that he's rapturing a bride amen and believing that we are part of the bride so the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him notice now that the lord will take away thy master from the thy head today and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace and elijah said unto him terry i pray thee here for the lord has sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they too went on amen he stayed with elijah pray grace so we're going to stay with the elijah ministry stay with the elijah message praise the lord the revealed word amen and it says and 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a fire off and they too stood by jordan amen 50. and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided ether and thither so that they too went over on dry ground amen god help us to live in a miraculous atmosphere amen god was in control they were following god's leadership amen god was was meeting their need here meeting their need there amen brother whether it was just a normal need or a miraculous need god was there to meet it praise the this is tremendous brother when we consider what god was doing for elijah when we consider what elisha was witnessing brother what have we witnessed and what are we witnessing concerning what god has done and what god is doing amen i pray grace brother that we have an experience with god that we have a relationship with god amen it's not just looking back to what he did with william branham amen brother what is he doing now amen through the message that he left us through william branham oh i pray god in the name of jesus oh god give us a living faith brother a living rapturing faith amen if there's any faith that god is looking for tonight any faith that god wants us to have amen why because whether he gave us the word to give us that faith faith comes by hearing the word amen and to give us the faithful for the rapture brother that's why he sent the message of the hour that's why he said the master of the hour amen brother he said he said he said no the the messenger is back here he said luther to get to give that generation the uh faith amen they say amen patience wesley godliness elijah brotherly kindness and to crown it with divine love amen for the resurrection for the rapture amen one was leading on to the other amen pointing to the other by the grace of god amen so brother i trustworth that by grace that we we are getting more and more into the revelation of what god has done amen in the ministry of malachi 4. but what and what what is god doing what is he doing now amen and what will he do amen brother how much longer are we going to be here amen i'm as long as your pastor going to be here and as long as you're going to be here amen considering what god has done in the ministry of malachi 4. amen in the ministry of a proven amen concerning the mystery of god that's been revealed amen because concerning the mystery of god even for the resurrection rapture that has been revealed brother oh my lord i pray grace that we're not missing what god is doing amen well we never miss what he did but i pray grace will not miss what he is doing amen amen the prophet of god was pointing us on to this pointing us on to that i trust brother we're we're experiencing what god promised he was going to do amen and that we're moving on to what he said he would do to the resurrection amen to the rapture amen and remember that god's waiting on who on you god's waiting on me the prophet of god said god is waiting on us what and not only that he said the dead in christ are waiting on us why because we're the generation they've got to come to that faith amen for the resurrection what a generation to come to that faith for the rapture so that amen they're we're going to be the ones that are down here on the earth that god can move in amen and with the reality of the resurrection the reality of the rapture amen praise the lord hallelujah oh brother sister oh god has taken it's not just the letter of the word it's not just oh yeah the bible said the bible said or god said god said or the prophet said the prophet said amen but what is god saying and what is god doing amen amen amen oh brother if we're just focusing on past tense or future tense amen we're not aware of what god's doing amen because the past tense brings us into the into the present tense amen and the present tense brother is giving us faith for what he's doing what he's going to do oh what he's going to do yes but he's already he's already started it we're we're a part of it now he's in action now amen brother's not not just saying that that god did this and that's it he stopped and and oh yeah and we come on the scene then god is doing this for us and then we're one one day we're going to leave the scene and then god's going to do that no no brother got what god did to the prophet he moves he passes it on with you and me amen the revealed word and the faith amen praise the lord the faith that he was that it was ordained that he was ordained to give us through the revealed word oh brother sister the faith that god gave gave that generation through luther and and then the message that he was that he was preaching and wesley and the message that he was preaching amen and moving it on to pentecost amen but pentecost brother brother god crowned it with them with the prophetic message god crowned the pentecostal revival with the prophetic ministry oh yeah or the pentecost taught that they were going to take us on to the coming of the lord amen oh yeah they for years or years pentecost thought you know well we're going to this is going to go into the rapture this is going to the rapture yeah yeah but the thing it was according to the word god had ordained and god had prophesied the ministry of a prophet to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen brother with the faith that god gave the pentecostals a hundred years ago over a hundred years ago amen they went and they did what god wanted to do amen but brother it wasn't going to give us resurrection it wasn't going to give us the rapture amen because in that pentecostal revival out of it it would come the ministry of a prophet that would give us the faith for the resurrection the faith or the rapture amen amen we thank god for the faith that he has given the given his children all the way down through the ages amen increasing our faith increasing our faith amen and brother what was the result of god increasing our faith remember it started it was good down here faith amen in the first age paul was the messenger amen and we were in a oneness with the body of christ the body was in oneness with jesus that's right but brother the thing went into a darkness amen and then god had just delayed started laying the word again the revelation again what for to bring us out of that darkness and the more into the greater and greater revelation of god amen so god was adding to it here adding to it there adding to it there amen until he would bring us to that what right stream faith praise the lord hallelujah luther went forward with this faith and wesley went forward with that faith justification sanctification and the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost amen brother amen and they thought that was it you know yeah but it was what they needed praise the lord they had the revelation of the baptism of the holy ghost amen god entered into a oneness with his seed with his sons and daughters amen through the baptism of the holy ghost that's good wonderful a relationship with god and god of relationship with us but it was to move us on to a greater faith for the resurrection and the rapture amen and brother what god gave pentecost way back on just over a hundred years ago brother it gave them that it restored the gifts and restored this and restored that but brother it it didn't give us right free faith it wasn't ordained to give us rapturing faith they gave them faith for the gifts they gave them faith and for the miracles and the signs and the others amen but god had to bring the prophet on the scene amen with the revealed word to give us the faith for the rapture amen oh praise the lord and again understand the faith that the the luther's message gave his generation wesley's message gave his generation the pentecostal message gave that generation amen but there was rising a generation for the resurrection rise in a generation for the rapture amen rising a generation to get out of time and into eternity and but brother the pentecostal message oh that was good but and all that they felt good and they're wonderful yeah but now hallelujah god god was looking for resurrection rapturing faith amen oh why because brother when it comes to justification bear with me and when it comes to satanification oh they felt good they felt better and they felt even greater and with the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost and pentecost amen but but together it was what god was doing amen amen but what is god doing in you and me amen what's god revealing in you and me amen what faith is god giving you and me amen are we focusing like pentecost on the feelings and on the gifts and on this and on that no the right is focusing we believe it but god is focusing on resurrection the right is focusing on the rapture amen brother that's that's that's that was the predestinated purpose and plan of god amen concerning malachi 4 the predestinated purpose and plan of god in the message of the hour the messenger of the hour amen to lay in the word that would give us rapturing faith amen one of the last messages that the prophet preached rapture amen december the 4th 1965 amen amazing he laid it in laid it in late again concerning the conditions for the rapture yeah the purpose of the rapture the promise of the rapture amen and what we needed as it were to get into the rapture brother he was giving us the revelation of the rapture amen of what god was doing and how god was going to do it amen because as a generation we thought this the rapture was going to be like this rapture is going to be this way the rapture is going to be that way amen but god did it his way and god is doing it his way amen that he's catching the bride up how by the revealed word amen bring us into a total separation more and more and more from the world and the things of the world the foolishes of this world amen so that the things of god is getting more real to the bride amen hallelujah brother he's getting us away and we've the world is getting worse and worse and worse and we become greater and greater strangers we are pilgrims and strangers amen oh you are yeah you mean to tell me you don't feel at home in this world you feel like a stranger you feel like a pilgrim yeah by the grace of god amen i trust you have that that feeling you know trust you have that that that sense within your heart within your soul amen oh yeah brother we're not going to we we don't some then no doubt some believers will and some are but not but the bride is not going to settle into denominational feeling or spirit amen because all down through the ages the elect went on the elect went on but there's a generation the third and fourth generation eight they went into denomination and they just settled out into wesley's message settled down into into luther's message settle down in the oh yeah they felt oh good that's good yeah yeah luther's message that was god wesley that was god the pentecost that was god amen yet what is god now what is god doing now amen because brother all that is past tense what's in the present tense god help us is my prayer amen amen does second kings chapter two verse six is that sister brenda oh six verse six okay praise the lord amen so verse six again elijah said unto him terry i pray thee ear for the lord has sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they too went on oh brother god happens to keep moving on and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they too stood by jordan and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided ether and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee he knew he was going do you know you're going in the rapture is the anointing in you bringing you to that separation more and more so that you feel you don't feel at home here you feel you're you're on your way out and you're about to leave god elvis amen ask what i should do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee he said it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven amen god bless his word you may be seated sorry to keep you standing so long but consider you consider what jesus did standing for standing for a little while it's not going to hurt amen considering what jesus suffered for us amen turn with me to second peter chapter three elijah was caught up but a type of the bride being caught up amen and in second peter chapter 3. and beginning to read at verse 1 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers or mockers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store and reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and the perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day amen considering that the earth would go on time would go on for seven seven days or seven thousand years one day with the lord as a thousand years amen verse 9 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen brother if the revelation of what god has done brings us to anything it will bring us to repentance amen alarm will us to acknowledge that we are sinners saved by the grace of god amen brother sisters who acknowledge amen sent her saved by grace but predestinated for ordained amen to enter into the rapture by the grace of god brother for generations right from the beginning from the fall of man to the to the full redemption of man amen brothers the promise of being caught back into eternity it's the promise of being cut back into the presence of god again amen because ever since the fall in the book of genesis brother in the true seed of god the true elect of god has been the earth the hunger and the thirst to get back to glory is to get back with god again amen we were cut off as it were when it comes to god dealing with the sin in the in the in genesis god dealing with cain and abel oh my lord my lord brother abel or cain thought he could do this cain thought he could do that and cain yeah he had faith in what he was doing but brother not faith and whether whether it was pleasing in the in the eyes of god pay that oh yeah cain had a tremendous sacrifice oh yeah so what do we consider that we're we're offering a good wonderful sacrifice to god amen oh the life that we're living brother at the time that we're giving and maybe even your your money that you're giving and you think oh i'm doing wonderful things for the lord doing this doing that but brother sister again what what is it that god's requiring of you amen oh god god required you of when it comes to the tithe and the offerings and all they say god required that and when it comes to god god require you to say this do this do that amen that's good but brother is it is it based on a faith in your heart or is it based on a knowledge in your head amen brother the thing that god has had to deal with all down through the ages brother is an intellectual faith a man and god has had to move on move his messengers out the prophets out the the apostles out right on down through what for it is it is to get us away from intellectual faith into a spiritual faith to get us from not just from believing in our heads but to believe in our hearts amen there's too many that are believed oh we believe the message we believe the message we believe that god did this we believe god did that we really god said that and god revealed that but brother it's all in their head amen but how many has got it in their hearts oh brother sister i tell you this if you've got the faith in your heart amen brother you you go forth and you speak the word amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah the prophet is somewhere maybe maybe in this message right here on the rapture the father speaks about oh yeah he said he said he said god has ordained you and god is allowing you to speak the word oh yeah and he wants you to speak the word amen no matter what what you're dealing with no matter what the situation is no matter what the problem is amen as a believer as sons and daughters of god brother how do we find the answer how do we find the encouragement by speaking the word amen brother we're not just looking at the negative and and feel bad about it oh lord oh my lord this is happening that's happening or this has happened and that has happened this is going to happen that's going to happen and we feel so bad about it but brother sister do we have faith and believe well lord i believe you're in it somewhere amen you're in control amen so lord i pray grace you're in control of me i pray i believe that you're going to control these situations you're going to control these circumstances amen let's believe concerning the hour that we are living that god is in control man's not in control god is in control it's not the devil in control it is god in control amen brother the bible says the devil has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short well i said that's a tremendous faith amen of all that god has done and all that god is doing it give the devil that faith what faith is it giving us amen just think that satan is there and he's looking over all of the world as it were and he sees this that god's doing this god doesn't have satan to recognize a man want amen but god's doing this god's doing that oh yeah god's doing this god doing that and satan knows the word amen and he knows that when he sees god doing this he's god doing that oh my he knows his time is short brother how many of us know our time is short how many of us know that we are approaching quickly fast approaching the rapture approaching the resurrection oh my brother sister oh i pray grace god help us say we're going to live brother for the rapture that we're living for the resurrection oh my brother we consider the brothers and sisters that have gone on oh brother sister we're going to we're going to meet you soon amen pray and the bible and the prophet of god told us concerning the resurrection rapture he said the dead in christ are going to appear to the living saints amen at the time of the resurrection of the time of the rapture brother oh in the name of jesus i pray that you're going to be in the spirit you're going to walk in the spirit you're going to live in the spirit because you've got to walk in the spirit you've got to live in the spirit if you're going to recognize the saints that are going on when they appear to you amen the brother we could be we could be out maybe as i said uh it could be out in in in a mall somewhere shopping mall amen as i and i i have mentioned that i have seen this one i've seen that one and and i said lord is that brother so-and-so is that sister so-and-so amen so brother we've got to be on our guard because one day they are going to appear to us the dead in christ are going to arise first and they're going to appear to the living saints and he said then because we're going to recognize them they recognize us we'll recognize them and then we're going to be changed and got into that dimension with them amen and the prophet said we're going to be with them and we're going to have fellowship with them he said for maybe around 40 days amen and then he said well look up oh glory hallelujah and he said there's jesus he said why because that anointing that's with us he said he's going to go back up and he said hallelujah what for because the anointing he said he's got to go back up to the throne of god and he said he's going to get into that that body called jesus because where's the body of jesus where is the body of jesus oh they think the blood of jesus is here the body of jesus is there the bible god said the body of jesus he said brother on the day of pentecost he said jesus went up and he put that body he said by the throne of god amen and he left the body there by the throne of god and he said the day of pentecost he came down amen and be and entered into to the to the believer amen he came down and and yeah revealed himself to the believer amen and he's been with us but not the body no no he said the body is we're still up there amen and how long is he going to leave the body there it's going to leave that body there until the resurrection and the rapture amen when the hour of the resurrection comes the other rapture approaches us he said jesus is going to go up and he said he's going to get into that body amen amen that body that he lived in that body that he experienced death in and that body amen that he experienced the resurrection in amen and rapture even amen he'll go up into that body he'll get into that body and he'll come down hallelujah for the resurrection and rapture of the bride praise the name of what an hour that we are living and what are we looking for amen where is jesus amen where is jesus for you what revelation do you have of jesus amen oh jesus is with me and jesus says jesus is that amen yes but the father god said in the hour the time of the resurrection time of the rapture he'll go up and get into that body that he left up there amen and then he'll come back down amen and and what to join with you in the resurrection and the rapture amen and he's going and we're going to oh yeah we'll look up oh and there he is right there and he said after we fellowship so long with the living with the saints amen of god amen that have gone on through the ages through the heirs we'll fellowship with them we'll look up oh there he is amen so we'll rise to meet him by the grace oh god help us to believe do we really believe in the resurrection do we really believe in the rapture do we really believe amen that at any time now any moment now any day now that the dead in christ can come from that dimension into this one amen to appear to the those who are ordained predestinated for as the bright amen amen praise the lord we're going to recognize them they're going to recognize us we're going to have fellowship amen and that we're going to be changed in a moment to drink lemonade and amen we're going to be caught into that dimension with them and fellowship with them praise the lord hallelujah god help us brother to be ready for the rapture amen to be ready for the rapture ready to recognize what god has done and recognize what god is doing amen so that brother when whenever it is and whatever it is oh we're gonna oh always something's gonna something's gonna happen on the inside of the inside we're gonna oh i can't explain it but i'll let me just say this that is gonna be an anointing on in your heart an anointing in your soul that you're gonna say what others are not seen oh yeah you're going to sense what others are not sensing no and i'm not talking about feelings but you're going to sense a power and an anointing amen that the others don't feel don't sense and not aware of amen but amen brother when that hour of the resurrection that moves and moves on the scene when there are the rapture moves are the same there's going to be i tell you this in the right of christ there's going to be an anointing that she's going to sense oh my what's going on she's going to right there in that dimension she's going to sense us something what's going on amen i'll tell you this brother any uh when it comes to unbelievers or made believers they're not going to sense it you know even if they do feel this or feel that or something they just say oh is this move on that's just a feeling but no the bride is going to recognize it oh yeah as the presence of god in another dimension right there he said remember he said they are not the dead in christ he said they're not 12 feet from you at any given time not not not beyond 12 feet no more yeah amen they're there what your theophany your theophany body just say amen praise the lord brother thank god for the revelation the message thank god for the messenger that came and gave us the revelation of theophany bodies amen amen brother and praise the lord when it comes to the resurrection or or even before the resurrection when you leave this when you leave this dimension you're going to step out of the body you're in and you're going to step into that going to that theophany amen praise the lord and when it comes to the rapture brother we're going to we're going to step out of this body the living saints step out of this body and we're going to step into that that theophany body but it's amen and then ease it into a glorified body praise the lord the hour of the resurrection the hour of the rapture oh god i pray god help us to really really really believe it amen don't get caught up with with the body you're in amen oh no we got to get into another body and get caught up amen praise the lord brother we this one when you're here long enough you won't get caught up with this body you'll go down in this body oh yeah you go down amen but by the grace of god all that i trust by grace that we have that faith when it comes when this body goes down oil praise the lord oh hallelujah we're going to move on and step into another one step into a theophany body just think because most people believe that the dead don't know anything it's like when i was uh attending a certain funeral of a certain sister that had passed away some years ago and her family not being message believers they they were they were going to commit her into the ground as wearing barrier through a denominational church and i remember going into the church and just standing at the coffin there where our sister was laid out and physically and there was a gentleman there and he was he was at the coffin and and he just felt so bad that she was gone and i said well i said sir brother i said praise the lord i said she's a lot better off now than she was in that body he said what what do you mean oh i said you don't understand i said if this tabernacle be dissolved i said we got one already waiting i said eternal in the heavens oh praise the lord i said in this body i said she was feeling weakness in this body she was feeling pain she was experiencing this experiencing that amen but i said when death took over i said she just moved and moved out of this body and into another body oh said i said the bible does refer to it as a theophany body but it's going to come one day into a glorified condition amen praise the lord and so i explain it and oh see that is tremendous thank you never he never heard that before he never he never thought that he never experienced that oh i said oh yes i said well we'll give the glory to god i said because she is resting with him amen amen she's not experiencing any weakness she's not experiencing any pain i said no not by any maids i say she's in glory with the lord amen so i pray the grace of god elvis to believe amen brother that where we come from why we're here and where we're going and how we're going to get there amen by the grace of god oh brother sister it's a revelation that brother that that god was that was sharing with with with us right from the fall in genesis amen oh my just think god god gave abel of revelation amen not only where he was going but how he's going to get there what the price that had to be paid amen cain he thought he could do this and he would you know i'll do this for the lord i'll give god this i'll give god oh my when it comes to the offering that cain gave it was tremendous yeah now you compare that with the offering that abel give now what about the offering that others are giving compared to the offering that you give for the lord amen oh and cain gave this oh what an altar that he had there and he could fill the altar with with gifts yeah he wanted to give that to the lord give that to the lord amen but oh but abel went out and just killed the lamb what a lamb that all you're going to do abel just one lamb well he knew what it represented he knew he had a revelation it was by faith he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice are you offering unto god a more excellent sacrifice amen are you pleading the more excellent sacrifice amen for our redemption for the resurrection for the rapture oh this is serious please make your calling and election sure amen but the bible encourages us not just to just to go ahead with religion and think well i believe this and i believe that you will just make it what what what about the bible is it in the word is it according to the scriptures amen that your that your faith is by the word of god amen not by religion not by a church not by doctrine not by when it comes when it comes to the the the creeds and these things no no no it is it is a faith that god has revealed to you and you are responding to that faith amen you are reflecting that faith you're acting on that faith yeah the life you live the church you go to how you go when you go and so on but is it it is a reflection of your faith by the grace of god amen oh god help us brother if there's anything that god that through the ministry of the word what a tremendous responsibility that that would be on my shoulders what a tremendous responsibility on my brother jonathan's shoulders when it comes to the ministry of the word what what are we what is the responsibility what is the burden it is to it is to share the word with the people to give them resurrection and rapturing faith amen what was the revelation and the that that that that genera previous generations had to had to give to the people what well what did what did what were they predestinated to preach what were they ordained to preach in their day in their hour in their age they had to preach the word that would give them the faith that would please god in that age amen they had to preach the word that would give them the faith that would please god in where they were living and what they were doing yeah that's why abel went forth with the revelation that he had and he killed the lamb oh he had the more excellent faith but heirs cain and he he went forth and he did this he went forth and he offered this and you know you know what cain offered the things uh out there in the field and he went pick this and pick that and pluck this up pluck that up and just laid it all on the altar but abel he just went out and just killed that little lamb killed it shed his blood blow it all over the altar hey cain couldn't understand that can't say what the world have you done he did this you doing this but he offered the more excellent sacrifice why because he cain never never had the revelation amen of the fall and of redemption how can we be redeemed he just wanted he felt he just added he just said you do what he did to find favor with god father it's not favor with god it's being redeemed you can you can say well i go to this church i do this i do that i find favor with god yes but is it redemption god help us amen that you have an experience with god wherein you are redeemed you experience redemption amen it's not just to find favor with god oh yeah i like the lord the lord likes me i do this for the lord yeah yeah yeah but are you doing what are you doing for the lord what god wants you to do for him amen are you doing for god what he has ordained what he has predestinated amen for redemption amen but if you do what you're doing is you're you're reflecting a genuine revelation of redemption lord i know that this is the price you have to pay amen you just take out a lamb and kill the lamb hell yeah oh you'll do this and this and this yeah lord but i know that there's a greater there's a greater sacrifice that you're going to make yeah but to cain all it was was just natural things of life i'll give you this lord and i know that you you'll do this and so on no god help us brother god help us to give us the faith for redemption as he was giving abel the faithful redemption brother god help us to have the faith for the rapture amen brother let's believe that that the faith for the rapture brother is not according to what what pentecost is teaching not according to what what this church is teaching or that church is teaching no no according to what god has promised and what god has done and what god is doing amen praise the lord to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen but listen why because god is laying it in your lap there's too many believing oh yeah when it comes to the resurrection they're going to be resurrected and then the other ones they're going to be raptured yeah god's going to do this god's going to do that no god gives you the word to give you the faith to do it are you are you increasing in the revelation amen of the rapture are you getting stronger in the revelation of the resurrection you really believe it my lord have mercy amen listen jesus challenged yes mary and martha yeah when you come to lazarus he said lazarus is dead oh yeah yeah jesus said oh yeah he'll rise again but their their faith was just oh yeah he'll there'll be a resurrection up the road and he arise from the dead at the general resurrection and jesus said i am the resurrection believers thou this amen jesus is challenging our faith in the present tense revelation of who he is amen not will be who he is amen the present tense revelation that he that in luther's age he was he was their justification he was their sanctification he was the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit and to the bride he's the resurrection and the rapture believe us now this he's challenging us as he challenged them 2 000 years ago amen well lord we believe the resurrection is up the road we believe there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be that yes he said but you are the resurrection i am yes you are amen he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die and though we live he'll rise again amen grace you'll not die by the grace of god come on saints oh let's get it let's get let's go beyond doctrine into the reality of the word of god amen to too many today that when it comes to the resurrection and rapture it's just a doctrine yeah it's a doctrine it's a teaching or the bible teaches this the bible teaches that the church is teaching just teaching that but there's a reality that god wants you to manifest do you believe in the resurrection do you believe the resurrection is in you do you believe the rapture's in you brother all that god has done when it comes to the message of the hour it is to give us that faith brother so that the resurrection the rapture is not just something in the past or something in the future it's something in the present god's working on it now god help us to get ready for the rapture he said listen the prophet of god said he said the old beaters of gold he said they would take the gold and beat it till they beat all the dross out of it he said it was pure gold when the beater could see his reflection yeah your pure goal when god jesus can see his reflection in you your spirit your attitude your actions your reactions it's jesus and he said that's the way christ is doing to his church he is beating it and he is turning it and beating it and beating it and he said how dare a preacher to be enough not to tell the word of god he said tell them it's wrong to wear these immoral clothes it's wrong to to smoke cigarettes it's wrong to stay home from church what they say amen it's wrong to seek have cigarettes amen or is wrong to wear certain clothes or is wrong to do this wrong do that but they won't say amen to the statement that you shouldn't stay on from church no no that'll get pretty quiet oh yeah but he said so he says wrong he said he said he's beating it and turning it and he said out there a preacher to be enough not to tell the word of god tell them it's wrong to to wear that clothes oh yeah amen it's wrong to smoke cigarettes amen it's wrong to stay home from church i don't know no but it is if you have the freedom and the liberty to go to church be there amen he said it's wrong to go gambling it's wrong to be racing and carrying on the way the church is doing today and he's playing lotteries and things he said god forbid when i have to do that he said jesus beats it with the holy ghost until he sees his own reflection in it does he see his reflection in you amen jesus see is reflection in your attitude in your spirit and your motives are your objectives is that jesus where is that brother so-and-so that jesus or sister so-and-so god help us oh it's a challenge amen he said god forbid when i had to do that and he said jesus beats it with the holy ghost until he sees his own reflection and then you can see the works of christ being performed in the church then she's ready for the rapture are you ready amen he said do you believe it he said all of you he said the holy spirit is giving the church its last call now and he said doing exactly what the bible said it would do and the pentecostal people are groping over the top of it he said listen if you're if we are expecting christ to come he said do you believe that he said then let's act like we believe it amen he said how can we expect christ to come and putting six million dollars in a building he said how you can get these great big things talking about christ coming he said brother we ought to be making ready for the rapture not for another 500 years here on earth we'll have to put a lot more money into the church so that it'll be still be here 500 years no just take it one day at a time amen leave it with the lord the lord here today gone tomorrow by the grace of god amen he said listen the holy spirit is giving the church the last call and doing exactly what the bible said it would do again let me say this he said do you believe and he said let's act like it how can we expect christ to come and put six million dollars into a building he said how can you get these big things take talking about christ coming well brother we ought to be making ready for the rapture not for another 500 years on earth he said there's something wrong he said you might say it with your lips but by your heart he said oh you say oh yeah i believe christ is coming but your action proves you're different amen grace he said we are at the homeland he said i don't know whether you're going to believe it or not but i've got to say it i believe he said the jews are in a homeland and we're at the end of the age ready for the rapture and he said the rapture comes and the church goes up and we are cut up to meet him in the air and we all know he said the stone that was cut off and cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and he said when it comes what does it do said it does away with the gentile age it's all over and god completely quits dealing with them that's serious that when god stops dealing with the gentiles we know there's coming an hour that when god is going to want to leave the gentiles and go back to the jews has he done that is he doing it i'll tell you the only way that and the only place that god is moving among the gentiles is in the bride is in the elect that's ordained and predestinated for the resurrection or dangerousness for the rapture that's the only ones god's dealing with right now through the message to the revealed word of the hour to give us faith for the rapture amen faith god help us listen he said and if i read this we see it again we're at the homeland the jews are in a homeland we're at the end of the age ready yeah ready for the rapture and he said concerning what god has done what god is doing and he said it does away with the gentile age it's all over and god completely quits dealing with them why let him that's filthy be filthy still and let him that's holy be holy still see what does he do then he takes his church the holy ghost filled he said what's the filthy he said that's the sleeping virgin and them that comes up for judgment and has to be judged by the redeemed and paul told us to take a matter to court because the saints would judge the earth not to take a matter to court he said because the saints would judge the earth he said we are at the end time and again in 1962 he said where we are in the end time coming from the east and the west the north the south what are we doing we are getting ready for that rapture how many are getting ready for the rapture how many are really on a daily basis considering the rapture lord if the rapture is today i trust lord by grace i won't miss it i would say most believers around the world they don't even stop to consider that it's just a doctrine oh we believe there's going to be a rapture no we believe we're being raptured we were being raptured yes because by the by the preaching of the word the ministry of the word of the holy ghost in the word amen that we are being more and more caught up to the spiritual things and the word and we're less cut into the things of the world by the grace of god that's right amen brother how many are more spiritual and less carnal how many are more caught up with what god's doing and less caught up with what's going on in the world how many really really you live the bible says as a pilgrim and a stranger in the earth he said what are we doing he said we are getting ready for the rapture he said holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the holy ghost then she'll go up oh my is it calling his people together to himself in the true oneness with himself because it is one holy spirit he said by one spirit are we all individually baptized into one body collectively the body of jesus christ and jesus christ is living with his spirit in our flesh oh he is jesus is living with his spirit in your flesh in your life he said and he is serving the church and doing the same things he did as an ensign to the world that we're in the last days getting ready for the rapture he said i love him don't you god helps to love jesus not the world or the things of the world but love jesus he said i'm looking for him today and if he isn't here today i'll be looking for him tomorrow and he said if he isn't there tomorrow i'll be looking for him the next day amen and if he isn't here this year i'll be looking for him next year and i know he is coming i don't know the minute of the hour but i know everything is fulfilled and it's ready for the rapture the church is called out it'll be a sacred going just vanish and that'll be all and he said the world go right on just the same people preaching and people thinking they are getting saved amen thinking like they did in the days of noah amen grace brother that's true you know i have preached this i i remember preaching it even in indiana and i said just want to let you know be on your guard because i'll tell you when the bride's gone i said they'll still there'll be a generation here i still preaching the message amen they'll be still preaching god set a prophet they'll be still preaching the mystery of the seals is revealed i said they'll be still preaching the rapture but it'll be over with god and they missed him yeah the prophet god said when that rapture takes place he said there's going to be a generation there's going to be those here and he's still going to say they went to the rapture oh yeah he said i there was yes i knew there was going to be a rapture and he says happen he said it happened they didn't know it the prophet of god said it happened and they didn't know it god helped us that we're going to be well very well aware of the rapture that we're not going to be left behind to recognize something that's happened and we've missed it he said listen there is not nothing in the world can comfort you now but the word of god that's the truth there is no other hopes your nation nowhere else he said we are worm heaton to the core and he said communism has worm heating the thing it's got to be that way and you ain't going to stop it the bible said it was going to be that way and he said listen get ready for the rapture that's the only thing to do let's focus on what god's doing he said again he said listen there's a baptism going on here all the time he said ministers methodists baptists presbyterian church of god lutheran whatever it is are coming and being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ this is 1964. he preached it in jeffersonville in his own church as i said after the bride's gone they were still preaching the message after right has gone they were still god preaching a prophet yeah oh yeah there would still still be message churches i pray god why why why is a messy church can be left like that because they become denominations denominated you got a denominational spirit they don't have the hunger they don't have the thirst for the resurrection and the rapture they just got as part of their doctrine they believe there's going to be a resurrection believe there's going to be a rapture amen but they're going to miss it he said before god when i have to stand at the judgment bar i've got to answer for this and if if i was just as clear in my thoughts of being justified in everything in my life he said i'd be ready for the rapture right now for i know that is the gospel truth the rapture god help us in 1964 he said this is the third poll and he's speaking the word amen it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the rapture in the resurrection the son of man and he said and you would do this if you if properly pressed upon he said would you not escape all these things he said amen and stand before the son of man amen what for for the resurrection for the rapture amen brother thank god for what he has done when it comes to the mysteries and the doctrines the corrections here they corrected this corrected that but brother thank god for that but what's the purpose in doing what he did the purpose was to get us away from those things and to get us into the revelation of the word regarding the rapture but there's too many stutters just focusing on doctrine they're focusing on this doctrine that doctrine like the the trinity and and this one and that one and the water baptism and this one and we should preach it yes and highlight it yes but not keep focusing on it keep focusing on keep knowing why because god did that to bring us into a greater revelation of the rapture amen god did that what for to move us away from this and what for to get us ready for the rapture amen but there's too many focusing on the doctrine this doctrine this doctrine this doctrine but brother god didn't mean for us to do that not to focus on it god ordained for that that faith that revelation that revelation another of another revelation to give us the faith for what god is doing the purpose of why is god doing this why is god doing that well number one he did this in luther because he wanted he wanted to bring them to the revelation of justification and he wanted to bring them to the revelation of sanctification or and he wanted to bring to the revelation of the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but then he sent the messenger to give us the faith for the resurrection and the rapture and there was that generation that didn't think they needed it no they didn't think they needed that that that message or the messenger of prophet no they felt oh we're pentecostal god's blessings with the holy ghost so we won't miss the reverend we won't miss the rap she won't miss the resurrection we got the holy ghost we got the gifts of the spirit no they missed it grace of god to us he said listen you young people and or he said you old you god help you friends this is the hour if you haven't got the holy ghost receive it now for those that are in christ will god bring with him the rest of them will go under the judgment but he said if you are not in christ tonight hear my word for only those that are in christ will go in the rapture brother is christ in you and you in christ that there's a oneness praise the name of the lord he said i believe that separating time is here now and letting him that's filthy be filthy still and let him that's holy be holy still the hours come when god's drawing the separating line amen he said the church is near to be in the rapture amen listen he said no man's a healer god is the healer and he said these gifts are only to show god's attitude towards the people to get you people back to believe in god because he said if you haven't got faith enough to believe for your sick body now you're going to have faith enough for the rapture god help us how many is going to live that kind of a faith day in day out just leave with the lord morning noon and night when you get up you're believing god thank you lord i pray your grace to be with me today oh yeah don't wait for this to happen that happened the devil do this devil do that oh lord no no if he did it you

was doing but brother also he had to know the word he knows the word oh yeah so brother so how much faith are we there if the devil knows it surely we know it amen he said the separating time is near and here now and let him that's filthy be filthy still in him that's holy behold he's still the hours come when god is drawing the separating line he said their church is near to be in the rapture amazing brother god is the healer let's believe and he said because if you haven't got the faith enough to believe your sick body for your sick body are you going to have faith enough for the rapture god help us amen brother let's not believe the devil let's believe god amen bear with me just a moment here oh he said soon there come a scream from the heavens and god is going to hang it in the hall of fame to take it out by the rapture to take it up into glory and we are seeing signs and wonders like we are today and he amen to stimulate the faith to believe that when he comes that we'll be raptured and cut up together to meet him in the air with those who have went on before but he said notice before god does anything on earth he always sends a message a warning getting things ready oh i just feel kindly religious right now and i believe there's a move going on right now god is warning us as it was in the days of noah god is warning us amen get the honest in heart get them ready for the rapture right away god help us brother if we if he had to do felt he had to do it then how much do we have to do it now focus on getting you ready for the rapture whether it's brother journal ministry whether it's brother jonathan ministry our brother america ministering what's the purpose of the ministry getting the bride ready for the rapture because why because that's what god is

getting bring us to that place to to be more and more spiritual to be more and more conscious of god amen and what god is doing yeah that's the truth oh there's gonna be a rapture yes but he's gonna he's gonna raise up a generation that believes it he's gonna raise up a generation that's preaching it he's gonna raise up a generation that's testifying of it living it by the grace of god he said god is now loosening up the church everywhere and he's getting in order now so he can get it into the rapture because he's got to give it rapturing faith before it can go in the rapture god help us and that's what he's done and that's what he's doing amen well the revelation or rather rapturing faith is not just a revelation of the rapture it's the revelation what that there's going to be a rapture no it's a revelation of what god is doing that's constantly pointing to the rapture amen amen god is going to give us an ex rapture experience that we're being cut up from this and cut off from that cut off from the world cut up from the things of the world cut up from the foolish of the world amen mother if he can catch us away from that you'll catch us into eternity amen he's i believe that we are on the borderland tonight and i truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's got to have rapturing faith amen and brother all that god has done and all that god's doing is to confirm rapturing faith amen he said what did they what they did at pentecost and what they add in the early testament he said we got today and as soon as god can get the thing ironed out and the church set together the rapture will come god help us god help us amen there's so many listen make you got to be born again and he said if you're not born again you weren't going to rapture are you born again are you a new creature in christ new motives new objectives new attitudes new actions new reactions amen not the old nature of mom and dad or grandma and grandpa now no no it's your heavenly father you got his nature now there's too many still still controlled by the nature of the flesh that they inherited from mom dad grandma granville all down through no it's the nature of god you've been born again and you've got the nature of that new parent you got the nature your new father amen hallelujah and he said except you as an individual has been born by by the holy ghost you will never go in the rapture god help us amen god help us before god can ever take his church in the rapture it has to go through the hall of critics the world make fun of it and call it names you know then she goes in the rapture amen she took her stand for the truth by the grace of god [Music] oh 1956 he did make this statement statement concerning the rapture he said how do you know the rapture is not going on all the time first thing you know it'll be past and one disappearing here and one disappearing there it'll be gone and the first thing you know judgment will strike the world amen remember they didn't know it until the day they entered into the ark and then it was too late he said the foolish virgin didn't know until she come back and found the wise virgin gone and then she was left for the tribulation period god help us amen to get ready amen the bride is forgiven and she's going straight to glory in a rapture amen it is the secret catching away by the grace of god
