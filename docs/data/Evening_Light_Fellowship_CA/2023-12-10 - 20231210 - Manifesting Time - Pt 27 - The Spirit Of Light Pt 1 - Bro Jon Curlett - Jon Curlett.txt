promised us through your word Lord Just Have Your Way once again this morning we pray Lord asking your touch on your people in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would easy scripture to find Genesis 1 And1 this morning Genesis 1 And1 it's good to be here this morning appreciate your your graciousness to let us move the service back we didn't get to bed till about 4:45 this morning uh Blanc and the boy flight got pushed back an hour and a half and then when I woke up it had been pushed back another 20 minutes so they didn't land till 3:20 and uh then the luggage took the longest that's ever taken I think in St John's airport and so we didn't get home till late and then putting all the boys to bed and whatnot so uh I had planned to stay up and just till about 1:30 and then pick them up but when I saw 3:00 and then 3:20 I said I'm just going to go to bed and that worked out pretty well I'm I'm actually feeling quite good this morning so I thank the Lord for that amen but uh it gives me a bit of a feeling for how brother Grant feels so often when he works through a night and then comes into church and and and and sits through a service like this so anyways God bless the grants good to see you back again we've missed you while you're away amen just trusting the goodness of God we did have brother kmen Mills book his flight so he will be here while I'm gone to Vancouver and he'll preach the Saturday January 20th at 6: p.m. Lord willing and then again Sunday morning at 11:00 a.m. so looking forward to that amen Let's uh let's go to the word this morning Genesis 1 And1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning maybe bit of a strange start uh start you know considering the the topic we're on and we are continuing our our series on manifesting time and we're moving towards adoption but we're taking a subtitle this morning of the spirit of light brother Matt I've got just a bit of an echo here I don't know if there's something you can do about that amen but we're going to talk about the spirit of light we're going to take at least a couple services on this and I'm I'm more to set a a foundation again this morning because we're still talking about this attribute of Charity Divine love it's the the nature and attributes and the effect of the Holy Ghost and you know as I read this first scripture we looked at the first portion of creation was a division between Darkness and Light and to me that's an amazing thing because as we see here this is not just a scripture about what happened them but it's a scripture about what's happening day in and day out and season and age after age in the lives of the the Believers amen and before we see that division though what we see is a moving of the spirit of God Amen you'll find as we go through this that there's a working of the holy spirit in the people because it says it moved upon the face of the waters and you'll see if you go through scripture and brother Brandon makes it clear time and time again he says Waters is people Waters is people so what if you take the scripture and you move it into US it says the Holy Spirit moved across the people amen and what was it doing it was preparing them for something that was going to happen the moving of the holy spirit is a prec cursor to an event that God wants to happen and we'll see it in a service the moving of the holy spirit is not to make us shout and dance and jump that's a wonderful thing but it's there to perform something that God wants done it's there for something that God has planned there's an event there's a situation that God has foreordained and so the moving of the spirit prepares you for what God's trying to do amen and we see that What's Happening Here is it's a working of the Holy Spirit and it's preparing the World to Change because it's been in a certain way for so long and there's been no life it's been dark it's been in chaos but what's happening is the spirit's moving and when the spirit's moving then something has to happen after that amen there's supposed to be a purpose behind all these things brother B puts it this way he says well there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere sometimes that's where we're at dark dismal gloomy amen look for the moving of the spirit because something will move that away he says and the spirit of God moved upon that water and said let there be light God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live so catch that thought the spirit of God moves on the waters it's moving on the people and it's preparing the world to produce what's already in it it's moving on the people to produce what's already in it the seeds are there they just need light to start growing and so the spirit moves and the spirit moving is going to bring the light afterwards amen but everything's in chaos it's not growing it's submerged it's hidden it's mky it's dark it's just turmoil and death he says and the first light was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order watch this to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth a creation of joy and life if that's what it was in the beginning what ought it to be now he says then the spirit of God as it moved with what love and compassion anden the spirit of God moves with love and compassion it's doing it for your good it's doing us to do something in your life that'll bring out good things in your life says it moved with love and compassion at that gray the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept across its rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed he says that was a great hour so the Holy Spirit was moving to prepare the Earth to produce what's already in it and we've talked about this many times as we've preached on the statute of a perfect man that the moving of the Holy Spirit the working of the holy spirit is to draw out what God has already placed inside of the believer if you never were part of the word you will never be a part of the word if you didn't have the word you won't be the word amen it's something that's in there but the moving of the holy spirit is to draw out what's there and it's setting an atmosphere brother Braham said setting an atmosphere for the word to come forth for the seeds to come forth and each one to produce of its own kind amen so when the Holy Spirit starts moving look at it this way it's a countdown the moving of the holy spirit is a countdown to an event that God has planned because God doesn't move with purpose and so he sends the spirit and brother Brandonwood said he sends the Holy Spirit to you to put an unction in your heart to put a desire in your heart to put a call in your heart for what God's already planned to give you in your life that God is preparing the church that God's preparing the People by the unction the moving of the holy spirit so that they're ready when the spirit moves to bring forth what's supposed to happen in its time and in its season amen so when we see the Holy Spirit moving look for its purpose it's easy to enjoy the atmosphere and we don't want to stop that it's like being in a marriage you don't want to lose the atmosphere but the atmosphere is for a purpose and it's to bring life it's to bring joy it's to bring love and all of these different things if God's wanting to do something then let's look for what he's wanting to do not just bask in the presence let the presence have its effect amen if he's moving then he's moving to take out Darkness he's moving to cast out sickness he's moving to change things he's moving to break change inside of every one of our lives lives he's looking to bring things into order that's what's happening when the spirit's moving it's bringing things in order remember brother bradam had to preach Church order why because they were stuck on the blessings rather than the purpose but when the Holy Spirit comes in the opening of the full word what does it do is it puts those gifts it puts those things in their right place and all of a sudden now it's an effective body rather than chaos one jumping up here brother said one pop up here and one pop up here they would interrupt the preaching of the word in these different things brother Bram said but this time he's speaking about Easter now and it is the rising of the sun it's his e last Easter message he says but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising he's talking about the resurrection he says another son s o n Rising it was not only Su Rising it it was the s o n had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promised Sea by that forn knowledge he had seen laying upon the Earth no more could the botney life live back there at the beginning without the Su to bring it to life and no more than today when sons of God is is upon the Earth it takes the s o n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world so brother BS jumped 2,000 years now 4,000 years and he said there was a first light that came forth and there was a rising of the sun and it prepared things he says now we come 4,000 years and now there's an s o n a capital s o n rising and it's to bring forth the same type of thing is to bring forth the seeds of the predestinated sons of God out of this world he says and on Easter morning in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the Earth but In Heaven There was a book of memory and his attributes were in him knowing that because this son of God raised it would also raise to life every son that was for ordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious Sunrise that was than it was at the beginning when it first done so the prophet saying we read Genesis 1 and we see that in the beginning was the word and then we see that it says let there be light and light comes forth but he says that's not the great light that was really intended that word that said let there be light was for a sunlight to come a capital s o n light and when the First Sunlight comes then now there's many sons that are going to be born after there's sons and daughters that are going to come up out of the dirt of this Earth and they're going to be the same word as that sunlight that came forth on Resurrection morning amen brother bam said there's an Easter morning and the first Son of God Rises and that's to set the pattern because there's more sons of God that have to rise there's more Daughters of God that have to rise that morning there was a death that was broken there was a death that was bound and it's so that there's another death that's going to be bound in your life and in my life it was setting a pattern for Sunrise after Sunrise of each child of God being born by the spirit of God and breaking the chains and shackles of death and of Satan's kingdom amen these events are meant to happen over and over again as the word is born in its time and season brother B says this he says now in Genesis 1 the first CH or Genesis the first chapter the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and the Bible said in the beginning back there that this world was without form and was void there is nothing but just a darkness of chaos and what a horrible shape it must have been in nothing but way into the darkness Yonder without light or anything the churning of the water and that wandering star twisted around around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been a terrific mass of something lost like it was it couldn't find its way he says and that's just what we become when we became wandering Stars away from God just without hope without God just turning around in darkness not knowing where we're going he says and God took that great chaos of darkness and transformed it into a Garden of Eden SE by his word he says and that's how we're transformed by God's word when God said let there be light and that mass of creation out there come over and around the Sun and begin to revolve around the sun and it became a Garden of Eden how because it obeyed the word of God now church let me put it this way the Earth did not choose to obey the word went forth with power and it moved it to where it needed to be to set up the conditions for the word to be born he says it done the perfect will of God for it was transformed from chaos into a Garden of Eden by the word of God then he says now that's what we are here for that's what we're here for today he says that's my message it has been all along is the word of God we must hold to that regardless of what other things take place always stay with that word always what does that look like always check your motives and objectives if it is according to the word of God see we look at the action is the action right but is your motive and objective right too cu the wrong motive with the right action will still produce the wrong result cuz what my fingers are in it my fingers mess things up we got to get our hands out of it and let God work through us he says if it isn't leave it alone if your motives and objectives are right leave it alone it might be the right thing to do but if your motives and objectives are wrong leave it alone until you get them right by the word he he says but if it's with the word of God and lines up with the word of God then that he says you hold to that now I've got I had a ton of quotes as I was studying This and like I said I think we'll take two services on this probably but there's dozens and dozens of scriptures on the Holy Spirit and light and what it means but the thing that came through time and time again is that light brings the seed of God into the order of the word of God seed can lay a long time and nothing happen but you got got to remember when we go to the parable of the swer he planted seed specifically in an area he planted it good seed in a good field that was prepared and then an enemy comes and he Blends in a bunch of things other around it but when the sunlight comes forth no matter what it's going to bring the good seed out The Bad Seed might come with it but the good seed are going to come forth no matter what because they've been planted with purpose and the purpose is to bring you into your full word potential that's what we're supposed to be doing here coming into the word for our day coming into the word for our season that Spirit of light it's the Living Word of God is to here to take us out of Darkness out of chaos out of gloominess out of Despair and despondency whatever it is that's murky around us and to take us in the light of God that shows us the path and the way of a holy ghost filled believer what is it it's so that the word can be produced that's all it's trying to do that's all light is trying to do is produce life we've said this scripture in John 1 many times and and it says in the beginning was the word the the word was with God the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now watch these last two verses in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not the darkness did not overcome on it did not overcome it now I preached on this scripture in John 1 many times and I think it's probably the greatest scripture that you can have when it comes to what what the the plan of God looks like because it tells us our origin and it takes us through the process and it takes us all the way to our destiny all over again amen it takes us from the word as a thought it brings us through the Fulfillment in flesh not just in Christ but it's in you and I you see the whole plan of God right here in John 1 if you read the entire chapter it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and Word was God so we see our origin was where in the beginning in the beginning was the word and then we see our position the word was with God and the Word was God that's not just Christ that's those that are in Christ as well then we see the word was not just a thought and it was not just an idea and it wasn't just something spoken but it was a person because it says in verse three all things were made by him so the word has to come into a person it is a person and then from there we come in from the word was a person and him in him was life and that life now becomes the light of men and so the word now moves all the way down from God in morphed in a in a Pillar of Fire into a morphate into a body and now he's come down into you and I and it's the exact same word it's the exact same life it's the exact same light every bit by bit it's God just dispersing him down through all of these things because look it doesn't stop with Christ that's where denomination has stopped so many times as they point to 2,000 years ago and they neglect to see that there's a life that is a light of men today amen and Christ is being manifested again what is light light is the prec cursor to life if you have light you will have life if there's anything to come to light if there's anything to come to life listen if you've just got dirt guess what nothing comes out of dirt if you got a seed in the dirt you put it in light in time that seed will come forth because light produces the conditions for life but whatever's in there is going to come out no matter what if you put it under light whatever is in there is going to come out but if it's just dirt what happens when the Sun goes away what happens the dirt loses the victory doesn't it CU there's no life in it CU see there's Cycles in life isn't there there's a daytime there's a night time there's a good time there's a tough time there's there there's times of wealth and there's times of poorness there's times of Health there's times of sickness all these things but if there's a seed in there and the life has quickened it even though it turns into night the seed still grows in the night cuz there's life there's something there but if it's just dirt as soon as that Sun Goes Over the Horizon then the dirt just gets cool again and we lose everything brother Braham says this he says life comes only by the word of God made manifest he says as long as it's just in the book like this he says it can still be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of be manifest then that is the light of the word he says see the word said so and then when it come to pass that is life in light it's light bringing Life Light brings life he says plant the wheed out here and put it in the basement covered all over and it'll never bring forth anything CU it can't there's no light there but as soon as light strikes it then it'll bring forth life if it's a germatize seed he says there's the same thing it is in the word see the word is God and when the light strikes it it brings the word to life again he's pointing us back to Genesis one he says when the word was a light and it struck a seed It produced the word he says and it's got to be the same thing again it's been laying dorant but as soon as the light of God's word strikes the word inside of you it's got to bring forth life again because it has to produce it's a word seed and it has to produce the word for its age he says every age has always been that oh how we appreciate these great things how that the word being Vindicated is the light of the spoken word see cuz we've always it's so easy to look at the script and put things only for the moment that they're in but brother braham's taking us back to Genesis 1 and this is the last year he's alive seals are open he's understanding the scriptures in a way he's never understood them before and he's saying you've got to realize that you were part of that light being called forth that you were part of that word being called forth at the very beginning and that word has been sitting there for 6,000 years to bring you out the light came forth the first time and it drew natural seeds out of the earth he said but there's a word that went forth and it was based on the memory the thoughts the book of the thoughts of God and that's been going forth and it's working and it's working and it's moving upon the face of the people on the face of the waters and it's bringing you to the place where you'll come to life and it's been going on for 6,000 years and the word has been moving with power and with authority to bring you to the place where you're at today right here right now that's the working of the word of God that's an amazing thing to think that the word has been working for 6,000 years to bring a bride to this place where she's at today that's what he thought he thought of you right here where you are today just like this and then he said the same thing when Christ Rose he says that's not just an event but that's an event that has to be repeated because if the word goes down the word must come up if there was a word planted then a word has to come forth and if Christ goes down and dies and comes up then if the word is planted again and comes up it has to come up again it's the same thing there's a resurrection there's a Rapture there's a changing of the bodies for each and every one of us so that means that if there was a light for them there's a light for us if there was a time for them there's a time for us if there's a season for them there's a season for us each and every one of us has been planted and the light comes to us in a particular season and if we're under the right light it'll produce the right thing Isaiah 60 very familiar scripture for the bride says arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee let me stop there it didn't say arise Shine for light has come it says your light has come that means you've got a light to sit under you've got a light to rest under and you've got a time for the light to come to you your light may have been lit before mine was you may have come to light before I did but I've got a light and you've got a light and you've got a season and I've got a season the scripture says says that each one is supposed to bring forth fruit in their season some of you are ahead of me and some of you are behind me it doesn't bother me CU we've each got a season to bring forth our fruit and it's based on when the light came to us and what we've been pled for and what our purpose is as the Earth spins around the Sun and turns around it's moving around but as it moves it spins and every Revolution is a day and guess what the Eastern s Eastern Hemisphere gets light before we do does that make them better no it just means they got light before we did and what happens is as the Earth continues to spin then light comes to us their day starts way before ours does but their day ends way before our does as well and it's a cycle and it's a season so they get their light and things start and then they things start to really grow and work and then it goes into night time and things slow down a bit but we're just getting started and so what you'll find is in the end it all works out it all works out we all end up in the same place the same time right that extra eight hours that Africa gets ahead of us doesn't really give them an advantage it's all the same thing cuz they cool down when we get hot it all works out in the end amen but the light has to come to you there's a light that's come in this age and it's for you behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet right there's a light that comes to you and what is the effect of it it says if your light has come then the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee what's the glory of the Lord you look in the scripture you look up that this is exactly all I did in the scriptures I just looked up glory of the Lord and quotes and you know what it is time and time again it's the pillar of cloud and it's the pillar of fire it's the personal presence of Jesus Christ so it says arise Shine for thy light has come and when your light comes the personal presence of Christ comes in your midst comes into you CU it says it's risen upon thee it's it's resting upon you that's what happened with Christ at the River Jordan Remember unto whom thou seest what the spirit descending resting upon that's the one and then he says what we've each one got it as well we've got a time we've got a season where this thing's going to come down upon us and it's the personal life amen it's the Living Word it's the presence of God it's the Holy Spirit the glory of God is the holy spirit in a believer's life bringing us into full maturity that's what it looks like brother Braham said this I don't have it in the notes I was just reading in the office he said every man born again of the Holy Ghost is glorified in God's presence right now waiting for the time of redemption right now the holy spirit is upon you and you are glorified now in Christ's presence but it's not me as in it's not about me there's nothing glorious about me there's someone gloriest that has to be inside of me in order for his glory to rise upon me amen CU in this flesh dwells no good thing Paul say said amen but if we've died out and there's something else that's risen up in us like it says risen upon us now we've got the Glorious one inside of us Paul said in 2 Corinthians he says but we all all he says with open face beholding as in a glass a mirror the glory of God are changed into what the same image we all being changed into a word image we all being changed to reflect Christ oh we look different this morning from different backgrounds different colors different genders whatever it might be we look and we say we're all different but we're being changed into the same thing and it's Christ The Living Word he says we're changed into the same image from what glory to glory he says his glory is risen upon thee we're being changed from glory to glory here a little there a little here a line their line precept upon precept building us up into the exact same thing that it was in the beginning he says how even as by the spirit of the Lord so the spirit of the Lord in you changes you into the glory of the word for your day so if we come back to our scripture it says arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon the that we're risen means to appear to break forth or to shine in other words a light coming into US brings light out of us if you got a light in you then there's going to be a light that comes out of you we'll get into that maybe in the next service amen that's there there's something in us that lays hold of us and it makes us like itself that's what's happening the spirit of God is coming in but watch why we need this light because in verse two it says for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth the darkness that's a specific Darkness it's not generic Darkness this is the darkness and you know what that is it's the absence of the presence of God we're in Satan's edting now there there there's nothing here amen but then watch this it says that the darkness shall cover the Earth that word Darkness means things are obscured they're hard to see but then it says and gross Darkness shall cover the people now you got darkness and then you got a gross darkness that word gross means heavy cloud and darkness so the cloud the darkness on the people is worth some what's on the the Earth itself that's why the Earth is groaning and travailing it's it's crying out for the manifestation of the sons of God cuz it's in darkness but the people are even in a worse place it says for so and gross Darkness upon the people so the people are in a worse condition but look what his promis to us he says but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee church I love a good promise and that's about as good as it gets when things are as dark as it's ever been I'm going to be a light upon you and my glory is going to be seen in you in a time of chaos unrest confusion uh m work nothing seeming clear yet I'll be with you and not only will I be with you but my glory is going to be shown in your lives each and every one of us God's going to come to us and he's going to put us in a personal relationship that'll make us live a word that nobody else can live amen notice now it's a cloudiness it's dense it's dark in New Finland we know what dense cloud is like don't we fog and you know what's the worst fog in the late evening why cuz you can't see anything the light is fading and the light fades it there's just a bit enough to light the fog up so you can't see through it you're almost better off in the sheer Darkness with fog sometimes but it just makes it so hard to see I remember when I was here in November of 2019 and I had sister moren's little Corolla and I was going through on the on a peacekeeper way up towards there and when I came up to the main highway I couldn't see a thing nothing at all the fog was so dense couldn't see a thing and all I was doing was trying to see the markings on the road to make sure that I was going to stay in the right lane and go in the right direction cuz I couldn't see anything that's the conditions God's talking about for this age you can't see anything you know where you are but you can't see anything around you you have no point of reference you have nothing to say which way I'm going and is it the right way now we've got cars with headlights and we've got roads with road marking so we know we can follow that but in that day they didn't have that and if you're in a gross darkness and you don't have any points of reference you don't have any landmarks what happens you get lost and that's what we've had today is it's become so dark in the church world that they've lost all points of reference they've call good evil and evil good they've made the word they've made the word fit them rather than them fit the word they've cut it they've trimmed it out they've made it and here's the thing church that's why they're naked is because they have no covering none of the word is covering them they've changed it and it's a garment of their own making and so they're naked in the eyes of God but they moved away from the absolute reference of God's word and so they're walking around in murkiness and then they wonder why things happen the way they do and they they wonder why they don't get the results that they want in these different things why it's because they lost the reference it's so dark it's so murky they're so caught up in their man-made conditions and their denominations and these things and they end up going in a direction that they think is right and the ways thereof are the ways of death cuz there's only one way there's only one path there's only one door and it's Christ the word and says straight is the way and few there be that find it it's a dangerous time this mariness is dangerous in Zechariah it says it shall come to pass in that day the light shall not be clear nor dark it's not full dark and it's not full light it's murky nothing's clearly dist displayed it Shadows it's it's obscured it says but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light this is evening Light Fellowship that's what we call ourselves this the the the title we put on this church right now and he says at the evening time the end of the day the End of the Age the end of the season the end of God working with mankind the Gentiles have an evening time and we're in it this is it we're here nothing more coming for the Gentiles after this and then God moves to the Jews and they have their evening time as well and they both get the exact same light and what is it it's Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's Christ the word being manifested in flesh once again in the true believer's lives amen what is it it's the Holy Ghost living again that's all it is because in a day they'll get it and we've had 2,000 years to get it and we go into rap resurrection and Rapture and then it comes back to them and they get the Holy Ghost and in a day 144,000 are sealed and then it goes into absolute and total chaos brother Braham says it this way he says and you predicted there would be a time from your crucifixion until your coming a day that would not be night nor day it would be a dismal gloomy time he says just enough light to see how to get around I call it muddling around you're not getting anywhere but you see enough to to know that where your next step is going to be but you can't see anything beyond that and you don't know where you're headed again because you can't see any references you can't see any landmarks amen they're stumbling in the darkness in the dimness they can get around but they can't see where they need to go and they can't confirm that they're going in the right direction CU it's all in their own head amen but there's a promise to the True Believer and he says in Isaiah 42 he says and I will bring the Blind by the way that they knew not I will lead them in paths that they have not known I will make Darkness light before them and watch this and crooked things straight if there's anything you know about people that W that are in the woods getting lost you know what they do they never walk straight they call it the death spiral and they tend to walk in circles what they don't do is walk in a straight line he says I'm going to bring light in a time of darkness and I'm going to make your path straight so you know how to walk I'm going to light the path and here's the thing Church it doesn't matter how dangerous it is die side as long as you follow the light in the middle of the path you stay in the middle of the road brother Ram told us always stay in the middle of the road remember that story he told about the the the king that needed a new Chariot driver I don't know if he told I've heard ministers talk about it the king needed a new Chariot driver and so he had him take him along the L A Road along the edge of a cliff and one guy came and he was going as fast as he could go and he was sliding that Chariot around the corners and the wheels just skidding on the very edge the king says that's no good for me you put my life in your hands recklessly then the next guy came and he was driving along and he was so close to the inside of the cliff that the King was worried that he was going to flip the Chariot if he made a single mistake cuz the thing is this we're going to make a mistake at some point he said that's no good he says you're too busy trying not to make a mistake that you'll end up wrecking us anyways then the third guy came and he drove at a sane speed just in the middle of the road and the King was never in danger from falling off nor hitting the inside of the cliff he says you're the one I want because you're taking my life into account rather than trying to impress me that's where God wants a believer in the middle of the road that's the safest place to be amen but the promise is there he says there's going to be light in the evening time he says he turned Darkness into light he'd straighten out the path of our lives but the question we have then is how do we know if we found the light there's a lot of lights I was read a quote where brother BR says Hollywood shines there's lots of glittering going on out there there's lots of Ministries out there and I'm just talk not talking message I'm talking around the world there's lots of gifts out there lots of manifestations how do you know if you found the light how do you know what is the right light there's got to be a word answer for it we know what ours is revelation 1 says write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks he says the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches so there's a light for every age and it's one man anointed by the Holy Ghost that's it it's always been that way it will ever be that way it's one Ministry it's one man that can catch the voice of the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit to that age and he comes with a message and it saves and it sanctifies and it does the work that God requires For That season and that age that's the only one a Candlestick can only burn as it has fuel and remember those candlesticks in those days they had to have oil constantly and oil is the Holy Ghost so the only way you're going to get oil is if the Holy Ghost is moving to produce that light it's the only thing otherwise it's dead it's dead it's man-made light the only light that God works with is the word being made Real by the Holy Spirit otherwise it's a false light amen we can preach till we're blue in the face we can say Amen all day but until it's alive in me I'm lost that's just this it's the simple truth of it brother bam says this in the church age book he said the seven spirits and the Seven Stars the spirits were the angels that went to the Stars which were Messengers seven spirits seven different times the Holy Spirit would anoint a messenger which was a star in his day he says a spirit is eternal and the star was made for a purpose to reflect light in the dark of these Church ages where candles and stars were representing the angel the spirit was the one that went to the star and reflected the light of the Holy Spirit through this star to that church age he says that you might wonder who the seven spirits are it say seven messengers of the seven Church ages see now and each time that star came on the scene the Holy Spirit came down and anointed that star and kept it just exactly like the first ones was only one light for one a for each age and it comes by the Holy Spirit anointing a single messenger we have people talking about eighth Messengers today impossible there's only one messenger for each age he said clearly there's Seven Ages you say we're in a bride age that that's that that's a a metaphor that we're outside of the Leo Deans because we're out Christ is out so we've got to be out they've kicked him out of the church but that doesn't mean we're out of the season the age itself but we're not identified with Leo deia we've come out of her my people amen there's no eighth messenger eighth messenger goes to the Jews that's who gets it amen that's their season it's not ours there's nothing more coming brother Braham says you've got your last sign all that's left now is the producing of the word of God in our lives last signs come greatest signs ever seen since Christ was on Earth in this day that was the last sign there's nothing more coming so the question is then will we receive the light light's a funny thing youo there can be light there but you've got to take advantage of it if we were to turn out all the lights and black out all the windows here and I sha a light and I sha it down this path down the aisle here you'd you'd easily find your way out as long as you stayed in the light that I'd sha on that path but if you turn down that light and you say I'm going to find my way out of this church another way you know what happens the light that you ignore actually puts a greater Shadow on where you're trying to go it makes the situation worse because you have this contrast between light and darkness and so it makes things more obscure it makes things more shadowed and your lights your eyes are trying to compensate for light and darkness at the same time and what it does is it actually blinds you even worse than you would be than in total darkness because you're trying to ignore the light and find your own way and the light actually causes shadows as you walk away it makes it worse but we have a choice we have a choice to walk in light we have a choice to walk in what the holy spirit's doing in our lives what it's convicting what it's leading how it's guiding how it's trying to work inside of our Lives amen and if we turn it down things get tough in a hurry a real hurry first John says this but if we you know what that says it's not just you and it's not just me we means more than one that means there's at least two real Believers in the world if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another so that means if there's two Believers they're going to get along if we can't get along we're not walking in light if we can't have Fellowship we're not walking in light he says we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin brother man puts it this way he says then to see God in the midst of darkness and the Darkness of Creed the darkness of denominations take his word and a bunch of people that will believe it and shine forth his light and his life catch this he says it's more light it's not more than was it's more of what was in the beginning God's bringing more because there's sons and go Daughters of God that have to be produced it's more light coming forth it's not new light it's just the light coming forth it's more he says it's eternal life more more than it was at the dawn of creation where he said let there be light and there was light certainly so there's more to Genesis 1 than we thought when he called forth light he was not just calling forth light in terms of the logos the Son of God he wasn't just calling forth the Sun and the Moon which was actually later but he was calling forth children of God word born Sons and Daughters of God Amen so we've got to be found walking in the word today with God today amen here's the thing Jesus said you are the light of the world he says here more light remember he said I'm the light of the world and then he comes to the end he says I'm going away and now you're the light of the world so the word became light the word the light became life he says and now I'm going away but I'm going to send the same life upon you I'm going to send the same light upon you he takes them up into an upper room and on the day of Pentecost what does he do he puts light inside of them what was it tongues of fire came down he lit their Wicks he turned them into lamps and then he says you are the light of the world now and so the word is being made flesh in the same way that it was in Christ in you but we've just got a little portion we've just got a little bit but we've got it that's the thing is we've got it and we've got to recognize that on the day of Pentecost he was doing was he was redistributing the light he was redistributing the life so that he could have little lights all over this world cuz when he was there there was only one light and if you missed them you missed them but then on hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands and millions of Lights perhaps in the world today now there's a witness that the whole world can see no matter where we are cuz it had to go to Every tongue and Nation had to go to every place and he needed to put little lights in each and every one of us amen but we've got to be walking with God today the message that we Preach Today is not the same message that was preached 50 years ago it's the same message but the preaching has changed why because God has been continuing to reveal himself he's been revealing where we're at he's been revealing what is supposed to be done in this age you look at what the message was you know even even 30 years ago so much was about God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet Church we've moved so far beyond God sent a prophet that it almost has no relative Rel it's not even relative anymore because we've moved on from like John and Christ we've moved on from he was here to point us to him now we moved on to the one he was pointing us too we've accepted that light but we've moved on Into the Light of Christ himself the word made flesh amongst us amen we've got to keep walking and if we walk he says then what the S the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us day in day out that walking cleans us it keeps us clean puts things in that need to be put in it takes things out that need to be taken out it's a washing of Water by The Living Word of God Amen and there's a there's a mercy there's a Grace that comes with Walking with God that you can't get anywhere else you just can't do it we've got to keep going from with Christ we've got to go from repentance to baptism all the way to the spirit of God dwelling inside of us and leading us and guiding us and that's our Victory that's our overcoming Powers when he's in the house Amen on that thought of the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sins if we walk with him Paul said in Romans 8:1 he says there is therefore now no condemnation no condemnation none no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk how not after the flesh but after the spirit church there is a contrariness between the Flesh and the spirit and Paul's drawing a distinction he says if you walk in the spirit if you walk in the light as he is in the light there's no condemnation CU you're with him you're in his light you're in his presence you're under his authority you're under his headship How can there be condemnation when you're with him he's the perfect one he's the Holy One if you're with him and in in him dwells all good things then how can you be wrong you can't you're with him you're following him then Paul would say in Galatians he says if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit the Amplified says if we claim to live by the Holy Spirit we must also walk by the holy spirit with personal Integrity Godly character and moral courage he said let us go forward walking in line our conduct controlled by the spirit it's not a popular thing to say and I can say it this morning because we don't have any people here that that that are unbelievers as I would call it but if you don't accept that light all that's left is judgment and we preach light and we preach mercy and we preach Grace and we preach love because that's the remedy but if you turn that down God's done everything he can and all that's left is Judgment but he's given us a way out he's told us how we can do it and it's to walk in the light of God's word for today amen not just just a revelation of a man 2,000 years ago that died and gave his life for us and rose from the dead but a revelation of what he's doing today brother Bram said this way he says don't refuse the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which brings the warming rays of the Holy Ghost upon you and makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus don't try to walk in some glare of another age now that glare might have been all right in the other age it might have been all right for them he's not saying it's wrong he's saying it was right for then he says it proved so in the days of our Lord Jesus he was the scriptural light of that day he was the light but he wasn't the light until he come on the earth to vindicate the promised word you know he said there John was a bright and Shining Light and you love to walk in his light for a season John was light for six months that's it but he was light a bright and a Shining Light John flipped the system on its head he came in and he just upended everything he took away the spirituality of the of the priesthood he told the people to repent he's trying to prepare the way and for 6 months he gave them a way out and then he introduced him to the person of the way out the way the truth and the life amen he says here was John on Earth making that written word live he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness he also was preparing the way before the Messiah and Jesus said you love to walk in his light because he was that light bright and Shining Light but he says in John he said now I must decrease my light must go out because why I have served my time that's prophesied of me he ye him he's the one follow him it living in that day it proved this that's why we don't take away from what people believe brother says you come up to a denominational believer build on what they have that's right don't break it all down if all they know is I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior build on that and say have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ take them on to the Holy Ghost and say have you received the Holy Ghost since you've been baptized and if You' got the Holy Ghost has your life been completely changed don't tear it down but take the even the smallest bit of Truth they've got and build on it because they've got a truth that was Truth for its day but it's not the full truth now now cuz the word has continued to move the word keeps moving because it's opening up it's bringing us into the fullness that's bringing us into the maturity of what God wants for this age amen he says now the Jews thought they were worshiping in the True Light they thought they were worshiping this same God that they were turning down the very one that they thought they were worshiping they were crucifying they were making fun of the very God and making him a laughing stock of the people the very God that they thought that they were worshiping we look around this message and the first thing that Believers had to realize was God sent a prophet why because you had to recognize where you were in time and Malachi 45 and 6 and Revelation 3 and the lat of see and age that was all a requirement so we could see where we were at and when you realize where we're at then that focuses you on the word for your day so that you're not living in the glare of another age you're not resting on the truth of another age but you're walking now into the fullness of what God has told is meant for this age that's why I tell people that say well why do you need a prophet because he focuses us on where God is he tells us what's for us so that we're not trying to produce a word that has nothing to do with our age but we're focused on producing the part that belongs to us the part that's written about us the part where our name's written as as a part of our fruit as a part of what we're supposed to manifest in our time remember what brother Braham said he says people are always looking at what God did and they're looking forward to what God will do but they're missing what he's doing right now and what happened is we had people that came and they said God sent a prophet and they preached it for 20 years and they were happy to say I know what time it is scripturally I know the season I'm in but they forgot that he was just a voice pointing to a person that's what he was here to do he was preparing a way he was preparing a bride to meet the bridegroom and so you can sit there and you can be with Eleazar all day long but if you never get in the temp with Isaac Eleazar won't do you any good that's why brother Braham had to die this is just my personal opinion I believe if he would have stayed alive it would have they would have created a denomination around him whether they wanted to or whether he wanted it or not because it was going that way remember the deity spirit and it just went from him to his son we've already seen the results of that it's absolutely a denomination but he had to decrease why he had fulfilled his script scriptural purpose and he was done seals are open he's handed her off to the bridegroom he said my message is to declare him that he's here not that a prophet's here that the son of man is here he said I'm a son of man I'm a prophet declaring the son of man revealing the son of man that's what he was here he was doing a handoff and so we have Believers that have stuck with God sent a prophet and guess what church they can repeat Doctrine like you wouldn't believe they can explain everything like you wouldn't believe and the problem is they never moved on to Christ they fell in love with the prophet's message rather than the person of the prophet's message it's true I've met them I've seen them I know them I pray God's grace to those people but they're stuck in the glare of this message that has since moved on into a true relationship with Christ the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the opening of the word Amen brother bah didn't come to teach us some message catechism I I don't mean to be you know sacriligious but repeating this message is not what makes you a Christian being able to explain Doctrine is not what makes you a member of the bride of Christ that has nothing to do with it you ought to know where you stand but sitting here saying da d da d da d da and paragraph so and so that does not make us a believer that just means we can read and we have a memory cuz the pr could do that and they were white at sepers they were sons of the devil so that's not going to do it and we've turned this message into a Catholic thing where we just repeat things rather than we live things amen but that Prophet came to reveal Christ with us so that we'd recognize him and we'd accept him into our lives and he said you're supposed to do the same things I'm doing not in the same level cuz he's a prophetic gift he's a special vessel he's anointed to do those things but yet we're supposed to produce the same word that he did amen like John the Baptist had to die it had to make way for the person of the word so that he could have the preeminence and so what happens is we haven't moved on some people haven't moved on because we're supposed to come into that second book of Acts where we are led by the spirit that's what I mean by book of Acts see we'll focus on the signs and wonders but scripture says sons of God are led by the spirit of God leadership guidance that's the first thing you need everything else will follow everything else will follow after that get close to God brother Ron Spencer I love what he says when he talks to ministers young ministers starting out he says fall in love with Jesus fall in love with Jesus and the rest will take care of itself the study will come the understanding will come fall in love with Jesus and the rest will take care of it amen what happens you fall in love with a prophet instead of the Christ he came to introduce you can't get along with anybody you can't Fellowship can't go to church everyone's doing something wrong nobody's doing it right nobody's doing it your way and you end up sitting at home with nothing it's the truth because what nobody's preaching what they used to preach 30 years ago and that's the only place you're comfortable is a 30-y old message I'm not sure who I'm saying this to this morning I'll be honest but if we can't live it do we really understand it the way we mean it I don't think so brother Braham says just keep walking don't stand still you'll never get nowhere of course you'll never get nowhere if you're standing still but sometimes that's literally what we're doing Church we're standing still because it's comfortable to stand still God doesn't let us stand still brother said if you're standing still you're backsliding why because Christ is moving on Amen we're talking about our walk talking about what Christ is doing in our lives he says if you've been saved walk to sanctification you say how do you get there just keep walking is the baptism of the Holy Ghost after sanctification how do I get that just keep walking in the light is signs and wonders and miracles just keep walking in the light see so often what we're saying is I'm looking for the next post I'm looking for the next sign I'm looking for the next this and that and the other he says just keep walking just keep walking what happens will happen what's meant for you will happen to you I keep repeating brother Hank's little statement the film has already been recorded you just got to keep walking and when it needs to happen it'll happen just keep walking he says just keep walking in the light see just keep on every time you make a step the light will jump just a little ahead of you he says cuz he's always ahead of you he don't push he leads he says he is the light oh I'm so glad of that aren't you he is the light and in him there is no Darkness we read that scripture that said if if we live by the spirit let us walk in the spirit in other words let our lives reflect our confession Amen Let what we say be what we live if we say we believe the message let us live the message let this word of God come into our lives and shine a light around and light is the most uh discombobulating thing you can get I think in life you know what we don't maybe realize it so much but when you're on TV or these different things you know how much makeup those people are wearing men and women alike because why the light the harsh lights sit under illuminate every flaw every crack in the skin every Every Little Dot every pimple every imperfection under those lights is completely highlighted and so what they do is they actually have to over paint them put way more makeup on them that under normal light would look ridiculous when they put it under that harsh light it actually looks normal because the lights are so powerful but we sit under the harshness of the light of the world word sometimes it's embarrassing sometimes isn't it when the word comes down and it says look at that it's tough but we've got to do it willingly sit there and let the word go to Discerning inside in each and every one of our Lives Illuminating it the good and the bad when it's good we say praise the Lord but when it's bad we need to say praise the Lord as well because he's highlighting it for a purpose' amen this is one of my favorite scriptures says but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light the Amplified and this is a a newer version actually says everything exposed to light is revealed clearly for what it is so if it shows bad it's bad if it shows good it's good and church if it shows there's nothing there guess what there's nothing there it is what it is and light is what proves what's really there amen like I said sometimes it's embarrassing I remember sitting in in Services when we've had visiting ministers and and it just felt like God came in and just opened the door and just put a a 10,000 watt flood light in a room and said what about this son and you sit there and you feel naked but guess what that's what light does for a child of God's life it says this is the real condition you know it's funny I uh I had a BMW sports car back in Alberta and when I bought it the guy had rubbed it along a a a traffic cone and he'd scraped up the edge of the edge of the uh the door and he put a little crease in it and when I sold the car I said there's a crease in the door you know there's there's a flaw on the door but you know what I didn't want anybody to do look real close at it because it was going to cost them a lot more money to fix it than they probably realized and I just lived with it and so when a guy came to look at it I took him out for a ride the car was in good condition that and I show him the door I said now here's here's that spot I was looking at and he looked at it and he said yeah I get rid of that I thought in my head no you can't no you can't and if he' looked at it in a strong light he' to realize there's a flaw there that's going to take a lot more work that's what the word of God does the Discerning of the word of God comes in and it says this is deeper than you thought there's more here than you realized and we're going to have to dig deep to fix this we like to gloss things over smooth it out ah it's just that's a family trait you know we this this is generational we all have this no no no no the word is here to set us free right I've said before Satan dwells in shame I got a quote it's not here I'll bring it next service he said Satan hates light Satan and the devil Satan and his demons hate light because it exposes them for exactly what's going on Amen you know what we like to we like to gloss over it but the simple fact is this if it ain't God it ain't God it's that simple and what is it really then it's carnality Paul said I Die daily and if the prophet of the age if the first church age Messer had to Die daily and allow the washing of the water of the word the light of the word the working of the holy spirit in his life how much more do you and I need it amen every single day that we've got to be able to say Lord just let the light shine in our lives but I'll tell you this I'm going to give you a pat on the back this morning you know what I love about this church how many times I'll walk out those doors and somebody come up to me and say that's exactly where I am that's exactly what I needed that's exactly what I've been dealing with and you don't try and hide that shows a maturity that shows an honesty that shows a sincerity I have prayed for people with needs that I don't know how in the world they had the courage to come up and talk about it but I say God bless you I say God bless you because that's what it's going to take that's what it's going to take as a people that will humble themselves to the word of God and say this is me Lord that's me that's where I am that's my problem now I'm giving it to you for the answer I so appreciate that in this church it shows real character in the people don't lose that there's no embarrassment you come up for prayer I don't tell a soul I don't talk to my wife I don't talk to my Minister friends I don't talk to anybody it's between me and you and God don't ever think it's going to come out but don't ever lose that simple sincerity and honesty before God because that's what this preaching of the word is supposed to do it's supposed to be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart to what get you into True Light to get you into word condition to get you into rapturing condition and some people have run from that oh so and so told Brother John or this no no no that's the Holy Spirit God is my witness God is my witness this morning if you can't handle the Holy Spirit Discerning things in your life you need to leave cuz it'll be judgment if you keep sitting here God's grace to us a one every one of us amen I'm not talking about little things I'm talking about big things not complimentary things people that have serious serious issues and when the word Goes Forth they step up to it and they say I want that I want to live where that is I shared this quote in the in the in the church WhatsApp group there but I know not all of us are on there brother Braham said this the very first step to successful Christianity how many want to be successful in their Christian walk amen and to show that man has receive the holy spirit is h u m i l i t y humility he says it's humility real god-given humility that it must be given humbly cuz there's a man-made humility there's a false humility and there's a real god-given humility what is it it's a surrender to what the word says you are so that you can become what the word says you are cuz we're in a condition here we're not in rapturing condition yet we're getting ready and that means there's bumps it means there's flaws it means there's faults it means there's there's isms and little things that have caught on to our lives amen but we've got to be able to say in order to get there I've got to realize I'm not there and when the light comes in it's to move us the next step forward that's what the light's doing remember he says as you come to here the light moves forward and says all right come here and you got to step there and to step there you got to realize you can't stay where you were the step is a changing of position it's a changing of your order it's a changing of your placing so you got to keep walking as the light moves and you step there and then it reveals another thing and another thing and another thing this this big step of a Rapture is many tiny little steps church and we've got to take them day by day like I've said before if you think there's just going to be this sudden massive swell of the Holy Spirit and all of us will leave I this is my opinion I believe you're sincerely wrong because I believe that we're being caught up day by day just a little bit more just a little bit more and that last step will be the littlest and it'll be the easiest it'll just seem a natural thing like Enoch he just started walking and one day he started walking I can't do it cuz I'm not eating but he started walking and when his foot went to there it didn't go to the ground oh that's firm ground and then the other folk came up and he just kept walking walking walking into the presence of God in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we'll catch it and we'll say this is it and we'll be gone but what this coming into the light is a willful act we've got to do that we've got to step into it amen not shrink away from it Paul said in Ephesians he says for ye were sometimes and Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light Live Like You're a Believer live like you're a Christian Live Like You're Christ because that's what you are don't talk it only but live it don't muck around with Darkness run to the light and stay there brother brah said and God's got the Holy Ghost tonight for every believer that wants to receive it we've got anointed preachers in the land that preaches it daily and nightly but it's the people's own stubborn way that they love Darkness better than light that they'd rather live in the world than to walk in the light walk in the Gospel Light he says oh people you don't know what a pleasure it is to walk in the light the light of the Lord Jesus and have fellowship with him it's glory Divine to have fellowship with the Holy Spirit catch this now you cannot have fellowship with the world and with the Holy Spirit at the same time can I read it again you cannot have fellowship with the world world and with the Holy Spirit at the same time you've got to abstain from the things of the world what does that look like brother John live clean honorable upright and holy and then the holy spirit will dwell with you and will work with you what does that look like he will perform Miracles through you he will heal you give you joy peace and love and longsuffering goodness gentleness patience and faith if you will walk in God's way there's plenty of holy spirit amen who wants God to do more in their life live clean abstain set it aside don't muck around with it don't dabble in it don't try and sanctify it it is what it is church leave it alone God help us to stay separated God help us to keep coming back here feeding on this amen there's a fountain open amen an unending Supply and it's clean all the time you'll never get filthy with this it'll never do you harm it's always for your good and it'll always bring you closer to God Amen stay with that and you'll start to see the good things of God coming through in your life feed on the right things fellowship with the right people dwell on the right things it's bound to produce amen God help us to welcome that light of the Holy Spirit moving in our lives brother John Andy shared this quotee a little earlier in the week and I told him I was going to put it in the service he says you might go through life living a good Christian Life you might belong to some church you might have a fine membership you might be a moral character and all of that but brother that still is in Christianity Christianity is when the Holy Ghost has taken full possession of you and you're led by the Holy Spirit that's bringing down to rubber meets the road isn't it when the Holy Spirit has taken full possession of of you and you're led by it we're going to talk about this a little more on Wednesday night Lord willing about what it looks like when the Holy Spirit leads us when we live in that light day by day because we're in the darkest time in history remember when brother bam Drew out when the angel sorry Drew out the seven Church ages when he came to the seventh brother Bram said it was complete darkness when the angel drew it there was no light in leoa and brother Braham says I added in a little bit to represent what the bride but the angel didn't put it there there was no light and I believe that's a reflection of what happens to the bride she's taken out of it amen but there is so little light here it's a gross darkness and all we've got is a little light each one now if you're in a little room with a little light that'll do okay but when you're in a big world with a little light that light is almost useless people can see the light light but that's about it that's all we're trying to be is a little light just a little light so people can come and say how'd you get that how come you're different than I am you know it gets uncomfortable in life you know the more we spend at work and we've got to be back two days a week and that you spend time around with people you realize very quickly we are not the same and it gets very uncomfortable at times because even if you don't say anything your life is such a contrast to what they think is right to what they think is good and it can be uncomfortable because they're talking about things and they're doing things and they're looking at you and they're saying oh right John doesn't do that brother Bob doesn't do that brother Grant doesn't do that right and it puts you in awkward positions and we've got to have courage to still be the light to not shrink back to not dial the wick down turn it up turn it up you know I I if nothing else people ought to be able to look at our families and see there's a benefit to being the way they are cuz almost everybody now agrees sorry young people that we're we're really sliding downhill quickly that Society is sliding down quickly and they love the fact that they can see young men and women that can be honest that can be polite that can be sane cannot give their parents a ton of trouble that aren going around getting pregnant at 15 16 17 all these different things they can look at that and they can say they're different but they've got some benefits to that we have not to shrink from those things I'm proud I'm proud of my daughter I'm proud of what my boys are doing and Jonathan as he grows up in these different things and I talk to people about it so that they can see we're different they see I'm different but I want them to see this is not just a generational thing this is a God thing amen that the light can be lit in a young person just as much as it can an older person amen but we've got to let it happen Moses saw a light from a distance he saw a fire burning and he went up to see what it was and then God called him closer and Moses had to willingly walk close to that fire and God revealed some things about Moses cuz you'll notice Moses starts to see his flaws and failures in that light but here's the thing Church it never stopped God lord I stutter doesn't matter I'll give you a mouthpiece Lord I this doesn't matter I've made a way Lord I that doesn't matter Moses just go in my word in my strength I'll take care of it Lord I'm just a shepherd with a staff let me use the staff you got then let me show you what I can do with a staff when I start using it instead of you start using it Moses and Moses never got in trouble until he started using that staff for his own will when he let God use it God used that staff staff to deliver a people out of a out of a country that was far greater than they were brother Braham says it this way he says why brother if we'd ever come in the presence of God like Moses did why it was revolutionary to him in the light of that angel of God standing there on that mountain that day everything he once had or thought never would happen come to be a reality Moses knew he was a deliverer or Moses thought he was a deliver Moses been told he was a Believer Moses has been told told he would had a purpose and then he tried to make it happen and it all just fell it crumbled he made a mess of things and now he's out for 40 years running for his life in the backside of the desert but when he comes into that presence all of a sudden God makes a reality the things that Moses had been told and believed but it came into the light to reveal that God said now I'm going to go with you sometimes we hear so much over the pulpit and in the reading of our Bible or the listening to the message and we say well I ought to do this and I ought to do that no get in his presence and everything that you need to do will follow afterwards everything because God's got to go with you God's got to send you God's got to be with you and if he's not with you you're not going to get anywhere you're going to be dead in the water making a mess of things he says everything he once had or thought would happen come to be a reality and I think if men and women today would ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit under the unction of God's spirit and the light of God's word everything that's an absolute Church everything that God has promised will illuminate to you and be real again amen let's stand together if the musicians would come he says we've got to come into that light church and our prayer time devotions and service wherever it is we've got to come in and we've got to be honest before God we've got to come in and say Lord Lord here I am here I am such as I am not make excuses you can say Lord I got a stutter Lord I have trouble talking to people about you Lord I clam up when people ask me about this and that and the other thing Lord I'm struggling to fellowship with that brother and sister Lord I'm struggling with the ministry Lord I'm struggling with my parents Lord I'm struggling with my attitude I know what I think on a daily basis Church it ain't always good I know the thoughts I have I know the preconceived notions I have and I've got to be able to take that into my prayer with God and sayl here's the lumps but what I'm hoping he'll see is my heart that in all of those lumps and all of that carnality and all of those failures is a heart that desires to serve him and so I don't hide but I bring it into the light if I know there's a problem I've got to bring it into the light but if I won't bring it then he'll send the word and the world will bring a light no matter what but if we can come in and say Lord I'm trusting you'll look at my heart and realize I don't want to be like this Lord I don't want to do this I don't want to have this attitude I don't want to have this problem I don't want to have this friction then he's bound to come down and say I'll take that out let the light come in clear it all out you know I don't think we have this because we have wonderful house wives that that that keep our homes clean but sometimes we have a closet and we just throw things in the closet the rooms are spectacular but sometimes we have the closet and anything that doesn't have a place we put in the closet and you know what we'll find we have a lot of things that don't have a place and so we throw them into the closet and what happens we've got one of these we call it a storage closet but it's really a a jumble of things and so what happens eventually is you get tired of looking at it so you un screw the light bulb so nobody knows what's in there and you just throw things in blindly and then what happens one day is you forget how bad it is and you send somebody down to get something from there and they open the door and it all tumbles out and it hits them you know what sometimes we're walking through life and somebody opens our closet door and a bunch of bumps and lumps hit them don't they and we say oops forgot about that it's just God shine a light church just God saying come on now there's no place for that in your life why you even storing it get rid of it if it doesn't have a place now it'll never have a place in the future because you're going to grow and mature if there's no place for it now just get rid of it deal with it then sometimes the room is already it's there it's clean it's just no good because we have nothing in there an empty room does us no good sometimes God's got to show the light to say hey let's put something in this room let's make it useful let's take this part of your life that you've cleaned out now and let's put something in here that'll be a benefit to the body of Believers let's add something in that'll help somebody on their Journey you know in our house we've got that little Suite downstairs where visitors and ministers stay in that sometimes that's what we need as a place for somebody else in our life where they can come in and take a rest when they're in our presence when they're around us that they can get something from us that they can't get from anybody else but it takes the light of the Holy Spirit to turn that on and say hey let's start adding in now your life's clean you're good let's start adding in let's start Furnishing the dwelling place for the benefit of the body of Believers in our life amen Church the key is don't shrink from light don't step back sometimes it's like I said it's embarrassing it hurts it's painful we say I ought not to even be dealing with this I'm so far up the road and yet I still deal with this or I I deal with this now don't shrink from that say Lord here I am again you've dealt with me before deal with me now let the light do its work and bring forth what the life of the word of Christ inside of you amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we don't want to shrink back from your word this morning Lord what a sweet presence you started this service with this morning and Lord I'm trusting that that atmosphere is going to move in hearts Lord that we won't pull back from where your word shines a light Lord when it seems like everything is bare before you where there's no hiding Lord that we would not put on a religious garment a religious spirit Lord that we just say Lord that's right that's me Lord and we go to you for the great remedy Lord you never show us an issue but what you bring the remedy along with it Lord you grant us Grace you give us favor Your Love Shines on us Lord your mercies are new every day Lord we can't exhaust them Lord I just pray your Holy Spirit would have its way in our lives Lord God Lord help us to be honest to be sincere before you Lord each one of us
