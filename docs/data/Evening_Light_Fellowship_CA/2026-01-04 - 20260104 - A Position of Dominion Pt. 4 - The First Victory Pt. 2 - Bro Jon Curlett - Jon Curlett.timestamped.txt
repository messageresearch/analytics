[32:56] thank [music] you, Lord. Thank you,
[33:02] Lord. [music]
[33:06] If I had a thousand lives to [singing]
[33:10] live,
[33:12] I live them all for you, Lord. You've
[33:17] [music] been so good to me. [singing]
[33:23] That is the least
[33:25] I [music] could afford.
[33:28] You make [singing] good times outnumber
[33:32] the bad.
[33:34] You've been the best [music] friend I've
[33:37] ever had. Amen. I want to thank you,
[33:43] Lord.
[33:45] Thank you, Lord. [music]
[33:50] I just want to thank [music] you Lord
[33:56] for every time [singing]
[33:58] [music] you heard my prayer.
[34:01] Just want to thank him for always
[34:08] [music] being there.
[34:12] When I was so down [music]
[34:15] and down, you came along [singing]
[34:20] and made me want to shout. I just want
[34:24] to thank you, [music]
[34:27] Lord.
[34:28] Thank you, Lord. [music] If I had a
[34:32] thousand new lives
[34:35] and [singing] a thousand lives to
[34:38] [music] live, I'd live them all.
[34:42] for you, Lord. [music] You've been so
[34:46] good to me.
[34:50] That is the least [music]
[34:53] I could afford. [singing]
[34:56] You've made good times outnumber [music]
[34:59] the bad. You've been the best friend
[35:04] I've ever had.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:06] &gt;&gt; I just want to thank you Lord.
[35:12] Thank you Lord.
[35:18] Amen. And the word says if we were to
[35:20] thank him from the rising of the sun
[35:22] instead of going down the same we
[35:23] wouldn't sufficiently thank him. Amen.
[35:27] But we try.
[35:29] 11:39 Jesus you're the sweetest name of
[35:32] all.
[35:38] Let's stand.
[35:40] Jesus,
[35:43] you're the sweetest [singing]
[35:46] name of all. [music]
[35:49] Jesus,
[35:52] you [music and singing] always hear me
[35:54] when I call.
[35:58] Jesus,
[36:00] [music] you lift me up each time I fall.
[36:05] You're the sweetest. [music]
[36:07] Amen.
[36:09] Name along.
[36:12] Hallelujah.
[36:14] Jesus, [music]
[36:16] you're the sweetest name of all. [music]
[36:22] Jesus,
[36:24] you always hear me when I call. [music]
[36:28] Praise the Lord. Jesus,
[36:32] you lift [singing] me up each time I
[36:35] [music] fall. You're the sweetest,
[36:39] sweetest name of all [music]
[36:45] and Jesus.
[36:47] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[36:56] you always [singing] hear me when I
[36:59] call. [music]
[37:01] Jesus,
[37:03] you lift [singing] me up each time I
[37:07] fall. You're the sweetest,
[37:10] the sweetest [music and singing]
[37:12] name of all.
[37:15] Amen. Heavenly Father,
[37:19] Lord, you are our resting place this
[37:20] morning.
[37:22] Lord, we're not resting in our
[37:24] discipline or our works or our good
[37:26] nature,
[37:28] Lord. We're not resting in our
[37:30] rightness, Lord. We're resting in your
[37:32] grace, Lord. We're resting in the fact
[37:34] that you've called us and we have
[37:36] answered, Lord, that you have a purpose
[37:38] and a plan for our life, Lord. And that
[37:40] plan cannot be uh frustrated, Lord.
[37:43] cannot be stopped, Lord, because you've
[37:45] declared it by your word. So, Lord,
[37:47] we're standing on your word this
[37:49] morning, not on anything we've done,
[37:50] Lord. We're living by your grace this
[37:52] morning, Lord, by the life that you've
[37:54] given us by your Holy Spirit dwelling in
[37:56] us, Lord. That's our rest. That's our
[37:58] comfort. That's our peace, our security
[38:00] this morning, Lord God. Lord, and I'm
[38:02] asking for your spirit once again, Lord,
[38:04] to speak to your bride that's gathered
[38:05] here, Lord, this flock, Lord, that you
[38:07] would minister to our lives and our
[38:09] souls, Lord, our bodies, Lord, our
[38:11] minds, whatever we have need of this
[38:13] morning, Lord. You know where the need
[38:14] is, Lord. I pray that your word would be
[38:16] directed to the need this morning. Lord,
[38:19] speak to your sheep, Lord. We pray.
[38:21] Lord, bless [music] the people now. We
[38:22] ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[38:25] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you
[38:27] would to the Gospel of John, the first
[38:30] chapter. Amen. Good to be here this
[38:33] morning. Just to reconfirm, I believe
[38:34] Brother Bob mentioned we'll have the
[38:36] church votes for the different offices
[38:38] on January 5th. That's Sunday. The
[38:40] Thursday before, we'll have a business
[38:42] meeting and all uh eligible voters are
[38:45] able to come to that business meeting.
[38:46] Brother Mark, our treasurer, will go
[38:48] through the finances of the last year in
[38:50] detail. you can ask your questions there
[38:52] and then he'll do a very short uh well
[38:54] maybe not but it'll be a shorter
[38:57] synopsis on the Sunday after we have the
[38:59] vote. Um and so he'll kind of give some
[39:01] updates there. So we want to remember
[39:03] those in prayer. We've got special
[39:05] meetings coming up next weekend with
[39:06] brother Aaron Oglesby. So, no service on
[39:09] Wednesday, but we'll have service on
[39:10] Friday, Saturday, Sunday with a
[39:13] breakfast on Saturday morning and a
[39:15] fellowship Sunday afternoon in the
[39:17] fellowship hall with food for those that
[39:19] are able to make it as well. So, keep
[39:20] them in prayer. Trust that he'll finally
[39:22] get here. Third, third try is the charm.
[39:24] Amen. He's had trouble getting here in
[39:26] the last two times, so we're trusting
[39:27] that now is the time and that the Lord
[39:29] will bless those things. Amen. It's good
[39:32] to have Sister Justine back. Amen. God
[39:34] bless you and welcome our visitor here
[39:36] this morning. God bless you, sir. Amen.
[39:38] John chapter 1, let's read the first uh
[39:40] we actually read a little more than I
[39:42] have here this morning. And he says, "In
[39:43] the beginning was the word. The word was
[39:45] with God, and the word was God. The same
[39:48] was in the beginning with God. All
[39:50] things were made by him, and without him
[39:52] was not anything made that was made. In
[39:55] him was life, and the life was the light
[39:57] of men. And the light shineth in
[39:59] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[40:02] it not." Let's go down to verse 9, if
[40:04] you would. He said that was the true
[40:06] light. Speaking of Christ, which lightth
[40:08] every man that cometh into the world, he
[40:11] was in the world, and the world was made
[40:12] by him, and the world knew him not. He
[40:15] came unto his own, and his own received
[40:16] him not. But as many as received him, to
[40:19] them gave he power to become the sons of
[40:22] God, even to them that believe on his
[40:25] name, which were born not of blood, nor
[40:28] of the will of the flesh, nor of the
[40:30] will of man, but of God. There are
[40:32] people that accepted him and their birth
[40:34] was not because daddy and mommy decided
[40:36] it. It was that they were ordained by
[40:38] God to do it to to be here to receive
[40:41] his word. It says now in verse 14, "And
[40:44] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[40:46] us and we beheld his glory." The glory
[40:49] as of the only begotten of the father,
[40:51] full of two things, grace and truth.
[40:54] Grace because we didn't deserve it and
[40:56] truth because that's what would take us
[40:58] back into him. Amen. God bless you. You
[40:59] can have your seats this morning. I want
[41:01] to continue this series that we've been
[41:03] preaching on our Sunday mornings called
[41:05] a position of dominion. And I want to
[41:07] take a second service on this thought of
[41:09] the first victory. And it's been a
[41:11] couple of weeks since I preached this
[41:12] first part since we've had the Christmas
[41:14] program and different things going on
[41:16] and some services missed and whatnot. So
[41:18] I I I want to just recap that quickly
[41:20] for those that weren't here or maybe for
[41:22] those that have forgotten what we
[41:23] preached on. But the the last time we
[41:25] preached on this thought of the first
[41:26] victory, we preached out of Genesis 1
[41:28] and uh where God said, "Let there be
[41:30] light." And there was light. But I want
[41:33] us to step back a bit this morning
[41:35] because we need to recognize what
[41:37] happened there because the first victory
[41:39] we see in the scripture is that God said
[41:41] something that was contrary to what was
[41:44] happening on this earth. He spoke
[41:46] something that was completely different
[41:49] than what the world was like at that
[41:51] time. When God spoke, it was to change
[41:54] the status quo.
[41:56] It had been that way for a long time. I
[42:00] mean, I want you to look into your life.
[42:01] There are some things we're dealing with
[42:02] this morning, and it's the status quo.
[42:06] It hasn't changed in forever. Brother
[42:08] Grant's with me already.
[42:11] There are things that need to be changed
[42:14] that haven't changed.
[42:17] And God in his time and in his season,
[42:20] remember the scripture starts with, "And
[42:22] the earth was without form and void. It
[42:24] was in chaos. It had no no order to it.
[42:27] Things were just the way they were
[42:30] completely covered up." The whole earth
[42:32] was covered in water. But God came down
[42:34] and God said, "Let there be light." And
[42:37] what he spoke was completely contrary to
[42:40] the natural state of this earth. Why?
[42:43] because he had a different purpose, a
[42:45] different condition that was intended
[42:47] for the earth than what it was in at
[42:49] that moment. God had a plan for it. God
[42:53] had a place for it. God had a time for
[42:55] it. God wanted it to produce something.
[42:57] And he started it out by saying, "Let
[43:00] there be light." Because it was complete
[43:02] darkness. There was no light whatsoever.
[43:05] Amen. And when we see that he spoke, he
[43:07] did not just speak words so he could
[43:09] hear them to in his ears. He wasn't just
[43:11] talking to himself. But God spoke a
[43:14] creative word that would change the
[43:16] status quo of this earth. He was going
[43:19] to change the way it had always been
[43:21] into the way that he had ordained it to
[43:23] be. Hallelujah. Can you catch it this
[43:25] morning? Amen. That's a very powerful
[43:27] thought to understand this morning.
[43:29] Because if you can put yourself in the
[43:32] creative word of God, then you'll
[43:35] understand that the status quo means
[43:37] nothing in the big picture. When we look
[43:39] into the eternal, when we see the
[43:42] thoughts of God, the plans of God,
[43:44] they're for our good thoughts of peace.
[43:47] Amen. If we can see what he has said
[43:50] about us, then we do not look at the way
[43:52] it is. We look at the way that he said
[43:55] it's going to be. And we can take
[43:56] thought, we can take we can take comfort
[43:58] from that. We can take rest from that.
[44:00] We can take peace from that because no
[44:02] matter what it is now, it has to be what
[44:05] he says because the creative word of God
[44:07] cannot return to him. Boy, the scripture
[44:09] says, "Amen." Church, if you are a child
[44:12] of God, predestinated from before the
[44:15] foundation of the world to be here, you
[44:19] cannot lose.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; You cannot lose. Amen. You may lose a
[44:24] battle,
[44:25] but you cannot lose the war. Why?
[44:28] Because the unfailing creative word of
[44:30] God has to produce what he said it was
[44:33] going to produce. Amen. We have
[44:34] setbacks. We have days where we feel
[44:37] like a Christian. We have days where we
[44:38] feel like we're not a Christian. We have
[44:40] ups and downs. We have ins and outs.
[44:42] That doesn't matter from the eternal.
[44:44] That doesn't matter. What matters is the
[44:46] finished product. What happens all the
[44:48] way in the end when God has to do with
[44:49] it. What we see today has nothing to do
[44:52] with eternity. It is just a process to
[44:53] get us where God wants us to be. Amen.
[44:56] God's already made a way for you by his
[44:58] creative word to get you to an expected
[45:00] end. That's what the scripture says. The
[45:02] thoughts of God are towards us to bring
[45:04] us to an expected end. That first
[45:06] victory that we see in the scripture was
[45:08] light was created. And remember that
[45:10] light was not the sun and the moon and
[45:12] the stars. Those were created and
[45:13] positioned on the fourth day. Amen. The
[45:16] first light that was created was the
[45:17] light of God. It was the dwelling place
[45:19] of God. We preached on it many times. I
[45:21] won't preach on it again, but that light
[45:23] was the dwelling place of God. And God
[45:26] took all that he was and he poured it
[45:28] into the attribute of light. Yes, sir.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; He poured it into what we would call the
[45:33] shikina glory, the pillar of fire. And
[45:36] we see this in our scripture that we
[45:38] read at the beginning where it says in
[45:39] the beginning was the word. Remember the
[45:42] scripture says, "Thy word is a lamp unto
[45:44] my feet and a light unto my path." The
[45:46] word spoken by God is the light. He says
[45:49] the word was with God, the word was God.
[45:51] It came out of God and then God stepped
[45:53] into it
[45:54] &gt;&gt; and the word became God. He says the
[45:56] same was in the beginning with God. All
[45:58] things were made by him. What? The
[46:00] light.
[46:02] The life of God dwelling in light. He
[46:04] says and without him was not anything
[46:06] made that was made. In him was one thing
[46:10] life. And the life was the light of man.
[46:13] And the light shineth in darkness,
[46:15] present tense. And the darkness, it
[46:17] says, comprehended it not. We look in
[46:20] the in the scriptures in Genesis where
[46:22] it says that the spirit of God moved
[46:24] over the earth and then it spoke.
[46:27] Okay, that was the great eternal spirit
[46:29] of God. Jeho or the the Elohim, the
[46:32] self-existing one and he was without
[46:34] form in the beginning as well. He wasn't
[46:37] he existed but he wasn't visible but
[46:38] when he said let there be light, the
[46:41] first thing he did was make something
[46:43] visible and then he attached himself to
[46:45] that light because that was his
[46:47] attribute.
[46:49] Amen. So that attribute to to make
[46:52] things visible is the attribute of God.
[46:54] And it's what we call light. And it says
[46:56] that light was life because once it came
[46:59] out, life followed that life. That
[47:02] light. When that light was created, then
[47:05] life came forth. The scripture says all
[47:06] things were created by him that were
[47:09] created. Amen. In that form, in that
[47:11] pillar of fire. And so in him was life.
[47:13] And so light of God brings out life.
[47:17] Light of God produces life. Light
[47:20] carries life, we could say, when we're
[47:21] talking about the light of God. Amen.
[47:24] But we look at this first and greatest
[47:26] attribute of God in verse five and look
[47:28] what's happening because it's the most
[47:30] powerful thing for us to recognize is
[47:32] the victory that comes from the presence
[47:34] of God in your life. Amen. Listen to
[47:38] this. Remember verse 5 says, "The light
[47:40] shineth in darkness and the darkness
[47:41] comprehended not." If you go deeper into
[47:43] it, look at what the amplified says. It
[47:45] says the light shines on in the
[47:48] darkness. It does not stop shining for
[47:50] the darkness has never overpowered it.
[47:55] It has never overcome it. Amen. Darkness
[47:57] has never overpowered light. It doesn't
[48:00] matter how much darkness you have. You
[48:03] can take a little bit of light and it
[48:04] will conquer the greatest darkness.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take much light to conquer
[48:08] darkness. It just takes a light. That's
[48:11] all you got to have a spark. The
[48:13] littlest light is most effective in the
[48:16] greatest darkness.
[48:18] Hallelujah.
[48:19] We might be little lights this morning
[48:21] in this great darkness of this world,
[48:23] but that's what makes us so much more
[48:25] powerful today. When there's lots of
[48:27] light, a little light does no good. But
[48:28] when there's only darkness, little
[48:29] lights are all that's needed. Amen. The
[48:32] only way that darkness can win is for
[48:34] light to cease to exist.
[48:38] Amen.
[48:39] That's hard for us to contemplate. But
[48:41] as children of God, the light that's
[48:43] here is us. Amen.
[48:46] And once we go,
[48:49] all that's left is darkness. There's no
[48:52] light left. We're at the end of the
[48:54] gentile plan of God, the redemptive plan
[48:57] for the Gentiles of God. And once he
[48:58] takes his bride away, all that's left is
[49:01] darkness. And this world will go into
[49:03] tribulation because there's no light
[49:05] anymore. We're so close to the end. And
[49:08] we can see darkness pressing in, can't
[49:10] we? We look around this world and
[49:12] everything this world is doing is
[49:14] darkness. And as a Christian, we can see
[49:17] what they're doing. And it makes no
[49:19] sense what they're doing because it's
[49:21] pressing into immorality that makes no
[49:23] sense. Immorality that is
[49:24] self-destructive
[49:26] policies, politics, society, church,
[49:28] nothing is sacred anymore. Nothing is
[49:31] right. Nothing is righteous. Nothing is
[49:33] good. And we look at it and we say, "How
[49:34] can you not see this?" But what is it?
[49:36] It is darkness pressing in. Why? Because
[49:39] they've rejected the light. That's the
[49:42] unfortunate truth is they've rejected
[49:43] the light. And so everyone's relying on
[49:45] change and hope to change things to make
[49:50] things better. But the problem is this.
[49:52] Our natural condition is selfish and
[49:55] selfishness is always destructive. And
[49:58] so the hope that we have is that we can
[50:00] change our nature because we'll never
[50:02] change this world.
[50:04] We're never going to fix this world.
[50:05] That's why it has to be destroyed.
[50:07] That's what tribulation's about. That's
[50:08] what the fire of God is for is to change
[50:12] this old world back and he'll restore it
[50:13] again. But what he can do is change this
[50:16] nature. And that's what helps us
[50:18] overcome the world. We'll never change
[50:20] the world. We'll overcome the world.
[50:22] That's the requirement for the believer.
[50:24] But you know, I was speaking to someone
[50:25] after I I preached this first service
[50:27] and they said, "I don't really get where
[50:29] you're going with this because what?
[50:31] We're dealing with real issues, aren't
[50:33] we? we're dealing with real issues. It's
[50:36] hard to say uh the light will conquer
[50:38] when young men are dealing with lust.
[50:40] When we've got a mind battle going on,
[50:42] when our attitude is so poor that we
[50:44] can't be around anybody, when our jobs
[50:46] are stressing us out. When things
[50:48] company our company aren't going so
[50:49] good, whatever it might be. And brother
[50:51] John's up there preaching about life.
[50:52] What's that going to do for me? But
[50:55] you've got to understand the process
[50:56] that God uses to bring victory. You've
[51:00] got to understand what he's trying to
[51:01] do. But it can seem a bit academic when
[51:03] we're talking about light. Amen. But you
[51:05] have to see that the battle you face
[51:07] every time is the same. It is light
[51:09] against darkness. It is life against
[51:13] death. It is the word against reason.
[51:17] It's the same thing every time. And what
[51:19] God's trying to do is get us to see what
[51:22] the battle is and how we can overcome
[51:24] it. Amen. Look what Paul said about his
[51:26] conversion experience. The Apostle Paul
[51:28] wrote most of the New Testament. He
[51:29] says, and he's talking about when he was
[51:31] on the road to Damascus and remember a
[51:33] light knocked him off of his horse. And
[51:36] he's laying on the ground looking up and
[51:37] he says, I said, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[51:39] He says that to the light.
[51:42] And the light said, "I am Jesus whom
[51:44] thou persecutest." He says, "But rise
[51:47] and stand upon thy feet, for I have
[51:49] appeared unto thee for this purpose, to
[51:51] make thee a minister and a witness both
[51:53] of these things which thou hast seen and
[51:55] of these things in in the which I will
[51:57] appear unto thee, delivering thee from
[51:59] the people and from the Gentiles unto
[52:01] whom I now send thee." Now catch this.
[52:03] He says to open their eyes
[52:06] and to turn them from darkness to light
[52:09] and from the power of Satan unto God
[52:12] that they may receive forgiveness of
[52:14] sins and inheritance among them which
[52:16] are sanctified by faith that is in me.
[52:18] Says I'm going to do three things it
[52:20] seems like or maybe two. Open their
[52:21] eyes, turn their eyes from darkness to
[52:23] light and from the power of Satan unto
[52:25] God. But when you look at the original
[52:27] language, it doesn't say and it says
[52:29] that. So in other words, it would look
[52:32] like this. To open their eyes that they
[52:34] may turn from darkness to light and from
[52:37] the power of Satan unto God. So no
[52:38] matter what you're dealing with in your
[52:41] life, it's always the same battle. It's
[52:43] light versus darkness.
[52:45] It's the word versus everything else.
[52:47] It's Satan versus God. There's no
[52:50] there's no difference between those
[52:51] battles. They're all going to be exactly
[52:53] the same thing. So deliverance comes by
[52:56] sight.
[52:58] It comes by light. You can't see without
[53:01] light. I don't know if you've noticed
[53:02] this. You can't see in a dark room, but
[53:04] it takes light for you to see. Amen. So,
[53:06] sight comes from light.
[53:09] Faith comes by hearing. And hearing
[53:12] what? By the word.
[53:18] It's going to take light to take us out
[53:19] of the power of Satan into the power of
[53:21] God. And you'll never see things clearly
[53:23] until you see it by the word.
[53:28] How many of you had a situation and we
[53:30] were looking externally the whole time
[53:33] and then God opens his word up to us and
[53:35] all of a sudden we realize, hey, I'm the
[53:38] problem. I remember I was at work and we
[53:41] were doing some leadership training.
[53:43] Funnest thing in the world, leadership
[53:44] training.
[53:45] And they were talking about resolving
[53:47] conflicts and they said, you know, when
[53:49] somebody has a conflict with you, how do
[53:52] you approach it? And people gave a bunch
[53:54] of answers and and and finally I said I
[53:56] said I look and see if maybe I'm the
[53:58] problem.
[54:01] Now that's a big step for a curlet
[54:05] because I don't know if you know the
[54:06] kurletes for those that don't know me my
[54:08] last name is kurlet. Kurletes
[54:10] automatically assume we're right. It's
[54:12] built into us.
[54:15] That's just our nature.
[54:17] Germans we always think we're right.
[54:21] But over time, God has worked on me to
[54:23] the point where I have to realize
[54:25] sometimes I make mistakes.
[54:27] Sometimes John's the problem. And it was
[54:31] funny because at that time I was dealing
[54:33] with a massive issue with a guy at my
[54:35] work whose whose responsibilities they
[54:37] had assigned to me because he was in a
[54:38] conflict of interest and he hated me for
[54:39] it. He was constantly going after me and
[54:41] I was kept trying to to to make things
[54:43] better and do things better and it
[54:45] nothing seemed to work. But I was I was
[54:46] in prayer about it and I said, "Lord, is
[54:48] there anything I'm doing that is making
[54:50] this worse? Is there anything I need to
[54:53] clean up?" So when they were talking to
[54:54] me about leadership and resolving
[54:56] conflict, I said, "The first thing I
[54:57] look at is, am I the part of the
[54:59] problem?" And the person looked at me
[55:00] and they said, "I've never heard anybody
[55:02] ever say that to me."
[55:05] But what does it take? It takes the word
[55:07] to come in and I've got to open up my
[55:10] life so that he can come in and shine
[55:12] the light cuz maybe I've got an attitude
[55:15] problem. Maybe I've got a pride problem.
[55:18] Maybe I've got some issues I need to
[55:19] work through as well. And so it takes
[55:21] him to do that. So the the deliverance
[55:24] that we need comes from the light of the
[55:27] word of God. Young man, you're dealing
[55:29] with lust. What's the answer? Let the
[55:32] word shine into your life.
[55:36] When you got a bad attitude,
[55:38] what's the answer? Let the word shine
[55:40] into your life. When you're struggling
[55:43] with your marriage, what's the answer?
[55:45] Let the word shine into your life. Let
[55:47] it show you the path. Let it show you
[55:49] the truth about the situation. Let it
[55:52] show you the truth about you. I've
[55:54] noticed one thing. If we won't let the
[55:55] word show us the truth about us, it
[55:57] rarely shows us the truth about anybody
[55:58] else. Because if we can't accept it for
[56:01] oursel, then chances are we've got a
[56:02] different filter on when we're looking
[56:03] at our brother or sister. That's the way
[56:05] it works. I preached by experience this
[56:08] morning. Amen. If we won't let it do a
[56:10] work in us, then guess what? He's not
[56:11] going to allow us to to He's not going
[56:13] to use us for a work in somebody else's
[56:14] life either. That's not the way that
[56:16] he's going to do. Amen. When we're
[56:18] dealing with hard times, what's the
[56:20] answer? Let the word show you what's
[56:23] going on.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's the simplicity of it.
[56:26] Amen. In other words, let the word do
[56:28] the work instead of sitting there
[56:30] beating our brains out trying to make
[56:32] everybody else change or trying to
[56:33] figure out what's going on. Jesus put it
[56:35] this way. He says, "I am come a light
[56:37] into the world." That whosoever
[56:40] believeth on me should not abide in
[56:42] darkness. The natural condition of
[56:44] humanity is darkness.
[56:47] The god of this evil age is Satan.
[56:51] He's the one that controls this world,
[56:54] the political parts of it. You know,
[56:55] these different things. We we know these
[56:57] things. But Jesus says you don't have to
[56:59] stay there. Abiding means to to to to
[57:03] continue or endure to remain to dwell.
[57:06] So Jesus came to take us into light into
[57:09] life
[57:11] out of what we were in which means if
[57:13] we're not in light and life then we must
[57:15] be in darkness and death. If he's trying
[57:18] to take us into something then we can't
[57:19] be in there right now. That can't be our
[57:21] starting position. So, whatever
[57:23] situation we're facing this morning,
[57:25] there's only one answer. Come into the
[57:27] light of God's word. And let the truth
[57:30] set you free. Let the truth set you
[57:33] free. Amen. Let the word be the
[57:34] discerner.
[57:36] Let the word be the healer. Let the word
[57:39] settle your heart. Let the word give you
[57:41] peace. Because remember, you're looking
[57:42] to the creative power of God's word that
[57:45] he cannot lie. That what he says he must
[57:47] do. And you're saying, "Lord, let your
[57:49] word happen,
[57:51] not just what I think about it." Amen.
[57:54] Let the word do what you can't do on
[57:56] your own. Isn't that what we're all
[57:58] trying to do? We've got a place we're
[58:00] trying to go. We've got a hell to shun.
[58:02] We've got a heaven to gain, as the song
[58:04] says. We're looking to go in a rapture.
[58:08] How are we going to get there? Not by
[58:09] the works that I'm doing. That's for
[58:11] sure. Jesus would come along. He say,
[58:13] "Listen, without me, you're going to
[58:15] stay in darkness.
[58:17] That's your natural condition. That's
[58:19] your natural place as a human. We're all
[58:21] born in sin. Amen. He says, "And you'll
[58:23] stay in darkness and you'll try and work
[58:25] and you'll work and you'll struggle and
[58:27] you'll try and you'll do this route and
[58:29] that route and up and down and in and
[58:31] out. And in the end, what you're going
[58:32] to do is you're going to go down and
[58:34] you're going to sit down and say, "You
[58:35] know what? Everything I've done hasn't
[58:36] worked.
[58:38] So, I might as well just sit here."
[58:42] Because if you don't have light, you
[58:44] can't see where you're going. You can
[58:46] you have no confidence
[58:48] no confidence in where you're going. So
[58:50] you're just going to end up sitting here
[58:52] and saying, "I've tried everything that
[58:54] I can think to try except one thing.
[58:57] Turn on the lights."
[58:59] And there's only one man can turn on the
[59:01] lights and that's Christ the word. Amen.
[59:04] What we need is Christ the Word, the
[59:06] living light. Amen. Residing in us to
[59:09] overcome these things. That's the only
[59:11] way it's ever going to work. I love what
[59:13] Jesus said and it was a fulfillment of
[59:15] the prophecy in Isaiah. And he says,
[59:17] "The people which sat in darkness,
[59:20] the people that had given up, the people
[59:23] that know they can't go anywhere,
[59:26] he says they saw a great light."
[59:29] If you're stuck this morning,
[59:33] if you're sitting down, tired of being
[59:36] tired, sick of being sick,
[59:39] he says, "There's a great light." And to
[59:42] them which sat in the region and the
[59:44] shadow of death, light is sprung up.
[59:47] Hallelujah.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; We've got something that'll get us out
[59:50] this morning. We've got something
[59:52] that'll take us forward. Amen. Now, what
[59:55] caused this to be fulfilled? Jesus is
[59:57] preaching it in in Matthew 4:16. He's
[59:59] saying this is what's happening. What
[1:00:02] changed?
[1:00:04] Isaiah spoke it. Jesus fulfilled it.
[1:00:07] Calling Jesus on the scene is what
[1:00:09] brought them into light. Bringing him on
[1:00:12] the scene is what took them there. It
[1:00:14] was light coming to the people and
[1:00:15] separating them out of darkness. It was
[1:00:18] life coming and taking people out of
[1:00:20] death.
[1:00:22] The scripture says there's a way that
[1:00:24] seems right to a man and the ways
[1:00:26] thereof are the ways of death. In other
[1:00:28] words, what we think is the right thing
[1:00:30] to do is always death as our human.
[1:00:33] That's it. He says, "I came to get you
[1:00:35] out of that." Listen to what he said
[1:00:37] because this was he was speaking this to
[1:00:39] the Jews. It applies to the Gentiles.
[1:00:41] But if we look in Isaiah 42, we see
[1:00:43] something that's specific to the
[1:00:44] Gentiles. We're Gentiles here this
[1:00:46] morning. We're not Jews. Anyone that's
[1:00:47] not a Jew is a Gentile. So that would
[1:00:49] apply to us this morning. And look at
[1:00:50] what God said in Isaiah. He said, "Thus
[1:00:52] sayeth the God, God the Lord, he that
[1:00:55] created the heavens and stretched them
[1:00:56] out. He that spread forth the earth, and
[1:00:58] that which cometh out of it, he that
[1:01:00] giveth breath unto the people upon it,
[1:01:02] and spirit to them that walk therein. I
[1:01:04] the Lord have called thee in
[1:01:05] righteousness, and will hold thine hand,
[1:01:08] and will keep thee, and give thee for a
[1:01:10] covenant of the people, for a light of
[1:01:13] the Gentiles." This is the great mystery
[1:01:14] that was hidden was that God had a
[1:01:16] people. Well, God had a bride that was
[1:01:18] hidden amongst the Gentiles. And how is
[1:01:21] he going to bring them out? Light.
[1:01:25] It was light. Watch what that light
[1:01:27] would do. That light would open the
[1:01:29] blind eyes to bring out the prisoners
[1:01:31] from the prison and them that sit in
[1:01:33] darkness out of the prison house. So
[1:01:36] listen, he just said to the Jews, I'm
[1:01:37] fulfilling the those that sit in
[1:01:39] darkness. But look, I've got another
[1:01:41] people coming and guess what? I'm going
[1:01:42] to take them out of prison as well. I'm
[1:01:44] going to take them out of darkness and
[1:01:46] they'll receive what you wouldn't
[1:01:47] receive. And they'll get the benefit
[1:01:49] that you wouldn't receive. That's us
[1:01:52] this morning. Listen to this. He says in
[1:01:54] Isaiah the 42nd chapter, great light has
[1:01:56] come. Light, the greatest light that
[1:01:58] ever shone was shining in that humble
[1:02:01] little Nazarene. A man with no beauty
[1:02:03] that we should desire him. A man without
[1:02:05] education, worldly speaking. A man that
[1:02:08] knew not the rituals and things of this
[1:02:10] world, but he could tie demons, raise
[1:02:12] the dead, and devils tremble.
[1:02:17] Church, let's put on our spiritual
[1:02:18] thinking caps this morning. If that's
[1:02:20] the way he came then, how is he going to
[1:02:22] come today?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; If that's the way he worked then, what's
[1:02:25] he going to work in today? A simple,
[1:02:27] humble people by worldly standards. Not
[1:02:31] too much to look at perhaps, but that's
[1:02:33] the way he works. Look at the power
[1:02:35] expressed through simplicity.
[1:02:38] He says, "And God recognized him from
[1:02:40] heaven and spoke back. This is my
[1:02:42] beloved son, not before the bureaucrats,
[1:02:44] but before who? A selected group that he
[1:02:48] had called."
[1:02:51] He says, "Great light." Why? A greater
[1:02:53] light was shining from his word. What
[1:02:56] was the word Christ? He was what? The
[1:02:58] word brought to life. Now remember, we
[1:03:00] preached this a couple services ago, but
[1:03:03] remember what makes demons tremble is
[1:03:05] not this.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Those words were written 400, 500, 600,
[1:03:15] 700 years, a thousand years before
[1:03:16] Christ came and demons didn't tremble.
[1:03:19] But what made demons tremble was when
[1:03:21] those words stepped into flesh.
[1:03:24] That's what makes demons tremble is when
[1:03:26] the life of the word comes into reality.
[1:03:29] That's what made them tremble. Amen. It
[1:03:31] was the word living in flesh. When God
[1:03:33] indwells us by the spirit, that's what
[1:03:36] makes demons tremble because what? Light
[1:03:38] and darkness cannot coexist. They've got
[1:03:40] to go. They've got to go.
[1:03:44] He says, "And the word brought to life
[1:03:47] gave a greater light than he did when he
[1:03:49] said, "Let there be light." In Genesis
[1:03:52] 1, he says that was the light of a
[1:03:55] creation, a mortal creation, which must
[1:03:57] fall. But his word was life eternal and
[1:04:00] light eternal. And when a man believed
[1:04:02] that, he had eternal light.
[1:04:06] Okay? I'm going to read something to you
[1:04:08] this morning. And I'm reading this for
[1:04:11] the bride. This is for sons and
[1:04:13] daughters of God. Okay? This is for the
[1:04:14] elect. This is not for everybody. This
[1:04:16] is for the children of God. And I want
[1:04:18] you to hear what Peter said about you by
[1:04:20] the Holy Spirit. Amen. He says, "You are
[1:04:23] a chosen generation.
[1:04:25] You are a royal priesthood, a holy
[1:04:28] nation, and a peculiar people." But let
[1:04:30] me say it this way. You didn't know that
[1:04:32] until one thing came your way. Light.
[1:04:36] That's it. When light came your way, all
[1:04:39] of a sudden, you realize he chose me.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz here's the thing. You didn't find
[1:04:44] him. He found you. So who did the
[1:04:46] choosing? It was almighty God. It wasn't
[1:04:48] me. I've said many times when I was 17,
[1:04:52] I was looking to leave church. I was
[1:04:54] looking to leave my family. I was
[1:04:56] looking for a life of my own choosing.
[1:04:58] But he came and called my name when I
[1:05:01] wanted to walk away. So who choose who?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Did I choose Christ or did Christ choose
[1:05:07] me?
[1:05:09] Before we were born, we were a chosen
[1:05:12] generation. Hallelujah. And what
[1:05:14] happened? I realized I had more in
[1:05:17] common with the word of God than with
[1:05:19] the world. As much as I desired the
[1:05:22] world, there was something in my soul,
[1:05:24] in my heart that says I want what the
[1:05:25] word says. Why? Because light came my
[1:05:28] way by the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; That's what happened.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; So then I realized I'm chosen. Then what
[1:05:36] does he say? You're a royal priesthood.
[1:05:38] You didn't know you were part of the
[1:05:40] king's family until the king came and
[1:05:43] said, "My son, my daughter." Not only
[1:05:46] that, he chose you to intercede for
[1:05:48] other people. He interceded for you so
[1:05:51] you can intercede for other people. So
[1:05:54] all of a sudden, you realize, I've got
[1:05:55] purpose. I've got a place. I've got
[1:05:58] something to do. Church, let me tell you
[1:06:00] this. We're going to vote on offices in
[1:06:02] a couple weeks. You don't have to have
[1:06:03] an office to be effective in this
[1:06:05] church, in this world. You are an
[1:06:07] intercessor. A priest is always first
[1:06:10] and foremost an intercessor for those
[1:06:12] that are around.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; That's your role this morning. Amen.
[1:06:16] Then he says, "You're a holy nation."
[1:06:18] Hallelujah.
[1:06:21] A holy nation. How many of us would
[1:06:23] stand up and declare, "I'm holy this
[1:06:25] morning." You don't need to cuz he
[1:06:27] declared you're holy. And how do you
[1:06:29] know you're holy? Because he dwells
[1:06:31] within you. And he cannot dwell in a
[1:06:33] place that's not holy.
[1:06:34] He he came down and he justifies you.
[1:06:37] Says you didn't sin in the first place.
[1:06:39] It's under the blood of Christ. He
[1:06:40] sanctifies you. He cleans you up. And
[1:06:42] then he fills you with his spirit.
[1:06:43] That's what makes us holy. Not our
[1:06:46] works, not our discipline. What? It's
[1:06:49] Christ in me that makes me holy. What a
[1:06:52] peculiar people. You know what, folks?
[1:06:54] We're different. We're weird. And we
[1:06:57] embrace it. We embrace it because we
[1:06:59] don't want to be like the rest of the
[1:07:01] world. Cuz they're in darkness. We've
[1:07:04] come into light.
[1:07:06] How do you know you're different?
[1:07:07] Because the word came and said, "You're
[1:07:09] different."
[1:07:11] Because you come from me. You come from
[1:07:12] God.
[1:07:14] He says, "Why?" That you should show
[1:07:17] forth the praises of him who hath called
[1:07:19] you where? out of darkness into his
[1:07:25] marvelous light which in time past were
[1:07:28] not a people but are now the people of
[1:07:30] God which had not obtained mercy but now
[1:07:33] have obtained mercy. So what's the
[1:07:35] process? What's the method of calling us
[1:07:37] into position? Because that's what
[1:07:38] Peter's just described as people that
[1:07:40] are called into position. Called into
[1:07:43] adoption. Called into the placing of
[1:07:45] sons and daughters of God. How does he
[1:07:46] do it? Light.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; By his word. Amen. That's what Peter
[1:07:50] told us. What happened is we came into
[1:07:52] position. We came into realization. We
[1:07:55] came into the eternal reality of what
[1:07:57] God said about us rather than the kernel
[1:07:59] lie that Satan gave us by our natural
[1:08:01] birth and by our natural parents and by
[1:08:03] our natural condition. We saw the
[1:08:06] eternal and we said, "I'm going to step
[1:08:07] back into the eternal rather than live
[1:08:09] by the temporal."
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; That's what he was doing for us. Amen.
[1:08:12] We weren't living the reality of the
[1:08:14] word. But once we got a revelation, the
[1:08:17] reality followed.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Because that's what revelation does is
[1:08:20] it reveals. It produces itself. Amen.
[1:08:23] Parents, you don't need to convince your
[1:08:25] children into Christ.
[1:08:28] You can't convince your children into
[1:08:30] Christ. It won't work. Amen. You can't
[1:08:33] force them to be a Christian. You can't
[1:08:34] put pressure on them to do it.
[1:08:38] You can't spiritualize their religious
[1:08:40] nature or their desire to please you
[1:08:42] either.
[1:08:43] That won't work. You know what that
[1:08:46] does? It builds hypocrites
[1:08:49] because you're you're endorsing the life
[1:08:51] without the life. You're endorsing the
[1:08:53] action without the life behind it.
[1:08:55] Church, we want our children to be
[1:08:56] obedient. We want them to be good
[1:08:57] citizens. But to be a Christian, you
[1:08:59] need Christ.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; It has to be the person inside of you.
[1:09:02] Amen. All it does is it produces a a a
[1:09:05] facade, a shell of religion and
[1:09:08] spirituality without Christ. And it
[1:09:11] leads to a life of frustration and
[1:09:14] hidden lives and not the good kind of
[1:09:16] hidden life. Amen. Church, when your
[1:09:20] children become a Christian, they'll
[1:09:22] start trying to convince others. You
[1:09:24] won't have to convince them. They'll
[1:09:26] start convincing others. That's when you
[1:09:28] know your children have had a new birth.
[1:09:30] You don't have to convince them of
[1:09:31] anything.
[1:09:33] Oh, we still teach, we still train, we
[1:09:34] still mentor, we still all these things.
[1:09:37] We're here for their benefit. But what
[1:09:38] happens is when it starts to come out of
[1:09:40] them rather than us having to push it
[1:09:42] in. Amen. That's what we do. That's that
[1:09:45] that's the only thing we can do as
[1:09:46] believers. We can only share. We can
[1:09:49] only offer. We can only shine. And what
[1:09:53] we trust is that the light will draw
[1:09:55] light. Children of light, that's it. I'm
[1:09:58] not here to convert anyone.
[1:10:00] I'm here to offer life by the word of
[1:10:03] God and it's up to God to make it work.
[1:10:05] Amen. Now, here's the hook and I want
[1:10:08] you to catch this this morning. If you
[1:10:09] can catch this, you'll catch the message
[1:10:11] I'm bringing. Too many times we look at
[1:10:13] this scripture in Peter and the problem
[1:10:15] is we put it back to a past or single
[1:10:18] event.
[1:10:20] We put it back to our new birth. We put
[1:10:21] it back to our salvational experience.
[1:10:23] We put it back to when we received
[1:10:24] Christ, when we got baptized. One of
[1:10:26] those things, we put it back there. We
[1:10:28] place the experience of eternal life of
[1:10:30] light and we put it in a single moment.
[1:10:32] Now there is a truth to that because
[1:10:34] when we receive the spirit of God inside
[1:10:36] of us that seals our soul for eternity.
[1:10:39] There's an eternal work that's done
[1:10:41] there and that can never be undone. Your
[1:10:43] soul is sealed for eternity. Doesn't
[1:10:45] matter what happens after that. You're
[1:10:47] going to make it.
[1:10:48] But there's so much more that comes
[1:10:50] behind that. Amen. The Holy Spirit
[1:10:51] confirms us as a child of God. But let
[1:10:54] me tell you, what happened there is not
[1:10:56] a one-time event. It's got to be an
[1:10:58] everyday event cuz I don't need victory
[1:11:00] yesterday. I need victory today. I don't
[1:11:03] need peace yesterday. I need peace
[1:11:05] today. I don't need hope yesterday. I
[1:11:07] need hope today. I don't need love
[1:11:09] yesterday. I need love today. I need a
[1:11:11] present day God. I need a present day
[1:11:14] experience. And that can only come as we
[1:11:16] walk in the light with Christ. A daily
[1:11:20] experience. Amen. I don't want to be
[1:11:22] effective yesterday. I want to be
[1:11:23] effective today.
[1:11:26] And that takes him to walk with us day
[1:11:27] by day. My victory yesterday tells me
[1:11:30] there's victory for today, but I want
[1:11:32] the victory today, not just yesterday.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] I'm not living yesterday. I'm living
[1:11:40] today.
[1:11:41] So, we want to take those things and we
[1:11:43] don't want to put them back to that
[1:11:45] moment. We want it every day to be a
[1:11:47] moment. We want every day to be an
[1:11:50] experience. Amen. I'm in the present, so
[1:11:52] I need an everpresent God. And the
[1:11:54] beautiful thing is that's exactly what
[1:11:55] he is. He says I am. Not I was, not I
[1:11:59] will be. He says I am. I'm always there.
[1:12:01] I'm always present. [snorts]
[1:12:04] Look at what Paul would say about our
[1:12:06] battles.
[1:12:08] We're going to preach on this in far
[1:12:09] more depth at a different time. But Paul
[1:12:11] says, "We wrestle not against flesh and
[1:12:13] blood,
[1:12:15] but against principalities, against
[1:12:17] powers, against the rulers of the
[1:12:19] darkness of this world, against
[1:12:21] spiritual wickedness in high places." We
[1:12:23] we we think about our struggle so many
[1:12:25] times, and this whole series is on
[1:12:27] overcoming. It's on it's on it's on
[1:12:29] overcoming the flesh and the lusts a and
[1:12:32] the mind battles and the sickness and
[1:12:33] the situations and the attitudes and the
[1:12:35] worries and all these different things
[1:12:37] that are in our life. But to overcome,
[1:12:39] first we've got to recognize what the
[1:12:41] battle really is and who and what we're
[1:12:43] fighting and what defines them. That's
[1:12:45] how we're going to get the victory.
[1:12:46] Amen. Paul says, "We're not fighting
[1:12:48] people. We're not fighting flesh and
[1:12:50] blood." Amen. We're not fighting worry.
[1:12:52] We're not fighting stress. We're not
[1:12:54] fighting hardship. We're fighting
[1:12:56] principalities and powers. It's a
[1:12:58] supernatural spiritual battle that is
[1:13:01] being pushed down into the flesh. That's
[1:13:03] where the source of our problems. Amen.
[1:13:05] And so it's a battle that started in
[1:13:07] heaven with Lucifer
[1:13:10] that rebelled and God kicked him out
[1:13:12] with a third of the angels. And now
[1:13:14] Lucifer comes down here and what's he
[1:13:15] doing? He's getting us to rebel against
[1:13:17] God. And that's the battle today is to
[1:13:20] take that rebellion and turn it into
[1:13:22] redemption. That's what's trying to
[1:13:24] happen in our lives. Amen. And and so
[1:13:26] Satan himself is controlling things on
[1:13:29] this earth. We're not in the kingdom of
[1:13:30] heaven on this earth politically, uh
[1:13:32] naturally, any of these things. The
[1:13:34] world is in a fallen condition. Amen.
[1:13:36] We're only in the kingdom of heaven in
[1:13:38] our souls.
[1:13:39] Everything else is still subject to
[1:13:41] Satan's whims. Amen. This body in this
[1:13:44] earth will pass away. But the soul is
[1:13:46] eternal with God. Amen. And when this is
[1:13:49] all said and done, then we go back to
[1:13:51] our theophies, our heavenly bodies, and
[1:13:52] we rule and reign with Christ back here
[1:13:54] on the earth. Now listen to this. He
[1:13:56] says, "Now this great contest has been
[1:13:58] going on for many years. It started in
[1:13:59] heaven and Satan was kicked out into the
[1:14:01] earth and then he became an enemy to
[1:14:03] God's people. And since then, he's used
[1:14:06] all of his strength and his strategy to
[1:14:08] try and pull God's people into his
[1:14:11] fires. He's trying to get us worked up.
[1:14:13] He's trying to get us frustrated. He's
[1:14:14] trying to break us.
[1:14:17] He's trying to get us to react to the
[1:14:19] heat,
[1:14:21] the pressures of time, of society, of
[1:14:24] expectations, whatever it might be. He's
[1:14:26] trying to crank up the heat so that
[1:14:28] we'll walk away from the light. Walk
[1:14:30] away from our trust in the word. He
[1:14:33] says, "And we know who has the most
[1:14:35] power." Do we know that this morning?
[1:14:39] You better.
[1:14:41] We know who has the most power. God
[1:14:43] does. He says, "And God, when he gave
[1:14:44] his people the best thing that he could
[1:14:46] to combat Satan with, it was his word."
[1:14:49] Because the word is God. And who's
[1:14:50] stronger than God? He says, "So the
[1:14:52] word's God and the word becomes our
[1:14:55] strength." God in the church becomes its
[1:14:58] strength to pull Satan to his own fires
[1:15:02] that he has made.
[1:15:05] He said, "And the tug goes on." But
[1:15:07] Jesus said in Mark 16, "In my name, they
[1:15:10] shall cast out devils." What becomes our
[1:15:14] strength? The word. Thy word is a lamp
[1:15:17] unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[1:15:20] That's what gives us strength. Amen. The
[1:15:22] exposure of what is real and what is
[1:15:25] not.
[1:15:27] Now remember a prophet of God would say
[1:15:29] he says what is in the heavenly
[1:15:31] dimension is more real than I can touch
[1:15:33] with my five senses.
[1:15:36] Okay? You know I'm an engineer.
[1:15:39] I was listening to one of the best the
[1:15:40] the greatest physicists ever yesterday
[1:15:45] and he was talking about what we think
[1:15:47] is real and he said, "You know, you take
[1:15:50] your hand and you put it down on a
[1:15:52] table." He says, "Now, you say that
[1:15:53] table is extremely solid." He said, "Did
[1:15:56] you know you have never touched anything
[1:15:58] in your life?"
[1:16:01] You say, "No, no, no. I I touched it. I
[1:16:03] touched here. I'm knocking on it." You
[1:16:05] never physically touch it.
[1:16:08] There's more air in this. There's more
[1:16:10] gaps in this than there is solidity.
[1:16:13] But when your hand comes down, you have
[1:16:16] electrons, you have electromagnetic
[1:16:17] forces that are all around your hand.
[1:16:20] This has the same thing. And as you come
[1:16:21] down to touch,
[1:16:23] those forces start to push back at each
[1:16:25] other. So when I knock, I am knocking on
[1:16:29] electrons repelling each other. There's
[1:16:31] no touch there.
[1:16:33] And so we sit here and we say, "This is
[1:16:35] real, church. You haven't felt
[1:16:38] anything." And he, the guy made the
[1:16:39] famous statement. He said, "Judge, I
[1:16:40] never punched that man and I can prove
[1:16:42] it by science." He says, "I never
[1:16:44] touched that man." He says, "And I can
[1:16:45] prove it by science." Cuz he says, "You
[1:16:47] can't touch anything because the
[1:16:48] electromagnetic forces never allow you
[1:16:50] to actually close that gap to nothing."
[1:16:53] And there's there's a complex
[1:16:54] explanation for it. Nature nature
[1:16:56] abhores a vacuum. If you close it
[1:16:58] completely, then you would create a
[1:16:59] vacuum. It would cause all sorts of
[1:17:00] issues and and whatnot. But you don't
[1:17:03] actually touch what you think you're
[1:17:04] touching.
[1:17:06] So if that isn't real,
[1:17:09] what's keeping us all together?
[1:17:11] [laughter]
[1:17:13] We're sitting here and we're we're we're
[1:17:15] trusting when we go home that that car
[1:17:16] is not going to fall apart on us. That
[1:17:19] we're not going to be hurtling down the
[1:17:20] road at 60 km an hour and then
[1:17:22] everything just break apart. What's
[1:17:23] keeping it together? Unseen forces.
[1:17:26] And that's just the the
[1:17:28] electromechanical nature of this world.
[1:17:30] But he says, "Listen, when you're a when
[1:17:32] you're a believer, you've got to
[1:17:34] recognize that what you touch, feel,
[1:17:37] taste, see, hear is not what you're
[1:17:40] fighting.
[1:17:42] There are greater forces that are going
[1:17:44] on. And that's what you've got to focus
[1:17:46] on." Amen. That's what's going on here
[1:17:48] this morning. That's what the real We've
[1:17:50] got to see when the light of the word
[1:17:52] comes, it shows us what the real problem
[1:17:54] is. It shows us what we're really
[1:17:56] battling. Amen. And we look at Abraham.
[1:17:58] We preached on this uh last service.
[1:18:00] Amen. How his strength was not in the
[1:18:02] evidence of his five senses.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; His strength was not there. His faith
[1:18:07] was not in circumstances, but rather his
[1:18:09] faith was in the unfailing word of God
[1:18:12] to him personally. And the Bible said he
[1:18:15] was strong in faith giving glory to God.
[1:18:17] Why was he strong in faith giving glory
[1:18:19] to God? Because Abraham wasn't trusting
[1:18:21] his performance.
[1:18:23] We highlighted all of his failures last
[1:18:25] service. Abraham wasn't saying, "I'm
[1:18:27] doing good. God. So, I'm going to give
[1:18:28] you praise today. In the good times,
[1:18:31] praise his name. In the bad times, do
[1:18:33] the same. Cuz it's not about what I'm
[1:18:35] doing. It's about what he said he's
[1:18:36] going to do in my life. That's where our
[1:18:38] rest is. Amen. And the scripture says
[1:18:40] Abraham was fully persuaded that God was
[1:18:44] able to perform what he had promised.
[1:18:47] And day by day, Abraham's getting older
[1:18:49] and older. God says, "You're going to
[1:18:50] have a son." 99 years old. And God says,
[1:18:52] "Abraham, now you're going to have a
[1:18:54] son.
[1:18:55] I can't even have intimate relations
[1:18:57] with my wife, Lord.
[1:19:00] You're going to have a son in the next
[1:19:01] year. And he did.
[1:19:05] Why? Because we wrestle not against
[1:19:07] flesh and blood. Circumstances are not
[1:19:09] what matters. You know, I was sharing
[1:19:10] with some brothers at the New Year's
[1:19:12] fellowship
[1:19:13] how that as a minister what we want,
[1:19:16] this is this is what Satan can use to
[1:19:18] beat us up at times. We want results.
[1:19:21] I don't want to preach a year and see no
[1:19:23] growth in the congregation. I don't want
[1:19:25] to preach a year and not see people
[1:19:26] receive the the Holy Ghost. I don't want
[1:19:28] to preach a year and not see souls
[1:19:30] saved. I don't want to preach a year and
[1:19:31] not see people healed. But you know
[1:19:33] what? That's not my job. My job is to
[1:19:36] preach the word.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Listen, one plants, one
[1:19:40] waters, but it's God that gives the
[1:19:42] increase. I can't make you a child of
[1:19:45] God if you're not a child of God. I
[1:19:47] can't make you obey. I can't make you
[1:19:48] change your decisions. I can't make you
[1:19:50] change your mindset. I can't heal you.
[1:19:52] But he can. And he does. And that's
[1:19:55] where the trust is. Amen. That goes for
[1:19:58] every single one of us. We've got to
[1:20:02] stay in our lane and do what God has
[1:20:05] ordained us to do.
[1:20:08] Mothers and wives, where's your lane?
[1:20:11] Stay in your home.
[1:20:13] Keep a godly atmosphere.
[1:20:16] And take care of the home.
[1:20:19] brothers, what's our godly lane?
[1:20:22] Provide for and lead our families.
[1:20:26] That's our lane. That's that's our first
[1:20:28] ministry. That's our our first
[1:20:30] requirement. And so often as brothers,
[1:20:32] as men, we we focus so much on the
[1:20:34] provision
[1:20:36] because that's the simpler part.
[1:20:39] That's the regular expected part. But
[1:20:43] we've got to lead as much as we've got
[1:20:45] to provide.
[1:20:46] We've got to be present in that home.
[1:20:48] Amen. We've got to to to be able to to
[1:20:51] take decisions to God and come back with
[1:20:53] an answer for our family and stand on
[1:20:56] our own two feet about those decisions.
[1:21:00] Provision's the easy part. Leadership's
[1:21:02] the hard part. We've got to be the
[1:21:04] example
[1:21:05] for our entire family of what a godly
[1:21:08] life looks like. Yes, our wife, we rely
[1:21:10] on them and they are to be an example.
[1:21:11] They're the sixth go the fifth gospel.
[1:21:14] But brothers, we've got an obligation to
[1:21:16] lead our family by the spirit.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we're spiritual leaders, that
[1:21:22] we're feeding them by the word of God.
[1:21:24] Amen. And then life comes not from our
[1:21:27] efforts. It comes from his presence.
[1:21:31] We've got to sew the seed. I'm not
[1:21:33] letting us off the hook, but the results
[1:21:35] come from him. But we've got to make
[1:21:37] sure we're sewing seeds. You know, my
[1:21:40] family and I were having a conversation
[1:21:42] about creation. a few days ago and you
[1:21:45] know we talked you know I had somebody
[1:21:47] was asking me you know was it a literal
[1:21:48] six days or or was it you know a longer
[1:21:50] time frame and they had some scientific
[1:21:52] questions and these different things and
[1:21:54] a and the question was well if it's
[1:21:56] literal days then how did how did the
[1:21:58] the earth bring forth everything to
[1:22:01] produce food for the animals that would
[1:22:03] come just a few days later
[1:22:05] and and it's not really about was it six
[1:22:07] days or 6,000 years
[1:22:10] but it was interesting because we we're
[1:22:12] discussing these things. But when you
[1:22:14] look back at the scripture, I want you
[1:22:16] to catch something. Because when he
[1:22:17] created the grass and the trees and the
[1:22:19] herbs and these different things, there
[1:22:21] was no light on the earth. Did you know
[1:22:24] that? Go back and read it. Because the
[1:22:27] light comes on the fourth day, the sun,
[1:22:30] moon, and stars. The third day is when
[1:22:32] the grasses and the herbs were created.
[1:22:33] And the earth, it says, brought forth
[1:22:35] those things
[1:22:37] without natural light. So what produced
[1:22:40] them?
[1:22:41] There was only one light there, church.
[1:22:44] That was the shakina glory of Almighty
[1:22:46] God in the pillar of fire moving across
[1:22:49] the earth. And that brought light up in
[1:22:52] however many days it was. All we know is
[1:22:54] it worked. Amen. That light brought
[1:22:57] life.
[1:23:00] That life was light. We can put it
[1:23:01] whichever way you want. But a day later,
[1:23:03] my wife was listening to the message, a
[1:23:05] hidden life, and she shared this thought
[1:23:07] with me and it it really emphasized. She
[1:23:09] was saying the difference between how we
[1:23:11] see things and the way we think of
[1:23:12] things and the way God is. Cuz we put up
[1:23:15] all these barriers and how can this
[1:23:16] happen and how could this be and this
[1:23:18] that and the other thing. God just said
[1:23:20] if only you knew. If only you knew what
[1:23:22] I could do. Amen. See, we look at at
[1:23:24] something as simple as this and we look
[1:23:26] at the seasons and we look at okay well
[1:23:28] winter everything's dead. So we'd say
[1:23:29] they started in winter then spring
[1:23:31] things came up and and it takes a while.
[1:23:33] You know you got to have lots of
[1:23:34] sunlight and warmth and it comes through
[1:23:36] then it's got to grow. Then it's got to
[1:23:37] grow. Then it's got to bud and spring
[1:23:38] forth and then it's got to mature and
[1:23:40] it's got to dry out and then we harvest
[1:23:41] it. Then it takes anywhere from from 2
[1:23:43] to 6 months.
[1:23:46] How's that going to happen?
[1:23:49] But see, here's the thing, church.
[1:23:50] That's what happens under a natural
[1:23:52] light. We're not being redeemed back to
[1:23:55] nature. We're redeemed back to
[1:23:57] supernature, the supernatural. So we
[1:24:00] want to look at the supernatural effect,
[1:24:02] not the natural effect. See, too often
[1:24:04] that's what we're doing is we're trying
[1:24:05] to apply a natural effect and get
[1:24:06] supernatural results. Doesn't work that
[1:24:08] way. But we go and we look in Numbers
[1:24:11] chapter 17 to where God is proving to
[1:24:13] Israel who he's chosen to be the priest
[1:24:15] for the temple. Are you hearing me? A
[1:24:18] royal priesthood.
[1:24:20] And remember what happened is and Kora
[1:24:23] had rebelled against Moses and Aaron.
[1:24:24] They said, "Listen, we're as spiritual
[1:24:26] as you are. And God works with us the
[1:24:28] way he works with you. So why do you
[1:24:30] take everything on yourselves?"
[1:24:32] And the simple answer was because God
[1:24:34] chose us.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't choose himself. Moses was
[1:24:37] happy being a shepherd.
[1:24:39] Aaron certainly wasn't cho wasn't
[1:24:41] choosing himself.
[1:24:43] But what happened is Kora rebelled and
[1:24:45] God came down and he destroyed them. But
[1:24:48] then God says, "Listen, I want to make a
[1:24:50] point here. I want to show you who I've
[1:24:51] chosen." So what he did is he told
[1:24:53] Moses, he said, "Listen, I want you to
[1:24:54] go to every tribe and I want you to take
[1:24:56] a rod, a wooden rod from them, a wooden
[1:24:59] staff, whatever you want to call it.
[1:25:00] Each one of them a leader would have
[1:25:02] that. He says, "And I want you to take
[1:25:04] those wooden rods and bring them into
[1:25:06] the holy of holies in the temple where
[1:25:08] the shikina glory of God was." Okay? In
[1:25:12] other words, he told them to put Moses
[1:25:14] to put them in the original light.
[1:25:18] They've been sitting in natural light
[1:25:19] for who knows how long and nothing had
[1:25:22] ever happened to him. But he says to
[1:25:23] Moses, he said, "Moses, bring those rods
[1:25:25] into my presence, one for each tribe. 12
[1:25:27] rods laid out in front of him, wooden
[1:25:29] rods. Now, every one of those rods was
[1:25:31] exactly the same, church. They're made
[1:25:33] from the same material. They're made
[1:25:35] from an almond tree. They were dried
[1:25:37] out. They were completely dead. They
[1:25:40] were separated from their original
[1:25:41] source. They were separated from light.
[1:25:43] They were separated from life. They were
[1:25:45] separated from water. They had no way to
[1:25:46] draw nutrients. Dead. Dead. Dead.
[1:25:51] That's what they were. Okay? They were
[1:25:54] completely separated from their life
[1:25:56] source.
[1:25:57] You could try and tell those rods to
[1:25:59] produce almonds all day long. You could
[1:26:01] preach till you were blue in the face
[1:26:02] and they weren't going to produce
[1:26:03] almonds.
[1:26:05] Why? Because they were dead. Okay? It
[1:26:08] would only the preaching would only
[1:26:10] confirm that's dead,
[1:26:14] right? But watch what one night in the
[1:26:17] presence of God would do. He says, "And
[1:26:20] Moses laid up the rods before the Lord
[1:26:22] in the tabernacle of witness. He takes
[1:26:24] him and he places him in the shakina of
[1:26:25] glory." Remember there's a the Holy of
[1:26:27] Holies. They had a special veil real
[1:26:29] thick that crossed in front and in there
[1:26:32] God would come down and he would dwell.
[1:26:35] It says, "And it came to pass that on
[1:26:36] the moral," so in less than 24 hours the
[1:26:38] next day, Moses went into the tabernacle
[1:26:40] of witness and behold the rod of Aaron
[1:26:43] for the house of Levi was budded,
[1:26:46] brought forth buds, bloom blossoms, and
[1:26:48] yielded almonds.
[1:26:51] Church, what does dead mean?
[1:26:54] Dead means life is absent.
[1:26:58] That's how you define death. Absence of
[1:27:00] life. How do you define darkness?
[1:27:04] Absence of light. The definition of
[1:27:07] those two things which are both satanic
[1:27:10] is the absence of something. You cannot
[1:27:14] produce darkness. You can only
[1:27:16] extinguish light.
[1:27:18] You cannot produce death. You can only
[1:27:20] extinguish life. You can't have a flash
[1:27:24] dark.
[1:27:26] I can't shine a flash dark and put
[1:27:27] darkness here. I can only shine a
[1:27:29] flashlight.
[1:27:31] Right?
[1:27:33] You can't produce darkness. You can only
[1:27:36] extinguish something. And that's how you
[1:27:38] get it. Okay? So, when we're dead,
[1:27:42] what's the only recourse?
[1:27:45] Life.
[1:27:47] When we're in darkness, what's the only
[1:27:49] recourse? Light.
[1:27:52] Okay, that's the only thing that's going
[1:27:54] to take us out. Why? Because God is the
[1:27:56] only source of those things. Light and
[1:27:58] life are the two original attributes of
[1:28:01] God. So, we're asking God to come on the
[1:28:04] scene. And God says, "Moses, bring these
[1:28:07] dead things into my presence." And watch
[1:28:09] what happens. In a single night, what
[1:28:12] the scripture says is that Aaron's rod
[1:28:14] that was made from an almond tree, it
[1:28:16] sprouted, it budded, it blossom flowers,
[1:28:20] and it produced whole ripe almonds
[1:28:24] overnight.
[1:28:28] If it was a six day creation, church,
[1:28:30] that's how you know how it came up.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it, church? It was never
[1:28:35] connected to a water source. It was
[1:28:38] never connected to the ground. It was
[1:28:39] never connected to a tree. Moses didn't
[1:28:42] graft it in. What it was was it was
[1:28:44] connected to the original light and life
[1:28:47] of Almighty God. That's what it took.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that was going to
[1:28:52] work. It lay in the presence of Almighty
[1:28:54] God overnight. And in a night, it
[1:28:57] produced what it was supposed to be.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It produced what was inside of it all
[1:29:02] the time. What it was meant to produce
[1:29:04] in the presence of God, it produced it
[1:29:07] right then and there. Church, some of
[1:29:09] you are struggling to produce things
[1:29:11] this morning. I only have one answer for
[1:29:14] you. Get in the presence of God.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Get quiet. Set yourself aside. If you
[1:29:21] got to walk out of the house, if you got
[1:29:23] to send the kids to somebody, no matter
[1:29:25] what you got to do, get in the presence
[1:29:27] of God.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the only place there's life.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that's going to
[1:29:32] produce it. Amen. Lay everything aside
[1:29:34] and say, "Lord, I need you.
[1:29:37] I need you more than anything else.
[1:29:40] That's the only way it's going to work.
[1:29:42] Stop trying to produce fruit in your
[1:29:44] dried out dead condition.
[1:29:46] Stop trying to produce a results based
[1:29:48] on your discipline or your works and
[1:29:50] say, "Lord, I need your life to do what
[1:29:53] your word says you would do.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's the only way we can do it." Amen.
[1:29:57] You don't need what everyone else is
[1:29:59] trying to do. You don't need their path,
[1:30:02] their thoughts, their ideas, their
[1:30:04] solutions. You need to get in the
[1:30:06] presence of God. You need the light of
[1:30:08] the living word to produce the word of
[1:30:10] God in you. That's the only thing I've
[1:30:12] got for you this morning. You need a
[1:30:13] revelation of what it takes to live a
[1:30:15] Christian life. And that is Christ in
[1:30:17] you, the hope of glory. It's the only
[1:30:19] thing. Amen. Why? Cuz when he comes in,
[1:30:22] the battle's over. Because life conquers
[1:30:24] death. Light casts out darkness. That's
[1:30:26] it. It's over. Game over. As soon as he
[1:30:29] does that. Amen. You know, we play that
[1:30:31] game rock paper scissors, don't we? We
[1:30:33] go one, two, three, boom. Scissors,
[1:30:35] paper, rock. But for every one of those
[1:30:38] things, there's something that defeats
[1:30:40] them. Paper covers rock, right? Rock
[1:30:44] breaks scissors and scissors cut paper.
[1:30:48] But there's nothing defeats light. And
[1:30:50] there's nothing that defeats life.
[1:30:54] That's our champion. That's our answer.
[1:30:57] Is Christ the living word. Amen. When
[1:30:59] we're tied into eternal life, you don't
[1:31:02] have to be where everybody is to
[1:31:03] produce. And what you'll produce will
[1:31:06] last.
[1:31:07] And it's a work of his doing, not a work
[1:31:09] of your doing.
[1:31:11] Listen to this. He says he put Aaron's
[1:31:13] rod in there, an old dead almond tree.
[1:31:16] He says, "But as it went under the
[1:31:18] shikina glory, everything it
[1:31:22] was
[1:31:23] was restored again." See, too often what
[1:31:27] we're going back to is the death we came
[1:31:30] out of instead of the life we came out
[1:31:31] of. When my mom and dad came together
[1:31:34] and produced me, that was not life. That
[1:31:36] was death. If it was life, I would keep
[1:31:38] living forever. But it is what?
[1:31:43] It's broken.
[1:31:45] I can't go back to brokenness for
[1:31:47] solutions.
[1:31:49] But there is a deeper thing inside of
[1:31:52] me.
[1:31:53] There's a seed of God inside me as a
[1:31:55] child of God. And I've got to go back to
[1:31:57] what I was.
[1:32:00] And the only way I can do that is to
[1:32:01] come into the presence of the one that
[1:32:03] produced me in the first place, which is
[1:32:05] Christ the Word. That's the only way
[1:32:07] it's going to happen. He says that's the
[1:32:09] way a sinner is when he goes under the
[1:32:11] shikina glory of the Holy Spirit. The
[1:32:13] veil drops behind him and everything he
[1:32:16] ought to have been a son of God blooms
[1:32:19] out in him. Again, what old things
[1:32:24] are passed away? All things are become
[1:32:27] new. That's the new birth experience.
[1:32:29] Amen. It's the spirit of God coming in
[1:32:31] and making you a new creation. He says,
[1:32:32] remember overnight it budded, blossomed,
[1:32:35] and grew almonds on it. The fruit of the
[1:32:36] spirit, love, joy, longsuffering,
[1:32:38] goodness, gentleness, patience. That's
[1:32:40] what we need to get in the third step
[1:32:42] over into the shina glory where that
[1:32:45] little sacred light was hanging over the
[1:32:47] mercy seat.
[1:32:50] Mercy there was great and grace was
[1:32:53] free.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Pardon there was multiplied to me.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; There my burden soul found liberty.
[1:33:01] Where? At the mercy seat.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says that's the place to stay
[1:33:06] where the pot of mana is set down by the
[1:33:08] ark. That's the place to live. He says
[1:33:10] the curtains are dropped behind you. Now
[1:33:14] remember we preach out of types and
[1:33:16] shadows in the Old Testament. It's never
[1:33:17] perfect, but it's close. But we come
[1:33:20] into the New Testament and we can see
[1:33:22] something just like this.
[1:33:24] Absolutely, we can see it. Now, we can
[1:33:26] see something as simple as we preached
[1:33:28] before on Mary Magdalene. Seven demons
[1:33:30] in her and Jesus cast them out and she
[1:33:32] was a new woman from that point. But I
[1:33:34] love to go back to the woman at the well
[1:33:37] because she was messed up. She was
[1:33:39] broken. She had had five marriages with
[1:33:42] five divorces. She was living common
[1:33:44] law. Her life was a train wreck. She's
[1:33:46] living in the muck of her own
[1:33:47] consistently bad choices. And that
[1:33:50] didn't matter at all. Church, dead is
[1:33:53] dead. Whether you're covered in muck or
[1:33:55] laying on the ground in Hawaii,
[1:33:58] dead's dead.
[1:34:00] It doesn't matter. We're all dead in our
[1:34:02] natural condition. What matters is will
[1:34:04] you get in the presence of life and stay
[1:34:05] there. I love to talk about her because
[1:34:08] she's a perfect example of what happens
[1:34:10] when light comes your way. Remember
[1:34:13] Jesus talks to her. She says, "You're
[1:34:16] not like other Jews. You you talk to me
[1:34:17] a Samaritan. You guys don't talk to me."
[1:34:20] He says, "If you knew who I was talking
[1:34:22] you, who you were talking to, you'd
[1:34:23] understand."
[1:34:25] And he says, "Listen, if you drink what
[1:34:27] I gave you," he says, "you'd never
[1:34:29] thirst again." See, she was thirsting
[1:34:31] for life, church. She was thirsting for
[1:34:34] life. And she'd been expressing it in
[1:34:35] every way except life. It was death.
[1:34:39] And so, he comes to her and he talks to
[1:34:41] her. He says, "Now watch that woman.
[1:34:43] Watch these Pharisees and the trained
[1:34:45] up-ups." You see, they said, "This man
[1:34:46] is Beelzebub. He's a devil. Look, when
[1:34:49] that light flashed across that little
[1:34:51] predestinated seed there, when it struck
[1:34:54] that real seed of God that before the
[1:34:56] foundation of the world, her name was
[1:34:57] put on the lamb's look of life." When it
[1:34:59] struck that, she quick, he says, quickly
[1:35:02] she recognized it.
[1:35:05] But I want you to catch the last bit.
[1:35:08] in her condition. She recognized it. The
[1:35:13] condition of your of your your your
[1:35:15] physical body of your life matters not
[1:35:18] at all. What matters is there's
[1:35:20] something on the inside to recognize to
[1:35:22] receive that light as it crosses your
[1:35:24] path. And that's what matters more than
[1:35:26] anything.
[1:35:29] He says, "Brother, I say that woman knew
[1:35:31] more about God right then than half the
[1:35:32] people in the United States." Why?
[1:35:36] Certainly not because of her good works.
[1:35:38] Certainly not because of her theology.
[1:35:42] Because she was ordained before the
[1:35:45] foundation of the world. Hallelujah.
[1:35:49] Hallelujah. This morning. Amen. That
[1:35:51] woman we know was well taught in her
[1:35:53] day. That woman had good spiritual
[1:35:56] questions. That woman knew her Bible.
[1:35:58] That woman went to church. Maybe that
[1:36:00] woman had a good pastor. I don't know.
[1:36:01] She was raised around the word of God.
[1:36:03] But that didn't hold her.
[1:36:06] Parents, are you listening? What's
[1:36:08] holding our kids is not that they're
[1:36:10] coming to church. It's good. Keep doing
[1:36:13] it. But what's going to hold them for
[1:36:15] eternity is when they come in contact
[1:36:17] with the life of that word. That's the
[1:36:19] only way it's going to happen. She knew
[1:36:22] what was right.
[1:36:24] She knew what she was supposed to do.
[1:36:26] She knew the life that she was supposed
[1:36:27] to be living, but she couldn't live it,
[1:36:30] church. But I'll tell you one thing. She
[1:36:33] knew what to expect. Her
[1:36:37] only hope, her only hope was Messiah.
[1:36:42] And she was looking for Messiah cuz she
[1:36:44] said, "When he comes, he'll tell us what
[1:36:45] you're telling me."
[1:36:47] What happened? The light shone on her
[1:36:50] life. And it showed her what her problem
[1:36:52] was.
[1:36:55] It showed her the symptom. The symptom
[1:36:58] was you keep going back to men. The
[1:37:00] problem was you've got a thirst.
[1:37:05] The problem was you've got a thirst.
[1:37:07] See, we're trying to fix the women and
[1:37:10] the men and the relationships and the
[1:37:12] lust and the this and the that. That's
[1:37:15] just a symptom. You've got a thirst that
[1:37:19] you haven't satiated yet. He says, "If
[1:37:21] you drink what I'm giving to you, you'll
[1:37:23] never thirst again. You'll never thirst
[1:37:26] again." She knew the letter of the word.
[1:37:28] But church, remember, the letter on its
[1:37:31] own kills because we can't live it. And
[1:37:34] so it leads to a life of frustration and
[1:37:36] condemnation. And we end up sitting in
[1:37:39] darkness saying, "I can't do it. I can't
[1:37:40] do it. I can't do it." And you're
[1:37:42] exactly right. We can't do it. But under
[1:37:45] the blood of Christ by the Holy Spirit,
[1:37:47] see, the letter kleth, but the spirit
[1:37:50] quickenth.
[1:37:52] And what happened? What made all the
[1:37:54] difference? When the spirit came her
[1:37:56] way, when the living word stood before
[1:37:58] her, when light flashed across her path,
[1:38:02] something came to life.
[1:38:04] She started drinking from a different
[1:38:05] well.
[1:38:07] And that thirst was quenched. And all of
[1:38:09] a sudden, she's doing the convincing
[1:38:11] rather than being convinced.
[1:38:13] Just a moment. Amen. She was trying to
[1:38:16] satisfy her thirst with men, with
[1:38:18] relationships, with validation.
[1:38:23] intimacy, all those different things.
[1:38:25] But that one moment in in the presence
[1:38:27] of Christ, she realized, I'm a child.
[1:38:29] I'm a daughter of God, and I don't have
[1:38:31] to live like this anymore. I don't want
[1:38:33] to live like this anymore. I won't live
[1:38:37] like this anymore.
[1:38:41] Too many times we're doing what that
[1:38:43] woman's doing, seeking natural solutions
[1:38:46] to a supernatural thirst. Absolutely.
[1:38:50] Been there, done that, and if we're
[1:38:52] honest, probably still doing it in areas
[1:38:54] of our life.
[1:38:59] Sure.
[1:39:01] But it will never satiate.
[1:39:04] It will never satisfy.
[1:39:06] And you'll stop you'll you'll finish
[1:39:08] your drink of whatever that is,
[1:39:11] and you'll still have something that
[1:39:12] you're longing for.
[1:39:15] Why? Because you're thirsting for life.
[1:39:19] Not entertainment,
[1:39:21] not validation,
[1:39:23] not intimacy.
[1:39:25] No, you're looking for something from
[1:39:27] the eternities. That's what's the desire
[1:39:30] in your heart. Amen. The root issue is
[1:39:32] so many times we're fighting death with
[1:39:35] more death.
[1:39:37] [clears throat]
[1:39:39] Isn't that the truth?
[1:39:42] You need life to take care of death. You
[1:39:44] need light to take care of darkness.
[1:39:46] We're fighting darkness with more
[1:39:47] darkness. That will never work. It'll
[1:39:51] never work. It'll just take you into a
[1:39:52] further and further spiral. And like I
[1:39:54] said, you'll be sitting on the sidelines
[1:39:56] in darkness saying, "Where is my God?"
[1:39:59] You need light. You need life. Amen. We
[1:40:03] can't do what everyone else in this
[1:40:05] world does.
[1:40:06] Let me say it this way. You don't need
[1:40:08] to do what the brother or sister next to
[1:40:10] you in the pew is doing. God leads them.
[1:40:13] Let him lead you. Let him feed you.
[1:40:16] We've all got different thirsts inside
[1:40:17] of us. Sure we do. Because we look
[1:40:20] around, we see where our little mistakes
[1:40:22] are. Your thirsts are different than
[1:40:24] mine. But there's something that
[1:40:25] satisfies those. And it's an eternal
[1:40:27] life. Amen. It's a It's the word. It's
[1:40:30] the water of the word. Amen. We're
[1:40:32] closing here. And I just want to throw
[1:40:34] this thought out here before we close
[1:40:36] this morning.
[1:40:39] Light can be scary.
[1:40:42] Light can be scary. You know there are
[1:40:44] some things hate light. Cockroaches hate
[1:40:46] light.
[1:40:48] You know what hates light? Unbelief.
[1:40:51] Our human nature, pride, our genetics.
[1:40:57] You want some evidence of that? Go look
[1:40:58] at your social media feed sometime.
[1:41:01] People only put up the best pictures of
[1:41:04] the best moments of the this, the that,
[1:41:07] and the other thing, and they present
[1:41:08] the best of their life.
[1:41:11] for everyone to feed on.
[1:41:14] I've got people post pictures and I
[1:41:16] don't even recognize them. They've
[1:41:18] applied so many filters to take away
[1:41:20] their skin issues and their hair issues
[1:41:22] and their teeth issues and their nose
[1:41:24] issues and their weight issues. Why?
[1:41:27] Because they want people to see them the
[1:41:28] way they want to be rather than what
[1:41:30] they are.
[1:41:32] My wife shared something. She said, "You
[1:41:34] know, I noticed it's no one in this
[1:41:35] church. I notic so and so. She'd always
[1:41:38] post this." I said, ' That's because she
[1:41:39] wants everyone else to appreciate her,
[1:41:41] not just her husband.
[1:41:44] She put all that work into getting
[1:41:45] pretty to go on a date, and she wants
[1:41:48] everyone else to see how good she looks.
[1:41:52] What is it? She's seeking validation.
[1:41:56] If all we can do is share the best,
[1:42:00] there's a problem there. Cuz light
[1:42:04] manifests, it reveals all things. And
[1:42:07] the simple fact is if we just take a
[1:42:08] picture, people are going to see the
[1:42:10] scar. They're going to see the pimple.
[1:42:11] They're going to see the weight. They're
[1:42:12] going to see the tiredness, the bags
[1:42:13] under the eyes.
[1:42:15] And that's what light reveals. If you
[1:42:17] put a harsh light on somebody in
[1:42:19] photography, you know, I do photography.
[1:42:20] Nobody wants harsh light because harsh
[1:42:23] light shows every fault and flaw and bad
[1:42:26] feature.
[1:42:29] But light is the only answer.
[1:42:31] Light's the only answer that we've got.
[1:42:34] If you approach everything trying to
[1:42:36] hide
[1:42:38] and not letting the light in, you'll
[1:42:41] only deal with symptoms instead of
[1:42:42] roots.
[1:42:45] You've got to let the light take you
[1:42:46] into the full depth of it.
[1:42:49] Jesus said the Holy Spirit would do a
[1:42:51] number of things, but one of them is
[1:42:52] that he said he'd lead you into all
[1:42:53] truth. And if you're a born again child
[1:42:56] of God, there's one thing you know. The
[1:42:57] Holy Spirit will tell the truth. He'll
[1:43:01] tell the truth about you. will tell you
[1:43:02] the truth about your situations. And too
[1:43:04] many times we blame things on our our
[1:43:06] our church history, our genetics, our
[1:43:08] traditions, our family, our this and
[1:43:09] that and the other thing. But the simple
[1:43:11] thing is we need to be able to yield to
[1:43:12] God's will and word for us to get the
[1:43:16] results that he's looking for in our
[1:43:17] lives. Amen. We've got to see the truth
[1:43:19] of our situations, our lives, our
[1:43:23] bodies, our health, our relationships,
[1:43:26] our ministries.
[1:43:29] all these things through the filter of
[1:43:31] one thing, the full light of God's word.
[1:43:36] Church, it's all going to be revealed in
[1:43:37] the end no matter what. [laughter]
[1:43:39] I'd rather deal with it now. God help me
[1:43:42] to have that attitude tomorrow when I he
[1:43:45] wants to deal with me on something, but
[1:43:47] I'd rather deal with it now rather than
[1:43:50] deal with it in front of the entire
[1:43:51] world.
[1:43:54] Because the things that were done in
[1:43:55] secret are going to be revealed. The
[1:43:57] things that were done in darkness are
[1:43:59] going to be shown.
[1:44:02] It's going to come out one way or the
[1:44:03] other. But the purpose of that light
[1:44:06] shining on us, so often it feels
[1:44:09] embarrassing,
[1:44:10] but it's not meant to embarrass.
[1:44:14] It's meant to bring life.
[1:44:17] It's meant to bring us higher. God's got
[1:44:20] to let us see our real condition,
[1:44:23] naturally speaking, so he can take us
[1:44:25] into our original condition.
[1:44:27] Spiritually speaking, redemption means
[1:44:29] you got to realize I'm coming out of
[1:44:31] something and going into something. And
[1:44:33] if all we say is, I don't need to come
[1:44:34] out of anything, how can redemption
[1:44:37] work? It's a process of time. It's an
[1:44:40] everyday thing that's going on. Amen.
[1:44:43] You know, too often we can spiritualize
[1:44:44] things. A name comes to mind even now.
[1:44:47] People that will spiritualize issues
[1:44:49] they have and they'll never address it
[1:44:51] because they made it spiritual and
[1:44:53] they've tied their spiritual identity to
[1:44:55] it.
[1:44:57] instead of just saying, "You know what?
[1:44:59] I've got some things the Lord needs to
[1:45:00] take care of in my life." When we can
[1:45:02] get to that level of honesty, that's
[1:45:05] when we'll start to see changes.
[1:45:09] The word is a mirror,
[1:45:12] not a rifle.
[1:45:14] It's not to shoot everybody else. It's
[1:45:15] to look at yourself and say, "Lord,
[1:45:21] I'm seeing one thing,
[1:45:24] but when I look in the mirror, I'm
[1:45:25] seeing something else." When I look in
[1:45:27] the light of the word, Lord, I'm seeing
[1:45:29] some gaps. I'm seeing some flaws, seeing
[1:45:32] some pimples.
[1:45:34] Lord, help me.
[1:45:37] I want to read this quote before we
[1:45:38] close this morning. He says, "We've
[1:45:40] adopted every kind of an idea, all kinds
[1:45:43] of schools and theologies and everything
[1:45:45] when the Holy Ghost ought to be leading
[1:45:47] us." Now, that's the reason why the
[1:45:49] church is in the condition it is today.
[1:45:51] It's being man-led and not spiritled.
[1:45:54] Sons and daughters of God are led by one
[1:45:58] thing, the spirit of God. The spirit of
[1:46:01] God is to lead the church. He says, "Now
[1:46:03] men might say anything,
[1:46:06] but the Holy Spirit will tell the truth
[1:46:08] on you.
[1:46:10] See, we say the Holy Spirit will tell us
[1:46:12] the truth, but sometimes he's got to
[1:46:14] tell us the truth on us.
[1:46:17] You know, the hardest thing to do is
[1:46:18] tell somebody you like and admire,
[1:46:21] "You got a problem."
[1:46:26] I've had friends come to me and say,
[1:46:29] "Can I talk to you about something?" And
[1:46:31] I respect them for that because that's
[1:46:32] the hardest thing to do is to accept
[1:46:35] correction. But I believe that's the
[1:46:37] Holy Spirit in a person's life that can
[1:46:40] help them help me. But here's the thing.
[1:46:44] By God's grace, we don't have to have
[1:46:46] people come tell us if we'll just lay on
[1:46:48] us and let the Holy Spirit do the
[1:46:50] telling on us. That's why we come to
[1:46:52] church. It's a house of correction. It's
[1:46:55] a house of teaching us what is right.
[1:46:57] And where we are in error, we just say,
[1:47:00] "Lord, let your word have its truth. Let
[1:47:02] your word be right.
[1:47:05] I don't have that, but Lord, let your
[1:47:06] word be right. Just like Mary, be it
[1:47:09] unto me according to your word. That's
[1:47:12] what the light's here to do. And when
[1:47:14] that light comes, life always follows.
[1:47:18] And it's lasting. And it's fruit of the
[1:47:21] spirit. It's not just temporary works,
[1:47:24] but it's something that holds.
[1:47:27] And it keeps producing and keeps
[1:47:29] producing and keeps producing. Amen. God
[1:47:32] bless you. Let's stand this morning.
[1:47:34] [snorts]
[1:47:36] You know, I've had some rough times in
[1:47:38] my life where the Holy Spirit told the
[1:47:39] truth on me.
[1:47:41] I've had special meetings where it seems
[1:47:44] like the only person there was me.
[1:47:49] That's rough.
[1:47:51] Maybe I'm the only one ever experienced
[1:47:53] that where it seems like the preacher
[1:47:55] knew everything that you had going on in
[1:47:57] the last six months.
[1:48:01] But I'll tell you one thing, in those
[1:48:03] moments and in those times, because
[1:48:04] usually it's not just a moment, it's
[1:48:06] extended.
[1:48:08] I had no time to raise my hand and raise
[1:48:11] my head and look around and say, "Well,
[1:48:12] sister so and so sure needs some help."
[1:48:15] Well, brother so and so is sure sliding
[1:48:17] fast these days. Why? Cuz he's working
[1:48:19] on me. And if I'm honest, that's
[1:48:22] probably the best way we can be is is
[1:48:25] Lord, let's keep the focus on me for
[1:48:28] when it comes to change when it comes to
[1:48:31] growth.
[1:48:34] But the the the beautiful thing about
[1:48:36] God is that he doesn't because those are
[1:48:38] humbling moments. He doesn't humble us
[1:48:41] to keep us down. He humbles us so he can
[1:48:44] raise us to the position that we have in
[1:48:47] him that he's ordained for us. But he's
[1:48:50] got to take everything of us out so he
[1:48:53] can add all of himself back in. And
[1:48:55] God's redemptive work is to undo what
[1:48:57] Satan's been trying to pile on us since
[1:48:59] the day we were born.
[1:49:02] And some of us are carrying a lot of
[1:49:03] things he's piled on us.
[1:49:06] I'll tell you this, God's here to set us
[1:49:08] free from prison,
[1:49:10] to scatter the darkness, to bring life
[1:49:14] where death used to be.
[1:49:17] Churches, as I said before, when the
[1:49:19] Holy Spirit comes into the situation,
[1:49:21] it's game over.
[1:49:24] It's game over.
[1:49:26] The battle's over.
[1:49:29] The result is guaranteed. Doesn't mean
[1:49:32] there's not a span of time.
[1:49:35] But when the light of God's word enters
[1:49:37] your situation by revelation, that's it.
[1:49:41] That's it. And the gates of hell can't
[1:49:44] prevail against it. Amen.
[1:49:47] Amen. Let's bow our heads if we would.
[1:49:52] Heavenly Father,
[1:49:56] Lord, I'm asking for your light this
[1:49:57] morning.
[1:49:59] Lord, as I've ministered
[1:50:02] this message you laid on my heart,
[1:50:05] Lord, I pray that we would just open up
[1:50:06] our hearts and our souls and our lives
[1:50:08] and our minds,
[1:50:10] Lord, and we'd let light shine,
[1:50:13] Lord. that your Holy Spirit would tell
[1:50:14] the truth on us this morning.
[1:50:18] Lord, to go to the root of the issue,
[1:50:21] the root of the problem, the root of the
[1:50:23] attitude, the root of our health, the
[1:50:26] root of our marriage, the root of our
[1:50:27] jobs, careers, Lord, whatever it might
[1:50:29] be, Lord, whatever the circumstances
[1:50:32] are, may your light shine and give us
[1:50:35] your truth, heavenly father. Lord, and
[1:50:38] whatever it shows, Lord, I pray you'd
[1:50:41] help us to accept it.
[1:50:43] Lord, that we would just look to you to
[1:50:46] trust your word, your process, your way,
[1:50:49] your time, Lord, to lay aside everything
[1:50:51] else that would rise against it,
[1:50:54] Lord, that life would come forth, Lord.
[1:50:57] We need you every single day,
[1:51:01] Lord. And I want us to invite this
[1:51:02] morning you into every situation of our
[1:51:05] lives, Lord. You see where our prayers
[1:51:07] are, Lord. You see where our children
[1:51:09] are. You see where our jobs and
[1:51:12] companies are, Lord. You see where our
[1:51:14] marriages are. You see where our health
[1:51:15] is, Lord. You see all of these things,
[1:51:20] Lord. But what I'm asking in all of
[1:51:22] those things is that your truth would
[1:51:24] prevail,
[1:51:25] Lord. That you would
[1:51:27] expose
[1:51:29] Satan, Lord, where he has taken hold in
[1:51:32] our life, Lord. where we are living
[1:51:34] below our privileges, Lord, where we're
[1:51:36] struggling and trying and stumbling in
[1:51:38] the dark, Lord. I pray you bring light
[1:51:41] this morning,
[1:51:43] Lord, for when you do, life will follow.
[1:51:46] Strengthen your people this morning,
[1:51:47] heavenly father. Minister to them, each
[1:51:50] one we pray, Lord God, Jesus name we ask
[1:51:52] and pray. Amen. Pour your spirit out on
[1:51:56] me. 12:21
[1:52:04] Lord, I seek you.
[1:52:09] Help me find you.
[1:52:13] How I need your touch.
[1:52:20] [music] Find my dry [singing]
[1:52:25] broken places.
[1:52:28] thirsty for [music] your love.
[1:52:36] Lord, forgive me [music]
[1:52:40] if I've wondered
[1:52:44] far away [singing] from you.
[1:52:51] You [music] are all I
[1:52:55] ever needed.

[1:53:48] And Lord, I seek you. [music]
[1:53:52] Help me find you.
[1:53:56] How [music] I need your touch.
[1:54:03] Find my dry [music]
[1:54:07] broken faces.
[1:54:11] Thirst me for your love.
[1:54:15] [music]
[1:54:18] Lord, forgive me
[1:54:22] if [music] I wondered
[1:54:26] far [singing] away from you.
[1:54:32] For [music] you are all I
[1:54:37] ever needed.
[1:54:41] Come and [music] make me new.
[1:54:46] Pour [music] your spirit out on me.
[1:54:51] Fall just [music and singing] like the
[1:54:52] rain.
[1:54:56] Saturate
[1:54:58] my [music] thirsty soul.
[1:55:01] Come and [singing] fall aresh on me.
[1:55:06] Fill my cup [music] again.
[1:55:10] Fill my heart and make me whole. Oh,
[1:55:16] [music]
[1:55:18] I need you now.
[1:55:21] Pour your spirit [music and singing] out
[1:55:25] and pour your spirit out on me.
[1:55:29] [music] Fall just like the rain.
[1:55:34] saturate.
[1:55:36] [music]
[1:55:45] Fill [music] my cup again.

[1:55:56] I need [music]
[1:55:58] you now. Pour your spirit [music]
[1:56:02] out.
[1:56:04] And I want to go there.
[1:56:10] [music] 10:57
[1:56:13] where my feet are on. [music]
[1:56:20] I want to hide where the cares of this
[1:56:25] world cannot be true. It's in your
[1:56:29] presence, oh God. [music]
[1:56:33] In your presence,
[1:56:37] [music]
[1:56:38] that's where I am strong. In your
[1:56:42] presence,
[1:56:44] [music]
[1:56:45] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[1:56:50] [music]
[1:56:53] that's where I belong. [music]
[1:56:57] seeking your face,
[1:57:00] touching your grace [music]
[1:57:05] in the clth of [singing] the rock.
[1:57:12] [music] in your presence, oh God.
[1:57:18] And I walk [music] to hide [singing]
[1:57:21] where the blood of evil cannot reach me,
[1:57:25] [music]
[1:57:27] where I'm covered by the blood.
[1:57:32] [music]
[1:57:33] I want to be where the schemes of
[1:57:38] darkness cannot touch me. [music]
[1:57:41] It's in your presence, oh God. [music]

[2:08:37] to hell where it came from, Lord.
[2:08:41] Father, your son minister this weekend.
[2:08:43] Lord,
[2:08:45] I just pray, Father,
[2:08:47] you touch someone who's crying out to
[2:08:49] you, Lord.
[2:08:53] Sometimes, Father, it's it's it's
[2:08:55] hard as a man, Lord,
[2:08:59] that you always provide a way, Lord. And
[2:09:00] we just thank you for that.
[2:09:03] I pray, Father God, for brother John,
[2:09:07] Lord. I pray that you restore him,
[2:09:09] Father God, and continue to anoint him,
[2:09:13] anoint his thoughts, Lord, and how to
[2:09:14] lead his people.
[2:09:17] I pray for his family, Father.
