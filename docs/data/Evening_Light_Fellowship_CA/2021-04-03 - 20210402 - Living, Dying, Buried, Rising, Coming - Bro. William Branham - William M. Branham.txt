resurrection yes i can't go in the rapture yes lord oh we got this plan and i hope we get this done before the resurrection what you what you want to want god to delay this and delay that what for oh because we got to do this we got to do that no no not by any means as the bride of christ it's the seed of god we're looking for him to come any time lord you want to interfere with these plans that i got made good praise the lord interfere with the lord and to take us home amen but i tell you this there's a lot of believers they got that attitude and that spirit they're focusing more on what they want to do here what they're going to experience here amen in the natural but brother sister if you're a bride if you're elect you just lord we'll do this as paul said if the lord willing no matter what you plan amen is based on the will of god amen well i'm going to do this i'm going to do this i got to go here and i got to go there oh but lord if you will if it's your will if not lord you're going to you can come any time amen any hour any minute of the day brother we're we're waiting for him to come lord oh yes jesus i'll tell you this he's going to come in an hour brother when we got oh we got this made up and we got this plan and this this this purpose of that no no we're living though if the lord tarries amen i'll do this if he doesn't goodbye amen by the grace of god amen oh exactly brother amen that is your attitude but i'll tell you this a lot of believers god the attitude we don't want no i hope he doesn't come yet i hope he doesn't come today i hope he doesn't come tomorrow oh we got to do this we got to do that brother they may not say it but their actions prove it amen that's their attitude that's their spirit amen but brother greg by the grace of god lord we got these plans and this and this and this but lord whatever your will is amen your will be done not mine amen and lord you know because of our experience with you we got a hunger and we got a thirst amen because of our revelation we want to get out of here amen we want to get out of these bodies in the glorified bodies amen we want to get out of time into eternity you know why we're going home but there's too many there's too many got the same attitude and spirit that we're home this is all mere no it's not but what god has done and what god is doing amen is giving us the revelation of home where you see he was with us even in us before the foundation of the world amen so i was with him by the grace of god hallelujah he said well what a revelation what a revelation he said no man has ascended up only he that came down even the son of man who is in heaven how many got that revelation amen brother we are in heaven amen and we're serving him and laying down our lives so that why so he's going he's going to take control amen more and more until he's got absolute control and brother he raptures us amen brother don't miss it again because they say he said it's in the word amen and it was a prophet maybe a quote that that that i was reading from the prophet oh but lord this will be a rapture this will be this this will be there where is it always has already happened and you didn't know it oh brother sister amen do we know the rapture is already on amen amen we're not we will be cut up we are being caught up amen and the emphasis we put on this natural life is proof that we're not here amen we're pilgrims and we're strangers amen if you went to a foreign country well they know he's a pilgrim he's a stranger he's just doing what he got to do and move on because he's looking forward to getting back home amen how many of the elect of god are looking forward to getting back home amen god i pray god make it more and more real to us amen so this is not religion amen it's a real spiritual experience amen of of who i am where i come from why i'm here where i'm going by the grace of god your life the life you live proves the revelation you got amen and there are there are those brothers that go and live that life they lived the life of a pilgrim and a stranger oh you're not interested in this oh those out there you're not interested or they're not interested in this they're not interested in that they're religious i'll tell you this one time every age every revival of the god sent it produced in the seed of god that attitude and that spirit go let's go let's go let's go they weren't they weren't putting no emphasis on the natural things of life no no they only did what what god wanted them to do the will of god the will of god i'm doing this the lord leader the lord's in control amen and i don't know who it was i think there i noticed there's a ministry on the internet there i was doing something doing something and i i left it there and i went on and did this did that and then i come back oh who's that and there was this preacher preaching and he was preaching that attitude amen about having what being caught up with the revelation we're going home amen caught up with the revelation that we don't we're not we're not citizens of this world amen we're citizens of the world to come amen and i've got that hunger and that thirst for eternity as jesus amen jesus wanted it and i said we've got to come to this place in the revelation of jesus because jesus came to that place in his ministry and he said how long shall i be with you amen why he wanted to go what yes he wanted to get out of this world and into the kingdom of god again back into eternity and brother if that's where we come from amen that's where we're going amen we'll have the same attitude that jesus said lord we want to get out of here because this whole world's getting worse amen and lord i pray grace that you'll have more control over us by the grace of allah amen and that the revelation of god will have more control over us we're living amen not based on what we want to do and how we want to do it when we want to do it and where no brother grace of god our lives are based on where we come from where we're going and we want to get back there amen by the grace of almighty god but there's too many believers too many so-called christians are more caught up with the things of the world they want to stay here they want to oh you just we need to enjoy ourselves what i tell you the only enjoyment we got is the revelation of god amen is the revelation of eternity it's a revelation of redemption praise the lord hallelujah amen we're hungry and thirsty for it now we've got the revelation he's done it amen we're redeemed and now he's in us to take us home amen because god has sent us a man to work out his plan its purpose according to his pattern amen so what are we hungry for the foolishness of this world or eternity i tell you this if you're a christian real christian filled with the holy ghost oh the world will recognize it oh they're not living for this well they're living for the for their religion no it's not our religion it's our home and it's our glorified body i pray god help us truly sincerely no well brother if we are seed we will bring forth the life of his seed if we are saved we'll have the attitude of the seed of god we are seen we'll have the attitude of jesus oh how long shall i be with you oh i'm going home yeah yeah i'm going home now amen he knew the hour was coming at the third pole he's going to lay down his life but he better when he pick it up again amen if he picked it up again brother he'd it would take him back to eternity by the grace of god and i trust by grace that we got the revelation of who we are why we're here where we come from amen by the grace of god how are we getting back yeah how we came back what god what god has ordained predestinated for to take us back we're part of it now amen because what god has done in the opening of the seven seals the revelation of the mystery of god is to the prophet highlighted it is to give us rapturing faith amen amen because he wants you to go home amen you will not just want you to go home because you you want to go home and he's here to respond to that and just like again i keep bringing back these examples of joshua and caleb oh my coming out of egypt with moses and all the others and all the others they were they were just satisfied with oh just this world they're satisfied well everything is fine here oh but they didn't like when they went into the into the promised land oh they were going not by faith but by sight yeah when they saw this i saw that oh my if we come in here they're going they're going to defeat us joshua caleb didn't believe that because they said if god before us who can be against us amen well i promise we got that revelation and we got the same hunger and thirst for eternity as joshua caleb for the promised land oh yeah brother even after even after 40 years in the wilderness they were still hungry and still thirsting amen they were right there to lead another generation into the promised land because god had to take the other generation off the earth amen why because they because they were not believing they were not trusting god and that's certainly not like joshua and caleb no joshua and cater trusted god and again caleb and old man and he said well if god before us who can be against us amen brother this is not man this is god amen we're not under the ministry of a man under the ministry of god so god help us brother to believe god help us to press on by grace amen oh brother it is closer than what sometimes we we believe amen right amen because again we're not going to we're just going to go from step out of this dimension and do another one amen but i pray to god that he'll quicken the faith quicken the revelation that we have amen to the reality of eternity not we're not religious we're spiritual amen there's too many religious people and religious religiousness religious that but how many are spiritual getting into the revelation of the word amen amen to know what god has done yeah through william branham and to know what god is doing through the ministry that was left behind amen of the revealed word amen and through what and having the revelation what god is going to do amen as he he's pouring into us the revelation the revelation and the more we get into the word the word and us the more we're going to be separated from the world not interested in the world no no that's right not interested in the world oh people are too much caught up with this and this and this they're doing this they're doing this they're doing that but i'll tell you it's the election of god we're dead to all those things amen and we become alive to him amen alive to what he's doing more conscious of what he's doing and again don't be offended but again don't don't let your family your friends or your neighbors distract you you stay your relationship is to stay with the word amen and to get into the revelation of what god is doing and the devil is there to distract you then he is is there to get distracted or get you more caught up with this more caught up with that oh now look when you need to do this you got to do this you got to do that no no lord what do you want me to do amen so i pray grace in the name of jesus to let go and let god have his way amen and again i assume my brother bob mentioned the prayer request for sister beverly and brother doug's gail by doug gale's grandson amen so pray pray pray for our brother our brother and sister's grandchild i understand that it's i think it's supposed to be here in st john's there at the time that sister beverly called me yesterday or last evening or sometime yesterday they were waiting on the arrival of a plane to bring them to the city so we pray the grace of god for sister beverly and brother doug's grandchild and it is a grandson and it is i think the child of their daughters at rebecca let's try their daughter rebecca so the grace of god be with them amen brother oh my god help us we got if we got power for the resurrection rapture we got the power for healing if you've got the power to change the body you've got the power to heal the body amen and pray for that grace for our brother elsewhere there amen as he's supposed to have 28 radiation treatments and he's had a few now since he's been here this week so we pray the grace of god to be with him as he continues on amen and brother yeah we got to do it by faith oh yeah go trusting the lord because the prophet did say that god heals through medicine god he goes through doctors and so on and it's like there was that lady that sister that came into the into the prayer line one time with one of her children and and the proud of god told her this he said now he said you go out and he said something about a bus or something and and you go here go there he said when you get off he said there'd be a lady there sitting i'm not on the sidewalk amen and she'll greet you and she'll ask you this and while you're here and so on and you tell her and she'll say oh just think this is god revealing this to through the prophet for her need and he said she's going to tell you she said about a doctor they know who will look after this what oh we think oh god got to heal brother brown got a heal no no no no for some reason god a lot or maybe for our reason god allow amen great time to the end and he said always you just go to that doctor and he'll look after and he did and the child never had no problems after amen so brother god help us to have faith in god no matter what we're doing in those circumstances situations let's believe god amen we're trusting jesus amen lord if i do this you're with me if i do this you're in me amen believe me lord this is your leadership not my will father thine be done amen but there's too many seeking their own will and they want god to do this god to do that no no you do what god wants you to do amen and there's not many going around with that that that spirit of the will of god are they j just feel i'm going to do this and i believe god will bless me i do this god will bless me god's going to bless you with his will not my will father thine be done amen so the grace of god be with sister beverly and brother doug's grandson at this this moment and the child is 10 months old and it's very young but it says he's experiencing very serious dehydration so the grace of god be with them amen and also again oh yes to i want to thank our brother jonathan for the ministry amen amen and while i i was gone and what i've been maybe by the grace of god helping our brother ellsworth here sister ellsworth in the things that they need to have done so we're serving one another amen and again what we do is what god did for us we're doing for one another and that proves you've got the spirit of god in you that's where you've got the spirit of jesus in you amen as jesus amen did this for this did that that that you got the same spirit and hunger and thirst and care and concern for one another amen just consider again that that when jesus was going here jesus was going there amen and then he oh yeah while they were in a certain place there in the city oh this this burial parade came and they were moving on moving on and what was it they were carrying the body of a young man and they was a teenage man a boy again on the stretcher and behind was his mother weeping because he had died they were taken to the cemetery amen and what did jesus do oh wait wait and he walked over and laid his hands on this on the young man and he came back to life amen and jesus took him to his mother amen praise the lord amen do we have that same care and concern for one another amen and you have that same care and concern for others out there and as i said keep your attitude right your spirit rate and i said brother i've been fighting this spirit ever since i come to the message and again i i violated a number of times recently saying that the first sermon that i preach was was exhorting the people keep your attitude right keep your spirit right don't you point your fingers at that person up there and say oh they're they're this church they're that church listen brother the grace of god to us is the grace of god to them and the prophet of god said as long as the bride is on the earth he said there be grace amen so we're going to show grace by the grace of god grace for us we want grace for them exactly you know you're not there to condemn them and send them to hell but there's a lot of believers i know brother over the years i've heard those sermons and they praised the praise and everybody out there was going to hell and the only ones going to heaven was it was them no no as i said this is bride and the proud of god warned us and highlighted us amen what he said now this message won't go to everybody no no but he said now the revelation of jesus as our lord and savior it will go around the world he said because it's going to go here and go there the bible says amen that's right and even after the bride is gone amen there there will be somebody with the witness of jesus and they lay down their lives for it in the tribute great tribulation amen so brother again many are because i've said many calls few chosen we're bright i trust we're the chosen amen but still there's going to be many called well if they're not where where did all those outside the city come from amen the new jerusalem because the bible the bible says new jerusalem the bride is going to be in there with the bridegroom amen and the bible speaks up again too there's thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands amen and millions amen that witness the uniting of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride oh yeah they witnessed it and and they went the prophecy they went back to sleep again they're not lost and again remind me let me remind you again what when then when the the angel rebuked the prophet because he had a critical spirit concerning that girl walking the street wearing slacks he said don't you call her reggie or richards he said some of them are my children amen by the grace of god thank god for that hope amen that you can commit your family your sons your daughters your your friends your neighbors into the hands of god and move on amen because god do with all things well amen so keep our our spirit and our attitude right because i know there's a lot of believers that i that i've experienced over the years that got that con attitude to condemn to criticize to judge no brother sister we're going to judge we'll judge amen but the but again the problem of god when he was condemning that woman in the restaurant and the angel pulled him away he said come here and he went there and the angels told him this is you he said this is what you did because now you want to condemn her and he's a voice for jesus you be condemned amen we are all sinners saved by grace amen but some is is the elect bride so i pray grace in the name of jesus amen lord keep our spirits right in our attitude right jesus had a right spirit and right attitude even to the scribes and pharisees amen to god be the glory amen and again to thank our brother jonathan for ministering and filling in god bless you amen and uh also uh just to pray ask you to pray again for our brother ellsworth and sister ellsworth amen as that we continue with him through to the to the hospital and for the treatments that he's given and receiving so grace of god amen and also you see let's see okay just be in prayer for the next few days because he's going to take a quite a few other trips to the hospital i think he's there for another couple of weeks amen to get all the treatments that they want to give him which is to be 28 treatments of radiation so god be with us and our brother praise the lord our brother goes in comes out and he's fine you know he he's not burned there's not you don't feel this to feel that just move on amen and praise the lord amen do god be the glory amen also all right the lord bless us tonight we're going to hear a tape by the prophet and it's only i think 50 minutes or maybe less than that and uh its concerns easter what the world is celebrating and many will only really remember what jesus did on easter time and again there are those that don't know concerning easter because the emphasis is less and less emphasis put on easter amen so we pray the grace of god amen to the elect of god to the seed of god that we're going to remember calvary remember what he did for us by the grace of again it's like a somebody went and they were up you know maybe late teens early 20s and they just went to their grandmother and they said dan he said what what is easter all about and when his grandmother told me i said what he asked you that yes he said she said he he didn't know he and yet he was raised in a home so-called that believed in easter and believed this and believed that but they never put the answers on easter that that maybe mike his grandmother was and so he said oh he said i i just want to know what easter is all about he said he said they want to remember this and remember this remember that so what really happened and she had to explain to him what jesus did amen so that now he knows what happened easter now he's got the choice to accept it or reject it or ignore it don't ignore it please and don't ignore what god has done and don't ignore what god has been endeavoring to put our emphasis on amen why did god do what he did through william branham why did god do what he did and why is he doing what he's doing through you and me now brother it's for the resurrection and the rapture amen and brother he kept that that i said joshua and caleb had that hunger and that thirst for victory in the promised land amen and brother that's what would take them on and they would lead the younger generation on with them amen and as the prophet of god did did tell brother level i think and he said brother he said the older people around this message he said they'll go on to be with the lord he said they won't live up to the reserve up to the rapture they're there for the resurrection but they want because they wouldn't have that faith of the of the rapture god help us it's my prayer amen lord bless us and also sister colombo god bless you amen praise the lord and brother clumble not here anyway god bless brother colombo too and brother ellie and and the other members of the family praise the lord praise god lord bless us if you would would you turn with me to psalms chapter 22. psalms 22 and it is the scripture that brother branham read and preached on living dying buried rising coming and is the five attributes of the ministry of our lord jesus christ amen he was living he laid down his life died he was buried he rose again with the promise i'm coming back amen so that i trust by the grace of god we got the revelation of the promise he's come back amen because remember again the pillar of fire brother it's not willem brown it's god praise the name of the lord and even the sister one time that was laying in the hospital and uh and she was praying and she was praying for the lord to touch her a man and she had a picture there william branham with that pillar of fire and when she looked at it amen the pillar of fire come off the pitcher and over to her amen and she was healed praise the name of the lord hallelujah and the prophet has highlighted it he said that's not me that's him and again to remind ourselves again this right here the problem god said in 1964 65 and he said see there he is he's looking down at us amen it was christ by the grace of god and others have highlighted the fact that this what we see here on the side they said that's william branham he's there because he was caught up in the presence of those angels that were coming down god of us to believe god help us to move on to the resurrection the rapture and again the responsibility lays in your lap because he said he said god is waiting on us amen and he said the dead in christ are waiting on us brother we feel responsible to the to these living family friends neighbors were living here living there oh i got to do this i got to do that yo what does jesus want you to do are you are we really doing what god's expecting from us and god wants in us amen that's right we we got we had to look down god looked down and see oh that person is getting he's not a he's a pilgrim and he's a stranger oh yeah he he's looking he looks like it he's acting like it he's living like it he always just here hey man he's just here and he's getting ready to go home amen i trust we're getting ready to go home amen where are you going what are you doing this for what are you living this way for well we're trying we're going we're going out of here so just in case just in case you don't do it god bless you amen i trust we'll meet you in glory amen but we've got to move on with that faith the lord bless you and again brother brown preached this message in march of 1959 and i believe it might have been a sunrise service and so is living dying buried rising coming it's jesus amen and in psalms 22 and it's it's a lengthy psalm but the prophet of god read it all he read every verse and it says my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my god i cry in the daytime but thou hearst not and in the night season and am not silent but thou art holy whole thou that inabilities the praises of israel our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them they cried unto thee and were delivered amen they trusted in thee and were not confounded but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of all the the people all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him but thou art ye that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mother's breasts i was cast upon thee from the womb and thou art my god from my mother's belly amen be not far from me for trouble is nearly for there is none to help and many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bastion have beset me round and they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion i am poured out like water and my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels we were certainly born in sin amen we were born in the complete need of jesus soul body and spirit amen and verse 15 my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue clavet to my jaws and thou has brought me into the dust of death for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me and they pierced my hands and my feet i may tell my bones they look and stare at me they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture be not thou far from me o lord all my strength ace thou to help me deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog save me from the lion's mouth for thou has earned me from the horns of the unicorns i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee praise the lord amen and he that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel amen do god be the glory amen brother sister regardless as he said god you you never you never did this for me you didn't do that for me you didn't help me there you didn't help me there but he's giving god the glory amen for his grace praise the lord and i said ye that fear of the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him there him all ye the seed of israel thank god for his grace amen oh now that he did this he did this for me today he's going to do this he's going to no we thank him for what he's done amen praise the lord and so he that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel for he hath not despised nor abort the affliction of the afflicted amen neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried onto him he heard amen you put your trust in god regardless of whether you feel something or don't feel it amen you could be negative in the flesh but positive in your heart amen and that's what god's looking for amen when all that's going on in the world oh and then the flesh could be negative negative negative god's looking for the positive faith in your soul amen that regardless you still believe god regardless you still trust the lord regardless you still love the lord amen yes this is absolutely amazing amen but it's the proof of our citizenship with him amen it's the proof that we are the seed of god by the grace of god keep your attitude right your spirit rate amen for he has not despised nor abort the affliction of the afflicted and neither has he hid his face from him but when he cried on to him he heard no matter what you think what you say you know that god hears you you know that god sees you you know that god knows all about you he knows about your need amen and you've got a promise he will never leave you nor forsake you amen oh my god help us to believe god help us to have that everyday faith amen believing god so that amen praise the lord you walk in the spirit you live in the spirit amen by the grace of almighty god why because if you're born again just it's your it's your nature you've got a spiritual nature you've got a holy ghost nature you've got an eternal nature you're born again amen brother as i believe brother jonathan preaching on faith and he read read scripture after scripture i is true this is amazing this is tremendous but we were listening online amen concerning faith god help us that we really got faith amen not not intellectual thoughts that we agree with nor we got a holy ghost faith that believes god amen that god is more real to us than the one sitting next to you amen hallelujah you know that that one is not going to help but god is going to help amen that one can't give me this understanding but god gives me understanding amen i don't know i don't know and uh maybe i can consult them amen but but they're not they don't know god understands god sees god knows amen praise the name of the lord trust him put your faith in him put your confidence in him it's not you that lives as christ living in you amen and and through christ in us sometimes maybe he's going to do things and cause us to do things that we're just not you know we're not aware of what is this the will of god you know will god do this will god let god do what he wants to do amen grace gives faith what is the faith faith is the revelation of what he's doing amen not my will father thine be done amen he's bringing us to that place amen and that's why we're still here he's bringing out that faith amen and if there's anyone that recognizes that faith they're gonna be the devil you'll recognize it amen so grace of god that we believe grace of god that what god has promised for this hour this hate he's doing now in you well he's not going to do it he's doing it he's not going to resurrect and rapture no no he's doing it not that he will he is amen that's why amen we go from time to eternity yes but before we go from time to eternity we got to go we got to get it get out of the flesh and into the spirit amen instead of walking after the flesh and thinking after the flesh and doing this after the flesh no no flesh and control no it's the holy ghost in me in control amen so you got you got to walk in the spirit live in the spirit amen and you're going you're going to you're going to you're going to experience what the spirit is doing the spirit is here to make the word flesh amen and the spirit is here for you to trans to translate us from time to eternity oh yeah that's what god's doing too many are just looking back at what god did what god did what god did yeah well what's he doing brother what he did in this hour through the ministry of a prophet was to give us the faith of what he's doing give us the faith the revelation of what he's doing in your life in my life and why he's doing it amen and if we're bright we believe we don't doubt amen we oh lord thank you for the resurrection thank you for the rapture lord because i feel that anointing is taking control amen god help us and the more and more that the anointing of the resurrection rapture takes control the less we're going to be caught up with this whole world let we wonder why they want this one this one that look we want god and amen and everything we need god will give us amen he will it's what we need not what we want in our flesh no way amen and it says ye that fear the lord again it says praise him and all ye see to jacob glorify him amen and it says and fear him and well fear is not being afraid of him it's respecting him fear is respect if you think i got to be afraid of god no definitely not god is this god is that brother and this is like a when i was in in a certain sister's home one time or my grandfather was living there in that home and he came out and always said journal he had the scripture and he said girl he said i got a bible question i said what is it and he said oh the bible says that god is this i can't recall the exact word but it was describing what god was and the understanding that he had of that word was that oh my god was terrible god was this god was that does that brother he said gerald does that mean god is terrible and god is this god no i said that's displaying i said the righteousness of god the power of god amen and and i said this is what it means right there oh that's what he said oh thank you thank you and again and and again i was doing something in a house somewhere painting and then the door opened and then walked this gentleman and and he he he had become a a christian and he was in his 50s i say at the time and he didn't go to church that i know off but but eventually something touched him in his heart and his soul and he went to church and he went to an altar and he and he and he put himself in the hands of god as a christian amen and now he said and oh yeah he was born again you could tell that by the life he lived amen how he lived it and the ideas that he had now he was different now he was living for the lord but it's your journal i i got an answer i need an answer for this question and it concerns the lord's prayer and he said lord they said lead us not into deliver us from evil and lead us not into temptation and he said you mean to tell me that god leads us into temptation i said no i said brother that's that the the exact wording of that as it should be is asking god to deliver us from the tempter not lead us into temptation keep me away from the tempter and that's the devil oh he said thank you thank you this i'll never forget it he said that's good praise the lord it'll always be with me he said now i understand thank you and he walked out rejoicing and praising the lord amen that's the truth i wonder how many of us ever thought about that lead us not into temptation deliver us from evil i said deliver us no no i said god you're asking god to keep you from the devil's influence i said he's the one that put you in temptation he wanted to bring this temptation that temptation oh he said thank you now i understand amen praise the lord so he said for he hath done not despise nor abort the affliction of the afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried unto him he heard thank god my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation and i will pay my vows before them that fear him the meek shall eat and be satisfied and they shall praise the lord that seek him your heart shall live forever amen at the all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee amen for the kingdom is the lord's and he is the governor among the nations and they that be fat upon the earth shall eat and worship amen this world don't want that this world is over conscious of fat oh yeah they're always trying to lose weight lose weight oh yeah you leave that with the lord amen oh yeah i'm going to leave that with the lord amen oh yeah you get christians out there they're going to go out and do this and do that you know oh you're afraid to gain some weight well not my will lord thine be done amen oh brother that comes down to your personal relationship with jesus for sure oh yeah i'll tell you this there's not many who want israel in that situation they're asking god to do this do this do this lord take this away take this away forget it get in there and leave it in the hands of god and if he wants to do it he'll do it and if you don't you'll move on amen you just keep you going but this world is so caught up with diets and i tell you that's just as a type of their spiritual life amen they got spiritual diets and that's why they're so skinny spiritually oh yeah they're not they're not full grown sons and daughters of god or they're just skinny yeah instruments of the devil i have satan doing that satan can put your emphasis on that amen so you're thinking more about that the natural than the spiritual amen are we over overweight spiritually i don't think so amen brother god is in control amen brother it's up to him they say lord whatever you want me to do i'll do it if you want me to be this this heavy i'll stay with it amen but oh my there's so many all my their whole life is wrapped around a diet oh yeah morning noon and night diet you know should i do this should i do that oh my i can't do this i can't do it and leave it with god leave it with the lord he'll look after you yeah if if he wants you to gain some weight you'll gain it yeah and sometimes just to bring out the spirit that's in you yeah to bring up the attitude that's in you and again those others say you know they won't gain weight amazing i pray it's amazing what god does to test our faith it's amazing what god allows to test our faith to bring out our faith to make our faith flesh see the word is made flesh and dwelt among us now the words made flesh and dwelt in us amen because the prophet of god said now the word is made flesh in the bright now you the lips is the word living in you amen oh god help us to be spiritual spiritual sons and daughters of god living for god amen oh we couldn't just have that that faith just have that trust i'm just going to go on and leave with the lord but the devil is there to bring this to you because he knows he's going to distract you he knows he's going to get you worked up oh yeah and he he'll give you the all the negative the negative the negative amen you get more and more conscious of it leave it as i said that time when sister burns was washing her clothes and she had that washer there and now she said that oh my all of a sudden everything got dark in the room that she was in and all the negative things were coming on her this negative thought this negative thought this negative thought and things were getting worse and worse and worse and i finally usually struck the soul amen and god was in the soul amen and the anointing sucker and she said she turned turned away from the washer and she looked up and she said satan she said for the louder two hours the last two hours she said you've been talking to me now she said i'm going to talk to you and she said in the name of jesus christ you get out of here amen i rebecca in the name of the lord jesus christ and i plead the blood of jesus against you amen amen and the atmosphere changed and everything got bright again amen that's that's god with us god in us amen and again let me just remind you of this concerning that that pentecostal couple that went into fellowship with sister burns amen and and they had this child there this young girl and and they said oh sister burns uh oh we got a problem with her and because she was swearing and she would curse and then they were trying to get her to stop stop stop no she'd go on and do it and and my sister said well i pray for you know and the grace of god and so sister barn was was in in the lit their pantry and she was getting the food ready getting food ready when all of a sudden she heard the child starting to scream and swear and curse and she she laid down the instruments she had in her hand and what she was doing and she turned and she walked out into the kitchen she walked toward the hallway that would lead to the living room and she met the child in the doorway and the trial was swearing and she said satan in the name of jesus christ come out of this child i rebuke you amen and the child was startled and something happened amen she was delivered and it was almost two years later that that family came back again and went in to report to sister burns she said oh my she said i want you to know she said this this daughter hasn't sworn since never she did she hasn't used any of those words since she said i want to thank you amen for that prayer of deliverance amen god delivered her amen the devil was out that god was in amen all praise the lord yeah i wish mr barnes was still here and brother birds amen all right all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord verse 27 and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee for the kingdom is the lord's and he is the governor among the nations amen pray grace to these two governor in our lives all they that be fat upon the earth shall eat and worship your fat is not going to stop you from eating and all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive his own soul amen because we need god a seed shall serve him and it shall be accounted to the lord for a generation and they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this amen god has done it brother it's the finished work that we are experiencing is what he has done from the foundation of the world by the grace of almighty god amen and is it still working pardon audio okay brother matthew has informed me that he got problems with the but we can't get it on the uh the screen here probably the machines back there so we're going to listen to the audio and it'll be about 45 minutes i think around there not not it's not this the the him the sermon rather is not long just a few pages so we and we're going to start after he uh after he read the scripture on on psalms 22 so the lord bless us amen and god bless the word in us amen for the glory of god amen lord bless you praise the lord just from a quotation of the word year to come on my mind i would like to read a very familiar scripture known to the i would say the least of the little kindergarten school john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish have everlasting life and then in the 22nd psalm and the 11th verse i would like to read this be not far from me for our trouble is near and there is none to help and i'd like to take for a text tonight five words and just dwell with them a few moments one of them is living and dying is the second one buried is the third one rising is the fourth one coming is the fifth one living dying buried rising coming that's enough to keep me here until in the morning but and then not nothing like justify the texts but we'll just speak on each one for a few moments i think that these words that david wrote here when he wrote this 22nd psalm begins with the crying of christ at calvary my god my god why has thou forsaken me the reason i chose this easter has just passed and the people are still feeling the impact of that great of day of when god proved that jesus was his son by raising him up on the third day according to the scriptures and in living he was loved the poet expressed that jesus was his son by raising him up on the third day according to the scriptures and in living he was loved the poet expressed it when he said living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day and when he lived he loved because he was god and god is love and there could never be anyone who could love like jesus loved from the very first time his little baby hand stroked those pretty cheeks of his beautiful mother he was loved from that tully forgive his last enemy on the cross he was god's expression of love no one could love like jesus god being manifested in a little tiny baby come in order to take away the sins of the world and when you just speak the word jesus says something about it means love that's what the world needs more today is not a a jesus of some past tense some jesus of some high ethics but a jesus of love that can be expressed in the church of the lord jesus especially as his members one to another ought to always greet one another in love and traveling i think if there's any great thing that i've seen missing in the church today to one of the greatest hindrance in the church today to keep a revival back is the lack of that godly love that christ expressed when he was here on earth it's easy for you and i to love somebody that loves us but jesus didn't have that kind of love he had god's love and god loved his enemies for god so loved the world when the world was unlovable god still loved the world it's a different even in the expression in the the words the the ophelia love like we have one for another but the gopal love is a divine love and if there's anything that i believe that would start a revival in los angeles would be a time that we could all break down our different barriers and come together as christians and love that's the pentecostals the baptists and the presbyterians and all together we could be expressed to the world that we have loved one for another jesus prayed that prayer that we might love one another as he loved us as he loved us and he loved us so much that he died for us no one could love like that unless they with the natural um love because it would not hold out it won't express itself it'll do as long as there's friendship connected with it but when the friendships turn then the people begin to say well he did so and so she did so and so they backslid that real godly love goes after that backslider until it finds him godly love goes and stoops to the lowest of hell to pick up a man or a woman that's fallen that's what we're lacking today we have a fine cultured church educated fine dressed fine buildings nice choirs beautiful music some of the best the world's ever had but we are dying for some of that godly love jesus expressed it well when he found the prostitute drug before him guilty of an adultery and they drug her before him and said now the law requires for her to die what do you say do about it i tell you he showed himself what he was when he turned with these words neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more what more love could be than to take a wayward person like that and see who he was and freely forgive the woman of her wrong he expressed it again greatly when he was dying at calvary in his last words at the cross and this enemy spit hanging on his face he cried father forgive them for they know not what they do no one could love like him you can't manufacture that kind of a love it's a the gift of god that comes by the holy spirit the only way you'll ever be able to have that love though i speak with tongues of man and angels and have not that kind of a love i am nothing though i have faith to move mountains the bible said i was speaking here a few days ago upon the scripture straight is a gate and narrow is away and but few there'll be that find it and a young man who was riding with me in a car said how many would you say would be saved in this generation i said eight or ten oh he said don't say that brother i'll say i'll lengthen the 50 and that's as many as i can go he said 50 people i said jesus said when he was on earth as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man days of noah there was eight souls saved i remember a generation fades out each day ends that generation take 50 a day for six thousand years and see what you've gone and he said well then brother branham i'd like to ask you this question all the people that's claimed to have the holy spirit and so forth won't they come in the resurrection i said if they had the holy spirit but what we've been putting too much emphasis on is on other things instead of on the real thing the love of god paul said all these things could happen i could have all wisdom all knowledge and yet have not love it profit me nothing i could speak with tongues like man and angels and still not have it and we put so much emphasis upon these things upon great healing revivals and miracles being worked did not jesus say many will come to me in that day and say lord lord have not outcast our devils in your name in your name have i not done many mighty works i will say unto them depart from me you workers of iniquity i did not even know you what a disappointment that will be look what a surprise it'll be when he said those who didn't even think they deserved to be there when were you hungry and we fed you when were you naked and we gave you clothes we didn't know when you did this he said in so much as you've done it unto these you've done it unto me oh how the world needs something today i'll give you a little expression to clear that up in ezekiel the ninth chapter i believe it is when the holy spirit was sent forth to seal the people that would go in that day he said go through the city and put a mark upon the forehead of those that sign cry for the abominations that's dead in the midst of the city then to the slaughtering angels go after them and utterly destroy everything that doesn't have this seal now you take it in your own mind and go through los angeles tonight and you mark in the name of the lord jesus every person that's so concerned about the sins of the city until they cry and sigh day and night for the abominations done bring the eight here tomorrow night all right you see where we go we let other things come in to take up the place of the real thing it's love we're leaving out living he loved me he died for me when i was a sinner when i was unlovable he loved me anyhow my prayer is for the church that we can have such love till we love people whether they love us or not that's what the church needs today is to express a love even to a man that can spit in your face and you could still with not from a hypocritical standpoint but from your heart pray for that man's soul that's the kind of a revival we need here in los angeles but that kind of love manifested living he loved me dying he saved me most wonderful life that was ever lived on earth had to die when he was yet in his youth for god had spoken his his judgments had had to have just this for it is written the day you eat thereof that day you die god's justice required death and there was no one of us could die for one another no man could do that he was the only man could die that kind of a death for we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies we were guilty from the beginning so how could a good man die for another man when he was guilty himself there could not be any of us take that kind of a position so it had to take his death and god came down and was manifested in the flesh in order to die of death god could not die in spirit because god is eternal and spirit doesn't die but he was god and he had to unfold himself and come from glory to a manger and take on the form of sinful flesh in order to die to secure his church or to redeem his church to reconcile him back to himself oh brother sister there's nobody could explain that what god did when he died for us his flesh was put to death in the scriptures the old testament at the sin offering when they got two goats and these goats and jesus represented both of them or they represented him rather and one goat was killed and the other was the sins of the nation was placed upon this goat called the scapegoat and that goat had to go out into the wilderness to die and to be out there alone amongst the beasts and so forth jesus had to be that that goat i want you to notice he was a lamb he was sheep but he was made goat for you now that we being goat might become sheep [Music] we being sinners guilty of death subject to death and all sold out under condemnation yet christ become me that i through his grace might become him a son of god seated at the right hand of god in glory the love that he had how he expressed it how he had to make himself what he was to die to save us in his death when he died at calvary there was never a death could be like that death we are told that when the roman soldier pierced his side there was water and blood came out of his side and i've asked the chemist one time what taken place for that and this fellow being a christian said to me that was not jesus did not die because that the spirit touched his side or pierced his side said jesus had been dead a long time before that but he died from grief the sword never killed him or neither did this the driving of the nails but it was great that killed him when he looked out upon the ones that he had loved and the ones that he had worked his miracles on and the ones that he had expressed his love towards and it fed and see that they turned him down you and i might be grieved we might grieve but we can never grieve like that because we're not made up of that kind of material that we could have that much grief for the fullness of god dwelt in him in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily god was expressing his love through human flesh the tabernacle in which he lived in his own son what he thought about the world there he hung there on calvary's cross not as you see him on the crucifix with the little rag wrapped around his lawns they stripped him naked they embarrassed him everything that they could embarrass him to and hung in their own calvary and he was disgraced and despised and rejected and spit on his very own dying the god of eternity the one that made the cross he was hanging on no wonder the rocks ran out of the mountains the rocks come out because the rock of ages was being erected no one of the poets said mid-rendering rocks and darkening skies my savior bowed his head and died the opening they'll reveal the way to heaven's joys and endless day what did it do when he died there like that it opened the veil it let us look past the curtain of time let us seen a a hope there i see him bruised and and mashed and spit and arms and nails drove through him what did he do it opened the way that me a guilty sinner i know that he paid the price there i'm not justified by anything i could do none of my goodness i have none neither do you but it's through his sacrifices to his death we are justified by believing on him there's where our justice stands not what i do or what you do but what he did for us that ain't the gospel story i don't know it oh give me that and take all the rest of it away see that one who died for me how could i be just i i cannot justify myself i'm a sinner but when i look up on him and come singing nothing in my arms i bring simply to thy cross i clean there's where i'm justified by my faith believing that he died in my stead and took my place at calvary that's alone where i stand on the platform one demon powers are around and i see death hanging on the people and the devils got them bound and possessed and some of them straight jackets and and guards around them what do i stand on there and look to calvary lord there jesus christ paid the price i feel religious there he did it that person's got a right to be free satan don't hold them no longer if you can get them to see not their aches and their pains or some preacher praying farmer some holy church that's all right that goes with it but the main thing you see what christ did for you you're free christ died for you amen that's the gospel been rendering rocks and darkening skies my savior about his head and eye the opening veil revealed the way the heaven's joy and illness day there's where he died living he loved me dying he saved me how could i be saved get rid of sin he was a sin offering for me so he died now if sin is dead then buried he carried my sins far away he was a scapegoat that went out and the scapegoat took the sins of the people on him and went out into the wilderness to be to die grew out there and took the sins of the people and took them far away so did jesus he was he took the sins of the people and carried them far away so far that he put him in the sea of god's forgetfulness if sin is dead buried that's why we have baptisteries when people believe that story they come confessing their sins that they're tired of it they've divorced it they've separated from it and they're tired of it so it's dead and sin has more power upon that believer because he stands justified in the death and burial of jesus christ therefore he walks to the altar makes his confession says i'm sick and tired of sin i don't want it no more then we bury it when sin is buried anything is buried it's dead first then it's buried it's put away from sight that's why we bury people put them away from the side the contamination of their bodies hide them from us it's a gloomy thing to see what death does and when sin is finished when sin lost its grips and it died in the death of christ at calvary where he condemned sin then the sinner who accepts that justified by faith can scream hallelujah for god's carried my sins far away he put him up on my sin barrier jesus christ he represented both the animals both dying and taking the sins away then as i said a few moments ago he become we become we were goats he become goat for us being he becomes sin for us that's the reason he had to be punished the way he was because all of our sins were placed upon him and there he had to bear them away in his own body to calvary or reproach a disgrace sinfully hanging there naked strip bleeding bleeding when he rolled his precious head around the bloody locks dripping from his shoulders i believe it was billy's sunday said there was an angel sitting in every tree saying just pull your hands loose on the cross and just motion your finger will change the scene the jews paid him the greatest compliment could be paid not knowing what they were doing they said he saved others himself he can't save sure not if he saved himself he could not save others but he gave himself that we might be saved that's the story living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away they're done they're finished god sealed forgiveness to be remembered against him so more oh can't we shout hallelujah to that sure it's all over christ did it oh my sure we can now here comes the greatest of all rising he justified all these great things he done was wonderful they're superb there's nothing to be added to it but yet a man could die yet a man could suffer yet a man could love but when he rose god wrote the receipt in his resurrection that he had received it god's justice had been met oh thanks be to god rising he justified god proved by the resurrection that he wasn't frowning he wasn't fake that was his son and he raised him up the spirit the eternal spirit jehovah god the father of our lord jesus christ who raised up that dead farm in the grave there had been dead for three days and buried and god raised him up on easter morning to justify there when we come brother coming to god there's not one thing he that cometh but come boldly to the throne of grace you mustn't come wandering when you come into the prayer line you mustn't come wondering well if this minister will pray for me perhaps maybe he's got healing power brother sister healing power is in god saying cross in the finished work of calvary when you come come to be justified you are justified when you confess your faith that by skype i was healed i'm going to make a stand the doctor says i'm dying i got tumor i got tb whatever it is but tonight i stand because i believe that he loved me and died for me and saved me and buried my sins far away and god justified us by believing on him when he raised him up from the dead he accepted everything that he died for he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chasm of our peace upon a man with his stripes we were healed and he raised him up and wrote the receipt that was god's receipt when the earth began to quiver and shake and the sun began to dark light the earth on that easter morning heaven shall hell shall power i shook the earth shut something has taken place i can hear the angels and glory screaming hallelujah i can hear him in paradise the old saints of the old testament crying out glory to his name certainly something that happened up from the grave he arose he brought out the triumph over the grave death hell sickness every barrier everything that stands in the way of perfect freedom for the christian everything that you have need of was taken care of it was been suffered far done been accepted done bled far done died done rose and god justified him he justifies you to believe it up from the grave he arose prove that he was god buddha made some great statements buddha died in the grave 2 300 years ago still there muhammad made a lot of great statements but he died and he's in the grave and been there for about nearly 1900 years he's in the grave no speaking afterwards they might have been great man confucius a great chinese philosopher many of those great man poets and authors and gods of want more they might have been great in their stand but when god raised up his son on easter morning it proved it and he sent the holy ghost and we've got the receipt of it now but i can hear him scream from eternity because i live ye live also amen that's right because i live you live also amen for he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed you don't have to die before your time comes because he lives you live also that shall smother out my breath i'll still be living he that heareth my words and believeth on him and send me has everlasting life and shall never come to the judgment but pass from death into life i am the resurrection life saith god he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die i anchor my soul right there no wonder the poet wrote on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection share when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky when the rose called up yonder i'll be there why living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day i can see my shoulders stooping my arms where they used to be muscles were getting fattened uh oh i can see i'm i'm dying i don't know how long it'll be before he'll call me but i've got eternal life in here because he died for me that he might redeem this that i have offered to him some glorious day he's coming i believe it with all my heart i'll stay at the battlefield by his grace i'll preach pray for the sick until death shall set me free and then go home a crown to where for he paid for it gave it freely god justified my belief when he raised up jesus then i have a crown waiting 40 days after he had visited his disciples he's standing out on the mountain is what holds us on the earth when we're on the earth here it's gravitation hoses but you know what god took an ocean for him to come up a little higher gravitation began to lose his hope god i hope that i could be that way some of these days don't you on this old earth bound condition sometimes i've been in meetings i thought it was going to take place at any time just feel it breaking loose around you one of these days it'll do it no matter they can put you in a grave and put a tombstone on top of you and seal you up that won't have one thing to do with it the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ your eyes some days coming oh glorious days yes he's coming gravitation began to lose his hold his feet begin to rise earth began to peep through beyond that i will come again he said and receive unto myself that where i am there you may be also i'm so glad that i can sing that song with a true heart tonight living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever sunday's coming o glorious day brings me to this little thought i don't know whatever said it to hold its little story i read out of a book one time about a man here in america his name is greenfield it's been dead now about 75 years i guess he died oh i guess maybe longer than that but before he died he dreamed a dream that he went to glory when he got up there he went to the gate he said to the saint i am danny greenfield he said i'm an evangelist i've come to take my position he said just a moment sir your name has to be on the book here he looked over the book and he said there's no greenfield daniel greenfield here he said oh you must be wrong sir said i was an evangelist in america nope it's not here so what can i do said if you wish to you might appeal your case to the great white throne judgment so he said that's all i have left so he said it seemed like he was passing through the air for a while began to get lighter and lighter after a while as it got lighter he got slower until he stopped he couldn't see just where the light was coming from but it's all around him and said he heard a voice that said who is this that approaches my throne of justice he said i'm daniel greenfield said i was up at the heaven gates and the gatekeeper turned me away and said i had to stand before your judgment now i appeal my case to stand here sir he said all right i'll judge you about my justice then he said my justice requires perfection he said did you ever lie when he was on earth he said i thought i'd been an honest man and had been truthful but said in the presence of that light i've seen a lot of times i told things that wasn't right look friend we may go to church every sunday we may be very religious oh sure you might pay your tithes and you might just be as good a person as los angeles as god that may be true but i'll tell you there's a lot of things going to stand before you if that's all you got when you stand at that white throne judgment no wonder if you there will be a be saved and he said i thought i told the truth but said i seen a lot of things that told wasn't just right he said yes i told eyes he said then did you ever steal he thought there's one i can answer but said in the presence of that light he saw many a little shady deal he never thought of it in natural life see we're just on the negative side we're looking with shaded eyes but when we stand there in his presence the glasses are going to be pulled off we'll see face to face with him man that's when it's going to be terrible and he said yes i i i guess i did steal he said daniel greenfield my justice requires perfection was you perfect when we used your life he said no lord i wasn't perfect said he's waiting to hear that great blessing depart from me you work of iniquity said he heard a voice is the sweetest voice he ever heard in his life and he turned to look he said he saw the sweetest face that he ever saw said no mother couldn't look or talk like that said as he walked up close to him he put his hand up on his shoulder and he said to him father that is true danny greenfield in his earthly journey he wasn't perfect but there's one thing he did when he was in earth he stood for me now while you're in heaven i'll stand for him all of his sins put it up on my account and he had paid for it at calvary brother sister that's the one i'm going to depend on i'm not going to depend on whether i'm a methodist or a baptist or a pentecostal i'm not going to depend on whether i shot it whether i spoke with tongues whether i prayed the prayer of faith for the sick i'm not going to depend on that i'm going to depend on my faith yonder or he loved me and died and saved me and rising he justified i'll stand for him upon the basis of that while i'm here on earth that great judgment morning i believe you'll stand for me at that day who would stand for you that day could your pastor could your church think of it while we bow our heads just a moment dear god that is a solemn question that we must answer just now who would stand for us would it be the our friends though they might be ever so loyal and would try as hard as they could to stand for us it might be our beloved pastor who we love with all of our hearts and he would stand and scream for us yet he has to scream for mercy too oh there is could be no one stand that day but jesus dear god i've just tried to speak of a love that you gave to your church it seems like that they've caught up with the miracles of the bible they've caught up with the the membership and the evangelism and the missionaries and but lord let them catch up with love now that'll set the church of fire with the real agopal love with a real sacred love that could turn the cheek or the one that would be willing to lay down his life if it would mean to save others god give us that love in our hearts as we wait on thee while we have our heads bowed i wonder tonight how many in this big audience of people tonight would just like to stand up to your feet and say i'm going to stand right now for jesus and by doing this lord i want you to stand for me on that day because this may be the last chance that i get to ever stand for you i've been in many meetings i'm a member of a church maybe you are maybe you're not whatever the case is would you just say lord i'll stand right now and please stand for me on that day stand up to your feet right now while we offer prayer just raise up that's right god bless you that's just fine all right living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever some days coming oh glorious day the chaplain sitting out here tonight there's a great meeting of science the other day you all seen the i believe it's a look magazine this month how that general said that this next war will just only be a few minutes right now it just takes one of them to blow their top and some of these excuse that expression but some of these arguments are having just set off one bomb there we are out there in the ocean with these submarines to rise up there they are different places to send those bombs here they come this way here they come that way the world can't stand it she could go in there before that clock strikes another two minutes this entire thing could be over don't you take a chance if you're not sure you're right i wonder if our sister would give us a card on this you believe that god would hear my prayer for you come here let me uh out of them lights out there walk down here just a minute will you come right here let's stand here and pray together come right on now if you will don't sit down just move right up here and stand here say i've been a church member i'm not ashamed i'll come right up here and stand here i want to come i want to be honest where you'll see a revival start if you can just see the spirit of god get into the people god bless you if you hear my prayer to open the eyes of the blind no doubt you'll see that done these next few days make the poison of a snake bite through prayer just stop it dead still i've seen those who had passed beyond more life the doctors had closed their eyes and folded their hands and walked away same rise back to life again what through prayer prayer means something we'll wait for you in the balconies come right on down let's stand here and have a prayer together would you come right down let's let's pray together that's what we want to do how many like to have that love if you haven't got a love in your heart tonight that you sign cry for the abominations this did in this city listen friends i'll ask take any student here to to to discuss that the scripture said that the angel of god could only seal those who weeped and cried for the abomination did in the city all it has read that say amen there it is just those who sigh cry for the abomination of the city or you say i've been a pentecostal a long time that's good so have i but brother what about that spirit of concern about the lost world if you're about the father's business you say well i i get a blessing every night and if that good humble sweet meek spirit is on you what is the fruits of the spirit love peace joy long suffering goodness gentleness patience don't take no chance in the morning maybe too late an hour from now maybe too late why don't you come now before there's any healing service before there's anything come right down say lord i want to get right i want a spirit in me that'll make me love i want a spirit in me that will make me appreciate what jesus did for me and so much that my heart will be tender and loving and i can forgive the people from my heart not because it's a duty now there's somebody in a balcony should be coming down walk out that you might just be that many steps between you and heaven i don't say it is i hope it isn't but it might be just that much is all you need what would you give tonight if jesus if you'd hear something take place and a rock would go off down here somewhere one back here and the radios would be screaming people running into the streets and the atomic bombs are falling it's too late then you know what would happen the church would the gravitational take leave his hope loose that church should be raptured just as certain as i'm saying this pulpit the graves that opened the dead would come out they'd go to meet the lord jesus church members by the tens of thousands yes by the tens of millions will be left behind better come be sure that you've got love in your heart while we bow our heads just a moment while we're waiting as others are coming down let the personal workers get around now also and you are coming around to pray with us come on sinner friend come on backslider come on lukewarm church member let's let's go to heaven together will you come right here now for this prayer i want to pray for you i want to be sure that i've done everything that i can do because i'm believing that this week is going to be a is going to be in this coming week is going to be a great time around this temple if jesus tarries and i'd like to see every sin cleaned up like to see all the old gloomy devils tuck away and the church of the living god could stand on their feet with real divine love there be a shaking to this city likes never been known before lame blind halt everything would take place are you finished you're sure now this this is you're sure that your sins are so under the blood thank god for the word but it wasn't the message that i was reading amen brother brown did preach on it living dying buried rising coming he preached on it uh in jeffersonville and uh well actually there was a series that he that he ministered on and then i think it was just a few days later it was after easter had faded gone past that he ministered in another place and that's the one that our brother was playing and i didn't have that one printed but this one here and again this is a series that was printed quite some time ago long time ago and it's uh five five messages living dying buried rising coming amen march 59 and the other another one was on water baptism and again he was highlighting the spiritual meaning of water of baptism why what does baptism represent and he wanted to highlight those things his death burial resurrection amen and the sign of the messiah and again the other one was i know and then the finally preached on go tell amen so uh maybe on another night that we'll we'll pray the one that he actually preached in jeffersonville because in this one he does highlight easter it was it was during the time of easter that he preached it and he highlights easter and living dying buried rising coming this is what jesus did this is what easter represents means to you and me by the grace of almighty god and he said and he said it was god's receipt that was rising and he said that the bill had been paid and he said he justified freely forever and he said oh what a savior rising what had god done a man can suffer a man can die a man can be buried but easter was the greatest of them all for he said it was god's endorsement my law has been sent met and my requirement has been met by him he rose him from the dead rising he justified freely forever blessed be his holy name amen and he said remember he said today we celebrate just not a time to wear new hats and wear new clothes which is all right it's a symbol or something new but god did something new and he said which is all right is not only that but easter doesn't mean that he said a bunny easter rabbits or bunny eggs and little white chickens and so forth that isn't the idea brother he said easter is a triumph easter is the victory he says that god give over the earth and that he raised his own son from the dead and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life amen and nearing the end of this message he he said again he talked about the bombs that they're saying that russia is going to sin over america and destroy america well there's spiritual bombs of the devil that it that that he's going to be used and he said listen he said you promised to come lord he said get your people and it'll be that way lord so most any minute there could be a resurrection there could be an easter for the church a resurrection from this sinful life onto the life eternal through christ here oh lord our prayer amen and there's other things i could highlight but we will leave that and maybe get you to hear it's another time and uh this message is very very short it might be 50 minutes that's the entire message but i was highlighting just for his beginning to preach it and just when he prayed to end it so maybe we'll touch on some other time so and if you want to of course you can go and try to get it printed and i don't know many got this these booklets or not because they're that's a long time ago that i got this and that it was printed so you might be able to find it online and hear the prophet preach it by the grace of god amen but it's representing easter is representing amen and we're believing a lot more than what the world's believing amen we're believing in the life that was lived we're believing in the life that laid itself down for you and me amen or believe in the life that was buried by the grace of god but it rose again amen and with a promise on coming back again praise the name of the lord so and also we could highlight a sermon that the prophet of god preached concerning the crucifixion of the word amen that as they crucified him in his first coming they have crucified him and are crucified him in his second coming well they are the most definitely crucifying the word because whether it wasn't just the bible and the letter being preached it was the revelation of god it was the revelation of jesus it was the revelation of the bridegroom amen coming to receive his bride amen amen and brother i trust by the grace of god that we're witnessing not just a prophet but brother i trust for believing what the god through the prophet revealed amen how many of us are really really really into what was revealed and he said all that god has done was to give us he said rapturing faith amen she was not just to isolate william branham or i late oh god got this power god that got that power and unfortunately this is what most of the evangelistic world in the days of william branham this is what they were looking for they were looking for signs and wonders and they wanted brother brown to come and minister to them and and then would only minister they wanted mainly to sign they wanted him to do this and do that for the healing of the people but again we know that there was one one evangelist out there the prophet did i like that that that brothers ministry as being of god for a reason but it was that brother it was that evangelist that called the prophet aside and told him he said don't preach those things brother branham he said come and do this and you can expound this and expound that but don't preach he said again for the people against doing this doing this doing that no no he didn't want william brown to preach that but he wasn't going to and brother brahma said to him he's a well-known evangelist he's going on now himself and uh known around the world and brother brown said brother he said if i don't do it who's gonna do it he said i gotta preach it because he said they're not they're not preachers out there amen so that that was the end of their association with william branham amen because there was a number of angels wanted him because of the signs and the wonders and it was attracting the people but see the bride's not coming for signs and wonders the bride is coming for the word amen to give her the faith that she needs in this hour whereas all they were looking for was signs and wonders healing healing healing god doing this god doing that but brother brother what about the resurrection and the rapture that's going to get us out of here where we won't need healing no no we're getting good into eternity we won't need someone to go and pray oh i i need someone to pray for me because i'm sick no no there'll be no sickness we're going to get out of this dimension into the eternal dimension amen where all these things are gone amen but again they they are focusing and not so many now because it's all gone now the revival's gone the spirit of revival's gone and brother the spirit of god is narrowed down narrowed down narrow down to the to the bright to get her out of here to get her rapturing faith resurrection faith and again the prophet prophet said he said my he said there won't be many and he did highlight us a couple of numbers and brother we consider that there might be 2 million people believing this message around the world two million and the private guy just said i said those living ones that'll go in the rapture he said there's only be a few only i can't remember the number used now there's a couple of numbers he was he was indicating so brother about what it should what should it do to us it probably ought to put us on our guard oh yes most definitely that we that we will walk to please god that we'll believe the word to please god that we're there to love the lord he loved us in doing what he did now brother let's love him amen for his word for his redemption let's love him for what he's doing to get us out of time and into eternity by the grace of god god help us that we're going to focus on jesus our lord jesus christ focus on god to focus on redemption but it's not just religion all this good look what he did jesus did this jesus did that yeah but let's let's become personal with jesus that jesus sort of that amen we identify with what he did are we identifying with what he's doing oh yeah you can oh the bible says that they want to want to identify with his death death and burial and so on but how many identify with his resurrection by the grace of god and believing that we as the bridegroom was resurrected the bride is resurrected he has come back amen to put resurrection and rapture in the bride by the word god help us do god be the glory amen so brother god help us to be spiritual and again not religious but spiritual the world's religious out there but i pray grace that we're going to be spiritual amen filled with the holy ghost it is the life of the word in you it is the life of the word in me what doing what is making the word flesh in you and me the word flesh yeah he did that through luther wesley pentecost what's he doing for the bride what's he making flesh in you and me the resurrection the rapture amen i'm not dead i'm alive forever and war in our lord jesus christ amen god bless you amen this thing i love him and we'll turn to our brother bob amen and again god bless us all and keep us all in prayer amen and pray again for god's leadership concerning sunday service whether brother journal will come back here or whether we might get our brother johnson again we'll see we'll keep our brother we want we want one little boy amen so the grace of god so that could be just be in prayer and follow the leadership of the holy ghost god bless you and god bless our sister amen amen god bless brother columbus and we trust well there was a plan that last time i spoke with the brother that he was planning on bringing that brother moses i believe he was thinking looking at brother moses in this i thought this weekend but again i the rules and regulations prevent that yeah so god bless our brother moses amen we praying the god of moses be with us amen the lord bless us let's stand and
