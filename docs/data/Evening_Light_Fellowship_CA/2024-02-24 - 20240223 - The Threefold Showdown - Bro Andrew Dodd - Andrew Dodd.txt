God bless you want to welcome each one here tonight and you always I was thinking just as we were singing this that we've got some people that are sick and at home and I reminded of the story that brother codre Diggs told of a woman that was listening to him preached some meetings and she was in Jamaica I think nowhere near Trinidad and Tobago maybe and he was up preaching somewhere in the United States and she was streaming and she had a life-threatening disease that they were giving her medication for and while he was preaching the spirit of God reached into her home and she got a revelation that she was healed and she flushed those things down the toilet all those medications and then she went and told her husband and he said you're crazy you'll be dead tomorrow and she never needed those medications again amen God's not bound by a building he's not bound by our presence amen we sing that song he came to me when I couldn't go to him he came to me and so there may be those that need him tonight and they couldn't be here but we're just trusting his grace his presence his Spirit to go out and touch them each one amen amen I'm looking forward to this we're certainly glad to have brother Andrew DOD here and he may look young but he's been preaching longer than I have he came to the ministry at the age of 17 he's been doing that for quite some time he's of course helping brother Ed hammermeister in Edmonton but we're glad to have him here amen God bless you for coming all his way and we're glad to have brother Nelson guy with us unless those online think the resurrection has happened no it hasn't happened amen but it's Nelson guy Jr but you know God is the great Shepherd but then he sends a pastor to Shepherd well we have a great guide but then he sends us a guide to get our moose and that's brother Nelson guy so God bless you the Moose we eat we believe that he does it of his own free will we get a professional Hunter to to take us around and and help us find those animals and he's helped many many people many Believers over the years so we benefit greatly from that and he's here this weekend to get surgery on his knees and even the last time he took me out his knees were bugging him and we did over 10 kmers that day walking and he did it on bad knees for us because he had a heart to serve so I say God bless you brother Nelson and we're happy to have you here amen trusting that it'll be a blessing amen let's sing that song as we turn to the word bring all your needs to the altar I've told Brother Andrew there's no clocks here the deacons have taking care of the clocks take his time preach what the Lord lays on his heart I said I was excited to hear him preach because I've heard him preach and he's got a wide range he works with the young people he preaches regularly in the services there he's he's gone around the world evangelizing and doing missions work so I don't know which gift is coming out tonight but I'm excited to see what the Lord has for us amen so you pull on that gift you say Lord you know my need he knows your need even if you don't know your need amen and if we'll just open ourselves to the word then the Holy Spirit can take control and do things in our lives that we never could have imagined amen amen let's sing it bring all your needs to the altar bring all your needs to the Lord he is so willing and able to help you so bring all your needs to the Lord bring all your needs to [Music] the all your to [Music] the so and a to you so bring all your needs to the Lord hallelujah amen has the Lord been good to you of course he has you're here you're living in the light of the hour that's good we thank the Lord for all he's done for us and how he's brought us through many trials some of us more than others just due to age but in all of it we've made it through amen we're happy to be here in your in your presence as brother Jonathan so apply so kindly said how how how uh much he's looking forward to hearing me preach I consider it a great honor to stand here before you you're the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ brother Randon would talk about if I had one vial of the blood of Christ how I would treat it right how I would hold it so dear to my heart and we would if we could have one vial of the blood of Christ that would be the blood of our savior what that would mean to us but more than that he gave that willingly with joy for you to purchase your salvation your healing your peace amen it's all he took it all upon himself to say I I overcame the world so you too can overcome amen amen thank you musicians that's all the singing will do tonight or at least until I'm done preaching amen and and I I I'm just brother Andrew do I'm a little bit nervous I don't know why but I guess that's the way it is when you're a first time preaching somewhere but I bring you greetings from the Saints at Edmonton I bring you greetings from Brother Ed hammermeister whom you know and uh he wanted to be sure to greet you all in the name of the Lord and brother Alan Dole who's been here in the midst of you he said please give my greetings to the Saints there and brother each one of you and of course brother Dale Uncle Dale it's good to see you amen I I was looking forward to seeing you again God bless you amen I appreciate the prayers tonight and I know there's been many more than just tonight and amen let's take our Bibles together I'm not going to take long and preliminaries get right to Isaiah chapter 55 yes I've been preaching since I'm 17 and I'm now 32 and uh but in all of that I still rely on the anointing of the Holy Spirit without it I sure fail miserably and I'm so thankful when he comes by our way and as I say the Saints back home if you pull I'll preach and we'll let the Lord do the leading so as long as you poll will preach and we'll just go on as long as the Lord would have us I I try not to be long longwinded but uh I am also not a short person so we'll just take it as the Lord gives it amen amen we'll turn to Isaiah chapter 55 if I haven't said that already Isaiah 55 we'll start at verse 6 as I was fellowshipping this this afternoon with Brother John he quoted this scripture to me and didn't know it was my opening scripture tonight but uh the Lord knows what he's doing and I so appreciated his fellowship and his Hospitality God bless you you and I I love seeing a pastor with a vision that has a vision for the church here and God's blessed you amen amen Isaiah CH 55 and verse 6 says seek ye the Lord while he may be found amen call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts let him turn unto the Lord and He will will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon amen that right there outlines the sovereignty of God doesn't matter he's wicked he's unrighteous he's someone that we would look at and say they're hopeless but let them turn from their ways let them turn to God God will abundantly pardon amen the blood of Jesus is more powerful than we could imagine amen if we carry on in the scripture where it says and my my thoughts are not your thoughts the Lord's thoughts in other words are not your thoughts neither are there your neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and in this country we know all about that amen especially the last couple weeks but it says as the rain of and the snow cometh down from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth the bud that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I send it for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace and mountains the and and and mountains the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands and instead of a thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Brier shall come up a myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name and for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen let's just bow our heads together before we're seated Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we've read your your word Lord you said heavens and earth will pass away and but your word will never fail it'll never pass Lord not one J or one tit Lord until it be fulfilled father we thank you Lord Jesus that we can have a Blessed Assurance Lord that we know there's a foundation there's an absolute oh God that will come to pass that has been coming to pass that we're living in right now we don't want to just look back and see what you have done though we're very thankful for it Lord we don't want to just look ahead and see what you're doing though father we do look forward to it but Lord we want to live in the here and now we want to be a part Lord God of what you're doing in our day and in this generation Lord we want to know Lord that we're on the Forefront of the battlefield Lord that when God calls on somebody we're there to answer Lord as your your servant Isaiah said here am I Lord send me Father may you just come in a very Sovereign way tonight Lord you know what you've laid on my heart but Lord I pray youd take it and just meet the needs of the people Lord we commit it all into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen may the Lord is Blessing to the reading of the word you may have the comfort of your seats amen amen I want to just start here tonight and and and maybe as I was telling brother John I I Lord willing would preach a three-part Series this weekend if that's all right and and just begin to build one upon the other upon the other so I trust that you'll just bear with me a little bit I I we were talking this afternoon on on different gifts and the fivefold ministry and you know the teachers do this way and the Evangelist do that way well as he said I'm not sure what gift will come out we'll just trust the Lord and I believe as the Lord needs to speak to you he will speak to you in that way amen he's Sovereign in all that he does he's God he's able to do whatever he wants and I really want to speak starting tonight on The three-fold Showdown The three-fold Showdown as brother Ram would take in the paman church age I trust it's okay if I quote quotes to you and scriptures and just begin to read it that way and and allow the inspiration to strike but he would say in the paman church age actually it's in the section called pick up your pen and write which brother branam would receive that directly from the Lord as he would begin to write down as God would speak to him he and he'd write it this way he said then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel Showdown so watch this carefully now and see it in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 amen we believe that melachi 3 spoke of John and then it would talk about he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day and Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will sew for the latter Rain Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second Showdown was Mount Transfiguration and the third Showdown will be Mount Zion amen and I want to just focus in tonight on Mount Carmel if we could and just begin to look into that and of course we'll turn into First Kings chapter 18 but we'll get to that as as we begin to look at these thoughts in Isaiah 55 is God would begin to express something through the prophet of Isaiah and Isaiah was a phenomenal Prophet it was him that gave us the prophecy of behold a virgin shall conceive and um and he'll be uh Emanuel God With Us and uh begin to give us much more prophecy than that is but as we begin to look into it he begin to speak really and give us insight into who God is and the way that God operates and he would be to say Seek Ye the Lord while he may be found in other words there is a time that he will not be found any longer there is a time where he will hide himself away but there is a time now this is the day of salvation this is a time to seek the Lord that he may be found of you and he says to call upon him why while he is near amen that's why we come to church that's why we pray that's why we listen to the message that's why we get ourselves aside to God so we could call on his name so he says draw nigh unto me them who draw nigh unto me I will draw nigh unto them amen and we desire that that's what worship is for and when you come in prayer when you come into the presence of God you do it in a way that you could draw nigh unto God and then begin to make your requests known as Jesus would even teach us to pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven how Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven he starts out the prayer very much lord it's about you it's about worship to you it's about bringing up an atmosphere where God can draw nigh unto you and I then he says we can make our requests known when he's near that's the time to call on his name and then he says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man turn from his thoughts amen it's in other words it's the righteous man is not righteous because of his doing but let the unrighteous man turn from his unrighteous thoughts let him turn from his thoughts and we're living in such an age where brother Brandon would would receive a revelation from the angel of the Lord that would come to him and say your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your words do on Earth your thoughts speak louder we have a connection into the eternals and into the heavenlies that we what what we think is louder before God than what I'm saying to you right now God is looking and his word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart in other words he it's not just that he he knows what you're thinking but rather he also knows what is a passing thought and he knows what is the intent of your heart he knows what you dwell on he knows who you really are God looks on the heart of man amen and God looks on those things and he knows when Satan throws an evil thought at you he knows what those thoughts are he understands that he knows that doesn't make you a non-Christian all of the sudden because Satan put a thought in your mind that you said where'd that come from I didn't mean to think that are you with me now am I the only one this happens to no all right we're we're together now Satan likes to throw thoughts at us that all of a sudden we go I don't want to think that and we we feel ashamed of it and we even repent of it but God is able to discern between those things and who you really are but now as as he begins to say if a man would turn from those ways I will hear but then he goes into his own thoughts which are the Eternal thoughts of God he says my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my ways are higher than your ways sayith the Lord but he doesn't just leave it there he says but as the rain comes down and the snow comes down from heaven and returneth not hither in other words he begins to lay out a principle he's saying my thoughts are higher my thoughts are ET returnal but I send them down to you for a purpose I send them down that they could bring forth that which I've sent them for in other words God doesn't ever just speak because the words that he speaks it says in the next verse my word will not return unto me void because the words of God are the thoughts of God expressed amen so when he sends his word out he's sending it out to perform what it was meant to do that it would bring forth that it would manifest in the beginning God spoke and he said let there be he said let there be let there be and there was it didn't just speak and then nothing happened it might have taken days it might have taken weeks months years decades Millennia uh Century all of these huge numbers it might have taken all kinds of years but it happened because when God speaks it must bring forth amen and we know that on the seventh day God rested and as he rested it brought forth and it manifested all of the seeds that had been sewn all the things that God had swed in the earth and the trees and the flowers and the plants it begin to bring forth and multiply amen as God as the logos brother Ron would teach us began to brood over the Earth amen and now if we could go over to Philippians chapter 4 if you could turn there with me quickly a familiar scripture I believe to us and as we as he would begin to speak about his word in other words his word in verse 13 it won't bring forth a thorn Satan plants the Thorns Jesus would give us the parable about sers that went forth to sew one was a good man that went forth and in the night time a man clothed in in dark rment came forth and clo and sowed bad seed and we're familiar with those with those things but but he says what my word will bring forth is not a thorn but a fur tree a solid tree and instead of a Brier it will bring forth a myrtle tree Myrtle trees are interesting because Myrtle trees bring forth beautiful flowers and they bring forth little be berries that actually what their berries are used for is to make a fragrant alcohol and I like that because that's what brother brandham says is a type of Revelation the stimulation of Revelation the wine that was given to the church it will bring forth Revelation when it comes to maturity my word will be a revelation to you Amen in its season in Philippians chapter 4 as we're talking about the thoughts of God I want to just go into this a little bit then we'll get into Mount Carmel Philippians chapter 4 as it says in verse 6 says be careful for nothing oh praise God we know that that scripture means worry for nothing worry won't get you anywhere amen it's been proven worry will stop stress will stop somebody from getting pregnant sister unable to conceive because of stress worry no one's ever been able to conceive seed that way there's many other things it will cause death it will cause all kinds of sicknesses all kinds of heartaches all kinds of attitudes and here Paul begins to just lay says don't worry for anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God Amen in other words doesn't mean we just live it frivolously no worry for nothing but be prayerful amen it says in the peace of God that passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue which is strength and if there be any praise think on these things amen my thoughts are higher than your thoughts but I let them come down as the rain comes down as the snow comes down to a place where you can begin to tap into or begin to think my thoughts because I desire to make them know and unto you Amen to bring forth that which I've purposed it to bring forth that's why it says whatsoever Things Are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just all of these things if there be any praise any virtue think on these things it's a good indication of what the thoughts of God are of where we're living at of what we're doing and and how how Satan is affecting us and how he's affecting our lives and how he's putting different thoughts in our minds if we begin to dwell on those things if we find ourselves it affects our attitude if we begin to dwell on the parliament of today and the current prime minister and everything that's going on it affects our attitude it affects the way we think about things and we start to get upset and we start to get why is this way and why is that way does even care about our country what's going on in the states what's happening in Israel what's going on over there we begin to worry and worry and worry and it doesn't bring anything strength but he says if there be any strength in it think on these things if there be of a good report put your mind to these things put these things in your mind and make them the center part of your thought Hallelujah let's go over to First Kings chapter 18 let's just take it this way here first Kings chapter 18 amen Lord willing tonight we're going to read the whole chapter but slowly says and it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord had come unto Elijah we know that before this Elijah had stomped his way into the the king's Palace and he he pronounced judgment on them because you've done all these things you're there won't be rain or due for three and a half years or until I call for it and all these things are going to happen and he stomped his way out and Ahab couldn't find him anywhere he searched for him and couldn't find him anywhere now it comes down to chapter 18 and it says go show thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the Earth and Ahab went to show himself un unto Ahab and there was a sore famine in Samaria and Ahab called Obadiah which was the governor of his house now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly and so it was when Jezebel had cut off the prophets of the Lord that Obadiah had took 100 prophets by 50 hid them in a cave gave them bread and water and Ahab said unto Obadiah go into the land unto all The Fountains of water and all the Brooks pre- Adventure we could find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts so they divided the lamb between them begin to pass through it in verse 7 and as Obadiah was in the way behold Elijah met him and he knew him and he fell on his face and said art thou that my Lord Elijah and he answered him and said I am go tell thy Lord behold Elijah is here I love that the fact that God told the prophet go appear go appear before Ahab with a good word and he came to the one that feared God he didn't go directly to the sinful King he went to found someone that feared God and he said and he answered unto him and said I am go tell thy Lord behold Elijah's here and he said what have I sinned that thou should us deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me as the Lord God liveth and there is no Nation or the kingdom whether the Lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and the nation and they found the not and now thou sayith go tell thy Lord behold Elijah's here and it came to pass as soon as I am gone out from Thee the spirit of the Lord will carry thee with thou will whether with the whether the Lord will carry thee whether I know not and so when I come to tell Ahab he cannot find thee he will slay me but I thy servant fear the lord from thy Youth and was it not told you what I did when I Jezebel slew the prophets verse 14 says and when thou sayest go tell the Lord behold Elijah is here and he shall slay me then Elijah said as the Lord of host liveth beh before whom I stand I will surely swow myself unto him today so Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah and it came to pass that when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel I want to just take this and maybe Point into a few things here as we look into this scripture I want to just look at it because we often read this as as history as something that's gone by and we read it in the scripture as it's recorded in the scripture but it wasn't then this was not they weren't reading off of a script Elijah wasn't reading in the Bible and Ahab reading this what should I say back no this was happening in real time this was a prophet for that day this was prophecy that was being unfolded right before their eyes that they were living and and Obadiah represented the Believers of the day and Ahab the wicked King that was there but now we find that as it begin to be unfolded Ahab had a hatred for the word for his day Ahab hated it so much he knew that the word of God said no rain will come neither will do come unless I call for it but still he begins to send out his servant and he begins to go up the other direction and say let's go find water cuz we need life we we need water we need grass we need something for our animals but I'm not going to Elijah anymore I've looked for him but he didn't look for him the right way he was constantly looking for him naturally instead of repenting had he just repented the word of God would have came back to him but because he refused to come to a place of repentance instead he said let's continue our natural way you know what the God has failed us the word has failed us let's go find our own water he come to a place where he hated hated it and and and and and but Elijah had come to such a place where maybe he had decided to have an acronym of ab anything but the message we'll find water in anything but the message because that was the message for his day was Elijah I go to anybody but Elijah and we'll find something there I want life I need life and I'll search for it anywhere but the message of the hour in Amos 8: 11 it would write behold the day comes sayeth the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine for bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord we know that that pertains to our day it even goes on to say and they would Wander from sea to Sea from North even to the east they would run to and fro seeking the word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst what an awful thing that someone would search to and far to and fro far and wide east to west north to south looking for the word of the Lord when it's right in front of them when they refuse to just even get on their knees and repent as he says call upon God while he is near unto you seek him while he can be found this is our day people searching everywhere to try and find spiritual sustenance there there has been and there's going on in the secular world there's been an Awakening in the searching for for oil because their lamps have gone out it has happened all around us there's people that are searching for the truth it's been on the news it's been different place where people are waking up and realizing what's going on in the world is horrible and they've been pulling their kids out of school to homeschool them because of what's going on in the schools and they've been trying to get away from the the political uh nonsense that has been going on and and the way it's just been directing and people have been waking up to some degree but they don't know where to go they've been looking for some kind because brother brandom says there's a thirst in each and every one of our hearts it's a thirst for God but man will try to fill it with everything else they'll try and fill it with anything but the message of the hour they'll try and fill it with everything but the word of God but we have the word of God we have it in our lives we have sustenance we have been feeding for years for years Church on the unfa failing body word of the son of man we've been feeding on what we call the hidden Mana we've been feeding on the message of the hour we've been feeding on the word there's a statement brother uh brother Charles Spurgeon would make where he says people will not read their Bible but they will read you they might not go to the word of God they might not understand where they got to go but they're watching you they're watching your life they're watching the way you live they're watching the way that you dress they're watching the way that you talk they're watching the way that you conduct yourself they're watching whether God is really real to you because this first Showdown as we look at this Mount Carmel Showdown a showdown is always to prove something God brings it to a showdown to prove and in this here instance he was proving that I the Lord Jehovah am God I'm proving that God is God and people are looking at lives today at you as Believers here in newf land to say is God really still God is there really a real God still today is there really a life that can be lived in the midst of leoa is there really something that has sustenance to it that's able to bring life in a dead generation Hallelujah we have a hidden Mana though that never goes bad but it has to come back to a place again where the nations of the world and the secular Believers will search for anything but the message oh my I don't know how many times I've run into it but it's been a lot where people they want what I've got but when they realize where it comes from they don't want it anymore why because they want life but they don't want to be humbled they want life but they don't want to surrender but life and death cannot go together they cannot mix John 6: 67-69 it would say and I so appreciate the special tonight it was about this scripture as Jesus saith unto The twel Wil you go go away also then Simon Peter answered him saying Lord to whom would we go thou alone has has the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen this is what it was in the days of Christ we're sure that you had the words of life amen but that is not the way it is anymore because it's not us looking and trying to find a Corporal Body of Christ and trying to look into the red letters cuz if you're just going to try and live by the red letters in the Bible you're going to be disappointed cuz even in John 16: 12 and 13 right there in the red letters Jesus said I will send the comforter because there's many things that you are not able to handle right now you can't understand right now but I'll send the comforter and when you're able to understand it he will teach you all things that he hears of me in other words there's Words of Christ that aren't written in red but they're written in red of the blood Hallelujah they're written on your hearts your written Epistles read of all men amen and we find here that thousands of in the days of Jesus were happy with the Miracles but when it came to the word of God they would accept anything but the word they would rather go back to their sinful ways than to accept that Jesus Christ is God then to accept that except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me then to accept that what if you see the son of man r r ascending back up into heaven from when he came to the right hand of God they couldn't accept that why because that was the word there was a lot of people in brother bram's day that hung around the message because of the Miracles they would come to the services and where are they today if they were all here the every Pew in here would be full but they were just interested in the Miracles but when it came to the opening of the word they couldn't receive it any longer they begin to go their own way their own Direction and begin to realize I don't think I can live that I don't think that's for me it just repeats itself over and over and over again it's always the word that divid that brings divisiveness amongst the masses it's the word of God that separates the sheep from the goats it's the word of God that takes the wheat from the tears in the Days of Elijah the prophet had gotten so bad before God brought it to a showdown that even those who greatly feared the Lord Obadiah have become shy to speak the word out of fear for their lives even obadi had to hide prophets in caves and when the word of for his day came right to him and said go tell Ahab he said I'm going to die if I do that because I know oh my I know if I go tell the king that you're here the spirit of God will just take you somewhere else and I'll come back here and I'll be left explaining to myself he was right here and ahab's had enough of that he'll cut my head off he'll had enough of it oh Saints the devil wants to try and trick you into that too try and take you and you know that your Jesus Christ took your healing upon him that by his Stripes you are healed he's the Healer of all your sicknesses and diseases that believe on the Lord and thy and thy house shall be saved and he wants to take those promises away from you and say you'll look like a knot if you say that you'll look like an oddball if you say that you ought never to do that you know what they'll do to you they'll kick you out of work you won't have a job you'll have no friends you'll have nobody left to go on don't say those things but God says no I'll back it up I'll be there if you'll beat me on the sacred Sands of Revelation I will meet you there Hallelujah God always brings it that way every Showdown Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration Mount Zion these were showdowns that were always brought in a time of pressure Kel was a time of pressure of religious pressure mount Transfiguration again religious pressure pressure but also political pressure that was there where the Romans were pressuring down the people causing them to live their way but it was in a day like that God brought a showdown to prove himself again and it's in a day like our day God's bringing it to a showdown let's go on in in in in First Kings First Kings chapter 18:1 17 and it came to pass that Ahab saw a Elijah and Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel oh my it's echoed today it's your language it's your unclos language that's troubling the people you trying to say that you're standing on the truth you're the reason oh God what does Ahab turn around and said no I haven't trouble with Israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord thou and that thou H has followed balum oh my thou has followed balum the doctrine of balam all the way back from what happened in Moab and the children of Israel they were coming out what happened he said we all serve the same God we all worship the same thing let's all get together we could go into that a lot more but let's carry on I think that'll unfold more it says now forth send and gather to me all of Israel unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets and together to Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long will thou halt between two opinions what a thought he's not saying how long will you hope between idols and a real living God because sometimes we read it that way like I said as history we're look at go of course I mean it was Baal it was an idol and you got and you got uh Jehovah the Unseen God and the god of Heaven the god of Earth the god of creation and you know it's pretty obvious but no it was a lot more subtle than that if I could paint in a different light what Jezebel brought was pretty churches and more beautiful women it wasn't so obvious and it wasn't just so oh this is horrible no it was pleasurable it was nice to the eyes it was nice to the flesh that's how it was at the Feast of Bale pure it wasn't something that the Children looked at and they should have looked at and said that's wrong but it was something about that caught them in their flesh and they begin to look on it and see oh that looks nice oh she's really pretty all that makeup is really nice I think I will follow after that I think I will till finally it brought in and where a prince in the house of Israel brought a daughter of one of the priest say right into the camp and decid to make love to her in his own tent right there in the Israeli camp but there was one man named Phineas that stood up that was praying there in the temple there stood Moses and there stood Joshua and there was eleazer and there was Aaron and there was Caleb and there was great man all praying before the Tabernacle saying God save us from this plag but one man previously unheard of got a hold of a revelation and realized this is wrong and he went took the javelin and he speared them right through the stomach right through both of them drove them right to the ground got rid of sin if you look at what their names actually mean their names actually mean music and false how did it start to creep into the church through a false music through a false beat and worldliness be to creep in begin to creep in begin to creep in and and and and and it was the ministry that had to stop it and say enough is enough somebody that was a part of the ministry but previously was unknown but he said stop it right here don't look for some big name we need a big name Preacher Brother Andrew we need somebody big that's going to come in and I'm waiting for that and I'm waiting for that no let somebody previously unheard of come on the scene and say God sin is enough kick it out of the camp hallelujah we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we ought not to be living and playing and toying with the things of the world and seeing how close to the world we ought to get we ought to run to the altar run to God get as close to him as we can Hallelujah I'm not talking about in a legalistic way I'm talking about allowing the spirit of God to move in our midst and wash us from every sin and unclean thing oh praise be to God we ought to allow the Lord to move in the days of Solomon it was obvious when Solomon tried to build temples for his foreign wives it was obvious the people looked at and said that's wrong it was that way in the days of brother Bram there was people that built temples that built all kinds of things that decided to make great Ministries over oil and hand and blood and here and this and that but the real people of God looked at and said no that's not quite right are you with me now but now it's become so convoluted over the generations in Israel it became so convoluted till when it came down to the days of Ahab the people were so mixed up in it it was just what everybody was doing or why do we have to be different everybody's doing this it's all throughout the land now my goodness they had a split in the church they had all kinds of things go on so after the days of Solomon 10 tribes went and split off went their own Direction and two tribes stay with the lineage of of David and well they went their own way and and then the the 10 that went away we know the king there he decided let's get some Idols going on because why does it always got to be a golden calf but it had to be a golden calf and they had to bring it down there we're going to put one in Dan and one in Ephraim we're people look at it was obvious But as time went on it be to be less and less obvious till he would even say in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 says for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his obviousness no it say through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ he gives us such a beautiful hint right there how do you know the difference is it simple Christ is simple it's a simple gospel it's not a great big convoluted thing and you got to see it this way and this is that one and that's that let the spirit of God move accept what he's doing hear what the spirit is saying to the churches the spirit the prophet and the bride they're all saying the same thing come and drink all ye that are a thirst come and drink of the Waters of Life freely Hallelujah would say the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of the church being on fire for God it becomes cooled off and becomes a bit formal that's what has happened back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal this is in the Ephesian Church age he says the abandonment to God was dying out and people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them oh my what a place for the church to get to that the thoughts of God start to hold less and less value they start to hold less and less weight in our lives and rather the thoughts of the world we begin to feed on those things that's where it comes from how did it creep in we opened up the gates we let down the bars brother BR says and the goats got in but how did the Sheep get out why you let down the bars stop letting down the bars and letting down the standard and letting down everything and just letting God come and letting the the devil come and we're calling it God and we're doing this and we're doing that no stay with the word that's our standard stay with the absolute Hallelujah that's why I said I appreciate a pastor that's got vision and talking to him the last few days he said I I'm staying with the word brother and said praise God stay with it Hallelujah we need to be careful what God thinks about he says that second generation coming out just like Israel they demanded to have a king to be like the other nations when they did that they rejected God Amen that's what God told Samuel said they didn't reject you Samuel they rejected me they rejected God he said but they did it anyway instead of the history that that is the history of the church when it thinks of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until they stop doing the things that they used to do and start doing the things that they wouldn't initially do worldliness begins creeping in the things that at once they said we'll never do that pretty soon it becomes P it's okay they get LAX he said they change their manner of dress their attitude and their behavior that is what Ephesus means is relaxed and drifting the cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you ever do all you have to do is recall the move of God in the when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took to the street corners they weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes and store old store buildings they had reality Hallelujah no I'm not preaching against having a nice church I think it's wonderful that God's given you this building before you got this building it was a storehouse it just houses a bunch of dead people but life's come in here now let's keep it that way let's invite some of those dead bones in so they can get alive Hallelujah can these Dry Bones live again absolutely they can it takes the spirit of God to breathe the breath of life into them and allow them to breathe what do it takes it takes the Senus to come upon them to bring about when Dry Bones come together it's a whole lot of noise but when the senu is beginning on what is it it's the doctrine of the message that begins to bring the bones together and put them in their rightful order then the flesh begins to come on it begins to be a holy and a Sanctified life but then the Breath of God breathes into it and it becomes a living Soul Born Again praise be to God they had reality but it wasn't a long time till they begin to have enough money to build find new churches and put a choir into singing unto God instead of themselves but put the put the gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man they soon begin to read books that just weren't fit to read oh my they soon begin to read books that just weren't fit to read I'll let your pastor decide which ones those are they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they let on they They carried on with the form words they still look the same they still came to church they still sang nice songs they still had the preacher get up and preach they still closed in prayer the form was still there but the joy was gone freedom in the spirit was gone the fire died down the Blackness of Ashes is all that's left what a place to get to that is the place it was at right there when Elijah came and said Gather the people it's time for a showdown it's time to prove who really is God is it these wishy-washy emotion filled services or is it the same God yesterday today and forever as it begins to go on in in chapter 18 verse 23 he says let them give us two Bullocks let them choose one bulock for themselves and put it and cut it in pieces lay wood put no fire under it I will dress the other bulock and I will lay on the wood and no fire under it and he was to say Elijah and and you shall call on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and we know he'd go down and and how he would go and they would come and have their great emotional service all the worship that went on that looked amazing it did they got so worked up in a frenzy the Bible records we could read it on down they started cutting themselves with lances and with knives and their blood flowing out they were sincere it looked so good and all they were doing Mad these guys they really know how to worship they called and Elijah just says call a little louder maybe he's asleep maybe he's gone on some errand maybe he's gone somewhere else he be to make a mockery of because when you have faith in who you are as a Christian you don't have to worry about what the devil's doing you don't have to worry about all of his shows that he's putting on all the Hollywood Glamour and Glitz and the drums and the light and the show and the everything else you don't have to worry about that because you're not concerned there's no God in those things there's a God of his word that believe when those who would believe on him would call on his name he'll answer Hallelujah but we find in verse 36 he says and it came to pass about the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and the Lord God of Abraham and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob let it be known this day that thou art God of Israel what happened Elijah had built an altar he'd gone to the altar that was torn down it was wrecked everything that of proper worship was ruined but he brought out stones of Revelation and begin to rebuild that altar one stone upon another 12 Stones one for each tribe of Israel know he took the wood and he laid it on the altar he took the the the bulock and he laid it on the Altar and he said go get water go get the word get me that first pole and they brought it poured it on the altar go again a second time go get the second pole bring it all back and wash the people again Hallelujah bring the third pole fill the trenches fill it all up let it all be full of water let the word of God be so poured in he said now Lord let God show that he is still God oh my let it be so and as he said prayed in this way that I have done all these things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear me that these people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou H has turned their heart back again oh Hallelujah I love that that he preaches it that way God is in the business of turning Hearts back again as is in our day according to Malachi chapter 4 John was sent for on the first Comm to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children but now we've had a the prophet to do what three PS to turn the hearts of the F children back to the faith of the fathers God is still in that business of turning the hearts again of the people back to his original faith and as he begins to go on and he begins to read it this way hear me oh Lord then the fire fell from God then the fire of the Lord fell and cons consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench oh hallelujah what an offering what an answer I am the Lord he's proving himself and when the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God and Elijah said unto them take the prophets of Baal let not one of them escape and he took them down and slew them by the Brook Kishon and slew them there and Elisha said unto Ahab get up eat and drink for there is the sound of the abundance of rain Hallelujah yeah let's Carry On This Way says and Elijah and and Ahab went un to eat and to drink but Elijah went up to the top of Mount Caramel and cast himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and he looked and he said there's nothing and he said go again seven times you know what that represents seven Church ages go again go again there's a rain coming I hear the sound they heard it on Pentecost I hear the sound of the abundance of rain go and look for that cloud they went up again and looked they went up again and looked they went up again and looked irenius went and looked Columba went and looked Martin went and looked Luther went and looked Hallelujah John Wesley went and looked they got some Revelation but when it finally come down to the latter rain there comes somebody that went up and looked and said I see it now it's about the size of a man's hand Hallelujah as they went up there he said sir go up and look seven times and it came to pass on the seventh time he said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up and unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not and it come to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black and the clouds and the wind and there was a great rain and Ahab rode and went to jezrael and we know that that Elijah anointed by the spirit of God outran the Chariots of of Ahab Hallelujah I want to just read this in the message look brother Brenham says the sign of the hand in the sky Elijah said that cloud was the size of a man's hand like a vapor what was it he kept on believing that might be all it is to you that might be all it is to you tonight all the message is is it's about the size of a man's hand I don't have a lot of re ration God hasn't given me a lot but I see something if you see something hold on to that and keep believing because brother ROM says this he says that cloud soon became two clouds and those clouds become a hill and the hill become a mountain of clouds and the mountain become Another Mountain of clouds and the first thing you know the whole Skies was thering and the rain was falling what was it he accepted what God sent Hallelujah God sends his word to those who fear Him him he will send his word to you if you're seeking him day and night he says if you'll seek me I will be found of you those who hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled amen we got all these precious promises but keep believing and when God sends it whatever he sends to you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if that's all he says accept it that's a doorway that you can walk through and then another one comes and then another one comes and it begins to build up into two clouds three clouds into a hill of clouds into a mountain of clouds into two mountains of clouds so pretty soon your left's laying there going oh God it's so much I can't even comprehend the greatness of God every time I think about it and step into the word of God it becomes overwhelming the Revelation that he begins to pour out why because I accepted it over and over and over and over that whatever he would send I said yes Lord that's for me Hallelujah Mary accepted that little word she said thou has found favor with the Lord you'll conceive and bring forth a son what dides she say be it unto me according to Thy word and that little statement brought forth something that we now sing a song Mary Did You Know She had no idea that her little boy would walk on water Mary didn't know she didn't have a clue she was no mother of God let me say that again in what was a Catholic Church Mary was not the mother of God hallelujah this ain't no Catholic church anymore this is a message church this is the lot of the hour don't never fear that Mary didn't know all she knew is I'm to have a child she baby was pondering on those scriptures for baby she was looking at it and she didn't really understand what Isaiah was talking about when he said H my or what David talking about they by bones they stare at me he didn't understand what Isaiah was talking about when they was bruised for my iniquity he didn't understand what he was talking about when it pleased God to bruise him he didn't understand what he's talking about there was no Beauty in him that we should desire him but to her was just a little baby just the sweetness and before that it was just a word it's something inside of her begin to grow that she didn't understand she was just a little maybe about 17year Old girl something begin to live in her something begin to change in her something begin to come and through the travail of birth there come a baby down in a stable in a way that she's probably sitting there going like any mother would think I've birthed the son but I wish it was better I wish I had a better place I wish I had a a more fancier place or a better place to welcome my child into the Earth how many of you mothers that are here would love to have a baby in a stable no none of you you go no please give me a nice clean hospital room or something really nice and clean and and and something where my child will be safe and I know I'm not worried about germs and diseases or anything else I'd like something safe I'm sure Mary wanted the same thing but God brought it about in such a simple way such a humble way and she would took so much care over that child that when he grew up to be about 12 years old he was found in the temple what was she doing frantically searching for what to her was her son she had no idea she got there and she finally found him and said your father and I have sought you with tears and he just turns around 12 years old and says know you not that I must be about my father's business she'd forgot over the course of 12 years but God had something more for her and as he come down and all of the ministry that he had I'm sure she seen him as he labored with the people he was a man about 30 years old but he looked beyond that about 50 years old and he looked much older than he was why because of the strain that the ministry put on him as he prayed for people and as he poured out his heart for people and as there was healing after healing after Vision after Vision after all kinds of things that was going on with that all he did said I do nothing but what the father shows me he was constantly in prayer night after night after day after night while staying in perfect touch with the spirit that was within him so he could come to that place and he come right down and as she stood there before him at the cross looking up at him her baby dying crucified the most horrible death little did she know there was something greater to come she was about to have something else come inside of her something greater than a 9-month child something greater than a 9month pregnancy it was going to last a lifetime she got into an upper room with the disciples with 120 of them there she finally got up there in upper room she didn't understand but she began to pray just like the rest of them she began to get real just like the rest well how did it start be it unto me according to Thy word she accepted that she accepted when he re she realized he must be about the father's business she accepted when she realized he has to go other places and preach she accepted when he realized in my own country I cannot do many miracles because a prophet is not without honor except in his own country she accepted when she realized he has to go to the cross and die she accepted all these things but now as God begin to come down into something that was even greater she begin to come and accept the holy ghost that come down on the day of Pentecost just started with something so small and grew and grew and grew just like it was in that first Showdown down to prove that Jehovah is God Baal was the greatest of Idols was the the king of the Gods but nothing it was nothing but a lie in the framework of the church it was in the framework of the Jews Israel but God came to prove himself to his people and all they needed to do was to accept that God is still God and accept what God sends and he made it real God sent it with a cloud and a pillar of fire in that day what happened with the sacrifice Pillar of Fire came down consumed the altar consumed the sacrifice consumed the wood consumed the dust left nothing but a burnt hole on the ground and a cloud came Hallelujah it's that way in every showdown in The Showdown on Mount Transfiguration there was a cloud and there was a pillar of fire in our Showdown there's a cloud there's a pillar of fire we'll get into that more this weekend Lord willing but God will always prove it and make it real I want to take a step and go into job as I'm I'm trying to wind it down we've been about an hour job when he was in his deepest of distress as it said these showdowns they come at the greatest pressure at a time of great pressure on the True Believer job when he was in the deepest of his distress when all of his riches had gone from him his children was dead his body was broke out in boils it was the greatest distress that he had he was ever in setting on an ash Heap with a Croc SC scraping his boils and his wife at the door why don't you just Curse God and die what did job say th speakest as a foolish woman even in that state he kept his character or I'll say his character kept him and when the members of the church had turned their backs on him 7even days and accused him why they ought to have been comforting him but they were accusing him of being a secret Center accusing him of being a backslider it was in that dark hour it was in that great moment it was that time when God took job to the sacred Sands where he takes every believer to an experience onto the backside of the desert he says just like he did with Moses out into a little secret closet where he could to where he took you where he took brother bradam into a little Coal Shed where he received it God has a place and a purpose and a Time Hallelujah God is Sovereign in all that he does God will reveal himself to whom he will reveal to them in the season that he will reveal it to them he's Sovereign in all that he does he doesn't he's not bound by the morals of man and man will decide by their own moral compass whether God is good or not but God is the very definition of morality cuz he can do as he pleases he's God Amen he's the creator of the heavens and earth why did he create us for Fellowship he desired to have fellowship with a being like an unto himself so he created man in his own image it was because of his desire that we are here it's because of his attributes that he we are able to stand in this day and be Believers and to receive the truth because he predestinated us to the adoption of sons amen and he desires to bring us out to a place what brother would call sacred Sands where he could meet us there and when he had job in this condition he had him on the sacred sense he was going to reveal something to him that would never go away Hallelujah that's just exactly the way Revelation is once God has revealed himself to you personally there was nobody that could talk you out of it Hallelujah no one could twist in your mind because God himself has come down and given you his word and it will not return unto him void it will do that which he has purposed it to do it will manifest himself in The Believer hallelujah oh my and that's the way Revelation is that God that's re that is what Revelation is that is what the new birth is it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen that when he personally reveals himself he bursts you into a Kingdom by his Spirit hallelujah oh those sacred Sands he has to take every real child there he gets you out into those places where no devil can ever come oh what a place to be out there in a place where no devil could ever come we could talk about it where brother bam talks in the inter Veil how it is when a Believer crosses over Beyond the Veil and he begins to come into the shikina glory of God the holiest of holies the veil drops around him he says and the Veil that drops around him is a spiritual Veil and he says there's nothing else can enter into that Veil it's you and God Alone amen where he speaks to you and he begins to whisper his little secrets to you personally oh Hallelujah he gives you something on those Sands back there that of an experience that you'll never forget as long as the ages roll roll on and no matter how athetic your mother or your daddy or your husband or your wife or your children or your Associates may become every True Believer has that spot where God has met him and there isn't one thing there isn't one left out every believer has it that's very emphatic of what every believer has that experience with God where you got alone with God and you get there alone with him and He makes himself real and let me tell you this is not the same as the person sitting next to you your testimony is your testimony God revealed RS himself personally to you even from a husband to a wife and I'm so happy to have my wife here with me tonight but our testimonies are different of how God came by our way and how God made himself real to us personally why because it's an individual walk with God and you can't compare with anyone else well that brother spoke in tongu that's nice that's what God did for him well that brother over there prophesied that's nice that's what God did for him that brother over there he became a preacher that's nice that's what God did for them but what's God doing for you amen because it's personal and it's individual every testimony is not comparable to the other there's only one similarity that was it was Christ it had to be you look to Christ and Christ came by your way and he comes in his own special time in his own special way he did something to that believer that up there the mentality in the presence Oh my he talks about Moses every person that's has born to the kingdom of God knows that spot that minute that hour where God took him and on those sacred Sands in the presence of the burning bush he did something to that believer that all the mentality of the world could not destroy he says Upon This Rock what is it Revelation I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not destroy it upon the rock the spiritual revelation of the resurrected Jesus job in his distress everything gone his wife turned against him accused him all of his believer friends had turned against him because they only had Theology and the rest had turned against them but God said come here job I'm I'm going to give you something boy Hallelujah that's my prayer this weekend that God would take each one of you aside and say come here not me but God would take you aside under the sacred Sands this weekend and say come here boy come here girl I want to teach you something I'm going to a place within you something that all the Devils of hell can't shake out of you every teacher in the world might accuse you only one way or the other Will Never Move you let me tell you this Satan does not have access to your soul Satan chose the battleground of the Mind God chose the soul and you either have faith or doubt in the soul you choose that's your free moral agency whether you believe God and accept what he sent to you or whether you doubt it that's your choice Satan cannot access that there's a place where God could seal you away as the new birth is a seal until the day of your Redemption and seal you away so no devil could ever enter there oh praise be to God hallelujah job he said look out yonder what did job see what do you think he saw he saw Easter for its first time thousands of years before it ever happened job saw Easter for the first time he saw the first Easter and he screamed out I know My Redeemer liveth oh what a blessed place to be every man that's chosen of God every child every woman that comes to that spot on the sacred Sands to where God lifts the curtain to show you his resurrected power that's what he wants to show you tonight he wants to show you his resurrected power you know that he lives that as job can cry out I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day he will stand on the earth and even if the skin worms destroy this flesh yet in my flesh I shall see God what a revelation job was given there by God it's the same Revelation he gives us today by a new birth when we realize Jesus Christ is not only resurrected but because he lives I live also Hallelujah and because he cannot die I cannot die because it's his spirit in me it's not me but I've received the spirit of adoption hallelujah oh Saints when Elijah revealed to Obadiah don't fear I'll be right here waiting for for the king then Obadiah could go with confidence to the king knowing the word for the day was about to be brought to pass Hallelujah all that he'd been praying for all that he was seeking God for was about to be accomplished I imagine OB die as a man that feared God those three and a half years he wasn't just walking about frivolously but he was on his knees before God how long will this go on how long will the people Hal between two opinions how long will this happen oh God send your word send your word send your word accomplish your word fulfill it Lord he was on his knees praying it was the same way with the children of Israel when they were there in captivity for 400 years when they begin to call upon God then God sent a deliverer oh praise be to God what about you and I tonight Saints we're looking for a Rapture we're looking for a resurrection we're looking for the power of God that's in you and I to raise the Dead from the grave we're looking for that brother that's what the Holy Ghost was given for we're looking for those things aren't you looking for that we want to see a real living God say well I've seen him brother Andrew I seen testimonies I've got testimonies I'm still not satisfied I want more I want more of God yes I want more miracles but I'm not looking for miracles I'm looking to accept God on the basis of his presence Hallelujah to allow God to move in our midst to allow him let's let's be abandoned to the word of God abandon the world in all of its ways forget about it when God proved to him don't fear he could walk with confidence that God was about to prove himself to the nation that's what the sacred Sands is to every believer God proving personally to you he's still God and he's Sovereign in his ways he'll do as he pleases there's such a joy and such a peace in that revelation you can realize that and come to such a revelation that God is God that's so simple but it's a revelation the world don't believe that they don't they believe anything else there might be some higher power there is no God there's this there's that secular world doesn't even really believe that God is God because if they did they'd believe in miracles too they believe the God of this Bible if they believe that God is God but it's a revelation that's poured upon you a showdown that God gives to every believer I'm still the same yesterday today and forever and I will not change and you could lay a hold in that because you have an anchor in Jesus Christ within the veil and we know the scripture says by these two immutable things one God cannot lie Hallelujah God cannot lie if he said thy and thy house will be saved thy and thy house will be saved if you will believe if he said by his stripes you will be healed you are healed already you are already healed Hallelujah if he said that I've T borne all of your iniquities oh my you mean the things that I knew better and I went and did it anyway he bore that yes he did he does not lie even though you might have an unrighteous thought if you'll turn from that thought and repent of it and turn to God he will abundantly pardon you he will give you life Everlasting I don't care how young you are or how old you are God is God and he cares for you let's stand to our feet as musicians come if I could express that to you your life is in God's hands it's in the hands of the one who's able discern to discern between the thoughts and intents of the heart Jeremiah 29 says for I know that the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me and you shall search for me with all of your heart and I will be found of you saeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity I will gather you from the Nations and from all the places from whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I will bring you again into a place whence I caused you to be carried away captive you came from God you're going back to God you might have been thrown out here and thrown out there but God's Gathering back in again say Let The Trials come that's a hard thing to say we don't want trials Let The Trials come let the hardships come the Heartbreak we're not resting in our own ability we're resting in the palm of our savior hands let Satan present himself before the Lord let God say have you considered my little bride over there in New Finland how they've come such a long way how they've served me how they've been faithful she's perfect in all our ways just sink down below the pulpit there you calling me perfect yeah in Jesus Christ his word he's the Perfection he's the one that's bringing you to a place of maturity God is God if he slay me I will serve him if he lifts me up I'll remain him in humility if he cast me down I'll love him nonetheless as David wrote though I make my bed in hell he's there he said I'll be with you even in you I'll never leave you even to the end of the world it's not by might though it's not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord hallelujah do we know that song not by might nor by power but by my spirit brother if you would come I wait till to get the words up there hallelujah amen not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts not by m oh not by power but by my spirit safe the Lord this mountain this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed by my spirit said the Lord there away do doubts and fre of bound press on oh hear the spirit sing this mountain shall come down not by m oh nor

back and your reach the other side not by mind nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts not by my nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed by my spirit say the Lord so then trust alone the Mighty God he speaks the winds oy take courage then no thinking heart for you he'll make a way not by might oh nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts not by might nor by power but by my spirit say the Lord this mountain shall be removed this mountain this [Music] mountain by my spirit sayi the Lord amen I enjoyed that this evening and just to calm you brother Andrew I'm not going to repeat your sermon but there is a couple things I love to you know when a minister preaches I love to just dry out some of those highlights and I love what he said he says God's words are spoken with purpose and next to my Bible I'd already written there purposeful God doesn't speak idly but he sends it with purpose but what I loved is that if you see he sends it Like Rain which is immediate watering but he sends snow you know where snow goes It goes up in the mountains and it waits for the dry season so that as it warms up and the dry season it comes down and it Waters that which doesn't get any rain so he provides for the wet season he provides for the dry season but what I love more than that is he always has a good seed ready to receive it we look around so often and we see all the bad that's going on and we we we see what people are doing with the word of God and we see what they're not doing with the word of God and all these things but there's always a good seed to receive what God has sent amen and it produces the life that he ordained regardless of what Satan's trying to do to mess it all up amen he said a showdown is to prove something it's not to prove me it's to prove that God's real amen I love what brother bam he says he says to overcome is to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks and to know that greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world he says when you start doing the things you used to not do very soon you stop doing the things of God you used to do and we lose the reality of God we were fellowshipping and we were talking about something and I I said this is the way I approach those things did the spirit of God that told you not to do now come back and tell you to do it does God tell you not to do it and then tell you to do something is it wrong one day and right the next if God tells us it's wrong then why are we picking it up again amen the spirit of God doesn't come back and make it right if it's wrong it's wrong it's if it's right it's right and he doesn't go back and forth amen I love what he said when you have faith in the word of God you don't have to worry what Satan might do Elijah wasn't worried that Satan was to produce fire Satan can't produce fire Satan can't consume these things he knew who he was he knew who God was and so he had total faith in that I love how he brought out the cloud started small but it grew because Elijah had faith in the word of God that said I'm going to make it rain and he stayed there and even though the man came back gesi came back six times saying nothing is there the seventh time he comes back and he sees something and it's so small but Elijah's faith says there's still a the sound of abundance of rain go tell Ahab to get out cuz it's going to get bad in a hurry and pretty soon he says the skies are full and they're dark and all these different things what is it the word came to pass Elijah stayed there until what he believed happened until what God told him would happen would happen but I think the thing that was the the most beautiful in all this was how he finished you notice that he said job saw the answer to his question and the answer to his need thousands of years before it would ever occur and yet in seeing that answer and having that Revelation job said I can die in peace because I know that in the last day he'll rais me up he could die he had a rest and he had an assurance knowing that the answer was given to him he had a revelation that God would not leave his soul in Hell nor that he would see corruption amen that God would restore him back to his original condition just like those flowers were he could have rest because God had given him a revelation you're in the palm of my hands I won't leave you behind amen that was beautiful brother Andrew certainly enjoyed that let's sing that song when I think about the Lord I don't know the number sorry but I believe we know it when I think about the Lord how he saved me how he raised me how he filled me with the whole Holy Ghost how he healed me to the uttermost
