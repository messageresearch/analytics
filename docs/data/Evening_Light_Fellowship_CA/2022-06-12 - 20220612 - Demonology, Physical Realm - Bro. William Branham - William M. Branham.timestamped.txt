[54:44] not a long message
[54:48] and for our
[54:50] brother beisel that you would start on
[54:53] paragraph eight in demonology june the
[54:56] sixth 1963
[54:59] amen and his demonology in the physical
[55:02] realm
[55:03] june 6 1963
[55:06] and so ask our brother to start at
[55:08] paragraph eight and we'll go on to
[55:10] paragraph one zero seven amen
[55:16] and in matthew chapter four
[55:20] verse 1
[55:21] then was jesus led up of the spirit
[55:26] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[55:28] devil
[55:30] amen that's the
[55:32] truth and when he had fasted 40 days and
[55:36] 40 nights
[55:38] he was afterward and hungered
[55:41] and when the tempter came to him
[55:44] he said
[55:45] if thou be the son of god command that
[55:49] these stones be made bread
[55:53] but he answered and said
[55:55] it is written
[55:57] amen
[55:59] man shall not live by bread alone
[56:02] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[56:06] the mouth of god
[56:07] and god allows the enemy sometimes to
[56:10] tempt us but to bring out the revelation
[56:13] of the word that's in our hearts amen
[56:16] concerning what jesus was experiencing
[56:18] in the mind of temptation it brought out
[56:21] the word the word it is written it is
[56:23] written it is written amen brother in
[56:26] all that the enemy does to you the only
[56:29] the only weapon that we have to defeat
[56:31] the enemy is the word satan it's written
[56:35] get thee behind me satan
[56:37] amen
[56:40] and again verse 4 he answered and said
[56:42] it is written
[56:44] man shall not live by bread alone
[56:47] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[56:51] the mouth of god
[56:53] amen
[56:55] and then the devil taketh him up into
[56:57] the holy city and sitteth them on a
[57:00] pinnacle of the temple
[57:03] and saith unto him if thou be the son of
[57:06] god
[57:08] cast thyself down
[57:10] for it is written
[57:12] amen
[57:13] yeah then the enemy
[57:15] quoted the scripture
[57:17] that's right
[57:19] he took jesus up and said no no
[57:22] jesus it's written
[57:24] because jesus highlighted
[57:26] the scripture the word to the devil
[57:29] it is written man shall not live by
[57:31] bread alone but by every word that
[57:33] proceeds out of the mouth of god now the
[57:35] enemy is going to quote the scripture to
[57:37] him but it's going to take it out of
[57:38] balance out of out of text and so on the
[57:42] way that the way that god meant it oh
[57:44] yeah don't let the devil quote the word
[57:46] to you and say this or this the bible
[57:48] says this yeah
[57:50] you're right satan
[57:51] yeah but make sure it's it's you keep it
[57:54] in the way that god wants it
[57:56] amen the enemy is there to take it out
[57:59] of context to add this to add that to
[58:01] get yours or get you to believe this get
[58:03] you to believe that well that's good
[58:05] but what is the will of god it revealed
[58:07] in it
[58:09] so verse 6 again and saith unto him if
[58:12] thou be the son of god cast thyself down
[58:15] for yeah yeah
[58:17] he goes back to the word
[58:19] satan
[58:21] yeah
[58:22] it is written
[58:24] it shall give his angels charged
[58:25] concerning thee
[58:27] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[58:29] of lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[58:32] against a stone amen yes it is but it's
[58:36] got to be in the will of god
[58:38] god's way
[58:40] amen
[58:42] and jesus saith unto him it is written
[58:45] again
[58:46] thou shalt not tempt
[58:48] the lord thy god
[58:51] amen there's many a time when believers
[58:53] tempt god
[58:55] tempt god to do this tim god they'll go
[58:57] out and do this and and it's not the
[58:58] will of god god don't want him to do it
[59:00] as satan's influencing your life
[59:02] oh well that's sorry the lord will be
[59:03] with me and the lord yeah if it's his
[59:05] will he'll be with you

[59:14] you're listening to that it's god you're
[59:16] listening to
[59:17] because satan will quote the word as
[59:19] well as the lord
[59:20] amen he will
[59:22] but make sure it's the will of god amen
[59:25] oh praise the lord
[59:27] amen
[59:28] and jesus said unto him it is written
[59:30] again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy
[59:34] god
[59:35] don't tempt god
[59:37] with what you do
[59:38] or what you don't do
[59:40] don't tempt god into the well if i do
[59:42] this god will do this if i yes if it's
[59:44] my will
[59:46] if it's god will for you to do that
[59:48] he'll be with you
[59:50] and he'll be there to help you
[59:52] but if it's not his will
[59:53] you'll pay the price
[59:55] you'll suffer

[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:23] but brother we need to leave the word
[1:07:24] the way that god give it and let god

[1:08:40] god as it were and deceive you
[1:08:44] oh i'm the lord i'm this and i'm that
[1:08:46] brother just just think when god in the
[1:08:49] beginning in adam and eve and he came
[1:08:50] down and gave his word
[1:08:52] then the enemy came over through the
[1:08:53] serpent and he began to say this and say
[1:08:56] this do this do this yeah
[1:08:58] what was he focusing on he was focusing
[1:09:00] on the flesh
[1:09:02] he's focusing on the natural things
[1:09:05] of life
[1:09:06] oh yeah
[1:09:07] and satan can can bless you this way and
[1:09:09] bless you that way when it comes to the
[1:09:11] physical things of life oh yes

[1:15:34] though after that little fella got a as
[1:15:36] much as he could
[1:15:37] he let the bucket down and run off out
[1:15:39] there you know what happened the mother
[1:15:41] bearing the other little bear got to
[1:15:42] licking him
[1:15:45] get the honey all so well maybe our
[1:15:47] meeting will be something on that order
[1:15:48] i hope so we can just keep telling
[1:15:50] others and the glory of god falling upon
[1:15:52] us all right
[1:15:54] i'm glad to see little children out i
[1:15:56] like to tell you something like that and
[1:15:58] maybe tomorrow afternoon we have more
[1:16:00] time and we can talk a little more and
[1:16:02] we'll talk to dad's mother now about
[1:16:04] something we're going to talk on
[1:16:05] demonology in psalms 100
[1:16:09] and 3
[1:16:10] 1 to 3 we read these verses
[1:16:13] most every minister clergyman or
[1:16:16] bible reader knows them by heart
[1:16:18] bless the lord o my soul and all that is
[1:16:21] within me bless his holy name
[1:16:23] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[1:16:25] all of these benefits who forgive us all
[1:16:28] of thine iniquity who healeth all of thy
[1:16:30] diseases
[1:16:32] i want you to notice there it was in all
[1:16:35] who forgive us all thine iniquities who
[1:16:38] health all of our diseases how can we
[1:16:40] bow our heads just a moment a heavenly
[1:16:42] father we thank you this afternoon for
[1:16:44] being out here
[1:16:46] we thank thee for these little children
[1:16:47] that's sitting around they're the man of
[1:16:49] tomorrow and women if there is a
[1:16:51] tomorrow if jesus tarries and now father
[1:16:54] we pray that that you'll bless us now as
[1:16:57] we're talking now on your word
[1:16:59] and about the great enemy we have
[1:17:03] satan
[1:17:04] we pray god that you'll let us uh
[1:17:07] put a front out a mechanized unit here
[1:17:10] the power of god that will withstand the
[1:17:12] night in every inch of his ground lord
[1:17:14] and showing that he don't have no legal
[1:17:17] rights at all that christ defeated him
[1:17:19] in our stood there at calvary when he
[1:17:22] died and he spoiled principalities and
[1:17:24] robbed satan of ever ever his power that
[1:17:26] he had
[1:17:27] and god gave us wisdom and understanding
[1:17:30] now to know and to explain to the people
[1:17:33] how that they might know how to be
[1:17:34] healed and to defeat satan in jesus name
[1:17:37] we pray amen
[1:17:40] now for a few minutes we go to speak on
[1:17:42] demonology you hear so much about demons
[1:17:45] now tomorrow afternoon we'll probably
[1:17:47] finish up i wanted two days of this week
[1:17:49] anyhow to preach on this just uh or two
[1:17:51] days for afternoon services uh to talk
[1:17:54] on this
[1:17:56] now the first thing what a demon is you
[1:17:58] hear so many people talking about a
[1:18:00] demon
[1:18:02] well now a demon devil
[1:18:05] all comes from one word and in the
[1:18:07] english it's called tormentor
[1:18:10] a fellow that torments
[1:18:12] is a devil a evil one
[1:18:16] he
[1:18:17] say
[1:18:18] now the bible today
[1:18:21] is
[1:18:22] to most to many people is some old
[1:18:25] backed book that grandpa and grandma
[1:18:28] read or something like that
[1:18:30] there's not much to it it's for the old
[1:18:32] folks and so forth but that's wrong
[1:18:35] it's for everybody
[1:18:37] and
[1:18:39] demons are tormentors that torment us
[1:18:41] now there is demons
[1:18:43] that comes into the soul of man
[1:18:46] and that is in the phraseology that
[1:18:49] would be that would be in the i'd say
[1:18:51] thistle the demon that comes into the
[1:18:54] soul
[1:18:56] is uh something that torments the soul
[1:18:59] many times you can
[1:19:01] see a person maybe of insanity
[1:19:04] now they may be yet a converted person
[1:19:08] feel with the holy spirit and yet be
[1:19:10] totally insane
[1:19:12] see
[1:19:13] that's right that has nothing to do with
[1:19:14] the soul it's a tormentor
[1:19:17] something that torments them
[1:19:19] now all sickness we have to find first
[1:19:22] that all sickness came from the devil
[1:19:26] god is not the author of sickness
[1:19:28] no sickness comes from god
[1:19:31] god sometimes permits satan to put
[1:19:34] sickness on you as a whip to bring you
[1:19:36] back to the house of god when you've
[1:19:37] disobeyed
[1:19:39] but sickness in its beginning come from
[1:19:41] the devil could you imagine a person
[1:19:44] would believe that god our heavenly
[1:19:46] father
[1:19:48] would
[1:19:49] be the author of such a thing as
[1:19:50] sickness and death
[1:19:52] but no he isn't
[1:19:54] never was
[1:19:56] never will be
[1:19:58] god permits death because of
[1:20:00] disobedience
[1:20:01] god permits death as one writer said all
[1:20:04] that death can do god harnessed it to a
[1:20:06] buggy and it pulls us into the presence
[1:20:08] of god a believer
[1:20:10] but a the word death means separation
[1:20:13] jesus said he that heareth my words and
[1:20:15] believeth on him and sent me hath
[1:20:17] everlasting life
[1:20:20] and he said i am the resurrection life
[1:20:22] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:20:23] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[1:20:25] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:20:28] die
[1:20:31] and we pack the bodies of each other
[1:20:33] over the saintlets of our graves
[1:20:35] but he shall never die now if you watch
[1:20:37] when he spoke of lazarus he said lazarus
[1:20:41] sleepeth the disciples man like we are
[1:20:44] they said oh if he sleepeth he'd do as
[1:20:46] well
[1:20:47] he meant taking a rest what they thought
[1:20:49] but he'd come and talk to them in their
[1:20:50] language he said he's dead
[1:20:53] what you believe
[1:20:54] but said i go waking
[1:20:56] waking
[1:20:59] see when you're uh death means separate
[1:21:02] now if one of you should one of your
[1:21:05] family die or something he is if it's
[1:21:07] converted they're not dead
[1:21:10] they're dead in a humanistic standpoint
[1:21:12] but they're just separated from us but
[1:21:14] they're in the presence of god
[1:21:17] they're not dead and they can't die
[1:21:20] it's impossible for them to die
[1:21:22] jesus said he that heareth my words and
[1:21:24] believeth on him and sent me has
[1:21:25] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:21:29] judgment but has passed from death to
[1:21:31] life
[1:21:32] so he can't die
[1:21:34] anything it's immortal eternal it can't
[1:21:37] perish it's imperishable life
[1:21:39] he's got it because god has given to him
[1:21:42] and not not meritorious it's with it's
[1:21:45] unconditional god gives it to him
[1:21:48] god calls no man could come to god
[1:21:50] except god called him
[1:21:52] jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:21:55] my father calls him
[1:21:56] draws him is that right
[1:21:59] so it's god and all
[1:22:01] maybe tomorrow afternoon we'll get a
[1:22:02] little bit more on that because i want
[1:22:03] to get this thing of disease to you so
[1:22:05] that you'll see that there was a time
[1:22:08] when our we become germatized and our
[1:22:11] great grandfather
[1:22:13] you know that
[1:22:14] doctor knows that well you do to you
[1:22:16] bible readers you know the germ of life
[1:22:19] started in your great grandfather to
[1:22:21] becoming a germ and come out to your
[1:22:23] grandfather then into your father and
[1:22:24] then to your mother and where you are
[1:22:26] now
[1:22:27] that's right scripture even teaches that
[1:22:30] here's the scripture for if y'all uh i
[1:22:32] believe
[1:22:33] it said that levi paid tithes when he
[1:22:36] was in the lawns of abraham which was
[1:22:37] his great-grandfather
[1:22:39] is that right so see the germ become
[1:22:41] back there but your souls
[1:22:44] were made up before the foundation of
[1:22:45] the world and god created man in his own
[1:22:48] image
[1:22:51] spirit of man not a man in his own image
[1:22:53] but man in his own image
[1:22:56] see and then he made them male and
[1:22:58] female
[1:23:01] before he ever had a man in the dust the
[1:23:03] earth
[1:23:04] which we had a chance this afternoon
[1:23:06] take a time and go back into that you'll
[1:23:08] see how god now it's between the line
[1:23:10] but when you see it comes right up with
[1:23:11] the line thing how did god back in the
[1:23:14] beginning what he did there and how he
[1:23:16] moved down into the earth and how that
[1:23:19] he made man in his image and then god
[1:23:21] turned around was made in the image of
[1:23:23] man
[1:23:25] to redeem man now when god made man in
[1:23:28] his they meant she was a spirit man
[1:23:30] and then there was no man to tell the
[1:23:32] sorrow that he created man how to dust
[1:23:34] the earth
[1:23:35] our chronologists and so forth and these
[1:23:37] people search and get old bones and so
[1:23:40] forth and believe in evolution i believe
[1:23:42] in the right kind of evolution man
[1:23:44] evolutes from himself but not all from
[1:23:45] one cell
[1:23:47] no sir because a a bird has been a bird
[1:23:50] ever since god made him a bird
[1:23:52] and a monkey's been a monkey a man's
[1:23:54] been a man
[1:23:56] that's right
[1:23:57] now i was talking to a doctor here a
[1:23:59] while back
[1:24:00] in louisville he said while reverend
[1:24:02] brown was talking about how the navies
[1:24:03] of africa how they eat just go down but
[1:24:05] oh some of the awful things you'd ever
[1:24:07] see how they would eat just pick up
[1:24:08] things that's contaminated maggots in it
[1:24:10] just shake them around making all don't
[1:24:12] make any difference to him see
[1:24:14] they said drink anything don't make any
[1:24:17] difference what it is he said but
[1:24:18] reverend brown that people are not human
[1:24:20] i said oh yes they are
[1:24:22] they sure are human i said the closest
[1:24:24] thing to a human being in the beast line
[1:24:26] is a chimpanzee and you tried for four
[1:24:28] thousand years to get one mutter out of
[1:24:30] that japanese and he can't do it
[1:24:32] i said because he can't think
[1:24:34] he has nothing to think with
[1:24:36] or you can learn in little things like a
[1:24:38] horse g and hor or put on glasses or
[1:24:40] smoke a cigar or balance yourself on a
[1:24:42] bicycle ride a horse or something like
[1:24:44] that but just like gian hall to a horse
[1:24:46] or
[1:24:47] to a dog or something like that i said
[1:24:49] he's an animal but you let me go back in
[1:24:51] africa to the wildest tribe they got and
[1:24:54] that's the little tribe of the bushman
[1:24:56] now i said probably his great great
[1:24:58] great great grandfather never saw a
[1:25:00] white man or nothing the only thing that
[1:25:02] he knows he don't even know which is
[1:25:03] right and left hand the only thing he
[1:25:04] knows is he
[1:25:05] and he's trying to get his hands off
[1:25:07] it's human flesh anything else it'll
[1:25:08] make a difference to him just so he eats
[1:25:11] but let me get him at five years old and
[1:25:13] at 15 years old he'll speak good english
[1:25:16] and have a good education
[1:25:18] why he's got a soul
[1:25:19] god made him a human being
[1:25:22] and he's got just as much right to hear
[1:25:23] the gospel at least once as we have
[1:25:26] preaching around here all over america
[1:25:28] the people over and over and over
[1:25:29] begging persuading and everything
[1:25:31] letting here at one time and watch him
[1:25:32] scream and run to the altar real quick
[1:25:34] see
[1:25:35] yes sir that's what my heart is brother
[1:25:38] today when i think of africa and that
[1:25:39] poor little black hands raising up
[1:25:41] saying brother branham one more time
[1:25:42] about jesus oh mercy
[1:25:44] there's something in me digs and burns
[1:25:47] just as quick as i get money enough up i
[1:25:49] get over there too
[1:25:51] that's what i do with every penny i get
[1:25:53] everything god knows besides just what i
[1:25:55] can eat and most people give me my
[1:25:57] clothes
[1:25:58] and just what i can barely live by
[1:26:00] myself just as close as i can i thought
[1:26:02] right into missionary funds which the
[1:26:04] government has ranged i don't even pay
[1:26:06] income tax on it to get up three or four
[1:26:08] five thousand dollars and take a cross
[1:26:09] over there and preach the gospel to the
[1:26:11] people that i know that that day i'll
[1:26:13] have to answer now know what i answer
[1:26:16] far
[1:26:17] i used to want to go in the city and
[1:26:18] hold a big meeting back when they had
[1:26:19] lots of money and to have great
[1:26:21] campaigns and thousands of dollars i'd
[1:26:23] give it over to red cross and so forth
[1:26:25] uh not enough no slam to them but coming
[1:26:27] down the street in a four thousand
[1:26:29] dollar car the big diamond stud zone
[1:26:31] smoking a cigar 500 a week on the money
[1:26:34] that sick people no sir
[1:26:36] no indeed not only as soon as you get
[1:26:38] out of the city instead of holy rollers
[1:26:40] and everything like that and making fun
[1:26:42] and down in the religion that we're
[1:26:43] standing up for no sir i take it myself
[1:26:46] and before god is my judge i put it in
[1:26:48] the gospel work counter so i know it on
[1:26:49] that day that uh when i have to give an
[1:26:51] account for my stewardship it's given
[1:26:53] correctly that's exactly right because i
[1:26:55] realize is i treat the people i'm
[1:26:57] treating god
[1:26:58] just my attitude towards you is my
[1:27:00] attitude towards christ
[1:27:02] your attitude towards me is the same
[1:27:04] thing that's right towards christ
[1:27:07] now the sea of people like that and see
[1:27:09] how that a human being man with an
[1:27:12] immortal soul now
[1:27:14] that can't die can't perish can't do
[1:27:16] nothing but have everlasting life that
[1:27:18] god sovereignly in his own will gave it
[1:27:20] to you
[1:27:22] and now then
[1:27:23] now i for let me correct this just a
[1:27:26] little bit or say something somebody's
[1:27:27] going to go and say brother brown is a
[1:27:28] calvinist no i'm not i'm a calvarist as
[1:27:31] long as calvinist is in the bible
[1:27:33] but when calvinist gets out of the bible
[1:27:35] then i'm an armenian see i believe in
[1:27:37] holiness and i believe in calvinists too
[1:27:39] but both of them one run out on the limb
[1:27:41] and went this way and one right on the
[1:27:42] limb and went that way if it wasn't for
[1:27:44] the book of ephesians to bring it back
[1:27:45] and put it in the right place where god
[1:27:47] did we'd all be all mixed up but they
[1:27:50] both got a doctrine but they go to seed
[1:27:52] on it each one that's the holiness and
[1:27:54] the calvinist ii the armenian now
[1:27:58] calvinist has something true i believe
[1:28:00] that that the calvinistic doctrine i
[1:28:02] believe this in security i believe the
[1:28:04] church has eternal security
[1:28:07] any reader the bible knows that because
[1:28:08] god's already said it with a period or
[1:28:10] without blemish is that right
[1:28:12] then it's going to be there is that
[1:28:13] right
[1:28:14] the by the church is eternally secured
[1:28:17] now are you in the church is the next
[1:28:19] thing
[1:28:20] if you're in the church all right you're
[1:28:22] secured with the church but you better
[1:28:24] stay in the church
[1:28:26] and how do you get in the church by
[1:28:27] shaking a hand no put your name in the
[1:28:29] book no sir by one spirit we're all
[1:28:31] baptized into one body and that body god
[1:28:34] judged the calvary was the body of jesus
[1:28:36] christ and we're baptized into that body
[1:28:38] by one spirit we have eternal security
[1:28:41] as long as we're in the body of christ
[1:28:42] nothing can separate us nothing can
[1:28:44] touch us
[1:28:45] if you go out you go out by your own
[1:28:47] will
[1:28:48] but just as sure if you're in the body
[1:28:50] of christ as sure as jesus rose from the
[1:28:52] dead you'll rise to
[1:28:54] god's already done that he you can't sin
[1:28:57] or you do i might be a sinner in your
[1:28:59] sight but if i'm in christ god don't see
[1:29:01] it because his sins atones his blood
[1:29:03] atones from my sins there see i can't
[1:29:05] sin he just born god does not commit sin
[1:29:08] for you cannot sin the seed of god
[1:29:10] remains in him see
[1:29:11] he's willing to if he's makes a mistake
[1:29:14] sure he's right then willing to confess
[1:29:15] it if he's a real christian he will do
[1:29:17] it if he holds it back he shows he ain't
[1:29:19] got nothing in the first place
[1:29:21] that's right he hasn't got nothing to
[1:29:22] begin with but if he's a real christian
[1:29:24] right here you plant a grain of wheat in
[1:29:26] the ground it'll always be a grain of
[1:29:28] wheat cockle birds may be all around and
[1:29:29] everything else but it'll be a grain of
[1:29:31] wheat as long as it stands
[1:29:33] is that right
[1:29:34] and if a man's really born to the spirit
[1:29:36] of god he isn't in and out and back and
[1:29:37] forth
[1:29:38] you know in the world and i hear no sir
[1:29:40] no no you're not a coca bird one day and
[1:29:42] a grain of wheat the next day god don't
[1:29:43] have that in the field
[1:29:45] yes sir if you're born to the spirit of
[1:29:47] god you're a christian from that time
[1:29:48] until
[1:29:49] until you go away and then your you're
[1:29:51] immortal with god
[1:29:53] that's right if you're in the church
[1:29:55] now now let's talk about the death side
[1:29:57] now how could a person on that estate
[1:29:59] and that kind of a condition ever be
[1:30:01] sick
[1:30:03] because that your body is not yet
[1:30:06] redeemed
[1:30:08] your body is not redeemed no matter how
[1:30:11] much how good you are and how saintly
[1:30:14] and how holy how much holy spirit that's
[1:30:16] only your soul
[1:30:18] and your soul is not completed yet
[1:30:21] it's just got the blessing the promise
[1:30:22] of god which is the earnest of our
[1:30:24] salvation
[1:30:26] but now if we have no earnest of our
[1:30:28] resurrection
[1:30:30] no divine healing then
[1:30:32] i have no assurance or nothing to prove
[1:30:35] to me that there is a resurrection
[1:30:38] just like if christ doesn't live in my
[1:30:39] heart
[1:30:40] if i have to take it from some kind of a
[1:30:42] psychological uh thing backyard i had to
[1:30:45] believe somewhere like that
[1:30:47] well then i i'd be a little skeptical of
[1:30:50] it
[1:30:50] and that's reason over in africa when
[1:30:52] they come here come missionaries up
[1:30:54] bringing thousands of those natives and
[1:30:56] this packing little mud idols and
[1:30:58] everything else is because that they had
[1:31:00] just heard the psychic side of the bible
[1:31:04] that's right my own churches baptist
[1:31:06] methodist presbyterian all went in there
[1:31:08] but when they seen the power of god
[1:31:10] coming demonstration that settled it
[1:31:12] they know then that god was god but now
[1:31:14] what starts this sickness
[1:31:17] now the first thing it's a spirit before
[1:31:20] it becomes a disease
[1:31:22] just the same as you as a spirit before
[1:31:25] you become a human being
[1:31:27] now i'm going to take brother willits
[1:31:28] here as an example
[1:31:30] brother willits
[1:31:32] uh
[1:31:33] there was a time when you and i wasn't
[1:31:35] nothing
[1:31:37] and then the first thing
[1:31:39] god gave us a life
[1:31:41] and let's take if i take your body down
[1:31:43] this afternoon you're made up of a bunch
[1:31:45] of cells
[1:31:48] held together with atoms
[1:31:50] and now
[1:31:52] uh someday them atoms will be destroyed
[1:31:54] if jesus tarries you'll go on back
[1:31:57] they'll be just like there was in the
[1:31:58] beginning go back into the air but when
[1:32:01] your spirit returns those atoms will
[1:32:03] gather together again with this spirit
[1:32:04] and bring forth another brother willis
[1:32:06] just like that
[1:32:07] only younger when he was at his best
[1:32:10] when a man gets past about 25 years old
[1:32:12] he finds a few wrinkles under his eyes
[1:32:14] and some gray hairs coming in
[1:32:16] it's going to be
[1:32:17] because this after you and one of these
[1:32:20] days is going to take you
[1:32:22] no matter who you are it's going to take
[1:32:24] you but if gradually you'll get in a
[1:32:26] corner here and god will get you out of
[1:32:27] that corner you get in this corner here
[1:32:28] death will almost have you over here but
[1:32:30] after a while it'll get you but then
[1:32:32] what death can do it takes its full toll
[1:32:35] and then at when it's done all it can do
[1:32:38] when god gave you this life and used at
[1:32:40] your best at about 23 when you come into
[1:32:43] the resurrection you'll come back just
[1:32:45] exactly like he was when he's 23 years
[1:32:46] old 25
[1:32:49] for death set in death will have
[1:32:50] everything that it can do it's set in
[1:32:52] there but you'll come right back where
[1:32:54] you were
[1:32:56] now if each one of your your
[1:32:59] cells in your body let's take it down
[1:33:01] now you come sell after sell sell after
[1:33:04] selling lay it apart you're on a
[1:33:05] platform
[1:33:07] after each cell in your body you'll come
[1:33:09] down to one little tiny germ
[1:33:12] where you begin
[1:33:14] can be seen with a natural eye
[1:33:17] you have to look under scope glasses
[1:33:18] i've seen the germ of life under a
[1:33:20] microscope it looks like a little bitty
[1:33:23] thread
[1:33:24] and the first thing starts is right in
[1:33:25] the spine
[1:33:27] it's like a little knot
[1:33:29] that's the first little cell accumulates
[1:33:31] on top of a cell
[1:33:34] now if i had to take that one single
[1:33:36] little cell that every one of you come
[1:33:37] from one little teeny cell
[1:33:40] germ
[1:33:41] what is a germ
[1:33:43] a germ is a little teeny the smallest of
[1:33:46] cell
[1:33:48] well what's after that now i've talked
[1:33:50] you down from every piece of you down to
[1:33:52] this one little cell
[1:33:54] and i haven't found you yet
[1:33:56] i've just got your cells laid out
[1:33:59] well then next thing blood cells and
[1:34:01] flesh cells and whatever they are laying
[1:34:02] them all out here but i haven't got you
[1:34:04] yet now i'm down to one germ now
[1:34:07] well i'm going to take that little cell
[1:34:08] apart
[1:34:09] now where you at
[1:34:12] your life
[1:34:14] and the life makes the first cell which
[1:34:17] is a germ then everything after its
[1:34:19] nature dog after dog bird after bird
[1:34:21] manager man develop and sell sell on
[1:34:24] sell sell on cell comes up to where you
[1:34:26] are
[1:34:27] human being
[1:34:29] developing of cells
[1:34:31] now that was ordained of god to be so
[1:34:33] but now what about a cancer
[1:34:35] let's talk of him a little bit
[1:34:38] now god gave you your life
[1:34:40] and say here you are today here i am
[1:34:42] there's
[1:34:42] there's nothing on my hand
[1:34:44] but there might be a cancer on my hand
[1:34:46] sometimes
[1:34:48] well how's that cancer get there let's
[1:34:50] see what the cancer is now let's take
[1:34:51] him apart
[1:34:53] let's go take him now he's a bunch of
[1:34:55] cells too
[1:34:57] did you know that
[1:34:58] tumor cataract any of those things are
[1:35:00] cells
[1:35:01] they don't have no form some of them
[1:35:03] spreads out and some looks like a spider
[1:35:05] and some looks run streaks a red cancer
[1:35:08] just like long
[1:35:09] red threads that runs through and then
[1:35:12] these are rolls cancer which usually
[1:35:13] comes on of the breasts of a woman it's
[1:35:15] like pancakes laying on one another and
[1:35:17] then he go scrabbling out they just grow
[1:35:19] anywhere
[1:35:21] sometimes tumors are lopsided this way
[1:35:23] long oblong and everything they have no
[1:35:26] form because they're after a spirit
[1:35:30] which has no form
[1:35:32] but it's the developing of cells
[1:35:36] it's a bunch of cells that say in you
[1:35:38] right now is a tumor or cancer
[1:35:41] this developing cells growing
[1:35:43] growing growing it's eating
[1:35:46] sucking your life from you
[1:35:48] living on the bloodstream
[1:35:50] cataract takes the mucus of the eye and
[1:35:52] grows right over covers yourself over
[1:35:54] shut your eyes off
[1:35:58] some of them comes and never gets like
[1:36:00] two burglar that comes just in little
[1:36:01] small germs
[1:36:03] there's nothing to the size of it the
[1:36:04] same size germ makes an elephant makes a
[1:36:06] a
[1:36:08] nothing nothing's the size of the germ
[1:36:10] and some of them takes body form some
[1:36:12] never does and some never goes into
[1:36:13] cells some becomes spirit torments the
[1:36:15] soul
[1:36:17] we'll try to get that party i'll leave
[1:36:19] that part for tomorrow afternoon if i
[1:36:20] can or that soul spirit comes and how
[1:36:23] down already hearing now friends i'm not
[1:36:26] telling this from some kind of a
[1:36:27] psychological i have dealt with demons
[1:36:29] for years and you know that
[1:36:31] if you only knew the thing after the
[1:36:33] services is over at night
[1:36:35] what goes on sometimes
[1:36:37] you don't know remember when you come
[1:36:39] against the spirit you better know what
[1:36:41] you're speaking about
[1:36:44] just don't stand there and carry on
[1:36:46] because it ain't going to do any good
[1:36:48] but when actually a demon has to obey
[1:36:50] you
[1:36:51] you'll recognize it it ain't how loud
[1:36:52] you holler
[1:36:54] it ain't how much oral you put on it's
[1:36:56] what's back here that he'll recognize
[1:36:58] it's the truth
[1:37:00] jesus just said to him come out
[1:37:04] remember the disciples have been kicking
[1:37:05] and twisting and trying to cast him out
[1:37:07] and everything
[1:37:09] he said why couldn't we cast and i said
[1:37:10] because of your unbelief
[1:37:13] said come out of him the boy fell and
[1:37:15] had the hardest city ever had
[1:37:19] they recognize authority
[1:37:22] look at those boys down those vagabonds
[1:37:24] who seen paul casting out devils they
[1:37:26] said we can do the same thing some
[1:37:28] priest sons
[1:37:29] so they ground said we can cast out
[1:37:31] devils acts 19 they went down to a man
[1:37:33] who had epileptic fits and said we
[1:37:35] adjure you by jesus come out of him the
[1:37:37] devil said now in the name of jesus who
[1:37:39] paul preaches the devil said now i know
[1:37:41] jesus and i know paul but who are you
[1:37:45] you know what happened
[1:37:47] jumped on the man tore their clothes and
[1:37:49] they had to fix himself
[1:37:51] run out into the streets
[1:37:53] them same demons live today
[1:37:57] so there is a lot of fanaticism this is
[1:37:59] a church this evening there's a lot of
[1:38:01] fanaticism in the lands that they call
[1:38:02] divine healing that ought to be shut up
[1:38:07] that's what brings reproach upon the
[1:38:08] real cause
[1:38:11] that's why you have such a hard struggle
[1:38:13] there's a lot of stuff called religion
[1:38:14] today that ought to be shut up
[1:38:19] nothing to cults that's what makes the
[1:38:21] true church of god have such a hard
[1:38:23] struggle with it
[1:38:25] but we're america
[1:38:27] that's the way to be
[1:38:29] god says the wheat and creepers and bars
[1:38:32] grow together don't try to pluck them up
[1:38:34] let them grow together but by their
[1:38:36] fruits you know them
[1:38:38] there's no fruits while there's no life
[1:38:40] there's nothing there
[1:38:42] now watch this cell let's say for
[1:38:44] instance like a lot of time a red cancer
[1:38:47] usually hits in the womb of a woman
[1:38:48] female with bruises and so forth
[1:38:51] now that let's take that that fellow
[1:38:54] down now on his cells this is cancer
[1:38:57] now cancer everything in the natural
[1:39:00] types the spiritual
[1:39:02] are you aware of that
[1:39:04] everything in the natural types of
[1:39:05] spiritual regardless
[1:39:08] for instance like this when
[1:39:10] when we're born in the body of christ
[1:39:13] there's three elements it takes to bring
[1:39:14] our birth
[1:39:16] and that's the three elements that came
[1:39:17] out of the life of christ when he died
[1:39:20] there come from his body
[1:39:22] water
[1:39:23] blood
[1:39:24] spirit is that right
[1:39:26] three elements that's the elements we go
[1:39:28] through when we're born again
[1:39:30] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:39:33] the holy spirit
[1:39:34] now that can all be in one act but it
[1:39:36] takes but you can be in a justified
[1:39:38] state without being sanctified you can
[1:39:40] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[1:39:42] still carry your filth with you
[1:39:44] but you can absolutely live in a both
[1:39:46] justified and a clean holy life and
[1:39:48] without the holy ghost
[1:39:51] see the bible 1st john
[1:39:53] 5 7 said there are three that bear
[1:39:55] record heaven the father son and holy
[1:39:56] ghost and the father word and holy ghost
[1:39:58] which was the son and these three are
[1:40:00] one
[1:40:02] and there's three the bear wrecker on
[1:40:04] earth the water blood and spirit and
[1:40:05] they agree in one not one but agreeing
[1:40:08] one you can't have the father without
[1:40:09] having the son
[1:40:11] you can't have the son without having
[1:40:13] the holy ghost
[1:40:14] for they are inseparable one the trinity
[1:40:17] is in a one
[1:40:19] i don't hear it around here but you hear
[1:40:21] a lot across the country one of the
[1:40:23] greatest things in the pentecostal
[1:40:24] groups is a mix-up and that one simple
[1:40:27] thing and i've had their heads right
[1:40:29] together and prove to them they both
[1:40:30] believe the same thing
[1:40:32] it's the devil between them that's all
[1:40:35] if that great pentecostal church would
[1:40:37] you throw down them the little
[1:40:38] traditions and unite themselves together
[1:40:40] as one blessed church of god the rapture
[1:40:42] would come
[1:40:44] but as long as satan can keep him broke
[1:40:45] up all right that's of his way of doing
[1:40:48] it
[1:40:48] and they absolutely believe the same
[1:40:50] thing
[1:40:51] one said well this is that i said if
[1:40:53] this is that then that's this so there
[1:40:55] you are so
[1:40:57] it's all the same thing but there you
[1:40:59] are in that uh triune trinity of god now
[1:41:03] now the god
[1:41:04] in his ones
[1:41:06] god the father son and holy spirit now
[1:41:09] we don't say our gods
[1:41:12] as heathens it's our god
[1:41:14] see
[1:41:15] it's the threefold being of god
[1:41:17] now notice
[1:41:20] now satan is in a trinity also
[1:41:23] and his powers are in trinity
[1:41:25] now but notice then when the
[1:41:28] water blood and spirit
[1:41:30] produces the new birth is that right
[1:41:32] now watch that's what represents the new
[1:41:35] birth what represents the natural birth
[1:41:37] before the new birth come why don't you
[1:41:39] mothers
[1:41:40] when a baby's born what's the first
[1:41:42] thing
[1:41:43] water
[1:41:44] next blood
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:47] next see that makes the life see
[1:41:50] makes the person
[1:41:52] water blood spirit now cancer let's deal
[1:41:55] on him for our next we've got about five
[1:41:56] minutes left i guess about the next five
[1:41:59] minutes let's deal on cancer what is
[1:42:01] that fellow what does he represent he's
[1:42:02] a scavenger
[1:42:04] he represents the vulture
[1:42:07] eats dead things
[1:42:09] and a cancer comes from a bruise mostly
[1:42:12] where a cell has been hit and it it
[1:42:15] breaks up
[1:42:16] and a little cell in there becomes
[1:42:17] backslid well that's a big word for a
[1:42:20] bat just ain't it
[1:42:21] all right
[1:42:23] but
[1:42:23] it backslides that cell
[1:42:26] i'm a baptist believes in backsliding
[1:42:29] someone said down here arkansas means
[1:42:31] they said brother branham said is a
[1:42:33] fellow nazarene had been healed he had
[1:42:35] walked right over town with his crutches
[1:42:36] on his shoulders he said you know what
[1:42:38] said when i first come here said i
[1:42:40] thought you heard you preach i thought
[1:42:42] you was a nazarene
[1:42:43] he said then i've seen the most people
[1:42:45] of pentecostal and somebody told me
[1:42:46] you're a pentecostal now you say you're
[1:42:48] a baptist said i don't get it outside
[1:42:50] that's easy i said i'm a
[1:42:52] pentecostal nazarene baptist
[1:42:55] that's
[1:42:56] all right
[1:42:57] no
[1:42:58] we are one in christ jesus by the holy
[1:43:01] spirit making us one
[1:43:03] that's right now
[1:43:04] [Music]
[1:43:05] notice this little cell backslide
[1:43:09] when it's bruised
[1:43:10] it begins little other little uh germs
[1:43:13] run forth to give its lives in there and
[1:43:14] that's what pus comes in a sore that's
[1:43:17] teeny little soldiers fighting for your
[1:43:19] life
[1:43:20] they're out there and to hit that poison
[1:43:22] them demon powers that's kind of trying
[1:43:24] to collect in there and give their lives
[1:43:27] that's what's made that's a bunch of
[1:43:28] little dead soldiers that pus that's in
[1:43:30] your blood in a sore
[1:43:32] a give their life to save yours
[1:43:35] now
[1:43:36] once a little cell rejects in there and
[1:43:39] this
[1:43:40] demon gets started he starts growing
[1:43:43] he begins to multiply cells
[1:43:45] he's building a body just exactly like
[1:43:48] your babies begin in your womb and like
[1:43:50] you did in your mother sell on top of
[1:43:52] sell sell on top of sales sell any way
[1:43:55] anywhere just they have no form of
[1:43:58] nothing like a human being after it's
[1:43:59] nature it's just out of a spirit it just
[1:44:01] scrolls anyway
[1:44:03] and it begins cell on top of cell cell
[1:44:05] on top of cell
[1:44:06] and now first thing you know you begin
[1:44:08] to get weak and feel sick you go with
[1:44:11] the doctor and he'll examine you maybe
[1:44:13] he can't find it if he does maybe he'll
[1:44:14] cut it if he can cut it clear
[1:44:17] all right he's got it but if he can't
[1:44:19] cut it clear then if it's in the throat
[1:44:21] or somewhere where it can't be cut clear
[1:44:23] one little speck of it will live right
[1:44:25] on
[1:44:28] because it has not like you cut your
[1:44:29] hand off and settle it or anything or
[1:44:31] you cut all uh what i mean if you'd cut
[1:44:34] the main body off leave your hand there
[1:44:35] why it wouldn't live but but see that
[1:44:38] has not the form of life like you have
[1:44:40] it's a demon power a moving
[1:44:43] and now notice
[1:44:46] you call them the doctor calls it a
[1:44:49] cancer
[1:44:50] god calls it a devil
[1:44:54] look at the day they just give it where
[1:44:56] does the word cancer come from
[1:44:58] it comes from the from a latin word
[1:45:01] which is used in medical terms meaning a
[1:45:03] crab
[1:45:04] a crab that you see along with seashore
[1:45:06] has got all them blades that's the way
[1:45:08] that that it does it reaches out
[1:45:10] spreads out
[1:45:12] the word cancer
[1:45:13] is crab
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:15] and it gets in and just keeps taking the
[1:45:17] whole sucking blood as it goes like an
[1:45:18] octopus or something
[1:45:20] well a tumor cataract and other diseases
[1:45:23] every one of them comes from a germ
[1:45:27] and that germ has to be a body
[1:45:31] and before it can be a body it has to be
[1:45:34] a life before it can create or dermatize
[1:45:36] and make more cells it has to be a lie
[1:45:39] is that correct
[1:45:41] now where did that cancer come from who
[1:45:42] where'd that come from it wasn't only
[1:45:44] here some time ago
[1:45:46] but now maybe it's on you
[1:45:48] where did it come from it's another life
[1:45:51] different from your life living in you
[1:45:55] and it's a tormenting
[1:45:58] your life that's reason jesus called it
[1:46:00] a devil
[1:46:01] they call epilepsy today they say
[1:46:03] epilepsy well epilepsy in the bible
[1:46:06] jesus called it a devil
[1:46:08] when the man come with the boy it fell
[1:46:09] on the ground and frosted the mouth and
[1:46:11] everything he said he has the devil and
[1:46:13] all the time he throws them in the fire
[1:46:14] in the water
[1:46:15] now they polished his name up and called
[1:46:17] it epilepsy but he's the devil
[1:46:22] and jesus said thou devil come out of
[1:46:24] the child
[1:46:27] exactly
[1:46:28] now epilepsy is usually causing a kidney
[1:46:30] trouble maybe get into that a little
[1:46:32] later see it causes an epilepsy from
[1:46:36] your enemy now
[1:46:38] noticing this then that cell sets there
[1:46:41] it's a devil he's building a life he's
[1:46:44] growing becoming greater and greater
[1:46:46] he's got one duty to do let's take your
[1:46:49] life
[1:46:51] that's what the devil standing for to
[1:46:53] cut your day shorter three score and ten
[1:46:57] now i salute every doctor
[1:47:00] yes sir every medical science god bless
[1:47:02] them for the help that they've done for
[1:47:04] people
[1:47:05] that's correctly what would you do in
[1:47:07] the world today without us
[1:47:10] i thank god for medical science i thank
[1:47:12] god for my automobile
[1:47:13] if god had let science make me an
[1:47:15] automobile i'd have a hard time walking
[1:47:17] up here
[1:47:19] for electric lights and for soap to wash
[1:47:21] my hands with and toothpaste to scrub my
[1:47:23] teeth with
[1:47:25] certainly i thank him for everything
[1:47:27] because all good things come from god
[1:47:31] but let me tell you there's not one
[1:47:33] speck of medicine ever did cure any
[1:47:36] sickness
[1:47:37] and there's not one doctor
[1:47:39] now let's do some quack
[1:47:41] but a real doctor will tell you that
[1:47:43] they do not claim to be healers
[1:47:46] right at mayo brothers many of you i've
[1:47:48] been interviewed there two or three
[1:47:49] times
[1:47:50] of patients that come from their
[1:47:52] incurable you read the reader's digest
[1:47:54] the november issue how many november
[1:47:56] issue that article of mine in their own
[1:47:57] reader's digest
[1:47:59] see
[1:48:00] and they had me up there in the
[1:48:01] interview that baby they give up said it
[1:48:03] couldn't be done
[1:48:06] but the holy spirit spoke to me and told
[1:48:07] me how it would be done and it was done
[1:48:11] all right now they call me up there and
[1:48:13] right before the door where jimmy and
[1:48:15] mayo used to be there's a great big sign
[1:48:17] that we do not profess to be healers
[1:48:20] we only profess to assist nature there's
[1:48:23] one healer that is god
[1:48:26] they're the best in the world
[1:48:30] now we have a few quacks yes
[1:48:34] that's right we have some quack
[1:48:35] preachers too
[1:48:36] all right so that goes on both sides
[1:48:40] notice but any man that claims that he's
[1:48:42] a healer
[1:48:43] he's a storyteller
[1:48:45] because he can't do it for the bible
[1:48:47] said i'm the lord who forgives all your
[1:48:49] sins and heals all your diseases
[1:48:54] i've been to studies and in my room the
[1:48:56] some of the best of doctors across the
[1:48:57] nations has come you don't know the back
[1:48:59] of the life friend to know what's been
[1:49:01] and things i don't tell out in public
[1:49:03] men come secretly
[1:49:05] don't you think there ain't a lot of
[1:49:06] nicodemus is yet in the world
[1:49:08] there sure is thousands of them they
[1:49:10] look on that come in the meeting sit
[1:49:12] there with a t-shirt on something like
[1:49:13] that with polish names that you'd be
[1:49:15] surprised set right in the meeting in a
[1:49:17] few days slip around calling by secretly
[1:49:19] and send someone in for an interview and
[1:49:21] say right now i said brother branham i
[1:49:23] believe that's the truth
[1:49:26] they're human the same as we are
[1:49:29] sure in every man's desire to look
[1:49:31] beyond that dark valentine has to go
[1:49:33] through someday
[1:49:35] but them cancers and
[1:49:37] things are absolutely devils informed in
[1:49:40] a body of flesh moving up taking your
[1:49:43] life now if i would do like the doctor
[1:49:47] if i could cut it off lay it on the
[1:49:49] ground or just like say for instance you
[1:49:51] was the cancer yourself on this earth
[1:49:53] now here's divine healing if i want to
[1:49:56] get rid of you in the way of the
[1:49:57] doctor's way i just keep have to rub
[1:49:59] your body or something to it just all
[1:50:01] banished off the earth there wouldn't be
[1:50:03] any more of it just like the doctor
[1:50:04] takes the growth off of you
[1:50:07] but in the form of divine healing if you
[1:50:09] was a cancer i'd just call your life out
[1:50:12] of you
[1:50:13] and you'd go on
[1:50:16] your life would leave you but your body
[1:50:18] would be here just the same as it was
[1:50:20] now there's where sight and time is
[1:50:22] god's worst enemy in divine healing
[1:50:25] i don't know whether brother baxter ever
[1:50:26] gets to these things in the meeting i
[1:50:28] said explained it to him and brother
[1:50:30] bosworth over and over but here's what's
[1:50:32] happened
[1:50:34] i doubt we're a man of people get it
[1:50:36] because after a while you begin to find
[1:50:38] the people coming back saying i had my
[1:50:39] healing brother branham for two or three
[1:50:41] days but blessed
[1:50:43] it left me i find it i think it's
[1:50:45] because it don't set the meeting right
[1:50:48] the people don't understand
[1:50:50] i've had man to come to the platform
[1:50:53] and be totally blind cancers are
[1:50:55] cataracts or their eyes
[1:50:57] and read this bible as you're being
[1:50:59] prayed for
[1:51:00] walk down in three or four days be just
[1:51:02] as blind as it was in the first place
[1:51:04] what happened
[1:51:06] anyone knows
[1:51:08] that when the life is gone out of
[1:51:11] any flesh it shrinks for a while is that
[1:51:14] right
[1:51:15] anybody ever kill a deer or cow or
[1:51:17] anything like that sure all right you
[1:51:20] wear tonight you hunters i hear friends
[1:51:22] of mine you kill the deer and you throw
[1:51:24] them on the scale tell the boys how much
[1:51:25] he weighs watch out
[1:51:28] in the morning he's going to be several
[1:51:29] pounds lighter than what he was
[1:51:31] when a human being dies the undertaker
[1:51:33] the first thing takes a false teeth or
[1:51:35] an eye whatever it is in there takes it
[1:51:37] out because it shrinks in a push-out
[1:51:41] because the human body shrinks
[1:51:44] every other flesh shrinks when the
[1:51:45] life's gone out of the cell it begins to
[1:51:48] move down strength it'll do that for
[1:51:50] about 72 hours
[1:51:52] and then it'll start swelling let a
[1:51:54] little dog get run over right here on
[1:51:56] the road let him lay down her son for
[1:51:57] about three days and watch what happens
[1:51:59] he's a bigger dog than he ever was it
[1:52:01] swells up
[1:52:03] is that right
[1:52:04] well that's the same thing takes place
[1:52:06] when a a demon is cast out of a sick
[1:52:09] person
[1:52:10] the first few days oh i feel wonderful
[1:52:13] then begin to say i'm i'm sicker than a
[1:52:16] than i ever was i've lost my healing
[1:52:19] just as sure as faith tuck it out
[1:52:21] unbelief brings it right back again
[1:52:26] as faith kills it unbelief resurrection
[1:52:30] jesus said when the unclean spirit's
[1:52:31] gone out of a man he walks in dry places
[1:52:34] and he returns back with seven other
[1:52:35] devils
[1:52:37] and if the good man of the house isn't
[1:52:38] standing there to protect that door
[1:52:40] he'll come right on in
[1:52:42] and the good man of your house is your
[1:52:44] faith
[1:52:45] say stay away
[1:52:48] that's it
[1:52:49] but now you watch the patience here with
[1:52:51] no ordinarily this is a outstanding
[1:52:53] miracle which divine healing in america
[1:52:55] is two different things divine healing
[1:52:57] one thing a miracle is another thing
[1:52:59] but an ordinary run of divine healing
[1:53:01] when the unclean spirits cast out a
[1:53:03] cancer devil
[1:53:05] where it leaves the person oh
[1:53:07] uh or say we'll take something so you
[1:53:09] see more visible i'll say the cataract
[1:53:11] what happened with that man if you'll
[1:53:13] notice a blind person i don't know where
[1:53:15] they've ever had in here or not yet
[1:53:16] cataract eyes i'll let them stand for a
[1:53:19] few minutes why
[1:53:21] so that shrinkage begins to take place
[1:53:24] tell them come back
[1:53:25] give us a testimony oh my they can see
[1:53:27] wonderful oh my just i can see things
[1:53:30] yes i what's the matter life is gone
[1:53:33] the body of the cataract is shrinking
[1:53:36] well it'll do that way for a couple days
[1:53:38] oh i'm getting so well naturally begin
[1:53:40] to get a headache
[1:53:43] don't feel so good get up the next
[1:53:45] morning
[1:53:46] i'm losing my sight again someone said
[1:53:48] uh-huh you just worked up that bunch of
[1:53:49] holy rollers got you worked up don't you
[1:53:52] believe that
[1:53:53] that's a lie that evil
[1:53:55] if you believe that you go right back
[1:53:57] blind again
[1:53:59] but if you just hold on say no lord i
[1:54:02] believe
[1:54:04] then what happens that body swells for
[1:54:07] so long it covers over that side again
[1:54:09] that cancer in the body will swell
[1:54:12] you'll become hurting and aching again
[1:54:14] then you'll get horribly sick
[1:54:17] terribly safe
[1:54:18] wow that big growth of dead flesh in you
[1:54:21] is laying there dead you go back to the
[1:54:23] doctor and you say oh that's nonsense
[1:54:26] there's a cancer right there i can see
[1:54:27] it
[1:54:28] sure it's there but it's dead
[1:54:31] hallelujah
[1:54:33] now the bloodstream has to purify the
[1:54:35] body
[1:54:36] every time the heart pumps it throws the
[1:54:38] blood around the body
[1:54:40] and it picks up that infection
[1:54:42] sure it'll make you sick what if you had
[1:54:44] a chunk of meat hanging in you somewhere
[1:54:46] or long as a snake or something big
[1:54:48] around your finger and hanging in there
[1:54:50] and it was dead that much
[1:54:52] dead meat hanging in you
[1:54:54] and it's rotten
[1:54:57] well of course your bloodstream has to
[1:54:58] keep that pure as it pumps through but
[1:55:00] there's the dead body the thing hanging
[1:55:02] there because the life
[1:55:04] is gone from him
[1:55:07] the power of god through faith drove it
[1:55:09] out
[1:55:11] he's a demon he has to leave
[1:55:13] but the reason the people is not
[1:55:14] instructed they go away and give up and
[1:55:16] that same devil standing right there to
[1:55:17] take over again
[1:55:19] when god tells you anything on this
[1:55:21] platform through his spirit when he's
[1:55:23] under inspiration
[1:55:25] don't you doubt that
[1:55:27] our worst thing will come upon you he
[1:55:28] said
[1:55:29] for jesus said the lies the state of
[1:55:31] that man was seven times worse than it
[1:55:33] was in the first place is that right
[1:55:35] when the unclean spirit went out of a
[1:55:36] man he walked around and died places
[1:55:38] come back with seven other devils
[1:55:41] so don't you disbelieve stay right with
[1:55:43] us
[1:55:45] need it from your heart
[1:55:47] say no sir i'll not be moved
[1:55:49] no matter how sick i get that i don't
[1:55:51] have nothing to do with it
[1:55:53] now the first thing you know you'll be
[1:55:55] getting cleared up everything will be
[1:55:57] all right then
[1:55:58] see it's dead
[1:56:00] the operation that the doctor would have
[1:56:02] taken from you that same growth is
[1:56:04] laying in you with no life in it you say
[1:56:07] life in it brother brandon want to take
[1:56:08] my life no sir that life is a separate
[1:56:10] life from yours
[1:56:12] i've just showed you that you are alive
[1:56:13] and become a being and it's a life and
[1:56:15] becomes a being
[1:56:17] and you're of god and it's of the devil
[1:56:21] you see what i mean
[1:56:23] demonology
[1:56:25] now you ought to see what that thing
[1:56:26] looks like when you stand and look at it
[1:56:29] oh my i'm sorry it's almost 3 30.
[1:56:32] i'm sorry
[1:56:34] look friends
[1:56:36] oh what this world needs
[1:56:39] i've been about seven years teaching
[1:56:42] across america having these healing
[1:56:44] services i just got a good notion
[1:56:46] starting back across the country
[1:56:47] teaching the bible and on demonology how
[1:56:50] the people can understand what to do and
[1:56:52] that's the reason they go to these
[1:56:54] meetings a lot of times and fellows if
[1:56:55] you don't understand the people come out
[1:56:57] and many times now remember that fellow
[1:56:59] that come and said he had a gift of
[1:57:01] divine healing
[1:57:02] the gift of divine healing was in you if
[1:57:04] you got healed
[1:57:06] it's you the one any gift operates by
[1:57:09] faith and no matter how much to get the
[1:57:11] divine healing i got
[1:57:14] i believe it was all my heart but you
[1:57:16] could stand here and if you haven't got
[1:57:18] the same kind of faith it don't do you
[1:57:19] no good i can pray for you for hours and
[1:57:21] weeks and months
[1:57:23] it isn't the preachers with the divine
[1:57:25] healing it's you that's got the gift of
[1:57:27] divine healing
[1:57:28] that believes in being healed because
[1:57:30] it's by faith by faith every operation
[1:57:33] of god is by faith
[1:57:35] the whole armor of god's by faith we
[1:57:37] haven't got one natural thing of this
[1:57:39] world
[1:57:40] everything of the
[1:57:41] christian church is a faith act
[1:57:44] look at the armor of god love joy peace
[1:57:46] strong suffering goodness speaking is
[1:57:48] gentlest patience
[1:57:50] is that right everything's supernatural
[1:57:52] nothing natural
[1:57:54] so we don't look at the things natural
[1:57:56] because we're operating supernatural
[1:57:59] and the only way we can base it is faith
[1:58:01] is on what god said was the truth and we
[1:58:03] look at the unseen
[1:58:04] and we call those things which are not
[1:58:07] as though they were like abraham did
[1:58:09] when god amen
[1:58:13] abraham called those things which was
[1:58:15] not like god did as though they were
[1:58:18] being 100 years old staggered not the
[1:58:20] promise of god through unbelief
[1:58:23] i can just imagine that couldn't you
[1:58:25] see sarah get up on the morning god said
[1:58:27] abraham to abraham you go to have the
[1:58:29] baby
[1:58:31] sarah god said how you feeling sarah
[1:58:33] this is a mixed multitude but listen
[1:58:36] no different well glory to god we're
[1:58:38] going to have it
[1:58:40] go get the bird on the pins and
[1:58:41] everything get ready
[1:58:43] all right
[1:58:44] another must pass sarah how you feeling
[1:58:46] no different
[1:58:48] year passed sarah what about it no
[1:58:50] different
[1:58:51] ten years fast no different 25 years
[1:58:54] fast no different
[1:58:56] abraham instead of getting weak he got
[1:58:58] stronger stronger you know it's going to
[1:59:00] be more of a miracle all the time
[1:59:02] because he believed god and he staggered
[1:59:05] not as it taught us of god through
[1:59:06] unbelief
[1:59:08] he said we're going to have it
[1:59:10] one morning the womb of sarah began to
[1:59:12] swell and little isaac was born because
[1:59:14] abraham believed god
[1:59:16] and he looked at the things that carried
[1:59:18] those things that was not as though as
[1:59:20] they were not by feelings not besides
[1:59:23] you don't walk by feelings or science by
[1:59:25] faith
[1:59:26] and when god is pronouncing things that
[1:59:28] whatever things you ask when you pray
[1:59:29] believe you receive it then hold on to
[1:59:31] it
[1:59:32] god said so it's got to be so
[1:59:35] amen demons
[1:59:37] faith in the father
[1:59:39] faith in the son
[1:59:41] faith in the holy ghost three in the one
[1:59:45] demons will tremble and sinners awake
[1:59:49] faith in jehovah will anything shake
[1:59:52] that's right
[1:59:53] oh my god sir it is
[1:59:56] have faith in god
[1:59:59] look to him don't you move stay right
[2:00:02] there
[2:00:03] god said so
[2:00:04] demons
[2:00:06] what are they they're spiritual beings
[2:00:09] now the the doctor says you got cancer
[2:00:12] you got tv you got cataracts you got
[2:00:14] percy you got this it's a devil
[2:00:17] amen
[2:00:19] it's a life
[2:00:21] and behind that life is the spirit
[2:00:23] how many knows and can see that a cancer
[2:00:27] cataract is god it's a god it's a spirit
[2:00:29] a god got life in it
[2:00:31] well nothing can have life without
[2:00:33] spirit
[2:00:34] so there has to be a life to operate
[2:00:35] that somewhere even that tree there has
[2:00:37] life in it
[2:00:40] all the science in the world couldn't
[2:00:41] make one blade of grass did you know
[2:00:43] that
[2:00:43] they make something looks like it but
[2:00:45] they can't find the formula of life
[2:00:48] that's god's
[2:00:49] see jesus said to the tree curse it be
[2:00:52] you
[2:00:53] you don't have any fruit you'll never
[2:00:55] have any
[2:00:56] the pass back by those about eight
[2:00:57] o'clock at morning pass back about
[2:00:58] eleven o'clock and just going to dinner
[2:01:01] peter said look at that tree it's dead
[2:01:02] from the roots up
[2:01:04] why jesus rebuked the life that was in
[2:01:06] that tree that was in the roots and the
[2:01:08] whole thing died
[2:01:10] hallelujah
[2:01:12] that same christ can rebuke a cancer
[2:01:14] from the roots and the whole thing alive
[2:01:17] that tree was standing there just the
[2:01:18] same as it was hours before but she
[2:01:20] finally the leaves begin to drop off
[2:01:23] and then see the bark began to peel off
[2:01:25] and the
[2:01:26] begin to wear away day after day and
[2:01:29] week after week and after a while there
[2:01:30] wasn't even one speck of that tree left
[2:01:33] hallelujah
[2:01:34] cancer tumor cataract or anything else
[2:01:36] will have to go when christ speaks
[2:01:39] he cast out devils he said in my name
[2:01:42] they shall cast out devils
[2:01:45] speak with new tongues take up serpents

[2:06:28] amen
[2:06:29] brother
[2:06:31] this go back again by faith
[2:06:35] again abel abel he had a more
[2:06:38] more excellent faith than
[2:06:41] cain
[2:06:42] brothers somewhere abel was more in a in
[2:06:45] a personal fellowship with god than cain
[2:06:47] was cain was religious
[2:06:49] but abel was spiritual
[2:06:53] and i trust by grace that we're not
[2:06:54] religious but spiritual and there's too
[2:06:57] many too many so-called christians today
[2:06:59] just religious religious religious they
[2:07:01] go to church go to church and yes
[2:07:04] sometimes as i've said even even around
[2:07:05] what we call the message
[2:07:08] a lot of them are religious
[2:07:10] but how many are really spiritual
[2:07:12] well
[2:07:14] can you give me a scripture to prove
[2:07:15] there's going to be very few
[2:07:17] straight is the gate narrow's the way
[2:07:19] and few there be that find it amen and
[2:07:22] when it comes to the coming of the lord
[2:07:24] there's going to be so few
[2:07:27] living saints
[2:07:28] most of them are gone on there's going
[2:07:30] to be there's going to be many when it
[2:07:31] comes to the resurrection and the
[2:07:33] rapture and our are entered into our
[2:07:35] union with christ in another dimension
[2:07:37] but most of them are gone on the dead in
[2:07:39] christ shall rise first
[2:07:42] amen
[2:07:43] they're going on and they're waiting on
[2:07:45] us
[2:07:46] but i tell you the ones that are going
[2:07:48] to be alive and cut away well
[2:07:52] because so few they won't know you're
[2:07:54] gone
[2:07:55] there'll be somebody here somebody there
[2:07:57] will wonder where you are
[2:07:59] you know and that's all but for the
[2:08:02] world in general we won't be among the
[2:08:04] missing ones
[2:08:05] yeah
[2:08:06] oya as far as as far as god's concerned
[2:08:09] we will be missing out of this earth but
[2:08:11] we're going to be with him
[2:08:13] in another dimension by the grace of god
[2:08:16] but the world won't miss us
[2:08:18] because it may be a family something
[2:08:20] that they might oh where did this
[2:08:22] brother go where did he go where did she
[2:08:23] go oh i believe
[2:08:26] only i believe that they were testifying
[2:08:28] of a resurrection they were talking
[2:08:30] about a rapture when they were here in
[2:08:32] their testimony
[2:08:34] i wonder oh yeah there might be family
[2:08:36] members or friends that that knew what
[2:08:38] we were standing for they might think
[2:08:40] about it and say oh well
[2:08:43] do you think they're gone in the right
[2:08:44] rapture do you think they were
[2:08:46] gone in the resurrection
[2:08:49] oh yeah and and well how will they know
[2:08:52] just just because we're missing
[2:08:54] well some people think as i said i saw a
[2:08:57] picture one time
[2:08:58] and i don't think i i did have a book
[2:09:00] with it in a religious book and
[2:09:02] and i don't know what i did with the
[2:09:04] book and where it is now
[2:09:05] but it's been gone for i
[2:09:07] got rid of it a long long time ago but
[2:09:09] they had that picture
[2:09:11] of the resurrection in in the book a
[2:09:13] painting
[2:09:14] and as i said lord i said it's not like
[2:09:16] that
[2:09:17] why because there they had
[2:09:19] uh
[2:09:20] the senior citizens coming out of the
[2:09:22] graves and going out
[2:09:24] then they had babies coming out of a
[2:09:25] grave going up
[2:09:27] and so on and then there you know the
[2:09:29] regular people coming out of graves and
[2:09:31] going up
[2:09:32] why because there's going to be no
[2:09:34] infant of days neither an old man that
[2:09:36] does not fulfill his days
[2:09:38] amen why because we're going to be young
[2:09:41] amen
[2:09:42] we're going to go into a glorified body
[2:09:45] and i'll tell you this a glorified body
[2:09:46] won't be
[2:09:47] god bless you brother david
[2:09:49] it won't be like brother david here uh
[2:09:52] we wait here
[2:09:54] you know our gray hair yes and our
[2:09:57] brothers mark sister maureen amen oh
[2:10:01] there's two or three warriors like it
[2:10:02] yeah no no we're
[2:10:05] we'll go back as young brothers and
[2:10:06] sisters maybe 20 20
[2:10:08] brother brown did mention 25 years it
[2:10:11] might be around 20 between 20 and then
[2:10:13] 25 years old just going to be young amen
[2:10:16] by the grace of god amen
[2:10:19] so brother we're not going to have the
[2:10:21] gray hair and have the wrinkles and be
[2:10:24] see old age and that brother sister no
[2:10:27] the old will be young there forever
[2:10:30] transformed in a moment of time
[2:10:32] and a mortal will stand in his likeness
[2:10:34] the sun and the stars to outshine by the
[2:10:37] grace of god
[2:10:38] amen so brother sister i trust we have
[2:10:41] that faith
[2:10:42] that we are being changed
[2:10:44] i have been changed and i'm being
[2:10:46] changed
[2:10:47] from time to eternity and
[2:10:50] from
[2:10:51] an old person to a young person
[2:10:53] amen and of course the babies there
[2:10:55] they're going to be
[2:10:57] if if they're predestinated god knows
[2:11:00] the heart
[2:11:01] oh yeah
[2:11:02] oh well if you're a baby they're going
[2:11:03] to be saved no no
[2:11:05] god knows the heart
