keep counting my blessings [Music] and I know that seasons and never last forever oh God I will remember all of the reasons my heart is to be grateful all the times you've been faithful to me God I'm

let's stand and uh we could sing seven nine one and that's more than ever before each and every day we want to love the Lord even more so we get another day closer to the rapture another day closer to being with him forever good just with the angels over in the glory land more than ever before [Music] more than ever before [Music] you more than ever Hallelujah I want to tell you I love you now more than ever before Lord I love you yes Lord amen before Lord I need you yes amen [Music] more than ever before accomplish before Lord I need you more than ever before I've got to tell you I love you now more than ever before Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful or we're thankful for your goodness your blessings Lord and since we recognize that work at Calvary Lord and Lord we made you our savior Lord and we made you our Lord well we've got a bigger reason now to love you than we ever did as we've seen you work in our lives as we've seen you change us Lord as we've seen you lift us up into Heavenly places Lord God as you've drawn us away from the filth and dirt and mire of this world Lord you've changed our Natures you've changed our desires Lord you've brought us subject to your word Lord and we're so thankful this morning that we're on a path Lord to a resurrection and a Rapture they're on a path Lord that brings us into your presence or that unites sword a Heavenly bridegroom with an Earthly bride Lord God that we've got a word Lord that will lead us all the way that we've got a spirit to Quicken it in our hearts and souls Lord and make it live out in these fleshly bodies we have Lord we love you this morning Lord we're just praying Lord that as we read your word as we preached this morning Lord that love would flow that strength would flow Lord that encouragement would flow the correction would flow that alignment would flow Lord whatever we have need of Lord each heart and soul and life Lord we pray that it would be a Fountain of Living Water the this morning Lord that each one could drink from Lord bless your people now we pray Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Matthew chapter 7. Matthew chapter 7 certainly appreciated the special this morning amen it's a good thing to dwell on the blessings of God it's a good thing to dwell on the good things of God Amen it'll give us strength it'll give us encouragement it'll help us see the light at the end of the tunnel and the trials and tribulations that we go through amen it'll keep our minds set on him and it'll give us the right attitude and spirit amen God bless you this morning just wanted to make a quick announcement here you may have noticed at the end of last service brother Josh came up to and I didn't ask him to come up and you'll see that now moving forward the song leaders are going to come up as soon as I'm done praying at the end of a service and if I want to continue to lead to sing then I will but it gives us the opportunity to just transition to them much more easily and and quickly it also means that if you want to come up for prayer then they can automatically just step right into the pulpit and take over the song leading so we're doing that for your sake again sometimes I feel led to just continue to lead the song service rather than turn it over but usually my intention is to turn it over but if I am singing then you don't have to worry about oh I can't go up and ask for prayer or anything like that you come up and the song leader will take over right then and there and I'm I'm happy to pray with you or talk with you or whatever you might need so again we've just done that for the sake of the people and and just to accommodate kind of the way Services go sometimes I mean God bless you Matthew chapter 7. verse 7 says this ask and it shall be given to you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened amen God bless this word you can have your seats this morning amen as you can imagine we started this this little thought on when God answers on Wednesday night and I just want to do a a quick recap of that this morning we had quite a few people not there and so we want to just continue this this morning and Lord willing we'll do it again on Wednesday but we want to take what we said on Wednesday and kind of show what that looks like in real life what that looks like in in practice but I just want to do a quick recap this morning and we open with the scripture Matthew 7. remember when we focused on that thought of asking seeking and knocking are our requirements that's what God asks us to do in the scripture and it's up to him to provide it's up to him to to show us the way it's up to him to open the doors but it's up to us to ask to seek and to knock and we showed how brother Branham said that this is something you do continually it's not just a and you do this in the literal service he didn't say knock is not just this it's not just a one-time knock but he says it's a knock and a continuous knocking he says it shows that you have faith in a God that's going to answer that God's going to open the door amen so we want to remind ourselves of what that purpose of our asking and seeking and knocking is because remember the prophet of God would align us with what the intent is because so often we think well I've got to go in and I've got to ask for what I want that's not what the scripture is about and brother Brandon would say this he would say look at Nicodemus I can't get the next slide if you can help me brother Levi he would say look at Nicodemus coming to him Nicodemus was a scholar coming to a man that had no diploma he was an aristocrat coming to a pauper he was an old teacher coming to the youth he says but see the difference but when he came he came with an open heart seeking the truth he says you come that way so this asking the seeking and this knocking is to find truth it is to find the will of God it's to find the mind of God it's to find the word of God he says now just come the same way with an open heart seeking truth seek and you shall find knock it'll be opened ask and you shall receive he says that's it that's the basis that Jesus said to come on so this idea of prayer is not to drive God but rather it's to find the will of God it's to find the the thoughts of God and the way that God would have to go us to go in a certain situation so it's not to go to God to ask him to change things it's to ask and say Lord what is your will and then when you can find the will then you can pray and you can step right into it so our goal is to say God what about this not God hears this and here's what you need to do Lord what's your thoughts what's your way of doing this what's your thoughts on the matter and what does your word say about this amen we're not seeking affirmation we said you know so often it's easy to go to the word to find the part that agrees with our thought but we've got to take the full word from Genesis to Revelation to get the full mind the full thought of God for a situation brother Bible say this he says but does God hear prayer he hears prayer does God answer prayer yes does he answer real quick not all the time does he know he says sometimes he makes us wait is that right but God answers prayer doesn't he he says and just because everything is going wrong that's no sign that we should quit praying we just pray on anyhow don't we that's right no matter what the circumstances are he answers anyhow amen so we talked about last time how with Abraham and and Sarah how their prayers and their faith could not speed up the plan of God God had a timeline and they weren't delayed because they lacked faith and it didn't come at a certain time because they had Faith but rather their faith was continuous they were in expectation the whole time and when God said it's time to have the child then that's when they had the child but after this last service we took ourselves into the Book of Ezekiel and then Revelation and we looked at the way that God answers prayer and we took it through the four beasts or the four powers that surround The Mercy Seat the Judgment seat the Throne of God and in Revelation 4 it says this and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like under Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and brother Brandon would come behind that and he would show us what those look like in practice because none of these powers in themselves is the full expression of God none of it's the full expression but each one of them together as they go together then they express the way that God works they express the power of the Gospel as we'll see in a moment and it's the way that God responds to Satan's attacks and challenges is through these four beasts these are the ones these are the powers that go forth and he would say this again we're still in a recap here it says in Matthew Mark Luke and John those gospels standing there guarding that and again I I don't have the context here but to give it to you he says it's guarding the Acts of the Apostles it's guarding the acts of the holy spirit it's guarding the Gospel of Jesus Christ they're guarding the Holy Ghost he says and so each of those gospels and you see the way that they approached the the the the Gospel of Jesus Christ each one had a different one and we talked about how Luke is a physician was very very specific and detailed and then John is the prophetic eye and he starts out within the beginning was the word he doesn't go to a natural line he doesn't go to a bloodline of Mary or or Joseph but he goes right back to the word origin and we need everything single one of those gospels and every one of their approaches to see the fullness of the revelation of Christ in that day because John has things that Luke doesn't and Luke has things in Matthew doesn't and Mark has things that none of the other ones do all of them together bring us the full picture of who Jesus was and what that gospel really looks like he says they're guarding that he says it's the wisdom of a man the power of a lion the work of an ox and the swiftness of an eagle and now just before he preaches the Seven Seals you know that was just before that's in the breach and then he comes in now and he's preaching in the fifth seal and this is in his notes the angel has told him what to say this is right from the Throne of God this is the very thoughts of God coming to us and he says we find out in the church ages that those four beasts meaning four powers were gathered around the Acts of the Apostles just the way that the Tabernacle was in the wilderness he says how we drew it out here and showed just exactly they were watching over this he's talking about the lamb the word and what was their purpose he says it's to perform the word just as they did the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in the wilderness and so forth right so these are the anointings that are there to perform the word of God they're there to perform the will of God they're to go out from the Throne of God and remember in Ezekiel it said they would go out and go in and come out like flashes of lightning they go out and do something they come back in and the light and the glory of God was in those anointings as they went out and they were always in response to what Satan was trying to do and it was God's antidote it was God's counterbalance and so we saw last time how that sometimes God Answers by the power of man's Wisdom and that is Supernatural and sometimes God Answers by the raw power of that line anointing and that is absolutely Supernatural and we understand that very easily but then sometimes the answers by way of an ox anointing and it's a sacrifice and it's a surrender and it's a bearing and a carrying of the burden of the gospel and that is Supernatural and that is God's answer to some situations and then sometimes it's the eagle anointing and that just takes us right above the problem the problem stays the problem's still there the problem still exists but he lifts you to a place place where it can't touch you so all four of these are God's expression in the way that God works through the Believers and like we said last time we always want to have the Swift Flight of the eagle and the raw brutal power of the lion that's always what we want to to have when God when we're going to God in situations but the problem is when we do that we miss out on the fullness of the Gospel we miss out on the fullness of the expression of God we miss out on the fullness of the experience of being a true Son of God because all of these help to grow Us in these things remember every single one of these is a victory from God it's a means of overcoming what Satan has placed in our life what Satan's trying to do against us so none is greater than the other if I could put it that way in that they're all a portion of God they're all the way that God does things and again this is what we read last last week he said now that's the only way I've always found it that I can get anything from God is to take him at his word and believe it the way he sends it see we take him at his word but when we prescribe the way it comes then we get into trouble he says no I've got to believe it the way he said it and accept it receive it the way that he sends it he says now if we do not take it just the way we think it is we've built God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways or while it's just no good he didn't answer us at all God answers in many ways he answers in Peculiar ways times and everything is odd he says we'll take for instance Moses Moses was 80 years old he was almost you might think too old for God to deal with he was an old man unexpected in his age to be dealt with God another thing he was under Mount Orab an unexpected Place God made him had an unexpected age at an unexpected place in an unexpected way God didn't meet Moses the way he usually met men he met Moses in an unusual way in the way that he chose to meet Moses in we think it would have been so much more effective to not take him out of Egypt get him early Lord get to him at the start so that they don't have to go through those extra years of of slavery and all these difficulties that he doesn't have to go through it but God chose to do it because he had to get Moses to a place where Moses would listen and obey where Moses recognized who and what he really was he says that's the way he answers our prayer in the way that he thinks is best and remember we said this last service he and his way is always right he says if we ask for anything and it doesn't happen just the way we think God ought to let it happen then that makes us lose and fall back he says let's ask God stand firm on the word say it's true and just receive it the way he sends it that's the way you've got to believe God it may come disguised it may come in another way a roundabout way but no matter what way it comes if we ask we shall receive that's the confidence of the believer is Lord I have asked you I've laid it at your throne of mercy and Grace I've come to you I've let you know that you're my Jehovah Jireh and so I'm trusting you to answer and I'm on the lookout now for the answer I'm not telling you what to do but I'm telling you I believe you're going to do it and that the answer is on the way he says God said so that settles it forever if God says so now when you get to taking God like that and believing it now Moses what if he said I pray for God to make me a military man and here he is in a burning bush he says it don't make any difference how God appeared to him just so long as he appeared can we say that today that as long as he shows up that's what really matters not in the way that I expected but in the way that he determines to be best he says that's all that matters here as long as God comes and answers that's his part that's the supernatural but now catch this as long as we recognize it to be God and that's a supernatural as the coming I was listening to Jehovah Jireh today and brother Brandon would say over and over again he says the people only recognize it after it's done and passed and they miss the blessing they miss the anointing they miss the goodness and the greatness of God because they're so bound with blinders in the way that they want it rather than keep their hearts and eyes and ears open to the way that God would bring it and that's what we're talking about this morning now I just want to take some examples this morning of what this looks like because we can preach on this all day long about these great anointings but what does that look like but before we do I just want to drop this in our lap this is from the message the mighty conqueror because we're talking about when God answers how many are looking for an answer from God how many are praying about things and God hasn't given us the answer yet okay listen to this he's talking about them on the road to Emmaus he says and while they were thinking on him he appeared to them he says and that's the way he usually comes to us when you usually find your greatest blessing you housewise when the children's all gone to school that makes it tough when you're homeschooling doesn't it sisters he says and you're out by yourself washing the dishes or something when you're running the sweeper on the floor or something what when do you men when you're sitting eating your lunch maybe by yourself and reading the Bible on the side somewhere where you're on your road going home in the car and you're meditating on him lunch breaks the time to spend time with the Lord isn't it brother Grant he calls me sometimes when he's eating his meal because his thoughts are on the Lord right we've got to take advantage of these things don't we because what when we think on him then he comes our way it's so simple Church it's so simple we look and we say God I want to hear from you and we don't give them a moment we don't give them a moment to come our way we can't lay things aside for a moment and say Lord I need to hear from you and just lay it all down 15 minutes in the presence of God will change your life the rest of the year but you've got to find that 15 minutes now I'm not saying 50 minutes is going to do it but I'm saying start with what you got don't don't force yourself into this hour hour and a half two hours a day of devotions and prayer time and that you won't make it that way but if you can build it up slow just Build It Up slow start with where you're at say Lord this is what I got will you meet me here we get so busy but in that busyness we've got to find time for him he is the center of our life we've got to find as much time for him as we can amen he says but if we would let the thoughts of our heart and the meditation of our minds be upon him he would appear how often to us often if we would do that he would appear often to us but the trouble is we're thinking this is what we're thinking where we're going to make the next dollar what we're going to do here and how this is going to be what we're trying to figure it out we're trying to make it happen we're trying to say and believe and set a plan this is how it's going to go are we looking for our answer are we looking for God's answer don't try and sort it out we'll twist ourselves around and around and around and it's just a jumble of knots when it's all done and it does you no good he says what we're trying to where we're going to make the next dollar what we're going to do here and how this is going to be Jesus said all these things will be taken care of but seek ye first the kingdom of God what a promise you put God first you seek the things of God and everything will be added unto you such as you have need of I say praise the Lord this morning if I seek him first he answers everything else that I have need of in my life my health my finances my relationship my weight my all of these things God takes care of it if we will only seek him first if you're seeking an answer from God you've got to give him a chance to respond you've got to give him a time you got to give them a place you got to get quiet you got to get quiet how can he speak if I'm stalking all the time prayer is not just a time for me to speak it's a time for me to shut up so that he can speak as well he is the great God he's the Jehovah Jireh he's the all-sufficient one why is the insufficient one talking more than the all-sufficient one God help us to quiet ourselves Amen brother Brown says if we would meditate on him he would appear often often to us he would say this he says and yet Moses after 40 years stood there and in the presence of that bush and that one voice that called him he knew more about God in five minutes after that than all the 80 years of training had taught him it made a different man out of him it'll make a different man and woman out of you if you'll just stand long enough to hear his voice like Samuel did he says stand still don't be excited if you want something of God ask him then stand still and listen and see what he's going to say about it you know what brother Brandon would do this is the prophet of God the angel did not always come to the prophet of God and tell him what was going to happen brother Brown would say I would take my notepad and I would write down the questions I had and the situations I was facing he says and then I go sit down on a log somewhere and I'd say Lord here it is what about it he says and then I'd sit there for a while he says and then something will come over me or there'll be an unction and I would write down that answer and then he would go back and check it with the word and then if it lined up with the word then he would do what he felt led to do that's a prophet of God that's something I can do I don't have to be a prophet to sit still write it out ask God write down the unction check it with the word and then go act on it any one of us can do that sometimes he might send an Angel sometimes he might send a dream sometimes he might send a vision sometimes he might have the the minister speak it over the pulpit without realizing what he's saying but there's a place for God to come down and talk to us one-on-one and that's what we're talking about he says just open your heart up and say what about it Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't answer the first five hours then wait another if he doesn't answer today then he'll answer tomorrow if he doesn't answer this week he will next week he says stay there till he answers so we see that that persistence that diligence that commitment to finding his answer rather than letting the circumstances drive us to make decisions drive us to do things that are not necessarily in his will that's what gets us into trouble but if we can stay persistent to find his answer that's where the power is that's where the anointing is amen now that doesn't mean we have to keep praying about everything all the time either I've said this before and I've talked to different ones in this church and I believe we're at the the same way there's some things where I just go to him in prayer once and I leave it there that unction goes that burden goes whatever it's just right there I mean we get prayer requests from all over the world today we're bombarded by the needs of the body you know if you if you've lived in other places uh you know these different things you've met people you've been to other churches and you keep in contact with some of them then what do they do they send us all these prayer requests and we don't have enough time in the day to pray over everything that comes our way all day every day we just don't have the time to do it so for me you know you know in a Minister's group or something like that they'll put a prayer request you know what I do I bow my head I pray right there and I take it to the Lord and I leave it there unless I feel led to do otherwise there's some we'll all keep praying now if it's somebody that's related to somebody in this church well that tends to be a bit different that brings them one connection closer but our burden really ought to be for the local body because this is where we are and nobody knows how to pray for us like us because we know our weaknesses we know our strengths we know some of the situations we know what's going on and we love and care about us because this is our local body here and that's where my burden is and that's where the pressure is for me to pray for people again I'm not saying we don't pray for others around but for me most of them I just pray for them once and leave them there but if somebody says my brother's sick then we pray for that because they're a part of our body through that and these different things but it's it's just not something we can we can focus on we don't have the time to do all of those things amen but as we pray we also need to have discernment we need to have discernment about situations and I've shared this with some of you in private after you came up for prayer and a lot of times it'd be months afterwards where somebody will come up for prayer and they'll ask for one thing and I know that that is not the prayer that needs to be prayed and that's when the holy spirit's moving and so I will pray as you ask but it'll usually be generic rather than specific because there's something else in my heart that says that's not the way that this is going to be resolved is the way they're asking for it and so I've got to pray with discernment because the holy spirit's now moving remember sons of God are led by the spirit of God and so now there's something in my mind says be real careful here pray for them but pray in a way that allows God to move rather than do it the way that they're asking so if you ever hear me pray a generic prayer you might want to come talk to me after service because it means that I believe there's something else going on there okay but we say that we ought not to because sometimes and and again I can only speak for myself sometimes you ever pray and it seems like the prayer is just bouncing off the ceiling right you know what that is usually that's God's saying this ain't the way you're supposed to be praying this is not the truth for the situation this is not the answer for the situation and sometimes you just get an uneasy feeling and you just kind of pull back and you say well that's not the way prayer is supposed to feel is uneasy getting into the presence of God ought not to make us uneasy about what we're saying so that's God trying to tell us to pull back on these things and say there's probably more here than you realize and you need to just step back a bit and just let it hand it over to me just pray for the person pray for the situation but let me sort out the details brother Brown would say this he says that's the way in the meeting sometimes say well why don't you just pray for the people sometimes you notice in the meetings it has to be something the whole picture is Divine Healing and salvation but sometimes there's something in a fellow's way that keeps him from getting healed you hear it right here on the platform something they done somewhere else and something they've got to make right they have to do that before the blessing of God can come on them certainly not he says you can't do that you can't pray that situation out of their life or that sickness out of them he says but if that person had sinned and something in their life that they should not have done or they should have done catch that shouldn't have done or they should have done you can have a Jonas sometimes Lord telling them what to do and they refuse to do it you can't get them out of that situation because God's using the situation to drive them into his will he says you can pour oil on them day and night and it'll never do them any good you can pray scream cry cast out demons as much as you want to it'll never leave the person until they make that thing right he says that's right you've got to get right with God first he says and you have to be careful God dealt with Moses he's speaking about the situation where he struck The Rock he says he deals with the people so if God has put something on a person or let Satan put it on them for a purpose to bring the person to him nor do something then you come and take that off without this person repenting for it see what kind of trouble you get yourself in he says you have to be careful we're supposed to have discernment amen so let's talk about this lion anointing and as I've said before this is this is where we love to see God move this is the apostolic anointing this is the original Pentecost anointing and the lion comes in power and brother Brown would say he comes with sternness he comes with authority and nothing stands in front of a line when a lion's going down the trail if this was a trail and the Lion's here and he's going there you do not want to be between him and that door because everything has to move in front of a line he's the king of the beasts he knows his position he knows his power and nothing's going to stand in front of him he's going to move it out of the way but a lion just it doesn't try and work things out you'll never see a lion you know kind of uh having a a parley having a trying to trying to argue an animal into its mouth or to move it away it just does it if it wants it it takes it if it wants it to go it moves it out if it wants to eat it it eats it it doesn't sit and try and have a nice conversation with it it just comes in and boom and it's done and that's that line anointing a man with a lion when a lion attacks it's a finished work it's not going to put it that way and when God moves as a lion anointing it's a finished work right then and this is the supernatural element we'll see of Divine Healing of Deliverance of provision in these things where one one minute it's not there or it's there and it's then it's gone or a minute it's not there and then it is there and you just don't know what happened and God just moves supernaturally but this was personified brother Brown would say in the first church age there's four anointings and the first this lion age was the first church age in the book of Acts and we see that and what is it it's Christ proving himself real amongst the people again we see it in Acts chapter 5 and it says in that by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and of the rest their snowman joined himself to them but the people magnified them and the Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women it says in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them they had such high regard for Peter for the authority of God that was in his life that they were putting them under Peter's Shadow as he walked with the Hope or the belief that they would be healed just by being in his shadow that's a line anointing that's what it looks like he says there also came a multitude out of the Cities round about under Jerusalem bringing sick folks and then which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one now there's only one other place you'll see this in the scripture and that's in Jesus own Ministry where they bring people and thousands upon thousands and the scripture the gospels would say and he healed everyone now he didn't do that every time but there were moments where the allian anointing is there and what happens is nothing stands in its way he didn't sit back and say well you've got something wrong in your life and you've got this no the lion went in and it just cleaned house it just booted Satan out of every life it just cleaned them out he couldn't stand in front of it because that was the anointing but that's not every anointing that's not every time he wasn't always under that but that that that they were healed everyone is under Jesus ministry and then he comes right in behind it and he sits right in those Apostles and he's proving what Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's that Apostolic that line anointing amen but I want you to understand one thing that these anointings come with people that have character to handle them and this is the great balance when we talk about these things because without the character to handle it you'll turn yourself into a denomination you'll draw people after you you'll talk about it you'll make a big deal about it and you won't give the glory to God but everything the apostles did they said we do it but through faith in Jesus name and they give the glory to Christ rather than to themselves and they just like everyone else they would all the other Apostles they would always say they would point back and say this is him brother Brandon will come and he'd say I can't do it this is him this is him the character for a line anointing says this is him that's how you know that they're ready for him and it's not haphazard God doesn't just drop these line anointings into people's lives that's not the way it works because this is spoken word Authority so often and so you've got to have the character to handle it brother Brown would say this because you've got to prove yourself for some of these things he said some people gets the wrong impression about what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing this is a great question what was the greatest anointing and what did it look like he says the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ so that's our that's our example he says we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read and said the spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick and give sight to the blind he says and now we would think if such an anointing was on him he'd been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler this is a a prophecy that's been bound up for 800 years and now it's personified in flesh in front of them he knows who he is he's ready to deliver he's ready to open prison doors he's ready to cast out demons he's ready to heal the sick and brother Bram says you'd think that we just be blowing up the church you think the minister would be blowing up he says but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down remember the question was when was the greatest anointing and what did they do when they had that anointing God in flesh comes into the into the temple and he takes a chair and he says this is the day of Deliverance and he sits down if they could have recognized what was there everyone there could have been delivered healed set free but the thing is if the preacher is not running around yelling screaming we can't even say Amen sometimes I'm not talking to us here you're a quiet group you're listening I'm fine with that fine saying sometimes we think if we're not yelling and screaming the holy spirit's not moving that the presence of the Lord isn't here the Lord himself was in church brother Brown said with the greatest anointing ever and he sat down and he preached a sermon sitting down how far will we get if we had special meetings and the preacher was sitting down something to think about what's our focus on is it the delivery or is it the words that are coming out of his mouth because precious words precious words while he sat quietly in his chair the God of all ages the creator of Heaven and Earth sat and delivered the greatest sermon under the greatest anointing ever and we say if we're not shouting if we're not dancing if we're not speaking in tongues if we're not hooping and hollering Church were in the flesh too many times in our expectation of how God's going to move remember when God answers he chooses the anointing not us that's what I'm saying I'm not saying I love a hoop and hollering service who doesn't that you you get the full Buffet when it soaks kind of services but we don't always need a buffet sometimes we need a surgery sometimes we need something that's just exactly it and it can only come one way and it's not always hooping and hollering it's also not always just quiet and methodical either let's go the other way I can't be clinical all the time can I no no no we gotta move as the spirit moves us he says but the Bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he did under the anointing the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control knowing what and how no knowing exactly what and how it's very specific it's not haphazard it's not here take this anointing and run with it no no here's what it's supposed to be doing take it and use it the way it's supposed to be used and then we see that with Moses Moses had a line anointing didn't he Moses have word authority Moses had word authority and he went out and God told him exactly what to do with that word Authority because he said speak to the Rock he put word Authority in Moses mouth and Moses went and he got angry and the Bible says he lifted himself up rather than God and he smote The Rock twice and said you rebels you this you that he got frustrated and in frustration he used that anointing wrong he struck the rock twice and God said because of that you can't go into the land we look at Elisha we look at Elisha remember he's bald-headed at an early age and those kids come out and they make fun of him and he calls out he he curses them and two bears come out and kill him that was not the anointing of the Lord's purpose to kill children for making fun of a prophet what was it he spoke out of anger rather than character and every time you do it it brings judgment judgment judgment remember brother Branham the holy spirit said there's a trap for you this evening look out and he's got that couple making out in his meetings you can't tell me that's not a satanic influence that's Raw Pure satanic influences is a couple making out on the front and brother bam looks at them and he and remember the Lord's the angel says they're in your hands you do what you want and he looks at them and his words are what I forgive you because God's given him now the authority to speak he says I forgive you but don't do it again because judgment was coming next but he gave mercy first judgment second but you put that line anointing without character in the moment and it brings judgment every single time but not watch now because remember Moses greatest Prophet aside from Christ in the Old Testament terms of works and these different things but Moses doesn't have the Holy Ghost he's got an anointing on him and it is the Holy Ghost but he doesn't have it in the way that we have in the New Testament but watch what it does with Paul it says and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possess with a spirit of divination met us which brought her Masters much gained by Susan so this was a girl that had a gift but it was demonically controlled and she would tell the future and she met she was she was owned by somebody and she made them a lot of money it says the same follow Paul and us and cried saying these men are the Servants of the most high God which show unto us the way of Salvation she's speaking the truth this isn't necessarily something that's going to hurt Paul and Barnabas it says and this she did many days we're talking lion anointing now it says and Paul being grieved let me say it this way Paul wasn't grieved until he was grieved Paul was not grieved all along because here's the thing she's doing them a favor but there comes a place where Paul is grieved not for himself he's grief for her because she's under demonic influence remember the line anointing it's not about me it's about you God and we're going to get into this at the end of this service we think the gifts oh well I've got the alignment anointing I speak things out of my life the line anointings for the other person not for me necessarily sometimes it's for me but many times this is meant for service not for personal use if we can put it that way but Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour so the line anointing finally comes out of Paul but watch what Paul what brother Brown would say he says Paul was correctly a prisoner he wasn't making any wrong statement he was trained by the Holy Ghost again to wait on the word now he had been trained one way but God had trained him another way now he was trained by the Holy Spirit to wait upon the Lord no matter what his Ambitions were he says now I'm going to help by the Holy Spirit show you something see now let's just take an instance one day Paul and Silas coming down the street in a certain city where they were holding a Revival and the little demon-possessed girl kept following him crying him out and no doubt but what Paul knew that he had the authority as an apostle to rebuke that evil spirit out of that woman just like Moses just like Elisha he has authority to do acts on Earth of his own choosing we see it but brother Brown says but did you notice he waited day he waited day after day until all of a sudden that's why I said Paul wasn't grieved until he was grieved because what the holy spirit said now we got us a situation Paul had to just deal with it and it didn't seem to bother him but all of a sudden brother bam says now all of a sudden the Holy Spirit speaks to him and says this is the hour then he said thou Spirit come out of her see he knew to wait on the Lord and there's where so many people today bring a reproach upon the word they go out with an ambition see Ambitions about me glorifications about him right Ambitions about being worships about him so if it's about me then it's not going to do its intended work he says how many revivals has been left flat because of a thing like that because the evangelists don't wait to see what the Lord has got to say some of them say come over here and they go right now because the association said go and the Holy Spirit would say something different brother Bradham especially early in his ministry remember the Holy Spirit the angel tells him this is where you're supposed to go he goes there they change the itinerary on him and he says this ain't the way we're supposed to go and he forces him to stand by the side of the road and he says it will not work we will not be blessed I'm having you stand here as a witness that the Holy Spirit has told me don't do it but we'll do it your way because you control you got the flights you got the money everything I can't go if you guys don't go with me but he says we're going to pay a price and remember brother Brandon had malaria I think for six months after that the meetings got rained out nothing good happened out of it because they didn't follow the Holy Spirit and brother bam learned after that I won't ever do that again because remember God wouldn't even hear his prayer after that because he told them what the holy spirit said but he wouldn't obey it himself he wouldn't stand his feet firm on his feet he says yet the ambition of the man to become the state presbyter or something another or some elder or some bishop or something would pull him you must go and yet he knows better the holy spirit's saying go here see he's yoked to his organization he's a prisoner to the organization but if he's yoked to Christ he's led by the Holy Spirit he's yoke to prisoner doesn't make any difference what anything else says he says it's a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol it means nothing because he's listening to what the voice of the shepherd he only hears the voice of God and he only speaks only when it comes out he says nothing or underline anointing now what is it when you speak under that anointing it's not you speaking it's God speaking through you and you're quiet until he tells you what to say when to say and how to say it and then you repeat it back and then it's a Holy Ghost speaking through him so why do I say that because it balances this this Doctrine and this teaching that is correct because brother I would say enough speak the word but the fact is we must be led by the Holy Spirit to speak the word because the word is the thoughts and will and word of God so you can't speak the word unless you have the thoughts will and purpose of God you can speak a word but you can't speak the word unless you're led by the Holy Spirit that's the balances that the seeking happens before the speaking seeking happens before the speaking otherwise we become a Joel Olsteen or a flow dollar or Kenneth Copeland or pick these different false ministers right we've got to be in God's Will and God's timing to speak and then when he tells us to speak then we speak these things now I want to say this before we continue those four powers were specific answers of God's attack of God to Satan's attack through the church ages but that doesn't mean that those powers or anointings are only for that age because remember these are the responses of God and we have a generational uh spirit or power like we said before we're in the eagle age that's the eagle anointing because we're supposed to rise above it that we're supposed to go ultimately in a resurrection and a Rapture but that doesn't mean that God won't use the line anointing in our life he won't use the ox anointing he won't use the man anointing either but all three are available to God to speak to us and work with us as he chooses but the overcoming spirit for the age is the one that God has designated you're not going to be a full Overcomer unless you get in the anointing of your age unless you receive it and for us it's that ego anointing it's that flying away it's that swiftness it's the sudden taking away of the Bride amen but here healing in particular is where we see this in different ways because we can see it through man we can see it through through God we can see it supernaturally we can see it immediate we can see it over time we start dealing with mental conditions and those sorts of things and God works in so many different ways and you see brother Branham he has one service where God literally creates an eyeball in the socket that's a line anointing that's a creative word of God that's putting an eye socket there then John Ryan gets prayed for and it takes him two weeks to receive his blind being healed back to sight and then he has these kids that come up and they're cross-eyed and every time brother Brandon would straighten those eyes out by the holy spirit because remember Sharon Rose when she died she was in such pain it crossed her eyes and brother Brown had a personal um uh empathy with with what happened there and every single time he would straighten those eyes out by the power of the Holy Ghost because it meant something to him but you have three different eye conditions one spoken word one takes two weeks and then one gets straightened out right in there but watch this brother I'm saying there's nothing like music you know God heals by music do you know that God heals by love see God heals by medicine God heals by prayer God has many ways of healing now listen to this depends on what you need oh that means what you need and what you need with the exact same condition may be completely different completely different see the need is based on the person not on the condition right so there's different there's different ways different means for each and every one of us he says sometimes a little love stretched out will just cure an old sore an old place that's been a grudge or something it'll heal right over just a little love and a little care sometimes when you feel all down and as we call it a street expression down in the dumpsy just put on one of those tapes that music or record and go to playing it the first thing you know you're patting your foot or your hand and it's all over then he says you're right up and ready to go again some one person needs love one person needs music Same condition he says now God heals in many ways a doctor asked me long ago said what's your opinion of medicine brother Brandon I said well God is the only one that can heal sir I said the Bible don't lie and the Bible said I am the Lord that heals all your diseases I rest on that but it's his choice of how he's going to heal he says and I said the Bible can't lie I said God heals by medicine God heals my love God heals by understanding I remember when I got in that bad car wreck back in 2006 and I couldn't sleep and I was on pain meds and I had insomnia all these different things and as soon as I found out what was wrong they finally figured it out I started sleeping no worry just an understanding of what was wrong allowed me to sleep and that's all it took he says God heals by prayer God heals by Miracles the whole thing God heals that's all all there is to it he is the Healer he says we haven't got a medicine that can create and create a cell in your hand to heal create in your body to heal we can move a tooth we can cut out an appendix or take out a gallbladder but who healed God no medicine will build tissue only God life builds tissue he says God's the only healer and we're talking on that he says I hope each one of you get that especially you people that's to be prayed for that's so uncomfortable this morning with maybe troubles that doctors cannot touch we believe that doctors help people I believe that God heals by medicine God heals by surgery God heals by understanding God heals by love he says just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them that you care for them see God heals by love God heals my prayer God heals by Miracles God heals by his word God heals that's the bottom line says God's the one that's doing the healing work whatever Source it is God heals by it it's God that heals for he said I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases so all of it should work together and men in different Ministries should work together for that you know what we have ministers come you get a Joe Adams right you talk about a line anointing of Faith anointing and he preaches one way and people get healed under that and then you get somebody talks real come and they show people their place in the word in a different way and people get healed by that and then you get this one coming and that one come in brother but I'm saying don't let the don't let the different gifts the different approaches the different anointings change your opinions of each other or cause conflict conflict can't be because of the anointings that are on us because it's all the self-same Holy Spirit but he's working in different gifts in different ways in each of us he says we should work together you got something I don't I want to work with you that's why we bring ministers in is because I know I don't have it all heaven knows I know I don't have it all we bring them in because that's what the effective working of the holy spirit in the body for the edification of the Saints amen but now we get the ox anointing and let's let's be honest this is our least favorite anointing nobody's praying usually Lord give me the ox anointing because the ox anointing remember is it's a sacrifice to make it's a surrender and it's a burden carrying a burden-bearing position amen and this is anointing where God's working with us rather than around us and so the work's got to be done in US God's going to let us prove his word by sticking with it until it happens and this is the long haul this is the long game this is the out in the distance the ox anointing is for When God says wait this is going to take some time to do this and we know this was the original anointing in the second Church age and it came right after the apostles had died out and people started moving to leadership of men and all of a sudden God puts this anointing on them to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the gospel and Christianity went under persecution the Catholic Church took over and they moved into the Dark Ages but this anointing was still victory that's the thing to see this anointing was still overcoming this thing was still defeating Satan even though so often it looked like it was just lives being thrown away right they gave their lives but God said it was their overcoming for that age right so when God sends you an ox anointing you overcome by two things your attitude and your response which do not change regardless of the situation your response and your attitude they hold fast to the word regardless of what the situation is and that's the power of the ox anointing is that you won't change no matter what you'll hold fast to what God has said you'll hold fast to what you believe and you'll bear brother Brandon would say this many times he would say you'll bear the burden of the Gospel I'm I'm kind of paraphrasing that a bit but we talk about bearing the burden of the Gospel when your confession is one thing and what is actually happening is other and we see that in Abraham very clearly right he professed those things that were not as though they were for 25 years and that was an ox anointing there if we can see that we'll stay there no matter what it is and we'll bear the burden we'll bear the scorn we'll bear the apparent reproach no matter what we won't move from these things and we look at these and and as I was studying this Brother Brad would talk about these anointings in the in the fivefold ministry and he would he would point to these different ones and he would say the prophets the eagle and then he'd also say the Evangelist is the eagle then the apostles were the Lions and the teachers would be the man anointing but there's one thing that's always an ox and he never gives this to anyone else and he says the pastor is always the ox because the pastor has to be able to work with patients not force issues Pastor has to be able to preach and see the people not take it not act on it right away maybe not believe it even turn it down flat he's got to be able to tell people what they're supposed to do and have them completely disagree and disobey he's got to be able to do that it's the long game it's the patience game it's the day in and day out trudging just one foot in front of the other and the patient recognition that God's work is always perfect that's the pastor anointing you've got to be okay with what waiting it's always that way a pastor is always in it for the long haul and at Long Haul and it's to prove that we will trust and believe God no matter what we see or don't see as the case may be right because we go through things let's let's face it we go through things that will push most people away from the word of God we lose families we lose friends we lose jobs we lose opportunities or we turn them down if I could put it that way we're rejected we're scorned we're persecuted in different things we live our lives a certain way there's a financial impact speaking currently of serving the lord all these things that come in and people would look at that and they and then when things get tough you'd say you've done everything right and then God allows you to do that and they walk away why because there's no anointing in their life to hold them there but we hold no matter what now that doesn't mean that under Knox anointing God won't change the situation absolutely he does but this is a wait and see amen and he he's working in us to draw something out to prove his word in us that we're capable of holding that we're faithful soldiers this is a very familiar quote I know and it's in the message I know and it says why does God let troubles come God harnesses troubles puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God listen job had an ox anointing and in the end he had a revelation of a resurrection that he was asking about beforehand and in the end he got everything back and he had a greater life and greater wealth but above all he was closer to God than he'd ever been why because that Ox anointing said blessed be the name of the Lord the Lord gives the Lord takes away he'd just hold fast in it now the ox anointing is a real trial of our faith because the answer never comes immediately that's what we're going to talk about and I want to I want to talk about this and this is going to be the the last thing we're going to dwell on this morning I'm going to take us right into the prophet's life and I've got a lot of quotes here to tell this story but I want you to see what this Ox anointing looks like he says when I was healed with stomach trouble while I remember holding my stomach going along there and when I was prayed for I didn't have nobody with the gift of healing to pray for me the Elder anointed me with oil I read in the Bible I seen God's word was right I knew he had a right though he was a Baptist preacher he come along and anointed me said the Bible said so he poured some oil on my head said now you'll believe you'll get well I say God I'm asking with all my heart let me get well I went right down home to start my eating I've been drinking barley water and prune juice for about three four months the doctor said one mouthful of solid food would kill you right now he says you know what I did I went right down home and we had cornbread beans and onions for dinner so the prophet from an early age God calls him to the ministry reveals himself to him and then he gets stomach trouble praise the Lord said no one he says I will never forget poor old dad how he cried and mother said I don't mind you having religion honey but the doctor said it will kill you I said but God said I would live and if I die I'm coming up to your house and when I meet you at the door I die trusting your word I said I've tried doctors long enough and they can't do me no good I took that big mouthful of beans and an onion great big Chomp of that cornbread and I started on it and I chewed it tasted pretty good A little funny hadn't eaten in about over a year of anything solid this is an ox anointing Church when I swallowed the first mouthful here it come right back up again hmm Glory praise the Lord for his healing when I did I held my hand over my mouth to keep it from coming up got me another Spoonful till I eat the whole plate entire plate full of them when I got up from the table I just had to hold my hand just as sour of acid as I could be mother called the doctor and he said he will die that's all there is to it one mouthful will kill him that's all there is here I was going across the floor you know she said are you how are you feeling I said wonderful fine she said you're about to die I said no ma'am just swallowed as fast as I could hot water in my mouth you know went on a cross and I saw they're all gone he says I got in the room and I started across the floor and he started saying I can I will he's singing the song I can I will I do believe that Jesus heals me now I'll take you as your word I'll take you at your word like that you know on down believe in that with all my heart I just got so weak I almost just almost fell across the bed like that I thought oh Mercy Mercy and I got up the next day I walked down the street you know my I didn't care he didn't die he says mother come in she watched Me All Night Long thought sure I'd die you know next morning all them beans was laying right there at the same place said what you want I said I want some more Beans and Cornbread oh yes the devil wasn't going to cheat me out of it no no God said so is he enjoying this is he having a good time with his healing he says every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line I'm trusting in his word divine and every promise in the book is mine that's right he said whosoever will he says then said William Branham he says there might be a hundred William branhams but everyone he says whosoever will I know it's mine he says that's right I just said I believe you yes sir and I started on went down the street said how are you feeling brother Branham I said wonderful I go down the street go on mouth full of beans swallow them back no no I wasn't going to spit them out no sir I swallowed them back the Lord blessed them they were mine kept down go down there say hello brother Brandon I'd say hello how are you feeling wonderful somebody told me long ago brother Brandon you were lying he says no I wasn't they were asking me how my body was feeling I was answering how my faith was oh I loved it when I read that I started crying because sometimes we're in situations and nothing has changed we still feel horrible we're still swallowing whatever it is we got to keep swallowing and you say how you feeling I feel horrible but that's not what I'm resting on I'm resting on the faith that's solid and says he has answered my prayer oh I love when he said that my I answered how my faith was it was wonderful yes sir my faith was feeling wonderful because I took God at his word I didn't care how I felt I'd still been belching up I'd still say I'm healed amen that's right sure because God's word is right did you know brother Brandon never got his full healing until the last little bit of his life he went decades with stomach trouble but did you know that him lasting decades was Supernatural because remember the doctor said the day you eat thereof is the day you die and so the supernatural Ox anointing comes gives them Faith to keep claiming his full healing but in the meantime it won't kill him God lets it stay on him but it won't kill him but every day that brother Branham lives until he gets his healing decades later he has a sour stomach can't eat food properly can't enjoy food properly tastes good in his mouth sour in his belly constantly for the rest of his adult life he dealt with stomach trouble he says my stomach gets sour oh my brother Jax helped me around the house I walk right around the house just a hot greasy water like flying out of my mouth and walk to the pulpit pray for a people that was twice that bad and be healed I've had them lay my hands on a man with cancer on his face and the cancer left his face standing there and I was so sick I couldn't stand up not fair we would say not fair healing virtue God's using me there's a gift of healing and I'm sitting here and I got to deal with this God do you even love me We can question so easily because he won't do for us what he's done for others but he'll give you the anointing to Bear the burden he says and you don't know what I've suffered just mental oppression every seven years it's come all my life he says that's where I'm now 7 8. he says that I was so distressed prophet of the age Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 fulfilling prophet son of man Ministry so United with God that this that he would speak to him and say this isn't even brother Branham speaking and he has stomach trouble for 30 odd years I cried I begged I pleaded and I remember when I finally thought I had enough money to go to males for an examination the Mayo Clinic it said they'll find what your trouble is wife and I Becky there Sarah was a little itty bitty fellow I just entered my Healing Ministry he says and we took off the males he's had this sickness he's he he's literally producing the supernatural by a gift of Divine Healing and he can't access it then brother Brandon would explain how he had a vision and he's about to get his check up and uh this is much much further down or sorry this is before he goes down he has a vision remember of a squirrel and the squirrel is about six inches long and it jumps at him and it goes down his throat and it goes into his stomach and starts and he says it was tearing me apart tearing me in pieces from the inside out but at the end of the vision it said remember it's only six inches long so brother Ram has his vision and he he he he's not sure what it means and then he follows up he says now Mayo brothers the next day examined me said my father your father was an Irishman he drank your mother being a half Indian makes you almost a half breed you're just such a nervous wreck until you're never be out of it said otherwise you're healthy but that's just something that the soul and the soul of man cannot control he said you'll never get over it said the old timers used to call it you had the blues and it wouldn't leave them said when that hits you your stomach sours you're just upset and I said but sir I didn't do I don't do nothing I said I'm happy said that's right he says it's just out of the human grab bag in other words it's just a matter of luck or bad luck I guess he says oh what a discouraging thing but the words to think it remember it's only six inches long that's hung with me as my dear wife back there can tell you year after year I've thought of that he's got a promise of Divine Healing he's got a vision of Divine Healing now and year after year after year he keeps thinking about this he says I started to Africa I get some shots when I was getting these shots he said well I can't find anything wrong with you I said Thank you so I got a physical test to take my health certificate to the board so he said you know anything else about it I said nothing but persistent souring in the stomach all the time prophet of God had a persistent souring stomach all the time I said oh I've been examined I've been to Mayo brothers and everywhere he said but wait a minute he said sometimes an altar so little that barrier meal won't show it and sometimes it's too big to show it because an x-ray is only a shadow a little bitty ulcer you can't see it well it won't enough stick a whole lot of little itty bitty ulcers that would do that he said I know an old doctor up here that's found an instrument they got it now they can put you to sleep with the little sodium pentathol put a tube down your throat they just actually look down in your stomach and see what's wrong said he's your type of people he's a Christian said why don't you go see him I took his name Dr Van ravenworth now brother Adam goes to see him first and brother and Dr ravenworth gives him an examination says your stomach lines your stomach walls are so hard it's impossible for us to cure it and brother I'm supposed to go back for a follow-up to see if they can do something to treat it right to discuss what they might do he's been suffering for decades Church it hasn't held him back one bit he's still going up to that platform night after night around the world seven times healing campaign after healing campaign saying Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever doing the signs and wonders and works of the son of man Ministry and he's had Decades of stomach trouble no healing but it hasn't stopped him from doing his work that's what an ox anointing will do you think about brother Ron Spencer he's coming up on his fourth year of stage four brain and lung cancer should have been dead in six months he's coming up on four years and he doesn't let him stop going to that pulpit you know what for a while he took a bit of time eased off a bit let's see what happens and when it was apparent that nothing was going to change in the general sense he said well then I'm just going to keep swallowing it down I'm going to be taking my drinks I'm going to go up I'm going to preach my heart out and then I'm gonna go collapse on the bed out back and he does that service after service not just in his local church traveling around the country traveling around the continent special meetings preaching for people why because he won't let Satan get the victory what is it it's an ox anointing until the lion comes to take it away it's a modern day version of what we're seeing today and it is no less Supernatural than if God just clicked his fingers and said it's gone because how many people can do stage four brain and lung cancer and preach the word of God the way Ron Spencer can what is it it's the power of God keeping him alive to do the work of the ministry he goes and just before he's going to see the doctor a second time Holy Spirit drops down says go to the Catalina mountains and we know about that experience where the sword of the king comes down and he sees the word Eagle written in White Stone on the Rock I've been there it's a it's a neatest thing but you've got to understand he's gone now through 30 odd years of stomach trouble and God cares through the full 30 years but God cares in a way that's best for William Branham in the way that God knows not in the way that William Branham knows God knows our every trial church he knows how to take us through he knows what we're supposed to do he knows the effect it's going to have so brother Brown he's in those mountains now and he hasn't gone back to the doctor yet he says so I turned him there and as I turned into that little Cove I felt the presence of the Lord I jerked off my hat and looked around I thought he's here somewhere I know he's here I thought what is it I made a few more steps I said Lord you're here somewhere as I looked on the path and lay there laid that little squirrel that had jumped at something and missed it and it hit a bunch of choya that's jumping cactus and it ran through his head chest and stomach and he was dead he says that odd looking little squirrel he had missed my mouth and hit that choya and the voice of the Lord said your enemy is dead he says I stood there and I trembled you know what he did after that I mashed through it with my foot remember what happened when they killed those five Kings they captured those five Kings when the children of Israel were there and they boxed them into a cave and then they brought him out after they killed all their soldiers they brought him out maybe it was a gag was it a gag I'm trying to remember they brought him out and they said every child of Israel come up and put your foot on the neck of your enemy sometimes we've got a show we know the battle is won we recognize the spirit of God we recognize the presence of God and we just have to go and say here I see it and you're driving a stake in the ground saying he didn't work it is finished my enemy is dead amen you gotta show you know what's going on you got to show you know what the spirit's doing you got to show that you know that he has met your need that God has answered your prayer what is it remember Moses would say he says write a book of remembrance remember the day you put your foot on that enemy's neck remember what it says we're going to do when Satan at the end he says he's going to be down there and it says we'll look narrowly on him say is this the man is this the man really if I'd have known that I wouldn't have worried church I'm here to tell you you don't have to worry you don't have to think he's greater he's a little man he's got an inferiority complex and the only Power he has is what you give him he says I went back around sat down again sat there and cried a while and prayed looking down over Tucson miles below me turn back around and come back it's still laid there when I entered that Cove the spirit of God come on me again I went on around went down the mountain went in told my wife and said honey I don't know how but I'm going to get over this Dr ravensworth when he gave me the examination this is in the past he says it's totally impossible for you to be well he gave me a shot of pentathol that was to last me for five minutes and I slept for 10 hours when I come to the next morning he told me the next morning said Reverend I hate to tell you this but your stomach walls are even so hard they're dried up I never seen it he used the name of gastritis and I went and looked up in the dictionary and said something that's withered away and said you can't get over it he said you'll always have it this is in the past he hasn't gone back to the doctor yet this is the initial examination he says and I would have been a discouraged boy if it hadn't been for the vision of the Lord he's pointing way back when 30 odd years he says somehow I know he says and I'll tell you before it happens in other words I've let you know it's done he says the doctor is a good doctor no doubt I think he's a fine man but I know I'm going to be over it it's done it's finished and I'm going to be well how many want an ox anointing sometimes that's what we need because the situation ain't going and we're not flying and we're not going through it and we've got to just bear down and say Lord I believe and I'm going to keep putting one foot in front of the other I'm going to keep trusting I'm going to keep confessing I'm going to keep professing I'm going to keep praying I'm going to keep knocking but I'm going to drive a stake down and say the day I asked was the day you answered remember Daniel prayed for an answer he prayed for an answer and it took weeks because the angel got into a supernatural battle with other Angels remember and Michael had to come help that angel get through to Daniel he said Daniel your prayer was heard the moment you prayed the answer was on the way as soon as you prayed but I got held up I got held up but the answer was on the way as soon as you prayed that's the way God works the answer is on the way the timing though is in his hands what is it brother Branham sacrificed I was listening to brother Branham and Jehovah Jireh the third one this morning he says he says what about our rights he says I've got rights as an American citizen he says you give up those rights to become a Christian brother Branham gave up his right to be frustrated to be upset to be hurt to be disillusioned to be disappointed to be down in the dumps he surrendered that under that anointing and he bore it with Grace day in day out week months years decades didn't begrudge the healing of all the ones around him that got it didn't begrudge the spoken word the Visions the dreams all the answers they got did not hold him back from showing forth the love of God the mercy of God the grace of God the goodness of God just because he had trouble in his life in his stomach it never held him back in his ministry that's how you know there's an ox anointing in your life it's for When God says wait and you say okay he's given you an anointing to hold you steady if the musicians would come I'm going to close with the scripture why say us thou o Jacob and speakest O Israel my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from God he says why are you acting why are you saying that God doesn't see what's going on that that my judgment's gone on that he's not enforcing what I'm supposed to receive he says hast thou not known Hassall not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary remember when on Mount Carmel well he was saying well maybe he's sleeping God doesn't sleep nor does he slumber he says neither he's weary there is no searching of his understanding in other words you can't figure it out so don't try and figure it out but rest that he's sorting things out he says he gives power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength he says even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord that's the ox anointing they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen God bless you this morning let's stand if we would I know the things that many of us are dealing with and have dealt with and sometimes our only question is God what's taken so long why are you waiting and sometimes all God's trying to get us to see is his anointing on you in that situation to recognize that the victory that lays in you to keep you steady is the one that he's trying to prove through you to be still and know that he's God brother I would say get there in his presence and be still and wait and in the meantime be faithful be faithful be faithful say Lord I believe and you know what sometimes say Lord help my unbelief too right that Ox anointing just one foot in front of the other some of us are built for it I was talking to Dad last night and and he was you know talking about pastorship and that and he said you know I can see that it suits you in the sense that you can just do things day in and day out no variance no worrying no must no fuss I said yep but that doesn't make it easy doesn't make it easy but it's something that comes more naturally to me what I don't do easily is turn corners and so that's where my trouble is oftentimes to make that corner to turn that around but my point is to stay with it it's just one foot at a time just one step at a time so often we're saying I gotta get there I remember hunting up in the mountains sheep hunting with brother Jethro Steven and if you looked at the journey you'd never start you're on foot you got to carry in I had 65 pounds of gear and a nine and a half pound rifle almost 75 pounds of gear and we had to walk seven thousand feet up and you just look and the mountains are so far in the distance because you start on the flat and then you go into the Foothills and then you start climbing these mountains and sometimes it's hand over hand it's the only way you can get up and if you looked at how long it was you'd never start the beauty was I never knew where we were going I didn't know where we were going I'd never been there so I just walked sometimes that's all we need to do don't say this is where it's going to end just enjoy where we're at because we started walking by streams then we had to walk through streams and guess what we didn't have the full gear for it so we got wet and that was a little miserable until our shoes dried out a bit and we kept going then started getting a little steeper and we slowed down a little bit then it got real Steve then you had to push through bushes and all these different things and the going got tough but I knew that at the end of it we were going to stop at some point and my conviction was I will not let Jethro Steven out walk me I know we got to go somewhere I know we got to Camp somewhere tonight I'm not going to open my word and complain or say I'm tired or sit down or let's stop no no I let him do that don't look for the end just say I'm going to put one foot in front of the other today don't have to go all the way today it's not a Sprint we're not in a Sprint race we're in a marathon and just go step by step kilometer by kilometer week by week month by month let him tell you when it's over but know that there is a Finish Line there's an ending there's a time and a place where your enemy is dead and all he's saying trust me until that day arrives amen let's bow our heads each one Lord God Lord sometimes it seems the way is steep it's long it's tiring Lord It's drudgery from start to finish so many times Lord it's the way you've called us at times in our life Autumn we don't want to look at everything and say well it's going to be an ox anointing for this and an ox anointing for that but Lord when it comes Lord may we trust that the strength and the power of God himself is there to take us through but Lord May us look Also may we look also Lord for that lie in anointing Lord that sudden coming Lord that powerful display of your presence in our midst Lord we know not the day or the hour you hold all these things but Lord let us have faith Lord renew our strength this morning Lord help us to just keep looking and trusting Lord and when you show us a vision Lord may we put our foot on the neck of Satan and say this day it's finished our enemy is dead well grant us Faith to trust you we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen peace of God cover me 12 31. peace of God cover me cover me cover me peace eyes cover me only in you hold me in you I'm secure only in
