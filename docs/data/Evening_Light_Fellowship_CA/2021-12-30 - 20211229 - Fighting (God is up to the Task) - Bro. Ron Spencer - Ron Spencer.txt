you touch our body today lord as that nation is shutting it down again to covet and and even his daughters being put out of a job we asked you that you would make a way lord you you've never seen the righteous forsaken or the seed begging bread and so we ask you that you administer to them in a mighty way touch us tonight we pray in jesus name amen amen psalms chapter 68 and verse 19. blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the formed god of our salvation salah he that is our god is the god of salvation and under god the lord belonged the issues from death but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp of such as one as goeth on steel in his trespasses ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 very familiar portion of scripture finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might and put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand amen you may be seated in the passion translations of psalms chapter 68 and 19 through 21 that i just read you it says it like this what a glorious god he gives us salvation over and over then daily he carries our burdens paul's in his presence our god is a mighty god who saves us over and over for the lord yahweh rescues us from the ways of death many times but he will crush every enemy shattering their strength he will make heads roll for they refuse to repent of their stubborn and sinful ways i want to just subtitle this tonight god is up to the task if your god's too small i want you to introduce you to my god he's a great big god he's a god that spoke the worlds into existence believed his own word spoke it believed his own word and it came into existence my god had a prophet standing on a wide open red sea and he put a phenomenal interstate right through dry ground and then destroyed every everything that's our god i want you to understand and this might be even for you the critic that you have today the critic that has been against you that critic is the one the very one that testifies to the fact that you're a masterpiece did you get it your critic is testifying to you that you are a masterpiece they're actually giving testimony in their criticism of how great you really are i want you to understand tonight as a christian we are in a war brother branham explains that to us over and over again we've not in a picnic but we're in a war we expect struggles we expect disappointments but we are not dependent on our abilities or our gifts we are totally dependent on god are you with me when i would give up when i would have enough energies when i don't have enough strength god's always there so he tells us to put on the whole armor because we are at war remember who your greatest enemy is it's not your wife it's not your husband it's not your pastor it's not the governor it's you it's your flesh look in the mirror analyze it just a bit it's an enemy but i want you to know the token can live on the inside of that piece of flesh and can conquer every enemy that you've got inside of you brother brown taught us about the greatest battle is in our mind it's a place where it's a no man's land god and satan chose a place in the human body to which to battle at is in your mind are you with me now so we understand the battle we understand boxing brother brahm tells us of how many fights that he fought he only had one that was a draw but he had he had incredible amount of fights that he won and so god was training him as a young man to know that one of these days you're going to be in a battle it's not going to be in a ring but it's going to be in a pulpit it's going to be in a pulpit so whether whether you realize they're not even at church there's a battle that's going on and we're not battling throwing stones at one another or trying to see who the weakest link in his church but we're in battle with a spirit that's trying to bring unbelief trying to get you out of your position tell you how weak that you are that you'll never overcome but god's already told you now sometimes in a boxing match there's a little bit of shadow boxing that goes on kind of the testings of strength showing the moves backwards and falls but we have come to the round to where that we must stand toe-to-toe with the enemy are you with me somewhere another you got to stand toe-to-toe with him you're not dancing away from him no more you're not trying to show him some silly moves you just know that you're in a battle and it's it's game on that may not be the proper way to say it but it's game on a lot of people say well i oh i've been in a fight with the devil most of the time it's just a big hugging match a lot of words being exchanged but we're warriors and people that are fighters they never give up now our real thought is when you got your eyes blacked blood's running out of your nose you can't see the guy in front of you you got swell lips then you can say you've been in a real fight a lot of people talk about how bad the devil's been to them all week long why don't you testify to the other end how great god's been for you [Applause] now let me just say this to you i would rather pay attention to god's promises than to pay attention to satan's threats come on church let's just go ahead and get let's just go ahead and get ready remember the scripture tells us that no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper no weapon no matter what the name of it is every person in this building is going through different things in their life maybe you think that nobody cares nobody think you think nobody knows nobody nobody understands your situation but i want you to know there's one greater than a preacher there's one greater than any man that is in the building many times we get hurt attitudes we get hurt feelings we get bruised we get achy even as christians we even get a little squeaky to wear that we can't lift our hands or even saying amen but if you can only get it in your mind i'm better than any loser i am not a quitter and i'm never going to turn back [Applause] i am focused i do not fear and i refuse to be afraid satan begins to stack the odds against you you just start reminding him how big your god is are you with me satan begins to stack the odds against you you start reminding him how big your god is it's come to me this week you will never find your eagle wings in a nest of safety sometimes papa god's got to drop you off of a cliff so you'll find your wings are you with me now see i can preach this from perspective a lot of people can preach this because it sounds good but i can preach it because i'm standing in it [Applause] and i ain't no chicken-hearted preacher i have never been a chicken-hearted preacher i ain't no hearty preacher now i want to remind you before the devil can ever get to your flesh or to your spirit he's first had to have a meeting with god and god's got confidence in you that you can go through the battle because the devil can't touch a hair of your head until he first goes and gets permission from almighty god so when you're going through a trial remember go out and say go ahead go ahead i got confidence in the seed that i put on the inside of him it's not confidence in your flesh it's confidence in that life seed that's laying down inside of there to where you can't see but just when you feel like giving up it takes a hold of your life [Applause] now i want you to understand this regardless of your trial this week regardless of your critic i want to say this to you all things all things work together for good to them that love god amen you know why satan loves to stir up family problems at christmas [Music] am i talking to you now he likes to stir up family problems knowing you're going to get together cause if you begin to fight in your flesh he'll whip you every time but if you get together and you're having a revival and those licks of fire come together he knows that two of you on the same side can whip him every time two is a majority any two touching one thing it shall be done so he likes to get your focus on humanity or hurt feelings a hurt attitude you gotta take the opposite we're here to celebrate jesus we're not here to celebrate the devil and all his wickedness [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified i want you to understand our infinite god who has chosen you to be the battle of this laodicean age he has built you to overcome he elected you when you couldn't elect yourself he called you when you couldn't call yourself he slipped the predestinated wedding band on you before the foundation of the world the battlegrounds are lined up what should we then say to these things if god before us come on church let's just go ahead and give a holy ghost smile right now if god before me who can be against me [Applause] who would be stupid enough to be against me [Music] brother ron you shouldn't use that in the pulpit you ever been in a fight if you're in a fight you ain't talking about how much you love the devil he's stupid to keep showing up at your door anyway [Applause] he is a dumb devil he is a dumb devil let's just put it he is a dumb devil you with him over and over and again and he still keeps coming back and if you know you whipped him one time with him again [Applause] i'll just confess this to you a man called me here i was a preacher pastor here a man called me he was cussing me and cussing me and cussed me and telling me how what he's going to do to me and whip me and all these different kind of things and i said where you at he's well i'm home i said i know where you live i haven't been in a good fight in a long time and i know i can whip you he never called me ever again [Applause] [Music] brother ron i wasn't christian like no i was being truthful with him i've been truthful with him i knew i could weapon i knew what i have been ain't that right brother danny we know what we have there we know what this flesh is capable of i don't want to do it today [Applause] the other day a man drove up into our property in the middle of the night drove right past all the no trespassing signs he was going joy riding with this young girl he's about 40 years old what he didn't realize is we was having a youth meeting and andrew and matthew and myself and brother gabriel loaded up and equipped ourself read between the lines [Laughter] and we stopped him he made all different kind of cussing and all different kind of things but you see he was trespassing on our land and his trouble was he drove on our land we wouldn't have cared if he drove on the neighbor's land come on this works right here we wouldn't have cared well as a matter of fact we wouldn't even said nothing we scared him so bad he was drunk and these boys told him you're not driving out of here being drunk i've never seen two people swap seats inside the car that quick in my life and he told that young girl he said i ain't getting out of this car these boys are whooping me [Applause] now let me just say this to you when the devil comes on your property you can let him ride around if you want to but you got posted signs up stay out of here you can take your lips and your tongue which is the most supernatural part of you and you can speak to the devil say get out of here in the name of jesus christ and put him on the run or you can serve him tea oh or coffee and just hang around or you can just quote what he has to say and give the devil voice you're backslid only because you say it and the moment that you disbelieve god's word let me just say this to you i have never said that cancer is greater than god i want you to know my god's greater than every cancer cell that there is in the whole wide world now paul is going to write these words not from a posh office it's going to be from a dungeon what shall we say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivering up for us all how shall we he not with us freely give us all things everything in heaven belongs to us we're not a bunch of beggars we're not sitting on the corner we're the sign we are god's children we have more authority than an archangel that's in heaven so we're not we're not roman catholics we're not begging we're his children no matter how old you are we're his children amen amen who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl sword nay and all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities nor power shall be able to separate us no things to come no height nor death or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord i've read this to you before i want to read it to you now be still and know that i'm god i'm bigger than your problem i'm bigger than your circumstance i'm bigger than your situation this is not your battle you don't have to handle this this is god's battle god will work it out all you have to do is be still and know that i am god god's purpose can never be defeated the prophet tells us there is nothing that can defeat it so how happy we ought to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the living god that there is neither things present no things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing can separate us from the love of the living god purpose of the living god what god has imagined in his mind what god has purposed in his heart [Music] to bring to pass there's no demon there's no power there is nothing that can separate us from god's immortal eternal plan it must be as god said it [Music] he cares for you just listen to this he said cast your cares upon him too many times we carry our cares your energy will run out put it in the hands of

already been taken care of the battle you're fighting's already been taken care of round your shoulders back come on church there was a man named muhammad ali most of the time he talked people into defeat before they ever got in the rink he had already whipped them with his mouth he would say i fly like a butterfly and i sting like a bee i am muhammad ali lay on the ropes let him beat him beat him beat him and he would wave to the audience matter of fact many times he'd turn around and talk to everybody in the audience and the fight was going on cause he knowed he'd done got this guy whipped and he's punching and beating and sweating and frailing and using all of his energy and in just a few minutes ali will be standing like this right here another victory another victory brother on but that's the world what about children of god just stand and have victory with the word of god oh you'll never defeat him with your flesh you'll never defeat him with your words but god gave you his words now there's a major difference between you and the world denominational system they know the right scriptures they know the right words but because you are who you are [Music] you have ambassador privileges and your words have power like angel's words hallelujah and because of your position those words have power they're like a seed a word has a seed it has a thought it was a thought and then that seed was expressed and it becomes flesh and the more you quote the word of god you abide in me and my words about and you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you smith wigglesworth would walk into his patience to pray for them and said you start quoting this scripture and you quote it until you believe it and after you really believe it get up go home you're going to be all right if you abided me and my words about in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you [Music] it's already concert i just have to care enough to believe it are you afraid of what somebody else has told you are you afraid of the doctor's diagnosis are you afraid of what the church will say to you are you afraid to stand there toe-to-toe to the devil there's some moments you've got to stand toe-to-toe and the shadow boxing is over with and the dancing is over with and it's time to brawl hallelujah it's just time to prawn cause you already know who the winner is you already know the outcome you've already read the back of the book satan loses satan's destroyed is annihilated and when there is no kings and potentates of the earth no hollywood we'll still be here want you to smile at the devil would you smile go ahead and take a smile listen take a smile break we're not having a praise break take a smile break aaron ogles be preached what sister brenda lewis wrote it's going to take a stronger wind than this you've been in some storms but right in the middle of the storm you're going to have to look at the enemy it's going to take a stronger win than this shamgar no doubt when he got down to that last one what in the world was wrong with them people what was wrong with the last 50 guys he said whipped 550. one man with a stick what was going on with the guys that were fighting samson he said wit 950 and 50 more of you think you can handle him and you got all your armor and you got all of that he's got a dry jawbone of an ass you gotta realize that that guy's got something on his side that we can't see [Music] come on you know he said tried everything against you and you keep bobbing back up he keeps putting you way down and you keep coming right back up and you've whipped thousands of demons you've jumped into pits like david's mighty men and you took the sword and you've whipped 800 men somebody sent me a note the other day said i haven't heard nothing from you lately i said i've been in a pit and i got about a hundred more devils to kill i'm gonna kill every one of them while i'm down in here i'm not gonna leave one okay you fell in the pit not a fight okay you're in a war you're predestinated for it you're built for it now fox we're not a bunch of sissies we've been pre-planned by god overcoming this age he has gave us the greatest armor that he could possibly give us he's called us he's anointed us he's elected us he's placed us in our battle now fights [Music] we're not a church where we gotta go honey now you just you know you get over your hurt feelings you just come back to church you just i'm gonna i'll help you i won't say nothing because you know why you know i'm just go we're not a bunch of hotbed plants we don't need a pacifier we're not a denominational system are you with me we're fighters we refuse to let anything knock us out we're not a bunch of drama queens if you're looking for the gossip party you've looked at the wrong church [Music] we're real fighters here we're warriors for the kingdom of god we're not interested in an easier way we are overcomers of this age [Applause] what makes our young people live right i'll tell you what a real birth to take care of that a real birth to take care of that i see some of these young girls they come into church and they're doing so incredibly well i've seen them struggle seen them struggle you understand you watched your daughter struggle but all of a sudden something took a hold let me just say when he takes a hope the struggle's over you're equipped to fight then not ashamed of your dress you're not a streamed of your conduct you don't have to be run by a bunch of peer pressure hallelujah god don't have to put a thousand people around you to keep you up you ready sometimes you'll have to stand alone in your own conviction sometimes you got to stand alone and fight thank you thank you when you think people ain't watching we are we are and the difference is him [Music] the difference is him sometimes you got to meet the challenge running from your enemy is not the answer sometimes you just got to meet the challenge got to raise your head above all the nonsense all the noise all the fanaticism stand like a real man or a real lady at the end of the day people like people that are real these children can see through a fake they can see through artificial but when you're a real christian and you think nobody's noticing generally everybody's watching and many times you will mentor others in the church and they'll never say nothing to you stay with me because somebody's watching your life [Music] anybody can be a christian when everything's good anybody can serve the lord when everything's going good but let hell turn upside down on you and you stand there and shake the devil off of you one at a time [Applause] no you're not gonna whip a thousand all in one second but just whip one and then whip the next one and then whip the next are you getting the point here brother right but it's so big just start whipping one at a time you've heard me read this to you before courage be strong and be of good courage we're believers we're god's sons we fight we don't back up nor do we back down we fight he shelters us under his wings he fights our battles he wins our wars we cast satan out with holy ghost boldness he has authorized us and empowered us to use the name of jesus for any need at any time under any condition and we believe taking him at his word by the authority and casting out satan and reminding the devil of who we are but first of all you got to know who you are not because a preacher convinced you but you got to know sure-footed of who you are when that rock left david's sling and he saw the trajectory of that rock as it hit that helmet and it crushed that helmet and that giant fell you know it's amazing earlier that morning that guy was a champion to all his people oh yeah but when he hit the ground all of a sudden their heart almost fainted because their champion is dead i got news for you my champion went to calvary [Applause] he conquered everything that could be conquered he went to hell and took the keys of death hell and the grave my champion has never lost the battle when our prophet would stand and he would go he's here i take every spirit under the sound of my voice under my control an open-air meeting hundreds of thousands of people as brother jackson sidney jackson would say even the dogs quit barking it was total steal when that prophet said i take every spirit under the sound of my voice under control don't you know the devil knew he was talking about he knew then who was standing on the stage more than a little prophet come on church oh in this age he wants to raise his head and try to be against the message after the prophet's been gone 50 years [Applause] but where was that enemy at that night [Applause] when he standed there in chicago and those preachers had laid a trap for him and he asked them he invited him which of you will come and stand against me and not one of them [Applause] not one of them not one of them what about your battle now i'm talking to you what about your battle god wants to fight your battle for you hallelujah he has declared i'm on your side the devil's wishing i had to preach the christmas message give me just a few more minutes when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of god shall lift up a standard against him god always has a response and he's always on time [Applause] [Music] the doctors that i see are very caring wonderful doctors sister connie goes to every visit and we hear it over and over again you're a miracle you're a miracle many times the news that they give us isn't news that we want to hear but we've done heard a report he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement stripes was upon him and with his stripes we are healed so we refuse to retreat with that kind of news on our side we refuse to retreat we refuse to turn around we refuse to give up i want to say it like we said it over and over again never never never never give up brother on my my situation is impossible it's because you're looking at the wrong direction that's what the devil says it's impossible i've heard some of them reports but with god all things are possible i get on a treadmill every morning and walk about 3.5 miles every day brother rhonda i want to lose some weight get on a treadmill as long as you're wishing it with a doughnut in your hand you're not gonna wish no weight away get on the treadmill what are you doing with that brother ron a lot of people only talk the game a lot of people only talk the game they're not willing to put nothing in a lot of people only want to serve god when things are good but when the bloods are flying and the battle is on that's when you've got to put action to your faith notice some scriptures behind you i'll just arm you for a few minutes in second corinthians chapter three paul says it like this not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god 12 and verse 9 says and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in mind infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me you ready isaiah 40 and verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the you shall faint and to be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount upon wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint [Applause] first corinthians 15 and verse 58 he says therefore my beloved brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abound in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord i want to remind you tonight that we serve a living god we serve an infinite god our god has never lost the case you've been fighting them all this time and he's never lost the case he's never been in a crisis hallelujah i don't know what i'm gonna do i don't know what i'm gonna do down there my children are in trouble he never had one in meetings he's never called these angels together and say hey look down there they're in trouble come on church he's always got an answer whether you're in a fire he's got the answer whether you're at the red sea he's got the answer so you might as well grab your tambourine sister rebecca and start playing it the enemies are dying [Applause] i'm sure the devil said this more than one time i never saw that one coming yeah i didn't see that one coming can you believe that just happened to us i never saw that one coming and then one stupid demon speaks up says you know he whips us every time shut up i'm sorry i'm having way too much fun up here i want you to understand tonight if i can say this just before i quit god's determined god's determined he's determined he's determined he's taken your case i went in one morning it was

so i gave him one i want to ask you who are you [Music] who are you when you can't you feel like you're all alone but if you could only look in another room there's thousands of demons that are trying
