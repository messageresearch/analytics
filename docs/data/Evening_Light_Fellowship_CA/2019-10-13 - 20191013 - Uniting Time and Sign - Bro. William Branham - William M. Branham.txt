e-tutoring praise the Lord calls me a leader you caused me to live in thy [Music] grace the Lord [Music] in thy presence o Lord calls me amen my praises Oh Lord calls me yes a man yes caused me to live amen praise the name of the Lord Amen god bless Justin thank you for your presence here and there's I guess a lot of people wouldn't bother amen but again they're ignoring the scripture where two or three are gathered there am I in the midst and really the original translation is where I have gathered two or three a man because the devil is gather a lot here not there a few here a few there to imitate God but Jesus said where I have gathered two or three in my name he said there am I in the midst so believing that he has gathered us and just believed I have the faith that he is in the midst praise the Lord that not just in the building but he's in you a man so the grace of God to help us to believe with a complete belief to have faith with faith there's no questions nature's beliefs a man with faith there's no doubt faith believes what God said in his word a man he said I'll never leave you never forsake you be with you even in yet to the end of the age so we're we don't have to go looking for Jesus amen to some time he's looking for us a man so he's lost our attention so any and he's there but he's looking for your attention he's looking for you to focus on him he's looking for you to fellowship with him a man he wants fellowship sure he does so brother I pray the grace of God that he's got fellowship with us today and and those Saints that are not here and that have traveled to pray the grace of God he got fellowship with them a man because though they leave the city they don't leave him a man because he'll go with them by the grace of God so we pray grace to those not with us we pray grace to those that are here just a few of us but thank God again the problem God said he would rather have that as I mentioned he rather have a cottage meeting with 24 people that's right they always wondered about brother Branham why he would choose and go and have a meeting there with a few people and here they want him to come over here and have a meeting with so many thousand people and no no he said I just whatever the Lord wants that's what I want a man because most preachers and avenges today prefer bigger churches bigger groups bigger this bigger that but God is in simplicity a man God as among the few again that's what he said we're where I have gathered two or three in my name there am I in the myths and most today wouldn't wouldn't even consider that God's with them that God has in them all that they're just a couple of people they're just religious der kultur fanatics well thank God Jesus was considered a fanatic a man and knowing that the following of Jesus was considered a cult even back then oh yeah because they said he was of the devil they said he was born of fornication they found all the fault they could with Jesus and the few had apostles and disciples that were following his message a man but even even with the disciples and so it is we believers today they didn't have the full revelation of what God was doing no no because to them it was a shock that Jesus would go to Jerusalem to be betrayed it was a shock to them that Jesus would lay down his life yeah but brother if it was even a shock when he picked it up again a man because they weren't they weren't expecting that no no but he told him he was going to do that he lay down his life pick it up again and he would come back to them so brothers sister as it was then so it is now in the revelation of our door Jesus Christ and we'll read a scriptures surely where Jesus is trying to highlight to them what God was doing in their day but they never recognized it a man to them it was God what God did you know back so many thousand years and God I'll tell you this to a lot of believers to still basing their faith on history they're still based a faith in what God has done but still not recognizing what God's doing a man so the grace of God be with us to help us to get into the truth get into the word to have faith so that no more questions we didn't we believe it there's no more doubt we believe it Amen yes and that's why we're here that's why we act the way we act talked the way we talk is that we believe what God is doing Oh what about what he's done well we believe that but we wouldn't we wouldn't know we wouldn't recognize what he's doing it if we didn't see what he did amen so he's recognizing the past we see him in the president a man oh he started that but he's still working on this and he's gonna he's gonna do this if that's that's what his aim is by the grace of God so brother he got a purpose when God did this he had a purpose down the road now that's the thing that man doesn't see but God wants man just to believe it do it and just trust him amen amen and then it'll come to pass in their lives by the grace of God amen so grace of God be with us we will be going into a short date by the Prophet well short I guess to our feelings it's what we would hear we'll be just maybe around just over an hour a man so that's that's not long for brother Branham but also to bring greetings to to the Saints from our brother Heber Reeves and he's in st. Lawrence and I was speaking with him on the phone and he told me to pass my greetings on to the Saints here and to thanked him for their prayers and we pray the grace of God to be with him because he has done a tremendous job in looking after our church cemetery in that area that is just off the city Lawrence I way there so any fact a friend of his told him that he said that cemetery looks like an airport because he's got if everything is so neat and tidy everything is done and he got lates even on the put the posts all around the cemetery and he got late saw the to sentence to graveyards that are there oh yeah and they said looks like an airport well it is they take their final flight from here to glory amen so I thought that was good so I pray God give them the revelation of it but our brother Timur does go up with a lawnmower that he sets on and you go through it and he'll clean the whole yard a man so he keeps it up to date and he did have an issue there because somebody apparently he doesn't know who it is but somebody had through with a vehicle they had backed into the the gate leading into the cemetery and they bent the gate but there's no way that he can find out who did it he reported it even to the police but he said there's nothing we can do about it a man so God be with our brother Eber a man as he does what he does and he's doing it for us he's doing it of course for sister Greene who is whose body is there he's doing it for his wife Eileen and I was it's hard to believe I thought it might be just a couple of years no I said this December be three years amen so we pray the grace of God that God rest their souls in glory amen and the same time god bless our brother he Burchard keeping the cemetery up and tidy amen and also to pray for the grace of God again as we I guess we mentioned in central to flan concerning to the church fire that they had there and I'm not sure it was in the ceiling or underneath the building they say it was wiring a lot of the build abilities been there for a while so I don't know exactly what happened but they're waiting for to get word from the fire department and I would say that will be after the holiday on Tuesday and also the insurance so God's grace I don't know if they're meeting today or not whether they would have to meet maybe and I in a home then they certainly can because they might have as many there as we got here I'm not sure so the grace of God be with them amen that they'll still stay with the word listen grace to help us never to get the idea that we're believers because we're in the message don't think that no no believers are moving by the Spirit of God doing what God is doing now they're caught up with that revelation Amen there into that not not just say I'm in the message and I believe the message yeah well again I gotta keep telling you so does the devil a man he's in the message he believes the message he does that's why he's come down with great wrath knowing his time is short amen so I progressed that we're going to have more faith than what the devil got he saw what God did he sees what God is doing and he knows his time is short a man so I pray that he's seeing it in you and seeing it in me and and he realized his time is short because there's a people there that's looking up there's a people there is this he's looking down but there's a bride just looking up for the resurrection of the rapture to God be the glory amen amen so thank God for what he's done thank God for what he is doing amen the Lord bless you and again the message that we're going to hear is when it was printed it was called the uniting time and sign but it has been retitled to the sign of the uniting time not just a read night uniting time and sign it is to sign the emphasis is on the sign of the of the uniting time so god help us to recognize the sign and brother the sign we need look for now is is the unity and it's the uniting of the bright a man as exactly he said we're coming together in what in in the faith and we're looking for the resurrection and the rapture looking for the marriage supper of the Lamb so he's bringing out the sign of the uniting time and brother where the bride's uniting but you can rest assured that the religious people of the world are uniting a man and we know that they'll come under the Antichrist but by the grace of God I trust were under Christ not the Antichrist grace grace grace we got to make our calling and election sure because unfortunately there's going to be many many many in the message but they're not going to make it no no the prophet knew that even before he went off to see that most of the people that professed the message wasn't gonna make it and even the older brothers and sisters back then he told brother Li Vail he said our older brothers and sisters will will go he said before the rapture why because they wouldn't have that faith but does us we have that faith of the resurrection and the rapture not a doctrine but a faith in the reality of it now the resurrection now the rapture now the bride did of the run the Prophet is say he said the rapture is going on now is we're moving in into that by the grace of God and we're being cut off by the grace of God a man is going on till finally the final phase of the catching up is the change of our bodies we're about to get a body Naqada is glorified body amen as it is written again in the word that the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them amen there's a uniting here around the word and then there's a uniting with the Saints that are gone on being the resurrection to bring the rapture by the grace of God oh yeah brother oh thank you lord a man will just read the scripture and we assure you that as as Jesus was uniting with those that are gone on and they were uniting with him so we are uniting with those that are gone on they're going to come back and unite with us in the rapture a man and it's in the word Jesus did the same thing by the grace of God so the Lord bless you turn with me to st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 17 a man so the grace of God be with us that we're going to hear what God wants us to hear we're going to see what God wants us to see amen and thank God for the opportunity after that we'll continue our fellowship as we go to our sister Amber's a man and brother Matthews for fellowship and for their fellowship physically food and also spiritual food praise the Lord so god bless them and in Matthew chapter 17 and he said and after six days or we could say six Church ages Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringing them up into an high mountain apart so God took his seat up into a mountain and it says and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was weight as the light a man consider what Jesus was experiencing here now Christ in the bride is experiencing the same thing that we are caught up and weird to have fellowship with those that are gone on and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with them a man as our brother was telling me one time not of the message and he was saying oh the dead are dead and they don't know anything well I said they do know something I said they don't know anything about this world and I said you better read it read the context and I said what they're talking about but I said the dead are conscious they're they're aware of what's going on I said well I said where did Moses and Elijah come from are they dead they were caught up where I said throw to not date their very consciousness of this dimension and I said they appeared to Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration so I said the day that I gone on in the Lord by the grace of God I said they're very conscious and I said now we know to what advisor what about the rich man when he went at the bow so he lifted up his eyes in hell being in torment a man now that wasn't the lake of fire that was that was elf with where they on the unrighteous go a man they go into a place of torment but Lazarus lifted up his eyes in the bosom of Abraham and I pray God forgive the sister that made light of it when she said oh hey bruh must have a big bosom and he and he does because his bosom was faith he made so as that has the faith of Abraham so so Lazarus had the faith of Abram and he went into that dimension where Abraham was a man but the rich young ruler went into a place of torment amen too late because he turned down the word a man he wanted it his way but not God's Way a man he was doing God a service but without God's will a man he did jesus said do this this and this he's I've done from my youth up and so on where Jesus if one thing thou lackest do you like anything one thing they like us and oh what do you want me to do he says sell all you got give to the poor come follow me a man no way again as somebody mentioned to us when we're in the restaurant the other day they said you know it's the truth he says not money is the root of all evil he said it's the love of money and I said that's right yes you're right I said doesn't say money is but the love of money is the root of all evil and he said we're living in that world well I thought myself god bless him and for and again was the manager of the restaurant that we're in and so on so that was good thank the Lord I honors and respects our faith and he's there to encourage our faith and he's and he's just telling what's going on in the world crazy world and he figures he believes to like we believe it's finished it's seeing and it is we're living in the end of all things for the world but it's we're going from time to eternity a man it's not an end for us we're going to change our dimensions and there appeared on to them Moses and Elijah talking with him amen see not just visions not just dreams and they see this they see that they saw them and they heard them a man they spoke and then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elijah as he was religious not spiritual but he was religious he wanted to make you want to make two or three denominations a man one for Jesus one for Moses and one for Elijah and why do you speak be all a Bray cloud overshadowed them and be all a voice of the claw out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him don't put the emphasis on the messenger when it comes when it comes to Moses and Elijah let's plant the EM still in the wonder pointing to Alleluia and they prophesied so many thousand years before it came to pass they were proper sign of it a man took to Israel now they came in backing back into time to meet the Messiah that they prophesied out amen Oh brothers sister it was real to them I pray it's as real to us praise the Lord this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid you're going to experience tension but be not afraid oh yeah the Christian life is the life of tension and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only God help us that we're going to see Jesus only amen and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead amen they didn't understand that maybe they thought that was going to be you know so many thousand years down the road when this Jesus they were serving was going to die physically and they would had to bury him oh no time into don't bury him you'll come out a man and it's the same as ask him saying when he spoke of himself concerning the resurrection of the Son of Man and did the same was asked him saying why they and say the scribes that Elisha must first come and jesus answered and said unto them they do Malachi for yeah but for the first coming and Jesus said he would come to introduce the first coming he would come to introduce the second coming a man that's that's clear just bear with me he I was saying you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children turns out of the Jewish fathers to the Pentecostal children but he lied to us also to come and to turn the hearts of the children now they're Pentecostal children back to the father's they may because they've gotten away from what God did 2,000 years ago so now John was there to turn their the father's to the children and they refused it now is to turn the children back to the father's a man brother sister see and he said last I and smite the earth with a curse a man so is this first coming Alleluia place the little of your son that he can just it's the first coming and the second coming a man Elijah really comes I think there's four or five times because it's the original Elijah there's Elijah and then there's John and then there's william branham and then there's the elijah to the event back to the jews five times amen and Moses is going to be there as well father God said it might be two men with their spirit it might be them or two men with their spirit he believed there was going to be two men with their spirit a man as there was in this hour with the spirit Elijah so was it back in Italy love o my Elijah he was Elijah he had he had the spirit of Elijah and so on I come on down John at the spirit Elijah and brother Branham in the spirit Elijah now there's gonna be another with the spirit of Elijah to the Jews a man praise the name of the Lord this is God's pattern this is how God does things and they said why then say the scribes that Elias relied you must first come and jesus answered and said unto them Elijah truly shall first come but this wasn't John and restore all things that was in the end time but I say unto you that Elijah is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise also the Son of man shall suffer of them those that took John one of the death they're gonna take Jesus and put him to death amen but at the same time he was plenty to another Elijah further up the road it was going to restore all things a man hallelujah amen all that was lost down through the dark ages he's going to restore by the grace of God amen then the disciples understood that he spake to them concerning that first coming he spake to them of John the Baptist amen god bless to our hearts issuer a man god help us to recognize it to have the faith a man to take our stand for what God has done and what God is doing amen in the message uniting time and sign in Brenham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville in August of 1963 a few months after the opening the seals before he got into the sermon I want to share with you just a few thoughts there that he had expressed concerning tension a man he had gone through a lot of tension he experienced a lot of tension but he also said that believers will experience tension a man and he said I was praying and he said about it this morning he said what would you do if you didn't have tension you compromise and he said just think of it tension is a part of living and it is he said that kind of encouraged me when I thought that he said have you had no tension you'd be like a rag doll and he said you wouldn't have no feelings and there'd be nothing he said you could work on he said like a husband and a wife maybe if she wants to do something and they're trying to work together especially Christians and he said then he said when you come together to find out what she's done and she and he said see the tension really brings you closer together a man and somebody tells you well said just think of the little wife that went under a lot of tension when you wasn't good or the husband went under tension when she wasn't good and he said then when it's all forgiven see he said look you you felt this you feel that but he's to see you've got to have tension that's all and just think of feelings he said what if you didn't have any feeling he said no pains or nothing what if there'd be no pain at all he said you'd have no feelings at all and if you had feelings then one of your census would be gone so he said see everything is just right any out so God just give us grace to stand up to it he said that's the thing we need the grace of God to take our stand now because to remain separate unto the Lord is becoming more and more and more challenging it's right and it's going to get even more challenging as time goes on as I said by losing our registration with governments and all other churches out there other groups are there they'll lose their registration because the government will try to force them to unite with this church or that church or some other church that's been that's been registered for so many years and years and years a man because there's so many thousand non charitable organizations registered with the government in Canada and brother if the pressure is on for more money they're going to try to to get less and less and less nonprofit organizations a man and that's why they're going to take take their registration a man so things are good tension is going to increase and increase and increase but by the grace of God the elect of God are going to stay with the Word of God a man but you're going to experience tension so he said God just give us grace to stand up to it that's the thing and he said if I just stand up with that grace and stand there and he said we know that when life is over the great ones on the other side where we're looking to go a man remember that all these things there's tension and some people tries to introduce Christianity that you're free from worry and they do not view a thing - and you're in the message you'd have nothing to worry about but I thought it is with the greater the revelation the rate of the tension and the reign of the responsibility God requires more of us than he does of the rest ain't man because he gave us more revelation and he said oh he said you had tension he said when you become a Christian or should they say there you're free from worry you don't have to be afraid of anything and you're free from tension no he says you're too you attention when you become a Christian because each of you is kind of a slop happy happy-go-lucky he said whatever it was are they're not carrying what you did when you become a Christian you're under the tension of the revealed word the Holy Ghost is there to bring bring through your word to your remembrance amen but he said when you become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am i pleasing the Lord are you pleasing God today by your attitude your spirit your motives your objectives you're wondering am i pleasing the Lord if I could hear from him it puts you on tension it puts you on your guard so after all tension is a blessing it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ amen so then Paul said and so when he had a tension or something or another he had consulted the Lord to taken away from him three times yeah Paul was under such tension the ministry is under a lot of tension and the members of the brides are under tension a man and Paul called on the Lord three times to take away the tension and God said Paul my grace is sufficient for thee a man and he went forth in the in the name of the Lord amen enduring the tension my grace is sufficient for thee and he said well then our

Matthew's the sixteenth chapter one two three now want to reach portion of this Psalm not all of it but down about to the eleventh verse which is a little over half of it and I want to analysis if I call it text before I preach on it the Uniting time and size the Uniting time star that sounds kind of complicated uniting the time uniting time that's what it is now and the sign of that uniting time in a solemn a prayer of English baby sick song fell down down here over here before pouring he preserved my soul or I am poised all thou my god save thy servant that trust in thee be merciful unto thee O Lord for our crown to these daily rejoice soul of our service or unto thee O Lord you are lift up my soul for thou Lord are good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call all deep give you a ride to my prayer attend to the voice of my supplication in the day of my trouble I will call or they'll answer or a nest youthful style will answer among the gods there is none like unto thee O Lord neither are there any words like enhances our all nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee O Lord thou shalt glorify the need for thy grief and just wonder sing thou art God alone listen L teach these are we or I will walk in our truth unite my heart you fear thy head unit ECU night my heart to fear God me I'm talkin are of unity and time side now in the sixteenth chapter of st. Matthew the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came tempting him desiring him that he would show them a sign from heaven and he answered instead of them when it is easy you say ah if will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be Lord foul weather today for the sky is really Lord o you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the time the Lord is gracious blessing to the reading of this world now we're talking of this uniting uniting paths the sign of the uniting paths these Jesus was here in this life scripture reading he was the clergy for not being able to deserve the time or the sign of the time now they have always been a great thing to the people these to be able to deserve the sign of the time that you're living they called God rides it plainly so nobody could escape it now our duty our desire can pick up from other ministers or other servants of the Lord in the Bible time like the side and north time desires Daniels Timon and so forth the different signs but I want to bypass that tonight the same time to be able but it's always been God's way to give em our natural sign of the time so that everyone would know just what time is lost and these Pharisees should have known there's half they should have known what the time was he said in another place if you would have known me you to know in my day it is very a great thing that we understand thee without understanding that what they always refers to the prophets about they did and he had understanding by vision from the law and the word of the Lord came to the prophets of old see they had understanding to the word the Lord by the Prophet and then the prophets give a sign like one man late only side for so long then turned overlaid on the other side one manís to these closing all there's many this is to show the sign that they were living him now we know that the God that made heaven verses and surah laid out his work and he would describe his hands by sign that same God lives today even so we must be for something as we see the the time that we're living in there must be something if somebody's over living somewhere Aaron they call God will never let these things happen without giving us a business side that were they would understand how here is the same today the third ecology we all read it right it's just like it was then they didn't think that it was hot they thought that they were living pretty peaceful and so this wasn't looking for no Messiah and Jesus has said that his calling would be as a thief in the night when the when the people would be unaware of his coming but there were some of the versions that went to meet him half of them had all in their life and was ready they were watching for that side and that's what I'm speaking to proxy so those who are living for the side now the side is coming these signs given by the Lord is given only to believers the unbelievers never see it they go right over the top of them and they don't see it and I just assure that an angel of God could stand on this platform tonight just as true as I'm looking to shoot I could be looking at it or you could be looking at it I could see your heart to look at it and you could see it now you know that special that's exactly the truth they saw your those halls fell down but they learned to see that light that light was right there when John stood there before the altitudes and thousands out on the back there bulge a minute and say just great man and John said himself before letter to see the Spirit of God descending like a building come down are born near the voice singing this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and nobody thought the job it was just for him you notice how vivid the side for a wise man they looked it was they were Hebrews they wasn't really engine as astronomers they were Hebrews because they were up there in that country studying astronomy to finish their education and when they was Jerusalem and knowing if they saw those three stars from each one of the first pass of hand Shannon APIs of which raised account rakesh and we've seen them stars in the big past that was a sign to them that when those stars were in line the Messiah I was always oh no where is he the born King of the Jews we saw his star in the east and have come to worship Him were heavy they know that that infant massage was laying somewhere the car of God a sign of the time they God and man were uniting together water unity when God United himself a human boss the suitable the greatest of all the uniting that ever was done with God United with manage lettuce his great pain of being caught and stretched forth his Tiffin humanity and become one unity what their peace between God and man forever how thankful we are and science was not said I just think if we made in all the astronomers of people then be there drops was the star they was a watchman what I thought top of the of the tower and he was a gif and watching he seen when a certain stars is in certain constellations as they were passing he didn't want and it was never in the scriptures or what time is it Watchmen and the Watchmen come back and told him II wonder how it was see they said time of a star is this strange that these stars were laughing in line for three men and nobody else or just exactly in line ah you can be so wrong with the scripture see when those stars become in unity your bodies themselves together in this consolation dream at the same time and you can be realities you might have knows how it's all dogs in but yours is a dog there do you you're United with the world and here is then it's absolutely life for the past once there was one when you see this sign you're not with the believers is that true I'm addressing this Jew is a believer well the unbelievers never see it and Prada a refugee with the appears on earth today too many of our clergy today who cannot read this fact the science that we're reading daily here's the tabernacle and seeing the things of every religion and seeing the handwriting in there and just ignored don't even see it all it's nothing to them at all they don't notice it now notice that ended they were here he crawled out national side when they asked him about this award size he gave him times that happened and they want to know why be the end of the world what would be the sign at the end and he's taller than many places to the scripture about national sign of our heavenly sign in the heavens and frisbee size he get in Thein Thein Sun and just constantly Oh God and when the heat old man and one taste about a national side he says when you see the nation he began to gather around Jerusalem see then we know that the time of the trial you see Jerusalem compassed about with army now before they do this got the wave heads of unite titles the straight Roman general head of United's armies together and call around after these Jews had rejected the god-given sign of the time today that's the time that Titus United his armies together and come to take the city first there had to be a uniting of God's people they kiss the world bar before the nation could unite itself against God's people you know you forget it our presiding I take these red lights down for signals and everything of the women how they do in the man how they do the churches how they show you this little group at all about half that I believe that we're riding in the ride of last word in this race the city power just before the coming carbonara cheeses uniting together and getting ready now you see the four tires you have the nation of those armies together here's one unite have been sold together embedded themselves that they would not believe to be the massage be rejecting him and turning off a crazy body and then one day we checked it the salvation that was said to them they unite themselves together to do it the whole daddy mama uniting himself together to reject the message of the hour they had to do this and then we'll give you that spend the national side come and the nation's begin to unite themselves together and tired of all this grief all his Romans the Greeks and compasseth walls of Jerusalem in those people act now and they starve to death they eat the bark from the trees Josephus agree the story is broken and eat the grass off the ground either bore one of the children that they were mad people and then when finally Titus he is sitting back upon the hills around Jerusalem and and those people have thought they were doing the will of God when they saw these armies marching in he has refused to hear that great master Lord Jesus tell them that there wasn't one and creatures calling them for they saw the side and move see they said let's havoc on the hop hop come on down and he listened to feel the luckiest article but please you Judy and pray that you're blocking not aware Zamora with service the girls in the way it's harmless the heel to be for snow and the third thing to do every cop in that position you want to get on that pre-shoot about the copters will sink is the Lord willing now it is that easy praise is that was either Jesus Jesus you indict yourself and him and not with some organization some church free you're not the Christ these shirts have you can't just like anything you've got to be positive at it still for the higher of Union now we find out that they rejected in the saw and then United themselves together involved in self belief and they're an emotion among them that if any persons receive Jesus as a prophet that they would be excommunicated from the church remember the blind boy that was sets of flies the disciples that who's seeing him or his father's mother Jesus said in this case neither but that the works of God might be done they know and you remember it they said that the father mother could not say they said they know this is our son but we don't know how with you because the jesus said that any person that the confession to be in the profits that they would be excommunicated but see the works of God WA that this party blogs that group and he said are the strange thing to me that you over here this man come from and yet you give me outside me now you can say it see that was the worst of God is this may healed and he get away land he could he could tell us the car yellow strange times in from anywhere he was the wonder works was down and he certainly saw boys for his first time in his life down suit using item self against Jesus and and against his massage ship that here's the site message we see the same vein now just a singing thing carnism is you know to destroy the church and the only way to it that is as the church has United itself you and the Council of Churches the World Council judges the to do now as you destroy the message the water amen they have turned down the world the churches has but they cannot accept it because of the interdenominational creed no matter how many pillars of file and hanging up in the midst of people how many people the Tommies things to be foretold and happens all of this signs that he promised of

showroom or if word of feathers would see somebody dying or her and hire a minister him any spiritual we could be shot for yes we can begin 10 years the federal prison for ministering any to try or

retraction somebody [Music] amen praise the Lord it's been many years since I've heard that table I'll read the book but it ought to mean more to us now than it did the first time we heard it it ought to mean more to us than those that are in 63 because we're seeing oh my as our brother was talking about politics United Nations uniting churches uniting the bride uniting but brother what would it what else would he say if he were it was to minister today concerning what is uniting brother it's not only a week that goes by or a day that goes by what we're hearing about this we're in about that you're not allowed to say anything about about the the lesbians and all they're saying about the gauge and I'll ever say anything about this group or that group why because they're all uniting together that's right and so it's like I said we a lot of what we're preaching is against the law yeah and the laws of state you're not allowed to speak it you're not allowed to record it you're not allowed to write it or print it concerning anything against any identifiable group in Canada or when it comes to that if any identifiable group in the world and around the world Western nations are uniting Eastern nations are uniting communism is uniting those with those ideas and so on and churches are uniting they are but they're not uniting in the word they're uniting just under their creeds and their dogmas they're uniting when it comes to to be able to say we want if we want to still maintain Christianity but Christianity is Christ a man when it comes to when it comes to the word they're not interested in staying with the word no no it's just there there this church or that church or this denomination of that denomination but brother sister god help us in this hour that we're going to stay with the word we're going to unite with the word not without unity with this group or that group I'm going along with you I'm going along with this one I go along with no no we're going on with Jesus amen by the grace of God so it is it is a uniting time we see that in the world but the important thing is that we see it in the right there's not many going to see it in the bright they never recognize it in in the first coming of our Lord do not recognize that in the second coming of our Lord then I Road and I recognize they didn't recognize it back then when he came to lay down his life but they they didn't unite with him no no not by any means he was the sign of the Uniting time a man he was the sign and he knew he was going to Eve's gonna give us the power to unite as the Bride of Christ and so on that's the life of his blood but they didn't recognize it no brother brother and listen where there was able they didn't recognize Abel no Cain of a recognized evil came that never honored Abel he dishonored him killed him and brother all same way all the way down through when God's been there to be a bear witness of himself through his word through his service of prophets and his ministry right all the way all the way of his sons and daughters and and the enemy is there to fight the enemy is there to destroy them oh yeah they were there to destroy the prophets they're there to destroy the seed of God he of the Old Testament any even in the New Testament a man and Jesus warned again as I preached some time ago on are you able to the drink of the cup not that one no no the cup of the revealed word I'd be able to drink of the cup of the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ because you know where this woman she went and said to Jesus I want my two sons one on your left one on your right in glory and well he said yeah but he said that's that's not for me to decide as for the father to decide but he said are you able to drink of the cup that I Drako to sit with him and his throne you got a drink of the company drink up a man and there's no oh yes we can drew that grew through them it was a very simple thing a very basic thing he said you shall indeed drink of it yeah he knew what it was but they didn't a man and it was it was to lay down their lives as he laid down his life a man the drink of the cup it was to endure the the reproach for the word as he endured it to suffer what he suffered that's what he meant are you able to drink of the cup a man and brother the the elect of God the seed of God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost as as drank of his cup amen when we said there 68 million that laid down their lives then when it comes to physically but brother even those that didn't lay down their lives physically we've laid down our life spiritually for the war for the Lord as he gave up his life so we give up ours we're not living for ourselves we're living for him and brother he didn't live for himself he lived for us and he died for us amen that's what he did so I pray the grace of God that in recognizing the uniting though we're recognizing the sign of the uniting decide for the bride a man oh it's alright to see what's going on up there what would this group is uniting that good was your ninety oh it's just absolutely sinful everything you know they're recognizing that which is contrary to the word a man but brain grace at the bride recognizes her uniting sight and as he said that the right under that sign coming together under what God has done and what God is doing it's going to bring the bride into unity and the bride you you just can't get away from one another no no and that's the truth so we could say are we really bright if this is the evidence of the bride that they're uniting together and they can't stay away from one another and my bride do I have that spirit and attitude toward my brothers and sisters in the message brother so that we're out there did this church are there they're all there they're holding together and they're defending one another denominational churches and so on I was more as the break gonna be come together and much more the bride's going to love one another he said the uniting time of the bride the church is so coming together it should create such a love among us that we could only be away from one another if we take this as the evidence of the Holy Ghost do I have the Holy Ghost we think this as the evidence that I'm bright am i bright are you bright what do you come up with what do you what is it that you that you that uniting with is it just doctrine creats this this or is it with the body the body of Christ oh the word know the words in the body are united with Christ Christ was the word in flesh and so the bride is the word in flesh brother is it's it's going beyond and when it comes to a message book and Eve it's going beyond even this book here called the Bible because now what's in there it may question them right what was in the Old Testament was made flesh in Jesus a man so what was in the New Testament is Christ in the right the word is made flesh because like I said the day is coming the hours coming we won't have no Bible we better have it in our hearts a man that that that be made flesh in you may be made flesh in me so that you become the word amen by the grace of God brother the Pharisees the scribes oh they they had the Old Testament and they had the law they had this they did this they did that oh like the rich man young rich man said he said I all this I've done from my youth up and the scribes the Pharisees did it did it did it a man as like Jesus said do what they say but don't know what they do a man because he jesus knew that it was the word a man but they they weren't doing it the way that God wanted them to do it amen by the grace of God brother it's a uniting time what God has done in the sign is pointing us to the Uniting of the bride and the bridegroom that's what we need to focus on and when we see all this groups united you there again don't focus on that turn from it and focus on the bride that dear lady that's just a sign to point you to this a man by the grace of God but there's too many still focusing on what's going on over there as I've said that time when that brother was in in our home from a certain church and I said brother I said the people in that church that you attend I said they know more about the Pope than to do about Jesus they do they know more more about politics and what's going on in the world over there and what's uniting over there then they do both the bride unity that is the absolute truth just a lot of believers they know about this doctrine to this doctrine that Darby's know what's going on out there what's going on out there but they they're totally ignorant of what's going on in the bride and the bridegroom that's right again that's when the father of God said you know there's gonna be so few that when she goes nobody's gonna know she's gone no but the right the true bride is conscious of the bright the true brightest conscious of the bridegroom a man she's on really thirsting for eternity I'm gonna thirsting for the kingdom of God she wants to get out of here she just not satisfy we just all I see this and I see that I know this is happening that's that no yeah but it's all going to go to hell it's all heading for the burning that's right so what it right out now we've seen enough we've heard enough now we want to go home yeah it's enough now lord thank you for what you've done NORs created the sign that I've seen you do in this hour for the bride Lord is creating in me a hunger and a thirst for eternity by the grace of God brother we see you know as politics is reuniting religion is uniting the different in moral groups of their they're uniting and they're getting legalized by the government's and so on now basically you can't hardly say anything against this or against a during its anything now they don't mind if you say engage if they say anything against us they don't mind that no no that shows that the devil is the god of this world he is he's in control so brother I pray grant grace that we're more caught up with the uniting of the bride and the bridegroom the earthly bride of the heavenly bridegroom than we are with what's going on in the world politically morally or in morally or religiously whatever god help us because they think in this world you got to respect everybody we do respect when it come to a human being but not necessarily what they're doing and what they're saying they're like brother Brown says concerning the woman dressed the way she's dressed shouldn't be dressed he said I can condemn the way she's dressed but I can't I won't condemn her no no but still you got to speak out against the way they dressed this where they do this what they do here and that oh yeah it's be good against those things but not they'll leave them with with the lawyers between them and God grace but I've seen him less and less pride recognizing the unit the United unity of the bride and the bridegroom grace to us he says again it's the uniting time of the bride the church is so coming together it should create such love among us that we could hardly be away from one another amazing he said you don't have to beg people to pray you don't have to beg them to worship God he said you don't have to beg him to do what's right he said they're just so in love with him he should tell that there's nothing else amen but he said there is one thing yet lagging in the church and he said we want to get that to that he said I'm right on the edge of it if you've got to do it if you don't do it he said that's just all you must do it for look the Uniting time is at hand and God is getting the church together easier to be raptured to go to the wedding supper for the great union when God a man will unite for eternity a man he said again this was 63 but in 1962 he said we're not going to to a wedding or marriage rather he said we're going to a marriage summer he were married here were united with Christ dear he'd been uniting with his bride all the way down through the ages amen - finally it's the conclusion the invisible union of the earthly bride and the ebony bridegroom amen till the bright is finished amen there's no more it may be no more bright amen then then we recognize the uniting time why because the sign the signs that we have seen which I will show you again sometime on video the signs that we have seen a man is a sign of the earthly bride and the heavenly bridegroom coming together the signs that we have seen what God has done in this hour a man restored all things planning binding the believers to to the bright to the bridegroom our Lord Jesus Christ the coming of the Lord see the Bible says always to come in the Lord the coming of the Lord and all we're waiting on the coming Lord yeah but he's waiting on you no no waiting for the coming of the Lord what do you wait for someone has already come see they're waitin waitin on the messiah 2,000 years ago but he was already there and they didn't recognize it they did to him what they what they were prophesied to do they crucified Him a man but now they crucify him again because he's here with his bride and may flesh in his bright and brother he has declared himself he's revealed himself Malachi 4 you know through that Ministry of Malachi 4 he was revealed 2,000 years ago through the ministry of Malachi 4 he was revealed to the father's and now he's revealed to the children amen to turn us back to our Pentecostal fathers and the revelation that they had 2000 years ago a man they weren't denomination no no they were experienced with with with Christ's grace grace grace brother god help us no and as he he just hinted at it here the hour is coming when you take a stand for this take a stand for that ever you glued one time you say if you pray for the people pray for somebody you still kill you they'll shoot you and they will grace brother those foolish virgins they're gonna lay down their lives it's gonna be a number that no man could number is gonna kill kill during the Great Tribulation but I pray grace that we're going to come to it but before we're killed they're going to eat you wanna take us off in a rapture yeah by the grace of God there's like I said it's a revelation to there whereas there's coming a tremendous thing upon the earth gonna test and bring out the true believers true whether you the foolish virgins grace to grace raised grace that were numbered with the few amen and he said What did he say in Malachi 4 that he would restore he's restoring back the word not just emotion or since the signs and wonders but the word amen again he see the church as received a heavenly sign astronaut a man Jesus Christ in the form of the pillar of fire and he said he was in the Old Testament then he was then he meant Saul on the road down to Damascus the same Jesus is here today and he said what does it do does it bring fear it brings love he said that's uniting one another a man a feeling for one another it brings love of God and uniting us and brings us as the body of Christ into a unity as the bride and he said that's what it's doing now this great union of God grace what an hour living there's more he said God is uniting his right she's coming together from the east and the West to north and south there's a uniting time and that's on right now well they were uniting then I must are we to be united now grace and he said what she uniting for she's not uniting for the rapture your oneness with with the believers is your readiness for the right for the rapture if you're not one with one another you're not going to no rapture no but those that are one one with one another hunger thirst where tell us with one another their rapture well yeah he said a man God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what she unites he with she's an ad with the word and the word is in your brothers and sisters of life versus paid amen she's getting ready she is the bride she's United herself with her red robe and the Red Room is the word and the church of the bride and the word is becoming sold one until the very word itself is working out the work of the bridegroom in the right the bride will be complete when she gets there the one sets a living that United themselves with the word and those that are already gone already gone did that and it all comes together and makes one great union of the uniting before going out amen amen so we're so united with one another ear it's going to bring them from that other dimension to unite with us and we're going on by the grace of God amen he talked about the Western world uniting the Eastern world uniting he talked about communism uniting again we understand too so I so much I can say what the prophet of God said over fifty years ago concerning Russia and America yeah brother we know the California is going down but it's going to get worse than that because he said there's going to come he said that certain nation got a bomb with our name written on it they said you're gonna fire it and destroy America I see America coming to that place yeah so like I said especially we got citrus here for America we have others from America well I should you better be on your guard a man you better be relieved you're gonna go visit America via be led by the spirit said you're gonna go there amen well I pray that it's going to be after the rapture he meant by the grace of God so that all the saints of God the elect of God in America it's gonna be raptured by the grace of God amen oh you never know most morning maybe the older Saints and there might go by way of the grave that's right but the young ones there'll be a few young ones there that'll be ready for the rapture not many no no not many a few so God's grace to us is my prayer amen god bless you this day amen they're saying
