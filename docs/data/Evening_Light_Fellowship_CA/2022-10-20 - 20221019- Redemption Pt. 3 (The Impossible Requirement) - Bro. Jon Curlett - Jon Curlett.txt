Revelation chapter five I feel like this is going to be a bit of a brother Mark coffee style of of service here today it's more of a Bible study maybe as we're going through Redemption and I was Blanca's home sick this evening she's been sick for a couple days so she stayed home with Samuel and Jensen so remember them and my mom's traveling home this week as well on Friday so I want to remember her but I was saying this is one of those Services you don't really want to preach because when you talk about Redemption uh so often we're caught up in what he is and the good things he's done but to really understand Redemption you've got to understand where you are when you start this process and today we're going to talk a bit about what we are without him amen and so that's maybe not the most beautiful thing to to preach on but you've got to understand that so you understand the need for a redeemer because if you think that you're good if you think that you're great if you think you're okay if you think you're acceptable then all these things then then you don't need a redeemer and then you don't need Christ you don't need the word you don't need any of these things so tonight we'll dig in a bit into that and uh so so don't don't don't worry we're gonna we're gonna settle on a high note Lord willing remember we're going to talk about what it means to be a human these days without God and what it looks like in the in this the standard that God sets and how impossible it is for us to meet those things amen so we'll start in Revelations chapter 5 verse one and this is John talking he says and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals now brother Brahm says this is the Lamb's Book of Life he says this is the title deed of our Redemption amen so whoever can read it is the one that owns it right and the scripture says that I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor an earth nor under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon amen God bless his word you may be seated this evening as I mentioned we're going to continue in our series on Redemption and I want to take a title this evening of the impossible requirement Amen in the last couple of services we talked about in the beginning and we talked about it for the Jews and we talked about it for the Gentiles and we showed our perfect existence in Eden when we are in the form of Adam and he was male and female in the same body and it was under the same mind and it was completely unimpeachable Satan couldn't touch him couldn't touch her it was it was in a perfect State and then we saw how the woman by way of a creative body the body was a byproduct and in there it allowed a division vision of the attributes that allowed a division of the minds and all of a sudden Satan saw a in the armor and he got that woman away and the husband didn't cleave to her and she didn't cleave to her husband and all of a sudden Satan got in there and he took that and he he used that to his advantage and in the end he seduced her and he caused her to fall and then she went to Adam and Adam brother bam says taking him quickly to her quickly to himself he said he what joined himself to her because God couldn't wouldn't kill them both amen so he saved her life but in doing so he joined himself with his wife and sin and and he condemned all of us and then he condemned all of us when he did that and back in the beginning we had eternal life that meant we had perfect health The Men We had perfect rest we were healthy at all times we did not age we did not wear out we did not tire and then we didn't need a medicines we didn't need all any of these things amen we did not weaken with time we were effortlessly alive back then all we knew was life life and more life amen scripture says he he says he comes that we would have life and more abundantly late well they had life more abundantly back then if you're looking for life more abundantly this was the definition of more abundantly remember as soon as we lost eternal life what happened we lost we lost that that Health we sickness came in there and we lost that rest and now we have worry and we had stress and our muscles tired and our joints gave out and we got shorter as we got older and we lost that Speed and Agility and and all the things as we grew and we aged and so we'd started a small you know in a small size and we'd peek and we'd grow maybe into our mid-20s back then maybe they peaked at the age of three or four hundred later on you know but in our days you you peek at about 20 or 25 years old and then you start to drop off and there's a slow Decay until the day that you die they didn't have that in the beginning in the beginning they had Dominion they were the Apex you know today we talk about an apex predator in the oceans it would be a an orca in the on the land it would be a polar bear a grizzly bear you know nothing can touch them and in the original World Satan's were the apex predators and not that we killed but nothing could touch us and the thing is nothing wanted to touch us everything was in harmony everything was was in in unity and and everything was for each other's good so there was no conflict there was no need for conflict because nobody needed to hurt something else in order to get what they needed they didn't eat flash back then everything ate vegetation and whatnot so there was no predation of things that were alive and whatnot amen and amen had an intelligence that was used for good because the Earth was in chaos and and God gave him spoken word authority and he gave them the intelligence to use it so that he could do what bring the Earth in out of chaos and into order and he was there to calm all things because we know that the Earth was in a mess it was in confusion and he had to bring it into an order that would help the Earth to grow and mature and to benefit from man living on it so all of these things were in a perfect Unity before this and then we lost dominion and what happened it was every man every woman every animal Every Creature for itself and all of a sudden they had to start feeding on each other and you had to take something down in order to raise yourself up right and if you didn't do that then you died and then all of a sudden it took a tumble and you lost spoken word authority and what happened when that when we all set the world went back into chaos didn't it and we see it today because the Earth is groaning and and travailing for what the manifestation of the sons of God because it's out of kilter and then it's out of its order it's into chaos and so it's waiting for us to come back into that time and we're not going to have it in time we'll have it in the Millennium and then even beyond that perhaps but we don't get it in this time this is not the time for that sort of sort of spoken word Authority because it's going to be cleansed by fire amen the same thing more cleansed by is the same thing that it's going to be cleansed by brother Brown and put it this way he says a man was made to be God did you know that he's in the image of God he's the son of God he's like him he was given a domain domain over the whole earth he Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all the other kingdoms all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made in the image of God made like God had hands and feet like God he was in the image of God now what happened because he disbelieved God's word it sent him right back out to shift for himself and everything else is Shifting for itself as well now God's trying to bring him back this is what Redemption looks like he says and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the spirit then then you begin to become a son of become a Son of God or daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you amen so this is what he's looking for is that little light to grow up and take out all the things that have been holding you back all the excuses you've had in your life and to rip those out and let the kingdom of God start to grow within you amen now what is it when he's talking about this he says when you're yielding yourself to the spirit that's fellowship with God and that's what we had in the beginning we had that beautiful Fellowship every day we had time with him and he come down in the cool of the evening and he'd talk to us and he'd fellowship with us and then brother Brad says he'd pull us up close and then he would stroke our brow and he'd lay us down to sleep and we'd go have a sweet rest and then wake up in the morning and do it over and over and over again we had that perfect fellowship with him but as soon as that Fellowship was broken what's the first thing that set in fear because all of a sudden now we were hiding from the presence of God rather than running to the presence of God it wasn't just fear It Was Fear of him and what came with that was shame because we knew who and what we were now and they knew that they were naked they knew that they had messed up and it caused a separation it caused a division in their fellowship and so they felt shame and disgrace for the first time amen they felt loneliness they felt incomplete when they left that Garden I guarantee you there was a longing for something that they used to have that they knew they couldn't get anymore amen they had been there and they lost it and that loss would have been so great honestly I don't know how Adam lived to be as old as he did any of you think grief would have just destroyed them to know the pain and and hurt that they had caused and then to have the loss of that Fellowship you had with almighty God every day right to have Christ come down and spend time with him day in and day out and now you don't have anything you can't hear the voice you can't you can't feel that sweetness that softness completely gone I don't know how they did it amen and what happened what they lost the true they lost the true love that was there and what replaced it was what the filth of love that is sensual right and that's what they had to go back to now now they couldn't have that love in its purest form but they were stuck with something that was at best a poor equivalence that had led them down this path in the first place right and they what now they were left the worst thing of all and that's they were left to the leading of their own minds and their bodies desires and that's where we stand today without the Holy Ghost is we're led by our own minds we're led by our own desires we're led by the things that we think are right and it never leads us any place good and all you have to do is look around us and you say well we have technology and and we we've made things better and now we can support we just crossed 8 billion people on the planet did you know that we can support eight billion people by technology today but guess what we're dying of more and more crazy things than we ever have right people have more and more mental disorders more and more stresses families are broken up right we're more beat up by the time we're 60 than I think we used to be because we've added so much that is destructive to us in all of the creative things that we've done it hasn't led us to a greater life it's just led us to a higher stress level he says in the Garden of Eden there were two trees one was knowledge and one was life and as long as men eat off the tree of life he had everlasting life the first bite he took from the Tree of knowledge he separated his Fellowship from God and every time he takes a bite yet he destroys himself he bit off gunpowder look what that does he bit off automobile off the tree of knowledge it kills more of his comrades than all the wars does he's got a hydrogen bomb bit off now I wonder what he's going to do with that God don't destroy nothing man destroys himself by knowledge that's what we're saying today they say it this is back in the early 2000s I think they said knowledge was doubling every six months I think we're up to about four months now where everything we know doubles can you imagine you can't keep up with it anymore there's no such thing as a subject matter expert anymore because there's too much to know you can't know it all you can only know the narrowest of narrowest of things these days and be an expert in those things because knowledge is increasing and it's supposed to scripture says the knowledge would increase and increase and increase and increase we're there we're there but I would say and when a man went off the tree of life to eat the tree of knowledge he always tried to figure things out from then on he never has got straightened out yet for all of that for 6 000 years of trying to straighten ourselves out we keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again we go around and around the mountain of our own leading and our own failures and we come to the same point in the same gate and we keep walking through it time and time again he says he never has got straightened out yet so we might as well go back to the tree of life and just believe is that right he's saying maybe you ought to give it something else a try Church now hopefully we've been doing this for at least the last 2000 years amen as Believers after the you know the day of Pentecost and these different things but he's saying leave your knowledge behind because it's not got man anywhere they just keep destroying themselves amen and we know that after this we were as lost as lost could be there was a flaming sword what is the sword always in the scripture it's the word of God and the word of God was a flaming sword it was the law of God and it was holding us back from his presence and it was holding us back from the Tree of Life which is Christ himself the word because he said the day that you eat thereof of the tree of knowledge the day you disobey is the day you die and God's word can well it has to hold us back right he can't disobey his word he can't say it and then say okay I understand it was okay no no the word had to hold us back because the word said the day you do it the day you die and what is death death is first and foremost separation from God Amen we look at death as when we lose the the breath of life and and that's true as well but the day you die is the day you're separated from God because that is the Tree of Life Christ is the Tree of Life the day you're separated from him you have no access you're going to die you're going to lose your breath but you've lost what life itself which is his presence amen and you and I never got a chance to prove ourselves did we Adam messed up and by Adam I mean the man and the woman combined they messed up it's their fault it's not our fault it's their fault if we get over on the other side we can go to them and say it's your fault we didn't get a chance to prove ourselves we're here because of Adam the scripture says it it says wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed where there is no law the law is the only thing that can judge you and if there's no law then you can't sin but he says nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses so the law didn't come to Moses but he says nevertheless men kept dying why he says even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression so even the ones that didn't do what Adam did he says they still died why who is the figure of them that were to come he's talking he says who is the fear of him that was to come he's foreshadowing a second Adam the last Adam that was going to come amen but why did we die even if Adam didn't even if we don't do what Adam did even if we're not guilty of that because our birth is wrong our birth is completely wrong and we'll get into that Lord willing in the next service or two Jesus had to come by a different birth and we've all got to come by the same birth that Jesus did which was what by the overshadowing of the holy spirit because that was the way it was supposed to happen in the first time it was supposed to be an overshadowing of the holy spirit that would bring a birth and then it wasn't supposed to be by sensual desire so they were in a wrong birth we're being born the wrong way and now we're not born by the spirit of God but we're born by the spirit of man we're born by the will of man and that's always going to be in the wrong so we're born in sin we we have that Saint says we're born in sin shaped at iniquity and come to the world speaking lies that's not a scripture but we say it because you can put three scriptures together and kind of make it that way but the law is what condemns us and yet even before that he says look we all died before that because our very nature that we're born under the very way we're born is sinful in and of itself so as soon as you're born you're a sinner you're lost you're falling you're not in the condition that you were supposed to be in the rev the original uh plan of God Amen but the simple fact is this when you're outside of the presence of God you can never be good because it's his righteousness it's the only one that's good amen our righteousness is his filthy rag so if we're looking to be good as God is good you've got to have God with you you've got to be in his presence that's the only thing that's going to keep you good so no matter who you are no matter who you're born to no matter what your family is no matter who your pastor is what church you're raised in the simple truth is you cannot please God you cannot meet the standard of God and you cannot be in the presence of God on your own Merit thinking or actions or bloodline you can't do it there's nothing that we can do that deserves us to be placed into his presence again the natural orders for things to decay that's the way it's funny how science will will put forward Evolution where things grow and increase and yet everything else decays but they've got one law one rule that goes opposite that and every other rule leads to decay but natural order is to Decay for us to get lower and lower and worse and worse as time goes on and that's what we see why because we're out of the presence of God Amen and even when we think we're gaining something valuable we're so short-sighted because we can't see the long-term effects of it and you look at everything from Electronics you look at everything from from media you look at everything from from Brother Brown says Automobiles and gunpowder it was a way to control it was a way to save and then it turned into a way to kill and then it started killing everything and hurting everything and all of a sudden the thing that you think is so great is the thing that's destroying you you look at the pollution problems we have now Automobiles and internal combustion engines and all these things they've revolutionized the way we live guess what we can have bananas in Newfoundland in February because of that but at what cost at what cost see we never see we never see the big picture and God sees it all and he's allowed it because it's going to bring destruction on the earth amen the ultimate effect of everything we do is that it destroys us that's what the prophet of God saying brother Paul afontaine said something a while ago and I believe it because it's backed up by the word he said everything Satan offers you has a plan behind it see what that means is you can't take what Satan offers you at face value amen because what he'll throw you what will he throw you he'll throw you a bit of music that you like right and you say well it's just a song it's just a catchy tune it's just pleasing to my ear what could be wrong with listening to one song then you listen to a second second song and then you start watching them on YouTube and you start to see the clothes that they they wear and the moves that they do and you start to see the the things that they enjoy in life and all of a sudden the spirit that's on them starts to come on you and now it's not just what it's not just a song anymore it's a lifestyle it's an addiction amen and it's something that that draws down deep inside of you and it's a demon possession that happens in those things first time maybe it wasn't but the second time it starts to go in a little bit and a little bit and a little bit more because what it's a seducing spirit it's always a seducing spirit and guess what behind all of that is one thing a thief that is there to steal to kill and to destroy and I guarantee you if we were honest with ourselves and we go back to times where we've been fooled and you look and you say he stole something or he tried to he killed something and he tried to kill something or he destroyed something or you destroy tried to destroy something didn't he he's always got an agenda behind that little Hook when you're fishing for for fish you don't show him the hook do you you show them the thing that they think they want and then there's a hook inside it and that's what they don't see is the hook that's buried inside Satan has a hook inside of everything that he's offering you today don't think that there's some innocent thing that Satan can offer you that doesn't have a hook inside of it amen now we're talking about the law because the law is the thing that condemns us and I'm not going to read all of this I'm going to I've got the scriptures here but this is the original Law these are the Ten Commandments and I'll read only the bolded ones and this is Moses up on the mountain and God comes down he gives them the law brother Branham said they chose the law they said God you can talk to us and then God comes down it scared him so bad he says you go through a prophet and God then had to send a lot to them because he couldn't what go one-on-one with them he says the worst thing they did was they chose the law over a direct relationship with God and he says Thou shalt have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy honor thy father and thy mother Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not commit adultery brother Joe prayed one time many times in the presence I believe of a school teacher and he said Lord help me not to commit adultery because he had heard that you shouldn't do it praise the Lord that it was at least drilled into his skull to say don't help me not to do the things I'm not supposed to do even if I don't understand what it is amen amen Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bearish false witness against thy neighbor thou shall not covet that's the 10 basic Commandments that God gave them and then he gave them eighteen hundred thousand million bazillion after that but these were the main ones now maybe you're superhuman and you could look at that and say as long as I can remember I've never done that because guess what there were people that made that claim and the scriptures weren't there people made that claim in the scriptures but yet what was it what did you do before you remembered do you remember everything that you did listen I'm 43 and I can't remember what I did last week sometime do you think I could sit here and say that I haven't done any of those well I definitely know I stole because I got caught so I can't say I didn't do that can't say I've never coveted anything now may not have been my neighbor's wife thank the Lord but guess what cars money vacations clothes whatever it might be you pick your poison I don't think any of us how many of us have always honored your father and your mother I can't raise my hand to that by no means there's been absolutely times where we talk back where we talked about them where we put them down where we criticize them behind their back come on we've all done it so there's nothing here that any of us should be able to say I've done that at every time in my life but yet there were a few people in Scripture that did including the Apostle Paul he said in Philippians 3 6 he says touching the righteousness which was in the law blameless so Paul now looking back when he was Saul as a Pharisee said touching the righteousness which was in the law so he said according to the law of Moses my life was blameless wow that takes something to say something like that I don't believe anybody with the new birth could say it and we know Paul never says it after he got the new birth but guess what before you get the new birth there's a lot of people that sit here and say listen my life is great I'm good I don't need anything I'm a good person good kid good daughter good son good boy good girl good message believer right sure listen Luke 18 somebody came to Jesus about it a certain ruler asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good not as good save one that is God thou knowst the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these have I kept from my youth up we've got another Saul here don't we I've done it all Lord and guess what Jesus never challenges him now does that mean he did it does that mean he was perfect no because Jesus didn't have to prove it look at the next one he says now when Jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lack us thou one thing listen he doesn't have to point out all of your lies if he can point to your one fault because guess what he had more than one fault but he pointed to the fault the fault and guess what most of us have the fault we got an area that we don't like to admit that we don't like to give to God he says yeah one lack is thou one thing so all that thou Hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me I don't have there but the scripture says and he went away sorrowful because he was very wealthy what he couldn't give it up Jesus knew where his treasure was now listen I believe that young man was good as we would call good I believe he was sincere as all get out but he got an answer he wasn't expecting and that's when we know whether we're really sincere or not is when we get the answer that we don't like what are we going to do with it that's a tough that's a tough place when you get an answer that cuts you to the core that goes right to the thing that you value most and God says give it up will we do it will we do it that's the test he says you may have done all that not going to challenge you on it but here's what you need to do to follow me and he couldn't do it he walked away sorrowful brother Bram says the the the parable of the rich man remember with the barns that he built over and over again he said Soul take my ease and uh and then God said to him thou fool thou full know you not that your soul will be required of you this very night and he woke up in hell amen it's a scary thing to turn down your grace because what you're too close to it too close to something else that won't allow you to serve the very God that's trying to save you amen I'm not trying to take us down this evening but this is serious it's serious because you've got to recognize your natural place and your position outside of that Redemption process yeah because if you don't see this you don't need a Redemption process and you don't need a redeemer and where you're going to go you're going to head the rest of the way that the world is going amen but if you look deeper into the law of Moses we cover those Ten Commandments and I think most of us admitted I had at least three people that agree with me that we couldn't do that but then we look into the law of Moses and now God starts to set laws for your heart and your mind so now we're moving into what we call thought crimes and guess what none of us can say we've had the perfect thought life can we he says in Leviticus 19 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart guess what I've done it many many times and guess what my brother has hated me many many times in his heart absolutely scripture says the brother is given for adversity and I I think there's that's a that's a two-sided coin because he's given to you for adversity to cause make your life a living hell but then he's given to you four times adversity because when you get two brothers staying together they can take on anybody so you fight in the backyard and you and well actually you fight in the front yard too but normally if you're in the front yard you'll take on all comers right but they'll cause you adversity in the backyard won't they thou shall not hate thy brother in thine heart Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin about me saying if if you've got a problem with somebody you got to Grudge with somebody this is the next service he says Thou shalt not Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on the Lord so he's saying if you've got a grudge against somebody you don't let it linger he says you go there and you get it out you get it out you get it out of your system whether you're right or wrong we'll find out but you get it out don't let it linger in there because it'll start a root of bitterness and that's definitely not the sign of God in your life amen but he says you can't hold that in your mind you got to get it out but he says if you're holding it in your mind you're guilty you're guilty of holding The Grudge listen if I hurt brother Matt it's not up for me to make it right if I don't know about it he's got to let me know if I've done something to offend him if he's bearing a grudge because of something I did he's got to come to me because guess what I'm pretty Clueless so he's got to come to me and make it right and that's what he's saying you got a problem with somebody you got to let them know and you got to go let that give them an opportunity to make it right but in the meantime it's a sin for you to hold it in so you're not allowed to hate your brother let's add sisters in there right let's put your neighbor next to you you can't do it to any of them you can't hold grudges if you do then you're in violation of the login amen so the law was not just about how you did things on the outside and how your life looked but it was now the way you were thinking on the inside now that's a scary place to be because you know your thoughts and I know my thoughts and guess what they're not always Godly are they he says listen that's no different than thou shalt not kill it's in the scriptures right you weren't allowed to do it and then Jesus now he comes and he judges the ministry for his days by the very things that we're talking about here in Matthew 23 because what what is Jesus doing I love what Jesus did and I was talking to someone the other day and he says and we were talking about this this scripture and he says Jesus is coming here and he's letting them see the way God thinks about things it's not just law what Jesus is talking about here he's talking about the way God sees things and Jesus says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you they tithe a mint in that East and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these are you to have done and not to leave the other undone so he says you should still do the tithing on everything that's great that's what you're supposed to do but by all means you better be doing these other things as well he says you blind guides which strain at a net and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisee cleanse verse that which was is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also can you imagine the steam coming out of their ears as they are publicly being addressed this way with Jesus taking the height off of them is what he's doing you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you are like occurs why did a deed appear beautiful outward but within are full of Dead Man's Bones and of all uncleanness he's calling him out even so all even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the simplest curse of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets he says wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets fill you up then the measure of your fathers you serpents you Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell they spent all their lives living perfect lives as far as the outside looked and in one Fell Swoop the Messiah comes and he completely shreds the life that they're living and he says what you've been living he says is a life of hypocrisy because inside is dirty while the outside looks so good right Jesus in a few minutes walks up and he diminishes their righteousness to nothing he says it's not even worth talking about it's like Graves full of dead men's bones and uncleanness that's pretty gross guess what we're no different our righteousness is his filthy rags older people look that up what that means it's disgusting disgusting okay that's where we fit in listen to what prophet of God said about this scene he says do you know all those Pharisees and Sadducees everyone was very Pious and religious people how they loved god with their hearts they thought and failed to see that innocent one the Son of God to recognize him to be the Son of God and yet they were very religious is that right very Pious very scholarly know of the Bible better than any of our Scholars today they had nothing to do but set there through their generations and serve the Lord their entire purpose was to serve God he says and yet they thought they loved God they thought it he says in this case many of the scholars of those days very culture men in the scripture that is in their own theology the Pharisees and Sadducees not men of bad reputation but men of good reputation men that must live lives above reproach to hold their office in the house of God they were men who had to be born out of a certain lineage of people before they could become a priest and their fathers had to be priests before them he says but yet it is possible for a good cultured man very scholarly in his Bible teaching yet to be an unbeliever now I'm talking to message Believers tonight and guess what we can be in this exact same boat can't we because what raised in a message home raised by message parents raised with a good pastor raised in a good church it's been here for 42 years good good good good check mark check mark check mark check mark very Pious very knowledgeable in the doctrines and scriptures of the message right we know everything we're supposed to know he says yet to be an unbeliever in all of that for I do not expect tonight that we have many men in America tonight that could compete with the scholarship of those Priests of that day for they were learning men and they had to be found blameless when it comes to morals they knew their scriptures just like they know catechism today but yet in all this it's possible that men could be ever so sincere and be ever such a Bible scholar and yet be wrong in their teachings he says for approves that they could be so it's a warning for us amen not to sit here and say because I know the truth I am a part of the body of Christ listen everybody that sat under Jesus ministry that heard him knew the truth there are many that accepted it to a certain degree but there was only 120 went up on the day of Pentecost out of the thousands and thousands and thousands that he fed and that he spoke to and that he preached to and that he healed and did all these things only 120 went up on the on the day of Pentecost 10 days before that's it that's it don't think it's going to be any different amongst us there's going to be lots of us sitting there listening by God's grace I hope this is the one church that doesn't have the three kinds of Believers in it you know we all want to believe it we all want to believe it but guess what every church has had people go away right every church has had people fall away and guess what we're believing that they'll come back in many cases but guess what not all are called not all are chosen it could be the way that we put it right listen now Jesus comes after all of this and after we have the law of Moses and we have the the outward acts and then we have the thought crimes and all of those things and then Jesus comes behind this and how he says I'm going to do even I'm going to make it even harder for you right Jesus comes and he shows the absolute inability for us to live a life that would ever please God you know it's interesting to me that brother Brown's talking here about these men they had to live uh lives of perfect morals and their security was in their life that they lived that's really where their security was they believed that their righteousness was enough to get them across the line right and guess what we see that in every instance in scripture we see it in the Pharisees and Sadducees we see it in Saul before he came Paul the only people that believed they were good enough were under an antichrist spirit that's hard isn't it but they were under an antichrist Spirit the ones that consider themselves blameless were the ones that crucified and crucified Christ and persecuted the church everyone else realized they weren't and they're the ones that could come in but the ones that thought that they didn't need anything else they were the ones that were under an antichrist spirit and they thought that they were righteous enough to get in and they looked down on everybody else let it be a lesson to us if we think we're living pretty good lives listen it's never going to be good enough to please God look at Matthew 5 as Jesus is talking now he says think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets I'm not come to destroy but to fulfill that's a Redemption scripture right there but watch what he starts to do here now he says reverely I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one John or one Tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven so he says if you teach men to do the Commandments and you break a little commandment he says you're the least in the Kingdom but least you're in the Kingdom he says but whosoever shall do it and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven so the one that can live it and teach it that's the one that's going to be great in the Kingdom he's looking for a life amen not just words and he says for I say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven listen the Pharisees were blameless Paul said blameless they believe themselves to be blameless and he says you've got to go higher than blameless how do you go higher than blameless how do you get any better than the the righteousness of the Pharisees and the Sadducees okay tell us in the next verse this is what exceeding the righteousness of the Pharisees and Sadducees looks like verse 21 you have heard it said of them in the old time Thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill you shall be in danger of judgment so he says you think it's simple this is how this is they say thou shalt not kill listen to this he says it's so much bigger than you think but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa that means empty-headed stupid dim-witted or idiot anybody ever called somebody that you're in danger both of you he says shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou full shall be in danger of Hellfire now guess what I have called people fools absolutely according to this I'm in danger of Hellfire because I don't suffer fools gladly I'm glad he suffers me though he says therefore if thou bring thy gift to The Altar and remembers that thou brother had thought against thee leave there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift so you remember you got to make something right brother Brandon would say you don't go to communion with something again if you got something you've done wrong to somebody he says you make it right before you go to that communion table right he says first we reconciled then come off for that gift agree with thine adversary quickly whilst Thou Art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary delivered thee to the judge and the judge delivery to the officer and thou be cast into prison verily I say unto thee they Thou shalt by no means come out thence to thou has paid the uttermost farther says you have heard it was said of them of the old time Thou shalt not commit adultery brother Joe this one's for you what he says you think this one's easy because you just don't have to touch another woman but he says listen I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart Jesus said you're so worried about the act and he says I'm looking what in the inside I'm looking at your heart I'm looking at your mind if you're thinking about doing it you've already done it and you'll be judged accordingly remember brother Branham It's Kind of a Funny Story remember he said in that he was in the presence of God and and he had thought he was doing pretty good and he says the only thing he could say in that presence was I didn't commit adultery the physical act because guess what if you're a red blooded male you've done this at some point in your life simple fact simple fact remember brother Branham had a cross in his automobile and he told the brother he said I'm a red blooded man too right it was the guard what the thoughts that could go through his mind if the wrong type of woman walked in front of him then he goes on here if you're right I have offend me in these different things then he says and it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement so Moses out of the hardness of their hearts he said to them later he allowed you to have a divorce he says but I say unto you that whosoever shall put his wife away his wife save him for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whoever whoever shall marry her that his divorce commits adultery as well so now they used to be allowed to do it and he says no no there's only one reason you're allowed to do it and if you've done it otherwise then you are also in transgression of the law he's taking them to the big picture he's taking them to the way God looks at things amen he says again you've heard that have been said of them at all time Thou shalt not forswear thyself but Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thy knows but I say unto you swear not at all either by heaven for it is God's Throne neither by the Earth for it is his footstool neither by Jerusalem for is the city of the great king he goes through all these different things let your communication be yeah yeah they says you have heard that it has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for the tooth this is literally the law of Moses we're going to read it in a little bit and he's saying listen you think that whatever you do to somebody they have to do back and whatever they do to you you get to do back to them he's saying this is the law and this is what you you think you're supposed to do but what's he doing he's setting them up for what the gospel that's coming the law of Grace the law of Mercy the law of long-suffering all Ten Thousand Angels could have destroyed them where they were but he stood there and he let them do it over and over and over again for our sake he says if any man will sue the at the law and take away thy coat let him have that cloak also for whosoever shall compel thee to go Mel go with him Twain in those days a Roman could compel a Jew to carry his load for a mile and it was the bane of their existence because guess what you might have something to do and you're walking down the road a Roman Taps you on the shoulder hands is Big Box to you and says carry this a mile and Jesus says go too thanks Jesus didn't make their day I'm sure when they said this one give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow the etern not thou away you've heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you he says you've been told but I see you've been told but I say you've been told but I say what's he doing now he's expanding he's magnifying the law again he's letting them see it the way God sees it but I say unto you love your enemies bless them the curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you wow why because this is what he's going to do for us listen he's not just giving them words to condemn them but he's showing them that he's going to do the very thing that he's telling us to do as well this is how you fulfill it as you go all the way to the very mind and intent of God that's behind the law he says that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye I love it when I when there's loving people around that's great it's easy to love people that love you he says do not even the publicans do the same Republicans were the worst of the worst back in those days it says even the publicans like people that like them so what's so big about that guys and if you salute your brethren only what do you do more than others do not even the public and so that was probably the worst insult you could tell the Sadducees and the Pharisees was that guess what the way you act Republicans even do that because they thought they were so much higher remember that one he talks about the the man the priest is standing there saying I'm so glad I'm not like that Publican over there he says the way you guys act he says just like the publicans for all of your righteousness he says you act just like them but what does he say remember he said your righteousness had to exceed the Pharisees and the Sadducees he says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect what does Jesus say he raises the bar and he says be like God is and guess what I don't think any one of those Pharisees could raise their hand and say yep my life is just like gods as as high-minded as they might be none of them would ever dare say I'm as righteous as God is I don't think they had that arrogance but that's the requirement is to be as he is because that's what Adam and Eve were they were as he was they were in his presence because they were holy they were spotless they were pure they were of the same mind they were of the same nature and so without that there's no hope there's no hope I remember you know when I got saved or the I say saved the night I gave my heart to the Lord and it was it was such an amazing thing because I had a pretty high opinion of myself And yet when that presence of God came in and I knew I had to give my heart to him and that pull was so completely compelling and as I went up and it took 45 minutes if I remember correctly give or take from the moment I left my Pew to the moment that the brothers laid hands on me and in those 45 minutes I couldn't stop crying you know why because I saw myself in comparison to him rather than in comparison to the people around me and that's where we've got to end up is because if we sit here and guess what some of us like it or not are are wheat that give 30 fold some of us are 60 and some 100 and it's really easy for the hundredfold to compare themselves to the 30 and say guess what I'm good and guess what you can be kind of a 30-fold even before you give your heart to the Lord you can be a good kid you can be a good citizen you can come to church Faithfully you can be respectful to your parents you can get a good job you can stay away from the things of the world and you sit there and you say I'm pretty good but guess what I was pretty good I was still doing things I was still listening to country music and some rock and roll and this and that and the other things some little things but I was pretty good but guess what in that presence I was filthy as filthy could be and all you could say was God have mercy and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry not for what I did for what I was if you think this is about what you've done you've missed the point because what you'll do is you'll go around and you'll go looking and trying to remember the things you've done that were wrong and you've not realized that you are just wrong that you are in your nature your very birth your very flesh your everything about you is wrong wrong and that's why you repent yes you repent for the things you know you've done wrong yes you need to go make them right if you have to but repentance is because of what you are not just what you've done and that's what it was it was so magnified to me and it was so so completely obvious that in his presence and by comparison to him I am as dirty as dirty could be absolute filth smut disgusting dirty nothing nothing to compare to him nothing and in that presence I could never that's why brother Brown says in that presence you can never condemn another man or woman you cannot condemn another brother or sister you can't carry a grudge you can't carry a fault in there because all it does is it magnifies your errors and faults and in that it magnifies them to such a level you can't sit there and say well sister so and so but brother so and so or I'm better than them no no no it's just you and him listen when you're in the chamber it's just you and him there's nobody else in there anymore amen and so I'm sitting in there and I just couldn't stop crying because you are unworthy remember we read the first scripture we said it looked over all the Earth above the Earth in the earth and below the Earth and guess what not a man was worthy that means Humanity that means not a sister was worthy either nothing was worthy to open the book nobody could take the title deed of redemption and open it up and say this is mine this is me couldn't even see if your name was in there nobody could do it none was found worthy I believe this is my personal opinion I believe that's why more people don't have the Holy Ghost today is that they have repented for what they've done rather than what they are because if you don't repent for what you are you don't need a new birth and if you don't get the new birth then you can't even see the kingdom of God much less be a part of it amen repentance comes because you realize how Fallen you are your very nature this flesh everything about it is Fallen it is no good it needs to die it needs to die amen that's why you repent when we look over the law and we've read all the things that God said not to do and it's harsh it's a hard law and it's impossible to follow but guess what the penalties are even worse look at the first law in Genesis 2 he says but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat it for in the day that thou eatst thereof Thou shalt surely die the first penalty for the first law was death and guess what it stayed the same ever since it has been death death the first law said you'll die and after that every other law was death or some form thereof that was very very painful whatever you did to somebody they got to do back to you if you damage their horse they got to damage your horse if you hurt theirs they got to hurt yours if you took off their arm they got to take off your arm if you killed somebody then somebody got to kill you listen the scripture says in Exodus 21 if any Mischief follow then Thou shalt give Life For Life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound and straight for strike you got what you gave you got what you gave how many times would we be dead if we were if we were in that boat not because we killed somebody but we'd be so beat up from all the things that he had a had a line on us for that we'd be wounded and beat up and everything all the time If he if we were judged based on what he saw now not just what we saw in each other brother Mark shared a story with me that's in the scripture I'd never read it before and it showed how serious the law was because we're inclined to give people a pass we're inclined to do that generally we say it's usually not that bad now you kill somebody that's pretty bad but everything else we're tending to be a little bit lenient you know give them Grace especially in the case of ignorance if you know somebody didn't mean to do it if they were innocent in their intent or they're ignorant in what they did you say oh now you know don't do it again guess what the law had no room for ignorance and the law had no no room for I didn't know about it I didn't mean it that way that's not what I intended to do it got out of control the law had no recognition for those excuses or ideas numbers 15 says while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day and they found they that found him Gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregations so he wanted some sticks to heat up his food probably now how many of us would say he just wants a hot meal let's let him go that's what we'd say isn't it they put him in the ward because it was not declared what should be done to him and the Lord said unto Moses The man shall surely be put to death for Gathering sticks on the Sabbath all the congregations sell Stone them with stones without the camp and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the Lord commanded Moses this is the law we don't want the law everything was death death maiming Stripes lose lose pain pain pain pain pain the law condemned us and none of the results were ever good for somebody that was judged under the law the two or three Witnesses you died death death death death death death death death Death that's all that followed under the law amen listen all he wants is a warm breakfast and he dies because of it that's how harsh the law was there's no Grace under that there's no reason old fella he had nobody to help him he forgot no you did it you died that's harsh I know this isn't the most fun thing to listen to but the thing I want you to recognize is under this we had no hope no hope of what fulfilling it and no Hope from getting out from under it we had no hope this was a hopeless we were a lost cause if we had to stay under this for there because what the law could only condemn the law is only there to condemn it's not to set you free it's to condemn you that's it the only reason we have laws is to what judge somebody to give them a penalty it's never to give them life is it it's always to penalize them it's always to cause them to hold them accountable for what they do then we get over in James 2 10 he says for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he's guilty of all thanks James you mess up one you messed them all you're guilty of them all so guess what brother Joe you may not have committed adultery but if you lied just once it's as if you committed adultery too ouch like I said there's no Grace under the law you died under one law you didn't have to break them all to die under there you just had to break one so James says you break one you break them all it doesn't matter you're going to die under it Romans 3 23 says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God guess what all includes us all every one of us all of humanity every man born of a woman as the scripture says amen you could maybe live a life perfectly and yet your thoughts would deny you access to the presence of God because your thoughts will get you every time your emotions will get you every time because you can't control them you can't control it you can control your actions but you can't control what's going on inside your head so often so you're going to be hooped no matter what amen listen you pay your tithes and offerings Faithfully attend church and you have one wrong thought and it will deny you access to the presence of God under the law that's how that's how sad it is amen and what is it that's death to be outside of the presence of God that's death and so the law just takes you outside the presence of God time and time and time again the church age book in the in the Ephesian Church age brother Brian says to him that overcometh will I give to Eid of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God what a thrilling thought is this this is beautiful because you remember the Ephesian Church age is the first one and the first thing we have after Christ leaves is we have access back to what the Tree of Life so first thing he restores is access to the Tree of Life what is it it's Christ it's the Holy Ghost in our case that's the word made flesh right it's the spirit of God it's the life of God inside of us he says right here you get access to the Tree of Life if you overcome what a thrilling thought is this that tree of life in the Garden of Eden which could not be approached unto because of the fall of Adam is now given to the Overcomer the Flaming sword of the Guardian Cherry cherubim has been sheathed but it was not sheathed before its blade was Bloody with the blood of the Lamb he says let us meditate upon this truth a while as we consider why the tree was denied to Adam and his descendants but now allowed again he says God's intention for his creation man is to express his words in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed that's true is it not but did Adam live by every word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then there are those Moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that Prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in Anger to obey the word what got him anger something inside caused something outside to go wrong he says there was also David the great king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart and he failed by adultery when he was tempted Great Men great examples listen Moses is the greatest of the Great and David's the one that God said is a man after my own heart and yet each and every one of them failed great prophets great rulers great Kings great warriors great Believers great Overcomers I'd love to have the life of David I don't want the life of Moses but I'll take David I identify with David but yeah he failed even with a heart like God's Own Heart he still failed amen every single one of them listen if David couldn't do it what hope do we have if we're in the same condition as David's in we have no hope amen look at the Apostle Paul now this is in Romans 7. Romans 8 is the great chapter Romans 7 is the the realities of The Human Condition Paul says for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not that do I not but what I hate that do I so he said the things I want to do I don't do it and the things I hate I do them this is the Apostle Paul speaking if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not he says wanting to do good isn't power not powerful enough to make you do good amen and if there's one thing you learn outside of the of the power and presence of God is that you can have all the desire to do good in your life and it'll never come to fruition until you get out of the way and let him do it for you amen it's never going to happen you don't have enough in you to make that change because your Nature has fallen and you'll keep going back to it and back to it and back to it we're destructive by Nature Paul says verse 19 for the good that I would I don't do it but the evil which I would not that I do he's saying I don't do the good but I want to but I do the evil that I don't want to and that's what I end up doing and it's frustrating me anybody ever feel like this you say I'm going to get up every morning and have devotions I'm going to start my day right and what do you do you get up the first morning and you have devotions praise the Lord get the second morning you do devotions get the third morning what you do you hit the 15-minute snooze so now you got a little less time for devotions next morning you get up you're down to a half hour for devotions next morning you don't even wake up the next morning when you wake up when you do wake up you're on your phone what is it you want to do right but there's something in you that won't do it why because you'll fall back on your own nature every single time right you need something bigger than you you need something greater than you you need something that'll draw you to him because guess what there's nothing in us to draw us to God he's got to be calling us to do these things amen listen Paul dealt with this this is not just before his conversion this is after it this is after it because before his conversion he thought he was perfect he was perfect blameless in his own eyes so this is clearly afterwards but he says listen there's a battle in my flesh he says now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me listen everything you want to do for God there's going to be something trying to keep you from doing it that's absolutely for sure he says for I Delight in the law of good after the inward man what he's saying I'm sincere I want to do the right thing but I see another law in my members in my body warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death next time you're having trouble say you're the body of this death let it know what it is you're stinking for flesh no good thing in it say you're good for nothing flesh but I love the next scripture in Romans 8 1 it says there's therefore now no condom condemnation to them who are in Christ I love how he takes us up this is where we'd be outside of the blood of Jesus Christ this is where we be and this is where you are if you haven't had the new birth oh wretched man or woman that I am who can deliver me I want to do good and I keep messing up I want to keep doing good and I keep messing up I go so far and I pull back I go so far and I pull back up and down in and out why are people so tossed about the prophet we preach amen why because they haven't come into that Haven of Rest they haven't come into Christ because there's no condemnation in there it'll settle them down amen listen it was impossible for the Jews but at least they had a promise we're Gentiles we're outside of the promise we had no bloodline to pull us in we had no promise of redemption to pull us in according to the Natural line the natural lineage of Abraham we are hooped we had no hope Ephesians 2 says that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the Covenant to promise having no hope and without God in the world we are dead in our sins and trespasses is what we were but for the grace of God Amen but for the grace of God and yet here we stand today Here We Stand today heirs and Joint heirs with Christ of the royal Seed of Abraham what by faith not by law but by faith so obviously he's done something since then hasn't he amen what do we need we need somebody that didn't fall in the first place that's why the scripture pointed to a second Adam coming we needed a what a restart we need another kick at the can as we would say today we need another chance to do it and it's got to start with another atom it's got to start with another atom and if that atom won't fall then maybe he can keep the E from falling as well amen we know what God rich in his Mercy by his great love by which he loved us prepare to Lamb slain before the foundation of the world and I love the scripture in Romans 5 it says for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the young God and God bless you as you can stand this evening and I hope we made it through that without too many scars amen but we're lost without them and until we realize we need him we're not going to get anywhere and every time we think we can make it on our own what happens we destroy something all we're doing is giving Satan access right back into our life the very thing that we kicked out amen we let it back in when we say we can do this on our own all he's looking for is us to realize that we've got to come back to him we got to let him do the redeeming work that we got to look to that sacrifice not to our own life that's the thing that'll cleanse your conscience is when you realize that when it came to the Redemptive sacrifice when it came to the sin offering they never looked at the sinner they always looked at the sacrifice amen point to the sacrifice not a Lord I'm doing so great Lord I'm doing so good look at me look at me look at me no they didn't want anybody looking at them when you're coming up there and you knew that that atonement had to be perfect you were never saying look at me you're saying look at the lamb I looked it over it's perfect it's of a perfect line it has no blemishes it has no flaws it has no physical deformities it's perfect perfect perfect and they would examine it you'd sit there and you'd hold your breath until they said it's perfect it's an acceptable sacrifice amen that's what we've got to do is point to him say Lord let that stand in your stead for me and put everything else don't look at me Lord look at the sacrifice amen let me be under the blood of that atonement amen amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord It's hard sometimes to realize how lowly Lord how unable we are Lord we can't even pick ourselves up by our bootstraps and get out of this mess Lord we've got to realize that we're in a pit that's so deep we can't hope to climb out Lord that we need somebody else to get us out of this one but Lord what a wonderful thing it is to look at where we used to be Lord and now to stand here in the freedom of your spirit Lord the bloodbot church Lord raised out of death raised out of darkness and sin Lord raised out of our fallen Humanity Lord and taken into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Lord God Lord may we never forget it Lord may we always point to that sacrifice of Calvary Lord may we never get so lifted up in our walk or our experience or our gifts Lord our Deeds are actions that we do even in Your Name Lord that we'd ever think we're worthy of anything Boba may we point to that perfect sacrifice of Christ Lord may we stay under his blood each and every day we pray Lord knowing that you'll do a redeeming work for every one Lord whose name is
