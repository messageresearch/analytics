[38:07] Lord we're so thankful for your presence
[38:09] this morning
[38:11] Lord thankful for the goodness of God
[38:14] Lord thankful that your promises are yea
[38:16] and amen
[38:18] Lord that you've given them out Lord and
[38:19] they won't come back lord void or
[38:21] unfulfilled
[38:22] but Lord you've called a people you've
[38:24] called a bride out of this age Lord and
[38:26] you're fulfilling your word in her and
[38:28] through her Heavenly Father
[38:30] and Lord we've come in to have our cups
[38:33] filled this morning Lord
[38:35] Lord I'm pouring out
[38:37] Lord that they could be filled up Lord
[38:39] and it's by your goodness and your grace
[38:40] and by your Revelation and by your word
[38:42] that it happens Lord God
[38:44] so Lord we pray you fill us each one
[38:46] this morning Lord that you give us
[38:47] strength Lord that you give us courage
[38:49] Lord that you give us boldness that you
[38:51] give us or the humility to present you
[38:54] Lord in the right light each one
[38:56] or would you just speak to us once again
[38:58] this morning Lord you see each heart you
[39:00] see each need you see each life Lord
[39:02] every situation we Face Lord every
[39:04] trouble every trial every door Lord
[39:06] every that's closed every wall That's
[39:08] set ahead of us
[39:10] Lord may we just have faith to trust you
[39:12] and keep walking forward we pray
[39:14] Lord bless us now each one we pray in
[39:16] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[39:20] amen God bless you
[39:22] amen wonderful song service this morning
[39:25] and then certainly appreciate that
[39:26] brother Josh and just trusting the
[39:28] leading it's a
[39:30] perfect setup for where we are this
[39:31] morning certainly in the service and
[39:33] very thankful for that it also always
[39:36] helps the ministry men when the song
[39:37] search just seems to be right right
[39:39] where it needs to be that said I think
[39:41] we should sing Our God is tremendous
[39:42] every single service amen what a
[39:46] wonderful song Amen that's a bride song
[39:48] I do believe
[39:49] amen excited for the word this morning
[39:52] been studying hard and just feel like
[39:54] the Lord has brought us right to this
[39:56] place right on time so let's read if we
[39:58] would second Peter 1 5 as we started
[40:00] this with the same same scripture from
[40:03] last service amen second Peter 1 5.
[40:06] Peter would say this he says and beside
[40:08] this giving all diligence add to your
[40:12] faith virtue amen God bless you can have
[40:14] your seats this morning may God bless
[40:16] the reading of his word and we're
[40:18] continuing our series on manifesting
[40:19] time we're on part 13 and we're going to
[40:22] take a second service and as far as I
[40:24] know this will be the last one but we
[40:25] want to speak on a lasting strength and
[40:27] we're going to be speaking on virtue
[40:28] this morning and I want to do a quick
[40:30] recap I know a number of us weren't here
[40:32] on on Wednesday and and if you didn't
[40:35] hear it and if you weren't able to
[40:36] stream that I definitely recommend you
[40:37] go back and do it because we're building
[40:40] and if you miss a step then you usually
[40:42] miss something critical and you know as
[40:44] we go through this we'll see that
[40:45] there's no jumping to the good things of
[40:46] God God doesn't just take us from from
[40:49] nothing to something he doesn't just
[40:51] take us from a nothing into the
[40:52] positions of Authority or power or
[40:54] recognition or any of these things but
[40:56] God builds us up bit by bit and if we
[40:58] try and jump then what happens is we
[41:00] fall because our character and our
[41:01] development doesn't match where we are
[41:03] and so we've got to go through this
[41:05] process God has a way of doing things to
[41:07] to create a bride and draw a bride out
[41:09] and and make her into what he wants her
[41:10] to be amen but we saw this this word
[41:13] Virtue with last service and and it that
[41:15] Peter uses and it was that that Greek
[41:17] word erity and it means moral goodness
[41:19] or Excellence of good moral character
[41:22] uprightness and the examples they had
[41:24] there were modesty and Purity and we we
[41:26] saw that this word virtues only used
[41:28] five times there's another word Virtue
[41:29] that's used almost exclusively through
[41:31] the scripture but this one is only used
[41:33] five times and Peter uses it the most
[41:35] and we spent the majority of our service
[41:37] last last uh last Wednesday on this
[41:40] scripture in First Peter 2 9 that says
[41:42] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[41:45] priesthood and holy nation A peculiar
[41:47] people that you should show forth the
[41:49] Praises that word praise there is virtue
[41:51] that you should show forth the virtue of
[41:54] him who hath called you out of Darkness
[41:56] into this Marvelous Light and we spent
[41:58] literally an entire service last time
[42:00] talking about what what kind of life
[42:02] this sort of virtue looks like this
[42:03] Heritage virtue and it's a it's a life
[42:06] that's reflect or a virtue that's
[42:07] reflected in our day-to-day walk amen
[42:10] it's a life that that shows that we're
[42:11] separated out to God and it's chosen our
[42:13] worship and it shows in our clothes and
[42:15] it shows in our conversation in our
[42:18] words and our worship and all of these
[42:20] things and even our approach to God is
[42:21] defined by this sort of virtue amen why
[42:25] because we're being built up to be a
[42:26] temple fit for the dwelling place of God
[42:29] and God expects us to live by the word
[42:31] that he's given us God expects obedience
[42:33] out of his children that's the the
[42:35] nature of a child that's going to be
[42:36] adopted is first of all that they are
[42:38] obedient and if you can't be a b you
[42:40] can't be adopted and many of you can't
[42:42] be obedient then you can't be placed in
[42:44] the position of responsibility because
[42:45] you're just like a shotgun you might go
[42:47] anywhere amen he's looking for somebody
[42:49] that'll hit the mark every single time
[42:51] but we see that this is a this virtue
[42:53] that we're talking about here is a
[42:54] separated life
[42:56] It's A Life That's dedicated to the word
[42:58] of God and it means that we live our
[42:59] lives according to the word of God now
[43:01] Peter would say you have to add to your
[43:03] faith virtue and we spend some time with
[43:05] Abraham last service and we showed that
[43:08] that virtue separated him from unbelief
[43:11] so obedience will separate you from
[43:13] unbelief because obedience will bring
[43:15] you into faith and then Faith brings you
[43:16] into virtue but what it did with Abraham
[43:19] was it put him in a place where God
[43:21] could reveal himself in a greater way
[43:23] because God revealed himself to Abraham
[43:25] as a I'm going to do this and I'm going
[43:27] to do that and it was this great God
[43:29] above him that was revealing it but we
[43:31] see now as we're going to go in through
[43:32] this service that God is going to reveal
[43:34] himself in a different way to Abraham
[43:36] and he's going to reveal himself in two
[43:38] completely different ways as Abraham
[43:41] comes into more and more obedience as
[43:44] Abraham does What God Says then God
[43:45] shows the next step so often that's the
[43:48] problem with us is we're trying to see
[43:49] three steps ahead and God's saying just
[43:51] Do the step I've showed you follow in my
[43:53] Wills following my words should do what
[43:55] I've showed you to do and when you get
[43:56] there you'll get the next bit there's
[43:58] been things that I've been studying and
[44:00] I was trying and I'm looking ahead and
[44:02] I'm saying how do I get there and God's
[44:04] saying just preach what I put in front
[44:05] of you and as soon as I preach that then
[44:07] the door opens to the next one and the
[44:09] next one and the next one and you start
[44:10] to see things in a greater way I've got
[44:12] to have faith for this step and when I
[44:15] get to the next step then he gives me
[44:16] the next one and the next one and the
[44:18] next one the light is only promised as
[44:20] we walk with him in the light amen I
[44:22] can't say where we going God I've just
[44:24] got to say God where are you and stay
[44:27] with him and the light will reveal where
[44:28] I need to be and what I'm supposed to do
[44:30] as it comes this way amen
[44:32] but as I said last service and brother
[44:34] Bob told me he listened to this just
[44:36] finished listening to the Statue of a
[44:37] perfect man you'll know that what I
[44:39] preached last service brother Branham
[44:41] literally gives one line to that and I'm
[44:43] going to read the quote for it but
[44:45] brother bran jumps immediately to a
[44:47] different type of virtue and says this
[44:48] is what we're talking about but brother
[44:50] Brandon has preached on the other sort
[44:52] of virtue all through the message
[44:54] it's not that he just didn't touch on in
[44:55] Statue of a perfect man but he jumps to
[44:57] it and we're going to talk about that
[44:59] this morning we're going to talk about
[45:00] this virtue this Apex virtue if I would
[45:02] call it it's the fullness of virtue I
[45:04] think it would be the way to put it and
[45:05] the brother man would say this he says
[45:06] first you have faith then you add virtue
[45:09] to your faith he says this is the next
[45:12] column first pour your foundation Faith
[45:14] then to your faith at virtue now listen
[45:17] to this he says now right there knocks a
[45:19] lot of us down when a prophet of God
[45:21] says that I listen
[45:23] it means that there's a pro there's a
[45:25] potential problem here there's something
[45:26] that causes issues in the Christian walk
[45:29] he says yes sir add virtue to your faith
[45:32] now that doesn't just mean living a
[45:34] virgin life you know like the woman or a
[45:36] man and so forth that's what we spent
[45:38] all our service on
[45:39] program says it doesn't this virtue
[45:41] doesn't mean just doing that
[45:45] but it's a part of it so you can't skip
[45:47] it
[45:48] but he says that's not the B al-nendable
[45:50] that's not the fullness of virtue and he
[45:52] says that doesn't have nothing to do
[45:53] with that he says this virtue we're
[45:55] getting to this there's more to it than
[45:57] all of this he's not dismissing it but
[45:59] he's saying that's not where virtue ends
[46:01] he says the Bible said we read over here
[46:03] in the Book of Luke Luke where it said
[46:05] virtue went out of him he says that
[46:07] right he says if we're going to be like
[46:09] him we must have virtue then
[46:12] we must have it to be like it so if I'm
[46:14] going to be like Jesus I've got to have
[46:16] virtue
[46:18] but look look at what this virtue looks
[46:20] like he says
[46:21] I've got to have virtue and a pass
[46:24] in other words a means of accessing it
[46:26] or transmitting it or sharing it I've
[46:28] gotta have a pass that it can pass
[46:30] forward from me to the people because
[46:34] virtue went out of him to the people he
[46:37] says virtue and listen to this before
[46:39] you can let it out you've got to have it
[46:42] first
[46:43] before you can let it out you've got to
[46:45] have it first if you haven't got it it
[46:47] won't come out there's nothing for it to
[46:49] come out we spoke last service about
[46:51] that virtue and how we get it but that
[46:53] was a ver that was a the virtue of clean
[46:55] living and we said that was a conscious
[46:57] Choice Abraham chose to obey the word of
[47:00] God you've got to make a decision that
[47:02] start a virtue starts up here and that's
[47:04] the greatest battle ever fought is you
[47:06] decide to obey the word of God it has to
[47:09] start in the mind and then that changes
[47:10] your attitude it changes your words it
[47:12] changes your confession and all of these
[47:14] things and Abraham consciously chose to
[47:16] separate himself and live according to
[47:18] the word of God but that just set him up
[47:20] for the next stage of God revealing
[47:22] himself to him amen
[47:24] now remember what Jesus said in John he
[47:27] said Jesus answered and said unto him if
[47:28] a man loved me he will keep my words
[47:31] period
[47:33] well colon but you understand what I'm
[47:35] saying you've got to obey you can't
[47:38] disobey God and say you love him and you
[47:40] can't move into the greater things of
[47:42] God and being disobedient to God's word
[47:44] you can't do it
[47:45] right he says and my father will love
[47:47] him and we will come into him and make
[47:49] our bowl with him now you can tie that
[47:51] right back to the late Asian Church age
[47:52] this scripture in John 14. you can tie
[47:54] that promise right back into that
[47:56] because those that hear the word of it
[47:58] of God are accepting Christ the word
[48:00] himself
[48:01] you accept the word you accept the
[48:03] person of the word and that person of
[48:05] the word comes into our lives amen and
[48:07] we've got to accept him as he reveals
[48:09] himself Noah had a revealing of God
[48:12] Moses had a revealing of God Daniel had
[48:14] a revealing of God David had a revealing
[48:16] of God Samuel had a revealing to God
[48:18] we've got a revealing of God as well and
[48:20] we've got to accept him as he reveals
[48:23] himself and not stay in the glare of
[48:25] another ages brother Brandon would say
[48:27] you can't throw that away you've got to
[48:29] take it but you've got to keep moving as
[48:30] God does Amen so each one of us has a
[48:33] word for our day and in Revelation 3 we
[48:35] have a word for our day when he speaks
[48:37] to the laodicean church and at the end
[48:38] of that he says this behold I stand at
[48:41] the door and knock and if any man hear
[48:43] my voice and open the door you've got to
[48:45] hear the voice and you've got to open
[48:47] the door amen how do you do that you
[48:49] obey the word I was talking with with
[48:52] somebody this week and I said you notice
[48:53] here that it says if any he says I'm
[48:56] knocking but the knock that you hear is
[48:58] a voice
[49:00] he never says I'm calling but the
[49:03] knocking on your heart is a voice and
[49:04] what is it it's the messenger for that
[49:07] age that's bringing what the spirit says
[49:09] unto the churches so when that spirit's
[49:11] Knocking On Your Heart by a seven Church
[49:13] age messenger you open it and then who
[49:15] comes through the door
[49:18] not the messenger
[49:20] the one that sent the message
[49:22] because he says what I will come into
[49:24] him so he's going to come into our house
[49:26] he's going to come into our life he's
[49:27] going to come into our situations and
[49:29] he's going to have a meal with us but
[49:31] then he says and I will sup with him I
[49:33] will come into him and sup with him but
[49:35] then he says and he with me that's a
[49:37] separate thing that's a resurrection
[49:39] that's a Rapture that's a marriage
[49:40] supper he says you let me in to your
[49:43] life and I'll deal with your life I'll
[49:44] bring you to a place I'll feed you but
[49:47] then I'm going to take you to a
[49:48] different meal and that's one that's
[49:49] reserved only for the bride of Christ
[49:51] why because you heard the word for your
[49:53] day and you accepted it and you accepted
[49:55] Christ the word into your life he says
[49:57] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[49:59] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[50:01] overcame and have sat down with my
[50:03] father in his throne how do you overcome
[50:05] in this age you recognize the message
[50:07] for your day and you act on it
[50:11] it's that simple it's always been that
[50:13] way that's it was the way it was in
[50:15] Noah's day it was a way it wasn't no
[50:16] Moses say it's the same thing in our day
[50:18] we recognize our day and its message and
[50:21] we receive it and that is Christ the
[50:23] word revealing himself to us that's what
[50:25] we have to do but it's continually
[50:27] unfolding that's the thing we have to
[50:29] realize is it's continually unfolding
[50:31] because he's unfolding us to bring us to
[50:33] a greater and greater place in him he's
[50:35] drawing us up into a higher place than
[50:37] him
[50:38] that says he that hath an ear let him
[50:41] hear with the spirit saith under the
[50:42] churches the spirit spoke expressly
[50:45] through those Church age Messengers it's
[50:47] the only place of Refuge that we have is
[50:49] within that message that he's he brought
[50:52] us amen but we're talking about a higher
[50:54] virtue a higher level of virtue here and
[50:56] you'll notice the prophet says you can't
[50:58] give it if you don't get it
[51:01] so this is something you have to take in
[51:03] before you can give it up because we we
[51:05] can get to this place where we're
[51:07] thinking well I've got to have virtue
[51:08] and we think we've got to produce it no
[51:11] you've got to get it to give it
[51:13] it's not something you produce it's
[51:15] something you get it's something that's
[51:17] given it's something that's put into you
[51:18] that you take a hold of and then from
[51:21] there God can use you because the goal
[51:22] of God is to get us to the place where
[51:25] he's not working on us but he's working
[51:27] through US amen so he's trying to do
[51:29] things with our life and this is what
[51:30] the statue of a perfect man is he's
[51:32] trying to get you straightened out he's
[51:34] trying to get you strengthened up he's
[51:35] trying to get you built up so that
[51:37] you're in a place where now all he's got
[51:39] to do is hone you a little bit he
[51:41] stopped chiseling you he stopped
[51:43] hammering on you he stopped doing the
[51:44] heavy work all that's done and now all
[51:46] he's doing is trying to fit you into the
[51:48] body and now he can work through you and
[51:50] give something to those that are around
[51:51] you so you can edify them and help them
[51:53] come into the body of Christ as well
[51:54] amen
[51:56] honing brother Matt knows this when
[51:58] you're honing you're just taking the
[52:00] lightest of things off
[52:03] you're in a near perfect condition and
[52:05] all there is is just little tiny spots
[52:07] and you don't use a lot of pressure for
[52:08] honing you don't use really abrasive
[52:10] anything it's really fine really smooth
[52:12] and it's just really nice
[52:15] doesn't hurt
[52:16] doesn't do anything and it just takes
[52:18] off the tiniest little micro micro bumps
[52:21] if you could call it that that's what
[52:22] honing does
[52:24] but there's a difference in this virtue
[52:25] that we're talking about and brother
[52:26] Brown would say the virtue that we're
[52:28] talking about is the virtue that came
[52:30] out of Jesus and I want us to go back
[52:31] there this morning so we can see this
[52:33] this morning it says in a woman having
[52:35] an issue of blood 12 years which has
[52:37] spent all her living upon Physicians
[52:39] neither could be healed of any came
[52:41] behind him and touched the border of His
[52:44] Garment brother Brannon would say she
[52:46] used him
[52:49] she initiated contact
[52:51] he didn't initiate contact he just was
[52:54] present
[52:55] it was up to her to make the touch
[52:58] it was up to him to be there
[53:01] so she initiated the contact and brother
[53:03] Byron would say well we'll see as we get
[53:04] into this she he didn't use his gift
[53:08] he had a gift he had power he had
[53:10] Authority he had all of these things he
[53:12] didn't use his gift but rather she drew
[53:14] it out of him
[53:15] and he'd know it'd cause him to notice
[53:17] something it says and immediately her
[53:19] issue of blood was done she was healed
[53:21] immediately as soon as she touched him
[53:23] and Jesus said who touched me and when
[53:26] all denied Peter and them that were with
[53:27] him said Master the multitude thronged
[53:29] the impressedly and say so who touched
[53:31] me they said Jesus everyone's touching
[53:33] you
[53:35] goes to show it matters how you touch
[53:37] him
[53:38] matters your approach it matters what's
[53:40] in your heart and Jesus said but
[53:42] somebody had touched me for I perceived
[53:44] that virtue has gone out of me
[53:48] so everybody's touching them but then
[53:49] one person touches him in a particular
[53:51] way and Jesus got weak
[53:54] we saw that in the ministry of a prophet
[53:56] when that strength went out of him when
[53:57] he was under that anointing when the
[53:59] people were drawing it out of him then
[54:01] he would get progressively weaker and
[54:03] weaker until they had to just drag him
[54:04] out of the meeting right
[54:06] so we're seeing that this virtue is not
[54:07] just a virtue to get but it's a virtue
[54:10] to give
[54:11] but you look at this woman and this is
[54:12] this virtue that she received this is
[54:14] not that irritated virtue this is not
[54:16] the the moral living that we are talking
[54:19] about this but this this virtue is
[54:21] called dunamis and it means power
[54:23] strength ability Mighty work Miracle
[54:27] moral power and Excellence of Soul
[54:30] remember it's not just living a virgin
[54:31] clean life but it's part of it
[54:33] power and resources arising from large
[54:36] numbers and power resting in armies or
[54:40] forces
[54:41] this is what we're supposed to have
[54:46] let me ask you a question
[54:47] did that woman get virtue or did she
[54:49] have virtue
[54:51] to get her healing she had to get virtue
[54:54] she had to go to the one that had the
[54:57] mighty Force the power the strength the
[54:59] miracle working power the ability the
[55:02] power resting in an army she had to go
[55:04] to get it before she could get the
[55:06] results of it amen so I want you to to
[55:09] step back because we see this story a
[55:11] couple times in the gospels and I want
[55:12] to look at the starting point for this
[55:14] virtue because when we go to Matthew 9
[55:16] this is the starting point for her
[55:17] virtue remember Peter said add to your
[55:19] faith virtue look at what she did she it
[55:22] says for she said within herself if I
[55:25] may but touch His Garment I shall be
[55:28] whole so here's her faith being
[55:30] expressed she says within herself if I
[55:32] can touch him I know that I'll be healed
[55:34] if I can get through to him then I'm
[55:36] going to be healed and listen she fought
[55:39] her way to get to him she had to fight
[55:42] the crowd to get to Christ
[55:44] he was on his way to Jairus
[55:47] he had a mission he had a plan he had a
[55:49] purpose he was just going and the people
[55:51] thronged him they surrounded him and
[55:52] everybody was touching and calling out
[55:54] to him so she has to fight everybody
[55:56] else that's trying to get a hold of him
[55:58] but the difference is is she's not just
[56:00] coming there for his celebrity but she's
[56:01] coming there because she knows who she
[56:03] is and she knows that if she can touch
[56:05] him she'll get something from him and
[56:07] it's a virtue that'll change her body
[56:08] that'll change her life amen
[56:10] but she persevered until she could touch
[56:13] him and all she got was the Hem of His
[56:15] garments
[56:16] Church how do you Touch the Hem of a
[56:18] man's garment
[56:20] did she reach up
[56:22] touch him up here
[56:25] she struggled so hard
[56:27] to all she could do was this
[56:31] she humbled herself she got knocked down
[56:33] perhaps she struggled and stroven in the
[56:36] end the only way she could get him was
[56:38] to go underneath
[56:40] but yet she persevered because her faith
[56:42] said if I can but touch him then I'll be
[56:45] healed amen
[56:48] it says but Jesus turned him about and
[56:51] when he saw her he said daughter be of
[56:53] good Comfort thy faith hath made the
[56:57] whole and the woman was made whole from
[56:59] that hour so now we see this cycle start
[57:01] to build up that faith is the starting
[57:03] point where Peter said add to your faith
[57:05] virtue and then we get to the place and
[57:07] we think well I'm just having to produce
[57:08] it no you've got to go find the source
[57:11] of virtue before you can deliver it
[57:13] before you come can give it out to
[57:15] somebody else you have to get it and
[57:17] what we see here is a fountain being
[57:18] poured in so that a fountain can be
[57:20] poured out something's pouring into your
[57:22] life so that you can pour it into
[57:23] somebody else's life but if nothing's
[57:25] pouring in then guess what you can tilt
[57:27] the cup all day long nothing will come
[57:29] out
[57:30] you've got to be continuously pouring in
[57:32] you've got to get to that Source amen
[57:33] and brother Brian would say here's where
[57:35] a lot of us get knocked down
[57:38] what we don't get poured into so that we
[57:41] can pour out of
[57:44] we're going to talk about this in in
[57:45] quite some depth this morning amen
[57:47] simple fact is you can't pay a a bill
[57:50] from an empty bank account
[57:53] you can pretend all day long you can say
[57:54] all day long you can have faith all day
[57:56] long but if the money ain't there the
[57:57] bill ain't getting paid
[57:59] and all you do is you rack up what
[58:01] penalties
[58:02] somebody pays a price amen but this
[58:05] former Woman by faith she laid hold of
[58:07] the person of virtue
[58:10] it's a person amen it's a reality it's a
[58:13] manifested one amen and he had the power
[58:15] and he had the strength and he had the
[58:17] miracle working power and when she
[58:19] touched him then she received the virtue
[58:21] that she have needed for her for her
[58:22] body to change him and it healed her of
[58:24] her condition it changed her body it
[58:26] brought her body subject to her faith
[58:30] a man had brought her body subject to
[58:32] her faith and now she had a testimony
[58:35] now she had something to share now she
[58:37] had a witness that she could give of
[58:40] what it meant to touch Jesus amen
[58:42] but the question is how do we get it
[58:45] how do we get this great virtue we've
[58:46] talked about the the moral aspects and
[58:48] The Obedience and the conscious decision
[58:50] we make for that virtue but there's a
[58:52] way that we can get it and brother
[58:53] Branham talks about it and you look at
[58:55] it when he talks about virtue in the
[58:57] Statue of perfect man he gives us like
[58:58] four or five paragraphs and that's it he
[59:00] spends almost no time on this but here's
[59:03] what he did say he said in the spiritual
[59:05] man okay so this is a spiritual aspect a
[59:09] spiritual man growing
[59:11] need something to eat on that's the word
[59:14] of God I believe every word of it God
[59:16] has a table spread where the saints of
[59:18] God are fed he invites his chosen people
[59:20] coming down he's repeating the words of
[59:22] the song with his matahida's feet he
[59:24] supplies her every needle it's sweet to
[59:26] sup with Jesus all the time that's right
[59:28] yes sir he's got it the church has it
[59:31] the Church of the Living God that's
[59:32] built up into this perfect man of the
[59:34] knowledge of Christ now you must have
[59:37] virtue I said then the first thing you
[59:39] know there's somebody loves to smell the
[59:41] odor that's a weird thing to say and
[59:43] stick with me as he explains it he says
[59:45] he isn't selfish
[59:48] he's got older this is good odor not bad
[59:50] odor this isn't stinky sweat but this is
[59:52] a sweet smelling fragrance before he can
[59:55] give out odor he has to have it
[59:57] before he can give out honey he has to
[1:00:00] have it before he can give out Beauty he
[1:00:02] has to have it what is it it's a royal
[1:00:04] priesthood offering acceptable
[1:00:06] sacrifices to God a sweet smelling Savor
[1:00:08] to him Paul was saying II Corinthians he
[1:00:10] says for we are unto God a sweet savior
[1:00:13] of Christ in them that are saved and in
[1:00:16] them that perish in other words he says
[1:00:18] the things that come out of our life
[1:00:19] this virtue that comes out of our life
[1:00:21] is a sweet fragrance to those that are
[1:00:24] saved and to those that are perishing
[1:00:26] it's discernible discernible by all
[1:00:28] anyone shot to be able to come into our
[1:00:31] life and perceive that there's something
[1:00:32] that they can get from us
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] but the prophet would say a spiritual
[1:00:37] man growing needs something to eat on so
[1:00:40] in other words he needs to get his
[1:00:42] vitamins and his nutrients and his
[1:00:43] minerals he needs something substantial
[1:00:45] not to maintain him where he is but to
[1:00:48] grow him
[1:00:50] every day we're supposed to be growing
[1:00:52] in Christ
[1:00:54] you know you get to to a place in in
[1:00:56] health and and these different things
[1:00:57] and and we call it maintaining
[1:01:00] and all you're trying to do is maintain
[1:01:01] your your muscles maintain your weight
[1:01:03] maintain your figure you're not trying
[1:01:05] to get bigger you're not trying to get
[1:01:06] smaller you're not trying to get small
[1:01:07] you know stronger you're just trying to
[1:01:09] hold what you have that is never the
[1:01:11] place for a Christian we are always
[1:01:13] pushing growing striving pressing
[1:01:17] maturing always it never stops it never
[1:01:20] stops amen but the growing Son of God
[1:01:23] can't just eat something to hold him
[1:01:24] where he's at but he's got to take
[1:01:26] something that's good for the journey
[1:01:27] remember when Elijah is about to go on
[1:01:29] the journey and the angel comes and he
[1:01:30] makes a meal for him and Elijah eats all
[1:01:32] he wants and the angel says no keep
[1:01:34] eating because you got a long journey
[1:01:36] ahead so keep eating and keep eating and
[1:01:39] keep eating because you're not going to
[1:01:40] get food for a long time
[1:01:42] when we've got time to eat we've got to
[1:01:44] eat because when we need the energy
[1:01:46] that's not the time to be eating that's
[1:01:48] the time to have the energy in you
[1:01:49] already it's time to have the virtue
[1:01:51] inside of you already
[1:01:53] but let's go to Sarah here in Hebrews 11
[1:01:54] it says through faith also Sarah herself
[1:01:57] received strength that word is virtue
[1:02:00] and it's the same word dunamis as The
[1:02:02] Virtue that went out of Christ so Sarah
[1:02:04] got us say the hold of the same virtue
[1:02:06] that that woman with the blood issue did
[1:02:08] it's the exact same power it says she
[1:02:11] receives strength to conceive seed and
[1:02:13] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:02:15] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:02:18] add to your faith virtue she judged him
[1:02:21] faithful who had promised she wasn't
[1:02:23] looking at her strength she was looking
[1:02:25] at the strength of him who had made the
[1:02:27] promise and she found strength from him
[1:02:29] to produce the word in her life
[1:02:31] therefore spraying there even of one and
[1:02:34] him as good as dead as many as the stars
[1:02:36] of the sky was in multitude and as the
[1:02:38] sand which is by the seashore
[1:02:39] innumerable but I want to say you know
[1:02:42] Hebrews 11 gives us two verses but I
[1:02:44] want you to go back and I want us to go
[1:02:45] back this morning to see how God does
[1:02:47] these things because we're going to see
[1:02:48] a great revealing a progressive
[1:02:50] revelation of God and his work in a
[1:02:52] child of God to bring them to the place
[1:02:54] to produce the word
[1:02:56] we see all these types and shadows as we
[1:02:58] go through the Old Testament it's why
[1:02:59] they're there for our ammunition so we
[1:03:01] can recognize the pattern of God Genesis
[1:03:04] 17 says this and when Abraham Abram was
[1:03:06] 90 years old and nine the Lord
[1:03:10] now in English we just have this word
[1:03:11] Lord
[1:03:13] and we say Well it means the same thing
[1:03:15] time and time again but it doesn't in
[1:03:17] the scriptures that word Lord has so
[1:03:19] many different aspects to it and the
[1:03:21] word Lord here means or or in this one
[1:03:24] the the word Lord is actually El Shaddai
[1:03:28] it says and and it says when Abram was
[1:03:31] 19 years old and nine El Shaddai
[1:03:33] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:03:36] the almighty God walk before me and be
[1:03:39] thou perfect Now That Word Perfect means
[1:03:41] whole complete entire and sound so God's
[1:03:45] telling Abraham to live the way I told
[1:03:47] you to live and produce the word that I
[1:03:49] told you to produce
[1:03:52] that's a burden
[1:03:54] that's a burden for her for Abram
[1:03:57] because he's sitting there he's 99 years
[1:03:59] old he's an old man his seat is dried up
[1:04:01] he can't do anything about it and God's
[1:04:03] saying fulfill the word Abram
[1:04:06] but I want you to see how God revealed
[1:04:08] himself to him
[1:04:10] he says I will make my Covenant between
[1:04:12] me and thee and will multiply thee
[1:04:15] exceedingly
[1:04:16] God's saying the time for the promises
[1:04:18] now
[1:04:19] you've been waiting for 24 years
[1:04:23] Now's the Time I gave the promise the
[1:04:25] present promise hasn't changed I haven't
[1:04:27] changed you've changed but I haven't
[1:04:29] changed the promise hasn't changed and
[1:04:31] now I've come down to tell you you're in
[1:04:33] the season of promise you're in the
[1:04:34] season of change you're in the season
[1:04:36] for the word to be manifested in your
[1:04:38] life the word is about to become flesh
[1:04:40] Abram
[1:04:41] and Abram fell on his face and God
[1:04:43] talked with him saying as for me behold
[1:04:46] my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt
[1:04:48] be a father of many nations neither
[1:04:50] shall thy name anymore be called Abram
[1:04:52] but by thy name Shall be Called Abraham
[1:04:55] for a father of many nations have I made
[1:04:58] thee so catch us now God changes Abram's
[1:05:00] name to Abraham and it's a reflection of
[1:05:03] the word of God it's a reflection of the
[1:05:05] promise of God for him personally
[1:05:08] so Abraham's name now embodies the
[1:05:10] promise of God and he's got to wear that
[1:05:13] promise every day with the name
[1:05:15] he's identified as the promise of God
[1:05:18] Amen but it's before the promise has
[1:05:20] been manifested
[1:05:22] so again there's a bird in there
[1:05:25] there's a potential criticism there's a
[1:05:27] chance for people to laugh and make fun
[1:05:28] of him amen but the name change prepares
[1:05:32] the way for the body change
[1:05:34] the name change prepares the way for the
[1:05:36] word of God to come forth amen the name
[1:05:39] prepares the way for the word to be
[1:05:40] manifested
[1:05:42] the name changes the part is part of the
[1:05:45] expectation
[1:05:47] he says and I will make the exceedingly
[1:05:49] fruitful and I will make nations of thee
[1:05:51] and Kings shall come out of Thee now
[1:05:53] that's all for Abraham but watch what he
[1:05:55] says
[1:05:56] verse 7 I will establish my Covenant
[1:05:59] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:06:02] thee in their Generations so there's a
[1:06:04] similar Covenant there's a same Covenant
[1:06:06] for every single Seed of Abraham that
[1:06:09] comes behind him
[1:06:10] we preach the whole series remember on
[1:06:12] the Royal seed
[1:06:13] we're a part of this verse 7 is our
[1:06:16] covenant verse 7 is our identification
[1:06:18] with the Covenant of Abraham amen so
[1:06:21] every one of us has to realize our place
[1:06:23] and he says it's for an Everlasting
[1:06:25] Covenant to be a god unto thee and to
[1:06:27] thy seed after thee church let me say
[1:06:29] this way you've got to see yourself in
[1:06:31] the Covenant you've got to see it as a
[1:06:33] personal Covenant to you that he is your
[1:06:36] healer he is your deliverer he is your
[1:06:39] provider he is your guide he is your
[1:06:42] Shepherd
[1:06:44] because if you can only see it in
[1:06:46] somebody else's life what is what good
[1:06:48] is it going to do for you but if you can
[1:06:50] put yourself in there and say he's mine
[1:06:53] he's my God he's my shepherd he's my
[1:06:56] deliverer he's my provider now he's got
[1:06:59] something to work with because you've
[1:07:00] placed yourself where you ought to be
[1:07:02] he's your strength and your shielding
[1:07:04] man
[1:07:04] God comes down with Abram and he gives
[1:07:06] him a name change that seems nonsensical
[1:07:09] it makes no sense
[1:07:12] it reminds me when the angel came to
[1:07:14] Mary how can these things be
[1:07:17] it doesn't make any sense and Abraham
[1:07:20] becomes the father of many nations in
[1:07:21] terms of his name and he's literally
[1:07:23] wearing the promise of God
[1:07:27] and nothing has changed
[1:07:30] nothing's changed
[1:07:32] same as he was before the conversation
[1:07:34] with god nothing has changed in Abraham
[1:07:36] he's still 99 years old he's still an
[1:07:38] old man he still can't father a child
[1:07:40] he's still wrinkled he's still tired
[1:07:43] nothing has changed except his name
[1:07:48] he's still got a hold on
[1:07:50] he's still got to have faith
[1:07:52] amen he can't do a thing
[1:07:55] and yet he's got a name change
[1:07:58] we face circumstances so many times and
[1:08:01] we can't change it
[1:08:05] and yet we look in the word
[1:08:06] and we've got a promise of a God that
[1:08:08] changes
[1:08:10] changes circumstances I mean
[1:08:12] that knocks down walls that opens doors
[1:08:15] that sets people free that saves that
[1:08:18] heals it delivers that protects that
[1:08:20] guides
[1:08:21] that provides
[1:08:23] and yet sometimes it seems we're holding
[1:08:24] on so long and then
[1:08:27] what happens
[1:08:29] he lets us know who we are
[1:08:32] changes it remember brother Brown would
[1:08:34] say he would say I no longer call you
[1:08:36] Church
[1:08:37] I call you bride
[1:08:39] because there's a difference between a
[1:08:41] church and a bride
[1:08:43] and you sit here and you say how can
[1:08:45] these things be Brother John
[1:08:47] what's the bride's name Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:08:52] how can it be Brother John
[1:08:54] the name change precedes the
[1:08:57] manifestation of the word
[1:08:59] he's got to let you know who you are so
[1:09:01] you know what's coming your way and so
[1:09:02] you can start looking for it you can
[1:09:04] start believing for it in a way knowing
[1:09:06] that you're in the season
[1:09:08] of becoming the very thing that he's
[1:09:09] named you
[1:09:11] that's why God sent us a prophet to let
[1:09:13] us know it's changing time
[1:09:15] it's manifesting time it's word
[1:09:18] producing time it's Resurrection time
[1:09:20] it's Rapture time it's going home time
[1:09:23] amen so get ready for it because your
[1:09:25] name's been changed that means the
[1:09:27] promise is coming right behind it
[1:09:29] listen our name declares what God is
[1:09:32] doing
[1:09:33] Hebrews 13 8 brother Brown would say
[1:09:35] time and time again my message is to
[1:09:37] declare him that he's here Hebrews 13 8
[1:09:39] Jesus Christ that's our name
[1:09:42] our name is Jesus Christ the same
[1:09:45] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:49] what is it when your Christ when Christ
[1:09:51] is in you then the same nature the same
[1:09:53] attributes the same works are all
[1:09:55] supposed to flow through this body
[1:09:57] the exact same thing and you sit there
[1:10:00] and say brother John it's been so long
[1:10:02] it's been so long and we've seen it in
[1:10:04] part and yes we've been kept safe and
[1:10:06] yes we've been provided for and yes
[1:10:08] we've seen this and yes we've seen that
[1:10:09] and we praise the Lord for but where is
[1:10:11] the promise of his coming
[1:10:13] where is he
[1:10:16] be an expectation you've got the name
[1:10:18] change that means it's just right around
[1:10:20] the corner amen
[1:10:23] what is it it's a name that walks in the
[1:10:25] virtue of obedience on a foundation of
[1:10:28] Faith until it comes to the place where
[1:10:30] virtue becomes strength and power
[1:10:32] because the word is being produced
[1:10:34] through you
[1:10:36] on a foundation of Faith until the
[1:10:38] virtue comes now watch now Abraham has
[1:10:40] to Bear all this scrutiny and laughter
[1:10:42] and I'm sure as he's walking around
[1:10:43] people you know Christians we like to
[1:10:45] testify don't we I'm sure Abraham had
[1:10:47] testified and now he's saying by the way
[1:10:49] don't call me Abram call me Abraham and
[1:10:51] they're saying
[1:10:52] 99 Abraham
[1:10:55] Abraham walking around
[1:10:57] father of many nations call me now
[1:11:01] big laughingstock
[1:11:04] scripture says their face stag or not
[1:11:08] we ought to be able to testify in the
[1:11:10] face of our circumstances in the face of
[1:11:12] our own body in the face of our own
[1:11:14] health
[1:11:15] in the face of our own flaws and
[1:11:16] failures amen
[1:11:19] but look
[1:11:21] Abraham doesn't cower in a corner
[1:11:23] Abraham doesn't fight it he doesn't hide
[1:11:25] it
[1:11:26] but watch this progression because we're
[1:11:28] answering the question how do I get this
[1:11:30] kind of virtue
[1:11:31] he said we read where he said the lord
[1:11:33] El Shaddai appeared to him
[1:11:35] and brother Brian would say this
[1:11:38] he says now we find here he appears in
[1:11:40] the name of El Shaddai the almighty
[1:11:42] really the Hebrew word Shad means breast
[1:11:45] like a woman's breast and he appeared to
[1:11:47] him in the name of al-shaddai which is
[1:11:49] the plural breasted I am the breasted
[1:11:52] God Abraham 99 years old walk before me
[1:11:55] he says be perfect what does it mean to
[1:11:57] be perfect brother John believe my word
[1:12:00] and Just Keep On Believing I promise
[1:12:04] that 75 here it is been 24 years now
[1:12:07] since I made you the promise and what a
[1:12:09] comfort it ought to have been to an old
[1:12:11] man 99 years old
[1:12:13] and his strength all gone and God hear
[1:12:16] God stand before him and said I'm El
[1:12:19] Shaddai I'm the breasted God Amen he
[1:12:22] says draw your strength from me I am
[1:12:25] your strength
[1:12:27] he says like the all-new and Old
[1:12:29] Testament breast of God
[1:12:31] what is it you've got to pull from the
[1:12:33] whole word
[1:12:35] don't just pick the new and you can't
[1:12:37] stay in the old but pull it all together
[1:12:40] he says I am the breasted God draw your
[1:12:42] strength for me like a little baby when
[1:12:44] it's sick and fretting sick weak it
[1:12:46] leans upon its mother's breasts and
[1:12:48] nurses his strength back from the mother
[1:12:50] in other words Abram you're nothing but
[1:12:53] it's baby to me 99 years old he says it
[1:12:56] hasn't been no time his life
[1:12:59] you say brother John it's been so long
[1:13:01] since I actually believed since I laid
[1:13:04] hold of the promise since I claimed it
[1:13:06] since I stood on your word and you're
[1:13:08] speaking to God not to me and you're
[1:13:10] saying what's taking so long God why are
[1:13:12] you waiting
[1:13:14] it's like that to God
[1:13:16] and he says your faith will hold in the
[1:13:18] meantime
[1:13:20] because he won't test you more than
[1:13:21] you're able to bear
[1:13:24] their faith grew
[1:13:27] as time went on
[1:13:29] God help us
[1:13:31] that our faith will grow as time goes on
[1:13:33] rather than weaken as time would go on
[1:13:34] Amen
[1:13:36] you've got to get it before you give it
[1:13:39] is what he's saying amen here's what's
[1:13:41] happening God comes to Abram before the
[1:13:43] promise is going to be produced he
[1:13:44] changes his name and he's saying Abram
[1:13:46] now just to get you over the hump
[1:13:49] there's one more Hill there's one more
[1:13:51] climb you ever been hiking and you go
[1:13:53] over and you think this is it you get
[1:13:55] over the hill
[1:13:56] then it turns a corner and you realize
[1:13:58] you got one more Hill and you're like no
[1:14:00] no no no no no
[1:14:04] one more hump one more Hill
[1:14:07] one more trial
[1:14:09] one more period of waiting
[1:14:13] what you need
[1:14:14] just draw from me get close to me
[1:14:17] and you'll get the strength that you
[1:14:19] need
[1:14:20] scriptures will say lay hold of eternal
[1:14:22] life
[1:14:23] get a hold of God
[1:14:24] get in his presence and see what happens
[1:14:26] amen sometimes we act so grown up church
[1:14:29] but the simple fact is when we're out of
[1:14:32] strength we're out of strength
[1:14:37] when you're done you're done when you're
[1:14:38] out you're out when you're finished
[1:14:40] you're finished and you have to be
[1:14:41] mature enough
[1:14:43] mature enough to say God I'm done
[1:14:46] not I'm done walking I'm done believing
[1:14:48] I'm done obeying no God I've got nothing
[1:14:50] left and so I need you to fill me up
[1:14:53] fill my cup Lord
[1:14:55] to go back and say I've run out
[1:15:00] listen our faith declares
[1:15:03] we haven't run out of faith
[1:15:05] but we've run out of strength
[1:15:07] to keep acting on that Faith the belief
[1:15:09] doesn't change but the strength to keep
[1:15:11] going amen
[1:15:12] remember you're a spiritual person
[1:15:14] brother Brown said growing and so you
[1:15:16] need to get it before you can give it
[1:15:18] brother I'm gonna put it this way he
[1:15:20] says he is still El Shaddai he's still
[1:15:24] the breast of God knew an Old Testament
[1:15:26] just draw your strength from it oh
[1:15:28] everything you have need of the baby he
[1:15:30] is helpless he has to pull his strength
[1:15:32] from his mother that's the only way he
[1:15:34] can get his strength he says that's the
[1:15:37] only way a Believer can get his strength
[1:15:39] is pull it from the word of God that's
[1:15:41] his strength is what God's promises to
[1:15:45] him
[1:15:46] stand by it he says and believe it and
[1:15:48] not only is the little baby here
[1:15:50] represented when it's sick it's fretting
[1:15:52] the mother can put it to her breast and
[1:15:54] he goes to nursing its strength back
[1:15:56] it's satisfied while it's nursing and
[1:16:01] that's the way with the real child of
[1:16:04] God no matter what the skeptic says what
[1:16:06] it believes if you truly believe it
[1:16:08] Jesus can't lie you're satisfied that
[1:16:10] it's revealed to you you've got the
[1:16:12] promise and nothing's going to stop it
[1:16:14] on this rock I build my church see it's
[1:16:18] spiritual the revealed word of Truth now
[1:16:20] you mothers know and your parents know
[1:16:22] that when a baby is hungry and you go to
[1:16:25] nurse it what does it do it latches
[1:16:27] and it just starts going
[1:16:30] because it's so hungry it's so eager for
[1:16:33] strength and it's just going and going
[1:16:35] and going and it's hilarious to watch
[1:16:37] usually the mom is trying to push it
[1:16:39] away but whoa slow down that hurts
[1:16:42] God doesn't tell you to slow down and
[1:16:44] you can't hurt him and you can't take it
[1:16:45] away from them you can't take it all you
[1:16:47] can it is an inexhaustible fountain
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:52] but that baby you see him and and he
[1:16:55] just gets going and going and going and
[1:16:57] they just are sucking and sucking and
[1:16:59] sucking because they're so intent on
[1:17:01] getting what they need and they know
[1:17:02] that milk is what they need
[1:17:04] they're saying give it to me
[1:17:07] don't hold back don't meter the flow
[1:17:09] don't turn the valve down
[1:17:11] give me everything you got
[1:17:13] right
[1:17:15] if it's sick nursing settles it
[1:17:18] if it's tired nursing puts it to sleep
[1:17:22] if it's hungry
[1:17:23] nursing satisfies it
[1:17:26] just the simple Act of nursing being in
[1:17:28] the presence of the mother drawing
[1:17:30] strength and food from the mother amen
[1:17:33] you have to get your virtue from the
[1:17:35] same place you've got to go to the god
[1:17:37] that has the virtue there and it'll
[1:17:39] settle you and strengthen you
[1:17:41] listen have you ever seen a baby get
[1:17:43] settled by a quick drink
[1:17:46] it's got to fill its tummy
[1:17:48] when his tummy's full that's when he's
[1:17:50] satisfied
[1:17:51] and so often what we're doing is we're
[1:17:53] trying to grab a moment with God here
[1:17:54] and a moment with God there and a moment
[1:17:56] with God here and a moment with God
[1:17:58] there and we've got seven minutes
[1:17:59] throughout the day with God and we're
[1:18:01] thinking we can do it
[1:18:02] that's not sitting and nursing it's not
[1:18:05] sitting and drawing
[1:18:07] it's not getting in there and saying
[1:18:08] fill it up Lord
[1:18:10] you ever touch a baby's tummy when it's
[1:18:12] done drinking
[1:18:14] it's like a drum it's completely full
[1:18:17] it's protruding out
[1:18:19] it doesn't stop until it's full
[1:18:21] yet so often we're going for a sip here
[1:18:23] and a sip there and a sip here and a sip
[1:18:25] there he says no no you got to take time
[1:18:27] and set it aside to draw strength amen
[1:18:30] you've got to settle in and feed on the
[1:18:32] word of God you've got to settle in and
[1:18:34] get in the presence of God and let it do
[1:18:35] of work for you and give you strength to
[1:18:37] press through the day
[1:18:39] Jesus would talk about this
[1:18:42] Mark 6 he says in the apostles gathered
[1:18:44] themselves together unto Jesus and told
[1:18:46] him all things both what they had done
[1:18:48] and what they had taught in other words
[1:18:49] they said here's what we've been doing
[1:18:52] and he said unto them Come Ye yourselves
[1:18:55] apart into a desert place
[1:18:58] and do what
[1:19:00] rest a while
[1:19:04] he says for they were there were many
[1:19:06] coming and going and they had no leisure
[1:19:08] so much as to eat they hadn't even had
[1:19:11] time to eat
[1:19:13] church sometimes as Believers were so
[1:19:15] busy doing the work of God we don't have
[1:19:16] time to feed on the word of God
[1:19:19] that can't be God's will
[1:19:22] to burn us out to stress us out to run
[1:19:25] us ragged to get us to the point where
[1:19:27] we get to the end of the day and we've
[1:19:28] lost our Christianity
[1:19:30] amen there's got to be a time and a
[1:19:32] place for this amen our life a Christian
[1:19:34] life is to give always
[1:19:36] this world is preaching self-love and
[1:19:38] it's satanic
[1:19:39] okay the world is saying you've got to
[1:19:41] show yourself love you've got to take
[1:19:42] care of yourself first you've got to do
[1:19:44] this and you've got to do that but
[1:19:45] they've turned it into a self-worship
[1:19:46] where you're of no good to anybody or 90
[1:19:49] of your time is for yourself and 10 for
[1:19:51] everyone else that's never the ratio for
[1:19:54] a Christian but you do have to have
[1:19:55] self-care
[1:19:57] you've got to take care of yourself amen
[1:20:02] Jesus said it's okay to back away from
[1:20:05] your called Ministry
[1:20:08] and get a bite to eat
[1:20:10] go to kilmory for a while it's okay to
[1:20:13] go to kilmori
[1:20:15] listen the church can get by without a
[1:20:17] musician without a song leader without a
[1:20:20] preacher sometimes we can survive it
[1:20:23] and then every one of us has a Ministry
[1:20:25] husbands and fathers that's a Ministry
[1:20:28] wives mothers that's a Ministry song
[1:20:31] leaders deacons trustees it's a Ministry
[1:20:33] the ministers ourselves the preachers
[1:20:34] it's a Ministry Sunday school teachers
[1:20:37] all of us have these things and we can
[1:20:39] get ourselves till we're running ragged
[1:20:41] to fulfill it
[1:20:43] and nothing to fill it
[1:20:45] and what happens is we literally start
[1:20:47] to get so tired out that we start to
[1:20:49] resent the ministry that we're called to
[1:20:52] why because we're not filling in as much
[1:20:53] as we're pouring out
[1:20:55] what we have to realize is we have to be
[1:20:57] ministered to as much as we are
[1:20:58] ministerine
[1:21:00] because if we don't pour in we can't
[1:21:02] pour out so as much as is going out has
[1:21:04] to be filled up some other way and that
[1:21:06] means we've got to go back to Christ
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:09] you know what there's a minister we've
[1:21:11] got a chat of ministers and there's a
[1:21:13] brother talking a while ago and he said
[1:21:14] Brothers he said you're working too hard
[1:21:17] because you think that being busy is
[1:21:20] what God's expecting
[1:21:21] God's not expecting us to be busy God's
[1:21:24] expecting us to be in his will
[1:21:26] we think well I'm a servant I'm a
[1:21:28] minister yes so you've got to be ready
[1:21:31] to serve when he tells you to serve but
[1:21:34] that doesn't mean you got to look busy
[1:21:35] or be busy all the time
[1:21:37] I'm saying this for myself as well as
[1:21:39] for everyone else you're allowed to lay
[1:21:41] it down sometimes to recharge
[1:21:45] you're allowed to lay it down so you can
[1:21:47] get filled up again amen we've got to be
[1:21:49] able to come come away a little bit and
[1:21:51] just draw some virtue back into our
[1:21:54] lives
[1:21:55] we've had how many ministers have we had
[1:21:57] in in the last two or three years with
[1:22:00] heart attacks and heart attacks and
[1:22:02] strokes and this and that and the other
[1:22:04] thing why because they're not taking
[1:22:06] care of themselves because they're so
[1:22:08] busy doing the work of God not realizing
[1:22:10] that if they die they can't do the work
[1:22:12] very well and if they're in a hospital
[1:22:13] bed they can't do it very well
[1:22:15] what they're starting to realize and
[1:22:17] that's what this this and this was a
[1:22:18] senior Minister saying this he's saying
[1:22:19] Brothers slow down
[1:22:22] stop take a break exercise Eat Right
[1:22:27] spend some time with your family do some
[1:22:29] things you enjoy rather than just work
[1:22:32] work work work work because it's a grind
[1:22:35] everything's a grind mothers It's a
[1:22:37] Grind
[1:22:38] I've said it over this public many times
[1:22:40] I don't want to be a mom because it
[1:22:42] always is ongoing you don't get a break
[1:22:44] but yet we have to take breaks and it's
[1:22:47] okay to get a Little Caesar's Pizza time
[1:22:49] and time again just to give yourself a
[1:22:51] break
[1:22:52] may not taste the best it may not be the
[1:22:54] most nutritious thing you can get but it
[1:22:55] can give you a break
[1:22:57] we set these expectations and there are
[1:23:00] expectations not the words expectations
[1:23:03] go with what the word says
[1:23:07] give yourself a break
[1:23:09] brothers and sisters give yourselves a
[1:23:11] break
[1:23:12] say he's not trying to kill us
[1:23:15] with service
[1:23:17] but he is trying to bring his word
[1:23:18] through us
[1:23:20] and so we've got to be able to draw
[1:23:21] virtue and strength amen
[1:23:23] we can guess what so tired and weary
[1:23:24] that we even start to question the very
[1:23:26] thing we believe
[1:23:27] we get jaded
[1:23:29] and if you're feeling jaded it means you
[1:23:31] haven't taken time aside to just get
[1:23:34] some strength to just get filled up
[1:23:36] again
[1:23:37] get your love tank filled if I could put
[1:23:39] it that way but it's a strength tank and
[1:23:41] it can only come with being in the
[1:23:42] presence of God
[1:23:45] listen to this he says while waiting
[1:23:48] there's a time of waiting
[1:23:50] resting in your faith that's what
[1:23:52] waiting looks like resting in your faith
[1:23:54] he says take God's promise that's the
[1:23:57] virtue
[1:23:57] he says I believe you Lord you promised
[1:24:00] to give me the baptism of the spirit I'm
[1:24:01] resting in your in faith my faith that I
[1:24:04] have in you I'm drawing from my resource
[1:24:08] for my resource so you have to get it to
[1:24:11] give it you have to draw from one
[1:24:13] resource that's your resource to give
[1:24:16] which is your internal resource you draw
[1:24:19] from one to give out he says I'm drawing
[1:24:22] from my resource for my resource for my
[1:24:25] health from your resource the word The
[1:24:27] man shall not live by bread alone but
[1:24:29] out of the bosom of God shall he nurse
[1:24:31] his strength every word that comes out
[1:24:33] of the mouth of God shall he receive his
[1:24:35] strength as he comes from the mouth of
[1:24:36] God the word he says like Abraham
[1:24:39] Abraham was resting now he had lived
[1:24:42] with Sarah since she was a little girl
[1:24:44] it was his half-sister he was living
[1:24:45] with her and married her she was Barren
[1:24:47] she had no children but here she is now
[1:24:49] she's 89 years old he says but Abraham
[1:24:52] rest in the faith of my word I'll
[1:24:55] promise you I'll do it I am El Shaddai I
[1:24:57] am the breasted God for my children that
[1:24:59] believe if you don't want a nurse well
[1:25:02] then don't say no more about it you see
[1:25:04] he's saying don't blame me if you don't
[1:25:06] nurse
[1:25:07] I'm here I'm available so don't blame me
[1:25:10] if you don't have it because it's your
[1:25:12] choice not to nurse because I'm here to
[1:25:14] provide he says but if you are a child
[1:25:17] you are nursing you are resting he says
[1:25:20] every promise
[1:25:22] he says notice real Faith rests upon the
[1:25:25] solid rock of the promise of God's word
[1:25:27] it doesn't shift the real faith is
[1:25:31] anchored like in the North Star the
[1:25:33] North Star is a typos to every
[1:25:34] shipmaster the compass points him only
[1:25:38] to that North Star and God the word is
[1:25:41] every Christians nor star if you're lost
[1:25:43] and the Holy Spirit is what points you
[1:25:45] to it it won't point to nothing else all
[1:25:48] other isms and so forth and Christianity
[1:25:50] mixed up on it whatever it may be it's
[1:25:52] like the world shifting it changes those
[1:25:54] stars but it can't change the North Star
[1:25:56] neither can anyone change the word of
[1:25:59] God he says anchor to it stay with it
[1:26:02] what's he saying he's saying Christ the
[1:26:03] word is our source of strength it's a
[1:26:06] fountain of virtue a power of Might to
[1:26:08] produce the word of God it's a mighty
[1:26:10] Army
[1:26:11] it's a mighty Army but God puts a burden
[1:26:14] on Abraham by giving him a name that
[1:26:16] declares the promise and yet the promise
[1:26:18] hasn't been fulfilled and then God
[1:26:20] reveals himself as the breasted one what
[1:26:22] so that Abraham can rest and draw
[1:26:25] strength to move into the final stage
[1:26:28] the revealing of God reflects the need
[1:26:31] of Abraham
[1:26:33] you'll find that God comes to you in the
[1:26:35] way that you need him
[1:26:37] he didn't come to him as Elohim he came
[1:26:39] to him as El Shaddai because that's what
[1:26:41] he needed was strength to just get him
[1:26:43] through the next year he just had one
[1:26:44] more year left and then it was all going
[1:26:46] to be okay before the promised son
[1:26:48] arrived amen God knows how to work it
[1:26:50] out church God knows how to bring
[1:26:51] himself to you in the situations you're
[1:26:54] in in the time of life you're in where
[1:26:55] the struggles and trials are and he
[1:26:58] reveals himself to meet that need in
[1:27:00] Genesis 17 he gives the name change in
[1:27:02] the burden of the promise of be thou
[1:27:04] perfect
[1:27:05] we're supposed to be in the Statue of a
[1:27:07] perfect man we have the same burden but
[1:27:10] Genesis 17 when he does is a spiritual
[1:27:13] Revelation it's a spiritual conversation
[1:27:15] with god it's God above us
[1:27:18] God's just revealing himself as above it
[1:27:21] all
[1:27:22] amen but then we come to Genesis 18 and
[1:27:24] watch how God changes because it says
[1:27:26] here and the Lord appeared unto him in
[1:27:28] the plains of mammary and he sat in the
[1:27:30] tent or In the Heat of the day now this
[1:27:31] word Lord we just say well that's Lord
[1:27:33] no no no here in Genesis 17 it was El
[1:27:36] Shaddai it was it was the breast that
[1:27:38] one The Virtue giving the life-giving
[1:27:40] strength giving God it was a Heavenly
[1:27:41] visitation it was a Heavenly
[1:27:43] conversation but in Genesis 18 God
[1:27:45] Appears again and this time the word is
[1:27:47] Lord but it's Elohim
[1:27:50] it's Elohim and it's a physical
[1:27:52] visitation what is it God came from
[1:27:54] above us now it's God With Us and it's
[1:27:57] Elohim
[1:27:58] and Birdman would say this he says now
[1:28:00] we know we realize that in this he was
[1:28:02] called Elohim the word also in the
[1:28:04] translation here means Elohim and Elohim
[1:28:06] is the all-sufficient one he is El
[1:28:10] Shaddai Elohim the breast of God the
[1:28:12] all-sufficient one he needs nothing from
[1:28:15] nobody else he is your all-sufficiency
[1:28:18] so in person now he comes and he says
[1:28:21] I'm the one that's going to do this I'm
[1:28:23] the one that's going to produce it I am
[1:28:25] the person of the promise and I'm
[1:28:27] meeting with you personally to let you
[1:28:28] know now is the time of your word now is
[1:28:32] the time for the manifestation and I'm
[1:28:34] coming down in person to you I'm having
[1:28:35] a personal revealing to you a personal
[1:28:37] conversation with you
[1:28:41] he reveals himself as El Shaddai he
[1:28:44] manifests himself as Elohim the
[1:28:46] all-sufficient one
[1:28:48] what is it God With Us
[1:28:51] when God spoke as El Shaddai he was what
[1:28:54] recognizing Abraham's need for strength
[1:28:56] he recognizes Sarah's need for strength
[1:28:58] his reveal he met the need and who he
[1:29:00] was at the moment was exactly what they
[1:29:01] needed they've been waiting for so long
[1:29:03] they've been faithful they've lived the
[1:29:05] right life they'd separated themselves
[1:29:06] they'd obeyed his word but now they
[1:29:08] needed some strength to get over that
[1:29:09] last hump and then God comes now as the
[1:29:12] all-sufficient one
[1:29:14] he says he doesn't he needs nobody
[1:29:17] nothing from nobody else you can't add
[1:29:20] to this you can't produce it you can't
[1:29:22] do anything to make it happen
[1:29:25] he is coming to do it it's a one-way
[1:29:27] Road it's a one-sided Covenant it's a
[1:29:31] complete Covenant that you have nothing
[1:29:33] to do with except that you receive it
[1:29:35] all God was doing was keeping Abraham
[1:29:37] alive so that God could do the work
[1:29:40] that's what God's doing with us he's
[1:29:42] keeping us alive so he can do the work
[1:29:43] until he can get us to the place where
[1:29:45] we're supposed to be God was letting
[1:29:47] Abraham no I got this
[1:29:48] I started it with a promise then I
[1:29:51] confirmed it with a covenant and now I'm
[1:29:53] here in person to let you know it's the
[1:29:57] season
[1:29:57] of the body change
[1:29:59] it's the season for the promised son to
[1:30:01] come forth it's the season of the word
[1:30:03] to be born in your flesh
[1:30:06] brother Bible say this notice after the
[1:30:07] appearing in this name of almighty God
[1:30:09] and it was revealed to him that he was
[1:30:11] the all-sufficient one he had no helpers
[1:30:14] he didn't need any secretaries he was
[1:30:16] God alone and he appeared to Abraham in
[1:30:19] this name and while he appeared to him
[1:30:20] in this name and Abraham recognized who
[1:30:23] he was
[1:30:24] that's key you got to recognize him as
[1:30:27] he's revealing himself because that's
[1:30:28] the answer to your need
[1:30:31] see what happens when we come and we say
[1:30:33] God meet my need this way as you miss
[1:30:34] the revealing of God
[1:30:36] it's because you've said God here's how
[1:30:38] you have to reveal yourself
[1:30:40] no no no no no he Reveals His himself
[1:30:42] according to the need you have you don't
[1:30:44] get to tell him how he does it
[1:30:47] he says Abraham recognize who he was and
[1:30:49] he changed Abraham's name
[1:30:51] now listen to this he says now he's come
[1:30:53] to the fullness of believing now
[1:30:56] the fullness of believing now see where
[1:30:58] the church has come I hope you can read
[1:31:00] between the lines we've come to the
[1:31:02] place where he's revealed to him who he
[1:31:03] was then he changed Abraham's name so
[1:31:05] that the promise could be fulfilled he
[1:31:07] says he's he's come to the fullness of
[1:31:09] believing now there's a time for
[1:31:11] believing in the simple fact is in that
[1:31:14] time nothing happens
[1:31:16] or nothing appears to be happening and
[1:31:19] that has nothing to do with whether you
[1:31:21] believe or not
[1:31:23] let me say that again the fact that
[1:31:25] nothing's happening does not mean you
[1:31:27] don't have faith it has nothing to do
[1:31:29] with your lack of faith it has
[1:31:30] everything to do with the timing of God
[1:31:32] Amen but the delay of the promise of God
[1:31:35] does not have anything to do with our
[1:31:36] faith and only to do with the timing and
[1:31:38] the plan of God that's his Sovereign
[1:31:40] portion and we can't change it but just
[1:31:42] because it hasn't happened doesn't mean
[1:31:43] you don't have faith doesn't mean you
[1:31:45] don't believe doesn't mean you're not a
[1:31:46] believer
[1:31:48] but it means God's moving and it's in
[1:31:50] his side of things Abraham could not
[1:31:52] have sped up the promise of God if he
[1:31:54] tried
[1:31:55] more faith would not have quickened
[1:31:57] Isaac's arrival
[1:32:00] see we we get human in this
[1:32:03] we get human and we say well if I could
[1:32:05] only then no God's got it it's his
[1:32:09] Covenant it's his Covenant and he's
[1:32:11] building us up perfectly to be in time
[1:32:14] with his word
[1:32:15] he's an on-time God and he's got an
[1:32:18] on-time bride
[1:32:20] trust in that amen
[1:32:22] but at near the end of this thing
[1:32:24] there's a fullness of believing now
[1:32:27] in other words the things going to come
[1:32:29] together you put it all on the line
[1:32:30] you've held fast what God has said you
[1:32:32] you've lived your life by it you
[1:32:34] confessed it and God says now what he's
[1:32:36] saying is we're in the season of The
[1:32:38] Promise we're in the time of fulfillment
[1:32:40] now is the time where Faith becomes
[1:32:42] sight
[1:32:43] now your virtue won't just hold you
[1:32:46] but your virtue will produce
[1:32:50] it'll bring out something that you
[1:32:52] couldn't do yourself
[1:32:53] why because the all-sufficient has
[1:32:55] visited you
[1:32:57] and when he does it it's a perfect work
[1:32:59] it's an on-time work and everything you
[1:33:02] have need of is found in his visitation
[1:33:06] brother I would say it this way he says
[1:33:07] notice he changed his name there from
[1:33:09] Abram to Abraham which means father of
[1:33:11] Nations he added to ham Abraham so he
[1:33:14] did this so that the complete promise
[1:33:17] could be fulfilled see what we have to
[1:33:19] realize is that the whole journey is
[1:33:20] part of the promise
[1:33:22] Abraham's separation Abraham's walking
[1:33:25] Abraham's living intense Abraham going
[1:33:27] to a new land was all a part of the
[1:33:29] promise of Isaac
[1:33:33] we keep looking for the end and saying
[1:33:35] that's all we need no everything in
[1:33:36] between is all part of the promise
[1:33:38] that's what he's saying here he did this
[1:33:40] so that the complete promise could be
[1:33:41] fulfilled some of it had already been
[1:33:43] fulfilled
[1:33:45] he says and and the son now that had
[1:33:47] been promised so long could be seen or
[1:33:48] otherwise be revealed when he changed
[1:33:50] his name and after he recognized who he
[1:33:52] was he might have thought that there was
[1:33:54] a party of them remember three men came
[1:33:58] he says but he recognized that he was
[1:34:00] Elohim God alone but when he did that
[1:34:03] and then he changed his name he said now
[1:34:04] Abraham you're no more to be called
[1:34:06] Abram but Abraham for a father of
[1:34:08] Nations I made you Abraham now he's in
[1:34:11] condition now he's in condition after
[1:34:14] revelation of who he is he is now in
[1:34:17] condition to see the sun revealed
[1:34:21] Abraham's body hasn't been changed and
[1:34:23] brother but I'm saying he's in condition
[1:34:25] now why because virtue has been given
[1:34:28] he's been nursing he's been dwelling on
[1:34:31] the work of God he's been dwelling on
[1:34:33] that experience
[1:34:34] when God does something for you feed on
[1:34:37] it
[1:34:38] hold on to it and when God came down to
[1:34:41] Abraham and said now is the time Abraham
[1:34:43] started drawing strength from that and
[1:34:45] it put him in a condition to where the
[1:34:47] results could start coming out of his
[1:34:49] life
[1:34:51] what was it what was the event that
[1:34:53] started this Final Countdown to the
[1:34:54] birth of Isaac
[1:34:56] it was virtue being drawn from God under
[1:34:59] the revelation of who God was to him
[1:35:02] El Shaddai the breast of one that he
[1:35:04] could nurse from
[1:35:06] what it is it sparked a supernatural
[1:35:08] revelation
[1:35:10] what is it body change time
[1:35:13] for the birth time for the word to come
[1:35:15] forth
[1:35:16] so if we go back to Hebrews 11 and read
[1:35:18] it again we'll close on this thought
[1:35:21] says through faith also Sarah herself
[1:35:23] receives strength she received virtue to
[1:35:25] conceive seed that's as dunamis this is
[1:35:27] the very virtue of Christ and was
[1:35:29] delivered of a child when she was
[1:35:30] passage because she judged him faithful
[1:35:32] who had promised therefore spraying
[1:35:34] there even of one and him as good as
[1:35:36] dead as many as the stars of the sky and
[1:35:38] multitude and as the sand which is by
[1:35:40] the seashore innumerable Sarah herself
[1:35:43] got a personal visitation now God's
[1:35:46] covenant was with Abram
[1:35:48] with Abraham and he comes and he speaks
[1:35:50] with Abraham and she's just
[1:35:52] eavesdropping through the tent but as so
[1:35:54] she wasn't a part of the conversation
[1:35:56] but as soon as he catches her thought he
[1:35:58] engages her
[1:36:01] and he corrects her
[1:36:03] and in that correction she receives
[1:36:05] strength and she recognizes who that man
[1:36:09] is
[1:36:10] because he says at according to the time
[1:36:12] of life I
[1:36:15] I
[1:36:17] she recognizes this is God himself
[1:36:20] she didn't believe it at first but when
[1:36:22] he discerned the thoughts and intents of
[1:36:23] her heart now she believed and it struck
[1:36:25] something and all of a sudden she
[1:36:27] receives virtue she receives strength
[1:36:29] she she recognizes what's going on she
[1:36:31] went from doubting the promise
[1:36:33] to nurturing the promise what a change
[1:36:37] church you've got to have a personal
[1:36:39] experience with Christ
[1:36:42] it'll change the way you think it'll
[1:36:46] change the way you live it'll change the
[1:36:47] way you wait
[1:36:49] it'll change your attitude
[1:36:51] it'll change your approach
[1:36:54] and it'll give you faith and it'll give
[1:36:56] you strength
[1:36:57] trust God until his time he comes around
[1:37:00] him and what it'll do it'll bring your
[1:37:02] body subject to the word of God
[1:37:06] bring your body subject to the word of
[1:37:08] God that's all the Rapture is is your
[1:37:10] body letting go of the last little bit
[1:37:13] of strength it has and defeating gravity
[1:37:15] and it gets glorified and off you go
[1:37:17] it's just the last step of what's been
[1:37:19] going on all along that's why I said
[1:37:21] you've got to see that the entire thing
[1:37:23] is the promise not just the rapture it's
[1:37:26] all a rapture
[1:37:30] if you can ever realize God's speaking
[1:37:32] to you
[1:37:34] it may be over this pulpit
[1:37:36] it may be a service you stream it being
[1:37:38] maybe a message you listen to it may be
[1:37:40] the word that you're reading it could be
[1:37:41] fellowship with a brother or sister it
[1:37:43] could be a donkey
[1:37:45] it could be a worldly person I've had
[1:37:47] God speak to a worldly person before
[1:37:51] but if you can recognize it's God
[1:37:53] and take strength from the fact that
[1:37:55] he's come down to let you know
[1:37:58] it'll give you strength it'll give you
[1:38:00] virtue to keep pressing on Amen
[1:38:02] until we have that we'll struggle we'll
[1:38:05] fight we'll fuss we'll Wonder we'll
[1:38:07] doubt we'll get jaded all of those
[1:38:09] things but when we realize that he is
[1:38:11] the one that's talking to us
[1:38:12] and he's sorting out our issues and he's
[1:38:14] dealing with what's going on then we
[1:38:16] start to get strength amen why because
[1:38:18] he says it's me
[1:38:20] I'm God
[1:38:21] and I'm here to talk to you today
[1:38:23] I'm here to get into your situation
[1:38:26] what is it it's God With Us
[1:38:29] but what kind of virtue did Sarah
[1:38:30] receive it says she received virtue she
[1:38:34] receives strength to conceive
[1:38:37] went from God with her
[1:38:39] to God in her
[1:38:42] it was a supernatural event
[1:38:45] right it wasn't just a repaired body you
[1:38:47] know they do these makeovers now where
[1:38:49] they take somebody that just looks all
[1:38:50] frumpy and old and tired out
[1:38:52] and then they doll them all up and they
[1:38:54] push and they poke and they do this and
[1:38:56] that and the other thing and then they
[1:38:57] bring them out and everybody goes wow
[1:38:58] that was all underneath that well still
[1:39:00] underneath that
[1:39:03] as soon as she takes a shower it's going
[1:39:04] to be all back but that's what they do
[1:39:05] is they push and poke and prod and get
[1:39:07] everything all glammed up to make you
[1:39:09] think that that person's a new person
[1:39:10] and they're not the same person's there
[1:39:13] the the the 24 hours of the week of work
[1:39:15] that they did on that poor woman did not
[1:39:17] change her she still is old and still as
[1:39:20] worn out as she ever was
[1:39:22] but they painted everything on but this
[1:39:24] is not what happened to Sarah Sarah
[1:39:25] didn't get a makeover
[1:39:27] Sarah got a new body
[1:39:29] what was it it was the third revealing
[1:39:31] of God
[1:39:32] and it was in her and Abraham's bodies
[1:39:34] brother Brown says this he says we know
[1:39:36] that God had to do something to the womb
[1:39:38] anyhow of Sarah didn't he she'd been
[1:39:40] bearing all these years nearly a hundred
[1:39:42] years old and was Barren in order to do
[1:39:44] something to make this he had to
[1:39:46] recreate something in that woman's womb
[1:39:48] to make it fertile is that right in
[1:39:50] order to do that he had to stimulate her
[1:39:52] heart because she couldn't go in labor
[1:39:54] like that a woman 100 years old is that
[1:39:56] right couldn't do it all right another
[1:39:57] thing what about the milk veins he says
[1:39:59] God doesn't patch up anything
[1:40:04] God doesn't patch up anything he made
[1:40:07] Sarah a new woman
[1:40:09] he made her a young beautiful woman
[1:40:12] again and he made Abraham a young man
[1:40:14] again he just turned them back to show
[1:40:17] what he's going to do in the Rapture
[1:40:19] with us
[1:40:22] I've spoken on this many times and it
[1:40:25] still makes me laugh he says abimelech
[1:40:27] fell in love with her
[1:40:29] can you imagine
[1:40:30] if he wasn't a king the razzing he'd get
[1:40:33] for falling in love with an 89 year old
[1:40:37] laughs
[1:40:40] old grandma little bitty hat on top of
[1:40:42] her head and you know and said oh you're
[1:40:44] fair to look upon dear you're fair to
[1:40:46] look upon yeah nonsense he made her a
[1:40:48] beautiful young woman sure he did what's
[1:40:51] he going to do to us old people one of
[1:40:52] these days change us back Hallelujah all
[1:40:55] the days of my full time said job I'll
[1:40:58] wait till my time comes amen when my
[1:41:00] change will summon yes sir will be
[1:41:02] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[1:41:04] of an eye and be caught up together with
[1:41:05] them resurrected ones to meet the Lord
[1:41:07] in the air and be forever and forever be
[1:41:09] with them he says oh I'm so glad that I
[1:41:12] can say I'm one of them might have think
[1:41:14] of that no matter what happens here on
[1:41:15] Earth that has nothing to do with it
[1:41:17] I'll Fly Away one of these mornings
[1:41:22] I talked about this last service how
[1:41:24] that word virtuous is only mentioned
[1:41:26] four times in scripture and every single
[1:41:29] time
[1:41:31] it's about a woman
[1:41:34] it's always about a woman first one we
[1:41:36] said was Ruth and
[1:41:37] listen Ruth didn't have a history
[1:41:39] anybody will be proud of she didn't have
[1:41:40] a reputation
[1:41:42] yet scripture calls her virtuous and
[1:41:45] then other three are all in the Book of
[1:41:46] Proverbs and every single one of them
[1:41:48] refer to a wife
[1:41:50] remember we read with that virtue that
[1:41:52] dunamis is
[1:41:53] but see virtue
[1:41:56] is a noun
[1:41:58] it's something
[1:42:00] but virtue has to become a person
[1:42:05] so if we look at what that word dunamis
[1:42:07] means
[1:42:11] come back in my notes here real quick
[1:42:15] the word dunamis means power strength
[1:42:17] ability Mighty work Miracle power and
[1:42:20] resources arising from large numbers
[1:42:21] power resting in armies or forces
[1:42:25] it's a noun it's a thing
[1:42:27] but now it becomes an attribute
[1:42:30] and that's what Peter was getting at is
[1:42:31] it has to not just be a thing but it has
[1:42:33] to be an attribute it has to be a living
[1:42:35] virtue
[1:42:37] and that word virtuous means strong
[1:42:39] Mighty able efficient wealthy forceful
[1:42:45] an army
[1:42:47] that's what the bride of Christ is when
[1:42:49] she has this kind of virtue
[1:42:52] but remember brother Brown said here's
[1:42:54] where so many get knocked down
[1:42:55] we've got to get it before we give it
[1:42:58] you got to nurture and draw strength
[1:43:00] you've got to feed on the word daily you
[1:43:01] got to set aside time for yourself daily
[1:43:03] this is simple this is Christianity 101
[1:43:06] Church and yet brother Brown says so
[1:43:08] many get knocked down right here they
[1:43:10] try to give without taking
[1:43:12] they don't draw from the one that has it
[1:43:14] and so they set themselves up for
[1:43:16] failure because the end of the day comes
[1:43:17] and they've run out of Christianity
[1:43:19] they've run out of strength they've run
[1:43:20] out of patience they've run out of all
[1:43:22] these things amen
[1:43:23] I'm talking to us all now not just our
[1:43:25] sisters
[1:43:26] but I think our sisters have it the
[1:43:27] worst many times
[1:43:30] some of our brothers are putting in more
[1:43:31] time than others and
[1:43:33] trying to get ahead but
[1:43:34] these mothers and wives is 24 7 job it
[1:43:37] seems like
[1:43:38] you've got to put that time in and
[1:43:41] husbands we've got to be able to let
[1:43:43] them do it
[1:43:44] can sit back and say no no you just have
[1:43:46] to squeeze it in
[1:43:48] no we've got to take up some of that
[1:43:51] load so they can get that time
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] amen Brothers
[1:43:58] can't just leave it on their shoulders
[1:43:59] and say fit it in that's your Christian
[1:44:00] Duty how about it's our Christian duty
[1:44:03] to share the load
[1:44:05] amen preaching to myself
[1:44:09] and then we can't run dry before the
[1:44:11] day's over
[1:44:14] gotta be able to sit down say I actually
[1:44:16] need something
[1:44:18] you know what that takes humility
[1:44:20] takes honesty it takes a hard look
[1:44:23] to say you know what the attitude is not
[1:44:25] what it ought to be and that means I'm
[1:44:27] running dry on something
[1:44:29] there's only one person can give it and
[1:44:31] that's Christ
[1:44:33] amen don't go on your phone
[1:44:36] don't go on your phone or your computer
[1:44:37] your tablet don't go read Lucy mob
[1:44:39] Montgomery
[1:44:42] sit down
[1:44:43] and have a chat
[1:44:45] with Elohim
[1:44:47] but thou Shaddai
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:51] with a manual
[1:44:54] talk to him about your situation talk to
[1:44:56] him about your problems talk to him
[1:44:57] about your frustrations
[1:44:59] but don't leave it as those things
[1:45:02] draw strength from the word that
[1:45:04] resolves every one of those things amen
[1:45:06] get in there and feed on it
[1:45:09] musicians I'm going to have you come I
[1:45:10] want to read just a couple quotes before
[1:45:12] we go
[1:45:13] you've got to get to a place where you
[1:45:14] can have a conversation and God fills
[1:45:16] you up
[1:45:17] church is a part of it
[1:45:19] we come in for strength you know what my
[1:45:22] friend Roy that comes in and he was
[1:45:24] saying you know I come in to get
[1:45:25] strength that's a good thing
[1:45:28] for encouragement but that's only a
[1:45:30] couple hours a week
[1:45:31] two days a week we've got to have a
[1:45:33] source and it can't just be over this
[1:45:34] Pulpit amen but I just want to share two
[1:45:36] quotes with you I was listening to this
[1:45:38] the other day and it was at the very end
[1:45:39] of a message and it just struck me
[1:45:41] beautifully how Peter said add to your
[1:45:43] faith virtue and we say what does that
[1:45:45] look like brother John we've looked at
[1:45:46] it with Sarah Abram but I want to show
[1:45:47] you something in our time because it's
[1:45:50] it's our sign because remember scripture
[1:45:52] says as it was in the days of Noah
[1:45:55] as the days of as it was in days of
[1:45:57] Sodom and Gomorrah so it's going to be
[1:46:00] in our day God above us God With Us God
[1:46:02] in us and we've got to see a revealing
[1:46:04] of that we've got to see that here and
[1:46:06] we saw it through a son of man ministry
[1:46:08] didn't we
[1:46:09] but remember it can't just stop with the
[1:46:11] son of man there has to be a woman that
[1:46:13] brings forth life
[1:46:15] there's got to be a word that's produced
[1:46:17] amen
[1:46:20] brother Brown would say that same Jesus
[1:46:21] lives today
[1:46:23] and the Bible says in the New Testament
[1:46:25] the book of Hebrews that he now is the
[1:46:27] high priest that can be touched by the
[1:46:29] feeling of our infirmities do you all
[1:46:31] believe that
[1:46:32] do you believe it
[1:46:34] he says how is it then touch him not
[1:46:37] touch the pastor not touch the
[1:46:39] Evangelist but touch Christ he has got
[1:46:42] to act the same that he did then and if
[1:46:45] he doesn't then we're serving another
[1:46:47] Christ who is only similar to the one
[1:46:49] that was
[1:46:50] the Bible said he is the same Jesus the
[1:46:53] Same power so it isn't the virtue of
[1:46:55] some man's hands it isn't he says listen
[1:46:57] to this it's the virtue of your own
[1:47:00] faith in the resurrected Christ that you
[1:47:03] believe Hebrews 13 8. my brethren I have
[1:47:06] nothing wrong with laying on hands
[1:47:07] anointing the sick anything you want to
[1:47:09] do but the real thing is to believe him
[1:47:12] that he's raised from the dead and he's
[1:47:14] present to manifest himself and every
[1:47:17] Power that he ever did he is the same
[1:47:19] yesterday today and forever
[1:47:22] amen what does that look like brother
[1:47:24] John listen to this
[1:47:27] here's a little woman laying here on the
[1:47:29] stretcher let's stand together if we
[1:47:31] would here's a little woman laying out
[1:47:33] here on the stretcher can you hear me
[1:47:35] lady laying on that stretcher he says
[1:47:37] yeah I cannot heal you I know nothing
[1:47:39] about you you're just a stranger to me
[1:47:41] but do you believe that Jesus Christ can
[1:47:44] reveal to me what your trouble is would
[1:47:46] that help you it would if you lay there
[1:47:49] you're going to die you only have one
[1:47:51] chance to live that's except Christ
[1:47:54] he says you have cancer that is right
[1:47:57] you believe that God will make you well
[1:47:59] now you do raise up your hand if you
[1:48:02] believe it all right she's laying on a
[1:48:03] stretcher Church she has no strength
[1:48:08] so he says do what you can he says you
[1:48:10] have he says raise up your hand if you
[1:48:12] believe it all right she's laying flat
[1:48:15] on a stretcher and she does the one
[1:48:17] thing that most of us can do she says
[1:48:18] Lord I believe
[1:48:22] he says in your place the only thing
[1:48:25] that you could do would be rise up out
[1:48:28] of that bed and take up what you're
[1:48:30] laying on and go home claiming your
[1:48:32] faith in God as the Seed of Abraham he
[1:48:35] says Rise Up In The Name of Jesus
[1:48:38] now watch this progression you can hear
[1:48:40] more as you listen on the tape and I
[1:48:41] encourage you to go listen to it he says
[1:48:44] see she raises up to take her promise in
[1:48:46] God now watch now her faith in the word
[1:48:49] has caused her to sit up in the bed
[1:48:53] so she's gone from flat on her back to
[1:48:55] sitting up
[1:48:59] but he says you got to get out of the
[1:49:01] stretcher
[1:49:03] she's too weak
[1:49:05] she had strength to raise her hand her
[1:49:07] faith gave her strength to sit up he
[1:49:09] says but you got to get out of that
[1:49:10] stretcher now watch what brother Branham
[1:49:12] does
[1:49:13] he says how many the rest of you believe
[1:49:16] with all your heart now
[1:49:19] there's virtue
[1:49:21] in Fellowship
[1:49:22] there's virtue in having Believers
[1:49:24] around you
[1:49:26] what is it the body adds their faith to
[1:49:28] hers
[1:49:30] they're believing with her he says stand

[1:50:20] and that I added some virtue to her
[1:50:22] enough to where she could sit up but

[1:50:39] comes in and pours into that virtue
[1:50:41] and that woman sits up

[2:24:00] our blessed wonderful father we just bow
[2:24:02] Lord before you tonight today Father
[2:24:05] to Thank You Lord to thank you Lord for
[2:24:08] the grace Lord that you bestowed upon us
[2:24:10] father Lord to think that you would just
[2:24:14] take the lowliest of Sinners father
[2:24:17] and Lord just take us from lives of sin
[2:24:20] and bring us to the place father where
[2:24:22] we realize Lord that we are part of you
[2:24:25] and you became us father that we might
[2:24:28] become you and Lord you've given us a
[2:24:31] wonderful promise father of a
[2:24:32] resurrection and Rapture not that we
[2:24:34] deserve it Lord but because father you
[2:24:37] chose us before the foundation of the
[2:24:39] world
[2:24:40] and Lord you said father that you would
[2:24:42] take us right through father that you be
[2:24:44] with us you begin us right until the end
[2:24:47] and father every every every fiber in
[2:24:51] our being fathers should worship you and
[2:24:53] thank you Lord for father when we see
[2:24:55] this word where this world is father
[2:24:57] today Lord we see the sin all around us
[2:25:00] in the darkness father that we just sang
[2:25:01] about father but you wrapped yourself in
[2:25:03] light and by doing that Lord you wrapped
[2:25:06] Us in light as well and father because
[2:25:08] there is light in Goshen father as the
[2:25:10] word says and father by Grace Lord we
[2:25:13] can live in that light father and walk
[2:25:15] in that light as you are so we pray
[2:25:17] father that you'd help us as we go from
[2:25:19] here today
[2:25:20] and Lord you would help us always to
[2:25:22] realize father that we are your children
[2:25:24] and the father we want to be able to
[2:25:26] live Lord
[2:25:27] in that respect father where others will
[2:25:30] see that you were in as fatherly others
[2:25:32] will see that you father have been with
[2:25:34] us father so be with us as we go from
[2:25:37] here today help us Lord to look upon
[2:25:39] your word father and realize Lord that
[2:25:42] that book father that that book that we
[2:25:45] just sang about father lives in US
[2:25:47] father and Lord we just pray father that
[2:25:50] your blessed murder John father as he
[2:25:52] father take some rest today Lord and
[2:25:54] over the next few days and prepares for
[2:25:56] the next service and we pray father that
[2:25:59] you continue to lift us a little higher
[2:26:00] than you did today Father
[2:26:03] and our Lord you would bless him father
[2:26:05] with more Revelation with greater
[2:26:06] understanding father and that each one
[2:26:09] of us father would just come Lord to
[2:26:11] every service father expecting Lord
[2:26:13] praying for the men from the minister
[2:26:15] praying for our each other Lord and just
[2:26:18] drawing from Heaven that we might gain a
[2:26:20] little more of that rapturing Faith
[2:26:21] father
[2:26:22] so Lord we ask father that you bless
[2:26:24] each one especially the sisters the
[2:26:27] mothers the wives Lord father and the
[2:26:29] brothers father everybody here Lord and
[2:26:31] those that couldn't attend we just pray
[2:26:33] father that you're just pour out your
[2:26:36] spirit Upon Us in a mighty way father
[2:26:38] help us to look up Lord and to stay
[2:26:40] separated from the world as we commit
