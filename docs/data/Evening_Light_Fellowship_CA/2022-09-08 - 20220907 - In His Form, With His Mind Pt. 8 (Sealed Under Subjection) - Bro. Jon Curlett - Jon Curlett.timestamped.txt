[48:10] thank you lord for a city where you are
[48:11] the light
[48:13] lord thank you lord that our desire is
[48:14] not to stay here but it's to go to a
[48:16] place where all of these things are so
[48:19] lord they're so unworthy they're so old
[48:21] they're so faded lord they're so
[48:23] worthless to us lord that they can't

[48:30] and lord tonight we're satisfied to be
[48:32] in your presence lord god lord we're
[48:34] thankful you've brought us here but
[48:36] we're praying lord god that you
[48:37] administer now through the preaching of
[48:39] the word
[48:40] lord this is the main event this is why
[48:42] we come here the prophet said and it's
[48:44] not for me to speak lord but it's to you
[48:46] to speak heavenly father and so lord
[48:48] prepare the ears to hear lord prepare
[48:51] this vessel to transmit your word this
[48:52] evening we pray
[48:54] lord and where we have fallen short lord
[48:56] forgive us we pray for our silly
[48:58] mistakes or for wasted time and energy
[49:01] lord where we've given ourselves to
[49:02] something that doesn't please you
[49:04] lord we pray you forgive us this evening
[49:07] lord draw us a new closer to you we pray
[49:09] now in jesus christ's name we ask it
[49:12] amen
[49:13] and amen thank you musicians i
[49:15] appreciate it
[49:16] and certainly appreciate brother josh
[49:18] stepping up once again it's
[49:20] it's good to see him up here using his
[49:22] gift for all of our benefit not just
[49:23] once in a while but uh really putting
[49:25] his shoulder to the wheel
[49:27] amen certainly appreciating it's no it's
[49:29] no small thing
[49:31] listen when you get up in front of
[49:32] people and
[49:33] and you're expected to perform so often
[49:36] is what it is but it's not about
[49:37] performance it's about humility it's
[49:39] about subjection to the spirit and the
[49:41] leading of god and that takes courage
[49:43] takes bravery and we appreciate it
[49:45] brother josh you know brother bob might
[49:46] make it look easy sometimes and you know
[49:48] as a minister you get up behind somebody
[49:50] experienced and you think boy they just
[49:52] make it look easy but guess what every
[49:54] time they get up there's still got to be
[49:55] that submission and that tenderness to
[49:57] the leading of the holy spirit so it's
[49:59] no light thing and we need to be praying
[50:01] for him that god would bless him in that
[50:03] role that god would that god would make
[50:05] that gift manifest amen for the benefit
[50:07] of the body and that it would
[50:09] just be an anchor point for this church
[50:11] amen that the worship the worship always
[50:13] leads us into his presence it leads us
[50:15] to victory it leads us to deliverance it
[50:17] leads us to so many things and it sets
[50:19] the tone for the entire service amen so
[50:21] we rely on our song leaders to be led by
[50:23] the spirit of god amen and just trusting
[50:25] that's what's happened here this evening
[50:27] and then before we read i want to also
[50:29] thank those that that were at the church
[50:31] camp not just by attending but those
[50:33] that set it up and i know brother paul
[50:35] and sister kim took the the you know the
[50:37] the the main load there for getting
[50:38] things set up and whatnot but by no
[50:40] means were they you know alone it was
[50:42] everybody was helping and i was so
[50:44] pleased to see everybody helping in
[50:46] their own little way whether it was in
[50:47] the kitchen clean up and watching kids
[50:50] and giving breaks to this one and that
[50:51] one it was truly wonderful and i believe
[50:53] it was a wonderful time in the lord we
[50:55] had a very special service there
[50:58] amen i was
[50:59] i was so blessed by that service not in
[51:01] speaking but just the presence of god
[51:03] that was there and and the people came
[51:05] to have church you know
[51:06] to have church and and
[51:08] and that was just it meant a lot to me
[51:10] to see that we don't just put those
[51:11] things aside because we're away
[51:13] somewhere but that we could get in there
[51:14] and have a service as if we were right
[51:16] here and it was a special meetings or
[51:18] something like that that's what it felt
[51:19] like to me and there you know so i
[51:21] appreciate that i appreciate the the
[51:23] people getting in there and taking that
[51:24] seriously and i'm really looking for a
[51:26] blessing amen and we're hoping to do
[51:28] that again next year the lord willing
[51:30] and and maybe expand it just a little
[51:32] bit and and whatnot but we'll talk about
[51:34] that as we get closer but certainly
[51:36] appreciated each one that supported that
[51:37] with their presence their money their
[51:39] time their energy their effort we thank
[51:41] the lord we had a good time and a safe
[51:43] time for all that were there amen
[51:45] amen we're going to read from second
[51:46] corinthians chapter 4 and verse 1 this
[51:48] evening it says therefore seeing we have
[51:51] this ministry as we have received mercy
[51:54] we faint not it's his mercy we don't
[51:56] faint it's his mercy that keeps us going
[51:59] when others fall behind and fall by the
[52:00] wayside it says but we have renounced
[52:03] the hidden things of dishonesty not
[52:05] walking in craftiness nor handling the
[52:07] word of god deceitfully but by
[52:09] manifestation of the truth commending
[52:12] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[52:15] the sight of god that manifestation of
[52:17] the truth means we're living what we
[52:18] talk about i mean that's what people see
[52:21] is our life amen it's walking the walk
[52:23] not just talking the talk and that's
[52:25] what people take notice of is when you
[52:27] live different not just when you talk
[52:28] different and it pricks their conscience
[52:31] that what's that's what it means their
[52:32] pricks are conscious that our lives
[52:34] lived is what pricks are conscious and
[52:36] makes them stand up and take notice
[52:38] verse 3 says but if our gospel be hid it
[52:40] is hid to them that are lost
[52:43] in whom the god of this world hath
[52:45] blinded the minds of them which believe
[52:47] not lest the light of the glorious
[52:49] gospel of christ who is the image of god
[52:52] should shine unto him amen our light is
[52:54] not our own
[52:56] amen what he's saying is the light of
[52:57] the gospel of christ is what they see in
[52:59] our lives this is the manifestation of
[53:01] the sons of god it's the very image of
[53:03] god our gospel is the very reflection of
[53:06] god
[53:07] it says for we preach not ourselves
[53:11] but christ jesus the lord and ourselves
[53:13] your servants for jesus sake for god who
[53:16] commanded the light to shine out of
[53:18] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[53:20] give the light of the knowledge of the
[53:22] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[53:25] but we have this treasure in earthen
[53:28] vessels that the excellency of the power
[53:31] may be of god and not of us so you have
[53:33] a beautiful vessel you have a perfect
[53:35] vessel you have a strong vessel and
[53:37] guess what the glory can go to the
[53:39] vessel when it does and handle certain
[53:40] things you say well that vessel's worthy
[53:42] of honor but this honor is given to
[53:44] unworthy vessels it's given to frail
[53:46] vessels amen but it's a treasure
[53:48] nonetheless and he's put it in there for
[53:50] a reason amen and it's so that we don't
[53:52] get proud or high-minded and so that we
[53:54] don't get caught up in our achievements
[53:55] but we recognize that it's what's in us
[53:57] that makes us great not it's us that
[53:59] makes us great in the first place amen
[54:01] if there's any good that comes out of us
[54:02] it's because of the power and the grace
[54:04] of god in our lives it says we are
[54:06] troubled on every side yet not
[54:09] distressed
[54:10] we are perplexed but not in despair we
[54:13] are persecuted but not forsaken cast
[54:15] down but not destroyed
[54:17] this christian walk is not for wimps
[54:20] it's not for the faint-hearted it's not
[54:21] for the the weak it's not for the
[54:23] double-minded but it's for people that
[54:25] are committed to the walk amen amen we
[54:28] go through a lot as christians
[54:30] it says all will suffer persecution all
[54:33] are going to have a hard time all are
[54:34] going to go through chastisement all are
[54:36] going to go through the ringer they're
[54:38] going to be tested and they're going to
[54:39] be proven amen but it says that we are
[54:41] not destroyed
[54:43] everything we go through it may destroy
[54:45] a lesser person but because we have the
[54:47] seed of god in us it doesn't destroy us
[54:50] always bearing about in the body the
[54:52] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[54:55] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[54:57] our body
[54:58] for we which live are always delivered
[55:02] unto death
[55:03] for jesus sake
[55:04] that the life also of jesus might be
[55:07] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[55:09] he says so then death worketh in us
[55:12] but life in you
[55:13] and we having the same spirit of faith
[55:16] according as it is written i believed
[55:19] and therefore have i spoken
[55:21] we also believe
[55:23] and therefore speak amen god bless you
[55:25] you may have your seats this evening may
[55:27] god bless his word as we've read it amen
[55:29] and we're headed into the final stretch
[55:31] of this series of in his form and with
[55:33] his mind and we've covered the original
[55:35] position of humanity we covered the
[55:37] failure and fall from that position
[55:39] we've covered the the redemptive work of
[55:41] god to make a way back to our position
[55:43] and then in the last few services we've
[55:45] walked through the process of repentance
[55:47] that emptying out that dying to
[55:49] ourselves and then we talked about after
[55:51] that the pouring in of the spirit and
[55:53] the life of god into the true church of
[55:54] god which is the bride of christ amen
[55:57] and we want to take that now a little
[55:59] bit into kind of where the the rubber
[56:01] meets the road and you know after you've
[56:02] done all these things there's an action
[56:04] that follows there's a life that follows
[56:05] behind it and we we want to answer the
[56:08] question that says okay now that i've
[56:09] got the new birth and i'm filled with
[56:11] sealed with the holy spirit now what
[56:14] because that is hardly the end of it all
[56:16] and and so often you know we can get
[56:18] caught up in the idea of getting the
[56:20] holy ghost and then we get it and we
[56:21] don't know what to do with it and so in
[56:23] light of that i want to take a a
[56:25] subtitle this evening of sealed and
[56:27] under subjection and we we read in
[56:29] second corinthians about paul talking
[56:31] about the manifestation of the truth and
[56:33] we covered that manifestation of the
[56:35] sons of god a little bit in the last
[56:36] year when we preached on authority to
[56:38] believe and we kind of came up to a
[56:40] certain point and i backed away from it
[56:42] and we're about to head into there over
[56:43] the next two or three services lord
[56:45] willing and and i want to talk about
[56:47] what it looks like now when you catch
[56:48] that mind of christ and when you're
[56:50] sealed with the holy spirit what happens
[56:52] to your mind and what happens once you
[56:54] get that mind and how that plays out
[56:55] through the rest of the body
[56:57] and i want to start out with a diagram
[56:59] and this is what i had in that that
[57:01] series on authority to believe because
[57:03] what happens when we get the holy spirit
[57:05] is that we do one thing happens and that
[57:07] it settles for once and for all who's in
[57:10] control that's what happens when you get
[57:12] the holy spirit see what happens before
[57:15] this is your soul is an open door
[57:18] and satan can come in and go out and god
[57:20] can come in and out and the influence of
[57:22] the world can go in and out and the
[57:24] influence of the word can go in and out
[57:26] and until it's sealed you have that back
[57:28] and forth and you have that vacillating
[57:30] between the word and the world the word
[57:32] and the world and it goes back and forth
[57:34] and you're never stable
[57:35] you can see the benefits of the word but
[57:37] you're never committed to it and you're
[57:39] never resting on it and there's never a
[57:40] peace about it when you stick with what
[57:42] the word says but once you get the holy
[57:44] spirit once you are part of the new
[57:46] birth you experience a new birth now
[57:48] that soul is sealed
[57:50] right and it's sealed all the way to
[57:52] eternity it's sealed all the way to the
[57:54] day of your redemption amen the day that
[57:56] your body has changed and nothing can
[57:58] change that and so so often what happens
[58:00] is we get the holy ghost and we kind of
[58:02] just take a deep breath and we say
[58:04] that's it
[58:05] i've got it i don't have to worry
[58:06] anymore and you're right you don't have
[58:09] to worry about about it anymore you are
[58:11] sealed all the way to eternity if you
[58:13] die tomorrow if nothing else happened in
[58:15] your life if you died tomorrow having
[58:17] been sealed with the holy spirit you're
[58:18] going to be in heaven and you'll you'll
[58:21] re you've received eternal life and
[58:22] you'll spend eternity with christ
[58:24] okay that that's done and that's
[58:26] wonderful but you'll see when we look at
[58:28] the body that we have three rings we
[58:30] have three three three uh you know uh
[58:33] kingdoms if you will within the body and
[58:36] the holy spirit when you're sealed only
[58:38] seals the first one
[58:40] and so you're living in this body that's
[58:42] got two other realms and yet your holy s
[58:44] the holy spirit really only has control
[58:46] over one of them and the goal now is to
[58:48] get it now to move out and flow out of
[58:50] your life so that it can what push out
[58:52] the nature that is with this carnal
[58:54] flesh it can push out the influence of
[58:56] the world and the things of the world
[58:57] and it can start to bring your body and
[58:59] your mind and your your spirit into
[59:01] subjection so that god can use you in a
[59:03] more in a greater way if we could put it
[59:05] that way amen amen the new birth ensures
[59:08] that god has the final say in your life
[59:11] maybe not the first time because
[59:13] sometimes the outer the outer man and
[59:15] sometimes satan will get in there and
[59:16] he'll he'll get you to change your mind
[59:18] but the point is that when it's all said
[59:20] and done you'll come back to the word
[59:22] because that's what you're living by
[59:23] that's what you're resting on it's a
[59:25] part of you now it's not just it comes
[59:27] and goes but it's there until the day
[59:29] that you leave
[59:30] amen it's never going to leave you now
[59:32] the prophet of god said this he says
[59:34] when god made man he made him thus for
[59:37] he made this little certain compartment
[59:39] in the man for his own throne his
[59:42] control tower he said god wants to lead
[59:44] man but man wants to lead himself
[59:48] women want to lead themselves too
[59:50] amen let's not only focus on the men
[59:52] this is this is not specific to men
[59:54] humanity mankind wants to lead
[59:56] themselves and he says therefore there
[59:59] is a war
[1:00:00] what until you're saved until you get
[1:00:02] the new birth
[1:00:04] no he says therefore there is a war how
[1:00:07] long
[1:00:08] constantly
[1:00:09] every day of your life you're going to
[1:00:12] fight something
[1:00:13] because what the outer man wants to lead
[1:00:16] itself and the inner man wants to let
[1:00:18] the holy spirit lead and so you've got a
[1:00:20] war inside your body he says man wants
[1:00:22] to go after what he sees with his eyes
[1:00:24] and that's where he's deceived that's
[1:00:26] where satan deceived eve by what she
[1:00:28] could see the fruit was pleasant to the
[1:00:31] eye but it was death to the soul
[1:00:34] so it is tonight he says god wants to
[1:00:36] lead man so he made himself a little
[1:00:39] control tower in the midst of his heart
[1:00:40] which is the nature of the soul so that
[1:00:43] man would be led by the spirit of god he
[1:00:45] says getting off on his own leading is
[1:00:47] what separated him from his fellowship
[1:00:50] looking what he could see with his eyes
[1:00:52] so the new birth does not seal the inner
[1:00:55] five senses of your spirit realm it
[1:00:57] doesn't seal your imagination your
[1:00:58] conscience your memory your reason and
[1:01:00] your affection and so those are open to
[1:01:02] use and attack by satan
[1:01:05] it does not seal those things out amen
[1:01:08] why because that's not where god resides
[1:01:11] god doesn't reside in your imagination
[1:01:13] your conscience your memory your reason
[1:01:15] and affection
[1:01:16] that's not where he lives now he can use
[1:01:18] those and we'll get into that in a
[1:01:19] little bit but it's not where he lives
[1:01:21] he lives in the heart which is the
[1:01:22] nature of the soul the sealed off
[1:01:24] portion is where god is
[1:01:26] now the prophet of god says but that's
[1:01:28] where he stands yet tonight who the man
[1:01:30] under his own leadership he says all
[1:01:32] those who are led by such things the
[1:01:34] scripture says that sons and daughters
[1:01:36] of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:01:39] but he says this man that's led by his
[1:01:40] own leadership he says your emotions is
[1:01:43] your control
[1:01:45] he says and you can notice a man or
[1:01:47] woman that tries to walk after the
[1:01:48] things of the world they can never
[1:01:51] please god amen never please god
[1:01:54] not occasionally never please god even
[1:01:57] so much and i mention the scripture all
[1:01:59] the time it says in that day they'll
[1:02:00] come to him and say didn't we do all
[1:02:02] these things in your name and he says
[1:02:03] depart from me your workers of iniquity
[1:02:05] i never knew you even though they did
[1:02:07] spiritual things in the name of jesus
[1:02:09] christ yet they could not please god
[1:02:13] amen he says but a man or a woman that
[1:02:17] will not look at the things of the world
[1:02:20] but just go according to the leading of
[1:02:22] the spirit they're usually in the will
[1:02:25] of god
[1:02:26] now you say how can they be usually if
[1:02:28] they're led by the spirit of god
[1:02:30] because your motive and your objectives
[1:02:31] still play into it
[1:02:33] and then you can do the right thing the
[1:02:35] wrong way with the wrong motive or
[1:02:36] objective and be out of the will of god
[1:02:38] your action is right but the reason
[1:02:40] you're doing it is still wrong and
[1:02:41] therefore you're not perfectly in the
[1:02:43] will of god
[1:02:44] your leadership is right but you haven't
[1:02:45] surrendered yourself to the leading of
[1:02:47] god completely
[1:02:48] he says that is the great fight tonight
[1:02:51] satan took the eye a man's head to
[1:02:53] control him by his head and god took his
[1:02:56] heart so you'll remember we had this we
[1:02:59] had the soul and the spirit and we said
[1:03:01] that the mind is the gate between the
[1:03:03] soul and the spirit
[1:03:05] that your mind brother brown would said
[1:03:06] you have to let your mind believe to
[1:03:09] accept the word of god and then it can
[1:03:11] flow out of your soul which is where the
[1:03:13] word is and it can now come into your
[1:03:15] spirit and your body and have an effect
[1:03:17] so the mind being the gate between the
[1:03:19] soul and the spirit that controls what
[1:03:22] what influence your spirit is now going
[1:03:24] to be under the soul sealed so it can't
[1:03:25] go in but it can allow things out and
[1:03:28] the goal is to let things come out of
[1:03:30] your soul through your mind and into
[1:03:31] your spirit rather than let things try
[1:03:33] and come in from your spirit into your
[1:03:35] soul
[1:03:36] and brother braham says this is the
[1:03:38] greatest battle ever fought is for the
[1:03:40] control of your mind
[1:03:42] because satan has taken your mind and
[1:03:44] god has taken your soul but satan if he
[1:03:46] can control your mind will block faith
[1:03:48] will block the effect of the word for
[1:03:50] manifesting in your life and in your
[1:03:52] relationships and in your in your entire
[1:03:55] your entire being if we could put it
[1:03:56] that way right
[1:03:58] so the new birth doesn't seal this out
[1:04:01] and if you're hoping for a time that
[1:04:02] this is going to be sealed then good
[1:04:05] luck the prophet of god says we battle
[1:04:07] constantly in this realm it is always
[1:04:10] going to be a fight and that's why i
[1:04:12] talk about that this is not this is not
[1:04:14] something that's going to be sealed but
[1:04:16] this is something we see that the
[1:04:17] scripture says is in subjection amen
[1:04:20] that it is subject to something that is
[1:04:22] under an authority that keeps it in
[1:04:24] check and commits it to do what that
[1:04:27] higher authority says and that's what
[1:04:29] we're looking for is to bring our our
[1:04:31] spirit realm and our body realm now into
[1:04:33] subjection to the to the will and the
[1:04:35] purpose of god which is always what his
[1:04:37] word
[1:04:38] it's always his word it's going to go
[1:04:40] under his word
[1:04:41] now brother brown's talking about the
[1:04:42] greatest battle ever fought and he said
[1:04:44] see his attack satan's attack his attack
[1:04:48] is what disbelieve god's word that's his
[1:04:51] attack there can you see the greatest
[1:04:53] battle was ever fought there's only two
[1:04:55] forces satan and god there is no neutral
[1:04:58] party there's god and there's everything
[1:05:00] else he says and what is satan's weapon
[1:05:02] against you it's to try to get you to
[1:05:05] disbelieve your weapon
[1:05:07] and notice he puts a capital w on the
[1:05:09] weapon why because the weapon of god is
[1:05:12] the word of god he says he disarms you
[1:05:16] let's listen real quiet now listen if he
[1:05:18] can get you to disbelieve your weapon is
[1:05:21] equivalent
[1:05:22] if he gets you to believe your weapon is
[1:05:24] not strong enough he has disarmed you
[1:05:28] look he's disarmed you when he gets you
[1:05:30] to disbelieve that weapon when you lay
[1:05:33] that down that finishes your fight
[1:05:35] you're done so he says hold that weapon
[1:05:39] don't you lay it down that's what i've
[1:05:41] said so many times before if all you
[1:05:44] have is one scripture use that scripture
[1:05:47] guess what brother branham said that the
[1:05:49] word of god will defeat satan any place
[1:05:51] any time
[1:05:53] if you take the word of god and you
[1:05:55] stick with it and you use it it will
[1:05:57] always win
[1:05:59] just don't forget it's not always when
[1:06:01] you want it to win amen it is a battle
[1:06:03] it's going to go on for some time many
[1:06:05] times amen hold your weapon he says
[1:06:07] don't lay it down
[1:06:09] now those inner five senses are
[1:06:11] controlled by your mind
[1:06:13] your imagination conscience memory
[1:06:15] affection and reason and these things
[1:06:16] they're all controlled by your mind so
[1:06:18] if your mind can take on the mind of
[1:06:20] christ rather than the mind of the world
[1:06:22] then now you've got the opportunity to
[1:06:24] bring your spirit realm into subjection
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:27] now satan you would say well why doesn't
[1:06:29] he use
[1:06:30] that spirit realm why does he grab the
[1:06:32] mind why doesn't he use the outer senses
[1:06:34] as his primary weapon because brother
[1:06:36] brahm didn't say he used the five outer
[1:06:37] senses he says he uses the five inner
[1:06:40] senses why
[1:06:41] because look if there's something wrong
[1:06:43] in front of my eyes i can close my eyes
[1:06:45] i can walk away and satan can't bring
[1:06:47] that into my house satan can't make me
[1:06:50] see something i don't want to see
[1:06:52] listen if the music that's playing is
[1:06:53] wrong i can turn it off i can get myself
[1:06:56] out of that situation satan can't force
[1:06:58] me to drink alcohol or take drugs
[1:07:01] satan can't force me to touch and do
[1:07:03] things that i don't want to do
[1:07:05] but guess what i can't stop his thoughts
[1:07:08] from coming in amen i can't stop my
[1:07:10] imagination from working i can't forget
[1:07:13] memories
[1:07:14] so if satan can get in there he can work
[1:07:17] on me 24 hours a day seven days a week
[1:07:20] 365 days a year it's an all access pass
[1:07:23] to jonathan curlette is my mind which is
[1:07:26] why he picked it it gives him access no
[1:07:28] matter what i can't turn my mind off
[1:07:32] so satan is always working in there and
[1:07:34] he's always battling to try and get your
[1:07:35] attention trying to influence you to get
[1:07:37] you to do something that the word says
[1:07:39] you're not going to do amen we've been
[1:07:41] preaching that we're to take the battle
[1:07:42] of christ or the mind of christ and
[1:07:45] another way of saying that is that your
[1:07:47] natural mind is supposed to lose its
[1:07:49] battle with the holy spirit
[1:07:50] that's what we're talking about is when
[1:07:52] your natural mind is so overwhelmed by
[1:07:54] the word coming out of you by the
[1:07:56] leadership and the influence of the holy
[1:07:58] spirit in your life that you lay aside
[1:08:00] your natural way of thinking that's when
[1:08:02] you take on the mind of christ when what
[1:08:04] it is controlled by the life of god when
[1:08:06] it is controlled by the word of god when
[1:08:08] it is controlled by the spirit of god
[1:08:09] that's when you've taken on the mind of
[1:08:11] christ
[1:08:12] and so what you'll find is you're going
[1:08:13] to have the mind of christ at certain
[1:08:15] times in certain areas
[1:08:17] of your life
[1:08:18] we don't have it all right now i don't
[1:08:20] think any one of us could look at our
[1:08:22] lives and say i have the mind of christ
[1:08:24] in every area we said that would be our
[1:08:26] confession and that would be our
[1:08:27] profession but we would say that we're
[1:08:29] still struggling in certain areas
[1:08:30] wouldn't we
[1:08:31] absolutely uh i am at least me and
[1:08:34] brother joe we got a couple more there
[1:08:35] we go brother paul as well praise the
[1:08:37] lord
[1:08:38] but what it's a constant battle and that
[1:08:40] means that there's going to be back and
[1:08:42] forth there's going to be days where
[1:08:43] you'll win and there's going to be days
[1:08:45] where you lose amen
[1:08:47] but that doesn't mean you've lost the
[1:08:48] the war just means you might have lost
[1:08:50] that battle and you need to keep that
[1:08:51] now under prayer and you've got to get
[1:08:53] yourself built up in the most holy faith
[1:08:55] amen but we're trying to bring it now
[1:08:57] under subjection to the word of god and
[1:08:59] we read this in the last couple of
[1:09:00] services in romans it says and be not
[1:09:03] conformed to this world but be ye
[1:09:05] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:09:07] your mind has to be renewed to get the
[1:09:09] transformation to work its way through
[1:09:11] the rest of your body and then your soul
[1:09:13] doesn't need a renewing it gets a new
[1:09:15] birth i mean there's a new birth that
[1:09:17] happens that's a new creature but he
[1:09:18] says the rest of what you've got comes
[1:09:20] into a renewal now it brings you back to
[1:09:23] the way you used to think guess what you
[1:09:25] didn't used to think like the way you
[1:09:27] think now your natural inclination used
[1:09:29] to be that you would obey the word of
[1:09:31] god as a son and daughter of god if you
[1:09:33] were born the way you were supposed to
[1:09:35] be born in a time and in a
[1:09:37] you know the way adam and eve were you
[1:09:39] would naturally follow the word of god
[1:09:43] and you know what we still have the a
[1:09:45] bit remaining in our life that reminds
[1:09:47] us of that and it's called a conscience
[1:09:50] it's one of the things that sets us
[1:09:51] aside from the animals is that we will
[1:09:53] do things that are contrary to our very
[1:09:55] survival for the sake of right and wrong
[1:09:58] you know what it is that's the rem the
[1:09:59] remnants of what your mind used to be
[1:10:01] like your conscience is the remnants of
[1:10:04] what it was supposed to be like that you
[1:10:05] would do what was right no matter what
[1:10:08] but now we can override our conscience
[1:10:10] of course we see it going all around the
[1:10:11] world but says be transformed by the
[1:10:14] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:10:16] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:10:19] perfect will of god amen but paul is
[1:10:22] pointing us back to this idea of the new
[1:10:24] birth that after the new birth there's a
[1:10:26] battle that starts and it continues and
[1:10:28] it's going to keep going on and on and
[1:10:29] on until we come very close to that
[1:10:31] resurrection in that rapture now this is
[1:10:34] just me this is thus saith brother john
[1:10:36] i believe at the end he'll be completely
[1:10:37] shut out
[1:10:38] amen i believe that that when the bride
[1:10:40] is in unity when we've come into full
[1:10:42] maturity that just like satan is bound
[1:10:44] by chains of circumstance
[1:10:46] in the millennial reign where he has
[1:10:48] nobody to work in i believe that's going
[1:10:49] to be his position in the bride he has
[1:10:51] nobody to work with they will be so sold
[1:10:53] out they will be so sealed body soul and
[1:10:56] spirit that he can't get them to do
[1:10:58] anything doesn't mean he won't try but
[1:11:00] he will not have success in that pride i
[1:11:01] believe she'll rise above it all amen
[1:11:03] and that and just before we go then
[1:11:05] there'll be that quick short work and he
[1:11:07] will be completely powerless to work in
[1:11:09] our lives we won't have any time we
[1:11:10] won't have any conversations there'll be
[1:11:12] nothing left for him to do but just
[1:11:14] stand outside in frustration and pound
[1:11:16] on the door and hope that we open it up
[1:11:18] that's me that's me
[1:11:20] amen i believe that we're going to be
[1:11:21] completely victorious before we leave
[1:11:23] here
[1:11:24] amen but brother branham said that
[1:11:27] satan's tactics were to get us to
[1:11:29] believe that our weapon the word of god
[1:11:31] is not equal to his weapon
[1:11:33] now what does satan use
[1:11:35] to get us to disbelieve our weapon
[1:11:38] two things doubt and fear
[1:11:41] and what he does the way he does that is
[1:11:42] he magnifies the things that we see hear
[1:11:45] feel remember you know your inner senses
[1:11:47] and your five outer senses all of these
[1:11:49] things and he takes what is the
[1:11:51] information that's fed into those and he
[1:11:53] magnifies it
[1:11:55] to cause you to think that it's greater
[1:11:56] than what it actually is
[1:11:58] amen right fear is only what a concern
[1:12:01] of the unknown
[1:12:03] it isn't guaranteed it's not proven but
[1:12:05] you're worried about what might be which
[1:12:06] when you think about it is the silliest
[1:12:08] thing to get worked up about what might
[1:12:10] be
[1:12:10] now what it what it is is a natural
[1:12:12] instinct it's something that's built
[1:12:14] into us so that we recognize things that
[1:12:16] are happening we make a a calculation
[1:12:18] say it's possible or probable that this
[1:12:20] will happen and so we can make up a plan
[1:12:22] to get away to stay safe back in you
[1:12:25] know the prehistoric days you know when
[1:12:27] a lion was going around if you heard a
[1:12:28] lion roar you went someplace safe you
[1:12:30] didn't sit around until you heard until
[1:12:31] you saw the line in front of you right
[1:12:33] that's a preservation instinct and
[1:12:35] that's what these things are that fear
[1:12:37] was supposed to preserve your life but
[1:12:39] now satan's doing it to keep you from
[1:12:41] preserving your life amen from giving
[1:12:43] your life over to something else he
[1:12:45] wants you to fear what's going to happen
[1:12:47] so that it keeps you away from the
[1:12:48] promises of god right he's trying to get
[1:12:50] you to doubt that the word is sufficient
[1:12:52] to handle what you're dealing with in
[1:12:54] your life in your body and your mind and
[1:12:55] your soul and your spirit wherever it
[1:12:57] might be he's trying to get you to doubt
[1:12:58] that if you trust the word it'll take
[1:13:00] care of the situation
[1:13:01] i love it i was talking to brother
[1:13:03] garfield here a while ago and he says i
[1:13:05] don't he said something he said i don't
[1:13:06] worry about what's coming out
[1:13:08] necessarily he says as long as the word
[1:13:11] is being preached and as long as the
[1:13:12] word has been put into my life it will
[1:13:14] have the effect when it needs to have
[1:13:16] the effect i thought that was pretty
[1:13:18] pretty amazing to say that because we
[1:13:20] trust what the long work
[1:13:22] right we trust the process we don't just
[1:13:25] we're we're not creatures of uh of right
[1:13:28] now my way my time but we trust the
[1:13:30] process that it will do what god has
[1:13:32] sent it forth to do in our lives
[1:13:34] second corinthians 10 says for though we
[1:13:37] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:13:39] the flesh so other words although we
[1:13:41] live in a carnal world and in a carnal
[1:13:43] body we don't fight flesh with our
[1:13:45] natural weapons
[1:13:46] right there's a different weapon there's
[1:13:48] a different set of weapons that's given
[1:13:50] to us it won't work and it never will
[1:13:51] work never has never will he says for
[1:13:54] the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:13:57] carnal
[1:13:58] but mighty through god to the pulling
[1:14:00] down of strongholds so let me say this
[1:14:02] if you have a stronghold that's not a
[1:14:04] problem
[1:14:05] because we've been given a promise and a
[1:14:07] weapon that will tear it down don't
[1:14:09] worry if you have the stronghold worry
[1:14:11] do you have the weapon that will take it
[1:14:12] down that's what the christian needs to
[1:14:14] know do i have the right weapon in my
[1:14:16] hand to tear the stronghold down in my
[1:14:18] life
[1:14:18] what do those weapons do they cast down
[1:14:21] what are those strongholds what do they
[1:14:23] look like casting down imaginations
[1:14:26] and every high thing every high thing
[1:14:30] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:14:32] of god and bringing into captivity
[1:14:36] every thought
[1:14:38] every thought to the obedience of christ
[1:14:42] now he says exalting itself against the
[1:14:44] knowledge of god the knowledge of god is
[1:14:46] by revelation through experience
[1:14:50] it is not intellectual it is not just by
[1:14:52] hearing but it is by living it is a word
[1:14:55] express coming out of you that's the
[1:14:57] knowledge of god is when you have tasted
[1:14:59] and seen that the lord is good not that
[1:15:01] just you have heard it but you know it
[1:15:03] because you've experienced it that's the
[1:15:05] knowledge of god and it says the weapons
[1:15:07] that we have will say i've got a reality
[1:15:09] so you can't tell me it's not real i've
[1:15:12] seen the effect of the word so don't
[1:15:13] tell me that this word won't work again
[1:15:15] amen the greatest revelation you can
[1:15:18] have is the first time you trust god's
[1:15:19] word and it does exactly what it said
[1:15:22] then you know that it'll do it the next
[1:15:23] time and the next time and the next time
[1:15:25] and all of a sudden you're walking by
[1:15:26] faith and not by sight amen amen
[1:15:29] what is it satan's trying to what use
[1:15:31] our mind as a tool to make things that
[1:15:33] aren't real appear as real
[1:15:36] guess what the word of god does the
[1:15:37] exact same thing
[1:15:39] what abraham called those things which
[1:15:41] were not as though they were the
[1:15:43] difference is that god's promise isn't
[1:15:45] associated with fear and doubt
[1:15:47] it's associated with healing it's
[1:15:49] associated with peace rest love joy all
[1:15:52] of these different things amen
[1:15:53] so let me ask you if what's happening to
[1:15:55] you is causing you to fear then it
[1:15:57] cannot be the influence of god in your
[1:15:58] life
[1:16:00] it'll never bring that amen
[1:16:01] amen we are children of abraham and we
[1:16:03] call those things as not as though they
[1:16:05] were by the word
[1:16:07] by the word amen
[1:16:09] we believe and therefore we speak as we
[1:16:11] read in the first scripture amen second
[1:16:13] timothy 1 7 says for god had not given
[1:16:16] us the spirit of fear
[1:16:18] if you're scared it is not the anointing
[1:16:19] of god
[1:16:21] unless it is what a holy fear a holy
[1:16:24] reverence a holy respect for the things
[1:16:26] of god if that fear drives you to the
[1:16:29] word then it's god but it's driving you
[1:16:31] away from the word of god then you know
[1:16:33] that it's a satanic influence every
[1:16:35] single time
[1:16:37] he says what he has not given us a
[1:16:39] spirit of fear but a power
[1:16:42] of love
[1:16:43] and of a sound mind amen so when you're
[1:16:46] walking through life what is your
[1:16:48] response is it fear satanic is it love
[1:16:51] it's god amen is it panic
[1:16:55] panic is never of god
[1:16:57] you never have to make a quick decision
[1:17:01] that takes you out of the will of god
[1:17:03] you can always rest you can always wait
[1:17:07] there's no reason to panic
[1:17:09] there's never a reason to panic there's
[1:17:11] never a reason to have to make a snap
[1:17:12] decision without consulting the lord
[1:17:15] there's no reason for it amen
[1:17:17] what is it satan is taking those things
[1:17:19] that aren't real and he's magnifying
[1:17:20] them to try and get you to panic
[1:17:23] right
[1:17:24] to doubt to worry to fear to get caught
[1:17:27] up in what it looks like rather than
[1:17:29] sitting back and saying
[1:17:30] what is this really
[1:17:32] and more importantly what does the word
[1:17:33] of god say it is
[1:17:35] because if satan's magnifying it he's
[1:17:37] going to try to turn it into something
[1:17:39] that you can't overcome or you haven't
[1:17:40] ever overcome and you're going to sit
[1:17:42] there and say now what do i do
[1:17:44] now what do i do how do i take this one
[1:17:46] down the word of god every single time
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:51] i remember we read that quote in where
[1:17:53] brother bram says when the enemy comes
[1:17:54] in like the flood like a flood the
[1:17:56] spirit of god will raise up a standard
[1:17:57] and he says the raising of a standard is
[1:18:00] god pouring his spirit into your life
[1:18:03] i love that it's become it's it's become
[1:18:05] my creed
[1:18:07] i think for 2022 is when things rise up
[1:18:10] look for more of god to be poured into
[1:18:12] you ask for more of the holy spirit ask
[1:18:14] god to raise a standard in your life to
[1:18:16] what holds you steady though the flood
[1:18:18] rises up against you at the same time
[1:18:20] amen to not allow you to step back to
[1:18:23] not force you to make a panic decision
[1:18:25] to not make you react with your emotions
[1:18:27] to not react with your your memory and
[1:18:29] your conscience in these different
[1:18:31] things amen
[1:18:32] when our emotions get strong what puts
[1:18:34] it pushes it back the holy spirit that
[1:18:36] says what does the word say
[1:18:38] amen when we get offended what pushes
[1:18:39] that offense back and says
[1:18:41] is this really worth getting all up in
[1:18:43] arms about the holy spirit
[1:18:45] right
[1:18:46] when our memory takes us places where we
[1:18:48] ought not to have been
[1:18:50] what pushes it back the holy spirit that
[1:18:52] says that's under the blood
[1:18:54] amen when our conscience is bothering us
[1:18:56] then what is it that takes us back into
[1:18:58] the presence of god
[1:18:59] it's what it's reminding us of the
[1:19:01] finished work of calvary amen satan
[1:19:03] magnifies those things and all you have
[1:19:04] to look at the word and say the word
[1:19:05] already addressed this
[1:19:07] i don't even have to talk to you about
[1:19:08] it satan i don't have to worry about it
[1:19:10] because the word already says i'm free
[1:19:12] i'm delivered i'm clean spotless
[1:19:15] i'm already raptured and resurrected
[1:19:16] brother gerald amen amen i'm already a
[1:19:19] finished work in his eyes
[1:19:21] the filter he's looking at me through is
[1:19:23] the blood of christ and that makes me
[1:19:24] look perfect to him amen
[1:19:27] satan's the biggest magnifier there is
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:30] but it's a false magnification because
[1:19:32] he's trying to get you to think that the
[1:19:34] word won't handle your situation amen
[1:19:36] that's why we've got to keep our fires
[1:19:38] lit
[1:19:39] you know what if you're cold
[1:19:41] starchy if you're formal
[1:19:44] that'll work every single time
[1:19:46] because you've got nothing to fight with
[1:19:47] you've got no life within you to raise
[1:19:49] up and then you've got to go to god
[1:19:51] maybe you'll finally remember and say oh
[1:19:53] god you actually you can help me can't
[1:19:54] you pour your spirit in show me your
[1:19:56] word give me a give me a scripture to
[1:19:58] take me through this trial in this
[1:20:00] situation but if your fire is not lit if
[1:20:02] you're not on fire for god then you're
[1:20:03] going to face some real difficulty when
[1:20:05] these trials come up aren't they because
[1:20:07] the magnification of the world will be
[1:20:08] greater than the experience you had with
[1:20:10] god today
[1:20:11] or yesterday or last week or last month
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:14] read your bible and pray that's how you
[1:20:16] keep your fires lit amen
[1:20:18] every day we're fighting as we read in
[1:20:20] second corinthians amen to cast down
[1:20:21] imaginations
[1:20:23] to not get caught up in the appearance
[1:20:24] of things and men do not get scared or
[1:20:27] offended
[1:20:28] that's a big deal these days you know as
[1:20:30] the church gets bigger and i pray the
[1:20:32] lord will bless us and break make it
[1:20:33] bigger guess what more opportunities for
[1:20:35] offenses will come up more opportunities
[1:20:38] for friction and guess what satan wants
[1:20:39] you to take those and use it to move
[1:20:41] away move away meaning separate yourself
[1:20:43] from fellowship to cause yourself to
[1:20:45] look down your nose at a brother or
[1:20:46] sister that did something you didn't
[1:20:48] think they ought to have done amen
[1:20:50] pain and panic are what causes animals
[1:20:52] to die in the wild
[1:20:53] pack animals i'm talking about herd
[1:20:55] animals if the sheep will stay together
[1:20:57] even sheep as helpless as they are
[1:20:59] they're very difficult for the wolves to
[1:21:00] get into but if they can get one to run
[1:21:02] away
[1:21:02] they'll take that down every time and
[1:21:04] guess what the biggest animals can be
[1:21:06] taken down if they get away from the
[1:21:07] protection of the herd amen scattering
[1:21:09] the sheep that's the tactic of wolves
[1:21:11] and lions that's the two things we're
[1:21:12] warned against satan goes around as a
[1:21:14] roaring lion and then we heard about it
[1:21:16] in the in the message the other day from
[1:21:17] brother jared where he talked about what
[1:21:19] those wolves from amongst you that try
[1:21:21] and separate the people out and draw
[1:21:22] people to themselves rather than point
[1:21:24] them to the word
[1:21:25] what is it satan can get you alone he's
[1:21:28] got you beat and you won't even know
[1:21:29] he's eating you
[1:21:31] that's the sad part is you won't even
[1:21:33] know you're defeated because he's picked
[1:21:35] you off and you've gotten away from what
[1:21:37] the umbrella of the authority of the
[1:21:39] word and the gathering yourselves
[1:21:40] together and you're hooped and you don't
[1:21:41] even know it
[1:21:43] and then you wonder why your life feels
[1:21:44] pointless and lonely and you get
[1:21:46] depressed and you get worried and you
[1:21:48] get more and more prickly in these
[1:21:49] different things why it's because you're
[1:21:51] out from under the umbrella of the word
[1:21:53] that's what happens he gets you by
[1:21:55] yourself you become a law to yourself
[1:21:57] and you become a denomination
[1:21:59] amen
[1:22:01] but our goal
[1:22:02] once let me say this
[1:22:05] you know what happens when satan gets
[1:22:06] you out
[1:22:07] you say well he let me out he's going to
[1:22:09] keep leading me you know what satan does
[1:22:11] he lets you lead yourself
[1:22:13] you become a law unto yourself you start
[1:22:16] to lead yourself and satan doesn't have
[1:22:17] to even touch you because any leadership
[1:22:19] that's not of god is satanic by its
[1:22:21] definition because there's only two
[1:22:23] sides there's only god and satan so if
[1:22:25] you're not led by god whether it's
[1:22:26] yourself or anyone else you are under
[1:22:28] satanic leadership satan doesn't even
[1:22:30] need to lead you he just leaves you to
[1:22:31] yourself and you'll follow your own
[1:22:33] lusts your own desires your own
[1:22:34] preferences your own ideas and you'll
[1:22:36] lead yourself straight into the desert
[1:22:37] and die
[1:22:38] that's what happens amen
[1:22:42] amen but our goal once we have the holy
[1:22:43] spirit is to let it apply the word by
[1:22:46] faith
[1:22:46] through our mind and now bring these
[1:22:48] things that are in our spirit realm
[1:22:50] under subjection to the holy spirit
[1:22:52] that's what the renewing of the mind is
[1:22:53] it takes us back to the leadership of
[1:22:55] god remember brother brown said in we've
[1:22:57] read the quote many times where he says
[1:22:59] that in the original creation that man
[1:23:01] was led by the holy spirit and he led
[1:23:03] the animals by that same spirit
[1:23:06] it was under the leadership of god that
[1:23:08] that man ruled and reigned on this earth
[1:23:09] amen so like i said before the spirit
[1:23:12] realm is not sealed like the soul but it
[1:23:13] becomes to a place where it's under the
[1:23:15] control of the holy spirit and that's
[1:23:17] what we're looking for is where there's
[1:23:18] enough of a fountain of life there's
[1:23:21] enough of a fountain of the word inside
[1:23:23] of us that it's pushing out and it's
[1:23:25] starting to influence that spirit realm
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:28] so what happens now is when we come to
[1:23:31] this place it looks a little bit like
[1:23:32] this so you have your soul that's sealed
[1:23:34] by the holy spirit and then with that
[1:23:36] and remember this was from authority to
[1:23:38] believe but you catch what the will of
[1:23:40] god
[1:23:41] and that gives you faith to do what god
[1:23:43] wants you to do in the word and so it
[1:23:45] kicks out doubt
[1:23:47] and now it starts to press out into the
[1:23:48] spirit realm so now it starts to take
[1:23:50] over your imagination so now it starts
[1:23:52] to take over your conscience your memory
[1:23:53] your reason your affection you say well
[1:23:55] what does that even look like
[1:23:58] what does that look like when you're
[1:23:59] when your imagination is under the
[1:24:01] influence of the holy spirit
[1:24:02] now you can imagine yourself healed
[1:24:05] instead of sitting there with a
[1:24:06] degenerative disease for the rest of
[1:24:07] your life
[1:24:09] that's what it looks like your
[1:24:10] imagination now will take you to the
[1:24:11] promises of god rather than the
[1:24:13] depression of where you're sitting right
[1:24:15] now today in your current condition amen
[1:24:17] what will it do your memory when it's
[1:24:19] under the influence of the holy spirit
[1:24:21] will not remember what your brother or
[1:24:23] sister did to you but it will remember
[1:24:24] the shed blood of calvary that forgave
[1:24:26] you and asks you to forgive them the
[1:24:28] same way amen that it will cleanse your
[1:24:30] conscience so that instead of driving
[1:24:32] you away from the presence of god it
[1:24:34] drives you into the presence of god and
[1:24:36] it draws you near to him rather than
[1:24:38] pushes you away from it
[1:24:40] that's how you know when he's working in
[1:24:41] you is that it starts to drive you to
[1:24:43] looking at things the way god looks at
[1:24:45] them and looking at them through the
[1:24:46] filter of the word rather than filter
[1:24:48] them through your own carnal realities
[1:24:52] amen that it starts to put the word out
[1:24:54] there and says i'm going to choose to
[1:24:55] look at situations i'm going to choose
[1:24:57] to look at people through the promises
[1:24:59] and the realities of the word rather
[1:25:01] than what i've experienced in my carnal
[1:25:02] flesh that's how you know that that's
[1:25:04] what's happening inside of your life
[1:25:06] amen
[1:25:08] that's what we're trying to get to
[1:25:10] because if that mind can get opened up
[1:25:12] by faith to the word of god and it
[1:25:13] starts to push out all of a sudden now
[1:25:16] satan is he becomes really powerless
[1:25:18] really quickly in your life because the
[1:25:20] mind is his stronghold that's where he
[1:25:21] loves to hang out and when the word is
[1:25:23] flowing through there and it's pushing
[1:25:25] one way through that door he can't set
[1:25:27] up a camp there he can't get in there
[1:25:29] and hold on to you he can't get his
[1:25:30] talons into your mind there and so what
[1:25:32] happens is you start to push out all
[1:25:33] these things that have held you back
[1:25:35] through your life
[1:25:36] i remember i was in a a
[1:25:39] a men's meeting one time
[1:25:42] and and a brother asked
[1:25:44] he said
[1:25:46] we're dealing you know
[1:25:47] we're we're married men and we're
[1:25:49] dealing with situations in our homes and
[1:25:50] we're dealing with situations in our
[1:25:52] lives he says and everybody says get the
[1:25:54] holy spirit he says
[1:25:56] but he says can you give me something
[1:25:57] practical
[1:25:59] that'll help me
[1:26:01] and the answer is no
[1:26:03] there is nothing practical that will
[1:26:05] actually help you aside from the holy
[1:26:07] spirit that's why you need a new birth
[1:26:09] the new birth is the victory that's what
[1:26:11] we're looking for is victory and the new
[1:26:13] birth is the victory it's the holy
[1:26:14] spirit inside of you that's the one
[1:26:16] that's going to take you all the way so
[1:26:17] you can sit here and yes i can give you
[1:26:19] principles day after day but guess what
[1:26:21] until it's until it starts flowing from
[1:26:23] the inside out it's never going to stick
[1:26:26] it's never going to really take effect
[1:26:27] it's never going to push satan out it's
[1:26:29] just going to temporarily get you some
[1:26:31] respite until what he builds up another
[1:26:34] flood and comes in and washes away every
[1:26:36] principle you've had and you panic and
[1:26:37] you go out and do the same thing you've
[1:26:38] always done why because you haven't been
[1:26:40] settled inside the scripture says a
[1:26:42] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[1:26:44] his ways why because he hasn't been
[1:26:46] convinced he hasn't been
[1:26:48] converted he hasn't been converted and
[1:26:51] so he vacillates back and forth word
[1:26:52] world word world and he's going back and
[1:26:54] forth and guess what that's a man that
[1:26:56] can only take principles of the word
[1:26:58] because the word isn't inside of him
[1:27:00] all he's taking is the knowledge of the
[1:27:02] word rather than what the knowledge of
[1:27:03] christ which is of revelation by
[1:27:05] experience
[1:27:06] he's just taking it as good ideas as as
[1:27:09] something i can apply to my life rather
[1:27:11] than something that is my life right and
[1:27:13] then something from the inside out it's
[1:27:15] a wellspring inside of us that's coming
[1:27:17] out otherwise it's going to come in the
[1:27:18] opposite way and anything that comes in
[1:27:20] from the outside can be pushed out but
[1:27:22] if it's living and anchored and sealed
[1:27:24] on the inside nothing can take it away
[1:27:26] and you'll always come back to it that's
[1:27:28] why you've got to get the inside seal
[1:27:30] that's why we don't tell it we don't
[1:27:31] force our kids to do certain things
[1:27:34] that's why we're not legalistic about it
[1:27:36] that we give them grace to grow and
[1:27:38] learn is because if it doesn't happen
[1:27:39] naturally then it's never going to stick
[1:27:41] anyways god's got to deal with them as
[1:27:43] sons and daughters the same way he did
[1:27:45] with us and it's a maturing and a
[1:27:46] growing process in their lives amen
[1:27:49] so instead of being influenced from the
[1:27:50] outside now we're being influenced and
[1:27:52] controlled from what's on the very
[1:27:54] inside of you that cannot be touched
[1:27:55] that cannot be removed that cannot be
[1:27:57] depleted
[1:27:59] the only thing that's limiting us is how
[1:28:00] much we'll let it come out
[1:28:02] amen and brother branham teaches us he
[1:28:04] says that is the mind that's controlling
[1:28:05] that and that's why satan's kept out
[1:28:06] there because if he can choke that mind
[1:28:08] down so that only a little bit of faith
[1:28:10] comes through he says he's got you beat
[1:28:11] most of the time
[1:28:13] but if you can get that opened up under
[1:28:15] what the preaching of the word right
[1:28:18] that's what gives us faith there's only
[1:28:20] one way you get faith and that's by the
[1:28:21] preaching of the word by the hearing of
[1:28:23] the word let me say it that way the
[1:28:24] hearing of the word right whether it's
[1:28:26] me whether it's brother jail whether
[1:28:27] it's brother branham whether it's some
[1:28:28] other preacher under the hearing of the
[1:28:30] word that's what's going to open up the
[1:28:31] channels
[1:28:32] and flow those out brother donny reagan
[1:28:35] just preached down to brother ron
[1:28:36] spencer's one on on on unclogging the
[1:28:38] pipes
[1:28:39] it's a good one to listen to if you're
[1:28:41] dealing with things in your life amen
[1:28:42] that you've got to let something come in
[1:28:44] and clean up the pipes many times and he
[1:28:46] talked about it he said even myself
[1:28:48] he says we've got things that just get
[1:28:50] clogged up in time because we let them
[1:28:51] linger right because we haven't let the
[1:28:53] word flow through it it's a good message
[1:28:55] if you're looking for something to
[1:28:56] listen to in the next while amen but
[1:28:58] once you get that mind of christ once
[1:29:01] that's anchored there
[1:29:03] when you push satan out of that when the
[1:29:04] word is flowing the first thing it's
[1:29:06] going to do is it's going to confirm
[1:29:07] your position
[1:29:08] that's the first thing the mind of
[1:29:10] christ will do will confirm your
[1:29:11] position we get that from the word in
[1:29:12] john 5. it says then answered jesus and
[1:29:15] said unto them
[1:29:16] verily verily i say unto you the son can
[1:29:18] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[1:29:21] the father do for whatsoever things he
[1:29:23] doeth these also do with the sun
[1:29:26] likewise we're looking into the mind of
[1:29:28] christ here and he says i don't do or
[1:29:30] see or i don't wh what i do
[1:29:33] or or or or say
[1:29:35] i do because i see it because i'm told
[1:29:37] to do it he says i don't do this of
[1:29:39] myself i don't come up with this with my
[1:29:41] own ideas jesus didn't say i take the
[1:29:43] word and i apply it the way i want it to
[1:29:45] he said no whatever god shows me to do
[1:29:47] that's what i do
[1:29:48] he was under an influence
[1:29:50] amen and he wouldn't do it unless that
[1:29:52] influence told him what to do
[1:29:54] but watch what happens when he says this
[1:29:56] we're talking about the mind of christ
[1:29:57] will confirm your position
[1:29:59] it says therefore the jews sought the
[1:30:01] more to kill him because he had not only
[1:30:04] broken the sabbath but said also that
[1:30:07] god was his father making himself keep
[1:30:10] self-equal with god i hadn't seen this
[1:30:12] until i i was putting this together in
[1:30:14] study because jesus said god is my
[1:30:17] father and they kill it they tried to
[1:30:19] kill him because he said god is my
[1:30:20] father
[1:30:21] why scripture says because they said
[1:30:23] they made himself equal with god
[1:30:27] how does that make him equal with god
[1:30:30] god is my father do you believe god is
[1:30:32] your father
[1:30:33] you're under the same condemnation then
[1:30:34] from the world then
[1:30:36] from the religious world because what
[1:30:38] happens is
[1:30:39] when you say god is your father what
[1:30:41] does that make you
[1:30:44] makes you a son of
[1:30:46] and what is a son of god
[1:30:49] it's a god
[1:30:50] they said when you say your father is a
[1:30:52] god
[1:30:54] that makes you a god
[1:30:56] and they said you're not allowed to do
[1:30:57] that
[1:30:59] but guess what
[1:31:00] god's birth gods
[1:31:04] god's father gods
[1:31:06] they don't father demigods they don't uh
[1:31:09] many god no no they father gods the seed
[1:31:12] of god is a god
[1:31:14] amen that's what we're talking about
[1:31:15] here of in his form and with his mind is
[1:31:17] the very god inside of christ living out
[1:31:20] of you you are no less of a god if you
[1:31:22] want to put it that way by your
[1:31:25] bloodline than jesus christ was we're
[1:31:28] talking about the inner man now not this
[1:31:30] body and we don't get to display it the
[1:31:32] way jesus did because we're not in
[1:31:33] sinless flesh but by by birthright by
[1:31:36] bloodline we are no different than jesus
[1:31:38] christ himself
[1:31:40] that'll choke a denominational believer
[1:31:43] when you say i am no different than
[1:31:44] christ
[1:31:47] the priest said
[1:31:48] what scripture says that jesus thought
[1:31:50] it not robbery to be equal with god
[1:31:53] why because he came from god and he goes
[1:31:56] to god you come from god and you go to
[1:31:58] god what you are a part of him you are a
[1:32:01] god in the way that he is god
[1:32:04] not the fullness but you are of his line
[1:32:06] in lineage you are a god that's what
[1:32:08] we're talking about we see the same the
[1:32:10] priest said that about him and they made
[1:32:11] it blasphemy instead of revelation
[1:32:15] the revelation they needed they turned
[1:32:16] into blasphemy and tried to kill him for
[1:32:18] it that's an amazing thing because this
[1:32:20] is where we need to get
[1:32:23] this is where we need to get this is the
[1:32:24] recognition we need to have is that when
[1:32:26] you are a son or a daughter of god
[1:32:28] there's a there there is a position that
[1:32:30] comes with that there is a recognition
[1:32:32] that comes with that there is a there is
[1:32:35] a placing that comes with that that is
[1:32:37] different than everybody else in the
[1:32:38] world and they can't take it away and
[1:32:41] you couldn't change it if you wanted to
[1:32:43] if god has called you because you are
[1:32:45] his child then you are going to sit in
[1:32:47] heavenly places you are sitting in
[1:32:48] heavenly places you will rule and reign
[1:32:50] with him you are heirs and joint heirs i
[1:32:53] believe we're going to read it here in a
[1:32:54] moment amen
[1:32:55] what is it
[1:32:56] jesus being in the form of god thought
[1:32:58] it not robbery to be equal with god
[1:33:01] in your mind you've got to recognize
[1:33:02] that when you take on the mind of christ
[1:33:04] the first thing it tells you you are a
[1:33:06] son and a daughter of god
[1:33:08] it confirms your position back to you
[1:33:10] amen what is it shows you who your daddy
[1:33:12] is
[1:33:14] my daddy is not lanny corlett
[1:33:17] my daddy is father god the almighty one
[1:33:20] the everlasting one jehovah god that's
[1:33:22] my father
[1:33:24] and when i recognize that fully
[1:33:27] it'll change me in a way that i haven't
[1:33:29] been changed yet
[1:33:31] we're still coming into that remember we
[1:33:32] read the scripture
[1:33:34] where it says we see through a glass
[1:33:35] darkly now
[1:33:36] we see bits and pieces we see shapes and
[1:33:39] shadows of it we we see elements of it
[1:33:41] but we don't see the full picture but
[1:33:42] there's going to come a day and we read
[1:33:44] the quote i believe in the last few
[1:33:45] services where it says when the by
[1:33:47] recognizes who she is then what the
[1:33:48] rapture will go
[1:33:50] there's a further recognition that we
[1:33:51] have to have in our life amen
[1:33:54] amen the thing it does
[1:33:56] is it takes us out of what
[1:33:58] bragging
[1:34:00] or worrying about who our natural family
[1:34:02] is too
[1:34:03] because what we're focused now on our
[1:34:04] heavenly father not on our natural
[1:34:06] father
[1:34:07] so guess what my father shame won't hold
[1:34:09] me down and my father's amazingness
[1:34:11] won't lift me up because i'm looking to
[1:34:13] my heavenly father amen that's what
[1:34:15] makes us all equal in here is that we
[1:34:17] come from the same daddy
[1:34:18] amen that's why brother brown said
[1:34:20] something along the lines of and this is
[1:34:23] i'm not don't have a direct quote but he
[1:34:24] says the people
[1:34:26] and this may not even be a quote it may
[1:34:27] have been something he said i didn't
[1:34:28] look it up i couldn't find it but it's
[1:34:30] something along the lines of that peep
[1:34:31] the people that say that i am god are
[1:34:34] closer to the truth than those that say
[1:34:36] i'm not
[1:34:37] remember we read that quote where he
[1:34:39] says what happened when he got the new
[1:34:40] birth was he said i recognized i was no
[1:34:42] longer the son of charles and ella
[1:34:44] branham
[1:34:45] right
[1:34:46] what he said i am what a son of god amen
[1:34:49] so that's it's closer to for somebody to
[1:34:52] call you the that you are a son of god
[1:34:54] than to say that you're a god than to
[1:34:56] say that you are not because you're in
[1:34:57] his likeness and in his image and with
[1:34:59] his life
[1:35:00] that makes you as close to a god as you
[1:35:01] could ever imagine isn't it without
[1:35:03] actually being his person amen the very
[1:35:06] original you know the the origin of god
[1:35:08] if we could put it that way amen
[1:35:11] what was he saying he say i come from
[1:35:12] god and god produces other gods so don't
[1:35:14] go so far to the left that you miss the
[1:35:16] revelation that's right in the middle of
[1:35:17] the road amen
[1:35:19] that you are a son or a daughter of god
[1:35:21] and that puts you in a very elite
[1:35:22] position
[1:35:24] not to lift you up but to restore you
[1:35:26] back
[1:35:28] romans 8 says but if the spirit of him
[1:35:30] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[1:35:32] in you
[1:35:33] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:35:35] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:35:38] his spirit that dwelleth in you now we
[1:35:39] like to put that to the future don't we
[1:35:42] that's going to be the resurrection and
[1:35:43] the rapture
[1:35:45] but remember you had he quickened
[1:35:48] right now
[1:35:49] who are dead in trespasses and sins
[1:35:51] you're already quick and you're already
[1:35:52] made alive your natural body is being
[1:35:55] what brought into subjection and being
[1:35:57] glorified even as we sit here tonight it
[1:35:59] is bringing us to a place where the full
[1:36:01] expression of god in your life can come
[1:36:03] forth out of what this fallen body even
[1:36:07] that it can bring it to a place where it
[1:36:08] is so under subjection where it is so
[1:36:10] beaten down where it is so powerless
[1:36:12] that god can do exactly what he wants to
[1:36:14] do in each and every one of our lives as
[1:36:16] men what is it it says it will quicken
[1:36:18] it it will make it live
[1:36:21] now
[1:36:22] don't put it in the future it needs to
[1:36:24] happen now we want to be quick and today
[1:36:26] you have been quickened today you're
[1:36:28] sitting here because you've been
[1:36:29] quickened but i want to be more quick
[1:36:30] and amen that they might live and have
[1:36:32] it what more abundantly
[1:36:34] that's what i'm seeking he says
[1:36:36] therefore dead brethren we are debtors
[1:36:39] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:36:41] in other words he says we owe the flesh
[1:36:42] nothing it's done nothing for us
[1:36:45] so let's not cater to it
[1:36:47] let's not think we've got to do certain
[1:36:48] things because it's our body no we don't
[1:36:52] we don't live the lives we live by the
[1:36:54] strength of our body
[1:36:56] right
[1:36:58] it's not the fact that i go to the gym
[1:36:59] that makes me strong
[1:37:01] amen it's the blessing of god in my life
[1:37:02] that makes me strong that keeps me alive
[1:37:04] that keeps me healthy he says for if you
[1:37:06] live after the flesh
[1:37:08] you shall die
[1:37:10] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[1:37:12] the deeds of the body you shall live
[1:37:15] remember the scripture says there's a
[1:37:16] way that seemeth right to a man and the
[1:37:18] way thereof is
[1:37:19] death
[1:37:20] right he says if you're going to live
[1:37:22] after the flesh if you're going to live
[1:37:23] after the way your natural natural mind
[1:37:25] thinks if you're going to go the way
[1:37:26] your natural spirit realm goes you're
[1:37:28] going to die because it will not lead
[1:37:30] you to god it will not lead you to
[1:37:31] eternity it will not change you you're
[1:37:34] in a fallen condition and guess what you
[1:37:36] can't make yourself better
[1:37:38] right that's why you've got to die he
[1:37:40] says but if we mortify the deeds of the
[1:37:42] flesh we live if we will kill what this
[1:37:44] earth with this body is trying to do if
[1:37:46] we will kill what this spirit's trying
[1:37:47] to do he says that's when we're going to
[1:37:48] live amen listen paul was a spiritually
[1:37:52] minded priest
[1:37:54] doing what he thought was the absolute
[1:37:55] will of god and he was under an
[1:37:57] antichrist spirit persecuting the true
[1:37:59] church
[1:38:02] that can happen to a message believer
[1:38:04] is what i'm saying
[1:38:06] you can sit under the right word the
[1:38:08] right message of the hour the right
[1:38:10] teaching and it can take you completely
[1:38:12] wrong if you haven't what mortified the
[1:38:14] deeds of the flesh if the new birth has
[1:38:16] not taken effect in your life amen
[1:38:20] verse 14 says for as many as are led by
[1:38:22] the spirit of god they are the sons of
[1:38:24] god that's the defining attribute of a
[1:38:27] son or daughter of god is that they are
[1:38:28] led by the spirit of god that's why we
[1:38:30] go back to that scripture lord lord did
[1:38:32] not we do this and that in your name he
[1:38:33] says get away from me i never knew you
[1:38:34] you workers of iniquity i told you what
[1:38:36] to do and you didn't do it you denied
[1:38:38] the leadership of the holy spirit and so
[1:38:40] you went your own way and nothing you
[1:38:42] did was for the kingdom of god not
[1:38:44] saying god couldn't get some glory out
[1:38:45] of it but it was not in his will or
[1:38:47] purpose and therefore it did nothing to
[1:38:49] support what his perfect will and his
[1:38:50] perfect plan
[1:38:53] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:38:54] god they are the sons of god
[1:38:57] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:38:59] bondage again to fear
[1:39:02] again to fear you were under a spirit of
[1:39:05] bondage
[1:39:06] right we didn't realize it but we are
[1:39:07] under a spirit of bondage and when you
[1:39:09] get the new birth you start to realize
[1:39:11] wow i was really tied down and even
[1:39:13] after the new birth you realize there's
[1:39:14] change that need to be broken
[1:39:16] right there's habits there's friendships
[1:39:18] there's influences there's things you do
[1:39:20] places you go people you spend time with
[1:39:22] that need to be pulled away from your
[1:39:23] life but he says we do have not received
[1:39:25] the spirit of bondage again
[1:39:27] this does not tie us down paul called
[1:39:30] himself he says i'm a prisoner of christ
[1:39:31] didn't he
[1:39:33] so there's a bondage there if you want
[1:39:34] to talk about it but it is not a bondage
[1:39:36] to fear
[1:39:37] which is what we were under last time
[1:39:38] amen it says but ye have received the
[1:39:41] spirit of adoption
[1:39:44] adoption the placing of a son
[1:39:48] right
[1:39:48] a place of trust a place of recognition
[1:39:51] a place of purpose a place with power
[1:39:53] and authority he says you've received a
[1:39:55] spirit of that whereby we cry abba
[1:39:58] father
[1:40:00] what's that word abomine
[1:40:03] daddy it's the colloquial version of
[1:40:06] father it's the familiar it's daddy dada
[1:40:09] papa
[1:40:11] papa god
[1:40:12] daddy father
[1:40:13] what happens when a child is scared
[1:40:15] where do they go
[1:40:16] daddy they don't go to father
[1:40:20] they go to daddy don't they they go to
[1:40:21] mama
[1:40:22] right it's familial it's close it's a
[1:40:25] there's a relationship that's tither and
[1:40:26] he says that's what you have even in
[1:40:28] adoption he's still papa god to you he's
[1:40:31] still someone you can come to that can
[1:40:33] be comforted by him that can be
[1:40:34] strengthened by him that can get their
[1:40:35] needs met by him amen he says and if
[1:40:38] children
[1:40:39] so many says we've received us that the
[1:40:42] spirit bears witness with our spirit
[1:40:44] that we are the children of god and if
[1:40:46] children then heirs
[1:40:50] then heirs
[1:40:52] are you an heir if there's nothing to
[1:40:54] inherit
[1:40:56] no there's something waiting for you if
[1:40:58] you're an heir there's something that's
[1:40:59] set aside there's a treasure built up
[1:41:01] there's money there's property there's
[1:41:03] position whatever it might be there's
[1:41:05] something waiting for you if you're an
[1:41:06] heir there's something that's given for
[1:41:08] you to inherit he says and if heirs of
[1:41:11] god
[1:41:13] then and joint heirs with christ he
[1:41:16] says so not just heirs but you are joint
[1:41:19] heirs with christ he puts you at the
[1:41:21] same level the same position as christ
[1:41:23] himself amen
[1:41:25] that's what we're talking about here
[1:41:27] your position the first thing the mind
[1:41:29] of christ will do is take you to your
[1:41:31] position and show you who and what you
[1:41:32] are
[1:41:34] maybe not in its fullness but it'll get
[1:41:35] you walking down the path to that full
[1:41:37] revelation of it
[1:41:39] he says if so be that we suffer with him
[1:41:42] that we may also be glorified together
[1:41:45] we are not going to be heirs
[1:41:47] we are heirs we are not going to be
[1:41:49] joint heirs with christ we are joint
[1:41:51] dares with christ amen we are now the
[1:41:54] children of god and all we this message
[1:41:56] is trying to do is get us to hear it
[1:41:59] believe it and act on it
[1:42:01] that's all god's trying to do get us to
[1:42:03] accept the simplicity of this message
[1:42:05] that you are children of god you are
[1:42:07] called for a purpose and it's to
[1:42:08] manifest the light and the gospel of god
[1:42:10] to a dying age before you go in a
[1:42:12] rapture that's it
[1:42:15] now there's a lot in there
[1:42:17] and there's a big process to get you
[1:42:18] through but that's what it's that's the
[1:42:20] simplicity of this message amen
[1:42:22] the first thing jesus recognized as a
[1:42:24] child was who he was
[1:42:26] before he did any miracles before he
[1:42:28] went out and amazed the world before he
[1:42:30] ever took those things on himself what
[1:42:32] had happened he was at the temple
[1:42:33] remember in his ma and mary and joseph
[1:42:36] left him there and they traveled a
[1:42:37] couple days away realized he wasn't in
[1:42:39] the caravan they came back and he was
[1:42:41] scolded by mary and she said your father
[1:42:42] and i were worried
[1:42:45] and he said don't you know that i must
[1:42:47] be about my father's business
[1:42:50] 12 years old in the temple and he knows
[1:42:52] he's the son of god
[1:42:54] first revelation jesus christ ever had
[1:42:55] was that he was the son of god that we
[1:42:57] know of
[1:42:59] and it's not a rebuke to her he's just
[1:43:01] letting her know
[1:43:02] i know who i am
[1:43:04] and there's a work for me and this is
[1:43:06] where it starts
[1:43:08] but i want you to catch this he was only
[1:43:10] 12 years old
[1:43:12] he didn't start his ministry till much
[1:43:13] later
[1:43:14] and it brings me to the principle that
[1:43:16] knowing your position
[1:43:18] does not mean you're in the right
[1:43:20] condition
[1:43:22] okay knowing you're a son of god knowing
[1:43:24] you're a daughter of god does not mean
[1:43:25] you're ready to go out there and handle
[1:43:26] the word in every way that you think you
[1:43:28] might
[1:43:29] why because you've got to be grown and
[1:43:30] matured into it
[1:43:32] i believe i'm a son of god
[1:43:34] there are things i wouldn't even dare to
[1:43:36] touch in this word yet because why it
[1:43:39] takes it takes a greater humility it
[1:43:41] creates a takes a greater subjection it
[1:43:43] takes a greater sanctification
[1:43:46] it takes a greater maturity
[1:43:48] it takes a greater setting aside
[1:43:50] and so god's got to bring those things
[1:43:52] into my life there's a process to those
[1:43:53] things amen
[1:43:55] the word of god reminds us that the air
[1:43:57] the air
[1:43:59] as long as he is a child different
[1:44:01] nothing from a servant though he be lord
[1:44:03] of all
[1:44:04] what's he saying
[1:44:05] your position is not reflective of your
[1:44:08] condition
[1:44:09] and in a way i thank god for that
[1:44:12] that he still calls me a son even though
[1:44:14] maybe i don't look like a son at all
[1:44:15] times
[1:44:16] but what until the time that he calls me
[1:44:19] son i'm under what tutors and teachers
[1:44:21] to bring me to that place and he says
[1:44:22] he's given us the holy spirit to be what
[1:44:24] a tutor and a teacher
[1:44:26] and then to bring us to the place where
[1:44:27] he can now put us into a position of
[1:44:29] authority where we can do something for
[1:44:31] the kingdom of god amen
[1:44:33] we read that quote a little while ago
[1:44:35] where brother braham said babies are not
[1:44:36] born men they're born babies and they
[1:44:38] grow to men he said it's no different
[1:44:39] for christians the new birth does not
[1:44:41] make you what a mature believer it just
[1:44:44] makes you a christian that's going to
[1:44:45] grow into a mature believer watch how
[1:44:48] jesus progressed listen you don't have
[1:44:50] to take my word for it look at what
[1:44:51] jesus actually had to go through luke 2
[1:44:53] 51 says and this is after he left um
[1:44:57] the after he left the temple he went
[1:44:59] back with him and the scripture says and
[1:45:00] he went down with them and came to
[1:45:02] nazareth and was subject unto them
[1:45:05] but his mother kept all these sayings in
[1:45:07] her heart and jesus
[1:45:09] increased in wisdom and stature and in
[1:45:13] favor with god and men
[1:45:15] listen this is god in flesh
[1:45:17] this is the godhead bodily this is the
[1:45:19] fullness and the image of god in flesh
[1:45:22] and it says that he had to be subject to
[1:45:25] someone and that in doing so he
[1:45:27] increased in wisdom
[1:45:29] in reputation
[1:45:30] and that he got favor with god and man
[1:45:34] jesus went from here
[1:45:36] to here
[1:45:37] he was not born the son of god and went
[1:45:39] to here he matured and he grew into that
[1:45:41] and it took him 30 years to get there to
[1:45:43] where god said you're now ready for my
[1:45:45] work and then what happened is what
[1:45:47] jesus comes to the river he talks to
[1:45:49] john he says i have to be baptized and
[1:45:51] the holy spirit comes down says what
[1:45:53] this is my beloved son
[1:45:55] he never said it before then
[1:45:57] but when god tells you when god
[1:45:59] announces it that's when you're ready to
[1:46:00] go
[1:46:01] and until he announces it there's no
[1:46:02] point in pretending there's no point in
[1:46:04] trying there's no no point in trying to
[1:46:06] being something you're not why because
[1:46:08] he hasn't called you and made you that
[1:46:09] yet you're still under training you're
[1:46:11] still under tutoring amen you can always
[1:46:14] testify you can always worship and
[1:46:16] praise
[1:46:17] amen but you can't do a work for god
[1:46:18] until he says you're ready to do it
[1:46:21] right
[1:46:21] but you're always called to testify your
[1:46:23] life is supposed to always testify amen
[1:46:26] but you're not going to do a specific
[1:46:27] work until god says you're ready my son
[1:46:30] you're ready my daughter you've proven
[1:46:31] yourself now i'm going to give you some
[1:46:33] responsibility and we'll see how you
[1:46:34] handle that and if you can handle that
[1:46:36] i'll give you a bit more and a bit more
[1:46:37] and a bit more and a bit more amen
[1:46:42] romans 8 5 says for they that are after
[1:46:44] the flesh do mind the things of the
[1:46:46] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[1:46:48] the things of the spirit for to be
[1:46:50] carnally minded is death
[1:46:53] but to be spiritually minded is life
[1:46:56] it's not just life
[1:46:57] life and peace
[1:46:59] because the carnal mind is an enmity
[1:47:02] against god for it is not subject to the
[1:47:04] law of god neither indeed can it be
[1:47:08] so taking on the mind of christ it takes
[1:47:10] us out of what enmity with god it takes
[1:47:13] out of being counter
[1:47:15] against
[1:47:16] in opposition to the things of god
[1:47:19] there's got to be a renewing that
[1:47:21] happens there to take us to the place
[1:47:22] where he can now flow through us
[1:47:25] as opposed to fight us like a cheese
[1:47:27] grater all the way through
[1:47:28] right where the flesh is just fighting
[1:47:30] the whole way through but when that
[1:47:31] natural mind is given aside so that the
[1:47:33] holy spirit can flow through it the mind
[1:47:35] of christ can come in now it puts us
[1:47:36] into alignment and makes us allies and
[1:47:38] co-workers instead of enemies
[1:47:41] instead of thorns and brambles something
[1:47:42] that's going to hold up
[1:47:44] walls that are built up in front of the
[1:47:45] will in the word of god amen
[1:47:47] first peter 4 says for as much then as
[1:47:50] christ has suffered for us suffered for
[1:47:51] us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise
[1:47:54] with the same mind
[1:47:56] for he that had suffered in the flesh
[1:47:59] had ceased from sin
[1:48:00] that tells you a life of ease and luxury
[1:48:02] is not for the believer doesn't it
[1:48:04] there has to be a suffering in the flesh
[1:48:07] not that we turn things down there's
[1:48:09] nothing in the scripture says you have
[1:48:10] to be poor and miserable
[1:48:12] but you're going to face challenges
[1:48:15] amen you're going to face struggles
[1:48:17] you're going to face trials it's not
[1:48:18] always going to be everything looking
[1:48:20] good and easy where you have all the
[1:48:21] money in the bank you need you have all
[1:48:22] the health that you you want where your
[1:48:24] relationships are great your marriage is
[1:48:26] fantastic your kids are perfect
[1:48:28] no no no
[1:48:30] there's going to be a suffering in the
[1:48:31] flesh because god's going to put you
[1:48:33] into a choice where you pick one of
[1:48:34] those or you pick his will
[1:48:37] and when you pick his will and his word
[1:48:39] then those are going to suffer and
[1:48:40] that's going to cause your flesh to hurt
[1:48:42] amen the way of god is never going to
[1:48:44] make your flesh feel good up front
[1:48:47] there's always going to be a struggle
[1:48:48] there
[1:48:49] it says that he no longer should live
[1:48:51] the rest of his time in the flesh to the
[1:48:52] lusts of men but to the will of god
[1:48:55] peter's showing us what a mind and
[1:48:56] subjection to god looks like and it's
[1:48:58] focused on the will of god not the
[1:49:00] feel-good desires of the flesh
[1:49:04] very simple
[1:49:05] very simple if you're doing it because
[1:49:06] you're you're going to feel good when
[1:49:08] you do it because your body wants it
[1:49:10] because your your ego wants it and these
[1:49:12] different things you're never going to
[1:49:13] be found in the will of god it's enmity
[1:49:15] against the will of god
[1:49:17] ephesians 4 says that ye put off
[1:49:19] concerning the former conversation so it
[1:49:21] says that you put off concerning your
[1:49:23] former life the way of spending your
[1:49:24] time put off that way of the old man
[1:49:27] which is corrupt
[1:49:28] according to the deceitful lust and be
[1:49:30] renewed in the spirit of your mind
[1:49:33] notice he doesn't say mind but he says
[1:49:35] the spirit of your mind because what
[1:49:37] your mind is under the control of the
[1:49:38] spirit
[1:49:39] right it's under a subjection to
[1:49:41] something and the desire is that it
[1:49:42] comes under that of the holy spirit not
[1:49:44] of a satanic influence amen
[1:49:47] but what's he saying peter's saying get
[1:49:48] back to the right spirit in your mind
[1:49:50] bring it back to the place where adam
[1:49:52] was and that's going to take you all the
[1:49:54] way through
[1:49:55] that's how you get back in your position
[1:49:56] as you follow the leadership of the one
[1:49:58] that held you in that position in the
[1:50:00] first place
[1:50:01] he says and that you put on the new man
[1:50:03] which after god is created in
[1:50:05] righteousness and true holiness so paul
[1:50:08] takes us now all the way to his logical
[1:50:10] conclusion we've read a bunch of
[1:50:11] scriptures this evening and he's what's
[1:50:13] saying don't stop with just the holy
[1:50:15] spirit but let the holy spirit have a
[1:50:17] work in your life and in your mind and
[1:50:19] then don't just stop with the renewing
[1:50:20] of your mind but take it until you can
[1:50:23] declare like paul did in this verse he
[1:50:24] said for who had known the mind of the
[1:50:26] lord that he may instruct him then he
[1:50:28] says but we have the mind of christ amen
[1:50:32] right
[1:50:33] we have it he said there's people that
[1:50:35] have heeded my words my words and
[1:50:37] peter's words they've they've taken this
[1:50:38] and they've allowed the holy spirit to
[1:50:40] work in their lives so that they could
[1:50:41] say we have the mind of christ now
[1:50:44] brother branham said in many places that
[1:50:46] prayer is the most powerful weapon god's
[1:50:48] given the believer he also said love is
[1:50:50] he also said many things were and i'm
[1:50:52] not saying that to confuse you but i'm
[1:50:54] saying that prayer is right up there
[1:50:56] when it comes to a powerful weapon
[1:50:58] but i want to talk about that a bit but
[1:51:00] when i was looking for that phrase uh
[1:51:02] you know the the greatest weapon this
[1:51:04] quote jumped out at me and it's it's
[1:51:06] maybe not particularly in the vein of
[1:51:07] the service but i wanted to throw it in
[1:51:08] there because it it was so good and i
[1:51:10] wanted to share with the church and send
[1:51:11] the message here you him he says the
[1:51:13] greatest weapon this is a summary in my
[1:51:16] mind the greatest weapon was ever put in
[1:51:17] the hands of man
[1:51:19] is the bible
[1:51:20] to be backed up with the holy ghost
[1:51:23] that christ died at calvary to free his
[1:51:26] church from superstitions and fear and
[1:51:29] doubt and trembling he lives today he
[1:51:33] rose from the dead and he's alive
[1:51:35] tonight he says hear ye
[1:51:37] him
[1:51:38] amen that's a powerful thing if you can
[1:51:40] recognize all of that that what the
[1:51:42] bible backed up by the holy spirit and
[1:51:45] christ died at calvary to free you free
[1:51:48] you
[1:51:49] from superstitions
[1:51:51] fear
[1:51:51] doubt and trembling and he's alive today
[1:51:55] hear ye him amen i thought that was just
[1:51:57] beautiful
[1:51:58] but paul's talking about the mind of
[1:52:00] christ and what it looks like and does
[1:52:02] it look like it says there who has known
[1:52:04] the mind of the lord that he may
[1:52:05] instruct him and he says but we have the
[1:52:07] mind of christ
[1:52:08] so what does the mind of christ look
[1:52:10] like does it look like a mind that
[1:52:12] instructs god
[1:52:14] because when we look at the mind of
[1:52:15] christ was he going around telling god
[1:52:17] what to do was he insisting on his way
[1:52:19] was he pointing a direction saying this
[1:52:21] is the way to go
[1:52:23] no the reason i talked about the
[1:52:24] greatest weapon being prayer is because
[1:52:26] prayer is a conversation
[1:52:29] it is a two-way road not a one-way road
[1:52:31] as i've said many times you talk to god
[1:52:33] but the point is he's supposed to talk
[1:52:35] back to you
[1:52:37] and paul says who has known the mind of
[1:52:38] god
[1:52:39] how do you know the mind of god
[1:52:42] when you talk to him do i know the mind
[1:52:44] of god when i'm speaking
[1:52:47] no i know the mind of god when he's
[1:52:49] speaking
[1:52:51] so the mind of christ was to go and
[1:52:53] catch the thought and the purpose of god
[1:52:55] and having caught that or seen it
[1:52:57] brother brown said he had an open vision
[1:52:58] ministry whatever it was having caught
[1:53:00] the mind of god he would place that now
[1:53:02] into his mind and he would say this is
[1:53:04] what i'm going to do
[1:53:06] that's what happens when you do when you
[1:53:08] go into prayers you're looking to catch
[1:53:09] the mind and the thought of god and so
[1:53:12] the question is are we asking god or are
[1:53:14] we telling god
[1:53:16] because prayer is supposed to allow us
[1:53:18] to catch the mind of god that's what
[1:53:19] makes it a weapon brother branham would
[1:53:21] say at times well it changed the mind of
[1:53:23] god and he talks about hezekiah when he
[1:53:25] turned his face to the wall and said i
[1:53:26] don't want to die and god said to the
[1:53:28] prophet okay tell him he'll get 15 more
[1:53:30] years do you know what hezekiah achieved
[1:53:32] in those 15 years
[1:53:34] nothing bupkis zero it did nothing for
[1:53:37] him his kingdom his family is
[1:53:39] ministering nothing he absolutely did
[1:53:42] not achieve anything else god gave it to
[1:53:44] him as a grace but it didn't do him any
[1:53:46] good why because god's perfect will was
[1:53:48] to take him right then and to move on
[1:53:50] with another king and all he did was
[1:53:51] cause problems
[1:53:54] right so prayer is not to go change the
[1:53:56] mind of god prayer is to catch the mind
[1:53:58] of god and that's what the mind of
[1:53:59] christ on us is doing is it's going and
[1:54:01] it's saying lord what do you want to do
[1:54:03] in this situation or lord what are you
[1:54:04] trying to achieve in this situation lord
[1:54:07] do i wait or do i go do i press do i
[1:54:09] stand do i move away have i ventured
[1:54:12] without authority have i presumed
[1:54:16] lord what is it that's going on here and
[1:54:17] you're going to him and then you're
[1:54:18] sitting silently and you're saying lord
[1:54:21] talk to me and you may be reading your
[1:54:23] bible and that's how he answers you may
[1:54:25] be listening under the preaching of the
[1:54:26] word tonight and he gives you an answer
[1:54:28] you may be listening to a tape or you
[1:54:30] may be meditating you know david tells
[1:54:32] us to meditate a lot
[1:54:34] you know what that word salah means
[1:54:36] think about it
[1:54:38] meditate on it
[1:54:39] when you've spoken to god meditate make
[1:54:41] yourself open to him and say lord i'm
[1:54:43] seeking your will and now i'm going to
[1:54:45] be silent for a while i've expressed the
[1:54:47] need i've expressed the concern i've
[1:54:49] expressed what has to happen here i need
[1:54:51] to make a decision whatever it might be
[1:54:53] and then you say lord will you give me
[1:54:55] your answer
[1:54:56] and then you go looking for that answer
[1:54:59] you go looking for him to speak
[1:55:02] and don't presume it's going to be
[1:55:04] brother john and don't presume it's
[1:55:06] going to be brother branham let him
[1:55:07] speak the way he's going to speak listen
[1:55:09] he might use balaam's donkey from time
[1:55:11] to time depending on how bad your
[1:55:13] situation is
[1:55:15] amen
[1:55:17] he might use your brother or sister
[1:55:18] sitting next to you
[1:55:20] husbands he might use your wife
[1:55:22] wife's he may use your husband
[1:55:25] he may use somebody you don't think very
[1:55:27] much of
[1:55:29] to teach you a lesson in humility
[1:55:31] amen
[1:55:33] listen paul was saying no one tells god
[1:55:36] what to do
[1:55:37] but those that have the mind of christ
[1:55:39] they go and they seek it out and they
[1:55:40] stay there until god lets them know what
[1:55:42] he wants to do
[1:55:43] amen it's the mind that knows what god
[1:55:46] once done not by telling but by waiting
[1:55:50] not by pressing but in resting
[1:55:52] amen to just let it sit i'm going to get
[1:55:55] to a quote in a minute to just
[1:55:57] just put this to
[1:55:58] bed jesus said in john 5 30 he said
[1:56:02] i can of mine own self do nothing
[1:56:06] what he was saying is i don't allow
[1:56:08] myself
[1:56:09] to do something in my own
[1:56:11] in my own way of doing things because
[1:56:14] what he knew it would come to nothing
[1:56:17] the only thing only things that done
[1:56:18] only what's done for christ will last
[1:56:20] amen we sing that song or that that poem
[1:56:22] and then he says i can of my own self do
[1:56:24] nothing as i hear i judge and my
[1:56:28] judgment is just why because i seek not
[1:56:31] mine own will but the will of the father
[1:56:33] which has sent me
[1:56:35] so his judgment his understanding of a
[1:56:36] situation his insight into things is not
[1:56:39] because of what seeking his will or his
[1:56:42] way but because he's seeking to what see
[1:56:44] it through the eyes and the thoughts of
[1:56:46] god
[1:56:46] that's what makes it to him go back to
[1:56:48] the lord's prayer right thy kingdom come
[1:56:50] thy will be done on earth as is in
[1:56:52] heaven give us it's what it's going to
[1:56:54] him and looking and asking for these
[1:56:55] things
[1:56:57] now this is the quote that cinches it
[1:56:58] down he says now there's a perfect way
[1:57:01] and a permissive way and i feel that if
[1:57:03] god here on the platform can show me
[1:57:05] things that has been and in my rooms and
[1:57:07] so forth he's able to tell me just where
[1:57:09] he wants me and what he wants me to do
[1:57:13] so brother bam says there's a way that
[1:57:14] god can work in me that is perfect
[1:57:17] and it's effective and it does exactly
[1:57:19] what it's supposed to do he says but i
[1:57:21] feel as long as i've got it all hooked
[1:57:23] up or i feel that he won't put his hands
[1:57:26] on it as long as i'm doing it he says
[1:57:29] and that's the way it is with anything
[1:57:31] as long as you're going to do it
[1:57:33] now watch what he jumps to the first
[1:57:35] thing he jumps to if someone talks about
[1:57:37] you and you talk back about them god
[1:57:40] can't fight your battle you're fighting
[1:57:42] it yourself amen
[1:57:44] what defending your reputation
[1:57:47] defending what people think about you
[1:57:49] putting somebody back in their place he
[1:57:51] says no no no no no no
[1:57:54] not your job
[1:57:56] he says see
[1:57:57] just let loose and let him do it and
[1:58:00] just commit it to him now listen to this
[1:58:02] the greatest weapon that i know of of a
[1:58:05] christian today
[1:58:06] is a committal to god
[1:58:09] is a committal to god greatest weapon is
[1:58:11] to do what
[1:58:12] let god fight it for you amen
[1:58:16] when you can't do nothing about it just
[1:58:19] commit it to him and god will take care
[1:58:21] of it
[1:58:22] amen committed to god so often like so
[1:58:24] many things i've said over this pulpit
[1:58:26] we do that last rather than first
[1:58:30] right when we've done all we can then we
[1:58:32] say lord i'm going to commit it to you
[1:58:35] what we need to do is commit it to him
[1:58:36] up front
[1:58:37] and say lord i'm trusting you
[1:58:40] and then do we sit idly by
[1:58:42] do we do nothing do we expect god to
[1:58:43] move the candy directly to our lips from
[1:58:45] the plate
[1:58:47] no we don't sit around
[1:58:49] right like a victorian princess
[1:58:52] and just waiting for him to spoon feed
[1:58:54] us no no no
[1:58:56] we're more rugged than that
[1:58:57] but what we do is we say lord i'm
[1:58:59] committing the results into your hand
[1:59:02] and i'll do what i can of my part but
[1:59:04] trusting that you're the one that's
[1:59:05] going to have the effect not me
[1:59:07] amen and if that means sitting still and
[1:59:09] being quiet then let it be sitting still
[1:59:10] and be quiet but it means you've got to
[1:59:12] go and have a hard conversation go and
[1:59:14] have a hard conversation if it means
[1:59:15] you've got to let your business what
[1:59:18] rest on his unchanging hands rather than
[1:59:19] your knowledge and experience that's
[1:59:21] fine let it be whatever he moves you to
[1:59:23] do let it do but don't let inactivity be
[1:59:25] your definition of spirituality either
[1:59:28] right
[1:59:29] we're supposed to be up and doing by his
[1:59:31] leadership
[1:59:32] but jot just up and doing
[1:59:35] amen
[1:59:36] rather than wasting our time and effort
[1:59:38] and then turning to god we're better off
[1:59:39] turning to god so that we don't waste
[1:59:41] our time
[1:59:42] amen
[1:59:43] and that goes for ministry that goes for
[1:59:44] families finances careers health
[1:59:46] whatever it is what do we say lord i'm
[1:59:48] committing this to you
[1:59:50] i'm doing the best that i can knowing
[1:59:52] that it's insufficient that's what
[1:59:54] committee means knowing that what i'm
[1:59:56] doing is insufficient but if you'll put
[1:59:58] your hands into it if you'll get
[1:59:59] involved lord it'll have the effect
[2:00:01] it'll do what it's supposed to do amen
[2:00:03] and all you do is you're saying lord my
[2:00:04] trust is in you
[2:00:06] that's all
[2:00:07] lord my trust is in you that's what
[2:00:09] committing it into his hands looks like
[2:00:11] brother brown says and neither will our
[2:00:13] intellectual our intellectuality ever
[2:00:15] match god how can our little infinite i
[2:00:18] think it means finite mind ever compare
[2:00:20] with the
[2:00:21] or the they he he gets confused he's
[2:00:23] confusing me how can the finite mind of
[2:00:25] us ever compare with the infinite mind
[2:00:27] of god that infinite mind of god is so
[2:00:29] far beyond hindu human intellectuals
[2:00:32] that it until it would never be the only
[2:00:34] way that bird will ever know what a man
[2:00:36] is talking about is by yielding himself
[2:00:38] and accepting it and doing whatever he
[2:00:40] thinks that the man wants him to do
[2:00:43] he's talking about a bird brain
[2:00:45] right or a worm brain as i said
[2:00:48] the only thing you can do is say this is
[2:00:50] what i think he wants me to do and then
[2:00:51] do it
[2:00:52] and if it works out well then say
[2:00:55] good i was right
[2:00:57] remember it for next time if it doesn't
[2:00:58] work out say i need to sit still and
[2:01:01] look and watch and listen maybe a little
[2:01:02] longer
[2:01:04] he says that's the only way
[2:01:06] that we know god is to follow the
[2:01:08] leading of the holy spirit he says
[2:01:10] that's old-fashioned it's god's program
[2:01:12] it's always been god's program it always
[2:01:15] will be god's program not by power not
[2:01:17] by might but by my spirit saith the lord
[2:01:20] he says that's where it comes you know
[2:01:22] brother brown was talking about that
[2:01:24] gift in his life and and if he could
[2:01:26] just let god do it
[2:01:28] then he'd be okay but the minute he
[2:01:30] tried to get involved that's where the
[2:01:32] problem rose and you'll you'll see him
[2:01:34] say many times and it's after the
[2:01:36] discernment line and he'll say now was
[2:01:38] what he said true brother branham
[2:01:40] couldn't even repeat what the holy
[2:01:42] spirit had said through him that's how
[2:01:44] surrendered he was okay i don't have
[2:01:46] that gift i don't know anybody that has
[2:01:48] that gift that they are unaware of what
[2:01:49] they said but that's how that's how
[2:01:51] relaxed he was when he let go and let
[2:01:53] god have his way in his life that god
[2:01:55] could take over and he would say things
[2:01:57] and he wouldn't even realize that his
[2:01:58] voice was being used
[2:02:00] but i can say in my own life
[2:02:02] in my own little ministry and the
[2:02:04] testimony of this comes from you not
[2:02:05] from me
[2:02:06] where after a service somebody comes up
[2:02:08] to me and they'll say you repeated a
[2:02:10] conversation that we had yesterday
[2:02:14] and you know what i didn't hear that
[2:02:15] conversation where somebody says you
[2:02:17] address something in my life
[2:02:19] that you didn't know about
[2:02:22] where you put something in its place
[2:02:25] that you had no clue was going on that
[2:02:27] you addressed the family situation that
[2:02:29] you're unaware of
[2:02:30] and guess what i have no clue of that
[2:02:32] why because god is the one that's doing
[2:02:35] that work
[2:02:36] and the grace to you is if you can
[2:02:37] believe that that's the holy spirit
[2:02:39] rather than john
[2:02:41] right
[2:02:41] but that has happened time and time
[2:02:43] again in my life and in my ministry
[2:02:45] where there are things that come out and
[2:02:47] i don't know what's going on in your
[2:02:48] life
[2:02:49] some get offended because they're
[2:02:50] convinced of that
[2:02:53] but most of you have realized i don't go
[2:02:54] around i don't know all these things
[2:02:57] then there's the other side which is
[2:02:58] you'll tell me about an issue in your
[2:02:59] life something you're praying about
[2:03:01] something you're struggling about and
[2:03:03] you know what i've learned to do with
[2:03:04] that because so it's so easy for a
[2:03:06] minister especially to go into the word
[2:03:08] and to go into the message and try and
[2:03:10] find the solution for you and you know
[2:03:12] what i've learned to do
[2:03:13] because you know what you end up doing
[2:03:14] you want to preach about it
[2:03:17] right in their home if not over the
[2:03:18] pulpit
[2:03:19] you know what i've learned to do commit
[2:03:21] it to god
[2:03:22] amen and i say lord if you want to use
[2:03:24] me use me but i'm going to pray about it
[2:03:27] and until an answer comes i'm not going
[2:03:29] to force it
[2:03:30] you see something going on in somebody's
[2:03:32] life and
[2:03:33] and you want to go there and you want to
[2:03:34] correct it and straight out no no no
[2:03:36] sit back and let god work amen let god
[2:03:39] handle it and what i've found is that
[2:03:41] god will sovereignly use something
[2:03:43] whether it's through me or through
[2:03:44] somebody else and over time he'll deal
[2:03:46] with that situation without me ever
[2:03:47] having to talk about it
[2:03:49] never having to go to that person never
[2:03:50] having to deal with that situation make
[2:03:52] them awkward make me awkward it's not
[2:03:55] fear that makes me do it it's that i
[2:03:56] don't want to get my hands in front of
[2:03:58] his
[2:03:59] that i don't want to get my feet in
[2:04:00] front of his that i want him to do his
[2:04:02] work rather than me trying to force
[2:04:04] somebody into doing something that i
[2:04:05] think they should do
[2:04:06] right god will sort out his own children
[2:04:09] it's up to me to preach the word
[2:04:12] amen god is so sovereign in those things
[2:04:14] and i've seen it time and time again if
[2:04:16] i will relax and let him do it then
[2:04:18] it'll come out and so often it addresses
[2:04:20] it before i even know about it and
[2:04:21] that's the best time
[2:04:23] i'm glad i don't know about it
[2:04:25] i'm glad i don't know about because i
[2:04:26] can speak with confidence because i know
[2:04:28] that i don't know that i'm touching
[2:04:30] somebody
[2:04:32] i'm clueless
[2:04:33] when it comes to so many of those things
[2:04:34] amen
[2:04:36] well i'm telling you is what the prophet
[2:04:37] god said if you can keep your oar out of
[2:04:39] the water and let god move the boat you
[2:04:41] go a whole lot faster and a whole lot
[2:04:43] straighter than if you try and tell him
[2:04:44] where to go and what to do don't try and
[2:04:46] get yourself involved relax and let him
[2:04:48] do it commit it to him let him run with
[2:04:50] it let him work it out amen
[2:04:53] scripture asks who has known the mind of
[2:04:54] god that he may instruct god
[2:04:57] that's knowing something with the intent
[2:04:59] of trying to tell god what to do
[2:05:01] not me
[2:05:04] but sometimes we do i've covered this
[2:05:06] before we go in and we tell god what we
[2:05:08] want the solution to be rather than
[2:05:10] letting him figure it out amen
[2:05:12] be still and know that he is god
[2:05:14] find his will and that's when you can
[2:05:16] move forward that's when you can have
[2:05:17] that confidence
[2:05:18] amen sometimes we've got to speak
[2:05:22] sometimes we've got to be quiet
[2:05:25] sometimes we've got to reach out and
[2:05:26] touch someone sometimes we've got to
[2:05:28] hold back and let them go through the
[2:05:29] pain
[2:05:32] there's a wisdom that comes from
[2:05:33] following the leadership of the holy
[2:05:34] spirit because god sees the big picture
[2:05:37] i see so little so little i'm reminded
[2:05:40] of you know there's that that old story
[2:05:42] of an elephant there and four blind men
[2:05:44] walk up to him and they touch him and
[2:05:46] one touches the leg and he says he's
[2:05:47] like a tree and one touches the the the
[2:05:50] uh the trunk and you know and he says no
[2:05:53] it's like a snake and the other one
[2:05:54] touches the tail and says no it's like a
[2:05:57] uh uh
[2:05:58] you know
[2:05:59] a willow or uh you know the
[2:06:02] you know uh
[2:06:03] fuzzy things you know
[2:06:04] something like that and then the other
[2:06:06] one touches the skin and says no it's
[2:06:08] like a piece of armor
[2:06:09] and every single one of them was right
[2:06:11] but none of them saw the big picture
[2:06:13] right and that's the way we are so many
[2:06:14] times as we look at a situation and
[2:06:16] we're convinced that we figured out
[2:06:18] what's wrong with that person what's
[2:06:19] wrong with that family what's wrong with
[2:06:22] and we can't even figure out our own
[2:06:23] lives
[2:06:24] and yet we're sitting there trying to
[2:06:25] tell this person that person we're
[2:06:26] convinced that we figured it out it's
[2:06:27] never that simple god sees and knows all
[2:06:30] those things and i've learned to be
[2:06:31] quiet and let him sort it out because he
[2:06:33] knows what's going on far above what i
[2:06:35] can do i'm i'm struggling hard enough to
[2:06:37] get his own will for my life much less
[2:06:38] figure out what's going on in yours
[2:06:40] amen
[2:06:41] i'll help where i can
[2:06:44] i'll help where i can but i don't worry
[2:06:46] about trying to straighten you out
[2:06:48] i worry about letting him straighten me
[2:06:49] out amen even as i prayed in there today
[2:06:52] you know before i came out i said lord
[2:06:53] don't let this this word go from here
[2:06:56] out
[2:06:57] let it come from here and include me in
[2:06:59] it and go all the way to the back of the
[2:07:01] building amen this is for me as much as
[2:07:03] it is for you and these things amen
[2:07:05] amen lord help me find your will so i
[2:07:08] won't get in your way as that song says
[2:07:09] let's stand together if we would
[2:07:12] and then we covered the soul
[2:07:14] we covered the spirit
[2:07:16] and so next time
[2:07:17] we're going to go into the body
[2:07:19] we're going to start talking about what
[2:07:20] that looks like and that'll kind of be
[2:07:22] the end of this series it'll probably
[2:07:23] take a couple more services lord willing
[2:07:25] but what we're looking at is a life
[2:07:27] surrendered and then sealed submitted
[2:07:30] and surrendered and that's where we're
[2:07:31] going to be going for the the next few
[2:07:33] services but just be in prayer for it
[2:07:35] amen bring in prayer for the going forth
[2:07:36] of the word
[2:07:38] amen
[2:07:39] i take these things seriously
[2:07:42] we're getting ready to go
[2:07:44] you know when there's a lot of things
[2:07:45] got to happen before we go i believe
[2:07:47] but i believe we'll stay faithful if
[2:07:49] we'll keep our lives simple
[2:07:51] and then if we'll look to him then he's
[2:07:52] going to finish the work that he started
[2:07:53] in our lives amen let's bow our heads
[2:07:56] together
[2:07:58] lord jesus
[2:08:00] lord we're in a battle
[2:08:03] lord and the prophet of god said the
[2:08:05] meanest man he knew was william branham
[2:08:08] lord the meanest man i know was jonathan
[2:08:09] kerlet
[2:08:11] lord and that's the first battle that's
[2:08:12] got to be defeated lord and that's where
[2:08:14] the new birth comes in as it takes
[2:08:15] jonathan curled out lord and it puts
[2:08:18] christ in its place
[2:08:19] and lord we're asking that that life
[2:08:21] would flow out lord that lord you see
[2:08:23] the areas where we've struggled lord
[2:08:25] you'd see the fears and the doubts that
[2:08:26] satan has placed in our lives lord you
[2:08:29] see the strongholds that are there
[2:08:31] but lord we're asking for your word to
[2:08:33] flow through us
[2:08:34] lord that your holy spirit will quicken
[2:08:36] it
[2:08:37] lord that as we sit in the presence of
[2:08:38] the son lord as we mature and ripen lord
[2:08:41] as we lay these things in these promises
[2:08:43] before you lord may you just quicken it
[2:08:45] into our lives lord not just head
[2:08:47] knowledge lord we're thankful for the
[2:08:49] things we know we're thankful for the
[2:08:51] reason that we have lord that sound mind
[2:08:53] but lord we want a daily reality of the
[2:08:55] life of christ inside each one of us
[2:08:57] lord lord not just for me lord but for
[2:09:00] everyone that's here lord lord knowing
[2:09:02] there's many out that we need to come in
[2:09:04] and lord we pray your holy spirit will
[2:09:06] go after them lord that it would lord
[2:09:08] put an unction in their heart lord to
[2:09:09] return back to the way that they've been
[2:09:11] taught lord that they would return back
[2:09:13] to that word lord that that last little
[2:09:15] cog in this great lord bride this great
[2:09:18] great bride mechanism lord that it would
[2:09:20] start to function just the way it's
[2:09:22] supposed to lord though when that last
[2:09:24] one comes in lord we know we can get
[2:09:25] ready to go
[2:09:27] lord may we not be holding up the train
[2:09:29] lord but may we be quick lord to just
[2:09:31] get in line with your word we pray
[2:09:33] lord have your way in our lives fill us
[2:09:35] a new lord we pray
[2:09:37] lord push out doubt push out fear
[2:09:39] or push out those things that are
[2:09:41] clogged up in those five inner senses we
[2:09:43] pray
[2:09:44] lord and help us to submit these things
[2:09:45] to you and let you work on them but we
[2:09:48] ask these things in jesus name
[2:09:50] amen
