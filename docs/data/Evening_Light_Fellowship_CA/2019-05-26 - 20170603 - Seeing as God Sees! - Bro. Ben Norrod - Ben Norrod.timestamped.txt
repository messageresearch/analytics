[1:10:08] Heard lots of wonderful comments from
[1:10:09] different folks and I'm so happy to
[1:10:11] hearing St John 3 ver1 I want to speak
[1:10:14] to you tonight on how do I receive the
[1:10:16] Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:20] amen how do I receive the Holy Ghost now
[1:10:22] you might say I've already got it well
[1:10:24] that's great you're going to find out
[1:10:25] how you you got it
[1:10:26] then St John 3: 1 amen let's start here
[1:10:32] at Jesus's first
[1:10:34] Doctrine there was a man of the
[1:10:36] Pharisees named n named Nicodemus excuse
[1:10:39] me a ruler of the
[1:10:40] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[1:10:44] said unto him Rabbi we know that thou
[1:10:49] art a teacher come from God what a bunch
[1:10:53] of slimy hypocrites
[1:10:57] H do you hear me amen what a bunch of
[1:10:59] slimy Hypocrites amen these people knew
[1:11:03] he was a teacher come from God and yet
[1:11:05] they were hiding in the
[1:11:06] corners they wasn't publicly declaring
[1:11:09] who he was slimy
[1:11:11] Hypocrites it's okay say Amen it ain't
[1:11:14] going to hurt you yeah right that's
[1:11:16] exactly what they were to know to do
[1:11:18] something like that friends is nothing
[1:11:20] but sin in the presence of God it's all
[1:11:21] it is the eyes of God for no man can do
[1:11:25] these Miracles that thou doest except
[1:11:27] God be with him yes Jesus answered and
[1:11:30] said unto
[1:11:32] him well Nicodemus you're right now I'm
[1:11:35] glad you all finally getting it uh
[1:11:37] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:11:39] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:11:42] kingdom of God Amen what a strange
[1:11:45] answer yes of all the things he could
[1:11:47] have said to him why that because it was
[1:11:49] the most needful answer for what
[1:11:51] Nicodemus was saying in order for him to
[1:11:54] do the things he was doing it took the
[1:11:57] spirit of God to do it through Jesus
[1:11:59] because remember Jesus as a man could do
[1:12:01] nothing in himself but what the father
[1:12:03] saw him do right so it took this
[1:12:07] spiritual something now Jesus is
[1:12:09] pointing Nicodemus right to the source
[1:12:11] as it were of what really makes a
[1:12:15] Christian a Christian what makes a
[1:12:17] Believer a Believer he didn't start from
[1:12:19] the outside realm and Reformation he
[1:12:21] didn't start in the spiritual realm and
[1:12:23] deal with psychology and all that he
[1:12:25] went right to the root of the problem
[1:12:26] right to the heart amen cuz that's where
[1:12:29] the real problem was at amen right CU
[1:12:31] remember Jesus looks at many of these
[1:12:33] people and he said on the outside you've
[1:12:34] got it right on the outside I can't
[1:12:36] disagree with your life you're white on
[1:12:38] the outside but on the inside full of
[1:12:40] Dead Man's Bones so there was a deeper
[1:12:42] part of this that was being missed
[1:12:45] Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man
[1:12:48] be born when he is
[1:12:50] old can he enter the second time into
[1:12:52] his mother's womb and be born
[1:12:55] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[1:12:57] thee except a man be born of water and
[1:13:01] of the spirit he cannot enter into the
[1:13:03] kingdom of God that which is born of the
[1:13:06] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[1:13:08] the spirit is spirit amen Marvel not
[1:13:11] that I say unto thee ye must be born
[1:13:14] again amen amen I don't mind telling you
[1:13:16] friends if Nicodemus wasn't the right
[1:13:18] kind of man at the point when Jesus said
[1:13:21] that a man had to be born again and he
[1:13:23] got the idea for from Jesus this Prophet
[1:13:27] that said a man had to be born twice
[1:13:29] that's probably about the time Nicodemus
[1:13:31] sought him a website builder and put up
[1:13:33] a whole website against Jesus teaching
[1:13:35] that a man had to be born a second time
[1:13:37] there's no scripture for it there's no
[1:13:40] scripture for it you'll never find
[1:13:41] anywhere in the Bible that the words in
[1:13:43] the Old Testament born again was ever
[1:13:46] used before the only thing you'll find
[1:13:48] new spirit I'll put my spirit he talks
[1:13:50] about all of these great things but
[1:13:52] there's no word for btim one word for
[1:13:55] word that says anything about bornn
[1:13:57] again where in the world did Jesus get
[1:13:59] this from you know how strange it must
[1:14:02] have sound to them about like the
[1:14:03] message does to many people today amen
[1:14:06] amen right you hear Brother talking
[1:14:08] about a cloud an angel of the Lord do
[1:14:10] you hear I'm talking about all these
[1:14:11] great signs and wonders and Supernatural
[1:14:13] things he said let's go to the Garden of
[1:14:15] Eden he said I imagine there's Eve
[1:14:17] standing there with her blonde hair and
[1:14:18] her blue
[1:14:20] eyes you understand what happens to
[1:14:22] people if they're non-spiritual they
[1:14:24] just run off a tangent with something
[1:14:26] not realizing that many times men of God
[1:14:28] will dra will draw things from the Bible
[1:14:31] and put together a picture that's not
[1:14:32] necessarily on the lines but sometimes
[1:14:35] in between the
[1:14:36] lines well praise the Lord got yall
[1:14:40] thinking tonight that's good that's good
[1:14:43] amen let me read to you from a message
[1:14:44] called the unfail unfailing realities of
[1:14:47] the Living God this is preached June of
[1:14:51] 1960 and here we are in June of 2017 as
[1:14:55] is just as pertinent today the Holy
[1:14:57] Spirit comes today in like manner to
[1:15:00] present God to man but man wants to go
[1:15:02] to church it drowns his thinking he
[1:15:06] cannot fathom it we must learn that God
[1:15:09] is not known by intellectual conception
[1:15:12] amen amen God is known by the new birth
[1:15:15] amen by the Holy Ghost not by any other
[1:15:19] way amen amen let's pray together over
[1:15:22] the
[1:15:23] word Heavenly Father we thank thank you
[1:15:25] Father for the great precious scripture
[1:15:28] that lays before us we are so grateful
[1:15:31] for the Bible Lord and father we know
[1:15:33] your word is a lamp under our feet that
[1:15:37] as we go through a dark lady OA there's
[1:15:40] a light that shines for the people of
[1:15:42] God it illuminates our pathway that we
[1:15:44] can know what is the end result of a
[1:15:46] child of God thank you Lord as he talked
[1:15:49] about in the book of Psalm how David
[1:15:51] would say I've considered man he's like
[1:15:54] a tree like the flower of grass said
[1:15:56] Peter Lord truly this life as we live it
[1:15:58] is a vapor God what we're trying to get
[1:16:01] a hold of is eternal life not for the
[1:16:03] purpose of blessing ourself but because
[1:16:06] we want to live and learn of you for the
[1:16:07] rest of our entire creative Life As We
[1:16:11] Live it here eternally with you actually
[1:16:13] pise Lord we want to hear from your
[1:16:15] great mouth tonight Lord and from your
[1:16:17] great heart and great mind and we want
[1:16:19] to sit at your feet that you will come
[1:16:21] and break your bread of life around us
[1:16:23] Lord that we can feed on on the word of
[1:16:25] God that our souls can be fed and fat
[1:16:29] Hallelujah in the presence of almighty
[1:16:31] God we just want to thank you now for
[1:16:33] all that's been accomplished thus far
[1:16:35] and all of the worship all the songs and
[1:16:37] every effort that's went forth thank you
[1:16:39] for it Lord and as we come to this
[1:16:41] important part of the service we pray
[1:16:42] that you'll be with us Lord and speak to
[1:16:45] us now in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:16:48] amen amen God bless you you may be
[1:16:50] seated
[1:16:56] the intellectual mind has no ability to
[1:17:00] absorb spiritual things that which is
[1:17:04] spiritual is of spiritual that which is
[1:17:07] of carnal is of carnal for people to
[1:17:11] talk about the Holy Ghost and what the
[1:17:13] Holy Ghost truly is we've got to get
[1:17:16] down to what the Bible says the Holy
[1:17:18] Ghost is first of all the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:20] not a Doctrine the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:17:23] teaching the Holy Ghost GH is not a
[1:17:25] revelation so much as the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:28] a person amen and the person of the Holy
[1:17:31] Ghost Jesus himself is the one that we
[1:17:35] receive into our hearts when we receive
[1:17:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes it
[1:17:41] comes by Revelation yes it comes by
[1:17:43] illumination of the word but it's
[1:17:45] greater than just being able to see the
[1:17:47] Holy Ghost uh I see it's right it's
[1:17:50] deeper than that it's actually being
[1:17:52] able to receive the person of God Into
[1:17:56] Your Heart by baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:58] by him actually a little piece of God
[1:18:00] entering inside the human soul and
[1:18:03] making that person as a Christ in you
[1:18:07] the hope of glory type person and this
[1:18:10] great Holy Ghost is something that
[1:18:12] really has been downplayed around the
[1:18:14] ranks of the message because frankly
[1:18:16] many of the people just don't understand
[1:18:18] it and we've heard the term throw it
[1:18:20] around so much that people have
[1:18:22] attributed their own mindset to what
[1:18:24] they think it is and have created almost
[1:18:26] more confusion than what really needs to
[1:18:29] be created when it's the answer is
[1:18:31] really simple laying right in the word
[1:18:32] of God the Holy Ghost is many many
[1:18:36] things but first it is a person it is
[1:18:38] God himself remember when Paul meets
[1:18:41] Jesus on the road to Damascus he meets
[1:18:44] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost said I
[1:18:46] am Jesus so it's not a third person of
[1:18:48] the Trinity it's not a second person
[1:18:51] it's not a first person it is the person
[1:18:54] of God
[1:18:55] so God himself as he unfolds himself to
[1:18:59] us the revelation of who he is is not
[1:19:04] even so much a revelation of oh I see it
[1:19:08] this is where we have to be careful with
[1:19:09] the term Revelation because many times
[1:19:11] we think oh I I see it and that that's
[1:19:13] what makes it h it's more than that a
[1:19:15] person can see certain things and
[1:19:18] certain things even be revealed to a
[1:19:21] certain degree to them but what we are
[1:19:24] talking about is when God himself moves
[1:19:28] into the human heart and changes the
[1:19:31] person's thoughts changes their desires
[1:19:33] changes their opinions changes their
[1:19:36] attitudes and swings their body subject
[1:19:39] to the word of God because that's what
[1:19:41] the Holy Ghost is supposed to do so it's
[1:19:43] actually a piece of God that's living on
[1:19:46] the inside of you now I hope you realize
[1:19:47] when when the Holy Spirit came down on
[1:19:49] the day of Pentecost and he sat as licks
[1:19:52] of fire on each of them it was that God
[1:19:55] as we say down south bursted himself
[1:19:57] apart or he busted himself apart in many
[1:20:00] different pieces first in 120 Parts upon
[1:20:03] the disciples and then to 3,000 as they
[1:20:05] heard the word preach their hearts were
[1:20:07] pricked and he began spreading spreading
[1:20:09] spreading then the prophet of God said
[1:20:11] that when we come together like this he
[1:20:13] said then if you got to lick and you got
[1:20:15] to lick and you got to lick and you got
[1:20:16] to lick and y'all got to lick and this
[1:20:18] one's got to lick and that one's got to
[1:20:19] lick you're bringing a portion of the
[1:20:21] pillar of fire back together when you
[1:20:24] come into the house of God that's one
[1:20:25] reason coming to church is so important
[1:20:28] so that you can draw as we say from one
[1:20:30] another's licks of fire CU you'll have
[1:20:33] strengths and you'll have something in
[1:20:34] you that maybe I wouldn't have in me and
[1:20:37] I would have things that maybe you
[1:20:38] wouldn't and we can draw one from
[1:20:40] another strength to go on in the journey
[1:20:42] now as we read here what Jesus said
[1:20:45] about this born again I challenge you
[1:20:47] sometime to go back in the Old Testament
[1:20:49] and try to find a Verbatim scripture
[1:20:52] that talks about born again now I don't
[1:20:54] mean mean that you can say oh this is
[1:20:56] where he was taught no I mean the words
[1:20:59] born again you're never going to find
[1:21:01] Moses or any of them ever talking about
[1:21:04] a second birth or any of these type of
[1:21:06] things now in a shadow form they would
[1:21:09] speak about the change coming into a
[1:21:11] heart or the change coming to man or
[1:21:13] that God would take away the Stony heart
[1:21:16] give him a heart of you can find all of
[1:21:18] that but to use the term born again
[1:21:21] you'll never really find it in the Old
[1:21:23] Testament just that way
[1:21:25] so Jesus was actually if you can
[1:21:27] understand this he was revealing a
[1:21:29] mystery that laid under the seventh seal
[1:21:32] cuz remember for the seven seal can be
[1:21:34] found all the way back in the Book of
[1:21:35] Genesis and it can be revealed all the
[1:21:37] way down remember the seven seal reveals
[1:21:40] in a three-fold manner first Christ
[1:21:43] coming to redeem the bride then back
[1:21:45] with the bride and the second coming
[1:21:47] then of course the third fold in
[1:21:48] Revelation 19 he unfolds in a three-fold
[1:21:51] manner but when you begin to realize
[1:21:53] that Redemption and the and the the
[1:21:55] opening of that part of the seal
[1:21:58] actually began in the Book of Genesis
[1:22:00] when man fell from Grace then God began
[1:22:03] to slowly in a shadow form he began to
[1:22:06] reveal little Mysteries and things and
[1:22:09] lay symbols and types all through the
[1:22:11] Old Testament leading up to Redemption
[1:22:14] remember brother man said in the
[1:22:15] Masterpiece he said in the Masterpiece
[1:22:17] as he went over there and saw the statue
[1:22:19] of David he said the pedestal had four
[1:22:21] corners and the feet and the body and so
[1:22:23] forth built up till it came came to the
[1:22:25] head and he said so did God do the same
[1:22:27] in the Old Testament he said that the
[1:22:28] pedestals was Joseph and Isaac and Jacob
[1:22:31] and so forth for Perfection and Grace in
[1:22:33] that pedestal then he built the body
[1:22:36] through the prophets and then Jesus
[1:22:38] Christ himself was The Headstone of the
[1:22:41] Old Testament setting down now all of
[1:22:43] that Paul said spoke to something coming
[1:22:46] in the future but it was not a
[1:22:48] revelation and it wasn't made known
[1:22:50] until Jesus begins to break to Nicodemus
[1:22:53] here what part of that great mystery was
[1:22:56] it was the mystery of the new birth and
[1:22:59] remember the new birth was something
[1:23:01] that was hidden in a shadow all the way
[1:23:03] from the book of Genesis when you watch
[1:23:05] the lamb being slain for the pain over
[1:23:08] the sins of Adam and Eve it was speaking
[1:23:11] to a time that God hallelujah would
[1:23:13] cover over the person's sin that they
[1:23:16] could be not just covered over but be
[1:23:18] eradicated all together Amen to be
[1:23:21] divorced from sin all together and to be
[1:23:24] just IFI as though a man or woman never
[1:23:26] done it in the first place so all of
[1:23:29] that was being spoke of up to the time
[1:23:31] that the Lord Jesus begins to break this
[1:23:34] mystery it was truly a portion of the
[1:23:37] mystery of redemption that laid under
[1:23:40] this seven seal now not fully known to
[1:23:43] man because it wasn't until our age that
[1:23:45] all of this was fully made known of what
[1:23:47] it really was of what Jesus was speaking
[1:23:49] of so there'd be many of them that would
[1:23:51] probe at it down through the seven
[1:23:53] Church ages they all knew what Jesus
[1:23:55] said about receiving the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:57] being born again and having the
[1:23:59] substance of Christ inside of them but
[1:24:01] to truly understand what it meant and
[1:24:04] how that a person would receive the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost then it was something that was
[1:24:09] reserved under the very last day that
[1:24:12] then we could fully comprehend how
[1:24:15] Christ could be in the human heart and
[1:24:18] yet here you are standing on Earth with
[1:24:20] all of your problems all of your
[1:24:21] circumstances all of your issues and yet
[1:24:24] Christ I mean the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:27] himself living inside that human heart
[1:24:29] of yours it's almost more than a person
[1:24:32] can fathom and even though under the
[1:24:35] ignorance of the ages and under the
[1:24:37] permittable parts that God gave Luther
[1:24:39] would smoke a pipe we was laughing today
[1:24:41] about Germans and their beer well here
[1:24:43] here here here Luther's a he's a German
[1:24:45] Beer Drinker but yet but there with the
[1:24:48] Holy Ghost in his heart because God
[1:24:50] would wink at their ignorances of not
[1:24:52] knowing what was full truth
[1:24:54] but then coming on with with Wesley and
[1:24:57] then to Pentecost and then all the way
[1:24:59] to this age the Holy Ghost would take on
[1:25:01] many theological uh parts to it and
[1:25:04] people would look at the Holy Ghost as
[1:25:06] though maybe it was a gift or maybe a
[1:25:08] supernatural something wle would say
[1:25:11] it's a a style of living a manner of
[1:25:13] living a Methodist a method that you
[1:25:16] live that's the Holy Ghost but then Here
[1:25:18] Comes brother Brandon all the way down
[1:25:20] here in the last day and points all the
[1:25:22] way back to the beginning of when when
[1:25:24] the Holy Ghost was first coming and said
[1:25:26] it was not the way you live it's not the
[1:25:28] way you act or don't act it's not
[1:25:31] whether you got faith or don't Faith
[1:25:33] it's that if the Holy Ghost enters into
[1:25:35] a person's heart it's because God
[1:25:38] himself had predestinated before the
[1:25:41] foundation of the world that that person
[1:25:44] was a part of him before the foundation
[1:25:48] was ever laid of this Earth before the
[1:25:50] stars were ever hung they were a germ
[1:25:53] seed in the mind of God before the
[1:25:56] foundation of the
[1:25:58] world so the Holy Ghost isn't just
[1:26:00] whenever you feel a chill run down your
[1:26:02] back it's more than that it's you being
[1:26:04] a part of Christ Hallelujah you being a
[1:26:07] germ seed like my children was in me
[1:26:10] when I was 16 running up and down and
[1:26:12] and and and and all the things I did as
[1:26:14] a boy and and this and that laughing and
[1:26:16] playing and what more my children were
[1:26:19] already Amen on the inside of me they
[1:26:22] were part of my life they were a part of
[1:26:25] my character they was a part of my life
[1:26:28] stream and so is the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:31] Christ amen if she's a Christian tonight
[1:26:33] she was in God her father before the
[1:26:36] foundation of the
[1:26:40] world how did I receive the holy ghost
[1:26:42] first of all my name had to be on the
[1:26:44] Lamb's Book of Life amen because as we
[1:26:46] preached last year you remember about
[1:26:48] the book of redemption and how that in
[1:26:49] order for a person to receive the
[1:26:51] inheritance of the Holy Ghost you had to
[1:26:53] have a title deed first you had to have
[1:26:56] that title deed you had to have your
[1:26:57] name on the title deed of redemption
[1:27:00] this is one reason that when Jesus
[1:27:02] breaks this about the New Birth it is a
[1:27:04] part of the mystery of those seals
[1:27:06] that's going to be revealed as we go
[1:27:08] down through this now now watch as
[1:27:10] brother R says here
[1:27:12] again Watch he said a man he said wants
[1:27:14] to go to church he said God wants to
[1:27:17] present man to God and God wants to
[1:27:19] present man to himself but he wants to
[1:27:21] go to church he said what we must learn
[1:27:23] is that God is not known by intellectual
[1:27:27] conception God is known by the New Birth
[1:27:30] by the Holy Ghost Jesus plainly quoted
[1:27:33] no man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[1:27:36] the Holy Ghost if you've never received
[1:27:38] the Holy Ghost listen to this if you've
[1:27:40] never received the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:27:42] know that he is Christ amen cuz that's
[1:27:45] the only way that he reveals himself
[1:27:49] that's right now listen to me carefully
[1:27:51] let me let me let me let me slow down
[1:27:53] just a moment because I'm preaching
[1:27:54] awful fast and you're listening awful
[1:27:56] slow I can tell but I I want to just
[1:27:58] just back off just a moment let me get
[1:28:00] this thought across to you when somebody
[1:28:03] talks about Christ revealing thems and
[1:28:07] Christ uh himself rather and Christ
[1:28:09] revealing himself to them if that
[1:28:12] individual has not been born again and
[1:28:16] has not received the true baptism of the
[1:28:18] Holy Ghost it's not a spiritual
[1:28:20] Revelation that they're
[1:28:22] getting but it's actually an
[1:28:24] intellectual Revelation amen now you say
[1:28:27] that sounds strange but it it's what
[1:28:28] brother Brenham said right here the only
[1:28:31] way he can reveal himself is through the
[1:28:35] Holy Ghost amen so if a person doesn't
[1:28:37] receive the Holy Ghost then there's no
[1:28:39] Revelation that can accompany what they
[1:28:41] got right CU that's the only way God
[1:28:44] reveals himself amen or you say well
[1:28:46] I'll study and God will show me and
[1:28:47] he'll open up if you haven't received
[1:28:48] the Holy Ghost you got to go step one
[1:28:51] before you can go step two remember last
[1:28:53] night well this we're right on the next
[1:28:54] part of this after a man comes from
[1:28:56] Calvary and comes into this new birth
[1:28:59] part he must receive she must receive
[1:29:02] the Holy Ghost before that they can move
[1:29:05] into the deeper Revelations of God I I I
[1:29:08] think what we've got in our mind we got
[1:29:09] it all mixed up that God reveals a bunch
[1:29:11] of things then we get to Holy Ghost
[1:29:13] that's backwards that's right a man must
[1:29:15] be born again first before God can never
[1:29:19] reveal to him spiritual revelation of
[1:29:21] who he is amen he amen that's exactly
[1:29:25] right now acts 238 said repent and be
[1:29:28] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:29:30] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost can anybody find in that formula
[1:29:34] once you learn the seals once you
[1:29:35] understand the godhead once you
[1:29:37] understand then you shall receive the
[1:29:38] gift of the Holy Ghost no last I checked
[1:29:41] the formula was repent be baptized in
[1:29:45] Jesus Christ's name you shall receive
[1:29:48] amen amen it's okay to Blink at me it
[1:29:51] ain't going to hurt you that's the
[1:29:53] formula remember brother BR said the
[1:29:55] sickness in the human age was the
[1:29:57] sickness in the soul of being a sinner
[1:30:00] by birth and he said Dr Simon Peter amen
[1:30:04] he gave the prescription or the formula
[1:30:06] for how man could get sin out of his
[1:30:09] heart so first you receive the Holy
[1:30:12] Ghost amen Second Great Revelations of
[1:30:14] God
[1:30:15] come amen but you say God revealed a lot
[1:30:18] of things to me before I got the Holy
[1:30:19] Ghost it might have been intellectual
[1:30:21] Revelation but we're talking about
[1:30:23] spiritual revelation
[1:30:24] because many people can see things a lot
[1:30:27] of people can see serpent seed and they
[1:30:29] can understand the godhead and you know
[1:30:32] in one place in the church age book I
[1:30:33] believe it was brother M said that it
[1:30:35] doesn't even take a revelation for a man
[1:30:36] to see the water baptism that's just a
[1:30:38] matter of reading it you can read it
[1:30:40] right down and be baptized in the name
[1:30:42] of and unless you just don't know maybe
[1:30:44] how how that that would look or how how
[1:30:46] to understand unless your mind just
[1:30:48] don't work in a certain way it's really
[1:30:50] quite simple to see that baptism
[1:30:52] entitles is not what Jesus said
[1:30:54] amen that's
[1:30:56] right amen but God revealed this God
[1:30:59] revealed this then I got to Holy Ghost
[1:31:00] that's contrary to the program of God
[1:31:02] that's right that's right Lord y'all are
[1:31:04] quiet on me woo you are quiet you say
[1:31:07] you're listening uhhuh sure that's a
[1:31:09] nice excuse but I know what it is you're
[1:31:11] getting tense cuz I'm getting close to
[1:31:13] home amen amen uhhuh Lord makes you
[1:31:17] start thinking about how you got the
[1:31:18] Holy Ghost don't it glad you come to
[1:31:20] church tonight that's what this is all
[1:31:21] about it's okay to be a little
[1:31:23] uncomfortable I want you to be a little
[1:31:24] uncomfortable cuz that way I can stir
[1:31:26] you up and tell you what's right now
[1:31:28] watch she said if you've never received
[1:31:29] the Holy Ghost you don't know that he is
[1:31:31] Christ you want to take the Bible on it
[1:31:33] no man can call Jesus the Christ but by
[1:31:35] the Holy
[1:31:37] Ghost you can't even identify him as the
[1:31:40] Lord Jesus except by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:31:42] you say oh amen now brother Ben Peter
[1:31:45] uhhuh and what Jesus say after that came
[1:31:46] to him Peter after you're converted
[1:31:49] strengthen your
[1:31:50] brethren God revealed it to the man's
[1:31:52] mind it was an intellect actual
[1:31:54] Revelation that God made known to him
[1:31:56] and he held on to that all the way
[1:31:58] through because he was a predestinated
[1:32:00] seed predestinated seed will hold on to
[1:32:02] everything that's truth because that's
[1:32:04] what they are amen but we're talking
[1:32:06] about the difference of God making a
[1:32:08] revelation known through the
[1:32:09] intellectual mind revealing it to the
[1:32:11] intellectual mind and a man receiving
[1:32:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:15] passing from Death under
[1:32:17] life amen do you understand that's the
[1:32:20] way God brings you into this revelation
[1:32:24] amen people say well glory to God I I I
[1:32:27] I I I got a hold of the Altar and I I SC
[1:32:29] the formula is repent be baptized in
[1:32:32] Jesus Christ's name you shall receive
[1:32:34] the gift of the Holy Ghost there's no
[1:32:36] altar call in that there's no jumping or
[1:32:39] shouting in that the formula is simple
[1:32:41] repent be baptized you shall receive the
[1:32:44] gift of the Holy Ghost amen it doesn't
[1:32:46] get any simpler than that and I'm afraid
[1:32:49] what we've done around the message is
[1:32:50] we've tried to cookie cut what we
[1:32:52] believe that formula is supposed to look
[1:32:54] like that's and friends I believe with
[1:32:56] all my heart if we just leave it alone
[1:32:57] and just let it be what it's supposed to
[1:32:59] be come on don't get quiet on me just
[1:33:02] let it be what God said it's supposed to
[1:33:04] be then we don't have to try to figure
[1:33:05] out uh well so and so jumped So High
[1:33:08] when they got it and so and so cried and
[1:33:10] so and so rolled in the floor the bottom
[1:33:13] line is so and so and so and so and so
[1:33:15] and so they repented they were baptized
[1:33:18] in Jesus name they receive the Holy
[1:33:19] Ghost all that other is just additional
[1:33:22] it's like molasses on your burger
[1:33:25] or your biscuit not your burger your
[1:33:27] biscuit what you call that thing today
[1:33:29] what I eat to to yeah on your towel
[1:33:32] that's exactly what it is all the rest
[1:33:34] of it is just additional things that God
[1:33:37] places in there the formula is repent
[1:33:40] and be back I believe sincerely that one
[1:33:43] reason when people come up front asking
[1:33:45] God to move or raise their hand in the
[1:33:47] service asking God to move on their
[1:33:48] heart to give them true conversion I
[1:33:51] sincerely believe most of the time they
[1:33:52] don't even know what they're doing and
[1:33:54] remember in the Holy Ghost Series in
[1:33:56] 1959 when brother B goes to straighten
[1:33:59] out the on the Holy Ghost the one of the
[1:34:01] first things he tells us is that you
[1:34:03] cannot receive it if you don't know what
[1:34:05] it is you're going to receive and he
[1:34:07] said how are you going to know what you
[1:34:08] got and when you get it if you don't
[1:34:10] know what it's all about he said that's
[1:34:12] why I want to take these services and
[1:34:14] try to expound to you on what it really
[1:34:17] is then he tells us the Holy Ghost came
[1:34:19] to bring power and authority and joy and
[1:34:22] all of these great things but the the
[1:34:23] Holy Ghost himself is a person that
[1:34:27] enters Into the Heart of an elected man
[1:34:29] or woman and from that new birth in
[1:34:32] their heart then all of these great
[1:34:34] things begin to Blossom out amen
[1:34:37] absolutely because it's a seed that's
[1:34:39] inside your soul the moment you took the
[1:34:42] Breath of
[1:34:44] Life you want scripture for that first
[1:34:46] Peter he talks about being born again of
[1:34:49] of Incorruptible seed as you were born
[1:34:51] of a corruptible seed you're born again
[1:34:53] corrupt oh you see I get that when uh
[1:34:55] the word just falls out there while it's
[1:34:57] preaching that ain't what brother B said
[1:34:59] brother bam said in thanking man's filer
[1:35:01] he said that there was a seed already on
[1:35:03] the inside of you he said in in a future
[1:35:06] home he tells us that that little seed
[1:35:09] was trying to declare itself God rich
[1:35:11] and mercy on page six he said there was
[1:35:13] a seed of life already on the inside of
[1:35:15] you when you was crawling around on the
[1:35:16] floor as a baby in communion the very
[1:35:19] last message brother R said there was
[1:35:20] two William Brams in me he said one
[1:35:23] catered to the the world he said but
[1:35:24] there was another part that catered to
[1:35:26] God amen amen he said what was it that
[1:35:29] life that was on the inside laying
[1:35:32] dormant waiting for the light of God to
[1:35:34] cross it he said that's the reason the
[1:35:36] woman at the well when she saw Jesus and
[1:35:39] recognized right quick Thou Art the
[1:35:41] Messiah sir I perceive you're a prophet
[1:35:43] brother man said what was it that life
[1:35:45] was already laying there he said on the
[1:35:47] inside of her and she could recognize
[1:35:50] amen oh thank you Jesus she could
[1:35:54] recognize because the life was already
[1:35:58] there people are waiting on it to fall
[1:36:00] waiting on it to this waiting on it that
[1:36:02] is a simple way to look at it if the
[1:36:04] seed is there you'll repent you'll be
[1:36:07] baptized you'll receive the Holy Ghost
[1:36:09] hallelujah amen it's not much more
[1:36:11] complicated than that am people try oh
[1:36:14] believe the message and believe the
[1:36:15] prophet and believe this and believe
[1:36:17] repent be baptized you shall receive the
[1:36:20] gift of the Holy Ghost Amen brother and
[1:36:22] then after that God can reveal to you
[1:36:24] whatever he wants to reveal to you amen
[1:36:27] I wish people would get this first
[1:36:29] before they moved on to the next part
[1:36:31] exactly amen forgive me but I think
[1:36:33] that's one of the biggest problems our
[1:36:35] churches have had for the last 30 years
[1:36:37] is we've been so intellectual and deep
[1:36:39] and trying to dig into the deep things
[1:36:40] of God and people sitting around in the
[1:36:42] congregation not even born again amen if
[1:36:45] I preach to you the revelation of the
[1:36:46] hour and you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:48] according to the Bible not brother Brown
[1:36:50] the Bible you don't even understand what
[1:36:52] I'm talking about amen amen cuz until
[1:36:54] you're born again God himself can't even
[1:36:56] reveal to you what I'm
[1:36:59] saying he will not cross his formula he
[1:37:02] has to stay with what he taught and if
[1:37:04] he done it that way one time he has to
[1:37:06] do it that way forever more this is the
[1:37:08] reason I believe our churches are in
[1:37:11] desperate need of the baptism of the
[1:37:14] Holy Ghost amen amen hang on everybody
[1:37:18] preachers and all amen amen cuz there's
[1:37:22] a lot of preachers in the the platform
[1:37:24] and don't even know what the Holy Ghost
[1:37:25] looks like that's exactly right because
[1:37:28] they came in they felt the Holy Ghost
[1:37:30] move they saw signs and wonders they got
[1:37:32] a hold of some Revelations whole I must
[1:37:34] have her glory to God that must be it
[1:37:36] repent be baptized and then you shall
[1:37:39] receive the gift if they skip that
[1:37:41] formula I don't care how good they feel
[1:37:43] or how deep they think they are they're
[1:37:45] still a sinner according to brother
[1:37:46] brandom cuz you are not converted until
[1:37:50] you receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:37:54] well I had plenty of friends I think I'm
[1:37:56] making a few enemies right
[1:37:59] now hope y'all don't hate me after this
[1:38:01] one
[1:38:02] tonight you're not converted brother
[1:38:04] says until you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:38:05] the Bible said after Peter had been
[1:38:07] saved and
[1:38:09] Sanctified he was given power to cast
[1:38:12] out unclean spirits and even preach the
[1:38:14] gospel that's right that's right I'm
[1:38:16] reading what brother B said now Jesus
[1:38:18] plainly told him he was not converted
[1:38:20] till he received the Holy Ghost so
[1:38:23] that's the main thing go to Calvary die
[1:38:27] receive the Holy
[1:38:28] Ghost then move on to deep things am I
[1:38:32] must have something on my face again
[1:38:35] some of that molasses from that tout
[1:38:37] y'all are looking at me like you don't
[1:38:38] know what I'm
[1:38:40] saying you see why we get a little bit
[1:38:42] taken back by this this is the kind of
[1:38:44] preaching you just don't hear around the
[1:38:46] ranks of the message anymore people just
[1:38:48] don't want to preach this way anymore
[1:38:50] it's too simple it's too easy go well I
[1:38:52] I I hate to hurt people's feelings and
[1:38:55] make them feel like they wasn't saved so
[1:38:56] I guess you'd rather hurt their feelings
[1:38:57] when they found out they wound up in
[1:39:00] hell I'd rather you be hurt
[1:39:02] now praise the Lord I'd rather you be
[1:39:05] offended now that Oh my he told it shook
[1:39:08] me I'd rather shake you now then find
[1:39:10] out later on like that like that girl
[1:39:12] that uh I wouldn't let my cow have that
[1:39:15] girl when brother said she was dying in
[1:39:17] the hour of death and said go get that
[1:39:19] girl and then looked at the preacher and
[1:39:20] said you deceiver a man I'm on my way to
[1:39:22] Hell In A J fault so I would much rather
[1:39:25] tell you the truth now and say what's
[1:39:28] right now
[1:39:29] and you get the
[1:39:31] idea but here's the problem is many
[1:39:34] times the ranks of this
[1:39:36] message they they they have a spiritual
[1:39:40] agenda if you will and their agenda is
[1:39:45] as they say preach the
[1:39:47] Revelation but if the people don't enter
[1:39:50] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:39:52] Revelation cannot come no matter what
[1:39:54] they
[1:39:55] preach amen but you say brother Ben we
[1:39:57] preach the Revelation so the Holy Ghost
[1:39:59] can come I I'll give you a little credit
[1:40:02] there but you have to understand that
[1:40:05] when the message is preached to a person
[1:40:09] there must be first the recognition that
[1:40:12] they're a sinner amen the problem we
[1:40:15] have with with many of the uh
[1:40:17] reformations as I'll say around the
[1:40:19] message is that many of them will come
[1:40:21] in still a sinner not see the Holy Ghost
[1:40:24] they'll hear certain things preached in
[1:40:26] the congregation and they'll sympathize
[1:40:28] or they'll go along with it or it'll
[1:40:30] seem reasonable to them and they'll go
[1:40:32] but they've never really sat and
[1:40:34] recognized I am a sinner and I need a
[1:40:38] savior amen cuz listen to me close
[1:40:41] unless you come to that spot you're not
[1:40:43] ready to move on to the next
[1:40:46] thing cuz in order to receive the Holy
[1:40:49] Ghost and be saved you need to realize
[1:40:52] you're lost first amen the Lord I wonder
[1:40:55] friends how many people sitting around
[1:40:56] this message have had a silver spoon
[1:40:58] stuck in their mouth and they don't even
[1:40:59] realize they're lost
[1:41:01] yet M they've lived clean they've lived
[1:41:04] good oh you say it's impossible no it's
[1:41:06] not anybody can keep
[1:41:08] habits anybody that's afraid of Hell or
[1:41:11] anybody that doesn't want to go to a bad
[1:41:12] place or whatever they can they can
[1:41:14] train themsel to to be religious and to
[1:41:17] be righteous and and to act spiritual
[1:41:19] every Catholic priest on the street
[1:41:20] teaches you that every nun in the
[1:41:23] Convent will show you that a man or
[1:41:25] woman can train their minds to live in a
[1:41:27] religious manner but the question is
[1:41:29] brother sister have you recognize I am a
[1:41:32] sinner and I need my savior Jesus cuz if
[1:41:35] you don't recognize that you don't even
[1:41:38] have the first stage of the thing in the
[1:41:40] [Applause]
[1:41:42] beginning well I felt a religious
[1:41:44] feeling but that's not recognizing
[1:41:45] you're a sinner I felt this I felt that
[1:41:48] I I can quote the me but did you
[1:41:50] recognize you were a sinner and need a
[1:41:52] savior cuz if if you don't do that then
[1:41:54] all it is is just joining church and
[1:41:56] playing church that's
[1:41:58] right Lord y'all was shouting with me
[1:42:00] last night woo maybe I just go in the
[1:42:02] office come back out and change my text
[1:42:04] all
[1:42:06] together now see this gets a little
[1:42:08] closer to home that's where I want it
[1:42:10] amen now you'll notice brother B again
[1:42:12] said no man is truly converted until
[1:42:15] he's been changed died to himself and
[1:42:17] the Holy Spirit has control of that
[1:42:21] person so again what is the Holy Ghost
[1:42:23] given for he said now I want to show you
[1:42:26] after a while that just those who are
[1:42:29] filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that
[1:42:32] Rapture amen so a man or woman cannot
[1:42:35] even go into the Rapture until they
[1:42:38] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:41] amen but I believe the message Holy
[1:42:43] Ghost I believe the prophet but holy
[1:42:45] ghost that's what we're talking about
[1:42:47] amen the the key element of the thing is
[1:42:50] have you been born again now I'm going
[1:42:52] to show you after a while by God's grace
[1:42:54] how this comes to us through preaching
[1:42:55] but I I got to get this in first so we
[1:42:57] can see this part before we go on
[1:42:59] because what what I'm afraid that we're
[1:43:02] going to find out that as we go on in
[1:43:03] time is that people will come and with
[1:43:06] their intellectual mind they'll be able
[1:43:08] to grasp a hold of spiritual things and
[1:43:11] yet in a certain way they almost grieve
[1:43:14] their soul away from them that is
[1:43:16] telling them that they're not saved that
[1:43:18] they're not right with God and by a
[1:43:20] religious feeling or a religious belief
[1:43:23] they're grieving their soul away from
[1:43:25] them and you can sit there and preach in
[1:43:27] the congregation they need to get right
[1:43:29] with God the hour is approaching of the
[1:43:30] rapture we need to buckle down and
[1:43:32] they'll sit there and say brother Ben
[1:43:34] I'm fine there's nothing wrong with me
[1:43:36] they don't even move when you ask them
[1:43:37] to move I was in a service just the
[1:43:39] other night and I asked the people after
[1:43:41] preaching on the calvary like I did last
[1:43:43] night I asked I asked some of the people
[1:43:45] how many of you sitting in here tonight
[1:43:47] feel like you need a little bit more of
[1:43:48] this in your life and there was a
[1:43:49] certain Minister standing there been a
[1:43:51] preacher for over 40 years and he was
[1:43:53] one of the last didn't even raise his
[1:43:55] hand didn't even make a gesture and I
[1:43:56] thought oh God if that does not speak to
[1:43:59] the hour that we're living in where
[1:44:02] brother brandham said there'll be souls
[1:44:04] in prison they'll be eternally lost and
[1:44:07] no matter what you preach to them
[1:44:09] they're sitting there with a deaf ear
[1:44:11] their soul grieved away from them not an
[1:44:13] ounce of conviction and they don't even
[1:44:16] recognize that the hours passed they
[1:44:18] crossed the line between mercy and
[1:44:20] judgment there's no way to get back and
[1:44:22] there you are preaching the word to them
[1:44:24] looking him right in the face amen
[1:44:27] amen people Harden their Spirits amen
[1:44:31] because whenever they get that religious
[1:44:33] feeling they think oh I've gone far
[1:44:35] enough remember in Hebrews 6 the Bible
[1:44:38] even said that they can taste of the
[1:44:41] powers of the world to come amen and yet
[1:44:44] they can turn around and fall right away
[1:44:46] from the truth crucifying the Bible said
[1:44:49] Jesus putting him to an open shame oh my
[1:44:52] Lord remember told you last night
[1:44:53] message people will crucify the effects
[1:44:55] of the Gospel that's what we're hearing
[1:44:58] tonight now this is the reason why we
[1:45:00] have to be careful not to drown our
[1:45:03] conviction in religious feeling but this
[1:45:07] is where we need to call to genuine
[1:45:11] honesty you know what I'd love to see in
[1:45:13] this church tonight if there was even
[1:45:14] one centner right here in this place I
[1:45:16] would love to see such an atmosphere of
[1:45:18] conviction come into this building to
[1:45:20] where that the soul begin speaking to
[1:45:22] that person and they realize I'm lost
[1:45:25] I'm on my way to hell I don't care if
[1:45:27] you've been serving God a hundred years
[1:45:28] I would like to see the spirit of God
[1:45:30] come into our churches and bring
[1:45:32] oldfashioned conviction back into the
[1:45:35] hearts of man and woman where they
[1:45:36] realize I'm lost I'm lost and on my way
[1:45:39] to hell I need a savior I need Jesus to
[1:45:42] savor amen amen if we had a little bit
[1:45:45] more of that I wonder how much less
[1:45:47] people would think we're crazy when it
[1:45:49] comes to this message cuz they hear us
[1:45:51] talking about Rapture they hear talking
[1:45:53] about the greatest truth in the world
[1:45:55] but yet oldfashioned conviction is
[1:45:56] something that's never preached to
[1:45:57] people no more believe the message
[1:45:59] believe the prophet amen amen amen oh
[1:46:01] you got it brother you're on the way but
[1:46:03] if they don't realize they're a sinner
[1:46:04] they'll never receive a savior if they
[1:46:06] never receive a savior they can never
[1:46:08] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:10] have they never received the baptism of
[1:46:12] the Holy Ghost amen there is no Rapture
[1:46:14] laying out ahead of them hell lays ahead
[1:46:16] of
[1:46:18] them but to preach on
[1:46:21] hell not in the message brother Ben
[1:46:24] surely but there are going to be some
[1:46:26] people around the ranks go to hell right
[1:46:29] amen they will because their attitude is
[1:46:34] I'm religious I'm a good person there is
[1:46:36] no such
[1:46:38] thing you can live every day of your
[1:46:40] life and not make one mistake and you're
[1:46:41] still a sinner by your
[1:46:43] birth I don't care if you're as holy as
[1:46:45] Holiness is is pouring out of your ears
[1:46:48] I don't care if you're so so religious
[1:46:50] that spiritual sugar is pouring out of
[1:46:52] your mouth I I don't care how sweet you
[1:46:54] might be when it comes to religion if
[1:46:55] you're not converted amen you still
[1:46:57] don't have the goods inside of your
[1:46:59] heart that makes you a saint that's what
[1:47:01] makes you a saint is the baptism of the
[1:47:03] Holy Ghost God I wish somebody would
[1:47:05] help me preach
[1:47:06] tonight exactly right that's what turns
[1:47:09] a man into conversion that's what brings
[1:47:11] a person into the presence as our sister
[1:47:13] saying of Jesus Christ is the baptism of
[1:47:15] the Holy Ghost amen now I know what you
[1:47:19] might be thinking so let me hit it
[1:47:20] quickly brother said a man could have
[1:47:22] the Holy Ghost every hour of his life
[1:47:23] still die and go to hell events made
[1:47:25] clear by prophecy modern events made
[1:47:26] clear by prophecy brother B is referring
[1:47:28] to a person that has the Holy Ghost on
[1:47:30] the human Spirit yes flesh and spirit
[1:47:33] it's never entered into the soul what
[1:47:35] we're talking about tonight is not rain
[1:47:36] on the flesh not the reign of the Holy
[1:47:38] Ghost on the spirit washing their memory
[1:47:41] making them Sanctified cleaning them up
[1:47:43] they can preach the gospel they can be
[1:47:44] ever so holy we're talking about a
[1:47:46] conversion of the
[1:47:49] Soul oh Jesus may you help us Lord to
[1:47:52] realize what what I'm getting ready to
[1:47:53] say the problem is not a flesh problem
[1:47:56] many people around the ranks have got
[1:47:58] that one down pat they don't do this
[1:48:00] they don't do that glory to God we don't
[1:48:02] go here we don't watch that we don't
[1:48:03] listen to this they've got that down pth
[1:48:05] when it comes to their Spirit their
[1:48:07] memory can quote quotes like pouring
[1:48:09] Peas on a dry C High when it comes to
[1:48:12] imagination they can paint such a
[1:48:14] picture of Heaven make you cry crocodile
[1:48:16] tears but when it comes to the soul amen
[1:48:19] that's what makes a man what he's
[1:48:20] supposed to be when it comes to the soul
[1:48:23] of a human being because without the
[1:48:25] holy ghost in the soul there's still a
[1:48:27] sinner I don't care how religious they
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:31] are amen am I preaching that fast you
[1:48:34] listening that
[1:48:35] slow but the rest of the Dead live not
[1:48:38] for the space of a thousand years that's
[1:48:39] right just holy spirit filled people was
[1:48:43] all that went into the
[1:48:46] Rapture this is the reason the foolish
[1:48:48] virgin miss it because her lamps had
[1:48:51] gone out yes what virtue what holy ghost
[1:48:55] power they was able to bring in maybe
[1:48:57] the brother said they're highly
[1:48:59] Sanctified type people so what Holy
[1:49:01] Ghost they was able to absorb in it
[1:49:03] lasted for but a season but it never
[1:49:05] went down to the soul but for the
[1:49:08] elect not only did she have oil in her
[1:49:11] lamp but she had an inexhaustible Supply
[1:49:15] hallelujah oh I love to say what I'm
[1:49:17] getting ready to say brother Bob there's
[1:49:19] something about a genuine Christian you
[1:49:22] just can't put their lamp
[1:49:25] out because you try to drain them out
[1:49:28] and there's another Supply waiting on
[1:49:29] that one try to drain that out there's
[1:49:32] another Supply just like with the
[1:49:33] lampstands when the oil would go out of
[1:49:35] one he would fill it right back up again
[1:49:37] and keep the flame of burning can I tell
[1:49:39] you something it's never been me making
[1:49:41] the flame burn it's been my Holy Ghost
[1:49:43] oil amen every time I got low he would
[1:49:46] just fill me back up he said what Holy
[1:49:48] Ghost many refilling
[1:49:53] thank you Jesus exactly right that's the
[1:49:55] only reason I'm going to make it not
[1:49:57] because of me because of him that's the
[1:50:00] reason you're going to make it not cuz
[1:50:01] you cuz
[1:50:03] him oh but brother Ben I have long hair
[1:50:05] I have long dresses I I don't beat my
[1:50:07] wife I don't I don't slap my dog I don't
[1:50:08] kick my cat I'm a good person goodness
[1:50:11] don't make them the spirit of God makes
[1:50:13] them you know the atheist philosophy of
[1:50:16] life is to be a good person so if you
[1:50:18] just want to be a good person you're a
[1:50:20] co-equal with atheist then that's right
[1:50:22] you believe the thing they do woo come
[1:50:24] on preach brother Ben right it's deeper
[1:50:26] than that Jesus wouldn't have said these
[1:50:28] words unless there was another level
[1:50:30] that a person could go to after hearing
[1:50:33] the truth of the word there was another
[1:50:35] place amen that a man or woman could
[1:50:37] travel to to make a spiritual something
[1:50:39] in their heart that was the baptism of
[1:50:41] the Holy Ghost the new
[1:50:43] birth it's more than just hearing the
[1:50:45] word Judas heard the word amen that's
[1:50:48] right y'all ready for this brother said
[1:50:49] 1964 Judas preached the gospel and the
[1:50:52] devil preached the gospel in Judas he
[1:50:54] said when Judas was baptized the devil
[1:50:57] was
[1:50:58] baptized woo come on now walk with Jesus
[1:51:01] fish with Jesus hunted with Jesus travel
[1:51:03] with Jesus preach conventions with Jesus
[1:51:06] cast out Devils with Jesus but he
[1:51:08] himself was a
[1:51:09] devil goes to prove you can walk ever so
[1:51:12] close to this word and this truth but
[1:51:14] until a man is
[1:51:17] converted it's just religion hallelujah
[1:51:20] hallelujah it's just religion that's all
[1:51:22] it is amen amen it's just religion St
[1:51:25] John
[1:51:26] 16:12 let's let's go on a little bit
[1:51:28] I've only got three or four more hours
[1:51:30] here don't get in a
[1:51:31] hurry amen St John
[1:51:35] 16:12 now let let's see what Jesus said
[1:51:38] about this this spirit of God now I I
[1:51:40] don't want to give you the
[1:51:42] impression that truth doesn't bring you
[1:51:45] into this Holy Ghost but what I want to
[1:51:47] try to establish for you is that just
[1:51:50] hearing truth alone doesn't bring a
[1:51:53] person there because remember anybody
[1:51:55] with an eardrum can hear the words of
[1:51:58] the Gospel reverberate against their
[1:52:00] eardrum and their eardrum move and they
[1:52:02] hear what's being said but to truly hear
[1:52:04] it remember Jesus said it takes a
[1:52:07] spiritual ear to hear what the spirit is
[1:52:09] saying unto the churches the only way
[1:52:11] you can hear it and the only way you can
[1:52:13] have a spiritual ear is if the spirit of
[1:52:15] God is living inside of your heart to
[1:52:17] hear his own word now St John
[1:52:21] 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto
[1:52:24] you but you cannot bear them now why
[1:52:28] took the Holy Ghost to Bear them that's
[1:52:30] right amen there were certain things
[1:52:32] that Jesus couldn't preach to them
[1:52:34] because they wasn't
[1:52:38] converted amen hang on everybody but
[1:52:41] there's only certain things a preacher
[1:52:42] can preach to some people because some
[1:52:44] people aren't converted amen amen I've
[1:52:48] had folks tell me later well why didn't
[1:52:49] you tell me that cuz you wasn't
[1:52:50] converted yet praise the Lord
[1:52:53] well I would if I had known that I said
[1:52:54] wasn't ready for it yet
[1:52:57] amen you got to have the Holy Ghost if
[1:52:59] you're born again certain things Jesus
[1:53:01] can say if you're not certain things
[1:53:03] Jesus won't amen I've preached in
[1:53:06] churches where people didn't even
[1:53:07] understand what the Holy Ghost all about
[1:53:08] denominations organizations different
[1:53:10] things and you'd be sitting there it's
[1:53:11] an entirely different message altoe
[1:53:13] there's certain things you feel that
[1:53:14] spirit of God when you're around message
[1:53:16] people pulling in a certain direction
[1:53:17] then you go out around some people and
[1:53:19] you don't feel any pull at all you know
[1:53:21] why people sitting there converted you
[1:53:23] can't talk to them about converted
[1:53:24] things if they're
[1:53:26] unconverted sometimes you just best off
[1:53:28] Brother Martin just get through your
[1:53:29] notes and get
[1:53:31] out come on somebody cuz if they're not
[1:53:34] spiritual they're not going to
[1:53:35] understand you anyhow what good does it
[1:53:37] do to to tell them anything if they're
[1:53:38] not don't have a spiritual heart to
[1:53:39] receive it you might as well just get
[1:53:41] through it and get
[1:53:42] out amen that's right now watch now how
[1:53:46] be it when he not
[1:53:49] it he read your Bible
[1:53:53] he so the Holy Ghost is not an it it's
[1:53:56] not a Doctrine it's not a book it's a
[1:54:01] he amen right praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:54:06] friends honestly you think when we get
[1:54:07] to heaven all we're going to do is fuss
[1:54:08] about
[1:54:10] Doctrine hopefully to God we're going to
[1:54:12] fellowship with the
[1:54:13] person the person of the word that's
[1:54:15] what I want to fellowship with don't you
[1:54:18] that's what I want to be in relationship
[1:54:20] with I want to have a relationship with
[1:54:22] the person of the word because remember
[1:54:24] when there are certain things in this
[1:54:25] book right here that I don't understand
[1:54:27] the man who wrote it knows his own word
[1:54:30] and he can reveal things to me that I
[1:54:32] can't necessarily put together right
[1:54:35] here well when that one preacher told
[1:54:37] Brother Bram you don't know your Bible
[1:54:39] very well he said no but I know the
[1:54:41] author oh it may me wonder brother BR I
[1:54:43] want to turn around and tell him you
[1:54:44] don't know your author very well but you
[1:54:46] know the Bible
[1:54:48] anyhow how be when he the spirit of
[1:54:50] Truth has come he not it that's right he
[1:54:54] will what guide you into all truth amen
[1:55:00] well I just don't know if I'm going to
[1:55:01] get it if you got the Holy Ghost this is
[1:55:04] a promise in the word that says you're
[1:55:06] going to get it you may not get it today
[1:55:08] you may not get it tomorrow but he
[1:55:10] promised that you're going to get it
[1:55:11] someday it may be after your body has
[1:55:14] changed you walk into the gates of Pol
[1:55:15] and there it is you get
[1:55:18] it I'm serious I'm serious it may just
[1:55:21] be that way there may be certain things
[1:55:23] that God would hide from you until the
[1:55:25] very moment your body has changed and
[1:55:26] you take that first breath of eternal
[1:55:28] life and all of a sudden it comes clear
[1:55:30] as a bell thing you've been wondering
[1:55:31] about all your
[1:55:32] life he promised all
[1:55:36] truth somebody say all
[1:55:39] truth all truth amen not some amen well
[1:55:44] brother Ben I I'm I'm a female I'm a
[1:55:47] woman I'm a sister I just probably never
[1:55:49] understand the godhead never understand
[1:55:51] the s all
[1:55:53] truth if you need it to make the Rapture
[1:55:57] he will reveal it to
[1:56:01] you I I hope you're getting it in other
[1:56:04] words the person going in the Rapture
[1:56:07] According To Jesus if they've got this
[1:56:10] he on the inside of them then that
[1:56:12] person will not believe in
[1:56:16] trinitarianism that person cannot be
[1:56:18] buried in Triune
[1:56:20] baptism that's what Jesus said right
[1:56:22] here I'm reading you what the what the
[1:56:23] Lord Jesus said he said he when the
[1:56:26] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[1:56:28] you into all truth amen so if you've
[1:56:31] truly got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:33] you're not going to worship brother
[1:56:34] brandom you're not going to be a
[1:56:36] Catholic you're not going to be a
[1:56:37] Methodist you're not to be a
[1:56:38] presbyterian you're going to go where to
[1:56:40] where all truth is at and may I go on
[1:56:43] record right here tonight all truth is
[1:56:46] in the message of William Maryam Brandon
[1:56:48] right here tonight they want to know
[1:56:50] where the words at it's right here here
[1:56:52] under the message of the seventh angel
[1:56:54] that's where all truth has been
[1:56:56] revealed right people arguing and fuss
[1:56:58] well I was this and I was that I I don't
[1:57:00] doubt friends that God didn't as he did
[1:57:02] the children of Israel lead people out
[1:57:04] of Egypt the Holy Spirit began leading
[1:57:06] them friends the very moment they began
[1:57:08] crying out there under those task
[1:57:10] Masters that was the Holy Ghost leading
[1:57:12] those people to get out of Egypt I don't
[1:57:14] doubt when some of you was an
[1:57:15] organization and what more that the Holy
[1:57:17] Ghost didn't start working on you and
[1:57:19] start dealing with you bringing you out
[1:57:21] but you got to remember remember one
[1:57:22] thing when he the spirit of Truth has
[1:57:24] come he will guide you into all truth I
[1:57:27] don't care if you're saved or you're not
[1:57:28] saved he started guiding you from the
[1:57:30] very first
[1:57:31] days amen he started guiding you into
[1:57:34] that and his promise is I will guide you
[1:57:37] into all truth oh God I feel like
[1:57:40] shouting I wish I could get this out the
[1:57:42] way I feel it to guide in other words he
[1:57:45] says here to be a teacher to give
[1:57:48] guidance to to lead one in the way yes
[1:57:52] so once he committed to show you what's
[1:57:54] right he can never show you what's wrong
[1:57:57] he can only show you what's
[1:57:59] right people friends they're so confused
[1:58:02] well maybe I'll get confused what if I
[1:58:04] get on a website and I get confused I
[1:58:06] got news for you if you are a child of
[1:58:09] the Living God and you get on a website
[1:58:11] and you get confused it is not your
[1:58:14] responsibility it is not my
[1:58:16] responsibility it is not anybody's
[1:58:18] responsibility to drag you out of that
[1:58:21] thing according to the Lord Jesus here
[1:58:23] it is his responsibility to drag you out
[1:58:27] of there and bring you back to the truth
[1:58:29] of the word of God no preacher no Bishop
[1:58:32] no Mama no Daddy can do it he promised I
[1:58:35] I will lead and guide you into all
[1:58:38] [Applause]
[1:58:39] truth amen amen amen well maybe some
[1:58:43] preacher would leave me that's what the
[1:58:44] tape folks always are crying and
[1:58:46] snotting
[1:58:47] about oh some preacher lead me into
[1:58:50] error if you're a child of God
[1:58:52] he promised to lead you into the
[1:58:54] truth amen so some preacher leads you
[1:58:57] off the word it is God's responsibility
[1:58:59] to lead you back on it amen come on now
[1:59:02] say
[1:59:03] Amen now nobody else bears that burden
[1:59:06] or that responsibility Jesus took that
[1:59:08] upon his shoulders himself oh the elect
[1:59:11] can't be deceived I agree with you but
[1:59:13] that don't mean they won't get
[1:59:14] confused that won't mean they won't get
[1:59:16] an error from time to time or follow
[1:59:18] something that may not be 100% right but
[1:59:20] in their human ways when they get off
[1:59:22] the path a little way that's where our
[1:59:24] guide steps in and says Hey There
[1:59:27] Brother Paul you go you're veering you
[1:59:28] got to come back over this way boy oh
[1:59:30] I'm so thankful to God tonight that the
[1:59:32] guide is laying inside of my heart and
[1:59:35] leads and guides me into all truth and
[1:59:38] righteous thank God he's there brother
[1:59:40] Mark thank you Jesus God he's inside of
[1:59:43] my heart wasn't for that we'd all be
[1:59:46] lost amen amen amen but he promised to
[1:59:49] lead us he promised to guide us amen
[1:59:53] for he shall not speak of
[1:59:56] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[2:00:00] that shall he speak and show you things
[2:00:01] to
[2:00:02] come so not only will he lead you into
[2:00:05] all truth but he will show you things to
[2:00:08] come well I I don't know what my next
[2:00:11] decision is wait on the
[2:00:13] guide I don't know what I'm supposed to
[2:00:15] do next wait on the guide he promised to
[2:00:18] show you things to come I believe one
[2:00:21] reason we get messes we don't wait on
[2:00:23] the
[2:00:26] God come on now we don't wait on him
[2:00:29] long enough to find out should we buy
[2:00:31] this house or should we buy this car or
[2:00:32] should we make this dead or should we
[2:00:34] take this job if we'd wait on him he
[2:00:36] would show us here's the right decision
[2:00:39] this is the way you do it but friends we
[2:00:40] get too hasty we getting jumping ahead
[2:00:42] because we're too independent we think
[2:00:44] we can handle the business ourselves
[2:00:46] that's the reason we're no more
[2:00:47] spiritual what we are but if we ever
[2:00:49] learn to lose oursel and die on that
[2:00:52] Cross of Calvary and get over our self
[2:00:54] will and let him lead the show
[2:00:56] everything will run
[2:00:59] smooth
[2:01:01] amen Matthew chapter 15:
[2:01:04] 7 Matthew chapter
[2:01:07] 15 verse
[2:01:09] 7 Oh Glory Hallelujah praise the Lamb of
[2:01:12] God Amen are you hanging on Amen hang on
[2:01:17] for dear life cuz I probably won't go
[2:01:19] slow tonight the way I'm
[2:01:20] feeling Matthew 15:
[2:01:23] 7 I found out last night y'all still
[2:01:26] didn't have enough room for me to preach

[2:01:42] crucified him there most holy city they
[2:01:46] most holy people crucified him Prince of
[2:01:48] Life Now Jesus speaking to these same
[2:01:51] people look at this words ye Hypocrites

[2:01:56] about this Bunch going to Jesus by Night

[2:02:07] kind of a statement oh I'd hate to be a
[2:02:10] little bit too rude sometimes Jesus gets
[2:02:13] rude sometimes friends I don't mean to
[2:02:15] offend or hurt but he calls white white
[2:02:18] black black and let me tell you
[2:02:20] something the day and age we're living
[2:02:22] in you better not play around with
[2:02:23] somebody you better tell them the truth
[2:02:25] this is an age of spiritual deception
[2:02:28] everywhere you turn around everybody's
[2:02:30] got the right answer everybody's got the
[2:02:32] right way to turn everybody's got the
[2:02:34] answer to Life's
[2:02:36] problems so you better tell them what's
[2:02:38] right you better tell them what's the
[2:02:40] truth and the only way to sometimes get
[2:02:42] the message across is call it just call
[2:02:45] a spade of
[2:02:46] spade and Jesus knew if I play around
[2:02:48] with these guys they're going to quote
[2:02:50] me to death he said so I just call them
[2:02:51] what they are you a bunch of Hypocrites

[2:03:25] what's right tell what the prophet said
[2:03:27] Moses said Mo but their heart is far
[2:03:31] from him amen amen this goes to prove to
[2:03:33] you that a person could actually be
[2:03:34] sitting in the house of God and doing
[2:03:37] lip service to the word and never really
[2:03:40] be converted inside of their heart
[2:03:44] amen oh Lord look at verse n but in vain
[2:03:47] do they worship
[2:03:49] me teaching for doctor

[2:03:56] these wasn't just lay folk these were
[2:03:58] preachers too look at what Jesus said
[2:04:01] teaching for doctrines amen so these
[2:04:04] people were teaching for doctrines the
[2:04:07] Commandments of man amen that's
[2:04:11] right Amen brother Ben preach it buddy
[2:04:14] stay with it amen hallelujah amen
[2:04:17] friends 90% of the stuff people come up
[2:04:19] around the ranks of this message that's
[2:04:21] all it is doctrin of man that's right
[2:04:24] 99% it's a bunch of
[2:04:26] hogwash people want you to live a
[2:04:28] certain way and act a certain way and
[2:04:29] dress a certain way as long as it's what
[2:04:31] they think should be done amen Hey
[2:04:33] listen I don't do things your way you
[2:04:35] don't do things my way we're supposed to
[2:04:37] be doing it God's
[2:04:38] [Applause]
[2:04:40] way everybody got different cultures and
[2:04:43] customs and ways you you go to you go to
[2:04:45] Africa I've been there a few times and
[2:04:47] and and bright colors and certain little
[2:04:49] flamboyanes and things and some of us
[2:04:51] white folks would pass out to have to
[2:04:52] wear some of the colors some of them
[2:04:53] African Saints
[2:04:55] would that's true you go to India they
[2:04:58] have a certain way about them you go to
[2:05:00] New Zealand they got a certain way about
[2:05:01] them let me I could never be as quiet as
[2:05:04] some of you newes are out
[2:05:07] here it's the culture it's the custom of
[2:05:10] things but you cannot take a custom and
[2:05:13] make a Doctrine out of
[2:05:15] it that's the doctrines of man but we
[2:05:17] got to stay with the word the word is
[2:05:20] what our standard of life is
[2:05:22] man that's what we preach and teach the
[2:05:24] people we try to tell them what the word
[2:05:26] says not what I
[2:05:28] think I think something forget it my
[2:05:30] thoughts just as equal with your thought
[2:05:32] and vice versa but the word the word is
[2:05:35] what's going to get us out of
[2:05:36] here man makes the difference amen I
[2:05:40] mean i' I've been in churches around the
[2:05:41] message in
[2:05:42] Ohio years back preachers instruct the
[2:05:46] deacons have a measuring stick out make
[2:05:48] sure the sister's dresses are so far
[2:05:50] from the floor
[2:05:52] you know what that is it's a lacking of
[2:05:54] the preaching of the baptism of the Holy
[2:05:56] Ghost that's right cuz let me tell you
[2:05:58] something right now if a man or woman's
[2:06:00] got the Holy Ghost the only measuring
[2:06:02] stick they need is that Bible that's
[2:06:03] being preached on the
[2:06:05] platform
[2:06:07] amen that's the only measuring Rod they
[2:06:09] need not about your legalism let the
[2:06:12] word Oh my Jesus said when the Holy
[2:06:15] Spirit comes he will approve the world
[2:06:17] of Darkness let them get born again
[2:06:19] brother I'm talking about those African
[2:06:20] women standing he said they were naked
[2:06:23] because they were blanket natives he
[2:06:24] said but when the Holy Ghost come down
[2:06:26] they put their arms over their breast
[2:06:27] brother said who told them that they
[2:06:29] were naked amen not some preacher not
[2:06:33] some Deacon not some trustee or
[2:06:35] housewife the Holy Ghost told them they
[2:06:37] were naked we want people to live right
[2:06:40] let the Holy Ghost dict to dictate to
[2:06:42] them what's right and
[2:06:45] wrong but we're living in the days of
[2:06:47] Judges every man does what's right in
[2:06:49] his own eyes
[2:06:51] so we try to press upon others our
[2:06:53] feeling and if we're not careful what
[2:06:55] we've done is we've made a pattern of
[2:06:57] what we say the Holy Ghost is and we've
[2:06:59] created our own
[2:07:01] formula and by creating our own formula
[2:07:03] we have to leave the old formula to get
[2:07:06] them to the new one amen well friends
[2:07:08] that's what Pentecost done you got to
[2:07:10] have the Holy Ghost better speak in
[2:07:11] tongues what was that a created formula
[2:07:14] of what it took to get the Holy Ghost
[2:07:16] we've done the same thing around the
[2:07:17] ranks this message believe Joseph's a
[2:07:19] prophet believe brother B's a prophet
[2:07:21] believe believe in this thing believe in
[2:07:22] return Ministry believe in perusia we've
[2:07:24] done the it's a measuring stick it's
[2:07:26] it's a it's a created doctrine that try
[2:07:29] to bring people into what they think is
[2:07:32] God but oh listen to me the formula has
[2:07:36] never changed repent be baptized and you
[2:07:40] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:07:43] Ghost man a woman fully repents then
[2:07:46] they receive the Holy Ghost CH of the
[2:07:47] Holy Ghost to be
[2:07:49] given cuz when a man a woman repent when
[2:07:51] they genuinely repent that means go out
[2:07:54] of the sinning business just turn away
[2:07:55] from it all
[2:07:56] together every false Doctrine every
[2:07:59] habit every lie every idea they crucify
[2:08:02] thems on Calvary turn it away completely
[2:08:06] amen amen turn around and go the
[2:08:09] opposite way yeah amen right when a man
[2:08:12] a woman fully gets down and gives her
[2:08:14] heart to God I mean fully gives their
[2:08:16] heart to God you don't have to tell that
[2:08:18] person you better not do this better not
[2:08:20] do that there'll be something on the
[2:08:21] inside of him that's right I remember
[2:08:24] when I first got it brother Gerald I
[2:08:26] didn't know what was right I didn't know
[2:08:28] what was wrong I was raised up in a
[2:08:29] little church at believe return Ministry
[2:08:31] and all we were doing twiddling our
[2:08:32] thumbs waiting for Brother brand to come
[2:08:33] back brother B we didn't know anything
[2:08:35] about the message as far as what the
[2:08:37] real message was all about but after I
[2:08:39] got
[2:08:40] it I was sitting out one day and there
[2:08:43] was a fell that I've been been fussing
[2:08:45] with in school and he pushed me down I
[2:08:47] jumped up to go get him and I felt
[2:08:49] something swirl in my heart like this
[2:08:51] and said says don't you do that oh am
[2:08:54] let me tell you something I didn't read
[2:08:55] it in the book I didn't even read it in
[2:08:58] the Bible amen but I had the Holy
[2:09:01] Ghost and the Holy Ghost told me don't
[2:09:04] you RAR back don't you fight
[2:09:07] back amen people around the ranks this
[2:09:10] message want revelation but I would to
[2:09:11] God they had a little bit of what I got
[2:09:13] when I was a teenage boy back here in
[2:09:15] that camp cuz if they had a little bit
[2:09:17] of that inside of their heart they
[2:09:18] wouldn't need a message book to tell
[2:09:20] them it's right or wrong the spirit of
[2:09:21] God would Quicken their heart to what's
[2:09:25] truth amen oh you say but we need the
[2:09:28] word I'm coming to that but I want to
[2:09:29] get this part in first because there's a
[2:09:32] whole lot more that goes with this if
[2:09:33] you'll understand more than just being
[2:09:35] able to read a a certain study and
[2:09:39] adhere to that certain study and say
[2:09:41] that that that's the way it's going to
[2:09:42] be right there it's deeper than that
[2:09:44] amen it's deeper than that in vain they
[2:09:47] worship St John 14:
[2:09:50] 16 say John CH 14:
[2:09:55] 16 one preacher said to me long long ago
[2:09:58] so we need to make him stop I said okay
[2:10:00] let's preach the Holy Ghost
[2:10:04] then that's right amen cuz friends let
[2:10:07] me tell you something in my years in the
[2:10:09] platform I'm only barely half of what
[2:10:11] brother Gerald's been 51 years he told
[2:10:13] me coming in I'm just a baby in this
[2:10:15] thing but I I've been around just a
[2:10:16] little bit what a little bit I've
[2:10:18] learned is that if you drag them in
[2:10:20] somebody else will drag him out right
[2:10:22] amen you beat it in somebody else will
[2:10:24] bless them
[2:10:25] out you cannot make nobody do
[2:10:29] nothing praise the Lord church if it's
[2:10:31] not in their heart you cannot make them
[2:10:33] do it I don't care what you quote or
[2:10:36] what you say though one would be raised
[2:10:38] from the dead and one was raised from
[2:10:39] the dead the Lord Jesus raised right in
[2:10:42] front of their eyes and he told him and
[2:10:44] told him and told him and told him and
[2:10:45] they went on and done their own thing
[2:10:47] anyways why it wasn't in their heart in
[2:10:48] the
[2:10:49] beginning amen
[2:10:52] St John 14 amen St John chapter 14 look
[2:10:56] here at verse 16 and I will pray the
[2:10:59] father and he shall give you another
[2:11:01] comforter that he not
[2:11:05] it amen he may abide with you forever
[2:11:09] that's right it's a person and if it is
[2:11:12] a person it is a personality amen listen
[2:11:16] to me if I've got the person in me I
[2:11:18] should have his
[2:11:19] personality amen
[2:11:22] I should have his character I should
[2:11:23] have his life I should have his
[2:11:24] sweetness I should have his gentleness I
[2:11:27] should have his patience I should have
[2:11:28] his long suffering I should have
[2:11:30] everything he is should be what I am if
[2:11:33] I'm in him and he's in me I should take
[2:11:35] on his
[2:11:36] personality that's what the Holy Ghost
[2:11:38] is you're taking on Christ's
[2:11:40] personality what he loves you love what
[2:11:42] he hates you hate what he stands for you
[2:11:44] stand for what he rejects you
[2:11:48] reject come on now that's right watch
[2:11:51] that he may abide with you forever even
[2:11:53] the spirit of Truth whom the world
[2:11:55] cannot receive that's right amen it's
[2:11:57] impossible for him because it seeth him
[2:12:00] not amen neither knoweth him oh glory to
[2:12:03] God but ye know him amen for he dwelleth
[2:12:10] with
[2:12:12] you do you know what Jesus was calling
[2:12:15] himself the future Holy
[2:12:18] Ghost amen he's saying he is dwell with
[2:12:21] you right now but then look what he said
[2:12:23] he'll be in you
[2:12:27] later did you catch it he said I'm here
[2:12:29] with you right now but in a little while
[2:12:31] I ain't going to be standing by you I'm
[2:12:33] going to be in
[2:12:35] you oh God somebody come on that's what
[2:12:38] I'm talking about Christ in you the hope
[2:12:40] of Glory Hallelujah to the Lamb of God
[2:12:43] it's Christ in the human heart that's
[2:12:46] what makes them what they are not
[2:12:48] because of who stands by me but who's
[2:12:50] living inside of
[2:12:51] [Applause]
[2:12:57] me I imagine these people probably
[2:12:59] people probably felt quite honored to
[2:13:01] walk by Jesus and talk with Jesus and
[2:13:03] eat with Jesus and all that sure but how
[2:13:06] much greater of an honor was it for that
[2:13:08] same Jesus they walked with and talked
[2:13:10] with and hunted with to be living on the
[2:13:12] inside of
[2:13:12] [Applause]
[2:13:15] them I'm still not convinced we get it
[2:13:18] right huh you hear me I'm still not
[2:13:21] convinced we get it right cuz if we
[2:13:23] really knew who was living on the inside
[2:13:25] of us and we recognize fully who that
[2:13:27] was on the inside I guarantee many of
[2:13:29] our problems would look like a real
[2:13:32] Shadow and I believe the bride is coming
[2:13:34] to a place to where not only she
[2:13:36] recognizes who she is but recognizes who
[2:13:38] is living inside of her hallah amen and
[2:13:41] if you recognize he is inside of you and
[2:13:43] he is the omnipotent God with all power
[2:13:46] all authority everything is subject
[2:13:48] under his hand under his name no greater
[2:13:50] name could be given than the name of
[2:13:52] Jesus Christ and that same Jesus
[2:13:55] Hallelujah has living on the inside of
[2:13:57] your heart when you recognize that
[2:13:59] you'll be an invincible
[2:14:00] [Applause]
[2:14:03] Army praise the
[2:14:07] Lord I will not leave you comfortless I
[2:14:12] will come to you
[2:14:14] amen not
[2:14:16] we amen that's right brother
[2:14:20] I because there ain't three of them it
[2:14:23] ain't a trinity it ain't a
[2:14:27] twinity amen only
[2:14:30] one yet in a while and the world seeth
[2:14:33] me no more but ye see me because I live
[2:14:38] you shall live also praise the Lord
[2:14:40] [Laughter]
[2:14:42] hallelujah amen if that don't buckle it
[2:14:45] down I don't know what else to
[2:14:47] do now let's move from this part
[2:14:51] and show now how that it comes to you
[2:14:53] and I Romans chap 10: 13 now here comes
[2:14:59] the part of the service
[2:15:01] where most message people I don't expect
[2:15:04] you newlanders to do this I know you're
[2:15:06] a whole lot more spiritual than most of
[2:15:07] the people I preach to in the states no
[2:15:10] offense State
[2:15:15] side but this is where a lot of people
[2:15:18] have a tendency to draw back
[2:15:21] because what I'm getting ready to show
[2:15:22] you is how you got the Holy Ghost it may
[2:15:26] not come the way you thought it did but
[2:15:28] this is certainly the Bible Way of how
[2:15:30] you got it let's go ahead and tell you
[2:15:32] so that everybody will relax a little
[2:15:34] bit you got it through preaching amen
[2:15:40] amen oh not me glory to God I got it the
[2:15:43] cornfield one day talk but how you
[2:15:44] learned of it was because of
[2:15:47] preachers you see that Bible you got in
[2:15:49] your hand full of pre
[2:15:51] preachers Matthew Mark Luke that's right
[2:15:55] Jesus Jesus was a
[2:15:59] preacher Bible said he was said he was a
[2:16:01] preacher to the to the circumcision sure
[2:16:04] he was Jesus went into the synagogue and
[2:16:07] preached why he was a preacher so for
[2:16:10] these folks that are against preachers
[2:16:11] they're against Jesus cuz he was a
[2:16:15] preacher and hey Jesus went in and read
[2:16:17] a sko scho every now every now and he
[2:16:19] played the tape but he preach too
[2:16:24] amen somebody said they played tapes I
[2:16:26] said I ain't got nothing wrong with that
[2:16:28] as long as they realize they got to
[2:16:29] preach eventually
[2:16:31] too I'm talking to you you ain't
[2:16:32] listening to
[2:16:34] me come on now through the foolishness
[2:16:37] of preaching God chose that to confound
[2:16:40] the wisdom of the wise did you know what
[2:16:41] I'm doing right now is
[2:16:43] foolishness did you know that what I'm
[2:16:45] doing right now is
[2:16:46] foolishness people don't understand
[2:16:48] what's going on they think this is the
[2:16:50] stupidest thing in the world people from
[2:16:51] the outside look at you bunch of people
[2:16:52] sitting here nodding your head at me
[2:16:54] screaming and spitting all over the
[2:16:55] place and they what in the world a
[2:16:57] matter with them bunch of
[2:16:58] idiots that doesn't help anything oh if
[2:17:01] they only
[2:17:02] understood if they only could see what
[2:17:05] it is it ain't a bunch of Unholy idiots
[2:17:07] or a bunch of imiles like the world
[2:17:09] tries to paint us or his brother bandam
[2:17:11] called it holy rollers it ain't a bunch
[2:17:14] of that it's people setting under the
[2:17:15] opes of the word and as the word Goes
[2:17:18] Forth they are conforming into the same
[2:17:22] oh God I feel like hauling and screaming
[2:17:25] as the image is set before him and
[2:17:27] that's what a preacher tries to do is
[2:17:28] paint the picture of what you're
[2:17:30] supposed to be paint the picture of the
[2:17:32] potential paint the picture of what God
[2:17:34] said about you and as you behold that
[2:17:36] image in the word amen it lets you see
[2:17:39] what you are and as you behold it you're
[2:17:41] changed into the very same
[2:17:46] image somebody said to me and said well
[2:17:48] glory to God God's in Jeffersonville I
[2:17:50] said yep he's there and he's also in
[2:17:52] Manchester he's also in St John's he's
[2:17:54] also anywhere the bride is that's where
[2:17:56] God's at somebody said he's out in so
[2:17:58] and so and air as I said anywhere the
[2:18:00] bride's at that's where God's at cuz
[2:18:03] Paul said that's his
[2:18:05] body you are the a body of Jesus Christ
[2:18:08] and members in particular amen listen to
[2:18:11] me I've got to say this I can't hold
[2:18:12] back and say this I'll ruin my
[2:18:14] reputation if I keep
[2:18:16] quiet the bottom line is God never
[2:18:19] called tape players that's right am he
[2:18:21] called
[2:18:22] humans thank God for the prophet thank
[2:18:24] God for the voice thank God for playing
[2:18:26] tape thank God I would to God we'd spend
[2:18:29] them in our homes 24 hours a day 7 days
[2:18:31] a week that voice of God was designed to
[2:18:33] get us ready for the Rapture to get us
[2:18:35] out of here I believe what brother B
[2:18:37] said I believe that message is important
[2:18:39] to us we need to know it backwards and
[2:18:41] forwards if it's our road mapap to get
[2:18:43] out of here we need to know the Bible as
[2:18:44] well amen absorb oursel and and and and
[2:18:48] bathe oursel and baptize oursel in the
[2:18:50] word of God I believe that but that word
[2:18:53] has got to become flesh that's right
[2:18:56] it's got to become skin amen like I
[2:18:59] mentioned to you last year when the
[2:19:00] Rapture comes and the bombs are falling
[2:19:02] and resurrection's up and trumpets are
[2:19:04] sounding and Gabriel and the horn and
[2:19:05] the whole bit when all of this is going
[2:19:07] on every tape every book and every Bible

[2:19:10] ashes underneath the ground amen but the
[2:19:13] word will be living

[2:19:18] why cuz the word ain't onion skin pages
[2:19:20] and and the word ain't tapeh heads and
[2:19:22] the word ain't MP3 players and the word
[2:19:24] it is the Bride of Jesus Christ who has
[2:19:27] got the baptism of the Holy
[2:19:29] Ghost that's the Living Word today
[2:19:33] people want to know where she's at take
[2:19:34] you a good look right here
[2:19:38] to soft and flabby as it

[2:19:54] saved glory to God brother Ben that's
[2:19:58] right don't stop there keep
[2:20:02] reading how
[2:20:05] then shall they call on him in whom they
[2:20:08] have not
[2:20:09] believed and how shall they believe in
[2:20:11] him of whom they have not
[2:20:13] heard oh boy now we getting deep

[2:20:27] read read it okay okay and how shall
[2:20:32] they
[2:20:35] hear without a
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:39] preacher Jesus I say brother bram's my
[2:20:42] preacher okay let's line it up with the
[2:20:44] Bible Ephesians 4: 11 and he gave some
[2:20:50] amen Apostles prophets teachers
[2:20:53] evangelists and Pastor for what for the
[2:20:56] perfecting of the body amen that's right
[2:20:59] okay if that's the purpose of a Preacher
[2:21:01] then then it isn't just one
[2:21:04] preacher you're not perfected just by
[2:21:06] your
[2:21:07] pastor that's why men like me come by
[2:21:10] that's why men like brother Mark teach
[2:21:11] that's why men like George Smith and
[2:21:13] brother Andre and these brothers come by
[2:21:15] because it's all of these Ministries
[2:21:17] working together as a
[2:21:19] team we are a team I not here to put
[2:21:22] brother Gerald down or up or I am a team
[2:21:25] member and he may be the quarterback but
[2:21:27] I'm over here blocking with the ball
[2:21:29] amen running by I'm blocking to keep the
[2:21:31] devil away in my own way of doing it
[2:21:34] we're a team we're team members working
[2:21:37] under the same cause under the same opes
[2:21:40] we are working for the same
[2:21:45] cause
[2:21:47] amen well but brother Ben I I don't know
[2:21:51] I'm a little scared of preachers I am
[2:21:54] too I've met a lot of bad ones but I've
[2:21:58] met some good ones
[2:21:59] too and I figure if God puts it in his
[2:22:02] word he's going to have a five-fold
[2:22:03] ministry that's going to be right on the
[2:22:05] word I figure it's God's obligation to
[2:22:07] make sure we've got some good ones
[2:22:09] available yeah good as few as there may
[2:22:13] be as you know skim as it may be uh uh
[2:22:16] you know there's just a couple of us
[2:22:18] maybe eight or 10 of us around the world
[2:22:20] that actually care you
[2:22:23] know ain't that funny am you can say
[2:22:26] Amen about the preachers but I wonder if
[2:22:27] I could turn that around on
[2:22:30] congregations cuz there's a lot of
[2:22:32] people I preach to that ain't sincere
[2:22:35] either probably just a handful in the
[2:22:37] churches I preach
[2:22:39] to
[2:22:41] Jesus but this is how he said you get it
[2:22:44] through the
[2:22:46] preaching this is how you receive the
[2:22:48] Holy Ghost through the preaching oh you
[2:22:50] say but wait a minute I I don't
[2:22:52] understand it all right ohy when Simon
[2:22:54] Peter stood up and said repent be
[2:22:55] baptized what was he doing what was he
[2:22:58] doing he's
[2:23:01] preaching brother said he gave the
[2:23:03] greatest sermon that could ever be given
[2:23:04] in 15 minutes oh god brother Gerald we
[2:23:06] need to take
[2:23:12] lessons ain't that right
[2:23:14] buddy amen can we get a long wind of
[2:23:17] this I don't
[2:23:19] know but he was preaching the gospel
[2:23:23] that's the whole reason the people were
[2:23:24] pricked in their heart because the word
[2:23:27] comes through the body and the body was
[2:23:29] preaching to other members of the
[2:23:32] body amen that's right verse 15 how
[2:23:35] should they preach except they be sent
[2:23:36] as is written how beautiful are the feet
[2:23:38] of them that preach the gospel of peace
[2:23:40] bring Glad Tidings of good things but
[2:23:41] they have not all obeyed the gospel
[2:23:43] Isaiah say Lord who have believed our
[2:23:45] report so then here's our famous
[2:23:47] scripture Faith cometh by hearing and
[2:23:50] hearing by the word amen oh that's right
[2:23:53] brother Ben just push play wait wait
[2:23:56] wait wait a minute how did Paul say they
[2:23:59] heard
[2:24:01] again you just got to go back up to
[2:24:03] verse 14 and you'll find out how he said
[2:24:05] they heard Faith came by hearing how
[2:24:09] shall they hear without a
[2:24:15] preacher hold on everybody if rapturing
[2:24:19] Faith lays in the mess message of the
[2:24:21] hour and the message of the hour is what
[2:24:23] brings rapturing Faith to the bride then
[2:24:25] in other words without a gift you don't
[2:24:29] have the ability as lay people to go
[2:24:30] into that message and pull out those
[2:24:33] elements of rapturing faith and apply
[2:24:35] them to yourself so God gifted five-fold
[2:24:39] offices to in in the manifold way he
[2:24:42] gifted them to go into that message and
[2:24:44] pull out the elements for rapturing
[2:24:46] faith God I feel like like spontaneously
[2:24:49] combusting
[2:24:50] Amen to go into that word and pull out
[2:24:53] Hallelujah the elements of what it takes
[2:24:56] for rapturing Faith do you realize
[2:24:58] rapturing faith will come through the
[2:25:00] preaching of the word that you yield
[2:25:01] yourself to
[2:25:04] amen this is the whole reason why when
[2:25:07] you come to church you should open your
[2:25:09] heart wide open cuz whether you know it
[2:25:12] or not the the elements for rapturing
[2:25:14] Faith are being preached into your
[2:25:16] person amen and into your soul because a
[2:25:19] man of God has the ability to go into
[2:25:21] that message and pull out those elements
[2:25:23] and preach them to the people of God and
[2:25:25] those that have got the Holy Ghost
[2:25:26] they'll grab onto that word and they'll
[2:25:28] bring it into their heart and become one
[2:25:30] with
[2:25:32] it
[2:25:34] oh
[2:25:36] oh thank you Lord
[2:25:40] Jesus Romans chapter 6 verse5 now let's
[2:25:43] really get to preaching here for a
[2:25:45] minute Romans chapter 6 verse
[2:25:48] 5 here comes some really really good
[2:25:50] stuff I want to share with you watch
[2:25:53] what Paul says now this then this is
[2:25:55] also the way the Holy Ghost comes now
[2:25:58] notice the words that Paul uses here
[2:26:03] planted
[2:26:05] Resurrection death planted let's put it
[2:26:09] in the right order planted death
[2:26:11] Resurrection planted death Resurrection
[2:26:16] this is how the Holy Ghost comes amen
[2:26:18] for if we've been planted together in
[2:26:19] the life Ness of his
[2:26:21] death we shall also be in the likeness
[2:26:24] of his resurrection
[2:26:27] oh
[2:26:29] Hallelujah verse six knowing this that
[2:26:31] our old man is crucified with him amen
[2:26:36] well friends isn't this what I told you
[2:26:37] last night if you're not willing to hang
[2:26:39] on an Old Rugged Cross there comes no
[2:26:42] Resurrection you can't hang up this old
[2:26:44] guy in a in a closet and pull him out
[2:26:46] every
[2:26:47] Sunday or put him back in on Sunday
[2:26:49] every what the case might be no he's got
[2:26:52] to die life comes from
[2:26:59] Death that the body of sin might be
[2:27:02] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[2:27:04] serve sin for he that is dead is freed
[2:27:08] from sin glory to
[2:27:11] God Amen next time the Devil comes by
[2:27:14] and tells you you're bound just quoting
[2:27:16] that one right
[2:27:17] there that I am free and free indeed For
[2:27:20] Whom the sun sets free is free indeed
[2:27:23] you realize what it is the devil's just
[2:27:24] lying to you he's just lying to you
[2:27:27] trying to let on like you're certain and
[2:27:29] you're not bound by sin if you've
[2:27:31] received the Holy Ghost you are not
[2:27:33] bound by sin you are dead to it and free
[2:27:36] from it
[2:27:38] [Applause]
[2:27:39] forever amen you're completely dead all
[2:27:43] together watch him in verse say now if
[2:27:44] we be dead with Christ we believe that
[2:27:47] we shall also live with him amen
[2:27:51] how you supposed to live after you die
[2:27:55] comes a
[2:27:56] resurrection
[2:27:58] am and it's not you that's resurrected
[2:28:01] it's the Christ on the inside that's
[2:28:06] resurrected brother B said death to the
[2:28:08] old man life to the new amen the old man
[2:28:11] is dead he's crucified he's done away
[2:28:13] with and that little germ of life on the
[2:28:16] inside which is Christ at the
[2:28:19] beginning once it becomes gerti by the
[2:28:21] preaching of the word remember when Paul
[2:28:23] said Paul planted Apollos watered but
[2:28:25] God gave the
[2:28:28] increase so while you're sitting there
[2:28:30] hearing the word something's happening
[2:28:31] something's being planted something's
[2:28:33] dying something's being resurrected
[2:28:36] too how under the preaching of the word
[2:28:38] of God that's how these things are
[2:28:41] happening notice in the sign of the time
[2:28:45] brother man said we have so much on the
[2:28:47] mechanics and not too much on the
[2:28:51] Dynamics now my body is the mechanics
[2:28:54] but my body will not operate without the
[2:28:56] Dynamics or my spirit the spirit
[2:28:59] operates my body brings it in control he
[2:29:02] said like an automobile with no gasoline
[2:29:04] in it no firing power amen no matter how
[2:29:08] fine the mechanics is fixed up the
[2:29:10] cylinders points plugs and whatever more
[2:29:13] it's got to have a current he said
[2:29:15] that's the way God is listen to this if
[2:29:18] you it's got to get a believer with God
[2:29:20] to make the contact and then when it
[2:29:23] makes contact with God something's got
[2:29:25] to
[2:29:26] [Applause]
[2:29:28] happen amen oh praise the Lord praise
[2:29:32] the Lord hallelujah repent be baptized
[2:29:35] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:29:37] Ghost get him in contact with God and
[2:29:40] then all of this begins to come out
[2:29:42] that's the reason why when you hear the
[2:29:43] preaching of the word of God remember
[2:29:45] the prophet of God said in in MDC he
[2:29:48] tells us that when you heard
[2:29:50] heard that the Living Word of God he
[2:29:53] said what real Eagle food for you he
[2:29:56] said you left that other thing he said
[2:29:58] you've then been formed of the living
[2:29:59] image of the Living God he said you
[2:30:01] heard from your
[2:30:02] theophany amen cuz don't forget there
[2:30:05] was something that was in God before I
[2:30:07] was here this flesh is the last element
[2:30:11] of many many great things that God's
[2:30:12] already done for me and his mind before
[2:30:14] the foundation of the world I was
[2:30:16] already a germ seed in his mind I was a
[2:30:18] thought I was an attribute was a part of
[2:30:20] him he was the male I was the female I
[2:30:23] was my name was on the Lamb's Book of
[2:30:24] Life and this flesh was only manifested
[2:30:27] Hallelujah that that something in God
[2:30:29] could
[2:30:31] manifest oh y'all ain't hearing me
[2:30:33] tonight that something that God had
[2:30:36] could manifest through this frussy
[2:30:38] body that's the reason I'm not the same
[2:30:41] person I was before I got saved I think
[2:30:43] different I act different I talk
[2:30:45] different I walk different why I've been
[2:30:47] formed into the image of the Living God
[2:30:52] I become a different
[2:30:56] personality if a person gets the Holy
[2:30:58] Ghost Lord once they're born again you
[2:31:02] will see Christ in that person I don't
[2:31:05] care how hard a trial they go through or
[2:31:07] how difficult or what circum you'll see
[2:31:10] Christ in that person because if God's
[2:31:13] there the only thing he can do is
[2:31:15] Manifest his great
[2:31:17] personality you cannot hide from it you
[2:31:20] cannot run from it you can pretend like
[2:31:22] it wasn't there you can you can talk
[2:31:25] yourself into it not having much power
[2:31:27] let a little squeeze come on you'll find
[2:31:29] out who's in
[2:31:30] charge come on somebody let no trouble
[2:31:33] hit the household and a child gets sick
[2:31:35] and the doctor say the word cancer or
[2:31:37] some other disease or some other germ
[2:31:39] let something happen and that Christ on
[2:31:42] the inside goes to working out his great
[2:31:45] personality that's why many times when
[2:31:47] you was about ready to give up something
[2:31:49] on the inside of you begin to raise up
[2:31:51] and say how can you quit something you
[2:31:53] never started in the first
[2:31:56] place amen the lord giveth and the lord
[2:31:59] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[2:32:02] Lord hallelujah something on the inside
[2:32:04] of that Christ on the inside his
[2:32:06] personality raises up at the right
[2:32:10] moment amen we can try to keep him
[2:32:13] suppressed that all it takes is for the
[2:32:15] right Sun for the right moisture for the
[2:32:19] right fertile ground
[2:32:20] and that seed just starts manifesting
[2:32:22] what's on the inside of
[2:32:24] it you can try to hate somebody but if
[2:32:27] he's on the inside he pushes that hate
[2:32:29] out and Christ just loves and loves oh
[2:32:32] Hallelujah you can try to have a bad
[2:32:35] feeling you can try to make an excuse
[2:32:37] but that personality just squeezes all
[2:32:39] that stuff out of
[2:32:40] there Hallelujah you can't keep from
[2:32:43] it you you can try your best to get
[2:32:47] yourself in the middle of a complex
[2:32:51] and God will show you a dream like he
[2:32:53] did brother brandom and show you you're
[2:32:55] on a wrong road don't you understand
[2:32:58] when brother Brandon went through that
[2:32:59] complex he tells about in 63 when he
[2:33:02] talks about standing in the Gap and how
[2:33:03] he got upset and do you understand that
[2:33:06] if God had not had his hand on him and
[2:33:08] he didn't have the baptism of holy ghost
[2:33:10] that have been the end of William
[2:33:10] Brandon right there but justce it wasn't
[2:33:13] the end of of William brandom neither is
[2:33:15] it the end of the Bride because we've
[2:33:17] all come to them same places them dark
[2:33:19] valleys where we didn't think we could
[2:33:21] take another step forward but what was
[2:33:23] it his great
[2:33:25] personality oh thanks be to God his life
[2:33:28] his nature his power his authority
[2:33:32] everything he is I am the vine you the
[2:33:35] branches and that power energized you
[2:33:38] and before you knew it you was back up
[2:33:39] walk this ain't so bad after
[2:33:43] all what was it his
[2:33:46] personality and do you know his
[2:33:48] personality is he don't never give
[2:33:50] up he doesn't know the word defeat
[2:33:53] Hallelujah he doesn't know what the word
[2:33:56] quit
[2:33:57] means he's never been defeated never
[2:33:59] will he ever be defeated and if he's in
[2:34:01] the heart of the Bride that's his
[2:34:03] personality that's my personality it's
[2:34:06] yours
[2:34:08] amen my so the old man is
[2:34:13] crucified firing power message rising of
[2:34:16] the sun brother man said notice Philip

[2:36:15] repent and so forth you're baptized
[2:36:17] that's death by the way I told somebody
[2:36:19] one time I said I know that I'm I'm that
[2:36:21] Ben norad's dead they said how do you
[2:36:23] know I said cuz I was there when they
[2:36:24] buried
[2:36:26] him Hallelujah cuz I was buried in the
[2:36:30] name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah about 26
[2:36:33] years ago I went under the water why I
[2:36:34] was crucified on Calvary with Christ he
[2:36:37] buried me in baptism and I come up in
[2:36:39] the resurrection of Life the dynamic
[2:36:41] power of the Holy Ghost came down and
[2:36:44] changed me made me a new
[2:36:46] man praise the Lord The Old Man Died the
[2:36:48] seed came to life am that's the
[2:36:51] quickening power of the
[2:36:55] seed now that's not to say that
[2:36:58] everybody that listens at tapes and
[2:36:59] things is in the wrong but eventually
[2:37:02] they've got to come to this program of
[2:37:04] needing somebody to explain the word to
[2:37:06] them amen that goes for every single one
[2:37:08] of you here you can stream you can
[2:37:10] listen to messages you can get CDs and
[2:37:13] MP3s from other brothers but eventually
[2:37:16] you need somebody to come and take that
[2:37:17] word and expound it and break it down to
[2:37:19] your
[2:37:20] am we call them
[2:37:22] pastors that's what a pastor is supposed
[2:37:24] to do take the things that you don't
[2:37:26] understand break them down make them
[2:37:27] simple so the people can understand it
[2:37:29] that's what a teacher is supposed to do
[2:37:31] position that word and lay it out
[2:37:33] foundationally he's on thin eyes you see
[2:37:35] Lord cuz when a teacher teaches the word
[2:37:37] he's not preaching preaching is
[2:37:39] generalized it's generalizations I say
[2:37:42] get saved get born again get the Holy
[2:37:43] Ghost all means the same thing but when
[2:37:45] a man's teaching he's on thin ice he
[2:37:47] can't emphasize more than one thing cuz
[2:37:49] saved is not necessarily a born again
[2:37:50] born again is not necessarily the Holy
[2:37:51] Ghost there's a lot of different
[2:37:52] meanings that go with that when you're
[2:37:54] teaching but he takes all them little
[2:37:56] phrases and all them little hard to
[2:37:58] understand places and positions them
[2:38:00] together in the scripture and man he's
[2:38:01] running a 100 miles in every direction
[2:38:03] and you better keep on cuz he's a
[2:38:05] teaching
[2:38:06] locomotive and brother B said he can put
[2:38:09] together he sit under the anointing and
[2:38:10] sit there and listen and put together
[2:38:12] things that the pastor or the Evangelist
[2:38:14] can't even touch yeah Hallelujah brother
[2:38:16] R said warning than judgment he's got
[2:38:18] his place is a part of the
[2:38:20] team amen that's right A lot of people
[2:38:23] if a man ain't jumping up and down
[2:38:25] spitting and slobbering and Hauling at
[2:38:27] devils and everything El well he's not
[2:38:28] breaking the word he's not it's not
[2:38:30] preaching I beg your pardon sometimes
[2:38:33] you need somebody to help you understand
[2:38:35] what it
[2:38:38] means amen as I said many people around
[2:38:41] this message they become what when I was
[2:38:44] a boy I watched wrestling okay you'll
[2:38:46] forgive me Andre the Giant Hulk Hogan
[2:38:49] the whole thing thing Jamie
[2:38:50] knows I I I I I loved it and I'd read
[2:38:54] about these guys you know I I thought it
[2:38:55] was really really neat how they would do
[2:38:57] their deals and all that and I used to
[2:38:58] get so excited when Hogan would start
[2:39:00] doing his little shaking stuff you know
[2:39:02] just rally oh that's great I'd read
[2:39:04] these guys and I found out that
[2:39:06] wrestlers have what they call a cheap
[2:39:08] pop what that means is they go into the
[2:39:10] city whatever city they're in and
[2:39:12] they'll say good to be in New York
[2:39:14] tonight and all the people will Ah
[2:39:16] that's what they call a pop ah so so
[2:39:19] they'll use what they call a cheap pop
[2:39:21] something everybody can relate with so
[2:39:22] they'll holler so they name their City
[2:39:24] cuz they know everybody's going to
[2:39:25] holler at their City I said some
[2:39:27] preachers have become cheap pop artists
[2:39:29] amen that's right they've learned how to
[2:39:31] get in the platform and say where the
[2:39:32] bride where are the elected we're going
[2:39:34] to heaven everybody
[2:39:37] goes but if I stood at that back door
[2:39:39] with a clipboard and I asked you what
[2:39:41] does bride look like what does bride
[2:39:43] believe who is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:39:45] and what's her position I doubt many of
[2:39:47] the people in this message could even
[2:39:48] answer those questions like that cuz to
[2:39:51] them it's just about cheap
[2:39:53] [Applause]
[2:39:55] pops don't get mad at me love
[2:39:59] me it's true praise the lord we need
[2:40:02] people in the message that can break the
[2:40:03] word down make it simple for us help us
[2:40:06] understand what it means for baptism and
[2:40:08] understand what it means for Holy Ghost
[2:40:10] we need men like that in this body we
[2:40:13] need them
[2:40:15] absolutely oh my Lord Dynamic power how
[2:40:17] can I except some man guide me what
[2:40:19] watch again God's provided Place brother
[2:40:20] B said like Samuel said to the people
[2:40:23] one time I've ever told you anything in
[2:40:24] the name of the Lord but what come to
[2:40:25] pass he said whatever I said it happened
[2:40:27] he said oh said we know but we want the
[2:40:29] king anyway he said that's the way it is
[2:40:31] people want to hold on to their Petty
[2:40:33] ideas their Creeds they want to hold on
[2:40:35] to it and talking about a Revival in our
[2:40:37] day how can we have Revival when it's
[2:40:39] all messed up the way it is
[2:40:42] right watered gasoline yes he called
[2:40:47] it he said and everything else mixed
[2:40:49] into it detergents modernistic things
[2:40:52] mixed into it that's right amen he said
[2:40:55] but what we need he said we need a real
[2:40:57] birth and he said and we know that any
[2:40:58] birth is a mess I don't care if it's a
[2:41:01] pig pin or a pink decorated hospital
[2:41:03] room any birth is a
[2:41:06] mess and the new birth is nothing less
[2:41:08] than a mess that's right it'll make you
[2:41:11] boohoo it'll make you cry it'll make you
[2:41:14] carry on Amen y'all don't understand
[2:41:17] what brother B's talking about don't you
[2:41:18] all right boohoo you know that that's
[2:41:21] crying but that's not this little one
[2:41:23] tear goes down the side of your face and
[2:41:27] you that's not boohoo that's not boohoo
[2:41:30] you you just got a little bit
[2:41:31] overwhelmed and amen for a brief moment
[2:41:34] you just a little tear slipped out
[2:41:36] accidentally boohoo is when you can't
[2:41:38] control
[2:41:40] yourself amen come on church amen you're
[2:41:44] uncontrollable in the presence of God
[2:41:46] you're just pouring out your heart you
[2:41:47] can't stop what you're doing it just
[2:41:49] keeps flowing and flowing and flowing
[2:41:51] Hallelujah am amen that's what he meant
[2:41:54] by boohoo and it's a mess amen but
[2:41:57] nowadays in our message we got such a
[2:41:59] repentance is a matter of well Jesus I'm
[2:42:02] sorry I done a few bad things here and
[2:42:05] there but in our hearts we don't we
[2:42:07] don't say this out loud in our hearts
[2:42:09] we're kind of saying but you know I'm
[2:42:10] not all altogether a bad person um I I
[2:42:14] know that I'm you know but so and so
[2:42:15] over there he's just as bad as I that's
[2:42:17] not repentance that's right uhuh that
[2:42:20] ain't what repentance is all about
[2:42:21] repentance is when a person comes to the
[2:42:23] reality I'm a sinner and if something
[2:42:26] don't happen to me I'm on my way to hell
[2:42:29] when they get that reality and that
[2:42:31] moves inside of their heart it ain't
[2:42:33] about Revelation and Doctrine then
[2:42:34] brother it's about the person of God the
[2:42:37] person of God washing away their sins
[2:42:39] taking that old man and burying them
[2:42:41] under the sea of God's forgiveness and
[2:42:43] bringing Resurrection into their heart
[2:42:46] making them a brand new person amen
[2:42:49] watered down
[2:42:50] gasoline got detergents mixed in it no
[2:42:53] wonder people can't get a spark cuz the
[2:42:56] formula is simple repent be baptized in
[2:42:58] the name of Jesus Christ you shall
[2:42:59] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but
[2:43:01] we have spread those little phrases
[2:43:03] apart and put this in and this in and
[2:43:05] this in and then this in and this this
[2:43:07] and this and this and this so there no
[2:43:10] wonder that people sit right around in
[2:43:11] message churches and you still hear the
[2:43:13] question out of people 40 50 60 70 years
[2:43:16] old I don't even know if I got the holy
[2:43:18] ghost or on
[2:43:20] you know why because we've watered down
[2:43:22] the meaning and the message of the
[2:43:23] Gospel am we've made it about
[2:43:26] affiliation rather than
[2:43:31] reconciliation Jes and that's where we
[2:43:33] need some old fashioned
[2:43:36] preaching cuz Hey folks you young people
[2:43:39] listen to me the oldfashioned stuff was
[2:43:41] where the good stuff was
[2:43:43] at you say you don't know nothing about
[2:43:45] it but I've
[2:43:47] tasted I've tasted of what the old
[2:43:49] fashion was and I know it's
[2:43:51] real the oldfashioned stuff is where the
[2:43:53] good stuff is at TH this modern day
[2:43:56] thing of everybody clapping on Q and
[2:43:58] everybody looking good for the cameras
[2:44:00] and everything so proper that that ain't
[2:44:02] boohoo and that ain't that ain't the
[2:44:05] awfulest mess you've ever seen that
[2:44:06] ain't carrying on like brother Bram said
[2:44:09] oh Lord and it sure ain't repentance
[2:44:10] like it needs to be cuz if you've ever
[2:44:13] come to the reality that you're a sinner
[2:44:15] don't tell me you're going to sit there
[2:44:17] with a stone expression on your face
[2:44:19] when you know hell is laying ahead of
[2:44:21] you and you know that any moment if you
[2:44:23] draw your last breath you were on your
[2:44:25] way to a devil's hell don't tell me a
[2:44:27] man or woman set there Stone Face with
[2:44:29] their arms folded acting like
[2:44:30] everything's all
[2:44:32] right no it's a dry eye it's an
[2:44:34] intellectual conceptions what we're
[2:44:36] seeing not the real baptism of the Holy
[2:44:38] Ghost amen God give us
[2:44:41] conviction amen God give us preachers
[2:44:44] that'll preach with conviction amen tell
[2:44:47] the people what's true if it takes the
[2:44:49] hide off them and they lose friends and
[2:44:51] everything let them tell what's
[2:44:53] right Praise Jesus
[2:44:58] amen yeah I'm finished now I I feel it
[2:45:02] except the corn of wheat Falls and the
[2:45:03] ground dies it abides alone but people
[2:45:06] don't want to
[2:45:07] die they want to be alive in the world
[2:45:10] still want to be religious that's right
[2:45:12] so they accept an intellectual
[2:45:14] conception of it listen to this when you
[2:45:17] do that you're still dead in sins and
[2:45:22] trespasses
[2:45:25] amen he said that's what makes people
[2:45:28] act the way they do because the spirit
[2:45:31] that's in them dominates their
[2:45:34] life because they they kind of they mask
[2:45:37] it over with a little cloak of religion
[2:45:39] oh Jes a little religious feeling still
[2:45:41] dead in their sins and trustpass they
[2:45:43] don't realize by unbelief they're
[2:45:46] grieving away their soul and that
[2:45:48] conviction that they might have had they
[2:45:49] grieve it away from and the devil lies
[2:45:51] to them and makes them feel like
[2:45:53] everything's all right but at the hour
[2:45:55] of death when that Soul comes back to
[2:45:58] them they'll realize I've spent my life
[2:46:01] as a deceiver and I've spent it in vain
[2:46:04] I said this about John Collins the
[2:46:05] Bergens and all the rest of these Bunch
[2:46:07] from believe the sign and they can put
[2:46:09] it on that camera put it around the
[2:46:11] world I ain't ashamed what I'm getting
[2:46:12] ready to say they can run their mouth
[2:46:14] day and night all they want to but I'll
[2:46:16] guarantee you one thing when that last
[2:46:18] hour is on them and the death rattles in
[2:46:19] their throat and their soul is coming
[2:46:22] back to them they'll not be worried
[2:46:23] about no Bridge they'll not be worried
[2:46:25] about no Cloud they'll be worried about
[2:46:28] why did I waste my life living as a
[2:46:31] deceiver I'm on my way to
[2:46:33] hell and in that hour they'll call for
[2:46:35] him but it'll be too late they've done
[2:46:36] grieved it away it's over
[2:46:38] with don't let us be those kind of
[2:46:41] people amen don't let this be the the be
[2:46:43] all end all of what don't accept

[2:47:25] God Mighty Jesus
[2:47:31] Oh remember the
[2:47:33] story while Jesus had
[2:47:36] died then the Roman soldier looked up at
[2:47:39] him and said
[2:47:40] surely this must have been the Son of
[2:47:42] God but it was too late amen it was too
[2:47:46] late he' done sealed away is
[2:47:49] hour by mockery debate disgust against
[2:47:53] the king of Israel but after he dies
[2:47:56] surely that's the way it always is after
[2:47:58] he comes and goes then people look
[2:48:00] through the rearview mirror and they say
[2:48:01] surely that had to be the truth but you
[2:48:03] got to remember we're coming to a time
[2:48:05] that when our rearview mirror comes
[2:48:08] it'll be preaching to those that can
[2:48:09] never be saved amen I don't want to
[2:48:12] scare you but I want to be honest with
[2:48:13] you I believe we're coming to a time
[2:48:15] we're already approaching in this
[2:48:17] message an hour Jesus I believe I'm
[2:48:19] already preaching to people that can
[2:48:21] never be saved around this message cuz

[2:48:31] desire to live right they get more
[2:48:33] worldly more hard more did you realize
[2:48:35] what it is it's people sitting in a
[2:48:37] church with religion all the way around

[2:48:43] and neither can they they've crossed the
[2:48:45] line between mercy and judgment and all
[2:48:47] you're doing is you're preaching message
