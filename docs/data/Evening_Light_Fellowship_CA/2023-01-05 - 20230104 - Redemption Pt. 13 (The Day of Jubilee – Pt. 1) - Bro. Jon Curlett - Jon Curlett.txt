Lord just be with us now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen and amen amen God bless you if you turn the scriptures to John chapter 8. it's almost like you came ready for church tonight amen I didn't know what was going on out here and I'm like you know we've got brother Mark you know we're on our our Backup backup song leader and then all of a sudden people are worshiping you know it goes to show the worship is not in The Man Behind the pulpit and then it's in the hearts of the people that are in the congregation amen so we're thankful for that thankful for each one here I want to welcome our brother Michael our sister star and our sister Ursula from Toronto I believe certainly good to have them with us and pray that you'll be blessed Amen in the services and that you'll be a blessing to us as well amen John chapter 8 and verse 30. Jesus and it says as he spake these words many believed on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall be made free and Jesus answered and said unto them verily verily I say unto you whosoever commit a sin is a servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening amen and we're still preaching on the the Jubilee as you might have gathered and we preached three services on the Year of Jubilee and now we're on the day of Jubilee and this is part one of probably two parts maybe three we'll see and you say what's after that then you get to the hour of Jubilee but we'll do that a little later I think amen but the day of Jubilee and I just want to paint a picture really set a foundation for for Sunday's service the Lord willing so maybe you're just a bit more teaching this evening rather than preaching but I wanted us to to get into maybe a bit of what what this day of Jubilee really is and we talked last time in the last few Services about how the Year of Jubilee and and the day of Jubilee that they had was just a type and it was just a shadow amen it was imperfect it was pointing to something coming that Christ was going to fulfill not only in his day but also at the end of of the Gentile dispensation as there was going to be a time of true Freedom there's going to be a time of true Jubilee and as we read there in the scriptures that this kind of Jubilee when you set free then you're free indeed amen it's the real deal it's not a temporary thing it's not a partial thing but it's a true Freedom that only Christ can give us now I remember when I know most of us remember all the things that brother Mark teaches but when he did the series on the feast if you remember then there was always we had that the the day of Jubilee was built into the at and and God had built in that Grace God had built in that debt payment got a built in that freedom into the law but it was only a shadow and really what it was was it was a prophecy it was a prophecy for what was going to come and the problem always is is that we take the Shadow and we get stuck at it and we say this is it and that's what brother Branham said the denominations did is he said they took something they took a partial thing and then they they put a stamp behind and said this is all that we will believe and all it was was types and shadows it was only a partial thing bringing us to the fullness of the opening of the word amen and we want to be very careful today even within the message because what you have to realize is that is God is continuing to unfold himself amen we have the full word and we have the open word but the understanding the Revelation the manifestation and the reality of it is something that is unfolding not behind this Pulpit but in the lives and the hearts of the Believers that will take it and hear it and let it have its reality and let it have its fullness and let it have the preeminence in their lives amen so when we're looking at this day of Jubilee we don't just want to stop at what they had under the law of Moses we don't even want to stop under the day of Jubilee that we're going to speak on today and Sunday but there is a full Jubilee that's coming and we talk about that and that is the day of our Redemption that is the fullness of the Jubilee is when we get out of here amen but in the meantime there is a day of Jubilee and it's a type and it's an Earnest and it's a down payment for what's coming amen but we get so limited it we're so limited by the things that we see and the things that we read because so often we only recognize God when he has already done his work amen amen amen hindsight is always 20 20 and we look at things and we say well that was God that did this and that was God that did that and we see what he did but as our pastors challenged us so often we want to see him when he's doing the work we want to understand what's going on Amen we don't want to just know that we're LED but we want to know why we're LED often we want to understand that we're in the process of God's Redemption we want to understand that we're in the working of the kingdom and so the things that we do the things that we say we want to know that it's God that's doing it and we want to know why he's doing it amen do you know how you know when God is moving in your life church when you are living your life under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit according to the word of God it's that simple then everything that comes your way whether it's opportunity whether it's it's difficulty whether it's trials whether it's battles whether it's blessings whether it's things being taken out of your life you can say that is the Lord that's working in my life because Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God and if you're led by the spirit of God then everything everything that he's doing in your life is ordained by him and so you can walk through that whether it's tough or whether it's good whether it's hard or whether it's easy you can say it's the Lord working in my life and so when times are good you can rest because he's given you a period of rest and when things are tough you can say the Lord is my strength amen so you have confidence of what you're going through is what he has for you amen I believe that God is wanting to make his will known to his bride remember the prophet of God gave that famous quote where he says the bride has the word and she knows what to do with it he's wanting us to know what to do with his word not that we run around willy-nilly just speaking the word but that I read in my devotions just yesterday morning or this morning that in Proverbs where it says a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver right it's perfect it's beautiful but when you speak out of charm when you speak out of your mouth rather than by his inspiration that's when things get twisted up amen amen Jesus said this in John 15 he was speaking to his disciples remember he said henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I heard of my father I have made known unto you have we heard what the spirit said to the churches Amen in Revelation chapter 3 it says he that hath the near let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and that's what we had was we had a Malachi 4 Angel we had a relic Revelation 10 7 Angel come and tell us what the spirit was saying and we're supposed to catch it and we're supposed to know what the father is trying to do in this age he's got a word for this time specifically for us Jesus continues he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he shall give it to you we talked about restoring sight to the blind in the last service remember and we said it's not blindness because they can't see with their eyes but it's blindness because they're in darkness and how God removes blindness as he takes you into the light right he takes you into the light of the word of God he takes you into the presence of God and then as long as we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have Fellowship one with another and we can see what's going on we have eyes to see and we have ears to hear we've got to stay in the word of God we've got to stay in the presence of God we've got to stay in the Revelation for our time and season so that our eyes are not blind because otherwise the blind lead the blind and they both fall into the ditch and that's not where we want to end up but I want to you know we preached on the The Year of Jubilee for the last three services but now we're talking about the day of Jubilee and there's a distinction because the day fits within the year and so you could have the start of the Year of Jubilee and not be free and you weren't free on the first day of the Year of Jubilee though it was the Year of Jubilee but you had to come to a time you had to come to a day where the Year of Jubilee was now fulfilled and you were actually free to go amen but rather this happened on a particular day so if we look in Leviticus 25 we've read this before but just to set the foundation it says thou shall number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be under the 49 years so he says take 49 years he says then shall shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee to you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family now that sounds really really easy and it sounds really simple but I want you to catch something before the day of Jubilee happens there's a whole lot that has to happen before there's a whole process to this Jubilee that goes on and every single bit of it has a has a type and has a shadow and it has a purpose and it's God showing us what he's going to do in the future so you'll remember this this slide that brother Mark put up and it's the feast slides and if we look here before we get to the day of atonement we've got one two three four five feasts before we ever come to atonement so you've got to go through all the way through more than half the year you've got to do 190 days of the year before you get to the jail Jubilee and you've got to go through a whole process you've got to go through a lot of things listen if you're a slave you had to go through an awful lot of work before you got to the day of Jubilee because they had to get all their harvesting before you got free you had to do a bunch of work to get there you had to earn your last year you had to learn your last little bit of Freedom that you were going to get they worked you hard for those 190 days of that year amen now remember God puts a timeline on this and he has a reason for the timeline amen it's all a type and a shadow like I said it's it's pushing us forward amen but on the day of atonement that was the day you could go free it was only on the day of atonement they had lots of great feasts before that they had lots of Feasts where where Lambs were killed and prices were paid and celebrations were given but it was only on the day of atonement that you were allowed to go free amen and that's because that was the day that the sin penalty was paid you remember they had 10 days of or seven days I forget now but they had those days where they had to sit there 10 days yes from the first to the 10th they had to sit there and they had to dwell on how they had failed they had to dwell on their Humanity they had to dwell on their faults and failures it was a very sober time and it was God reminding them you can't get there on your own that you need a sacrifice you need an atonement for your sins that as good as you may have been brother or sister you're not good enough to meet God's expectation so then they would come up to the day of atonement and that soberness was still there but then they laid their hands on the on the body of their perfect sacrifice the lamb and then they could be free and so the point was that you had to have a price paid to go free and that's why the day of Jubilee was on the Feast of atonement or the day of atonement it was a symbolism that when your price was paid you could go free and that's what's going through all of this amen but again it's just a type and a shadow because when we get to the real day of Jubilee it doesn't follow this timeline and there's a very specific reason for it amen it was different when it was fulfilled and it was perfect when it was fulfilled that's why we don't hold the types and shadows perfectly is because they're only a shadow they're only a representation they're not always perfect in that amen but we read in the opening scripture where Jesus said in John 8 he says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed Jesus has already declared the Year of Jubilee it's already done and he's sitting there and he's saying there's more to come there's something that you have never experienced yet you have healed the sick you have cast out demons all these things obey you disciples but there's something greater coming to you that you haven't experienced yet and nobody no slave no person no Hebrew has ever experienced the freedom that I'm going to give you when the day a jubilee happens amen this wasn't going to be like any other day of Jubilee amen we've said before that on the day of Jubilee you could walk away from your debts you can walk away from your problems you can walk away from The Faults that have brought you to the condition that you were in but you weren't free indeed because when you walked away you still had the debt nature that made you getting dead in the first place right you had that spending nature you had that those faults and failures you had those addictions you had those those issues inside your body still there when you walked away free and that's why they had a seven year Jubilee was because our Nature has fallen and we're constantly getting ourselves back into the same problems over and over and over again why you weren't free indeed you were just free of that debt but you weren't free you're just free of the debt Jesus says when I set you free you're going to be free indeed there's going to be something else amen when he says indeed what's he saying he's saying this time it's going to be different and you'll know it's different because you won't be the way you were when you went into that debt when you went into that prison when you went into that slavery when I looked up that word in the original language that word indeed means you'll be free truly completely certainly you'll be clean you'll be clean whatever you have that was causing you to get into these issues it's going to be completely gone away from you amen it reminds me of the woman at the well because she went there and she was thirsty and she came with something to get water and every day she would go to that same place and she would gather water why because she was thirsty and every day for years and years she went and she filled up her water bottle and then she went back into the City and she drank it and her thirst was satisfied for a moment but she had to come back to the well every day amen but there come a day where she met Christ and he says if you drink the water that I've got you'll never thirst again you'll be free indeed from this thing that's bothering you amen and we know that after that she never went back and found another husband she had found her husband it was Christ the word and he made a change in her life and she left what her water pots behind why to signify that her thirst was satisfied that it had been quenched not the natural the natural we always fight but this was something that satisfied what was deep inside her it resolved the problems that made her have to go to the well in the middle of the hot day rather than with the other women amen it resolved the same question in her life and she goes in and now she starts to testify she says is not this the very Christ who told me everything I did ever in my life and many people believed they took her witness and they went and listened to him and they got the same thirst quenching experience that she got amen it's a wonderful thing when he sets you free indeed amen that's what we're looking for but I want you to catch something here because you can't set someone free if you yourself aren't free amen you can pay the debt for somebody if you don't have the debt paid off on your land you can't go redeem somebody's property or their person if you yourself don't have your property in person free a slave cannot redeem a slave but you had to be a Freeman and a free woman and you had to have your own property before you could go get somebody else's and I say that because there's these doctrines floating around these days where people are saying that we redeem other people that husbands or fathers redeem their wives and redeem their families and it's the biggest load of bunk I've ever heard because why you are the redeemed you are not the Redeemer and you will never see in the scripture where anything clothed in flesh other than Christ Jesus is the Redeemer there is only one man that is a redeemer and that is Christ amen so what do we do we point to him we point to him we give evidence of his redeeming work but we are not even fully redeemed ourselves we only have the earnest of our Salvation we're not fully saved we're not fully redeemed until we get a new body amen brother Brandon would say it this way he says you don't have to be judged you don't have to think yourself worthy you'll never be worthy so when we sit there and say I'm not worthy then say praise the Lord that's a great starting place when you realize you're not worthy that's a great place to be because that means that you'll start to accept the things that Christ has for you he says but Christ was worthy and you're stead that paid the price he said not trying to redeem something you can't redeem it because you ain't got the money to but God had the money and he sent Christ and settled the bill and redeemed you from your sickness from your sorrows and your worry and your sin and your backsliding he sent the money which was Christ Jesus and deposited it on Calvary on golgotha's hill and tonight every one of you is free what if you'll pay for it no if you'll believe it amen so we're looking to be redeemed back to something and we need to see that the Redeemer has it all in control himself that he himself is in full Authority that he's in full power that he's in his place of possession that he knows who and what he is and he has the real Goods amen it can't be a fake it's got to be the real deal we ought to be able to see if we're being redeemed back to a place then we ought to be able to see the person that's redeeming us living and acting in that place amen he ought to be setting the example for us to show us where he's taking us back to because the Redemption thing is a journey Redemption is a journey it's a process it's not a moment brother Brown would say this and the unfailing realities of the Living God he said when God made man in his own image he put him on the earth as a Lesser God Jesus declared it when he said is it not written in your laws that you are gods and if they called those Gods who the word of God come to which was the prophets how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God he said see they just couldn't understand it see but man was put here with the dominion over the Earth he had everything under his control and what Adam lost he says Jesus proved that he had restored remember the the disciples said even the wind and the waves obey him even nature obeys him see it wasn't just demon powers and it wasn't just diseases and it wasn't just discernment of all these things but they said even nature obeyed him because remember brother Branham said that Adam had fallen total control over nature he was a God on Earth and so everything that he lost Christ had to come back and show that he was in the Adam position again in perfect Authority in perfect control and perfect power so that he could say this is where I'm taking you to church this is where your Redemption that's what it looks like is what the supreme authority of somebody subjected to the power of God in their lives to have dominion over everything that's around them it says he stopped nature he raised the dead he done everything and the world is groaning today listen to this the Bible said for the manifestations of the sons of God for God to get his children again in realities to make things real that's what God wants for us is a reality in our life remember I said last time Satan would love nothing better than for us to come to church and Nod our heads to whatever the the minister might say and then walk out and never have a reality of it in our lives Satan would take that deal every time because what he's scared about is a real believer not a head-notting believer that's what we're looking for is the reality of Christ in our life amen then brother Bob says this statement he says it stumbles the people what stumbles the people there's a few things that stumble the people one they can't believe that God would dwell in flesh that was the problem when Jesus came was that they were looking for a messiah and then when it came it didn't match up to what they thought was possible because why why did they turn Christ down the majority the priesthood especially because he wouldn't acknowledge them and they said if he can't acknowledge us he can't be the real deal and that was their problem the scripture says they were jealous of him they were envious of him and that's why they turned him down not only that I read this morning they didn't just try to kill him they tried to kill Lazarus who was a testimony of the very power of God in Jesus that's how badly they hated what he was was because he had more than they had he he demonstrated more than they could ever imagine but he wouldn't acknowledge them and they were envious of it and then the people looked at that and they said God is doing the Miracles but God can't dwell in flesh and that's exactly what we had in this age we had God come down and dwell in flesh and those of you that know me just for the visitors sake I don't believe brother Brandon was God but I believe that God used that man perfectly he had to because brother Brandon would come out of the discernment and he'd say was what he said true he wasn't even speaking it was just God using his voice at that point that's how closely God stepped down into flesh brother Branham said he's here the same as he was 2000 years ago except the Corporal body except the literal body it was Christ using a man and brother Bradham says it stumbles the people when we talk about for God getting into his children not child not son of man Children You and I he's saying it stumbles you because you can't believe it and if you can believe that he would use it in Christ if you can believe that he would use it in brother Branham then you say but he could never use it in me and that's what stumbles you said you can't believe that he will come into you in the same way now listen I already said it before none of us is ever going to have the gift of brother Branham had that was the angel to the seventh Church age it was specific for him nobody else will ever have anything like it it's not going to come but he still has gifts in the church he still has discernment he still has people men and women that are LED of God I was talking to a brother the other day about discernment and he says I know sisters that have as big a gift of discernment as as the brothers do God is no he's no respect to a persons or of gender amen there's some things that sisters aren't allowed to do they're not allowed to be behind this Pulpit but they can speak in tongues they can prophesy they can have all of these gifts the same as the men can because God doesn't care anymore why because we're under a law of Grace now and it is for whosoever will I'll pour out my spirit on my sons and my daughters right on my handmaidens as well sisters don't sell yourself short now you have access to the very same holy spirit that us Brothers do amen in fact brother Bradham said he said Remember the women he says the sisters are often more sensitive to the spirit than the brothers are shame on us Brothers amen let's raise our level up amen let's get into it but then we have the people that are stumbled because they thought they already had the reality and that's what a denomination is is when you put the period behind it and you say I've got everything that I need and then God comes into greater reality and you say nope because what would that require you to do humble yourself to admit that you're not where you thought you were listen I freely admit I'm not in a Rapture Ready condition you know how I know because I'm not gone and you're not either so let's not pretend amen let's keep seeking more let's keep seeking more of the filling of the Holy Spirit more of a surrender in our life more of a sanctification in our lives amen so that he would have free access to use us the way he wants to use us in our life amen that's the prayer of my heart these days Lord use me I want to get out of here I want to get out of here if there's anything I want to do is get out of here that's the greatest desire of my heart see my children saved and get out of here that's it and when our last one's in brother sister we're gonna go it'll be a very short quick work and then we're out of here amen but I look forward to that but until then I say Lord keep working don't let me rest on my Laurels don't let me stop with the victories let's keep pressing the battle for each one of us amen you young women and young men you know what God loves to hear from you I am weak but Thou Art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong I'll be Satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to thee because then you can understand that when he's got something for you you'll accept it because you recognize that there's something that you need that's more than what you have amen and it'll keep us humble and as we've read in the those quotes in the last few services our brother bam said humility he said God is humility and humility is God I was talking to a minister today and I said I'm very careful how I pray because I said I don't say Lord Make Me humble that's like praying for patience and you never want to pray for those things I said Lord keep me humble don't let me get to the point where you have to push me down let me stay down willingly Amen to not think more of myself than I ought to you I don't like The Humbling I'd rather stay where I'm at by God's grace yes I need more don't get me wrong I'm not saying I don't need more humility but I'm saying Lord Keep Me Down amen because that's when God can use you when you think you're something then God has completely put out of the picture amen not sure how I went there but the Lord knows amen but what is it that we're looking for we're looking for God to display himself in us that's it scripture scripture what your your lights your your candles your torches on a hill people need to be able to see that there's something in all of the darkness and all the mess and all the chaos and all of the isms and all of the social justice and programs and platforms today they need to see that there is sanity that their stability that there is something that holds true no matter what this world is going through amen amen what is it brother Adams he points to the manifestation of the sons of God he says that is what stumbles the people first that they think it can't happen and then two that it can't happen to them that can be in that great brother because he's a great Minister but never in me because I'm just a humble housewife a young single sister a young brother no no no no God's looking for surrendered Hearts listen if he can start with David when he's a little kid think Samuel before he's a teenager he could he could start with you anywhere and humble yourself and say Lord I need you and Lord I want to have you and Lord I want to have you completely in my life amen amen you got to get the goods so this is what we're talking about remember Redeemer can't redeem somebody unless he is in his full possession you got to have the goods before you can give the goods amen you got to have the new birth before you can tell somebody what the new birth is and lead them to it there's got to be the real thing in your life before you can do it God always brings it into you before he tells you to give it to somebody else before he gets you to point it you've got to have a reality before they do amen brother Brown says this and the message here you hear him he says all things are possible to them that believe we've got the untapped resources of God at our hands to do what to make ourselves look good to build a fine Ministry to draw people to us to prove that's a trick for the believer prove it no no no he says to display God amen that's all we're a vessel to display God we are Sons and Daughters of God and when God made man he made him a God he gave him a dominion over the Earth but his Fallen estate dropped that but what they lost by Adam it was restored by Christ he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass you can have what you've said all things whatsoever you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it he says amen He restored to us all that was lost in Adam listen we saw Christ heal the sick we saw him raise the Dead we saw him cast out demons we saw him do all these wonderful works we saw him walk on water we saw him still the wind and the waves and yet that was not the greatest thing you know what the greatest victory that Christ had over himself that's what he had to prove to us is that there is victory over yourself in the word of God because that's the greatest thing he had to do was come to the place where even when he went to lay his life down he would say not my will but thine be done hey man he knew that he was meant to give it and he laid it down he gave the word authority over his very body and life that's how far he went with it amen he knew his purpose was to do what display the word of God for his time and he did it and it took him all the way into the grave listen this is how how good it was for Jesus there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler the Jews that same came to Jesus by night said to him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with them listen when you got the priesthood not just Nicodemus who we know was a a closet believer at least for a while but he says listen we know he says even if we don't want to admit it we know that you can't do this except to be of God but they couldn't accept him as the Christ could they as the Messiah but they knew that God was with them amen it was undeniable and yet they denied it because of their Petty envy that they had in their lives amen now I want to walk through this process as we start to get into the meat of the service here amen because remember we had five feasts and then we had the day of atonement which was the day of Jubilee but when Christ came things played out differently and I want to kind of work our way through the feasts here and there's just three of them but he started with the Feast of the Passover and that was the sacrifice and the eating of the Lamb if you remember now traditionally they had to eat the entire lamb that had been killed remember and if you didn't have enough people if you had a small family and a big lamb then they said bring your neighbor in because you've got to eat it all you've got to eat all of the Lamb you can't have anything left over and then they'd eat unleavened bread and they drink the wine and it was an example of being ready to go out quickly you know what it was a a reminder for us to do don't get tied down here don't get so caught up in things don't get so caught up in what's coming next but the next big step the next big vacation the next house the next vehicle the next move in your career that you forget that you've got to be ready to leave quickly nothing can be held dear here don't even make bread just leave it unleavened so you can just throw it in the oven and quick and you get it out and yeah it's hard and it's not so tasty but it had to be ready to go you had to have something you could take in your bag and go and it would hold up for a longer while amen but that was just a reflection of The Exodus from Egypt that's what the Passover was remember it was to memorialize The Exodus from Egypt but now it's a reflection of the Jubilee now Matthew 26 remember Jesus is is in the Passover and he says as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body remember Paul says in Corinthians 11 later First Corinthians 11 he says this is my body which is broken for you and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins now the prophet of God would say this he said all down through the age it's been Revelation Revelation and tonight it's Revelation not an outward form not a declaration of Creeds not a group of prayers not a string of beads but a direct Revelation that God has revealed to you that Christ is your Passover Lamb that he bore your sins and you've accepted him as a sin offering in your stead he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it he said you see it's a revelation we get into problems when we think that something other than Christ is the thing that's keeping us where we're at that's giving us the victory that's done the work and it's usually ourselves we're injecting into the situation right I read the scripture where Paul says I do not frustrate the law of Grace I don't inject myself into it because the minute I get into performance anxiety Then I get in God's way but I gotta sit back and say I'm still under grace Lord as good as I get I'm still under grace because that's the only thing that's going to hold me until we get to the other side amen brother Brandon would say this he says communion was held first way down in Egypt the first of the communion which was the Passover Lamb that was slain which was the type of Christ and many of us are familiar with that blessed old story of how they who took the communion down there walked through the Wilderness for 40 years now catch this when they come out there wasn't a feeble one among them free indeed and there even their clothes was not even threadbare for 40 years God had kept them what a Blessed Assurance it is to us tonight if that be the type then Christ is the anti-type and how that God delivered the children says if that if he did that in the natural then what is he going to do in the Fulfillment of the type if that's how good it was under the the shadow then how good is it under the reality are you listening church when they took the communion and when you take the communion when you partake of Christ when you eat all of Christ when you take all of the word amen it will sustain you on your journey because this is a journey the Jubilee is a journey it's not just a day but it's taking you somewhere brother Bob said Redemption has taken you out of something and into something and Jubilee didn't just take you out of prison but it took you back to your inheritance it didn't just take you out of slavery but it took you back to your family and on that Journey their sustenance and God always makes a way amen God has a provided way for you so that no matter what happens you'll always make it through your clothes won't wear out your shoes won't wear out you'll have food and you'll have water and you'll have a Guiding Light all the way through you'll have the presence of God with you Paul would say this in Philippians he says being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you has he begun it yeah so say this with me we'll perform it until the day of Jesus Christ the day of Jesus Christ is the ultimate Jubilee no man knoweth the day we're preaching on the day of Jubilee or the hour and there comes an hour of Jubilee and that's in a moment in the blinking of an eye will be caught up to meet him in the air amen this is the process of full deliverance and it starts with a perfect sacrifice we still needed a perfect sacrifice to go through this amen it's it starts with what Christ calling you out and what is it that's the trumpet that's the gospel letting you know you can go free and that's the start of it is you've got to hear the trumpet and you've got to know that the price is paid amen you got to know the day you're living in the day of atonement back then and you had to hear the sound you had to hear the gospel trumpet in that day brother badam is pointing to this Exodus out of Egypt he says that was the first of the jubilees he says and it's always the start of a journey a jubilee always takes you somewhere that's the biggest problem we face I think as Believers is that we we go in we maybe we're in a service maybe we're in prayer and and we're seeking freedom and God gives us freedom and then what do we do with that freedom we stay right where we are and we don't do anything with it God sets us free for a purpose and it's to bring you to your position it's to bring you to your places to bring you to your land is to bring you to your inheritance it's to bring you into fellowship with him he doesn't just want you to sit there and say praise the Lord I'm free but he wants you to go to the place that he's prepared for you as well amen amen amen then after that they had the Feast of unleavened bread now unleavened bread you've got to remember as the name says it has no leaven in it so what does leaven do to bread it lifts it off it Puffs it up it puts air inside of it it's false it's false humility so often it's really Pride that Puffs it up but remember this is the starting point for every believer and Christ fulfilled that because he was the perfect word there is no spot or wrinkle found in him remember he was before and he was judged we covered this in previous services and everything that they tried to do to him yet they had no witnesses that could say anything that he did wrong Gentile or Jew nobody found any fault in him remember he lived a perfect life by the word of God and so he was a perfect example that if we could live our lives by the word that is untainted it would have the perfect result that's why we needed a Malachi 4 Prophet to come and restore us the word is because you can't get a Perfect Bride without a perfect word and we've been so tied up in doctrines and denominations and men's ideas and these different things many of them very spiritual but not perfect and our profit wasn't perfect but he came to restore us back to a perfect word that was brought to us not only by Christ but by the Apostle Paul and these different ones amen we needed a restoring messenger because we had to have the fullness of the word so that we could be the fullness of the word if I could put it that way brother Brown says this this is a month less than a month before he died he says no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you now you read that and you say brother John does that mean I have to be perfect my life has to be perfect no he said no leaven among you remember what was the 11 of the Pharisees what did Jesus say to him about their leaven he says this people draws nigh to me with their mouth and honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men so remember we talked last service about the little isms that brother Branham warned us about and listen we've got them floating around in the message too where you have to sit under a certain Ministry you have to believe a particular Doctrine you have to preach a certain way you have to focus on this and you have to ignore that and we got churches that are cold and starchy you got churches that blow up the minute you say one word from behind the pulpit and everything in between and half of them think that if you aren't just like them then you're wrong that's what teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men it's putting our little ideas to what spirituality is rather than letting the word have its way and the Holy Spirit have its way listen you're not going to go to every country in the world and they're going to be able to to sing and worship like our African brothers and sisters good luck getting white people to do that ain't gonna happen you guys are lucky right but sometimes you need to sit still and nobody beats a German that's sitting still and just listening and receiving amen that's why God has a a multitude of flowers in the garden amen each one of us he works with us according to the way that we are that's what's so beautiful is he doesn't try and put us into this one box or pattern but he works with us the way that he made us and so he can worship with with our African brothers and sisters you go over to Japan listen they don't worship like anybody you think the Germans are bad go look at the Japanese it's just not the same but that doesn't mean the spirit of the Lord's not there you may not shout and dance around the way we do but that doesn't mean the spirit of the Lord's not there just means they're different amen but we get these little isms and brother Bram says what no leaven among you we need to break down those walls and barriers listen I'm not talking about we're going to have a fellowship with people that have wrong Doctrine no no no I'm saying let's not make a Doctrine the pet that gets you into the Rapture and keeps them out he says he couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in a Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs amongst his people this isn't brother Brown just talking about himself he talks he says promised by Malachi 4 but he keeps pointing to people that's more than one person people multitudes he's talking about a bride body now he says showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on Earth in the form of a prophet God oh he says Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures he says where do you worship at the house of God seated in where are we seated in today is brother Brown I'm the only one seated in Heavenly places no we all are and they have been since Paul preached it and before Paul preached it just because Paul preached it didn't mean they weren't seated in Heavenly places with Christ we're all there we're all there brother I'm saying listen you got to recognize where God is and it's not just in the ministry it's not just in the men it's not just in the elders it's not just in the pastor listen he's seated in each and every one that is a temple of the Holy Ghost amen we want the reality of gods in our life of God in our life not God's in our life story we want the reality of gods in our life amen and we need the purity of the word and that means we've got to be feeding on the word of God daily listen I was I was talking with someone earlier this week so here's what happens when church is your only experience remember we're going to say up is spiritual well Joe we're going to use your words here down is religious okay this is backsliding and this is walking in the light and we can't see this probably back there can we let me see if I can get a better marker okay so what happens when we're when church is the only thing we get hope this is okay remember if you're not moving forward if you're not building yourself up in the Most Holy Faith in the week you're not moving forward so what are you doing you're going down then we hit Wednesday and what do we do we get a boost we don't feed ourselves we get to Sunday what do we do right where we started you know we call this walking in the desert but what happens to the one that's feeding themselves now I'm not saying that when you feed yourself it's the same as coming to church I'm not trying to say that what I'm saying is you're moving forward you're moving up and so let's say you're let's say you're the weakest of believers you only get up a little bit right you're not not moving very far but you're up and then you hit Wednesday and then what do you do you jump up then you go to Sunday you're going all the way in just a little bit then you get to Sunday and you go here look at the difference between those two people just a little bit just a little bit amen you know what's supposed to happen this is a house of correction remember this is where the movement is and then these are the bumpers this lets you know if you're on the right path you know what's supposed to be happening during this time you're supposed to be recognizing the word you're supposed to be recognizing the presence of God so that when you come in here you recognize it when it's here too so that is The Minister's preaching you can say amen I read that this week I read that that last week I know what he's saying is the truth because I've read my Bible listen I can make quotes say anything I want I can literally preach Antichrist Doctrine directly out of the message I can preach preach Antichrist messages right out of this Bible right because that's what they did they twist things around with the scriptures but if I'm preaching to a people that has been doing this all week then what do you have you have a constant trajectory like that rather than this around and around and around and the thing is you wonder why you don't have the victory it's because you're never above where you started the week amen the holy spirit's the teacher listen he's given us a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints but that doesn't get you out of the responsibility of doing your portion amen you know what it's like listen we come into church when it when it's special meetings and I can say this tonight because it's a wonderful atmosphere tonight I can say as we come into special means and what is it we're ready to go we're prayed up we got we got our needs ready to go and we're expecting listen when you do that during the week you come in completely different than if you're just going around because what you're trying to do is you're trying to get the ministry to raise you up rather than let God work with you through the entire week you don't have to make big steps you just have to make steps that's all you're looking for is to keep going up so that Satan can't drag you down over and over and over again amen after that was the Feast of the first fruits amen and this was the early Harvest and if you remember it was The Barley which was the the common the the common grain it wasn't the the one that was most valued but it was the quick one and it kind of got them through if they they had a poor harvest before that was the one that came quick and kind of saved them and whatnot and if the first fruits was good then they waived it remember and it was proof that what was coming was going to be just like the one they waved if it had started to grow and they had a first fruit it meant that there was a crop coming and even though it would take longer it was going to be good as well if the first was good then the end would be good amen if Alpha was good then Omega was going to be good if the first was going to be good then the last was going to be good but what was the first fruit that Christ showed because we sit here and we look at the signs and wonders and we look at the healings we look at all these different things and that was good that was proof that he could redeem us to that position but what is Our Hope our hope is not just to be here doing signs and wonders or at least I hope it's not our hope is to get out of here our hope is that if we die we'll raise again and our hope is that those that are alive and remain will be caught up amen that is the great hope because I'm still fighting this flesh even after the baptism of the Holy Spirit even after the infilling of the spirit I'm still fighting I want to get out of the fight the fight with this and then what happens we'll come back with him as king of kings and Lord of lords and then we'll have a battle where we can never be defeated amen but we got to get through this battle time first and what do we want to do we want to get out of the battle we want to have our three and a half year rest at the marriage supper of the land amen we want to take our our break we want to be with our bridegroom we want to spend time with him where Satan can't get at us anymore amen that's what we're looking for so Paul said in First Corinthians he says if there be no resurrection of the dead then is Christ not risen why because his experience is our experience he's the first fruit so whatever he does we do and if we don't rise that means he didn't rise and if Christ be not risen then as our preaching in vain and your faith also in vain and if Christ be not raised your faith is in vain ye are yet in your sins basically says if Christ didn't rise then the whole work was no good then also they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished so we've been believing a lie if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable amen what is it there's a life after this that we're really looking forward to amen after all this life is over and our works on Earth are ended and we stand before the Mountaintop so tall all all looking over in that City that the savior is preparing gives me faith that I can make it after all amen he says but now as Christ risen from the dead now present tense and become the first fruits of them that slept for since my Man Came Death by man also came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam I'll die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ at his coming so when did he become the first fruits when he healed the blind man when he when he healed the lepers when he cast The Demon out of the man of godira when he walked on the water when he caused the wind and the waves to to cease no when he rose from the dead amen if he didn't rise from the dead then it was all in vain that's what Paul said we're looking for what a body change we're looking for a supernatural body we're looking for for a glorified body amen where we don't have to fight anymore where we can have our rest and relaxation amen and what what did he do it for why did he do it to take away our fear of laying down our lives listen he believed the word to the point where he gave his life up he gave up the ghost remember he says I no one takes my life I give it he gave up his life he allowed himself to die because he believed that the word that said he was going to have to die also said that he was going to raise up and then he'd pick it up again on the third day amen what was he trying to do give us faith that we can trust that we can have assurance that if we take the word of God he'll never see it not come to pass that's all he's trying to get us to do that is the great question for us is will it stumble us or will we step out in faith and say the same thing that he did for Christ the same thing that he did in Christ I should say is the same thing that he's going to do in me what was he saying you can't lose if you die out now I was reading this morning where where Jesus said except a corn a wheat fall on the ground and die it die it abides alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit you can't bring out forth any fruit in yourself now remember when a corn dies it goes down it comes up and then it builds a whole thing right so you know if you've ever eaten corn like brother vichel you know there's a lot of corn on a cob right it's not just one there's a lot of them and Jesus said listen when you go down and die when I go down and die says I'm going to bring a lot with me and when you go down and die what do you bring you can you can't bring forth any fruit that's lasting in yourself but when you die you come back and you bring something with you amen something that's going to last something that has Eternal value so we went through the three different feasts and it's three but if we followed the law of Moses we'd have two more before we get to the Feast of atonement but we know that the Jubilee is going to be next because it's going to be Pentecost so what happened there why don't we have to go to the Feast of atonement because remember the Feast of atonement was proof that the price was paid for your debt remember when we have Christ dying then what was that for us that wasn't just unatonement that was the atonement prophet of God would say that was an eternal atonement so when you have an eternal atonement and you have an eternal day of atonement then what do you have you have an everlasting day of jubilee don't you that means that you the the trumpet can sound every day and you can go free every day that your price is paid every day that you can go to your inheritance every day that you can be restored to your position you can be restored to your family you can be restored to your place you can be restored to Fellowship every single day without anybody being able to hold anything against you when he died he paid the price and the price is paid for what had been done what was being done and what was going to be done the price was covered the blood is is perfect in these different things amen we don't have to wait for the Harvest we don't catch this we don't have to work for it we don't have to work for it the price is paid we don't have to stay in that slavery we just have to wait until what the day of Pentecost we just got to wait 50 days that's all we need it's not 190 anymore it's 50. you don't have to pay the price program said but thank God rich and mercy he sent forth A Savior Jesus Christ he sent forth Jesus to be both Savior and healer for he said as Moses lifted up the breast servant in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up for the same purpose he the atonement that's what we have claim upon nothing but the atonement I want you to catch that you have no claim to the promises of God except by the atonement so often we go and we say Lord I've done this I've been faithful that no no no no that's what gets him to trust you but that's not what gives you access to him that's what gives him access to you if you think about it is when you're surrendered when you're when you're you're letting him have pre-evidence and you're doing well that's him having access to you to do something good but that's not what the requirement is for you to get the blessings and and the good things of God for healing in this particular case he says what nothing but the atonement that's what we have claim upon what Jesus purchased by his blood that's what we have claims upon the Bible said he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed that's what we can claim because that's what the atonement that we stand for ordered for us he says God rich in Mercy that was to be an eternal atonement because he came himself God came himself in the form of sinful flesh to make an eternal atonement and suffered In the Flesh and made the atonement and returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement we're no brass serpent or no Troubled Water could do it it all pointed to that perfect atonement he said God rich in his Mercy has did this no waiting there's no waiting you can go free now now right you don't have to be prayed for you don't have to come forward when the trumpet sounds you can go free right there you can drop your hoe as we read walk away and say you can't touch me anymore that's what he's talking about amen so we don't have to go to a feast of atonement because we have an eternal atonement that is constantly there until the taking away the bride hey the blood's still on is still on the mercy CD amen there's still Grace there's still Mercy today Paul would say this in Hebrews he said but Christ being common high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us an eternal atonement gives us Eternal Redemption means that it's a finished work at Calvary there's nothing left to do remember brother Brown would say he says I can't if Christ was himself here in the Corporal body he couldn't heal you any more than he did two thousand years ago it's a finished work he says you just have to believe it and accept it immense have finished work brother Brian said here's the quote he says when Jesus died at Calvary he settled the same question forever before the father because he was a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was our Kinsmen Redeemer so if we look now at our feast days this is where we used to be was we used to have to come all the way to here so now we're under grace we're not under the law so this is not what we have to wait for but now our atonement is right at the front the atonement happens right there and so then we've just got unleavened bread the purity of the word we've got the first fruits which is Christ himself and then you call them all the way up to Pentecost and it's a finished work not just in him but it's a finished work in you you don't have to wait for any of these things now we remember that that that it's a 50-day cycle and if you remember in Leviticus 25 it says you shall hallow the 50th year Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee to you and you shall return every man to his possession you should return every man to his family so we have the number 50 going up to the day of Pentecost and then we have the number 50 for the 50th year which is the Year of Jubilee and that's not a coincidence God has a numerology and I don't get stuck on it but God has a numerology and there's a reason why he does things amen so remember we talked about it in the in the previous verses God said in judgment to Israel he says you missed out on the jubilees and so you'll pay one year for every Jubilee you'll pay one year in slavery for every every Jubilee day that you missed remember that so it's one year for a day then coming around now when he's setting them free God says you'll wait one day for every year see judgment makes you wait long for short now when mercy comes it gives you short for long gives you one day for every year so he says now you've got to wait 50 days for the 50 years that you're supposed to have to wait amen so it's a perfect part it's a perfect type being brought now right this is where we see what God was really meaning brother I would say 50 is Pentecost and he says Jubilee then in Acts 2 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now I want to stop there we keep I know I keep referring to it in Joel 2 28 but he says I'm going to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh these days we have this great push for equity and diversity and inclusion listen this was the first great Equity diversity and inclusion that you'll ever see and God said if you obeyed my word and you went up and you waited in that room you got the Holy Ghost it didn't matter if you were poor or Rich male or female a minister a member of the lady didn't matter slave didn't matter your past didn't matter your family name good or bad didn't matter how much money you had in your pocket didn't matter how much you've been sweating and stinking or if you were perfectly perfumed if you obeyed the word of God then you got the Holy Ghost every single one of them 120 120 people came out of there full of the Holy Ghost and every single one of them had signs and wonders going on every single one of them is talking and everyone understands what they're saying no matter what their natural language was their native language was that's for us church that's the true Jubilee because remember the type of Jubilee was only for the Hebrew it was only for the Israelite it was only for the children of Abraham naturally speaking but they go up there and it doesn't matter who you are now anyone can go free that's what we're looking at in these things amen and so it is today Acts 2 38 is still the key we've forgotten it in the message I fear we've forgotten it because it says what repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and brother Branham said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is what receiving the word for your day remember what Jesus said he said how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come we've got people saying today that the message is the Holy Ghost that's a contradiction of scripture remember in Revelation it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying so the spirit is saying something and you've got to have the spirit to hear and recognize and then you've got to have the spirit to receive it amen amen because otherwise we sit in here and we turn this message into an intellectual Revelation where we know the doctrines but we lack the reality and the life of the Christ that gave it to us we lack the very holy spirit that spoke it but because we recognize it as truth we say that makes us as Believers no you've got to have the life of it because the letter killeth and the letter of the message still kills if you don't have the spirit quickening it inside of your life amen why because truth is not words truth is a person right truth is a reality not just a Doctrine and I'm going to prove it to you by the word amen how do I know gravity is real because it works how do I know the word of God is real because it works Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man coming to the father but by me it's all in Christ remember he's the open door he's the word The Truth May manifest and he's the life that makes the word a reality inside of us so you've got to have him inside of you to have the life otherwise you've just got the letter and the letter is what killed the the Sadducees and the Pharisees and every religious person in those ages even though they sat in church every single day they sat in their synagogues they sat in their Tabernacles and said we're looking for him aside we're looking for him aside that's the danger for the believer today I'm looking for a Rapture I'm looking for a Rapture and you don't have the Holy Ghost that's making it a reality in our lives that's what we're seeking we're seeking the life that's gonna what the same one that took that Christ laid down so that he could go in was the one that raised them up out and that's the same thing we've got to have it's the one that allows us to have faith as we lay our lives down and surrender ourselves to Christ is going to pick us up in newness of life and it's going to take us all the way off into eternity amen brother Bradham said this he says I'll tell you a genuine Holy Spirit experience will punctuate every sentence of that Bible with an amen but that doesn't mean that if you say Amen to every word that you got the Holy Ghost I recognize truth way before I ever gave my life to God I've said it many times over the pulpit at the age of 10 I knew this message I believed it to be true but I didn't give my heart to God until I was 17 and until that time I was no more going in a Rapture than anybody else was because why I didn't have the life that was going to take me over that's what we're looking for I've got to get my soul sealed and so to you amen that's what's got to happen he says regardless of what anybody else says it'll certainly do it because it's the spirit of God the writer of the Bible please say the writer of the message okay but you got to have the writer not the message only but you gotta have the writer of the message he says the spirit of the word is the holy spirit that's what quickens it the letter killeth the spirit giveth it life see gives the letter just the printed letter life makes it manifest brings it to pass exactly what God promised that's what I want I want the reality of the word taste and see that the Lord is good I've tasted I want to see last quote we're putting the day of Jubilee into context now we've been speaking of redemption for these many services but just to kind of put a punctuation on this an exclamation point and then we'll we'll start up in the next service Lord willing if we want to know what Jubilee is here's what it is this is how the prophet of God said it he said but on the 50th day was the day of Pentecost and the legal owner coming down among them Hallelujah and showed it was no organization that it was a filling of the Holy Ghost listen remember what happened I've said it many times up there they had a denomination starting because Peter said we need to replace Judas and they put a man into Paul's position it was a denomination they started up there but then the Holy Spirit came later and it corrected it didn't it and Peter accepted that correction directly and literally amen but they started a denomination under the best of intentions but that didn't stop God did it God came and he moved he says it was a filling of the Holy Ghost that was God's earnest money to his church that it would not be controlled by organizations and so forth so it would be the earnest of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the power and love of God so many times we want the power what about the love because that love is so different than the power remember because Christ said what says anyone that wants to be great let him be a servant let him humble himself give your life for your friends that's that's what power looks like is the the ability to let yourself I talk to a brother today he said he says it's he says I pray every day that my life will be a stepping stone for somebody else he said and then you know what I found out it's not fun being a stepping stone because guess what people do on Stepping Stones they step we don't like being stepped on but we've got to value that person's soul we've got to value that person's spiritual growth we've got to Value their life their Eternal reward more than we do our ego or our position or our thoughts about ourselves amen if Christ can do it then we ought to be able to do it if we have his power because his power is always manifested by love concern for the other person amen according to the word of God he says amen oh doesn't that just do something to you the legal possessor where was it at it's in the hands of God he's talking about the title deed of redemption remember from Revelation 5. see he couldn't hold it over 50 days catch that God was bound by his own word he couldn't hold that title deed to Redemption longer than 50 days he says you read that over in Leviticus and the law is there it had to go back into the hands of the original owner after 50 years who's the original owner where was it before it went back to God in the hands of Adam that's who had it right Adam had eternal life Adam had Dominion Adam had control and he had full relationship with God the title deed to the to the Earth was in Adam's hand and it went back to the original owner which was God when Adam and Eve fell he says it has to go back to the hands of the original owner after 50 years he says well then after these 50-day years one day meaning like a year and from the day that the crucifixion when they took this kinsman redeemer and slaughtered him on the day the Passover it was in dispute then what where it was supposed to go who was gonna get it he says the church believed up to that time that he was the Kinsmen Redeemer he was a redeemer then what did it do it slaughtered him the enemy did and said they picked up his body and hid it away somewhere and that was all in the open to him what taken place thought we were convinced and then he hasn't come back it's the third day and he hasn't risen up he says but what at the end of the 50th day then you see it couldn't be in dispute any longer instead of them to go on with the old Orthodox stiff cold church God sent the Holy Ghost back and run all the squatters out and then taken it over the power of the Holy Ghost came down and the church received the earnest of its salvation what's the earnest it's a down payment what is it it's the day of Jubilee but it's not the hour of Jubilee it's the start of an entire work and it's a process of redemption to take us not just back to position and not just back to Power and not just all these things but it's to take us back into the very presence of God without any barriers without anything holding us back isn't that our prayer Lord that nothing will be between you and I and guess what Satan's always there to get there listen you can be sinless in that you're not doing anything wrong in your life you're you're Sanctified in everything and you'll still fight a battle because Satan is always there to throw thoughts at you he's there to throw attitudes at you he's there to throw issues with people he's there to to bring up the faults and failures of everyone doesn't matter what you're doing because you've still got a battle that's up here amen this is the greatest battle ever fought and that's where Satan really wants to be so it doesn't matter if you're perfect you're still going to have a battle but we're coming to a place now where there is no battle the battle's over we have the Overcomers reward amen and we're sitting with him in his throne and there's nobody in that throne but us in him why because he and the bride are won I mean it's perfect Unity is what he's restoring us back to him and let's stand together if we would hey man isn't God good doesn't he know how to just do things perfectly it amazes me sometimes how we feel things are dragged out just not going the way we wanted it just seems like it's going on forever fighting fighting nothing's resolved we don't seem to be growing perhaps getting the victory whatever and then God just in a moment just in a moment remember the the greatest things that happened in scripture happened in a moment the work was going on all along and then God just makes it happen in a moment and you you start to realize he was there all the time amen right he's not he's not sleeping amen he's not worried either God's just doing what he's doing and all he's asking us to do is just stay with the word keep pushing keep walking stay in the light feed on the right things that's all he's looking for us to do and then he'll do the work we won't frustrate Grace we're not going to hold him back as long as we try not to do it ourselves but just let him do the perfect work of redemption listen when you're being redeemed you can't contribute anything to the process you know what you can't do when you're when you're restoring something let it move you got to hold it down you got to hold it steady because the work requires such finesse when they're doing a restoration on a whether it's something as small as a watch or a clock are you all the way up to Restoration of a a Ferrari from the 1960s it's about holding it steady and not moving so that they can do the Precision work that they need to that's all God's asking us to do hold still and see the salvation of God amen amen let's push power our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for your goodness Lord Lord we're thankful that you've got a provided way Lord we're thankful that we're free tonight and Lord we have areas where free we have areas perhaps or where we need freeing
