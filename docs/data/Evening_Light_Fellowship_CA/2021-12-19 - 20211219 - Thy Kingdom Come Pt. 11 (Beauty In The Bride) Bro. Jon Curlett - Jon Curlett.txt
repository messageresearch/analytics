person the word is going in one ear and out the other but if you're the seed of god it'll go into your ears but it'll go down to the here of the soul amen brother they're agreeing they understand amen

brother everett see lord each one of these lord we pray your grace and your ministering of health to their bodies we pray lord just be with us now we ask we give ourselves to you in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen god bless you thank you musicians if you're turning the scriptures to isaiah chapter 4 isaiah chapter 4 amen certainly wonderful to have our visitors here it could could could be nice amen amen there we go that's as far as i'm going to go in french i'm going to leave it all with brother gus this morning but just wanted to welcome you in your own language as poorly as i did amen and men certainly want to congratulate brother josh and sister rochelle amen we have a rich history of going long distances to marry amazing women in this church so france is not that far i think i went further and certainly i don't think anybody's gone closer than fifteen hundred or two thousand kilometers to find a wife amongst the young men in this church so and then we like i said it's a he's just following along in the steps of the rest of us i think so and then god bless you both and congratulations amen isaiah chapter 4 verse 1 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem amen may god add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning now as we've mentioned before we're starting to get down to the brass tacks so to speak we're starting to get to where the rubber hits the road uh for our visitors i know that they shared with you some of the things that i've been ministering on so hopefully you're you're a little bit up to speed with what we've been speaking on but we've we're on a series called thy kingdom come and it's it's been inspired by the the prayer that jesus prayed and he told us to pray in this way and he says what thy kingdom come thy will be done and that kingdom that he was talking about was not the kingdom that you see with your eyes he said the the kingdom of god comes without observation amen and it is the working of the holy spirit in our lives is the first kingdom that we will ever see before we come to the real kingdom the kingdom that comes down out of heaven amen so this kingdom of heaven that we're speaking about and this morning i want to speak on beauty in the bride this this kingdom that we're looking for is the evidence of the holy spirit in our lives amen brother brahm said the evidence of the holy spirit is what to accept the word for your day amen but that word is not just accepting it in your head but that word is letting it take effect in your life amen and so we're walking through the scriptures and we spend quite some time speaking to the brothers on on what paul said a brother's life would look like if he has the holy spirit and now we're spending some time with the sisters to get them to look into the scriptures and say i believe the message but does the message live in me amen is the word living in my life so i'm going to speak on beauty and the bride this morning we are not going to be talking about how you dress we've had plenty of teaching through the 50 odd years 60 odd years that brother branham has left on how a woman should dress i look around i don't see any issues with how the women are dressing here so this is not going to be on your outward appearance by any means if you need to look that up then then you can go ahead and do it but in this in this series and this portion we're going to take a couple a couple services on beauty by god's grace this is not about what you look like on the outside the outward is the manifestation of the inward amen but you can look beautiful on the outside even according to what the scripture says and have an ugly inside if we wanted to put it that way so we want to talk about the beauty that is in the bride and this is the beauty that god loves this is the beauty that god express expects and this is the beauty that god appreciates now i've noticed one thing that sometimes we struggle with and that's that we often look in the bible and we know what we are and we read about what we are but we don't look so much at what we are not and you see it many times god gives us a contrast of what he expects and then what the world provides in in an opposite side of things so god has a bride satan's preparing a bride god has a church satan has a church so what often happens is we look at what he says about us and we say okay that's us but what we do is we don't look at the contrasting side which is the world or satan's kingdom to say do i have any of those attributes in my life because oftentimes what we have is we have a portion of our life that is completely godly but we have another portion of our life that is not given over yet to god and it's a door that's closed in our life and if we're not reading the scripture to see what satan's kingdom looks like we don't realize we have a problem because what we're doing is we're reading all the things that he says we should have we say that's great but we are forgetting that there's a contrast and we have to look at the contrast often to check ourselves and see am i fully surrendered to god is the word having full preeminence in my life is the holy spirit working in every aspect of my life amen so we started in isaiah 4 this morning because it's an end time scripture and we'll get to where the prophet confirms that but i want us to turn back to isaiah 3 this morning if you would and hold your bibles will be in isaiah 3 and 4 for quite some time but isaiah 3 verse 12 and this sets the picture for the time that he was talking about here in isaiah 4. it says as for my people isaiah 3 verse 12 as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them oh my people they which lead thee cause thee to air and destroy the way of thy past now this is not a compliment in scripture right this is a rebuke to the people and he's saying that children oppress you if children oppress you if children can dominate you if children can rule over you as an adult that's not a very good thing is it can you imagine if if my young son jensen at six years old was oppressing me how weak would i have to be to allow a child to have power and authority over me amen but he says in the time that we're talking about in isaiah 4 children will oppress you and women will rule over you so this is not meant to be complimentary it is a time when children are having their way with their parents they're leading with temper tantrums they're letting social media and influence take over their parents lives they're pushing agendas onto their parents we see even now that they are wanting children to be allowed to vote at the age of 16. can you imagine a 16 year old voting for anything that would actually benefit the whole of society rather than just themselves almost impossible to find it even adults don't do that these days much less children but it says what children are going to oppress you we see it in the climate change movement and these different things what do we have we have children that are trying to drive agendas and then on the flip side we have women that are trying to drive their agendas now brother branham said it is a woman's world now amen have you read that in the message where he said it is a woman's world women control the world now now you look at the highest levels of business and commerce and that it is still mostly men isn't it but when it comes to the agenda that's being driven it's by women and they are dominating by body and they are dominating by what influence amen they have a physic physical effect over men which is well documented but they also have what they have an agenda that they're driving in any and every way possible to try and take over the world so we're at the time where this is happening today we can look and we can see what's being driven female politicians are driving this we have female empowerment we have females driving in business all these different things we have this strong push to get the women more involved and not just equal to but over authority in the entire world isn't it this is what we see right now but what is the end of it he says there they that are leading you the children oppressing you the women leading or ruling cause thee to air and destroy the way of thy past this leads to destruction this leads to ruin if you're expecting anything else except destruction and ruin in this age with what's going on you're going to be sorely disappointed there is no beautiful thing that comes out of where we are in the world today amen it is on a downhill slide brother branham said it's like the loggers when they skid a log when they take it off of a trailer they put it on skids and once you put it on the skids he says it's off the skids and it's not coming back the log is rolling down off the trailer and there's no stopping it it's going to hit the bottom right and he's saying the same thing for for america at the time and of course it's the world generally right now this the log is off the skids it's rolling downhill and there's no stopping it amen it's just going to get faster and faster and faster but verse 13 says the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people and the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your house he says what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor saith the lord of hosts this isn't a good time they're having here is it moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretch forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet now we're not going to be talking about clothes today but yet isaiah is pointing to the women of that day and he's pointing to clothes as representative of an issue isn't he all right he's talking about how they walk and he says literally you know we say you're walking the wrong way these days you're you're not living the right way he doesn't even say that he says you're not even literally walking the right way he says when you walk you're walking in a way that is not pleasing to god he says you're he says you walk haughtily and that hottie means proud the stretch fork next means that they're arched and proud but it means they're drawing attention to their figure they're elongating their body to draw what the men's eye to them right he says you're what walking with wanton eyes that means lustful eyes you're willingly flirtatious and you're unabashedly checking out the men you are bold with your interest you're walking and mincing walking in a way that draws attention to you seeking to draw the eyes of men and then he says you're wearing anklets and jewelry that make a sound as you walk so you're trying yet again in another way to draw the eyes and attention of men to you right these are not mild women is it these are bold proud unapologetic seeking women amen that he's talking about here brother branham says this he says you married men when you see them women on the street like that you sons of god don't you realize what taken place in the in the first beginning he's taken us all the way back to what the days of the sons of man and the sons of god right after adam and eve when science has made women so pretty in the end or had made women so pretty in the anti-deluvian world until the sons of god took daughters of men not daughters of god and god never did forget it they destroyed the whole thing science and they were prettier you notice the beauty of women lifting in the last days it is a sign of the end god has proved it so use a thinking man's filter and you'll have a holy man's taste he says it'll cost you what he's meaning is otherwise it'll cost you your home it'll cost you your position it'll cost you everything you've got besides that it'll cost you your soul it'll break up your home it may have another man raise your children or another woman raise your children amen this is where we are now isn't it amen and he says what science has made women more beautiful amen you can be augmented you can have bigger things smaller things more things less of things bigger lips beautiful hair eyebrows they can do anything a woman wants no they can do anything a man wants to for that matter but they're focused on the women to make them more beautiful if you look at a woman from 1920 and a woman from today it is not even close it is we're not talking about standards of beauty we're talking about the the actual figure and the structure of the faces and that women are far more beautiful beautiful today than they ever were i i don't think it's i don't think it's debatable right you look at you can walk through the mall and you can see a girl that's as pretty as a as a movie star from 50 years ago it's not at all uncommon is it women are getting much more beautiful amen we're in this time we're in the time that isaiah was talking about isaiah 3 17 says therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion it says he's going to make them bald and the lord will discover their secret parts now this is not a nice thing it says that he's going to cause him to be taken into slavery and suffer the indignity of being stripped naked so that everyone can see them and he he says they wanted the attention now they're going to get it but it's not going to come the way they wanted the attention amen and you can see that there's a consequence to our actions amen if you want to see this in action go look in hollywood go look at your rock and roll stars go look at your amazing singers and they all start out so many of them as pure and innocent right they come in and that's what draws people to them is you get this this beautiful young lady and she hasn't been sullied she just has a beautiful gift to sing or she has a gift to act and what do they turn do they turn her into something that is used by man after man by system after system by business after business and it spits her out at the end and she's lost she's nothing she's destroyed right they've destroyed her they've taken that purity and innocence and they've turned her into a prostitute right for what not for her gain for their gain amen that's what's going to happen so there's a consequence to our actions is what isaiah is saying here and that's this is not just to the sisters but it's the brothers and that the way that you walk you're either going to add value to those that are under your authority or those that are following you or you're going to make them pay a price amen whatever we do something's got to happen and it's either going to cause growth or it's going to cause decay and ruin right so watch out if you're leading in any way make sure you're living the right way make sure you're walking the right right the right way brother brown says this he says he says some woman just made a remark and came in the other day and said show me where the man has walked and let me walk behind him upon the ground and said i'll get well. so a woman came in and said show me where brother branham has walked if i can walk where his footsteps were i believe i'll get well that's the that's the book of acts right when peter walked by his shadow crossed over and what people got well she said i believe that man so much that if you show me where he walked and i can walk the same place i'll be healed right he says now the people believe you like that and you're a representative of christ then what should we do this is not just for the prophet we're talking to the bride now because christ is in the bride he's not in a prophet anymore he's here so he's asking us what should we do we should be very careful because you're not only destroying yourself with wrong you're destroying others who are following you so i know no denomination or nothing to take you to there's only one thing i have my faith in if you believe me follow what i tell you because i believe the bible that's the word of god other things fail but he is the life he is the word so what he's saying is let your life let your actions like if people are following you let them be following the word that's in you and let it not be something that you want or you do or you say but let it be the word from start to finish amen so that they'll end up where you're going which is hopefully heaven amen and eternal life amen with the holy ghost amen the scripture follows up on these women in their judgment it says in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their calls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers it sounds like cars the bonnets cars and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings tablets are in the scripture he's going to take away your tablets the rings and nose jewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins i don't even know what these are but it's the stuff that they use to make themselves beautiful it says the glasses and the fine linens and the hoods and the veils in other words god's taking away everything they thought they used to draw attention to accessorize themselves to make them attractive to everybody that's looking on them he says i'm going to take it all away and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well said hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty i mean this is the end of these women that are walking this way and if we were to be honest this is not a good ending is it it'll be a instead of a sweet smell a stink right instead of a girdle girl's supposed to hold things in it says a rent so there's going to be a tear in it so that whatever you're trying to hold in and hide is going to leak out right if we were to be transparent on this this is the description of a worn out prostitute right she's been used and abused and then thrown away this is where they end up he says and thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war so nobody nobody succeeds under this leadership or under this oppression nobody comes to a good end and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground what a horrible time to be considered a daughter of zion because remember these are the daughters of zion you know the zion always types the bride the daughters that are supposed to be representing the bride are worn out prostitutes that's what that's what isaiah is telling us here amen what a horrible place to be and you see it happening all through here right they started out so perfect and beautiful and then they just the light got less and less and less and now he's building her back up isn't he but then he's got to take her out of it because it's so corrupt here there's no saving that so he just takes a remnant out of it and he takes her to be with him and the rest go into judgment and they end up just like this don't they amen but in all of this there is a real bride there is a real woman there is a beautiful woman there is a seed that comes out amen but this one has the right family lineage she has the right teaching she has everything that she needs and yet she has twisted her way out of everything that god has found beautiful brother braham says this he says i've got a prophecy laying at home one of these days i'm going to read it and you wonder why i rap at women the way i do 30 years ago i got thus saith the lord 30 years ago when i entered the ministry he told me that the strain of women would come so immortal and imputed in the last days they'd be the most defiled thing on the earth that's what we just read in isaiah the most defiled thing what right she started it at the beginning and satan uses her at the end amen i've told you sisters you have a target on your back amen you have a target on your back because he's trying to twist you out of the way that is called holy and look what is happening look down through the years it said she'll continue to strip herself and said there'll just be a little tiny group of the very elected that's predestinated we'll escape that amen when that vision come that worried me i thought women i turned back over in the bible to isaiah i believe the fourth chapter and it said the branch that escaped from the daughters of zion in that day will be beautiful to the lord now notice how he phrases it the daughters of a zion that escape amen this is not people that can stay in it's people that escape they get out of it they're the lucky ones we would say today right we'd say we're blessed they're lucky to get out they escaped when everybody else died in this amen so we bring this now into what isaiah 4 where we just started the service and it says in that day what day the day we just read when women were walking wrong looking wrong acting wrong being wrong and ultimately paying a price for it and everybody paid the price for their poor actions right in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach brother gus just so you know i didn't touch the water in there so if you need a drink you can drink it i'm fighting what samuel has so i'm i'm a little a little down tonight today here all right so i want to jump into what brother braham says because i take this right from him i didn't come up with this brother braddon walks us right through this scripture and tells us exactly what's going on he says well brother it's pretty near that bad now what a falling away has happened to our country let me say this my dear christian friends let me say this with godly respects to everyone you people here who studied history were right on the same road that every fine nation through the ages has fell on demoralizing going right back and it's got to a place where it seems like we don't care for our women that's a rebuke to the men and then he says or our women don't care for our set themselves and that's a rebuke to the women so us men have a job and the women have a job and he's saying neither one of you is doing your job right that's what it is if a woman would keep herself right the man would have to go right and that's not taking up for the men but i know that's the truth yes sir but what is it it's just a horrible condition and it's existing and it's according to the scripture the bible said it would be that way he says so how can we have a revival how can we have a revival if we're in this condition right we are living in the days that god spoke would come and were living in the last days so he said we're living in the days of isaiah 4 and we're living in the last days he says it's one in the same day regardless of what we try to think about it god's word says that we are predestinated that's right and what god has called will come to god and what god doesn't call will not come to god god calls they refuse and he calls and they refuse amen god is not willing that any should perish now i don't say god condemns anybody he's not willing that they all should that any should perish but all might come to repentance but in order to be god he knew in the beginning they weren't going to come yet he gave them a chance but they wouldn't come this is what led these women right women are type of churches this is what led them to this condition is he called and they didn't he called and they didn't he called and they didn't and then they went away of their own choosing amen he says just think here as i was answering the scripture seven women grab a hold of one man in the first world war the second world war i've got a newspaper clipping at home out of the newspaper you read it yourself said what's happened to the morals of our american women two out of every three soldiers was divorced by their wives that went overseas in the first six months two out of three was divorced those women just took off and run out why is it you'll un if you'll understand friends it's the spirit of time catch that it's a spirit we're dealing with here right it's an attitude we're dealing with it's an influence that we're dealing with amen it doesn't get on churches it gets on people it gets on people and then it comes into the churches and then they form a church around that spirit or that attitude amen there is no such thing as a church there's only a such thing as people and then they form a church they form a a congregation they form an assembly of some sort and then it has a spirit of the thing that pulled them all together in the first place amen he says we've got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here so he says there's a spirit out there and there's a spirit in here you better be with the one that's in here right there's a spirit that we've got to be getting into in this time he says you go to a dance hall you've got to get in the spirit of dancing or they won't dance you go to the church you've got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship why otherwise it's just what it's a false pretense it's false fellowship it's false worship it's a form it's not something that's really coming out of you the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days and god's promised that these things will be here and that's what we've got he promised it and it's here now that he promised the bad but he also promised the good didn't he we're in the last days and men and women are sitting asleep and don't realize it we're at the last days sure seven women are hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread and wear our own clothes only let us be called by your name to take away our reproach brother you don't even have to get away from the united states there's only one place i've ever been in my life that i thought was any worse than the streets and things that i've been in our own nation and we're not getting any better do you know where that was paris france why because that's where hollywood started amen it's a wonder that we have believers coming out of there but guess what we have believers out of every tongue and nation out of every hell hole amen are we any different now no we're no different it's a miracle that we come out of canada anybody could come out of the united states anywhere because why it's all felt the spirit of the ages across the earth and he's got to pull us all out of it amen right we're no different right he can pull a believer out of california just as he says he can pull one out of out of newfoundland amen why because the spirit's the same across all of it right he says we're constantly constantly getting worse and worse all the time and remember i'm speaking in the name of the lord he's speaking as a prophet now this is not just preaching he's saying in the name of the lord this is thus saith the lord we will continue to grow worse and there's only one hope at all and that's in christ jesus no matter what you do amen we're here now and he says it's going to get worse so prepare to fight harder because it's going to get stronger and stronger and stronger and the pull from the world the attempt to influence our brothers and sisters is going to get stronger and stronger he says the only way you'll get out is if you get in the spirit of the last age amen and that is the spirit for the believer and what is it is a spirit of separation it is a spirit of truth it is a spirit of an absolute amen it is a spirit of the resurrection it is a spirit of the rapture it is a spirit that is everything all in right everything is given over to the to that spirit and that is the holy spirit in our lives amen amen i want to go back to that scripture in isaiah 4 1 because it highlights an attitude and it highlights his spirit and then so long we look at our actions and we fix the actions and we forget that there's an attitude or spirit behind the actions that we really need to address right we've got to look inward for that we don't just fix the outward right what did the scripture call us why did sepulchers right that's what he called the pharisees and sadducees you're like white at sepulchers you're dead on the inside but the outside is beautiful that's not what we want we don't want to be beautiful on the outside i'd rather an honest person that doesn't look so good but god is working on them they're honest enough to recognize it in admitted amen amen so this is when we look here in isaiah 4 1 this is the anti-bride attitude this is satan's bride's attitude that we see here amen yes amen what we're not reading just about what the bride is but we want to catch what she isn't and this is what she isn't so let's pay attention it says in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our approach now as a man that might not seem so bad she's going to come in she's going to take my name she's going to marry me and she's going to work for herself and she's going to bring her own clothes right but that's an anti-bride attitude i want you to catch that right why the woman will provide her own food now let's put on her spiritual hats right now right she says i'm going to choose what and how i eat and when i eat right now that's great until you realize that god has provided a food for you to eat in this age amen there is a manner that we've heard about in the last few services there's a revealed word so you don't get to choose what you eat your husband christ is supposed to choose it for you so when she comes in she's saying i'm going to feed you and he's saying but i'm supposed to feed you because i know what you need but she said no i'll do that and then she says what i'll provide my own clothes i'll bring my own apparel now the problem is is that he's got something he wants her to put on and she says that don't worry about me i'll look the way i want i'll dress the way i want what you think doesn't matter i'm going to dress whatever way i want but you got to remember there's something that he wants the bride to put on amen so what is the man getting out of all this you'll see this is a one-sided offer she says i want your name i'll provide for myself we see no offer of a marriage here she just says i want something from you and it's your name i want you to take away my stigma of not being married i don't want people to to know i'm single so i want your name give me your name and i don't need anything else from you not only that i won't give you anything right she's wanting one thing just the name and she says i won't require anything else from you but i also won't give you anything either that doesn't sound like a marriage does it right so this is both selfish and desperate at the same time it is entirely to her benefit but she's desperate to take away that stigma amen she wants the title without the relationship amen she'll take her freedom and her self-sufficient lifestyle but she just wants the name of her husband at the same time she doesn't want to give up anything but she wants to gain what he has that's what it is amen she's not looking for love she's not looking for intimacy she's not looking for family all she's wanting is to not be embarrassed amen that's not exactly the foundation for a marriage is it i don't want to be embarrassed not only that but listen she thinks she has everything she needs except the name she thinks she's got it all provided for herself and this is the trap that we're going to look at amen because what this is an end time prophecy remember our prophet says isaiah 4 is today and he's speaking in the name of the lord and so where do we see that revelation 3 verse 14 says unto the church of the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou art cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich increase with goods and have need of nothing she doesn't need a husband to provide for hers this is the church right why she has it all and no it's not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked now why is she coming to him if she has it all right the outward expression is i've got it all but the inward side says i need a husband's name to take away my reproach so he's looking to the n word he says i know in there you're still miserable right i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that's godly characters we've said many times amen but this woman this church doesn't want to change this these women of isaiah 4 they don't want to change it all they want to stay exactly the same but take his name right what is it she doesn't want to come under word authority right he says i counseled thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed he's got something he wants her to put on her clothes won't do no matter how beautiful they are how good they are how well made they are the beauty the richness of the materials it doesn't matter he says i've got a white dress that you've got to put on and if you don't put it on then you can't be mine right wrong food wrong character wrong dress he says why that the shame that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou may see that you can see that you're miserable naked that you don't have what you think you have right it's the eyes opening remember brother branham said there's people sitting in church and they're asleep and they don't know it their eyes are closed he wants you to wake up why the bridegroom's coming the bridegroom's coming get yourself ready according to the word amen he says what you need my clothes you need my robe it's the only way to get into this he says as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and remain repent in the church age book the prophet said the zeal of this age is to do what repent why because it's a restoration age and restoration implies you're not where you should be that you're not what you're supposed to be so that means we start wrong and we become right there's no shame in repentance amen we ought to be repenting every day as he opens our eyes as he shows in our lives that there is a need we ought to say i'm sorry lord i maybe i knew it maybe i didn't know it but i'm sorry change me why that's why that's the zeal of this ages i'm sorry restore me back to what you told me i was going to be and then even our pastor has preached on it it's not just your soul it's not just your character but it's your body it's your marriage it's your relationship it's the way you walk it's the way you talk it's all being restored back to a bright image amen hallelujah amen what this walk with christ in this age has to involve repentance if we haven't repented something's wrong something is wrong because you haven't seen yourself through the eyes of the word and a change has to be made in your life amen what is it this is the end time church right here and what is it is they've come in and they've said we want the name so they put on the name of christ but they don't do anything else that he says do they right everybody calls themselves a christian these days that's why he has to call them bride is because christian has lost its meaning now right why because everybody seven women seven churches they've all come in seven churches seven women they all took his name but there was only one that gets his name amen and it's the same one that comes out right here amen same church here is right here amen seven women take his name and they're all same we're christ i've got the name of jesus christ but they don't do what he says amen what is it they're not intimate with them they're not under the headship of christ they come in and say we'll provide for ourselves but we're not going to take anything you tell or you give amen they are self-sufficient women self-sufficient churches amen amen now jesus confirms this himself in matthew 7 he says many will say to me in that day lord lord have not we prophesied in thy name they have the name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will profess unto you i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity in my name in my name they came in it doesn't say he gave them the name it says they took the name he didn't give him the name he entered no relationship this is not a marriage because he says i never knew you there was never intimacy between me and you right you came in and said i'm identified with him and you ran out and did your thing but he says i never knew you there was no life that followed there was no relationship that followed that conversation amen he doesn't say they didn't prophesy he doesn't say they didn't cast out devils he didn't say they hadn't done many wonderful works why because in the name of jesus christ combined with faith you can do just about anything right why because god responds to faith god responds to faith it has nothing to do with do you have the holy ghost or not have the holy ghost if you believe all things are possible amen but there is a special portion for the bride because she is elected to do all of those things the greater works amen but you have people that can absolutely lay hands on somebody and heal them it's a gift of healing it's it's a gift it's without repentance it's outside of repentance amen but what they didn't get to a relationship they got to a place where they did all these works and he says depart from me you that work iniquity iniquity means you knew what to do and you didn't do it right and that's where they got trapped was that he told them what to do and they ignored it and they went through their own way and the proof is in the pudding as we say over here right and what is it there were no births there was no bursts out of those churches there's no bursts out of those denominations right there's no spiritual burst is what we're talking about right what there's no spiritual intimacy it's a it's a relationship of appearances only amen it's a farce it's a sham it's a marriage of convenience for the church itself and christ is not in any part of that brother brahm says this he says and when we take our pledge to christ if we don't become part of him like a woman ought to become part of a man and a man part of the woman then we're artificial christians we're not really you're just you're really not married to that woman you might be loyal if you don't love your husband and him 60 or 70 years old and you don't love him as good as you did at the beginning then you're really just raising his children wow something for the old folks do you love him as much as you did wow 60 or 70 years ago that's a long marriage that's the way the churches are too many today we're just taking the name of the christian church pretending to be the bride folks don't put this outside the message don't put this outside the message if you're going to hear anything today don't put it outside of the message what we are is we are identified with the message and we have no relationship with christ you've got to meet the the messenger the real messenger you got to you got to meet the king that sent the message amen because that's what eliezer came to do was introduce us to the one that sent the message he didn't have us stand here and just pour over the message he wanted to get us to the man that sent the message amen why because the message is a person it's not it's not something written down it's not something on tapes it's a living breathing organism it is god himself given to us amen he says that's the way the churches are today we're just taking the name of the christian church pretending to be the bride it's artificial we're not connected with christ in any way we're like an artificial tooth an artificial arm an artificial eye see it's something that's artificial if we're just putting it on well you can't put on christianity you've got to be connected with it and then a church that's just artificial called the church of christ well them children then are not in there that's born of that same organization they're not christ's children there are denominational children and not children of christ if the woman isn't connected with the man in trueness then it isn't her husband it's just a man she's taken a vow to live with and she took a wrong vow she pledged to love him she said she loved him and she didn't do it all the time the man is deceived but there's one thing sure friends we're not going to deceive christ he knows his own amen now jesus gives us even more details on these women these churches i mean we're talking to the sisters but we look at the type to the churches and then we bring it back to the sisters amen again we're talking about an attitude we're talking about a spirit that's what we're looking for here matthew 24 jesus said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now we take great hope in that because it says if it were possible but it's not possible amen we're not going to be fooled we're not going to be overcome by the spirit if we're the true bride amen he says behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there where the eagles be gathered together so he says the identification of the anti-bride is they'll say go here go there go to this ministry go to this church go in the desert go in the secret chamber come to our place sit with our group he says that is never my identity that is never where you're going to find christ the anointed one he says but where will you find him where the carcass is there where the eagles be gathered together what is it around the fresh killed word for your day that's the identification of the bride spirit amen and it's not just gathered around amen as john in the book of revelation you can't just go up and say give me the book you've got to eat it right you've got to partake of it it's got to become a part of you and it's got to push out and cause growth and strength and you to develop into what you are supposed to be amen that's got to have an effect of the word in your life amen is the kingdom of heaven being manifested in you because if it's not something's wrong something's wrong with what you're eating or something's wrong with what you're not eating amen amen do you believe doctrine or do you eat doctrine right do you apply it or do you just believe it is it just in your head or is it in your life and in your heart amen amen there is a real deal there is a real bride and he points to her and he says she's going to be gathered around the fresh kill of the word amen and there is a real bridegroom right we've got a satanic bridegroom and we've got christ the bridegroom we've got satan's church and we've got christ church that called out elected ones amen and there is a real union and it produces real results and we see it in isaiah 4 verse 2 it says in that day so in that day where everything turns into a prostitute and everything goes into desolation and ruin he says in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel so in the midst of all of these messed up churches all these messed up people out of it comes something that god calls beautiful and glorious and it is his bride remember in that quote brother brown says if it ever puts forth another branch and it will she will do the greater works amen this is the beautiful branch that he's talking about here out of all of that comes something that god calls beautiful and glorious amen it says the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely that means it's going to be attractive it's going to be desirable to somebody amen so that's this time remember as much as we're looking at the the contrast the negative now he's showing the positive and he says there's got to be something good coming out of your lives folks church there's got to be something beautiful and glorious and what is it it's manifesting time right the fruits are coming out and people are starting to see do you really believe and do you really have what you believe or are you just what a make-believe christian amen what is it he says they're what the ones that escaped remember brother brahm says the ones that got away the ones that escaped he says it here the ones that escaped it's somebody that got away the lucky ones the called out ones amen it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion that means there's not many there's a few left he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion all this filth washed away because we've got to be we've got to be spotless right we've got to be spotless so it's all got to be washed away and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning now how does he wash us how does he wash us paul said what by the washing of water by the word right it's not by actions it's not by actions it's by the washing of water of the word amen and that brings us to a place where we are spotless pure and white amen and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion mount zion is always the bride right so on every dwelling place where are the dwelling places in mount zion one two three four five six seven eight nine ten twenty four three these are the dwelling places in mount zion you are the tabernacle of god right right he says on every one of us will be and upon her assemblies so when we all come together what do we have a church we have a multi-member bride body so on every one of us individually and upon every congregation a cloud and a smoke by day and a shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense we are his glory so he says on every one of us individually and on every one of us as we gather together there is a spirit of what protection leadership and provision what the light shows us the way it guides us it protects us from the sun it shades us right he gives us everything we have need of he says on every one of us there's going to be that spirit and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day from the heart from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain this is a time of storm and rain isn't it the earth is what groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of god and what it's not just physical it's not just the climate it's in our lives it's in our careers it's in our families it's in our marriages it's in every part there's a rain in a storm that's coming he says then i'll protect you from all of it what brother branham takes us all the way through this i don't need to say my own words because he walks us right through it he says isaiah 4 5. now listen he's talking of the coming of the lord how that women will be so immoral he said seven women listen let's just read it look here and in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach that's the end time where we're living now marriage divorce prostitution and whatever he says in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely of them that escaped of israel he says how you escaped all that damnation can you say praise the lord that you've escaped the damnation amen that he has woken you up that he's opened your eyes that you're in a pickle it's not a phrase we probably use in french that you're in us you're in a place of trouble right that you're in a time of war that you're caught unless he can get you out amen glory he says and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion he that's a remnant in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem wherein the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of zion he says remember that's always the bride see and shall have purified the blood of jerusalem that's the remnant of the jews plus the bride and in the midst of with the spirit of judgment and fire he says this there's always god's judgment when he makes his final judgment he calls you he justifies you and brings you to redemption then his judgment breaks forth upon you and the holy ghost and fire cleanses away the sin and then you're his amen there's got to be what a spirit of judgment and fire upon you not judgment to condemn you but judgment to put away that which was already paid for at calvary it's been judged you are no longer associated with it it is divorced from you and on top of it he puts his holy spirit fire on top of you and cleanses away all of it he says then you're his now you always were his but he says when you're cleaned by the holy spirit when the holy spirit falls on you that's when you are identified as his amen why because his life is now in you that is the consummation of the marriage amen that's proof that he has been intimate with you that he has revealed himself to you in a way that he doesn't reveal to just anybody amen the same thing he does to the earth when he purges it with fire and by the spirit of burning he says now look listen are you ready amen amen so there's a beauty that he's calling us to and that beauty is going to include holy ghost spirit and it's going to bring forth what fire that cleanses away the filth of the world amen amen those sisters the world is going to look at you and guess what they're not going to be attracted to the beauty that you offer no no no they're looking for what sensuality they're looking for skin they're looking for exaggeration they're looking for that outward expression of beauty what you have is never going to draw the world right it can't it can't because what you have the same beauty of christ and then you've got the beauty that attracts him to you right so we see three elements in this we read that the bride is beautiful and glorious to god to god not to everyone else but to god she is excellent and comely to the onlooker that is of the same mind right so you're not even going to attract maybe the churches out there because they're not of the same mind right but ye have the mind of christ right if they don't have the mind of christ then they're not going to be attracted to your beauty are they and he says what in verse 3 it brings holiness there is a holiness that is beautiful to god amen now that's quite a standard for us to match up to beautiful glorious excellent comely and holy and that's for everyone that's not just sisters that's brothers and sisters alike because we are all a member of the bride of christ but then he brings it down to the sisters directly amen amen amen we want to read in first chronicles 16 29 it says give unto the lord the glory do unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness amen worship god in the beauty of holiness what is the beauty of holiness it is obedience to the word of god and that's why i say this is not only for the sisters this is for the brothers amen we're talking about the universal bride of christ here not just the women now listen this is an amazing one psalm 50 verse 2 it says out of zion out of the bride the perfection of beauty god has shined you are what the perfection of beauty you are the perfection of god's beauty now that's again to all of us as the members of the bride of christ but you sisters you are the perfection of the beauty because remember when we read in the last service where it said what the women are a reflection of the church so if you want to see where the church is look at the women and if they're doing right if they're living right if they've got the right attitude they got the right spirit then what god's in that church and if they don't then something's wrong in the church amen it's that simple it's that simple and then he hasn't made it difficult for us amen so god's shining through what a reflective bride so that they can see the same beauty that he had two thousand years ago right two thousand years ago it said for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he had no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him it's like i said to our sisters if you're looking to wow the world with your beauty you are beautiful don't think you're not beautiful but you're not beautiful in the way that they think you should be beautiful amen they want you to show more right show all your assets and hide nothing right and we're saying hide a lot and show very little right and let whatever scene let it be christ amen what they're trying to do the big wow factor and you're trying to do not the opposite of that amen that's satan's pride that's trying to do that amen remember we're speaking about beauty and the bride so her beauty is a reflection of his and here it says there is no form or comeliness no beauty that looking on him we should desire him i mean that's the way our sisters are supposed to be right it's not something that draws the world first peter 3 as we start to close likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if that if any obey not the word they also may be with they also may without the words be won by the conversation of the wives now there's two things here one conversation is the life not just the words it's the life you live it says let them be one by your life not just by your words amen it says while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear now the amplifies it says when they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves together with your reverence for your husband you are to feel for him all that reverence includes including to respect defer to and revere him to honor esteem appreciate prize and in the human sense to adore him that is to admire praise be devoted to deeply love and enjoy your husband and all the brothers said hallelujah praise the lord right and all the sisters said please god no right right because why he's not always i'm not always worthy of adoration and praise in fact i would say the majority of the time i'm not right not worthy of of the looking up to that you're asked to do right if you're a wife right but remember when we read that word wives previously that is not just to the wives that are married it says to those that are any women whether they are unmarried married or widowed so every woman is supposed to have the attitude that he's talking about here right nobody gets away right but that's a beautiful thing right we all have the same standard right we all have the same standard uh one sister doesn't get to act different from another sister one brother doesn't get that different from another brother we're all held to the same standard amen he says now this in verse three whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold and of putting on of apparel now if i look around this church right now i see gold i see plated hair i can't tell you if your clothes are expensive or not everyone it seems like takes a scripture and they say don't braid your hair don't wear gold or jewelry or don't wear fancy clothes that's not what peter said here it's not what he's saying he's saying you're not allowed to do it he says your adornment is not supposed to be that he's saying your outside appearance is not what's supposed to be your adornment right because what it is is you're putting something on the outside to try and make it look like you're something he says your adornment can't be an outward thing right that adornment means ornament decoration accessorizing or beautification so he's saying that's not what makes you beautiful in other words he didn't say you can't wear it he said that's not what's going to make you beautiful this is not what makes you godly this is not what makes you holy this is not what attracts people to you is that it may attract it but he says this is not what's beautiful to god he says in verse 4 but rather what let it let your adornment let your beautiful accessories be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price now guess what if you want your hair done beautifully if you want gold if you want beautiful clothes it's going to cost you a lot it's of great value isn't it and he says the thing that god finds of great value is when you put on a meek and a quiet spirit that's the thing that god finds beautiful and that's the thing that god finds of great value but the trap for our sisters is that they'll go to verse 3 and they'll change the way they look and say that makes me beautiful but he didn't say change your clothes he said change your heart amen right he said change your attitude change get a character change because that's what's most valuable to me the outside i don't i'm not too worried too much about whether or not you have rich clothes or poor clothes lots of jewelry not much jewelry we're supposed to be modest men and women alike we're not supposed to be flashy right that's not the way it's supposed to be but he says what god's looking for is what a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god great price for after this manner in the old time the women also who trusted in god adorn themselves being in subjection under their own husbands now i want you to catch what it says there it says a meek and quiet spirit is a sign that a woman trusts god right why because she hasn't doesn't have to fight for what she needs or even what she deserves she is able to let go she is able to trust and let god do what he promised he would do right that's why she's able to trust and have that meek and quiet spirit is because she knows that god is on her side and he's the one that's going to make it right the next verse confirms this it says even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement and then sarah is one of the one that's mentioned in the chapter of faith isn't it right she's a she's a sister of faith she's a woman of faith that second half says and you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you now look at sarah what was she unnerved about she has a promise to bring forth life and nothing's happening right and the funny thing is is god forgets everything she ever did because in the end she believed right but she had all sorts of faults and failures in there didn't she she tried to have somebody else have the baby for her it only bought problems she went in with her husband on these little schemes to try and protect her in these different things she was not full of faith but in the end she had the faith that was required to bring forth the promise amen that's what our trust is is that through our faults and failures amen if we can let ourselves just trust and relax at some point now god has a chance to do it they say that when women that can have children once they just once they realize i can't have children and they stop trying to have children that's when they have children did you know that not always it's not a rule but when they relax when the stress goes away when they go back to just having a relationship with their husband when they go back to just living the way they were supposed to be living in the first place magically a baby appears why because the stress was what was holding back the fruit right it clamped down on their body and it could not bring a manifestation right they couldn't conceive because of the stress but when they let go when they trusted when they relaxed when they didn't try and bring it forth all of a sudden babies show up and they go in they get in virtual fertilization they have three kids because that's the way it usually works out then they go home relax and they have another two or three because their system is finally relaxed right it's an amazing thing this is the effect of the holy spirit in the life of a sister is that meek and quiet spirit amen so often what we're doing is we're planning for god to fail we're planning for men to fail and we're not letting the word do what it says it would do right he's saying you got to trust and that's where the meekness and quietness comes from is when you trust it's not in the quality of your husband it's not in the quality of us it will never be the quality of the man you're married to or the father you're sitting under it'll be because you trust the god that put him in your life in the first place amen it's a beautiful thing when we can let go amen now all of the mild-natured sisters are saying hallelujah inside and all of the feisty ones are saying this isn't fair right it's true it's true because guess what i was talking to another couple earlier and he was saying my wife's very feisty i've got a feisty wife right right a number of us have feisty wives some of us have very meek and mild wives right and what we do is we look at that and we say well they're naturally gifted to to answer the scripture right but it says what every one of us has a battle right and guess what some of us are going to fight one way and some of us are going to fight another and here's the thing he doesn't say you had to start with a meek and quiet spirit he says you had to finish right this is a process if you think if us men think we're ready to go in a rapture and our lives are perfect and our leadership's perfect and our marriages are perfect then we're deluded aren't we we're deluded why because it's a process god is growing us into it and it's the same thing for our sisters amen you may start feisty but guess what god will grow you got to mature you right god will bring you through it god will put you through a marriage where you're going to be put through the ringer right maybe he'll leave you single where i'll put you through the ringer remember god's got a way of bringing you to what he wants you to be amen but every one of us has to do it but although you know if you're meek and mild the problem is you're going to face other struggles because you'll be so meek and mild that you won't do anything right you'll struggle to get up and go because you're so meek and mild and in such subjection or in under such authority in a way that you think you can't do anything and that's further from the truth as well right so every there's two sides to every coin and we're not going to go into it today for the sake of time and for our poor translator but we'll see what it looks like because god's got to work on you one way or another so whether you've got a great starting attitude or you don't have a great starting attitude god's going to be working no matter what because there's something that's got to change in you amen we'll finish with this final quote he says now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her women listen to this a woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat because that's where they end up so often right and that's poor teaching that's poor teaching to the brothers or they just want it that is not she is not your doormat brother brown said she is your queen because why we are his queen are we a doormat to christ does christ treat us like a doormat no so why are we treating women like a doormat you can't do it she is the next best thing to salvation [Music] that's hardly a doormat in my mind right she is your other half so you're saying you have a bad half and a good half right do you suppress half you don't want to do that she's not a doormat that is command sorry no real mail makes a female a doormat no real mail there you go brothers there's your standard are you a real male if you've got your wife or your daughters as doormats there's a problem amen no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail wow tough sisters let me read it again she will want she'll want shall want it's a desire that's a holy ghost desire there is no way you want to be put under my leadership or your husband's leadership or your father's leadership or your pastor's leadership because we are all faulty but he says you will want it you will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he is perverted powerful words this is why a woman cannot wear that which pertain it to a man or cut her hair because what hair is a sign that you're under authority when you cut it it's rebellion she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself and we saw what happened when she perverts herself it leads to ruined and destruction to those that are around her and when a woman invades the pulpit which is commanded she must not do she shows what spirit she is of being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church are in her wow that's the great the great the seeds of the great are in you if you what have a dominating spirit he says though she may deny this ever so vehemently i'm mild i'm meek let your action show it amen not your words he says but when it comes to the word let god be true and every man's word a lie amen amen god bless you let's stand together if you would amen hopefully brother gus was able to keep up with me i had every i'm a fast speaker at the best of times and when you get going it's hard to stop but he was doing pretty good with brother gerald so i think he held up with me amen and then these are strong words sisters brothers equally a challenge amen amen like i said if you're not like this naturally welcome to the club right i'm not everything that god called us to be i'm not everything he wants me to be yet amen we've all got to change we've all got to grow god's got to work on us sometimes he does it one-on-one sometimes he uses the body amen as iron sharpeneth iron as the scripture says amen will rub off the high spots and the rough spots on each other over time he meant but each one of us god is molding and shaping into what a part of that perfect image of that bride i've been listening to the masterpiece this week and you know what he says we are the last masterpiece the bride is the last masterpiece she was struck off of his side and he's putting her back in and that completes the perfect image of god and that's what he's looking for amen that's the picture we're trying to paint we did it with the brothers and we're doing it with the sisters we don't just want to tell you what you're not we want to tell you what you are we want to show you how the word looks when it lives inside of you amen we want to take it off the doctrine and off the pages of the message and off the pages of your bible and put it into a living life that other people can see so they can see christ before you ever open up your your mouth amen before you ever say something amen amen like i said before we don't want to just have truth we want to be truth and maybe we want truth to be a person we want to be a personality not just words that we say amen let's close our eyes heavenly father lord is always such a challenge this morning lord for men and women alike and lord may we just humble ourselves before your word now we pray lord may you just come in lord as we heard that spirit of of fire and judgment lord not to judge
