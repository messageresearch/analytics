[33:14] amen Lord bless you say Amen
[33:18] I'll try to be as brief as I can but to
[33:21] welcome my brother Jonathan curl it to
[33:24] Newfoundland amen you might not feel
[33:27] like he's surrounded by the new friend
[33:29] had this fear but amen he is in
[33:33] Newfoundland this is amazing absolutely
[33:35] amazing brother sister where we are when
[33:38] it comes to science but again where are
[33:40] we when it comes to the spiritual and
[33:42] the Holy Ghost as I mentioned I believe
[33:45] a couple of services ago the prophet of
[33:46] God said that that it was God he said
[33:49] that that for Dane the invention of the
[33:52] tapes and the tape recorders east of
[33:55] what for ISA for the recording of this
[33:57] message this endtime message well
[33:59] brother how far ahead are we now we've
[34:03] gone beyond the tape recorders
[34:04] especially those tape recorders I
[34:06] remember them as I said III maybe I
[34:09] think I still got one in the basement
[34:10] here one or two and and we've had a lot
[34:14] of those doors though so the
[34:17] old-fashioned tapes of the message all
[34:20] the big reel to reels oh yeah we had to
[34:23] put one of them on it's not a nun but I
[34:25] put on a cassette not put on a CD no no
[34:28] no no put on a large tape and you and
[34:31] you watch that tape roll and roll and
[34:33] roll and roll and the Prophet bring the
[34:36] message but now look where we are now a
[34:39] man we've gone beyond cassette tapes
[34:42] we've gone beyond CDs you know to the
[34:44] place aware I've mentioned to our
[34:46] brother Matthew the other night I said
[34:47] this is amazing I said our brother I
[34:50] said in British Columbia I said can
[34:52] preach to us here in Newfoundland and I
[34:55] said not just his voice but I said we're
[34:57] going to see him a man yes exactly and
[35:00] knowing that he can look and see us and
[35:02] hear our response by the grace of
[35:05] Almighty God our brother I believe that
[35:08] that's also a sign of how close we are
[35:11] to eternity amen
[35:13] when we consider what's going on
[35:14] scientifically brother be on your guard
[35:16] because we're about to break into
[35:19] eternity science is doing it and the
[35:22] problem of God is even I lighted that
[35:23] many years ago I believe
[35:25] concerning science
[35:26] breaking into eternity or trying to
[35:28] break into eternity any any reference so
[35:30] that the the those that went into space
[35:33] some years ago but the first ones that
[35:36] went into space and they and they asked
[35:38] him about and they said well it was
[35:39] amazing and he said but he said we
[35:41] didn't see God we saw this saw distance
[35:44] all that but we didn't see God but oh
[35:47] yeah you know God saw them a man so
[35:50] brothers sisters just think how far that
[35:53] we have advanced scientifically when
[35:55] again technology when it comes to
[35:57] recording the message and preaching the
[35:59] message all praise the Lord
[36:00] the no wonder the Bible says and you
[36:03] know that it's going to be the gospel is
[36:05] coming preach through the whole world a
[36:07] million that's the truth now not the
[36:09] message but the gospel the revelation of
[36:12] Jesus Christ the prophet of God said no
[36:14] so we want we won't be able to get this
[36:16] message to everyone but he said just to
[36:18] the elect
[36:18] he said just to the right and to get her
[36:21] out and get her in to eternity but he
[36:24] said the get the gospel is going to be
[36:25] preached to the whole world the
[36:27] revelation of Jesus Christ as our Lord
[36:29] and Savior but they won't get the
[36:31] revelation that you and I are getting
[36:32] concerning the resurrection and the
[36:34] rapture amen and brothers so we as if
[36:38] science is blending into eternity what
[36:40] are we doing a man and this is just as
[36:43] this is just an indication brother in
[36:45] the natural and indication of what's
[36:47] going on in the spiritual
[36:48] just think as we partake of this tonight
[36:52] with our brother Jonathan so far away
[36:54] and not only that brother the brother
[36:56] ministry to us but it all praise the
[36:59] Lord you talk about the east meeting the
[37:01] West a man praise the name of the Lord
[37:04] the power of God also highlighted those
[37:07] things of the east meeting the West the
[37:09] Sun that rises in these is gonna set in
[37:11] the West a man and God is going to give
[37:14] us the revelation of the Sun in the West
[37:17] a man through our brother Jonathan so
[37:20] god bless our brother Jonathan as he
[37:22] comes to Minister us to us tonight we
[37:23] pray the grace of God to be with him and
[37:26] and and to anoint him to bring forth a
[37:29] man what we need to hear he did it last
[37:33] night and we thank God for the word but
[37:35] I just want to remind you that
[37:39] I have notes here concerning two sermons
[37:42] that our brother preached in November of
[37:46] 2019 a man it was November the 10th our
[37:50] brother ministered and on a Sunday and
[37:53] again on November the 9th he ministered
[37:55] on a Saturday hey man so 9 and 10
[37:58] Saturday and Sunday well now he's
[38:01] ministering Friday and Saturday so god
[38:03] bless our brother Jonathan and glad
[38:05] again to hear his ministry and to hear
[38:07] the Lord amen speaking to our brother to
[38:10] provide us with what we need amen and
[38:13] what do we need we need the word Amen by
[38:16] the grace of God for the faith by the
[38:19] grace it is by grace through faith that
[38:22] were saved amen so we praise the grace
[38:24] of God that they're going to give us the
[38:26] faith we need tonight to move us on and
[38:29] God bless our brother Jonathan and
[38:30] anoint him a man with the revelation of
[38:33] the word a man and brother it's not just
[38:37] just what it was years ago but brother
[38:40] this is this is this is not ordained to
[38:42] get us to talk about justification
[38:44] sanctification or the baptism of the
[38:47] Holy Ghost
[38:47] no it's pushing its arm forward further
[38:50] into the revelation of resurrection and
[38:53] the rapture the change you talk about
[38:56] walking with God and brother if there's
[38:58] ever an hour
[38:59] we need the revelation of overcomers as
[39:01] our brother was preaching last night
[39:03] we need the revelation tonight there
[39:06] were lot overcomers not just overcome
[39:09] yes the flesh yes but overcome the the
[39:11] world the flesh and the devil
[39:14] amen so that we're going to go from time
[39:16] to eternity and pray the grace of God
[39:18] that by the word that our brother
[39:21] Jonathan will bring tonight that we
[39:23] don't get it'll increase our faith and
[39:25] give us a greater faith to press on a
[39:27] man by the grace of God and again as I
[39:32] had this notes from the previous
[39:35] messages he preached here in November
[39:37] and also the notes that he preached left
[39:39] from the message he preached last night
[39:41] and thank the Lord for it and just to
[39:43] remind our brother that it takes us
[39:45] deeper into the word oh yeah moving us
[39:49] on by the grace of God
[39:51] to say that as a result of our brothers
[39:54] sermon last night it led me to three
[39:56] three messages that the president that
[39:58] the prophet of God has preached a man
[40:01] just think of that
[40:02] and I said Lord this is tremendous and I
[40:04] said that you're you're laying it on
[40:05] that brother's heart to preach him to
[40:07] minister
[40:08] I said supposed to take us out further
[40:10] into the word a man and the three
[40:12] messages that the Lord laid on my heart
[40:14] and the Lord led me to after our brother
[40:17] was finished preaching was the oncoming
[40:20] storm a man that the Prophet preached in
[40:23] 19 and 60 and then another one was
[40:25] humble thyself that he preached in 1963
[40:29] and tremendous in August 1963 the
[40:34] Prophet preached how can I overcome a

[41:20] him on the phone and he felt so low and
[41:23] food so discouraged and so depressed and
[41:26] so I pray for him on the phone and he
[41:31] called me the next morning eight o'clock
[41:33] in the morning and he said thank you
[41:35] thank you thank your brother it was
[41:37] wonderful he said thank you

[41:42] feeling wonderful now he's to thank the
[41:44] Lord so he said I said well brother

[42:03] felt to do
[42:04] and again of course he's looking after
[42:06] in the cemetery that we have down there

[42:11] and of course he's got he's got a
[42:13] in the cemetery that he that he goes and
[42:16] sits on and he said I went to the
[42:19] cemetery brother and he said and he said

[45:31] warm welcome
[45:32] then by tteyuu want of you to turn your
[45:34] Bibles to Luke chapter 4 we're just
[45:36] going to continue on the theme of the
[45:37] overcomer tonight I'm going to preach on
[45:39] the overcomers answer Luke chapter form
[45:42] we'll start at verse 1 just wanted to
[45:45] thank each one of you for the the
[45:46] responses from yesterday I got a lot of
[45:48] texts and email from brother Gerald just
[45:50] thanking me and saying everything went
[45:52] well so certainly appreciate brother
[45:54] Matt doing the work to get the
[45:55] technology to work through and certainly
[45:58] glad that each one of you was touched by
[46:00] the word just trusting we'll continue
[46:02] the same tonight amen it's also Jensen's
[46:05] birthday today's he's 5 years old so we
[46:07] pushed his his birthday back a little
[46:10] bit so I can preach this afternoon but
[46:11] we'll have a special time for him but
[46:13] certainly want to thank the Lord for the
[46:15] blessing he's been to us into the family
[46:17] amen we're gonna do a bit of preaching
[46:19] tonight a little bit of teaching a
[46:20] little bit of practical application so
[46:22] just hang in there I've got a lot on my
[46:24] plate I was telling brother mark last
[46:26] night I said I don't get to preach very
[46:29] often so there's a lot in there and it
[46:30] tends to come out really quickly
[46:32] so forgive me for my fast start
[46:34] yesterday hopefully I slowed down a bit
[46:36] Blanca held up the slow down sign and so
[46:39] I'm just trusting I can relax a bit
[46:41] today and just go through it nice and
[46:42] easy everyone's in the comfort of their
[46:44] homes we should be able to handle it
[46:45] without any issue so amen Luke chapter 4
[46:48] verse 1 it says in Jesus being full of
[46:51] the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and
[46:53] was led by the spirit into the
[46:55] wilderness being forty days tempted of
[46:57] the devil and in those days he did eat
[46:59] nothing and when they were ended he
[47:01] afterward hunger amen let's just bow our
[47:03] heads
[47:04] Heavenly Father Lord as we once again
[47:06] open your word Lord we pray that you
[47:08] administer to the hearts and souls of
[47:10] the people that are listening and
[47:11] watching Heavenly Father Lord may you
[47:13] just touch our lives Lord you know that
[47:15] I'm speaking according to what you've
[47:17] led me to do but just praying that you
[47:18] would help it define rest Lord fertile
[47:21] ground in the lives of the hearers Lord
[47:23] Jesus touches each one helped me to just
[47:25] settle down get out of the way Lord it's
[47:27] not easy to preach this way but just
[47:29] praying that you would have your perfect
[47:30] way and will in your
[47:31] Oh Lord Ross close to you Lord may we
[47:33] just feel and and Lord know that your
[47:35] presence is near us
[47:37] in your name we ask and pray amen like I
[47:40] said I'm hoping to maybe bring this into
[47:41] a bit of a practical side today but
[47:43] we'll start with a bit of teaching and
[47:45] we'll work our way through amen but it's
[47:47] certainly a time of adversity today and
[47:49] when we see what's going on with this
[47:51] Cova 19 virus and we see the economic
[47:54] fallout of this and we see the way the
[47:56] world is going politically we see the
[47:58] worry the world is going religiously
[48:00] it's just a mess and I believe the
[48:02] closer we get to the to the rapture the
[48:04] closer we get to that resurrection time
[48:06] then we're going to see more and more
[48:08] adversity we're going to see more and
[48:09] more trials things are going to be more
[48:11] and more difficult for us amen and yet
[48:13] the closer we get to God the more
[48:15] apparent the attacks of Satan are going
[48:17] to be for us and we've read that quote
[48:18] last night that said that overcoming was
[48:21] what when we recognized Satan and every
[48:23] one of his tricks but also that we
[48:25] recognize that he that is in us is
[48:27] greater than he that's attacking us amen
[48:29] and so we know Satan has only one goal
[48:32] and that's to try and keep us from
[48:34] fulfilling the purpose that we are here
[48:36] on the earth for and that's to what step
[48:39] into our position in Christ and fully
[48:41] Express the word for our day amen and
[48:43] that's the thing he fears most on this
[48:45] earth I think is that blood-bought bride
[48:47] when she steps into her place he know
[48:49] she's gonna go and when that's done then
[48:51] the wrath of God comes down and we know
[48:53] that the countdown starts ticking for
[48:55] Satan they meant he knows the book of
[48:56] Revelation he knows he's only got a
[48:58] little bit of time then and then he
[49:00] comes down and what his rage because he
[49:02] knows that his end is near so all he's
[49:04] trying to do his last hope that he has
[49:06] here is to stop that bride from taking
[49:08] her place amen we know that the first
[49:10] Adam didn't fall but the first deed did
[49:12] and because of that now we had Christ
[49:14] come the second Adam and he didn't fall
[49:16] and now it's the second Eve's turn and
[49:18] she can't fall this time amen and thank
[49:20] God we know that the overcomer the bride
[49:22] of this age will not fall and so Satan
[49:24] is still doing everything he can because
[49:27] it's his only thing to hold back the
[49:28] wrath of God and final judgment Allah
[49:30] made men so we're going to talk tonight
[49:32] about the overcomers answer and it
[49:34] starts with the the temptation of Jesus
[49:37] in the wilderness and this is a
[49:38] well-known story I know and believe me
[49:40] this was a temptation for Jesus this was
[49:42] something that he had to
[49:44] go through and and we see how he was led
[49:46] into the wilderness here and as he goes
[49:49] into this temptation we don't want to
[49:50] get the wrong thought about it
[49:51] temptation because so often we say it's
[49:54] wrong to be tempted but we know that
[49:56] when you're in a body of flesh that
[49:58] you're gonna be tempted as in Satan's
[50:00] gonna come over and who's gonna drop
[50:01] things in he's gonna put things in front
[50:03] of you he's going to put opportunity
[50:04] tuna tees in front of you and as we said
[50:07] it's only the inner man that is saved
[50:09] it's only ender man that's redeemable
[50:11] the outer man and those five senses on
[50:13] the outside and then the imagination
[50:15] that they're not redeemed they're not
[50:16] they're not the Holy Spirit does not
[50:19] dwell in them but rather it overcomes
[50:21] them amen and so those things when those
[50:24] things are rise up and they say hey I
[50:25] like that they show that desire that's
[50:28] not wrong for us right that's just that
[50:30] part of our body doing what it's meant
[50:32] to do amen it's in a sinful condition
[50:33] it's in an unredeemed condition but the
[50:36] believers started to beat themselves up
[50:37] when they faced this and the simple fact
[50:39] is is that it's not wrong to be tempted
[50:41] but rather how you react to that what
[50:43] you do with it is what determines
[50:45] whether or not you're in the right or
[50:47] wrong amen there's the same that says
[50:49] you can't stop birds from flying
[50:50] overhead but you can stop them from
[50:52] building a nest and that's what the
[50:53] believer does is when these temptations
[50:55] come as he pushes past them it says I
[50:57] don't want any part of that and moves on
[50:59] and the Holy Spirit keeps them out of
[51:01] his life and that's when he wins the
[51:02] victory amen you can't stop the
[51:04] opportunity from being presented to you
[51:05] but you can stop it from sticking around
[51:08] and you possibly getting tripped up and
[51:10] then the Holy Spirit just says hey none
[51:11] of that here and let's move on amen
[51:14] so let's start to read again in verse 1
[51:16] it says and Jesus being full of the Holy
[51:18] Ghost returned from Jordan and was led
[51:21] by the spirit into the wilderness and
[51:23] one thing we want to grasp here really
[51:24] quickly is that this is not a trial of
[51:27] Satan's making it says that Jesus was
[51:29] led into the wilderness by the Holy
[51:31] Spirit in another place in the scripture
[51:33] woman it's talking about storm it
[51:36] doesn't say that the spirit led him it
[51:38] says that the spirit drove him into the
[51:40] wilderness and then he was compelled he
[51:41] was forced he didn't have a choice here
[51:44] but rather the Holy Spirit pushes him
[51:46] into a place of desolation a place of
[51:49] emptiness a place that can't sustain him
[51:51] and says you've got to go here now and
[51:53] so Satan doesn't set this up but rather
[51:55] Satan takes the offer
[51:57] any of this trial to now come in and
[52:00] start to tempt Jesus amen
[52:01] so that's a lesson for us to learn is
[52:03] when you're going through a tough time
[52:04] it's so easy to say Satan's put this in
[52:07] front of me Satan is the one that's
[52:08] caused this amen thinking of brother
[52:10] Matt there and just lost a job it's easy
[52:12] to say Satan took the job away Satan
[52:14] brought this cove at 19 our way and
[52:16] killed our economy in these different
[52:18] things but I believe so often for a
[52:20] believer the tough times are not
[52:22] orchestrated by Satan but rather Satan
[52:24] takes advantage of those tough times to
[52:26] try and get us in a moment of weakness
[52:28] amen but we know that the Son of God the
[52:30] footsteps of a righteous man are ordered
[52:32] of the Lord and he delights in his way
[52:34] we want to rest that just because it's a
[52:36] tough time does not mean Satan's working
[52:38] but genuinely it means God's working and
[52:40] Satan's just trying to piggyback in that
[52:42] tough time to trip us up they men moving
[52:45] on to verse 2 just to say if your
[52:48] conscience is clear in a trial and God
[52:49] hasn't shown you anything then you can
[52:51] rest assured that he's with you in it
[52:53] and he has a purpose amen he's going to
[52:54] use it for your good amen verse 2 says
[52:57] been 40 days tempted of the devil and in
[53:00] those days he did eat nothing and when
[53:02] they were ended he afterward hunger I
[53:04] think that's probably the greatest
[53:05] understatement the Bible is that Jesus
[53:07] was hungry after for 40 days without
[53:09] food amen i remember when blanca did a
[53:11] water fast for 17 days and by the end
[53:13] she could barely walk or stand or go up
[53:16] the stairs or anything I can't imagine
[53:18] what it was like for Jesus in 40 days
[53:20] and it says throughout the 40 days the
[53:23] devil was tempting him the whole time so
[53:24] he's getting progressively and
[53:25] progressively physically weaker and
[53:27] Satan's applying the pressure more and
[53:29] more throughout at amen
[53:30] but Satan is like that he doesn't want
[53:33] to get you when you're in your prime
[53:34] you'll notice that Satan doesn't start
[53:36] right after you've ever have a revival
[53:37] or something like that he gives you a
[53:39] little bit of time and then what does he
[53:41] do he starts to come in on the cracks
[53:42] and and nibble around the edges to try
[53:44] and get you but generally when Satan's
[53:46] coming for you it's when you're in a
[53:48] moment of weakness when things aren't
[53:49] going so good
[53:50] amen he never comes in when the
[53:52] preaching is great and the song service
[53:53] was perfect and you've got great
[53:55] fellowship and tons of money in the bank
[53:56] and your job is working so well but
[53:59] rather he comes win when things get
[54:00] tough when the marriage isn't going so
[54:02] well maybe the preacher isn't doing so
[54:04] well maybe the song leader is really
[54:06] annoying you because he sings the same
[54:07] songs over and over again
[54:09] but he comes in and then he starts to do
[54:10] what nibble around at the edges and get
[54:12] you to kind of get a little bit unhappy
[54:14] hearing a little bit dissatisfied with
[54:16] this and a little bit envious of that
[54:17] and dad to dr. Don pretty soon what he's
[54:20] got a weakness and he starts to tear
[54:22] away at the victory you had and all of a
[54:24] sudden you're down in the valley again
[54:25] they meant verse three the Devil attacks
[54:29] Jesus here and he said unto him if thou
[54:31] be the Son of God command this stone
[54:34] that it be made bread and then the first
[54:37] thing I want you to notice here is that
[54:38] Satan is wanting to get Jesus to react
[54:40] to him Satan wants to drive the
[54:43] conversation Satan has a plan of attack
[54:46] here and he's wanting to make this thing
[54:48] go the way that he has in his head
[54:49] because he set traps along the way and
[54:52] so if he can get Jesus to respond to him
[54:54] as he's given Jesus this challenged then
[54:57] he knows that he can beat Jesus so
[54:59] that's what he wants us to do is Satan
[55:00] is always trying to get us to respond to
[55:02] the situation rather than get us to
[55:05] respond to the word him and he wants us
[55:07] to be reactive rather than resting amen
[55:10] so Satan goes right for the jugular here
[55:12] and what's the first thing he does he
[55:13] challenges Jesus on his position he
[55:16] challenges Jesus deity he says look if
[55:18] you're the Son of God then do something
[55:20] and not only that but he's tricky
[55:22] because he's what he's doing is he's
[55:23] tying Jesus deity to Satan's challenge
[55:27] and saying you're only the Son of God if
[55:29] you do what I say and that's gonna be a
[55:32] trap every time when Satan comes against
[55:34] us and he's not gonna come as as he did
[55:36] with Jesus in in personal form so to
[55:38] speak but he's gonna have somebody come
[55:40] your way whether it's a co-worker or
[55:42] somebody you run into in in business or
[55:45] these different things maybe just out
[55:46] and about maybe it's somebody online
[55:48] these days amen you can run into so many
[55:50] people if you're on Facebook and these
[55:51] different things and all of a sudden
[55:52] somebody'll throw something in your face
[55:55] and challenge you as a believer right
[55:57] and what if you answer according to the
[55:59] way that they've challenged you then
[56:01] you're gonna follow into a trap every
[56:03] time you're gonna get sucked into their
[56:04] world
[56:04] rather than standing on the word amen so
[56:07] what sames doing here is he sets his own
[56:09] criteria to determine what makes him the
[56:12] Son of God and he says what turn these
[56:14] stones into bread he says Jesus you're a
[56:17] tough situation let's use your gift to
[56:19] make you do a little more
[56:21] you know you're hungry you know you're
[56:23] weak you know you have the capability to
[56:25] create if you're the Son of God so let's
[56:27] turn these stones into bread amen
[56:29] now does Jesus have anything to prove to
[56:31] Satan is there anything that should make
[56:34] Jesus answer Satan the way he does and
[56:36] no he doesn't have to we don't have to
[56:39] answer Satan's challenge when he comes
[56:41] to us picking a fight in that way but
[56:44] brother branham gives us an insight into
[56:46] why Jesus doesn't ignore Satan because
[56:48] he could have he could have just said
[56:49] you know Satan go away go away just
[56:51] leave me alone I'm out here for some
[56:52] some time alone but he doesn't he
[56:54] answers him brother branham gives us a
[56:57] reason as to why he did it and how he
[56:59] did it and the message Satan's Eden he
[57:02] says Jesus didn't clown for him speaking
[57:03] of Satan he says he never did God is not
[57:06] a clown he don't have to answer anything
[57:08] that Satan asks jesus said it is written
[57:11] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[57:13] every word that proceeds out of the
[57:15] mouth of God see he didn't have to clown
[57:17] from him he didn't have to make bread
[57:19] you ever notice how people challenge
[57:22] Christians these days because we want to
[57:23] take our spiritual thinking caps and put
[57:25] them on now because we're not talking
[57:27] about Jesus we want to talk about the
[57:28] Bride of Christ as well and how Satan
[57:31] comes against Jesus is how he's going to
[57:33] come against the bride so what do they
[57:35] do when the world comes against us when
[57:37] Satan comes against us of people under
[57:39] his influence and what not what does he
[57:40] do he sets his own criteria for what
[57:43] makes us Christians and if we don't give
[57:45] them the answer they want that makes us
[57:46] a hypocrite and if we don't give them
[57:48] the other answer that they want then
[57:50] we're unloving and then we're against
[57:52] so-and-so and such-and-such and whatnot
[57:54] and they get us to answer according to
[57:56] their kind Amen but rather we need to
[57:58] answer according to God's thinking we
[58:00] need to answer in the way that His Word
[58:02] tells us to answer and Jesus gives us
[58:05] the example of of how this is right
[58:08] we've got so many unworldly or worldly
[58:10] people out there trying to tell us what
[58:12] it means to be a Christian and they set
[58:14] these criteria and they think they know
[58:16] what it means and the the common thing
[58:18] you'll hear is well don't you love them
[58:19] or God is love in these different things
[58:21] and they set all sorts of responses that
[58:24] we're supposed to have him ways to live
[58:25] that would make us a Christian in their
[58:28] eyes but we don't answer this Satan as
[58:31] to whether or not we're a Christian but
[58:32] rather our Christianity lies in the one
[58:34] that gives us the power
[58:35] in the first place which is Christ
[58:36] through his word Amen so we want to be
[58:39] able to answer according to the word as
[58:41] opposed to what they want us to amen but
[58:44] those people so often feel qualified to
[58:46] tell us whether or not we're Christians
[58:48] and if we get sucked into that argument
[58:50] we're gonna lose every time because you
[58:51] can't prove to somebody if they don't
[58:53] already believe you're Christian chances
[58:55] are they're not going to if you continue
[58:56] to work with them continue to answer
[58:58] them according to their their ideas amen
[59:01] but Jesus first challenges not just to
[59:04] turn turn stones into bread but rather
[59:06] his first challenges on Jesus position
[59:08] why because he's scared of Jesus deity
[59:11] because if Jesus is the Son of God then
[59:13] Satan knows that this is the one that's
[59:15] going to take the world from him this is
[59:17] the lamb that's going to take that book
[59:19] at the end and is going to take what
[59:21] that abstract title deed and have whole
[59:23] proper the whole property of Satan
[59:26] everything that he squatted on down on
[59:28] this earth will belong to Jesus so he's
[59:30] trying to get him to trip up because if
[59:31] he can trip him up then he knows that he
[59:33] can hold on to that world amen and
[59:35] sayings kind of smarted that way but
[59:37] he's also a little bit dumb because what
[59:39] he's attacking shows what he fears most
[59:41] so if he's attacking you you have to say
[59:44] what is it about Satan's attack that
[59:46] he's worried about here what is it that
[59:48] he's poking at at me that bothers him
[59:50] because that's what we need to rise up
[59:52] then and and and address the situation
[59:55] amen if he's going after you in your
[59:57] sickness then say that means he's scared
[59:59] of the healing that I have a minute
[1:00:01] pieces attacking your integrity it's
[1:00:03] because he's worried that your integrity
[1:00:05] is what holds and gives you influence
[1:00:07] over people in these different things so
[1:00:09] he's coming in and where he attacks is
[1:00:11] what he's scared of the most amen and
[1:00:13] that's what he does with Jesus amen
[1:00:16] Satan doesn't go around telling
[1:00:17] unbelievers that they're not children of
[1:00:19] God we know that right he doesn't go
[1:00:21] around attacking his own people rather
[1:00:23] he's going to come after those that
[1:00:25] aren't of his kingdom why because he's
[1:00:27] wants to bring them out from under their
[1:00:28] salvation and bring them into his
[1:00:30] kingdom so that he can attack even more
[1:00:32] Christians amen Matthew 12 verse 25 says
[1:00:35] and jesus knew their thoughts and said
[1:00:36] unto them every Kingdom divided against
[1:00:39] itself is brought to desolation in every
[1:00:41] city or house divided against itself
[1:00:43] shall not stand they were accusing Jesus
[1:00:45] of being of Satan if you remember
[1:00:47] he says if I did these things of Satan
[1:00:49] and I'm fighting against my own Kingdom
[1:00:51] so Satan's coming against you of Satan's
[1:00:53] challenging you it's a really good sign
[1:00:55] that you're a child of God amen because
[1:00:57] he's not going after his own people he's
[1:00:59] only going after those that haven't
[1:01:00] given their worship to him amen
[1:01:03] why does he first attack Jesus position
[1:01:06] again that's the thing he's most scared
[1:01:08] of because that has dominion Jesus deity
[1:01:10] has dominion over Satan and so when he
[1:01:13] attacks our position why is it because
[1:01:15] our position as the body of Christ has
[1:01:17] dominion over Satan in exactly the same
[1:01:20] way amen he is under our feet each and
[1:01:22] every one of us as sons and daughters of
[1:01:24] God and if he can get us out from under
[1:01:26] our position than what he knows that he
[1:01:29] has a chance to take us out but the
[1:01:31] minute we recognize our position we have
[1:01:33] full control and authority over him amen
[1:01:36] everything falls into place when we
[1:01:38] recognize who we are in the message
[1:01:40] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:01:41] brother Branham says now what are you
[1:01:43] going to do when you get all that group
[1:01:45] together where the revelation is
[1:01:46] perfectly in harmony and God expressing
[1:01:49] it through his word by the same actions
[1:01:51] the same things he did making the word
[1:01:53] manifest oh if the church only knew its
[1:01:56] position they says it will one day then
[1:01:59] the rapture will go when it knows what
[1:02:02] it is they men when the Bride of Christ
[1:02:03] when the true church knows what it is
[1:02:06] and we know that's what the tokens for
[1:02:08] here today the Holy Spirit is quickening
[1:02:10] us daily to live out what our position
[1:02:13] is in Christ until one day we step out
[1:02:15] of this body and into a glorious body to
[1:02:17] be with him amen moving on to verse four
[1:02:20] it says and jesus answered him saying it
[1:02:22] is written that man shall not live by
[1:02:25] bread alone but by every word of God we
[1:02:27] know Jesus is quoting Deuteronomy eight
[1:02:29] here and I'll turn to it where I've got
[1:02:31] it in my notes you don't have to turn
[1:02:32] unless you want to definitely hold your
[1:02:34] place in Luke because we'll be coming
[1:02:35] back to it but in Deuteronomy 8 verse 2
[1:02:38] it says and thou shalt remember all the
[1:02:40] way which the LORD thy God led thee
[1:02:42] these forty years in the wilderness now
[1:02:44] notice here the continuity of Scripture
[1:02:46] there's 40 years in the wilderness
[1:02:47] there's 40 years of temptation improving
[1:02:50] for Jesus we see Moses was in the
[1:02:52] wilderness 40 years we see Moses was on
[1:02:54] the
[1:02:55] for 40 days to receive the law from God
[1:02:58] amen we see these different things and
[1:03:00] we know then that Jesus is when he gets
[1:03:03] through these 40 days then there's a
[1:03:04] reward that comes after it amen there's
[1:03:06] a promise there's a fulfillment of
[1:03:08] ministry that's going to come after that
[1:03:10] because after Israel finished those 40
[1:03:12] years what did they do they stepped into
[1:03:13] the Promised Land amen under the
[1:03:15] leadership of Joshua which would be a
[1:03:16] type of the Holy Spirit so what is this
[1:03:20] time of temptation about then it says
[1:03:22] it's what remember all the way which the
[1:03:25] LORD thy God led thee these forty years
[1:03:27] in the wilderness to do what and we'll
[1:03:29] start to read in verse 2 but it's about
[1:03:31] proving that's what I said about
[1:03:32] temptation is that this is not just
[1:03:34] about did you feel like you wanted to do
[1:03:37] this instead of that and did you feel
[1:03:38] right or wrong but rather this is about
[1:03:41] showing what you value most what's at
[1:03:43] the very core of your being and when we
[1:03:45] strip everything away what is it that
[1:03:47] holds us then what comes out of us and
[1:03:49] when you're completely tired when you're
[1:03:51] completely worn out when you're
[1:03:53] completely hungry when you have no
[1:03:54] strength left to fight whatever comes
[1:03:56] out of you then is what you are and
[1:03:58] that's what this time of temptation and
[1:04:00] trial is for Jesus it's proving that he
[1:04:02] has what it takes to what step into that
[1:04:04] full son of man ministry on the earth
[1:04:06] amen and so what is it we'll see in our
[1:04:09] lives right we're gonna have to prove
[1:04:11] what we're at when times are tough are
[1:04:13] you gonna choose family over your career
[1:04:15] amen are you going to choose money over
[1:04:17] fellowship are you gonna choose
[1:04:18] integrity over compromise are you gonna
[1:04:20] choose easy living over honest work amen
[1:04:25] verse 2 in Deuteronomy 8 says what was
[1:04:28] the purpose of wandering in the
[1:04:30] wilderness it says to Humble thee right
[1:04:33] proving that what if you're a child of
[1:04:35] God it doesn't give you a right to be
[1:04:36] arrogant further Bram said an arrogant
[1:04:38] spirit is never of God and when you see
[1:04:40] arrogance coming out it means that God's
[1:04:43] moved away and that person's personality
[1:04:44] is taking over amen
[1:04:46] we want to keep ourselves humble he says
[1:04:48] the humble thee and to prove thee amen
[1:04:52] everything that's on the inside is going
[1:04:53] to be manifested on the outside
[1:04:54] eventually and in this case it took 40
[1:04:56] years for the unbelievers to die and for
[1:04:59] the believers to say we're ready to move
[1:05:01] in but it proved because as soon as they
[1:05:03] came to that River Jordan they all
[1:05:04] crossed over and what did they do they
[1:05:06] started taking all
[1:05:07] or the land amen testing is what's going
[1:05:10] to prove what's ingrained in you and
[1:05:11] that's really where I want to find
[1:05:13] myself is not just that I had when I
[1:05:15] have time to think and process and and
[1:05:18] kind of coin a perfect response to a
[1:05:21] situation but rather when something hits
[1:05:23] you hard and fast the first thing that
[1:05:25] instinctively comes out of your mind is
[1:05:27] what the Word of God amen
[1:05:29] there's a little funny story I I hurt my
[1:05:32] ankle last weekend real bad I've been
[1:05:34] sending the interesting pictures of the
[1:05:36] many color changes my foots going
[1:05:37] through throughout the week to Joe and a
[1:05:40] couple different others but I've been
[1:05:43] the gyms are closed and I like to
[1:05:44] workout and I haven't been able to so I
[1:05:46] have some of these exercise bands that I
[1:05:48] use and I was using them and Jensen came
[1:05:50] down in the room and he said can I try
[1:05:53] and to hold them in place you have to
[1:05:55] put them under your feet and then you
[1:05:56] can stretch them to you know do the
[1:05:58] exercises and whatnot so I set him up
[1:06:01] and I stepped on it with my bad foot
[1:06:03] with my bad ankle and he pulled it as
[1:06:06] high as he could and then he let it go
[1:06:09] right into my bad foot now as my good
[1:06:14] friend Mark Esser would say you know in
[1:06:16] situations like that typically bad words
[1:06:18] would start to form in the back of your
[1:06:20] brain and hopefully never make it out of
[1:06:21] your mouth but God's grace that didn't
[1:06:23] happen with me because what happened is
[1:06:25] it didn't actually strike my foot first
[1:06:27] rather it hit the ground and then just
[1:06:28] kind of lightly hit it but the more to
[1:06:31] make the point that if he would have hit
[1:06:33] my foot the thing that should have come
[1:06:35] out is maybe ouch or yoyoyo or you know
[1:06:39] something like that but it what you're
[1:06:41] hoping for is that it would not be the
[1:06:42] words that nobody wants to be caught
[1:06:44] saying as a believer Amen why is it
[1:06:46] because what's ingrained in us is what
[1:06:48] would come out and so you're trusting in
[1:06:50] a situation like that you wouldn't curse
[1:06:52] whether it's in your mind or out that
[1:06:54] loud god forbid amen but this time is to
[1:06:57] know what the scripture says to prove ly
[1:06:59] to know what was in thine heart it says
[1:07:02] what whether that would keep his
[1:07:03] Commandments or no amen whether what was
[1:07:06] his commandment his commandment wasn't
[1:07:08] just the the ten laws that were written
[1:07:10] on stone amen but his commandment was
[1:07:12] that I've given you a land of milk
[1:07:14] honey and I want you to go possess it
[1:07:16] amen we don't just want to have
[1:07:18] obedience to the to the requirements of
[1:07:20] God for holiness in a sanctified life
[1:07:22] and whatnot but rather we want to have
[1:07:24] full obedience which what takes us into
[1:07:26] the Promised Land amen
[1:07:28] so Jesus knows his place I mean if
[1:07:31] there's one person that knew the
[1:07:32] scriptures and knew his position in it
[1:07:34] it was Jesus at the age of twelve years
[1:07:36] old he's in the temple and what's he
[1:07:38] doing he's teaching the scribes and
[1:07:40] Pharisees and at that time when when his
[1:07:42] parents leave without him and then come
[1:07:44] back and his mother says your father and
[1:07:46] I were worried he says hey that's not my
[1:07:49] dad you know who my dad is
[1:07:51] right he knew who he was at the age of
[1:07:53] twelve so by this time when he's you
[1:07:55] know thirty years old he knows that he
[1:07:57] is the son of God he knows he's the land
[1:07:59] the Holy Spirit's come down in the form
[1:08:02] of a dove and and vindicated him that
[1:08:03] way
[1:08:04] so Jesus knows all these things and he's
[1:08:07] now looking at this scripture that
[1:08:08] Satan's misusing and understanding where
[1:08:11] Satan's coming from and now he's able to
[1:08:13] correctly answer the challenge that
[1:08:15] Satan gives to him amen he knows he's
[1:08:18] got to be humble he knows he's got to be
[1:08:19] proven amen his innermost desires have
[1:08:21] to be shown clearly so his answer has to
[1:08:24] reflect that humility and his innermost
[1:08:26] desire right and his innermost desire
[1:08:28] has to be what does the Holy Spirit have
[1:08:30] for me in this trial amen not to get out
[1:08:33] of the trial but what is it I'm supposed
[1:08:34] to get out of this that's his purpose
[1:08:36] amen verse three Deuteronomy 8 says any
[1:08:39] humble thee and suffer thee to hunger
[1:08:41] amen notice that God allowed them to
[1:08:43] hunger first and then he brought the
[1:08:45] manna afterwards he supernaturally met
[1:08:47] the need after the hunger we have to
[1:08:50] hunger sometimes we have to thirst we
[1:08:51] have to go without we have to have a
[1:08:53] lack of things sometimes so that it'll
[1:08:55] just heighten that desire amen it'll
[1:08:58] it'll get us calling for more of God and
[1:09:00] then he comes on the scene in an even
[1:09:02] more supernatural way amen so he
[1:09:04] suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[1:09:06] with manna which thou knewest not
[1:09:08] neither did thy fathers know that he
[1:09:10] might make thee know that man does not
[1:09:12] live by bread only but by every word
[1:09:14] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[1:09:16] Lord that man lived amen so Jesus has no
[1:09:20] worry about the fact that he's hungry
[1:09:22] why because when he goes back to the
[1:09:23] scripture thus saith the scripture that
[1:09:25] Satan is using here and
[1:09:27] team back to Jesus understands that God
[1:09:30] provides at the end of this no matter
[1:09:32] what so he says I don't need to provide
[1:09:33] food God's live at me into the trial
[1:09:35] that means God will provide sustenance
[1:09:37] in the trial and after the trial I'm not
[1:09:39] going to die in the trial and then after
[1:09:41] the trial I'm gonna get what he promised
[1:09:43] amen amen he knows there's heavenly
[1:09:46] manna waiting for him after this trial
[1:09:48] brother Branham gives this beautiful
[1:09:50] explanation of what Jesus did here from
[1:09:51] the very start and then how he kind of
[1:09:53] goes through this and I didn't know that
[1:09:55] most of you have heard this quote but I
[1:09:57] wanted to read it to kind of set a tone
[1:09:59] as we go through the service this
[1:10:00] evening amen in the message what is that
[1:10:03] in your hand he said Jesus defeated
[1:10:05] Satan without using any divine gift that
[1:10:08] he had why showing that the weakest of
[1:10:11] Christians can defeat Satan on the word
[1:10:14] of God amen praise the Lord what a
[1:10:16] statement that the weakest of Christians
[1:10:18] can defeat Satan on the word of God so
[1:10:20] that means every single one of us that
[1:10:22] is a professing believer that's been
[1:10:24] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:25] Christ and filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:10:27] no matter how weak we are how we feel we
[1:10:30] are it means that every single one of us
[1:10:32] can debate it to feed him when we
[1:10:34] correctly apply the word of God in every
[1:10:36] situation brother Branham takes us even
[1:10:39] further and and in the church ages and
[1:10:42] he says so when a spirit born spirit
[1:10:45] fill man in faith takes that word into
[1:10:47] his heart and places it upon his lips
[1:10:50] why that is the same as deity speaking
[1:10:54] every mountain has to go Satan cannot
[1:10:57] stand before that man he doesn't say
[1:10:59] stand before that word he says stand
[1:11:01] before that man why because the unity of
[1:11:03] the word you and Christ together makes
[1:11:05] it all the same thing he says when you
[1:11:07] put that on your lips then that makes
[1:11:09] you deity speaking a man we spoke of
[1:11:12] that yesterday when we said you have to
[1:11:14] take it as Christ did where he thought
[1:11:15] it not robbery to be equal with God
[1:11:17] brother Branham says when you take the
[1:11:19] word on your lips with that same
[1:11:21] anointing and that same inspiration that
[1:11:23] is deity speaking out of each and every
[1:11:25] one of us say men so if you're looking
[1:11:28] for a good reason to know your Bible
[1:11:29] that's one really good one right there
[1:11:32] is that you have to be able to correctly
[1:11:33] apply it and be inspired by the Holy
[1:11:36] Spirit amen so you can respond to Satan
[1:11:39] every time and every temptation
[1:11:41] with it is written just as Jesus did
[1:11:42] brother Bram says and you will defeat
[1:11:44] Satan every single time so it's not
[1:11:46] about your argument it's not about your
[1:11:48] idea it's not about the logical strength
[1:11:51] of your response a men as the world
[1:11:52] would look at it but rather if you stays
[1:11:55] just strictly strictly with the Word of
[1:11:58] God as it is written and that is your
[1:12:00] response you know then that when it's
[1:12:02] purity it will answer and it will stand
[1:12:04] for you and it will defeat Satan every
[1:12:06] time Amen brother branham that said this
[1:12:09] and this this to me was just such an
[1:12:11] encouragement because as much as we'd
[1:12:13] like to think it we have times where we
[1:12:16] don't have very much faith isn't that
[1:12:17] right we have times where we feel weak
[1:12:20] you know well I won't say that maybe in
[1:12:22] confidence but speaking with with
[1:12:24] someone that's been going through a real
[1:12:25] trial lately and and a great man of God
[1:12:28] a great minister and and he spoke of how
[1:12:31] weak he feels at times and yet in at all
[1:12:35] you know being strengthened by God but
[1:12:37] we have these times no matter how much
[1:12:39] we preach over a pulpit no matter how
[1:12:41] big our prayer life is and how much we
[1:12:43] read our Bible there still comes times
[1:12:45] where something hits us so hard that it
[1:12:47] sets us back and we're just sitting at
[1:12:49] the bottom of the valley wondering how
[1:12:51] we got there amen listen to what brother
[1:12:53] Graham said and the message believe us
[1:12:54] now this he says everybody wouldn't have
[1:12:57] gifts amen gifts of faith gifts of
[1:12:59] healing gifts of discernment and these
[1:13:01] different things he says Jesus brought
[1:13:03] it down to a place where those who do
[1:13:06] not have gifts amen
[1:13:08] that do not have very much faith could
[1:13:10] just say it is written so if you don't
[1:13:13] feel you have gifts if you don't feel
[1:13:14] you have very much faith he says you
[1:13:16] could just say it is written there it is
[1:13:19] and then stand right on it jesus said
[1:13:21] that the Word of God is a seed that a
[1:13:23] sower sowed and every word of God every
[1:13:26] promise of God will bring forth of its
[1:13:29] kind amen I believe I preached on a
[1:13:30] guaranteed outcome the last time I was
[1:13:32] in Newfoundland and if you want a place
[1:13:34] to anchor it that's it he says every
[1:13:36] promise of God will bring forth of its
[1:13:38] kind amen so resting there rather than
[1:13:41] something of your own making is what's
[1:13:43] going to bring you the peace and rest
[1:13:44] and bring you the victory amen amen
[1:13:48] let's move on to verse 5 in Luke chapter
[1:13:51] 4 moving on to the next temptation it
[1:13:53] says in the devil
[1:13:54] taking him up into a high mountain
[1:13:56] showed unto him all the kingdoms of the
[1:13:58] world in a moment of time and the devil
[1:14:01] said unto Him all this power will I give
[1:14:04] thee and the glory of them for that is
[1:14:06] delivered unto me and to whomsoever I
[1:14:09] will I give it if thou therefore will
[1:14:12] worship me all shall be thine Amen now
[1:14:16] we know we there should be no doubt in
[1:14:18] our minds as to who the ruler of this
[1:14:20] world is right now I'm in this is
[1:14:21] Satan's Eden and the sooner we recognize
[1:14:24] it and accept it the easier our battle
[1:14:26] is actually going to be because we won't
[1:14:27] get so caught up in the politics we
[1:14:29] won't get so caught up in the economic
[1:14:31] issues and the way things are going and
[1:14:33] how things are sliding downhill and dad
[1:14:35] to doubt to doubt why because it's
[1:14:37] Satan's Eden that's exactly what it's
[1:14:38] supposed to do it's supposed to go
[1:14:40] downhill it's supposed to be judged and
[1:14:41] it's gonna be burned with fire at the
[1:14:43] end amen so if we can accept that and
[1:14:46] recognize that it's gonna make it easier
[1:14:48] because then when things come against us
[1:14:50] from this side of the world you know
[1:14:51] from the world itself and whatnot we
[1:14:54] just understand that Satan's Kingdom
[1:14:55] coming against the but what the kingdom
[1:14:57] of heaven they meant so look at what
[1:15:00] Jesus offers it
[1:15:02] Jesus has offered here because it is
[1:15:03] Satan's to offer at that time amen the
[1:15:05] lamb has not come down with that
[1:15:07] abstract title deed yet so Satan
[1:15:09] squatting on it and he has possession
[1:15:11] over for now embed and what's the price
[1:15:13] that Jesus has to pay in order to get
[1:15:15] this possession he has to worship Satan
[1:15:17] amen he asked to put Satan more
[1:15:19] specifically in a position of authority
[1:15:21] over Jesus amen
[1:15:23] but Satan again in his testing in his
[1:15:26] trial and his temptation here he exposes
[1:15:28] his weakness because Satan wouldn't ask
[1:15:31] for Jesus to submit to him if Jesus was
[1:15:33] already under submission to him if Jesus
[1:15:36] was under Satan's Authority if Satan had
[1:15:38] power over Jesus he wouldn't be asking
[1:15:40] him to give it to him amen
[1:15:42] look at it this way I don't ask my kids
[1:15:44] to obey me I tell my kids to obey me and
[1:15:47] they obey me why because I'm the father
[1:15:49] and I have authority over them at least
[1:15:52] until they're 18 but if I told my kids
[1:15:54] what I'll give you money I'll give you
[1:15:55] gifts I'll give you this favor that
[1:15:57] favor if you'll what obey me now that's
[1:16:01] me saying okay you have a choice here I
[1:16:03] don't have authority over you you have
[1:16:05] to choose to obey me and so Satan's got
[1:16:07] this say
[1:16:07] thing with Jesus he knows he has no
[1:16:09] authority over Jesus Satan has to get
[1:16:12] this worship from Jesus willingly Jesus
[1:16:14] has to give it to on they men so and
[1:16:17] then we see another beautiful lesson
[1:16:19] here if you want to know the value of
[1:16:20] what you have look at what Satan's
[1:16:22] giving you in return for what he's
[1:16:24] asking of you so he's asking Jesus for
[1:16:27] worship he's asking to put him in a
[1:16:30] place Satan in a place of headship over
[1:16:32] him and what Satan is willing to give up
[1:16:34] every single thing that he has ownership
[1:16:36] of on the earth for that one thing from
[1:16:38] Jesus so we start to take that back to
[1:16:41] our lives but let's just stop there just
[1:16:43] for a moment because what's he offering
[1:16:45] right he's offering Jesus what Jesus
[1:16:47] wants to have anyways he knows Jesus
[1:16:49] wants and he knows that the Son of God
[1:16:51] comes to die and in doing so he's going
[1:16:53] to take possession so he's offering
[1:16:55] Jesus what Jesus has come for in the
[1:16:57] first place
[1:16:57] so what's he gonna do with us is he
[1:16:59] gonna offer it all in one shot like he
[1:17:01] did Jesus no cuz for one thing I don't
[1:17:04] believe Satan knows what it is that our
[1:17:05] purpose or plan is here on earth right
[1:17:08] he doesn't have that insight he doesn't
[1:17:10] have the inspiration he doesn't have the
[1:17:11] knowledge of God for our lives so he's
[1:17:13] got to throw out hooks in front of each
[1:17:14] one of us little baits to see what each
[1:17:16] one of us will nibble on amen but rest
[1:17:18] assured that for the men especially
[1:17:20] you're gonna get nibbles and hooks for
[1:17:22] for what careers for jobs that pay you
[1:17:25] more money you're gonna get promotion
[1:17:27] potential you're gonna be able to move
[1:17:29] to other places
[1:17:30] take your families away from church all
[1:17:32] these different things it's gonna be put
[1:17:34] in front of you you're gonna get offers
[1:17:35] of overtime in a time of need aren't you
[1:17:37] what to keep you out of church you're
[1:17:39] gonna be tempted to take on more than
[1:17:41] you can handle
[1:17:42] and it's gonna cut into your family life
[1:17:43] what's he gonna do he's gonna try and
[1:17:45] chip away at things he knows a Christian
[1:17:46] needs to have fellowship a good church
[1:17:49] body amen a family life if you're
[1:17:51] married these different things he's
[1:17:52] gonna try and chip away at those as best
[1:17:54] he can coz what he doesn't know what
[1:17:56] your your your end time goal is he
[1:17:58] doesn't know what your purpose is Satan
[1:18:00] didn't know that I was gonna be called
[1:18:02] to the ministry so I don't believe he
[1:18:04] was trying to keep me from it but as
[1:18:06] soon as that call became apparent I
[1:18:08] believe that he would have recognized
[1:18:09] that because I would have been doing
[1:18:10] things to promote it in my own life and
[1:18:12] then he would have said whoa we really
[1:18:14] need to start working against this but
[1:18:16] in the meantime he's gonna start
[1:18:17] throwing things out and I can say
[1:18:19] personally I've been off for big
[1:18:20] promotions
[1:18:21] I've been offered better lifestyles more
[1:18:23] money at multiple times in my life and
[1:18:25] every time that they are thrown out
[1:18:27] there it's at a time when God is trying
[1:18:29] to get me into a different channel to
[1:18:32] try and get me to make a big decision
[1:18:33] towards him a man I remember when I
[1:18:35] moved back to Canada I got offered just
[1:18:37] before I moved back to Canada four weeks
[1:18:39] before I think or six weeks I got
[1:18:41] offered a big promotion to move to
[1:18:43] Houston more money I was gonna run an
[1:18:45] engine engineering team at a young age I
[1:18:47] was gonna be able to buy that Porsche I
[1:18:48] always wanted big house in Houston and
[1:18:51] these different things
[1:18:52] guess what Houston has even further away
[1:18:54] from church than we were at that time we
[1:18:55] were still making services every every
[1:18:57] every service but if we went to Houston
[1:19:00] we'd only make Sundays at best and it
[1:19:03] was there's a temptation there because
[1:19:05] we could use them money you know you're
[1:19:06] still young you're trying to get things
[1:19:08] paid off and kind of build up a bit of a
[1:19:10] nest egg and whatnot but right at that
[1:19:12] same time there was that pull to come
[1:19:14] back to Canada amen there were things
[1:19:16] that God needed to work on to me and my
[1:19:17] life and my marriage and I had to be in
[1:19:19] a certain place to do it and so
[1:19:21] obviously I made that decision to come
[1:19:23] back and then I come here to to British
[1:19:25] Columbia eventually and I'm making more
[1:19:27] money than I've ever made in my life and
[1:19:29] what but with that came a ton of
[1:19:32] responsibility which I don't mind but
[1:19:34] with that came stress came persecution
[1:19:36] came people trying to undercut me I was
[1:19:39] losing sleep I was losing hair I was
[1:19:42] more difficult with my family my
[1:19:43] marriage was suffering my health was
[1:19:45] suffering and what I was bound by golden
[1:19:48] handcuffs I was making too much money to
[1:19:50] walk away from it but yet at the same
[1:19:52] time it was destroying things that I
[1:19:55] held dear and so what did I do I had to
[1:19:57] walk away from it and I had to take less
[1:19:59] money in a similar position granted but
[1:20:02] less money and I walked into something
[1:20:04] that was way less stressful virtually no
[1:20:06] stress I'm a way better with the family
[1:20:08] with the kids I think great kids spend
[1:20:12] more time with them I'm able to focus
[1:20:13] more on the ministry side of things and
[1:20:15] then I don't have as much of that time
[1:20:17] that has to be you know downtime nothing
[1:20:19] time really where you have to do nothing
[1:20:22] you have to do things that are very and
[1:20:24] maybe not carnal but just things that
[1:20:27] are not they don't redeem the time maybe
[1:20:29] if I could put it that way
[1:20:30] amen and that kind of had the
[1:20:32] get pulled away and so as I stepped into
[1:20:34] a different job making less money all of
[1:20:37] a sudden that stress drops away and now
[1:20:38] I'm more able to focus on my ministry
[1:20:40] not just ministering behind the pulpit
[1:20:42] within my family and whatnot amen I'm on
[1:20:45] a somewhat downward trend in terms of
[1:20:48] making money it seems every time I make
[1:20:50] a decision towards God I make less money
[1:20:52] hopefully he stops before I'm making
[1:20:54] nothing amen
[1:20:57] trusting that he'll do that amen but
[1:20:58] what I do know is I'm happier it making
[1:21:01] less money and doing what God wants me
[1:21:03] to do and somehow we still make it
[1:21:05] through every month with with usually
[1:21:07] with money in the bank and he certainly
[1:21:09] provided for us every way and we thank
[1:21:11] him for him in a minute but we know
[1:21:16] Satan is going to pick his moment he's
[1:21:17] picking his moment with Jesus when he's
[1:21:19] weak and we know Satan's gonna pick his
[1:21:20] moments with us amen when we're at our
[1:21:23] weakest moments in that particular area
[1:21:25] if it's finances or jobs he's going to
[1:21:27] try and get us to take something that'll
[1:21:29] that'll infringe on the other things
[1:21:31] that are a value to us as believers amen
[1:21:33] he's gonna offer you your goal at some
[1:21:36] point where you're trying to get but
[1:21:37] he's gonna offer it in a way that
[1:21:38] doesn't make you go through the hard
[1:21:40] work or cling to those things that
[1:21:42] matter to the believer amen
[1:21:43] he's gonna get you good and stressed and
[1:21:45] then he's gonna do what he's gonna offer
[1:21:46] you a hobby or a pastime but it maybe
[1:21:49] give you some of that relaxation you
[1:21:51] seek a many oh wait til you don't have a
[1:21:53] job and then he's gonna offer you
[1:21:54] stability in a job that's away from
[1:21:56] fellowship and away from your family as
[1:21:58] I talked about or else it'll be so
[1:22:00] consuming so busy that you have no time
[1:22:02] for the things that God has put in your
[1:22:04] life amen
[1:22:04] he'll wait till you Mother's get sick
[1:22:06] and tired of having all these babies so
[1:22:08] close together and you're warned and
[1:22:10] you're tired and you just had enough and
[1:22:12] then what he'll give you a job or he'll
[1:22:14] give you some little role where you can
[1:22:16] step away from that and not focus on
[1:22:18] what he's given you and try and go and
[1:22:21] find value and find self-worth than that
[1:22:24] him and try and get rid of the tiredness
[1:22:25] and whatnot amen and I've seen it time
[1:22:27] and time again where are these sisters
[1:22:29] they get tired of the home life and then
[1:22:31] they step into the corporate life and
[1:22:33] they just go downhill from there and
[1:22:34] virtually every one of the men's in
[1:22:36] divorce within five years if not sooner
[1:22:38] amen he'll wait until you're tired of
[1:22:40] holding your integrity high and and
[1:22:42] sticking tight and this could be
[1:22:43] especially true for
[1:22:45] for businessmen and business owners you
[1:22:46] know where you make a mistake and you've
[1:22:49] got to pay for it literally pay for it
[1:22:51] and maybe you legally might be able to
[1:22:54] get away with it and you could get the
[1:22:55] lawyers involved and you could put it
[1:22:57] off and that person will just let it
[1:22:59] slide
[1:22:59] a mentor you get yourself in trouble at
[1:23:01] work and I've had this happen where
[1:23:03] guess what I did something or my team
[1:23:05] did something and the first inclination
[1:23:07] is what self-preservation it's the it's
[1:23:10] to hold yourself above it and say no no
[1:23:13] that wasn't us and try and put blame or
[1:23:15] or spread it around a little more so it
[1:23:17] doesn't fall squarely on you but rather
[1:23:19] God wants us to do what step right in
[1:23:21] and I've had these awkward conversations
[1:23:23] with my boss where I walk in and say hey
[1:23:25] you know that thing that happened that
[1:23:27] was our fault or that was my fault
[1:23:29] here's what happened here's what we've
[1:23:31] done to fix it but the blame is ours and
[1:23:33] they don't know what to do with people
[1:23:34] that do that they don't know what to do
[1:23:36] when you fully accept responsibility for
[1:23:39] yourself for your team amen and it does
[1:23:41] end up raising you up rather than
[1:23:42] because they're gonna find out
[1:23:44] eventually anyways you might as well
[1:23:45] just fess up to it I find amen
[1:23:48] but what did Jesus get offered here amen
[1:23:51] he got offered a shortcut and verse 8
[1:23:53] says jesus answered and said to him to
[1:23:54] get thee behind me Satan for it is
[1:23:57] written that thou shalt worship the Lord
[1:23:58] thy God and him only shalt thou serve
[1:24:01] now Jesus again doesn't dispute with
[1:24:03] Satan that he is the ruler of the
[1:24:05] kingdoms of the earth he knows he is
[1:24:06] squatting or not he's still the ruler of
[1:24:08] the earth at that time amen
[1:24:10] but same is coming after him and I think
[1:24:12] he's trying to bait him a little bit to
[1:24:14] try and argue with him maybe a little
[1:24:15] bit and and what not it reminds me of
[1:24:17] you know I won't name names but how the
[1:24:19] little brother will go to the big
[1:24:21] brother and say I'm faster than you I'm
[1:24:23] stronger than you or I can beat you up
[1:24:25] and guess what he can't and the big
[1:24:27] brother knows it and if the Brid brother
[1:24:29] is nice and and responsible and mature
[1:24:31] then he doesn't do anything but if that
[1:24:33] little brother keeps picking at him
[1:24:35] what's he gonna do one day he's gonna
[1:24:36] race him and he's going to absolutely
[1:24:38] destroy him or he's gonna wrestle him
[1:24:40] and pin him so fast or do whatever it
[1:24:43] takes beat him in hockey 10 to nothing
[1:24:44] what to show that he's got more power
[1:24:47] more speed more skill but Jesus doesn't
[1:24:50] do that Jesus doesn't come over the top
[1:24:51] on Satan he doesn't berate him he
[1:24:53] doesn't say yo you just wait Satan
[1:24:55] you're going to get your
[1:24:56] and I'm gonna get those and you're gonna
[1:24:57] be thrown into the pit and all these
[1:24:59] different things he doesn't rile up
[1:25:01] against them amen it's so easy for us to
[1:25:03] get sucked into arguments and and
[1:25:05] conversations and discussions where it
[1:25:08] has nothing to do anything good it's not
[1:25:10] going to bring any good to the hearer
[1:25:13] Amen or the or the one that's involved
[1:25:15] in it I'm trying to get us to flare up
[1:25:17] and try and defend our position in
[1:25:19] what's ours we don't have to we just
[1:25:21] stand where we are in the Word of God
[1:25:22] raises up a standard against whatever's
[1:25:24] coming against us amen
[1:25:25] what is it Satan will try and distract
[1:25:27] you from what the real issue is every
[1:25:29] single time amen so what will be wise to
[1:25:32] ignore the big things he throws our way
[1:25:34] well again coronavirus the pandemic the
[1:25:37] economy the politics the frustrations it
[1:25:39] is so easy to get frustrated these days
[1:25:41] with the leadership that we see amen it
[1:25:43] is so easy to get frustrated you talk
[1:25:46] about kicking a can down the road of
[1:25:47] debt of irresponsibility of
[1:25:50] ridiculousness it's just balling up in a
[1:25:53] in an unimaginable way and it's so easy
[1:25:56] to get caught up in that but what would
[1:25:58] do we need to get caught up in what
[1:25:59] making it out of here amen going in a
[1:26:02] rapture seeing those Saints knock on our
[1:26:04] door in that morning and saying guess
[1:26:06] what we're leaving shortly amen that's
[1:26:08] what we want to be focused on brother
[1:26:11] Branham talks about why Jesus doesn't
[1:26:13] take this offer and he says in the
[1:26:15] message Elisha 19:53 says every kingdom
[1:26:18] of this world is controlled by Satan the
[1:26:20] Bible said so Satan is the Prince of the
[1:26:23] power of the air and every nation is
[1:26:25] under his domination
[1:26:26] the scripture says that Satan quoted it
[1:26:28] to Jesus and he says I'll give them to
[1:26:30] you if you'll fall down and worship Me
[1:26:32] and Jesus said get thee hence Satan for
[1:26:34] it's written that thou shalt worship the
[1:26:36] Lord and him only shalt thou serve so
[1:26:39] you see they all belong to Satan Jesus
[1:26:42] didn't dispute his words about it but
[1:26:43] Christ knew that he would fall heir to
[1:26:46] all of these nations someday amen the
[1:26:48] reason Jesus didn't answer him back and
[1:26:50] flare up when he talked about this is
[1:26:52] because Jesus knew if he continued in
[1:26:54] the path and according to the word he
[1:26:56] knew he would continue in the path then
[1:26:58] what he'd fall heir he'd get those
[1:27:00] things that Satan was offering him
[1:27:01] anyways amen so the son of the king has
[1:27:06] to have a kingdom jesus knew I'm the son
[1:27:08] of a king amen
[1:27:10] gonna get this kingdom the earth had to
[1:27:12] be redeemed first though we know that
[1:27:13] bloody lamb is what came up from behind
[1:27:15] the throne amen in Revelation it wasn't
[1:27:18] coming out as the lion he came out as a
[1:27:20] bloody lamb and Jesus knew this he knew
[1:27:22] that he had to be the lamb before he
[1:27:24] could ever be the lion and so what that
[1:27:26] earth had to be redeemed
[1:27:28] it can't be possessed without paying the
[1:27:30] fee amen and we know that's what that
[1:27:31] sacrifice was all about that
[1:27:33] like-for-like transaction where a
[1:27:34] sinless man took on all of humanity's
[1:27:37] sin and law paid the price amen and the
[1:27:40] message how can I overcome brother
[1:27:42] Branham shows exactly the shortcut that
[1:27:45] he Satan was trying to give to Jesus he
[1:27:47] said remember he was trying to get him
[1:27:49] to forfeit it without the cross amen if
[1:27:53] he did it we'd be lost he could have
[1:27:55] took the kingdom he was tempted to do it
[1:27:57] now brother Branham says death is a hard
[1:27:59] thing he was tempted to take his liberty
[1:28:01] and be the king of the earth without the
[1:28:03] cross but if he did his subjects would
[1:28:06] have died a man he did that he resisted
[1:28:08] this temptation why because of you and I
[1:28:10] same would have gladly made that
[1:28:12] proposition with him but he said get
[1:28:14] thee behind me Satan he didn't do it he
[1:28:17] come and suffered and took the hard
[1:28:18] rugged route he took the route of
[1:28:20] persecution he took the route of death
[1:28:23] amen Satan's promise here was what give
[1:28:25] Jesus the reward without the pain
[1:28:27] without the suffering without the hard
[1:28:29] work amen he's offering Jesus a shortcut
[1:28:33] saying look just bypass the cross I'll
[1:28:35] give it all to you now and you can have
[1:28:37] it you don't have to worry about it amen
[1:28:40] so what's satan gonna offer us I mean if
[1:28:42] he's gonna offer Jesus a shortcut he's
[1:28:44] gonna offer us a shortcut isn't he as
[1:28:46] well he's gonna tell us what brother
[1:28:49] branham says in the message you must be
[1:28:50] born again he says they want a shortcut
[1:28:52] to heaven speaking of everyone really
[1:28:55] they want a shortcut to heaven taking as
[1:28:58] much of the world as they can take
[1:29:00] that's what brother Graham says the
[1:29:02] shortcut is for the believer that Saint
[1:29:03] is going to offer a shortcut to heaven
[1:29:05] taking as much of the world as they can
[1:29:07] take this is the message you must be
[1:29:09] born again you can't take any of it
[1:29:11] there's no shortcuts you come the way of
[1:29:14] Calvary you come the way of the brass
[1:29:15] serpent and or the brass altar you come
[1:29:18] the way of the brazen serpent you die
[1:29:20] you literally die to yourself
[1:29:23] dieeee to the things of the world and
[1:29:24] are born to new amen no world the things
[1:29:27] of the world is dead there's no
[1:29:30] shortcuts eat they want to come now
[1:29:32] listen to this he says they want to come
[1:29:34] what to heaven they want to come right
[1:29:37] quick they don't want to grow we grow in
[1:29:41] the Lord
[1:29:42] it takes growth and experience amen
[1:29:46] the only way you can have experience is
[1:29:48] by experience you have to go through it
[1:29:51] you don't get it by sitting and
[1:29:53] listening and learning you have to go
[1:29:55] through it to get experiencing men 1965
[1:29:59] events made clear by prophecy he says
[1:30:00] see the world and the people are
[1:30:03] watching for some little outlet some
[1:30:05] little bypass some little shortcut but
[1:30:08] there is no shortcuts in the Word of God
[1:30:10] there's one pattern you must cut
[1:30:13] yourself and fit that pattern not try to
[1:30:16] cut the pattern to fit you everybody
[1:30:19] must do that there's only one way God
[1:30:21] has to do it as of doing it amen so
[1:30:25] what's our temptation what's our
[1:30:26] shortcut to cut the word to fit us
[1:30:28] rather than to cut ourselves to fit the
[1:30:30] word amen
[1:30:31] brother Branham said that it was what
[1:30:33] the shortcut was to take as much of the
[1:30:36] world as we can and still be a Christian
[1:30:38] a menace to refuse to grow it's just to
[1:30:41] sit there and say I believe in Christ
[1:30:44] I've accepted his sacrifice and you're
[1:30:46] sitting there is a justified lump doing
[1:30:48] nothing except claiming the blood of
[1:30:50] Christ and there's no growth
[1:30:52] there's no sanctification there's no
[1:30:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost and there's no
[1:30:56] adoption that moves you into a place
[1:30:58] where God trusts you and uses you amen
[1:31:00] as a member of the Bride of Christ what
[1:31:05] is it they won't yield to the Holy
[1:31:06] Spirit's cleansing power amen in the
[1:31:09] third seal brother Bram says Christ
[1:31:11] wants his white pure with the word the
[1:31:13] way she must be because nothing not one
[1:31:16] taught or one judo I think he means one
[1:31:18] jot or one tittle but he literally said
[1:31:20] totter doodle will pass from that law
[1:31:22] from that book till it's all fulfilled
[1:31:24] Jesus said both heavens and earth will
[1:31:26] pass away but my word will never pass he
[1:31:28] says don't put any private
[1:31:30] interpretation to it he wants the pure
[1:31:32] unadulterated now listen as he says the
[1:31:35] pure
[1:31:36] unadulterated not even a flirt now this
[1:31:40] is where this really struck home to me
[1:31:41] because it resonates with me he says I
[1:31:43] wouldn't want my wife flirting with some
[1:31:45] other man now you brothers think if you
[1:31:48] came across your wife with a fancy
[1:31:50] little smile and all dressed up and
[1:31:52] getting kind of close to a guy and
[1:31:54] having some sort of an intimate
[1:31:56] conversation or little smiles and
[1:31:57] back-and-forth witty banter I guarantee
[1:32:00] you you would flare up amen if I saw
[1:32:03] Blanca doing that and she's sitting here
[1:32:05] laughing yeah we would have a problem
[1:32:08] amen you would probably see me lose the
[1:32:10] victory but I would get the victory over
[1:32:12] the man that was doing it I guarantee
[1:32:13] you amen he'd be dead and then I deal
[1:32:17] with her amen but listen what he says I
[1:32:21] wouldn't want my wife flirting with some
[1:32:23] other man and when you go to listening
[1:32:25] to any kind of reasons beyond that the
[1:32:28] pure unadulterated word you're listening
[1:32:30] you're flirting with Satan amen
[1:32:33] don't it make you feel religious God
[1:32:34] wants you to stay unadulterated stay
[1:32:37] right there with that word stay with it
[1:32:39] all right but listen what he talked
[1:32:42] about there he says he talked about what
[1:32:44] growing impatience a mint growing in
[1:32:47] patience right
[1:32:49] what settled in wresting waiting on God
[1:32:52] to do it now I know I've mentioned this
[1:32:54] before but it's always there it's maybe
[1:32:56] something I don't know I struggle with
[1:32:58] it and you look in the scripture and we
[1:33:00] know this is an endtime we know we're
[1:33:03] getting close and you start to look at
[1:33:05] certain things in your life and
[1:33:06] attitudes and whatnot and you think that
[1:33:08] really odd not to be there right we're
[1:33:11] looking for that growth we're looking
[1:33:13] for things to be cut away from us and it
[1:33:15] seems like things still linger at times
[1:33:17] when we say Lord what is this all about
[1:33:19] but we have to wait there because in his
[1:33:21] time and in his season brother Branham
[1:33:23] says its growth and experience and he'll
[1:33:25] give you a time he'll either get you to
[1:33:27] a place where you're desperate to get
[1:33:28] rid of it or he'll take it away from you
[1:33:30] supernatural and he can choose which way
[1:33:32] he's gonna go usually he'll take you
[1:33:34] through it with the trial a man that's
[1:33:35] just been my experience
[1:33:37] but what we're tempted to fight that
[1:33:39] daily grind in that patience and that
[1:33:41] rest and the finished work that we know
[1:33:44] he's going to bring us to a full
[1:33:45] overcoming state amen and what do we do
[1:33:48] we get frustrated
[1:33:49] we get confused we start cutting off
[1:33:51] fellowship we start thinking less of
[1:33:53] ourselves we start pulling back from the
[1:33:55] word wide because sometimes we're
[1:33:57] thinking well what's wrong with me right
[1:34:00] but a miserable Christian isn't going to
[1:34:03] do anything good and so we've got to be
[1:34:05] able to say Lord my life is in your
[1:34:07] hands and you're gonna do what you need
[1:34:08] to do in the time that you choose to do
[1:34:10] it in amen and then we can't do it
[1:34:13] ourselves that's for sure the flesh can
[1:34:15] achieve this on its own my discipline is
[1:34:17] not going to take me into a rapture the
[1:34:19] only discipline I can have is to read my
[1:34:22] Bible and pray that's about the only
[1:34:23] discipline I can think about that's
[1:34:24] where I make a conscious choice but to
[1:34:26] produce the fruit of the Spirit requires
[1:34:28] the spirit itself amen
[1:34:31] moving on verse 9 this word Satan starts
[1:34:35] to twist scriptures and this is where it
[1:34:36] gets fun amen
[1:34:40] then he brought him to Jerusalem and
[1:34:42] sent him on a pinnacle of the temple and
[1:34:44] said to him if there'll be the Son of
[1:34:46] God cast thyself down from hence for it
[1:34:49] is written though men here you go Satan
[1:34:51] quoting scripture and I guarantee you we
[1:34:53] all know what Satan that loves to quote
[1:34:55] scripture to us he says for it is
[1:34:57] written he shall give his angels charge
[1:34:59] over thee to keep thee and in their
[1:35:01] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:35:03] any time thou dash thy foot against the
[1:35:06] stone amen we could probably spend weeks
[1:35:08] weeks preaching on this sort of a
[1:35:11] situation in this scripture amen but we
[1:35:14] see that this is probably the trickiest
[1:35:15] things for Christians to deal with today
[1:35:17] is when were taken back to the scripture
[1:35:20] and we're tempted or were pressed by
[1:35:22] somebody that's using Scripture against
[1:35:24] us trying to pin us into a corner amen
[1:35:26] but we know that to uh properly apply
[1:35:29] apply the Word of God takes what a
[1:35:31] revelation to rightly discern the Word
[1:35:33] of God and that can only come through
[1:35:35] the Holy Spirit amen
[1:35:37] what Satan's game here with Jesus he's
[1:35:40] trying to do what twist the Word of God
[1:35:42] trying to get him to claim a promise but
[1:35:45] he's doing it without doing the full
[1:35:47] word amen Jesus answers him in verse 12
[1:35:50] and says and Jesus answering said unto
[1:35:51] him it is said thou shalt not tempt the
[1:35:54] LORD thy God now Jesus said st. in was
[1:35:57] asking Jesus to tempt God why well if we
[1:36:00] look at the original scripture it's in
[1:36:02] Psalms 91 which brother Gerald just
[1:36:03] preached
[1:36:04] not too long ago amen Psalms 91 verse 9
[1:36:07] is the reference that Satan was using
[1:36:09] and it said because thou has made the
[1:36:11] Lord which is which is my refuge even
[1:36:13] the most high thy habitation what a
[1:36:16] wonderful scripture you think who's
[1:36:17] going to twist this there shall no evil
[1:36:20] befall thee neither shall any plague
[1:36:22] come nigh unto thy dwelling praise the
[1:36:24] Lord what a promise for he shall give
[1:36:26] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:36:28] in all thy ways they shall bear thee up
[1:36:31] in their hands lest thou dash thy foot
[1:36:33] against a stone but the angel that says
[1:36:37] the angels are not there to keep you
[1:36:38] from dashing your foot against the stone
[1:36:40] period it says they're there to keep you
[1:36:42] in all your ways meaning that if you're
[1:36:44] walking in your way which is what the
[1:36:47] path of God for your life the angels are
[1:36:49] there to guard you against accidental or
[1:36:51] intentional harm that somebody else
[1:36:53] would inflict on you amen but it's not
[1:36:56] there the angels are not charged to keep
[1:36:59] you from hurting yourself intentionally
[1:37:00] amen that would be iniquity Satan's
[1:37:03] telling Jesus intentionally try and hurt
[1:37:05] yourself intentionally trying to inflict
[1:37:07] harm intentionally throw yourself off of
[1:37:09] this temple pinnacle and then they're
[1:37:11] gonna hold you up and Jesus says no no
[1:37:13] you're tempting God when you put
[1:37:15] yourself intentionally in a position to
[1:37:18] make God come down and do something amen
[1:37:20] you'll see situations in the in the
[1:37:23] scripture where they might have wanted a
[1:37:25] man of God or a woman of God to do a
[1:37:27] certain thing again thinking back to
[1:37:29] Jesus if the Pharisees would have known
[1:37:31] what he was doing when he went to the
[1:37:32] Pool of Bethesda they just said if
[1:37:34] you're the Son of God healed them all
[1:37:36] and that's what Satan would have tempted
[1:37:38] him with you well you've got the power
[1:37:39] and authority you heal everyone why you
[1:37:41] just doing one what about the person
[1:37:43] next to him but you have to be able to
[1:37:45] what rightly apply the word you have to
[1:37:47] have discernment by the Holy Spirit to
[1:37:49] know when to apply that word and how
[1:37:51] it's meant to be applied in the first
[1:37:52] place amen
[1:37:53] otherwise you're abusing the word of God
[1:37:56] you're putting God to a test that he
[1:37:58] never meant to be tested amen and that's
[1:38:02] probably one of the the trickiest things
[1:38:04] that Satan has convinced the world of is
[1:38:06] a scripture that you know that for God
[1:38:08] so loved the world that He gave His only
[1:38:10] begotten Son that whosoever believes in
[1:38:11] Him should not perish but have
[1:38:13] or lasting life and so they say I
[1:38:14] believe in Jesus I believe in Christ
[1:38:16] I've accepted his sacrifice but they
[1:38:19] don't get baptized they don't go on to
[1:38:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not
[1:38:22] only that their life doesn't change and
[1:38:23] if it does it changes only marginally
[1:38:25] but they more or less stay right where
[1:38:27] they are they stay in sin many times
[1:38:30] they even know about it to a degree but
[1:38:32] they stay in there and then they what
[1:38:33] they twist the scriptures that says
[1:38:35] there's a forgiveness of sins under the
[1:38:36] blood of Christ and they'll go in and
[1:38:38] out and in and out of sin they'll commit
[1:38:40] what's called iniquity what doing that
[1:38:42] what you know is wrong they'll do it
[1:38:44] time and time again and then say it but
[1:38:46] lord I claim your I claim your promise I
[1:38:47] claim your promise there's no desire in
[1:38:49] them to serve Christ but they're using
[1:38:51] that blood as what some sort of a shield
[1:38:53] to try and make themselves feel better
[1:38:55] and then that's twisting the Scriptures
[1:38:57] Matthew 7:22 says many will say to me in
[1:39:00] that day Lord Lord have not we
[1:39:02] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:39:04] cast out devils and in thy name done
[1:39:05] many wonderful works then I will profess
[1:39:08] unto them I never knew you depart from
[1:39:10] me ye that work iniquity what is it
[1:39:13] people don't do what God tells them to
[1:39:15] do they pick and choose what they want
[1:39:17] even to the point where they will do
[1:39:19] signs and wonders we know that brother
[1:39:21] Branham taught it and the anointing that
[1:39:23] can come down and he said God honors
[1:39:25] faith period God honors faith and so
[1:39:28] it's not those men doing it in the first
[1:39:29] place it's always been God responding to
[1:39:31] people's faith brother Branham said this
[1:39:35] in Israel and the church 1953 he said
[1:39:37] when Jesus was here on earth he was God
[1:39:39] he was Emmanuel God was in Christ
[1:39:42] reconciling the world to himself he
[1:39:45] never used any of his great gifts when
[1:39:47] he met Satan he said it's written man
[1:39:48] shall not live by bread alone it's
[1:39:50] written thou shalt not tempt the LORD
[1:39:52] thy God and he defeated him that's it no
[1:39:56] the scripture Satan knows it too but you
[1:39:58] got to know how to rightly divide the
[1:40:01] word of God see my wife shared something
[1:40:04] with me the other day and it really
[1:40:05] struck me and it said it was just a you
[1:40:09] know one of those little phrases you see
[1:40:11] inspirational phrases or whatnot
[1:40:12] it said discernment doesn't mean to be
[1:40:15] able to know the difference between
[1:40:16] right and wrong rather discernment is
[1:40:19] the ability dessert to discern between
[1:40:21] right and nearly right amen isn't that
[1:40:25] true we've been taught to
[1:40:26] well to be fooled by the obvious right
[1:40:29] people will come in and they could come
[1:40:30] in with certain big doctrines or ideas
[1:40:32] or whatever saying that becomes in the
[1:40:34] presents you with these opportunities we
[1:40:36] know that what's right and wrong
[1:40:39] but what is it that he tries to come in
[1:40:41] with and the scripture talks about you
[1:40:42] know you know it'll it'll fool even the
[1:40:46] elect if it were possible at the end
[1:40:48] it'll be so close there'll be a Razors
[1:40:50] Edge between what right and nearly right
[1:40:53] amen so what is it going to be what we
[1:40:56] have to have discernment not only to see
[1:40:59] what Singh's doing but right we apply
[1:41:00] the word to handle the situation amen
[1:41:03] now this was the end of Jesus test for
[1:41:06] now verse 13 says when the devil had
[1:41:11] ended all the temptation he departed
[1:41:12] from him now notice it says he departed
[1:41:15] from him for a season and then Jesus
[1:41:17] didn't get a free pass from Satan's
[1:41:19] temptations just as he defeated him at
[1:41:20] one time but rather he gets a pass for a
[1:41:23] time but what happens after that Satan
[1:41:26] doesn't go after Jesus next what does he
[1:41:27] go after he goes after his disciples
[1:41:30] right Jesus had a ton of disciples and
[1:41:32] then he goes and he takes away the
[1:41:34] seventy right and he's left with twelve
[1:41:36] and even one of them as a devil the
[1:41:37] scripture says what is it we see Peter
[1:41:40] being influenced by Satan there at
[1:41:41] different times and then the end Satan
[1:41:43] still takes his best shot at Jesus so
[1:41:45] which is what he's betrayed he's
[1:41:47] rejected right and then he takes him to
[1:41:49] the whipping post and then he takes him
[1:41:51] on the cross and he puts the sting of
[1:41:52] death in her mental Satan still gets his
[1:41:54] shot at you and if he can't get out you
[1:41:57] then he's gonna go after those that are
[1:41:59] close to you amen if you're a man and
[1:42:01] you're married if he can't get to you
[1:42:02] what's he gonna do he's gonna go after
[1:42:03] your wife he's gonna go after your
[1:42:05] children and it's especially more
[1:42:07] dramatic when your children are growing
[1:42:08] up amen when they're out of the house or
[1:42:10] when they're old enough they're at the
[1:42:11] age of accountability and he can go
[1:42:13] after them and you can't do anything
[1:42:14] about it what he'll do he'll try and
[1:42:16] take your peace by going after them amen
[1:42:19] he'll try and interrupt things by going
[1:42:20] after your wife if he came to interrupt
[1:42:22] your peace amen if he can't get to the
[1:42:24] pastor what does he go after the
[1:42:26] congregation every single time if you
[1:42:28] don't believe it
[1:42:29] read what brother Branham said in that
[1:42:31] what we call a word to the church right
[1:42:33] What did he say if he can't get you
[1:42:34] what's he gonna do he's gonna inject
[1:42:36] somebody with the poison of what
[1:42:37] bitterness or envy
[1:42:39] what inside the church right you can't
[1:42:42] get the pastor he's gonna scatter the
[1:42:43] Sheep some other way and he'll get them
[1:42:44] fighting amongst themselves amen he'll
[1:42:46] try every avenue that he can get every
[1:42:49] person every situation everything that
[1:42:51] you hold dear he's gonna attack it if he
[1:42:53] can't get to you directly amen
[1:42:56] it says in and this is in Matthew 4 I'm
[1:42:59] jumping to a different scripture here
[1:43:01] and you don't need to worry about it
[1:43:02] says then the devil leaveth him and
[1:43:03] behold angels came and ministered to him
[1:43:06] so God has a heavenly host to come down
[1:43:09] and now meet Jesus needs and that's a
[1:43:11] that's a real rest for us is when when
[1:43:15] the battles over
[1:43:16] amen we've got a rest that comes after
[1:43:18] we've got angels that minister to us and
[1:43:20] it's not always the angels in the
[1:43:22] heavenly sense you know that they come
[1:43:23] from heaven sometimes they do I believe
[1:43:25] that but he'll send angels ministering
[1:43:27] to us whether it's another believer
[1:43:28] he'll send another minister to come in
[1:43:30] and preach you know he'll send the right
[1:43:32] fellowship he'll send you know the right
[1:43:35] message your way in these different
[1:43:36] things
[1:43:38] Matthew 4:14 says and listen to the
[1:43:41] effect this all had on Jesus so Jesus
[1:43:43] remember he comes out of the water the
[1:43:45] the Holy Spirit's come on him identified
[1:43:47] him as his beloved son and he goes
[1:43:49] driven directly into the wilderness and
[1:43:51] after the wilderness temptation matthew
[1:43:53] 4:14 says and Jesus returned in the
[1:43:56] power of the Spirit onto Galilee and
[1:43:58] there went out a fame of him through all
[1:44:00] the region round about now remember he
[1:44:02] was supposed to be humbled he was
[1:44:04] supposed to be obedient and when he's
[1:44:06] done all that now he goes out in the
[1:44:09] power of the spirit into Galilee and
[1:44:10] there was a fame that comes to him what
[1:44:12] he gets a reputation now and he taught
[1:44:15] in their synagogues being glorified of
[1:44:18] all a man it's a beautiful type for us
[1:44:20] when this is all over when the final
[1:44:22] trial we've gone through what we're
[1:44:25] strengthened and we walk out in fullness
[1:44:26] of power in the spirit and each and
[1:44:28] every one of our lives they men so let's
[1:44:31] do a quick summary here we're about
[1:44:33] two-thirds of the way through by God's
[1:44:34] grace old-type so we look at how Satan
[1:44:39] attacks Jesus and we want to just
[1:44:41] summarize again what he's doing to us in
[1:44:43] the same way so the first thing he did
[1:44:45] he had three attacks but the first one
[1:44:47] is or the overall attack as he's saying
[1:44:50] if you're the son of God prove it and so
[1:44:52] when he comes to
[1:44:53] he's gonna do the same thing he's gonna
[1:44:54] attack our patient position and say if
[1:44:56] you're a son of God if you're a daughter
[1:44:58] of God then do this and do that he's
[1:45:00] gonna what make an inflammatory
[1:45:02] statement he's gonna what take you from
[1:45:04] resting on the word and see if he can
[1:45:06] get you to respond to a situation rather
[1:45:08] than standing firm on what God has given
[1:45:10] you amen I'll try and get you so caught
[1:45:12] up on proving something rather than
[1:45:14] resting on something and that's what we
[1:45:16] don't want to do is get caught up into
[1:45:18] proving ourselves we're not here to
[1:45:20] prove ourselves God proves us it's God
[1:45:22] that gives us strength so why would we
[1:45:24] try and do that in the first place all
[1:45:26] we know is when Satan comes on our
[1:45:27] ground then we respond but otherwise we
[1:45:29] leave him alone let him rage and let him
[1:45:31] do whatever he wants to amen second
[1:45:35] thing he tries to do is get you to
[1:45:36] answer according to his words rather
[1:45:39] than God's word amen he tries to get you
[1:45:41] to give him the answer he's looking for
[1:45:42] rather than you saying no no let's
[1:45:45] answer what the whole word lets rightly
[1:45:46] discern what the whole word says it is
[1:45:49] says about this and then take it from
[1:45:50] Genesis to Revelation not just
[1:45:52] cherry-pick scriptures not just
[1:45:54] cherry-pick arguments but let's take the
[1:45:56] whole picture of the big picture and
[1:45:57] let's respond by that rather than going
[1:46:00] down into this little spot you've taken
[1:46:02] out of context amen Satan wants you to
[1:46:04] pick up his weapon he wants you to work
[1:46:06] with his argument rather than work with
[1:46:08] what God has said in his word amen and
[1:46:10] like I said last night it's Satan would
[1:46:12] have picked up Saul's weapon he'd have
[1:46:13] lost and of say and if he would have
[1:46:16] went with Goliath weapons he would have
[1:46:17] lost but he stuck with what God had
[1:46:19] proven with him and through that what he
[1:46:21] vanquished he vanquished the Philistines
[1:46:23] he vanquished Goliath and he won himself
[1:46:25] the kingdom eventually again not through
[1:46:27] his strength but because he stuck with
[1:46:29] what God had given him then the other
[1:46:32] thing he tries to do is what take a
[1:46:33] shortcut shortcut the pain shortcut the
[1:46:36] suffering in men it says we have to what
[1:46:38] suffer with him to reign with him and he
[1:46:40] tries to take us past that and sometimes
[1:46:43] it's not so much that he'll try and take
[1:46:45] us past it but rather he tries to get us
[1:46:47] cut it short right we don't want to go
[1:46:49] through the whole thing we get into the
[1:46:51] midst of the struggle and we say ah
[1:46:52] enough of this can we just be through it
[1:46:55] but guess what every moment under the
[1:46:57] pressure of God's trial is squeezing out
[1:47:00] more of the world and bringing more of
[1:47:01] the purity of the word into your life
[1:47:03] they meant Satan's lie is that you
[1:47:07] need to have the experience to get the
[1:47:08] reward at the end Amen that you can jump
[1:47:11] to it and can you imagine you that the
[1:47:14] the ones that work or anything I mean
[1:47:16] think of a mother are you gonna be a
[1:47:17] great mother if you don't go through the
[1:47:19] experience of childbirth if you don't go
[1:47:21] through the experience of the sleepless
[1:47:23] nights and these different things as you
[1:47:24] are raising those children as you're
[1:47:26] working with them that experience makes
[1:47:28] you a better mother so when the next one
[1:47:30] comes along then you handle it generally
[1:47:32] better generally better right sisters a
[1:47:36] minute what you learn and you grow and
[1:47:38] the further you go the more confidence
[1:47:40] you get and you're able to handle things
[1:47:41] better and now when you thought you
[1:47:43] could only ever handle one you get the
[1:47:44] second one and it goes better than you
[1:47:46] thought in the third and then if God
[1:47:48] would allow you the fourth and the fifth
[1:47:50] and and you know these different things
[1:47:52] you know how it all happens and whatnot
[1:47:54] but you'll pay a price if you try and
[1:47:56] shortcut and that's what Satan saying is
[1:47:57] look I'll give you the the final reward
[1:48:00] but you don't have to go through the
[1:48:02] experience and then but Christ says no
[1:48:04] to reign with me you have to suffer with
[1:48:06] me amen there's no shortcut in this and
[1:48:08] we're ever brother Branham said takes
[1:48:10] what growth and experience and then the
[1:48:12] last thing he tries to do is what twist
[1:48:14] scripture confuse you by twisting
[1:48:16] scripture by miss applying it by not
[1:48:19] rightly deserting the way it's supposed
[1:48:20] to be meant that's supposed to be
[1:48:22] applied amen he selectively uses the
[1:48:24] scripture rather than taking it from
[1:48:25] Genesis to Revelation and I can tell you
[1:48:28] I was talking to brother Stevens true
[1:48:30] about this a while ago last year
[1:48:32] sometime and and he was talking about
[1:48:34] how you know sometimes we think we've
[1:48:36] got this great revelation and something
[1:48:37] just sparks in us and we really oh I got
[1:48:40] to get that down it's so good but as
[1:48:42] students of the scripture and as
[1:48:45] responsible ministers what do we have to
[1:48:47] do take it from Genesis to Revelation I
[1:48:49] think that's one of the greatest things
[1:48:50] that brother Branham taught us was you
[1:48:52] have to line it up from the beginning to
[1:48:54] the end and if it doesn't go through
[1:48:55] it's not right you may have a truth
[1:48:58] there a portion of truth they says the
[1:49:01] full thing has to fit through that
[1:49:02] filter of Genesis to Revelation brother
[1:49:04] Stephens true said there's nothing more
[1:49:06] disappointing than when you think you
[1:49:07] got caught the inspiration of God and
[1:49:09] you get halfway through the Bible and
[1:49:12] you realize oh oh it doesn't pull all
[1:49:14] the way through now usually there's
[1:49:15] something good in there but it's not
[1:49:17] always and that's why we have to be
[1:49:19] careful amen say
[1:49:20] can try and confuse a Satan's not above
[1:49:22] dropping thoughts in by trying to put in
[1:49:24] you know revelations that aren't quite
[1:49:26] right so as ministers not only as
[1:49:29] ministers amen but as believers we need
[1:49:31] to be sure that anything we take we pull
[1:49:33] it through from start to finish and I
[1:49:35] guarantee you we've all run into people
[1:49:37] that can tie you you and knots with
[1:49:39] scriptures and quotes quotes especially
[1:49:41] maybe not so much scriptures because
[1:49:42] when you start applying scriptures I
[1:49:44] find the quotes don't tend to stand up
[1:49:45] but people know this message inside and
[1:49:48] out and they can give you the book they
[1:49:50] can give you the page and they can give
[1:49:52] you the paragraph of where the Prophet
[1:49:53] said something and they'll say now what
[1:49:55] are you gonna do with it and you know
[1:49:56] what if you haven't studied as much
[1:49:58] you're not going to get it and even if
[1:50:00] you have studies as much you may not get
[1:50:02] it because we aren't given to know
[1:50:03] everything amen we don't have all
[1:50:05] knowledge of the message in scriptures
[1:50:07] we have what we need praise the Lord but
[1:50:09] we don't have it all and so you still
[1:50:11] have to be able to rest and you still
[1:50:12] have to be able to walk away from those
[1:50:14] things and say I'm not here to argue
[1:50:16] with it about it but I'm trusting if I
[1:50:18] need what you have God will reveal it to
[1:50:19] me amen amen
[1:50:22] in every one of those situations our
[1:50:24] response has to be the overcomers answer
[1:50:26] is what it is written and it is written
[1:50:28] from Genesis to Revelation not just in
[1:50:31] one place Amen so I want to talk a bit
[1:50:34] about what it means to give an answer
[1:50:36] amen as a believer in this time and I
[1:50:38] want to start with our Commission
[1:50:40] because each one of us was given the
[1:50:42] Great Commission I believe and not the
[1:50:44] Great Commission in that were called a
[1:50:45] minister behind a pulpit obviously but
[1:50:47] rather we are called to preach the
[1:50:49] gospel which is what the good news and
[1:50:51] what is the good news amen it starts
[1:50:53] with what John 3:16 write for God so
[1:50:56] loved the world we know that Scripture
[1:50:58] and then from there it moves on to what
[1:50:59] acts 2:38 how do we receive eternal life
[1:51:02] amen repent be baptized for the
[1:51:04] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:51:05] the gift of the Holy Spirit amen that is
[1:51:08] the good news that is our Commission and
[1:51:10] we're called to preach it and I believe
[1:51:12] brother Branham talks about this maybe
[1:51:14] not but preaching is not just speaking
[1:51:16] so often we we call somebody a preacher
[1:51:19] because they speak behind a pulpit but a
[1:51:21] preacher has to both live and speak what
[1:51:23] he is saying amen and each one of us
[1:51:25] therefore as a preacher because what we
[1:51:27] speak is the word our conversation our
[1:51:30] testimony is the word but we
[1:51:31] called not only to say it but we are
[1:51:33] called to live at Amen so each one of us
[1:51:35] is given the Great Commission to what
[1:51:37] express what that God has done i press
[1:51:40] we've accepted it we have the Holy
[1:51:41] Spirit living inside of us and that is
[1:51:43] offered to all amen amen and that sounds
[1:51:49] simple doesn't it and guess what it is
[1:51:51] simple
[1:51:51] literally the Christian walk is acts
[1:51:53] 2:38 and I was talking with brother Mark
[1:51:55] about this a little earlier this week
[1:51:57] about how I I'm hearing just more and
[1:52:00] more and I know this isn't new it's been
[1:52:03] around a long time but I'm hearing
[1:52:04] ministers that are turning our Christian
[1:52:05] walk into something so complicated where
[1:52:08] you have to know this mystery and this
[1:52:10] seal and this scripture and this and
[1:52:12] that and the other thing and guess what
[1:52:14] brother Branham never said that
[1:52:16] brother Brown never went into these
[1:52:17] different things he pointed us back to
[1:52:20] what a simplicity in Christ that comes
[1:52:22] with the Holy Spirit
[1:52:24] sealing you into the day of your full
[1:52:26] Redemption and leading and guiding you
[1:52:28] in your life and in that and in that
[1:52:30] alone has found the pureness of the walk
[1:52:33] of the end the end time Christian amen
[1:52:35] brother branham what he preached that
[1:52:37] message God hiding himself in simplicity
[1:52:39] and revealing himself in the same and
[1:52:41] then we've got it to the point where if
[1:52:43] you can recite every revelation under
[1:52:46] the seventh seal and tied it all back to
[1:52:48] it somehow you're not a message believer
[1:52:50] and that's nowhere near the truth they
[1:52:52] meant some of us are gonna know more and
[1:52:54] understand more intellectually by
[1:52:56] revelation however you want to describe
[1:52:57] it but that is not what the requirement
[1:53:00] is for the endtime believer the end time
[1:53:01] believers called to overcome and all I
[1:53:03] know is that God will give each and
[1:53:05] every one of us what we need to go
[1:53:07] through to the end time and and walk out
[1:53:09] in a rapture amen Paul addresses this
[1:53:12] he's in sync 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 3
[1:53:14] he says but I fear lest by any means any
[1:53:17] means now as the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:53:20] through his subtlety so your minds
[1:53:23] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:53:25] that is in Christ amen he says what
[1:53:27] corrupted what is it it starts it takes
[1:53:30] the purity of God in your mind the
[1:53:33] revelation you have and starts to change
[1:53:34] it into something that is hybrid amen it
[1:53:37] starts to add in something that wasn't
[1:53:39] there in the first place it starts to
[1:53:41] confuse you it starts to drag you down
[1:53:43] and all of a sudden your wonder
[1:53:44] I say because I don't understand this or
[1:53:46] have that Amen he says the simplicity
[1:53:48] that is in Christ amen so when it comes
[1:53:53] to the attacks of Satan brings we don't
[1:53:55] have to have some big logical argument
[1:53:58] Amen we don't have to be wise in the
[1:53:59] ways of the world and you know I've seen
[1:54:01] these different ones you know Ravi
[1:54:03] Zacharias these ones and their
[1:54:05] apologetics for the Christian faith and
[1:54:06] they have all these great intellectual
[1:54:08] answers for every situation that's not
[1:54:11] what we're called to do we're not called
[1:54:12] to answer every question but rather
[1:54:14] we're called to live an overcoming light
[1:54:16] and Express Christ in every aspect of
[1:54:19] our life and that is the testimony that
[1:54:21] we give to them it's not an answer to
[1:54:23] every question they can come up with but
[1:54:25] rather that we can show them a living
[1:54:26] Christ today amen
[1:54:28] so Satan we know doesn't come against us
[1:54:31] in person the way he did with Jesus the
[1:54:33] person of Satan does not stand next to
[1:54:35] us and invisibly tempt us as we would
[1:54:38] say it right he what he sends demons
[1:54:40] onto people that would try and influence
[1:54:42] us that would attack us in different
[1:54:44] ways and I've met many at work and
[1:54:46] around that what they'll come against
[1:54:48] you in ways and you don't understand
[1:54:50] what this person's problem is with you
[1:54:52] but yet they keep coming at you and
[1:54:54] coming at you and when they can't get
[1:54:55] you then they start to I try and
[1:54:57] undercut your reputation they're trying
[1:54:59] to do this trying to do that and you
[1:55:00] have no clue why they're doing it and
[1:55:02] all I can tell you is that as Satan on
[1:55:04] that person trying to get at you amen
[1:55:06] and that's what he comes against us with
[1:55:08] but not only that not just people in
[1:55:09] their lives but what through the
[1:55:11] politics of the day through the issues
[1:55:13] of the day you think this Kovan 19
[1:55:15] pandemic is not Satan that Satan is not
[1:55:17] using that to try and influence us to
[1:55:19] what put a spirit of fear on us to put a
[1:55:21] spirit of frustration it's tough we
[1:55:24] don't get to go to church we don't get
[1:55:25] to have fellowships I don't know about
[1:55:27] you guys but I'm about ready to say you
[1:55:29] know what let's risk it let's just do it
[1:55:31] anyways they meant and we'll suffer the
[1:55:33] consequences but that's easy for me to
[1:55:35] say being young and in relative good
[1:55:37] health I don't so but what he tries to
[1:55:40] get us looking at those situations tries
[1:55:42] to get us frustrated tries to get us
[1:55:44] reactive rather than resting amen if you
[1:55:47] look at everything especially in Europe
[1:55:49] and it's really coming in strong in
[1:55:51] North America now what are they doing
[1:55:53] the support for Christianity I mean in
[1:55:55] Europe there is no support for Christian
[1:55:57] it doesn't exist its non-existent hasn't
[1:55:59] been there forever I mean Satan had his
[1:56:00] Eden had his headquarters in Paris and
[1:56:02] then he moved over to Los Angeles the
[1:56:04] Hollywood brother branham said and what
[1:56:07] what have they been doing they've been
[1:56:08] turning the opinions against Christians
[1:56:10] for probably very strongly I would say
[1:56:12] the last 10 to 20 years Amen is this
[1:56:14] this alternate lifestyle the
[1:56:17] homosexuality movement and these
[1:56:18] different things and what are they doing
[1:56:20] here's where they triple eavers is
[1:56:23] they'll get or Christians off well put
[1:56:25] it that way as they get them on their
[1:56:26] talk shows they get them in their
[1:56:28] interviews and then they ask them their
[1:56:29] questions and get them to try and answer
[1:56:31] according to their questions and this is
[1:56:33] the exact same thing that what Satan did
[1:56:35] to Christ as he tried to get him to
[1:56:37] answer according to his way instead of
[1:56:39] according to the word amen so what do
[1:56:41] they do they say to the Christians they
[1:56:43] say are you for or against this are you
[1:56:45] for or against that do you agree with
[1:56:47] this or do you not agree with it and
[1:56:48] what are the Christians say every time
[1:56:50] well we're against it of course we don't
[1:56:52] agree with that but what is it they
[1:56:54] don't answer with it is written across
[1:56:56] the whole thing what they do is they
[1:56:57] answer according to Satan's questions
[1:56:59] and his phrasing rather than bringing it
[1:57:02] back into the fullness of the word amen
[1:57:04] so I want to give you an example of this
[1:57:06] so if you guys will turn to first
[1:57:07] Corinthians chapter 6 I want to give it
[1:57:11] what to my mind will be a it is written
[1:57:14] answer a full answer to the kind of
[1:57:16] situations we're facing today amen so
[1:57:22] first Corinthians 6 amen Satan that's
[1:57:26] what I'm seen as Satan has fooled
[1:57:28] professing Christians into answering
[1:57:31] with the law and only the law and even
[1:57:34] if they may be using the New Testament
[1:57:36] Scriptures they're still using Old
[1:57:38] Testament law so so what we're talking
[1:57:43] about you know whatever it may be
[1:57:44] alternate lifestyles these these
[1:57:46] perverted movements that are out there
[1:57:48] now and whatnot and people you know
[1:57:50] they'll have these people and they say
[1:57:51] well do you agree with their don't agree
[1:57:53] with it well I don't agree with it of
[1:57:54] course and they'll say well what don't
[1:57:56] those people deserve to be happy don't
[1:57:57] they deserve to have love don't they
[1:57:59] deserve to be the way they are didn't
[1:58:01] God make them that way right that's
[1:58:03] dumped so many people doesn't it but
[1:58:05] look what Paul says here in 1st
[1:58:07] Corinthians because we know all these
[1:58:08] things are wrong
[1:58:09] amen but I want
[1:58:10] see that we all are wrong in the first
[1:58:12] place and it's not just those but if we
[1:58:14] when we read this you'll see we have
[1:58:16] something that will probably touch every
[1:58:18] one of our lives either before you know
[1:58:20] before we got saved by God's grace
[1:58:21] first Corinthians 6 verse 9 says know ye
[1:58:24] not that the unrighteous shall not
[1:58:26] inherit the kingdom of God so right
[1:58:28] there the unrighteous the unrighteous is
[1:58:30] everyone that's out from under the blood
[1:58:32] of Christ right because when we took the
[1:58:34] blood of Christ with it we took what his
[1:58:36] righteousness right he says our
[1:58:38] righteousness is as filthy rags but we
[1:58:40] take on his righteousness so he says the
[1:58:42] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:58:43] kingdom of God so right there everybody
[1:58:45] that has not stepped under the blood of
[1:58:47] Jesus Christ cannot inherit the kingdom
[1:58:49] of God so that excludes every single one
[1:58:51] of us prior to us accepting the grace of
[1:58:53] God amen
[1:58:54] it says be not deceived neither
[1:58:56] fornicators so that's people that are
[1:58:58] living in common-law relationships hide
[1:59:01] auditors anybody that's put something
[1:59:03] ahead of God in their life that includes
[1:59:05] all of us at some point amen that's
[1:59:08] everybody everybody's had an idol in
[1:59:10] their life adulterers nor adulterers so
[1:59:13] people that have cheated on their spouse
[1:59:14] or their living
[1:59:15] they've remarried improperly nor
[1:59:17] effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[1:59:19] with mankind
[1:59:20] I mean buffalos refer to homosexuality
[1:59:21] nor thieves I think every single one of
[1:59:25] us has stolen something whether it is
[1:59:26] time if not something physically in our
[1:59:29] lives right or conscience under being
[1:59:34] covetous
[1:59:34] oh I wish I had what he has or she has
[1:59:36] or I looked like her I felt like that or
[1:59:38] had his job or his career his fame or
[1:59:40] his money right nor drunkards millions
[1:59:43] probably billions falling to that nor
[1:59:45] revilers anyone that's turned down the
[1:59:47] Word of God falls into the revealer
[1:59:49] category nor extortioners shall inherit
[1:59:52] the kingdom of God so we go from
[1:59:54] everybody that son not under the blood
[1:59:56] doesn't have it and then he goes into
[1:59:58] some specifics and so that's what
[2:00:00] Christians will say well look 1st
[2:00:02] Corinthians says that the homosexuals
[2:00:04] they're not going into the into the
[2:00:05] kingdom of heaven
[2:00:06] so yeah it's wrong I don't I'm against
[2:00:08] it but they don't go all the way through
[2:00:10] right they see they preach it as a
[2:00:12] condemnation they preach it as a
[2:00:13] judgment but Christ doesn't come in that
[2:00:16] way amen he doesn't just set the law
[2:00:18] without a remedy amen the the Genesis to
[2:00:21] Revelation answering
[2:00:22] includes the whole thing law plus grace
[2:00:23] amen and that's why they don't perceive
[2:00:26] love in a Christians response it's
[2:00:27] because they're only giving the
[2:00:29] judgement but they're not giving them
[2:00:30] the remedy amen but why did we say we're
[2:00:33] against these things cuz it says right
[2:00:35] there it says you can't inherit the
[2:00:36] kingdom of God and it says God hates it
[2:00:38] in other in other places amen so we say
[2:00:41] we hate it because God hates it but the
[2:00:43] reason we also hate it is because if you
[2:00:45] do those things you can't go into heaven
[2:00:47] it meant so we hate it because it causes
[2:00:49] a separation from God and that's what we
[2:00:52] want to do is we want to say we want to
[2:00:54] draw you to Christ and so we don't agree
[2:00:57] with those things because they cause a
[2:00:58] separation from Christ and we need to
[2:01:00] get those under the out of the way we
[2:01:02] need to get you under the blood of
[2:01:03] Christ and get your life changed in
[2:01:05] order that you can come into the kingdom
[2:01:07] amen
[2:01:08] what we're trying to do what the full
[2:01:11] gospel present the full commission they
[2:01:12] men because in verse 11 Paul says in
[2:01:15] such word such were you used to be this
[2:01:18] some of you but you are present so you
[2:01:21] used to be that but now you are washed
[2:01:23] present and continuous you are
[2:01:26] sanctified present and continuous you
[2:01:28] are justified in the name of the Lord
[2:01:30] Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[2:01:33] so he says look you used to be this
[2:01:35] you're telling me that they have
[2:01:37] homosexuals in the church you have been
[2:01:47] washed and sanctified and justified and
[2:01:49] with the Spirit of God now what you live
[2:01:51] a different life that is the as the it
[2:01:54] should be giving to people amen
[2:01:56] that is where we say look we have a
[2:01:59] solution we have a remedy but the
[2:02:01] problem is you can't give that answer if
[2:02:02] you don't have that remedy yourself and
[2:02:04] I believe that's why they don't give it
[2:02:05] so often is that they don't have an
[2:02:07] experience that says you can overcome I
[2:02:10] mean that's the downfall of the church
[2:02:12] is that they've you know accepted the
[2:02:14] doctrines of men and they've taken the
[2:02:15] power of God right out of the church and
[2:02:17] then they let the men lead and the Holy
[2:02:19] Spirit's not there and they have nothing
[2:02:20] that they can offer so all they can
[2:02:22] offer is the law but they can't bring
[2:02:25] that bring in what the power of the
[2:02:26] blood and the rejuvenating and living
[2:02:28] life of the Holy Spirit amen
[2:02:30] they don't talk about the Holy Spirit
[2:02:31] almost on those on those interview
[2:02:34] as in talk shows why because they don't
[2:02:36] have it they haven't know overcoming
[2:02:38] power themselves so all they can do is
[2:02:40] say yep we just don't agree with it amen
[2:02:43] look at what Peter did in the day of
[2:02:45] Pentecost amen here's our if you want to
[2:02:48] see the Commission the Great Commission
[2:02:49] Peter is the first example of what
[2:02:51] getting the Holy Spirit and then he
[2:02:53] comes out and he preaches a sermon to
[2:02:55] the people and what does he do he says
[2:02:56] you killed the Lord and and Christ he
[2:02:59] says he puts the blame on them he says
[2:03:02] look you crucified the very one that
[2:03:04] came to save you the one that was
[2:03:06] promised you crucified Him and what
[2:03:08] effect does it have it pricks their
[2:03:10] conscience amen he brought judgment to
[2:03:12] them he says look you did something you
[2:03:14] shouldn't have done and it caused the
[2:03:16] people's consciences to flare up but
[2:03:18] what Peter he comes right after that
[2:03:20] because they say well what can we do to
[2:03:23] take care of this and then what can we
[2:03:25] do to be saved we know we've messed up
[2:03:26] and Peter comes right over the top and
[2:03:28] he says what acts 2:38 repent and be
[2:03:31] baptized and you shall receive the gift
[2:03:33] of the Holy Ghost and he opens up the
[2:03:35] keys of the kingdom remember jesus said
[2:03:37] to Peter he says I've given you the keys
[2:03:39] whatever you open on earth that will
[2:03:40] open in heaven and whatever you shot
[2:03:42] then I'll shut in these different things
[2:03:43] Peter he turns to the key there he says
[2:03:45] acts 2:38 repent be baptized and you'll
[2:03:48] receive their gift of the Holy Ghost and
[2:03:50] that's all the believers needed ever
[2:03:52] since repent be baptized and receive the
[2:03:54] gift of the Holy Ghost but you'll never
[2:03:56] hear people say that why the other don't
[2:03:58] believe it or they do they're too
[2:03:59] embarrassed to believe it to say it and
[2:04:01] they have no experience that would
[2:04:02] follow through with it amen but when you
[2:04:05] can answer see what they're trying to do
[2:04:07] is they're trying to get you pinned into
[2:04:09] a corner and just know we don't want to
[2:04:11] talk about alternate lifestyles but we
[2:04:13] want to talk about everything that comes
[2:04:14] our way is they want to pin you in the
[2:04:16] corner they want to put you in a box so
[2:04:18] they can somehow walk away and say yes I
[2:04:20] understand where they're coming from but
[2:04:22] when you talk about an experience in the
[2:04:24] life of the Holy Spirit within you
[2:04:26] that's gonna cut through the confusion
[2:04:28] now they may not believe it they may not
[2:04:30] believe it but I'll tell you this when I
[2:04:32] first moved to Alberta I was I worked at
[2:04:34] a place for three or four months and I
[2:04:37] was able to you know I shared what I
[2:04:40] believed and you know they knew I went
[2:04:42] to church and these different things
[2:04:43] they knew I took God seriously and and
[2:04:45] whatnot and I was leaving
[2:04:48] them just before I left my boss we we
[2:04:51] had three of us sharing an office and he
[2:04:53] sat down he said look he says I don't
[2:04:55] know why you are the way you are he says
[2:04:58] but I'd like to know what it is you
[2:05:00] believe he said so I'm gonna give you
[2:05:02] time I want you to tell me why you
[2:05:04] believe in why you live the way you do
[2:05:05] and for thirty minutes I got to tell him
[2:05:07] what it was to be an end time Christian
[2:05:10] amen that was a man that got the full
[2:05:13] answer from start to finish
[2:05:14] amen he got an in his written answer as
[2:05:16] to why I believe what I believe and what
[2:05:19] God has done and I was able to tell him
[2:05:21] testimony after testimony of the things
[2:05:23] that struggled with him the deliverance
[2:05:24] God has given me and the healings that
[2:05:26] I've had and my wife has had in children
[2:05:28] and these different things and he sat
[2:05:30] there and at the end he said look I can
[2:05:32] disagree with what you are like in terms
[2:05:36] of the logic of what you say says but
[2:05:37] the only thing I can't disagree with is
[2:05:39] what he says the experience he says when
[2:05:41] you tell me about these healings in what
[2:05:43] Nadi says I can't dispute that and he
[2:05:45] walked away and that was that and it
[2:05:47] flow mixed him a little bit because he's
[2:05:49] so used to having people argue but when
[2:05:51] you start talking about the effect of
[2:05:53] what you believe now all of a sudden
[2:05:55] that changes things amen and that's what
[2:05:56] we want to share him and we're an
[2:05:58] endtime bride that's expressing Christ
[2:06:00] so our answer is not just in words but
[2:06:02] our answer is in a life lived before
[2:06:04] each of these amen amen we want to cut
[2:06:09] through that confusion the cloudiness we
[2:06:10] want to get to the heart of the issue
[2:06:11] because when people are asking those
[2:06:13] questions they don't want to understand
[2:06:15] they don't want to get to what it is you
[2:06:17] really believe they just want to pin you
[2:06:19] down amen second Timothy two verse 14
[2:06:22] says of these things put them in
[2:06:23] remembrance charging them before the
[2:06:26] Lord that they strive not about words to
[2:06:28] no profit so we're talking now about
[2:06:29] what the overcomers answered their
[2:06:32] conversation amen that they strive not
[2:06:35] about words to no profit but to the
[2:06:38] subverting of the hearers now what it
[2:06:40] says is don't get caught up in arguments
[2:06:42] that have nothing constructive there's
[2:06:44] no good that they're looking to get out
[2:06:46] of it they just want to have an argument
[2:06:47] and it says what the effect of that is
[2:06:50] the subverting of the hearers and what
[2:06:51] that means is the conquering and the
[2:06:53] overcoming of a consecrated spirit so
[2:06:56] when you get into those kinds of
[2:06:57] arguments what does it do it starts to
[2:06:59] break down your consecration to God why
[2:07:01] because you get caught up in the logic
[2:07:04] and you get caught up in the argument
[2:07:05] and all of a sudden confusion and doubt
[2:07:07] set in faith starts to go away and all
[2:07:09] of a sudden you're not sure where you're
[2:07:10] standing and then what happens your life
[2:07:12] slowly starts to roll away from the Word
[2:07:14] of God amen
[2:07:15] so what out that to tell us what our
[2:07:17] conversation should be amen now when we
[2:07:19] talk about conversations we have to
[2:07:21] expand it a bit these days because we
[2:07:23] don't just have conversations in person
[2:07:25] anymore on the phone doing we have
[2:07:27] social media now so you're gonna have a
[2:07:29] conversation on Facebook on Twitter on
[2:07:32] Instagram everything that you put on
[2:07:35] there is a conversation potentially so
[2:07:37] everything we put on there the question
[2:07:40] is is it there for no profit or is it
[2:07:43] there to inspire confidence in the Word
[2:07:46] of God is it there to grow people or is
[2:07:48] it there to cause confusion to cause
[2:07:50] dissension to cause argument you know
[2:07:53] and these sorts of things can be tough
[2:07:55] on zealous people because even when
[2:07:56] we're putting things out there whether
[2:07:58] it's in conversation or on social media
[2:08:00] what we like to put things out there
[2:08:02] that are a little bit edgy that kind of
[2:08:04] get in people's faces a bit but that's
[2:08:07] not always the wisdom of God I don't
[2:08:08] believe and then we want to do what we
[2:08:11] want to draw people and if we offend
[2:08:13] them if we get their guard up in front
[2:08:15] by saying things so bluntly sometimes
[2:08:17] what does it do it makes us of no or
[2:08:19] little effect amen continuing on there
[2:08:23] in second Timothy verse 20 sorry verse
[2:08:26] 15 it says study to show thyself
[2:08:29] approved unto God a workman that needeth
[2:08:32] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[2:08:34] word of truth but shun profane and vain
[2:08:38] babblings for they will increase into
[2:08:41] more ungodliness now profane means
[2:08:44] common or on how old or ungodly and vain
[2:08:47] babblings are empty discussions
[2:08:49] discussions of useless matters amen what
[2:08:53] a conversation stopper that scripture
[2:08:56] ought to be amen if we said is what I'm
[2:08:59] talking about is what I'm doing here
[2:09:01] gonna lead to godliness or is it just
[2:09:04] gonna lead to vain babblings jumping to
[2:09:07] verse 23 again same chapter it says but
[2:09:09] foolish and unlearned questions avoid
[2:09:12] knowing that they do gender stripes
[2:09:15] now not just asking them but answering
[2:09:17] them as well and if there's one thing
[2:09:19] that there's a lot of it's foolish and
[2:09:21] unlearned questions today because you
[2:09:23] get people that'll get online they'll go
[2:09:25] look up something on Google they'll
[2:09:27] listen to something Joel Olsteen says
[2:09:28] and then they'll come at you guns
[2:09:30] blazing thinking that they've got a bone
[2:09:32] to pick with you and they have never
[2:09:33] opened up a Bible they've never read it
[2:09:35] from Genesis to Revelation they never
[2:09:37] stepped foot inside a church much less a
[2:09:39] message Church they have nothing but yet
[2:09:41] somehow they feel qualified to challenge
[2:09:43] you on what you believe amen
[2:09:44] scripture says don't have anything to do
[2:09:46] with it and not only that but those that
[2:09:48] know what you believe talking about
[2:09:50] those that have left the message and
[2:09:52] they try and trick you and they get into
[2:09:53] conversations ours is not to answer them
[2:09:56] pulse it after the first or second
[2:09:57] admonition walk away
[2:09:59] that's our instruction is not to sit
[2:10:01] there and get into arguments about what
[2:10:03] we believe say if you want to if you
[2:10:06] really want to end it say the Lord
[2:10:07] rebuke you and they'll be so unhappy but
[2:10:08] never come at you again I think but
[2:10:12] listen to this verse 24 still in 2nd
[2:10:14] Timothy it says the servant of the Lord
[2:10:16] must not strive but be gentle unto all
[2:10:20] men apt to teach patient the servant of
[2:10:25] the Lord must not strive strive means to
[2:10:27] fight engage in a war of words to
[2:10:29] quarrel to wrangle dispute what is
[2:10:32] wrangle me they wrangle horses right
[2:10:34] horses that don't want to be caught they
[2:10:36] have to wrangle them they have to put a
[2:10:37] rope around them sometimes they have to
[2:10:38] trip them up and knock them down so that
[2:10:40] they can get a saddle on them and start
[2:10:42] to ride them amen
[2:10:43] so you're not supposed to wrangle but
[2:10:45] you're supposed to be gentle to all men
[2:10:47] apt to teach and patient amen are you
[2:10:50] gonna be seen as gentle and apt to teach
[2:10:52] when we're putting inflammatory posts on
[2:10:54] Facebook when we're writing emails and
[2:10:57] passing on information from this one or
[2:10:59] that one no you're not going to get
[2:11:01] there amen we need to be gentle we need
[2:11:03] to be what patient that's what Paul says
[2:11:07] gentle apt to teach and patient that's
[2:11:09] the way our conversation that's the way
[2:11:11] our answers are supposed to be in every
[2:11:12] one of these situations
[2:11:14] Amen what does Paul policy continues
[2:11:17] what should we be striving for he says
[2:11:19] in verse 25 in meekness instructing
[2:11:22] those that oppose themselves in meekness
[2:11:25] that's how we approach this
[2:11:28] as if we've got Audrey thinking all the
[2:11:29] answers and we have it all and this that
[2:11:31] and the other thing he says in meekness
[2:11:33] what being humble gentle instructing
[2:11:37] those that oppose themselves what does
[2:11:38] that mean it's those that are doing
[2:11:40] themselves harm and they don't even
[2:11:41] realize it they don't even know that
[2:11:44] their lifestyle that their decisions are
[2:11:46] going to hurt them down the road he says
[2:11:48] what instruct the people that are
[2:11:50] causing themselves harm without
[2:11:51] realizing it what for what purpose
[2:11:53] he says if God peradventure will give
[2:11:57] them repentance to the acknowledging of
[2:11:59] the truth he says if you go in with
[2:12:01] meekness maybe just maybe God will give
[2:12:04] them a repentance to the acknowledging
[2:12:06] of the truth he'll let them see the
[2:12:08] error of their ways and stop making that
[2:12:10] mistake stop living that life come
[2:12:12] around to the truth of the gospel amen
[2:12:14] so what's our goal then our conversation
[2:12:17] our answer when we see people that are
[2:12:19] walking in a way that is going to cause
[2:12:21] them harm that's gonna lead to pain and
[2:12:23] suffering down the road even though it
[2:12:24] may cause temporary pleasure and gain
[2:12:26] what do we do
[2:12:27] gentle apt to teach patient and meek
[2:12:30] that should be our approach amen why so
[2:12:33] that way God can potentially use us to
[2:12:36] draw them to the gospel amen so many
[2:12:38] believers have no clue how damaging they
[2:12:41] can be when they just get all up in
[2:12:43] somebody's face about those things well
[2:12:44] you know better you ought to know better
[2:12:45] don't you know the scripture says this
[2:12:47] no gentle app to teach and patient amen
[2:12:51] listen to this in 1st Peter 3 verse 15
[2:12:54] we're very close here to the end a man
[2:12:57] says but sanctify the Lord God in your
[2:12:59] hearts and be ready always to give an
[2:13:01] answer to every man that asketh you a
[2:13:04] reason of the hope that is in you with
[2:13:07] meekness and fear Amen people wonder why
[2:13:10] we are the way we are they look at us
[2:13:12] and they see you know our sisters in the
[2:13:14] way they dress and it's strange to the
[2:13:15] world if they're dressing right amen
[2:13:17] they see that the beliefs that we hold
[2:13:20] and they look so old-fashioned but they
[2:13:21] also see the integrity the honesty the
[2:13:24] dependability the hard-working nature
[2:13:26] hopefully of the true believer and they
[2:13:29] wonder what is it what is it that drives
[2:13:31] these people to do it and even though
[2:13:33] they don't understand they wonder and
[2:13:35] say what is it that pushes that person
[2:13:37] to live that way amen and Brett and the
[2:13:39] scripture says you have
[2:13:41] to have an answer be able to give an
[2:13:44] answer to every man that asks you what
[2:13:46] is it that's inside of you and you can
[2:13:48] tell them of the hope that we have Amen
[2:13:50] through Christ in the baptism of the
[2:13:51] Holy Spirit in our lives look at Jesus
[2:13:54] like I said he never yelled at Satan
[2:13:56] when he was answering him in this
[2:13:58] temptation he didn't rail against him he
[2:14:00] didn't say like I said you're going down
[2:14:01] to the pit of hell and your times coming
[2:14:03] he didn't have to do that and guess what
[2:14:05] we know where we stand and we know where
[2:14:08] people stand if they don't come to this
[2:14:09] message if they don't come to to a
[2:14:12] relationship with Christ so we don't
[2:14:14] have to beat them down amen this is the
[2:14:16] only pleasure potentially they're going
[2:14:17] to get in life as if they enjoy life
[2:14:19] here because afterwards it's not going
[2:14:21] to be a whole lot of fun so what do we
[2:14:23] need to do rest where we are and invite
[2:14:26] them into that place amen how do we do
[2:14:28] it rightly divide the word of God
[2:14:30] rightly apply it with the right attitude
[2:14:32] and the right spirit that gives an
[2:14:33] invitation amen
[2:14:37] first Peter 3 continues in verse 16 this
[2:14:40] is speaking of the believer after you
[2:14:41] give a reason of the hope that is in you
[2:14:43] with meekness and fear it says having a
[2:14:45] good conscience that whereas they speak
[2:14:47] evil of you as of evildoers they may be
[2:14:50] ashamed that falsely accuse your good
[2:14:53] conversation in Christ amen what so that
[2:14:56] people when they look at you they say
[2:14:58] yeah no you know what they do live the
[2:15:01] life amen they do walk the walk they
[2:15:03] don't just talk the talk but they walk
[2:15:04] the walk he says let your conscience be
[2:15:06] clear when you give that hope that what
[2:15:08] you have a life behind it that when they
[2:15:10] try and talk evil no it doesn't hold off
[2:15:13] they meant brother Bram says this and
[2:15:15] the conflict between God and Satan he
[2:15:17] says but God at the beginning gave his
[2:15:20] children the atomic weapon because he's
[2:15:21] the infinite God he said now seeing
[2:15:24] there was going to be a conflict in a
[2:15:25] battle God equipped his children with
[2:15:27] the right kind of ammunition the right
[2:15:30] kind of an attack the right kind of
[2:15:31] everything that they had need of that
[2:15:33] would sweep them all the way from Eden
[2:15:36] to the rapture amen hallelujah all the
[2:15:38] way from Eden to the rapture what was it
[2:15:40] the word that's what defeat Satan is the
[2:15:43] word it'll defeat him anywhere any place
[2:15:46] listen as he says now why do we want to
[2:15:49] substitute something else when we've
[2:15:51] already got the best thing there is the
[2:15:53] word
[2:15:54] amen Smith Wigglesworth I hope it's okay
[2:15:57] to quote somebody else brother Andre
[2:16:02] from Quebec shared this with me and I
[2:16:03] thought I'd share it with you mrs. Smith
[2:16:06] Wigglesworth says how can you enter into
[2:16:07] a life of faith all lack of faith is due
[2:16:11] to not feeding on God's Word you need it
[2:16:14] every day what a brother Graham say you
[2:16:16] want to get close to God read your Bible
[2:16:18] and pray feed on the living Christ of
[2:16:21] whom this word is full of if I am to
[2:16:24] know God I will know him by his word I
[2:16:26] know I shall be in heaven but I could
[2:16:28] not build on my feelings that I'm going
[2:16:30] to heaven I'm going to heaven because
[2:16:32] God word says it and I believe God's
[2:16:35] Word and faith cometh by hearing and
[2:16:37] hearing by the Word of God
[2:16:38] how shall we reach this plane of faith
[2:16:40] let go your own thoughts and take the
[2:16:43] thoughts of God the Word of God if you
[2:16:45] build yourself on imaginations you will
[2:16:47] be wrong listen to this you have the
[2:16:50] Word of God and it is Enoch they meant
[2:16:54] everything our conversations our
[2:16:57] confession our discussion our opinions
[2:16:59] needs to be pulled through the Word of
[2:17:01] God Ephesians 6 verse 14 says stand
[2:17:05] therefore having your loins Girt with
[2:17:08] truth now what the loins is where what
[2:17:12] comes from life comes from if you're a
[2:17:13] man the loins is where life comes from
[2:17:15] amen and the scripture says the life
[2:17:17] that we give out needs to be guarded by
[2:17:19] truth our source of life has to be
[2:17:21] guarded by truth in other words our life
[2:17:24] shouldn't be coming forth without it
[2:17:26] being accompanied by truth they're there
[2:17:28] they're tired together amen so I just
[2:17:32] said that our confession our discussion
[2:17:33] our opinions it all has to be pulled
[2:17:35] through the filter but it's not just
[2:17:37] that but it's the things we share it's
[2:17:38] the things we post it's the things we
[2:17:40] endorse all of those things need to be
[2:17:42] pulled through the filter of the word
[2:17:44] amen so we know that the word is a seat
[2:17:47] I mentioned that brother Branham spoke
[2:17:48] of it earlier in in in one of the quotes
[2:17:51] I read and we know that our words are
[2:17:53] also seeds amen the life that we gave
[2:17:56] out is in what the word that we give
[2:17:58] amen and our word the word is given by
[2:18:00] words we speak it and we live it so our
[2:18:03] conversation needs to be guarded by
[2:18:05] truth and pull through that filter
[2:18:07] single time so that means then that when
[2:18:09] we're giving an answer when we're
[2:18:11] putting our words out when we're putting
[2:18:12] out our testimony when we're putting out
[2:18:15] our beliefs when we're putting out our
[2:18:16] opinions let me take it that far then it
[2:18:19] has to be what filtered through an
[2:18:21] accompanied and aligned with truth
[2:18:23] that's what Paul's getting at when he's
[2:18:25] talking in Ephesians there amen that's
[2:18:28] what makes us trustworthy and that's
[2:18:29] what makes us consistent is when we pull
[2:18:31] everything through the filter of the
[2:18:33] word why because if it's true then it
[2:18:36] has to fit through the word amen
[2:18:38] so when we see situations rise with
[2:18:40] those trials and troubles like this
[2:18:42] corona virus pandemic whether it's
[2:18:44] Church issues and politics tend to creep
[2:18:46] in whether it's family issues and old
[2:18:48] history and and you know the personal
[2:18:51] flaws that our family knows we have so
[2:18:53] much when it's all of those our
[2:18:55] conversations need to be guarded by what
[2:18:57] truth we need to pull it through the
[2:18:59] word so it's not gonna be it is thought
[2:19:02] or it is my opinion or the best minds in
[2:19:05] the world think but rather it should be
[2:19:07] pulled through it is written amen and
[2:19:09] not just it is written one scripture to
[2:19:11] try and pin someone down but it is
[2:19:12] written from Genesis to Revelation amen
[2:19:14] the word should tempore the way we speak
[2:19:17] to each other and the conversations we
[2:19:19] have and the things that we endorse in
[2:19:21] the opinions that we put out there a
[2:19:22] ment really we shouldn't have an opinion
[2:19:24] we should have the Word of God and that
[2:19:26] is what we believe and that's what we
[2:19:28] express amen we don't want to be taking
[2:19:30] sides we don't want to be spreading
[2:19:31] rumors amen we don't want to get caught
[2:19:33] up in the experts here and they say this
[2:19:35] and that you know what we all have
[2:19:37] people that we listen to that I would
[2:19:39] say aren't necessarily under the
[2:19:41] headship of Christ we have experts
[2:19:43] whether it's you know a Dave Ramsey or
[2:19:45] something like that and whatnot we need
[2:19:48] to pull all of those things to the Word
[2:19:49] of God it's not that it's bad but we
[2:19:51] need to make sure that we don't just
[2:19:52] quote them because they're good at this
[2:19:54] and we just leave our the Word of God on
[2:19:56] the side and not pull it through it amen
[2:19:58] amen so what do we do every answer every
[2:20:02] answer that Jesus gave was what it is
[2:20:05] written so brother Matt when we lose our
[2:20:06] jobs what do we say it is written psalms
[2:20:09] 37:25 i have been young and now I'm old
[2:20:12] but I
[2:20:13] yet I have not seen the righteous
[2:20:14] forsaken nor his seed begging bread amen
[2:20:17] when we face sickness our answer is what
[2:20:19] it is written isaiah 53:5 but he was
[2:20:23] wounded for our transgressions he was
[2:20:24] bruised for our iniquities the
[2:20:26] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[2:20:28] and with His stripes we are healed amen
[2:20:31] not just yesterday not just today but
[2:20:33] tomorrow it is a continuous healing that
[2:20:36] we have amen
[2:20:37] when we face sadness or despair we say
[2:20:39] what it is written Isaiah 60:1 3 to
[2:20:42] appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to
[2:20:44] give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil
[2:20:46] of joy for mourning the garment of
[2:20:48] praise for the spirit of heaviness that
[2:20:50] they might be called trees of
[2:20:52] righteousness the planting of the Lord
[2:20:54] that he might be glorified amen
[2:20:56] when we face difficult decisions and we
[2:20:58] aren't sure which way to go what do we
[2:21:00] say it is written Psalms 37 23 and 24
[2:21:04] amen the steps of a good man are ordered
[2:21:06] of the Lord and he delighteth in his way
[2:21:09] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[2:21:11] cast down for the lord upholdeth him
[2:21:13] with his hand amen amen that's all I've
[2:21:16] got is it he warmed up but I'm trusting
[2:21:21] you were encouraged this evening amen we
[2:21:23] want to we've been given a weapon that
[2:21:25] can't be defeated and all we have to do
[2:21:27] is use it and use it the way that we've
[2:21:28] been told to use it amen we want to
[2:21:30] rightly discern the word we want to be
[2:21:32] inspired by the Holy Spirit and we want
[2:21:35] to be able to rest on what God has
[2:21:36] opened up and what God has shown us amen
[2:21:38] we want to have rest that all that he
[2:21:40] said he's going to do he will do Amen if
[2:21:43] I want to say one more thing it is
[2:21:45] written revelations 3:21 and this is our
[2:21:48] scripture amen this is what I'm claiming
[2:21:50] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[2:21:54] stick my throne even as I also overcame
[2:21:56] and I'm set down with my father in his
[2:21:59] throne Eman god bless you richly thank

[2:26:46] he wanted me to send greetings to the
[2:26:47] Saints here and he
[2:26:51] I asked him how things were going there
[2:26:52] of course it was it was it wasn't so

[2:26:56] jury saw hunkered down and he and he
[2:26:59] said in his in his house in this
[2:27:02] apartment whatever but he said I he said

[2:27:07] was ministering to oh my I think twas
[2:27:10] three over three hundred ministry and
[2:27:13] brethren in another country what country
[2:27:16] was that I'm not sure I'm not sure in
[2:27:19] another country and he was doing it of
[2:27:21] course again it was online as IRA don't
[2:27:23] let our brother Jonathan ministering to
[2:27:25] us that he was ministering to them oh
[2:27:26] yeah because he I don't know if he had
[2:27:29] gotten to go to Brazil he was planning
[2:27:32] on going to Brazil before this
[2:27:34] coronavirus struck and so on so but but

[2:27:55] brother Bob so be in prayer and God
[2:27:57] bless brother Jonathan and his family
[2:27:59] amen
[2:28:00] god bless you
[2:28:09] amen praise the Lord I enjoyed it too
[2:28:12] it was wonderful absolutely wonderful
[2:28:15] praise the Lord
[2:28:17] one thing that there's a lot of things
[2:28:20] you said it struck me but one in
[2:28:22] particular he said when everything that
[2:28:25] were forgetting to quote everything
[2:28:29] falls together
[2:28:29] he said when when we find out who we are
[2:28:33] and that's what struck me was a father
[2:28:36] and said the same thing when the bride
[2:28:38] finds out who she is the rapture will go
[2:28:41] right so that and I think that's how
[2:28:46] close we are
[2:28:46] what more more and more the word is
[2:28:48] being revealed to us and I believe we're
[2:28:50] getting to that place so brother John
[2:28:54] told me what the sing about ten times
[2:28:57] throughout that sermon we even made more

[3:00:00] Lord for what we've heard over the past
[3:00:01] two nights and may God just blessed him
[3:00:04] and ministered to them and remember of
[3:00:07] course he believes and and brother
[3:00:10] Matt's need for work the course and

[3:00:54] it'd be nice to have ya okay
[3:00:58] no more than five people in the building
[3:01:00] right there most of the musicians here
[3:01:02] tomorrow night
[3:01:04] at 6 o'clock right
[3:01:06] and so just be in prayer for that and
[3:01:11] it's a kind of a virtual one so just
[3:01:15] pray for my voice that it it hangs in
[3:01:19] there so because it's more of a worship
[3:01:21] type of gathering and in lieu of having
[3:01:25] a fellowship at Build America single oh
[3:01:27] yeah and what we wanted is if you have a
[3:01:32] song in your heart or a course that you
[3:01:33] want us to sing just text probably
[3:01:35] better Matt and/or myself you can you
[3:01:40] can text us and we will get your song on
[3:01:44] the air for you so that's that's what we
[3:01:47] want to do it's not just me driving this
[3:01:49] necessarily or anybody else it's this is
[3:01:52] for the whole congregation so whatever
[3:01:55] you want song we'll do our best to to
[3:01:57] sing it and if the receiver if there was
[3:02:01] another prayer request that I have and
[3:02:03] it's the one that's been my burden and I
[3:02:05] think everybody else's and then I'm
[3:02:07] longing for today when everybody's back
[3:02:09] in this congregation and you know I
[3:02:13] don't want to be have to open the window
[3:02:14] on this side of the building and hear
[3:02:16] brother Chad you know and hallelujah
[3:02:18] from up there by Dominion I would rather
[3:02:21] have him you know
[3:02:23] okay to yell hallelujah by the way so so
[3:02:29] anyway being prayer for that I think
[3:02:30] it's important and I believe that's the
[3:02:33] desire of the de pride and I believe
[3:02:35] it's the desire of the believers in this
[3:02:37] church and we want to get together as
[3:02:39] one and worship the Lord amen so thank
[3:02:44] you for your attention tonight I trust
[3:02:47] it's all been a blessing to you and when
[3:02:49] you text for a song it it doesn't matter
[3:02:54] if we sang this song tonight or gonna
[3:02:57] mark you let it the night before if you
[3:03:02] want a song again we'll sing it again
