so we're just praying father may you just be pleased tonight with our worship Lord and Lord may we just hear from you tonight may you just completely help me Lord to get out of your way Lord so you

just praying father Lord may it just be edifying for all of us here myself included and we're just praying Lord for all the needs and those that need to touch from you those who are away Lord we pray your grace to them we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen all right let's turn to Psalm 1 Psalm 1 we'll begin with the first verse small crowd tonight we're one more than the Ephesian church tonight so but thank the Lord does not matter how many people are here as long as people are listening and pulling so the bird may be heavier on your shoulders tonight but please listen and pull uh verse one blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seed of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the UNG ungodly shall not stand in the in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish you may have your seats okay so tonight is part five in our study and we are finally talking about Nehemiah tonight it's been a long wait it's been a long journey okay but the foundation was needed it was worth it and it gives us a greater appreciation of everything that we are going to discuss here with Nehemiah I do not know how long it will take to go through Nehemiah I never know how long a series will ever take the girls can attest to that David took almost two years Abraham was how long almost a year and a half so 13 chapters can stretch a long way if you go by verse by verse but the beauty of it is that you you kind of squeeze all the blood from the turnip and every bit of goodness that you can get out of it you get out of it and I don't think the girls will ever forget anything about Saul and David forever now way I but you you get it's just there is something about just chewing it and chewing it and chewing it and you get a lot of goodness from it so I'm personally enjoying studying Nehemiah there's a lot that Nehemiah reminds me of this age and uh hopefully you'll be blessed by it I'm not going to be labor this because we've been through it a million times but last last time we talked about Ezra and how he came in a situation where again the children of Israel were kind of going off the rails going the same direction that they got judged for God brings a man a praying man a descendant of Phineas and he does essentially the same Deeds as Phineas um and what's interesting is that studying for this I stumbled across why Phineas had to do what he did and the Bible explicitly states that if someone is caught in the act of idolatry they are to be taken out and stoned immediately so that's essentially why Phineas was blessed in what he did it seemed extreme for everyone but there's a uh there's a reason why he did it and God blessed him for it because he followed the word to the letter and that was God's requirement for that sin and if he didn't do what he did they would have been judged the people would have been judged and you know ultimately it was atonement for the people so there's always a reason for Why God does things and we got to trust that even though it's it's like all those times he told David and Saul you got to kill everyone because at that time it's it's a it's an eye for an eye it's a tooth for a tooth and there's no Grace and during that time there's no blood buffer around the earth so when God sees sin it gets judged and that's why he always had to tell the the children of Israel everyone goes because little pagans turn into big pagans big pagans invade the land of Israel so there's always a reason for Why God does that does those things and you know the type for us spiritually is that little sins turn to big sins so all right so tonight we're talking about Nehemiah and during this whole process of building this Foundation it's understanding there's things that Nehemiah does that again are similar to what we just talked about they seem extreme they seem harsh but there's a reason for why Nehemiah does it so in terms of the the broad shokes of what we talked about we learned that there there's an original uh Commandment that Moses gives about idolatry and idolatry is you know there's a reason why you know the the first two Commandments are so focused on that because it's the most important thing you know Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might period no others and Moses when he was giving the word to to the children of Israel you have the initial bit in Exodus but in Deuteronomy is right before the going into land and he's repeating all this stuff and saying there's a ble Deuteronomy is a is is a book of blessings and curses blessings if you follow curses if you don't and they're going into the land which is the type of the Holy Ghost and he's saying if you do this you you live if you don't do it you die it may not be the same circumstances but it's the same seriousness that we deal with today if you don't follow the message of the hour it's a curse unto you and you see it with people who leave when they're in they may not be even filled with the Holy Ghost but they're still blessed because you're in the presence you're in that atmosphere of life and there's there the the what's what's the U the type of the the rainfalls on the just and the unjust and they both rejoice and there's a blessing that comes with it but once you get out of that atmosphere you don't people don't realize how much secondary blessings just comes from being in that atmosphere so in terms of what uh Moses discusses there he's saying it's very clear you have a path of life and you have a path of death and it's your choice and what's interesting is that he there there's specific things he talks to the people but he also talks to the the leaders and we discussed this W with David there was three things that a king of Israel was not supposed to do that Moses said and the first one was he wasn't supposed to collect unto himself wealth the second thing is that he wasn't supposed to collect unto himself chariots and horses and thirdly not to collect un unto himself wives okay those are the three things that Moses says do not do that okay wealth is an obvious reason for why and you saw it with Hezekiah Hezekiah collected unto himself and he got to the point where he shows the Babylonians all the wealth that he gathered and literally Isaiah comes to him everything that you've shown him will be taken away by these same men and it happened may not be it didn't happen in hezekiah's lifetime but it happened to his children and then in terms of Chariots and and all those things anytime Israel went down to and allied with Egypt during the period of the Kings they always paid for it because they're they're leaning on the arm of Flesh Jehovah wants to be the protector of his children and anytime you rely on the arm of Flesh you get in trouble and then finally when it came to the women what's interesting is that David actually starts the slide David broke the rule of gathering unto himself wives and the difference is that David starts off with good Godly women and God allowed it and it was a type of a multi-member bride okay but Solomon like the Next Generation takes it a step further and like anything what one generation tolerates the Next Generation Embraces and you see it you see the old gods you know I can name a bunch of things in terms of things are coming back and what one generation tolerates the Next Generation Embraces and you look with David it was nice and good good Godly women but Solomon takes it a step further right Solomon takes it a step further and it starts the slide okay and he breaks what the the the third thing that Moses said but he also breaks the Commandment of not following the gods of Canaan and also not into Maring with the Pagan women and we you know we've talked about a lot where that started the slaughter into idolatry and Solon goes from the person who is so blessed that the actual shik Glory comes down and so engulfs the temple that the priests have to stop speaking and worshiping because the cloud was so thick to a person offering food to an idol because he intermarried that that was a fall that Solomon did and there's Grace for Solomon you know it's kind of like Saul like they just get through the skin of their teeth they'll be over there but it's just by the skin of the teeth so Moses said if they obey that commandment they would be blessed and if they failed to obey they would be cursed and we saw that that the moment that that that commandment is disobeyed sin enters into the kingdom and it just starts breaking down everything the kingdom gets divided into two idolatry is widespread especially when Ahab and Jezebel come on the scene it explodes the amount of deprivation that happens just gets worse and worse and worse God has to judge them and because of that God has to judge it if they don't repent and they sure had plenty of opportunities to repent you think about all the prophets you had Joel you had Amos you had Obadiah you had habac you had Micah you had Zephaniah Zachariah hegi you had Jeremiah you had Isaiah Ezekiel all these men are giving opportunities for the children to repent and they don't so God cannot be blamed for what happened to them so we all know that everything leads to this where they get robbed of their independence they no longer have Independence up until the time that the Greeks are um defeated by the by the macbes and that's only always brief 100y year period and then the Romans crush them okay so they never really regained their independence only for a very short period the uh glorious Kingdom of Solomon was renowned in the land for all the riches and God blessed him and abundantly above and beyond anything he could ever hope or imagine and it all got taken away the 10 kingdoms that or the 10 tribes of Israel are so destroyed that they're dispersed to the four king four corners of the earth okay and really the restoration only really happens to the tribes of benjam and Judah because of how sold out to idolatry those 10 tribes were Jerusalem was burned to the ground as we as we can see here the temple was burned and destroyed the Ark of the Covenant was lost forever um which was huge because that was literally the the where the mercy seat was where atonement was and they lost that forever so it just the wages of sin is death and they lured that in Spades so but fortunately and thank God that this is not the end this is not the end of the story this is not the period this is the bottom of the barrel okay and because Israel did not learn and they did not heed they had to learn what the bottom of the barrel looked like but eventually they learned to appreciate what they what they lost okay because we saw in the Psalms as they were leaving Jerusalem they wept bitterly by the Rivers of Babylon we wept so they they learned unfortunately too late of what they had but thankfully God is a god of restoration and he would restore and we saw that through through men like zeruel and men like Ezra and Cyrus the Great that eventually it would become a city restored and built up like this so this is where we're heading is the city of Jerusalem totally restored totally protected totally blessed okay and eventually and the reason why God had to restore everything why he had to get Israel positioned place for the Messiah to come back and Messiah had to be clean or the the the kingdom had to be clean in order for the Messiah to come back okay so uh that is our quick review and that was our foundation that we've been building up over the last four uh Services four lessons rather and it's to show that everything in Nehemiah the burden that Nehemiah has is all because of what he learned from his fathers of what they lost and how important it was to stick to the law of Moses because the law of Moses for them is like the the what is the um preaching of the Apostle Paul for us everything that brother brandom taught is pointing back to what Paul preached when he went over on the other the curtain of time he said I only preach what Paul preached and everyone there screamed we're counting on that so for us everything that Paul preached is what we're we're we're aiming for is that first church God wants to restore back to that to that Original Seed in order before the Rapture can come and we got to aim for that so uh or before I get into that so Nehemiah like I talked before is the last uh technically the historical book in the Bible it's right before uh really the the the gospels after Nehemiah you have the Greeks defeating Persia as we see in um Daniel's Visions the Greeks get defeated by the M macbes then Rome conquers them and they're the ones in place from then all time it it never changes it goes from P Pagan Rome to Papa Rome Herod the Great then comes on the throne as a essentially a vassel uh for the Romans and he's just a puppet ruler and he's the one that actually um renovates zerubbabel's Temple and makes it what it was during Jesus time so it they he built out like the the plaza around the temple and made it a bit bigger and all that but the the the main core Temple was what it was with uh zerubabel and then finally the uh we we see the New Testament begin so that that is like a 400e period from when Nehemiah dies when we see the the first bits of the gospels being written okay so not much unfortunately is known about nehemiah's background uh upbringing or story or whatever when we come on to him we we see him where he was and we don't get to see it's like David like David's great because you can see when he before the prophet came to him so he you see him you know when he's not respected and he's not in any position of authority and he's not someone who who's a great man so you get to see the whole EV evolution of of David but with Nehemiah you kind of get see him when he's grown and he's established and all that stuff but that's okay so Nehemiah is not a royal okay zerubabel was was the prince zurubabel was was of the lineage of David he he if if if uh Babylon did not conquer uh Judah zuru probably would have been King okay okay and you look at Ezra Ezra is a prophet and you know God venerates His prophets but Nehemiah is a different sort he's not a king he's not a prince he's not a royal he's not a prophet he's not a son of a prophet he's not even a priest not a scribe not anything he's just a regular believer okay and the beauty about Nehemiah is that God used him in such a degree zerubabel was a starter okay he started the work but God needed a certain C personality to finish it and you see it God has different personalities and people for different positions for different reasons not everyone's a starter okay I can't start nothing if if if you give me a blank page and said you need to start from scratch with something I will be totally lost but if you give me something that's all right this is what needs to be done this is the end goal of what we need to do I can do to to my heart's content whereas Joe Joe is a great blank page person dad's a great blank page person I could never do it but God has different gifts different personalities different trainings for different reasons okay and it's it's where it's learning to work together in those gifts where Harmony starts to happen and where Harmony is growth can happen Okay when everything is working together is when we can start growing so Nehemiah was was was prepared and unfortunately we don't see all that training we don't see any of the training but he was obviously trained Because by the time you get to Nehemiah he's a mature established believer and there's not much you can touch on on neem nehemiah's life me and Dad were talking about it there's literally like there's hardly anything with neemi where you can say uh that that was wrong so he he's someone who who's just he was a prayer Warrior he he knew how to wait he knew how to wait for that hat to be in the right place in order to go and that's a sound of maturity that's a that's a sound of someone who who's whose ear is tuned to the voice of God because someone who is immature doesn't doesn't hasn't learned how to lean they haven't learned how to wait for the voice of God of like no no this is not the time yet your desire is good but you need to wait it's not the right time as some someone who's established knows when to wait for the right timing you may be the right right person but is at the right time and that that that takes experience that takes suffering to be able to learn that okay it's not a gift that stuff ain't a gift that like that that experience is not just laid on you from birth you have to suffer to to gain experience and this is what you see with Nehemiah it's someone who's obviously VI ly gone through the paces of learning the voice of Jehovah so and really that that's the whole aim of this study is is to show that it's not just the prophet of the age that God used it's not just you know brother Perry green or brother Lonnie Jenkins that God used or the fivefold ministry today God is wanting to use each and every member of the Body for a use and it's not just the fivefold ministry that is going to do these great works these signs shall follow them that believe who is them them is you them is me and the signs are not always the same we always put signs as Miracles but signs is just evidence what's evidence the fruits of the spirit it's it's the way you walk it's the way you talk it's a sign and it's an Evidence of who you are and and and I think you sent this to me about brother Lonnie used to say that you want to talk to the person who's experienced the most amount of Supernatural go talk to the housewife all the those little moments where they're they're in the house and they lost something they pray and somehow appears or they're dealing with a child and God touches them and they're praying for their Lost Child and God brings them back it's it's it's those people who are working silently in the background that more often than not God is using the most cuz you look at it motherhood is the back for said is the backbone of the nation you break motherhood you break the nation and we've seen it today and it's just you look at all these Great Men of all the ages you point back to them it's a great mother behind them you look at Samuel you got Hannah praying one of the greatest prayers of the Bible and that woman who has yearned for years to have a child and she she yearns and she goes to God and she asked him please if you can just give me a child I'll give him right back to you and from that the moment that child is born and is is of age that can go to the temple she gives him back to the Lord and God says here's all the kids you want and that child goes on and is the greatest Prophet since Moses cuz he gets he gets Israel back in line for Who David who's going to be the line of to the Messiah without without Samuel there's no David and it's because of that one woman you look at Yosh without Yosh there's no Moses without Jesus without Mary there's no Jesus that poor 15-year-old girl experiencing shame like no 15-year-old girl should ever experience but she for because she believed she believed that the impossible was happening you don't know if she even knew the scripture that a verion shall conceive what she said was insane any logical person says you're insane and yet it was true and without her there's no gospel do we venerate her like the Catholic Church does no but we honor her I believe a huge portion of way of heaven was was a son to Mary what she experienced was she perfect no by no means but it's these mothers these often ignored mothers it's the backbone and you have no idea how important it is because almost every great man was because of a great mother you look at Charles and John Wesley she had how many kids 13 kids or whatever and she would set aside time every day to teach those children about Christ so the whole point of the study is that God is wanting each and every person to be enabled okay it's not just because you look you look at what what the spirit of Christ has been battling for 2,000 years it's the spirit of nicoladis it's the spirit of balum and what's the spirit of nicoladis nicoladis it's conquer the lady it's to remove the lady from the equation and what's tied to the spirit of nicoladis is the is the doctrine of the trinity because what the Trinity does is that it removes God in phases in vessels to God just in three three people it takes away a personal God working in a people it completely robs people of the identity it puts God up in heaven and we're just Sinners saved by grace no it's God changing deities changing phases and it's God in Me therefore as sacriligious as it sounds I am God because Christ said it you are many gods so between the Trinity and the spirit of n nicoladis it completely takes a it it totally breaks the power of the church denying the power of thereof because it says it's not God in you and the power is only to the priesthood so that's what you see today in in the in the modern church it's a a a church with no teeth they're powerless I I I was listening to a song today and you look at the way they're worshiping it it's just like turn it off because it was ridiculous the way they were getting on it was just this is not even emotion this is weird and that's and that's what they call light now what are you Conjuring and that's why you got to be careful listening to some of that stuff because just they're tabbing into something that's strange it's strange fire some of it's fine but a lot of it is Strange Fire so that's what God is is is has that's what God is restoring to us today is that there's a a people who are vessels for Christ to work through and it's not just the ministry thank God for the Tim puits thank God for the Donnie Reagan but it's the brother Dale's the Brother Davis the sister Brenda that God is wanting to work through as well in equal measure because it's going to be a strong powerful Victorious bride at the end we are not it you because the type is Israel in uh Canaan other than that one slip up with uh uh aen other than that one slip up they are unbeatable that's who brother bandam said we were Ephesians types Joshua we will be unbeatable and anyone who tells you any less it's not matching up with what I see in the word because the prophet said she's going to be invincible so is it going to take time yes that's the whole point of restoration restoration is bringing you back to that the first church it's like um I was reading brother Bram said at the beginning God waved Christ over over the Harvest okay it was the very first to come up but it had to die and now that same the first one to come up really was brother brandom he came to maturity first and God waved him over the people saying it's coming it's coming it's coming and everything that you saw in him you'll see in US maybe not to the same obviously degree but you'll still see it like um like the T Vision it will be sometimes hidden just between you and God but it's just as strong just as powerful and it's the same life it's the same life all right so perfect strength by Perfect weakness the important thing one of the most important things that we must Master now remember this and especially young preachers and lay members alike lay members is just a normal believer someone who is not a minister there's one thing that we got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot that where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us that's right one of my favorite quotes second that's what we need to do have to do today that's what I need that's what every man needs is a loss of himself loss of his ability loss of what he is that he might have a complete yielding to the Holy Spirit the housewife needs that the school boy needs that even our little children no one is exempt and what's what's interesting is by him saying you need to lose the thought of human ability that means that God can use down to the little child once that child is aware so that's why we got to be careful in terms of dealing with the young that you're not crushing because the young ones are the young sprigs and without realizing it we can stunt we can stunt growth if we're not careful so that's why you got to be um you got to be mindful you got to be mindful of the Little Eagles so really the the whole aim here is to show that like Nehemiah is a Layman he's a regular believer he's not a priest he's not a scribe he's not a prophet or a nobleman he is a normal believer type of us and God used him tremendously tremendously and the whole point is that if he can use a man without the Holy Ghost in such a degree how much more can you use one of us a housewife School child you know whoever it may be he can use you it's not just for the ministry that's the worst thing we could do if there's someone sick you remember that story of brother brandham there was a a woman he was going to pray for and before that happen and and she was she was in the prayer line after it but a woman next to her kept on feeling pressed pray for her pray for her pray for her she couldn't shake it so she just puts her hand on her like I just feel pressed to pray for you and she's like sure she prays for her nothing seemly great happens that woman that got prayed for goes up to brother bandam and he said why you're up here you're you're healed and then the Holy Spirit discerns it and goes wait a minute you were prayed for by that woman there he said the moment you prayed for her she was healed so why is God allowing that that that to happen is to show that like that woman is tapping into the same resource that the prophet is it's not brother brandom it's not brother brandom with magic hands it's brother brandom getting out of the way and allowing Christ to work through brother brandom the same way that woman is stepping out of her way to allow Christ to work through her it's not it's not just for the man it's for the woman it's for the child it's for anyone who has been filled with the spirit because where he is there is life and when there's life there's evidence of life is it all the time no is is everyone here going to raise the dead probably not is everyone here going to stop the weather probably not but there are there where life is it expresses itself it has no choice but to express itself you light a match in a dark room it bursts with light can't hide it okay so Nehemiah was a man of prayer and of great discernment okay you see it he sees through all these tactics of the enemies and we'll get to that obviously in time but overall he led Israel with great wisdom you very wise man so the the major themes in Nehemiah there two major themes obviously restoration is the overall overarching theme it's uh because it's not just the walls that he restores it's it's the law the law of Moses gets restored the uh tithing gets restored uh he also um or no I'm getting that mixed up with the the rich were oppressing the poor with interest they they they were putting Shackles on it which is against scripture interest was for the stranger not for for the believer if the believer put interest on another believer it was it was an offense against God so there was a bunch of those things that he he he um he cleaned up so he was a He restored all of it physical spiritual all of it and you know we we see that like God had had begun that process of restoration through zerubba with the temple and then Ezra with the with the the Pagan relationships and God was wanting Nehemiah to complete the work that they started and the way that Nehemiah restored Jerusalem was it wasn't like a a miraculous thing it was very boots on the ground it was one stone on top of the other there was a lot of sweat involved in in in the restoration involved with with Nehemiah but it was nonetheless miraculous he finished the work in 52 days the temple took four years he didn't in 52 days so little is much when God is in it and it it doesn't matter how insignificant the the process of one footstep looks in the process of your restoration one foot is one foot that was recently Devil's Ground so you know with us each day if we're as long as we're ining forward is a victory God it some days it may be you know a couple steps but as long as you're facing the right direction your heart is aiming in the right direction and you're inching forward if you can't run walk and if you can't walk crawl and The Crawling days look like defeated days but it's still progress okay so it's um you know as we learn you know restoration is is is it starts the moment that you really give your heart to the Lord but it really starts when you get filled with the Holy Ghost because the moment that he he fills you entirely he's now in the position of headship which means now he's at the head and now he's going to move you forward and it's like a a great great sermon is uh doors and door because brother R talks about there's one door to your heart but there's many doors in that heart and it's what God is doing is that over time he's opening up more and more doors to have access to your life okay because if he worked on on us immediately and in in every area we would just be a grease spot because it would be so painful and he he's not going to give you more than you can bear so that's why he restores over time because he does he works with the lowest hanging fruit first he he what is the most what are the things that are going to cause the most hiccup immediately that's what he starts working on first because that's why you see even at an elderly age a Believer still is supposed to be worked on if they're honest because everyone is in sinful flesh this is not going to be restored here but inside should be and the Soul should have dominion over this it doesn't mean that you know you're going not going to have your hiccups and all that stuff but it should have dominion so you know it's uh I've said it before leacy is the age of restoration brother random said it it's the time where everything is coming back to what it should be there is the word has been completely released on the church today and the only thing holding back God is your permission it's your permission you're the only reason why you're not further ahead than what you are and it's the harsh truth because if you're struggling with something have you given it up have you given access for him to do it and the way it works is that the more you go to God the easier it gets to go to God and then the more he can start working on you so overtime is a process of restoration it's every area it's not just church it's your marriage it's your finances it's your kids it's your career it's the way you do your career it's where you live it's how you live it's what you look at is what you read it's what you watch it's what you listen to it's everything he's restoring everything he should be restoring everything okay because it has to be a Victorious prde at the end does it mean that you are sinless no but it should mean that you have dominion and what God is doing is that slowly by little by little like the scripture here in Deuteronomy verse 22 and the Lord thy God will put out those Nations before thee little by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the fields increase upon thee but the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed and he shall deliver the Kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under Heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them and what's interesting here is that he's talking about and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and we saw that come to pass with he puts the five Kings into the cave locks them up kills the whole Army comes back to the cave and says to the captains now put your no you put your foot on their neck okay and what was the reason for that Joshua is saying to the captains you have power over these Kings now they were once your enemies they no longer have power over you and God does the same thing when he delivers delivers you from say a struggle with something he'll lead you back to that thing and he'll show you your neck now is on your foot is on that that Demon's neck it's done it's over and he'll show you it's done because more often than not we we don't we don't believe that we have the ability to do it in ourselves we we don't doubt God but we doubt The Vessel and what what what does God allow in those moments he's saying no no you you have power over this thing I have given you the authority over this thing and it's your job to put your foot on it okay it takes suffering you have to dig oh my if you only knew it's not easy anything that's hading to you on a platter you don't enjoy it certainly you can't appreciate what's given to you God told Moses and said I give you Palestine I've swept out all the houses and hung up the curtains you all just go right up and live there would that have been it they never would have they never would have enjoyed it he said I'll give it to you it's full of giants you'll have to fight every inch of the way whatever Place The Souls of your footsteps that's possession go take it sure as I'll be with you that's the way Divine Healing is that's the way the Holy Ghost is everything you could walk behind you it's footsteps his possession keep walking keep going that's the way you just move your finger couldn't move move it at all you move that much today move that much tomorrow and that much more the next day just keep on moving moving moving footsteps is possession because during that time you know Israel learned that God would provide for each enemy and for each battle cuz I think John has said it that not every battle was the same some were like Jericho but some they they sieged and it was a time before it went away they starved him out and each one was different and what what did that require that required trusting Jehovah for what the next battle entails because we don't deal with every problem the same way we have to be led by the spirit and God gives us the direction that we need to defeat whatever is in our path and what does that do it it develops trust between you and God because over time you start to learn that God has everything in control faith is the master of all circumstances and faith is the entire leaning of the human personality upon God it's leaning entirely on God there's none of you in there you are not holding you up God is the one leading you so God you know in the quote here says it well that's the way the things of God are after you've trusted him and watched him do so many things till become like a regular and that's a condition I think the church will be in just before the coming of the Lord so the Rapture will just go on right on that way and it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of God okay because we are led by spirit and truth because there's going to be times where the scripture says it best where God leads you in strange ways there's times where you may not find an exact scripture for what you're dealing with okay but there may be a scripture principle that that applies to it okay cuz there's nothing new Under the Sun and there's a scripture for everything it just may not be like there's a scripture for your phone there's no but there's be ignorant be not ignorant of Satan's devices though that's pretty clear right but there's times where God's going to lead you down strange paths where it feels like uh Noah has gone down this path I'm sure but when he leads you through the valley of the shadow of death it may seem dark and lonely during those times where he's leading you down a dark Corridor and you can't see your way out but you got to trust that the tender hand of Jehovah who's LED you this far will lead you through okay and that's where it it it takes um it takes praying through because praying through is a lost art today people say that they pray but all really that they're doing is that they shoveled up their request up with God and said I've prayed about it and then continue the way that they want to go John has been saying all the time about you know you're you're directing God in that direction versus getting neutral and sitting and waiting for the answer and once you get the answer that doesn't mean you go you then pray through until it's settled once and for all and that's the Lost Art and that's what God is trying to get us to the point where you're sure Beyond sure that where you are is where you're meant to be because unfortunately if you don't do that you're presuming you're venturing without Authority and anything that happens to you when you're presuming is on you if you step outside of God's will in order to do something that you want to do you're outside of the protection and the authority of the word and you have no one else to blame but you if for any scars that you get turn that so it just the whole point is pray through make sure that where you're standing make your calling and election sure make sure what that what you're doing is Led of the Lord and we all have scars from that you got the evidence for it and hopefully you'll learn from it okay so the the the second theme of Nehemiah is is maturity and we see it in in in spad with Nehemiah in terms of how he reacts to situations okay Nehemiah is a veteran he's not a rookie in terms of how he reacts to situations because you see how he reacts when Trouble Comes he doesn't react he doesn't just fly off the handle his first thing is always go to God go to God go to God go to God and that should be our first reflex every time go to God there's a situation at work go to God situation at home go to God okay doesn't take long it's the ultimate insurance policy go to God you'll save yourself a lot of scars so with every obstacle that Nehemiah faces he goes to God and then God gives him the leadership that he needs and because he gives him the leadership he needs he has the faith to do what he needs to do no matter how hard it gets and how hot it gets because scripture talks about Nehemiah outside of Nehemiah of how it's going to be and was it going to be easy and maturity Comes A Time okay no one is born a veteran it comes with time it comes with experience it comes with suffering it comes from falling down and getting back up it comes from sometimes being over your head and you learn that even when you're drowning there's still Grace just like Peter because eventually this is where we need to go in Ephesians 4 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lay and wa in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ he is the head from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the Ed edifying of itself in love this is a body here that's mature that's in her in her place in her position she's not trying to steal Glory from the next person she is lo and step with the person next to her and she's staying in line and because of that the body the body is now in subjection under the head and the head can deliver commands as needed and it's effective the body then is effective it can be edifying and you see the basis of it speaking the truth in love the very end of it unto the edifying of itself in love it begins with love and ends with love okay brother R says in perfect faith without you can't have faith without love you can't have it it always starts with love why because God is love the only thing that will get over there is perfect love perfect faith and without perfect faith without love you can't have per perfect Faith so a son of maturity is someone who settled controlled and calm a situation arises you're not flying up the handle I'm not always the best at that okay when we're removing from our our house our apartment to the house I was flying around didn't have any food and me and Auntie Brenda comes over and like Paul just sit down okay have some water you'll be fine okay thank you and that's that's the that's the way we can be sometimes we're flying around trying to do everything and you're trying to figure it out and you know you just kind of need someone with a bit of experience be like you just you just need a cookie get your blood sugar up so that's the thing you know it's just maturity comes with this experience and we're not born with it it takes time it takes God putting trials on us and what it requires is constant trials constant heavier and heavier loads Joe always talks about his favorite scripture in Isaiah or it's in the Amplified I think and it says the Lord will harden you to troubles it doesn't mean it it's hardening your heart it's hardening you to the difficulty of the trial meaning meaning that God can trust you with more and more and you stay soft you you stay pliable and that's only the grace of God you learn it's you getting a tougher skin but still staying soft to your brother you know and that takes only the grace of God to do that because the what does the world get the world gets hard people go through incredible trauma and they get hard and they get bitter and they get and it's just angry the child of God does not get angry they shouldn't if if God is with them they'll they'll get hammered out but when when someone goes through a trial and it's hard and it's difficult once you're through it a child of God always sees and said it was worth every second it was worth every second that is only the grace of God that you can go through the most horrific thing and say I am blessed because of that and that's maturity cuz God God God is not going to be you know it's not like the education system today where it's just like here's a cookie for what you did good but I failed doesn't matter you go up the next grade God is not like that if you fail you go back to the back of the line and you do the test again and you go back again over and over and over until you pass and then once you passed that there may be a small brief moment of rest bite enjoy it while it lasts and then God will start hammering on something else again because the whole point is that our rest is not here in our bodies Our rest is over there but our rest should be inside throughout it and that only comes from him I love this quote and I tried forever to find it and I finally found it and I was so happy when I found it like you're learning to swim and you know you splash the water and go across the pool and I made her now after you learn to swim more graceful is the stroke and it don't wear you out so much see that's it you learn how to do it and cut every corner and make it better and that's more of an ease a little boy that never walked and would try to walk down the aisle here he would fall down a dozen times and be wore out before he got there but anyone who knows how to walk an athlete would walk right down that aisle and never even noce doing it at all well he had to start with that's what he is now well that's the same way with preaching Divine Healing or anything else as you go along you begin to learn and if you don't learn there's something wrong you got to learn and you got to learn how to accept God and what it really means and the whole point here is that you look at someone who's learning on the swim there's a lot of noise there's a lot of splashing there's a lot of mess but as someone gets experienced The Strokes get smoother they go faster with less movement I thing was you would always talk about Nate Nate swimming it would be a ton of noise and and movement and just and he's going as fast he can he's just this literally how fast he's going okay but someone you look at dad what the greatest moment my childhood we're at the cabin and Dad dives off the the deck dad never swam when we were kids so when did it was was it was an event dad dives off the warf and does a butterfly stroke the entire way across the pond and we were amazed at kid as kids because it was the most incredible thing ever but it was fast but it was efficient okay and that's the way a Believer should be as they grow those movements gets Tighter and Tighter you may not be it's not swimming obviously it means that like you begin to trust God more there's less complaining there's less whining there's less groaning there's less talking about the other guy and what he should be doing better there's less envying someone else's position like well I should be there there's less you know all the junk and it should be tighter more trust more peace more joy in in Trials as it goes on and if you're not learning that there's something wrong means that you're not you're not growing okay so that's the maturity that we looking at okay could have a bit more time I haven't even gotten in Nehemiah head okay it will be worth it all right Nehemiah we made it Nehemiah chapter 1 verse one the words of Nehemiah the son of healah and it came to pass in the month chisu in the 20th year as I was in shushan the palace the henani I one of my brethren and later on scripture it um it confirms that hanani is actually nehemiah's Blood Brother uh verse two that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men of Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped which were left of the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of captivity there in the province are in great Affliction and approach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire so this is a first introduction to the to the book of Nehemiah there is no Preamble there's nothing it's just immediate here's the problem okay and you know the obvious the problem the problem is very obvious with Without Walls you have problems okay in ancient times a wall was the most critical thing it protects you from your enemies all right right and and what did those Broken Walls signify so the the two things that are mentioned here is Affliction and reproach and affliction caused by the Broken Walls is that it left the people defenseless against their enemies most obviously it allowed weather to come in it allowed wild animals to come in thieves vagabonds there's no protection anything and everything can happen so what that causes for a people living there is great angst no one there is comfortable living there you're constantly afraid of what's going to happen you don't know if something's going to hit you from behind you're going to get robbed any second your daughter is going to get kidnapped or whatever it may be there is no peace whatsoever in the situation no peace and then in terms of reproach it says here that the remnant are are in reproach okay and a city with Broken Walls reveals a defeated people it's a constant reminder of what they lost of what they were and what they are now okay of people who are chosen of the king are living like a bunch of rats in a totally broken down disheveled State there's no there's no glory in that and the Jews who had returned in their to their Homeland were were were just they they felt unsafe and they felt humiliated in what position they were especially as children of the king we are descendants of King David Solomon the most glorious King in in that time and they are now living in Rabel okay and this reflected badly on the name of Jehovah okay because anyone who who's looking at that situation there's no way that that Jehovah is is is protecting them so God is obligated okay to take care of them so we're going to see what ne's reaction is here if we click okay verse four and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourn certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven okay so his first reaction is what he goes and fasts he prays he weeps he Mourns and finally he goes before the Throne of God okay so his his first reaction is really it's an immediate burden for the situation and the way burdens work is that you can't you can't just you know take someone else's burden or burdens happen they arrive okay no one forces a burden no one really asks for a burden if they're honest except for burden for lost souls that this should always be there but when it comes to our burden for a situation the those just arrive okay it do you don't choose it it chooses you okay cuz the same news that hanani his brother heard had no effect he just shared the news and went on but with Nehemiah it has an effect there's an immediate groaning in the spirit there and and with a burden what is a burden it's a thing that you carry it's a weight it's a there's a sorrow with it okay and that burden comes on Nehemiah and he feels the weight of it immediately okay cuz that burden chose him he didn't choose it he was just walking on his merry way and this burden comes out of nowhere okay and why is that where am I supposed to point God wants his people to pray and when Israel had got so taxed in such a condition that they could not go any further their time was fulfilled and their burdens was lay further than what they thought then and then they begin to pray and when the people begin to pray then God begin to hear it was time for God's word to be fulfilled and so when amran and Jose Yosh saw that it was time for the word to be fulfilled they went to prayer to God and it's usually those who pray is the one who's got the burden the one who gets something it's those who pray that's ordained of God to do so okay and you'll see it you'll see in certain situations that there will be news at land and you may be on face but the person next to you is just laboring laboring in prayer I remember I forget who it was but it was a young man he had a young family and he he other had like really late stage cancer and we a couple years back before I had kids and you know we were kind of keeping updated on it and I remember Joe Joe had such a burden for him and we we were at brunch and we heard we heard the news turn and Joe just immediately like I have I I I can't sit here so he went in the bedroom and he was in there for like an hour or so just crying uh crying and praying to the Lord and for me it was just like you feel empathy for the man and and and you pray but but that was it but for Joe it was just he L he was he was laboring in prayer he was in travail over this man and and I realized it's just like Joe can Joe has kids Joe is almost the same age as this man and he knows what this man is feeling in this moment he doesn't know if he's staying or going and for me I felt bad cuz I didn't have the same level of of of Burden but the burden chose Joe at that moment and it's not always the case there's things that I have a burden for that Joe may not have and there's nothing wrong with either because God has specific people for specific purposes okay and you'll see it like there's one person meeting this need but I'm meeting another and you know Amber may be meeting another need that I can't do because God has trained her for that purpose and what that does is that every person is now in lock step with each other to the ultimate edification of the body no one is crossing each other up they're not fighting they're not fighting for the other role because they know that if I stay in my place everything will work out perfectly because it's the head that directs the body if we can get in subjection to him everything flows everything flows because he is the head of of the body not us if we get in the way it's a mess total mess so there's a need Nehemiah here's a need okay and the beauty of a situation is that all God needs in a broken situation is one person one empty vessel not empty in the sense they don't know have the Holy Ghost no one empty vessel that's ready and prepared for service they are ready to go into action they're just not being used yet and that's all God needs he needs one praying man and it wasn't going to be a prince again it wasn't going to be a prophet it was going to be a lowly cup Bearer someone whose job was to taste the cup of the king to make sure it wasn't poisoned someone whose job was daily death because at that time assassinations were you know regular occurrence so his job every day was just am I going to die and God chose him for that moment and the key was is that Nehemiah was yielded he's a yielded vessel he's ready to go into action I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William brandham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William brandham knows nothing about thank God for an honest Prophet God's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them like at Pentecost what did he do it taken them 10 days to get all emptied up and when they was all standing there with their vessels turned up and God took himself and filled them up that's all they shook the world God poured himself into them and that's the thing we may not be empty vessels at this point because any child of God who is filled with the Holy Ghost should be filled but there's constantly refilling you look at the book of Acts right after the acts two it's like either two or three chapters after you have Peter and James and all them going back we need more of the spirit and they see them they get down again and God refills them in again then they go out out cuz they needed more boldness they knew that they didn't have all that they needed and God fills them up again and that's what we need for what we have need of God will start filling us because the way it works is that you got to empty out of yourself for God to fill up more and a constant it starts with us emptying out and then he fills in more there's too much of us there's too much of me and me like brother saying there's I'm the one that gets in God's way because there's too much of me cuz we have him in measure we don't have in like Christ had him in fullness but every day we got to empty out a bit more so he can fill but the beauty the beauty of God God is God is uh he's the master builder and he's the one that's he sees he sees down the road this is the role that you need this is the role that you're meant for and between now and then he has it perfect laid out for you to start being molded and shaved down and cut down and emptied out for you to be ready for that role you I I look at you know John brother John as as one of the greatest examples I've ever seen that he goes out when he's young and every situation that he's in is grinding John down it's preparing John for the current role that he's in at the moment did John realize what he was in probably not did he know that he was going to be Pastor probably not but each of those things that he went through is preparing him to be of service to have the character and the majority to be able to handle situations that come his way and it only takes God to do that and that's why you got to thank God for the fleas you got to thank God for the situations that you come in that you're just why am I dealing with this it's training it's all training and the sooner you realize that it's training the sooner you'll be more content and more joyful count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations It's just that's the whole rule you got to be joyful because it's for your edification no chastisement at the time seems nice but it has a an eternal blessing attached to it so God had chosen NE Nehemiah for this moment and was going to use Nehemiah to shake the world okay so before Nehemiah ever began to the to rebuild that wall he start started working on that wall 800 miles away on his knees that's where he started working on that wall cuz because you see it when as he starts praying there's already a desire in there for him to finish the work he knows it's him somehow he just it falls on him and he knows I meant to do this uh can go a bit longer or we good 834 go a bit longer nemiah verse uh 1 verse5 and said I beseech thee Oh Lord God Of Heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth Covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his Commandments let thine ear now be attentive and Thine Eyes Open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which I pray before thee now day and night for the children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of Israel which have sinned against against thee both I and my father's house have sinned We have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the Commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments with thou commandest thy servant Moses remember I beseech Thee the word that thou command thy servant Moses saying if ye transgress I will scatter you abroad among the Nations but if you turn unto me and keep my Commandments and do them though they were of You cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet I will gather them from from from then and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there now these are thy servants and thy people whom th Redeemed by thy great power and by thy great hand oh Lord I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's cup bear so that phrase right there and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man this man is the King of Persia okay what Nehemiah is asking here is Grant me favor with the King because I'm in a position where I can talk to the king but give me favor so nehemiah's approach to God what is it correct you have to come with the right kind of approach to God if you come selfish if you come in any other approach but the right mental attitude towards God or any Divine gift you'll never receive any benefits from it you've got to come with your surrendered all to God just remember now as I go on record in these tapes I say this with all my heart that if any persons will take the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise that God has made it'll bring to pass if you could take the right attitude toward what he said it'll bring it to pass because you're many creators as a man thinks in his art so is he life and death lay in the power of the tongue so what you think and what you confess is what will happen if you confess the negative it will happen What joob feared Came Upon him but if you confess life it will bring more more abundantly okay because it's like the first scripture that we said he should but like a tree planted by the rivers of water whatsoever he doth shall prosper why because he's plugged into the the water of life and in order for you to to to overcome yourself your atmosphere has to be right okay what you think has to be right it has to be the word what you confess has to be the word right because you look at today there's a perversion of that today and that is the power of positive thinking and I have family members who are like it who it's just I can do it I can do it man every day and there just it's constant just driil it's con it just I could I had no patience for it because it was just like because you they would say it to me like yeah man if you can just do it and just think about it and manifest it man it's going to be great and and just you look at that person's life it was why because it's all sails and no anchors it has no anchor there's no Foundation to it there's no life behind it it's driil it has a power for a season because that's why people do it because they're they're they're finally not thinking about their problems but eventually it caves in on them but the true biblical version of that is keep your mind stayed on me and I will keep you in perfect peace that's the biblical version of that and what's the difference is that it's tied to a Life Source the the power that created the heavens and the Earth that has no obstacle known to it that can defeat any attack of the enemy so if you confess the word you're tapping into creative power and then you're getting into Eden territory story where you're now taking dominion and the thing about it is that it's the whole principle of say to this mountain and the principle there is that the the Clause there is that it's not immediate it could be immediate but more often than not it's not it's sometimes just a trickle of sand at the base of it that's movement so the principle is speak to this mountain and keep speaking unto it until it moves and then once it moves then you move past it to the next mountain and you speak against that and that and what what and what happens that if like when when when you're in a situation that seems hopeless it seems so mechanical but it's like praising the Lord when you're cold and starchy you can get in a situation where it just it feel you feel stiff being in the presence of the Lord but if you yield it was interesting Saturday night I was uh praying next to the uh next to the wood stove and um there was a an ember that fell out from the last time I I uh stoked the fire and it was completely and totally cold about this big totally cold and it was one of those moments where it just like I I felt it was like a lesson in the making I didn't realize at the time and I I I picked it up and I was like H I wonder how fast it'll take for this to get back to where it should be so I open up and toss it in real roll Hawk coals in there nice fire I toss it back in there and I'm telling you within 7 Seconds that thing went from straight black and cold to burning hot no difference between it and the other Embers it went from being totally useless and alone by itself to now producing the same amount of heat as the other ones that have been in there the entire time why because it was in the presence of life it was in the presence of heat and it couldn't help but push out the same as everything else what was the difference it was just in the wrong position that was the only difference so you take a Son of God who's pulling themselves away from people from fellowship from whatever it may be you're starting to to cool down and you're going to start to get cold you're still a Ember you're still part of the family but you are withdrawing yourself whatever it may could be hurts could be complexes it no matter what it is no matter the the reason may be you are pulling yourself away and all it takes for you is to get back in the presence just long enough for you to catch fire again it's all it takes for a person for a Believer it doesn't take long at all for you to go from cold and starchy to Red Hot and blazing as long you get in that presence okay so whenever someone who's been out for a while or they just haven't been you know praying as much as they have been or feeding on the word and just they just feel all stiff and and locked up it God is Not punishing that that that that fire knew no difference all it did was just here's the Heat now push it out yourself and that's the same thing with God God is Not punishing you he wants you back in the saddle he wants you effective you're more use being where you need to be than just sulking in the corner just get back in the saddle it's all it takes I just I when when I saw I was like that is amazing it was so fast so fast but it doesn't take long if you if you're cold and serge you get back in the presence you you watch you look at special meetings that's why special meetings are so important because the heat is pushing out it's blazing hot you get someone who's cold and searchy it will just peel off of them and it's liberty it's total Liberty so in terms of nehemiah's approach here he he approaches God wonderfully because he begins first with reminding God that you are a covenant keeper you made a covenant with Moses okay that if we would do if we would sin you will punish us but if we would repent you would accept us back and restore us so he reminds God of that first secondly he repents of the sin of Israel and he puts himself in that repentance he says I have sinned and my fathers have sinned so he is putting himself back into the correct position by repenting thirdly he reminds god of the promise of repentance through the word of Moses if we acknowledge our sin and come back to you you will take care of us and that's what we're doing and then fourthly he then makes his his request known to the Lord to Grant him mercy and favor in the sight of the king so he waits until the very last before he comes to God with his request he doesn't come in kick in the door and say I need this and then walks out that is not the correct approach to God the correct approach to God is humility he is the king of kings and he deserves due respect he deserves your time and he deserves unrushed time too often are we the two second you know Grace in the five minute devotion prayer and we're out if we have time to spend hours on this he deserves unrushed time so Nehemiah was willing to take the time to with a correct approach to God because you remember in ancient times the approach to the King was life and death if they didn't approach in the right way it was life or death so with that principle of Mind Nehemiah is coming humbly to Jehovah saying you are the great king you have made this Covenant may I remind you this Covenant and what he's and what he does is that he opens the channel for the blessings that flow because he's now taking the right approach to God he's having the right mental attitude towards the promise that Moses gave by which God would start answering okay and it's the same thing for for us you don't have a casual callous relationship with him we approach god with reverence we approach god with humility we approach him with love and that's the key is that if you want anything from God you can't just you don't treat God like a vening machine you just don't give him your demands and leave he is your husband and he deserves your time and when more often than not he doesn't he doesn't need all the time in the world he just wants some of your time and I've seen it the the the most sweetest times if I just go to God and say God I just need a little bit of time with you can you just spare me some of your time and I'm telling you it's almost every time presence comes down because it's just he wants to talk to you talk to him and at the end make your request known but spend some time with him first and what that what happens there is that yes he's Jehovah Gyra for you but more what he is more and more he's your bridegroom and what's the most important thing to fall in love with Jesus because it's relationship relationship is what differentiates us from anyone else because you get over on the white Throne what's what's what's the differentiator I don't know you you haven't spent time with me you haven't accepted me because you look at it that that scripture about those seven women that went to that man we want your name but we want to have our own money our own house our own independence and that's the church today they want his name but none of the headship none of the rulership they want to be saved but they don't want the rulership so what God what what does God want he wants to save you and he wants to he wants to lead you cuz he knows that outside of ourselves we would be aess mom if you want to come up you can come up I'm going to have to cut it off there God wants a relationship most most most of all because he wants what what what was the the three-fold purpose of God the last one was to have a have a bride that loved him that was a family that would rule with him forever that was his ultimate purpose and that's what he wants from you now is to have a relationship with you because without a relationship you have no Authority No Authority you have no power and without power you have no effect so God is God is leading us to realize that without him everything is empty everything is vain and if you're holding back on him and you're his he will ensure that you learn that it's empty without him and you'll go through the the the the School of Hard Knocks and you'll be you'll have no one else but to blame but yourself but eventually if you're his you'll get back into that condition of subjection and once you get back into subjection full blessings flow without that subjection there's no you'll have some you'll have some blessings CU you're a Believer when you're when you're in the at atmosphere there's there's benefits but if you want full blessings to live above your privileges rather than the below subjection subjection to Authority when that happens everything happens all these things shall be added unto you and that takes time that takes experience to learn to get back into subjection when you get out of his will cuz all If we're honest it happens to all of us and it's his grace for him to teach us and we can stand let's pray dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for your presence Lord we're just thankful for all that you've done for us here tonight we're just praying Lord may just help
