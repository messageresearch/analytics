me amen lord bless you and god bless brother chad amen praise the lord he wants he agrees with me that's his way of saying amen amen so be it so the lord bless you and uh we pray the grace of god to be with us in the remainder of this service as we go into the message that i've been referring to i've been talking about spiritual your spiritual or religious and my intention was to bring some thoughts from the message spiritual amnesia so we're going to let you hear the message and of course not all of it but we'll just start after the prophet reads the scripture and i'm going to read that scripture right here and we'll finish just before he goes into a prayer line and again it's uh it's a birmingham series of messages that he preached in 1964 amen so i pray the grace of god to that you're going to pay attention to what he's saying and you're going to let god judge you by what is being said and that's the truth you're standing you're in the altar now you're in the hour of judgment amen god not judging just judging the world there god's judging us amen by the word probably god said that when the ministry of the words so now he says but remember this judging that this person that person and so on and we've got to recognize it receive it and repent of it and move on by the grace of god it's not that we're lost but it's just that god wants to correct us so that we are going to truly represent him as sons and daughters of god not sons and daughters of william branham no no sons and daughters of god amen so by the grace of god the new birth your new birth really proves it what you really are are you even born again of the of the letter of the word or you feel you've been born again by the by the power of the anointing and spirit of the word amen so let's make our calling and election sure again again to remind you that the power of god in preaching the minister the message of three kinds of believers he had a reason for doing that because he wanted the people to judge themselves is that me well judge yourself by the word is going forth over the pulpit lord is that me am i lacking that am i going too far with that and so on so i pray the grace of god that in in the hearing of the of the message three kinds of believers you determine which one was you amen that's what he wanted to do now he said there's believers are you a believer but he said there's unbelievers and there's make believers so what are you i'm sure that he was ministering to to those that that were make believers he was ministering to others that were unbelievers amen it's like i said that when the power of god preached the message church order amazing when he preached it and a lot of the people left bradham tabernacle because they didn't agree with what he was saying in church order but he again he had a reason for preaching it he had a reason for saying what he said and really he was judging he was judging those that were professing to have the gift of prophecy the gift to do this to gift to do that and so on he knew that it was a wrong anointing amen so that's why he preached the way he preached that's why he laid it out the way he laid it out concerning church order amen and we know that he totally done away with what we used to have in denominational or protestant churches for years and that was a testimony meeting oh yeah i remember that in growing up in the salvation army in pentecost and for the most part it was in those those churches and similar churches that they would go in and they would start singing they have a song service and then they they get a brother or sister to come up and lead hymns and choruses for a testimony meeting and of course it wasn't the best because i i remember even in pentecost one time that that the the rabbit testimony me and this brother testified testified and then somebody else started a chorus to sing them down because they were going too far with their testimony amen and i've of course experienced that even in pentecost and so on so we got to the place where the testimony meeting was out of order amen and that's the way it was in tabernacle but he wasn't going to put up with it no no that's why he did away with testimony meetings amen and i remember having experience testimony means in believers churches that i did approach the pastor i said brother one thing you need to do i said stop testimonies i say get rid of it why because i've experienced it there in certain believers churches and this believer get up while he's supposed to testify but all he did was preach oh yeah it wasn't just a brief testimony for the glory of god and what god did no no he started to preach i said brother stop your testimony meetings i said get rid of it i said because because why because i really saw the pastor there sitting on the pulpit sitting on the on the platform and with his bible and notes in his hand and he would wait for two or three hours oh yeah wait for two or three hours before you get to the pulpit and i said brother it's about time you stop those things as you've got to give more time to the word of god amen praise the lord so i pray the grace of god amen that we saw we know who we are as a result of the message of three kinds of believers do you really really honestly and sincerely know who you are amen did you find out that oh oh thank you lord i'm a believer amen praise the lord welcome my brother kingsley and uh he said oh but he knew there were a few believers there but he knew for the most part they were make believers and unbelievers amen as i said quite a few after he preached that message church ordered quite a few of them quite a number of them just moved out of that church and into another brothers church amen as far as i know that other brothers church is still there and we'll be in prayer for the for the voice of god and those in branham tabernacle because right now they are going through some a lot of construction work and i believe that the services are cancelled in brown tabernacle and also in the new building that they built or that they bought rather and it was an arena of some kind where they used to play certain games there but the voice of god bought the building and they used it for sunday night services or some no sunday services and because why because those that came on sunday uh were such numbers that they could they couldn't set them all in branham tabernacle brown tabernacle would seat around 500 people but the new building would allow them to have over a thousand people that would come for a sunday service so we pray the grace of god to be with them and give them his leadership in their construction so brother god help us we're living in that hour now the last day brother we need to know who we are yeah and if whoever you are that's the faith you're going to have so are you a make-believer an unbeliever or or an absolute believer amen i pray the grace of god and ministry to believers amen and we're laying in the word laying in the word so it's to to us to i like believers so it's to bring out the the spirit nature and attitude of true believers amen well god says this and god does that before it's just there to get your reaction to bring out the reaction of his seed amen his sons and daughters amen so pray i pray the grace of god that we're going to react as seed of god we're going to react as as god is looking for sons and daughters to react and what to do and how to do it you know and so on he's looking at looking at your attitude amen again as i preached there a little while ago you're going people go to hell not because of what they did because what they didn't do amen oh yeah there's right there in the scripture where jesus sent those to hell and what is it because he said you didn't do it to the least of these my brethren he said you didn't do it to me amen so you don't think i'm a christian and i'm spiritual because i i believe the message and i do this and i do that well brother it's got to be as christ did amen make sacrifices for one another oh yeah give the preemise to jesus by the grace of god amen so the lord bless us so we're going to i'm going to let you hear and and again i think it might be an hour maybe not it's it's a short message so we're going to start after he read the scripture but we'll finish just before he goes into the prayer line amen and pray for the people so god bless you let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe amen brother well we got to believe the word believe it the way that god wants us to believe it and i believe in the way that man wants you to believe it but the way that god wants you and well what is the difference well one is intellectual the other spiritual amen because brother faith comes by hearing the word and you if you're hearing it the right way the way that god wants you to hear it it'll give you the faith that pleases god praise the name of the lord hallelujah only believe only believes yes all things are possible just believe [Music] amen [Music] amen let's believe his word amen hallelujah praise the lord [Music] only believe in your heart amen jesus is here amen believe that he's in you hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah it is christ in us the hope of glory praise the name of the lord hallelujah jesus our lord jesus christ is here [Music] amen amen hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah jesus [Music] lord i be amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah all thanks praise the lord all things are possible amen lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible [Music] lord i believe yes lord again lord believing the way that you want us to believe hallelujah no questions no doubt lord we just believe it is written we believe thus saith the lord hallelujah lord that it is the same yesterday today and forever lord that you are in your word you are in your word and you will be in your word so praying grace o god for the word in us praise the name of the lord that you have preeminence in our hearts you have preeminence in our souls our spirits amen father taking control of the flesh amen moving us on and getting us ready more and more and more for the resurrection getting us ready lord for the rapture amen that we would have that faith that we would believe that we are being raptured amen not when we will be but we are we are being cut up amen into heavenly places in christ so the grace of god lord jesus that you have the preeminence in our lives amen you have the absolute pro lord yes the absolute proof that you are with us and you are in us amen lord i pray grace that each one of us has got that faith amen christ in me the hope of glory the revealed word christ in us the hope of glory amen encouraging us to move on move on move up and look up because it's the hour for the change shall i pray in the name of jesus that we truly believe in the name of jesus that we are truly entering in lord by faith into the resurrection and the rapture we feel it's getting closer and closer and closer amen i must let go and let god have his way lord we know your way is this hour it is the resurrection this hour it is the rapture amen that is calling the bride to sit with you in your throne amen grace lord that we let go and let you have the way it's not what we want to do lord is what you want to do amen amen amen how you want us to do it where and when you want us to do it help us let go and let you have your preeminence amen that we have the encouragement lord that we are moving on into eternity amen not wondering what's going on in the world but lord we have the faith of what's going on in the bride amen oh lord to know that it's you to know that is christ in us the hope of glory amen it is christ in us the hope of the resurrection the hope of the rapture lord help us i pray in the name of jesus to believe it knowing lord that this is the final prophecy for the gentiles grace grace grace and the going forth of your word the receiving of your word i pray lord that each brother and sister will recognize that this word is for them amen and there's a reason it is to get us to look up it is to get us a man to have faith in what you have revealed amen so into your hands we committed lord grace again lord for the sick the lowly the suffering the grace of god to the believer my lord my lord my lord grace that will not be left behind in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen now i believe now i failed all things are possible amen amen amen now i believe amen now i believe now all things are possible now i believe amen praise the lord i want you to turn with me to the book of amos chapter one amen amen it's just a couple of chapters our books after this daniel series and thank you all for your prayers for our brother ellsworth he apparently he apparently expressed that he really enjoyed the fellowship and uh and staying with us he said brother he said i feel like i'm home and he said that's good i really appreciate that amen so keep him in prayer he's had the surgery and he is due back again in about i guess three weeks to see the doctor that performed the surgery so we pray the grace of god be with him and to bring him to complete recovery amen by the grace of god so that just just keep one another in prayer grace grace grace well if i tell you this if you're born again you've got the spirit of christ in you you're you're going to have the same attitude as jesus said he was right there for you right there for me have you really considered taking as serious what he has done for you it's amazing i pray gracious we've got the revelation and it's going to make us more and more humble considering what the praise that he paid for your redemption of mine brother he cried and cried what what a burden was on his heart and he cried and cried and prayed and prayed and prayed amen i took finally on on the cross he bowed his head he gave up not my will but thine be done the will of god for our redemption that's what it was all about so thank god that jesus did what he did just think he suffered for you to redeem you how much are we willing to suffer for him god help us in the book of amos chapter 1 let's see okay i don't know where the prophet was okay verse six thus said the lord for three transgressions of gaza and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to edom but i will send fire on the wall of gaza which shall devour the places thereof amen and i will cut off the inhabitants or inhabitant from ashdod and him that holdeth the scepter from ascalon and i will turn mine and against echaron and the remnant of the philistines shall perish saith the lord god and thus saith the lord for three transgressions of tyrus and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they delivered up the whole captivity to edom and remember not the brotherly covenant but i will send a fire on the wall of tyrus which shall devour the palaces thereof thus saith the lord for three transgressions of edom and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he did pursue his brothers his brother with the sword and did cast off all pity and his anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath forever but i will send a fire upon demon which should devour the palaces of basra thus saith the lord for three transgressions of children of amen and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof amen excuse me and concerning what god has spoken concerning the hour and the in the world we're living in he will not cancel it and again there's something i want to also mention some other time because there was a somebody asked me about it and it was is what the scripture says about god repenting they said you mean to tell me god got to repent well i said got to be the way that you that that he does it spiritual i said let's let's see what's going on let's see what it means and i said i'll share with share it with you later amen and there are a number of references there in the bible where god repented god repented of this repentance of that and they felt that if he was god why would he have to repent well that's another thought i guess i'm going to have to share with you amen and share with you those scriptures and explain to you what it is amen it's not the repentance that he's looking for in you and me not by any means amen thank god all right let's go to chapter 3 of amos and beginning to read at verse 1. hear this word that the lord hath spoken against you o children of israel against the whole family or all the tribes which i brought from the land of egypt saying you only have i known of all the families of the earth amazing therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed amen if we got the same spirit we'll agree amen humbling ourselves one to another in the fear of god so he said can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing can a bird fall on in a snare upon the earth where no jinn is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing of all shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid amen shall there be an evil in a city and the lord hath not done it surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amen the lion hath lord who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy god bless his word to our hearts and this was the word the scriptures that the prophet of god read as he proceeded to the message on spiritual amnesia amen so brother i pray the grace of god give us the understanding that we need and to give us yes what we need personally amen that we're going to pay close attention to the preaching of the word the ministry of the word amen but let's recognize what's there for us let's recognize what's there for me was there for you amen so that's unfortunate that down through the years that in the preaching of the word the ministry of the word that that people have failed to recognize oh well the lord is talking to me the lord is correcting me the lord's encouraging me through the preaching of his word most just think well pretty he's going to preach and this is what he's going to preach and it's over with now so we can have sing and sing and go home yeah that's because they're they're they're religious but there's nothing spiritual amen so i pray the grace of god be with us that we'll have a revelation and understanding of the spiritual things that god wants to impart to us maybe there's something in this message amen that you want he wants us to apply to our lives not just say i believe it in my you know i believe it i believe it it's mostly in the head but brother if you believe it in your heart you're going to apply it to your life amen that's the thing but most people think i'm all right i got nothing to worry about jesus did it all yeah but what are you going to do now he's looking looking for christ in you you're going to make the same sacrifice as christ did in in the flesh now it's in your flesh by the grace of god but again people don't consider it so i pray that the lord will speak to our hearts amen that will suffer for him as he suffered for us amen but i tell you and again the scripture encourages that that as as believers we're there for tribulation we're going not to great tribulation but it's tribulation everyday living why because of our stand for the word because of our stand for jesus we're going to endure this and endure this and endure that amen i tell you what we've got to do we've got to lay our lives down in christ amen by the grace of god so they're not living for ourselves we're living for jesus that's the truth oh brother it makes no difference where it is how it is you're living for jesus so lord and that's why we always say not my will thine be done amen so you've got to find you believe this is the will of god as i said before that the lord led me to do this i did it and the lord opened the door for this and i went in and he opened the door for that i went in and he's trained me in this and trained me in that amen by the grace of god why because he felt that before it was all over i would need this training i would need this experience in dealing with the things that i'd have to deal with for these last 50 years amen that is the truth so god is training us and god is training you amen by his word because brother i tell you and closer we get to the resurrection rapture the greater and greater the separation oh yes it's going to get greater and greater so i pray the grace of god help us yeah it says the closer we get to the resurrection rapture the separation from unbelief will become greater yeah by the grace of god but what we need to do in those circumstances when we're experiencing these things we got to remember lot's wife don't and all that you're you're enduring and stand you're taking for the word don't endure don't don't forget lost wife and turn around look back at this oh i'm gonna look at this i guess i gotta see this i gotta say no keep on going you put your sight up there don't turn her back amen so remember lot's wife by the grace of god amen so we'll go from here into the ministry of the prophet and again it's 1964 and it is about a year after the opening of the seven seals so god bless the word to our hearts amen and again let's see if we are spiritual or just religious amen god help us god bless you brother put the tape amen tomorrow don't forget it tomorrow at two o'clock and now our next service will begin next week in tampa florida now i want to speak on spiritual i need amnesia now this little fellow that we're talking about amos just for a moment to get our background before we get to the text this was during the time of the great prosperity in samaria israel had prospered they had really went after the world and it prospered not always prosperity is a sign of spiritual blessings but sometimes on the contrary people think maybe you have to own a lot of worldly goods and shows that god's a blessing that's not true sometimes it's the other way but we find him we don't know much about this little fella he we have no history where he come from we know to you according to the scripture here he's a herdsman but god had raised him up i can imagine seeing on one hot day in samaria there that one of the great tourist cities of the world that day something on the order of would say miami or or hollywood los angeles some of them places like that some great place for tours and we can just imagine seeing it never been in such a city but he had the word of the lord he was coming to this great uh city where sin was heaped on every side the ministers that all got away from the word of god and they hadn't had a prophet in long years and so this little fellow as he topped the hill just uh kind of north of samaria i can imagine seeing the hot sun shining down his grave whiskers over his face his little eyes narrowed his little ball head shine as he looked down upon that city his eyes narrowed he wasn't looking at what tourists usually see to go to a city to see all of its enchantments of beauty he looked and seen what a sight that that city had become a city that once was a city of god and had gotten such a morally decay is that no wonder this little unknown fella was amos the prophet and now we don't know very much about him we don't know where he come from prophets usually come on the scene unknown leave the same way we don't know where they come from where they go know about their backgrounds god just raises them up he wasn't much to look at but he had thus saith the lord that's the main thing of course he come to samaria to begin his campaign i'm sure he had no cooperation from nobody he had no fellowship card from any uh denomination he had no credentials to show what group he come from and but he had one thing he had the word of the lord for that city and i wonder if we could transport amos today down to our time i wonder if he'd be welcome in our city today i wonder if we would receive him or would we do just like they did we find our cities in the same decay and we find that sin is just great among the people as it was then and i wonder if this little unknown man how is he going to start this campaign how where is he going to begin at what church is he going to or who's going to cooperate with him he had nothing to show where he come from he had nothing at all but thus saith the lord for the city he found them so decayed and so morally corrupted it was a great time the women in that city had become almost like they are in the united states they had become corrupt everything that god had expected out of them they went right the other way and and we'd find that it was a great place where they had dancings on the street the women immorally stripping their clothes and so forth like striptease of course that was a public amusement now days now it's every day just let the weather get hot and you don't have to go to any shows you're all on the street anywhere anyhow shame on you women to do a thing like that you ashamed yourself and um and then i said that to a woman here not long ago and she said why she said uh brother branham said that that's uh uh that's just like the rest of women i said but we are not supposed to act like the rest of the people we are different we are uh a different character reminds me of a woman said well brother branham another said i i don't wear those sharks that i wear slacks i said that's worse god said it's an abomination a sight for a woman to put on a garment pertains to a man it's exactly right one said well they don't make any other clothes they still make sewing machines and have goods there's no excuse it's just what's in the heart that's what shows out it it identifies itself and now we find in this city it become morally decayed the preacher's afraid to say anything about it and uh but they had a little fellow coming up over the hill was coming to tell them thus saith the lord clean this thing up or you're going to go into captivity and he lived to see the days of his prophecy fulfilled he prophesied in the days of jeroboam the second which was just a outcast anyhow he favored the other nations and and lisa amos prophesied and told him he said the very god that you claim to serve he'll destroy you and he did and if his voice would be here tonight in birmingham it would claim the same thing to the churches a very god that you claim to serve will destroy you someday i'm not speaking to this audience here these tapes go around the world now remember that is true then he found out when he come into the city that he all this stuff i wonder how he must have felt to look and see that decay of the people of god to whom he was sent uh i wonder if we would receive him now if he'd come in would we would we cooperate with him would we give him our our best would we give him our attention would we repent if he told us that we should go back to the word of the lord and do the way the lord said i wonder what our sisters would do about their bobbed hair would they let their hair grow out again if aim is gone he'd preach it now i'm telling you that because that's the word of the lord i wonder if our if our boards have put out deacons as married three or four times and and so forth like that trying to be deacons i wonder if all these things i wonder what he would do to man that would let his wife wear sharks and get out in the street out there and mow the yard out in the yard when man is passing by i wonder what he'd say to man like that amen you certainly blast it with all that was in him or he had thus saith the lord and he couldn't do nothing else but that he found them in that day with the bad case of a disease spiritual uneasy and that's just exactly what we got today now how did he know what was going to happen how would amos know first he was a prophet and the next thing he knowed by the disease what the diagnosis was and he know what the results was if a doctor looks upon a malignancy and sees that that malignant untucker hold he knows there's nothing but death left that's all unless god does something about it well when you look at a city and you look at a people you look at a church and look at a people it's so far away from god there isn't nothing but to diagnose but sin the wages of sin is death it's dying the diagnosis proves what it is you see when people get away from god and won't listen to the word have no more desire for the word then there's one diagnosis to it the soul that sinneth that soul shall die unbelief shall separate you from god that's exactly right but he knew what the disease what the results was when he seen the disease of of sin in the city now this amnesia we told it is a a cause you to be to a place where you can't not identify yourself now it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the causes is from shock it's somebody that don't even know who they are they find it from war sometimes the soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing causes it is weary where he will cause it where he has no virtue to it at all it's it's skip wary accept faith someone said well my wife you're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry i said no don't think so why i said worry couldn't do enough but make me worse well what good is going to do to have faith i said it might deliver me yes sir see so where he has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue believe now weary sometimes calls it and another thing that causes among the people is getting between two opinions that'll cause amnesia and it uh gets you to a place where you you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you can't make you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you can walk around eat and everything but you still you can't identify yourself you've got your scholarly education you can same education you had but you don't know where it come from you don't know who you are where you belong that's amnesia so we're told we are identified uh with our families in this human life by marriage and with our wives we marry and our families identified by the union of our our marriage and then what to think what if this horrible thing would happen to you and you wouldn't be able to remember who you married who's your wife which is your children who is your father and mother who is your neighbor that would be a horrible thing then we are identified again can identify ourselves in the human race by having intelligence and being different from the animal life the animal cannot think he just goes with sounds he has no soul and but we're animal life what makes us different we're a mammal but what that mammal is warm blooded animal and we are in the feature of animal but what makes us different we are identified by having a soul a conscience that tells us what's right and wrong now there is a place when you get this amnesia you might get like nebuchadnezzar was who exalted himself one time and god let him think he was an animal and he lived out in the wilderness and and eat grass like an ox and and his uh his hairs grew down his body like eagle feathers and he become the heart of a beast in him see that was amnesia because he had forgotten that he was a king he had forgotten that he was a human being and he thought he was an animal so he acted like an animal amen because he forgot he was a human being that's so easy today and we forget sometimes what the christian church is we act like the world that shows that we got spiritual amnesia because you don't act like the christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this here we uh we find that israel had exposed uh got exposed to the world and it fell into this rut and this prophet was sent to dig him out of it if he could and to tell him god by his grace chose israel from all the rest of the families on the earth grace had did that he had given them the choice lands he gave them houses that they never had to build god did that chose them he gave them farms that they never bought he he gave them he gave them food that they never planted you gave them wells that they never dug you gave them victories that they never won he gave them grace that they never merited god did that by his grace for this people israel his chosen his beloved and he said in the bible he found her in the field as a little girl sitting in her own blood and he washed her and cleaned her up and what he did but after god showed all these mercies to her and she got rich she got amnesia and these and she forgot all about where these things come from i think that's a picture of usa 1964. it's suffering with the same disease we're great powerful churches we're a great powerful people we're millions in number and we'll forget where these things come from they had a bad case of it after god had been good to him and brought him up from all the heathen lands and made him a separated people separated them to himself he said he took a vine out of another country and planted over in another country and how he fixed it around to make it grow fruit and be fruitful but the vine forgot where its blessings come from so has god's people in these last days has forgotten what the testimony of being a christian means amen it's again this amnesia has become upon the people they can't identify themselves they um they forgot all about it they forgot his holiness they had forgotten his law the women were living like the rest of the women god's church and his people has always been a separated people a called out people a peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to god the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name god called his church and separated from the world for that very purpose and he given a law and he it must be holy he said i am holy and you must be holy and without holiness no man shall see the lord god said that himself and he called this people to be this type of people but they had forgotten about it they had forgotten his laws and they'd forgotten their morals the women out in the street israelite women out there each one expecting to to be conceived by the holy spirit to bring forth a messiah and then acting like that their character was terrible i want to stop here a minute to say it's the same thing among our peoples today who call themselves christians their character if you would only realize one time in the south i read a story from down here where when they used to have slaves they'd take those people and sell them on the market just like you would a used car and then there was a buyer a broker who would come by and pick up these slaves and trade them and just like you would a car or something and those slaves was away from their home country they were from africa the boers uh kidnapped him brought him over here to the islands and then smuggled into the united states and sold them for slaves from not jamaica and around now we find that those people were sad they had been kidnapped from their own home they've been taken out by an enemy and they were sad they'd never see their husband no more their wife no more their father mother their children they were absolutely they had to whip them with whips to make them work for they were sad people and one day a broker came by a certain plantation he saw a bunch of slaves out there working and he went in and asked the owner said how many slaves you got said about a hundred said you got in it you swap or sell he said yep said let me look him over and he went out the field and watched him and he seen him have to whip him around and that's why he saw one young man that didn't have to whip he had his chest out his chin up didn't have to whip him so the broker said i'd like to buy that slave and he said but he's not for sale he said uh well what's the difference of that slave said is that slave the boss or the rest of me said no he's just a slave he said well maybe you feed him different he said no he eats in the galley with the rest of the slaves he said well what makes him so different from the rest of the slaves he said well this i wanted to for a long time but one day i learned that over in the homeland where he come from his father is the king of the whole tribe and though he be an alien and away from home yet he knows he's the son of a king and he he conducts himself like the son of a king i thought but that if a negro coming from africa and noted his father was a tribesman and a king over a tribe what order to do to a christian that's borned again a man or woman that our father is a king of heaven and glory we should conduct ourselves as christian men and women we should act like a dress like it talk like it live like it though we be an alien yet we are a children of the king amen our character our demoralization in the days that we're living in now israel had dropped into that same rut and was all so immoral they forgot the laws of god thou shalt not commit adultery and i shall not covet thy neighbor's wife and so forth they'd forgotten those laws they they they didn't want it anymore and they uh they wanted to to be like the rest of the world just like the church has got today one time israel when he started wanting to have a king over it samuel told him the prophet which was sent to them he said now have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what come to pass they said no you haven't did i ever beg you for my food and money for your money to for me to live on no you haven't done that you never told us nothing samuel but what come to pass and you've never asked us for our money for your living but yet we want the king anyhow god said to samuel let them have him they didn't turn you down they turned me down israel had gotten that same shape now they didn't want god's prophets no more they didn't need them and if one would come and bring him the word and try to bring him back to the word they would reject it amen they always do it in that manner of corruption when the world and the church joins itself together then they don't want nothing spiritual they don't want thus saith the lord they want what they want they want the world and to say they're a christian and live in the world and live with the world and live like the world and still maintain their confession of being a christian you know the thing of this is spiritual amnesia that's exactly what it is they don't know who they are they've forgotten that what they're supposed to do if one would come today like that it would be rejected yes the same they had a bad case of it and so have they today they cannot identify themselves with the supernatural things anymore because they didn't want it the word the gospel they didn't want it sin disease had afflicted them and they loved that sin is pleasant to the unconverted heart it looks good to the unconverted mind but it's a way of death there's nothing left but death the wages of sin is death and you must reap them wages you've sowed to the winds and not reaping the whirlwind the spiritual signs and the preaching of an ordained messenger from god never stirred them anymore the women could laugh right their face and say i don't have to go hear such a stuff as that if that hasn't repeated again what is it spiritual amnesia exactly what it is they have forgotten that god and his word is the same and he cannot change it amen if the prophet rose on the scene in them days and give a spiritual sign a spiritual voice and get the voice of god behind it they'd only laugh at it and make fun of it you know the old sand fools will walk with hobnailed shoes where angels fear to try that's what this spiritual amnesia does makes people get to a spot to work they have no feeling on the inside of them they don't want nothing that's spiritual take a real spiritual meeting where the holy spirit's healing is sick and discerning the thoughts that's in the heart and put it in among all the churches it's a great rally out here in this stadium and look what would happen in a few minutes everybody be getting up walking out they have nothing to do with it they don't want nothing to do with it they'll listen to some intellectual talk but when it comes to the power of jesus christ and his resurrection and the holy ghost they want nothing to do with it because it condemns them it sets them a fire but the thing that they ought to know no chastisement of course is pleasant for the season but if you yield to it it it brings the fruits of repentance so we find out when this spiritual amnesia get a hold to the people then they are they're in a bad condition now we find the same now now i want to you must be identified somewhere you must show your life shows tonight where you are identified you are identified either in christ or out of christ you are not halfway there's no such a thing as a drunk sober man there's no black white bird you're either a saved or you're not saved you're a saint or a sinner one of the other and your spiritual attitude towards god's word identifies you exactly where you're standing god's word vindicated proved that the baptism of the holy ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of pentecost or any other time and jesus christ is the same yesterday forever and your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual amnesia or not amen right no matter if you're a deacon even if you're a preacher it doesn't make you they get a two so we find out it's contagious and hits the whole thing now we notice now to be an american to be american i must be identified with my nation now listen close to being american when i am born here in this country i become a citizen and i'm uh identified with this nation all it is i am all that it has been i am for i am identified as an american then i have to take all of its shame all of its glory whatever it is i am because i'm identified with it amen amen i want you to get it i'm identified as an american citizen then all it was i am oh it is i am i must be part of it i've got if i'm an american citizen i'm part of america and all that it is i am i must never forget this if i want to remain a true american citizen i must remember that i am what my nation is for i'm identified with my nation to forget her or or to fight for her to die for her or to stand for all she stands for i must stand for it amen what my nation is i am what it stands for i stand for it to be a loyal american i'll be ready to die for it fight for it stand for it do anything there is i'm part of it you can't pick on it without picking on me when you say something against it you say it against me for i am an american said against you as american what they say against this nation they say against you for you are a part of it don't you never forget it when you do then you've got amnesia sure enough and remember you're no more an american citizen when you can't become a part of it you must be what america is you must be also i must be partakers of her this is my nation i must be partakers of her what she is i am see what she was i am no matter what she was i'm still what she was to be an american i landed on plymouth rock with her with the forefathers i had to i am part of her i wrote with paul revere to warner our dangers if i'm a real american citizen i landed on plymouth rock i rode with paul revere the warner of our danger do you know what i'm meeting now i crossed the icy delaware with george washington with his barefooted soldiers i was there where i'm identified with this nation [Music] what he did there was part of me what i do now is part of him i was identified with washington at the delaware i stood with stonewall jackson when the odds were so great against him and they asked how can you stand like a stone wall when the odds are suggested a little bashful blue eyed fella kicked this dust with his boots he said i'll never take a drink of water until i thank almighty god for it i have to stand like a stonewall with him amen i stood there with stonewall jackson to be american i'm identified with him and his stand crossing delaware's fighting battles i hosted the flag i was with them when they hosted the flag on guam after thousands of american soldiers give their life and when that little group right up there and throw the flag up i was identified with that raising of that plague every one of us was all american citizens was identified with that flag hanging over guam tears run down my cheeks that was me that was you that meant us all when was identified there with that oh she is i am all her glory is my glory all her shame is my shame if she's done shameful things then i'll have to stare at her reproach if she receives glory i receive glory with her because i'm identified with her now to be identified american has to stand for all america's shame all america's glory all she ever was all she is or what she will be you are identified with it now to be a true christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice and he is in me and on him notice that every christian that's a real genuine christian christian was with him when the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal rims with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life isaiah with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shouted for joy i was with him when he called abraham at the age of of 75 years old and his wife being 65 and told him they were going to have a baby i was with him when he took his stand upon thus saith the lord i'm going to have the baby i stood with him every other christian stood with him amen i was with him when his temptations come i was with him when he went up on top of the mountain offer up isaac i was with him when the ram appeared i was with joseph when he was rejected of his brothers because he was spiritual and the rest of him was carnal i was with him want to know the reproach he had to stand by his own brothers what he was i am amen what i am he was for we are all one in christ jesus i was with joseph in his cave grave eyes with him when he went to the right hand of pharaoh you had to be identified with him eyes of jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel i wrestle myself i know what he went through with so i wrestle with jacob the same time he did for i am his brother i was with moses when he went out into egypt eyes of moses at the burning bush if you're a christian you are identified with them bible characters don't forget it amen eyes of moses when all the people turned against him i was with moses when he crossed the red sea when he raised his hand and walked forward and the red sea opened i was identified in christ right then and i was with moses at that hour whatever christians has been whatever believers has been every believer now is identified with that same person whatever it is you must be identified don't forget that when you do you got spiritual amnesia you've forgotten who you are amen now identified with him with moses when he crossed the sea i was with elijah in the days of ahab when they had to make a choice who they would serve god our balaam we was with him on mount carmel when he had to make this choice for we are identified in the body of the same god that he was identified in so if we are identified in that body then we must remember we were there with him right now i was with david when he was rejected by his own brethren i was with david you are too if you're a christian you have to be identified in his rejection i was with the hebrew children in the fiery furnace when the the fire couldn't burn because of the presence of the fourth man i was with daniel in the lion's den i was identified in there when the angel of the lord identified him in there i most surely was with him at calvary amen i must be identified with him at calvary i must be there to a place that were not also was identified with him at calvary i died with him at calvary every christian must die with him at calvary if you don't die with him at calvary you can't be none of his i was there when he died i died with him and then i was with him when he raised up from the dead i come up on easter morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did i was right there with him every believer was the same and now i am seated with him in heavenly places in christ jesus with all the powers of hell conquered to him every christian believer was seated the same way because you have to be identified now i find myself in this last days with many of the believing christians identified in his ministry he is the same yesterday today and forever i find myself in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself that way believing it walking with it notice the works that he did he said the believer would do the same thing the works that i do shall you also then can you be identified with him then when the reproach comes on the word can you stand the reproach like he did see identified with him i was identified with him i was with him at the day of pentecost i was with the disciples up there identified with them in the baptism of the holy ghost i wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia so much now that they don't some of them don't even believe there is such a thing as the holy ghost see where the church has got a very bad case of amnesia see they have forgotten that that was jesus christ back there they have forgotten what jesus christ was they have forgotten they thought he was just a a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man they forgot that he was god they forgot that he's the same yesterday and forever and the church has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia they have forgotten all these things they don't understand it no more we must be with the disciples at pentecost identify with them i was identified with peter's sermon on the day of pentecost in acts the second chapter i heard what he said i believe what he said i obeyed what he said now i'm identified in the same thing amen don't get spiritual amnesia because you will you identify yourself with something else stay right with that word whereas with the church when it was commissioned by jesus christ in acts the 16th chapter go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature i want to be identified there all the world to every creature these signs shall follow them that believe can be identified in that well are you identified with that or have you got some spiritual amnesia that you find out you don't believe those signs follow the believers see if you don't believe it then you have spiritual amnesia see you've forgotten if god promised that he said these signs shall follow them that believe don't forget it you can't forget it to be a christian you must be identified with it you must be identified with saint john the 14th chapter the 12th verse he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also don't forget it if you do then you've got spiritual amnesia you've forgotten who you are you've forgotten what your testimony means how about he said if you abide me and my word in you you can ask what you will it will be done for you are you identified there to believe it that is the truth mark 11 when he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said can you be identified there to believe it that is the truth if it hasn't then you're getting spiritual amnesia amen and it you forget you lose your christian balance you can't tell where you belong you say i'm methodist i'm baptist that's what i know about it i'm pentecostal i'm this side of the other watch out that may mean the disease sign is showing on you that you've got some spiritual amnesia you say well brother branham i i believe this now i don't hardly now wait just a minute if god promised to do these things and said they'd be in the last days and your creed will keep you from that's a good sign i can see the disease sign on you it's spiritual amnesia you've forgotten to identify yourself amen amen you say i don't believe that the sick are healed you've got spiritual amnesia you see i don't believe in the baptism of the holy ghost spiritual amnesia he said i i don't believe that god promised to do these things in the last days then you've listened to a creed or some doctrine instead of the bible you have spiritual amnesia you don't know where you do belong man you're confessing a christian and denying the word brings you right back to spiritual amnesia again don't know where you stand you got spiritual amnesia you can't identify yourself with the scriptures you have to be with the disciples you have to be with all the scripture with the church when it's commissioned but now when the church was commissioned go ye into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them and believe that was her commission now they have that was the commission but they have gotten a bad case of this spiritual amnesia just like eve got on the on her around through the garden one day now she's like israel suffering from this same disease an allergy from a seminary diet that'll give you spiritual amnesia get some seminary diet and you'll get an allergy and then the first thing you know you'll get amnesia real bad you don't believe anything the bible says that's what's the matter with the church today that's what's a matter we can't have revival today that's what's the matter with the people they've been so drug over coals of everything and ever ism that can hatch up till they don't know what is right and wrong exactly she can't remember her lord she can't remember his word she can't remember the promise that was what was the matter with israel when jesus come on the scene they could not remember that a virgin shall conceive they could not remember that moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like an enemy amen they had spiritual amnesia that's exactly what the church has got today he said it shall come to pass in the last days that these things would take place that we should take amen what is it spiritual amnesia amen we call ourselves pentecostal divine and can't identify ourselves in the world and doing exactly what he said he would do then watch out our denominational system has got us into spiritual amnesia we're suffering we don't know where we belong one takes his papers from this church to the other church in this church and this is him and that ism see what we need again is another amos to come on the scene with thus saith the lord amen but we receive him not like they did they never received him they wouldn't receive him today he couldn't get his head in a place hardly to preach now that's exactly right because the church is suffering with this spiritual amnesia now why god promised in this last days when the son of man would be revealed according to luke 17 chapter that the sign it was taking place in sodom would take place again and the people see it done and some of them don't even believe it they think it's telepathy they think it's a devil spirit what is it they're suffering with spiritual amnesia exactly they can't understand the lord jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever what he was than he is now amen but what's happened just can't identify herself no more with a word why she she don't know whether she's a lodge or whether she's a church she don't want to be called a lodge and she can't be called a church of course be called a church would identify herself with christ that gives her spiritual amnesia and she don't want to be called a lodge so it ain't the pentecostal church of methodist church the baptist church it's a pentecost to lodge methodist lodge and baptist lodge because you can't be identified with the word and when the words made manifest they still don't believe it disease spiritual amnesia can't identify themselves they don't know where they belong that's right it's just exactly like hybriding something as i've often said i always thought one of the most dumbest things i've ever seen was a mule see he's a hybrid see his mother was a mare his daddy was a donkey and he don't even know where he belongs and the first thing you know you you you can breed him and get a donkey and then or get the mule but the mule can't breed itself back again see he don't you can't teach him nothing he's hard-headed you'll never tell anything you accept that big long ears and he'll wait the longest day of his life just before he dies to kick you that's all he's always waiting for something to bust it on you if you can that puts it in mind a lot of so-called hybrid christians that have breathed into church until they got the disease a spiritual adhesive they can't reproduce nothing again you talk about hybrid corn hybrid corn is nothing it's the worst thing you ever put in your mouth anything hybrid that's the reason you have to take these little hot bed plants and hybrid stuff and spray it and doctor it and baby why because it can't keep the bugs off of it but a genuine thoroughbred you don't have no disinfect on him they keep the bugs of unbelief off a real genuine spirited man take it on you and you're going to talk to him say say boy i want you to do this are you saying huh years working them down i've seen a lot of christians about like that so called you say jesus christ the same yesterday and forever these signs shall follow that belief oh i believe the days of miracles has passed ha see he don't know what he does amen where he comes from he don't know where he's going he's got horse amnesia you don't know where he come from he can't go no farther but i like a genuine thoroughbred oh he's gentle you can talk to him he knows who his papa was who his mama was or his grandpa and grandma was he's got pedigreed papers to show where he come from not like a petty greek christian that can go all the way back to the word of god to the day of faith and identify themselves with the faith for the power of the holy ghost came upon them that's a pedigreed christian he knows where he comes from he's not identified with methodist baptists or nothing else he's identifying god's word he knows exactly where he's standing with us the royal blood of his father flows to him the blood of jesus christ he knows what it does he believes every word god works stream and confirms it with the signs that he promised to follow he hasn't got no spiritual amnesia he's a genuine thoroughbred i like that but the church today has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia it doesn't know where it belongs just forgot all about it forgot all these things it makes it a church what made us so rich as we are it's got into the place of ladies again back into that rich place like israel was when it was poor and had to trust god for everything he could do everything that god had trusted god then god was with it and he was spiritually moved on but when he got rich here's what happened their cities build up and their women got immoral their man permitted it their preachers let down the bar and they denounced the prophets and that's the kind of a condition they got into what caused that to forgive where that blessings come from amen are you methodists are you baptists are you presbyterian you methodist and remember john wesley your baptist of the john smith went for the affairs of people until his wife would have to lead him to the table his eyes swelled shut from crying and praying all night long what's the matter john wesley said that one of the great things i believe it was one of the early method his father said the disgrace of the daughters of the methodist church was beginning to get so early they were wearing rings upon their finger what would he say now with sharks on them what happened spiritual episode that's right exactly what it is for god where you come from you've got all these things because god's given this goodness did to you do you think this is a strange thing it's exactly with the spirit of jesus christ the prophecy and revelation is the third chapter it said because thou says i am rich i have need and nothing and know not that thou art poor blind wretched miserable naked and don't do it see don't know it what is it spiritual amnesia amen they don't know it right the church has got the money now there's not a church heart in the country a denominational what's worth millions times millions of dollars building millions and millions of dollars in buildings and things and preaching the coming of the lord is at hand [Music] rich and said i have need for nothing the best educated preachers they ever had no more theology than they ever known and they got the biggest buildings the best selected places in the city they got the right away to anything they want to do and then what did they do got spiritual amnesia and forgot that it was god that done that for him just like israel and the bible prophesied jesus christ sent his angel to john and said this church age would have this spiritual amnesia they were wretched remember they think they're beings they think they've got something but he said they were miserable wretched poor blind naked and fitted out yeah there's no way to tell them now if a man was out here on the street disgraced or a woman naked on the street blind that would be a pitiful shape to be in that shape but then if they had their right mind know who they was that they was a human being and they're supposed to wear clothes when you go out there they're human beings supposed to be identified with human race and out there wretched miserable blind and naked and you go to him said brother you're naked now here i'm doctor so and so you just abandon your own business i'll tell you i belong to someone so you ain't got no business you holy roller tell me nothing [Applause] what is it it's a forgotten the lord jesus christ they better come down and do the signs and wonders that he said he would do they don't want to believe it right with spiritual amnesia say they have forgotten and they're made and don't know it don't realize that they think just because i've gone to church that's always necessary oh brother that means more to god than to be a mason or anything else any other life upon the church that don't mean nothing to god you've got to be sons and daughters of god [Applause] when i become part of my father i become all my father when you become part of god you become god and full his whole word you believe all of it amen amnesia what if you didn't know your name was what it was if you are you'll come from a fine family which i hope you did if you come from a fine family people and what if you forget that family name and you guys are living disgraceful they say aren't your name jones or whatever i don't know who i was see all right see that's a horrible thing to be a horrible condition to get into well that's just where the church is gone it's supposed to be the representation of jesus christ yes but it's forgot that because it's got injected into it creeds and denominations that they've accepted that instead of the blind word and don't know what is no way to tell them right i may never be in birmingham again but this is one time to go hear it right i'm just i'm not responsible for another sowing seed god directs it to the ground we're supposed to go amen for god yes they forgot the word of the promise they forgot israel is that kind of effects when jesus come it had forgot they looked well they said they believe there's coming a messiah but the messiah come and identified himself by the word they had so many traditions to them made the word of god of no effect and jesus promised just before the end time if it wasn't sudden so would it be and if he identified it the people so traditional to invade the promise of god of no effect by their tradition spiritual amnesia spiritual amnesia is exactly what it is see they have forgotten these things oh i belong to this i i've done this i've danced in the spirit i did this one my my that has nothing to do with it not at all how can you be a christian and deny the word you can't do it god is the word the words in you you and the word are the same all the word is you are amen if i'm living in this generation what this all that the bible preaches and stands for hallelujah [Music] already i feel pretty religious right i've got to be identified with everything that that bible claims and give it claims and if i haven't been stricken with this modern day spiritual amnesia i am will be and can't be identified with him by the night then i've got spiritual amnesia something has happened i've accepted a creed or a doctrine or some church or a group a man i can't do it when yet the word comes and identifies itself that's why jesus wasn't recognized oh they say well this man's holy there's our holy priests our holy this and jesus said you're of your father the devil and his works you'll do did you know cain offered a good sacrifice too he was sincere build an altar and held down in worship and offered a sacrifice and prayed to god and if god that's all god requires you to belong to church and have an altar and pay your tithes and go to church and live a good life if that's all he requires he was unjust to condemn king because he did the same thing amen yes exactly but religion means a covering and you can't be covered by your own good works there's only one thing that god will accept and that's the blood of jesus christ amen that's the only covering outside of that if you say keep the creed spiritual amnesia that's what happened now notice they have forgot their word they have forgot the bible they have forgot the promise they're trying to live in a glare of what methodist was what baptist was what somebody else was here's the promise of the day and god speaking through his word and confirming again proving that it is so and they still don't believe in spiritual amnesia it's exactly right total total amnesians absolutely don't believe it all a french soldier i was told a little story before we closed i didn't know it's even that late and i got about 10 pages of notes here left get it some other time notice a french soldier they got a bunch of soldiers in from the army and they had this amnesia some shock on the battle and they had a program and they they called up let people who had missing loved ones to call and see if they could identify these boys no hope for them maybe one or two out of it caught it then they took the rest of them is going to put them in a sanitarium where they'd have to stay the rest their life that's going up the hillside train pulling and stopping the station let the boys get out and stretch their legs and the guards got out on the hill to watch them because with amnesia while they they had to watch them so they watched one young fellow there he got out and began to look around that water tank looked all right over the hill he rubbed his face and he studied and he looked again and seen that water tank he looked all around the station and he started walking instead of the guard stopped and he followed him he went up over the hill down a little path turned to the right went up over another little hill and come to a little log cabin he looked coming out on the porch an old man with a cane in his hand come out and throw his arms around him said my son i know you would return they told me you were dead but i know you would return and the boy come to himself his amnesia left him he could identify who he was he know that was his father oh soldier of the cross has been shocked by so much training so many shocks of denomination and creed and things of the world why don't you just step off for a few minutes and go looking around at the bible you might wander around you might find yourself identified here in the word as a believer one of these as you might not know you may come to yourself like the prodigal son did and find yourself you might find your identification in the words of god someone said the other night long ago said but brother branham look at us pentecostal people what fine churches we got well we we got ministers has been trained listen when a man marries a wife he doesn't trust in her beauty no he trusts in the loyalty of her vow her word he doesn't trust in her beauty he trusts us in her loyalty and that's why when you marry to god you don't trust in some big beautiful church you can build but in the promise that jesus christ made on the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that let us our head just a moment amen praise the lord thank god for the word thank god for a prophet that brought the word amen not not the pastor not the evangelist but the prophet of god amen we pray the grace of god to make us in the word one amen and there's nothing that he said that i can deny it was the truth amen so i prayed and it was amazing again that though he passed through this this city there and many others and yet they they never recognized the prophet no they recognized a man with with with signs and wonders and he could he could preach this and preach that thank god for those who were behind him amen supporting this ministry but the most they were looking for was signs and wonders and again that's why he went beyond this and he went back in to pray for the sick the signs and the wonders and it's it's no wonder the prophet of god or the the lord did say and tell william branham to stop the signs and wonders all right why because they were they were just out with signs and wonders they were just at the signpost but they didn't receive in their hearts what he was preaching it's like and you'll never get you never get to where you're going unless you receive it recognize it it's like i said when we used to some years ago when our family was here in the city and there are signs of course especially during summer or holidays that they would they would that we would drive from st john's back to our town in gamble and it was absolutely absolutely amazing then i said now if coming back we're coming back home i said what are we looking at i said we're looking at the oh we're looking at the i said the signs of that's guiding us to st john's oh there's so many more back then it was miles oh oh good we're getting closer another but i said we don't stop at the sign no no we let the sign poop move us on and the closer we get the the number of miles went down we're more and more encouraged oh oh we'll soon be home amen we'll soon be home i wonder if we got that attitude spiritually amen brother there was luther was one the signs that god had all the way down through and finally of course they became allowed to see it and so on and but that was the most deceiving one and everybody say they stayed hung up by the sign allow to see it the church is rich and increased with goods have needed nothing but they had a need of something they didn't recognize or they were satisfied with the natural things of life well we and basically their their emphasis was on the natural things amen but not the spiritual and that's why jesus came and said you're richard you're miserable you're poor you're blind you're naked my what they they said oh we're rich we're increased with goods we have needed nothing we're great we're wonderful but when god looked at him through his word oh you're wretched you're miserable you're poor you're blind but they wouldn't receive it they wouldn't they didn't want that again see this as proof and evidence that as like what they what they've refused here they refuse in this last age that you and i are witnessing oh yeah they didn't want jesus to say that that you're richard miserable poor blind naked we are rich increased with goods have needed nothing yeah nothing physically but they they did have the need of something spiritually so brother what is our need don't don't don't put too much emphasis on on the natural things you'll feel that everything's fine everything's fine no let's judge ourselves by the word let's let's see if there's any needs there are we rich spiritually increased with goods comes to the revelation spiritually you know and have need of nothing by the grace of god how are you judging yourself amen the bride judges up by the word amen and jesus because jesus why she listened to jesus jesus said he said i stand at the door and knock open the open the door and i'll come into you and he said and we'll have fellowship together amen so i pray god that that's that's why we're here amen why because he knocked and he he opened the door and we went in that fellowship with him the word by the grace of god amen but the church the church is out there they're still rich and increased with goods that needed nothing and don't know that they he consider that they are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked uh if we were preaching that they they would they would blame us that we got the anointing of the devil they think they got the anointing of god you know and for us to be preaching that and they're just seeing that you're all all you're seeing is negative negative negative i've got a lot of complaints against my own testimony over the years that people say oh he's he's all down well you got to get down to get up you have you humble yourself to go down he'll raise you up amen by the grace of god so because i've emphasized these things the reality of what's all around us you know so and we got to recognize that you know if not we won't we won't believe what jesus said richard poor miserable blind and naked yeah so brother i'll tell you that unfortunately there's even a lot of believers with that attitude oh yeah they're blind they think they've got eyes to see and he used to hear but no they're blind and don't know it why because it's exactly what jesus prophesied he says going to get so bad and so deceitful in the last days it would deceive the very elect if possible not just to save the elect the very elect amen because there's many called but those that are chosen many are called fewer chosen as the bride of christ and he warned them that it's going to be so deceptive it would deceive them amen so god help us brother that we're not going to be deceived by those religious spirits that are on the move yeah but but by the grace of god we're going to stay with the word and the prophet again in that message on spiritual amnesia he goes on i don't want to be honest we heard it but he goes on to to give us the exhortation to stay with the word amen don't go with this don't go with that stay with the word and that's why it's going to get down to the twos and trees he said amen so grace of god to us brother sister amen and again i would have i really wanted to go through in some of those things there and uh but i felt that if i played the tape that i wouldn't have to take two or three services to go through the quotes and it would you know to bring it into the word so just bear with me just uh okay so i pray god to make you and what you heard one i pray by the grace of god that what you hear is going to control what you do what you don't do amen you're going to you're going to humble yourself and come back in order make sure you're in order with the word amen by the grace of god he said i i like this part that he was bringing out near the end there he said i was most surely with jesus at calvary amen i must be identified with him at calvary i must be there to a place that we're not where not also was i identified with him at calvary i died with him at calvary i trust the lives we live is proof that we die we lay down our lives with him and we rose up in the resurrection and we're living resurrected raptured lives again that's right you at the quickened you as he resurrected who were dead in sins and trespasses amen because we lay ourselves down with him amen praise the lord and again like i said we've been raptured into heavenly places oh and that's why we are totally separated from the world because we're where the word is being revealed that's it that's in in the rapture in christ amen i died with him at calvary i don't think it meant where most believers and so-called christians today really they don't consider what jesus suffered for them they're already considered what jesus did endure for your sake to save you so brother sister what what are we willing to suffer as do for him not to save him amen but to show what he did we needed and we appreciate it because lord we're going to lay our lives down for you you laid yours down for me now lord help me to lay my life down for you through whatever i'm getting involved with here and there and there no no lord i just stay down amen we'll get put down by the world but that's fine they did as i said dude oh yeah i see the word of god there i preached on being a prisoner not a prisoner i said of newfoundland not a prisoner of of of canada not a prisoner there a prisoner there no you're you become a prisoner of jesus amen totally controlled by jesus amen and the gospel so god help us so he said again now i am seated with him in heavenly places in christ jesus with all the powers of hell conquered through him amen now he said i find myself in this last days with the many believing christians identified in his ministry he is the same yesterday today and forever i find myself in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself that way believing walking with it amen he said the believer would do the same thing and the works that i shall do you shall do also amen i was with him at the day of pentecost i was with the disciples up there identified with them in the baptism of the holy ghost amen i wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia so much now that they don't no don't some of them don't even believe there is such a thing as the holy ghost there's very little emphasis put on the baptism of the holy ghost or even around the message they're putting the answers on on this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine oh yeah but no what about your personal relationship with jesus amen doesn't make a difference where it was all down through the ages they all had a personal relationship with the lord they were born again amen so i pray grace that we have the testimony that we're born again you didn't we didn't just come out of one church into another no no we were born again amen and god brought us brought us out of that hospital that you were in amen you don't have to go back there no more amen he brought you to the word and you're born again and you'll feed on the word you get more and more and more faith amen luther did wesley did the pentecostals now the bride but look what they they did the lutheran brought forth the work of the of the word the revealed word they brought forth the life of the revealed word the life of the revealed word and now what are we going to bring forth resurrection and rapture by the grace of god god help us amen he said now i am seated with him in heavenly places in christ with all the powers of hell conquered through him amen praise the lord don't let the devil get the victory in your life don't let the devil decide deceive you don't let the devil trick you into doing this doing that god help us amen well again he tricked he tricked cain yeah and cain thought for sure he said you know i got my church i got i got my offering got my altar got my sacrifices all wonderful you know and maybe kane thought he is was the best better than abel's he's right because he because they were like i said he would never had nothing only of only a slain lamb blood all over the altar blood over over abel and no doubt abel was giving him a preaching to him a revelation oh yeah it was by it was by faith that abel offered the more excellent sacrifice it was revealed to him and he was sharing that revelation that faith with cain and cain killed him right why because he was downloading cain's sacrifice he was downloading same kings altar maybe showing that well look what you've done look look what i've done abel my surely the lord appreciates this yeah but it wasn't by faith no no but what what abel did was by faith and he pleased god amen so brother what we do has to be based on faith not religious ideas of doctrine no no religious because you feel religious to do this to do this yeah lord we want to do this for you and so on no no you got to do what god wants you to do amen we got to have the faith that pleases god see that again cain cain never read the faith that pleased god and god told him god said cain if you do if you do do right he said won't you also be accepted yeah he would but no way he felt that god should accept what he was doing and what he did and there's a lot of believers saying god should accept what we've done and what we're doing you know we're doing this we're doing that well regardless of what you do your salvation is in jesus name not doing this not doing this doing that no no definitely not no your salvation was in the finished work of calvary it was in christ it all goes back to him starts with him amen and when what we do after that well if it's according to his will god help us again there's there was a message that i wanted to bring up too and that was on trying to do goddess service without his will amen that's what cain was trying to do amen but it didn't work mccain but abel had the will of god i pray grace that we have the will of god doing what we're doing part of the emphasis on the word lining up with the word by the grace of god amen humbling ourselves to acknowledge lord thank you i acknowledge lord that we are sinners saved by grace yeah you can't condemn this one or that one no because oh yeah they're this they're this forget it that what you're seeing in that person i'll remind you what god sees in you amen oh that person you know he's not a believer he's not this he's oh he's a he's a sinner well well you're a sinner saved by grace amen and you're still in this old sinful body and god is with you to give you power and great grace to overcome amen so humble yourself better stay humble and as i said don't look down your nose at anybody if there's another another believer or somebody out there in the nomination don't look down your nose at them definitely not and remember as i said i preached this 55 years ago almost my first sermon and i give them the scripture and i said so i said keep your attitude right in your spirit right i said don't look down your nose at that one i said maybe they'll get in and you won't yeah they'll be they'll be cast out so i pray the grace of god brother alphas to keep our spirit and our attitude right that god is in control by the grace of god and again when our prophet was taken off the scene in 1965 and like i said i have i have a copy of the newspaper that they published back then and and uh they interviewed different religions as it were religious people to you know see what they thought about william branham and and they're gone well most of them just felt so bad you know and but it was a roman catholic priest he was in some roman catholic office in the church and they interviewed him and he he was he was so disappointed so all mine down because william branham was gone and why why because he what did he experience what did he find in william branham the love of god and he said well when it comes to william branham he said there's one thing for sure when you met him and you talked to him he said you knew he loved you amen today you talk to many believers and you don't sense no love no but i tell you if they're born again seed of god the bride of christ they'll have that love as god loved them they will love you yes god laid himself down for you they will lay down sit there lay themselves down for one another oh yeah by the grace of god but there's not many living that kind of life today most are just living for themselves but not for the body but the true believers are living for the body of christ amen as he's talking about here he said i was with daniel i was with the hebrew children i was with david yes that's right well we're all in different in a theophany body but we're all back there with moses with jacob joseph and so on yeah by the grace of god amen he said i was with him on the day of pentecost just think i was with him on calvary i wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia so much now that they don't some of them don't even believe there is such a thing as the holy ghost so where the church has gone a very bad case of amnesia they have forgotten he said that that was jesus christ back there they have forgotten he was just or rather what jesus christ was they have forgotten because they thought he was a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man they forgot that he was god they forgot that he is the same yesterday today and forever and the church has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia and unfortunately again i'm experiencing where a lot of believers have got a bad case of amnesia spiritual amnesia because that anointing is not there that used to be there years ago no and again this and again that's the proof where jesus said concerning the elect that is so deceiving that it would deceive the very elective possible yeah well it must that must be the hour that we're living because personally from somebody that knew this and knew that back 50 years ago and the anointing 50 years ago and oh my the attitudes and and and to realize now that it's it's almost all gone so like he said most are being deceived yeah it's that bad he said don't get spiritual amnesia because you will you you'll identify yourself with something else stay right with that word amen it's not identifying with the preacher it's not identifying what is this ministry that ministry is identifying with jesus amen he said you say i don't believe that the sick are healed you've got spiritual amnesia brother because he's the same yesterday today and forever bear with me a moment here he said that's what's matter with the church today he said that's what's matter we can't have revival today and that's what's the matter with the people today they've been sold drug over coals or everything and every ism that could hatch it up he said till they don't know what is right or wrong amen and she can't remember her lord she can't remember his word she can't remember the promise of god amen it's a spiritual amnesia as i've been ministered on or said that in the three kinds of believers brother brown said i'm preaching it he said this this way and he said i want you to just want you to say this is me i'm not a i'm not a make-believer i'm not a non-believer i'm a believer so he preached it and preached it and he said he said but what are you no doubt there was others there felt maybe he shouldn't have been preaching that and maybe he discerned that well he said i'm preaching it i landed out so that you'll you'll be able to determine which is you amen so he wanted to let he let him know what a believer was he let him know what a unbeliever was and a make-believer and the attitude they would have now he said which one are you not just hear it and learn it is to apply it to your own life and say oh well i i heard the message and i've talked to the lord about it and i felt maybe i was an unbeliever in certain areas of my life not only and i was a make-believer in other areas of my life and things that i was doing and but i i settled it with the lord and i'm a believer amen so also with with with the message concerning spiritual amnesia amen brother we want you to consider do i have amnesia spiritual amnesia have i forgotten am i forgetting you know this and this and this that what god requires now oh that was just then well what about now brother let's create grace that we don't get spiritual amnesia and forget it because they they were back in the beginning when they walked walk walk in this word walk with this word oh my oh my praise the lord what what an attitude of spirit that the people had what an anointing was on them and yeah that like that catholic priest said i shook the handle with him brought him i knew he loved me yeah and yeah well believers experience those things too with believers but it's not not now like it was back then no god help us and he said i like a pedigreed christian that can go all the way back to the word of god to the day of pentecost and identify themselves with the saints where the power of the holy ghost came upon them that's a pedigreed christian and he knows where he come from he's not identified with methodist baptists or nothing else is identified with god's word and knows exactly where he is standing the royal blood of his father flows through him the blood of jesus christ amen the church today has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia and don't just take it and apply it out there let's take it and apply it in our own ranks and in your own life too often the people take just certain messages and they just apply it out there but they won't apply it among themselves and that's what's wrong amen again he told you to make your calling election sure make sure you're going to apply it here not out there what what god with the word of god oh well i'm separated i don't have nothing to do with him well maybe god don't have nothing to do with you god help us amen so he said the church today as a bad case of spiritual amnesia what made us rich so what made us so rich as we are it has got to the place of laodicea back into that rich place like israel was and when it was poor it had to trust god for everything it could do amen and brother i said the prophet of god warned us that it's coming to a day when uh we're going i'll say you go to bed tonight you got money in the bank i said you wake up tomorrow and i said you you don't own it i said there's another power that's going to take control of it what are we going to do then are we going to oh are we going to forsake what what we really believe why are we going to keep taking our stand for the word or will we compromise just to keep get our money back i tell you there's a lot of believers are going to compromise when they realize what they're going to lose when it comes to the natural things of this world natural things of life they'll compromise just to get it back normal say that's mine that's mine that's mine thank you no wonder he said when he come will he find faith on the earth they're down through the ages there were those that were that had faith to the extent that they would lay down their lives yeah as paul laid down his god help us amen that god elvis and gave us the faith that stays with the word and we're not going to compromise for family friends or neighbors we're not going to compromise for ourselves amen many will unfortunately we know that that's the truth or jesus wouldn't have warned us in the way that he did amen god's grace to us i want to ask you something what if he does come tonight oh say he isn't coming i don't know whether he is or not this is the last sign remember thus saith the lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true he said you are seeing your last sign that scriptural he said you've seen your last sign pentecost don't get mixed up now with what he promised israel after the rapture that ain't you he said you're done now is your day now is your sign now is your time don't reject it don't do it you'd better come believe me to be god's servant he said he said you are the nicest people i want to meet in my life here in birmingham but you need a revival you are dying and you're taking spiritual amnesia you are dying and he said don't do that revive that what you've got bring it up again quickly before jesus comes and get rid of that amnesia and now how many knows that i am telling you the truth that you are dying and need a revival but folks you better wake up right quick and he said right here brother brown pound the pulpit three times and he said in that hour that you think not it might happen amen so remember he said you're getting your last warning so he said flee while you have time to flee amen wake up while you have time to wake up make your calling election sure when you have time to do it by the grace of god but it's unfortunate but we're living in that hour wherein that is written in the bible there's somewhere concerning those that look into the mirror of the word of god amen and some look into it and see see themselves and they want to they want to change and others look in and they see their faults and everything else and just move on amen they're not taking the mirror of the word of god seriously so lord help us bear with me just try to find that scripture amen oh sorry let's see he said but ye are doers of the word and not errors only there are some that hear it but not do it he said deceiving or he said be ye doers of the word and not errors only there are those that hear the word only but not do it well i just believe in god no you gotta line up your word with it line up your life with it every day what how you do this how you do that and how you react in this how you react in that that's what you're doing because the anointing is in you the holy ghost is in you make sure that you're going to say and talk the way you you should talk as a christian and act the way you should be acting as a christian and reacting as a christian and so on so that it's not it's not you that lives it's christ that lives in you by the grace of god so he said be ye doers of the word and not errors only he said if you're just doing the word not doing the word and just hearing it he said you're deceiving your own self amen if any man if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he be all of himself and go with his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was amen but there are others that look into it and take it serious and if there's anything they need to get done they go get it done but others just look into the mirror and go on they don't stop to consider what they need to do amen it says why also looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continue it therein he be not a forgetful error but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so god help us look into the mirror and act and react according to what we're seeing by the grace of god amen he said you're not going to get anything from god till you get desperate and you gotta get desperate enough so god recognizes your desperation amen he said what a place to be in there's no fire burning there's no enthusiasm there's not a go into it and he said as an evangelist that just kills me to see god's people in that shape we're supposed to be on fire amen but he said see you see is exactly what i told you revelation 3 your lukewarm and he said because you're lukewarm then i'm going to spew you out of my mouth amen pray god don't spit you out amen but you're there ready for him to use you in any way he wants to by the grace of god amen so god bless us amen as we continue in the word amen seriously amen by the grace of god serious brother how serious are we to be concerning the resurrection and the rapture we ought to be very serious because if if we're living in that hour right now of the resurrection rapture we we ought to be looking on oh yeah and i think that's what god's looking for in us spiritually in our experience with god are we really really looking up for the rapture looking up for the change looking up to get out of here out of here and into glory and they really believe us believe rather that there is there is another place where jesus is waiting for us in glory amen in heaven god help us we heard a sermon there was a sermon this morning on the radio that we just tuned in for something and uh pentecostal pastor preaching from the church that i would that i that i was in many many years ago and i have to i have to be honest i said yeah he's spiritual he's really putting the people on their guard and on their toes concerning their relationship with the lord amen so you just don't don't take it for granted you just don't assume everything is all right well i go to church i'm a christian oh yeah i'm going to a pentecostal church yeah the devil does too and the devil goes to messy churches yeah so god help us brother because i must i gotta say that the the preacher he was really balanced in what he was preaching and challenging the people in their relationship with jesus it was a challenge amen brother believers need to be challenged only those that have a perfect relationship with jesus is going into resurrection and rapture god help us amen he said the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you amen he said we got a stinger there amen it is christ identified in you and that's when he has recognized you praise the lord amen so do others recognize you as a christian because they're seeing christ living in your life christ in your spirit your attitude your conversations your decisions and everything oh they're christians yeah i trust that they they see that in you those that you work for those that you associate with fellowship with and so on grace of god so again it's christ identified in you and that's when he has recognized you but when christ is identified in you and he said identifying himself then you are christ-like he said which the word christian means to be christ-like he said there is your identification amen identified with him by living for him amen so i trust that you're living for jesus there's another quote satisfying we'll leave it there and it's like i said when i was in a certain building a certain store to buy some things there or to check some things i don't know what it was now but i noticed the worker and it's a young man and he walked by and he had his name on his tag there and he said christian oh so i ran after him and i said excuse me i said your name is christian yes he said that's my name oh i said well god bless you and i said thank you i said i said most would narrow it down to chris not christian but chris so i said i prayed the lord i said help you to keep it he said that way i said i said it is to be christ-like oh well he was i think he was a professing christian oh i said good the lord bless you i said keep it up and i said don't narrow your name down i said keep it the same okay said thank you so he wasn't offended but i i appreciate it so i pray i i pray god bless you amen god bless you let's stand amen he said the new birth is christ and it is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery that's the new birth and he said what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word he said by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest he said oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is amen so brother god's waiting us waiting for us to come to the full revelation of who we are as the sons and daughters of god yes and as the bride of the lord jesus christ amen praise the
