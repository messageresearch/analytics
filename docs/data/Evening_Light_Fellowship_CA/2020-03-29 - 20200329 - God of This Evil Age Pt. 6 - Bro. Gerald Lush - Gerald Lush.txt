everyone our that we're closer and closer to our redemption is this our help us Lord to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might for the glory of God grace grace grace amen give the glory

and around us Alleluia to get us to hunger thirst how they loo you for what you want to do be with us we pray for your glory your honor your praise in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen praise the name of the Lord Amen if you would you standing turn with me to Romans chapter 8 and there's a number of other scriptures that I want to read but and we've already read this for them maybe a number of times but to point us to other things that will be said this morning and the importance of being led by the Spirit and again to thank those that have come praise the name of the Lord wasn't expecting our brother Joseph and sister Priscilla of the family but but the Lord bless them a man and brother Chad I thought maybe he would be at Central a man he'd be on the highway for sure but we thank him for what he did and he came in and understand that he cleaned the church and and did everything that necessary to clean it all up pump it to the door he met a man thank the Lord so God be with us brother and we really truly need him in this hour a man to have the assurance of his presence Alleluia so we can have peace and rest the world doesn't have peace the world doesn't have rest but the Bride of Christ has got the peace and rest of God amen thank God for that amen praise the Lord in Romans chapter 8 and beginning to read at verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God a man for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whoa praise the Lord whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God oh I pray we got that confirmation Amen I pray we got that tokin a man of the anointing of the Holy Ghost in ourselves confirming that we are sons and daughters of God is a confirmation brother that we come from eternity into time and we're going back to eternity by the grace of God amen so again verse 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs and heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together God bless his words you may be seated you can well imagine what its distress it is on the ministry to have to miss so many services a van so we miss as many sermons we miss that's as many sermons maybe I've got to preach today a man and it's going to be maybe a number of sermons but again it's on the same subject that we've been on and it's the god of this evil age and we could go on and on and on on it and I don't know again we're starting the scriptures that I want to read I don't know we're getting into the to finish the quotes on the message that the Prophet again preached in 1965 and again it is a revelation I feel that we really need as a revelation I feel that we really need to get understanding of amen so that we're not going to be deceived by the god of this evil age hey man so that we're going to be under the control and the influence and really God is an object of worship hey man it is an object of worship and so there is there is the god that's here for the right and there's a god that's here for the unbeliever there's a God this year trying to influence the world brother away from the world so we're praying the grace of God that were under the anointing of Elohim the self existing one amen not not the God of this evil age but the God of all creation the God of eternity a man the god of Redemption by the grace of God so brother and God is an object of worship and there are many as the prophet of God has art brought up we might do that quote again here in the message the god of this evil age and he said the devil is being worshipped he said by millions he said of billions yeah and he people don't realize they think they're worshiping Jehovah they think they're worshiping Elohim they think they're worshiping Jesus but they're worshipping the devil that's right that is the truth because why because he said he said I'm gonna do this I got as I try told you I preached on on the five I wills of the devil any man any near five I wheels there I believe in Ezekiel Isaiah and he said I will I will I will I will ascend above the most I a man and he would sit on the throne he said on this one that's on the thorn Oh brothers tremendous and the problem brings that out in the seven seals concerning the the the white horse rider then the red horse rider and then another horse rider and he said what is it he said it's the devil he said going from one phase to another one phase to another until he gets absolute control a man and again is there in the scriptures so I trust by the grace of God that were under the reign worship under the right anointing under the anointing of Almighty God and not the god of this evil age so the Lord be with us as we go into the scriptures and into the message and again concerning what's going on in the world that I allow me to say that I believe is for a purpose that God has allowed to allowed it God has permitted it a man for a purpose we say well this is the devil that's the devil but yet what did what the devil does God allows amen god is good god is good so he said so far shalt thou go and no further a man so we believe that what we're gonna so what's going on we know that God is permitting it and what what is God's reason for allowing this allowing these things to happen well is to bring out the spirit and the the attitude of the world a man but it's also to bring out the spirit and the attitude of the sons and daughters of God a man God God sees the world God sees what's going on over there God knows God knows that Amen because why because Satan is in control but God is looking for the actions and reactions of his sons and daughters the actions of the reactions of the seed of God by grace of God a man God knows that we're gonna stay with the word God knows we're not gonna cut off with what's going on in the world we're still gonna get caught up with the word a man a man the world is getting caught up with what's happening out there but we recognize that as scripture being fulfilled so we're caught up with the scriptures a man were caught up with a word and not not and we're not going to bypass the word and get a caught up with that when I'm going to bypass the word I love that to give us fear no no the fear of God keeps us in the word when we say fear is not to be afraid of God no no it's to respect God it's the honor God it's the reverence God that that's what it means to to have the fear of God amen others going to fear God over their wife because they're afraid of God a man brotherbrother I turned their sons and daughters were not afraid of him we appreciate him amen we love him as he loved us we love him so I pray God give us the right spirit and the right attitude and we'll keep the right spirit and keep the right attitude as we see more and more and more things happen out there in the world now we know according to the scriptures whether it's going to get worse according to the scriptures there's no me a lot of other things happen and not just in here just there some rascal me it's gonna be like it's like this virus is going to be around the world a man and concerning the virus again and I do believe that it's it's what the prophet of God referred to and I gave you that I gave you the quotes on it concerning the germ warfare and again he mentioned it in 1954 but he also mentioned again in 1960 yeah six years later he referred to the germ warfare and when again as you said what is cancer what is a disease and he said we'll deal on that in the next few minutes and he went on down and he said he said diseases are germs now he said listen listen he said he said did you know the Bible prediction but in the last days there be a germ warfare and the diseases will break out upon the people and will fall upon everyone without the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the bachelors in what seals us in to the word a man and makes us one with the word whether we be Jew or Gentile Amen God's Word God's requiring obedience from us God's required obedience from Israel amen so brother I trust by the grace of God that the Lord he is recognizing in us what he said right here there what do we had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said but the germ warfare it will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen so I trust brother sister that we have the mention of the Holy Spirit and that's what keeps the devil away amen and was in 1960 that he referenced it again and he said how do we thank me that in this great hour that when all hopes of mortal life as finished a man he said atomic bombs he said are laying in Angers and he did say that Russia had won with it with it with the name of the United States on it and so on he said the nitrogen bombs he says sickness he's a diseases he said germ warfare again 90/60 and oh god he said everything the way it is knowing that the Bible said that man would actually rot in their flesh a man but we're going to experience the beginning but not the end amen so he said but the angel was given Commission don't touch any of those don't come near those who as the wine and oil a man don't touch those who has the seal of God upon their foreheads and he's referencing Ezekiel chapter 9 concerning those that sigh and cry for the abominations that be done amen and he said the seal of God in their hearts and he said those who are wanting the seal of God kiss away every fear Lord seal them with the Holy Spirit in their hearts that they'll come forth as newborn maids a father he said granted Lord I committed to the in the name of Jesus and he did say again he said concerning he said don't touch any of those don't you come near those who has the wine and oil don't touch those who has the seal of God upon their foreheads and we realized that the batter of the Holy Ghost is the seal of God and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption a man so brother all those that are in context are experiencing and will experience redemption has got the seal of God to protect us from the devil amen so the devil can't break through that seal amen if we got it in our hearts and in our souls he can't break through it so let's pray the grace of God that we got the power over the world power over the flesh power over the devil amen o God confirm it in your life today God confirm it in your in our lives every day that is God in control and not the devil a man so we're under we're under when it comes to an object of worship where were serving all el Elohim not the devil a man and brother we're worshipping Him and brother whoever it is the one day God does this that's the one your worship me that's what that influences our thoughts our words and our deeds a man that spirit that anointing that influence of your thoughts your words your dates that's the spirit you love me worship me so I trust that our thoughts our words and our dates are influenced by the Holy Spirit not the Holy Spirit by Almighty God and not the devil Amanda but again the thoughts and the words and the deeds of the world today is under Satan's influence and they're worshiping him that's right so a grace brothers sister that we've got the right anointing is this written rear in the word sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God a man led by the spirit and he's controlling your thoughts he controls your words he controls your deeds amen not just today but tomorrow amen and on into the time of the resurrection and the rapture amen brother it was God's thoughts that controlled down through the ages or you can go to it to Abraham and a lot you know who's controlling Lots thoughts you know that's controlling Abraham thoughts amen who is controlling Noah thoughts Enoch thoughts who is controlling those that died in the flood amen brother and as it was in that day so it is in this day as it wasn't that our citizen this hour a man by the script brother that's understand brother it's all Scripture it's all the word Genesis to Revelation from time back on to eternity again it's the word the word the word a man it rather we've got to get into the revelation of God and he and be led by the Spirit of God from firk it is a confirmation that we are the sons of God a man brother I don't care whether it's here in the church where there's out there and the natural things and endless or the spiritual if you're Eve you're a son and daughter of God a man your thoughts are influenced your words are influenced a man your deeds are under the influence of Almighty God amen you do what you do you you you and you act the way you act you react the way you react a man you talk the way you talk why because of the it's not you it's Christ in you a man and it's not just it's not just all the way if I've I'm going to be a spiritual witness and I'm gonna witness about the word and I got to do this oh I'll come under your influence no Lord no you're under his influence period a man morning noon and night you're under his influence hey babe I don't care what wondering what your thoughts are for this day that day tomorrow you know it might be in the middle of the day the end of the day it's still God is still Christ amen because it's Christ in us the hope of glory and if he's in a city Catrice he's the one that's leaving and if he's living in us well oh it's not me no no there's Jesus oh no no that's dad's bad brothers no coffee no snot is Jesus or brother brother Chad lamb no no it's Jesus not your love he might be a lamb amen both Chad Collins amen it's Jesus this is amazing people look at you say oh he's a fanatic well they consider Jesus to be a fanatic amen oh he sister is that brother the same editor they had toward Jesus they're gonna add to you if you got this rid of Jesus in you and if it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen I'll praise the Lord will give the glory to Jesus tell of his wonderful love amen amen is something we experience constantly all the 24 hours a day 24/7 we experience the love of God we know it we live in the spirit we walk in the spirit amen and it's the Spirit of Christ in us by the grace of God so brother judge yourself the pot I've read that Scripture the last time we administered here and the brother Gaza you judge yourself amen and you judge yourself my word and what are you looking for oh I believe the message no I give the public out bottled out in a in a in another message I was really are you've made one of the seven seals and he brought that it again he said don't just say I believe the message no no he should you lived the message a man he said you and you're going forward then it controls you it's a message amen you're reflecting the message of the hour you're reflecting the mystery of the seven seals that's why the world feels that your your your your fanatic oh yeah why because we because that is damn we're taking it's so different from the world so different from what they think is whole different from their thoughts their words and their deeds amen we don't think the thoughts in their thinking hanging out there and well if we don't talk the way they talk over there amen because we're now our conversation is only goes to influence we may not be talking about the word itself but the word is reflecting itself in you and through you and it's the Holy Spirit if you're going to talk to somebody you're going to talk with the right spirit and a right attitude and it might end up talking about the word and it may not you may be talking about natural things but yet you're gonna be talking about it in a way that Jesus would talk about it amen hallelujah you're gonna have that anointing in your heart and your soul and it kind of control again and control your spirit and they control your the 5in instincts of your your flesh and remembering again that the instincts of your flesh is see what you're seeing you're gonna look at it through the eyes of God you're gonna see it the way Jesus sees it a man and again taste whatever it is you're going to taste and led the way that Jesus tasted a man let's let's get into the spiritual how does this taste a does that taste in your soul eggman brother we're gonna have the same sensitive taste as Jesus did or even he would know what was right and what was wrong a man come he said he eat of my flesh and drink of my blood Oh what are you tasting I pray we're not eating the devil Amen but we've eaten Jesus the revelation a man so the instincts of the flesh is see taste feel a lot of people go by their natural feelings but we got to be governed by a spiritual not the natural amen with the natural you'll cry with the spiritual you'll laugh yeah the National you'll cry with the spiritual you'll rejoice amen praise the name of the Lord oh my and again see taste feel smell and the fifth is to hear what are you hearing now you hear that as Jesus will hear it with that discernment a man without anointing praise the Lord God out of us that we're gonna hear it as God hears it we're gonna see it as God sees it and if you're in conversation with sometimes family friends or neighbors a man you're deserting a spirit a man and you're hearing all that they talk lead the world yeah whether they don't quite understand it see it's like but again we we if we got a right spirit we got to keep our spirit right there problem of God said or and I know there's a lot of believers and like I said I've had to preach it against that for over 50 years a lot of believers are just a bad message message message don't talk it go live it a man your life will have more influence in your words amen so brethren I've seen so much that they just want to talk about the doctor doctor doctor doctor as the truth and in their turn what they're doing is they're creating a wrong spirit in the people and that is the truth the prophet of God warned us against that and he said you're talking to somebody and he said you your tongue be the word and if you feel these two the resentment to it he said changed the conversation to go back talking about farming and after if they're selling cars go back talking about selling cars a man why you don't want God to condemn them no no you don't want to bring it you know what you don't want that to bring it that spirit in them no no no don't want them to force them to do this because your per your your attempting them you're doing this you're doing that no brother god help us amen brother and again change their conversation you know who to talk to how to talk to them amen and we'll just keep your spirit rate and your attitude rate by the grace of Almighty God amen and again that's the instincts of your flesh but what about the instincts of your spirit and the Holy Ghost is there to control the instincts of your spirit and by that he'll control the instincts of your flesh amen you keep it under the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen though the enemy the enemy is there in your mind to control your these things of your flesh God is in the soul to control the instance of your spirit and to control your flesh has not change it no no you're changing your soul a man and you got an interesting in your soul of faith to control your spirit and through the spirit control your flesh amen so you're not going to yield to the devil you're gonna let Jesus lead he knows the way amen if spirit is right he's attitude he's right his motives and objectives are right so we got to keep our motives on my lord help us please don't listen no matter what you got no matter what you know it won't you won't have self-righteousness amen but yet there's many believers are self-righteous oh I believe this I know this I know that I know that no we are sinners saved by grace a man what I know is by the grace of God and what you know is by the grace of God so there's grace for us even in this hour what's going on in the world and around the world right now we thank God for grace grace to us that brings us his peace that gives us his rest amen that gives us the love of God in us a man you're not there rejoicing because this is happening to them we thank God that all these things are signs of the end but we pray for those that are being influenced as brother Bob pray or the brother Joseph prayed praying for those that are under under the influence of the effects of what's going on in this germ warfare amen yes brother God is not willing that any should perish the Bible says that and yet there there are believers that couldn't care less no if God reaches out their brother he'll do this in order this if you don't worry and like you say indicate if you don't right if you do right won't you also be accepted a man his heart was going out to Cain his heart was challenging Cain it was given Canaan opportunity amen brother so that that spirit in God then it's the same spirit in us now by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ amen because the word but as God don't ways not not willing that any should perish so we don't want them all to perish so as the love of God come to you the love of God flows from you to them amen so brother we don't know who's ooh somewhere by God knows that's why we keep our spirit right and our attitude right our motives and objectives right amen because you know you don't know who's gonna be a seed of God and remember the wise words is not is not going to be bad to the holiest virgin no no you want to keep your spirit right because if the prophet said remember he said they're virgins amen but they didn't have the wisdom of the wise virgins so look brother don't judge every by you you know just leave it leave it leave it leave it right now and God will use you to be a judged in the day of judgment amen brother there was a time coming yeah but right now he said the Provost said as long as the bride is on the earth is Grace any man so are we manifesting grace we can see judgment we know this is having no that's happening and because we have that revelation because we know what's going on there's grace in us reaching out to somebody else amen by the grace of Almighty God amen consider Jesus on Calvary amen Father forgive them for they know not what they do amen so brother the instincts of our spirit is imagination yeah so as the Holy Ghost control your imagination we're led by the spirit controlled by the spirit the Holy Spirit the life of the blood of Jesus that does that control your imagination as the devil brother let the Holy Ghost come out of your heart into your spirit and on into your mind amen to control our imaginations that we're thinking on him meditate of the Lord meditate on his playing these purpose amen meditate on what God is doing what God has done what he's gonna do see we're living in the spirit that's why a lot of believers they just don't want to get out of here they don't want to leave yet oh we'll we'll go later on we'll go we'll go you're why because they're so caught up with the natural things of life they don't want to be interfered with that's the truth I've met a lot of so-called believers and they're so caught up with this they're gonna do this they're gonna do that listen listen listen let's be raptured let's focus on them down the spirit so let's focus on what God wants us to do amen not the natural oh yeah if it's your if a as a person and regardless of who you are where if this is your responsibility to do that in the natural you go do it but give the glory to Jesus hey man you do it in the name of the Lord whatever you do you do in the name of the Lord you're gonna do it for the glory of God a man even when I was over there in in in in the business world and so on I was I was giving the glory to God I said Lord what I do and the way I do it and the spirit I have I want to want to give you the glory hey man hey man and again again on and they question me out come you're like this I cover your attitudes like that you had this attitude you had this action and reaction what the others are you know did but they appreciated my actions and my reactions it wasn't me it was Jesus hey man see so regards to what I was doing before this one or two that one of somebody else it wasn't me it was Jesus yeah one of these days they'll get the revelation oh I like I said like I told you before oh you know the problem God said Oh John's got a part on on the screen in heaven and he said Oh Lord you manifested you you said you come to me you witness to me I never met you and he said yes you did and he said here short on the screen it might be brother Chad him yes him what do you yes that's me glory we're all looking at Jesus has seen this a man will recognize this my brother Oh My Jesus relief reflecting in you a man yes well eventually raise you up as a witness again to let this person all that he reveal himself to them through you a may he reveal himself to them from me amen and again I I've been questioning self and you do this as you know I said I'm leaving them with the Lord Oh to their mouths just religious to him some of them I was just fanatical but to others they respected it a man like I said when I was to that funeral there some time ago maybe a couple almost couple years ago and those two older women came came to visit to speak to myself and sister Betty after the funeral and oh you don't know me no I said I don't know you and she said you don't remember us No she said we worked for you when I was the manager of a store there and manager of the mall she said we weren't for you and I so I didn't know yes if I want to thank you she said my child was sick and she said that she said I I asked you to pray for her and she she got well and he said now she said she's alive married and got her own family and like I told you I called me even her daughter called me on the phone one time she found out where I was whoever was the number and everything she searched it why because now she had a child and that child was sick amen she said brothers you prayed for me now I want you to pray for my daughter a man she was just a child now she had a child and praise the Lord as I said I could take you to a store here at st. John's and I could show you exactly where we were in that store and this couple and children came over and we to me they knew me I didn't know them they said I called you and I asked you to pray for my child she said here she is she was grown to maybe a few years old them you know I said what yes she said thank you thank God that he answered prayer amen this give the glory to Jesus amen they see you not not as all your this your that your in the natural world but they see you as a Christian that's right they know that your spiritual not necessarily religious greatest brother a man and okay what you're in what you're doing let's be spiritual yeah and say like oh my I don't know about mentioned names but me but it's gone on now he was a politician and and I know you know it or not it was the father of our prime minister now it was it was a Trudeau and it was Pierre Pierre Elliott Trudeau a man and there they wanted to know whether you believe this he said listen I'm a Christian he saw I believe God hey man I said I I suppose Mays I was surprised so what yeah he was a Christian he said and he wouldn't identify with this church or that church no no he's I'm a Christian amen to God be the glory amen are you Christian brother I prayed brother Robby as the public God said you're gonna be surprised who made it and who didn't make it hey man oh that woman yeah they made it let's see what spirit they got see what attitude they got see what their actions are and their reactions and brother listen let's let it let it show that we're under the influence of Almighty God and not the devil and yet there are a lot of believers under the influence of the devil and they're worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God Road it's gonna be so close brother if it wasn't like that that close why would God permit it in the New Testament warning after warning after warning concerning being deceived amen and they'll show signs and wonders and they'll do this and they'll do that yeah he said make you believe this make you believe that you should be careful mister they're false prophets amen so let's make sure that our imagination conscience memory amen reason and affection is under the influence of the Holy Ghost in your soul the Holy Ghost with yourself why he would control your spirit and he would control a man your thoughts and the instincts of your flesh and the feelings of your flesh god help us brother he's my prayer didn't mean to get into this but again the grace of God okay man so let's pray that God is bringing out in us the Holy Ghost God is bringing out in yellow and he may more and more of the revelation of Christ amen and not by doctrine but by the life you live amen there's too many thing order to bringing out this doctrine this doctrine that day that's right but again it's got a cry seen you a man if not God will turn it away no matter how good you are and your doctor no worry I'll write you and your doctrine where's the life where's your spirit where's your attitude what about your actions you don't seem to everything on the inside again this time probably brought it in the seals not just say oh brother I believe the message no we should no live the message reflect the message amen not in word only but in your thoughts in your words and in your deeds by the grace of God amen praise the Lord and God is allowing what he is allowing to bring out the spirit of the unbeliever the mate believers and the believer again as under me remind you as that brothers a few years ago emailed me and said he said listen he said sir he said I read the Bible three times and he said I don't believe it he said what and he said because he said there are too many mistakes he's seen mistakes he was under the wrong anointing and so he said so he said sir he said I can't believe this I can't believe that and so because of all the mistakes of the Bible and that's why I explained to him that God rolled it in such a way you know always to is to do this do that do that I said remember it's for three different groups believers make believers and unbelievers I said he rolled it this way for the unbeliever and I say voted this way he allowed this to be pretty and now dead to happen what for make believers but I said the believers gonna believe it period so I said I said which one are you so I saw you a believer make believer or non-believer so as I said he'd never come back so I trust by the grace of God then he'll find himself a believer a man but again we're not willing that any should perish that's why we're praying and pleading the token for family friends and neighbors a man by the grace of God and also there was something that I wanted to express there was amazing that I was shocked when I brother Joseph mentioned in his prayer I said Lord what's going on what was the dimension but anybody know we do it would you be able to focus in on this one thing that our brother mentioned the significance of it the importance of it well brother Joseph mentioned his prayer brother Tim Pruett mentioned in a sermon Donnie Reigate mentioned in his sermon and then I heard brother Barry coffee mentioned in his sermon and then brother Chad lamb mentioned in his sermon then others mentioned it this will mention that one mission I said Lord I said this is amazing that at this hour and this time that they're all elated that it was Scripture and it was Psalms 91 and I received an email I think it was last week or a few days ago from brother Karsan and he said brother he said this is 9-1-1 he said for emergency they called 911 for our emergencies let's go to mountain 91 1 he says Psalms 91 verse 1 Amen so I'm gonna ask you turn with me to Psalms 91 they may praise the Lord Psalms 91 this tremendous ISIL or discovery a reason somewhere that you're allowing the Brethren to bring this out a man why did our ministry and brethren I like this this reference a man and not only message believers message preachers but there's also other preachers that I heard they mentioned this they mentioned that so I said oh God I said where in this hour were in the end and I said you're bringing us all back to this scripture right here god help us and in Psalm 91 in verse 1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most I shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty amen our brother Donny Reagan was bringing it out highlighting even the first verse so brother you want to dial nine-one-one this is the one to die amen this this brings us deliverance this gives us rest and peace amen he that dwelleth you got to dwell Amen not go in and out but you got to live there he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most I shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty you want you want the assurance of his presence well dwell in the secret place of the Most High and he said I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence praise the Lord Aaron Auer we needed is this our and he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler that's the word a man thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day don't be afraid of what's going on the world have faith in God and have the faith of God a man nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a Thousand shall fall a thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee see I agreed to the quote concerning all those that under the baptism of the Holy Ghost are going to the one experience it that's our protection amen it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked were seen it we're seen it God's allowing us to Satan's in control because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most i thy avocation praise the Lord o brother she is totally in Christ it's totally in the Lord and the Lord in you and he said Jesus warns her Jesus give us the promise in John he said in that day he said he said all his problems oh yeah and her brother again trying to prove the Trinity a certain won't say what to church she was on and he was saying listen brother this is the Trinity right here jesus said Jesus will pray the father one Jesus is two he said that he will give you another comforter three he said there's a Trinity there's three persons and like I said I wrote my email back and I said brother I wrote back brother nicer brother I said you need to go on and I said read the next few verses amen because he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so I said who's the carpenter and he said in that day you'll know what I mean the father the father and me I in you and you and me so I said brother where's the Trinity I said they're all one there any man brother stay with the word the whole truth nothing but the truth don't take it out of context weathers to where there's their Bible where there's the message of the hour don't take anything out of context leave it the way that it is no wonder in the seals that Papa said after the sails he said now he said don't make it bigger than what it is don't make it smaller than what it is leave it he said the way that it is a man but many a believer many people - did he'll take this in the Bible there take that in the message and they'll make it bigger than what it is or smaller than one of these rather leave it the way the disease amen it'll accomplish what God has ordained in your life and in mine God else because as made the Lord which is my refuge even the most i thy avocation is he is that what you is that what God is in you in your life therefore shall there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways amen the Angels praise the Lord well God is here but what would the angels are we conscious of the angels god help us as a prophet said your siave about twelve feet from you at any given time that's right it's just our mistakes and wrong attitude wrong spirit whatever that'll cause him to move away but that's just a convict you and then when you repent so Lars forgive me and he comes back yeah it's like that brother that was preaching one time and brother branham was sitting on the platform behind it and when he was preaching that there were times and even he would turn around go back and shake brother baoshan and come back and preach again why he felt certain thing that the anointing was pulling away pulling away you go back shake the Prophet saying come preach oh yeah he did that a number of times yeah by the grace of God he was recognizing that there was a ninety now that man amen praise the Lord hallelujah he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone god help us we need any more spiritual they were more spiritual with the more conscious of the spiritual things of God no no no wait till this happens and that happens then to drive us to the Lord no stay with the Lord you know I pray grace that you got the revelation of oneness in that day Jesus said you like you'll know though I mean the father the father me I in you and you and me what a oneness that is with God amazing what I pray grace that we are truly a man truly borned again so that's not me that lives this Christ that liveth in me but there's a lot of believers it's not Jesus in them you know no not Jesus they're just it's just a devil but it's a religious devil as the Prophet said the devil is religious yeah not necessary spiritual but he's religious yeah so brother I pray that our 19 is not the Satan's anointing but its gods of money it's the Holy Ghost anointing and men keeping what keeping our saw it's words indeed spiritual not religious wonderful thou should tread upon the lion and the adder the young lion and the dragon shall trample under feet grace because he s said his love upon me therefore will I deliver him and I will set him on high because he has known my name praise the Lord and he shall call upon me praise the Lord he had known my name but those that baptize in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost they don't know the me he's amazing isn't it the same would influence them to do that and in the in the early church ages they did baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because why they knew that was the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost because this same Jesus has been made Lord and Christ a man so they knew that but yet Satan got in there and Satan whispered something oh yeah they threw his threw his false prophets on that they thought they were servants of God but they weren't and they changed it well just father son Holy Ghost and brother that's when they changed it in India trot around a year 300 AD that's when they say that's when they changed because that's when that deeds of the Nicolaitans and so on they became not just a doctrine it became a church that was the first denominational Church it was the Roman Catholic Church and their water baptism father son Holy Ghost Jesus was left behind as it were yeah the name oh yeah and they went onto the name that titles in the name of the church name of the church name of the church amen the God said I would restore a man minister named all thank God for the word amen thank God for the understanding the revelation thank God for his plan and his purpose and his pattern a man nature tread upon the lion and the adder the young lion of the dragon show that I trample under feet brother that can go right over here in revelation concerning the endtime oh yeah no wonder I said Lord no wonder ice there's so many readings Psalms 91 amazing you know a lot of the preachers that I saw online when we weren't we weren't having services here and so on it this is amazing but brother God's in his word and it says because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I was said about high because he has known my name amen praise God for the name and he should call upon me and I will answer him and I will be with him in trouble I would deliver him and honor him let's believe it they go for that manifested in your life and that's that's the deliverance aim and he said I would be with you in trouble he's there amen I would deliver you and I will honor you if your attitudes right your spears right oh yeah your you'll be honored yeah is that right oh yes in Revelation again well God made a promise to them to the church age Wesley and he saw he said I'm gonna bring you up sit on throne and he they're gonna come and bow down to you yeah that's what he promised praise the Lord I would deliver him and honor him to let to allow you him to sit with you to wait with him and his interest or any strong praise the Lord brother just think this this is time your eternity down to a time dead back to eternity in Psalms 91 you know again as our brother Carsten would encourage you dialed 9-1-1 a man that's good and he shall call upon me and I will answer him speak the word I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation thank God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen turn with me to Exodus 32 Haizi Exodus chapter 32 I have to try to bring it to a conclusion and again I didn't intend to go this way when I come out I had it all planned do this do this do this but no I've got actually through it yet thank God amen so in Exodus chapter 32 and let's begin to read at verse 15 and Moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on their both sides both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written beginning and end no an Alpha and Omega and the tables were the work of God and the writing was the writing of God just think oh my believing that they open the seven seals was God a man not William Brennan and the writing was the writing of God graven upon the tables God help us pay attention to the word and when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto Moses there is a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is or the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do I hear okay was it right or wrong it was wrong and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the cat and the dancing and Moses anger waxed art you think oh well that sounds good they're shouting they're dancing they're singing no do you know he was right it wasn't Elohim they're under another anointing oh yeah just make sure his people get religious and then get over they sound good sound what this sounds good yeah make sure it's the right spirit make sure it's the right anointing but no Moses discerned there was something wrong and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp they saw the calf and the dancing and Moses anger waxed lot and he cast the tables out of his hands and braked them beneath the mount the word just think it was the Word of God oh my but here's Moses that had received the Word of God on carved in those stones he took it and threw it down and smashed it and it broke out grace and he took the calf which they had made and burned it in the fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink the water yeah oh maybe they even want to do it but they had to you know because it was under the influence Joshua yeah Joshua or Aaron they influenced him what for to make a an image and he made the image he said this is the God that brought you out of Egypt no it wasn't he was he was with the Moses in the in the Mount Moses came down with his word yeah but they weren't in that spirit and that attitude to receive the word Moses smashed it yeah god help us and it says he took the calf and he burned it grind it to powder pour in the water made the term of Israel drink of it and Moses said unto Aaron what did this people unto thee that thou has brought so great as sin upon them yeah they're worshipping idols like those that worship brother Branham but the emphasis on brother Joseph oh yeah no no it's Jesus brother all that God did was to bring Jesus into the camp all that God did was to make Jesus give Jesus preeminence hey man why because he had come he has come down for his bride he came to redeem his bride now he's coming for his bride there's not with him Brendan not by any means and is not not brother Joseph all due respect god bless them a man no by any means brother God is looking for our worship amen Christ and he said and Aaron said let not the anger of my Lord wax art thou knowest the people they are set on mischief amazing they're born that way for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us and as for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we know not what has become of him and I said unto them whosoever have any gold let him break it off so they gave it me and then I cast it into the fire and there came out this calf amazing that Aaron would fall into that influence and again brother it wasn't they weren't serving the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob they're serving the devil they're worshipping the devil getting preeminence to the devil and when Moses saw that the people were naked for Aaron had made them naked on to their shame among their enemies and then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said it was on the Lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto Him and he said unto them thus saith the Lord God of Israel put and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbor and the children and the Israel and the throne of Levi did according to the word of Moses and just think and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men yes and the same thing is happening now because there's many that are dying spiritually why because they make God's out of this and gods that have a doctrine gods that are out of them out of a man no god help us rather let's get the preeminence to Jesus a man and let's go to Exodus chapter 34 I'll have to bring it to a conclusion we've gone for about an hour Exodus 34 and beat this see verse eight and Moses made ace Bowser's head toward the earth and worshiped and he said if now I have found grace in thy sight O Lord let my lord I pray they go among us for it is a stiff-necked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance a man and the Moses at the second table of stones amen and he said behold I make a covenant before all thy people I will do marbles such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee observe though that as which circum I command thee this day behold I Drive out before the the amorite the Canaanite the hittite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite take heed to thyself lest I'll make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whether thou goest let it be for a snare in the midst of thee rather we make no covenant with this whole world no we just do what we got to do in this world and we're moving on in the word and believing for the resurrection and rapture we're going out of this world as I said many just don't want to be don't want God to interfere with them Lord I got to do this I gotta do this I gotta do that know they're gonna be left here to do it but the bride's gonna go see Joshua Katie wasn't caught up with what was going on there in the wilderness they were still caught up with the revelation of the promised land and so you and I are caught up with the revelation of the promised land get out of here I don't want to stay oh I want to enjoy this I want to do this I want to no forget it but yet people are caught up with wanting to do the natural things of life they don't want anybody to interfere god help us and again verse 12 - he to thyself lest I make a covenant with I mean evidence of the land whither thou goest let it be for a snare in the midst of thee but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down the growth by the grace of God amen you see not sure let's see for thou shalt worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God let's not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go whoring after their their gods and do sacrifice under their gods and one call me and thou eat of his sacrifice and take and thou take all their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods make thy sons go home after their gods thou shall make thee know molten gods amen grace in the name of Jesus brother the influence of Satan in the wilderness there's the influence of Satan in the promised land the influence of Satan during the church ages and the influence of God yes in the bright age grace of God be with us for the glory of God who is influencing your thoughts today who is influencing your words today and your deeds the grace of God I pray put us on our guard amen let me just leave you with a couple of quotes that we might I might have considered already I think I read them I did read this one here was just a reminder and he's speaking of the devil and the things that went on in a certain age he said how beautiful the scripture ties them together in every age and he said when the church he said would not have had to have the Word of God to rule over them they accepted a murderer Barabbas they didn't want Jesus they said give us Barabbas crucify Jesus oh my he said what did this do it exalted Satan the god of this evil age to a place that he always wanted he says now listen Satan is not spoke off as the god of any other age but this age he wasn't spoke of the God of Noah's age he's the God of the age of Moses - God of the age of Elijah but this evil age he said don't miss it he is the god of this evil age and worshiped oh my this is amazing he is worshipped by millions and billions of people and they don't know who are you worshiping make sure it's Jesus they met he said he's not called the God of any other age but this age it was his ambition to be like God from the very beginning Amen yeah he wanted to be exalted as God he is what he was working on and has been working on and now he's come to it and he is worshipped as God amen and he said he has not made the world a better to live in he has made the world better to sin in not living but to see because why he has legalized sin and he has everything is becoming legal now this contrary to the word you can't preach against it you can't do anything against it no no so we pray the grace of God Alvis just maintain our state for the truth they may he's legalized sin he's legalized whiskey he's legalized drinking cigarette smoking and the church has legalized that when women could be a member of the church with short air oh he said oh I said she can wear shorts paint and still belong to the religious group which is absolutely contrary to the Word of God see that was Satan's knowledge amen and that's what he's doing so we'll leave it right there brother the influence of the god of this evil age we pray grace that run under the influence of our Lord Jesus Christ amen nor bless your listing we're gonna sing amazing grace that saved a wretch like me yes Amen once we're lost but now I'm found was blind but now by the grace
