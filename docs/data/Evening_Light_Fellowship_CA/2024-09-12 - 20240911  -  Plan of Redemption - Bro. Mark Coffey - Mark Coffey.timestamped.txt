[49:00] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[49:03] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[49:05] God is with men and he will dwell with
[49:08] them and they shall be his people and
[49:10] God himself shall be with them and be
[49:13] their God and God shall wipe away all
[49:15] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[49:18] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[49:22] neither shall there be any more pain for
[49:25] the former things are passed away
[49:27] and he that sat upon the throne said
[49:30] behold I have I make all things new and
[49:34] he said unto me right for these words
[49:36] are true and faithful amen wonderful you
[49:40] may be seated at this
[49:42] time so just to uh introduce myself
[49:46] again after many years I haven't been up
[49:49] here since uh not here last time it's
[49:52] said 19 no 2020
[49:56] and uh in the old church and uh as you
[50:00] know I used to kind of uh uh come in
[50:05] behind when brother Gerald is wasn't
[50:07] with us and to minister and uh he's not
[50:10] here tonight I know he's away so uh so I
[50:15] uh and I stepped down uh for uh health
[50:18] reasons uh was one reason and for what I
[50:21] was going through with the heart
[50:23] episodes and uh and also just to we were
[50:27] in a change over at the time and the
[50:30] younger people were coming in and the
[50:32] older people were starting to move out
[50:33] of these and you see the changes were
[50:36] with brother Jonathan and you know uh
[50:39] Brother Joseph and the Deacon role and
[50:41] brother Matthew and and you know that's
[50:44] what was happening and and it was a good
[50:46] time for someone younger to come in to
[50:48] fill in brother brother Paul was doing
[50:50] the Sunday school so it was a natural
[50:52] progression for him to come in and uh to
[50:55] uh uh sub substitute in when he needed
[50:58] to so that was the the the logic of that
[51:01] right so I didn't need to really get up
[51:03] anymore but uh so for this time so what
[51:06] are you doing up here uh so you know I
[51:09] just uh felt uh just LED at this time
[51:13] and and the health has been better thank
[51:14] God and these things so I I uh I have
[51:20] improved and I'm
[51:23] thankful so I'm gonna try to get to this
[51:27] here uh I I do lean to prophecy of
[51:30] course I like that and I like the Book
[51:32] of Revelation done a lot of we've done a
[51:34] lot of studies on that and things that
[51:37] you know the reason why things happen
[51:39] and the the you know what why things
[51:42] happen the way they do and what's the
[51:44] process that God has and things like
[51:46] that and trying to pick through those
[51:48] things and it's always uh uh a good
[51:50] thing for me so
[51:54] um and I do use a teaching method here
[51:58] you know I was Sunday school for years
[52:00] and years and that's what we used to do
[52:02] was teach so this is just carried on and
[52:04] here and I do it through a presentation
[52:07] and that's mostly so people look up
[52:09] there probably right it's mostly a
[52:11] reason and this will this will look at
[52:14] uh tonight we're just going to look at
[52:16] Revelation again and uh I've gone into
[52:19] uh a an an area uh and it comes from
[52:23] future home uh and I say future home PA
[52:26] of the Heavenly uh the long title but I
[52:30] just shortened it there just for space
[52:32] on the slides but it's a very uh uh
[52:37] going through it it's it's very uh you
[52:40] know what you would call intense message
[52:44] if there's a lot of things in there and
[52:45] a lot of layers and brother Braham
[52:47] didn't dabble around he he didn't go off
[52:50] not he or anything like that he didn't
[52:53] come for anything but to uh really get
[52:55] down to the plan of God so that's what
[52:59] he was doing so uh I didn't realize how
[53:03] much until I uh started to look into it
[53:07] the layers of it right I I'm I'm going
[53:10] to take one section here of it that's
[53:12] all Just one thought going through it so
[53:16] it'll be uh but there's so much more in
[53:19] that message the future home and it's a
[53:22] wonderful message definitely one of a
[53:24] key message and and harvest time which
[53:27] is preached right after that uh in
[53:30] December of of 64 also uh he he touches
[53:35] on a lot of the same ideas so two of
[53:38] them are kind of
[53:40] connected
[53:41] uh so we'll look we'll try to look at
[53:44] you know we try to look at what God how
[53:47] he does things how he's carrying out his
[53:49] plan and how what he's done and what
[53:53] he's doing and what he's going to do so
[53:56] it's just trying to get an eye around
[53:57] that and uh there would be uh there
[54:02] would be
[54:03] no uh no uh explanation at all without a
[54:08] prophet it took a prophet uh to do the
[54:12] think and uh in this last uh you know as
[54:18] a son of man as a prophet
[54:20] Ministry uh you know these are the
[54:23] things we see pivotal things happen like
[54:26] when when uh Paul came he he needed a
[54:30] profit because it was a change we were
[54:33] making a turn and brother BR often
[54:35] talked about the wall and going in a
[54:37] straight line and and you know that
[54:40] wasn't really uh the ministry of a
[54:43] prophet that was a a messenger in the
[54:45] age could do that but when it came to
[54:48] the to changing God would send a prophet
[54:52] and uh certainly uh it was certainly
[54:57] required in uh in Paul's day and for
[55:01] what he did and it was huge you know in
[55:05] terms of uh what we're reading in the
[55:07] Bible and uh getting us ready for that
[55:10] all that period and brother BR was the
[55:13] same way and he had so many roles in
[55:15] Malachi 4 and as the messenger in lead
[55:19] DEA and as the as the one to get the
[55:22] bride ready for Christ and you know
[55:25] there was
[55:26] uh you know just so many things roles
[55:29] that he had to play there uh the last
[55:32] time and for ending closing down really
[55:35] the Gentiles and uh getting getting this
[55:38] ready to be passed over to the to the
[55:41] Jews so he had a lot of layers there and
[55:45] and also a gift of Min uh healing that
[55:49] uh was you know used right out for all
[55:52] his ministry so he was certainly busy
[55:55] and had a lot to do there and you can
[55:57] see his uh such an important role in in
[56:02] uh in his work today don't don't mind
[56:04] it's emotional part of me I think a lot
[56:06] of it is uh it's been since the uh
[56:10] medications you know I think they affect
[56:12] me like that but uh hopefully it'll pass
[56:16] here uh so let's just uh let's just turn
[56:19] into uh the scripture here at the next
[56:23] slide uh Luke 2
[56:27] 2538 so if we it's just a bit long but
[56:30] we'll just uh go through this is
[56:32] familiar and behold there was a man in
[56:35] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[56:37] same man was just and devout waiting for
[56:40] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[56:42] Ghost was upon him and it was revealed
[56:45] unto him by the holy ghost that he
[56:48] should not see death before he had seen
[56:52] the Lord's Christ and he came by the
[56:55] spirit into to the temple and when the
[56:57] parents brought in the Child Jesus to do
[56:59] for him after the custom of the law then
[57:02] took he him up into his arms and blessed
[57:05] God and said Lord now lettest thou thy
[57:08] servant depart in peace according to Thy
[57:11] word for thine eyes have seen thy
[57:14] salvation which thou has prepared before
[57:17] the face of all people a light to
[57:19] lighten the Gentiles and the glory of
[57:21] thy People Israel and Joseph and his
[57:24] mother marveled at those things which
[57:25] were spoken of him and Simon blessed
[57:28] them and said unto Mary his mother
[57:31] behold this child is set for the fall
[57:33] and Rising again of many in Israel and
[57:36] for a sign which shall be spoken
[57:40] against that the thoughts of many hearts
[57:42] may be revealed and there was one Anna a
[57:45] prophetess the daughter of f fenel of
[57:48] the tribe of azer she was of great age
[57:51] and had lived with an husband s years
[57:54] from her virginity and she was Widow of
[57:57] about 4 score and four years which
[57:59] departed not from the temple but served
[58:01] god with fastings and prayers night and
[58:04] day and she coming to that instant gave
[58:06] thanks likewise unto the Lord and spoke
[58:09] unto him to all them that looked for
[58:12] redemption in Israel very very uh
[58:15] familiar scripture but just so so
[58:18] beautiful of
[58:19] scripture
[58:21] so
[58:23] uh so in the
[58:27] I should get the uh guer I'm forgetting
[58:29] all of it sorry bear with
[58:33] me I was waiting for them to change
[58:35] it so so here uh in this in this uh it's
[58:42] a very familiar scripture and if we saw
[58:45] this before in years past but we just go
[58:49] down to it now the it's from a
[58:52] perfection in
[58:54] 1956 and uh
[58:56] it says and now the great chain of
[58:58] perfection has was was broken by time
[59:03] space time came because of sin so let's
[59:07] draw a picture at this time let's see A
[59:10] Perfect Circle forever and ever and then
[59:12] all at once sin dropped in and put a put
[59:16] a little as my wife calls it a little
[59:19] hickey this is a fellow from
[59:22] Kentucky uh or a little drop in the
[59:26] chain so it comes down now eternity
[59:29] continues on but it's not in its perfect
[59:33] condition so we've seen this before this
[59:37] uh picture and I'm sure you're you're
[59:39] used to it here but uh this is how
[59:42] brother brandom is going to go in and
[59:44] explained about the plan of God and how
[59:46] God went about it so here
[59:53] and and then all at once s Dr dropped in
[59:56] and put a little as my wife calls it a
[59:58] little hickey or a little drop in the
[1:00:00] chain so it comes down now and it
[1:00:02] eternity continues but it's not in its
[1:00:06] perfect condition so we see this this uh
[1:00:10] uh fall this eternity is going on and
[1:00:14] then then uh uh because of the Garden of
[1:00:18] Eden and what happened in the Garden of
[1:00:20] Eden God had it all perfect and there
[1:00:22] was sin in the garden and it had to be
[1:00:24] dealt with and God could have sin in
[1:00:27] eternity he could not be in there with
[1:00:29] that so this is what he did he dropped
[1:00:32] this down and this is
[1:00:35] really just this this was going to be
[1:00:39] time and that marked out by the Old
[1:00:41] Testament and New Testament so this is
[1:00:42] the whole es of time and this is where
[1:00:44] we are now we are in Time and Eternity
[1:00:48] is still there it's still going on but
[1:00:50] it's but as he said eternity continues
[1:00:52] but it's not in its perfect condition
[1:00:54] and it dropped down to a space of time
[1:00:57] for the trying and the perfecting and
[1:01:00] for the purging of the loss that God by
[1:01:02] his Sovereign Grace May someday lift
[1:01:04] that little hickey or Gap back into the
[1:01:07] perfect circle so after time is
[1:01:09] completed it is just drawn right back up
[1:01:12] and it's just it goes on as the perfect
[1:01:14] circle very
[1:01:16] simple
[1:01:19] time so as we go on time now time is
[1:01:23] this little Loop that Loops down Jes
[1:01:25] Jesus from eternity to Eternity but he
[1:01:28] stepped into the time spaces made flesh
[1:01:32] and came through here in order to
[1:01:33] sanctify or put a streak of blood all
[1:01:36] across this place to redeem it and
[1:01:39] connect it with God again for all
[1:01:42] eternity you see it right so we see so
[1:01:46] we see this and brother brandham
[1:01:49] explains as time is a shadow and I
[1:01:51] couldn't Shadow it for some reason I
[1:01:53] just couldn't make that gray just to
[1:01:55] shap it was it was a certain shape but
[1:01:57] we live just imagine but it's a gray
[1:02:00] area and if if and and you should be
[1:02:03] able to uh you know identify with that
[1:02:06] as being in a gray area we we were we
[1:02:09] are gray about it now in this age you
[1:02:12] know it's because of the the sevens and
[1:02:15] uh uh brother Lonnie explained uh Lonnie
[1:02:18] Jenkins he explained sevens and he said
[1:02:21] that really we go through these sevens 1
[1:02:23] 2 3 4 5 6 7even and what Whatever It Is
[1:02:26] God doesn't really explain it until we
[1:02:29] get into the seventh so if you're
[1:02:31] talking about church ages we we didn't
[1:02:33] know anything about the church ages and
[1:02:34] what the whole overall picture was until
[1:02:37] the 7th and it takes a prophet to come
[1:02:39] in and do this and God will bring down a
[1:02:41] prophet in the seven so if you look at
[1:02:43] seven trumpets seven trumpets BR Bram
[1:02:47] didn't have a a view of the seven
[1:02:49] trumpets because it wasn't his time and
[1:02:51] it wasn't the seventh we don't go into
[1:02:53] the seventh until Revelation 11 11 is
[1:02:56] when the SE the Jews go through the
[1:02:58] seven trumpet which is just as
[1:03:01] significant the trumpets and the seals
[1:03:03] is just as significance to each group
[1:03:05] and the seventh and the seventh is just
[1:03:07] as significant but it's in those seventh
[1:03:10] that everything gets gets uh uh
[1:03:14] explained to the Believers right and it
[1:03:17] would be to the redeemed to the ones
[1:03:19] that could receive the Holy Ghost who
[1:03:21] are going to receive that from that from
[1:03:24] that uh revelation it's not there
[1:03:26] there's a whole group of people that are
[1:03:29] saved under the you know under under
[1:03:32] this destru destruction there's a whole
[1:03:34] group that's right but then there's the
[1:03:36] redeemed and the redeemed can receive
[1:03:39] the holy spirit amen those saved under
[1:03:41] destruction cannot they will have to go
[1:03:43] through in in our era they'll have to go
[1:03:46] through through the tribulation in order
[1:03:48] to be given eternal life they they won't
[1:03:52] receive it like the uh the or and there
[1:03:55] will be you know the the foolish virgins
[1:03:58] and there will be you know the 144,000
[1:04:01] they they don't go that way and then
[1:04:03] there's the uh different ones you know
[1:04:07] through the the ages that God has and he
[1:04:10] has a plan for all of this right he has
[1:04:12] a plan for us he has a plan for all of
[1:04:14] us he's a mastermind for all of this and
[1:04:17] he has it all planned out every inch of
[1:04:19] it and we don't have to worry about it's
[1:04:22] going to
[1:04:23] happen so so in this uh uh so these
[1:04:30] we're seeing now that and it's the first
[1:04:32] time if you look at the Book of
[1:04:33] Revelation it's the first time because
[1:04:36] uh it was open to Paul Paul Paul uh
[1:04:39] could see those things because uh it was
[1:04:43] closed with John so it must have been
[1:04:44] open because it existed and B quotes it
[1:04:48] right back to Genesis he talks about the
[1:04:51] the uh the the word like that and so uh
[1:04:57] once it got sealed up then it was it was
[1:05:00] uh it was just a darkness really uh and
[1:05:04] uh it was it was noted by the Messengers
[1:05:07] that went through but Paul went off the
[1:05:10] scene and then John went for two years
[1:05:11] and did the Book of Revelation but it
[1:05:13] was only Mysteries to him he he didn't
[1:05:15] understand there was they he they use
[1:05:18] symbols and things in Revelations and
[1:05:20] Paul didn't John didn't know everything
[1:05:22] it was he was blinded to a lot of things
[1:05:24] he didn't he didn't know a lot of what
[1:05:26] was going on and it went for 2,000 years
[1:05:29] and it's only in this this age that uh
[1:05:32] it was opened up to the bride so that we
[1:05:35] were're able to see it which is a
[1:05:36] wonderful thing so so the bride just in
[1:05:41] this little period of time are the ones
[1:05:43] that uh are given the knowledge of the
[1:05:46] uh all all the things in the Book of
[1:05:48] Revelation other things that go to the
[1:05:50] Jews and that that aren't into the
[1:05:52] seventh so not all of it is there but in
[1:05:56] terms of the trumpets you know uh
[1:05:58] brother brandom could see the fifth
[1:06:00] trumpet and the sixth trumpet because it
[1:06:02] happened in the 19th century and when
[1:06:04] first world war and second world war and
[1:06:06] when the Jews were all taken away so he
[1:06:07] knew that but he didn't know really he
[1:06:10] could make guesses about it and things
[1:06:12] but he didn't really know what the seven
[1:06:13] Trump was because it wasn't his ministry
[1:06:15] and that'll be done for the two prophets
[1:06:17] that come with the 144,000 and we know
[1:06:20] that and has nothing to do with us we'll
[1:06:21] be gone by then it'll all be over for us
[1:06:26] so so in in in this in this case here in
[1:06:29] this picture there was eternity and it
[1:06:32] was all set up with Adam and Eve but
[1:06:34] Adam and Eve sinned and they this this
[1:06:37] Loop this hickey as he calls it falls
[1:06:40] down and this is this is where we saw
[1:06:43] time starting to happen and this is
[1:06:45] where where sin was it was all sin and
[1:06:49] and God himself he couldn't be in there
[1:06:53] he does come in body in in a in a form
[1:06:56] He's Able he has done it right from
[1:06:58] Genesis that if you take like MDC or
[1:07:01] someone like that he could go into that
[1:07:03] body but he could never as himself God
[1:07:06] himself come down unless he was in a
[1:07:09] body and protected from that that sin
[1:07:12] environment and he did that and that was
[1:07:14] all revealed in this uh in this age all
[1:07:17] that was that was never known that
[1:07:20] that's the way God is and the people you
[1:07:23] know in the in the uh denominational
[1:07:26] world would make it out to three gods
[1:07:28] and try to figure it out how it was
[1:07:29] happening by having different numbers of
[1:07:32] gods one two three whatever but uh we
[1:07:35] understand that it was God in a form
[1:07:37] coming down in different different ways
[1:07:39] in all through those times and saw it in
[1:07:42] with Moses or saw it with Joshua or saw
[1:07:45] all that God appearing into those to
[1:07:49] those prophets and and ministers in a
[1:07:51] different form but it was really Christ
[1:07:53] coming down so
[1:07:56] so so we're getting at to the point is
[1:07:59] we know if we look at that in terms of
[1:08:01] time we're almost at the end of time
[1:08:03] we're getting to the end of Eternity
[1:08:05] where we will be going back into
[1:08:07] eternity and uh uh we'll see it ending
[1:08:10] up although time as we know goes to the
[1:08:13] end of the Millennium there's still time
[1:08:14] to the end of the Millennium right so we
[1:08:17] we'll we'll get into that a little bit
[1:08:19] after but I think we all know that we
[1:08:21] still in time in Millennium and and it's
[1:08:24] after the Millennium when there's a holy
[1:08:26] convocation and that's what I'll be
[1:08:28] going into here is talking about the
[1:08:30] Holy convocation and the burning that'll
[1:08:33] happen at that time and at the at the
[1:08:36] time also before the new heavens and new
[1:08:38] earth so we'll look at that shortly
[1:08:48] so so we know that you know we're coming
[1:08:51] up to the end we see all the signs of
[1:08:54] the end we've seen s more we see you
[1:08:56] know the days of Noah the days of the of
[1:08:59] lot all happening these two never before
[1:09:02] all two of them happened at the one time
[1:09:04] and you can't deny it it's it's not even
[1:09:06] a revelation anymore to see what's going
[1:09:08] on in the world so it's going to happen
[1:09:10] and also with the nuclear war you can
[1:09:13] see it's all building up for an
[1:09:15] Annihilation there's going to be it uh
[1:09:18] they they know that it can destroy the
[1:09:20] world uh with the number that you know
[1:09:23] the the countries have of nuclear
[1:09:25] weapons and it's well able to bring that
[1:09:28] Atomic cleansing that it that the world
[1:09:31] is going to get uh at at the time of the
[1:09:34] uh the the Rapture the first
[1:09:38] resurrection and uh and then it'll go
[1:09:40] into armagedon and they know that what
[1:09:43] the Bible says about that but they're
[1:09:45] still going to do it anyway there's no
[1:09:47] way of stopping it it's all going to
[1:09:48] happen so these this is the way it's
[1:09:51] going to be so in here in time and it's
[1:09:53] like a shadow and brother
[1:09:55] he uses uh in a number of places he he
[1:09:59] uh talks about this in terms of a camera
[1:10:01] film and he talks about a a negative and
[1:10:04] he Compares that shadow that Darkness to
[1:10:07] a negative it's a it's not a clear
[1:10:09] picture you know the real the the the
[1:10:12] clear picture is in eternity that's
[1:10:14] where the clear picture is where if you
[1:10:16] look at photography and you got a
[1:10:18] slide a slide and you got the picture
[1:10:21] one is clear and that's up here in
[1:10:23] reality where it's clear and then the
[1:10:25] other one when it's a shadow where it's
[1:10:26] a it's it's really a it's it's just a
[1:10:29] negative of uh really what's in there
[1:10:32] and it's only temporary and it's going
[1:10:34] to go is there a long time but God God
[1:10:37] takes his time and he he uh is he's in
[1:10:40] no
[1:10:48] rush oh I got a point over
[1:10:52] there I can't see that back there
[1:10:57] so just a couple of quotes here uh and I
[1:11:01] I want to bring your just a good few
[1:11:04] quotes in here just to let you know and
[1:11:07] I want to bring you conscious of that
[1:11:09] before we approach further this is
[1:11:11] Harvest time is just after the uh
[1:11:13] message uh uh for the future home before
[1:11:17] we approach further that God is in this
[1:11:19] room the author of the word is here amen
[1:11:22] so it doesn't it it doesn't matter how
[1:11:25] you are dressed or what degree you live
[1:11:28] in Life or what kind of a home you live
[1:11:31] in or what type of a car you drive or
[1:11:35] how much education you've got God looks
[1:11:37] at your heart and he looks in my heart
[1:11:40] and we're judged from our heart not even
[1:11:42] our words our heart judges us from the
[1:11:45] heart speaketh the mouth if it isn't
[1:11:48] it's hypocrisy that's a big statement
[1:11:50] right that he doesn't look at the
[1:11:52] actions here he looks at your desires he
[1:11:54] looks at your your heart and he's
[1:11:56] looking at at that that eternity you so
[1:12:00] you're in that you're you're up there
[1:12:03] you were an attribute of God I get this
[1:12:04] I'm getting ahead of myself but you're
[1:12:06] an attribute of God and you you were
[1:12:09] always with God if you're Eternal you
[1:12:10] are always with God that's right you
[1:12:14] know it's not like you can be made later
[1:12:16] if you're Eternal you've always you
[1:12:18] always were so in that Eternal Circle
[1:12:21] you're an attribute of God you're a a
[1:12:23] thought of God he used
[1:12:26] and that that will manifest itself
[1:12:28] eventually upon the Earth he will
[1:12:29] manifest all of that and it it'll
[1:12:32] manifest in the time now it will go to
[1:12:34] time because it'll be born through a
[1:12:37] woman so it'll have to it'll be under
[1:12:40] the original sin so it will have to be
[1:12:42] in that time area it can't be in with
[1:12:44] God himself it can't be in there because
[1:12:48] there can be no sin there and so that's
[1:12:51] how because of the the what happened in
[1:12:54] the Garden of Eden and I'm not I I
[1:12:56] wasn't going to bring in any of that
[1:12:57] because brother John's been doing that
[1:12:59] now the last while so we got a good uh
[1:13:03] you know fresh understanding of that but
[1:13:06] all all that after the original sin and
[1:13:09] what Adam and Eve didn't they were taken
[1:13:11] and and put in this Loop this time and
[1:13:14] that's where they existed and Adam not
[1:13:17] like Christ but he could couldn't get
[1:13:18] himself out of this so he was in that he
[1:13:21] was in time just like we're in time so
[1:13:24] everyone that's born and then from that
[1:13:26] seed you know it will be in that time
[1:13:29] until God God moves and uh sets it all
[1:13:32] back again into eternity and that's what
[1:13:35] we're going to look at so when the so to
[1:13:38] move on here now in this room now is
[1:13:41] coming human beings forms of human
[1:13:43] beings passing through here from all
[1:13:46] around the world voices singing in this
[1:13:48] room right now we heard brother man say
[1:13:50] this before and he's talking about in
[1:13:52] this case he's talking about television
[1:13:53] in our age but you see you are only
[1:13:56] limited in your s your senses to a
[1:13:58] certain percent of sight but now you can
[1:14:01] take the crystal or the tube or whatever
[1:14:03] it's in the television and turn it on
[1:14:06] and with the set that could deviate that
[1:14:08] on those either waves and deviate that
[1:14:12] to condense it into a channel and pick
[1:14:14] up those people someone in Australia
[1:14:17] South Africa or where India or whatever
[1:14:20] it may
[1:14:22] be and but of course but Bram could see
[1:14:25] this all the time he could he could see
[1:14:27] things in this other dimension because
[1:14:29] of the gift he had as a prophet right
[1:14:32] that's what he could see many times in
[1:14:34] his discernment so we didn't and even
[1:14:36] ourselves you know we have those
[1:14:37] experience with that where we can touch
[1:14:39] that Eternal part you know there's
[1:14:41] things that are open you can see it it
[1:14:43] comes it comes uh and manifests in some
[1:14:46] way to you sometimes and of course as a
[1:14:48] prophet he could almost live in that he
[1:14:50] could he could see he could go back and
[1:14:52] he could go ahead and that's where he
[1:14:54] was as is in that Eternal Circle
[1:14:59] right so it's a real thing and we know
[1:15:02] it's real right then it got to be
[1:15:04] somewhere hid from our eyes that same
[1:15:07] thing is passing through here now it
[1:15:10] passed through here when Abraham heard
[1:15:12] God say look up towards the star I said
[1:15:15] this is significant because Adam Abraham
[1:15:17] didn't have TV in his day you know he
[1:15:20] had the mechanism for it but they never
[1:15:22] had invented any of that yet so it
[1:15:23] wasn't there and Abraham he could see he
[1:15:27] could see things in that Dimension right
[1:15:29] that's right so he could he knew that
[1:15:31] there was things going in there he heard
[1:15:33] God say look up towards the star and it
[1:15:35] was here when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel
[1:15:38] it was here all of this was here when
[1:15:40] Adam was here but they just now
[1:15:43] discovered it really they Now understand
[1:15:45] it it's a scientific thing but to them
[1:15:47] but it was always there and we know it
[1:15:49] was there you can read it like you know
[1:15:51] Jacob you know with Jacob's letter he
[1:15:53] could see that that ladder and at the
[1:15:56] entrance into that Eternal Circle that
[1:15:58] heavens and he could see Angels going up
[1:16:01] and down and to see things like that
[1:16:02] because he had that gift right and like
[1:16:05] on Mount Transfiguration you know uh you
[1:16:08] know mo uh Peter and those they could
[1:16:11] see all those things that was going on
[1:16:13] that was that was all part of that
[1:16:15] Eternal thing so there was always a it
[1:16:17] was a very a busy thing uh always going
[1:16:20] back and forth between these two two
[1:16:23] Dimensions to two Realms or really
[1:16:26] Realms right is that we got here I
[1:16:30] should
[1:16:31] have I should had another one here so I
[1:16:34] think I clicked off but one more uh
[1:16:37] paragraph there and so God here and the
[1:16:39] angels and someday it will be just as
[1:16:42] much reality as television or anything
[1:16:44] else is because the spirit will bring us
[1:16:47] into that Immortal Life then we'll
[1:16:50] understand so then we are speaking from
[1:16:52] his word so is saying that we're going
[1:16:54] to be we're going to be seeing that as
[1:16:57] you know you know live it's not going to
[1:17:00] be a shadow to us anymore we're not
[1:17:02] going to be in the shadow we're not
[1:17:03] going to be in time it's going to move
[1:17:05] on that's what brother saying here in
[1:17:07] the end so it's it's pretty it's pretty
[1:17:10] uh there not real light stuff light
[1:17:13] stuff
[1:17:14] here then God here in at this the last
[1:17:19] one of the Harvest time then God after
[1:17:21] Adam had fell Tried by the word and fell
[1:17:25] but God continued in his creation to
[1:17:27] find a man who would live every word he
[1:17:30] was looking for someone who could redeem
[1:17:34] redeem the world right now look he tried
[1:17:37] to find a man that is lived the word for
[1:17:38] his age now you see God scattered his
[1:17:41] word out because he
[1:17:44] could so I I don't really have much time
[1:17:47] here I'm going to have to skip some of
[1:17:48] this
[1:17:50] but so he said just s he said Just
[1:17:53] Surrender and let the holy Holy Spirit
[1:17:55] come inside he will make you want to
[1:17:57] serve God and he will make you to to he
[1:18:01] will make it a joy to surrender to the
[1:18:04] things of the world now you'll be
[1:18:06] tempted In the Flesh you know your soul
[1:18:08] will be saved your soul will be
[1:18:09] converted but the flesh is never never
[1:18:12] converted we know that right the the
[1:18:14] flesh will always be the same way until
[1:18:17] if you have to die here before the
[1:18:19] Rapture or where up to the Rapture it'll
[1:18:22] still be fighting with that spirit right
[1:18:25] we all know that now now you you'll
[1:18:27] still be tempted in the flesh but now
[1:18:30] you'll actually have the ability to deny
[1:18:32] it I call that freedom when I have the
[1:18:35] ability it doesn't mean it'll always do
[1:18:37] it James said that there was no
[1:18:39] temptation taken you but such as is
[1:18:42] common to man so let's be Sons and
[1:18:45] Daughters of God and let's be rugged
[1:18:47] right in this a so with
[1:18:51] with you could see the change in the
[1:18:53] realm because the two Realms because you
[1:18:56] can you can look at the you can follow
[1:18:58] say example Abraham and you can look at
[1:19:02] what happened in Abraham's life and he
[1:19:04] made mistakes right and they all did and
[1:19:07] that's what brother Braham is saying
[1:19:08] there and there that you know he was
[1:19:10] looking for someone but they someone
[1:19:12] always made mistakes whether it was you
[1:19:14] know it was Abraham or it was Moses or
[1:19:19] you know it was Jacob or uh uh you know
[1:19:23] any any one any one of those
[1:19:25] job or anybody there was no one that
[1:19:27] didn't fall and make mistake or did did
[1:19:30] something that you know that was would
[1:19:33] certainly take him out of that
[1:19:34] Perfection kind of Realm right but then
[1:19:37] if you you know I'm just saying that if
[1:19:40] you just go over and look at Hebrews
[1:19:41] though so you're looking here in Old
[1:19:44] Testament where you're still in time but
[1:19:47] now you're over in the New Testament
[1:19:49] where we'll see we we move into another
[1:19:51] realm in the Old Testament at the day of
[1:19:54] Pentecost but here in Hebrews in chapter
[1:19:56] 11 we see all the saints there and
[1:19:58] they're talked about and it talks about
[1:20:00] Abraham and we know what Abraham did in
[1:20:02] the Old Testament you know and the you
[1:20:04] know the things that happened when he
[1:20:06] left you know the promised land and went
[1:20:08] down into those thing and Saul tried to
[1:20:10] sell his wife and all that kind of
[1:20:11] things but here in Hebrews 11 it says by
[1:20:15] faith Abraham when he was called to go
[1:20:17] out of out of a place which he should
[1:20:20] have received for in inheritance obeyed
[1:20:23] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:20:24] went by faith he sojourned in the land
[1:20:27] of promise as in a strange country
[1:20:29] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[1:20:31] Jacob the ears with him of the same
[1:20:34] promise for he looked for a city that
[1:20:36] which had which ha foundations whose
[1:20:38] bilder and maker is God through faith
[1:20:41] also Sarah herself received strength to
[1:20:43] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[1:20:46] child when when she was past age because
[1:20:49] she judged him faithful who had promised
[1:20:51] see it's like we said before God is God
[1:20:54] is looking at the heart right he's
[1:20:56] looking at the heart of Abraham and all
[1:20:58] of those Saints and he's not looking at
[1:21:00] the mistakes he doesn't judge them by
[1:21:01] that he doesn't even see it he all he
[1:21:03] sees is what that part that's that's in
[1:21:07] the in eternity that was there in the
[1:21:09] beginning Abraham is never going to be
[1:21:11] lost Sarah is never going to be lost
[1:21:13] right God is always just going to look
[1:21:15] at them at for what they they uh they
[1:21:18] did what their heart's desire was and
[1:21:20] that was to serve
[1:21:22] God so you see that right through in
[1:21:24] Hebrews
[1:21:27] 11 and there it was and I didn't click
[1:21:29] it maybe I'm just too long away from the
[1:21:35] clicker so last time if you remember you
[1:21:39] probably don't but we talked about the
[1:21:41] feast we talked about the feast and look
[1:21:44] remember remember wait just I'll give
[1:21:46] you a second yeah that's right that's
[1:21:48] right that's right you know so we looked
[1:21:50] at the feast and U and and they did they
[1:21:53] did this and it's a important thing it
[1:21:56] was important uh uh you know it just
[1:21:58] showed the plan of God so so vivid and
[1:22:01] the things that he was going to do and
[1:22:02] he needed to fulfill on this Earth and
[1:22:05] uh and Christ was the one to to come but
[1:22:09] uh he had to go through things so, 1600
[1:22:13] years uh under the
[1:22:15] law that they did this you know after
[1:22:18] Abraham's time 1600 times they did this
[1:22:20] so they just kept doing it was a yearly
[1:22:22] process and they kept going around doing
[1:22:24] you know the Feast of Passover and the
[1:22:26] unleavened bread and then first fruits
[1:22:28] Pentecost trumpets you know un the
[1:22:31] atonement and then Tabernacles so they
[1:22:33] did that every year oh finished another
[1:22:35] year finished another year but at some
[1:22:37] point someone comes and does this and
[1:22:40] who's able to fulfill this right so it
[1:22:43] doesn't have to be done again that the
[1:22:46] they'll come and it will be you know
[1:22:49] they'll you know they'll redeem back All
[1:22:52] Mankind through this process
[1:22:55] and they'll never have to do it again if
[1:22:56] one thing if a thing is fulfilled they
[1:22:58] don't have it to do they don't have to
[1:22:59] do it over Jesus didn't have to do it
[1:23:01] over again Jesus didn't have to go to
[1:23:03] Calvary and do it again it was done it
[1:23:05] was finished now you do something
[1:23:07] different so the Jews never got to that
[1:23:09] here right they went 1600 if they kept
[1:23:12] go
[1:23:13] 16001 16002 and they're probably still
[1:23:16] doing it today probably a thousand
[1:23:18] different ways right but they didn't
[1:23:20] have to do it and Peter and them knew
[1:23:22] that they were Jews they had done it the
[1:23:24] year before and they're saying whoa this
[1:23:27] is done we don't have to do this anymore
[1:23:29] so what what was in the New Testament
[1:23:31] and in the acts is what is what the Jews
[1:23:34] were supposed to do right when they saw
[1:23:37] this fulfilled by Christ when he comes
[1:23:39] but they missed it why they were blinded
[1:23:42] and we know
[1:23:44] that so that's that's uh what we went
[1:23:47] into last time just going through that
[1:23:50] and it this is is still going ahead we
[1:23:53] see those uh here there was 60 time and
[1:23:55] God comes and fulfills the Feast of the
[1:23:58] Lord the Leviticus 23 23 forever once
[1:24:01] and for all time Jews don't know that
[1:24:03] but we know that we didn't it didn't
[1:24:04] have to be done again Jesus didn't have
[1:24:06] to go to Calvary he didn't have to shed
[1:24:08] blood anymore he didn't have to do that
[1:24:09] anymore it was once for all right so in
[1:24:13] here after this though if we look at
[1:24:15] this in over uh you know the the
[1:24:18] thousands of years this were going on
[1:24:21] during this time in in the
[1:24:24] in with the feast in between in this
[1:24:26] area of seven months when there was
[1:24:29] there was uh uh quite before they came
[1:24:31] into the fall Feast here in the the
[1:24:33] first one being the trumpets so we see
[1:24:37] the church ages and then the first seal
[1:24:39] during those first two ages and then the
[1:24:41] second the third and fourth age and the
[1:24:44] second seal and the fifth and sixth and
[1:24:46] then in the third seal we've brother R
[1:24:49] covered that all we all know that very
[1:24:51] well and then leod deia and then that in
[1:24:53] the four seal going on to the fifth seal
[1:24:56] the sixth and the seventh and we're into
[1:24:58] the seventh and the seventh is a
[1:24:59] wonderful seal it's a wonderful
[1:25:02] wonderful everything is open we know it
[1:25:04] now we can see it there's things that
[1:25:05] are just manifesting and there's things
[1:25:08] that are being interpreted now you I
[1:25:10] mean you just never knew before right
[1:25:13] and I had one uh thing here and I had a
[1:25:15] couple of things that I going to have to
[1:25:16] skip it over but some of the things that
[1:25:18] just right through the whole history of
[1:25:20] the Bible and it was never known and now
[1:25:22] is known and is known to us in our
[1:25:24] generation right it's a it's a wonderful
[1:25:26] thing especially all these things in
[1:25:32] Revelation so here brother bandam in uh
[1:25:35] in the future home he does talk about
[1:25:37] loo and he he's at the end and and all
[1:25:40] the things that Through the Ages and
[1:25:42] like these things like uh you know the
[1:25:44] the word and and uh you know all the
[1:25:48] different U conditions that we have uh
[1:25:52] this was the age when they were going to
[1:25:53] be loosed and he used the word quite a
[1:25:55] bit so I was just running through just a
[1:25:57] couple of
[1:25:58] uh uh quotes here from the future home
[1:26:02] he says when a man is changed he isn't
[1:26:03] annihilated but he's changed he's a
[1:26:06] changed person he has been changed from
[1:26:09] what he was to what he is but he's not
[1:26:11] annihilated you know what I mean it
[1:26:13] might say new heavens and the new Earth
[1:26:15] but they're not new heavens and they're
[1:26:16] not new Earth they're just they're just
[1:26:18] uh changed you know that's what happens
[1:26:21] in in here so he's just kind of uh
[1:26:25] uh clarifying this so Jesus used the
[1:26:28] same word in Matthew 19:28 now he said
[1:26:31] to them you'll sit with me in my
[1:26:33] father's Kingdom regenerated you see
[1:26:36] change when you're you're changed he
[1:26:38] used the same word in Matthew 19:18 it
[1:26:41] says and Jesus said unto them verily I
[1:26:44] say unto you that ye which have followed
[1:26:46] me in regeneration when the son of man
[1:26:49] shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye
[1:26:52] also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging
[1:26:56] the 12 tribes of Israel and just shown
[1:26:59] quickly here my got go to this side and
[1:27:03] he used the same word when he said to
[1:27:06] the cult said loose the cult and let him
[1:27:08] go he said the same thing as the at the
[1:27:12] resurrection of Lazarus loose him change
[1:27:14] him he's been tied let him go so it's
[1:27:17] all the same word being used the Greek
[1:27:18] word what does it mean the Earth will be
[1:27:20] loosed from the grip of Satan in this
[1:27:22] age right in this last time amen it'll
[1:27:26] be loose it'll be loose it'll be loose
[1:27:28] from politics and all that corruption
[1:27:30] it'll be loose from denominational
[1:27:32] religious systems and to be used in the
[1:27:35] kingdom of God to be established here on
[1:27:37] the earth so it's a time of loosing
[1:27:39] that's what he's trying to put across
[1:27:41] and it was a and it was a long there
[1:27:43] talked about from the Lexicon
[1:27:45] regeneration it was New Birth
[1:27:47] reproduction renewal Recreation
[1:27:49] everything would begin with a
[1:27:51] regeneration hence renovation
[1:27:54] regeneration the production of a new
[1:27:56] life consecrated to God and I think you
[1:27:57] get the idea so that's what happens is
[1:28:00] is that all of this changes and we
[1:28:02] change right it's not a new no you know
[1:28:05] all this is destroyed then you know it's
[1:28:08] it's new it's it's all changed and
[1:28:10] that's the same for all of God's uh
[1:28:14] attributes and we're an attribute of God
[1:28:17] and the Earth is an attribute of God the
[1:28:19] the Earth was in God's thoughts right at
[1:28:22] the beginning we see that in in the
[1:28:23] fifth seal right it's a thing is going
[1:28:26] to be redeemed and changed over it's not
[1:28:28] going to be annihilated destroyed and a
[1:28:31] new one created it's going to be the
[1:28:33] same one regenerated so that's the
[1:28:37] point so here in the uh Feast of
[1:28:41] trumpets and it's a very familiar
[1:28:44] scripture and we see we're talking about
[1:28:46] loosing things being loosed and he says
[1:28:50] while this group down here has got 2,000
[1:28:52] years bound at the river you frates and
[1:28:55] has been bound for 2,000 years also the
[1:28:57] church has has bound the Holy Ghost
[1:29:00] that's true right because it was all
[1:29:02] mixed up you know the Holy Ghost was
[1:29:04] just uh very uh uh used it wasn't in its
[1:29:09] full strength at all you know because it
[1:29:12] it was it was you know it was covered
[1:29:15] with denominational thinking and change
[1:29:17] and you just can't do that through the
[1:29:19] word and expect to have the fullness of
[1:29:20] the Holy Ghost is not going to happen
[1:29:22] right so you might have
[1:29:24] some portion uh but you know you're not
[1:29:28] going to have the fullness so the church
[1:29:30] that's down to the ages also the church
[1:29:32] has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly
[1:29:34] 2,000 years under martydom back there
[1:29:37] and under the church ages it's been
[1:29:39] bound not at the river Euphrates but at
[1:29:42] the door of Creeds and dogmas that the
[1:29:45] Holy Spirit can't work in the church
[1:29:47] because of manmade systems but she is
[1:29:49] going to be liberated she is coming back
[1:29:52] and that's what the Bible says said and
[1:29:54] that's what what we saw on this day
[1:29:55] another thing we saw is the word was
[1:29:57] loosed right it came to its fullness
[1:30:00] it's the first time ever it came to its
[1:30:02] fullness Paul and them did experience
[1:30:04] some of it but it didn't go on because
[1:30:06] sin came into the church and all
[1:30:07] different things then came into the
[1:30:10] churches and it all got corrupted and we
[1:30:11] all know the story there but and then it
[1:30:14] just went into the ages and it just died
[1:30:16] right out into Catholic Church coming
[1:30:18] along in all these different
[1:30:19] denominations right into you know the
[1:30:22] the age of the ox where was almost a
[1:30:24] wipe out of the whole church right but
[1:30:27] this this is what
[1:30:30] happened so just uh further down there
[1:30:33] it said the Holy Spirit has been bound
[1:30:35] by these denominational Rivers for
[1:30:37] almost 2,000 years but is is to be
[1:30:40] loosed in the evening time by the
[1:30:41] evening time message the Holy Spirit
[1:30:44] back in the church again Christ himself
[1:30:46] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[1:30:49] time he said it he promised it and it's
[1:30:51] happening right so the word was loosed
[1:30:53] with the Seven Seals being open it was
[1:30:55] loose fully there was no bind to it at
[1:30:58] all it was the fullness of and then it's
[1:31:00] the fullness of the Holy Ghost to to the
[1:31:02] people so we you know you you see it uh
[1:31:07] you so you see it Through the Ages right
[1:31:10] true there's always when God is moving
[1:31:12] and we see these different periods and
[1:31:13] we just happen to be in a very important
[1:31:15] one and when you see it saying Moses and
[1:31:18] Moses had this big you know these all
[1:31:21] these uh signs and wonders and
[1:31:23] everything and you know it it just
[1:31:25] happens with every one of these ages it
[1:31:28] happens and then with Moses they got
[1:31:31] into the desert and then it got then all
[1:31:33] the you know it got rough right you know
[1:31:36] it gets rough and you see it with with a
[1:31:39] uh you know uh you know when they first
[1:31:43] see you know some Israelites killed and
[1:31:45] and things like that so you know it it
[1:31:48] gets it gets harder it's not like the
[1:31:50] signs and wonders days that they had
[1:31:52] when in the desert
[1:31:54] in Egypt that they had in the desert and
[1:31:56] then Joshua comes along and they have
[1:31:59] you know the city and going around the
[1:32:00] city and that collapses and this big
[1:32:02] thing you know it's obvious and they see
[1:32:04] God happening but after that they didn't
[1:32:06] have anything like that it didn't happen
[1:32:08] right and that goes right on through the
[1:32:09] ages like in jesus' time he has all
[1:32:12] these Miracles and everything but then
[1:32:13] it gets get down to the grudge right you
[1:32:15] get down into the uh you know you're
[1:32:18] persecuted and you're hated and D it's
[1:32:21] gone it's no more and the same with the
[1:32:24] the book of Acts uh you know with Peter
[1:32:27] and and those people they saw great
[1:32:28] Miracles but it wasn't long before it
[1:32:30] happened and in our age we see it in all
[1:32:32] the church ages and in Pentecostal ages
[1:32:35] see the big Pentecostal uh CH things
[1:32:38] that were going on but then it quickly
[1:32:40] came into denomination came into Grudge
[1:32:42] you know they just just you know having
[1:32:45] trouble with everything on every side
[1:32:47] you know and then it's a time to for
[1:32:49] maturity then right that's when the
[1:32:50] tests come and all those things but
[1:32:51] there's always this this this display
[1:32:54] this manifestation of God coming on the
[1:32:56] scene to do something at the at the
[1:32:58] beginning of that time that period that
[1:33:00] interval where God was going to move on
[1:33:02] the scene and we saw it in brother
[1:33:03] bram's day for sure you saw all of in
[1:33:05] the great healing meetings that he had
[1:33:08] and it went on and on and on and then it
[1:33:10] stopped right he went into second pole
[1:33:13] first poll and second pole and third
[1:33:14] pole so it changed and that's that's
[1:33:17] right up through but then our age we saw
[1:33:20] it wasn't that thing you didn't see
[1:33:21] those signs and wonders and things that
[1:33:23] was gone that that happened you're not
[1:33:25] going to see that again right you might
[1:33:27] see a small manifestation of it that he
[1:33:28] talks about but really what you saw back
[1:33:30] in B that's over the next one that's
[1:33:32] going to see it is Israel right Israel's
[1:33:34] going to see it the 144,000 they'll see
[1:33:36] a big spectacular demonstration for a
[1:33:39] little while before it all starts to
[1:33:41] shut down so that's that's a common
[1:33:44] between there right we all know we all
[1:33:46] see that from the pattern of the word
[1:33:50] right and just get this to turn
[1:33:54] so here in the future
[1:33:57] home so we see here in rev and I
[1:33:59] mentioned it here and in three and it
[1:34:02] says and this is when it's all finished
[1:34:05] right so we've seen the Earth cleared
[1:34:07] it's regenerated and God God himself and
[1:34:10] the loop is gone on the bottom is gone
[1:34:13] that's gone back up and it's only now
[1:34:15] eternity it's only the circle in
[1:34:17] Revelation 21 that's what we see and I
[1:34:20] heard a great voice of Heaven saying
[1:34:21] behold the Tabernacle of God is with man
[1:34:23] man with men and he will dwell with them
[1:34:26] and they shall be his people and God
[1:34:28] himself this is not God in any kind of
[1:34:31] covering he doesn't have any other other
[1:34:34] he's not coming down as a a a soldier or
[1:34:38] as in Joshua days you know it's never
[1:34:41] like that anymore he comes down God
[1:34:43] himself shall be with them and be their
[1:34:46] God but he he he can only he can't come
[1:34:49] down to the to the time realm he can't
[1:34:52] come down like that God himself he can
[1:34:54] only stay up there where there's no sin
[1:34:57] but he can you know like mzc he can take
[1:35:01] on a body and he can be inside there in
[1:35:04] his in Holiness and he spoke this body
[1:35:07] into existence and it and he can go into
[1:35:11] uh into the time realm and he does many
[1:35:14] many many times through this and we've
[1:35:16] learned this in in this
[1:35:21] age so here
[1:35:24] in future home he says now notice this
[1:35:27] little germs all darkness and things so
[1:35:29] this at the stage now is like how is God
[1:35:32] going to do this how is he going to
[1:35:34] how's he going to get all this back back
[1:35:37] into uh uh the right place again what is
[1:35:40] the plan going to be here now and here's
[1:35:43] the condition of it and notice thistles
[1:35:46] germs all sickness and things will be
[1:35:48] completely taken away all this its
[1:35:50] existence that in the earth now man-made
[1:35:53] systems politics sin all kinds of evil
[1:35:55] spirits that the world is contaminated
[1:35:57] with and all the heavens above us in
[1:36:00] here is contaminated with evil spirit we
[1:36:02] know all that right all all this exists
[1:36:06] in the heavens or atmospheres and the
[1:36:08] Earth which is now the Earth holds those
[1:36:10] things but it wasn't made for that
[1:36:12] purpose sin caused it to be like that
[1:36:14] see it was made by God the Creator and
[1:36:17] all oh I'm
[1:36:19] sorry and all of our bodies that we live
[1:36:22] in now was put on the earth when God
[1:36:25] created it because you're out of the
[1:36:27] Dust of the earth it was all laid out
[1:36:30] here it was all there at the beginning
[1:36:32] when God you know created the the world
[1:36:35] it was in the earth and it was all laid
[1:36:38] out there when God himself created you
[1:36:40] were in his thinking and in him the
[1:36:42] great Eternal was the thought which is
[1:36:44] his attribute and that's
[1:36:46] you and now sin caused all this to
[1:36:50] happen and God through this age is
[1:36:51] gathering up his material
[1:36:54] Satan is still here that's the reason
[1:36:56] all these things happen he is still here
[1:36:59] and all of his evil forces are still
[1:37:00] here notice it's you know God of this
[1:37:03] evil age noce that's why the earth now
[1:37:06] is so filthy that's why the scum and
[1:37:09] ridiculous things that go on Bloodshed
[1:37:11] War politics sin adultery all kinds of
[1:37:13] filthiness goes on is because Satan is
[1:37:16] the ruler of this Earth and his
[1:37:17] atmosphere so he is the God of this evil
[1:37:20] of this evil age in in this realm in
[1:37:24] that in that time realm right and now
[1:37:27] it's gone to its apex he's come in he's
[1:37:29] taken over every layer of it you know no
[1:37:32] matter what government every layer
[1:37:33] everything all the churches it's all
[1:37:35] gone we know what we're in the days of
[1:37:37] lot we can see Sodom Gomorrah and
[1:37:39] everything all the thinking and
[1:37:40] everything and guess what it's going to
[1:37:42] get worse before it ends
[1:37:45] right so that's the situation that
[1:37:47] you're in and we're in that Earth that
[1:37:49] our seed he said there that we were in
[1:37:51] the earth so we went out of eternity and
[1:37:54] we're in that
[1:37:55] Earth so just just uh just here is just
[1:37:58] a couple of slides here on begotten of
[1:38:00] the father because it says in John
[1:38:03] 1:14 he says and the Word was made flesh
[1:38:07] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:38:09] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[1:38:11] the father full of grace and truth and
[1:38:13] there was only one begotten of the god
[1:38:15] of the father and that was Jesus right
[1:38:18] so the original sin refers to the
[1:38:20] condition of sinfulness I'll let you see
[1:38:22] it that all humans Shear which is
[1:38:24] inherited from Adam and Eve due to the
[1:38:26] fall and proving the loss of original
[1:38:29] righteousness the Bible basis for the
[1:38:31] belief is found in Genesis 3 and in in
[1:38:34] in texts such as Psalms
[1:38:39] 515 I was brought forth in iniquity and
[1:38:42] in sin did my mother conceive me and
[1:38:46] also in
[1:38:47] Romans Romans 5 one verse there
[1:38:51] therefore just as Sin entered the world
[1:38:53] through one man and death through sin
[1:38:55] and in this way death came to all people
[1:38:57] because all have sinned no one can no
[1:39:01] you know that's why you know it just
[1:39:02] continued on with the Jews and they kept
[1:39:04] doing the sacrifice because it couldn't
[1:39:07] be fulfilled right it was only they had
[1:39:09] a a solution just for one year where
[1:39:11] they could be covered for that sin but
[1:39:13] the sin could never be removed they
[1:39:15] needed one person to come who is
[1:39:18] begotten of the father right and there I
[1:39:21] had some notes up
[1:39:31] so just quickly I am going quickly here
[1:39:34] so just to show the process so God as we
[1:39:37] know he put a blood cell and he spoke it
[1:39:40] into the existence of a woman which is
[1:39:42] Mary right so it had to that that seed
[1:39:45] had to come through a woman in order to
[1:39:47] be a part of mankind so it was virgin
[1:39:50] born the Mary really had nothing to do
[1:39:53] with only she was just the the uh the
[1:39:56] body that they used and Jesus was born
[1:40:00] and his father was God he was the only
[1:40:02] one who was ever like that right that
[1:40:05] all came through sex or whatever Adam
[1:40:07] wasn't born he was just spoken into
[1:40:09] existence he Adam wasn't part of that
[1:40:11] mankind he had to come through a woman
[1:40:13] right to be part of that mankind so then
[1:40:16] so Jesus became a Kinsman he was a
[1:40:18] relative by birth he was a man he was
[1:40:22] 100% man man and he was 100%
[1:40:26] God and then so he was the only one
[1:40:29] eligible to be the kinsman redeemer
[1:40:33] someone who could redeem what was lost
[1:40:35] so he was the only one eligible God had
[1:40:37] one son that was born through a woman
[1:40:41] which was Jesus and he was the begotten
[1:40:44] of the father so just so you know what
[1:40:46] that uh that means
[1:40:48] there so in our case man there's a seed
[1:40:52] and we know how it is seed is uh used
[1:40:56] and then it's in a woman and then
[1:40:57] there's a child born but can that child
[1:40:59] be the kinsman redeemer he can't it was
[1:41:02] born in sin right under the original sin
[1:41:05] so he can't so could could someone like
[1:41:08] MDC he was not begotten of the father
[1:41:11] that was Jesus Christ right he spoke a
[1:41:14] body and stepped into it it wasn't a
[1:41:16] human body so it can't be a Kinsman to
[1:41:19] mankind it can't it can't uh uh remove
[1:41:23] that
[1:41:24] sin so he was not born through a woman
[1:41:27] nothing human about
[1:41:29] him he came through the spoken word he
[1:41:31] can't be a red redeems and he can't be
[1:41:34] the Lamb of God so there was only one
[1:41:36] that could be and all those that were
[1:41:38] there you saw in the Bible they might
[1:41:40] have Miracles and do wonderful things
[1:41:41] but they couldn't do this it was the
[1:41:43] only to be the begotten of the father
[1:41:45] trying to get through this
[1:41:48] but it's going to be tough so our symbol
[1:41:51] again so here we are we're in time our
[1:41:54] soul body Earth is all attributes of God
[1:41:57] that was in in the earth and it's all it
[1:42:01] it's all there it's all in
[1:42:06] time so here in the Old Testament and we
[1:42:09] went through the feast there and in in
[1:42:12] in all that uh God was in eternity and
[1:42:16] everyone that was born was in time
[1:42:19] there's no one in eternity that there's
[1:42:21] no way they can get there without a
[1:42:22] Kinsman Redeemer they can't get back so
[1:42:25] God has had to come up with a way to get
[1:42:27] them back into this realm again right
[1:42:31] and once he got all of it back he was
[1:42:33] going to just eliminate time which he
[1:42:35] does right before new heavens and new
[1:42:37] earth right after a great fire upon the
[1:42:40] Earth where he cleanse
[1:42:42] it so
[1:42:45] here so here when we get he he did die
[1:42:48] at Calvary he was the one that could the
[1:42:51] only begotten of the father and then
[1:42:53] there was then there was uh seven
[1:42:56] sabbaths 49 days after that after the
[1:43:01] resurrection and then there was
[1:43:02] Pentecost which is the fifth day and in
[1:43:05] the feast that we did on this day in the
[1:43:08] feast they had a holy convocation and
[1:43:10] they would have to they would have to go
[1:43:12] and burn a sacrifice it had to be a
[1:43:15] burnt sacrifice that's what they would
[1:43:17] have and that's what they would eat in
[1:43:19] that day but it was the fifth day it was
[1:43:22] the eighth day
[1:43:23] it was you know it was it was 49 and 50
[1:43:26] was the eth and there was a holy
[1:43:29] convocation or a holy fire to do what it
[1:43:33] want and it was an eighth day and the
[1:43:37] soul is in the Eternal realm
[1:43:40] forever so what happened there when when
[1:43:43] Jesus when Jesus died
[1:43:46] there he fulfilled he fulfilled those
[1:43:49] feasts so he fulfilled Pentecost
[1:43:53] and he wait they did they went they went
[1:43:56] through those seven and then he went to
[1:43:58] the eight he went to the eighth but
[1:44:00] there is no e brother brandham explains
[1:44:03] there's no e because it starts back at
[1:44:05] the first again and just goes around so
[1:44:08] brother Bram calls that Eternal he it
[1:44:10] goes to the Eternal so that's an eternal
[1:44:12] day that that first day of Pentecost
[1:44:15] when when Peter spoke that was eternal
[1:44:18] Eternal Word it was an eternal day and
[1:44:21] it was an eternal Holy
[1:44:25] Fire that was the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:27] Spirit which is the fire that you need
[1:44:30] the Holy Fire to cleanse you out so that
[1:44:34] God himself the Eternal can dwell in you
[1:44:38] that's the only way you can do it you
[1:44:40] have to have the fire you can't shake
[1:44:43] hands with a preacher and say okay
[1:44:45] you're born again you have to have the
[1:44:48] fire to burn you out and when that when
[1:44:50] you when that fire burns you out you're
[1:44:52] changed
[1:44:53] you changed forever you'll never be the
[1:44:56] same you can't go on and do the same
[1:44:58] things that you did because you lose
[1:45:00] those desires because it's all burnt out
[1:45:02] now it takes you know it's it's a bit of
[1:45:04] a process you know the way it is right
[1:45:06] but it but it's a process that's
[1:45:08] happening that God is doing and is not
[1:45:10] going to turn
[1:45:11] back I got to go fast so the holy
[1:45:15] convocation that's this is the
[1:45:17] definition here that's the in the uh uh
[1:45:20] in Leviticus and he said that's the
[1:45:22] Eighth Day in or
[1:45:23] that's an eternal day because it's gone
[1:45:26] in as an ace it's gone around there's no
[1:45:28] more there's no more 1 to S and Jews
[1:45:32] were required to sacrifice Animals by
[1:45:34] far for that holy day that's what they
[1:45:37] had to
[1:45:38] do so in in the case when now it's that
[1:45:41] was when it when it wasn't being
[1:45:44] fulfilled they just did that every year
[1:45:46] that's what they had to do in a physical
[1:45:48] sense but now with Jesus coming and
[1:45:50] doing it it's now Eternal it's no more
[1:45:53] you don't have to do this anymore this
[1:45:54] is the Once Jesus only had to die once
[1:45:57] the Holy Spirit comes down it's down
[1:45:59] Peter o Peter declared that it was open
[1:46:02] for anyone who could receive and of
[1:46:04] course we knew who was going to receive
[1:46:05] which was the
[1:46:07] redeemed so
[1:46:09] here that there's three elements that
[1:46:11] have to be brought to their eth day or
[1:46:13] back to the first day the original day
[1:46:15] the Eternal day and the first one is
[1:46:17] your soul it has to be your soul Born
[1:46:20] Again by the spirit of God and you're
[1:46:21] sitting together in heaven places in
[1:46:23] Christ Jesus what you want to do is get
[1:46:25] back to the to Eternity you want to get
[1:46:28] back to the Eternal where you were in
[1:46:29] the beginning right but you can't
[1:46:32] because you're stuck in time because you
[1:46:34] you you you're born in sin you can't do
[1:46:38] it it's impossible so the first thing
[1:46:40] you have to do is you have to be born by
[1:46:42] the spirit of God that's the first thing
[1:46:44] to get you back into the
[1:46:48] Eternal the second thing it is the Earth
[1:46:51] is still in its seven day time so it has
[1:46:54] to have a holy fire so the earth the
[1:46:57] earth has to get back also to the
[1:46:59] Eternal to it's where God can dwell and
[1:47:01] all his people can dwell and and it it
[1:47:04] was in in it was in the in God in the
[1:47:07] beginning it it's this Earth is eternal
[1:47:10] it never had a beginning and it'll never
[1:47:12] have an end so now it's got to be but it
[1:47:15] also has to be purified because it has
[1:47:17] all this sin on it now that I just read
[1:47:20] it's at every level and we know that
[1:47:22] brother preaches the birth pains and
[1:47:25] it's in birth and it's about to give
[1:47:27] birth and this is what is about to
[1:47:28] happen is the it's going to get the Holy
[1:47:30] Fire it's going to burn off everything
[1:47:35] right so the third thing is it has to
[1:47:38] come in the eth day was the word of God
[1:47:40] it had to go beyond man-made manage
[1:47:43] thinking and the Book of redemption had
[1:47:44] to be opened the mystery of redemption
[1:47:46] that the world has no access to so the
[1:47:49] the general belief doesn't have any
[1:47:51] access that God keeps that very reserved
[1:47:54] for his redeemed people right and we
[1:47:56] know that at the seventh seal all of
[1:47:59] that was opened up we can see it it's
[1:48:01] all opened up it's the full Holy Ghost
[1:48:03] it's the full word revealed it's all
[1:48:04] loosed right it's all set to go God has
[1:48:08] got it to where he
[1:48:11] wants I got something here it is the end
[1:48:14] of seven sabbaths with the baptism of
[1:48:15] the Holy Ghost and now your soul is in
[1:48:18] an eternal day right and you know that
[1:48:21] right cuz you can you can sense things
[1:48:24] right when you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:48:25] sense God is in the room you can sense
[1:48:28] that he's not in the room he you can
[1:48:30] sense things from that internal side
[1:48:32] right you're not fully over there
[1:48:34] because the body is not redeemed but
[1:48:35] that Soul now is part of that Eternal
[1:48:38] right so he can feel the spirit in the
[1:48:40] room you can feel it right so it's
[1:48:42] happening
[1:48:45] right so with the
[1:48:50] soul so we see the the same as the top
[1:48:53] and it goes on for another 2,000 2,000
[1:48:56] years there so here I notice after in
[1:49:00] the future home and notice after 50 days
[1:49:02] or seven sabbaths from there again there
[1:49:05] come another holy convocation what
[1:49:07] happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day
[1:49:09] of Pentecost The Eighth Day brother
[1:49:11] Braham says was seven
[1:49:15] uh I going to what happened the Holy
[1:49:18] Ghost fell on day of Pentecost the 8th
[1:49:20] day was seven sabbaths later exactly
[1:49:23] after his resurrection see so it' be
[1:49:25] seven times that again bring it right
[1:49:27] back around to the first day of the week
[1:49:29] again exactly so he's he's saying you're
[1:49:31] going into
[1:49:33] eternity so he say there there is your
[1:49:35] holy convocation not have anything to do
[1:49:38] with the literal things it's beyond that
[1:49:41] it's into the kingdom of God with
[1:49:43] eternal life with the predestinated that
[1:49:46] never did start it never started on any
[1:49:49] day you wasn't saved on any day me and
[1:49:53] Joseph were talking about this is how I
[1:49:55] got stared on this he wasn't saved on
[1:49:57] any day you were always saved amen Jesus
[1:50:02] just came to redeem that but you were
[1:50:04] saved from the beginning because you had
[1:50:06] eternal life to begin with Once once
[1:50:09] once you have eternal life once you're
[1:50:10] in God if you're in God's mind as an
[1:50:13] attribute you always were it you were
[1:50:15] always there you have eternal life so
[1:50:17] you can go anywhere you want but God is
[1:50:19] going to come and redeem you back to
[1:50:21] where you were in the beginning
[1:50:23] so it's going to happen you can't help
[1:50:24] it so it's not like you think you go to
[1:50:26] the Altar and you you do that all
[1:50:28] yourself but you don't right the redeem
[1:50:30] don't do don't do that God is drawing
[1:50:33] you right to that he's given you all of
[1:50:35] that right you think it started there it
[1:50:37] didn't start there it started right back
[1:50:39] in the beginning he just letting you
[1:50:41] know now you know that's what it want
[1:50:43] right but the church got their WR way of
[1:50:45] doing it the uh denomination that's what
[1:50:48] we kind of follow right so now now it's
[1:50:52] it's your you're getting now where the
[1:50:53] soul even though it's in the body it's
[1:50:57] it's it's in that Eternal realm it goes
[1:50:59] into that Eternal realm that's what I
[1:51:01] mean this uh this message it it it was a
[1:51:04] whole lot of layers there I didn't
[1:51:05] realize because now that that Soul
[1:51:08] exists there with God he's brought it
[1:51:10] back now into the into the realm so you
[1:51:13] really are separated right so he says
[1:51:17] here I just get a couple of scriptures
[1:51:19] here on it heavens and earth have met
[1:51:22] God man is
[1:51:24] reconciled oh sorry a restored Eden has
[1:51:28] begun see all the curse is gone just
[1:51:31] like all the curses of sin is gone when
[1:51:33] the Holy Ghost accepts you see the Holy
[1:51:35] Ghost accepts you and you don't accept
[1:51:38] it it accepts you see because it's God's
[1:51:40] attribute see if it's the holy ghost
[1:51:43] means holy spirit and it's the see but
[1:51:46] Brown never he never preached his out
[1:51:48] around because he was preaching in
[1:51:49] denominational churches he didn't have
[1:51:51] any churches he had was Jeffersonville
[1:51:54] and then after he had Tucan Tabernacle
[1:51:57] and maybe sometimes down the streetport
[1:51:59] and when he died that's all he had he
[1:52:01] didn't have any his own churches not
[1:52:03] like now you can go around and preach
[1:52:04] this anywhere right he used to have
[1:52:06] gymnasiums and that he go and preach to
[1:52:07] Believers and stuff but he did he you
[1:52:10] don't see this on the tapes because he
[1:52:11] was in denominational Church they
[1:52:13] wouldn't have it they couldn't take this
[1:52:15] right it's only redeem can do
[1:52:19] this so see if it's the holy ghost means
[1:52:22] holy God's spirit and it's the attribute
[1:52:25] the thought of God has accepted you
[1:52:26] because that you were ordained for that
[1:52:29] purpose see yet you was born in sin you
[1:52:31] were born in sin truly original sin
[1:52:33] through your parents right but God had
[1:52:36] that attribute and here you expressed
[1:52:37] yourself here on Earth and he looks down
[1:52:40] and gets you see you're back here here
[1:52:43] is where you belong see it's talking
[1:52:46] about eternity he's he's got that thing
[1:52:48] up right and see sin has lost its power
[1:52:51] that's right the desire for sin has gone
[1:52:53] from your heart when the Holy Spirit
[1:52:55] comes in you are a restored person but
[1:52:57] you get the lust on the Flesh and all of
[1:52:59] that the flesh is still working away
[1:53:01] doing all that stuff but this that the
[1:53:04] soul is not if it's sealed in by God
[1:53:06] it's it's finished
[1:53:08] right
[1:53:13] so so here again it just talking about
[1:53:15] the soul so on the 50th
[1:53:19] day 50th day the Holy Ghost fell on the
[1:53:21] day of pent
[1:53:23] C so so this is not this is not again
[1:53:26] it's the feast day and it's just doing a
[1:53:28] ritual here it's not anymore this is
[1:53:29] this is Christ now coming on the scene
[1:53:31] God coming on the scene and he's
[1:53:33] fulfilling this right and then and B is
[1:53:35] telling us now here's what happened when
[1:53:36] that was fulfilled and you don't have to
[1:53:38] do it anymore and we didn't do it
[1:53:40] anymore right so we don't do this
[1:53:42] anymore we don't have a Passover but we
[1:53:44] do have you know like uh you know the
[1:53:47] ordin an ordinance where we do remember
[1:53:50] it but you don't have to do it anymore
[1:53:51] you know it's done you would just do a
[1:53:53] remembrance of it like uh when you do
[1:53:55] communion and foot washing and things
[1:53:57] like that right and that's what the Jews
[1:53:59] should have done but they didn't they
[1:54:00] kept down with it they're still doing it
[1:54:03] so 50th it's an8 day it's an eternal day
[1:54:06] and it's the end of the sabbaths and
[1:54:08] your soul is in an eternal day Born
[1:54:10] Again of the spirit of
[1:54:13] God and the Soul goes there ha sir that
[1:54:18] was easy the soul is there it's redeemed
[1:54:22] godes have to do anything else so you're
[1:54:23] really in two Realms right do you ever
[1:54:26] feel like in two Realms I felt in two
[1:54:28] Realms right you know and
[1:54:33] uh if I was a
[1:54:35] preacher you could really preach that it
[1:54:39] needs a
[1:54:41] preacher because that's a a good thing
[1:54:43] because you feel it you you got a sense
[1:54:45] for it right you know the world's not
[1:54:47] going to believe this it's not you know
[1:54:49] it's not that's not how it works but
[1:54:50] that's how God is doing it getting it
[1:54:51] all back and he's got a lot of souls
[1:54:53] over there now right because you know
[1:54:55] they're over there because they're
[1:54:56] coming down when under the Rapture right
[1:54:59] they're going to they're going to meet
[1:55:01] up with their body that's going to be
[1:55:02] resurrected and their souls their
[1:55:04] theophanes and they're over there now
[1:55:06] right and now you're there
[1:55:10] too so Peter on that Eighth Day acts 238
[1:55:15] the word can't be
[1:55:17] altered and this is an eternal day so if
[1:55:20] if you were so B talks about you know
[1:55:24] you got to read between the lines
[1:55:25] because there's things that you you
[1:55:27] don't understand you need a revelation
[1:55:29] and an easy one which is not easy for
[1:55:31] people but it says baptism right so you
[1:55:34] look at you look at the gospels and
[1:55:36] Jesus says you have to be baptized in
[1:55:37] the father Son and Holy Ghost and then
[1:55:39] over in Peter comes along shortly after
[1:55:42] and he says you have to be baptized in
[1:55:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:55:45] that's confusion most of the people are
[1:55:47] born father Son and Holy Ghost but he
[1:55:50] was he's he's saying this on an eternal
[1:55:53] day this is after all it's been
[1:55:56] fulfilled he he's not going to mess this
[1:55:58] up you know Jesus was over in time and
[1:56:02] he didn't say anything wrong but he
[1:56:04] never said a name he never said he just
[1:56:06] said in the name of the name of he never
[1:56:08] said the name so we understand that
[1:56:10] because we have to read between the
[1:56:12] lines as brother Brown says right but
[1:56:14] pet Peter said the right thing and that
[1:56:17] that will never
[1:56:19] change that that is eternal because it's
[1:56:21] I'm that 50th starting that Eternal
[1:56:24] we're still in the Eternal because once
[1:56:26] you hit that Eighth Day read through the
[1:56:28] Bible once you hit that Eighth Day
[1:56:30] you're in the Eternal it's over and he's
[1:56:32] saying here we we're in the eighth day
[1:56:35] so we're into the
[1:56:38] Eternal it's it's now spiritual it has
[1:56:41] nothing to do with time anymore nothing
[1:56:44] you know whatever you do in time it
[1:56:45] doesn't matter and what matters it's
[1:56:47] over in heaven and and that's what
[1:56:49] matter and it's not in time like I say
[1:56:51] yes it's it doesn't matter it there's no
[1:56:53] yesterday that soul is over there and
[1:56:55] God looks at that Soul right you still
[1:56:57] had to repent over here and do all of
[1:56:59] that right but you know it's not going
[1:57:01] to be hell against you
[1:57:06] right so it's part of the Holy
[1:57:08] convocation that was laid out the Holy
[1:57:11] Fire the baptism of the Holy Spirit on
[1:57:14] the soul you must have Holy Fire not a
[1:57:18] handshake it has to annihilate every
[1:57:21] Trace Satan has
[1:57:31] has it has it it's not man-made religion
[1:57:34] at that stage right it's not that's all
[1:57:37] caught up there they'll still do that it
[1:57:39] doesn't matter but they haven't gone
[1:57:41] into the Eternal they're still in time
[1:57:43] they're still following uh you know
[1:57:45] their own rituals their own beliefs that
[1:57:47] they don't have the full word so it's
[1:57:49] never going to be a full Eternal right
[1:57:51] and an eternal
[1:57:53] experience so I got to go really fast
[1:57:56] here now oh
[1:57:59] sh I should end
[1:58:02] sorry I told you I'm out of uh practice
[1:58:07] here I really can't I'll finish Soul
[1:58:10] here and then we'll we'll just finish
[1:58:13] here sorry about
[1:58:15] that I thought I had didn't have enough
[1:58:18] you know
[1:58:22] so what happened oh here I'll give you
[1:58:24] the scripture what happened Christ came
[1:58:27] and called the church to repentance
[1:58:29] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:58:31] the remission Sanctified the church and
[1:58:33] with the fire of God came down and burn
[1:58:35] out all the filth and came and dwelt and
[1:58:38] dwelt in the human heart that's what
[1:58:40] Christ did so Christ could come down he
[1:58:43] could come down into that time realm he
[1:58:46] could he walked around here in that time
[1:58:48] realm he could because he was he was U
[1:58:51] uh begotten of God like the man was like
[1:58:55] the man was when he still had hatred
[1:58:57] malice and strife in him when the fire
[1:59:00] baptism come it cleaned it off no more
[1:59:03] jealousy no more of nothing it just
[1:59:06] absolutely is a dwelling place for God
[1:59:08] and remember that's his delegation
[1:59:10] that's going to meet him
[1:59:14] Yonder I was going to look here because
[1:59:16] um
[1:59:23] I can't do these 20 more
[1:59:28] pages so one more
[1:59:30] here so here just showing showing where
[1:59:33] uh it's referenced in the scriptures and
[1:59:36] even when we were dead in sins in
[1:59:38] Ephesians 25 and 6 has quickened us
[1:59:40] together with Christ by by grace are you
[1:59:42] saved and has raised us up together and
[1:59:44] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:59:47] this is the eternity in Christ Jesus so
[1:59:49] that's where we are the real us right
[1:59:52] the one in the one in the time is a
[1:59:55] shadow it's not the real one we're just
[1:59:57] a shadow of that real one but the real
[1:59:59] one now is been redeemed and is up in
[2:00:01] eternity and we can have Fellowship it
[2:00:04] says here and has raised us up together
[2:00:06] and made us to sit together in Heavenly
[2:00:08] places in Christ Jesus so in Christ
[2:00:10] Jesus that's where we
[2:00:13] are who has blessed us with all
[2:00:15] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[2:00:17] in Christ Jesus according as he has
[2:00:19] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[2:00:21] of the world so that that attribute of
[2:00:24] us has been restored we will never if
[2:00:27] that if if you are in Christ in that
[2:00:31] Eternal realm you will never and you are
[2:00:34] Eternal you will never die you know
[2:00:38] spiritually you will live eternally
[2:00:41] right in a new heavens and a new Earth
[2:00:44] and it doesn't happen when you're when
[2:00:46] you're dead and go up it happens now
[2:00:49] right the process
[2:00:52] one more quote
[2:00:53] here yes sir out of out of the church
[2:00:56] age book ler hand the church is no
[2:00:59] longer the mount piece of God it is its
[2:01:01] own mouthpiece so God is turning on her
[2:01:04] that's he's talking about the church so
[2:01:06] there no more the church is the briad
[2:01:08] right he will confound her through the
[2:01:10] prophet and the bride for the voice of
[2:01:12] God will be in her yes it is for it says
[2:01:15] in Revelation 227 the spirit and the
