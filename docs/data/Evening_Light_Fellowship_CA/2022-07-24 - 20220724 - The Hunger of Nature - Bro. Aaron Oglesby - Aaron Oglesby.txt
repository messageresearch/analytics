or hear from any other man but lord let us hear from you today you open our ears and and not only we ask that he would anoint my words but that he would anoint the ears and the hearts of the listener so that the word would fall on good ground because that's that's our desire this morning and thank you very much musicians we won't be singing anymore i so enjoyed the worship there in the back office as you entered in and and brought down the as the presence of the lord began to move and before we get started and enter into the word this morning there are a few things i i would like to say and uh what an honor it is to have the opportunity to stand in this this pulpit in in newfoundland canada it's actually my first time to be out of the country so it's been an incredible trip for me um it's an honor to stand in a place like this where a man like brother gerald has has preached for 42 years is what i was told and and you know there there's something there's something to that when a man stands and is a stalwart and year after year after year and we appreciate you brother and your testimonial and i don't take it lightly when a man allows you to step behind his pulpit and speak to his people it is a it's an honor and it's something that we take very very seriously and brother tim asked me to greet you and to greet the church here and to send his greetings and god bless you and timothy and brother joe as well also send their greetings um we're here with some of our dearest friends david and elena and jonathan and jessica and it's been almost i don't know not the sounds silly but it's almost been magical in this place it's incredible it's been stunning it's been amazing i want to give a special thanks while i'm here to brother john and sister blanca for facilitating and helping this be possible and to brother bob and sister brenda coffey for the food and things that they they've sent uh brother mark sister maureen for the food that they've given and and uh brother joe who is not here for allowing us to use his vehicle while always gone and um and brother chad collins and his family for opening up their home and and that's been an incredible blessing and if i forgot somebody just thank you all for being here and we we've been blessed i'm so grateful to be here with friends so thankful that i was able to do this trip with my wife and it has been just a wonderful time for us and i look forward to a wonderful time in the presence of the lord today if you have your bibles with you and you'd like to stand with me we're going to open to the book of proverbs uh 24th chapter proverbs 24 and verse 30. amen isn't god good to us he is so wonderful to us i love what he said well i go about counting your blessings truly we should do that more often proverbs 24 and 30 says i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thou poverty come as one that travaileth and thy want as an armed man also i want to look at galatians 5. if you'll turn with me there to galatians 5 and 22 and it says in verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit amen let's pray together our gracious heavenly father lord how we love you how we appreciate you lord your goodness and mercy lord that has been with us all the days of our lives lord we just want to give you praise this morning lord lord we just ask lord that as we begin to minister lord that you would just take take my body lord move it out of the way take my flesh and move it out of the way and allow your spirit to speak lord and just allow the word lord to fall lord on good ground as we said lord that you'll take control lord from this moment lord all the way through the end we already recognize your presence in our midst your word declares it and we thank you for that and we ask now lord that you'll just take control and speak to your people father in jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats hey man what a wonderful honor it is as i said to be here you know i believe as christians and and we are christians today i believe that we must always be progressing i don't believe that we can become comfortable where we are and become stagnant in our relationship with god but we are to always be progressing and in the world that we live in we can't take a moment to relax we can't relax because we live a life that is contrary to the flow of what the world is doing and where the world is going in other words we're going against the currents of the times we're going against the currents of this age and and if you've ever thrown anything into a river or a stream that didn't have the ability to fight against it it's going to go right where the current takes it and so in these times if we sit down and we relax and we become comfortable with where we're at what happens is you end up going with the current or going with the flow of society or the flow of the age so we must always be pushing hard against that current we must always be pushing hard and never relaxing in order for us to gain ground you're never going to gain ground in a battle by sitting back and doing nothing but you're going to have to take the battle to the enemy you're going to have to begin to push and you're going to have to begin to fight because we are to always be gaining ground and we're also to be producing fruit we are called to be a fruit-bearing people as christians we are supposed to have fruitful lives we're supposed to be have supposed to have lies that would produce the fruit of the spirit as it were lives that produce the fruits of the things that we claim that we have the fruits are the things that we claim to believe and i would say that more than anyone else on the face of the earth today we as a people who who have an uh a revealed word a book that is open we should have the ability to produce the fruits of the spirit people living lives on on half truths and seeing things through a glass darkly shouldn't be producing more fruits than the people who claim to be the bride of jesus christ we shouldn't have an issue producing a fruitful life in this day with what has been given to us so as individuals as we come to that and we look at that and we recognize the word is open um we've been restored back to a full word to a revealed word when we look at those things i want to ask you and ask myself even as we go into this what is it that hinders what keeps you from having the harvest that you should have or what is it that keeps you from reaching your maximum potential as a christian in this day okay what keeps you from being all that you can be in christ and not saying oh not that you're a sinner not not putting you on the outside not saying that you're not fighting but what keeps us from a more bountiful harvest he's called you to be fruitful he's given you something to do what keeps you from reaping a greater harvest brother branham says god bless you god bless you god bless you in the balcony is somebody up in the balcony would say brother branham i once had the victory i once was a godly person but somehow another the weeds and the thorns and things has choked me down somehow another the weeds and the thorns and things has choked me down now what what has happened to this person what has happened to their life this person says i once had the victory we're not talking about somebody who doesn't claim anything we're not talking about a ranked center this is someone who for a time could look at you and say i'm walking in victory i'm possessing what god has given me they had a victorious life for a time and they're saying but something has changed i once was a godly person now notice what he says has stolen away that victory the weeds and thorns in things has choked me down the weeds and thorns and things has choked me down now as we said christians are called to be fruitful we've been given every tool and everything that we would ever need every resource we would ever need in order to do that and we're instructed be fruitful these are the fruits of the spirit these are the things that you should be producing as a church you're called to be a fruitful church you're called not to just be dead not to just be living on on some past moves on some past glory on some past traditions but you're called to be a church that's bringing forth the same fruits as the very first church there in the book of acts because it's the same brother branham would say if it ever puts forth another branch it'll write another book of acts because it's off of that same vine so you're called to be fruitful brother branham said there in the ephesian age he said that the church at pentecost is the standard it is the pattern and god has not changed that pattern he says there is no other pattern so you're given a pattern and you see what's supposed to happen and you see the harvest that's supposed to come forth and you're called to be fruitful we're called to have fruitful homes we're called to have a to create an atmosphere that is right for the spiritual growth of the family where children can be nurtured where evils are kept out and where the token is applied and so many times we focus on taking care of the physical needs of our children and being providers and doing those things and god bless you we should do those things but in that home it is to be fruitful in spiritual things to nurture your children in spiritual things a place where the evils of the world are kept out so many times we want to keep kids away from well don't do that that's bad don't go there that's bad and then we turn around and allow things into our home that are just as evil or influence them in just a way we're so focused on don't go don't go don't go and let things in the home that have just as evil and influence but we can't have a fruitful home if we're allowing those influences into our home so we're called to have a spiritual church built on spiritual families which are built by spiritual leaders our lives to are to be set aside and dedicated to him in a way that his fruits can be brought forth through our lives amen not bearing forth my own fruits not seeing what i can produce not what i can be not living according to how i see fit or what i think brother brano meant right here be careful with your own interpretation and twist and your own seasoning as we would call it the lord delivered this message exactly the way he wanted it it was put before us the way he wanted we don't have to spice it up and season it to our taste you may you should feed on it enough to where that is your taste that is what you love that is what you want to ingest you don't have to change it to fit your liking change your liking to fit the word amen so people like to say well it's my life it's my life actually it's not your life it's his life lent to you and he intends for it to be surrendered back to him for his purpose to bring forth his fruits here upon the earth he expects your life surrendered amen not conforming to the world and producing fruits of the world but living a life led by the spirit producing the fruits of the spirit so what hindereth amen in galatians we read that the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance which there means self-control no i'm not sure about you and your personal testimony some of you i haven't spent a ton of time around but i will openly admit i haven't maxed out all of these i haven't taken all of these and went yep got all that got all that got out i'm not there yet i'm willing to be honest i look at some of these and i go long suffering that means patience eh [Music] i struggle having patience i used to think i was a very patient person but then 15 years in the public school system made me extremely unpatient impatient i think would be the proper way to say it either way my patience is messed up so i understand that i can look at these things and i can say there's things in here i can pick out way more than that that i need more of but you got to be willing to say god i recognize my lack i recognize those things aren't happening lord whatever it takes break me mold me move me to the place where i need to be where i can bring forth the fruits that you've called me to bring forth so i can be the christian that you've called me to be i know that my harvest could be more bountiful i know that i could be bringing forth more fruits of the spirit because a life fully surrendered to christ will bring forth his fruits and for us as christians it's not an option it is what the master expects of you he expects you to be bringing forth his fruits it's not an optional thing it's not something we just chalk up to personality well that brother he was just blessed with a meek personality and he's just blessed with patience listen when you get there on that day your excuses won't matter he's going to say i put you there on the earth to show the world what a human would be with my spirit living in them what it would produce with my spirit living out from them it doesn't matter what family you're from it doesn't matter we can't use those things as crutches anymore well my family just has temper problems we're called to be cycle breakers in this day we're called to show the world that the holy ghost will break the powers of the flesh the holy ghost will help you rise above family cycles the cycle of revival and death has never failed but there is a people in this day that will break that that cycle year after year you've seen revivals going to death revivals going to death you've seen people go a little bit and slide back but there is a people on the face of the earth today they're not going down into death they're not going back to a denomination but he's called them for a rapture he's called them to produce fruits he's caused them to overcome in this day and that's who we're called to be we can't just chalk these things up to personality [Music] which surely your personality and plays a role in who you are surely it plays a part but that is flesh and although it will always war with you it is not to control you you hear all the time but my flesh is unconverted my flesh is unconverted there is truth in that this flesh is unconverted but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world there is a holy ghost light that rises up on the inside of this flesh that controls this flesh says you're a son of god you turn your head from those things that's not what we feed on yes we're going to church yes we're going to worship yes we're going to overcome the inside man rises up and takes power over the flesh not vice versa not i sin because my flesh is unconverted i couldn't turn my head because my flesh is unconverted that's not how it works there is a token life on the inside of you that takes control of this flesh that subdues this flex and brings it subject to the word of god galatians 5 24 and they that are christ have crucified the flesh listen to life with the holy ghost living on the throne of it we'll have a battle as much as the next man he'll have struggles as much as the next man but that life will bear out victory that life will bear out fruits that man will walk after the spirit and not after the flesh and the fruits of the spirit will be evident listen all lives have seasons it's not that it's always mountain top mountain a matter of fact the mountaintops isn't where the fruit is grown all lives have seasons there's valleys there's mountains there's things you go through there's briar patches there's brambles there's troubles and there's hardships all lives have mountains and valleys and therefore you're going to have times where the harvest is great and other times where it seems as if it's such a struggle i'm going through such a hard time i'm struggling but even when it seems that you are not in a fruit growing season it is your responsibility to make sure that the ground stays prepared that you stay in a place that the walls of your estate stay fortified that the walls of protection around the garden stays up and strong not torn down and that you are in a condition to produce fruit so that your life is prepared to take that seed and nurture it and allow it to manifest exactly what god intended for it to manifest when he sent it by your way but if we're just sitting there in the mother grubs and i'm going through hard times and a seed of the word can come across the pulpit that is supposed to manifest a hundredfold in your life but the ground isn't prepared and you're not in a position to produce fruits because you haven't kept the ground prepared you haven't stayed on top of the situation and if you allowed you've allowed that season in your life to dictate your mood you've allowed that season in your life to dictate your worship you've allowed a season in a life to dictate your amount of overcoming but no sir whether it's a good season a bad season a good time or a hard time christians for the holy ghost press on with their head held high they worship anyway they push through anyway they overcome anyway they prepare to to produce the fruits of the spirit at all times good yes sir praise the lord it's not to say you never have issues it's not to say that bringing forth good fruit won't be a struggle at times that you're never going to have an argument or a disagreement except for me and my wife it's humanity struggles and hardships are gonna be there i won't say that you won't ever do something wrong goodness because nature is hungry and it wants to consume you and that's what we're going to speak on today is the hunger of nature the hunger of nature this beast nature is your enemy the way i like to say it is this you are not your friend this flesh as we said is unconverted and it will be a thorn in your side as long as you are here and it will try to fill your life with thorns and thistles to choke out the fruits that the spirit is supposed to bring forth in your life we know that originally adam and eve didn't have to deal with the sin nature when they were first placed in the garden but because of reasoning and eve stepping out from behind of her wall of protection the serpent was able to get in and cause eve to fall then mankind and all of the earth fell with adam and eve genesis 3 and 17 says and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return so earth was cursed before this time adam had no trouble getting food he had no trouble finding food it was all produced and waiting and ready for him adam had no trouble bringing forth fruit he never had to work and he never had to sweat for anything in eden nature was not adam's enemy but it all worked in harmony together as god intended it had not been a war with him in the eden condition adam was in total control the weeds didn't try to take over the life of the flu fruit-bearing plants wasn't choked out by thorns and thistles adam operating from this place called eden he was told there in genesis 1 28 to subdue the earth so operating from this place god says subdue the earth in other words eden is to stretch from sea to sea expand it take more possess more make it all operate underneath your dominion go and subdue the earth but instead of fulfilling this commission what adam does is he falls and the earth that he was to control fell also and now a constant struggle begins cursed is the ground thorns and thistles shall it bring forth dust thou heart dust thou shalt return listen what are we talking about it's not just dust out here that's cursed it's not just gonna be difficult to bring forth fruits out in a garden but he's saying this earth is now cursed now it's gonna be difficult to bring forth the fruits that this life is intended to bring forth because earth has been cursed this nature is now against you this nature is now your enemy and now earth the cursed earth begins calling for the bodies that came out of it to return unto it this is where death sets in and now dust thou heart dust thou shalt return and the earth begins to call and it begins to draw your bodies back and as you get older you begin to stoop a little bit you begin to ache a little bit you begin to hurt a little bit sickness comes in nature always has a desire to reclaim what has been taken from it amen and so these bodies come from the earth and earth is calling it back you came from the earth and the earth is drawing you back into it that sounds uh dismal that sounds disappointing you came from the earth you're going back to it but don't you worry about it none little children even if you were to go by the way of the grave there is a resurrection that is the truth of the word there is a resurrection brother branham says over and over again even he says it's not even a replacement it is a resurrection this body that you're living in even if satan takes it by the way of the grave he does not win he does not possess it your body will not be annihilated he said these same 16 elements these same ones he says he will resurrect he said the same one that took dust that day and went and stepped into a body to come to abraham he said he'll come and he'll take a handful that day on the day of resurrection he'll go step into it he said it'll be that simple it'll be that simple this same body that i live in here i will dwell in there in an immortal condition in a glorified condition satan does not win no matter what a loved one goes down and death satan does not win no matter what our god has the final say yes sir brother brown says christianity believes in resurrection the whole thing's based on resurrection he says everything that death has did to you will be forgotten in the resurrection glory everything that death did all the decay everything will be forgotten when my god says step into it glorified once again hallelujah he said that's my father no matter what happens to this potassium calcium he knows right where it's laying i was standing before a glass not long ago combing these few hairs i got left my wife said to me said billy you're almost completely ball headed i said i haven't lost in one of them she said pray tell me where they're at i said i'll answer you when you answer me tell me where they were before i got them i'll tell you where they're waiting for me hallelujah this body will not be annihilated this earth brother brown talks about it he says god laid out everything on the earth before we even got here your body was here waiting on the time that you would arrive your body was already here he said it's like a contractor laying out his lumber he had it all laid out waiting for you here listen this body was god's first it never did belong to the devil it never was meant for sin it never was meant for sickness it never was meant to go down into death that's why we have a right to say satan get out this isn't your body this is god's body it may be it may be brought down by the curse but there's something on the inside of me being drawn back and i can subdue it and i can say sickness go death go sin go i have a right to do it because this body belonged to god first hallelujah no matter what satan does satan loses i'll rise again not in a replacement but in a resurrection brother brown says now if that's the kind of god we're serving if that's the omnipotence we're serving then what have we got to worry about sickness or death or sorrow or corruption or whatever more one of these days all these old atoms that's holding these bodies together is going to be broke away and we're going back to the dust and the lights going back and all the other parts of the earth is going back to its place but at the resurrection he will step into it and that'll be it yes sir isn't that wonderful amen i say it's wonderful today amen that even though there is a curse and there's a time element to these bodies satan doesn't win he doesn't when he doesn't even annihilate our bodies so many times we we focus on the soul as we should but we just want to let satan well i'm sick well i'm this tell him to go it wasn't his body to begin with it wasn't his to begin with god laid it out here on the earth before i ever even showed it before there was a fall before satan even rose up in heaven to rebel i was already here upon this earth but it is true that earth is drawing and pulling at these bodies seeing nature laid a claim on mankind right there at the fall and the earth became crowned in attributes of sin there's wickedness sickness and death thorns and thickets became a symbol of the curse how could one bring forth fruits in that condition how could someone bring forth fruits living in cursed earth how can you be required to overcome the curse walking around in a part of cursed earth and i'm thankful that god didn't just let adam and eve walk away that day without the promise of a redeemer brother brown says and then when i see adam as it was standing there and eve the beautiful stature of her and while she's standing there these old bloody sheepskins the blood running down her legs adam and this great fine stature of a man the blood of these sheepskins running down him standing there pronouncing death sorrow heartaches and destruction watch then i see put her lovely head over on adam's shoulder and him put his arms around her they started weeping turned around and started to walk out of his presence god depart from him he sinned there's your judgment then when i hear going down along the path through the garden of eden something like this what is it bloody sheepskins slapping on adam's leg as he went down then i could see all that great spaceless eternity come forming down like a funnel to form four little letters l o v e you know that's the part that satan never can't understand that's the part he never can wrap his little mind around is every time you struggle every time you fail every time you were out in the world wayward from god he said i got him he'll never forgive him he'll never accept him back and god said come on back little son come on back little child because satan can't comprehend love he thought i had him i've got him wrapped up i've got him bound down and then one day in one moment's time you're back in the presence of god forgiven with the robe of righteousness wrapped around your life how how l o v e satan can't comprehend that brother brother says he loved his children so much until he couldn't turn them away then i hear him say stop oh hallelujah i'll put enmity between thy seed in the serpent seed promising a redeemer god making preparation to redeem hallelujah what god gave in that moment was a substitute there in the garden he took the life of an innocent lamb and it covered their nakedness the shedding of that blood covered their sins but that blood didn't have the power to bring cursed earth subject it didn't have the power to bring the earth's subject it didn't have the power to subdue nature we see it there at mount moriah genesis 22 and 11 and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son that only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son what is this we know this is just a foreshadowing of christ to come but it was still a woolly lamb even though it is a foreshadowing of the great kinsmen redeemer it is still a woolly lamb the life of that lamb could not come back upon abraham it could not come in and subdue abraham's nature and and give him the power to live above sin nature it couldn't give man power to subdue this flesh so year after year even with that substitute man would have to come back in again and offer another come back in and offer another and yes the sin was covered but he would walk back out with the same habits he would walk back out with the same struggles he would walk back out with the same sins the same failures in the scripture we just looked at i want you to notice the thicket there the ram is caught in the thicket a thicket is made of thorns and a thicket is made of brambles if you're literally seeing the curse from genesis 3 18 represented here in this foreshadowing you're seeing the curse from genesis 3 18 and the thorns are upon the head of the ram showing that sin's curse would be upon his head notice when he goes to calvary what's on his head his sins curse the thorns and the curse from genesis 3 and 18 but the difference here in the two is in this moment it's the ram that is trapped by the thicket sin's curse still has power over a woolly lamb he's trapped he can't go anywhere yes it'll cover sins but it's not going to break free oh but it's just a foreshadowing of things to come what was it foreshadowing behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the earth when they put those thorns on his head jesus wasn't trapped he wasn't caught in a tangle but he took those thorns and he marched up calvary's hill and there he crushed sin's curse he broke the power of the curse right there and now because he wasn't trapped but the tables were turned and he carried sins curse up calvary because he isn't trapped now since curse is broken off of man now there is a power for you to be able to overcome the lamb takes those thorns to calvary and he crushes the curse and through his death and through his burial and through his resurrection and then the return of his holy spirit there on the day of pentecost now man has the power once again to subdue once again man has the power to subdue nature that has been ruling over him ever since the fall this has ruled man this has ruled man but now now that this lamb has come not a woolly lamb but the great kinsmen redeemer he's turned the tables and now this doesn't rule you but you have the power to rule over this hallelujah now there is a place inside of man that he can operate from in order to bring forth fruit now there is a place returned back to the eden condition once again not since genesis 1 28 had man been in the position to subdue nature back in 128 and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it not since the time of fall has man stepped back into this place but now there is a portion of the inside man that is back in that condition and he says subdue the earth what the earth no subdue the earth subdue the earth take control of it take more take more press forward press forward overcome more cast down the flesh more subdue the earth be fruitful and multiply upon the face of the earth what happens when you are saved and filled with the holy ghost it takes a part of you back from fallen nature it takes a part of you back from the curse and puts it back in its original condition once again your soul is now ruled by the spirit a part of you is now beyond the control of the flesh and that part begins to rule over the flesh and then we get in behind the wall of the word and behind that wall we're safe behind that wall nothing can hurt us and behind that wall we produce fruits the wall keeps out the enemy the wall keeps out the wild beast the wall of his word and behind that wall we're growing and we're fruitful and the things that we're called to do are taking place there and sin nature once again is being ruled amen and so now because of this change in your life when sin would rise up you have the power to put it down when sin is placed before you you have the power to rise above it and overcome it when temptation comes instead of it ruling over you and you falling to it now you rise above it and you conquer it because now you are no longer walking by the flesh you're no longer walking according to the curse but you are walking according to the spirit oh what a power that is what a place that is for a believer whereas before you couldn't now you can whereas before you would fall now you have the ability to stand what a place to stand as a redeemed blood boat blood washed sons and daughters of the living god filled with the baptism of the holy ghost you can't fail you can't fall oh yeah don't say that brother and i can't say that brother branham said this eve will not fall like the first eve dead he says she's predestinated not to fall what a place to stand what a place of empowerment knowing that you o god prepared a way that i can rule over the curse of the earth hallelujah once again earth is subject to a son of god and you were told subdue it take more control more overcome more hallelujah a place within you has returned to a condition of power an eden on the inside of cursed earth and the cursed earth around that eden now here's where we get into our title the cursed earth around that eden wants to take it back nature hungers to take back what was taken from it the cursed earth wants to subdue your place of eden it wants you to back off what you've claimed it wants you to back off and give back over to the desires of the flesh listen you don't have to back off one thing that god's promised you you don't have to back off with one thing it doesn't matter the doctor's report it doesn't matter what the devil says to you if god says you're healed you can stand right there on that it's yours god said i give you the baptism of the holy ghost you can stand there and lay claim to that promise you don't have to back off of it you don't have to back off one thing amen brother branham said that satan was stripped of every right he ever had that day on calvary and every redemptive promise is given back to the believer this morning stand there stand firm overcome rejoice in it be fruitful in it it's yours this morning church you can have all of it don't stop short don't settle for a little don't just strike two or three times be victorious overcome claim at all for you and your family hallelujah oh it wants to claim you it wants to take you back it wants you to back off but just like adam in the garden of eden you are told expand your dominion subdue subdue the flesh when the flesh doesn't want to worship my soul sings when the flesh says it's time to quit i can't quit i can't back down when the flesh says give up i can't give up there's a seed gene of god down on the inside of me and it's pulling me higher it's pulling me further something keeps holding me what is it it's not me i failed too many times i gave up too many times but when something down on the inside of me quickened that same gene of god there's no going back i can't go back there's nothing to go back to church hallelujah expand your dominion press the battle this morning overcome the world hallelujah walk in victory and bring forth fruit colossians 1 10 that you might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work increasing in the knowledge of god strengthening with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness brother brown says and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience meekness temperance fruits of the spirit god knows today that what the holiness people need and also the calvinist and all of them needs today is more fruits of the spirit more lives to prove it he says we've had many testimonies but as the old saying is your life speaks so loud i can't hear your voice we are written epistles of god read of all men even in this condition that i've spoke of where a part of you is returned to eden once again your soul even in these conditions we can go through dry times we can go through times where we ourselves maybe get just a little lacks and i'm not speaking of backsliding i'm just speaking of maybe fervency it's where we get a little relaxed go through dry times we find ourselves in a situation like the ones where brother branham was speaking to at the very beginning of our service where he says god bless you in the balcony if somebody up in the balcony would say brother branham i once had the victory i once was a godly person but somehow another the weeds and the thorns and the things has choked me down the curse has choked me down now look i'm not talking about going back into the world that's not what we're dealing with today i'm not even saying living a life with sin in it i'm talking about someone who finds that they don't have the victory quite like they once did that their joy just isn't full like it once was maybe little things are nagging at your life something is choking down the harvest so you just aren't bringing forth a harvest like the scripture would say to 30 60 or even a hundred fold maybe you're still harvesting the fruits but it's there should be more something's lacking lord i know there's more and what we have to realize is it doesn't take sinful things sinful things to rob you the bible says seeds were choked out by the cares of life guys the cares of life and my estimation just means the things that you have to take care of and sure there may be some other things mixed in there but going to work is a care of life paying the bills is a care of life providing for the family is a care of life these are things you have to take care of these aren't sinful things but if you allow them to come to the forefront if you allow them to become your focus if you begin to allow those things to choke out your joy and choke out your peace then your harvest gets robbed but regardless of why regardless of what it is if you find yourself in this place where you just aren't progressing forward the way you would like to i want to ask you a question so that we can reflect on ourselves so we can self-reflect for just a moment how up-to-date is your experience when is the last time you took another step with god now notice i'm not saying you've gone backwards how long have you been standing in the same place is what i'm asking you our experiences with god i believe it's very important for us to understand i believe most of us do but our experiences with god are not to be one and done it's not a one time thing yes you must have your upper room experience i believe that you must have your own backside of the desert burning bush experience just like moses had i believe that brother branham said that burning bush had what moses lacked i believe he has what you lack today i believe he has what i lack today he you must have those experiences there's no doubt but we also must remember that he is el shaddai the strength giver he is there with you all the time he is an ever present help in a time of need when is the last time you called out for more of god when is the last time you said lord i need a refilling of the baptism of the holy ghost i need you to pour it out in my life today i need more of you today thank you for what you did last time thank you for wednesday night thank you for sunday before but i'm standing here today lord in need of more of you in need of an outpouring in need of overcoming you i need more joy i need more peace i need more patience lord everything you have for me pour it out today lord i need more of you today father because we can't serve god on a memory we can't serve god on what he's done oh i love what god's done i believe we should testify of what god's done but i believe we lose the purpose of testimony many times it's not just so we know that god was powerful we tell testimonies of god's power so we can know what he'll do today so we know if he did it yesterday he'll do it today he healed yesterday he'll do it today he filled with the holy ghost yesterday he will do it today amen i say if you come into dry places this morning take a drink he is el shaddain he's here for you take another drink this morning your experience is not to be a one-time thing he's calling you today to new heights he's calling you today to deeper depths there is more of god for you today he calls you two more but in order to get that you got to press forward you've got to subdue the curse you've got to operate from the dominion of that place that has been restored back hallelujah listen and not to get things twisted up i fully understand that once you have received the baptism of the holy ghost the bible teaches us you were sealed until the day of your redemption i'm not talking about you losing your salvation i'm saying become all that god has called you to be maximize everything he's called you to be he didn't restore this word and send a prophet in this day so we could barely make it no sir this word gives us overcoming power amen this book was open and i saw my name there and now what can stand before me what can hold me back what can keep me here nothing can keep me here i'm not gonna barely make it but i'm going in as a conqueror i'm going in as an overcomer because that's what we're called to do hallelujah amen press the battle this morning to another outpouring seek for more walk to another milestone pray for more revelation brother branham would say you could never pray too much about revelation or to receive too much revelation you know one thing i i've said before that if you're always walking forward you will never point backward to a time you were greater in the lord than you are now to point backward to something you were is the testimony of a backslider if you were at a greater place with god a year ago then you are backslidden but if you're always walking with god and progressing with god then today you're at the greatest point the apex of your spiritual walk with god right now in this moment you don't have to point back you can say god is good today god is my savior today god is my healer today i am an overcomer today because he is a present god he is a living god and you have been fellowshipping with him in the moment amen hallelujah if god has done something wonderful for you in your life don't stop there we praise god for that but you feed it you grow in it you be more tomorrow it's been many situations and many moments where i've been a part of where i see dealing with somebody in their life or praying with somebody at the altar where i see the holy ghost fall on people or discern hearts in ways that would blow your mind whatever the case may be but then within just a month or two or a year or whatever it is find that person right back in the same situation and you know god came down you were there when it happened you know what they experienced was a real touch of god you were there when it happened but what happens is that person thought that was it i've received it that's all there is instead of recognizing that was my start from here i press forward from here i feed it that was god showing me he loved me that was god speaking to me telling me i was his that was god moving on my heart now from here i'm gonna grow from here i'm going to put another log on the fire to here from here i'm going to seek another experience with god one of the greatest signs that i know of of a sold-out experience is an intense desire for more brother branham says now i'll give you my estimation of what i think the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a christian than anything i know of you know what it is it's travail of soul a person that's always so hungering and thirsting for god they just simply day and night they just can't stand it they need more they want to experience more they want to taste more if you've ever tasted it you want to taste more amen i i say if there is no desire in your heart to taste more i i doubt if you ever tasted it the first time if you ever get a little taste you're going to want more of that taste you're going to feed more on that you're going to want to pour in more of that into your body into your soul when you have an experience with god when you reclaim a portion of that fallen nature and you begin to subdue this flesh then the battle begins because nature will always try to take back what it has lost listen a person with the holy ghost is not going to go out and commit adultery a person with the holy ghost is not going to go out and and seek out and look at pornography a person with the holy ghost isn't going to go out and willfully sin can we all agree to that but don't think that there aren't going to be traps for you just because you have the holy ghost don't think there's not going to be attacks at you and probings and looking for your points of weakness and looking for ways to get you to stumble listen the devil's been studying man a long time you know we like to say things like dumb old devil and yeah he is dumbo devil but let me tell you what he knows you he knows your shortcomings and your weaknesses i know he knows mine because he likes to point them out all the time but this is why you must have an up-to-date and fresh experience you have to have the strength to keep pushing you have to keep subduing because the minute you sit down the minute you relax and the moment you take a break the weeds and the thorns and the thistles and the hunger of nature begins to creep in to what you have taken back amen what do i mean by the hunger of nature what do i mean that nature will always try to reclaim what is taken from it brother if you'll give me the pictures up here i think i want to give you an example of the hunger of nature it's an escalator in a once extremely busy area that led to a mall the hundreds and thousands of people that rode this escalator through the years probably never envisioned this they never saw this it was well oiled it was working it was used it was beautiful it was set apart it was set aside for service but the moment that it quit being used and tended to and was neglected it almost looks like a jungle maybe thank you he said he made this dummy proof i knew we'd test that look at this house yeah i saw this it almost caused a little bit of melancholy to come over because i thought that house once experienced the pitter patter of new life feet running through the living room of holidays meals together supper as night fell they had carved out this this place and made it a home you know you can clear out a spot in the woods you can cut down all the trees you can clear a nice yard there you can build a house you can plant a nice garden and that place can be so full of so much life but you got to stay on top of it because nature is going to try to creep back in this weed pops up and you deal with it this thorn bush pops up and you deal with it but you stop taking care of that place for a minute listen i'm not exactly sure how it is up here from what i've been told i've been experiencing incredible weather that you know you don't usually get tons of this but back home during the growing season this is my yard after like three weeks at least it feels that way not the trees that'd take a minute but you stopped tending to something for a minute it's no longer an inhabitable place it's no longer a fruitful place it's no longer a place where the right type of life is abounding stop tending to it for one little bit stop reading your bible the way you're supposed to stop playing sermons as much as you used to stop praying and having prayer time and alone time as much as you used to and soon the weeds begin to move in amongst your grass stop working the garden the way you used to and keeping the weeds out and soon your harvest will not be what it once was an entire village reclaimed by nature nature's hungry the house is completely almost growing back into the hillside one person keeping it off one section of their house one person here in the midst of laodicea one person here in the midst of legacy of fighting back taking the sword keeping it off keeping it pushed back keeping it fought back i will have a place where the fruits of the spirit can come forth i will have a place cleared of all the of the curse i will not let the curse and the thorns and the thickets overtake my home and overtake my soul and overtake my life completely overtaken imagine what it would take to clear this away a lot more work than it would take to go deal with that weed that's sprouting up in your life you know a weed here and a weed there you can deal with it that's what you're called to do is deal with it but let it grow for a while don't deal with it don't tend to it and what do you have you have a place overgrown you have a place that you don't even know where to start but lord where do i start what do i do soon weeds begin to move in and choke out your harvest listen the weeds and the thorns and the curse that this earth is under will never stop trying because nature is hungry to consume and take back what it has lost but but pardon my little analogy here but you're the one that has all the roundup that's what we call the spray that kills the weeds back home i don't know what it's called here but you got the roundup you've got the lawnmower you've got the proper fertilizer you've got the weed and feed it's time to pour the weed and feed back on the lawn again it feeds the good and it kills the bad it feeds the spiritual man and it pushes the natural man down and says no boy you're not going to rise up here feed on the right things it'll take care of the weeds feed on the right things and it'll strengthen your harvest feed on the right things it's time to date no matter what condition you're in you may be getting all tangled up in complexes thorns and things tangling you up robbing your joy robbing your peace choking out your victory we've all been in places like that but it's not too late today to say i'm gonna take a stand and i'm gonna take the sword of the word and i'm gonna begin chopping at it lord i don't know where to start but i'm just going to start swinging the sword at the word against anything that's contrary to what you promised me i could have i'm going to cut back the thorns i'm going to cut back the weeds this is my portion of eating i'm claiming my portion you can't have it back not only that but i'm going to subdue more i'm going to take more i want more joy and i'm going to take it i want more peace and i'm going to take it i want more victory today lord and i'm going to take it i'm gonna take it today i'm gonna be an overcomer i'm called to be a fruitful christian i'm gonna subdue pride i'm gonna subdue my temper i'm gonna subdue selfishness and i'm going to do it by pouring in the nutrients of the word pouring in the nutrients of the spirit hey it's a fight church but i'm going to fight for more i'm going to claim more i'm going to subdue more because nature hungers but the spirit hungers as well which one are you going to feed i'm going to feed the spirit and i'm going to subdue nature i'm going to subdue the earth i'm going to rise above it because the spirit on the inside will also hunger and as long as that's what you're feeding it'll never end up like this the spirit man will continually subdue the flesh that's why we feed on spiritual food that's why your experience must be up to date because when it becomes stagnant that's when the weeds grow that's when the thorns come in listen you can't feed the natural all the time your diet can't be constant movies and worldly music and you going what happened to my harvest you sprayed poison on it that's what happened to it that's right but if your diet is the word if the nutrients that you're pouring into the ground is the right fertilizer then the ground will produce the right harvest amen hallelujah thank you jesus oh my you're right there is no clock in here hallelujah maybe you've been noticing that the harvest hasn't been as plenty as it should be maybe the joy isn't there maybe your self-control isn't there the patience the kindness it's time to start examining your patch of ground time to examine it have you been tending your life the way you used to when you first fell in love with jesus checking up at all times watching vigilantly over the fruit making sure there was no weeds coming in making sure there was nothing there robbing the life from your harvest me and my wife we try to grow a few tomatoes and we don't even eat tomatoes but we do like salsa and so we grow tomatoes for that purpose and i haven't been doing it very long but one day i come out and like an entire top half of one of my bushes was just gone there was nothing there but stems look i'm not a gardener but that ain't right that's not how it's supposed to work and so you get to looking and sometimes you have to look really hard sometimes it's not just this obvious thing but there's this big giant green horn tomato worm and you think oh that'd be easy to find but he blends right in so many times the message has become such a lifestyle to us that you can blend right in and there's tomato worms all in your life eating up your harvest but nobody else can see it you've learned how to blend listen guys this this is supposed to be more than a lifestyle you know we're not here to bash anybody or talk down anybody but but we're not the amish in that this is our lifestyle this is a life you've been called to that you can only live truthfully with the holy ghost living on the inside of you overcoming through you and if it's just a lifestyle then then you're basically a make-believer you're pretending but sometimes you got to get down close and look and it's hard to spot and it's hard to find and one of the hardest things to do is to be honest with yourself it's easy to be honest about what's bothering other people they need jesus that prayer that's easy but sometimes can we be real with us can we be honest with ourselves it's amazing there's a certain honesty that you can't control that honesty that runs through your heart when you're laying there with your head on your pillow and you know but when it comes time to dealing with it you don't because you convince yourself that it's not that big a deal that little bitty green horn tomato worm will go from like that to like that overnight and they'll eat one leaf one day and it's not that big a deal and the next day your bush is gone your harvest is ruined instead of getting in there and finding what it is and dealing with it so that you can produce the harvest you were called to produce what is it that choked the life out of my harvest thorns and thistles cursed earth your flesh brother brown would say what we needs in old-fashioned scoring out digging out get those weeds out of the patch so the corn can grow jesus is coming all right that's what we need back to the old hewing line again back to the way god will come among us he says sometimes we have to go through terrible chastisement chastening of the lord many things to correct us that will be fruit bearing christians sometimes he has to prune us cut off take away take out our hands we think sometime oh god what are you doing to us but he knows what he's doing so we pray father that today you'll prune every one of us from the least to the greatest the pastor god we pray that you'll prune every one of us take away all that's unlike you father take away the thing that's hindering us from being fruit bearing christians matthew 21 19 and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever and presently the fig tree withered away well what's that got to do with it brother aaron he expected that tree to bear fruit because that's what he put it there for don't let the master come walking by your way and find you not bearing the fruit that he put you there to bear finding he comes walking by and he finds the field overgrown like we found in proverbs finding the wall torn down seeing that nature has now taken the fruit this is back where we were at the beginning proverbs 24 31 and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stonewall thereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction listen this is solomon and he's strolling by and this man did not know that the king was walking by his field that day think about that for a moment he didn't know it was the day the king was going to come inspect his field that he was going to look and see as the tenant in the home doing what i asked him to do is the fence built properly is the field properly taken care of is he bearing fruit for me first thessalonians 5 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night mark 13 33 take ye heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is but what i'm asking you is is when that time is when the king comes is he going to find you bearing fruit or is he going to find nothing but symptoms of the curse excuses symptoms of the curse fall in nature reclaiming the field the wall of protection all broke down listen he gave us a wall that would completely protect us eve stepped out from behind it we must not he gave us a word he gave us the protection brother brown says we're fortified by the word of god and the devil knew that so he tried in the only the spy the devil was trying to find a way into that wall he might have tried pleasure he might have tried everything but you know where he got eve reasonings the bible said we should cast down reasoning faith does not reason is isn't it reasonable brother branham that the church is in a better state today than it was at azusa street or back in that time no sir they've got away from the word they've got away from from where they're shield the word is our protection and though people wouldn't dare to say they didn't believe it they claim it but their action speaks louder than their words we're going to begin to bring this down now i want to focus on this we are to be fruitful christians we are to tend the field we are supposed to take care of the wall and stay behind the wall that protects our field even if the field had been growing crops that solomon walked past they wouldn't ever come to harvest because the wall was torn down and the wild beasts would have come in and eaten up all the the fruits laying on the ground so even had he tended the field he had he had neglected the word he had neglected his protection he had allowed it to crumble and so what i'm saying today is you got to repair the gaps in the wall you got to build up the broken parts in your life accept correction from the word of god when it is coming your way accept that correction and allow the spirit to lead you and allow that word to be stacked stone upon stone upon stone to protect your harvest listen the stones are there the stones have been restored what you need to fix the wall and what you need for protection is there for you but you've got to allow god to place those stones in your life for solid fortification to protect from the beast to protect from the curse to protect the ground from that which would rob you and solomon says as he goes by i received instruction he immediately knows all he needs to know about this man is what he's saying i looked at his field and received all i needed to know about who this person was i received instruction because he hasn't repaired the wall and he hasn't tended his field i asked you this morning how's your harvest how's the wall of protection are you staying behind it if the king were to walk by today how's he gonna find your wall of defense have you been feeding on it enough that it's built up and it's strong and it's fortified and it surrounds you and it's around your family brother brown says it's time to inspect the rose it's time to take the sword of god's word and cut back the weeds and the thorns it's time today that we quit being complacent with where we are thank god for what we have thank god for what he's done but i want more today the word of god caused you to subdue the word of god tells you to take the sword of the word and drive the enemy from the field driving back from your harvest driving back from your joy driving back from your children driving back from your marriage drive him out of your home and subdue more of this flesh you have to say i will take more i will fertilize this with the word of god i will allow the spirit to correct me i will have joy i will have peace in this life i will be led by the spirit in this life i will be victorious i will have the harvest that god has called me to have hallelujah amen we have to tell satan to go and he will go you have a right to tell satan to go you have a right to he was stripped of every right and those rights have been pushed back put back in the hands of the believers you are blood bought you are blood washed you are redeemed you are sons and daughters of god and he may attack this body but we have a right to tell him to go how is it so the word gives us that right brother branham says enforce it we are we have the privilege to enforce upon satan the claims that god gives us for god has a law and his word is a law and god in his word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon satan say give it back and he has to do it because we can take god's agent the holy spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the lord he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land he says if satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of god we have a right this morning by the holy spirit to enforce the claim of god bring them back you got lost loved ones out there he says enforce the claim of god this morning bring them back if he's afflicted you and made you sick we have a right before god to enforce the laws of god by his stripes we are healed amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out there under death and we claim him bring him back now that's enforcement restore it back to its natural condition again a man is sick baby is sick woman is sick they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because god gave it to us by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the lawgiver the holy spirit himself is here the agent of god to see that it's done that way amen your harvest has been lacking i say build the wall back up tell the devil he's got to go there's been sickness in the home enforce the rights you have loved ones struggling bring them back in they're ours god promised them to us hallelujah they'll be there in their offspring with them i say it's time we kill the fatted calf i say it's time we start looking down the old dusty road prepare for those to come back to the house of god sometimes we want to rejoice when we see the miracle i say prepare for the miracle sometimes we want to rejoice we say when i get healed i'll rejoice when i get this i'll rejoice sometimes your answer is on the other side of your rejoicing sometimes your answers on the other side of your praise praise your way through the storm produce fruits in the storm overcome in the storm yes sir amen proverbs 25 28. he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that has broken down without walls see when the walls are broken down all that is good flows out and all that is evil flows in how is the wall around your soul this morning how's the wall around your children the wall around your home is it fruitful inside those walls listen the devil won't make it easy on you no as a matter of fact anytime we start having honest assessments of our lives it'll stir the devil up always because he wants you to be comfortable right where you are he wants you to be comfortable where you're sitting he wants you to be comfortable with half a harvest when there's so much more many times we don't even know what we're capable of producing because we've never done it we've never stepped out we've never surrendered everything many times we don't know what gift may be in our life we've never surrendered our life fully enough sanctified enough to where god can use a gift there's more for you amen there's more for you today he wants you comfortable though right where you're at right where you're sitting this morning he don't want you to rebuild the wall he doesn't want you to push back against the thorns and the brambles because those things are his access to your victory we're gonna end with this look when nehemiah went back to rebuild the wall around jerusalem it was recognizing that the wall needs to build back up so we can have our own harvest so we can establish what's rightfully ours so we can keep the enemy out and he goes back nehemiah 2 19. i'm going to read a good bit of scriptures here as we close it says but when sin ballot the hornite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshom the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king you know what's amazing about this if you read nehemiah much and realize it was literally the king who had given him the commission to do this the king had commissioned him so many times you go to do things for the lord and the devil comes and he tries to point out why are you even trying to do this what's your purpose what are you doing you're trying to do this to build yourself up are you trying because i have a commission from the king i can cast you out because i have a commission from the king i can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that goes for all of you because you have a commission from the king don't be afraid to exercise what the king has given you authority to do amen then answered them and said unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build i love this part but you have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem he instantly sets them in their place why are you worried about it because you're not going to be coming in here anymore anyway you're not coming in my home to rob anymore you're not coming to take my joy you're not coming to pa take my peace you have no right in this church anymore why are you worried about the fact that we're building up the walls of the holy spirit around this home and around this church this is our portion this is our inheritance this is what god has called us to you have no rights to it you have no portion here notice the mocking and the jeering devil always tries to mock your progress i don't care if you took a tiny step today take a tiny step i don't care if you just crawled a little bit you crawl a little bit he tries to mock your progress and they act as if all that has happened to you is nothing but all the while what it is is they're seeing a wall go up and they're not liking what they're seeing and so they're trying to mock it and they know this wall is going to keep them out and so they try to keep you from building the wall and he says this how it's got to be because you don't belong here anyway it's not for you listen the beasts don't like it when you put a wall up around your garden that's right but remember that harvest is not their portion that harvest is not for them to partake of young people old people alike but especially young people whenever you start building and you have an experience and then this happens and then you and the devil will come go you didn't get anything that wasn't real you haven't done anything what would you really do maybe you got a little excited look at all the rest of this wall in your life that's torn down and what he likes to do is he'll take away from the portion that's been rebuilt and point to your struggles point to your failures i say point back and go that's okay this section was once looking like that as well but look today this section's rebuilt this section's strong and i move into that section and i'm moving to that section i'm gonna put stone upon stone and word upon word and i'm gonna allow myself to be fortified by the word listen it doesn't matter how little of the victory every victory matters every experience you have with god matters they were real they were important and the devil was just upset because he just saw another stone go on top and he goes that's just one more place i can't get in that's one more place i can't attack their family and so he tries to mock it and he tries to jeer chapter four verse one and it came to pass that when sam balot heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews and he spake before his brethren and the army of sumerians said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned i'll answer those questions for the devil today that's exactly what we're going to do we are going to fortify ourselves we are going to sacrifice unto the lord we are going to restore the walls that have been torn down that's what we're doing and we're gonna keep doing it until there's no access of the enemy into our lives to our souls are fortified our homes are fortified our souls our children each and every one are inside the walls of protection yes satan we are building the wall hallelujah now tobiah the ammonite was by him and said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall mocking the wall is so weak that if a fox were to bump into it it would fall over how many times oh you didn't get what you got last night you really thought the lord touched you you really thought that was any little devil brush up against it you know one thing i noticed teaching middle school is that bullies run their mouth because they really don't want to fight and so they try to talk you out of a fight by intimidation you think you want some of this you think you want this i'll do this to you i'll do that to you and i'm sorry maybe this is the southerner i don't know maybe y'all would like it too but you see so many times little kids get bullied and go into submission and you have to step in and be like you're not going to talk to them that way but really you didn't teach the bully a lesson one of my favorite things i ever saw was this bully with this little kid's arm twisting it and you're gonna do this and you're gonna find that little kid had enough and just said bam bully fell out and i'm like yes sir i'm telling you this morning the devil's gotta hold to your arm and the devil's twisting it and he's making fun of all that you've done and what god's done in your life and the wall is getting built up but he's bullying and he's bullying it's time some of us turn and take a little aggression out on him and give him one right to the face say i'm not going to tolerate it i'm not going to stand but i have a sword of the word i'm going to take it to your heart i'm going to quit arguing with you i'm going to quit talking to you about it but i'm going to cut down the enemy so that i can have a harvest so that my family can have joy and peace deal with the bully this morning deal with the one robbing your harvest deal with him one time put him in his place [Applause] hallelujah i'm trying to find where i was ah there it is verse seven but it came to pass that when sand balance obaya and the arabians and ammonites and the ashtonites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up they actually finished the walls and that the breaches began to be stopped in other words their ability to get to you his ability to get into your home his ability to get into your life began to get stopped up the walls began to become repaired they were very rough and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it notice when you go to repair things and get things right he's going to try to hinder you he's going to fight against you nevertheless we made our prayers unto god and set a watch against them day and night hallelujah because of them and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall and our adversary said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease and it came to pass that when the jews which dealt dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places which you shall return unto us they will be upon you therefore said i in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords and their spears and their bows and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord that's our cry this morning be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren fight for your sons and your daughters and your wives and your houses what am i telling you this morning i'm telling you to draw your sword rebuild the wall fight for your wives fight for your sons fight for your homes fight for your families and whatever you do be not afraid of them out there but remember the lord for he is great he is mighty he is terrible restore your harvest let it grow be a fruit-bearing christian but you got to build the wall back you got to be willing to take the sword and be willing to stand be willing to fight and fear not and remember the lord your god church i say fight like never before you're called to be fruit bearing christians this is called to be a fruitful church musicians can come it's time to build back the wall of protection get back into the word parents build the wall around your home quit letting your fruits be robbed brother brown says what is the fruit of the spirit joy long suffering meekness love patience kindness gentleness faith does that accompany your life he says don't be deceived we're at the end of the road friends this might be the last time you get a chance to check up better do it he says god expects fruits and when he comes i don't want him to find me like that fig tree just leaves just able to blend in look like any other tree but there's really no fruits there but he inspects it because he wants that fruit because it's for him and he comes to get some of that fruit and it's not there you can't stop today you've been called to subdue you've been called to conquer you're called to be fruitful sis you can just play something as we wind this down before we go to prayer yes the flesh is going to war against you nature is going to war against you the curse is going to war against you but greater is he that is within you and you're called today to subdue those things that portion of you that's been returned back to an eden condition we operate from there and we subdue the flesh we pull the flesh down we are to be ever subduing pushing back against the hunger of nature today i say it will not reclaim this land it will not reclaim this portion that god has given me yes the flesh is unconverted but there's a power on the inside of me subduing it pulling it down bringing it into subjection it's the last quote i want to read brother branham says that's the same way that an unbeliever or a sinner is ever laid in the presence of almighty god under the influence of the holy spirit he becomes a new creature right then his life becomes fruitful fresh life comes in and he yields what he was supposed to be a son of god he was took off the tree so was that olive branch he was took off of the tree but sinners and lukewarm church members become dry sticks with some kind of a memory that some time there was a supernatural god of the past that had life and way back there but if you believe and lay in his presence it'll produce the same thing to you you will realize that you were born sons and daughters of god and will yield the fruit of the spirit i want to be a fruit-bearing christian that's my desire this morning that's the desire of my heart lord whatever i wherever i am lord take me another step today let me push you against the currents of this age today let me push against what the world says is right let me fight for more ground let me subdue more of my greatest enemy let me bring this earth and this flesh that's been that's been cursed under subjection knowing that even one day there's been a claim not only on my soul but on this body he laid it out here and in the resurrection i'll get to living this body in a glorified condition in the eternities but to make sure i get there i want to be doing what he's called me to do i want to be producing what he's called me to produce we love you with the love of the lord we so appreciate you god bless you if there's any here that would desire prayer today we'll be glad to do so as we turn the service over to our brother amen [Music] thank you [Music] thank you let me understand lord bless you let me enjoy the word this morning amen praise the lord food for thought food for

right amen in order to gain we're going to be willing to lose one thing about this message it is a message of separation this is the message of giving all that we were comfortable with as was preached today over to god and saying okay i'm willing to let you have it and i'm willing to let you take control right i'll shun that and i'll gain this right praise the lord let's just sing it i always believe we singing the songs is not just singing the songs it's important their prayers their requests their worship and all that but we have to be careful what we what we see well we what we're confessing by singing amen are we willing to separate even more [Music] i found it all when i lost everything it gave is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and hallelujah my life [Music] for i've found it all hallelujah when i found the lord i found it all when i lost everything and gave [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] i found it all [Music] [Applause] [Music] that i've been searching [Music] when i

hallelujah hallelujah yes granted jesus granted jesus hallelujah hallelujah amen [Music] amen amen i know we sang this recently but i want to sing it again i feel the lord wants us to sing it it's uh i'm no longer a slave to fear amen i really believe that by grace as believers as we get more and more of the holy ghost more and more of god that's our desire then we get the fire of the holy spirit it will burn away you know look at that pictures one of the things that stands out was the houses with the grass on it and the trees and everything else and i the thought that struck me was the only way that that can be cleared off is by fire burning [Music] and that's that analogy comes to us as well right i mean if if there's too much on us there's too much of those weeds on us that may the fire of the holy ghost burn it off and we need more of that holy ghost in order to burn it off don't let the devil give us the weeds of fear and all and all that he can give he got lots of tools but god god has given us greater tools amen we're children of god so we claim it we step forward and we believe that we we claim the promise we have needed and let the fire of god burn off the weeds amen let's sing it you have covered me with a melody you surround me with [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah praise the lord i'm [Music] me [Music] hallelujah [Music]
