hear a tape by the prophet that we've heard before it's been a while and this was preached in 1960 and is called discernment of spirit and it was preached at Phoenix Arizona and it's it's it's a blessing because there was much there that I've underlined as much I've highlighted in the message and in going through it myself and as I said explain one time to it brother Danny Olsen's church and I said see I said the Prophet said as you read it the more we were revealed and that's the truth and I said you can take one of these books decisis messages that I have and I said it's orange and I said you take it's blue and now I said is yellow and I said is green I said that's that's the different times that I've read it and I said when I read it first time I highlighted it with maybe one color the next time another color something else struck me a man so we'll hear it again and see if there's anything else is gonna strike you a man so we prayed and brother/sister the words got a strike is every time we hear it amen that's the truth by the grace of Almighty God so god help us that it's just not hearing the letter of the word but getting into the dynamics of the revelation by the grace of God I've been struggling to determine exactly what to do and I didn't decide to play the tape until I was in my office there I was seeking the Lord as to what I should minister on of course we were going to have communion but we postponed it until our brother Chad gets back and the family from Central deferred land and and also there are other things that I was planning to have and that was the sermon that was but brother Matthew mentioned online and also a an article that our brother Alec mentioned so there's much on the list that on the agenda so let's be in prayer for one another and the grace of God be with us and I was just wondering if I should take another few thoughts on grace because I want we have preached on grace grace grace grace and but I wanted to take another thought on another subject on it to explain what is Grace we've seen the examples of it in the scripture God God given grace in the garden God into Genesis to Revelation but I was going to take Hayes take a sermon and just explain what is Grace in your life what is Grace in my life a man the grace of God and we we do have a an expression we believe that we've urged so many times on merited favor but it goes deeper than that so I wanted to want to take a message of actually lor lor willing on Grace and what is Grace amen we we see or that that was that was grace there that was grace there well this record let's recognize grace in our own lives a man this understand the depth of grace a man the revelation of grace so that we really really I tell you if you get the revelation of grace you home with you yeah you're you'll recognize and you realize that I I are absolutely nobody and I am absolutely nothing but for the grace of God amen it's not me no matter what I know no matter what I can do no matter not none of these things no no the important thing you know you know in all of our lives is Grace amen and what grace is doing God in simplicity by the grace of God amen so we'll hear the message on discernment of spirit and the Spirit says here of the by the title there's terminal spirit the spirit speaks through the Prophet amen Marcy 1960 a man I want you to turn with me to st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 24 because I want to eventually get into a message that brother Brown uses this contest exon and it's the anointed ones at the end time the anointed ones at the end time and there's tremendous you better make sure you got the right anointing on you amen because they're going to be so close who would deceive the very elect if possible so make sure you got the it's the Holy Ghost not the hähnel the ghost make sure you in Christ and not not the twin because the father of God said that the Christ and Anti Christ are so close you know it would deceive the very elect if possible but he said they're like twins in the same church so let's just make sure that we that we were worshipping Christ not Antichrist and they can be religious and and all all these things but brother sister god have mercy on us because that's why there's oh well if you're a seen of God you want me to see he'll be there to help you but if you're not seed of God you'll be deceived you go you'll give yourself over to another spirit a man oh I I'm I believe God I believe this I believe that no no no there's let's make our calling and election sure because if if it is God you it's gonna reflect the life of Jesus amen the attitude of Jesus the spirit of Jesus amen and you want to add to the word you won't take from the word grace in Matthew chapter 24 and verse 15 when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the Holy Place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house they met neither let him which is in the field returned back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days but pray that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time we're not far from that Great Tribulation now the ride doesn't go into the Great Tribulation shoe but I believe that the bride's going to experience the the introduction of it amen as it were there as there's the manna lap over in all the church ages one H - another one H - another one age to another and in the in the last age and we have believer in the bride H there's you're going you're going to see the the Great Tribulation you're going to see it being it on its way coming as try it's right so but he promised he promised us in in in the sixth search H he said I'm gonna try the world he said I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that but he said I'm not gonna let I gotta let you be there you won't be there a man he's gonna take the bride out Amen by grace but there's gonna be many there's 68 million and laid down their lives for Christianity in the last two thousand years sixty-eight million that's right now not all of them are going to be there because you can lay down your lives you can die for it but if you don't have the if you don't have divine love it's all in vain a man so we make sure that make sure that your life on the inside the inside brother that the roots of it all is divine love a man and you love him they man the grace of God brother and that by grace that will not be in the Great Tribulation but will go in the rapture by grace and again it's on merited paper you don't deserve it amen you acknowledge that it's all in Christ it's Jesus for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be what or not what a time it's going to be and brother we can see it coming I see it coming it's on its way so let's look up let's let's pray grace grace grace get into the rapture a man and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened and then if any man shall say unto you lo ears Christ or there believe it not a man this is the warning for there shall arise false Christ's or false anointed ones and false prophets false preachers and teachers and they'll show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect Amen that's how close it's going to be and he said behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you be holy is in the desert go not forth be holy as in the secret chambers believe it not a man where is he's in his word for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shine it even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be a man and this is the identification of it wheresoever the carcase is the route there will the eagle's be gathered together it is around the revealed word a man we're feeding on the word we are Eagles and eventually want to play those two messages that our brother Matthews found on the internet and concerning Eagles and he brings out the both the nature of Eagles and it was some time ago when we were on when we're on on Topsail Road there at brother at allister's place there that that I did play a DVD or whatever they had back then and I showed it to you and it was a brother talking about Eagles and what the nature of the Eagles what they do how they do it when they young when they're middle-aged when they're old how they act and so on and how the young treat the old legals a man when when when they get old do young recognize oh they're getting old so they want they want him to get strength so that they'll get they'll fly into the into the rock in the mountain a man by the grace of God see God help us that we're going we're going to add the nature of the Eagles you shall mount up with wings as Eagles by the grace of God amen and knowing that you know too that hey the Eagles can do something no other bird can do of course eagles fly higher but Eagles can fly in towards the Sun that's right not all birds could do that but the Eagles can't well why does it why can't the other birds do that because it'll blind them because of the brightness of the Sun of blinding them but with the eagle the eagle can fly into the Sun and and its eyes adjust to the brightness of the Sun and I'll keep on going if there's the if there's any other birds after it are tried to fight it it'll go into the Sun the others got too far away but they'll keep going the Bride of Christ will fly into the Sun the s always a man by the grace of God so wherever the carcasses there will the eagle's be gathered together to feed on the revealed word a man thank God so the grace of God be with us a man that was brother a mistakes as he was going into the message the anointing was at the end time we'll we'll get to that but we're going to go air him Minister on discernment of spirit March 1960 a man they stand for a word of Prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for grace we thank you Lord for Amazing Grace Lord it is amazing Lord that grace is extended to me into my brothers and sisters born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speak in lies we thank you for grace that got ahold of us to turn us back so grace Oh Lord that will submit to the leadership of your grace and your mercy in our lives father as we go into the word father of your servant the Prophet this morning we pray Lord the anointing of the Holy Ghost that we're going to catch what's there for us Lord there's there's a word there for every brother and sister in this assembly there's a word their Lord for every one that will maybe hear the DVD or be online in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray for that conviction of the Holy Ghost father please help us Lord that we'll have that anointing of the Holy Ghost Christ in us the life of your blood in us Lord father because Lord we need it to discern right spirits and wrong spirits we need it to discern leadership so that we're going to be led by the Holy Spirit and not the Hanalei Spirit we want to be led Lord by the Spirit of Christ not the spirit of the Antichrist so grace - so hard to let go and let God have is way not my real father thine be done she'll be with us Lord as we go in to this message on discernment if there's anything the Lord that we need in this our Father is discernment father that's that's the anointing the gift of the Holy Ghost father father that will help the bride so that she will not be deceived father though it would so closer would deceive the very elect if possible well we trust by grace and the word God Lord that isn't that the very elect will not be deceit because of your presence because a father of our subjection to your anointing amen we're giving ourselves over to you so be with us we pray and lead us O God by your your anointing by your word hallelujah by the grace of God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ bless us father for your glory your honor and your praise amen in Jesus name Amen god bless you and pray the grace of God that God will answer our brother Matthew's prayer concerning those that are sick amen and just consider to the hour we're living that it is so bad if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved that's how bad it's getting amen so we pray grace brother that that will be saved amen Lord bless you again the message is [Music] press if I can this morning how in my heart I filled towards one the holiest of holy coming down to the earth and to redeem a sinner like myself and I'm sure that these ministers it's present now can feel the same way that it was by your grace that we have been made the ministers of this covenant that thou has given with Adam's fallen race and we are here this morning father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know rather the will of God and what we must do to make Christ real to the people of this generation knowing surely that in the day of the judgement we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their eternal destination therefore Lord in that day we would be a judge for our against the generation that we preached to father God please do Jesus name let us not say one word that would be wrong but may we have sincere hearts and open minds that we might receive the things that's yours that we might be able to go out into our different fields of work after today and and be better equipped because of our meeting with you this morning Granite Lord won't you come and be our speaker and our ears and our tongue and our thoughts let the meditation my heart thoughts in my mind all that is within me and within these my brethren and sisters may it be acceptable in thy sight Lord that we might be so filled in charge with our spirit of your present shear that the room would become the room not so much the building that we are sitting in but the building that we are living in become altogether a cloud of the glory of God we might leave here this morning so filled with the Holy Spirit that we would be more determined than ever before in life to carry the message to the dying generation that we're living in here is Lord and speak to us through that word far we asked it in the name of the son and our Savior Jesus Christ amen I wish to read this morning a portion of Scripture found in the Psalms the hundred and fift son I wish to read just a potion you that keeps down these Scripture readings I see many of them in bent we're ministers and so forth it's good to read the word and now of time today Thank You Psalms 105 oh give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people sing unto him saying psalms unto him talky of all his wondrous works glory in his holy name let the hearts of them rejoice that seek the Lord seek the Lord and his strength seek his face evermore remember his marvelous works that he has done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth o ye seed of Abraham his servants eat children of Jacob is chosen he is the Lord our God his judgments are in all the earth he has remembered his covenant forever the words which he commanded to a thousand generations which covet he made with Abraham and is old unta dyzee and confirmed the same into Jacob for a law and the Israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few man in number yay very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved Kings father's sake saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm may the Lord bless the reading of his words I have a few scriptures written out here somewhere that I was going to refer to perhaps along the road I wonder today who's going to be the next president the elections coming up you know who's going to be President this next turn what if I knew there's only one that does know and that's God and what if God would reveal to me who's going to be the next president and I stood here in Phoenix and made a prediction that such-and-such a man would be the next president of the United States and they would place that in papers and so forth and I would hit it right on the dot it would be perfect and it would be all that I had said would come to pass but what good would it do what good is it anyhow if I if I should do such a thing the papers would advertise it and it would go out maybe if such a person could make such a prediction and it would be true all the newspapers and magazines would would pass on it but you know that God doesn't do things like that God doesn't use his power and his gifts for foolishness it's going to be whatever's president it'll be president and to know now which would be president wouldn't help us one penny it wouldn't do us one bit of good to know who's going to be President so therefore God doesn't do those things like that and then if I made such a prediction as that and it come to pass and the newspapers packed it and the magazines then it would be to my glory people would say look what a great prophet brother Branham is he told us long before it happened just who would be President and that would be to my glory but God doesn't want he's not interested in working things to my glory or to to any other man's glory he's interested to work things to his glory something that will profit like Paul said if we speak with tongues and do not have an interpreter what good does it do we only glory for ourselves and that's ready by ourselves that's counting out of the line for God God wants to be edified himself and we're not seek self edification but to edify God with all we do so therefore I believe this morning if I knew who he would be and exactly when he would be elected and all how many votes he'd be over under or whatever it might be it wouldn't do one bit of good to tell it it'd be best for me just to keep it still if I did know it not try to publish it because there would be there would be no reason for me to do it cause it's going to be anyhow and it doesn't make us that much difference who's going to be President but God when he uses his gifts he uses them for his own glory and for the glory of his people for the glory of his church for the edifying of the body of Christ and for the glory of the kingdom of God that's why he gives these things in his church why ask teachers prophets evangelist pastors they are for the edification of the church and for the glory of God the Prophet is not to get out and mingle with the world and try to take a gift like Balaam did and make havoc our our money out of it or something if he's a prophet he's supposed to reveal God to the church and stay out of the things of the world it's all for the glory of God now we do have and I think it's a good thing for us as ministers the father are our when we see such things in the world as we see today and we have an order from God is for the discerning of spirits trying the spirit I believe that that is a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of the spirit I do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to or by the group that they are assembled with whether they be Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal are or whatever they are we should never judge the man by the denomination that he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has the spirit whether he's a Lateran or far marine or inner outer rain or no rain or whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his Spirit we are to discern spirits watch what the man has in mind what he has what he's trying to if the man buy a gift no matter how great the gift is now I want to get this to the church this morning which into the different denominations you are still the Church of the Living God together and this is the thing I want to get to you see that we are really not divided we are the stones that's cut in different forms all to the glory of God now there is so much in the day that we live in pertaining to gifts so many people judge people by gifts that they have well I believe that these things are gifts I believe that what we see take place is gifts and their god-given gifts but we if we do not use them in the right way that God intended them to be used then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts the other night I made a statement at the pulpit saying this that I would rather see brotherly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else we must know what these things are far now if a man comes and he has a great gift no matter if he belongs to our denomination or another denomination don't judge him but what denomination he come from how he dresses but what you want to see is what he's trying to do with that gift what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it I'd have discernment of spirit up to know that's wrong no matter how greater teacher he is how powerful he is how intellectual he is or how his give operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment would tell you that that's wrong no matter how actor how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ to achieve something maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with a great intellectual or a spiritual power that he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take that gift and make yourself famous so do you have a big name so that other brethren will look up to him is some big person then that's wrong maybe he's trying to to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody else to get out of the picture let him and his group be the picture that's still wrong but if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ then I don't care what he belongs to you're not discerning the man you're discerning the spirit the life that's in the man and that's what God told us to do not one time was we ever Commission to discern that the man's group but we was constrained I'm commanded by God to discern the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to and then if we can find out that he's trying to lead the people not to break them up but to bring them together and to bring the Church of the Living God not all to one denomination but to a understanding a fellowship a unity of spirit then if he is far marine or Lateran or whatever it is his spirit and he is purpose is right and the spirit that's any no matter what movie belongs to the spirit that's in him is trying to part the people to Calvary away from himself or away from anything else but is only achievement he has is to part them to Calvary he doesn't care whether he's even knowed or not he doesn't care whether he's even his own movement which is fine see it's good if he is a Methodist or a Presbyterian or a Roman Catholic or whatever he wants to be by denomination but what is he trying to do the purpose of his heart that he's trying to get then you can see what's in the man's life whether his motives as far as his denomination whether it's for yourself well there's far worthy fame whether it's for big names to say I predicted that come just exactly the path now I see that's wrong right there to begin with but if he's trying to use what gods give him as a teacher as a prophet as the seer a new testament prophet is a preacher we all know that just any minister that's a preacher is a prophet a New Testament prophet if he's prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself to make a big name or to edify his organization which he should be in an organization Here I am without one but yet preaching you should be that's right every man or to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your time and somewhere that you help support the cause take your choice but then don't never just fellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group see discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you got fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of Christ I think that is absolutely true now if we will notice the motives and objectives of the old Testament prophets damn man had one objective that was Jesus Christ they had one thing that their whole theme of the Old Testament was built around the coming Messiah they they did not go out and do things just for money or for fame they had one thing they were anointed with the Spirit of God and they predicted the coming Messiah and those men were so anointed with the spirit until they sometimes acted like the spirit that was within them they spoke seemingly all themselves watch how the Spirit of God made that man act will take for instance Moses the great prophet how that that man had no selfish objectives at all he could have been the king of Egypt he could have had the world under his feet but because that he was a prophet at heart he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the persecution and the trials of Christ esteeming the treasures of heaven greater treasures than them of Egypt he forsook and denied himself other worldly fame of the luxury and the things that Life offers he had to look beyond that see he could have been that just take the minister today if he has the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he knows that if he preaches that word it's going to cut his pain down it's going to put him in a little bitty church somewhere or maybe out on the street but he knows that something in his heart is he sees the coming of the Lord he doesn't care whether that he has a big church our little church he doesn't care whether he has today's food are not no food he doesn't care whether he has good closure doesn't have good clothes he's only a mindful of one thing and that's the very life with any crying out he's trying to achieve something for the glory of God and that man in doing so will act the very life of the Spirit that's any do you follow me he'll act it out look at Moses when it come to a time that he displayed all his life was the Spirit of Christ but Christ was any Christ was in Moses by measure now if we notice he was born in the time of persecution the children was killed to try to get him just exactly like they did Jesus and we find out that when it come to a place that the children of Israel had disobeyed in such a way until God was angry with them and he said to Moses step aside and I'll destroy the whole group of them and I'll take of you and raise up another generation Moses truest self in the path of God's judgment said take me before you take them in other words before you can get them you'll have to come over me that's exactly what Jesus Christ did when God would have wept the whole face of the earth off with these sinners you and i but Christ do yourself in the path the God could not do it he couldn't come over his own son and when God seen that spirit in Moses hanging in the judgment like a cross oh you can't come to him you'll have to take me first see the Spirit of God and Moses when he could been king of Egypt when he could have had every luxury in the world to be popular when he could have been the great king of the world at that time but he chose to suffer the persecutions and the affliction for he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures and that of Egypt see he through his self in a way why it was God in Moses did that the normal thinking if directional man would never do that he would take the easy road so no matter how much of fanatic Moses seemed to be he was trying you see he was a true prophet of God because he was trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God now with his great gift of prophecy he might have been a wise man could have stood up in Egypt and said now wait our prophesy so and so I'll say so and so and as with his prophecy but it's and all you'd have been world famous but if that wasn't in his heart it couldn't be in his heart so if you see a person with a great gift trying to do something to glorify themselves your own discernment of the Spirit tells you that's wrong but Moses was trying to achieve something for the glory of God no matter how bad it was how evil it looked how much it was talked about the spirit in Moses directed him straight to the line of duty the spirit in him look at Joseph Joseph was when he was born he was loved of the Father and hated by his brethren perfect type of Christ and the only one to them the same father but the reason his brother hated him was about a cause because God had made him a prophet spiritual a seer and they hated him for that very purpose but Joseph could not help it because God had made him that way and what's the spirit of God in Joseph watch what he did he even acted the part of Christ he was hated of his brethren loved Darby's father because all the spirit made the difference he was a spiritual man he saw visions he interpreted dreams he did not do it for his own glory he did it because I was something in him the Spirit of God he wouldn't went out there by his own self and I've been throwing him to a ditch and have his poor old father to grieve all those years sold for nearly 30 pieces of silver taken up from the ditch and became the right-hand man of Pharaoh the king of earth at that time and in his prison house there was a butler and a baker and one was lost and the other was saved by his prediction in the prison house I did you notice Jesus when he came he was loved of the Father and the father gave Joseph a coat of many colors the rainbow a covenant and the Father God gave His Son Jesus the and then the Jewish brother hated him without a cause he had no reason to hate him he was spiritual and he was God's Word made manifest he come to do the will of the Father he come to fulfill the Scriptures he came to bring them peace but they misunderstood him and hated him without a cause they didn't stop to try to see what he was trying to achieve they just judged him because it he didn't agree with them they may he makes his self so and soul he makes himself God he was God God was in him the Bible said God was in Christ manifested himself to the world he was the god of glory manifesting the glory of God look at Moses he couldn't help throwing himself there he didn't do that hypocritically he did it because God was in him neither could Joseph help being what he was because it was God in him working or displaying himself through the man never did he do it for self glory any man that if those priests would only had the discernment of spirit as I'm speaking to you this morning regardless of how much the world talked about him they still would have known if they don't look to the word if they were seeing his purpose he was always doing that to glorify the father he said they said all this man's a great healer he does these things like that he said I can do nothing till the father shows me it is not me that doeth the works it's the father and that dwelleth in me he doeth the works never tucked the glory neither would any servant of God take glory neither would any servant of God take a gift of God and try to glorify himself or anything else but is Right achievement is to do something to the glory of God that's why I see the same thing today we must have discernment of spirits to see a person what they're trying to do or are they trying to glorify God or they're trying to glorify themselves now the Spirit of God working in man makes man act like God no wonder jesus said is not it written ye are gods and if they call them gods to whom the Spirit of God came to how can you condemn me that when I am the son of God if you could see the Spirit of God in Moses which he was gone Moses was a God Joseph was a God the prophets were gods the Bible said they were they were gods because they had completely surrendered themselves to the Spirit of God that they were working for the glory of God and when a man is so anointed with the spirit I'll let this go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side when a man is anointed of the Spirit of God his habits his actions and everything is God moving in him sometimes he's misjudged look at David in the 23rd psalm he cried my God my God why has thou forsaken me as if he was if David was the man all they that passed me by shoot to lip out at me he was so anointed with God he was so perfectly surrendered to God and the nor demons own even such a way are when he cried by the Spirit of God if somebody been standing there see why look he thinks somebody shoot her lip out of him why is God forsaken him it wasn't David he was a spirit crying out to David my God my God why has thou forsaken me my booms all stare at me they have pierced my hands and my feet well somebody said listen that hypocrite up there whose hands is pierced whose feed his Pierce that's the intellectual but one who had discernment of spirit knew that that was a Spirit of God him him crying out the Spirit of God he's got the action of God and the action of God is never to break us up the action of God is to draw us together for we are one in Christ Jesus and God's purpose is to bring us together love one another now that great prophets we see the spirit moving in them Jesus called them gods he said they were God now when the spirit come to them by measure but when he come on the one Jesus which was the son of God it come to him without measure the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him for he was the perfect example he was God of glory manifesting the glory of God to the people God in him going about watch his life all the Old Testament he was the theme of the Old Testament all the old prophets back in the Old Testament cried out not to themselves they cried out there the Spirit of God making an act like God in so much that they were called gods and then if the fullness of that spirit was manifested in Jesus Christ look at David when he was dethroned as the king of rejected by his own people going up mount Olive's north to jerusalem and he looked back over the city and wept because he was rejected what was it it was a spirit of Christ 500 years later the son of David Jesus said on the same mount looking over the city as a rejected King in credit Jerusalem what I have gathered you your different denominations and everything as a hen does her brood but you would not how offered I have did it now the same spirit that was in David that was manifested and fullness in Christ is in the church today crying to the peoples how would I have gathered you and when you see separations and and differences and and Brotherhood broken up and Christian life one against the other then it makes the Spirit of God in your heart proud you're trying to achieve something a true prophet of God a true teacher is trying to bring the church to a unity of spirit a unity of spirit that they might recognize God trying to achieve it no matter what denomination they belong to you or what about it we have discernment of spirit to discern the spirit that's in the man to see if it be the spirit of God or not now we noticed when he was here on earth how you went about doing good I noticed another thing had come to my mind did you notice when David was rejected as king he went out of the city and a little Benjamin mind Benjamin which was posed to have been a brother to him should have been sorry because he was rejected but what he was a crippled man and he drug along there with his crippled condition throwing dirt on David and calling him all kinds of bad names and cursing him in the name of the Lord cursing King David in the name of the Lord this little crippled up Benjamite what's the spirit of God in the spirit that ever working now if you notice he was crippled it represents the spiritual crippled nasaw the people today that would make fun of the true spirit of God in Christ manifesting itself that was a spirit of Christ and David being rejected as a king and today when the people make fun of the people who has received the Holy Spirit and trying to achieve something at all Methodists and Pentecostals and Baptists and Pentecostals and Presbyterians and all together as a unity as a body of Christ and they see the spirit where you say why look at the Pentecostal away with me I'm a one run off with another man's wife I know this and got drunk I know this who did this I know this and did that all that but they were big enough to hide their own things they can hide it but David was exposed why he had the Spirit of Christ in him that guard said shall I take the head of that dog that would curse my king what's the spirit of Christ and David let him alone for the Lord has told him to curse me the Lord has told him to curse me instead today we don't get up our fists and fighting chop his head off get him out he don't blowing us let him home the Lord has told him to curse me that little run longer throwing dirt on David that's what they do today on the Spirit of Christ they're a bunch of holy rollers but they're a bunch of this there's nothing to him to divine healing there's no such a thing as angels there's no such a thing as prophets all those things of days and miracles is past throw a dart but let alone but when David returned in power when he come back that was full king of Israel don't worry this Jesus whose Spirit we have today act in his part will return again in a physical body second time and glory and power and Majesty that little dirt thrower fell on his face and beg for mercy let him alone the Spirit of Christ in us don't excommunicating let's remember that all these things has got to come to pass we've got one thing to do move on God promised that he'd make everything work together for good to them at loving let's keep the discernment of spirit keep the objective right we're here to serve God each one fellowshipping going along and serving God if the man's got the wrong kind of am ejective then what will happen see now we find out that the Spirit of God was in him all the old prophets spoke of him all the spirits in potion ever little potion wasn't glorifying itself through prophets all the true prophets was manifesting him speaking of him and everything they said was fulfilled in him showed it was the Spirit of God in them it was fulfilled what was it God speaking of himself see God manifesting himself through these prophets not taking glory who will be the next president who will be this and hit you own head tell us you itching will believe you 10 isn't it it's something to manifest God it isn't something to make brother weathers here our brother chores or brother so-and-so out there a great man make him a greater than the rest and of his group making the greatest man in Phoenix is to make William Branham something great but what is to do it is to make or Robert something great mini-green something great but it's a heart we're trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God it's manifesting God all gifts and things doesn't make one greater than the other it just makes us all working together for the perfection of the body that bring us together as one people as a people of God but when you see them going contrary don't curse them Oh somebody has to do it but wait till Jesus comes in power now we see all those prophets peeking every one of them was glorifying God and the coming Messiah and when they got in the spirit they acted and spoke and live the life out just like the Messiah did if it did that side the cross speaking obvious coming how much more will it after his coming will put the Spirit of Messiah in the church to do work and live like the Messiah it's a Spirit of God discern that spirit see whether it is of God or not see whether it acts like you see if your emotions if somebody kicks up something issue of throws dirt upon your life when you know you're as innocent as you can be and you know if you've got the Spirit of God don't chop it separate yourself don't try to act mean towards him don't curse them just walk on or your God did that to give you a test to see how you take it he'll have to come to it anyhow as I said the other day I believe it brother Fuller's Church the bicycle rider in Canada wall I'm tall take it out ride this boy this little old and he's the only one couldn't hurry without holding the handlebars I'm glad I like to be well no handlebar riders take a hold of both sides of the cross and say nothing in my arms I brainy let me hold to the cross Lord I have no internet shows I had nothing let me just hold here look way out yonder and he had a 12 inch plank my first city bump to get $100 swing bicycle all those boys you could arrive without holding go downtown get their mothers groceries and come back without even touch the handlebars they ever want to begin to look they wasn't used to holding to the hand of ours and they fell off but this little little boy got on there and helped the handlebars and ruled it to the end they asked him so how did you do it he says here's where you make your mistake fellas you're all better riders than I am but you were looking here and said makes you nervous to see what is trying to balance yourself and you fellow said I never looked here at all I'll watch the end and it's kept steady that's what we're to do don't look at these little things now did this one do this or that one do that what's the N and keep studying Christ is coming watch the end just keep steady don't notice what's going on now watch what's going to go on out down there at the end time when we're gonna have to stand and give an account for alive David wasn't watching that the little Benjamite throw dirt on his anyhow he never knows him he wouldn't he met the guard cut his head off the day my own God told him to do that God told him to curse me let him alone or David knew that Sunday he was returning in power that Benjamin did have his time yes that's it the church will rise a triumph I was just sent to pray for a sick children anyhow that's all I can do wherever they are in what church the art makes me no difference I'm trying to pray for his sick children trying to manifest a gift for his glory that's reason I never did belong to anything now remember that's alright see I'm not I'm not saying that now I won't you get to clear up even God's got Christians in ever Church his children he's never questioned me on that I just sent to pray for the children and to do these things and to manifest him now you see Jesus and these prophets everything that they spoke of had to be true for it was the power of God in them God Himself speaking through them of his own self coming to his own glory who's president who's gonna is they go to we're gonna have enough rain this year I don't mean nothing something to the glory of God something to set the church in order something for the power of God not to make yourself a name but to make the glory of God manifested now we noticed that all those prophets and all they said about him everything come to true because he was the theme of the Old Testament Jesus the Messiah coming Messiah was what every prophet looked from from Adam to my malachi every prophet spoke of the coming of the Lord each one putties party because he was anointed of God that's all he could speak of now wish we had more time on but watch everything that they said come to pass lookie here let's just take some of the things to the prophets that a virgin shall conceive and bear a child did it happen sure his name shall be called Emmanuel Prince of Peace mighty God everlasting father that's what he was exactly the everlasting father no man should be called father on this earth but God is your father all right now let's see again he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the Chaston fire peace upon him with his stripes we were healed pilot's judgment Hall while the very man having his back blanks life get with a cation tailwhip didn't realize it the scripture said it would be that way they didn't have the sermon of spirit those priests you said away with him away with him and on the cross when he shot out their lips and things like that when he heard him crying my god Wow forsake me they didn't have discernment he they couldn't discern the spirit that's what David was speaking of in the twenty second sound they shot out their lip not knowing they were doing it just the same as that Benjamite did to David see he thought David is all wrong cause they didn't agree with him on his principles of running extinct him he didn't understand that it was the Spirit of God in David doing him that's where we must deserve today the spirit of the man what's he trying to do what getting it not what group he belongs to or what this that or the other well there's a white man black man yellow man or whatever he is let's see what he's trying to achieve and take that see what he's trying to do for the kingdom of God he's got our ideas to ours that's perfectly all right if he's trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God discerned that any if he's wrong and true in heart God would bring him around to the truth of the thing after a while let him alone they won't see what he's trying to do now we see here then we find out anything his death when he died at the cross and crying all the things the prophets spoke of him they pierced my hands and my feet there it was fulfilled the prophets is right they thought it was themselves or cried like it was himself but it was manifested in the cross he he was numbered with the transgressors that's what he was done he was with the transgressors in his death he made his bearer with the rich he did he was buried in a rich man's grave I will not leave his soul he will not leave my soul said David the Spirit of God in David speaking out he will not leave my soul in Hell neither will he suffer his Holy One to see corruption like as if David would be the holy one wasn't David it was the Spirit of God and David crying out see the Spirit of God in the man crying out some of them said listen that old hypocrite up there he wasn't it was a spirit of god in him crying out see the Spirit of God manifests itself not leave his soul in Hell neither go to suffer my Holy One to see corruption now brethren and closing may I say this our time gets away but look may I say this in closing but these scriptures here let's see if a man that all the Old Testament theme was about him all the holy prophets anointed with God's Spirit if all that in everything that they said was fulfilled to the letter exactly in him surely that great person called the Son of God ought to know how to set up the New Testament church don't you believe that he ought to have a conception to know how to set up the New Testament church the first thing I want to call your attention over here in Matthew sixteenth chapter that when he is speaking there when he come down was talking to the disciples he said who does man say I the Son of Man am and they said some say your lives and some say your so and so and some say your sewing sewing like that different one he said but who do you say that I am and Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he said blessed art thou simon son of jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed its you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and i say in any of the art Simon or art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it now there were speaking of the church now watch closely and if I'm wrong God forgive me and you forgive me now the Catholic Church says that that was a stone lay in there Peter and upon Peter he built the church now we know that that's wrong we Protestants disagree with it but we Protestant says it was himself that he built himself a church upon himself but if you'll notice I want to disagree with that friendly it wasn't that it was up on the spiritual revelation of himself flesh and blood you never learned this in a seminary as good as they are you never learned this for some church Creed as good as it is it's alright but flesh and blood has not revealed this to you it's not an intellectual conception of how you make your speech how you must bow yourself how what great thing you must do here in earth that isn't what it is it isn't build a great thing or do a great thing what it is is a revelation of the Word of God he was the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the Word was God and the Word was made manifest and dwelt among us he was that was the revelation of the Word of God the spirit in Pete revealing by spiritual revelation that he was the son of God made manifest the god of glory manifesting the glory of God upon this rock spiritual revelation of the word I'll build my church why if them prophets was under God speaking by the Holy Spirit that that was the son of God the same spirit on this side reveals right back the same thing you see it flesh and blood you can't learn it in a seminary you learn your get your deed in your PhD in L hear that was alright what you had it that's right but still that's not it you don't have to have it yet it's good to have it you can be this plus but if you have to rub out the plus take this this is that if they say that this flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learned through the educational line you never learn it through denominational lines they're fine education denominations find that's part of it but people are leave too much to that and they're leaving the spiritual discernment' the flesh and blood has not revealed this youth but my father which is in heaven has reveal this to you and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell keeper veil against it we'll never be able to prevail show they would be against it now watch and see where the gates of hell is against it against to the denomination the government recognizes that it is the world recognizes our denominations all of them we have the rights each one of us as American citizens we have the rights of denomination which is fine we appreciate that but that's not what the gates of Hale's against it's against the spiritual revelation of Christ be [Music] that's what it's against the gates of hell shall be against it but it shall never prevail there you are spiritual discernment regardless of who it is is my brother as long as he's trying to achieve the same purpose that I'm working for let it be profit let it be pasture let it be deacon let it be so and so let God honor in this way that way whatever it is this army whatever he wants to do but yet that's my brother we're working for the same thing we're standing ark all of our works into the same kingdom yonder he's working for the same thing I am spiritual discernment spiritual revelation of God lookie here if you want Jesus I've preached the other night somewhere baby down there it wasn't so from the beginning we have to go back to the beginning to find our text now for just a moment at the beginning that was keen intellectual build a fine church we would say made a fine altar offered up a sacrifice prayed sincere gave thanks paid his ties everything just as religious is able us but Abel there was no Bible in their days but my spiritual revelation he's seen that it wasn't fruits of the field that caused us to sin it wasn't apples that to eat see it wasn't apples revelation totally net and it wasn't the fruits that caused him to come out of there it was life the separation of life so he went and got a lamb and offered it in his stead by faith which this spiritual revelation the revelation of God spiritual revelation it was revealed to him it is in the fruit it is Annapolis it isn't peaches plums and pears it was a separation of life so he went to God alive and offered it instead of fruits fruits is what your works on your own hand what you do that I'll go and fill this I'll go do this I'll support that it's good he had an all reduced the same as the other did both of them had always that was good but it was a real spiritual reveal truth of the thing for the Spirit of God revealed it Nepal that rock the rock that Christ died on the rock of ages' upon the rock that Abel's lamp I don't little Abel as he put his hands upon that little lamb and it's a little white wool being bathed as he took a rock they didn't have a lance in that day and chopped this little neck like gotten hammered it in the poor little thang dying the blood bathing his hands and his little wool old baby was bloody Laden he crying what did his speak oh the Lamb of God some four thousand years later spiritually revealed the church turning him down one of the people call him Beelzebub and a devil because all the prophets have spoke out they denied the prophets always said you build their sufferers and you put them in there you wanted walls he said to them without spiritual discernment not knowing that that was the Lamb of God that he was supposed to be that way and act that way because he was fulfilling the Word of God and the Holy Ghost church today acting the way that you doing the things they knew they're fulfilling the world see Peter said on the day of Pentecost this is that and he said it's into you into your children and then it's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call them same inspired prophet said the evening light would shine there'd be a farmer and latter rain together as in the base of grace looking here what is it the farmer is coming over and the latter rain is past you then it slapped over it's together the farmer latter rain together the Holy Spirit made manifest by the power in the resurrection of Jesus Christ Terry you are coming together the farmer God's grace he said as it was the days of Noah His grace is long-suffering here in yesterday long-suffering a lap over brains the cloud from the old days the clouds witnessed stay together the farmer rain run in first the first rain we've had now here comes the latter incoming over the farmer II coming over the latter II east and west meeting together both reins falling together divine healing plus the angel of God revealing the secrets of our hearts and bringing everything to pass who look like true part children if I could see that there you are the spirit revealing revelation that's what Jesus said the church would be built upon well then somebody might raise up and say well sure we saw and so we're going up on that let's take his word a little farther the last Commission to his church he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature all the world how long is the last all the world to how many ever creature he that believeth and is baptized not the church he's a personal pronoun he that believeth the individual is David your place has said about the grandchildren there's no grandchildren in the kingdom of God it's John your father was Pentecostal and you're just coming here to this church because he come here to the des lebens and Garfield received the Holy Ghost this brought you in as a grandchild you're around Bob's got to reveal himself to you and no man could call Jesus a Christ by intellectual conceptions no man because Jesus of Christ because he feel sorry for his sins and comes to repent no man can call Jesus Christ only powdery revelation or the Holy Ghost my church and the gates of hell there it is what he's built his church upon who did it Peter no no no who did it Christ said the revelation of God the Holy Spirit would bring it to you a little while and I'll leave you but I'll pray the Father and he'll send you the comforter will bring these things to your remembrance is that right what he's doing this morning and we're what show you things to come Holy Spirit in the church and the way stage now you say brother hallelujah that's my church wait a minute Jesus said this will all man know you're my disciples in st. John 13:35 this will all man know you're my disciples when you have loved one far the other the Spirit revealed truth of the kingdom of God to come looking out to the in utter seen what the prophets cried about see what Jesus spoke about and you're the same Holy Spirit in you crying right back that's right that's right what is it the spiritual reveal truth I love my brother regardless of where they go to church or their former ladder and no rain at all as long as they're in the body of Christ trying to achieve not something for a certain purpose to manifest yourself on earth but the purpose for the kingdom of God and the glory of is coming to reveal and make knowing his soon appearing now in closing we want to think of this I've owned this rock I'll build my church correctly and then we find out over in John 14 seven he said this the works that I do shall you do also the works that I do what kind of works did he do to make yourself known you remember about Peter don't you what we've been talking about Philip the woman at the well predicted it not to go to the Gentiles but would be in the last days as I said is it one of the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man there's a revelation written in mysteries like this to the outside world to the world it knows about but you precious brethren you precious sisters you are not children of the darkness you're not children of the night but you're children of the light walking in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ God's Son cleanses all our sins from all of us there you are the servants of the Lord Jesus is a quote with scripture on here got mark 16 yes mark 16 he said go ye into all the world here's what kind of church he set up the last Commission to the church going into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not I'll be damned now look here look at the spiritual desert he that believeth and is baptized you never exactly say which way but we want to fuss about that see the other thing say he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved whatever he wants to be baptized that's up to him if his achievements for the kingdom of God come on brother we're marching on with the same spirit if I'm wrong then you tell it'll come out that way if you're wrong gonna be that but our hearts and our motives and our objectives is for the kingdom of God you honor the honor we are we're apart into Calvary me and my ideas why I got a brother likes cherry pie as well as I do but we're brothers see none of nice to hunt and fish like I do but we're brothers he what I mean I got my own ideas but that don't make him not my brother his father's my father his families my family there you are the patriarchs all different one from another but there was one father and this should work to one thing and they rejected the main one in there because he was spiritual don't you see it brethren can't you see what I'm speaking of now notice we're closing go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues what is spiritual revelation they shall speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things that shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that was what the new church was that's the kind of Church of Jesus Christ this great one and all the prophets cried out what do we find his spirit comes over here and predicted his spirit and the people come right back and do the things that he did Mayock clothes wasn't saying this I got about a dozen more scriptures here but we haven't got the time the but listen to this may I close and saying this ever true barn again prophet of the Lord preacher Sunday school teacher seer apostle missionary whatever he might be his whole heart is set and he's so filled and anointed with the Spirit of God so anointed whatever his office is whatever it might be to preach are to teach are to analyze our to see visions whatever it is he'll do it for the kingdom of God and the Spirit of God will speak right back to the man and manifest it's the kingdom of God then we me as a Baptists I see you Pentecostals you're my brother you don't run to Baptist Church I did that's what we church ever did blown too as a Baptist Church but they don't stand in my way I see what the Spirit of God is with you I'll see what you're trying to do well if me a Baptist can feel that way surely the families the Church of God the United Pentecostals the independence and all of us brethren together ought to see that we're trying to work for one purpose let's have spiritual discernment now listen and closing I'll make this last remark many are sick and weakly among you and many are asleep spiritually dead because they don't have discernment of the body of Christ this sick body that we got god help us to have spiritual discernment of that revelation of the kingdom of God and now the love of God in our hearts shed abroad by the Holy Ghost to try to put our arms way out say we are brother so you ought to mean and every little gift that you have don't use it to try to make it some great something for ourselves let's make it for the kingdom of God to work with everyone to try to uplift the cause of Jesus Christ for his coming is soon do you believe it I'm so sorry to keep you so long brother David will be here tomorrow to teach you the scriptures but right now let's bow our heads just a moment [Music] Liyana of the cheetah Bay Area we are not a political movement is the Bootsy Collins booyah [Music] [Music] onward Christian soldier hey man as I said there was something there for every one of us because if there's anything that we need is the discernment of spirits because there are so many spirits that have gone forth into the world amen Satan has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short and with Satan comes many of his angels a man and remember that there's there's thousands of thousands of thousands that are loosed out of the bottomless pit are loosed out of their deliverer rather it's mentioned there in the book of Revelation that's why we're seeing what we're seeing we're seeing less of God when it comes to the anointing and the gifts of the Spirit what God has done down to the church ages and what God has done down to the last six thousand years we're seeing less and less of that and we sense less and less of that we feel less and less of it but we are seeing and feeling more and more of the evil spirits a man it's and it's not light its darkness amen that's why as whyever the darkness is covering the earth darkness is overcoming and taking control because because Satan has come down with great wrath but the grace of God is there just for the elect that is and it's very very few it's not as the prophet of God as prophesied after the opening of the word as he saw people getting less and less spiritual and more and more religious but not spiritual and he began to highlight the fact that he said there's gonna be very very few living Saints going the rapture I believe that as it was in the days of Noah well we say Noah and was just Noah and it's his family they were eight that went into the ark out of maybe eight million and but we can go back before Noah and there was Enoch that went into rapture a man Noah went in an ark but he not when interruption so he was just one but he knew what was coming concerning it - that's you and me I trust that we are we are it represented an Enoch but we are pointing to the days of Noah a man where there's a Great Tribulation coming and brother that's what it was when God when God did what he did upon the earth and he covered the earth with water a mad and just think that ever everything was was killed everything was drowned everything was lost except Noah and those that were in the ark that's the truth and even even after the flood there was remember serpent seed didn't come through the ark did comes through the flood India and there was a member of David's family that God cursed and God separated and and cast them away and so on so that was for that spirit would come right on down through the hour that you and I are living so there's more serpents eat and there's very little seed of God in the earth and as the problem of God as highlighted he said there might be a thousand it might be seven hundred there might be five hundred and he said there might be three hundred and as that sister told him about you know how many is going in the rapture he said well if God told me to go and pick out as this this and this for the rapture he said he said he feel bad because he's a he said I don't yeah I might might find a dozen because he was seeing less the people were less and less and less spiritual they had didn't never had only ghost discernment a man to discern what was right to discern what was wrong no no no my brother's sister we got to have that we got to have spiritual discernment not just it when it comes to the word the truth they said oh my Satan Satan is going Satan is preaching the truth saving it will give it to you 99% of it or as I said a hundred and ten percent Allah or five percent he'll add to it or you take away a word or add a word a man but as how deceiving the world is right now religiously and as and has gotten that way even around the message so I see as time goes on and I see the world getting darker and darker and darker I see Satan taking more and more more more control and he's got more and more influence upon the people and his spirits and all the spirits that have been loosed out of the head of the waters is there in the book of Revelation a man so the grace of God that he has he's got a rapture for is see just an editor who only gonna be a few but he'll rapture us before before the whole world comes under Satan's control a man so we're looking for the grace of God in it it's just it's serious but the thing of it is believers think I'm a believer so I'm gonna in rapture you got it you got it you got to be determined that make your calling and election sure by the grace of God a man and now I I didn't go through this message before I played it today I I bet I don't know I guess it was the Holy Spirit that caused me to just to I I had some message there I took looked at that one I took that one and I put it in my briefcase not knowing exactly what I was going to do with it I maybe just just quote from it but this as I got into the office here at the Lord laid on my heart to play the tape now I know why after hearing it again now I know why a man's because as I said we did play it before but there was something there for every one of us and if you got a if you've got a copy of it verbally go listen to it again if you got a copy of it in in a book form go to read it here or on the internet whatever and and see what God wants to reveal to you in this message on discernment of Spirit because if there's anything we need in this day an hour is a discernment of spirit what spirit is influencing me why spirit is influencing you what and the thing of it is not just influenced what spirit is controlling you is controlling me and many people think oh I'm under the Spirit of God and they're under the spear of the devil a man that's the truth you're lying again it's it's so close they could deceive the very elect if possible you go right back to to Genesis Adam and Eve you go right back to Genesis and Cain and Abel amen brother sister just just see the deception god help us brother god help us make sure that you got the right anointing on you that's influencing you to do this or do that or say this or say that you don't make sure it's make sure it's Christ in you the hope of glory a man not Satan and you remember again it's just there's there's only just one word if you if you turn aside from one word you turn aside from God and you bring the judgment of God upon you you man what you do you better have the Holy Ghost leadership Holy Ghost discernment you've got to do it for God and for the glory of God be led by the spirit sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God but if you're not a son and daughter of God then you're led by the spirit the devil it's serious God help our young people got out bar or us older ones and so on and then all you brothers as hitches in between please let's be spiritual think spiritual experience or live spiritual walk spiritual amen be constantly conscious of who you are as a son and daughter of God of course if you are son dollar God you will be conscious you'll be very calm you'd be very conscious of God's will not my real father don't be done all brother that takes death to you to yourself a man and Jesus was facing death but before he experienced that death and laid down his neck for life on the cross it gets 70 he died yeah oh no knows how the cross in Jerusalem no no he died and get 70 why he died to thee knowing knowing what he was going to experience in the flesh he was God but still he was going to he was going to bear all of our sin he was gonna pay the price for all of us you and me you know the sins of the old world he was gonna pay the price for a man and he was sinless but he was tempted in all points like as we are what all we think he just he was just perfect he came and he did this did that he was God right right but he wanted to experience what you and I experienced he was one to experience what they--what what his sons and daughters experienced all down through all the ages hey man took four four thousand years and the two thousand years ahead of them oh yeah what what the sits does the seed of garbling experience in the church ages right on down to it to the Great Tribulation you using one experience at all tempted in all points yet without seeing and it came to get some money and knowing what he was going to suffer in the flesh be beaten a man and he would shed his blood not only by the soldier piercing him on the cross but he would be beaten and whipped til his blood would be shed now he that He shed his blood and gets M&E that's where it started his shed as it worked great he sweaters were great drops of blood his sweat oh what what a burden he was buried oh brother how did you do you feel that way sometimes I do many times oh yeah he was bearing the burden and the ministry ought to be bearing the burden the bride is bearing a burden because of the hour were living it this is not just when I live in a new Thursday wesley's day or the pentecostal day we're living in two bright bride age and brother there's less and less of the of the anointing now because there because the number of people that got the money is getting fewer and fewer fewer whereas ice as I said before one time the anointing in the atmosphere there in the world was different but now it's not it's different all right but it's not the Spirit of God it's not the anointing of God it's the anointing of spirit of the devil that is that's the truth because one time you you take Sundays and any even sinners you respected you our Sundays and even sinners respect his son these sinners wouldn't do this on Sundays or wouldn't do that unless they were something like a Roman Catholic because if we went around anywhere on a Sunday and we saw somebody doing this and doing that we was at all their Catholic you know I guess because because if they were any Lincoln's are methods United Salvation Army they would they wouldn't do anything even knowing if there weren't Christians they were so one one of this is Sunday so they wouldn't do it David dude it would rest for sure even though they didn't go to church but but then I I wish I would see people going to church you know and again look out the window see them walking to church and for years that I I walk to church and so on so but it was different and you go outside the atmosphere was different there was a greater light there is a greater anointing in the atmosphere and it was God because God was there was more and more saints there's more and more seat sons and daughters of God they're a man and you go to church you get your mind you open the door there was no loud noise no loud talking or passion brother sister just a whisper why because it was it was receding there not just that this is a church yeah and it shouldn't do this shouldn't do that it's just that the anointing influenced them not to do it it was just so it was just it was just so so natural you get into that church you sit down and and you and you wouldn't say anything you wouldn't do anything you just pray you know and we're of the Lord but now even churches are cold the atmosphere in the church is cold not like it used to be no no not by any why because the number of people with the anointing is fewer pure pure pure Amen Strait is the gate narrows the way and few there be that find it so grace of God to us and for those who experience that back in that day even when we first came when I first came to the message oh it's not like that now I prayed crying Kali Oh Don the Lord nor if you don't come soon there won't be no flesh Saint oh I don't want to be saved I hope so obregón in the rapture by the grace of God but I trust you realize that you've got to make your calling and your election sure gotta respond to - to what you're doing to make your calling and election sure God look down and see that you're serious a man you're sincere God's looking for anything is sincerity so God helped us to discern spirits because there's there's moral - spirit the devil around everywhere then then the Spirit of God Amen why because God is pulling away pulling away pulling away and Satan is taking control control control a man the grace of God I was struck by this here it's a tremendous responsibility on the ministry and again the tremendous responsibility to those under the ministry I did mention in the last service that this is a judgement seat but not I wasn't thinking about this quote where the prophet of God said the word going over the pulpit is easy to judging you and it is amazing yeah the judgment see and then he said right here and and it struck me when I ordered a guy I did I light it some time ago but I struck me when it when I heard the Prophet mention it again this morning he said knowing surely that in the day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and be ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their eternal destination amen it's unfortunate that most don't realize that well it's just me it's up to me no no no oh God have mercy on us Easter day will determine their eternal destination therefore Lord in that day we would be a judge or against the generation that we preach to father God please through Jesus name let us not say one word that would be wrong but may we have sincere hearts and open mind that we might receive the things that's yours that we might be able to go out into our different fields of work and be better equipped because of our meeting with you this morning and he said Lord that we might be so filled with and charged with thy spirit of your presence here that the room would become the room not so much the building that we are sitting in but the building that we are living in they come all together a cloud of the glory of God in the life that you're living in this body by the grace of God amen so god help us brother see he we don't realize how serious it is they just don't realize it he said I think it's a good thing for us as ministers to follow our order when we see such things in the world as we see today and we have an order from God it's for the discerning of spirit trying the spirit I believe that and that is a very great lesson for the church today is to try the spirit of anything have discernment of the Spirit I do not think that we should ever by any means ever try to judge a person by denomination well I've been preaching that for over 50 years because a lot of Labor's have been condemning people because they go to a denomination and as I said 50 years ago or 51 years ago I preached to a big church full of believers I said you better stop that I assess you but for the grace of God so I stole condemn them that's where you were God brought you over this pray God bring them out and so on and like I told you after I finished preaching God confirmed it when her brother student spoke in tongues and then another brother stood and interpreted and warned the people that there wasn't me they heard it was God it wasn't my words it was the Word of God warning the people because of their spirit and attitude see God judges your spirit oh yeah oh well no I I believe the word but if you believe the word to let the spirit of the word so that's what God's judging yeah it determines whether or not you really believe the Lord amen so brother discernment of spirit well this is what we need yeah some have a greater greater anointing and of the gift deserting spirits oh yeah just sometimes you could say something to other times you can you just hold your peace and go on by the grace of God oh yeah so goddess goddess blessing with that down through the years many times and I thank the Lord for that he's big grace so he said you don't judge him because he go to a church or denomination and so on it says I do not think that we should ever by any means try to judge a person by the denomination that belonged to or the group that they are assembled with whether they be Methodist Baptist but Presbyterian or Pentecostal or whatever as says we should never judge the man by the denomination we should we should always judge him by the Spirit that he has all right because you can have the word is still a wrong spirit on you oh yeah you can have the word the message and still haven't still ever wrong anointing on you yeah wrong motives wrong objectives yeah because you could be right in line with with the mechanics but not the dynamics Amen that the letter of the word doctrinally had creep decreed but not by the Holy Ghost living the word I would in you and through you as he did in Christ amen he said we should never judge a man by the denomination he belongs to we should always judge him by the spirit he has and that's true like I said you go and greet a brother sister and you you desert their spirit oh yeah definitely amen he's like one time we had a stranger come in and I preached and I said Lord I said he's not a believer but I said easily I said he's respecting the word and I said he's catching the revelation I sensed that Lord and after the service I shook hands with him and he said all we said that was wonderful he said I've never heard that before but he said it was the truth he said you're right oh I said good I said I I felt I said you were receiving it a man and we had a sister here and I now love you maybe a few months ago and she come in here and here she was she had her hair bobbed up she had shorts a slacks on and she was dressed just dressed worldly but professing to be a Christian brother you talk about somebody where the right spirit should judge a lot of believers she rises and gentleman he's a lot of believers but she come in here sent here and as 1st or 2nd seat there and well oh I see Lorna she's got a nice spirit why because she was worshiping she was praising the Lord she was responding to the word and all and she she was from Ontario and she's told us after that she felt in my spirit ear now there was a lot of women would come in here and to see you other sisters the way you're dressed and everything else they would feel uncomfortable and maybe someone would eventually get up and lead glow but she wouldn't do that she felt the presence of God here and she and that's what she wanted a man and as she saw it was wonderful she said and she was going to recommend to her grandchildren that's here somewhere that if they go to church they should come here a man god bless her god bless her for that her brother's sister their spirit was right not that she's bride but again also got to remember there there there there's many are called few are chosen so they're just made it than all the ones this call does not lost no no they're going to be there outside the city but the bride's gonna be in the city the New Jerusalem with the king to sit with him and his strong by the grace of God a man so brother keep your spirit right your attitude right and if you got to keep your spirit right Natalie right towards those that are out there how much more does God look for it among the Saints among them believers have a right mode and a right objective all for the glory of God amen so he said whether he's a latter rain or former rain and he said whatever it might be we should never judge him but by his Spirit he said we are to discern spirit a man and there's the trouble that people got today is they don't have discernment grace of God brother any evidence or proof of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul that you're born again you're born again brother you you'll have you'll have Holy Ghost deserving it's Christ in me it's Christ in in in you amen giving you discernment of what you should do say you know and how you should treat this one treat that one and so on amen grace of God amen just won't not be long just a couple of minutes he said there's so much in the day we are living in pertaining to gives and so many people judge people by a gift that they have I believe these things are gifts I believe that we see what we see take place his gift and they are god-given gifts but if we do not use them in the right way that God intended them to be used then we can do more armed than with the gifts that we could do if we did not have the gifts yet I have a right spirit in the right attitude right motive right objective amen because people do have a gift but they got a wrong motive objective and they do more harm with it than they do good yeah and they'll be judged for that Easter the other night I made a statement at the pulpit saying that I would rather see brotherly love existing among the church if I didn't have one case of healing or anything else we must know what these things are for amen by the grace of God he said if a person had a real gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ I don't care what he belongs to he said you're not deserting the man you're discerning the spirit the life that is in the man and he said and that's what God told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to desert a man's group a group but we are constrained and commanded by God to discern the spirit that is in the man what he's trying to do what spirit is in his life is trying to lead him to and then if we can find out that he's trying to lead the people not to break them up but to bring them together to bring them the Church of the Living God not all to one denomination but to an understanding fellowship and unity of the Spirit whatever it is if he is former or latter rained his spirit and his purpose is right and the spirit that's in him no matter what movie belongs to the spirit that's in him is trying to point the people to Calvary amen praise the Lord let me finish with this he said every man ought to have a church home that's true you ought to have a place not just a float about from pillar to post but as somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithe and some of you help support the cause take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group there's earn his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you got fellowship with one another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of Christ and if you will notice the motives and objectives of the Old Testament prophets he said they had one thing that their old theme of the Old Testament was built around they did not get out and do things just for money or fame they did it for the Spirit of God and the glory of God thank God so god help us to have if we have anything let's make sure we got discernment of spirit because that's as one guess that we do need we can route we can believe now I understand this message was before the open of the seals and after the opening of the seals God was calling us to a greater and greater separation unto Him amen and God is looking for a greater and greater anointing of discernment Oh mine see it more and more the word that God gives you it's more and more of the spirit discernment is you got to discern you're gonna discern what is contrary to the work counter to the word or discern what is the word and so on by the grace of God what is the will of God Amen so whatever you do make sure it's the will of God you young people whatever you do make sure it's the will of God a man you know doing what you'd like to do or want to do you got to do what what God needs you to do again sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God so the Lord bless you with a greater and greater the spirit of discernment for the glory of God amen and hey if you want to start discernment you start with yourself yeah mr. Zurn your your thoughts your your words your deeds your motives your objectives your attitude Amen your actions your reactions you deserve that amen if you got the spirit the sermon oh yeah yeah and you and you and you step aside from the leadership of the Holy Ghost you'll convict you oh you shouldn't say that you shouldn't act like that you shouldn't have that attitude you shouldn't have that spirit god help us the proof will go forth as sons and daughters of God that we are born again oh I could have preached on it because I brought notes against a few notes on again to finish the grace and I also bought some notes on being born again they made and if you're born again you're a new creature and little by little by little the more you get and mature as a son of God daughter of God the less and less the old nature controls you less and less and less and more and more the spirit God controls you amen the nature of God controls you amen grace the will of God controls you not my will father don't be done god bless you is dead praise the Lord again I encourage you to go read the tape read the book brother or listen to the tape or the or the CD again on the discernment of spirits because again as we read in the scriptures we're living in an hour that's so deceiving there's so many deceiving spirits would deceive the very elect impossible that brother that's pretty close isn't that is pretty close how are we gonna discern by the grace of God we need to hold a ghost discernment I was gonna desert Christ from the out of Christ if they're twins in the same church well I got a spirit of the Spirit of Christ is here but the spirit of the Antichrist is also here oh yeah what for to get you to add to what's being ministered or to take away from what's being ministered a man so we better we need we need that discernment so are we gonna deserve between this this the Spirit of God and the spirit the devil amen judge it by the word Amen because if it's God he's going to keep you alive with the word and if you're in line with the word not just not just mechanically but dynamics the Holy Ghost you know that you will have the right spirit the right attitude amen right motors right objectives all for the glory of God man amen oh yeah they've seen God help us to have Holy Ghost desert meant Holy Ghost leadership in our lives not my real father don't be done amen the sing
