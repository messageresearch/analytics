[53:39] 10:08 up there and we'll give brother
[53:43] paul the pulpit and let him bring the
[53:47] word of the Lord tonight pretty much God
[53:50] has all brother Paul's heart for us to
[53:52] hear so being prayer for him as he comes
[53:55] was him being unto me according to thy
[53:59] word amen
[54:01] we had the same spirit that that Mary
[54:04] had she was willing to subject herself
[54:07] to God to let him have his way amen
[54:11] praise the Lord and Jesus himself his
[54:15] one brother said he was meek and he was
[54:19] lonely and yet he had all the power of
[54:21] heaven
[54:23] and that's where we have to come to I
[54:25] believe that we talked about it at
[54:27] dinner the other night with brother Paul
[54:28] we talked about subjection and humility
[54:31] the things that are most needed and to
[54:34] be able to be like Christ they have all
[54:37] the power of heaven within us by grace
[54:41] the power of the Holy Ghost
[54:43] within each and every one of us so may
[54:46] God minister to that need tonight
[54:48] through brother Paul so let's sing that
[54:51] be it unto me according to your word and
[54:53] he will come

[1:16:19] go tonight
[1:16:20] a man getting tired of this old world
[1:16:25] Amen we belong to another place from
[1:16:29] another country I was born for another
[1:16:32] country and I'm looking forward to that
[1:16:34] time the chains of the body praise the
[1:16:36] Lord we're excited about it and becomes
[1:16:39] more real every day doesn't it praise
[1:16:41] the Lord
[1:16:42] well let's stand to read the word
[1:16:44] tonight and just spend some time in the
[1:16:46] Word of God we once again want to say
[1:16:48] for thank you for your hospitality and
[1:16:50] we just enjoyed the fellowship and I
[1:16:52] know I'll enjoy it the rest of the
[1:16:53] weekend and that we bring you greetings
[1:16:55] from our church there at home and I'll
[1:16:57] be having service tomorrow and we're
[1:16:59] looking forward to what the Lord has for
[1:17:01] us here praise the Lord and nice to meet
[1:17:04] all the new folks here tonight that's
[1:17:05] joined us may God bless you we hope to
[1:17:08] get to shake your hand and we know that
[1:17:10] we feel right it comfortable with the
[1:17:11] message of the last days and what God is
[1:17:14] doing for us can you say man
[1:17:16] and no one minister no one minister in
[1:17:19] this message has a full handle on all
[1:17:22] things to bring the bride to perfection
[1:17:24] it takes a five full ministry no one
[1:17:27] minister understands at all god set it
[1:17:31] up probably to keep us humble can you
[1:17:33] say Amen but it's not one-man show
[1:17:35] can you say Amen but it's a fivefold
[1:17:37] ministry bringing the bride to
[1:17:39] perfection so I'm just a portion of that
[1:17:42] tonight but I want to be faithful in my
[1:17:44] portion I want to be faithful to put my
[1:17:46] shoulder to the wheel with brother
[1:17:47] Gerald was ministered for so many years
[1:17:50] here and been faithful to the message of
[1:17:52] the hour and so part he's part of the
[1:17:54] fivefold ministry I am and the brothers
[1:17:57] you've been having in and so we're just
[1:17:58] here to serve the Bride of Christ but it
[1:18:01] is an important place the fivefold
[1:18:03] ministry is so crucial important to us
[1:18:05] as the scripture said in Ephesians to
[1:18:07] bring the people to perfection can you
[1:18:09] say Amen so we need the fivefold we
[1:18:11] don't need the counterfeit but we need
[1:18:12] the real true faithful ministry working
[1:18:15] underneath the headship of the Prophet
[1:18:17] God sent for this day and preaching that
[1:18:19] message we would have no
[1:18:20] message of our own we have no
[1:18:22] contribution of our own but were to be
[1:18:24] faithful to what God has brought through
[1:18:26] his prophet and we realize God always
[1:18:29] uses live ministry always live ministry
[1:18:32] until when the Prophet brings the word
[1:18:34] then he leaves the fivefold ministry God
[1:18:36] called men to bring the bride to the
[1:18:38] place she needs to be so we're here
[1:18:41] tonight to help out with that I want to
[1:18:42] read from first samuel tonight chapter 1
[1:18:45] and we're going to speak a little bit
[1:18:48] and continue a little bit last night we
[1:18:51] took the expectation of mature sons and
[1:18:54] we trust people that we need to be
[1:18:56] according to the Word of God and we
[1:18:59] don't want to be under false
[1:19:00] expectations or misled under
[1:19:03] expectations that are not of God but we
[1:19:06] do want to be expecting the real
[1:19:09] expectations of God of what's coming and
[1:19:11] what where he's taking us in our lives
[1:19:13] we want to be under expectation for that
[1:19:15] constantly amen so first samuel chapter
[1:19:18] 1 and you remember last night in
[1:19:22] speaking about that we were speaking of
[1:19:24] the two final stages of adoption and
[1:19:27] there's two final stages according to
[1:19:29] romans that we read last night and that
[1:19:31] is the one that's obvious the one that
[1:19:33] gets preached about quite often and
[1:19:34] we're just saying about it is the
[1:19:36] rapture that's the final adoption that's
[1:19:39] the final adoption to wit Paul says in
[1:19:43] other words we're looking to that day
[1:19:45] when that's the final take change of the
[1:19:46] body but we realized a few scriptures
[1:19:49] before last night that he said the
[1:19:51] manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:19:53] that is related to something we come to
[1:19:57] before the rapture and that is that all
[1:19:59] creation is waiting for not just the
[1:20:01] rapture but also for sons to take their
[1:20:03] position in a maturity can you say man
[1:20:07] so that's why our expectations are of
[1:20:10] mature sons and maturing and becoming
[1:20:12] the sons on this earth that God needs us
[1:20:15] to be burning all the immaturity is out
[1:20:18] of us so last night I was saying that we
[1:20:21] often hear a lot about the second part
[1:20:24] of adoption in the rapture but we don't
[1:20:27] hear a lot of sermons about the
[1:20:29] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:20:31] and what that really means and that's
[1:20:33] why I preached it last night because my
[1:20:34] expectation is see my life and the
[1:20:37] people of my church come to a place of
[1:20:39] maturity in the Word of God that we're
[1:20:42] no longer as I love the picture that
[1:20:44] brother read last night and I didn't get
[1:20:46] to that scripture but it fits in so
[1:20:47] perfectly leaving the principles of the
[1:20:49] doctrine of Christ we move on can you
[1:20:52] say man he that uses milk and the word
[1:20:54] is unskillful in the Word of God
[1:20:56] so as the Prophet said we need a church
[1:20:59] to come to maturity so that she's ready
[1:21:02] to be able to handle things and be under
[1:21:04] Dominion in this life over the domain
[1:21:06] that God has given us so it's one thing
[1:21:09] to preach about us one thing for you say
[1:21:10] to say Amen but what either desires we
[1:21:13] really get contrite before the Lord and
[1:21:15] say Lord take all the immaturity zout of
[1:21:17] me because you need a parameter
[1:21:20] individual towards the Word of God
[1:21:22] that's what you need there's enough
[1:21:24] immature people there's enough people in
[1:21:26] Christianity that are immature there's
[1:21:28] enough babies sometimes even around the
[1:21:30] message they just want to be babied this
[1:21:33] one say while I'm in a message church
[1:21:34] I'm fine listen we got to grow out of
[1:21:36] that God's wanting us to take our
[1:21:38] position so just like we hear messages
[1:21:41] on that part of adoption rapture rather
[1:21:44] than manifested sons tonight I'd like it
[1:21:46] to take it deeper and I want to speak on
[1:21:48] the little change needed and we realized
[1:21:51] that that that fits as well because the
[1:21:55] change that's talked about a lot is the
[1:21:57] rapture the change of our bodies but I'm
[1:21:59] going to show us tonight through Hannah
[1:22:01] here in the Bible and other women of the
[1:22:03] Bible if I have time that there were
[1:22:05] just before the promise came to pass the
[1:22:07] full promise there was a little change
[1:22:09] needed in their lives so it's not the
[1:22:12] big change I want to talk about the
[1:22:13] little change and sometimes little
[1:22:16] changes are just as important as the big
[1:22:18] ones
[1:22:19] what's happening your life now is isn't
[1:22:22] very important to contribute to going in
[1:22:24] a rapture so want to speak about a
[1:22:28] little change needed a little change
[1:22:30] needed and so we begin here in 1st
[1:22:34] Samuel chapter 1 there was a certain man
[1:22:38] of Rama the afem of mount ephraim and
[1:22:42] his name was Alcona and the son of jerem
[1:22:45] in the son of Elah who the son of tahoe
[1:22:47] the son of zu and aphrodite and i'll
[1:22:52] read his name again cuz we heard so many
[1:22:54] names there but the name of this husband
[1:22:56] is al Qaeda and al Qaeda had two wives
[1:23:00] the name of one was Hana and the name of
[1:23:03] the other was pnina and pnina had
[1:23:05] children but hannah had no children and
[1:23:08] this man went up out of his city to her
[1:23:10] yearly to worship and to sacrifice under
[1:23:13] the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two
[1:23:15] sons of elephant and phineas the priest
[1:23:19] of the Lord were there and when the time
[1:23:20] was that out Kenai offered he gave two
[1:23:22] pennant Penta his wife and to her sons
[1:23:25] and daughters portions but unto Hannah
[1:23:27] he gave up worthy portion was a double
[1:23:30] portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord
[1:23:32] had shut up her womb and her adversary
[1:23:35] also provoked her sore to make her fret
[1:23:39] which means to worry because the Lord
[1:23:42] had shut up her womb and as she did so
[1:23:45] year by year she went up to the house of
[1:23:47] the Lord so she provoked her therefore
[1:23:51] she wept and did not eat and then Alcona
[1:23:53] her husband said to her his wife why
[1:23:56] weepest thou
[1:23:57] why are either stile not why is thy
[1:24:00] heart grieved am not i better to thee
[1:24:03] than 10 sons so Hannah rose up after a
[1:24:06] head she had eaten in Shiloh and after
[1:24:08] they had drunk now Eli the priest set up
[1:24:10] a seat by a post to the temple of the
[1:24:12] law of the Lord and she was in
[1:24:14] bitterness of soul and prayed unto the
[1:24:16] Lord and wept sore and she vowed about
[1:24:19] and said O Lord of hosts if thou will
[1:24:21] indeed look on the affliction of thy
[1:24:22] handmaid and remember me and not forget
[1:24:25] that had made but will give unto thy
[1:24:27] handmaid a man-child she'd ask that
[1:24:31] every year now she had asked that
[1:24:33] that's the that's the same request every
[1:24:35] year but something now has happened if
[1:24:39] you give me the child then I will give
[1:24:42] him unto the Lord all the days of his
[1:24:44] life and there show no razor come upon
[1:24:47] his head so it's the same prayer but it
[1:24:50] was more to it this year and so a little
[1:24:53] change was needed her prayer changed her
[1:24:57] attitude changed
[1:24:58] let's pray Heavenly Father we pray that
[1:25:01] you'll anoint the word tonight we pray
[1:25:03] father that you'll help us to get out of
[1:25:05] the way Lord God the songs of Zion has
[1:25:08] been sung the children have sung to us
[1:25:11] Lord God I'm glad to be gathered in a
[1:25:14] place Lord the company of the Lord and
[1:25:16] the Bible even says the company of
[1:25:18] angels are around us and Lord this is
[1:25:21] the most important place to be here
[1:25:23] tonight there isn't a place in this city
[1:25:26] or this this province that would be more
[1:25:29] important than to be right here Lord
[1:25:30] where you could meet with your people
[1:25:32] and God I pray that we'd be a vessel
[1:25:35] used of you tonight we pray you move
[1:25:37] every hindrance out of the way
[1:25:39] and Lord help our minds and hearts to
[1:25:41] receive your word in Jesus name Amen
[1:25:44] now I bless you want you to shake
[1:25:45] somebody's hand before you take your
[1:25:46] seat and greet them say god bless you
[1:26:00] praise the Lord
[1:26:02] now saints of God we want to look at
[1:26:05] this section of Scripture here and I've
[1:26:07] ministered some of these things in other
[1:26:09] places you may have heard me but I want
[1:26:11] to bring it in line with our series this
[1:26:13] weekend and talking about the change
[1:26:16] that's needed in our lives and also the
[1:26:18] maturity that we come to and it's when I
[1:26:21] begin to speak of Hannah tonight and if
[1:26:23] we have time I'd like to go into Esther
[1:26:25] as well this is only two women out of
[1:26:27] the Bible that the Lord led me to when I
[1:26:30] studied this because there was a
[1:26:32] minister who come through our church you
[1:26:34] know I like to get fed too sometimes and
[1:26:36] we have ministers in and sometimes the
[1:26:38] word can just break open sometimes
[1:26:40] through these brothers I had a brother
[1:26:41] come through and he dealt with the
[1:26:43] subject of humility and he said many
[1:26:46] good things about the level that there
[1:26:48] were I can't remember all he said but he
[1:26:50] was taught us that there were levels of
[1:26:52] humility in every human being but there
[1:26:55] are levels of humility that the bride
[1:26:57] comes to that is not for the rest of the
[1:26:59] world there's levels of humility you
[1:27:02] know it takes humbleness for someone to
[1:27:04] give to the United Way to give charity
[1:27:06] to give up some of their money and give
[1:27:08] the charity so they may not be even a
[1:27:10] Christian but it takes a certain
[1:27:12] humility to give that money can you say
[1:27:14] mad but but I do believe that God's
[1:27:17] calling for a deeper humility in us and
[1:27:19] so when he broke that open then I begin
[1:27:23] to search and look at the different
[1:27:25] women of the life as you know of the
[1:27:27] Bible we you know when you study the
[1:27:29] women of the Bible there's a mystery
[1:27:30] behind the women of the Bible of the Old
[1:27:32] Testament for the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:27:34] and you begin to look at these women's
[1:27:36] life and you see God's writing the
[1:27:38] mystery of the bride and these women and
[1:27:40] so when I did it I begin to study
[1:27:43] several of them and I discovered that
[1:27:44] there was something that happened in
[1:27:46] many of them and that is before the
[1:27:49] promise that God gave them before it was
[1:27:51] manifested before it came to its climax
[1:27:53] before it came to the time that they
[1:27:56] wanted to come to it quite often you see
[1:27:59] in these women a greater level of
[1:28:02] humility that they reach in their lives
[1:28:05] in order to trigger the
[1:28:08] us to bring it to pass and I begin to
[1:28:10] look at that same I praise God look at
[1:28:12] that little action there look at that
[1:28:13] little action there and every one of
[1:28:15] them there was some small action that
[1:28:17] they did that in order to trigger the
[1:28:20] promise it brought it into motion and
[1:28:23] brought the promise to pass so it's
[1:28:25] along with brother Gerald said to us
[1:28:27] last night at the end he says you know
[1:28:29] God we're not waiting on God God's
[1:28:32] waiting on us he's given his promise can
[1:28:36] you save the Holy Ghost is here to make
[1:28:37] it come to pass so God's waiting on us
[1:28:40] so we need to look at our lives and say
[1:28:42] Lord I know I'm a believer I know I
[1:28:44] believe I'm a predestinated believer
[1:28:46] before the foundation of the world I'm
[1:28:47] serving you I'm worshiping you I loving
[1:28:49] you I'm serving you every day but Lord
[1:28:52] if there is anything that's lacking in
[1:28:54] my life that would hinder bring in this
[1:28:57] promise to pass god I pray you'll deal
[1:29:00] with my life and that's what the bride
[1:29:02] in humility is saying because we can
[1:29:05] just stay status quo believers and say
[1:29:07] I'm in the message and it's good enough
[1:29:08] but the bride the true bride is saying I
[1:29:11] want something deeper than that amazing
[1:29:15] to see these women and so now I'm just
[1:29:17] going to go into one or two of them
[1:29:18] tonight for lack of time although I will
[1:29:21] remind you that my my batteries in my
[1:29:24] microphone are for eight hours as the
[1:29:26] brothers have reminded me and then they
[1:29:28] said they go out to the store and buy
[1:29:30] more batteries if needed
[1:29:33] so that's gracious in it is I told don't
[1:29:37] tell too many preachers that you'd be in
[1:29:38] trouble
[1:29:39] praise the Lord but you know and then
[1:29:42] they said they might get some redbull or
[1:29:43] something to go along with it which I
[1:29:46] may need I'm kind of tired this weekend
[1:29:47] but but you see now as we look at this
[1:29:50] hand let's take an of first now there
[1:29:53] are two wives of this man L cannot and
[1:29:55] right away we catch that that we can
[1:29:58] bring it up and show in the last days
[1:30:00] there's there's two groups within the
[1:30:03] Christian Church how many believe that
[1:30:06] the Bible teaches that there's two
[1:30:08] groups within the Christian Church as we
[1:30:11] find the Bible teaches and you can call
[1:30:13] it that I guess the most obvious thing
[1:30:15] is there's a foolish virgin there's five
[1:30:18] foolish virgins five wise virgins and
[1:30:20] they're virgins can you same in there
[1:30:22] they're Christians but one five have oil
[1:30:26] five don't have oil and so we realized
[1:30:28] that all of a sudden we really see a
[1:30:30] picture of the church now there's some
[1:30:32] within the church that are there there's
[1:30:34] two groups within the church but you see
[1:30:36] now when we bring it - Hannah Hannah buy
[1:30:39] predestination had a different purpose
[1:30:42] than al-qaeda's other wife Hannah had a
[1:30:46] deeper purpose can you say men so now if
[1:30:49] you watch it now she has a desire to
[1:30:51] have a child but she was not just gonna
[1:30:54] bring forth any child her child was a
[1:30:56] child of promise she was gonna bring
[1:30:59] forth Samuel so now we watch that Hannah
[1:31:03] even though she's a believer she has a
[1:31:05] purpose on her life she's there with her
[1:31:07] husband her husband loves her more
[1:31:09] he got all these factors going on but
[1:31:11] she's lacking bringing forth a child
[1:31:12] when the other when the other woman is
[1:31:14] bringing forth children she is not
[1:31:16] bringing forth any it would appear like
[1:31:18] she needs to be one-to-one to bring it
[1:31:20] forth and she goes into this very
[1:31:22] depressed mode to say lord I don't know
[1:31:25] what's happening I'm praying every year
[1:31:27] I want a child I want a child but you
[1:31:28] see now she didn't realize the purpose
[1:31:30] God had for her life is that there was a
[1:31:33] timing to this
[1:31:35] you're not supposed to bring forth just
[1:31:37] anything you're not like other women
[1:31:41] you're not like the rest of Christians
[1:31:44] out there you're not supposed to bring
[1:31:46] forth what they're bringing forth
[1:31:48] you're supposed to bring forth upon the
[1:31:50] Sun can you say that
[1:31:53] and that's why saints of God we cannot
[1:31:55] compare ourselves with the rest of
[1:31:57] Christendom I don't mean to get a pride
[1:32:00] to say we're matter we're not any better
[1:32:02] except for about the grace of God but
[1:32:04] you do need to realize don't compare
[1:32:06] yourself with them out there don't even
[1:32:08] compare yourself with a person sitting
[1:32:10] next to you God has a special calling on
[1:32:13] your life and the promise come into your
[1:32:17] life may take longer than what we see
[1:32:19] out there sometimes you look at the
[1:32:21] churches out there in these mega
[1:32:22] churches and all these other things and
[1:32:24] they grow to great numbers and you're
[1:32:25] looking so my look how blessed they are
[1:32:28] and look at all these numbers coming in
[1:32:29] to Christianity and they got so many
[1:32:31] thousands they bring to the Lord and
[1:32:33] sometimes you look at our little places
[1:32:34] you really whoa what's going on what's
[1:32:36] taking place here and you start to
[1:32:38] compare yourself and why is all that
[1:32:40] happening they have the same Bible that
[1:32:42] we have they believe then Jesus as well
[1:32:45] you understand and so you look at all
[1:32:48] that in your season looks like they're
[1:32:50] bringing forth they're bringing forth
[1:32:51] they're bringing forth and yet we're
[1:32:53] holding on to quite a different promise
[1:32:55] here and this cannot happen by man's
[1:32:59] orchestration this what God has given us
[1:33:02] through the message cannot just be
[1:33:04] humanly doubt dabbled with this has to
[1:33:07] come in your life in God's time
[1:33:13] so you cannot compare yourself with all
[1:33:16] these people and tonight I want you to
[1:33:19] know that I feel just as brother branham
[1:33:20] did I don't de Christianize anybody
[1:33:23] anytime God has dealt with somebody I
[1:33:25] say praise the Lord
[1:33:26] I'm not here to say that and I say the
[1:33:28] way the Prophet said it's not the people
[1:33:30] and denominations I believe they're
[1:33:31] sincere and they believe everything they
[1:33:33] know can you say it's the systems of
[1:33:36] denomination so don't ever think we're
[1:33:40] better than the people because they're
[1:33:41] sincere hearts like we are you see but
[1:33:44] you see now we at the same that we
[1:33:45] cannot compare ourselves but with what
[1:33:48] God has to bring forth from them is
[1:33:51] different than what a believer is in
[1:33:53] this hour and this is the part that
[1:33:55] Hannah couldn't catch because she went
[1:33:57] every year to the temple praising and
[1:33:59] worshipping God and and I should say in
[1:34:02] burden before God saying Lord I just
[1:34:04] want a child I want to have a child I
[1:34:06] want to bring forth but you see now as
[1:34:09] we move along in this story
[1:34:10] Hannah desired a child like any other
[1:34:14] wife would want a child but God chose
[1:34:16] her for more than that if you don't get
[1:34:18] anything else tonight I want to let you
[1:34:20] know brothers and sisters no matter who
[1:34:22] you are even our children God chose you
[1:34:24] for something more don't you ever forget
[1:34:28] that don't compare yourself with others
[1:34:31] God chose you for something more
[1:34:34] and it was more than just to have what
[1:34:37] she was to bring forth was not just
[1:34:38] another baby but to bring forth a profit
[1:34:41] the promise of that age she is supposed
[1:34:43] to bring for the promise of the hour the
[1:34:46] promise of the age and many of the women
[1:34:49] who typed the bride in the Old Testament
[1:34:53] didn't know if you ever studied this but
[1:34:55] many of the women in the Old Testament
[1:34:57] who typed the bride were barren while
[1:35:00] others around them were bringing four
[1:35:02] children Sarah
[1:35:06] Baron rebecca baron rachel baron they'll
[1:35:13] type the bride and there that their
[1:35:15] wounds are closed they're not bringing
[1:35:17] forth a and they're standing watching
[1:35:19] all these concubines or these handmade
[1:35:21] so whatever else it was and there may
[1:35:23] have in all kinds of babies babies
[1:35:25] babies these kind of like my church
[1:35:27] right now babies babies babies coming
[1:35:29] around it's just amazing I say bring
[1:35:31] them on praise the Lord will grow the
[1:35:34] church some way
[1:35:36] and then Paul and Kimberly came down and
[1:35:39] now baby here I guess it was in the
[1:35:41] water or something I don't know what you
[1:35:43] see but these women stood there bare and
[1:35:46] before God they couldn't bring forth and
[1:35:48] yet they're the chosen one as their
[1:35:51] brother said many are called but few are
[1:35:53] chosen and they're standing there having
[1:35:56] to watch others be blessed
[1:35:58] oh there's prosper I just had children
[1:36:02] when they're saying God's Eric right
[1:36:03] well why can't I bring forth it and then
[1:36:06] she even tried to inject your own ideas
[1:36:08] Abraham go go with Hagar and all that
[1:36:11] taking place according to to her own
[1:36:13] will can you say man and so yeah and you
[1:36:16] can't fault Sarah for that she had a
[1:36:19] promise she knew there was gonna be a
[1:36:21] promise she she news was so you can't
[1:36:23] fault her witch for trying saying Lord
[1:36:25] is supposed to come forth but yes
[1:36:27] according to God's will it's according
[1:36:29] to his way and it's according to his
[1:36:31] time but also it's according to the
[1:36:35] attitude and this woman where she comes
[1:36:38] to that all God now he's got the promise
[1:36:44] when he speaks it it's gonna happen but
[1:36:47] we want to take a look at ourselves
[1:36:48] tonight is everybody on board look at
[1:36:52] these women Sarah Rebecca Rachel there
[1:36:55] was a delay sometimes with them there
[1:36:59] was a delay in the promise there was it
[1:37:01] in between time there was a seventh seal
[1:37:05] in the suspense between life and death
[1:37:08] it seemed like a millennium I'm Colton
[1:37:11] brother Brandon from the seventh seal
[1:37:13] there there was a delay there was an
[1:37:15] in-between time and so for them at that
[1:37:18] time as I was saying last night is a
[1:37:21] very suspenseful very can be a very
[1:37:24] scary time it can be a very burdened
[1:37:27] time because you're seeing there's
[1:37:29] things to take place in our lives and
[1:37:32] bring forward the promise that we're not
[1:37:33] seeing all that yet and so we get a
[1:37:35] little anxious we get burdened but you
[1:37:38] see now there was a delay in the promise
[1:37:39] all these women but it had to come
[1:37:41] according to Doug on its promise not
[1:37:43] anything manufactured don't forget that
[1:37:45] the desire for women to have a baby in
[1:37:48] the Old Testament
[1:37:49] and even today if she's a normal woman
[1:37:52] the desire for a woman to bring forth a
[1:37:55] child in the Old Testament that held a
[1:37:59] mystery in it within itself can you say
[1:38:02] man the craving for those women to carry
[1:38:06] on the seed the godly seed was so
[1:38:10] intense that they were willing to do
[1:38:12] anything sometimes to carry that seed he
[1:38:16] wasn't just a lot of those women wasn't
[1:38:18] just having a baby it was there was some
[1:38:21] spiritual thing guiding them they wanted
[1:38:24] to carry the seed on and Tamar look what
[1:38:27] she was willing to do to carry that seed
[1:38:29] on so there's a mystery even behind the
[1:38:32] women that want to have a child to bring
[1:38:35] forth the right seed even know well I
[1:38:37] know women today brother Graham says
[1:38:38] they're gonna mother a dog and they're
[1:38:40] gonna mother a little thing a little
[1:38:41] snotty little dog and they've lost
[1:38:43] motherhood they don't have babies
[1:38:45] anymore brother Brett said they want to
[1:38:47] practice this and so they don't have to
[1:38:48] have these little snotty kids and so
[1:38:50] that's what happened to women but a true
[1:38:52] genuine woman there's a desire in her
[1:38:55] that God put in her to bring forth the
[1:38:58] child there's some sisters they're just
[1:39:00] not able and we pray and sometimes
[1:39:03] sisters and then though they will dump
[1:39:04] someone that's that's all fine
[1:39:06] that's only but you see even if she
[1:39:08] doesn't have a child God put within her
[1:39:10] a desire why you put that in there
[1:39:13] because for a woman bearing a child
[1:39:16] brings kind of a completion feeling to
[1:39:18] them like nothing else for a woman
[1:39:24] there's a fulfillment to Brady's Peter
[1:39:28] god there's a completion to it the prize
[1:39:33] Jesus Christ we've been serving the Lord
[1:39:36] all these years
[1:39:38] listen to this thing there's a craving
[1:39:41] can you say let this thing come to its
[1:39:44] completion
[1:39:45] I bring forth Christ and Paul said I
[1:39:48] travail in birth with you until Christ
[1:39:51] before me I'm fixing to have a good time
[1:39:59] tonight we don't have any other place to
[1:40:04] go we're going to just sit right on
[1:40:06] these things in ministry each one so
[1:40:08] praise the Lord the sirens are running
[1:40:11] here out here
[1:40:12] now notice Hannah is there's a fire
[1:40:15] start here that's why you're here siren
[1:40:17] there's a fire starting up in this
[1:40:18] building
[1:40:19] somebody say praise Allah notice now
[1:40:24] Hannah she's a doubly blessed woman she
[1:40:27] has a double portion for her husband he
[1:40:30] has another wife and she's bringing four
[1:40:32] kids but he loves Hannah more and he
[1:40:34] keeps certain portions to them and her
[1:40:36] kids but she give a double core so this
[1:40:38] is the bride how important it was
[1:40:41] I'd like a double portion on a lock
[1:40:44] speaks of the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:40:47] the husband even loves her even more she
[1:40:50] has all of this but sometimes excuse me
[1:40:55] she has all this love she has all this
[1:40:57] double portion she's blessed she's
[1:40:59] chosen of god she's favored by her
[1:41:01] husband but yet something holds back
[1:41:06] from conceiving god shut up remove
[1:41:09] notice you have Hannah chosen she's
[1:41:13] blessed she has a double portion of
[1:41:15] God's blessing she has predestinated to
[1:41:18] bring forth the word of that day and she
[1:41:22] goes to worship every year not catching
[1:41:25] that full revelation and she just praise
[1:41:27] for her son to come even that there's
[1:41:30] something in it but she prays every year
[1:41:32] she goes back to the temple praise the
[1:41:35] same prayer the same thing Lord bless me
[1:41:38] Lord can be a child caught please give
[1:41:41] me a child she prays for God to give her
[1:41:43] this child every year now if you notice
[1:41:45] there's something else in Scripture in
[1:41:47] verse 6 her advocacy has
[1:41:49] adversary so it's not that just that she
[1:41:52] is burdened by the fact that she's not
[1:41:55] bringing forth what she wants to bring
[1:41:57] for the child she has an adversary he's
[1:42:06] against the promises he's against you be
[1:42:09] in the chosen one you have an adversary
[1:42:13] and Hannah had an adversary so just the
[1:42:16] burden of not being able to conceive was
[1:42:19] enough for a woman but she had an
[1:42:21] adversary that tormented her and the
[1:42:24] Bible says provoked her year after year
[1:42:27] after year she's living all year with
[1:42:29] this provoking adversary to make her
[1:42:32] feel no doubt the voices you hear
[1:42:33] sometimes you're not the chosen one
[1:42:35] what's something wrong what you do wrong
[1:42:37] with God something's wrong I don't have
[1:42:39] my microphone on here right something's
[1:42:41] wrong is that better brother sorry about
[1:42:45] that
[1:42:45] if I drop it just tell me all right just
[1:42:48] tell me I need my microphone so year
[1:42:51] after year she's being provoked and her
[1:42:53] adversaries there was the same voices
[1:42:55] probably that you hear look at you yeah
[1:42:59] your favorite of your husband but you
[1:43:01] can't even bring forth a child you you
[1:43:05] think you're the chosen one do you think
[1:43:07] you're special sounds like the voice of
[1:43:09] the devil anybody ever hear those voices
[1:43:13] you're not producing anymore they either
[1:43:15] just coming to church every week and
[1:43:18] you're just doing this you go to the
[1:43:19] Temple of Jerusalem every year look at
[1:43:21] all your sacrifices you're making your
[1:43:23] dedication to your husband look at you
[1:43:25] worshipping every year being faithful to
[1:43:26] go the house of God
[1:43:27] look at you and yet God doesn't you must
[1:43:31] have done something wrong she didn't do
[1:43:34] anything wrong
[1:43:35] she's God's chosen anyway no matter what
[1:43:37] the devil says
[1:43:41] she was the chosen one to brief how many
[1:43:45] know about this adversary provoking you
[1:43:47] how many have that whisper of the enemy
[1:43:50] in you in your ear every day the same
[1:43:53] one that had a hat you're not any of
[1:43:55] your not a good Christian you're not
[1:43:57] this you're not that always speaking to
[1:43:59] you look what you did look at your bass
[1:44:00] look what you did last week look at your
[1:44:02] look at all this and bread just to
[1:44:04] provoke or provoke or and all the while
[1:44:06] you're wanting to move on with the Lord
[1:44:07] and why can't I move on I can't go any
[1:44:09] further is anybody listening to me here
[1:44:12] tonight this is the provoker that's
[1:44:14] speaking in your ears this is the
[1:44:17] tormentor that speaks in our ears but I
[1:44:19] got good news for you because over there
[1:44:21] in Revelations he says Michael his
[1:44:23] angels were cast out and the accuser of
[1:44:26] our brethren was cast out of the
[1:44:29] heavenly atmosphere out of the
[1:44:31] atmosphere and that means there's a day
[1:44:33] coming well I'll never hear that voice
[1:44:36] in my ear again we ought to stop and
[1:44:41] shout awhile because there's a day
[1:44:44] coming real soon when you will never
[1:44:47] hear the accuser in your ear again
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:52] you'll never hear accusing voice again
[1:44:54] it'll be over you'll never hear my it'll
[1:44:57] be so odd to us you don't think we're
[1:44:59] gonna shout I think we're gonna shout
[1:45:01] cuz we're so used to the devil speaking
[1:45:04] to us and oppressing us and bringing us
[1:45:08] down and trying to read everything why
[1:45:11] isn't this happening in my life and
[1:45:13] reading into it and that's where you you
[1:45:15] overthink things and in the prayer lines
[1:45:18] and the prayer lines brother Graham says
[1:45:20] you seem to be a person to overthinks
[1:45:22] things you're crossing bridges before
[1:45:25] you come to and that person was in a
[1:45:28] spirit of depression because they
[1:45:29] overthink things well the devil helps us
[1:45:31] do that these guys going over here
[1:45:33] Devils got a sphere and things that
[1:45:35] hasn't even happened yet I'll tell your
[1:45:38] friends it's bad enough hearing what's
[1:45:40] happened then fearing what hasn't
[1:45:43] happened yet what a devil can you say
[1:45:45] man it's enough just to deal with
[1:45:47] everyday what's happened and he wants us
[1:45:49] to fear what he even happened what
[1:45:50] hasn't even happened tomorrow yet my
[1:45:52] friends we need to stand on our two feet
[1:45:54] with the power of God interval tell the
[1:45:57] devil get thee behind me Satan
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:01] and he's not given us the spirit of fear
[1:46:05] power and love and a sound mind we're
[1:46:12] not living by the spirit of fear we're
[1:46:15] living like the spirit of adoption
[1:46:16] that's in us it's taken us somewhere so
[1:46:24] here we find this adversary in enemy and
[1:46:28] each year she goes and prays and God
[1:46:31] don't answer and each year this enemy
[1:46:33] increases is provoking and increases his
[1:46:35] more pressure which I had another sermon
[1:46:37] to tell you of the pressure that's
[1:46:38] increasing on the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:46:41] the longer were here the more pressure
[1:46:44] in the Battle of the mind and why is it
[1:46:49] happening but Gerald why is it happening
[1:46:50] because we're the chosen ones
[1:46:53] we're gonna bring forth this promise
[1:46:55] we're the ones that's going in a rapture
[1:46:58] yeah let the devil talk all he wants to
[1:47:00] I'm one of the ones that's escaping this
[1:47:02] thing and whether it's gonna be tomorrow
[1:47:06] morning or whether it's gonna be 30
[1:47:08] years from now it doesn't matter to me
[1:47:10] I'm one of the ones this is going to
[1:47:12] happen too
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:17] so more pressure comes in more prayer
[1:47:20] and this kind of frustrated her Alcona
[1:47:21] her husband after a while and I love the
[1:47:23] scripture it's God has a sense of humor
[1:47:26] because the husband's coming in saying
[1:47:27] why he gets frustrated with his wife I
[1:47:30] know none of your brothers ever get
[1:47:31] frustrated with your wife
[1:47:34] we just leave that alone
[1:47:38] but this husband got frustrated with her
[1:47:41] depression and her negativism and are
[1:47:44] constantly complaining and her constant
[1:47:47] God doesn't answer God has an answer and
[1:47:49] he's tried to shower her with gifts he
[1:47:52] gives her a double portion he keeps
[1:47:53] telling her I love you more than my
[1:47:55] other wife can you imagine a wife here
[1:47:57] on that how many times do I have to tell
[1:47:59] you
[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:14] is any husband's gonna raise your hand
[1:48:16] relate just a little bit to that there's
[1:48:18] an honest one right there how do I get
[1:48:22] this through how I get this through to
[1:48:24] this woman that can is trying to get it
[1:48:26] through I love you I've given you a
[1:48:27] double portion I don't love her as much
[1:48:29] as you I love you still not enough and
[1:48:34] you know what his last comment was he
[1:48:35] says hey anyway ain't are better than 10
[1:48:38] sons but what am I chopped liver here I
[1:48:44] mean I'm better than 10 sons now that's
[1:48:47] a compliment
[1:48:47] that's a confident man brother Chad
[1:48:49] that's a confident man to say to his
[1:48:52] wife I'm better than 10 sons well you
[1:48:57] can think that way all you want to if
[1:49:00] your wife don't feel that way it does no
[1:49:02] good eat the button God's got a sense of
[1:49:07] humor I'm better than 10 sons Hannah
[1:49:11] still no smile no reaction just
[1:49:15] depressed all the time a spirit and a
[1:49:17] cloud hanging over her she's the child
[1:49:21] of God she's a daughter of God but she's
[1:49:24] taking this spirit of depression Devils
[1:49:26] got a provoked in their Abbess race with
[1:49:28] her all the time there's anything her
[1:49:29] husband says that can help pull that
[1:49:31] pull her out of it there isn't anything
[1:49:33] church can do to pull it out of it she
[1:49:36] can't just be pulled out of this let me
[1:49:38] tell you something there's a little
[1:49:40] change that need to happen in him
[1:49:44] there's a little change needed in her
[1:49:46] because there wasn't a problem with
[1:49:48] God's promise there wasn't a problem
[1:49:50] with the church there wasn't a problem
[1:49:53] with going to Jerusalem every year there
[1:49:56] wasn't a problem with the priest wasn't
[1:49:58] a problem with what he preached
[1:49:59] everything's in place why am I saying
[1:50:02] that because people tend to in their
[1:50:04] depression start to blame everybody else
[1:50:06] for their problems
[1:50:07] well can I get an amen
[1:50:10] it makes them feel better if they're in
[1:50:13] depression to start finding other people
[1:50:15] to blame it's the people in the church
[1:50:19] it's the way the pastor is preaching it
[1:50:20] said they didn't do their part somebody
[1:50:22] didn't shake my hand somebody didn't hug
[1:50:24] me if she's letting her depression
[1:50:29] dictate everything else around her we
[1:50:32] need to be careful with that listen
[1:50:38] friends I'm a practical preacher I could
[1:50:40] get down where we're living you want me
[1:50:43] to go deeper just keep saying Amen you
[1:50:46] can ask this to Kimberly she grew up as
[1:50:48] a child in my church and I can take this
[1:50:50] deeper I can really get down where I'm
[1:50:54] living and where you're living and I've
[1:50:56] been a pastor for 30 years as our
[1:50:58] brothers been 4050 years and you learned
[1:51:01] people after a while and people tend to
[1:51:03] find someone else to blame and a lot of
[1:51:06] times they're the problem in this case
[1:51:11] it wasn't a problem with the worship
[1:51:12] wasn't the problem with the priest there
[1:51:13] wasn't a problem with her husband wasn't
[1:51:15] a problem with the other women having
[1:51:17] babies there wasn't problem with that
[1:51:18] Hannah she's a child of God God loved
[1:51:22] her but there was a little change in
[1:51:25] humility that was needed there was a
[1:51:32] little change of attitude pastor and I
[1:51:34] spoke about that the attitude you know
[1:51:40] in this message we can get a prideful
[1:51:41] attitude the word is right the message
[1:51:46] is right we believe it but I'll say it
[1:51:50] the way I said it to him I believe
[1:51:51] through the years some people have
[1:51:52] rejected the message not because the
[1:51:54] message but the way it was presented to
[1:51:56] them
[1:52:01] because people aren't dumb they can
[1:52:04] sense pride they can sense a superior
[1:52:09] attitude and you're not going to sell
[1:52:12] anything I was telling brother Gerald
[1:52:14] brother branham and I can't remember the
[1:52:16] sermon but he mentions in 65 he says now
[1:52:18] if you've got a new product a new hammer
[1:52:21] it's a new modern invention and said the
[1:52:24] old hammer he says you don't go up to
[1:52:26] the guy that's hammering with the old
[1:52:28] hammer and tell him what are you doing
[1:52:30] with that old hammer damn or just yeah
[1:52:31] that ain't nothing you're not
[1:52:33] accomplishing anything and that's the
[1:52:35] way you present your product he said you
[1:52:36] don't do it that way said you go up and
[1:52:39] you compliment him for what he's doing
[1:52:40] so you're doing a good job there and
[1:52:42] said that's a great job you're doing and
[1:52:44] you compliment I find brother Browns
[1:52:46] attitude even just 65 complimenting what
[1:52:51] God's doing in those churches even
[1:52:54] though they weren't message churches now
[1:52:59] he's not holding back his preaching at
[1:53:01] all but his attitude is still a right
[1:53:04] spirit towards me I'm gonna say to you
[1:53:06] we need more of that in the message of
[1:53:09] the album I must feel at home because I
[1:53:12] don't normally say those things
[1:53:13] everywhere but I'm telling you I feel at
[1:53:15] home I'm telling you it's not the
[1:53:18] problem with the word it's not a problem
[1:53:20] with the Holy Ghost it's who's
[1:53:23] representing this thing
[1:53:24] [Applause]
[1:53:25] it's our attitude it's our pride let me
[1:53:31] tell you something you're no better
[1:53:32] except for the grace of God so I'm in
[1:53:36] the message I'm better you're no better
[1:53:37] except for the grace of God you're a
[1:53:39] human being like them
[1:53:41] you got a spirit you got a body you got
[1:53:43] see taste feels you got all this stuff
[1:53:45] you're living in the flesh like them can
[1:53:48] you say my so there's no reason to get a
[1:53:51] superior attitude I know brother brems
[1:53:53] says there's a super race it's Abraham's
[1:53:55] race
[1:53:56] I believe all that but I don't believe
[1:53:57] it when it takes it to a superior pride
[1:54:00] because to me if you're Abraham's race
[1:54:03] the super race you have more humility
[1:54:06] than anybody because you've you've come
[1:54:12] to dimensions of the grace of God more
[1:54:15] than you understand grace more than
[1:54:18] anybody and when you understand grace
[1:54:20] when you understand as our brother Bob
[1:54:23] said tonight that he's washed away
[1:54:25] there's a sea of forgetfulness when you
[1:54:27] understand what justification means when
[1:54:30] you understand that just about means
[1:54:32] just acceptance
[1:54:33] you never did it in the first place when
[1:54:35] you know forgiveness and justification
[1:54:38] the way that you know it then it makes
[1:54:40] us have more grace for others
[1:54:42] [Applause]
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:45] hallelujah blessed be it's me somebody
[1:54:48] say praise the Lord
[1:54:49] blessed be his name god help us god help
[1:54:55] us to die to our pride god help us to
[1:54:57] die to a superior attitude we're nothing
[1:55:00] without the grace of God say I got the
[1:55:03] message and I know more than everybody
[1:55:04] else
[1:55:05] you don't need head knowledge that won't
[1:55:08] get you into a rapture Paul said
[1:55:09] knowledge puffeth up but revelation
[1:55:14] makes you more humble so you know when
[1:55:18] somebody's getting a true revelation and
[1:55:20] not just understanding the mysteries in
[1:55:23] their head when more humilities in their
[1:55:26] life
[1:55:28] plenty of head knowledge so much head
[1:55:30] knowledge in this message and so on
[1:55:32] dazzle preachers that can dazzle the
[1:55:34] people and everybody's caught up in the
[1:55:36] dazzling of the and I'm not against
[1:55:38] preaching deep things but listen it's
[1:55:40] time for the bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:55:43] grow and true not knowledge but true
[1:55:46] revelation that brings the humility and
[1:55:48] character of Jesus Christ that's my
[1:55:53] expectation praise the Lord
[1:55:57] so now it would appear like that God is
[1:56:01] holding this up but there's a little
[1:56:03] change needed and Hannah she needs
[1:56:05] something deeper before this comes to
[1:56:07] pass and in verse 11 is where we see
[1:56:10] this takes a place her prayer that year
[1:56:12] was different it was the same at the
[1:56:14] start but then but will hears her prayer
[1:56:17] different verse 11 but we'll give unto
[1:56:19] the Hamming a man-child as I've asked
[1:56:21] then I will give unto the Lord all the
[1:56:25] days of his life and there shall no
[1:56:26] razor come upon his head listen friends
[1:56:28] her prayer now had a deeper revelation
[1:56:32] behind it
[1:56:34] could I could I be safe to say don't
[1:56:37] don't be offended but could I be say
[1:56:39] that Hannah she's a believer she's a
[1:56:41] daughter of God but she's a bit too
[1:56:43] self-centered she still got a little bit
[1:56:49] of self-centeredness because she's more
[1:56:51] caring about her desires and what she
[1:56:55] wants
[1:56:55] which is fine which is fine it's just
[1:56:57] that if she's the chosen woman she's not
[1:57:01] like the other wife
[1:57:03] okay so now they might be self focused I
[1:57:07] don't know what they are but this is the
[1:57:09] chosen woman of God so if she has a self
[1:57:12] focused attitude too much or selfishness
[1:57:15] too much that she's got a she's got to
[1:57:17] die out to it in order for something
[1:57:20] greater to take place those people
[1:57:24] they're so focused and look at that
[1:57:26] prize look at that so focus yeah don't
[1:57:28] put your fingers at them you're not
[1:57:30] supposed to bring forth but they are
[1:57:31] you're supposed to bring forth this
[1:57:33] could we say there's just a bit of self
[1:57:36] interest self focused they're still too
[1:57:38] much and she's in the message she's in
[1:57:40] the bride she's going to church she's
[1:57:43] listening to the message of the hour but
[1:57:47] there's a bit of selfishness there too
[1:57:50] just just I want this prayer I want this
[1:57:53] I want this I want this but now
[1:57:55] something happens to her prayer and she
[1:57:58] says if you'll give me this child I will
[1:58:01] take it now that listen friends this is
[1:58:03] humility
[1:58:04] this is humility at a deeper level I do
[1:58:08] this at home I come out here hope it's
[1:58:10] okay it's such a small building that I
[1:58:14] feel like I'm right in your face
[1:58:18] you talk about an action here now this
[1:58:20] did you we just not just need to stop
[1:58:22] and think about this because she has a
[1:58:24] desire to have a child so she can have
[1:58:27] it so she can hold it so she can take it
[1:58:30] home she can take care of him she can
[1:58:32] raise the child all that's there that's
[1:58:34] her desire but you take a woman that
[1:58:36] something has happened so deep in Hanna
[1:58:40] that she's willing to say before the
[1:58:43] Lord now if you'll give it to me I will
[1:58:46] take you all and I won't give it back
[1:58:54] see listen friends that's a revelation
[1:58:57] that level of humility that takes a
[1:59:01] revelation that takes a quite a change
[1:59:05] it's a little change but it's a big
[1:59:07] change
[1:59:08] she says Lord if you give it to me and
[1:59:11] this is where the prayer changed she
[1:59:13] said Lord if I if you will give me this
[1:59:15] child I will give it back to you as a
[1:59:18] Nazarite I'll give it to Eli the priest
[1:59:20] he'll be raised in the house of God he
[1:59:23] will be given for your man and then I
[1:59:26] don't know if she knew he would become a
[1:59:28] prophet but that's what he would become
[1:59:29] I'm gonna dedicate this child to you and
[1:59:32] I'm gonna give it and it came to pass as
[1:59:34] she continued praying before the Lord
[1:59:37] that Eli marked her mouth and the story
[1:59:39] goes on that Hannah she spake in her
[1:59:42] heart her only her lips moved but her
[1:59:43] voice was not heard therefore Eli
[1:59:45] thought she was drunk so now something
[1:59:49] happens to Hannah that she has now
[1:59:52] there's there's a greater victory that's
[1:59:54] come in her life she's given up instead
[1:59:59] of holding on to this highway she's
[2:00:02] giving it up
[2:00:04] we need to give up and let Jesus take
[2:00:07] over then we need a little change in our
[2:00:10] life to give up and she gave it up and
[2:00:13] when she did she gets so lost in the
[2:00:16] presence of the Lord and praising him
[2:00:18] that when Eli seen her there was a
[2:00:20] change in her worship because every year
[2:00:23] he's seen her worshiping she didn't look
[2:00:25] like this this year she was drunk in the
[2:00:28] spirit of the Lord why because she was
[2:00:33] released she was she gave it all to God
[2:00:35] she humbled herself she changed her
[2:00:38] attitude about this whole thing I tell
[2:00:40] you there's a great victory in your life
[2:00:41] when you give it all away you're gonna
[2:00:46] come to victories that you haven't felt
[2:00:47] before you're gonna become the feelings
[2:00:50] you never felt before you're a quiet
[2:00:52] quiet worshipper oh that's fine but
[2:00:54] sometimes when you come to these type of
[2:00:56] victories you're not a quiet worshipper
[2:00:57] you become an exuberant worship cuz
[2:01:00] you're not ashamed I'm gonna raise my
[2:01:02] god because I have had a victory take
[2:01:06] place in life
[2:01:08] praise Allah there's an internal victory
[2:01:12] no the greatest victories of the
[2:01:13] internal victories she didn't even have
[2:01:16] a baby yet yeah but she's got a victory
[2:01:18] [Applause]
[2:01:22] don't promise but she's changed
[2:01:25] that change of the body yet but she's
[2:01:28] changed she hasn't even been with her
[2:01:30] husband they even went home yet
[2:01:31] nothing's happened that way but she
[2:01:33] she's the one that's changed
[2:01:35] she's worshiping as if it's already
[2:01:38] happened
[2:01:41] she's worshiping as if she's already
[2:01:44] there didn't brother Brown say that we
[2:01:47] ought to worship in these temples as if
[2:01:49] we're already in that other temple over
[2:01:51] there I'll tell you that's the worship
[2:01:54] God likes to see I'm coming in with my
[2:01:56] trials I'm coming in with my things for
[2:01:58] the week I'm coming with people speaking
[2:02:00] against me my boss is all over me all
[2:02:02] this stuff happening my finances
[2:02:04] everything else but I'm coming to the
[2:02:05] house of the Lord and I'm going to
[2:02:07] worship as if none of that is going on
[2:02:11] it's an attitude it's a change in
[2:02:14] attitude
[2:02:15] oh and I'd love to talk about how that
[2:02:18] she she comes every year and she maybe
[2:02:20] has a special but when she sings
[2:02:22] especial every year temple it's the same
[2:02:24] special every year and it's depressing
[2:02:26] because their spirits depressed so every
[2:02:28] year she has the same special and people
[2:02:30] look at her say but this year this year
[2:02:32] when she came her special changed you
[2:02:35] say man every year they had to hear the
[2:02:38] same song every year and it was called
[2:02:41] woe is me sister Hanna could you come up
[2:02:46] and sing a special for us this year and
[2:02:48] everybody's going oh boy Oh Lord not
[2:02:54] sister Hanna and not because they know
[2:02:56] she got sing the same special she got
[2:02:58] such a cloud over that she just she just
[2:03:00] kills the whole service please don't let
[2:03:05] her sing it's gonna be the same song it
[2:03:07] was every year she gets up give me the
[2:03:09] key sister give her the key woe is me
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:21] it's real creative lyrics woe is me I am
[2:03:27] down and brokenhearted I know he loves
[2:03:33] me but woe is me
[2:03:38] same song every year I just made that
[2:03:41] one up just now I'm a songwriter not
[2:03:47] very creative but woe was me the same
[2:03:51] song but this year after Eli said new
[2:03:54] year you're drunk
[2:03:55] what you're drunk she says I am not
[2:03:57] drunk but I have poured out my heart to
[2:03:59] the Lord
[2:04:00] so she said the Eli don't accuse me of
[2:04:03] being drunk isn't this like the day of
[2:04:05] Pentecost didn't they say they're as
[2:04:08] drunk men so the promise of God for that
[2:04:12] hour had been fulfilled and what's
[2:04:14] happening in them and they come like
[2:04:16] drunk men out of that upper room a
[2:04:19] victory had happened can you say this
[2:04:21] promise was fulfilled and so they come
[2:04:23] out of their drunken he says is Eli says
[2:04:25] this woman's drunk no I'm not drunk but
[2:04:28] I poured out my spirit to the Lord and
[2:04:30] God's done something for me this year
[2:04:31] there's a change in my heart what do you
[2:04:34] have a baby yet no I don't have the baby
[2:04:36] yet but something's changed in me
[2:04:39] and he Eli I want to sing a special

[2:05:26] aloud so he says I could never say that
[2:05:29] to my church anyway I like it loud turn
[2:05:33] it up
[2:05:33] Gio said nobody's expecting what was me
[2:05:35] and she victory is mine victory is mine
[2:05:42] victory today is my she don't have a
[2:05:47] baby yet
[2:05:47] but I told Satan to get the victory too
[2:05:55] is my joy is my gorge oh yes ma'am yeah
[2:06:05] [Applause]
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:07] well toad Satan to get thee behind Joe
[2:06:14] today his mind
[2:06:20] praise God Hanna do you have a baby yet
[2:06:24] no but victory today is mine and when
[2:06:30] she started to sing that friends that
[2:06:31] whole audience said what happened to
[2:06:33] Hanna she's a changed woman what in the
[2:06:38] world's going on she had a little change
[2:06:39] happening
[2:06:40] [Applause]
[2:06:42] she didn't care what people thought
[2:06:43] after that she didn't care what people
[2:06:46] thought she was gonna worship God her
[2:06:48] attitude changed her melody had changed
[2:06:52] everything changed within her heart and
[2:06:54] she didn't have a baby yet and that
[2:06:56] reminds me of something brother Branham
[2:06:58] said I like to study the prayer lines
[2:06:59] because we learned something in those
[2:07:01] prayer lines not just that God is a
[2:07:03] mighty healer and can heal heal every
[2:07:06] disease raise the dead open up the blind
[2:07:09] I see you still do it today but the
[2:07:11] healing campaigns if you listen to the
[2:07:13] prayer line you watch how the Holy
[2:07:14] Spirit deals with each person and I
[2:07:16] learned something from those if you're
[2:07:18] listening you learn how the Holy Spirit
[2:07:19] deals with an individual he still deals
[2:07:21] the same way and you see now one thing
[2:07:23] that brother Brown said is they come up
[2:07:24] many times do you say he'd pray for them
[2:07:27] and he says now go on your way rejoicing
[2:07:30] and be happy I love that go on your way
[2:07:38] now rejoicing and be happy now sometimes
[2:07:42] they were healed instantly I'm a miracle
[2:07:45] but sometimes they weren't healed yet
[2:07:47] but they were gonna get their healing
[2:07:48] brother Adam knew they had to keep their
[2:07:50] confession right and he says you don't
[2:07:53] hold your faith it'll come back on you
[2:07:55] again so he's teaching the people go on
[2:07:58] your way rejoicing be happy don't let
[2:08:01] the devil talk to you don't look at the
[2:08:03] symptoms you see God wanted us to act
[2:08:06] the right way even if we don't have our
[2:08:09] healing yet he wants us to rejoice as if
[2:08:12] we've already got it
[2:08:15] he wants us to have the right attitude
[2:08:18] go on your way rejoicing and be happy
[2:08:22] some people didn't do that they're going
[2:08:24] back to that depression went back to
[2:08:26] complaining oh I still feel it no no no
[2:08:28] no no no no no be happy claim the
[2:08:32] victory claim the promise of mine it's a
[2:08:34] prophet teaching us how to live as
[2:08:36] Christians that God does not want you to
[2:08:38] be happy after he gives you the miracle
[2:08:41] God wants you to be happy now praise the
[2:08:47] Lord
[2:08:47] all right I'm done with my special hand
[2:08:52] I just brought the house down that
[2:08:54] Sunday I'm telling you the place come
[2:08:56] unglued she started a revival in her own
[2:08:59] church you don't think you think when
[2:09:06] I'm preaching boy you're giving yourself
[2:09:07] a license to say look at this look at
[2:09:09] verse 18 and she said let thine handmaid
[2:09:13] find grace I'm in first chapter 1 4:18
[2:09:15] so so I'm just letting you know I'm not
[2:09:17] off my rocker here I said in the Bible
[2:09:19] and she said let thy handmaid find Grace
[2:09:22] and I say so the woman went her way and
[2:09:24] did eat and her countenance was no more
[2:09:29] sad so that tells us every year at
[2:09:37] church her countenance was sad but now
[2:09:42] she has no baby yet she has no promise
[2:09:45] yet but her countenance is no longer sad
[2:09:48] now that's the right attitude God's
[2:09:50] looking for God looking at Joshua and
[2:09:53] Caleb and he's looking for the faith of
[2:09:55] Joshua and Caleb come back and here's
[2:09:57] all the bet evil reports and to rise up
[2:10:00] and say wait a minute
[2:10:01] everybody shut up quit talking negative
[2:10:03] we're more than able to take a life
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:07] God perks up his attention say that's
[2:10:10] what I want to hear that's what I got
[2:10:13] here right there yeah it perks up God's
[2:10:16] attention there into the land yet they
[2:10:18] haven't overcome anything yet but it's
[2:10:19] the attitude he's looking for able to
[2:10:24] take this I don't care about the Giants
[2:10:26] I don't care about the Wilson it doesn't
[2:10:27] matter God's giving us the promise we're
[2:10:29] going forward please be to God I know
[2:10:34] this is a simple message here tonight
[2:10:36] but I pray you're taking this from the
[2:10:37] Lord there's a little change needed in
[2:10:41] our lives just a little change maybe
[2:10:46] that'll bring the big change
[2:10:47] how many wants the big change we got to
[2:10:51] be willing say Lord changed me in the
[2:10:52] little thing praise God we want to get
[2:10:56] out of this earth can you say man what a
[2:10:58] new body praise the Lord
[2:11:00] here was a greater step of humility and
[2:11:03] unselfishness
[2:11:04] remember that this is a greater step in
[2:11:06] humility and unselfishness you'll find
[2:11:09] it throughout the women of the Bible who
[2:11:11] come to God's promise she's not thinking
[2:11:13] of herself no more listen when she said
[2:11:15] that say Lord I'll give it back to you
[2:11:16] where did that inspiration come from you
[2:11:20] think he came from herself where did the
[2:11:23] inspiration come from to ask for that
[2:11:25] child but to say I'll give it back to
[2:11:27] you she tapped into God's desire and
[2:11:31] God's predestinated plan
[2:11:33] she couldn't even ask for that they said
[2:11:35] she tapped into inspiration she tapped
[2:11:39] into God's plan she tapped into God's
[2:11:42] desire and purpose with his child she
[2:11:44] dies to her selfish motives and puts her
[2:11:46] design remember awesome at maturity last
[2:11:48] night this is one segment of it maturity
[2:11:51] is dying to our selfishness
[2:11:54] being self focused it's about me it's
[2:11:58] about my prayer requests is about my
[2:12:00] ministry all of us preachers got died of
[2:12:04] that not about us it's about others it's
[2:12:10] about his kingdom how can I serve his
[2:12:13] kingdom if my gift helps his kingdom
[2:12:15] great but if it doesn't get used no
[2:12:17] problem I'm serving his kingdom I want
[2:12:20] to see other people blessed who she made
[2:12:22] this decision for other people I'm
[2:12:24] giving up this child to serve in the
[2:12:25] house of the Lord and becomes a prophet
[2:12:28] I'm gonna add this in so I don't forget
[2:12:30] it
[2:12:31] do you know later god bless her with
[2:12:32] three sons and daughters so when we give
[2:12:37] to the Lord we live by the promise of
[2:12:41] the hour with the right attitude he can
[2:12:43] come around and give you the desires of
[2:12:45] your heart
[2:12:47] so she got a baby three of them three
[2:12:50] boys to take home with her and to hold
[2:12:53] and to raise can you say Amen three boys
[2:12:58] right brother Mark you got three boys
[2:13:00] three boys to take home of her own and
[2:13:02] she raised him she got blessed but first
[2:13:05] she had to have changed in her attitude
[2:13:08] changing her humility the inspiration
[2:13:11] came from the predestinated plan of God
[2:13:12] she dies to herself as mojin puts her
[2:13:15] desire in god's channel this child was
[2:13:17] to be a prophet and had to be dedicated
[2:13:19] that way so the thing holding this up
[2:13:21] was hannah needing her desire to go to
[2:13:24] the depth of submission and to lose all
[2:13:27] of her selfishness the other women did
[2:13:30] not have to have this level of humility
[2:13:34] don't expect it from others like brother
[2:13:37] Bram says if you're waiting for the
[2:13:39] church to have a revival don't sit
[2:13:40] around and wait for someone else to
[2:13:42] start it said let it begin in you
[2:13:45] and it'll spread out to other places
[2:13:48] don't sit around away for the church to
[2:13:50] have a revival let it begin in you and
[2:13:55] it'll spread out to other places what
[2:14:00] the truth that is we are not the same
[2:14:01] don't compare yourself the other wife
[2:14:04] was not called to this level of humility
[2:14:07] so don't look for it in other people we
[2:14:10] will talk about that in the morning a
[2:14:11] little bit don't look it for it in other
[2:14:13] people but what is God trying to do in
[2:14:15] you this is an individual revival it's
[2:14:19] not a national revival it's not a church
[2:14:21] revival it's an individual revival
[2:14:24] praise be to God her attitude change and
[2:14:28] her provoke her was gone her oppressor
[2:14:30] was gone can you say man her countenance
[2:14:32] was no longer sad I'll tell your friends
[2:14:35] just put a smile on your face boy the
[2:14:39] pastor would go crazy and preach like
[2:14:42] fire if people came to church with just
[2:14:44] a better countenance that their faith
[2:14:49] said that they wanted to be there I'll
[2:14:53] say it like my dad some Christians come
[2:14:55] to church and their faith looks like
[2:14:56] they've been baptized in prune juice so
[2:15:01] he says and he says if you're happy
[2:15:05] notify your face
[2:15:10] christians christians look just
[2:15:13] destroyed was me oh listen if you can't
[2:15:18] change your heart yet and you're still
[2:15:19] waiting god to change your heart just
[2:15:21] change your face just start there can
[2:15:27] you say man
[2:15:29] praise the Lord says Moses when he
[2:15:32] looked into the glory of the Lord that
[2:15:34] his countenance was changed can you say
[2:15:37] man I don't know all the happiness
[2:15:39] countenance was says now after Calvary
[2:15:41] that same glory that changed his face in
[2:15:44] his countenance
[2:15:45] that same glory now after Calvary could
[2:15:47] come and change the soul of man and kill
[2:15:50] the serpent nature and change the soul
[2:15:53] of man but it couldn't do it before
[2:15:55] Calvary so all it could change was his
[2:15:57] countenance and I've said to my people
[2:16:01] before I would love it if the glory of
[2:16:03] the Lord would just change your face
[2:16:04] first
[2:16:06] it changed Moses face let's start there
[2:16:10] [Applause]
[2:16:12] let's start there on Sunday mornings

[2:16:20] Amen I hope you're having as good a time
[2:16:22] as I in this the Word of God it's our
[2:16:27] place is our position and she no longer
[2:16:30] had a sad countenance upon her face but
[2:16:33] something changed her in pastor's boy if
[2:16:35] we could see people to come to church
[2:16:37] this way you don't have to be somebody
[2:16:39] that you're not you can't be all
[2:16:41] different brothers and try to be
[2:16:42] somebody and you know the loud
[2:16:44] hallelujah is the loud Holly Louise from
[2:16:46] our dear brother here it's it's
[2:16:50] wonderful I mean but you don't have to
[2:16:52] try to be him he's got to be him but
[2:16:55] it's a distinctive loud hallelujah and
[2:16:58] I'm glad he does it because I'll know
[2:17:01] where to find him on the other side no

[2:17:17] not trying to rouse something up here
[2:17:18] tonight I'm trying to make something
[2:17:20] difference but I want to say Lord I'm
[2:17:21] saying Lord change the people that their
[2:17:23] change their attitude then we can
[2:17:27] approach the Lord with the right
[2:17:28] attitude and a happy attitude I'm happy
[2:17:32] to be a Christian I'm happy to be here
[2:17:34] and I want to hear whatever the word has
[2:17:36] for me in this Wednesday night whatever
[2:17:38] night it is I'm happy to hear it take it
[2:17:41] latch on to it
[2:17:42] I'm waiting for this promise to come to
[2:17:44] pass in my life amen her countenance was
[2:17:50] no longer sad she Heba had a deeper joy
[2:17:53] and a deeper humility with all this she
[2:17:55] went home and knew what happened she
[2:17:57] went home and conceived the promised
[2:18:01] King God opened her womb she conceived I
[2:18:07] love the Lord tonight pull that quote up
[2:18:11] brothers listen to this now and this
[2:18:13] gels it all together now this is in the
[2:18:16] message humble thyself 1963 this is
[2:18:21] after the seals and I would just say
[2:18:22] something about this okay I'm gonna just
[2:18:24] preface this a little bit I like when I
[2:18:28] study the things of God's done in this
[2:18:30] generation it's not just that it's
[2:18:32] Elijah's spirit that would restore all
[2:18:34] truths that were lost through the church
[2:18:36] ages he said he'd send Elijah to restore
[2:18:39] all things okay so we know that he done
[2:18:43] that according to his word restored all
[2:18:46] truths that all the loose ins all the
[2:18:48] reformers everything couldn't do it it
[2:18:50] took a prophet to do it so they preached
[2:18:51] a little truce but the Prophet gathers
[2:18:53] them all together at the end time
[2:18:54] restores us back to truth what happened
[2:18:56] in the garden how many gods is there you
[2:18:59] see but you see there's more to me to
[2:19:03] the messages more to that because I
[2:19:05] watch what God does personally to this
[2:19:11] brother brother Branham that is growing
[2:19:15] in this revelation and growing in the
[2:19:18] Lord and coming to his adoption I'm
[2:19:21] watching how God deals with him so if
[2:19:23] you're really a study of it you'll see
[2:19:25] certain things take place I'm gonna
[2:19:26] mention one to you and he mentions that
[2:19:28] after the seals he mentioned the message
[2:19:30] standing in the gap he mentions it in
[2:19:32] this humble thyself and then he further
[2:19:34] elaborates on it in Shalom it's not
[2:19:36] doctrinal things okay I'm not you get
[2:19:40] taught well enough that here but this is
[2:19:42] something that happened personal in
[2:19:44] brother brems life before the seals he
[2:19:47] started to get a complex speaks about
[2:19:49] understanding the gap he had developed a
[2:19:51] complex for the people who's preaching -
[2:19:53] and they weren't getting it and weren't
[2:19:55] every year I come back they get worse he
[2:19:57] started blasting calling them Ricky's
[2:19:59] and Rick Etta's and so he was doing
[2:20:02] those things and he actually had
[2:20:04] internally this was happening too he
[2:20:05] developed a complex against and he lost
[2:20:08] his feeling for the people everybody
[2:20:11] knows what I'm talking about this is
[2:20:12] happening personally in brother brems
[2:20:14] life he he was still a prophet he still
[2:20:16] preached the seals got the lamb broke
[2:20:19] the seal spoke him through his probably
[2:20:20] all this was happening but did you know
[2:20:22] while that's going on he's dealing with
[2:20:24] an internal thing of he's grown a
[2:20:26] complex almost ready to leave the field
[2:20:28] because there's I going in preaching
[2:20:30] every year and I see these short dresses
[2:20:32] I see all yeah I see all this coming
[2:20:34] back I see all this worldliness it
[2:20:36] continues to come in what's the use of
[2:20:38] even trying and when God shows him it
[2:20:41] wasn't the problem so much with
[2:20:43] criticizing them he had developed an
[2:20:46] attitude now all that was true there was
[2:20:47] people rejecting the word there was
[2:20:49] people who come back every year they
[2:20:50] wouldn't take go on with the word the
[2:20:53] problem wasn't with them that's gonna
[2:20:54] happen but he had changed his feeling
[2:20:59] and I'm here to tell you that he was
[2:21:01] dealing this through the seals because
[2:21:03] just after the seals then he preaches
[2:21:05] standing in the gap he catches a
[2:21:07] revelation of Moses God's people
[2:21:09] complaining and Moses stands in the gap
[2:21:13] like Christ if somebody doesn't stand
[2:21:14] the gap for those people they're acting
[2:21:16] ignorant they're acting they're acting
[2:21:18] against God they're complaining if
[2:21:20] somebody doesn't get ahold of Christ and
[2:21:21] stand in the gap there's no hope for him
[2:21:24] so he concludes by saying if I've lost
[2:21:28] my feeling for the people I've got to
[2:21:30] get over this or I can't help God's
[2:21:31] people properly I've got to overcome
[2:21:34] this you know find all this in the
[2:21:37] message standing in the gap and so he
[2:21:39] personally and when he comes saying he
[2:21:40] come to a personal victory himself he
[2:21:43] says I want that feeling back to the
[2:21:44] people he said and I'll let him explain
[2:21:47] it to you but then when stand in the gap
[2:21:49] he explains it and he says something
[2:21:52] about the feeling of the people and then
[2:21:55] I'm gonna jump to the Shalom I'm taking
[2:21:58] a lot of time tonight is it okay
[2:22:01] in in 1964 in shalom in that message he
[2:22:06] god breaks to him that this darkness
[2:22:09] that covers the earth while God is
[2:22:11] getting ready to shine the greatest
[2:22:12] light it's the worst darkness and it's
[2:22:14] gross darkness upon the people it says
[2:22:17] so he begins to describe the people and
[2:22:21] and as he describes him he said they're
[2:22:23] getting a worse and worse State and he's
[2:22:25] talking about a lot of Christians he's
[2:22:26] going to preach to their state gets
[2:22:28] worse and he says it's because gross
[2:22:30] darkness is upon the people and he
[2:22:34] starts making a comment he refers to
[2:22:37] Jesus saying for forgive them father for
[2:22:43] they know not what they do
[2:22:45] and he says I'm convinced friends he
[2:22:48] says these people they they want to be
[2:22:51] children of God they want to serve God
[2:22:53] but they've been so hindered by the
[2:22:55] denominational ideas and he explains
[2:22:57] this as saying that the darkness is
[2:22:59] hindering them so now that's true and
[2:23:01] that's a bad thing the darkness hindered
[2:23:03] him they hold back their rebellious to
[2:23:05] the Lord whatever it is that's fine but
[2:23:07] you see that can be happening but our
[2:23:09] attitude towards that is what brother
[2:23:12] Branham was being corrected on you know
[2:23:16] he preached the message 65 North it not
[2:23:19] he took the layout of scene age is the
[2:23:22] first time I've ever presented these
[2:23:23] things here this kiss came fresh today
[2:23:26] he takes knoweth it not but we know the
[2:23:30] Laodicean Church age he takes that he
[2:23:32] says because in the latest in age
[2:23:33] they're blind they're naked help me out
[2:23:37] they got all the characteristics of that
[2:23:39] church but they don't know it and
[2:23:41] knoweth it not that's the darkness
[2:23:46] because they want to do right but
[2:23:48] something keeps them from doing right
[2:23:49] now that's quite a way to look at it
[2:23:51] because you can be critical and say now
[2:23:53] they need to get themselves straightened
[2:23:55] out and just they're a bunch of Ricky's
[2:23:56] out there and just but you see now he's
[2:23:59] seen it deeper to see they want to do
[2:24:01] right but the darkness is holding them
[2:24:03] back
[2:24:04] should be the grace of God that God
[2:24:07] removed that darkness and shine light
[2:24:08] they come that's up to God but our
[2:24:10] attitude can't be this Ricky Rick enand
[2:24:13] he had the rebellious to the word he was
[2:24:15] seeing it deeper to say we're under a
[2:24:17] darkness that they don't even know what
[2:24:19] they're doing and then quoted in Shalom
[2:24:22] Jesus at the cross at the last hour he's
[2:24:25] saying Father forgive them at the last
[2:24:38] hour he's looking at these people
[2:24:40] crucifying him but he's saying he's the
[2:24:44] standing in the gap to the Father God
[2:24:47] forgives them because they don't know
[2:24:51] what they're doing I know what they're
[2:24:54] doing father you know what they're doing
[2:24:56] but they don't know what they're doing
[2:25:01] what an attitude
[2:25:04] what an approach to people that are
[2:25:08] rebellious what an approach to people
[2:25:11] who are rejecting this message what an
[2:25:14] approach to people who have been in the
[2:25:16] message and left it
[2:25:18] what good are we if we get up and just
[2:25:21] fight back at him it doesn't do any good
[2:25:22] I'm gonna try to intellectually get them
[2:25:25] back in the message that's just a waste
[2:25:26] of time
[2:25:27] what we need is the character of Christ
[2:25:29] shown that they see something deeper
[2:25:31] enough I'm just so mu Father forgive
[2:25:38] them they don't know what they're doing
[2:25:40] he quotes it in Shalom looking at that
[2:25:44] darkness and he says I've been wrong to
[2:25:46] call them Rickey's and Raquette --is God
[2:25:51] showed me I was wrong to call them that
[2:25:54] prophets being corrected in his attitude
[2:25:57] after the seals you don't have to say
[2:26:04] amen to that I know I'm presenting some
[2:26:07] things here to think about but God's
[2:26:11] correcting his son and maturing his son
[2:26:13] after the seals so it's wonderful and
[2:26:21] did he go on in 64 and 65 and say Rick
[2:26:24] Etta's and Ricky's still yep does that
[2:26:30] mean he wasn't changing no I believe
[2:26:31] it's changed his heart changed and when
[2:26:34] he's blasting those things it's not a
[2:26:36] personal thing to go against those
[2:26:37] people he has to call things what they
[2:26:39] are he's Elijah but personally his
[2:26:43] spirit changed towards them
[2:26:47] can you say mad so I'm trying to be
[2:26:50] honest is that he went on and said that
[2:26:51] a few times did you see now by the Lord
[2:26:54] correcting him his spirit had to change
[2:26:56] about it because when he would say it
[2:26:58] before there was something tainted in
[2:27:00] his spirit - I'm gonna blast out this
[2:27:03] you know preachers can do that they can
[2:27:05] preach the message but project the wrong
[2:27:06] spirit and that's when I preach about
[2:27:11] maturity we need ministry and we need
[2:27:13] the people of God to not just have the
[2:27:15] message but project the right spirit
[2:27:18] it's been people sent message churches
[2:27:21] for years and they're hearing the quotes
[2:27:22] and they're hearing the message but the
[2:27:24] spirit that's coming across the spoke
[2:27:25] but sometimes is Nicolay attend
[2:27:27] sometimes there's a complex sometimes
[2:27:29] it's control over the people it's all
[2:27:31] kinds of other motives we need to purify
[2:27:33] ourselves of all other agendas all other
[2:27:36] motives get under the Holy Ghost get
[2:27:38] under humility preach the power of God
[2:27:40] to the people through this word let this
[2:27:47] message do what it was meant to do
[2:27:49] nothing attached to it no agendas to it
[2:27:52] no cry can you say men not blasting the
[2:27:55] people personally because of your anger
[2:27:57] your anger will not change God's people
[2:28:00] I'm not even angry tonight except that
[2:28:02] the devil I'm not angry you and I yell
[2:28:04] like this I'm burdened in my heart
[2:28:07] god help us the mature as believers that
[2:28:15] this message can produce what it was
[2:28:17] meant to produce for the Gerald thank
[2:28:20] God for a faithful man but I want to
[2:28:24] grow as a minister not just the
[2:28:25] corrugation I want to grow it took me
[2:28:28] that long to come to this quote you got
[2:28:29] the quote took me that long to set up
[2:28:33] that quote you get it though you know
[2:28:36] it's a personal thing standing there is
[2:28:38] a personal thing going on and Shalom he
[2:28:41] gets the answer forgive them probably
[2:28:42] forgive them they know not what they do
[2:28:45] now he says that to the seals he said
[2:28:47] now it's and this is a little it's not
[2:28:49] even a sermon it's just humbled myself
[2:28:51] he's just talking to the people notice
[2:28:53] humble thyself it's my time for
[2:28:56] consecration to God God's time to speak
[2:28:59] to me I must just have a little change
[2:29:02] in my own life
[2:29:04] somebody said prays alone now this is
[2:29:08] after the seals of the seals have been
[2:29:09] preached that the book of redemption has
[2:29:11] been open to the bride and he's saying
[2:29:14] personally but I need a little change in
[2:29:17] my own life and he's gonna explain what
[2:29:19] it is I need a little change in my own
[2:29:21] life not as I think that I am wicked but
[2:29:24] but I want to feel a little more closer
[2:29:27] to people you see the people that I've
[2:29:30] tried to tell this gospel truth to and
[2:29:32] they turned their back on it and walk
[2:29:34] away and laugh at it now to me that
[2:29:36] seems like an insult I don't care to me
[2:29:40] but to the things that I've been saying
[2:29:42] it's the truth trying to help them like
[2:29:44] shoving on a boat and say here here it
[2:29:46] is cross over here get out of that
[2:29:49] swirling stream you're gonna die you're
[2:29:51] going to Paris there and they just laugh
[2:29:53] at you and walk away well to me it feels
[2:29:55] like is they walk away there's nothing
[2:29:57] more I can do about it you see nothing
[2:30:00] more I can do but I want to run down the
[2:30:03] bank now and persuade them come on back
[2:30:11] he's changing there's a little change
[2:30:15] happening in him
[2:30:16] he's explaining the change he wants to
[2:30:18] see I want to go down and and and
[2:30:21] welcome them back or say come on back
[2:30:25] see I've got to have that feeling you
[2:30:28] see because I know there's something out
[2:30:31] there that hasn't come in yet
[2:30:33] you see I'm gonna fish till you see he
[2:30:36] said until the last fish is caught oh so
[2:30:41] much of this us for no more the message
[2:30:44] then they start setting dates when the
[2:30:46] door was closed and it's always when
[2:30:48] after they got in everybody everybody
[2:30:53] ever noticed when they set a date that
[2:30:54] the door that the Lambs off the mercy
[2:30:56] seat and the doors the doors been shut
[2:30:58] it's always after they got in it's
[2:31:03] interesting he said I want to he said
[2:31:07] I'm expecting something happen and and
[2:31:09] he said I want to do that now in order
[2:31:11] to do this I'm expecting something to
[2:31:13] happen in the Permian something and many
[2:31:15] of you remember the vision of the last
[2:31:17] poll that third poll rather you remember
[2:31:19] there was something happened just before
[2:31:22] that I seen that light come and go down
[2:31:25] into that place and said I'll meet you
[2:31:29] in there
[2:31:30] he's time together humble thyself he's
[2:31:33] tying together this thing in a price
[2:31:35] that he needs to get to to the third
[2:31:37] Pole in that little room that's why he
[2:31:42] says that message Intervale he says you
[2:31:45] got to find your secret place your
[2:31:48] secret place
[2:31:50] that little room is there some physical
[2:31:53] tent somewhere this is a tent vision
[2:31:56] Moses had a tent vision
[2:31:59] it's very biblical tent vision Moses
[2:32:02] added attentiveness had three parts to
[2:32:04] them God's 10 and this hour has three
[2:32:08] parts to it that's us the outer court to
[2:32:11] enter court the inner veil so what's the
[2:32:14] little root so finding your secret place
[2:32:17] it's a deeper walk it's a deeper thing
[2:32:19] it's a deeper love it's a victory in
[2:32:21] divine love he's coming to his victory
[2:32:25] in divine love personally he's coming to
[2:32:28] his adoption his victory in divine
[2:32:33] another place in humble thyself he says
[2:32:36] if we really want to see the third pole
[2:32:39] do something among us then he says we
[2:32:41] need to humble ourselves that was his
[2:32:45] answer we need to help our stars I'll
[2:32:48] tell you friends that's powerful if you
[2:32:52] didn't get anything else you can get
[2:32:53] brother Graham saying after the seals I
[2:32:55] just need a little change in my own life
[2:32:58] I need a consecration to God I need a I
[2:33:02] need time to God to speak to me well
[2:33:04] hasn't God
[2:33:05] has it God spoke through his seals but
[2:33:08] we're not stopping there parsley we're
[2:33:11] saying I need God to speak to me it's
[2:33:14] the personal thing as a church as the
[2:33:17] bride the seals were open dispensation
[2:33:20] leaf or the bride but you see those
[2:33:22] things have to break to you personally
[2:33:24] it's a personal revival and then God
[2:33:28] takes you through those little things
[2:33:29] like you did Hannah to bring you to a
[2:33:31] place of deeper humility a greater depth
[2:33:34] of human greater a better attitude this
[2:33:37] forgiveness this victory of divine love
[2:33:39] is anybody catching this mature love
[2:33:43] eternity we got the word but we need the
[2:33:46] maturity to handle the world
[2:33:48] that's why he could say this bride she
[2:33:50] knows what he wants done with the word
[2:33:53] can you say that's prophecy saying she
[2:33:56] knows what he wants done with it
[2:33:57] she has word but she knows what he wants
[2:33:59] done with it that's important to excuse
[2:34:03] me because people have handled the word
[2:34:05] wrong for many years got the message but
[2:34:07] handled it wrong
[2:34:09] lack of divine love oh my praise the
[2:34:14] Lord well I'm done with Hannah I don't
[2:34:17] know whether to go on with Esther or not
[2:34:19] praise the Lord
[2:34:22] he's taking the clock down I knew he was
[2:34:27] gonna do that he's headed out to get the
[2:34:30] road ball you want me to go on just a
[2:34:34] little bit sure
[2:34:35] I know some of you're a little tired but
[2:34:39] but you know we're here and I'm all the
[2:34:41] way you know so many thousand miles away
[2:34:44] from my home I don't have anywhere else
[2:34:45] to go
[2:34:46] I wouldn't know where to go I'd get lost
[2:34:50] it's getting cold out there tonight yeah
[2:34:53] I hear you got bears so I can I'd rather
[2:34:57] just keep preaching praise the Lord
[2:35:03] so let me just let me do a brief the
[2:35:06] summer here and just bring Esther in if
[2:35:07] that's okay with you and I'm not gonna
[2:35:10] go read the scripture because you know
[2:35:11] the story of Esther but I want to refer
[2:35:13] to this other woman because Esther was
[2:35:16] the last person you would think to be
[2:35:18] chosen in that day he was the last
[2:35:21] person to be chosen by the by the
[2:35:24] Gentile King to be the Queen last person
[2:35:27] that speaks of our lives were the last
[2:35:29] to be chosen can you say man we don't
[2:35:32] need some of us don't even know why
[2:35:34] we're sitting here tonight you were
[2:35:37] voted most most likely to not succeed
[2:35:42] losers can you say that yeah of all
[2:35:45] places in the world you shouldn't be
[2:35:46] sitting here tonight called and chosen
[2:35:48] by God has to be the bride of Jesus
[2:35:51] Christ
[2:35:52] you see voted least likely to succeed in
[2:35:55] class probably and all the thing in all
[2:35:58] your past and yet you're here tonight
[2:35:59] and Esther felt that way is what's
[2:36:02] happening here I'm chosen and she rises
[2:36:05] to the place to be in tight now the
[2:36:07] Queen the the wife of the King because
[2:36:11] the work first wife had rejected him and
[2:36:13] now he's gonna choose a bride
[2:36:16] Esther being a Jew she's the chosen
[2:36:19] person and yet she was chosen by the
[2:36:22] king and finally jumpin head after going
[2:36:26] through the process finally she stood
[2:36:28] there one day living in the palace of
[2:36:32] the king he's calling her bride because
[2:36:37] she's the bride now she's been married
[2:36:39] to him she's there in her own little
[2:36:41] Palace suffered The Passion of the King
[2:36:43] but she's there she's in her position
[2:36:47] all was going fine she was calling
[2:36:51] yourself bride the King was calling her
[2:36:53] by I think of this about the last 50
[2:36:55] years and the message God has been
[2:36:57] speaking to his bride calling you bride
[2:36:59] you know your bride tonight she's
[2:37:03] sitting there and they're all is fine as
[2:37:05] far as being favored by the king just
[2:37:08] like Alcon his wife she's doubly blessed
[2:37:11] she's the bride there's no question
[2:37:12] about that nothing could change that now
[2:37:16] but she had an enemy she had a tormentor
[2:37:21] she had something rise up against her
[2:37:24] and so now this Haman this haman the
[2:37:29] agagite is what it's called
[2:37:31] I call it agitate comes from the root
[2:37:36] word agitate I'm just gonna call it that
[2:37:38] that's the root word Agra gite was his
[2:37:40] name but he's an agitator
[2:37:42] he's an oppressor and Haman begin to
[2:37:45] agitate and she had an enemy just like
[2:37:46] Hanna had an enemy and impress her and
[2:37:49] so a tormentor and so he had a jealous
[2:37:52] spirit and further hated the true people
[2:37:55] of God the Jews hated the Jews and the
[2:37:58] chosen people of God he hated them he
[2:38:00] detested them and there wasn't really a
[2:38:04] reason like in the days of Nehemiah that
[2:38:07] samulet and Tobiah were against Nehemiah
[2:38:10] building the temple they were just
[2:38:13] getting done do you really say why they
[2:38:14] were against him it's just a spirit
[2:38:15] against them the bride is gonna have
[2:38:17] this so we see religious brother brems
[2:38:21] saying two million two hundred thousand
[2:38:23] thousand demons released from the river
[2:38:25] Euphrates against the bride can you say
[2:38:29] man religious demons who hate and seek
[2:38:32] to kill the true elect just like they
[2:38:34] sought to kill the Jews but you see now
[2:38:38] Esther she come under this pressure of
[2:38:41] Haman and as soon as she come into her
[2:38:44] position as bride as soon as she come
[2:38:47] into that place that's when this
[2:38:49] agitation begin to rise and a minion
[2:38:51] derives speaks of our lives can you say
[2:38:53] Amen you didn't have too much trouble
[2:38:55] until you come in your position as I'm a
[2:38:57] southern daughter of God
[2:39:00] can you say man then you get this
[2:39:02] agitated rising up that hates you he
[2:39:05] loved you when you were in the world he
[2:39:07] loved you when you're out there partying
[2:39:09] you'd make a stand as the Son of God now
[2:39:11] you got a haven against you
[2:39:13] Astra had it hey man what'd she come
[2:39:15] into her position she had an enemy and
[2:39:17] as soon as she come into that there was
[2:39:19] an increase in pressure from her enemy
[2:39:21] and it kept getting worse the bride of
[2:39:23] Jesus Christ as she's grown in the Word
[2:39:25] of God and if she's been taken hold of
[2:39:27] her position in the Word of God the
[2:39:29] pressure has only increased on the true
[2:39:31] by - Jesus Christ through all kinds of
[2:39:33] different channels on the internet and
[2:39:36] people leaving the message and got all
[2:39:37] kinds of things against it
[2:39:38] the devil is working everywhere because
[2:39:41] he hates this message and he hates the
[2:39:43] people that believes it it's Satan it's
[2:39:46] not the brother it's Satan listen now
[2:39:49] try to bring this to a close she just
[2:39:52] like Hannah had to humble herself to
[2:39:56] come before the King Esther had to find
[2:40:01] a deeper level of humility in order for
[2:40:05] the promise to come to pass she's in the
[2:40:08] palace
[2:40:08] she's bribed but there was a little
[2:40:10] change needed and Esther can you say man
[2:40:13] there was nothing to change needed it
[2:40:15] was a change and so she had she could be
[2:40:18] comfortable there and she could be
[2:40:19] selfish there and say I'm the bride I'm
[2:40:21] into my son's Church and I got my
[2:40:23] message books and but you see now she
[2:40:25] was positioned for more than that my God
[2:40:29] had a great preference for that woman to
[2:40:30] be in the position she was in redemption
[2:40:34] was going to happen for that woman for
[2:40:36] all of her people
[2:40:37] it was going to come through Esther how
[2:40:39] powerful thing was that God's purpose
[2:40:42] was deeper than her just to sit in the
[2:40:44] palace and a message church and just
[2:40:46] keep hearing the king's word there was a
[2:40:47] deeper purpose and I'm gonna tell you
[2:40:49] tonight young people are there's a
[2:40:51] deeper purpose for your life it's not
[2:40:54] just to sit around and hear the word but
[2:40:56] we become living epistles of the Word of
[2:40:58] God
[2:40:59] we're positioned in this process of
[2:41:01] redemption Astra had a great thing there
[2:41:04] but she before she came to it she had to
[2:41:07] humble herself to come before the king
[2:41:09] even it was gonna be death if she did
[2:41:10] that and in order to do it she had to
[2:41:13] die to her selfishness because she could
[2:41:15] have stayed there as the Queen enjoyed
[2:41:18] all the benefits of it but it would be a
[2:41:21] tad selfish because she would have
[2:41:23] watched her people be killed
[2:41:26] you see you catch it her brother BAM
[2:41:28] says it's about others
[2:41:31] burn all the selfishness forgive them
[2:41:34] father they know not what they do
[2:41:38] Esther had she had to weigh this because
[2:41:40] even her her uncle there Mordecai was
[2:41:44] pleading in South Gotham Nash's pray
[2:41:46] pray pray he was at the temple steps
[2:41:48] praying trying to say God has positioned
[2:41:51] you for such a time as this perhaps you
[2:41:53] need to pray about this you need to
[2:41:54] consider it and she potted it because
[2:41:56] she's going to the king she's got to do
[2:41:57] that it's gonna take humility it's gonna
[2:41:59] change an attitude to go before him she
[2:42:02] may die she had all these things in her
[2:42:03] but she could have stayed in the safety
[2:42:05] of her palace I'm just drawing myself
[2:42:08] and my little message church here but
[2:42:12] you see that there's more people that
[2:42:14] need to hear this work can you say ma'am
[2:42:17] it's not just us for know Morgan they
[2:42:20] sit around say I'm the bride and Singh
[2:42:21] I'm the bride I'm the bride but yeah
[2:42:23] well what purpose does God has for your
[2:42:24] life does everybody listen in here
[2:42:26] tonight
[2:42:28] I'm gonna say this I believe that
[2:42:30] there's great potential in this area
[2:42:32] with this assembly I see a revival
[2:42:34] taking place in this church and I
[2:42:36] believe there's many souls they're gonna
[2:42:37] come to this assembly I just say that's
[2:42:42] my heart now I'm not saying that say the
[2:42:44] Lord but it may be but I'm just saying
[2:42:46] that's my heart God's doing something
[2:42:48] and I know when God begins to work this
[2:42:49] way you better be prepared to minister
[2:42:52] to more Souls because Newfoundland needs
[2:42:58] a greater revival can you say man
[2:43:01] there's still elected seat in this city
[2:43:03] there's still some souls to come and the
[2:43:06] recent ones that have come are evidence
[2:43:09] of that but don't just say us for no
[2:43:10] more God wants to do something in this
[2:43:13] assembly can you say Amen
[2:43:18] you know I'm not I'm not a TV preacher
[2:43:21] trying to you know be flashy here that's
[2:43:23] not what I'm doing that's what my heart
[2:43:25] is first thing I said to the brothers
[2:43:27] when I walked in this offer I said you
[2:43:28] guys are gonna have to build on you need
[2:43:32] to get plans to build on you'd even
[2:43:33] given the need more parking you're gonna
[2:43:34] need to our space is too small because I
[2:43:37] feel I see what's going on I'm not about
[2:43:39] numbers you know we're not about mega
[2:43:41] churches I'm about the burden of the
[2:43:43] bride of Jesus Christ we're not here to
[2:43:45] sit in our palace and just say I'm bride
[2:43:47] I'm bride I'm bride we're positioned for
[2:43:50] such a time as this for redemption for
[2:43:54] the last elected seed to come
[2:43:59] so be it
[2:44:00] amen means so be it how many would say
[2:44:03] amen to that today let it come to pass
[2:44:08] she humbles herself before the king
[2:44:12] she's still the queen but she's not
[2:44:14] fulfilling the final victory of her life
[2:44:16] she needed a little change in her to
[2:44:17] meet this challenge and it was a choice
[2:44:20] of staying to herself or unselfishly
[2:44:23] using what she had to appeal to the king
[2:44:26] for the sake of others she had power
[2:44:29] with the king
[2:44:30] she had favor with the king it was a
[2:44:32] greater depth of humility to go to the
[2:44:34] king and she's just behind the behind
[2:44:36] the curtains there and she just steps
[2:44:38] out it is a greater depth of humility to
[2:44:41] step out and go before him to see things
[2:44:43] change she didn't have to do that but
[2:44:45] she did she humbled herself deeper to
[2:44:48] help other people unselfish Esther drew
[2:44:55] near the Bible says she drew near we
[2:44:58] draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to us
[2:45:00] that's Bible she drew near the king how
[2:45:04] many after this weekend if you don't get
[2:45:06] anything else how many just want to draw
[2:45:08] near the king just want to draw closer
[2:45:11] to him
[2:45:12] I believe it's happening tonight just
[2:45:15] drawing closer to him
[2:45:16] forget about lesser things put less of
[2:45:19] things out of our mind just draw near
[2:45:21] the king and she drew near him and when
[2:45:23] she drew near the king he held out the
[2:45:25] scepter to her and those of you know the
[2:45:29] Bible no royalty when the scepters
[2:45:32] handed and you're gonna touch the
[2:45:33] scepter you're gonna have all power
[2:45:36] that's a huge huge action from the king
[2:45:40] because the scepter represents all of
[2:45:42] his power and she hate he hands it
[2:45:44] towards Esther what do you want bride
[2:45:49] what do you want I'll give it to you up
[2:45:52] to the half of my kingdom what's your
[2:45:54] desire you know what her desire was an
[2:45:56] unselfish request to save other people
[2:46:00] yeah
[2:46:01] [Applause]
[2:46:03] but honey but honey you've got
[2:46:05] everything I've given you all the food
[2:46:07] and all the thing and you've getting
[2:46:08] your in the palace and I blessed you so
[2:46:10] much I've given you everything aren't
[2:46:12] you satisfied to say no I prayed about
[2:46:14] it I'm not satisfied just with that
[2:46:17] there's other people that need help here
[2:46:20] they are my people she positioned
[2:46:30] herself in the inner court she drew
[2:46:35] closer to the inner court why it was
[2:46:38] something further she desired and she
[2:46:39] could have stayed in her part of the
[2:46:41] palace would still be queen but I want
[2:46:43] more
[2:46:43] I need more the scepter was held out to
[2:46:45] her as a huge move to touch and to touch
[2:46:48] it means you have all power what is your
[2:46:50] request Esther and she's nervous as a
[2:46:53] young girl and I'm gonna dramatize this
[2:46:56] just a bit and then I'm gonna quit she's
[2:46:58] nervous as a young girl because it shows
[2:47:00] her nervousness when the King asked her
[2:47:02] she didn't come right out with it and
[2:47:04] expose her enemy she said can you come
[2:47:06] to dinner at my place with Haman and I
[2:47:10] want to serve you a dinner
[2:47:10] kind of surprised the King well all
[2:47:12] right I guess we can do that she could
[2:47:14] have asked for anything right there but
[2:47:16] it shows she's just a little nervous
[2:47:17] I said sure we'll come they show up in
[2:47:21] the house finished a beautiful dinner
[2:47:23] Haman sitting there her enemy you know
[2:47:26] what she's doing
[2:47:27] she's inviting her King and her enemy in
[2:47:32] the same place to expose her enemy in
[2:47:35] the presence of the king
[2:47:42] glory what an action is he gonna let the
[2:47:48] King deal with him
[2:47:49] she's got power with the King you can't
[2:47:52] deal with some stuff the Devils doing to
[2:47:54] you bringing in the presence of the King
[2:47:57] let him deal with it yeah show she was
[2:48:01] still a little nervous because when she
[2:48:02] was a little nervous the next night it
[2:48:04] okay what do you want now I was
[2:48:07] wondering if you could come tomorrow
[2:48:09] night
[2:48:10] for another meal seize her faith is
[2:48:14] building to ask isn't that how your
[2:48:18] faith is sometimes you just yes you just
[2:48:20] growing until you get enough faith to
[2:48:22] ask I want you to come tomorrow night
[2:48:28] look okay we can come tomorrow night
[2:48:30] this was good food we enjoyed this may
[2:48:34] be better tomorrow night we'll come back
[2:48:35] she invites both of them the next night
[2:48:39] she's inviting her enemy in the presence
[2:48:42] of the king if you have a habit if you
[2:48:45] have something in your life if you have
[2:48:47] something that you need to overcome
[2:48:50] bring it to the Lord the best way to
[2:48:55] deal with demons is to expose them with
[2:48:59] honesty the brides learned how to expose
[2:49:02] her enemy you're not gonna hide so she
[2:49:05] could have let him go on do what he did
[2:49:07] but she arranged it so she's gonna
[2:49:09] expose that thing right in the presence
[2:49:12] of her king praise be to God we come
[2:49:16] before we're in the presence of the king
[2:49:18] that can change everything
[2:49:20] he's more powerful than your enemies and
[2:49:23] finally she asked and that King turned
[2:49:26] against a min and took care of him wit
[2:49:27] now him did all that need to do because
[2:49:30] why Esther had power with the king
[2:49:34] [Applause]
[2:49:36] Esther had power with the king she has
[2:49:40] she was under the promise of the hour
[2:49:41] she was part of redemption for that hour
[2:49:44] she was part of bringing redemption to
[2:49:46] others her people she was positioned to
[2:49:48] do it but I'm here to close this tonight
[2:49:50] by saying to you there had to be a
[2:49:53] little change in Esther before that full
[2:49:57] promise could come to pass all of a
[2:50:03] sudden now all changes Heyman's hung
[2:50:05] they change the law that changed
[2:50:07] everything so all of her people are
[2:50:09] delivered what you have within you
[2:50:13] friends is more powerful than what you
[2:50:15] realize we're finishing this work of
[2:50:19] redemption and if somebody sees light
[2:50:24] and somebody sees what Christianity is
[2:50:25] supposed to be and they see where we're
[2:50:27] going an adoption if they're gonna
[2:50:29] they're gonna see it they're gonna see
[2:50:30] it in you power redemption is on your
[2:50:36] life that spreads your position to be
[2:50:39] able to call others call others not some
[2:50:43] mechanical thing not some intellectual
[2:50:45] thing but the Spirit of God in you is
[2:50:47] that Esther that say I'll be used by God
[2:50:50] to finish this work of redemption it's
[2:50:54] powerful friends say well I'm just up
[2:50:56] here in Newfoundland we just go to this
[2:50:58] little church and there's some brother
[2:50:59] here and there brother sister don't you
[2:51:01] dare devalue what you have within you
[2:51:05] what you're holding in your soul is the
[2:51:07] most powerful thing that's ever hit
[2:51:08] planet Earth
[2:51:11] and the quicker you catch that and the
[2:51:14] quicker you offer humility with it the
[2:51:16] quicker God can fulfill his promise in
[2:51:19] your life my life let's give God praise
[2:51:28] free and sorry for clapping but the
[2:51:34] Bible says clap your hands all you
