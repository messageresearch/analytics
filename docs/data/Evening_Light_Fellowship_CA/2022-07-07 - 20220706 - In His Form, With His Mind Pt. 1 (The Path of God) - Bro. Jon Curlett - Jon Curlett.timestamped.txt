[33:12] lord
[33:14] well we became a whole lot of nothing
[33:16] amen

[34:33] musicians

[34:37] philippians chapter 2 if you would
[34:38] philippians chapter 2.
[34:41] amen certainly good to be home be back
[34:44] in church i missed each and every one of
[34:46] you yes even you brother paul
[34:50] amen he always wants me to mention him
[34:51] from the pulpit so
[34:55] i don't think he meant that way though
[34:57] amen but it is good to be home certainly
[34:58] we had the lord's traveling mercies i
[35:00] can say that anybody that's traveling be
[35:03] ready for delays delays and then more
[35:05] delays amen but he gives more grace and
[35:08] we left here we were an hour and a half
[35:09] late leaving
[35:11] which meant that we missed our
[35:12] connection in toronto if all things went
[35:13] as planned but he delight that flight by
[35:16] an hour and a half so we got in just
[35:17] fine and made all of our connections and
[35:19] coming back and all these different
[35:21] things so we certainly appreciate that
[35:23] amen it's good to have sister lily back
[35:24] from her holidays and brother mark and
[35:26] sister maureen from their trip amen and
[35:29] then we know brother bob and we'll be
[35:30] coming back on sunday and brother chad
[35:32] in the family on monday so we want to
[35:34] remember them as well
[35:35] i was sorry to miss the the the baptisms
[35:37] of sister elsa and sister mary beth but
[35:39] certainly we uh we give god the glory
[35:42] and the praise for that amen amen it's a
[35:44] it's a wonderful thing to see them give
[35:46] their hearts to the lord and even
[35:48] sitting in there and hearing samuel give
[35:49] his joyful noise there tonight amen the
[35:52] world teaches teaches the children
[35:54] there's so much that's normal and then
[35:56] there's so much that's acceptable and
[35:57] they can take them to the football games
[35:59] and the hockey games and they can yell
[36:01] and scream and paint their faces and do
[36:03] all these crazy dances and everything
[36:04] and that's perfectly fine and we want to
[36:06] teach them that it's fine to worship god
[36:08] amen that it's it's fine to believe in a
[36:11] in something that you can't see but that
[36:12] you know was real and these different
[36:14] things and then we want them to come to
[36:16] a reality of god in their lives so we're
[36:18] so thankful for that of course and for
[36:19] brother levi's baptism as well amen just
[36:21] trusting god we'll bless them each one
[36:23] and fill them with his holy spirit and
[36:25] draw them into a relationship with him
[36:27] amen and then certainly good to have
[36:28] brother josh up here tonight again
[36:30] it's uh i i had sent a message to the
[36:33] the group chat there while i was away i
[36:35] i checked in on the first service and
[36:36] joe was up here late and i said what
[36:38] went wrong and he said he didn't say
[36:40] anything he just said long story but i
[36:42] checked the next one and sure enough
[36:43] brother josh was up here so it's good to
[36:45] have him up here and putting his
[36:46] shoulder to the wheel amen i think
[36:48] brother mark certainly appreciates it
[36:49] more than any of us so amen it's good to
[36:52] good to have him up here and sister
[36:53] elise it's good to see you as well amen
[36:55] god bless you and then turn to the
[36:57] scriptures tonight philippians 2
[36:59] verse 3
[37:01] says let nothing be done through strife
[37:02] or vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[37:05] let each esteem other
[37:07] better than themselves
[37:09] look not every man on his own things but
[37:11] every man also on the things of others
[37:13] and let this mind be in you which was
[37:16] also in christ jesus who
[37:18] being in the form of god thought it not
[37:21] robbery to be equal with god
[37:23] but made himself of no reputation and
[37:26] took upon him the form of a servant and
[37:29] was made in the likeness of men amen god
[37:32] bless you you can have your seats this
[37:34] evening amen i've been dwelling on some
[37:35] things while i've been away and by god's
[37:37] grace i didn't study a lick while i was
[37:39] away i took a i took a real vacation i
[37:42] didn't make any plans for preaching or
[37:44] anything but while i was sitting there
[37:45] in the airport trying to leave
[37:47] newfoundland and
[37:49] i just had so many things going on my
[37:50] mind so i popped open my laptop and
[37:52] typed out six pages of notes real quick
[37:54] while we were waiting and then came back
[37:56] yesterday and sat down and just worked
[37:58] all day to to prepare for tonight so
[38:00] it's good to be back in the saddle this
[38:02] is where my my happiness my joy is is
[38:04] certainly in serving this way and
[38:07] tonight i want to take a a title of in
[38:10] his form
[38:11] and with his mind sorry brother there we
[38:13] go in his form and with his mind amen
[38:16] and i i believe we're at a time where
[38:17] there's a full representation of jesus
[38:19] christ on this earth if i could start
[38:21] that way and say that we had a
[38:23] representation when he when jesus christ
[38:25] walked this earth and then we saw the
[38:26] fullness of god walking amongst us and
[38:28] we saw paul there and we saw the
[38:30] disciples and we saw a representation
[38:32] that came there but we have a promise of
[38:34] this age of a full representation amen
[38:36] and the prophet said that all that god
[38:38] was he poured into christ and then he
[38:39] said all that christ was he poured into
[38:41] the church so there is a full
[38:43] representation that's here but it's not
[38:44] going to be in one man or one woman
[38:46] anymore but it's going to be in a body
[38:48] amen a multi-membered body and we're in
[38:50] a season of the fullness of times and
[38:52] then when as gentiles as as non-jews
[38:55] then this is the fullness of times this
[38:56] is the climax of the gentile age of the
[38:58] gentile dispensation amen and there's a
[39:01] lot's been done and there's a lot's been
[39:03] said but now is the time for the
[39:04] fulfillment of everything that's been
[39:05] written in the scriptures about us amen
[39:07] we're living in the worst of times
[39:09] carnally speaking there was never a time
[39:11] that was as bad as this maybe you could
[39:13] say when he wiped everything off the
[39:14] face of the earth then that may have
[39:16] been close to it but at this time he's
[39:18] not just going to wipe everything off
[39:19] because he left some light but this time
[39:20] he's going to destroy everything with
[39:22] fire and then he's going to start
[39:23] completely anew that tells me we're in
[39:25] the worst of times but at the same time
[39:27] we're in the best of times and then
[39:28] spiritually we're talking about a time
[39:30] where we're going to have more than one
[39:31] person walk off this earth without
[39:33] seeing death we're going to see a
[39:34] representation of god in a multi-member
[39:36] body instead of maybe just one here at a
[39:38] time or one there at a time but we're
[39:40] going to see a multitude of people that
[39:41] are the expression of christ in this age
[39:44] amen amen the best of times was not when
[39:46] the prophet of god was here you know
[39:48] we've got people that really believe
[39:49] that because that's what they go back to
[39:50] time and time again is they're always
[39:52] looking backwards at a profit and the
[39:54] great signs and the great wonders and
[39:55] those were wonderful things and then if
[39:57] they have a revelation they'll say well
[39:58] it was the opening of the word and that
[40:00] was a tremendous time but it was the
[40:02] opening of the word by letting us know
[40:03] what had gone on and it was letting us
[40:05] know what was going to go on but now
[40:07] we're in the times of where what was
[40:08] going to go on is going on amen and
[40:10] that's more wonderful than it being
[40:11] opened is when it's happening to us amen
[40:13] when we're a part of what's been
[40:15] happening of what's supposed to happen
[40:16] and when you're a part of that prophecy
[40:18] being fulfilled when you can step into
[40:20] the word not just look into it and say i
[40:22] believe it but look into it and say i'm
[40:23] a part of it that's the most wonderful
[40:25] time to be alive and i believe that the
[40:27] best of times is that we're in now not
[40:29] just the opening of the word in terms of
[40:30] the intellect or the mind or by
[40:32] revelation but by experiencing men we're
[40:34] in the opening of the word by experience
[40:38] that's where we want to be amen but when
[40:39] the prophet was here was just him really
[40:41] he was starting a whole new movement he
[40:42] was this he was starting a whole new
[40:44] revelation there was a a breaking open
[40:46] of the seals and these different things
[40:47] and it was just him and brother branham
[40:49] would say afterwards he said i don't
[40:51] think there were maybe five or ten
[40:52] people understood what i was talking
[40:53] about in that pulpit
[40:55] right he talked to billy paul billy paul
[40:56] did you understand what daddy said yes
[40:58] sir he said now billy paulie said did
[40:59] you understand he said no sir why
[41:02] because it wasn't the time for him to
[41:03] understand but there's a time now for us
[41:05] to grasp these things and take it and
[41:06] not just understand it with our minds
[41:08] but take it and let it live in our lives
[41:10] amen brother branham pointed to a time
[41:12] where there was greater things coming
[41:14] and the greater things coming was not
[41:15] the revelation of the word in terms of
[41:17] understanding what's written but it was
[41:18] the experience of the word it was the
[41:20] manifestation of the word in a people
[41:22] that would take it and live it and
[41:23] become a part of it amen amen now i want
[41:26] to go back to just kind of dig into this
[41:28] thought as we set the tone for the next
[41:30] couple of services lord willing and just
[41:32] hold your scriptures in philippians 2
[41:34] and it says let nothing be done through
[41:36] strife or vainglory but in lowliness of
[41:39] mind that each esteem each other better
[41:41] than themselves so he says let nothing
[41:43] be done there is no time or no place for
[41:46] you to do anything through strife or
[41:48] vainglory because paul's setting us up
[41:50] for the mind of christ he's setting us
[41:51] up for the mindset or the approach of
[41:53] christ and paul gives us a warning up
[41:55] front and he says don't start with what
[41:57] i've written here don't start with
[41:58] strife and don't start with vainglory
[42:00] and it's interesting because strife
[42:02] we would maybe think that's you know
[42:04] people butting heads and friction and
[42:05] these different things but when you look
[42:07] into the root word that word strife
[42:09] means electioneering or positioning for
[42:12] office politicking or a desire to put
[42:15] oneself over uh forward so paul's saying
[42:18] you don't go around trying to step into
[42:20] things and putting yourself forward them
[42:22] and telling people why you ought to be
[42:23] there when we have elections every year
[42:25] we don't have the deacons or the
[42:26] trustees or the sunday school and
[42:28] superintendent or any of these people
[42:29] they don't go around telling everybody
[42:31] why they should be in that position do
[42:33] they
[42:34] i could think quite frankly we wouldn't
[42:36] vote for them if that's what they were
[42:37] doing was going around and telling us
[42:38] because we're supposed to be able to
[42:39] look at their lives and see why they
[42:41] should be in that position we should be
[42:43] able to see the gifts evident we should
[42:44] be able to see the life that's there we
[42:45] should be able to see the sanctification
[42:47] that's there and we better be able to
[42:48] see the holy ghost in their life if
[42:50] we're going to put them into those
[42:51] positions so by their life we're
[42:53] supposed to know them by their fruit
[42:54] we're supposed to know them and yes they
[42:56] can volunteer for but they shouldn't be
[42:58] going around trying to get people to
[42:59] vote for them that's what paul says
[43:00] anything you're going to do for the
[43:01] kingdom you don't politic your way into
[43:03] it right you just let your life speak
[43:05] for itself you can volunteer by all
[43:07] means amen we want to offer ourselves i
[43:10] remember a pastor saying that he wanted
[43:12] volunteers for anything that was
[43:13] happening in the church why because
[43:15] somebody that volunteers has something
[43:16] inside of them that says i'll i'm
[43:18] willing to do it and that's all god's
[43:20] looking for many times is that willing
[43:21] heart he's looking for somebody that'll
[43:23] say hey i'll try i'll do it if somebody
[43:26] wants to use me then i'll do it and
[43:27] sometimes you're doing it because you
[43:29] have a gift and sometimes you're doing
[43:30] it just because you're willing to put it
[43:32] put yourself out there sometimes all we
[43:33] need is a warm body you know they say
[43:35] some jobs to get it all you have to do
[43:36] is fog a mirror you know how you do you
[43:39] know how you fog a mirror you just have
[43:40] to be breathing
[43:41] right and there's jobs we have in the
[43:43] church sometimes all you need to be able
[43:44] to do is fog a mirror we just need warm
[43:46] bodies we just need some some strong
[43:48] back some capable muscles these sorts of
[43:50] things you know
[43:51] but what our life is supposed to be our
[43:53] testimony that we're suited for whatever
[43:54] it is we're looking for and then after
[43:56] that we're looking for a willing heart
[43:58] and then it's up to god to place us into
[43:59] any position or support role that we
[44:01] would put into brother braham said this
[44:03] way he says they found out that peter
[44:05] and john were ignorant and unlearned men
[44:08] they weren't educated neither were they
[44:10] smart but they had to take notice that
[44:12] they had been with jesus why
[44:15] because the spirit that was in jesus was
[44:18] in them doing the same things that jesus
[44:20] did
[44:21] taking the same kind of motive so often
[44:24] we focus on the signs of wonders but
[44:25] brother brahm takes it a step further he
[44:27] says they had the same spirit and it was
[44:29] reflected in what that they took the
[44:31] same kind of motive in the actions that
[44:33] they were doing because you can do the
[44:35] right thing for the wrong reason and
[44:36] that makes it wrong
[44:38] right now you can do the wrong thing for
[44:40] the right reason and that's still wrong
[44:41] but if you do the right thing for the
[44:42] wrong reason you're in the wrong as well
[44:44] you've got to have the right motive and
[44:45] the right objective and brother branham
[44:46] points us to the apostles he said they
[44:48] did the right things with the right
[44:49] motive and objective
[44:51] he says in everything that jesus had
[44:53] that's what they had you don't have to
[44:55] be smart you don't have to have an
[44:57] education you just have to have a
[44:59] willing heart
[45:00] then he says god sends his faith down
[45:02] and his power faith is power and we're
[45:05] to earnestly contend for it
[45:09] but we talked about strife but walk with
[45:10] brother branham or walk watch what paul
[45:13] says here because he says don't do
[45:14] anything through strife or politicking
[45:16] he says or vainglory and i believe if we
[45:19] get down to the root of so many things
[45:20] when you see people pushing for a role
[45:22] when you see p people pushing for a
[45:24] position then they get upset when they
[45:25] don't get it this is often the root of
[45:28] it and that word vainglory means
[45:30] soundless self-esteem empty pride or
[45:33] vain opinion of oneself in error so in
[45:36] other words we think more of ourselves
[45:38] than we actually are we think we have
[45:40] something that we don't have or we think
[45:42] we have more of measure of what we than
[45:44] what we really have and i can speak for
[45:46] myself certainly especially in the last
[45:48] 10 years of my life and the changes that
[45:50] have happened and the calling into the
[45:52] ministry and these different things i'll
[45:53] let you in on a secret you're rarely as
[45:55] ready as you think you are
[45:57] because when i thought i was ready guess
[45:59] what nothing happened
[46:01] almost every time whenever i thought i
[46:03] was ready nothing happened you know how
[46:05] i know i wasn't ready because god didn't
[46:07] move me forward
[46:08] god didn't move me into a different
[46:09] position god didn't move me into a
[46:10] different place god didn't progress me
[46:12] forward but he left me where i was
[46:14] because i wasn't as ready as i thought i
[46:16] was gonna i needed to be amen god didn't
[46:19] move me on even when i thought i was
[46:20] good enough and then maybe i waited
[46:22] longer and said well surely that was
[46:23] enough no that wasn't enough he left me
[46:25] there until he was satisfied and then he
[46:27] moved me on and that's when i was truly
[46:29] ready but i guarantee you so often what
[46:31] it is is we're more sick of the battle
[46:32] and we're more sick of the backside of
[46:34] the desert experience and that's what
[46:36] makes us think we're ready rather than
[46:37] the fact that we're actually ready god
[46:39] knows how to train men and women to
[46:40] serve him amen god knows how to break us
[46:42] down and get us ready for use in the
[46:44] kingdom of god and he knows how to grind
[46:46] us down so that he can have the
[46:47] preeminence in our life and get our own
[46:49] stinking thinking out of it amen and his
[46:51] timing is almost always different than
[46:53] ours is certainly the timing that we
[46:54] would choose because we don't like the
[46:56] trials we don't like the testing we
[46:58] don't like the proving we don't like the
[46:59] isolation we don't like the hard work
[47:01] that goes into these things amen
[47:03] but paul says there's an antidote to
[47:05] this and he says it in verse 4 he says
[47:07] look not every man on his own things but
[47:10] every man also on the things of others
[47:12] in the amplified it says let each of you
[47:14] esteem and look upon and be concerned
[47:17] for not merely with his own interests
[47:20] but also for the interests of others so
[47:23] it's not wrong to look to your own self
[47:25] you have to look after yourself amen can
[47:27] you imagine if if a preacher is all run
[47:29] ragged and he's his health is poor and
[47:31] he he's so out of sleep and he's so out
[47:33] of energy that he can't get up here and
[47:35] preach that doesn't do us any good he's
[47:36] got to look after himself doesn't he but
[47:38] he's also got to sacrifice himself for
[47:40] the needs of the believers i'm pretty
[47:43] tired here you can see my left eye is
[47:44] smaller than my right it's red i had a
[47:46] bad allergic reaction when i went to mow
[47:48] the jungle i call my yard after two and
[47:50] a half weeks and then we're still on
[47:52] california time so i don't have a lot of
[47:53] sleep i don't have a lot of energy here
[47:55] if i continued like this i wouldn't be
[47:57] of much use to this church would i i've
[47:58] got to take care of myself but i've also
[48:01] got to give myself and that's why i'm
[48:02] here preaching tonight is because this
[48:04] is my place of duty so i've got to get
[48:05] up there regardless of how i feel but
[48:07] i've got to take care of myself as well
[48:09] but paul says don't just look to
[48:10] yourself because that's going to lead to
[48:12] strife and vainglory but he says when
[48:14] you look on the needs of the other
[48:15] people when you look at to care for the
[48:18] others that are around you that's going
[48:19] to be the antidote to strife from
[48:21] vainglory because you're going to be so
[48:23] busy doing things for other people and
[48:24] taking care of what needs to be taken
[48:25] care of you won't have time to get
[48:27] lifted up you won't have time to get
[48:28] worried about who's doing what and and
[48:30] what you're not able to do amen
[48:32] but we see here that the mindset if we
[48:34] look in verse 4 the mindset of christ
[48:36] the mind of christ is first and foremost
[48:38] to serve
[48:39] right he came to serve you never saw
[48:41] christ building himself up into some big
[48:43] thing he never elevated himself he never
[48:45] turned himself into anything he did what
[48:47] the father told him to do and whether
[48:49] that raised him up or whether it dropped
[48:50] him down in people's estimation it meant
[48:52] nothing to christ and then he did what
[48:54] he came to do and that was to serve the
[48:56] needs of those he was sent to amen it's
[48:59] interesting because many people if you
[49:00] talk to them will put a minister if you
[49:02] talk to christians they'll put ministers
[49:04] at the top of the food chain if we had a
[49:06] a pyramid of hierarchy we'd say the
[49:08] ministers are up here many of us
[49:11] but you know what the word minister
[49:12] means
[49:14] the word minister as a verb means to
[49:16] serve and the word minister is a noun
[49:18] means servant
[49:20] so ministers by definition are servants
[49:22] you know we have we have prophets and
[49:24] apostles and evangelists and pastors and
[49:26] teachers then we have a prime minister
[49:28] we have a minister of education we have
[49:30] a minister of defense we have all these
[49:32] different things and what happens so
[49:34] often is that they forget that by
[49:36] definition they are there to serve and
[49:37] what they start doing is leaning to
[49:39] their own desires and their own
[49:40] interests and doing what's best for them
[49:42] and you get countries that turn into
[49:43] what canada is turning into why because
[49:46] they're doing what's best for them
[49:47] rather than what's best for the people
[49:49] when we put somebody in as a minister
[49:51] they're there to serve the people
[49:53] they're there to serve the people's
[49:54] interest to do what's best for them and
[49:55] they're to give of themselves for the
[49:57] best for what's best for the people amen
[50:00] so the ministers are here to serve the
[50:02] people i'm here to serve you brother
[50:04] gerald's here to serve you all these
[50:06] different ones that come in they're here
[50:07] to serve you
[50:08] but i want to say this that just because
[50:10] we serve you doesn't mean you're over us
[50:12] nor does it mean you're our masters
[50:14] but just because we're ministers does
[50:16] not make us masters either amen the
[50:18] ministry served the five full ministry
[50:20] we serve the people but we don't answer
[50:22] to you we answer to god amen amen we
[50:24] answer to god we get our orders directly
[50:26] from him and you can tell that because
[50:28] we preach sermons that none of you may
[50:29] want to hear at times and then we say
[50:31] things that are very uncomfortable for
[50:32] us to say we get into uncomfortable
[50:34] positions not because we want to but
[50:37] because we're compelled to because we're
[50:38] compelled to serve in whatever way that
[50:40] he calls us to serve amen
[50:43] but in psalms 103 21 i just want to
[50:45] anchor that he says bless ye the lord
[50:47] all hit all ye his hosts he says ye
[50:50] ministers of his that do his pleasure so
[50:53] the minister is confined to doing what
[50:56] what is god's pleasure amen so we're
[50:58] here to do what he asks us to do we're
[50:59] here to preach what he asks us to preach
[51:01] we're here inspired by what he has told
[51:03] us to do amen and that's the only way
[51:05] that's going to going to work because
[51:06] men get into trouble when they start to
[51:08] do what they want or they start to
[51:09] preach what the people want to hear
[51:11] and then the scripture talks about
[51:13] people heaping to themselves teachers
[51:15] heavy itching ears right they want them
[51:17] to preach what they want to hear and
[51:19] that never leads to anything good what
[51:20] it leads you to is a denomination
[51:21] because god's put out and you have men
[51:23] running the show in second corinthians 3
[51:26] it says in such trust we
[51:28] have we through christ to godward not
[51:30] that we are sufficient of ourselves to
[51:32] think anything as of ourselves but our
[51:34] sufficiency is of god
[51:36] who also had made us able ministers of
[51:38] the new testament not of the letter but
[51:41] of the spirit for the spirit killeth but
[51:44] this for the letter killeth rather but
[51:46] the spirit giveth life anytime you see a
[51:48] man come into the pope and start
[51:49] demanding other people what is that
[51:51] that's the letter
[51:52] right it's not anointed when he gives
[51:54] the letter the letter of the letter but
[51:55] there's no spirit you've got to have
[51:57] spirit behind it and that's the holy
[51:58] spirit to make those words live and to
[52:00] let them find the kind of ground that
[52:02] god has meant them to to land in him and
[52:04] we're not masters pastors are not
[52:06] masters they're shepherds and they
[52:07] answer to the great shepherd amen and
[52:09] they give their lives and they lay down
[52:10] with the sheep and they guard the doors
[52:12] and these different things they give
[52:13] their lives they give their comfort they
[52:15] give their health they give all of these
[52:16] things to the benefit of the sheep that
[52:18] god has entrusted to their care amen
[52:20] amen so i want to say above all this if
[52:23] god calls you to do anything he'll give
[52:24] you the heart of a servant when it comes
[52:26] to that thing amen you may get benefits
[52:28] from it listen there's benefits to being
[52:30] a minister guess what you get to eat
[52:32] first most places you go if you're a
[52:33] minister that's a benefit but i didn't
[52:36] become a minister so i could eat first
[52:38] right i didn't i didn't become a
[52:39] minister so i could maybe sit at a
[52:41] certain table or in a certain chair or
[52:43] get first pick of who i ride with or who
[52:44] i fellowship with i mean there are
[52:46] benefits to serving god i'm not going to
[52:48] say there aren't amen but the purpose
[52:49] that we always have is to serve if we're
[52:51] going to be called to do anything amen
[52:54] and and paul says you do that by
[52:55] esteeming others needs you lift them up
[52:58] you elevate their needs to a level that
[53:00] makes them important in your life and
[53:02] they supersede often the needs of
[53:03] ourselves amen now paul starts to get
[53:06] down to where we live and he starts out
[53:07] with his warning and this admonition but
[53:09] it's because he's setting us up for a
[53:11] new mind
[53:12] and he's saying this is the mindset that
[53:14] you have as a human in your carnal
[53:17] nature it's going to be a towards strife
[53:19] and vainglory it's going to be towards
[53:20] lifting yourself up it's going to be for
[53:22] doing things that make you look good but
[53:24] he says i'm setting you up to take on
[53:25] the mind of christ so you can't have
[53:26] this and the way to get past that is to
[53:28] what put others above yourself
[53:30] but now in philippians 2 verse 5 he says
[53:35] let this mind be in you which was also
[53:37] in christ jesus so paul's showing us a
[53:39] shift in our thinking because he's not
[53:41] just talking about the new birth but
[53:42] he's talking about the experience or the
[53:45] effect of the new birth now because if
[53:47] you have the new birth then something's
[53:49] going to change in your thinking and
[53:50] then there's going to be a new approach
[53:52] there's going to be a new way of looking
[53:53] at things and paul says it is through
[53:55] the mind of christ
[53:56] and paul says in order to have the he
[53:59] says the new birth experience will give
[54:00] you the mind of christ that's what he's
[54:02] talking about here
[54:03] right you've got to have the same spirit
[54:05] that was in christ and if you have the
[54:06] same spirit that was in him then you're
[54:07] going to have the same mind because
[54:09] that's going to come under what the
[54:10] rulership of that holy spirit
[54:12] paul says you've got to have what the
[54:14] mind that was in christ jesus and that's
[54:16] a big thing to say when we're living in
[54:17] a body that's two-thirds corruption and
[54:19] then a body that that can't be redeemed
[54:21] in and of itself he takes our soul but
[54:23] he gives us a new and glorified body
[54:25] because this body can't be redeemed it's
[54:27] doomed it is too full of sin he can't do
[54:29] anything with it so we've got a
[54:30] theophany waiting for us amen but he's
[54:33] talking to people that are stuck in this
[54:34] doom flesh that still have struggles
[54:36] that still have battles that still make
[54:38] mistakes and he's saying you have to
[54:40] have the mind of christ
[54:41] that's quite a thing to say
[54:43] if i asked you today do you have the
[54:45] mind of christ maybe satan would throw
[54:46] up all the things that you've done in
[54:48] the last week or month that maybe didn't
[54:50] look like the mind of christ was working
[54:51] you and say well how could you have the
[54:52] mind of christ but paul says you need to
[54:54] have the mind of christ you've got to
[54:55] take on the same mindset that he had
[54:57] there
[54:58] amen and the thing this is
[55:00] that so often many times what the key to
[55:03] to what we need to overcoming is to have
[55:05] the mind of christ
[55:06] is because this points to who you are it
[55:09] points to what you are and it points to
[55:10] the purpose that you have in this life
[55:13] and he says the mind of christ has this
[55:16] it says who
[55:17] being in the form of god thought it not
[55:20] robbery to be equal with god so he says
[55:22] you've got to have the main mindset the
[55:24] same mindset that christ did and that's
[55:26] that he was in the form of god and
[55:29] didn't think of robbery to be equal with
[55:31] god so i just said what would happen if
[55:33] i asked you if you have the mind of
[55:34] christ now i've got to ask you do you
[55:36] have it in your mind that you are equal
[55:38] with god because christ had that he
[55:40] thought it not robbery he didn't think
[55:42] that he was taking on himself something
[55:44] that he shouldn't have by saying he was
[55:45] equal with god paul says you've got to
[55:47] have the same mindset that christ did
[55:50] now that word form means the external
[55:52] appearance that which is seen
[55:55] representing the unseen
[55:58] right
[55:59] i want to take some time to dig into
[56:00] this because this idea of the form of
[56:02] god because i want about talk about
[56:04] christ and then i want to talk about us
[56:06] because there's a parallel there if we
[56:08] can see it and i want to take us back if
[56:10] you hold in philippians because we'll be
[56:11] there for a bit but in john 1 it says in
[56:14] the beginning was the word and the word
[56:16] was with god and the word was god the
[56:19] same was in the beginning with god so
[56:22] he's pointing us back to the mindset of
[56:24] christ he's pointing us back to how this
[56:26] all works and i haven't preached on
[56:28] godhead here and maybe i'll do it
[56:29] sometime
[56:30] but john is taking us back with a
[56:32] prophetic eye to what happened way back
[56:34] in the beginning he has an approach
[56:36] different than matthew mark or luke if
[56:38] you notice he goes all the way back to
[56:39] the beginning and he paints a picture
[56:41] that goes all the way up to the end amen
[56:43] john was a tremendous visionary god gave
[56:45] him such a gift amen and john takes us
[56:47] back and he says in the beginning before
[56:49] anything else was was the word amen he
[56:52] says that was the beginning of it all
[56:54] was the word and the word is the full
[56:56] expression of god to us as humans as
[56:58] believers that is the full expression of
[57:00] god to us it's the defining attributes
[57:02] of god to us god is in his word and god
[57:05] is his word
[57:06] that's what we see brother brown would
[57:07] say it this and he's talking about in
[57:09] the beginning he says so first he was
[57:11] god jehovah that jehovah means
[57:13] self-existing one he says now let's just
[57:15] picture now a little drama so you can
[57:17] get it let's see coming out of space
[57:20] where there's nothing let's make it a
[57:21] little white light like a mystic light
[57:24] like a halo
[57:25] and that was the logos that went out of
[57:27] god in the beginning that was the son of
[57:30] god that come out of the bosom of the
[57:31] father and that was what was in the
[57:33] beginning was the word and the word was
[57:35] with god and the word was god and the
[57:37] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[57:40] he says in the beginning was god and out
[57:42] of god come a logos a part of god that
[57:45] went out of god
[57:47] now again i'm not going to get into
[57:48] godhead too deeply here i just want to
[57:50] kind of cover this quickly to anchor it
[57:52] in and then brother brown says god sent
[57:54] the great holy spirit forth the logos
[57:57] that went out of god the theophany of
[58:00] god so what is a theophany a finney is
[58:03] what it's a glorified heavenly body it's
[58:05] a dwelling place for our souls i mean
[58:08] it's the perfect body that we're going
[58:09] to be restored to when we leave this
[58:11] earth amen it's the true dwelling place
[58:13] of every soul this body that we have is
[58:15] not jonathan corlett amen the body of
[58:17] jonathan collette is the theophany
[58:18] that's waiting for me over in glory
[58:20] that's the real jonathan we have the
[58:22] real soul here but we have the real body
[58:24] over there and that's what this one's
[58:25] longing for amen but you see here that
[58:27] we have god he he says god's out there
[58:30] and it's just this this dark blackness
[58:32] because god's a spirit you can't see a
[58:33] spirit right you can't see his spirit
[58:36] but he says out of that god that you
[58:38] can't see comes what a visible
[58:41] representation of god so god makes
[58:43] something that you can see now something
[58:45] that you can sort of interact with
[58:46] something that you can identify with
[58:48] your senses and say there's god
[58:51] now that doesn't mean all of god is
[58:53] there but it means there is the
[58:54] representation of god there is the
[58:55] visible portion of god that he made us
[58:58] able to see and interact with right so
[59:00] that's what brother braham says was was
[59:02] what was meant in genesis when he says
[59:04] let there be light he says when he said
[59:06] let there be life that was the logos
[59:08] coming out of god and it was a visible
[59:10] light that god could dwell in amen the
[59:12] light wasn't god
[59:14] but then god stepped into that and when
[59:16] you saw the light you saw god that was
[59:18] the only god you were ever going to see
[59:19] was that light because otherwise god's
[59:21] invisible right but he made something
[59:23] that we could see and interact with amen
[59:25] it was god dwelling in a body and and
[59:27] the scripture teaches us and the prophet
[59:29] teaches us that body is jesus christ
[59:31] right that's the son of god is the
[59:32] dwelling place of god it's the visible
[59:34] portion it's the manifestation of god
[59:37] now colossians 2 9 says this it says for
[59:40] in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[59:43] godhead bodily it's speaking of jesus
[59:44] christ all the fullness of god all the
[59:47] fullness you think the fullness would be
[59:48] enough he says all of the fullness so
[59:50] everything that could be put in a body
[59:52] that was god was put into the body of
[59:54] jesus christ amen so in jesus christ
[59:56] dwells or lives the fullness or the
[59:58] entirety of god in a body so jesus
[1:00:01] christ is the dwelling place of god and
[1:00:03] whether it's an angelic form whether
[1:00:05] it's in the pillar fire form whether
[1:00:06] it's in the corporal body of christ on
[1:00:08] earth that's where god has put his name
[1:00:10] and his presence so when you see that
[1:00:12] body that's where god is amen so that's
[1:00:14] the only god we're going to know that's
[1:00:16] the only god we're going to know when
[1:00:17] you see these things brother braham said
[1:00:19] jesus christ is the only god you'll ever
[1:00:20] see
[1:00:21] because that's what god created him for
[1:00:23] was to dwell in him so we could see him
[1:00:25] and interact with him
[1:00:26] it says here in john 1 verse 3 all
[1:00:29] things were made by him and without him
[1:00:31] was not anything made that was made and
[1:00:33] in him was life and the life was the
[1:00:36] light of men so christ made everything
[1:00:38] he says through that body through that
[1:00:40] light through that dwelling place that's
[1:00:42] how he created everything it was made
[1:00:44] through christ amen and in him was life
[1:00:46] and that life was the light of men let
[1:00:48] me put it this way it's not good enough
[1:00:49] to recognize the light
[1:00:51] lots of people see the light listen when
[1:00:53] saul was walking down that road and the
[1:00:55] light knocked him off lots of people saw
[1:00:56] the light lots of people heard the voice
[1:00:58] but how many recognized that was god
[1:01:02] you've got to have the light amen you
[1:01:04] can't just recognize the light you've
[1:01:05] got to have the light inside of you and
[1:01:07] it has to be life to you it has to be
[1:01:09] the only life inside of you if i could
[1:01:10] put it that way
[1:01:11] it says and the light shineth in
[1:01:13] darkness and the darkest comprehended it
[1:01:16] not that word comprehends means it
[1:01:18] didn't overcome it darkness cannot be
[1:01:20] spread and darkness cannot be created
[1:01:23] amen we can have flashlights that spread
[1:01:25] light
[1:01:26] right you can go to canadian tire and
[1:01:28] you can go buy a flashlight but guess
[1:01:29] what you can't buy a flash dark
[1:01:32] you can't buy something that gives you
[1:01:33] darkness
[1:01:34] darkness is only the absence of light
[1:01:37] darkness is defined as the absence of
[1:01:39] light so without light you automatically
[1:01:41] have darkness but you can't take
[1:01:42] darkness and spread it over light the
[1:01:44] light will overcome it every single time
[1:01:46] amen light always defeats darkness and
[1:01:49] and what he's saying here is if you have
[1:01:50] that life if you have that light inside
[1:01:52] of you then it will defeat any darkness
[1:01:53] that's inside of you amen what does it
[1:01:55] take to drive back darkness let the
[1:01:57] light in
[1:01:58] amen what is the light for us it's the
[1:02:00] gospel it's the word let the word in and
[1:02:02] that will drive out the darkness in our
[1:02:04] life see man open up that room open up
[1:02:06] that door let the light in and it will
[1:02:08] show you what needs to be taken out and
[1:02:10] it'll drive the darkness back every time
[1:02:12] you know why we have besetting sins so
[1:02:14] often because we don't let the light in
[1:02:17] what we do is we sit there and and i can
[1:02:19] say this from experiences often we don't
[1:02:22] admit that it's a besetting sin that we
[1:02:23] have
[1:02:24] what we do is we do it and we repent and
[1:02:26] we do it and we repent and we do it and
[1:02:28] we repent and we neglect to realize that
[1:02:30] we are under the dominion of a spirit
[1:02:32] that's got a hold of us and that's why
[1:02:33] it's called the besetting sin is we
[1:02:35] haven't defeated it it's something
[1:02:36] that's continually working on us over
[1:02:38] and over again and we repent do it again
[1:02:40] repent do it again and what we need to
[1:02:41] do is let the word come in and say this
[1:02:43] is not just a sin this is a besetting
[1:02:45] sin this is a spirit that's on you and
[1:02:48] you've got to let this be taken care of
[1:02:49] you need a deliverance from this you
[1:02:51] can't just keep repenting all of your
[1:02:53] life but you need to let the light in
[1:02:54] and shed the darkness out push the
[1:02:56] darkness out so that you don't have to
[1:02:58] deal with this anymore amen we are
[1:03:00] people that ought to have deliverance
[1:03:02] not just repentance in our life we don't
[1:03:04] need to be coming to the altar every
[1:03:05] time we don't want to be going to the
[1:03:06] bed every night and saying oh lord i did
[1:03:08] it again i did it again i did it again
[1:03:10] but we ought to be looking to let the
[1:03:11] word have a deliverance aspect in our
[1:03:12] life to let the light shine in and take
[1:03:14] us out of it amen what is it we're
[1:03:16] believing a lie we're believing that
[1:03:18] this is just something that i have in my
[1:03:20] life rather than there's a spirit on me
[1:03:23] that's what it is is we don't stop and
[1:03:24] say i have a problem
[1:03:26] and i need to get rid of what's causing
[1:03:28] this problem we think we're dealing all
[1:03:30] we do is we deal with the symptom rather
[1:03:32] than realize there's something in there
[1:03:33] that's causing that symptom and we got
[1:03:35] to get to the root of the issue it's
[1:03:36] funny because alcoholics anonymous has
[1:03:38] this figured out don't they
[1:03:40] now i'm not an alcoholic i've never been
[1:03:41] an alcoholic but what's the first step
[1:03:43] to alcoholics anonymous
[1:03:45] you stand up and you say hi my name is
[1:03:47] john and i'm an alcoholic
[1:03:49] you have to admit you have a problem
[1:03:51] right because if you don't admit you
[1:03:53] have a problem they can't help you in
[1:03:54] any way and it's the same for a believer
[1:03:56] if all you're doing is going for
[1:03:57] repentance and never deliverance what
[1:03:59] you're refusing to say is i have a
[1:04:00] problem
[1:04:01] right it's amazing alcoholics anonymous
[1:04:04] anonymous can get it but believers
[1:04:05] sometimes don't get it we've got to
[1:04:06] admit if something keeps coming back
[1:04:08] into our lives we need deliverance
[1:04:10] remember repentance is there to cover it
[1:04:11] the blood is always there to cover it
[1:04:13] but it's no way to live your life is
[1:04:14] going back and back again over and over
[1:04:16] again to the same old pig trough amen
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:20] it says there was a man sent from god
[1:04:22] whose name was john
[1:04:23] the same came for a witness to bear
[1:04:25] witness of the light that all men
[1:04:27] through him might believe
[1:04:29] he was not that light but was sent to
[1:04:31] bear witness to that light we've got the
[1:04:32] same problem with brother branham don't
[1:04:34] we people keep pointing to him as the
[1:04:35] light and they forget that he pointed to
[1:04:37] christ every single time he says it's
[1:04:39] not me it's not me i couldn't do it i
[1:04:41] can't heal you i can't discern i can't
[1:04:42] do anything it's him it's him and he
[1:04:44] kept pointing to christ and they had the
[1:04:46] same thing with john are you him are you
[1:04:48] him john are you him he says i'm not
[1:04:50] even worthy to undo his shoes
[1:04:52] brother brown said the same thing i'm
[1:04:53] nothing
[1:04:54] i'm nothing but when he's here he can
[1:04:56] use me in a special way amen he says he
[1:04:59] was not that light but was sent to bear
[1:05:00] witness of that light that was the true
[1:05:02] light which lighteth every man that
[1:05:04] cometh into the world
[1:05:06] and then let there be light
[1:05:08] he was a light in the beginning and now
[1:05:10] he's a light for men that come into this
[1:05:12] world brother brown puts it this way he
[1:05:14] says now there is jesus as a big light
[1:05:16] if you remember in the beginning jesus
[1:05:18] was a light jesus was the logos that
[1:05:20] went out of god and he was the angel of
[1:05:22] the covenant that led the children of
[1:05:24] israel through the wilderness he was the
[1:05:25] pillar of fire when they looked at that
[1:05:27] they looked at and when he was here on
[1:05:29] earth he says i came from god and i go
[1:05:31] back to god so if he came from a pillar
[1:05:34] of fire into a man then if he went back
[1:05:36] to where he was he went back to a light
[1:05:38] again and there he was when paul saw him
[1:05:41] he was a light
[1:05:43] continuing in the scriptures he says he
[1:05:44] was in the world and the world was made
[1:05:46] by him and the world knew him not
[1:05:49] and he came unto his own and his own
[1:05:51] received him not but as many as received
[1:05:53] him to them gave he power to become the
[1:05:55] sons of god even to them that believe on
[1:05:58] his name which were born not of blood
[1:06:01] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[1:06:02] will of man but of god amen you're born
[1:06:05] of god when we sit here in this church
[1:06:07] and we accept this message and we let it
[1:06:08] have a preeminence in our life it says
[1:06:10] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:06:12] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[1:06:15] of the only begotten of the father full
[1:06:17] of grace and truth
[1:06:22] now listen to this it says in verse 18
[1:06:24] we skipped a few verses it says no man
[1:06:27] has seen god at any time
[1:06:30] the only begotten son which is in the
[1:06:33] bosom of the father he hath declared him
[1:06:36] amen and then christ came out of the
[1:06:38] bosom of the father he was created out
[1:06:40] of god and he's the visible expression
[1:06:42] of god he is the form of god now that's
[1:06:45] a really long way for me to prove to you
[1:06:46] that jesus christ is the form of god
[1:06:48] he's the visible representation of god
[1:06:50] amen but i want to anchor that in the
[1:06:52] scriptures because we want to take that
[1:06:54] to our place and we want to see how we
[1:06:56] follow in that parallel amen it's god
[1:06:58] dwelling in a body a visible into a
[1:07:01] visible
[1:07:02] manifestation that we can interact with
[1:07:04] so whether it was melchizedek
[1:07:06] right melchizedek was it
[1:07:08] then you had the lord that talked to
[1:07:09] abraham while sarah was in the tent
[1:07:11] right then you had jesus christ you had
[1:07:13] the fourth man in the fire then you had
[1:07:15] the pillar of fire that knocked down
[1:07:16] saul this was all god in the
[1:07:19] representation of christ
[1:07:21] it was christ that walked down and
[1:07:23] and and broke bread and drank wine with
[1:07:24] abraham as melchizedek that was christ
[1:07:27] and he steps down you'll see him in many
[1:07:28] different things you have the angel of
[1:07:30] the lord as christ you have all these
[1:07:31] different things god can step into any
[1:07:33] form but whenever he steps into that
[1:07:34] form it's recognized as christ because
[1:07:37] what it's the anointed one it is the
[1:07:39] anointed one not unanointed one like we
[1:07:41] are but as the anointed one it is the
[1:07:43] preeminent anointing of god and so
[1:07:45] christ now is the external visible form
[1:07:48] of god and that's the only god we're
[1:07:50] ever going to see
[1:07:51] when jesus was on earth he said i come
[1:07:53] from god and i go to god and we know
[1:07:55] that he was the i am and the i am was
[1:07:58] that logos that pillar of fire and then
[1:08:01] when he went back to god and ascended up
[1:08:03] on high saul of tarsus was on his road
[1:08:05] down to damascus one day and that same
[1:08:07] light fell on him
[1:08:09] fell in before him and blinded him and
[1:08:11] there he was back in the form of a
[1:08:13] pillar of fire again he said i am jesus
[1:08:16] whom thou persecute us and it's hard for
[1:08:18] you to kick against the pricks he went
[1:08:20] from corporal body to a fiery body just
[1:08:22] like that nothing changed except that
[1:08:25] the external manifestation but it was
[1:08:26] the same god and it was the same
[1:08:28] representation was there like i said
[1:08:30] brother graham said in another place and
[1:08:31] i'm paraphrasing paraphrasing jesus
[1:08:33] christ is the only god you'll ever see
[1:08:36] we just read it sir it said it's the the
[1:08:38] son that it that that is the one that
[1:08:40] expresses him it's the only one that
[1:08:41] declares him as the son it's the only
[1:08:43] declaration you're going to see but john
[1:08:45] himself says it later in john
[1:08:47] 14 he says that philip sayeth unto him
[1:08:50] lord show us the father and it sufficeth
[1:08:52] us
[1:08:53] so you would say the father is god
[1:08:55] jehovah the original
[1:08:57] the og they would say today right he's
[1:08:58] the he's the first of all of this and
[1:09:00] philip says to jesus he says jesus show
[1:09:02] us the father and that'll be enough all
[1:09:05] we want to do is see the father
[1:09:07] and jesus said unto him have i personal
[1:09:10] pronoun been so long time with you and
[1:09:12] yet thou has not known me philip
[1:09:15] he that hath seen me has seen the father
[1:09:17] and how sayeth thou then show us us the
[1:09:19] father believeth thou not that i am in
[1:09:22] the father and the father in me the
[1:09:24] words that i speak unto you i speak not
[1:09:26] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:09:28] in me he doeth the works believe me that
[1:09:30] i am in the father and the father in me
[1:09:33] or else believe me for the very work's
[1:09:35] sake yes right
[1:09:37] we read earlier where it said he thought
[1:09:38] of not robbery to be equal with god he
[1:09:41] wasn't making himself equal as in i'm on
[1:09:43] the same plane but he was making himself
[1:09:45] equal as in when you see me you see god
[1:09:48] it was the equation that you can see me
[1:09:50] and that's how you see god that's all he
[1:09:52] was saying because he came out of it he
[1:09:54] was a part of it he was a created he was
[1:09:55] a the external was a created thing but
[1:09:57] inside of that was the almighty god amen
[1:10:00] it's like if we could take all of the
[1:10:01] ocean and pour it into a pitcher
[1:10:03] and that pitcher if i was holding that
[1:10:05] you could say that's the ocean if all of
[1:10:07] it was in there you could say that's the
[1:10:08] ocean
[1:10:09] now what i'm holding is a pitcher but
[1:10:12] the oceans inside of and that's all it
[1:10:13] was with christ was you have a body that
[1:10:15] had all of christ inside of it and when
[1:10:16] you look at that you say that's god
[1:10:18] because all of god is in there
[1:10:20] that's all he's doing he's giving us a
[1:10:21] representation he's giving us something
[1:10:23] that we can see and touch and feel in
[1:10:24] these different things amen what's jesus
[1:10:26] saying here he's saying when i talk
[1:10:28] god's talking when i heal god's healing
[1:10:31] when i'm walking god's walking when i'm
[1:10:33] reacting god's reacting there's no
[1:10:35] difference between me and him
[1:10:37] he's in this body and he's got such a
[1:10:39] control over and there's such a unity
[1:10:41] really not control but there's such a
[1:10:42] unity here there's such a surrender of
[1:10:44] this body to what's inside that what he
[1:10:47] says i do
[1:10:49] when he speaks i speak the way he says
[1:10:50] do it is the way i do it there's a
[1:10:52] perfect unity here so when you see me
[1:10:54] you're seeing the father you're seeing
[1:10:56] all of god that you'll ever need to see
[1:10:57] amen he says it's not me working these
[1:10:59] things it's the father that's working in
[1:11:01] me
[1:11:02] what was it the word became flesh in the
[1:11:04] beginning was the word and the word
[1:11:06] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:10] what was it jesus was saying look
[1:11:12] he speaks as the father he says philip
[1:11:14] listen
[1:11:16] have i been here so long that you don't
[1:11:17] recognize it's me
[1:11:19] when we go back to isaiah what was it i
[1:11:21] mean even in the body of jesus
[1:11:23] the body of jesus we see that it receive
[1:11:25] worship
[1:11:26] listen you can't worship god something
[1:11:29] other than god and god allow it but yet
[1:11:31] we look at jesus and the leper worshiped
[1:11:33] him and the woman the man with the sick
[1:11:34] daughter worshiped him the seraphim
[1:11:36] woman worshiped him his disciples
[1:11:38] worshipped him and he never forbade
[1:11:40] their worship why because they were
[1:11:42] worshiping the what emmanuel god with us
[1:11:44] god in flesh they recognized what was
[1:11:46] what that body really represented was it
[1:11:48] was the personal presence of god walking
[1:11:51] amongst them every one look at isaiah 9
[1:11:53] it says what unto us
[1:11:55] a child is born
[1:11:56] that body had to be born it was a
[1:11:58] sinless body but it had to be born but
[1:12:00] said unto us a son is given why because
[1:12:02] what inhabited that was something that
[1:12:04] had already existed before that body was
[1:12:06] ever born amen it called they said that
[1:12:08] he would be called what wonderful
[1:12:10] counselor
[1:12:12] the mighty god everlasting father
[1:12:15] jesus wasn't taking something on here
[1:12:17] that the word didn't say but he took
[1:12:19] what the word said about him and that's
[1:12:20] why it's not robbery because the word
[1:12:22] said he was the everlasting father he
[1:12:25] was the mighty god
[1:12:27] that's why he could say it and not be
[1:12:28] robbery because the word said it about
[1:12:30] him
[1:12:30] that's why you can say things about you
[1:12:32] and that are in the word as well and
[1:12:34] it's not robbery it's not putting
[1:12:35] yourself up on a high plane it's not
[1:12:37] putting on heirs but it's taking what
[1:12:39] the word says about you and confessing
[1:12:41] it and when your life matches a
[1:12:42] confession then there's no doubt in your
[1:12:44] mind that you are what you say you are
[1:12:46] amen all that god was he poured into
[1:12:48] christ and then we see that all the
[1:12:51] christ was he poured into the church and
[1:12:52] we'll get into that maybe in the next
[1:12:54] few services amen but we all understand
[1:12:57] now hopefully what what this means about
[1:12:59] god dwelling in a body or in a
[1:13:00] representation called christ and that's
[1:13:02] who we interact with amen but we don't
[1:13:04] want to stop there because the story
[1:13:06] doesn't end with christ
[1:13:08] the story doesn't end with that body of
[1:13:09] jesus christ it doesn't end with the
[1:13:11] pillar of fire it doesn't end with
[1:13:13] with with the different bodies that he
[1:13:15] put himself into him and but he was the
[1:13:17] first fruit he was the firstborn among
[1:13:20] many brethren he was the wave offering
[1:13:21] he was a chief offering that went before
[1:13:24] us and we see paul in romans 8 he says
[1:13:26] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:13:28] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:13:31] image of his son that he might be the
[1:13:33] firstborn what among many brethren so
[1:13:37] what he was there's more coming amen he
[1:13:40] wasn't he was the first one but he
[1:13:41] wasn't the only one and it wasn't just
[1:13:44] going to be brethren in terms of men but
[1:13:45] it was going to be men and women it was
[1:13:47] going to be sons and daughters of god
[1:13:49] following behind that were in the form
[1:13:51] of god with the anointing and the spirit
[1:13:52] of god to do the very things that god
[1:13:54] did through christ but each in their
[1:13:56] individual way amen it says moreover
[1:13:59] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:14:01] called and whom he called them he also
[1:14:03] justified in whom he justified them he
[1:14:05] also glorified what then shall we say to
[1:14:08] these things if god before us who can be
[1:14:11] against us what he's saying is nothing
[1:14:13] can stop this
[1:14:14] nothing's going to hold this back you
[1:14:16] look at yourself you look in the mirror
[1:14:18] you look at your condition you look at
[1:14:20] at your habits maybe sometimes and you
[1:14:22] say how can this be
[1:14:23] like mary of old how can this be
[1:14:26] but he says look nothing can stop this
[1:14:29] there's nothing there's no weapon that
[1:14:31] can be formed against you that can stand
[1:14:32] that's going to prosper and hold you
[1:14:34] back from becoming what the next line of
[1:14:37] what the many brethren that he was
[1:14:39] talking about amen he's called a people
[1:14:41] to follow in the footsteps of christ him
[1:14:43] and he's called out of people that are
[1:14:45] just like that one that we are so
[1:14:47] blessed to call a redeemer and savior
[1:14:49] now i cannot redeem you cannot redeem
[1:14:52] anyone that preaches that we can redeem
[1:14:54] is off the word you can't do it amen but
[1:14:56] you can point them to the redeemer you
[1:14:58] can live a life that shows that you've
[1:14:59] been redeemed that makes them want the
[1:15:01] same kind of redemption amen it's only
[1:15:03] under one man he died and the price was
[1:15:05] paid and that's the only redemption
[1:15:07] we'll ever need but what the redeemed
[1:15:09] then go out and say we're looking for
[1:15:10] more of the redeemed that don't know
[1:15:12] that they've been redeemed amen what is
[1:15:14] he's calling people that are called to
[1:15:15] act like him to walk like him to talk
[1:15:17] like him to live like him to be like him
[1:15:20] to be him
[1:15:22] to a dying world amen let's go back to
[1:15:24] the very beginning in genesis 1.
[1:15:27] because we want to see these parallels
[1:15:28] here and it says and god said let us
[1:15:30] make man in our image after our likeness
[1:15:33] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:15:35] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[1:15:36] and over the cattle and over all the
[1:15:38] earth and over every creeping thing that
[1:15:40] creepeth upon the earth so god created
[1:15:43] man in his image in the image of god
[1:15:45] created he him so notice this is
[1:15:47] singular it's the original creative
[1:15:50] event and it says it's in his image not
[1:15:52] in his form
[1:15:54] it says in his image
[1:15:56] and then it says male and female created
[1:15:58] he them and this is the later event eve
[1:16:00] was part of adam originally in spirit
[1:16:02] form but when bodies were created they
[1:16:04] were separated out eventually so inside
[1:16:06] that spirit there was a
[1:16:08] a male form and a female form inside of
[1:16:10] it but it was a singular item in the
[1:16:12] beginning and then after that he creates
[1:16:13] the male and female and then he
[1:16:15] separates them out into the body
[1:16:17] but god says here i'm going to create
[1:16:18] man in my image and he does
[1:16:20] but what does he create
[1:16:22] god is a spirit
[1:16:24] scripture says god is a spirit right so
[1:16:26] he created here man as a mankind as a
[1:16:28] single spirit as well
[1:16:30] the first adam was the spirit and the
[1:16:31] prophet god says now watch we're seeing
[1:16:34] god unfold himself then he said in
[1:16:36] genesis let us make man in our own image
[1:16:38] what kind of a man was he he had to be a
[1:16:41] spirit man amen he says and then he put
[1:16:44] him in his five senses to contact his
[1:16:46] earthly home now i want you to catch
[1:16:48] something here the way brother brown's
[1:16:50] talking his language he's talking about
[1:16:52] god unfolding himself
[1:16:54] okay now pay attention as we go into
[1:16:56] this next quote because i want to show
[1:16:57] you something that's happening here he
[1:16:59] says but now god making adam and eve at
[1:17:02] the same time the only thing he made was
[1:17:04] the supernatural the spirit adam and the
[1:17:07] spirit eve the man and the woman and
[1:17:09] then when he put adam in here it wasn't
[1:17:11] good for he was going to say for him to
[1:17:13] dwell alone and they said see it's god's
[1:17:15] picture unfolding all the time
[1:17:18] so we have a spirit form of adam and he
[1:17:20] says now he's going to put it into body
[1:17:22] and this is what god's picture unfolding
[1:17:26] the picture of god not a not a resume of
[1:17:29] the ages he's talking about the
[1:17:31] unveiling of god now and he says it's
[1:17:33] god's picture unfolding all the time
[1:17:37] not just there but it's unfolding all
[1:17:40] the time
[1:17:41] everything like this it's just coming
[1:17:43] right down just unfolding right out
[1:17:46] coming out through the millennium over
[1:17:49] yonder and right on into eternity so he
[1:17:51] says this unfolding of god is going to
[1:17:53] go way past time and all the way into
[1:17:56] eternity
[1:17:57] so there's something else that's got to
[1:17:58] happen here
[1:18:00] he says it's just god's picture just
[1:18:02] unfolding god unfolding himself
[1:18:05] listen he's saying god's picture
[1:18:07] unfolding all the time he says coming
[1:18:08] through the millennium right on into
[1:18:10] eternity eternity
[1:18:12] right that's what we're going to talk
[1:18:13] about for the next few services lord
[1:18:15] willing
[1:18:16] amen i'm not just trying to show you
[1:18:18] what happened but i've got to show you
[1:18:19] what's happening and what's going to
[1:18:21] happen so that you can be a part of it
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:24] he says here god manifested himself in
[1:18:26] christ jesus to show what he was
[1:18:29] what was jesus a man of sorrow
[1:18:32] acquainted with grief loving to the
[1:18:34] prostitute he said where are thy
[1:18:36] accusers i have none lord neither do i
[1:18:39] accuse you go and sin no more tired and
[1:18:43] weary from walking about 30 miles that
[1:18:45] day through the desert sands and things
[1:18:47] there was a woman of nane coming out and
[1:18:50] her only boy dead laying there he
[1:18:52] stopped the funeral procession laid his
[1:18:54] hand upon him and said rise and the boy
[1:18:57] who was dead rose up again that's our
[1:19:00] lord jesus he was never too tired and
[1:19:03] never too weary to do anything good amen
[1:19:06] now i may be getting a bit ahead of
[1:19:08] myself and the message that i'm bringing
[1:19:11] this evening but i want to ask you are
[1:19:12] you too weary or tired to do the right
[1:19:14] thing
[1:19:17] because you look at christ and every
[1:19:19] time he goes over and he says i have
[1:19:21] needs to go here and i have need to go
[1:19:23] there and i've got to do this and i've
[1:19:25] got to do that and what was at the end
[1:19:27] of every one of those journeys was what
[1:19:29] a battle
[1:19:30] a struggle a trial he'd do something and
[1:19:33] somebody would disbelieve somebody will
[1:19:34] reject somebody would make up stories
[1:19:37] somebody would try and kill him it was
[1:19:39] everything he tried to do right
[1:19:40] everything he did right there was always
[1:19:42] a price that he paid for that time and
[1:19:44] time and time again
[1:19:47] but he gave and he gave and he gave
[1:19:49] until at the very end he gave his very
[1:19:50] own life he gave the last thing that he
[1:19:52] had to give but he was never too tired
[1:19:54] to do the right thing
[1:19:56] he was never too tired to help somebody
[1:19:58] else he was never too tired to serve the
[1:20:00] purpose that he was put on this earth to
[1:20:02] serve amen and that's the mindset of
[1:20:04] christ that we're talking about is that
[1:20:06] if you're going to put your energy if
[1:20:07] you're going to put if you're going to
[1:20:09] tire yourself out put it into something
[1:20:11] that's worth talking about from a
[1:20:12] kingdom perspective from a word
[1:20:14] perspective
[1:20:16] when we left california every time we
[1:20:18] leave my my father-in-law
[1:20:20] he's a he's he used to be a pastor he
[1:20:22] doesn't pastor anymore but every time we
[1:20:24] we leave he he he has to pray for us
[1:20:27] and this time he said he said will you
[1:20:30] pray for us and then when you're done
[1:20:32] i'll pray for you
[1:20:33] and so i was praying for him as a before
[1:20:35] we left there and even when i came home
[1:20:37] that night and i was praying before i
[1:20:39] went to bed
[1:20:40] and i was just just thinking about what
[1:20:42] he's given for his life he's 80 years
[1:20:44] old now
[1:20:45] and he's given his health he can barely
[1:20:47] walk his knees are shot he has no real
[1:20:49] money to speak of he doesn't have a big
[1:20:51] home he doesn't have he has a house that
[1:20:53] has electricity only half the day and he
[1:20:55] has his chickens and his little plants
[1:20:57] and that's about it
[1:20:59] after 80 years and half of that
[1:21:01] preaching the message preaching the
[1:21:02] gospel faithfully pastoring he's given
[1:21:05] everything he has to the lord
[1:21:08] and now he's taken care of
[1:21:11] it's funny because my father's made
[1:21:12] millions and he has less to show for it
[1:21:14] than a man that gave everything to god
[1:21:17] but god has taken care of him but he
[1:21:18] doesn't live a life of luxury or ease he
[1:21:21] doesn't have a big 401k or an rrsp as we
[1:21:23] call it up here
[1:21:25] but he's taken care of
[1:21:26] and he has no needs by god's grace but
[1:21:29] he's given everything if he's broken
[1:21:31] he's broken because he's given
[1:21:32] everything to god
[1:21:34] but i sat there and i just i was
[1:21:36] thinking he's 80 years old and he offers
[1:21:38] no excuse he still every day studies the
[1:21:40] word so that he can give an answer for
[1:21:42] the hope that lies within him
[1:21:44] he just sent me a link while i was there
[1:21:46] he sent me another one today of him and
[1:21:49] there's a there's a man there he's not a
[1:21:51] message believer but he sees something
[1:21:53] there and he asks him to come and preach
[1:21:55] online for him to to an online group
[1:21:57] there and so he goes at 80 years of old
[1:22:00] 80 years old and he sits there and he
[1:22:01] studies and he preaches for an hour
[1:22:04] at 80 years old
[1:22:05] he's still not holding back he's still
[1:22:07] giving whatever he can give and he's
[1:22:09] always ready to give that answer he's
[1:22:11] always ready to give that testimony amen
[1:22:13] and i thought there what excuse could i
[1:22:15] offer that would stand up to that
[1:22:16] testimony i don't even have to compare
[1:22:18] to brother branham or jesus i can just
[1:22:20] look at my father-in-law a broken man
[1:22:22] that only speaks half english
[1:22:25] and yet look at what he's doing for the
[1:22:26] lord and i said to myself what am i
[1:22:29] holding back
[1:22:30] you know what excuse am i giving as to
[1:22:32] why i won't do more
[1:22:34] and then when i lay my head down tonight
[1:22:36] am i have i given my all
[1:22:38] to do something for the lord or am i
[1:22:40] laying down in my ease in comfort
[1:22:41] because sometimes i think we have it too
[1:22:43] easy
[1:22:44] amen and we're so we're so busy calling
[1:22:46] it a blessing that we're not using the
[1:22:48] blessing to do what further the kingdom
[1:22:50] of god
[1:22:51] amen i so appreciate what brother mark
[1:22:53] does with with going in and he listens
[1:22:55] to eight million sermons a a week and
[1:22:57] and goes through and he translates them
[1:22:58] and shares them with us and and he
[1:23:00] listens to the word of god and he sends
[1:23:02] those things over that will help us or
[1:23:03] encourage us or he sees i'm preaching
[1:23:05] something he sends me over something
[1:23:06] that'll maybe add to it in these
[1:23:08] different things what is it he's not
[1:23:09] sitting back
[1:23:10] he's not sitting back sister maureen
[1:23:12] still plays
[1:23:13] amen we still have people that'll still
[1:23:15] put their shoulders to the wheel we got
[1:23:16] a 70
[1:23:17] 74 year old pastor
[1:23:20] still got his shoulder to the wheel amen
[1:23:23] still showing up for church every
[1:23:25] service
[1:23:26] listen if there's people that could take
[1:23:28] time off we got some here that have
[1:23:29] earned it
[1:23:30] but guess what when the life and the
[1:23:32] light of god is in you you never get to
[1:23:34] stop
[1:23:35] because it's in you
[1:23:37] it's in you to share it
[1:23:41] amen do we know what we have
[1:23:44] do we know what we have and do we know
[1:23:47] how they need it
[1:23:59] i want you to notice adam here because
[1:24:02] remember he's made in the image of god
[1:24:05] and if you're made in the image of god
[1:24:06] you've got to follow the path of god
[1:24:09] the same path that god takes guess what
[1:24:10] if he makes a man his image he's got to
[1:24:12] take the same path
[1:24:13] and adam's up there and he's a spirit
[1:24:15] and i don't really know what that means
[1:24:16] to be a spirit i don't know you know can
[1:24:18] a spirit talk to another spirit i guess
[1:24:20] you can but they can't see they can't
[1:24:21] interact perhaps in the same way but
[1:24:23] adam's in the image of god but god had a
[1:24:26] path that took him to a form
[1:24:28] and that form was called jesus christ
[1:24:29] and adam had to be brought to a form as
[1:24:31] well why because that form had a purpose
[1:24:34] god didn't make a a form god didn't make
[1:24:36] the sun god god didn't make the the the
[1:24:39] pillar of fire for no reason but he used
[1:24:41] it to interact with nature he used it to
[1:24:43] create nature we could say and so adam
[1:24:46] has to he has a purpose he has a a
[1:24:48] reason for being there but he was
[1:24:50] without a natural form and if he's in
[1:24:52] the image of god he's got he would have
[1:24:54] been invisible to the natural world but
[1:24:56] he was made to be a part it says that he
[1:24:58] had to take dominion over it how can you
[1:25:00] take dominion over something that can't
[1:25:01] see you that can't interact with you so
[1:25:03] he had to be put into a form that would
[1:25:06] that would interact with and allow him
[1:25:08] to step into the purpose of god
[1:25:10] now if we look in genesis 2 and we're
[1:25:12] starting to close here
[1:25:13] my voice is going
[1:25:15] it says in verse 5 and every plant of
[1:25:18] the field before it was in the earth and
[1:25:20] every herb of the field before it grew
[1:25:22] for the lord god had not caused it to
[1:25:24] rain upon the earth and there was not a
[1:25:27] man to till the ground so i want you to
[1:25:29] look here because all of the conditions
[1:25:30] for growth are here
[1:25:32] the seeds are in the ground the ground
[1:25:34] is fertile the ground has all the
[1:25:35] nutrients needed
[1:25:37] right everything that you need for the
[1:25:39] plants to grow is here
[1:25:41] but yet the plants aren't growing
[1:25:43] if i could put it this way there's a
[1:25:44] drought on the earth the the creation is
[1:25:47] there but there's a drought nothing's
[1:25:48] coming forth
[1:25:50] why because the scripture says what
[1:25:52] there was no water and there wasn't a
[1:25:54] man
[1:25:55] so in order for it to come forth what
[1:25:57] was needed water and a man
[1:26:00] if water comes and a man comes then
[1:26:02] everything's going to step into place
[1:26:03] but until those come then nothing's
[1:26:05] going to happen the scripture says it
[1:26:07] infers here that without the water and
[1:26:08] without the man god wasn't going to hit
[1:26:09] the button to go
[1:26:11] right we've got a world that's ready to
[1:26:13] roll here but god hasn't put the
[1:26:14] batteries into it yet he's just letting
[1:26:16] it sit there
[1:26:18] amen but it says in verse six so the
[1:26:20] everything's set every the conditions
[1:26:22] are there for growth
[1:26:24] but nothing's happening but it says in
[1:26:25] verse six there went up a mist from the
[1:26:28] earth and watered the whole face of the
[1:26:30] ground so there was no rain there was no
[1:26:32] water in verse five and we know that
[1:26:34] water is required to bring the plants
[1:26:35] out of the ground
[1:26:37] but then all of a sudden god hits the
[1:26:38] button
[1:26:39] and there starts to be water
[1:26:42] so if you need water for it to grow and
[1:26:43] you need a man then guess what when god
[1:26:45] sends the rain what does that mean
[1:26:47] there's a man coming down the road isn't
[1:26:48] there if the man is needed and the rain
[1:26:50] is coming that means that there's an
[1:26:51] answer coming for someone to till the
[1:26:53] ground as well if god required both
[1:26:55] those things to be there and he sent one
[1:26:57] that means the other one's on the way
[1:26:59] amen and you can see that in life that
[1:27:00] where growth is needed god will water
[1:27:02] god will prepare the ground and then he
[1:27:04] sends a man or he sends a woman there to
[1:27:06] a prepared ground that's ready for life
[1:27:08] to what bring it to where it needs to be
[1:27:10] because we're the hands and feet of god
[1:27:11] we're the hands and feet of christ in
[1:27:12] these different things amen
[1:27:15] what was it
[1:27:17] it wasn't time till god said it was time
[1:27:20] and if i can say that to our own lives
[1:27:23] it ain't time till god says it's time
[1:27:25] listen we can have all of the things
[1:27:26] there for growth we can have all of the
[1:27:28] things there for moving forward we can
[1:27:30] have all the things there for for for
[1:27:32] for stepping forward into life but
[1:27:34] unless god says it's time you're better
[1:27:36] off waiting
[1:27:37] because when he says go nothing stops it
[1:27:39] but when you say go nothing happens all
[1:27:42] you do is you waste your time you waste
[1:27:44] your energy and you get frustrated right
[1:27:46] you don't go anywhere but when god says
[1:27:47] go get on board and start moving with it
[1:27:49] because things happen fast when god says
[1:27:52] go
[1:27:53] and when we read here what was the
[1:27:54] catalyst for the rain what was it that
[1:27:56] caused the rain to start the man was
[1:27:58] coming
[1:27:59] and he needed to have something to work
[1:28:01] with so god sent the rain so that when
[1:28:03] that thing came up the man was going to
[1:28:04] be there to take care of it
[1:28:08] verse 7 says in the lord god formed man
[1:28:10] of the dust of the ground and breathed
[1:28:12] into his nostrils the breath of life
[1:28:14] and man became a living soul
[1:28:17] what is it adam followed the form of god
[1:28:19] follow the path of god and he came into
[1:28:21] form now spirit stepped into a body
[1:28:23] spirit stepped into a form now you could
[1:28:25] see him feel at him right remember we
[1:28:27] remember brother brown says god gave
[1:28:28] adam what his five senses so he could
[1:28:30] what interact with his world now and
[1:28:33] that's what's happening here is the
[1:28:34] rain's there there's something for him
[1:28:35] to interact with so god puts the man
[1:28:37] there to interact with it amen god gave
[1:28:39] adam a form that matched his purpose
[1:28:43] do you know that he may he built him
[1:28:45] exactly the way it was needed to make
[1:28:47] the earth prosper and grow
[1:28:49] he gave him exactly the shape he needed
[1:28:51] and there's nothing like it on the on
[1:28:52] the planet you can talk about monkeys
[1:28:54] and everything but when you start
[1:28:55] looking at the ratios of arms and legs
[1:28:57] and all these different things i was at
[1:28:59] the san diego wild safari park there and
[1:29:01] guess what they had a monster silverback
[1:29:03] gorilla but he doesn't look like any man
[1:29:04] i know thank god
[1:29:07] that's a man that would never get
[1:29:08] married
[1:29:10] but what do you see you saw massive
[1:29:12] torso big chest big shoulders but the
[1:29:14] arms that go almost to the ground right
[1:29:17] because it's not built for plowing and
[1:29:19] for moving and tilling in these
[1:29:20] different things it's built for being in
[1:29:22] the trees it's built for something
[1:29:23] completely different but a man's built
[1:29:25] to work a man's built to work he's built
[1:29:27] to till the ground he's built to do what
[1:29:29] the purpose that god brought him here to
[1:29:31] do amen
[1:29:34] look at this in verse 8 it says and the
[1:29:36] lord god planted a garden eastward in
[1:29:38] eden and there he put the man whom he
[1:29:41] had formed listen he had a whole earth
[1:29:44] that was breaking out into vegetation
[1:29:46] and all the plants and trees were coming
[1:29:47] forth but look at what he did here he
[1:29:49] said i've got a place just for you adam
[1:29:51] i've got a place that i prepared just
[1:29:53] for you to go and take care of he didn't
[1:29:55] say adam he didn't say adam roam the
[1:29:57] earth
[1:29:58] take care of everything adam he said
[1:30:00] adam i've got a place i've got a garden
[1:30:02] i've built just for you go and take care
[1:30:05] of that garden
[1:30:06] he had a place he had a time and he had
[1:30:09] a purpose for adam and he had prepared
[1:30:12] all of it specifically for adam the way
[1:30:15] he was built and the body that he made
[1:30:17] amen
[1:30:19] the world couldn't work the way it
[1:30:20] needed to until adam came on the scene
[1:30:23] the world needed a man to till it that
[1:30:25] garden needed that man in there to keep
[1:30:26] things in order
[1:30:28] because it'll what even though it's made
[1:30:29] by perfect god it will do what it'll
[1:30:31] take over itself it'll start to fight
[1:30:33] amongst itself vegetation will start to
[1:30:35] go and then one thing's going to die out
[1:30:36] because it doesn't have enough shade and
[1:30:37] something will get too big and it'll
[1:30:39] take over and we see it if you go down
[1:30:41] in louisiana for any of you that have
[1:30:42] been there if you drive on the highways
[1:30:44] you see these ivy this ivy on the on the
[1:30:46] sides of the highways and it grows right
[1:30:47] up into the trees and it completely
[1:30:49] takes them over that's what would happen
[1:30:51] if what you didn't have a man there to
[1:30:53] protect it right certain things will
[1:30:55] take over they'll dominate but when you
[1:30:56] have what a godsend man when you have a
[1:30:59] a person that's been built for the job
[1:31:01] and they come in what do they do they
[1:31:02] create order out of that chaos and they
[1:31:04] keep things in line amen
[1:31:07] it says what look at this and out of the
[1:31:09] ground made the lord god to grow every
[1:31:11] tree that is pleasant to the sight and
[1:31:13] good for food for the tree of life also
[1:31:16] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[1:31:18] of knowledge of good and eagle good and
[1:31:20] evil rather and then god had prepared a
[1:31:22] place just for adam
[1:31:24] for adam's talents for adam's body for
[1:31:26] the way he was built for the way he
[1:31:28] thought everything was prepared so that
[1:31:30] when adam stepped in he knew just what
[1:31:31] to do and how to do it and he could get
[1:31:33] his shoulders right in and put it
[1:31:35] against the wheel amen what did it take
[1:31:37] it took water
[1:31:38] listen only god can bring the water
[1:31:41] i can stand up here brother joe can
[1:31:42] stand up here and he we can preach till
[1:31:44] we're blue in the face
[1:31:46] we can sing until we can't breathe and
[1:31:47] we can dance until we fall over but
[1:31:49] unless god sends the holy ghost reign
[1:31:51] it's not going to make a lick of
[1:31:52] difference does it it starts with god
[1:31:54] each and every single time
[1:31:57] but what when the rain comes there's a
[1:31:59] people that can what latch into the mind
[1:32:02] of god and they can take what that rain
[1:32:03] brings and they can turn it into what
[1:32:05] the purpose of god they can turn it into
[1:32:08] things that god has called them to do
[1:32:09] and be in their lives amen and then
[1:32:12] after that what did god do after the
[1:32:14] rain came he brought a man then after
[1:32:16] that he brought a woman
[1:32:17] guess what it wasn't good for the man to
[1:32:19] be alone so he brought his sister along
[1:32:21] didn't he so there's a place for a man
[1:32:23] and there's a place for a sister and we
[1:32:24] spent 18 or 19 sermons covering it but
[1:32:27] there's a purpose and there's a meaning
[1:32:28] for each and every one of us amen we are
[1:32:30] built and we're set up a particular way
[1:32:33] to do what
[1:32:34] to tend our own gardens
[1:32:36] each of us has a garden and some of it's
[1:32:38] just going to be a family garden and
[1:32:39] guess what it's not just a family garden
[1:32:41] if you've got a family garden god has
[1:32:43] given you a tremendous responsibility
[1:32:44] brothers and sisters alike but then some
[1:32:47] are called to what they're called to
[1:32:48] ministries they're called the deacon
[1:32:49] ships they're called to evangelism
[1:32:51] they're called for workplace gardening
[1:32:53] and then they're called to bring people
[1:32:54] in that don't know the lord and these
[1:32:56] different things but god never puts a
[1:32:58] man or woman here that is his child
[1:33:00] without a purpose and he always builds
[1:33:02] them for what to take the load of
[1:33:04] whatever he's asking them to do amen and
[1:33:06] then psalms 139
[1:33:09] as we start to close it says for thou
[1:33:11] has possessed my reigns
[1:33:13] that means he's guided you
[1:33:15] even when you don't realize it even when
[1:33:16] you don't think it he was the one that
[1:33:18] was what turning you i was having a
[1:33:20] conversation with one of blanca's
[1:33:22] brothers when we were down in california
[1:33:24] of course all of her brothers have uh
[1:33:26] have left the message and and whatnot
[1:33:28] but
[1:33:29] she's got one brother that's very
[1:33:31] respectful and you talk about things he
[1:33:33] says you know you've got to believe in
[1:33:34] free will right and i said no
[1:33:36] i said not really i said because what
[1:33:38] i'm predestinated
[1:33:40] i said that means that i'm going to go
[1:33:41] there whether i think i want to or not
[1:33:44] i said you get into permissive will and
[1:33:45] you get into perfect will and i said i
[1:33:47] have a choice to go easy or have a
[1:33:49] choice to go hard but one way or another
[1:33:50] he's going to get me there so i said
[1:33:53] there's some free will there but i said
[1:33:54] it ain't all free will because he's
[1:33:56] already told me where i'm going i said
[1:33:58] and there's people that aren't told
[1:33:59] where they're going there's people
[1:34:00] that's going to be outside the gates and
[1:34:02] guess what there was no guarantee that
[1:34:03] they'd make it i said those are the only
[1:34:05] ones that truly have free will are the
[1:34:06] ones that are not predestinated because
[1:34:08] the rest of us he's predestinated where
[1:34:10] we're going to be he's producing what
[1:34:11] we're going to do and we may come in
[1:34:13] with a reward and we may come in without
[1:34:15] a reward but we're going to be there
[1:34:16] regardless because we're his children
[1:34:18] but it's the ones that don't have a
[1:34:19] predestination inside them that have a
[1:34:21] true true free will because they get to
[1:34:23] choose and brother brahm says you choose
[1:34:25] which way you go you choose to go to
[1:34:27] hell
[1:34:28] everyone in the world they choose to go
[1:34:29] to health they want they can choose to
[1:34:30] go to heaven there's a path made for
[1:34:32] them amen for thou hast possessed my
[1:34:35] reigns thou has covered me in my
[1:34:37] mother's womb i will praise thee for i
[1:34:40] am fearfully and wonderfully made that's
[1:34:43] not just david talk and that's each and
[1:34:44] every one of us are fearfully and
[1:34:46] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[1:34:49] and that my soul knoweth right well
[1:34:52] my substance was not hid from thee when
[1:34:54] i was made in secret and curiously
[1:34:56] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:34:58] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[1:35:01] being imperfect and in thy book all my
[1:35:05] members were written which in
[1:35:06] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:35:09] there was none of them so before your
[1:35:11] strengths were known he saw them and
[1:35:13] before you were ever completed he knew
[1:35:15] what you'd be why because he wrote it in
[1:35:17] his book amen amen he's written your
[1:35:20] name he's written your life he's written
[1:35:22] your purpose he's written your end all
[1:35:24] before you ever come to it and all
[1:35:26] you're doing is walking along in that
[1:35:27] and you don't even realize it half the
[1:35:29] time
[1:35:30] how precious are they thoughts unto me
[1:35:32] oh god how great is the sum of them
[1:35:36] brother brown puts it this way
[1:35:41] give me a hand brother brother weishau
[1:35:43] he says he makes men different
[1:35:46] he gives us each one a different place
[1:35:49] and a palm tree can never be a hickory
[1:35:51] a hickory tree can never be a palm
[1:35:54] nobody can take your place and you
[1:35:56] shouldn't try to take anybody else's
[1:35:58] place
[1:35:59] why because you are an individual to god
[1:36:02] and god has a purpose for you he made
[1:36:05] you thus you say why did he do it
[1:36:09] we always say why does why am i like
[1:36:11] this
[1:36:11] and when you say why am i like this what
[1:36:13] you're saying is why did he do this
[1:36:15] and what do we do we don't say that when
[1:36:17] we have strengths do we
[1:36:18] we say it when we have weaknesses
[1:36:20] why do i have this weakness
[1:36:22] listen if i look back at the men in my
[1:36:24] family
[1:36:26] i would never have taken up a a
[1:36:27] preaching mantle because
[1:36:29] to a man they're philanderous uh
[1:36:32] yeah flandering men
[1:36:34] they have problem real problems with
[1:36:36] women
[1:36:37] every single one of them that as far
[1:36:38] back as i know they have problems with
[1:36:40] women that's the last thing you want to
[1:36:41] have as a preacher but guess what
[1:36:43] i've been born again
[1:36:45] and that's one thing that they didn't
[1:36:46] have was they didn't have a new birth
[1:36:48] experience amen
[1:36:49] but what i could look at that and say i
[1:36:51] don't have much of a pedigree
[1:36:53] and we can look at our lives and say
[1:36:54] maybe i don't have much of a pedigree
[1:36:56] why do i deal with these issues why do i
[1:36:58] have this weakness
[1:36:59] why do i have to fight like this
[1:37:02] listen to overcome we've got to fight
[1:37:04] there's got to be a battle somewhere but
[1:37:05] sometimes we say why this sometimes it's
[1:37:08] sickness sometimes it's a mental
[1:37:10] weakness
[1:37:11] i was
[1:37:12] talking with a brother that was talking
[1:37:14] to a guy that said you know what i'm not
[1:37:16] very smart
[1:37:17] i don't have a big iq he says i can't do
[1:37:19] the things that you guys do
[1:37:21] he recognized that but you know what he
[1:37:23] wasn't sitting there beating himself up
[1:37:24] about it
[1:37:25] he was just doing whatever he could do
[1:37:27] and he thanked god for it
[1:37:28] but he recognized that as well
[1:37:30] he recognized that but so often what we
[1:37:32] say is what why did he do it because
[1:37:34] we're facing a weakness we're facing a
[1:37:36] trial we're facing a difficulty in our
[1:37:37] flesh or in our mind
[1:37:39] he says why did he do it he is sovereign
[1:37:42] he's got a reason for it being that way
[1:37:45] he says but we find out that we're all
[1:37:47] guarded by the word
[1:37:50] what is it because he wrote in his book
[1:37:52] he wrote your name he wrote your life he
[1:37:54] wrote your attributes he wrote your
[1:37:56] failures he wrote your mistakes but what
[1:37:58] do you also write
[1:37:59] at the end of your name he wrote
[1:38:01] overcomer
[1:38:03] that's the only reason we overcome we
[1:38:04] don't overcome because we have this and
[1:38:06] we have that and we do this and we do
[1:38:07] that the reason the second eve can't
[1:38:09] fall is because he said she wouldn't
[1:38:11] fall
[1:38:12] that's the only thing that holds us up
[1:38:13] it's his grace that's holding us up it's
[1:38:15] not because we have some superpower in
[1:38:17] and of ourselves we have this discipline
[1:38:18] we have this great strength it's because
[1:38:20] his grace is the thing that holds us up
[1:38:22] and covers everything we do until we can
[1:38:25] get over to that other side amen
[1:38:27] there's two things to take away from
[1:38:28] tonight one you are part of a great
[1:38:32] unfolding of the picture of god
[1:38:35] it isn't over yet
[1:38:37] mighty god unveiled has not been
[1:38:39] completely unveiled yet because why
[1:38:41] you're not fully unveiled you don't see
[1:38:43] yourself as he is and guess what the
[1:38:45] scripture says before where that's
[1:38:46] exactly what we're going to see we're
[1:38:47] going to see him as he is why because
[1:38:49] we'll be like him amen amen you're not
[1:38:52] external to it that's the beauty of this
[1:38:54] we're not looking on to the unfolding of
[1:38:56] god we are a part of the unfolding and
[1:38:59] the unveiling of god amen the second
[1:39:01] thing is that you have a part to play
[1:39:03] and you have a purpose for being here
[1:39:04] you have a purpose for being right here
[1:39:07] today the way you are fallen great
[1:39:10] wonderful whatever you might think
[1:39:12] whatever condition you're in you have a
[1:39:14] purpose and a part to play and it
[1:39:15] doesn't matter what it looks like right
[1:39:16] now god has you here specifically for a
[1:39:20] reason and then god bless you if we
[1:39:22] would stand together
[1:39:24] i mean i'll invite the musicians to come
[1:39:26] i just wanted to set a foundation
[1:39:28] there's so much in here there is so much
[1:39:30] in here and uh thank you
[1:39:33] sometimes it's hard to to just hold back
[1:39:35] and go for an hour hour and five minutes
[1:39:38] but uh by god's grace we'll continue
[1:39:39] this on sunday and maybe on the rest of
[1:39:42] the month as the lord would lead but
[1:39:44] just trying to set us up to have some
[1:39:45] expectation that listen
[1:39:48] god has been unveiled
[1:39:49] god has been unfolded in our lives and
[1:39:51] we haven't seen the we haven't seen the
[1:39:53] last of it and then we didn't see only
[1:39:55] in a prophet there's things that he's
[1:39:56] going to be unveiling in each and every
[1:39:58] one of us and i think in hindsight so
[1:40:00] often that's when we're going to realize
[1:40:01] what he was doing and how he was opening
[1:40:03] himself up i think we're going to get to
[1:40:04] that other side and there's going to be
[1:40:06] many things we'll be like i didn't
[1:40:07] realize what he was doing i didn't
[1:40:09] realize the effect that he was having on
[1:40:11] my life
[1:40:12] then you look back and you realize what
[1:40:13] a change he's made amen and what he's
[1:40:15] done in our lives let's just bow our
[1:40:16] heads
[1:40:18] heavenly father
[1:40:21] lord you said to your disciples
[1:40:24] lord you said
[1:40:27] don't be so happy
[1:40:29] because demons obey you and sicknesses
[1:40:32] are healed
[1:40:33] but you said rejoice because your names
[1:40:35] are on the lamb's book of life amen and
[1:40:37] lord we're here to rejoice in that
[1:40:39] tonight lord we're here to rejoice that
[1:40:41] you called us lord that you've you've
[1:40:42] made us a part of your unveiling lord
[1:40:44] that you've made us a part of the form
[1:40:46] of god that people can look at us lord
[1:40:48] that they can see us lord in that maybe
[1:40:51] they won't recognize it but yet lord
[1:40:52] there's a testimony that you are alive
[1:40:54] and well today
[1:40:56] and lord we pray that you would just
[1:40:57] help us to to lift ourselves up into
[1:40:59] your word lord not by pride lord or
[1:41:01] anything lord but that as we look into
[1:41:03] your word lord we would say be it unto
[1:41:05] me according to your word lord that we
[1:41:07] would look past this fallen nature lord
[1:41:09] this carnal flesh the mistakes lord that
[1:41:12] we would look to that shed blood lord
[1:41:14] and that we would look to that holy
[1:41:15] spirit that lives within us heavenly
[1:41:17] father and say that greater is he that
[1:41:19] is in us than he that is in the world
[1:41:21] lord would you just help us to lord step
[1:41:24] up lord in faith lord to just trust you
[1:41:26] to look to you lord to to want to be
[1:41:29] that expression heavenly father and to
[1:41:31] open up our lives to you lord so that
[1:41:33] you could have your way through us we
[1:41:34] pray
[1:41:35] lord we don't want to be selfish with
[1:41:37] what we have lord we don't want to sit
[1:41:39] here lord with with an attitude of we're
[1:41:41] elite because we have it lord but we
[1:41:42] want to have the heart of a servant to
[1:41:44] say i have something that other people
[1:41:46] need and to go around lord and be
[1:41:48] willing to give it to anybody that would
[1:41:50] receive of us lord give us courage lord
[1:41:52] to face rejection
[1:41:54] lord give us wisdom lord give us
[1:41:56] humility lord to settle down lord to
[1:41:58] have the right reaction each and every
[1:42:00] time we pray
[1:42:01] lord make us ministers for you we pray
[1:42:03] lord in our own little special way we
