[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen Lord bless you say Amen I'll try to be as brief as I can but to welcome my brother Jonathan curl it to Newfoundland amen you might not feel like he's surrounded by the new friend had this fear but amen he is in Newfoundland this is amazing absolutely amazing brother sister where we are when it comes to science but again where are we when it comes to the spiritual and the Holy Ghost as I mentioned I believe a couple of services ago the prophet of God said that that it was God he said that that for Dane the invention of the tapes and the tape recorders east of what for ISA for the recording of this message this endtime message well brother how far ahead are we now we've gone beyond the tape recorders especially those tape recorders I remember them as I said III maybe I think I still got one in the basement here one or two and and we've had a lot of those doors though so the old-fashioned tapes of the message all the big reel to reels oh yeah we had to put one of them on it's not a nun but I put on a cassette not put on a CD no no no no put on a large tape and you and you watch that tape roll and roll and roll and roll and the Prophet bring the message but now look where we are now a man we've gone beyond cassette tapes we've gone beyond CDs you know to the place aware I've mentioned to our brother Matthew the other night I said this is amazing I said our brother I said in British Columbia I said can preach to us here in Newfoundland and I said not just his voice but I said we're going to see him a man yes exactly and knowing that he can look and see us and hear our response by the grace of Almighty God our brother I believe that that's also a sign of how close we are to eternity amen when we consider what's going on scientifically brother be on your guard because we're about to break into eternity science is doing it and the problem of God is even I lighted that many years ago I believe concerning science breaking into eternity or trying to break into eternity any any reference so that the the those that went into space some years ago but the first ones that went into space and they and they asked him about and they said well it was amazing and he said but he said we didn't see God we saw this saw distance all that but we didn't see God but oh yeah you know God saw them a man so brothers sisters just think how far that we have advanced scientifically when again technology when it comes to recording the message and preaching the message all praise the Lord the no wonder the Bible says and you know that it's going to be the gospel is coming preach through the whole world a million that's the truth now not the message but the gospel the revelation of Jesus Christ the prophet of God said no so we want we won't be able to get this message to everyone but he said just to the elect he said just to the right and to get her out and get her in to eternity but he said the get the gospel is going to be preached to the whole world the revelation of Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior but they won't get the revelation that you and I are getting concerning the resurrection and the rapture amen and brothers so we as if science is blending into eternity what are we doing a man and this is just as this is just an indication brother in the natural and indication of what's going on in the spiritual just think as we partake of this tonight with our brother Jonathan so far away and not only that brother the brother ministry to us but it all praise the Lord you talk about the east meeting the West a man praise the name of the Lord the power of God also highlighted those things of the east meeting the West the Sun that rises in these is gonna set in the West a man and God is going to give us the revelation of the Sun in the West a man through our brother Jonathan so god bless our brother Jonathan as he comes to Minister us to us tonight we pray the grace of God to be with him and and and to anoint him to bring forth a man what we need to hear he did it last night and we thank God for the word but I just want to remind you that I have notes here concerning two sermons that our brother preached in November of 2019 a man it was November the 10th our brother ministered and on a Sunday and again on November the 9th he ministered on a Saturday hey man so 9 and 10 Saturday and Sunday well now he's ministering Friday and Saturday so god bless our brother Jonathan and glad again to hear his ministry and to hear the Lord amen speaking to our brother to provide us with what we need amen and what do we need we need the word Amen by the grace of God for the faith by the grace it is by grace through faith that were saved amen so we praise the grace of God that they're going to give us the faith we need tonight to move us on and God bless our brother Jonathan and anoint him a man with the revelation of the word a man and brother it's not just just what it was years ago but brother this is this is this is not ordained to get us to talk about justification sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost no it's pushing its arm forward further into the revelation of resurrection and the rapture the change you talk about walking with God and brother if there's ever an hour we need the revelation of overcomers as our brother was preaching last night we need the revelation tonight there were lot overcomers not just overcome yes the flesh yes but overcome the the world the flesh and the devil amen so that we're going to go from time to eternity and pray the grace of God that by the word that our brother Jonathan will bring tonight that we don't get it'll increase our faith and give us a greater faith to press on a man by the grace of God and again as I had this notes from the previous messages he preached here in November and also the notes that he preached left from the message he preached last night and thank the Lord for it and just to remind our brother that it takes us deeper into the word oh yeah moving us on by the grace of God to say that as a result of our brothers sermon last night it led me to three three messages that the president that the prophet of God has preached a man just think of that and I said Lord this is tremendous and I said that you're you're laying it on that brother's heart to preach him to minister I said supposed to take us out further into the word a man and the three messages that the Lord laid on my heart and the Lord led me to after our brother was finished preaching was the oncoming storm a man that the Prophet preached in 19 and 60 and then another one was humble thyself that he preached in 1963 and tremendous in August 1963 the Prophet preached how can I overcome a man so thank God for the message through our brother Jonathan to give us more revelation concerning overcoming amen by the grace of God so we're going to turn it to our brother Jonathan I could go on but we're going to our brother Jonathan and pray the grace of God bless him again with a further and greater revelation of the word according to our need tonight amen those here very few of us here but again those online god bless them amen and also to yes remember our brother Eber in prayer and I did it wasn't mentioned but let me explain it that he did call me and he asked me to pray for him on the phone and he felt so low and food so discouraged and so depressed and so I pray for him on the phone and he called me the next morning eight o'clock in the morning and he said thank you thank you thank your brother it was wonderful he said thank you he said God answered prayer and he said feeling wonderful now he's to thank the Lord so he said I said well brother I'll keep we'll keep you in prayer and he wanted me to pass on his greetings to the Saints here in the church as well so God keep keep him in prayer and God continue to bless our brother Heber amen he was he was just feeling wonderful and explaining to me some things that he felt to do and again of course he's looking after in the cemetery that we have down there and he did say he did go to the cemetery and of course he's got he's got a in the cemetery that he that he goes and sits on and he said I went to the cemetery brother and he said and he said I sat down and he said I talked to sister green so that's good praise the name of the Lord and I said yes you talk to her oh yes he said I talked to him that's good praise said white or not dirt they're only right there in another dimension so I pray the grace of God help us and again she want to give our brother Jonathan the understanding the revelation that he's not preaching to just a few he's preaching to more than what he can see amen that is the absolute truth because there's many that will hear it amen to God be the glory so brother Jonathan god bless you we're going to turn it over to you what we're going to ask I'm going to ask him to stand here and we'll sing only believe and turn to our brother Jonathan praise the name of the Lord hallelujah oh maybe Oh only be [Music] things are keys is's here is as easy [Applause] gee [Music] all things are possible yes she's a sushi and Jesus is with her brother a man praise the name of the Lord [Music] Jonathan [Music] a mad human god bless you Saints this evening for the Gerald thank you for the warm welcome then by tteyuu want of you to turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 4 we're just going to continue on the theme of the overcomer tonight I'm going to preach on the overcomers answer Luke chapter form we'll start at verse 1 just wanted to thank each one of you for the the responses from yesterday I got a lot of texts and email from brother Gerald just thanking me and saying everything went well so certainly appreciate brother Matt doing the work to get the technology to work through and certainly glad that each one of you was touched by the word just trusting we'll continue the same tonight amen it's also Jensen's birthday today's he's 5 years old so we pushed his his birthday back a little bit so I can preach this afternoon but we'll have a special time for him but certainly want to thank the Lord for the blessing he's been to us into the family amen we're gonna do a bit of preaching tonight a little bit of teaching a little bit of practical application so just hang in there I've got a lot on my plate I was telling brother mark last night I said I don't get to preach very often so there's a lot in there and it tends to come out really quickly so forgive me for my fast start yesterday hopefully I slowed down a bit Blanca held up the slow down sign and so I'm just trusting I can relax a bit today and just go through it nice and easy everyone's in the comfort of their homes we should be able to handle it without any issue so amen Luke chapter 4 verse 1 it says in Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hunger amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we once again open your word Lord we pray that you administer to the hearts and souls of the people that are listening and watching Heavenly Father Lord may you just touch our lives Lord you know that I'm speaking according to what you've led me to do but just praying that you would help it define rest Lord fertile ground in the lives of the hearers Lord Jesus touches each one helped me to just settle down get out of the way Lord it's not easy to preach this way but just praying that you would have your perfect way and will in your Oh Lord Ross close to you Lord may we just feel and and Lord know that your presence is near us in your name we ask and pray amen like I said I'm hoping to maybe bring this into a bit of a practical side today but we'll start with a bit of teaching and we'll work our way through amen but it's certainly a time of adversity today and when we see what's going on with this Cova 19 virus and we see the economic fallout of this and we see the way the world is going politically we see the worry the world is going religiously it's just a mess and I believe the closer we get to the to the rapture the closer we get to that resurrection time then we're going to see more and more adversity we're going to see more and more trials things are going to be more and more difficult for us amen and yet the closer we get to God the more apparent the attacks of Satan are going to be for us and we've read that quote last night that said that overcoming was what when we recognized Satan and every one of his tricks but also that we recognize that he that is in us is greater than he that's attacking us amen and so we know Satan has only one goal and that's to try and keep us from fulfilling the purpose that we are here on the earth for and that's to what step into our position in Christ and fully Express the word for our day amen and that's the thing he fears most on this earth I think is that blood-bought bride when she steps into her place he know she's gonna go and when that's done then the wrath of God comes down and we know that the countdown starts ticking for Satan they meant he knows the book of Revelation he knows he's only got a little bit of time then and then he comes down and what his rage because he knows that his end is near so all he's trying to do his last hope that he has here is to stop that bride from taking her place amen we know that the first Adam didn't fall but the first deed did and because of that now we had Christ come the second Adam and he didn't fall and now it's the second Eve's turn and she can't fall this time amen and thank God we know that the overcomer the bride of this age will not fall and so Satan is still doing everything he can because it's his only thing to hold back the wrath of God and final judgment Allah made men so we're going to talk tonight about the overcomers answer and it starts with the the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness and this is a well-known story I know and believe me this was a temptation for Jesus this was something that he had to go through and and we see how he was led into the wilderness here and as he goes into this temptation we don't want to get the wrong thought about it temptation because so often we say it's wrong to be tempted but we know that when you're in a body of flesh that you're gonna be tempted as in Satan's gonna come over and who's gonna drop things in he's gonna put things in front of you he's going to put opportunity tuna tees in front of you and as we said it's only the inner man that is saved it's only ender man that's redeemable the outer man and those five senses on the outside and then the imagination that they're not redeemed they're not they're not the Holy Spirit does not dwell in them but rather it overcomes them amen and so those things when those things are rise up and they say hey I like that they show that desire that's not wrong for us right that's just that part of our body doing what it's meant to do amen it's in a sinful condition it's in an unredeemed condition but the believers started to beat themselves up when they faced this and the simple fact is is that it's not wrong to be tempted but rather how you react to that what you do with it is what determines whether or not you're in the right or wrong amen there's the same that says you can't stop birds from flying overhead but you can stop them from building a nest and that's what the believer does is when these temptations come as he pushes past them it says I don't want any part of that and moves on and the Holy Spirit keeps them out of his life and that's when he wins the victory amen you can't stop the opportunity from being presented to you but you can stop it from sticking around and you possibly getting tripped up and then the Holy Spirit just says hey none of that here and let's move on amen so let's start to read again in verse 1 it says and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness and one thing we want to grasp here really quickly is that this is not a trial of Satan's making it says that Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit in another place in the scripture woman it's talking about storm it doesn't say that the spirit led him it says that the spirit drove him into the wilderness and then he was compelled he was forced he didn't have a choice here but rather the Holy Spirit pushes him into a place of desolation a place of emptiness a place that can't sustain him and says you've got to go here now and so Satan doesn't set this up but rather Satan takes the offer any of this trial to now come in and start to tempt Jesus amen so that's a lesson for us to learn is when you're going through a tough time it's so easy to say Satan's put this in front of me Satan is the one that's caused this amen thinking of brother Matt there and just lost a job it's easy to say Satan took the job away Satan brought this cove at 19 our way and killed our economy in these different things but I believe so often for a believer the tough times are not orchestrated by Satan but rather Satan takes advantage of those tough times to try and get us in a moment of weakness amen but we know that the Son of God the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord and he delights in his way we want to rest that just because it's a tough time does not mean Satan's working but genuinely it means God's working and Satan's just trying to piggyback in that tough time to trip us up they men moving on to verse 2 just to say if your conscience is clear in a trial and God hasn't shown you anything then you can rest assured that he's with you in it and he has a purpose amen he's going to use it for your good amen verse 2 says been 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hunger I think that's probably the greatest understatement the Bible is that Jesus was hungry after for 40 days without food amen i remember when blanca did a water fast for 17 days and by the end she could barely walk or stand or go up the stairs or anything I can't imagine what it was like for Jesus in 40 days and it says throughout the 40 days the devil was tempting him the whole time so he's getting progressively and progressively physically weaker and Satan's applying the pressure more and more throughout at amen but Satan is like that he doesn't want to get you when you're in your prime you'll notice that Satan doesn't start right after you've ever have a revival or something like that he gives you a little bit of time and then what does he do he starts to come in on the cracks and and nibble around the edges to try and get you but generally when Satan's coming for you it's when you're in a moment of weakness when things aren't going so good amen he never comes in when the preaching is great and the song service was perfect and you've got great fellowship and tons of money in the bank and your job is working so well but rather he comes win when things get tough when the marriage isn't going so well maybe the preacher isn't doing so well maybe the song leader is really annoying you because he sings the same songs over and over again but he comes in and then he starts to do what nibble around at the edges and get you to kind of get a little bit unhappy hearing a little bit dissatisfied with this and a little bit envious of that and dad to dr. Don pretty soon what he's got a weakness and he starts to tear away at the victory you had and all of a sudden you're down in the valley again they meant verse three the Devil attacks Jesus here and he said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made bread and then the first thing I want you to notice here is that Satan is wanting to get Jesus to react to him Satan wants to drive the conversation Satan has a plan of attack here and he's wanting to make this thing go the way that he has in his head because he set traps along the way and so if he can get Jesus to respond to him as he's given Jesus this challenged then he knows that he can beat Jesus so that's what he wants us to do is Satan is always trying to get us to respond to the situation rather than get us to respond to the word him and he wants us to be reactive rather than resting amen so Satan goes right for the jugular here and what's the first thing he does he challenges Jesus on his position he challenges Jesus deity he says look if you're the Son of God then do something and not only that but he's tricky because he's what he's doing is he's tying Jesus deity to Satan's challenge and saying you're only the Son of God if you do what I say and that's gonna be a trap every time when Satan comes against us and he's not gonna come as as he did with Jesus in in personal form so to speak but he's gonna have somebody come your way whether it's a co-worker or somebody you run into in in business or these different things maybe just out and about maybe it's somebody online these days amen you can run into so many people if you're on Facebook and these different things and all of a sudden somebody'll throw something in your face and challenge you as a believer right and what if you answer according to the way that they've challenged you then you're gonna follow into a trap every time you're gonna get sucked into their world rather than standing on the word amen so what sames doing here is he sets his own criteria to determine what makes him the Son of God and he says what turn these stones into bread he says Jesus you're a tough situation let's use your gift to make you do a little more you know you're hungry you know you're weak you know you have the capability to create if you're the Son of God so let's turn these stones into bread amen now does Jesus have anything to prove to Satan is there anything that should make Jesus answer Satan the way he does and no he doesn't have to we don't have to answer Satan's challenge when he comes to us picking a fight in that way but brother branham gives us an insight into why Jesus doesn't ignore Satan because he could have he could have just said you know Satan go away go away just leave me alone I'm out here for some some time alone but he doesn't he answers him brother branham gives us a reason as to why he did it and how he did it and the message Satan's Eden he says Jesus didn't clown for him speaking of Satan he says he never did God is not a clown he don't have to answer anything that Satan asks jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God see he didn't have to clown from him he didn't have to make bread you ever notice how people challenge Christians these days because we want to take our spiritual thinking caps and put them on now because we're not talking about Jesus we want to talk about the Bride of Christ as well and how Satan comes against Jesus is how he's going to come against the bride so what do they do when the world comes against us when Satan comes against us of people under his influence and what not what does he do he sets his own criteria for what makes us Christians and if we don't give them the answer they want that makes us a hypocrite and if we don't give them the other answer that they want then we're unloving and then we're against so-and-so and such-and-such and whatnot and they get us to answer according to their kind Amen but rather we need to answer according to God's thinking we need to answer in the way that His Word tells us to answer and Jesus gives us the example of of how this is right we've got so many unworldly or worldly people out there trying to tell us what it means to be a Christian and they set these criteria and they think they know what it means and the the common thing you'll hear is well don't you love them or God is love in these different things and they set all sorts of responses that we're supposed to have him ways to live that would make us a Christian in their eyes but we don't answer this Satan as to whether or not we're a Christian but rather our Christianity lies in the one that gives us the power in the first place which is Christ through his word Amen so we want to be able to answer according to the word as opposed to what they want us to amen but those people so often feel qualified to tell us whether or not we're Christians and if we get sucked into that argument we're gonna lose every time because you can't prove to somebody if they don't already believe you're Christian chances are they're not going to if you continue to work with them continue to answer them according to their their ideas amen but Jesus first challenges not just to turn turn stones into bread but rather his first challenges on Jesus position why because he's scared of Jesus deity because if Jesus is the Son of God then Satan knows that this is the one that's going to take the world from him this is the lamb that's going to take that book at the end and is going to take what that abstract title deed and have whole proper the whole property of Satan everything that he squatted on down on this earth will belong to Jesus so he's trying to get him to trip up because if he can trip him up then he knows that he can hold on to that world amen and sayings kind of smarted that way but he's also a little bit dumb because what he's attacking shows what he fears most so if he's attacking you you have to say what is it about Satan's attack that he's worried about here what is it that he's poking at at me that bothers him because that's what we need to rise up then and and and address the situation amen if he's going after you in your sickness then say that means he's scared of the healing that I have a minute pieces attacking your integrity it's because he's worried that your integrity is what holds and gives you influence over people in these different things so he's coming in and where he attacks is what he's scared of the most amen and that's what he does with Jesus amen Satan doesn't go around telling unbelievers that they're not children of God we know that right he doesn't go around attacking his own people rather he's going to come after those that aren't of his kingdom why because he's wants to bring them out from under their salvation and bring them into his kingdom so that he can attack even more Christians amen Matthew 12 verse 25 says and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation in every city or house divided against itself shall not stand they were accusing Jesus of being of Satan if you remember he says if I did these things of Satan and I'm fighting against my own Kingdom so Satan's coming against you of Satan's challenging you it's a really good sign that you're a child of God amen because he's not going after his own people he's only going after those that haven't given their worship to him amen why does he first attack Jesus position again that's the thing he's most scared of because that has dominion Jesus deity has dominion over Satan and so when he attacks our position why is it because our position as the body of Christ has dominion over Satan in exactly the same way amen he is under our feet each and every one of us as sons and daughters of God and if he can get us out from under our position than what he knows that he has a chance to take us out but the minute we recognize our position we have full control and authority over him amen everything falls into place when we recognize who we are in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Branham says now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position they says it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is they men when the Bride of Christ when the true church knows what it is and we know that's what the tokens for here today the Holy Spirit is quickening us daily to live out what our position is in Christ until one day we step out of this body and into a glorious body to be with him amen moving on to verse four it says and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God we know Jesus is quoting Deuteronomy eight here and I'll turn to it where I've got it in my notes you don't have to turn unless you want to definitely hold your place in Luke because we'll be coming back to it but in Deuteronomy 8 verse 2 it says and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness now notice here the continuity of Scripture there's 40 years in the wilderness there's 40 years of temptation improving for Jesus we see Moses was in the wilderness 40 years we see Moses was on the for 40 days to receive the law from God amen we see these different things and we know then that Jesus is when he gets through these 40 days then there's a reward that comes after it amen there's a promise there's a fulfillment of ministry that's going to come after that because after Israel finished those 40 years what did they do they stepped into the Promised Land amen under the leadership of Joshua which would be a type of the Holy Spirit so what is this time of temptation about then it says it's what remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness to do what and we'll start to read in verse 2 but it's about proving that's what I said about temptation is that this is not just about did you feel like you wanted to do this instead of that and did you feel right or wrong but rather this is about showing what you value most what's at the very core of your being and when we strip everything away what is it that holds us then what comes out of us and when you're completely tired when you're completely worn out when you're completely hungry when you have no strength left to fight whatever comes out of you then is what you are and that's what this time of temptation and trial is for Jesus it's proving that he has what it takes to what step into that full son of man ministry on the earth amen and so what is it we'll see in our lives right we're gonna have to prove what we're at when times are tough are you gonna choose family over your career amen are you going to choose money over fellowship are you gonna choose integrity over compromise are you gonna choose easy living over honest work amen verse 2 in Deuteronomy 8 says what was the purpose of wandering in the wilderness it says to Humble thee right proving that what if you're a child of God it doesn't give you a right to be arrogant further Bram said an arrogant spirit is never of God and when you see arrogance coming out it means that God's moved away and that person's personality is taking over amen we want to keep ourselves humble he says the humble thee and to prove thee amen everything that's on the inside is going to be manifested on the outside eventually and in this case it took 40 years for the unbelievers to die and for the believers to say we're ready to move in but it proved because as soon as they came to that River Jordan they all crossed over and what did they do they started taking all or the land amen testing is what's going to prove what's ingrained in you and that's really where I want to find myself is not just that I had when I have time to think and process and and kind of coin a perfect response to a situation but rather when something hits you hard and fast the first thing that instinctively comes out of your mind is what the Word of God amen there's a little funny story I I hurt my ankle last weekend real bad I've been sending the interesting pictures of the many color changes my foots going through throughout the week to Joe and a couple different others but I've been the gyms are closed and I like to workout and I haven't been able to so I have some of these exercise bands that I use and I was using them and Jensen came down in the room and he said can I try and to hold them in place you have to put them under your feet and then you can stretch them to you know do the exercises and whatnot so I set him up and I stepped on it with my bad foot with my bad ankle and he pulled it as high as he could and then he let it go right into my bad foot now as my good friend Mark Esser would say you know in situations like that typically bad words would start to form in the back of your brain and hopefully never make it out of your mouth but God's grace that didn't happen with me because what happened is it didn't actually strike my foot first rather it hit the ground and then just kind of lightly hit it but the more to make the point that if he would have hit my foot the thing that should have come out is maybe ouch or yoyoyo or you know something like that but it what you're hoping for is that it would not be the words that nobody wants to be caught saying as a believer Amen why is it because what's ingrained in us is what would come out and so you're trusting in a situation like that you wouldn't curse whether it's in your mind or out that loud god forbid amen but this time is to know what the scripture says to prove ly to know what was in thine heart it says what whether that would keep his Commandments or no amen whether what was his commandment his commandment wasn't just the the ten laws that were written on stone amen but his commandment was that I've given you a land of milk honey and I want you to go possess it amen we don't just want to have obedience to the to the requirements of God for holiness in a sanctified life and whatnot but rather we want to have full obedience which what takes us into the Promised Land amen so Jesus knows his place I mean if there's one person that knew the scriptures and knew his position in it it was Jesus at the age of twelve years old he's in the temple and what's he doing he's teaching the scribes and Pharisees and at that time when when his parents leave without him and then come back and his mother says your father and I were worried he says hey that's not my dad you know who my dad is right he knew who he was at the age of twelve so by this time when he's you know thirty years old he knows that he is the son of God he knows he's the land the Holy Spirit's come down in the form of a dove and and vindicated him that way so Jesus knows all these things and he's now looking at this scripture that Satan's misusing and understanding where Satan's coming from and now he's able to correctly answer the challenge that Satan gives to him amen he knows he's got to be humble he knows he's got to be proven amen his innermost desires have to be shown clearly so his answer has to reflect that humility and his innermost desire right and his innermost desire has to be what does the Holy Spirit have for me in this trial amen not to get out of the trial but what is it I'm supposed to get out of this that's his purpose amen verse three Deuteronomy 8 says any humble thee and suffer thee to hunger amen notice that God allowed them to hunger first and then he brought the manna afterwards he supernaturally met the need after the hunger we have to hunger sometimes we have to thirst we have to go without we have to have a lack of things sometimes so that it'll just heighten that desire amen it'll it'll get us calling for more of God and then he comes on the scene in an even more supernatural way amen so he suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord that man lived amen so Jesus has no worry about the fact that he's hungry why because when he goes back to the scripture thus saith the scripture that Satan is using here and team back to Jesus understands that God provides at the end of this no matter what so he says I don't need to provide food God's live at me into the trial that means God will provide sustenance in the trial and after the trial I'm not going to die in the trial and then after the trial I'm gonna get what he promised amen amen he knows there's heavenly manna waiting for him after this trial brother Branham gives this beautiful explanation of what Jesus did here from the very start and then how he kind of goes through this and I didn't know that most of you have heard this quote but I wanted to read it to kind of set a tone as we go through the service this evening amen in the message what is that in your hand he said Jesus defeated Satan without using any divine gift that he had why showing that the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan on the word of God amen praise the Lord what a statement that the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan on the word of God so that means every single one of us that is a professing believer that's been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy Spirit no matter how weak we are how we feel we are it means that every single one of us can debate it to feed him when we correctly apply the word of God in every situation brother Branham takes us even further and and in the church ages and he says so when a spirit born spirit fill man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man he doesn't say stand before that word he says stand before that man why because the unity of the word you and Christ together makes it all the same thing he says when you put that on your lips then that makes you deity speaking a man we spoke of that yesterday when we said you have to take it as Christ did where he thought it not robbery to be equal with God brother Branham says when you take the word on your lips with that same anointing and that same inspiration that is deity speaking out of each and every one of us say men so if you're looking for a good reason to know your Bible that's one really good one right there is that you have to be able to correctly apply it and be inspired by the Holy Spirit amen so you can respond to Satan every time and every temptation with it is written just as Jesus did brother Bram says and you will defeat Satan every single time so it's not about your argument it's not about your idea it's not about the logical strength of your response a men as the world would look at it but rather if you stays just strictly strictly with the Word of God as it is written and that is your response you know then that when it's purity it will answer and it will stand for you and it will defeat Satan every time Amen brother branham that said this and this this to me was just such an encouragement because as much as we'd like to think it we have times where we don't have very much faith isn't that right we have times where we feel weak you know well I won't say that maybe in confidence but speaking with with someone that's been going through a real trial lately and and a great man of God a great minister and and he spoke of how weak he feels at times and yet in at all you know being strengthened by God but we have these times no matter how much we preach over a pulpit no matter how big our prayer life is and how much we read our Bible there still comes times where something hits us so hard that it sets us back and we're just sitting at the bottom of the valley wondering how we got there amen listen to what brother Graham said and the message believe us now this he says everybody wouldn't have gifts amen gifts of faith gifts of healing gifts of discernment and these different things he says Jesus brought it down to a place where those who do not have gifts amen that do not have very much faith could just say it is written so if you don't feel you have gifts if you don't feel you have very much faith he says you could just say it is written there it is and then stand right on it jesus said that the Word of God is a seed that a sower sowed and every word of God every promise of God will bring forth of its kind amen I believe I preached on a guaranteed outcome the last time I was in Newfoundland and if you want a place to anchor it that's it he says every promise of God will bring forth of its kind amen so resting there rather than something of your own making is what's going to bring you the peace and rest and bring you the victory amen amen let's move on to verse 5 in Luke chapter 4 moving on to the next temptation it says in the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto Him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will I give it if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine Amen now we know we there should be no doubt in our minds as to who the ruler of this world is right now I'm in this is Satan's Eden and the sooner we recognize it and accept it the easier our battle is actually going to be because we won't get so caught up in the politics we won't get so caught up in the economic issues and the way things are going and how things are sliding downhill and dad to doubt to doubt why because it's Satan's Eden that's exactly what it's supposed to do it's supposed to go downhill it's supposed to be judged and it's gonna be burned with fire at the end amen so if we can accept that and recognize that it's gonna make it easier because then when things come against us from this side of the world you know from the world itself and whatnot we just understand that Satan's Kingdom coming against the but what the kingdom of heaven they meant so look at what Jesus offers it Jesus has offered here because it is Satan's to offer at that time amen the lamb has not come down with that abstract title deed yet so Satan squatting on it and he has possession over for now embed and what's the price that Jesus has to pay in order to get this possession he has to worship Satan amen he asked to put Satan more specifically in a position of authority over Jesus amen but Satan again in his testing in his trial and his temptation here he exposes his weakness because Satan wouldn't ask for Jesus to submit to him if Jesus was already under submission to him if Jesus was under Satan's Authority if Satan had power over Jesus he wouldn't be asking him to give it to him amen look at it this way I don't ask my kids to obey me I tell my kids to obey me and they obey me why because I'm the father and I have authority over them at least until they're 18 but if I told my kids what I'll give you money I'll give you gifts I'll give you this favor that favor if you'll what obey me now that's me saying okay you have a choice here I don't have authority over you you have to choose to obey me and so Satan's got this say thing with Jesus he knows he has no authority over Jesus Satan has to get this worship from Jesus willingly Jesus has to give it to on they men so and then we see another beautiful lesson here if you want to know the value of what you have look at what Satan's giving you in return for what he's asking of you so he's asking Jesus for worship he's asking to put him in a place Satan in a place of headship over him and what Satan is willing to give up every single thing that he has ownership of on the earth for that one thing from Jesus so we start to take that back to our lives but let's just stop there just for a moment because what's he offering right he's offering Jesus what Jesus wants to have anyways he knows Jesus wants and he knows that the Son of God comes to die and in doing so he's going to take possession so he's offering Jesus what Jesus has come for in the first place so what's he gonna do with us is he gonna offer it all in one shot like he did Jesus no cuz for one thing I don't believe Satan knows what it is that our purpose or plan is here on earth right he doesn't have that insight he doesn't have the inspiration he doesn't have the knowledge of God for our lives so he's got to throw out hooks in front of each one of us little baits to see what each one of us will nibble on amen but rest assured that for the men especially you're gonna get nibbles and hooks for for what careers for jobs that pay you more money you're gonna get promotion potential you're gonna be able to move to other places take your families away from church all these different things it's gonna be put in front of you you're gonna get offers of overtime in a time of need aren't you what to keep you out of church you're gonna be tempted to take on more than you can handle and it's gonna cut into your family life what's he gonna do he's gonna try and chip away at things he knows a Christian needs to have fellowship a good church body amen a family life if you're married these different things he's gonna try and chip away at those as best he can coz what he doesn't know what your your your end time goal is he doesn't know what your purpose is Satan didn't know that I was gonna be called to the ministry so I don't believe he was trying to keep me from it but as soon as that call became apparent I believe that he would have recognized that because I would have been doing things to promote it in my own life and then he would have said whoa we really need to start working against this but in the meantime he's gonna start throwing things out and I can say personally I've been off for big promotions I've been offered better lifestyles more money at multiple times in my life and every time that they are thrown out there it's at a time when God is trying to get me into a different channel to try and get me to make a big decision towards him a man I remember when I moved back to Canada I got offered just before I moved back to Canada four weeks before I think or six weeks I got offered a big promotion to move to Houston more money I was gonna run an engine engineering team at a young age I was gonna be able to buy that Porsche I always wanted big house in Houston and these different things guess what Houston has even further away from church than we were at that time we were still making services every every every service but if we went to Houston we'd only make Sundays at best and it was there's a temptation there because we could use them money you know you're still young you're trying to get things paid off and kind of build up a bit of a nest egg and whatnot but right at that same time there was that pull to come back to Canada amen there were things that God needed to work on to me and my life and my marriage and I had to be in a certain place to do it and so obviously I made that decision to come back and then I come here to to British Columbia eventually and I'm making more money than I've ever made in my life and what but with that came a ton of responsibility which I don't mind but with that came stress came persecution came people trying to undercut me I was losing sleep I was losing hair I was more difficult with my family my marriage was suffering my health was suffering and what I was bound by golden handcuffs I was making too much money to walk away from it but yet at the same time it was destroying things that I held dear and so what did I do I had to walk away from it and I had to take less money in a similar position granted but less money and I walked into something that was way less stressful virtually no stress I'm a way better with the family with the kids I think great kids spend more time with them I'm able to focus more on the ministry side of things and then I don't have as much of that time that has to be you know downtime nothing time really where you have to do nothing you have to do things that are very and maybe not carnal but just things that are not they don't redeem the time maybe if I could put it that way amen and that kind of had the get pulled away and so as I stepped into a different job making less money all of a sudden that stress drops away and now I'm more able to focus on my ministry not just ministering behind the pulpit within my family and whatnot amen I'm on a somewhat downward trend in terms of making money it seems every time I make a decision towards God I make less money hopefully he stops before I'm making nothing amen trusting that he'll do that amen but what I do know is I'm happier it making less money and doing what God wants me to do and somehow we still make it through every month with with usually with money in the bank and he certainly provided for us every way and we thank him for him in a minute but we know Satan is going to pick his moment he's picking his moment with Jesus when he's weak and we know Satan's gonna pick his moments with us amen when we're at our weakest moments in that particular area if it's finances or jobs he's going to try and get us to take something that'll that'll infringe on the other things that are a value to us as believers amen he's gonna offer you your goal at some point where you're trying to get but he's gonna offer it in a way that doesn't make you go through the hard work or cling to those things that matter to the believer amen he's gonna get you good and stressed and then he's gonna do what he's gonna offer you a hobby or a pastime but it maybe give you some of that relaxation you seek a many oh wait til you don't have a job and then he's gonna offer you stability in a job that's away from fellowship and away from your family as I talked about or else it'll be so consuming so busy that you have no time for the things that God has put in your life amen he'll wait till you Mother's get sick and tired of having all these babies so close together and you're warned and you're tired and you just had enough and then what he'll give you a job or he'll give you some little role where you can step away from that and not focus on what he's given you and try and go and find value and find self-worth than that him and try and get rid of the tiredness and whatnot amen and I've seen it time and time again where are these sisters they get tired of the home life and then they step into the corporate life and they just go downhill from there and virtually every one of the men's in divorce within five years if not sooner amen he'll wait until you're tired of holding your integrity high and and sticking tight and this could be especially true for for businessmen and business owners you know where you make a mistake and you've got to pay for it literally pay for it and maybe you legally might be able to get away with it and you could get the lawyers involved and you could put it off and that person will just let it slide a mentor you get yourself in trouble at work and I've had this happen where guess what I did something or my team did something and the first inclination is what self-preservation it's the it's to hold yourself above it and say no no that wasn't us and try and put blame or or spread it around a little more so it doesn't fall squarely on you but rather God wants us to do what step right in and I've had these awkward conversations with my boss where I walk in and say hey you know that thing that happened that was our fault or that was my fault here's what happened here's what we've done to fix it but the blame is ours and they don't know what to do with people that do that they don't know what to do when you fully accept responsibility for yourself for your team amen and it does end up raising you up rather than because they're gonna find out eventually anyways you might as well just fess up to it I find amen but what did Jesus get offered here amen he got offered a shortcut and verse 8 says jesus answered and said to him to get thee behind me Satan for it is written that thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve now Jesus again doesn't dispute with Satan that he is the ruler of the kingdoms of the earth he knows he is squatting or not he's still the ruler of the earth at that time amen but same is coming after him and I think he's trying to bait him a little bit to try and argue with him maybe a little bit and and what not it reminds me of you know I won't name names but how the little brother will go to the big brother and say I'm faster than you I'm stronger than you or I can beat you up and guess what he can't and the big brother knows it and if the Brid brother is nice and and responsible and mature then he doesn't do anything but if that little brother keeps picking at him what's he gonna do one day he's gonna race him and he's going to absolutely destroy him or he's gonna wrestle him and pin him so fast or do whatever it takes beat him in hockey 10 to nothing what to show that he's got more power more speed more skill but Jesus doesn't do that Jesus doesn't come over the top on Satan he doesn't berate him he doesn't say yo you just wait Satan you're going to get your and I'm gonna get those and you're gonna be thrown into the pit and all these different things he doesn't rile up against them amen it's so easy for us to get sucked into arguments and and conversations and discussions where it has nothing to do anything good it's not going to bring any good to the hearer Amen or the or the one that's involved in it I'm trying to get us to flare up and try and defend our position in what's ours we don't have to we just stand where we are in the Word of God raises up a standard against whatever's coming against us amen what is it Satan will try and distract you from what the real issue is every single time amen so what will be wise to ignore the big things he throws our way well again coronavirus the pandemic the economy the politics the frustrations it is so easy to get frustrated these days with the leadership that we see amen it is so easy to get frustrated you talk about kicking a can down the road of debt of irresponsibility of ridiculousness it's just balling up in a in an unimaginable way and it's so easy to get caught up in that but what would do we need to get caught up in what making it out of here amen going in a rapture seeing those Saints knock on our door in that morning and saying guess what we're leaving shortly amen that's what we want to be focused on brother Branham talks about why Jesus doesn't take this offer and he says in the message Elisha 19:53 says every kingdom of this world is controlled by Satan the Bible said so Satan is the Prince of the power of the air and every nation is under his domination the scripture says that Satan quoted it to Jesus and he says I'll give them to you if you'll fall down and worship Me and Jesus said get thee hence Satan for it's written that thou shalt worship the Lord and him only shalt thou serve so you see they all belong to Satan Jesus didn't dispute his words about it but Christ knew that he would fall heir to all of these nations someday amen the reason Jesus didn't answer him back and flare up when he talked about this is because Jesus knew if he continued in the path and according to the word he knew he would continue in the path then what he'd fall heir he'd get those things that Satan was offering him anyways amen so the son of the king has to have a kingdom jesus knew I'm the son of a king amen gonna get this kingdom the earth had to be redeemed first though we know that bloody lamb is what came up from behind the throne amen in Revelation it wasn't coming out as the lion he came out as a bloody lamb and Jesus knew this he knew that he had to be the lamb before he could ever be the lion and so what that earth had to be redeemed it can't be possessed without paying the fee amen and we know that's what that sacrifice was all about that like-for-like transaction where a sinless man took on all of humanity's sin and law paid the price amen and the message how can I overcome brother Branham shows exactly the shortcut that he Satan was trying to give to Jesus he said remember he was trying to get him to forfeit it without the cross amen if he did it we'd be lost he could have took the kingdom he was tempted to do it now brother Branham says death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died a man he did that he resisted this temptation why because of you and I same would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get thee behind me Satan he didn't do it he come and suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death amen Satan's promise here was what give Jesus the reward without the pain without the suffering without the hard work amen he's offering Jesus a shortcut saying look just bypass the cross I'll give it all to you now and you can have it you don't have to worry about it amen so what's satan gonna offer us I mean if he's gonna offer Jesus a shortcut he's gonna offer us a shortcut isn't he as well he's gonna tell us what brother branham says in the message you must be born again he says they want a shortcut to heaven speaking of everyone really they want a shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can take that's what brother Graham says the shortcut is for the believer that Saint is going to offer a shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can take this is the message you must be born again you can't take any of it there's no shortcuts you come the way of Calvary you come the way of the brass serpent and or the brass altar you come the way of the brazen serpent you die you literally die to yourself dieeee to the things of the world and are born to new amen no world the things of the world is dead there's no shortcuts eat they want to come now listen to this he says they want to come what to heaven they want to come right quick they don't want to grow we grow in the Lord it takes growth and experience amen the only way you can have experience is by experience you have to go through it you don't get it by sitting and listening and learning you have to go through it to get experiencing men 1965 events made clear by prophecy he says see the world and the people are watching for some little outlet some little bypass some little shortcut but there is no shortcuts in the Word of God there's one pattern you must cut yourself and fit that pattern not try to cut the pattern to fit you everybody must do that there's only one way God has to do it as of doing it amen so what's our temptation what's our shortcut to cut the word to fit us rather than to cut ourselves to fit the word amen brother Branham said that it was what the shortcut was to take as much of the world as we can and still be a Christian a menace to refuse to grow it's just to sit there and say I believe in Christ I've accepted his sacrifice and you're sitting there is a justified lump doing nothing except claiming the blood of Christ and there's no growth there's no sanctification there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost and there's no adoption that moves you into a place where God trusts you and uses you amen as a member of the Bride of Christ what is it they won't yield to the Holy Spirit's cleansing power amen in the third seal brother Bram says Christ wants his white pure with the word the way she must be because nothing not one taught or one judo I think he means one jot or one tittle but he literally said totter doodle will pass from that law from that book till it's all fulfilled Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass he says don't put any private interpretation to it he wants the pure unadulterated now listen as he says the pure unadulterated not even a flirt now this is where this really struck home to me because it resonates with me he says I wouldn't want my wife flirting with some other man now you brothers think if you came across your wife with a fancy little smile and all dressed up and getting kind of close to a guy and having some sort of an intimate conversation or little smiles and back-and-forth witty banter I guarantee you you would flare up amen if I saw Blanca doing that and she's sitting here laughing yeah we would have a problem amen you would probably see me lose the victory but I would get the victory over the man that was doing it I guarantee you amen he'd be dead and then I deal with her amen but listen what he says I wouldn't want my wife flirting with some other man and when you go to listening to any kind of reasons beyond that the pure unadulterated word you're listening you're flirting with Satan amen don't it make you feel religious God wants you to stay unadulterated stay right there with that word stay with it all right but listen what he talked about there he says he talked about what growing impatience a mint growing in patience right what settled in wresting waiting on God to do it now I know I've mentioned this before but it's always there it's maybe something I don't know I struggle with it and you look in the scripture and we know this is an endtime we know we're getting close and you start to look at certain things in your life and attitudes and whatnot and you think that really odd not to be there right we're looking for that growth we're looking for things to be cut away from us and it seems like things still linger at times when we say Lord what is this all about but we have to wait there because in his time and in his season brother Branham says its growth and experience and he'll give you a time he'll either get you to a place where you're desperate to get rid of it or he'll take it away from you supernatural and he can choose which way he's gonna go usually he'll take you through it with the trial a man that's just been my experience but what we're tempted to fight that daily grind in that patience and that rest and the finished work that we know he's going to bring us to a full overcoming state amen and what do we do we get frustrated we get confused we start cutting off fellowship we start thinking less of ourselves we start pulling back from the word wide because sometimes we're thinking well what's wrong with me right but a miserable Christian isn't going to do anything good and so we've got to be able to say Lord my life is in your hands and you're gonna do what you need to do in the time that you choose to do it in amen and then we can't do it ourselves that's for sure the flesh can achieve this on its own my discipline is not going to take me into a rapture the only discipline I can have is to read my Bible and pray that's about the only discipline I can think about that's where I make a conscious choice but to produce the fruit of the Spirit requires the spirit itself amen moving on verse 9 this word Satan starts to twist scriptures and this is where it gets fun amen then he brought him to Jerusalem and sent him on a pinnacle of the temple and said to him if there'll be the Son of God cast thyself down from hence for it is written though men here you go Satan quoting scripture and I guarantee you we all know what Satan that loves to quote scripture to us he says for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone amen we could probably spend weeks weeks preaching on this sort of a situation in this scripture amen but we see that this is probably the trickiest things for Christians to deal with today is when were taken back to the scripture and we're tempted or were pressed by somebody that's using Scripture against us trying to pin us into a corner amen but we know that to uh properly apply apply the Word of God takes what a revelation to rightly discern the Word of God and that can only come through the Holy Spirit amen what Satan's game here with Jesus he's trying to do what twist the Word of God trying to get him to claim a promise but he's doing it without doing the full word amen Jesus answers him in verse 12 and says and Jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God now Jesus said st. in was asking Jesus to tempt God why well if we look at the original scripture it's in Psalms 91 which brother Gerald just preached not too long ago amen Psalms 91 verse 9 is the reference that Satan was using and it said because thou has made the Lord which is which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation what a wonderful scripture you think who's going to twist this there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh unto thy dwelling praise the Lord what a promise for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone but the angel that says the angels are not there to keep you from dashing your foot against the stone period it says they're there to keep you in all your ways meaning that if you're walking in your way which is what the path of God for your life the angels are there to guard you against accidental or intentional harm that somebody else would inflict on you amen but it's not there the angels are not charged to keep you from hurting yourself intentionally amen that would be iniquity Satan's telling Jesus intentionally try and hurt yourself intentionally trying to inflict harm intentionally throw yourself off of this temple pinnacle and then they're gonna hold you up and Jesus says no no you're tempting God when you put yourself intentionally in a position to make God come down and do something amen you'll see situations in the in the scripture where they might have wanted a man of God or a woman of God to do a certain thing again thinking back to Jesus if the Pharisees would have known what he was doing when he went to the Pool of Bethesda they just said if you're the Son of God healed them all and that's what Satan would have tempted him with you well you've got the power and authority you heal everyone why you just doing one what about the person next to him but you have to be able to what rightly apply the word you have to have discernment by the Holy Spirit to know when to apply that word and how it's meant to be applied in the first place amen otherwise you're abusing the word of God you're putting God to a test that he never meant to be tested amen and that's probably one of the the trickiest things that Satan has convinced the world of is a scripture that you know that for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have or lasting life and so they say I believe in Jesus I believe in Christ I've accepted his sacrifice but they don't get baptized they don't go on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not only that their life doesn't change and if it does it changes only marginally but they more or less stay right where they are they stay in sin many times they even know about it to a degree but they stay in there and then they what they twist the scriptures that says there's a forgiveness of sins under the blood of Christ and they'll go in and out and in and out of sin they'll commit what's called iniquity what doing that what you know is wrong they'll do it time and time again and then say it but lord I claim your I claim your promise I claim your promise there's no desire in them to serve Christ but they're using that blood as what some sort of a shield to try and make themselves feel better and then that's twisting the Scriptures Matthew 7:22 says many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity what is it people don't do what God tells them to do they pick and choose what they want even to the point where they will do signs and wonders we know that brother Branham taught it and the anointing that can come down and he said God honors faith period God honors faith and so it's not those men doing it in the first place it's always been God responding to people's faith brother Branham said this in Israel and the church 1953 he said when Jesus was here on earth he was God he was Emmanuel God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he never used any of his great gifts when he met Satan he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone it's written thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and he defeated him that's it no the scripture Satan knows it too but you got to know how to rightly divide the word of God see my wife shared something with me the other day and it really struck me and it said it was just a you know one of those little phrases you see inspirational phrases or whatnot it said discernment doesn't mean to be able to know the difference between right and wrong rather discernment is the ability dessert to discern between right and nearly right amen isn't that true we've been taught to well to be fooled by the obvious right people will come in and they could come in with certain big doctrines or ideas or whatever saying that becomes in the presents you with these opportunities we know that what's right and wrong but what is it that he tries to come in with and the scripture talks about you know you know it'll it'll fool even the elect if it were possible at the end it'll be so close there'll be a Razors Edge between what right and nearly right amen so what is it going to be what we have to have discernment not only to see what Singh's doing but right we apply the word to handle the situation amen now this was the end of Jesus test for now verse 13 says when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him now notice it says he departed from him for a season and then Jesus didn't get a free pass from Satan's temptations just as he defeated him at one time but rather he gets a pass for a time but what happens after that Satan doesn't go after Jesus next what does he go after he goes after his disciples right Jesus had a ton of disciples and then he goes and he takes away the seventy right and he's left with twelve and even one of them as a devil the scripture says what is it we see Peter being influenced by Satan there at different times and then the end Satan still takes his best shot at Jesus so which is what he's betrayed he's rejected right and then he takes him to the whipping post and then he takes him on the cross and he puts the sting of death in her mental Satan still gets his shot at you and if he can't get out you then he's gonna go after those that are close to you amen if you're a man and you're married if he can't get to you what's he gonna do he's gonna go after your wife he's gonna go after your children and it's especially more dramatic when your children are growing up amen when they're out of the house or when they're old enough they're at the age of accountability and he can go after them and you can't do anything about it what he'll do he'll try and take your peace by going after them amen he'll try and interrupt things by going after your wife if he came to interrupt your peace amen if he can't get to the pastor what does he go after the congregation every single time if you don't believe it read what brother Branham said in that what we call a word to the church right What did he say if he can't get you what's he gonna do he's gonna inject somebody with the poison of what bitterness or envy what inside the church right you can't get the pastor he's gonna scatter the Sheep some other way and he'll get them fighting amongst themselves amen he'll try every avenue that he can get every person every situation everything that you hold dear he's gonna attack it if he can't get to you directly amen it says in and this is in Matthew 4 I'm jumping to a different scripture here and you don't need to worry about it says then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered to him so God has a heavenly host to come down and now meet Jesus needs and that's a that's a real rest for us is when when the battles over amen we've got a rest that comes after we've got angels that minister to us and it's not always the angels in the heavenly sense you know that they come from heaven sometimes they do I believe that but he'll send angels ministering to us whether it's another believer he'll send another minister to come in and preach you know he'll send the right fellowship he'll send you know the right message your way in these different things Matthew 4:14 says and listen to the effect this all had on Jesus so Jesus remember he comes out of the water the the Holy Spirit's come on him identified him as his beloved son and he goes driven directly into the wilderness and after the wilderness temptation matthew 4:14 says and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit onto Galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about now remember he was supposed to be humbled he was supposed to be obedient and when he's done all that now he goes out in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there was a fame that comes to him what he gets a reputation now and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all a man it's a beautiful type for us when this is all over when the final trial we've gone through what we're strengthened and we walk out in fullness of power in the spirit and each and every one of our lives they men so let's do a quick summary here we're about two-thirds of the way through by God's grace old-type so we look at how Satan attacks Jesus and we want to just summarize again what he's doing to us in the same way so the first thing he did he had three attacks but the first one is or the overall attack as he's saying if you're the son of God prove it and so when he comes to he's gonna do the same thing he's gonna attack our patient position and say if you're a son of God if you're a daughter of God then do this and do that he's gonna what make an inflammatory statement he's gonna what take you from resting on the word and see if he can get you to respond to a situation rather than standing firm on what God has given you amen I'll try and get you so caught up on proving something rather than resting on something and that's what we don't want to do is get caught up into proving ourselves we're not here to prove ourselves God proves us it's God that gives us strength so why would we try and do that in the first place all we know is when Satan comes on our ground then we respond but otherwise we leave him alone let him rage and let him do whatever he wants to amen second thing he tries to do is get you to answer according to his words rather than God's word amen he tries to get you to give him the answer he's looking for rather than you saying no no let's answer what the whole word lets rightly discern what the whole word says it is says about this and then take it from Genesis to Revelation not just cherry-pick scriptures not just cherry-pick arguments but let's take the whole picture of the big picture and let's respond by that rather than going down into this little spot you've taken out of context amen Satan wants you to pick up his weapon he wants you to work with his argument rather than work with what God has said in his word amen and like I said last night it's Satan would have picked up Saul's weapon he'd have lost and of say and if he would have went with Goliath weapons he would have lost but he stuck with what God had proven with him and through that what he vanquished he vanquished the Philistines he vanquished Goliath and he won himself the kingdom eventually again not through his strength but because he stuck with what God had given him then the other thing he tries to do is what take a shortcut shortcut the pain shortcut the suffering in men it says we have to what suffer with him to reign with him and he tries to take us past that and sometimes it's not so much that he'll try and take us past it but rather he tries to get us cut it short right we don't want to go through the whole thing we get into the midst of the struggle and we say ah enough of this can we just be through it but guess what every moment under the pressure of God's trial is squeezing out more of the world and bringing more of the purity of the word into your life they meant Satan's lie is that you need to have the experience to get the reward at the end Amen that you can jump to it and can you imagine you that the the ones that work or anything I mean think of a mother are you gonna be a great mother if you don't go through the experience of childbirth if you don't go through the experience of the sleepless nights and these different things as you are raising those children as you're working with them that experience makes you a better mother so when the next one comes along then you handle it generally better generally better right sisters a minute what you learn and you grow and the further you go the more confidence you get and you're able to handle things better and now when you thought you could only ever handle one you get the second one and it goes better than you thought in the third and then if God would allow you the fourth and the fifth and and you know these different things you know how it all happens and whatnot but you'll pay a price if you try and shortcut and that's what Satan saying is look I'll give you the the final reward but you don't have to go through the experience and then but Christ says no to reign with me you have to suffer with me amen there's no shortcut in this and we're ever brother Branham said takes what growth and experience and then the last thing he tries to do is what twist scripture confuse you by twisting scripture by miss applying it by not rightly deserting the way it's supposed to be meant that's supposed to be applied amen he selectively uses the scripture rather than taking it from Genesis to Revelation and I can tell you I was talking to brother Stevens true about this a while ago last year sometime and and he was talking about how you know sometimes we think we've got this great revelation and something just sparks in us and we really oh I got to get that down it's so good but as students of the scripture and as responsible ministers what do we have to do take it from Genesis to Revelation I think that's one of the greatest things that brother Branham taught us was you have to line it up from the beginning to the end and if it doesn't go through it's not right you may have a truth there a portion of truth they says the full thing has to fit through that filter of Genesis to Revelation brother Stephens true said there's nothing more disappointing than when you think you got caught the inspiration of God and you get halfway through the Bible and you realize oh oh it doesn't pull all the way through now usually there's something good in there but it's not always and that's why we have to be careful amen say can try and confuse a Satan's not above dropping thoughts in by trying to put in you know revelations that aren't quite right so as ministers not only as ministers amen but as believers we need to be sure that anything we take we pull it through from start to finish and I guarantee you we've all run into people that can tie you you and knots with scriptures and quotes quotes especially maybe not so much scriptures because when you start applying scriptures I find the quotes don't tend to stand up but people know this message inside and out and they can give you the book they can give you the page and they can give you the paragraph of where the Prophet said something and they'll say now what are you gonna do with it and you know what if you haven't studied as much you're not going to get it and even if you have studies as much you may not get it because we aren't given to know everything amen we don't have all knowledge of the message in scriptures we have what we need praise the Lord but we don't have it all and so you still have to be able to rest and you still have to be able to walk away from those things and say I'm not here to argue with it about it but I'm trusting if I need what you have God will reveal it to me amen amen in every one of those situations our response has to be the overcomers answer is what it is written and it is written from Genesis to Revelation not just in one place Amen so I want to talk a bit about what it means to give an answer amen as a believer in this time and I want to start with our Commission because each one of us was given the Great Commission I believe and not the Great Commission in that were called a minister behind a pulpit obviously but rather we are called to preach the gospel which is what the good news and what is the good news amen it starts with what John 3:16 write for God so loved the world we know that Scripture and then from there it moves on to what acts 2:38 how do we receive eternal life amen repent be baptized for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit amen that is the good news that is our Commission and we're called to preach it and I believe brother Branham talks about this maybe not but preaching is not just speaking so often we we call somebody a preacher because they speak behind a pulpit but a preacher has to both live and speak what he is saying amen and each one of us therefore as a preacher because what we speak is the word our conversation our testimony is the word but we called not only to say it but we are called to live at Amen so each one of us is given the Great Commission to what express what that God has done i press we've accepted it we have the Holy Spirit living inside of us and that is offered to all amen amen and that sounds simple doesn't it and guess what it is simple literally the Christian walk is acts 2:38 and I was talking with brother Mark about this a little earlier this week about how I I'm hearing just more and more and I know this isn't new it's been around a long time but I'm hearing ministers that are turning our Christian walk into something so complicated where you have to know this mystery and this seal and this scripture and this and that and the other thing and guess what brother Branham never said that brother Brown never went into these different things he pointed us back to what a simplicity in Christ that comes with the Holy Spirit sealing you into the day of your full Redemption and leading and guiding you in your life and in that and in that alone has found the pureness of the walk of the end the end time Christian amen brother branham what he preached that message God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same and then we've got it to the point where if you can recite every revelation under the seventh seal and tied it all back to it somehow you're not a message believer and that's nowhere near the truth they meant some of us are gonna know more and understand more intellectually by revelation however you want to describe it but that is not what the requirement is for the endtime believer the end time believers called to overcome and all I know is that God will give each and every one of us what we need to go through to the end time and and walk out in a rapture amen Paul addresses this he's in sync 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 3 he says but I fear lest by any means any means now as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ amen he says what corrupted what is it it starts it takes the purity of God in your mind the revelation you have and starts to change it into something that is hybrid amen it starts to add in something that wasn't there in the first place it starts to confuse you it starts to drag you down and all of a sudden your wonder I say because I don't understand this or have that Amen he says the simplicity that is in Christ amen so when it comes to the attacks of Satan brings we don't have to have some big logical argument Amen we don't have to be wise in the ways of the world and you know I've seen these different ones you know Ravi Zacharias these ones and their apologetics for the Christian faith and they have all these great intellectual answers for every situation that's not what we're called to do we're not called to answer every question but rather we're called to live an overcoming light and Express Christ in every aspect of our life and that is the testimony that we give to them it's not an answer to every question they can come up with but rather that we can show them a living Christ today amen so Satan we know doesn't come against us in person the way he did with Jesus the person of Satan does not stand next to us and invisibly tempt us as we would say it right he what he sends demons onto people that would try and influence us that would attack us in different ways and I've met many at work and around that what they'll come against you in ways and you don't understand what this person's problem is with you but yet they keep coming at you and coming at you and when they can't get you then they start to I try and undercut your reputation they're trying to do this trying to do that and you have no clue why they're doing it and all I can tell you is that as Satan on that person trying to get at you amen and that's what he comes against us with but not only that not just people in their lives but what through the politics of the day through the issues of the day you think this Kovan 19 pandemic is not Satan that Satan is not using that to try and influence us to what put a spirit of fear on us to put a spirit of frustration it's tough we don't get to go to church we don't get to have fellowships I don't know about you guys but I'm about ready to say you know what let's risk it let's just do it anyways they meant and we'll suffer the consequences but that's easy for me to say being young and in relative good health I don't so but what he tries to get us looking at those situations tries to get us frustrated tries to get us reactive rather than resting amen if you look at everything especially in Europe and it's really coming in strong in North America now what are they doing the support for Christianity I mean in Europe there is no support for Christian it doesn't exist its non-existent hasn't been there forever I mean Satan had his Eden had his headquarters in Paris and then he moved over to Los Angeles the Hollywood brother branham said and what what have they been doing they've been turning the opinions against Christians for probably very strongly I would say the last 10 to 20 years Amen is this this alternate lifestyle the homosexuality movement and these different things and what are they doing here's where they triple eavers is they'll get or Christians off well put it that way as they get them on their talk shows they get them in their interviews and then they ask them their questions and get them to try and answer according to their questions and this is the exact same thing that what Satan did to Christ as he tried to get him to answer according to his way instead of according to the word amen so what do they do they say to the Christians they say are you for or against this are you for or against that do you agree with this or do you not agree with it and what are the Christians say every time well we're against it of course we don't agree with that but what is it they don't answer with it is written across the whole thing what they do is they answer according to Satan's questions and his phrasing rather than bringing it back into the fullness of the word amen so I want to give you an example of this so if you guys will turn to first Corinthians chapter 6 I want to give it what to my mind will be a it is written answer a full answer to the kind of situations we're facing today amen so first Corinthians 6 amen Satan that's what I'm seen as Satan has fooled professing Christians into answering with the law and only the law and even if they may be using the New Testament Scriptures they're still using Old Testament law so so what we're talking about you know whatever it may be alternate lifestyles these these perverted movements that are out there now and whatnot and people you know they'll have these people and they say well do you agree with their don't agree with it well I don't agree with it of course and they'll say well what don't those people deserve to be happy don't they deserve to have love don't they deserve to be the way they are didn't God make them that way right that's dumped so many people doesn't it but look what Paul says here in 1st Corinthians because we know all these things are wrong amen but I want see that we all are wrong in the first place and it's not just those but if we when we read this you'll see we have something that will probably touch every one of our lives either before you know before we got saved by God's grace first Corinthians 6 verse 9 says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God so right there the unrighteous the unrighteous is everyone that's out from under the blood of Christ right because when we took the blood of Christ with it we took what his righteousness right he says our righteousness is as filthy rags but we take on his righteousness so he says the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God so right there everybody that has not stepped under the blood of Jesus Christ cannot inherit the kingdom of God so that excludes every single one of us prior to us accepting the grace of God amen it says be not deceived neither fornicators so that's people that are living in common-law relationships hide auditors anybody that's put something ahead of God in their life that includes all of us at some point amen that's everybody everybody's had an idol in their life adulterers nor adulterers so people that have cheated on their spouse or their living they've remarried improperly nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind I mean buffalos refer to homosexuality nor thieves I think every single one of us has stolen something whether it is time if not something physically in our lives right or conscience under being covetous oh I wish I had what he has or she has or I looked like her I felt like that or had his job or his career his fame or his money right nor drunkards millions probably billions falling to that nor revilers anyone that's turned down the Word of God falls into the revealer category nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God so we go from everybody that son not under the blood doesn't have it and then he goes into some specifics and so that's what Christians will say well look 1st Corinthians says that the homosexuals they're not going into the into the kingdom of heaven so yeah it's wrong I don't I'm against it but they don't go all the way through right they see they preach it as a condemnation they preach it as a judgment but Christ doesn't come in that way amen he doesn't just set the law without a remedy amen the the Genesis to Revelation answering includes the whole thing law plus grace amen and that's why they don't perceive love in a Christians response it's because they're only giving the judgement but they're not giving them the remedy amen but why did we say we're against these things cuz it says right there it says you can't inherit the kingdom of God and it says God hates it in other in other places amen so we say we hate it because God hates it but the reason we also hate it is because if you do those things you can't go into heaven it meant so we hate it because it causes a separation from God and that's what we want to do is we want to say we want to draw you to Christ and so we don't agree with those things because they cause a separation from Christ and we need to get those under the out of the way we need to get you under the blood of Christ and get your life changed in order that you can come into the kingdom amen what we're trying to do what the full gospel present the full commission they men because in verse 11 Paul says in such word such were you used to be this some of you but you are present so you used to be that but now you are washed present and continuous you are sanctified present and continuous you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God so he says look you used to be this you're telling me that they have homosexuals in the church you have been washed and sanctified and justified and with the Spirit of God now what you live a different life that is the as the it should be giving to people amen that is where we say look we have a solution we have a remedy but the problem is you can't give that answer if you don't have that remedy yourself and I believe that's why they don't give it so often is that they don't have an experience that says you can overcome I mean that's the downfall of the church is that they've you know accepted the doctrines of men and they've taken the power of God right out of the church and then they let the men lead and the Holy Spirit's not there and they have nothing that they can offer so all they can offer is the law but they can't bring that bring in what the power of the blood and the rejuvenating and living life of the Holy Spirit amen they don't talk about the Holy Spirit almost on those on those interview as in talk shows why because they don't have it they haven't know overcoming power themselves so all they can do is say yep we just don't agree with it amen look at what Peter did in the day of Pentecost amen here's our if you want to see the Commission the Great Commission Peter is the first example of what getting the Holy Spirit and then he comes out and he preaches a sermon to the people and what does he do he says you killed the Lord and and Christ he says he puts the blame on them he says look you crucified the very one that came to save you the one that was promised you crucified Him and what effect does it have it pricks their conscience amen he brought judgment to them he says look you did something you shouldn't have done and it caused the people's consciences to flare up but what Peter he comes right after that because they say well what can we do to take care of this and then what can we do to be saved we know we've messed up and Peter comes right over the top and he says what acts 2:38 repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and he opens up the keys of the kingdom remember jesus said to Peter he says I've given you the keys whatever you open on earth that will open in heaven and whatever you shot then I'll shut in these different things Peter he turns to the key there he says acts 2:38 repent be baptized and you'll receive their gift of the Holy Ghost and that's all the believers needed ever since repent be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but you'll never hear people say that why the other don't believe it or they do they're too embarrassed to believe it to say it and they have no experience that would follow through with it amen but when you can answer see what they're trying to do is they're trying to get you pinned into a corner and just know we don't want to talk about alternate lifestyles but we want to talk about everything that comes our way is they want to pin you in the corner they want to put you in a box so they can somehow walk away and say yes I understand where they're coming from but when you talk about an experience in the life of the Holy Spirit within you that's gonna cut through the confusion now they may not believe it they may not believe it but I'll tell you this when I first moved to Alberta I was I worked at a place for three or four months and I was able to you know I shared what I believed and you know they knew I went to church and these different things they knew I took God seriously and and whatnot and I was leaving them just before I left my boss we we had three of us sharing an office and he sat down he said look he says I don't know why you are the way you are he says but I'd like to know what it is you believe he said so I'm gonna give you time I want you to tell me why you believe in why you live the way you do and for thirty minutes I got to tell him what it was to be an end time Christian amen that was a man that got the full answer from start to finish amen he got an in his written answer as to why I believe what I believe and what God has done and I was able to tell him testimony after testimony of the things that struggled with him the deliverance God has given me and the healings that I've had and my wife has had in children and these different things and he sat there and at the end he said look I can disagree with what you are like in terms of the logic of what you say says but the only thing I can't disagree with is what he says the experience he says when you tell me about these healings in what Nadi says I can't dispute that and he walked away and that was that and it flow mixed him a little bit because he's so used to having people argue but when you start talking about the effect of what you believe now all of a sudden that changes things amen and that's what we want to share him and we're an endtime bride that's expressing Christ so our answer is not just in words but our answer is in a life lived before each of these amen amen we want to cut through that confusion the cloudiness we want to get to the heart of the issue because when people are asking those questions they don't want to understand they don't want to get to what it is you really believe they just want to pin you down amen second Timothy two verse 14 says of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit so we're talking now about what the overcomers answered their conversation amen that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers now what it says is don't get caught up in arguments that have nothing constructive there's no good that they're looking to get out of it they just want to have an argument and it says what the effect of that is the subverting of the hearers and what that means is the conquering and the overcoming of a consecrated spirit so when you get into those kinds of arguments what does it do it starts to break down your consecration to God why because you get caught up in the logic and you get caught up in the argument and all of a sudden confusion and doubt set in faith starts to go away and all of a sudden you're not sure where you're standing and then what happens your life slowly starts to roll away from the Word of God amen so what out that to tell us what our conversation should be amen now when we talk about conversations we have to expand it a bit these days because we don't just have conversations in person anymore on the phone doing we have social media now so you're gonna have a conversation on Facebook on Twitter on Instagram everything that you put on there is a conversation potentially so everything we put on there the question is is it there for no profit or is it there to inspire confidence in the Word of God is it there to grow people or is it there to cause confusion to cause dissension to cause argument you know and these sorts of things can be tough on zealous people because even when we're putting things out there whether it's in conversation or on social media what we like to put things out there that are a little bit edgy that kind of get in people's faces a bit but that's not always the wisdom of God I don't believe and then we want to do what we want to draw people and if we offend them if we get their guard up in front by saying things so bluntly sometimes what does it do it makes us of no or little effect amen continuing on there in second Timothy verse 20 sorry verse 15 it says study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase into more ungodliness now profane means common or on how old or ungodly and vain babblings are empty discussions discussions of useless matters amen what a conversation stopper that scripture ought to be amen if we said is what I'm talking about is what I'm doing here gonna lead to godliness or is it just gonna lead to vain babblings jumping to verse 23 again same chapter it says but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender stripes now not just asking them but answering them as well and if there's one thing that there's a lot of it's foolish and unlearned questions today because you get people that'll get online they'll go look up something on Google they'll listen to something Joel Olsteen says and then they'll come at you guns blazing thinking that they've got a bone to pick with you and they have never opened up a Bible they've never read it from Genesis to Revelation they never stepped foot inside a church much less a message Church they have nothing but yet somehow they feel qualified to challenge you on what you believe amen scripture says don't have anything to do with it and not only that but those that know what you believe talking about those that have left the message and they try and trick you and they get into conversations ours is not to answer them pulse it after the first or second admonition walk away that's our instruction is not to sit there and get into arguments about what we believe say if you want to if you really want to end it say the Lord rebuke you and they'll be so unhappy but never come at you again I think but listen to this verse 24 still in 2nd Timothy it says the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient the servant of the Lord must not strive strive means to fight engage in a war of words to quarrel to wrangle dispute what is wrangle me they wrangle horses right horses that don't want to be caught they have to wrangle them they have to put a rope around them sometimes they have to trip them up and knock them down so that they can get a saddle on them and start to ride them amen so you're not supposed to wrangle but you're supposed to be gentle to all men apt to teach and patient amen are you gonna be seen as gentle and apt to teach when we're putting inflammatory posts on Facebook when we're writing emails and passing on information from this one or that one no you're not going to get there amen we need to be gentle we need to be what patient that's what Paul says gentle apt to teach and patient that's the way our conversation that's the way our answers are supposed to be in every one of these situations Amen what does Paul policy continues what should we be striving for he says in verse 25 in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves in meekness that's how we approach this as if we've got Audrey thinking all the answers and we have it all and this that and the other thing he says in meekness what being humble gentle instructing those that oppose themselves what does that mean it's those that are doing themselves harm and they don't even realize it they don't even know that their lifestyle that their decisions are going to hurt them down the road he says what instruct the people that are causing themselves harm without realizing it what for what purpose he says if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth he says if you go in with meekness maybe just maybe God will give them a repentance to the acknowledging of the truth he'll let them see the error of their ways and stop making that mistake stop living that life come around to the truth of the gospel amen so what's our goal then our conversation our answer when we see people that are walking in a way that is going to cause them harm that's gonna lead to pain and suffering down the road even though it may cause temporary pleasure and gain what do we do gentle apt to teach patient and meek that should be our approach amen why so that way God can potentially use us to draw them to the gospel amen so many believers have no clue how damaging they can be when they just get all up in somebody's face about those things well you know better you ought to know better don't you know the scripture says this no gentle app to teach and patient amen listen to this in 1st Peter 3 verse 15 we're very close here to the end a man says but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear Amen people wonder why we are the way we are they look at us and they see you know our sisters in the way they dress and it's strange to the world if they're dressing right amen they see that the beliefs that we hold and they look so old-fashioned but they also see the integrity the honesty the dependability the hard-working nature hopefully of the true believer and they wonder what is it what is it that drives these people to do it and even though they don't understand they wonder and say what is it that pushes that person to live that way amen and Brett and the scripture says you have to have an answer be able to give an answer to every man that asks you what is it that's inside of you and you can tell them of the hope that we have Amen through Christ in the baptism of the Holy Spirit in our lives look at Jesus like I said he never yelled at Satan when he was answering him in this temptation he didn't rail against him he didn't say like I said you're going down to the pit of hell and your times coming he didn't have to do that and guess what we know where we stand and we know where people stand if they don't come to this message if they don't come to to a relationship with Christ so we don't have to beat them down amen this is the only pleasure potentially they're going to get in life as if they enjoy life here because afterwards it's not going to be a whole lot of fun so what do we need to do rest where we are and invite them into that place amen how do we do it rightly divide the word of God rightly apply it with the right attitude and the right spirit that gives an invitation amen first Peter 3 continues in verse 16 this is speaking of the believer after you give a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear it says having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ amen what so that people when they look at you they say yeah no you know what they do live the life amen they do walk the walk they don't just talk the talk but they walk the walk he says let your conscience be clear when you give that hope that what you have a life behind it that when they try and talk evil no it doesn't hold off they meant brother Bram says this and the conflict between God and Satan he says but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God he said now seeing there was going to be a conflict in a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of an attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the rapture amen hallelujah all the way from Eden to the rapture what was it the word that's what defeat Satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place listen as he says now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing there is the word amen Smith Wigglesworth I hope it's okay to quote somebody else brother Andre from Quebec shared this with me and I thought I'd share it with you mrs. Smith Wigglesworth says how can you enter into a life of faith all lack of faith is due to not feeding on God's Word you need it every day what a brother Graham say you want to get close to God read your Bible and pray feed on the living Christ of whom this word is full of if I am to know God I will know him by his word I know I shall be in heaven but I could not build on my feelings that I'm going to heaven I'm going to heaven because God word says it and I believe God's Word and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God how shall we reach this plane of faith let go your own thoughts and take the thoughts of God the Word of God if you build yourself on imaginations you will be wrong listen to this you have the Word of God and it is Enoch they meant everything our conversations our confession our discussion our opinions needs to be pulled through the Word of God Ephesians 6 verse 14 says stand therefore having your loins Girt with truth now what the loins is where what comes from life comes from if you're a man the loins is where life comes from amen and the scripture says the life that we give out needs to be guarded by truth our source of life has to be guarded by truth in other words our life shouldn't be coming forth without it being accompanied by truth they're there they're tired together amen so I just said that our confession our discussion our opinions it all has to be pulled through the filter but it's not just that but it's the things we share it's the things we post it's the things we endorse all of those things need to be pulled through the filter of the word amen so we know that the word is a seat I mentioned that brother Branham spoke of it earlier in in in one of the quotes I read and we know that our words are also seeds amen the life that we gave out is in what the word that we give amen and our word the word is given by words we speak it and we live it so our conversation needs to be guarded by truth and pull through that filter single time so that means then that when we're giving an answer when we're putting our words out when we're putting out our testimony when we're putting out our beliefs when we're putting out our opinions let me take it that far then it has to be what filtered through an accompanied and aligned with truth that's what Paul's getting at when he's talking in Ephesians there amen that's what makes us trustworthy and that's what makes us consistent is when we pull everything through the filter of the word why because if it's true then it has to fit through the word amen so when we see situations rise with those trials and troubles like this corona virus pandemic whether it's Church issues and politics tend to creep in whether it's family issues and old history and and you know the personal flaws that our family knows we have so much when it's all of those our conversations need to be guarded by what truth we need to pull it through the word so it's not gonna be it is thought or it is my opinion or the best minds in the world think but rather it should be pulled through it is written amen and not just it is written one scripture to try and pin someone down but it is written from Genesis to Revelation amen the word should tempore the way we speak to each other and the conversations we have and the things that we endorse in the opinions that we put out there a ment really we shouldn't have an opinion we should have the Word of God and that is what we believe and that's what we express amen we don't want to be taking sides we don't want to be spreading rumors amen we don't want to get caught up in the experts here and they say this and that you know what we all have people that we listen to that I would say aren't necessarily under the headship of Christ we have experts whether it's you know a Dave Ramsey or something like that and whatnot we need to pull all of those things to the Word of God it's not that it's bad but we need to make sure that we don't just quote them because they're good at this and we just leave our the Word of God on the side and not pull it through it amen amen so what do we do every answer every answer that Jesus gave was what it is written so brother Matt when we lose our jobs what do we say it is written psalms 37:25 i have been young and now I'm old but I yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread amen when we face sickness our answer is what it is written isaiah 53:5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed amen not just yesterday not just today but tomorrow it is a continuous healing that we have amen when we face sadness or despair we say what it is written Isaiah 60:1 3 to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified amen when we face difficult decisions and we aren't sure which way to go what do we say it is written Psalms 37 23 and 24 amen the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand amen amen that's all I've got is it he warmed up but I'm trusting you were encouraged this evening amen we want to we've been given a weapon that can't be defeated and all we have to do is use it and use it the way that we've been told to use it amen we want to rightly discern the word we want to be inspired by the Holy Spirit and we want to be able to rest on what God has opened up and what God has shown us amen we want to have rest that all that he said he's going to do he will do Amen if I want to say one more thing it is written revelations 3:21 and this is our scripture amen this is what I'm claiming to him that overcometh will I grant to stick my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne Eman god bless you richly thank you again yeah so much for having me Richard miss you I was we are listening to the song service at the end and I just know Blanc I said I just miss being there you know even if it's just four or five and just blessed in the presence of the Lord and you know it's it'll be a real pleasure we get to fellowship again amen just trusting that the the Lord will bring us through this and close us down so we can be in fellowship Lord with you know with the Lord and in one room in one place and you know I can hear brother Chad bellowing amen and and see sister Priscilla just throwing her arms out and here in Dave yell and shout and see sister marine just throw her head back and sing and brother Gerald just given it is off from behind the pulpit Amen I look forward to that just trusting that again it'll be a short quick work of this pandemic and and we'll be able to move on in life they men let's just pray there's the general for tomorrow whoever can but Bob can come up as needed Amen Lord Jesus we are so thankful Lord once again for your presence for your word Lord I'm thankful Lord there was just a whole lot easier today Lord just trusting your grace and feeling your presence in it lord I pray that you would just take these things that said Lord that Lord where our hearts were pricked that we'd make it right or that we would set an anchor Lord that we would take Lord that it is written and just apply it to every section of our life Lord everything that comes against us Lord may your word rise up a standard Lord that would hold us steady through the storm Lord I pray you bless the people Lord we know how difficult it is to be outside of fellowship in person Lord there's just something special about getting together with the people of God or we pray that you would touch each one Lord it gets lonely it gets more difficult Laura but we're trusting in you that you have a purpose and plan and Lord in this time Lord we have more time than we've ever had before Lord maybe just dig into your word may our prayer lives flourish Lord may have just set a hunger lure for fellowship we're not just with each other here Lord but for fellowship together with you and that marriage supper of the Lamb Lord bless your people richly we pray Lord for their

and we look forward to our fellowship with our brother maybe she'd get maybe again online but again praying the Lord would open away from maybe sometimes to move back here yeah and sister Blanca and and the children and the children was so real I thought they were sitting in the back seat and I was wondering I said which one is that hey man so again just to show a game that the miracle of the online stuff that it sounds like it's here and brother Jonathan sounded like he was here so thank the Lord for the word and all my old brothers history it was it was the Lord just pray we just saying things whether Jonathan for yielding to the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen but it was God using our brother to speak and to reveal to us and to exhort us what concerning the things that we needed

o'clock and our brother Stephen coffee a man and also we may I don't know in near future be able to get our brother George Smith on line I was in contact with him and oh he wanted me to send greetings to the Saints here and he I asked him how things were going there of course it was it was it wasn't so good here and he said he said brother jury saw hunkered down and he and he said in his in his house in this apartment whatever but he said I he said I today or this within that morning he was ministering to oh my I think twas three over three hundred ministry and brethren in another country what country was that I'm not sure I'm not sure in another country and he was doing it of course again it was online as IRA don't let our brother Jonathan ministering to us that he was ministering to them oh yeah because he I don't know if he had gotten to go to Brazil he was planning on going to Brazil before this coronavirus struck and so on so but but of course he stuck like like all of us he

allow allow that amen praise the name of the Lord so Lord bless you brother Bob so be in prayer and God bless brother Jonathan and his family amen god bless you amen praise the Lord I enjoyed it too it was wonderful absolutely wonderful praise the Lord one thing that there's a lot of things you said it struck me but one in particular he said when everything that were forgetting to quote everything falls together he said when when we find out who we are and that's what struck me was a father and said the same thing when the bride finds out who she is the rapture will go right so that and I think that's how close we are what more more and more the word is being revealed to us and I believe we're getting to that place so brother John told me what the sing about ten times throughout

so before we go let's sing 158 all he wants is you and I just want to look nice brother Matt if you can come up and close in prayer and remember to pray for needs that were mentioned earlier and remember brother John of course is sister Blanco in the family we thank the Lord for what we've heard over the past two nights and may God just blessed him and ministered to them and remember of course he believes and and brother Matt's need for work the course and other effort as well and brother antic and also I would just like to say tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow morning 11:00 o'clock brother Stephen coffee will be ministering and so I wanna remember him tomorrow and brother America take song service in the morning and so being in prayer for him that his voice holds out and and then tomorrow evening we'll have a sing-along and I'll be leading that so just pray for us I'm having with all the musicians here I think and by grace and it'd be nice to have ya okay no more than five people in the building right there most of the musicians here tomorrow night at 6 o'clock right and so just be in prayer for that and it's a kind of a virtual one so just pray for my voice that it it hangs in there so because it's more of a worship type of gathering and in lieu of having a fellowship at Build America single oh yeah and what we wanted is if you have a song in your heart or a course that you want us to sing just text probably better Matt and/or myself you can you can text us and we will get your song on the air for you so that's that's what we want to do it's not just me driving this necessarily or anybody else it's this is for the whole congregation so whatever you want song we'll do our best to to sing it and if the receiver if there was another prayer request that I have and it's the one that's been my burden and I think everybody else's and then I'm longing for today when everybody's back in this congregation and you know I don't want to be have to open the window on this side of the building and hear brother Chad you know and hallelujah from up there by Dominion I would rather have him you know okay to yell hallelujah by the way so so anyway being prayer for that I think it's important and I believe that's the desire of the de pride and I believe it's the desire of the believers in this church and we want to get together as one and worship the Lord amen so thank you for your attention tonight I trust it's all been a blessing to you and when you text for a song it it doesn't matter if we sang this song tonight or gonna mark you let it the night before if you want a song again we'll sing it again right some where we're here to serve at the bodies pleasure at the Lord pleasure amen so let's sing that all he wants is you and brother Matthew will close in prayer Oh [Music] Oh Oh [Music] Oh praise the Lord [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Music] Oh hallelujah [Music] oh praise the Lord [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord I pray father that as we draw this day to a close that that there would be our hearts prayer father is that all we want is you Lord father as we go through these different times father I pray Lord that you're we've just recognized your grace father even though we're separated literally by distance father in your eyes were next to each other in your presence my father we we are deed honored and blessed by your presence here this day father and I believe everyone does listening could say the same thing and Lord we are humbled by this experience father and Lord I prayed that as we progressed forward in the days ahead we don't know what they are Father but Lord may we just feel your guiding hand in our lives helping us to overcome and various weaknesses in our flesh father Lord as I'll just read an inscription Lord says that once just once the dross is removed from the silver it is a vessel then fit for the refiner Lord may we be refined may we past the stage of getting the dross out of us out of us Lord now Lord may we be just be being shaped into the mold and the image of Christ Father our Redeemer lord I pray that you just help us Lord to continue to overcome Lord forgive us where we fail you Lord Lord we don't mean - lord I pray that you just continue to strengthen us Lord you know the different needs the different requests father the Lord made me not forget to thank you for the many blessings you've bestowed upon us little things that we don't realize that you've been there beside us with your arm wrapped around us to shield us from dangerous in a world filled with negativity and fear Lord may we continue to look up to look up to You Father and to thank you for your grace for your mercy for the blessings you've bestowed upon us for the revelation you've given us for the technology law to include brother Jonathan and tomorrow brother Stephen into these services Lord we couldn't do this four or five years ago but now it can happen so seamlessly Lord we thank
