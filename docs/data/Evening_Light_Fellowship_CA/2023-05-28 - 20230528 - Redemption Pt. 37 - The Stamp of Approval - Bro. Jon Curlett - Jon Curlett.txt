Luke chapter nine amen we've we're thankful to have sister delfina's mother here visiting with us for a while amen God bless you Sister there's also sister Maureen's birthday yesterday so a belated happy birthday to her and then of course the the big news is that we welcomed Wesley Mark Coffey into the world this weekend brother Kim or brother Paul and Sister Kim so they're headed home today Lord willing and just trusting that God will continue to give her healing and Grace Just in these these coming days and weeks and of course brother Paul and the family as well it'll be a a new life for Michael as well he's no longer the only child now he's going to start to see Mama pulling away a bit and daddy pulling away a bit and now he's going to take second place for a while so that's hard on him too it's hard on him and it's it's a it's a period of him growing and and life-changing so we'll want to remember him as well hey man it's good to be in service thankful for the sunshine if only to show delfina's mother that it's not always rainy and cloudy and windy in Newfoundland amen amen it's wonderful to have it amen Luke chapter 9 verse 28 says and it came to pass about an eight eight days after these Saints he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistening and behold they're talked with him two men which were Moses and Elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him and it came to pass as they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master if it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias not knowing what he said and while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear him and when the voice was passed Jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen amen God bless you you can have your seats May bless the reading of his word man I want to take a we're continuing on our series on Redemption of course but I want to take us now into the the full thought of adoption and and I want to take as a title for this service and Lord willing Wednesday night as well the stamp of approval and and I think as we've been preaching so much on adoption and and like I said in the last service or two it feels sometimes like a checklist and and it seems like like we're preaching this big massive thing that you're supposed to be and you are supposed to be it remember the the way to get there is Progressive it's God building us up bit by bit but also in that we we talked about the pain and the suffering and the chastenings and we also enjoyed that service I know but the thing is is that we get to a place sometimes and especially when the ministers dwelling on it that we can feel like everything is bad everything's tough and this idea of uh this process of adoption in the this period of time before you're truly adopted into the family of God that it's difficult and it's all difficult and it's all pain and it's all learning and it's all schooling and there's no good times and there's no enjoyable times it's just a slog through life and I kind of want to dispel that this morning I want to maybe take us up to a little higher plane because I want to remind you that Jesus went through an adoption process and that's what we're going to go through today I want to show you the ultimate example of what adoption looks like and if God's own son in the perfect flesh had to go through it then how much more do we have to go through it but yet he still had to go through it amen and so I want to show you through through his life what adoption looks like and what that process looks like not just so we'll see the pain and the suffering but we'll see the victories and we'll see the glory and we'll see the the love and we'll see the just the the overcoming that was in all of those things and we can take courage and we can take some Joy this morning that in all of this we're going to have highs and there's going to be good times and God can use us even before we're adopted of course he can do that and in Hebrews 5 Paul would say this so also Christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but he that said unto him Thou Art my son today have I begotten thee he's pointing out that the glory of Christ was not in that he said it but that it was foretold of him in the first place that it was found in the word and it says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered but we don't want to dwell just on the suffering he says and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him and we look at the things that he suffered and he was born under a cloud he was born under a bad name he was born out of wedlock as far as the world was concerned he was born before his parents were officially married and then he was born in a bad Town remember he was born in in he came from a place called Nazareth he wasn't born there but he came from there he lived there and then you know and when Philip comes to Nathanael Nathanael says to him can anything good come out of Nazareth he was born on the wrong side of the tracks today maybe we'd say he was born up in Shea Heights or over in stab Court somewhere or something to say can anything good come out of there can anything good come out of that Ministry can anything good come out of that church he was born under a cloud they called him a drunk throughout his life they called him many things and he had to suffer through a reputation that was not Stellar maybe the way some of ours are being born into good families and good homes with a good reputation in these things he didn't have those sorts of things but through all of this he what he conquered and there was Victory inside of those things but I want you to realize that even in those early days Christ was the same as you and I he was sinless he was in perfect flesh but yet he was the same as you and I he did not even have the Holy Spirit upon him at that point he had to go through his early life as Adam did and as Eve would have done it he was a Son of God just like Adam remember it says in Luke 3 38 it says who was the son of Enoch who was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God Jesus Christ was the second Adam and so he was born exactly the way Adam was in terms of his flesh and the sinlessness and the Perfection that was there Adam was no different than Christ and so everything Christ went through he went through to prove that Adam could have done it that it was up to Adam to do it or not to do it but he was in the same situation he was in the same flesh and he could live a sinless life and we know that Adam was not fooled by Satan but rather he willingly chose to go with Eve to go with his wife into sin so that he could go with her and Trust the Redemption process later down the road but we look at Jesus life and in Luke 2 40 speaking of Jesus it says and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit he grew strong he increased in his Spirit he was filled with wisdom and what was upon him was the Holy Spirit upon him no and the grace of God was upon Him church I want you to realize that Grace has a lot of power Grace has so much to do with our lives especially early on in life my wife and I were talking about this on our walk yesterday how that you see that some people will do the exact same thing you do and they get destroyed for it and yet God's grace and he brings you in and you just get a little tap on the hand or sometimes you don't get anything because he's preserving you for a future he's preserving you according to his word because you're a part of him you're in his word and he's got to bring you there so his grace will keep you and Christ in the days of his youth it was the grace of God that kept him amen but the grace of God always brings you to a faith that pleases God and that's what it was doing in Jesus it was bringing him to a walk of Faith even before the Holy Spirit could come upon him see yourself in the scripture today what he went through we've got to go through and I'm thankful for Grace because Grace has kept me so far but then he's given me the Holy Spirit to do a greater work in my life but the grace keeps us for so long he knew who he was without a shadow of a doubt Christ knew who he was by the word that he was the son of God that he was a messiah and we see when he went to Jerusalem with his family with his parents at the age of 12 and he goes there and they leave after the after the feast and they're headed home and they don't realize he's not with them and then they go through the Caravan where's Jesus oh we don't have him we thought he was with you and they have to go all the way back to the temple and they find him there and he's teaching and asking questions and he says why are you mad don't you know that I must be about my father's business at 12 years old he knows who he is how by the word he has found his place in the word and he believes it completely and wholeheartedly and even at the age of 12 he's given himself completely to that and he says I've got to be about my father's business not carpentry but to be in the word and to be the Fulfillment of the word it says after that though he says that he he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature he's growing and growing its line upon line precept upon precept the perfect Son of God growing into his position it says and he found favor with God and man and I took 30 years 30 years for perfect flesh to come to the place where God could come down and anoint him for purpose and he spent 30 of those years growing in wisdom growing in stature and getting to a perfect place where God was ready to work with him you say if it took him 30 years how am I going to get there if perfect flesh comes down and God has to work with him for 30 years before he gives him the Holy Ghost and then has to wait another three years to have to adopt him what hope do you and I have you and I have the same hope that Christ did that it was written in the word of him and therefore it's going to happen we have to find our place in the word we have to find our message recognize our day and its message not that it's just to us but that is about us that it is for us and that we can find our place and then we start to walk and we believe it and God comes down and he seals our belief with the Holy Spirit and it takes us into the word and so we're not just believing it we're not just looking outside it and saying oh that's wonderful Revelation 10 7 is wonderful praise the Lord but you move to Revelation 10 8 and you take the book and you start to eat it and it starts to come out of your life amen but he started the same as You and I by faith under the grace of God he saw himself in the word and he said that's me that's me and he started to live like the word said he lived like the word said not started he did it that was his perfection in there but you start with Grace under the word of God and then he gives you Faith to move further and further into it amen but watch the progression because I want you to see yourself in the Life of Christ because remember in Romans 8 29 it says that for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be what the first born of many Brethren so what he went through we've got to go through what He Is We will be he's the first of many that are coming behind him and so what his process is is what our process is going to be he didn't skip anything he didn't get a jump start on us all he had was perfect flesh sinless flesh but he went through everything the way we were the same Temptations the same trials the same issues the same people the same desires every single bit of it was there for him amen so in other words as throughout Palestine in Romans we are just like Christ in terms of where we are in the plan of God what he did with him he's going to do for you and the effects that he had in him he's going to have on us why because we're written into the word and we've just got to find our place in the word and say what is my message for my day and can I step into these things it's like we spoke about in the last service in that that seed of the Lily everything that was ever going to be in that Lily was in it in seed form and when the seed of God is inside you everything you're going to be is there already and God placed it there and nothing's going to stop it from coming forth nothing's going to stop him from coming forth it just takes like like we said last service getting in the presence of the Sun the s-o-n getting in the presence of God to bring out what's inside of you and it'll take you all the way to the fruition of of the perfect image that God had intended but watch Jesus he's 30 years old now and it says and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and low the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased you know what that tells me that means you can please God before you ever get the Holy Ghost by simple obedience by simple Faith by reading the word of God and stepping into it you can please God he can't give you the Holy Ghost until you obey Acts 2 38 it pleases God when you repent and you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and then he gives you the Holy Ghost you've got to do that you've got to do that and then he can lead you further into truth and further into purpose we know that that Jesus was walking by faith up to this point we don't know what gifts he had maybe he had some maybe he had none we don't know if he saw Visions If he if he if he had voices or dreams or anything like that we generally don't know that but we know that he was walking by faith up to this point because the Holy Ghost was not given to him God was not indwelling his Temple just yet he was an ordinary man yet sinless and we'll read that quote later where brother random talks about it but he says then when Christ came on earth when he was baptized in Jordan as the washing of the lamb at the Brazen labor notice then John bear record seeing the spirit of God like a dove coming from above and it settled on him that in and of itself is not special because men of old wrote scriptures as the Holy Spirit inspired them they were anointed temporarily and you saw with the prophets you saw with David you saw it with Moses and these different men they had the anointing they had the spirit of God on them temporarily but watch this it settled on him and it went into him God coming to his Temple Glory see yourself in this God coming into his Temple he was coming into him he was now indwelling he says God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself that was his Temple he said he was the firstborn of many Brethren so that means that there's got to be other temples that are coming behind and we've got to be able to receive the Holy Spirit the same way that Christ did even in this sinful flesh that's why we have to be what repent and be baptized put ourselves under the blood and then we come out sinless and then God can indwell the temple that he's he's ordained from the foundation of the world Amen listen this is the path that we must follow it means and it means we have to believe as Christ did the word says what we're going to be that's the greatest thing the greatest revelation we can have is that we're in the word that it is for me it is about me and it is me you get a revelation that you are in the word and the word is in you then nothing will stop you because you'll keep pressing because whatever's in you is going to come out remember we said last service you overcome by what you are by what's inside you you if you're the word you overcome by the word that's how Christ overcame by the word if you're emotional then you'll try to do your pep talks and you'll try and work your way up and it'll fall flat if you're intellectual you'll try and and believe your way into it and you'll try and use logic and you'll try and use Doctrine to get you into it and that'll fail as well but if you get the word inside you the person of the word the Holy Spirit that's what's going to take you across the finish line today Christ we saw in Paul would talk about he says in the seed singular Christ in him everyone else comes through that was the victory that was in Isaac was Christ that was the original seed that was the one that was coming the overcomer but then John would say this he said verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone so we had to see the week come up we had to see Christ grow and mature into the perfect Son of God but he says now he's got to die because otherwise if he doesn't die then he's going to be the only one he's already said there's going to be many Brethren so it means he's got to die he says but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit it'll bring forth the same thing that he was it'll bring forth more sons of God it'll bring forth more Daughters of God it'll bring forth children of God just like Christ was it'll bring forth the word that's what he's going to have to do in all of this but listen to this quote to get an idea of what was happening at that scene with John it says now he was the son of God when he was born we've been saying this all through this series on adoption you're born a son Jonathan and Jensen and Samuel are my sons as soon as they are born but they're not adopted the way the scripture talks about it until they come to a place of maturity but they're born a son but when he was baptized by John on the Jordan they saw the Holy Spirit descending like a dove and remained on him like I said there were many men before that that the Holy Spirit had descended on but it always went back again because they were under the blood of bulls and goats but now it stays here amen and it what is it it's Christ ushering a new age by way of example of men that are going to be reunited with God men that are going to have access to God women that are going to have access to God not just access to them but they're going to have him the relationship is going to be restored it says in him being the word then the word begin to show itself you might be born the word as in you are a son or daughter of God the word is in there but as soon as you get the Holy Spirit that's when the word starts to show itself the word began to manifest itself why the Holy Spirit was in there speaking the word of God that's what causes us to be quick and that's the quickening power we're looking for is the holy spirit inside us that takes this end time message that takes the word that's written about us and makes it live day to day that brings us to a place of overcoming that brings us to a place of trust that brings us to a place of relationship in our lives it wasn't until Christ comes and he is baptized with the Holy Spirit the way we are that God is indwelling flesh as the first time we see it and we know that there's not going to be just one but there's going to be many of those amen he was called to be Messiah he was called to be the anointed one he was called to be the Redeemer he was called to be the deliverer but until this happened none of it was possible but as soon as he gets the Holy Spirit Everything Changes and watch the very first thing watch the order of events because it's for our admonition today it says then was Jesus led up of the spirit in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil in another part of the scripture says the Holy Spirit drove him forced him into it and led him into it and it led him there for 40 days and 40 nights to be tempted I was listening to brother Donnie Reagan for a few minutes earlier this week and he was talking about fasting he says if God calls you to fast he says then you won't be hungry and he points to this scripture and he says that's proof that when God wants you to fast you won't be hungry and as soon as God wants you to stop fasting you'll get hungry and he says and then you need to eat but notice that Satan doesn't come and tempt him while he's not hungry he's in the fast scene and he and he's he's going through it and there's nothing there but as soon as the 40 days is over then he's hungry and then the Temptation comes because he doesn't have food with him and then Satan comes and he tests him to try and produce food out of out of stones bred out of stones and these different things this is the real start of Jesus training and the first thing he does is he's taken in and he's tempted to what will he stay with the word or will he use this newfound power that he has this life of the holy spirit for himself and why was it because Jesus Christ the man the flesh the body wasn't proven to God's satisfaction yet that seems an odd thing to say about the the manifested Son of God but in in point of fact he's not the manifested Son of God yet he's got a lot more to do before he comes to that point but he's got to be proven the same way each and every one of us and we know he passed that Temptation with Satan we covered that in the last service but I wanted to talk to you about this because I want you to see that this time of this process leading up to adoption is not all pain and sorrow and rough times and and just learning there's a beauty in it and there's a victory in it and there's a glory in it that's being manifested through the children of God as they come through this process watch this this is right after the Temptation it says and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written now remember he's been in the Tabernacle he's been in the temple he's been in the synagogue in Nazareth many times the word has been sitting there for hundreds of years and he has never read this scripture why remember he was called to be the Messiah he was the son of God he was born the Son of God he was ordained to it all but until he gets the spirit he can't read the scripture but Watch What Happens he says this is what he reads the spirit of the Lord is upon me until the spirit of the Lord was upon him he can't read that it's all prophecy until he has it but as soon as he reads it now he can say it's today he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because why he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised he'd been doing this all before he came there and he proved it and now he's coming in he's saying why and he's pointing to back in the word where it said he was going to do this to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and gave it to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened upon him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wondered at what the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said unto him is not or they said is not this Joseph's son Jesus has just gotten the holy spirit this is maybe mere days or weeks after he's gotten it and he's already coming out and he's saying I am him I am the Messiah I'm the anointed one I'm the deliverer I am the one that has been prophesied all throughout time I'm what you've been waiting for it's me the day is here the time is here the age is here this is the moment it's coming to pass right in your midst today the same thing has to happen today not just through a prophet but through a people that we can say this day the scripture is fulfilled amen what a service that ought to have been in that synagogue that day when God indwelling flesh Christ the God man is sitting in the church and he's saying the word is being fulfilled in your midst what that ought to do to us today because he's here the same way except the Corporal body brother Branham said he's here in our midst and he's bringing to pass that which was written for this day this day this scripture is being fulfilled he had fulfilled it all but he was in the anointing and his work was starting and he was going to do all of it amen we say is it time I was reading that that sermon by Brother Jason Watkins on the end of all things and he says there it's time God's wrapping up with the Gentiles the next thing he's got is the 144 000 for the Jews to to seal them in and then everything's over he's wrapping everything up we're at the end of the end this is it church we are so close to going away it's not funny is it time brother John it is time it is time it is time it is time we ought to be an expectation we ought to be in surrender we ought to be in the word of God we ought to be on our knees saying God don't leave me behind don't let me hold you back don't let me hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit don't let me hinder the change that's going on in these things and yet they've rejected him right there that should have been the shoutiness most Hallelujah glory-filled service that they had ever had and yet they rejected him and they tried to kill him they led him to a cliff and they were going to throw him off the cliff and it but it wasn't his time and so he walked right through the crowd and he continued his ministry was it a trial yes was it tough for him he's there he's preaching he's under the anointing and it was the start of a great ministry and the first thing they did was rejected him but Watch What Happens through all of these things he spends the next three three and a half years and he's building up his disciples and he's going around and he's preaching the word and he's bringing he's setting the word in order he's getting them realigned with what God really intended for these different things and he raises the dead and he walks on water and he feeds five thousand here and he he takes Five Loaves and two fishes and he magnifies it in and has 12 baskets left over he's not even adopted yet church and yet in all of that look at the Miracles look at the signs and wonders look at the wonderful things that God had for him throughout his adoption process I don't think I'm adopted yet maybe I am but I don't think so because I think there's a lot further God has to take me but that doesn't mean that God hasn't done things in my life that God hasn't used me in my life and I know you guys have seen it as well listen we are going we are not just going to see things but we have seen things we're not just going to see Miracles we have seen Miracles we're not just going to see Heelys we are seeing healings we're not just going to see the supernatural we have seen the supernatural in this process we've seen in my own family myself we're Witnesses of all of those things so don't look at it and just say we're just going to have to go through school and slog know the glory of God is being revealed bit by bit as he grows you as well and that's why people miss it is because we don't go from A to Z in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's the final changes the twinkling of an eye but everything's so Progressive people don't realize the revealing of Christ in your life but it's happening nonetheless the question is can you see it what matters is that you see it not that everybody else does can you see the change can you see the glory of God what was God doing through Christ he was proving and testing and showing that that flesh was perfectly surrendered to him that's what he was showing through all of this that's what was going on he was being prepared to do something that no one had ever done Christ was going to do something that nobody had ever done before we'd have people that hadn't seen death but we hadn't seen people that had died and come back to life and lived eternally he was going to have to lay his life down willingly and raise it up again and go back to beside the Throne of God Amen when we were in school maybe not all of us but most of us had moments of great achievement of Joy where we went through the we went through the semester we went through the year and we wrote the final exam and we got an A on it or maybe we just passed and that was Victory enough but my point is that through all of those things there was a victory there was a moment of achievement you know we I remember every year we used to have our our sports day and we go out and we'd all have to compete and we'd have to run all the Sprints and the the longer races and the shot put and the javelin and all these different things and guess what people won medals people got first place or got Podium finishes and those things and we look at that and say we train for those things or maybe we didn't but in the end we got something out of it and that's what I want you to understand is that through all of this there's something in it for you and there's an enjoyment and there's a piece and there's a love that can come through all of this there's a satisfaction there's a using of God that happens through all of this because God grows you and as he proves you and tests you he'll use you in the areas that he's proven you at absolutely we see that through all all things you look at David David as soon as God anoints him to be king he goes back to the sheep and you say well what's so big about that but in that sheep Duty that he had he was doing what he was killing a lion and he was killing a bear even as a young man with weapons that would never do that normally what was it God was proving through all of this that he was with him and that he was going to take him all the way to kingship if he just waited out if he'd just go through the process what was he doing he was showing David the anointings on you to do this and that means Victory belongs to you as long as you stay with the word as long as you stay with what I've told you to do what is it in the time of proving there is always victory there is always victory in there because otherwise how can you be proved there's always got to come a victory there's always got to come an anointing that that takes you to overcoming power why because God doesn't waste his time God's not wasting time just so he can say you're perfect he's growing you and he's maturing you so that he can use you as you move through yeah you know I trust my oldest son to go out and start my car and you know what that's a help to the family it's a little help but it's a help I don't trust him to drive the car I don't trust him to move it around in the driveway but I trust him to start it and get it warmed up in the winter so that I don't have to go to do it or Blanca doesn't have to go and do it and you know what that's a thrill for him the first time and the second time the third time then he just starts to see we're using him but my point is is that for him the first time he goes out and he starts that car and there's nobody around what is it it's a thrill the first time God uses you for something there's a thrill that comes with it you're like yes he's finally trusting me he finally believes I'm ready to do something all of us boys want to drive immediately I saw brother Mark out there with Michael the other day in this parking lot and he had Michael driving the car why Michael wants to drive the car maybe it was Rafi I don't remember but what he's moving the wheel and brother Mark's working the pedals and he's also controlling the wheel to make sure he doesn't go too crazy with it but sometimes what do we want to do we want to drive the car right away if I can start it I ought to be able to drive it but we want to jump straight to full adoption which is doing 100 kilometers an hour on the highway when we've only just been given the keys to start it you've got to build through the process but there's a blessing there's a joy there's a there there's something there's a satisfaction that comes through these things what about the first time you you know you I remember the first time I operated a uh a lawnmower and I used to walk with Dad and he'd he'd be pushing the mower like this but it had a lower bar here and I would walk in front of his feet and put my feet put my hands on the middle bar and push it and I don't know how he put up with it because you know you're trying to move quickly with the mower and I'm just this little short kid I'm so short that I'm pushing that chest height into the middle bar of the of the lawnmower and yet dad would let me mow the lawn with him and what a treat that was and what was he doing I wasn't helping him in any way in fact I was probably hindering him a bit but he was getting me used to what I was going to have to do later and then what a thriller was the first time that I got to mow the lawn by myself until I learned that they were using me again but that's not the principle we're going at today the thing is it was a thrill to do it wasn't it you go out there and you fired up here in Newfoundland we don't get enough grass but we do know about snow blowers and the first time that Dad says all right son you can use the snow blower and what is it he starts it and he gets it in position and then he tells you go forward and all you do is a straight cut don't you slow and easy you're not close to the cars you're not close to anything that's of value and he gets you to go forward maybe he lets you pull it back and then he aligns it again and then forward and back forward and back and it's just a little bit but there comes a day where what he says all right go do the go do the driveway son and you got to start it and you got to move it and you got to keep from hitting cars but there's a thrill through all of this that hey he trusts me I can do this he sees it I'm capable of doing it and then our focus is what help me not to hit the cars help me not to grind up something that I'm not supposed to put through the Snowshoe right but there's that that thrill that comes with it amen we think about our our young sisters and the first time the mama says you can bake cookies it's always the neatest little thing because they're there and they're mixing things up you know Samuel likes to do it he likes to get up there and get his hands all dirty and these different things but but the girls they do that and they make those cookies and it's such a simple thing to an adult but to the little children to the young girls it's such a big deal because it's their first bit of baking and what is it pretty soon after a while they'll say mama can I make some cookies and mama says sure go do it you understand the equipment you understand the process you understand how to operate these things and now go do it what am I getting at there's an enjoyment in the learning there's something that comes with these things sometimes I think the problem is that we put pressure on ourselves to be super Christians immediately if you're performance driven you want to be a super Christian right now it's what I wanted to be didn't happen and guess what it won't happen for you either why because God builds us bit by bit he's building us up into the stature of a perfect child of God a perfect son and daughter of God so he's building us up bit by bit I I have the same enthusiasm is a habit killer enthusiasm is a habit killer because what happens is we want to be a super Christian and so brother John's been speaking about devotions and reading your Bible and praying and so do we say what do we say we say I'm going to go and I'm going to have an hour worth of devotions every single morning first thing and you haven't been having devotions all along or it's been sporadically for a few minutes here and there and what do you do you get up the first morning you get up an hour early and you're tired but you go do it because your enthusiasm is there and you said you do it the second morning you get up but maybe you're only up 15 minutes early third minute you're up and you're 45 minutes early by the end of the week you're not having devotions at all you're just back to sleeping in why because you tried to run a marathon on your first day of running I'd rather you spent 10 minutes a day for the rest of the year than last a week at an hour a day and then just lose the Habit altogether you've got to build yourself up into it you got to build yourself up into it you got to give yourself the time listen it's not easy to get up in the mornings to get up early and give the first part of your day here it struck me when brother Dwayne was here he was talking to me church I don't know about you he said what's the first thing you do in the morning you pick up your phone you know what that is now that's not the first thing that was for me I don't pick up my phone phone I stay there and I pray for just a couple minutes for the start of my day then I go take my shower and then I go down and I have my devotions but the first thing I do is I give a part of my day to God and say Lord this is your day order it keep me in it but the thing is you can't run a marathon your first day of training you've got to work your way up to it don't think that your enthusiasm is going to take you through remember I keep telling that story about my mother that that wore makeup and she said Lord I know you don't want me to wake wear makeup that's what Jezebel did but I like my makeup and so she said Lord you take me take it away from me and in six months the Lord took it away from her Bit by Bit by Bit listen let him Build You Up Bit by Bit by Bit sometimes he's going to give us big jumps and we'll we'll plan we'll we'll Plateau for a bit and then we'll get a big jump but usually the growth of God that he has in our lives is just gradual and we've got to be able to rest in the gradual work of him and not put pressure on ourselves because why it's not up to us to fulfill it it's up to him it's his word it's his promise it's his prophecy all we have to do is surrender ourselves to it but we do have a choice we do have a decision and let me say this you're not going to get up earlier if you don't go to bed earlier you're not going to have the right habits if you're not taking out some of your old habits as well you're going to have to make room and that's your decision to do but start slow and get a taste for it start seeing the effects of it in your life and pretty soon you'll want it more and more and more and you'll realize the benefit of it and you'll realize the need for it and you'll realize that when you feed on that other things start to magically fall away that is the way it is because what under the preaching or the hearing of the word under the reading of the word will come Faith to draw you into what God has for you don't try and do it yourself amen it's God that's got to do the work except the Lord build the house they labor in vain it's his working it's our surrendering it's us saying Lord I need you in these things but the very things that Jesus was doing and through all of these three three and a half years were proving him even so much that the priesthood had to privately not publicly but privately agree we know that no man can do these things except God be with them that was even the testimony of his enemies the ones that ultimately put him on the cross amen was that they but yet in all of that in all of that he was not adopted by God yet that they could say your life is so God like that we know that God is with you and yet he wasn't even fully adopted he was a holy ghost-filled man just like we are sinless but in flesh Jesus adoption ceremony we read at the beginning we'll read it again in a minute that just that came just mere months before his crucifixion and I don't know the exact timeline I I didn't spend a ton of time on it I'll be honest because it doesn't matter for my point but some say it's as far away as eight months before and then traditionally they say it's 40 days before his crucifixion but we're talking about a man a child of God a Son of God that was adopted just at the very end of his life and it was to prepare him for that thing that we talked about earlier that's why I don't worry about adoption what I ask myself is am I in the process because the timeline belongs to God adoption will happen in God's time I was listening to adoption number four this morning and brother Bram says this and it's not in this I just wrote in my notes he says Don't Be Afraid everything's all right everything works all along he says keep your heart right he's talking about adoption he's saying no I preached everything to you about what you are supposed to look like as a son and daughter of God and he says don't worry God will take you through you got the Holy Ghost Keep Your Heart Right and God will bring you through this entire process amen amen it's a promise to us and all I want all my prayer is this Lord don't let me waste your time don't let me waste your work listen if all I'm doing is starting the car for somebody that's higher up the ladder let me start the car if all I'm doing is praying for the needs of the church if all I'm doing is mowing the grass so somebody else doesn't have to do it and can put their efforts and gifts into something else let me be that let me let me be effective where I'm at right now today let me not just be looking forward to the future and saying well when I get this and when you give me that and no no no no Lord let me be effective today let me have Victory today let me have have something that I can do for your kingdom today right where I'm at and what I have found is when my mentality is Lord use me where I'm at miraculously I get used I can't tell you how many times I've I've testified and witnessed to people over the last couple of months just about where we're at and what's going on and what is it it's God saying I'll use you where you're at son I'll use you where you're at I'm not trying to draw them to me I'm not trying to draw them us I'm trying to draw them to Christ I'm putting it out there to see what happens will they nibble the bait will the life be salty will the testimony be salty enough to get them through these doors so they can hear the word of God that's it that's it takes God to save them but he's got to use a voice somewhere and I believe we've got a lot of voices here we got a lot of lives here that can be a testimony to the things of God that are happening in this age amen I want to apply what I know now if I pass the test Lord help me not to be delinquent and just say well we'll put it on the Shelf let me use what I've got however little it is today let's look at that adoption scene we'll look at it from Mark 9 says and he said unto them verily I say unto you that there be some of them some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power that was the day of Pentecost The Upper Room so after six days Jesus taketh them with him Peter taketh with him Peter James and John and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no Fuller on Earth can wipe them and there appeared unto them Elias and Moses and they were talking with Jesus and Peter answered and said to Jesus Master it is good for us to be here let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias and he wished not what to say for they were sore afraid and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear him now remember when he's at Jordan being baptized by John he was his beloved Son then let me add to that it says in whom I am well pleased before he had the Holy Ghost on him yet his life pleased God your life can please God Church simple obedience will please God but when you get the Holy Ghost how he takes you from a place of not just pleasing him but to a place where you speak for him because what he's doing here is that nothing about Christ has changed and who he was but what now the trust is there now the proof is there now God is satisfied with what that the idea that that human flesh is so surrendered to him that he can allow it to have authority that he can allow it to have power that he can allow it to speak and what is it what is it it's God saying I'll be silent from heaven now and the voice on Earth speaks for me that's the power and authority that's why Jesus could say all power and authority on heaven in heaven and in Earth is given to me this is where it was speak it and it'll happen whatever you say will happen but I want you to realize that this happens after he has raised the Dead Walked on Water cast out demons multiplied food created things fished with money in its mouth that all happened before he ever said hear ye him this is Christ's adoption ceremony right here and it's God placing his authority in him and he becomes God's absolute and he becomes God's voice on Earth Prophet God would say this he says everything that he gave him possession over will take place God adopted his own son like that Jesus he says walking as an ordinary man what an ordinary man meaning he was in flesh with the Holy Spirit just like you and I are in flesh with the Holy Spirit he says but one day upon mounts trigger Mount Transfiguration he took three as a witness Peter James and John he says that's hope faith and charity he called them out and he separated Jesus from them and he overshadowed him and the Bible said his raiment Shine Like the Sun and its strength what was it he says that special robe God adopting his own son and they saw Moses and Elijah appear and so forth then they show him and they saw Jesus only and when he looked back then God the Father after putting the robe on his son said this is my beloved Son hear ye him no wonder Jesus could say all the powers in Heaven and Earth is given unto my hand for he was adopted by his father unto the Glorious kingdom of God he went through the exact same process that we go through the prophet of God's saying catch the type recognize that this has to happen for you and then he would continue in the message of hidden life he says now I believe that this is the time that the church has arrived at today that the next great move in the church is for God the move is for God not for building up our numbers not for great this not for great dad not for big finances not for big recognition recognition but our move is for God that it's a people that are seeking after and following after the things of God that they're taking the whole word of God and they're they're embracing it and it's becoming engrafted into them and that word is coming forth again he says for after we've seen the false alarms what the false alarms Luther it was a part and then it failed and then it was Wesley and then it failed and then it was Azusa Street and then they failed they all went into denomination but it was building up and the life of God kept moving he says there's been many false alarms where we thought it was it but it wasn't it now is the time he says but now God will place in his church correctly Apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man-made Seminary bought but God will place into the church not theology run overs and overnights but God will place in the church as God has chosen and as the Holy Ghost has tutored this church and raised it up and in there God will adopt into the position his sons they're already his sons but whether they are worthy of the position that he has for them it's no wonder that John spoke about the false Ministries in the and the and the the ravening Wolves and the ones that came among them and he says the the issue is that they they challenge the idea that Christ came in the flesh because if Christ doesn't come in the flesh then we have no example and we have no process and we have nothing to look forward to and then we can have a religion of our own making without the word power of God in our lives without the the changing power of the holy spirit in us we can believe any Doctrine we can do anything and we see it in the world today we see it in the denominations today they say we believe the word of God but they forget that it's supposed to be God in flesh not just there but after that because he was the first among many brethren so it was supposed to happen in our day so when they said Christ did not come in the flesh they denied that the Son of God came down and indwelt Humanity then what were they saying is you don't have to have it either and more to the point they'd say I don't have to have it and so you could have a minister that could say and do whatever he wanted from behind that Pulpit control the people turn them into a man-made denomination and the power in the life of God went completely out of it Ichabod was written over the door the glory of the Lord has departed and what would happen is they would have a dead Gospel of their own making and the people will be damned by it and that's what we see today sincere people damned because it's men that say it's not the way it used to be look at it the Baptists don't even believe in the Holy Ghost and that's the only thing that's going to get you across the finish line is the baptism of the Holy Ghost look at look at the Catholics they don't believe it certainly not as we do if they do all of them what is it they want an aspect of it they want a portion of it because that's what they identify with but they don't want the whole thing and that's why they deny Christ this is what John said he said beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God he notice he didn't say has come he said is come present tense today he was there Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you've got to believe that he wasn't just there two thousand years ago you got to believe he's here today in flesh in you and I that's what we're resting in that's what we're trusting in is that the same thing that he had is the same thing that we have we have it in part he had it in fullness we know he says in every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world what's he trying to get us to see he's saying find your place in that word recognize what Christ was and recognize you're the exact same thing find your place in the word under grace to give you Faith to step into it and God will bless you with the Holy Spirit and it'll bring you to full manifestation amen well we'll become that word by the power of the Holy Ghost in our life what was the Life of Christ for to give us assurance that the process works that the power is there amen that there's something here where we don't have to stay in our current condition that we don't have to be overcome by this flesh that we don't have to be mired in the things that hold us back but we can have something that raises us up like The Lily out of the muck that we spoke of last service but if we look at the outward if we look at the the public show Christ's most amazing Ministry was pre-adoption pre-adoption he had the signs and wonders he walked on water Walked on Water Church before he was ever adopted that shows what the power of God can do in US but it was bringing him to a greater place but the public show Ministry was all pre-adoption it was all pre-adoption and then God steps down he starts to do something with them why because that wasn't his only purpose it was building up to his real purpose go back to Luke 9. this is speaking of when he's on the mountain there says and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistening and behold there talked with him two men which are Moses and Elias now you say what did they talk about was it this great uplifting conversation it says who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem they spoke of his death in the adoption ceremony aft and that adoption ceremony he steps into his ultimate purpose he steps into the great role of Redeemer of Savior and what they're doing is they're telling him and they're confirming to him the word of what's going to happen to him at Jerusalem Jesus has already talked about this he knows it's going to happen he's told the disciples about it but now these two prophets come and they say this is the last stage of your ministry this is the final portion and this is what you required adoption for because without adoption you would not have been able to do it Christ had to be built up the same way we were what was it they were saying here is your true Kingdom Purpose here is the Apex here's the peak of your ministry is going to be to go to Jerusalem and die amazing not go and raise the dead from somebody else not go and feed another five thousand not go and and fly around the temple or something no your greatest Ministry is going to be that you're going to lay down your life for the sins of the world what is it as soon as this happens Christ moves and everything focuses on getting him to Jerusalem the signs and the Wonders minimal just a couple here and a couple there died away we saw it in the prophets Ministry did we not that he had the signs and the wonders for 20 odd years 25 years 30 years maybe 20 years certainly 15 years and then what happens is the word opens and all of a sudden he says I'm making a turn and everything changes after that same thing happened with Christ Everything Changes what was he doing he was paying the price coming to pay the price for our sins and redeem us he spent three of those years showing us what it meant to be a Son of God showing us what the first Adam should have done and he was showing power and authority and Dominion Adam had all of those things in the creation he was showing us what Adam looked like he was showing us what our lives can look like he was showing us that we don't have to live in in pain and in in suffering from the things of this flesh that we don't have to be bound up by the things we don't have to live a failed or a defeated life he was showing us all those things but that was just proving who he was proving he could go through life sinlessly so that he could what be the acceptable lamb he spent all of those 33 years proving he was the acceptable lamb and then God comes down and says I accept you you're it and God puts his stamp of approval on him and says you are the lamb you're the perfect lamb and I accept you as a sacrifice now go and do your job now do the ultimate thing that I've called for you everything he did to that point church was temporary that that that that young man that he raised in Maine he still died the sick that he healed they got sick later the food that he multiplied was digested and they still needed food the next day everything he did prior to that even raising of Nazareth Lazarus was temporary but now he's moving into an eternal work now he's moving into an eternal work and that's where we ought to see ourselves is that we are not only part of an eternal work we are the manifestation of an eternal work amen what did he show he showed the power of God and yet we still couldn't come back to God he showed what we could have but yet we couldn't have it he showed what we could do and yet we couldn't do it he had to redeem us back because his ultimate goal was redeem redeem not just show who he was but to show us who we are and that required Redemption that required us to be able to come back into the presence of God we look at all these things he did we talk about The Walking On The Water we talk about the multiplying those were wonderful things and I imagine those were shouting meetings can you imagine when they realized that the food was multiplying as they put their hand in can you imagine when that dead boy was raised in name Lazarus has been dead many days and they rolled a stone back and he comes out can you imagine the kind of services those were if I could put it that way and yet that's not the greatest thing that's not the greatest part of his ministry in all of those times Christ had great victories he had overcoming power he had great demonstrations of God in him and yet he was constantly tired he was so tired remember he could sleep in the boat when they thought they were going to drown he was constantly reviled he was rebuked he was rejected people tried to kill him it was constant stress and sorrow and yet the power of God was still with him yet the blessings of God were still with them and he still had great moments of Victory and power and overcoming and these different things you don't have to wait to adoption to overcome that's what God's doing is he's overcoming you all the way through and when he gets you completely overcome that's when he adopts you but you're going to have habits taken away before you come to adoption you better have because that's the working of the Holy Spirit you're going to grow in Grace you're going to grow in knowledge you're going to grow in wisdom and God's going to use you in special ways but he's bringing you to a place where you'll be perfectly surrendered in every aspect amen why did Jesus Christ have to go through all of those things because he was going to have to be okay with more pain than any man had ever endured and ever will endure he had to be able to take the ultimate rebuke the ultimate rejection the ultimate shame crucified naked he had to be able to willingly keep himself at that whipping post and let them rip the muscles and the skin off his body until his bones showed through he had to endure a face being more beat up than any man's face has ever been beaten up willingly he had to have the character he had to have the commitment he had to have something in his life that was proven before he could ever do it and he couldn't have done it until then that's what adoption was it was saying you're ready to go do what I really brought you here for what is it he had to have the character to stay and go through that entire process and believe that the word that told him he had to die was as true as the word that says he was going to pick up his life again he had to have a faith to lay down his life and trust that God that Spirit would come and raise up that body all over again he had to believe that by raw unadulterated faith so he had to have he had to have something inside of him that held him and kept him through that entire process to bring him to the greatest Victory known to humanity the victory to lay down your life and pick it up again and Reign eternally think of this he's just the first one he's just the first one it's for you and I not just for him not just for the disciples that's the argument we hear from most of these things when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Spirit when it comes to the signs and wonders when it comes to all these things they say that was only for the apostles and anything true it's for Sons and Daughters of God alike yesterday today and forever because it's Christ in us the hope of glory doing all of these things Romans 8 says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that she shall be revealed where in US remember he says if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal body mortal mortal here and now today it's the same spirit amen you're called to walk off this Earth without seeing death just like Christ raised up and went we don't have to wait for a resurrection Enoch walked off he's a type of the Bride and that walk he knows the scripture the way it reads is Enoch walked with God and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked brother Brown would say something like he said one day he says that one foot just kind of came up a little bit and he said you know what I might as well keep going why don't you start once you start keep going but you gotta walk you gotta walk you gotta walk you gotta walk keep going don't slack off amen listen he says there's a glory that shall be revealed in US that's not all future tense listen we sit here today and we are Paul said it's to the praise of the of the to the to the Gloria or the praise of his of the glory of his grace that's what's sitting here today we are to his glory right now we are to his glory right now but there's a greater glorification coming but don't ignore the glory that's in you right now that you can live as a son and a daughter of God that you can live in overcoming power that you can have victory over the world in the things of the world today and that there's a blessing in it and there's an enjoyment in it amen we see that adoption if we want to get down to the root of it adoption is about glorification and not glorifying you it's glorifying God through you because remember Jesus said I can only do what the father said I kind of do what he shows me it's about glorifying who the father through us but guess what you get some of that glorification because it's through you it's through you and so there's a benefit to you through all of this even as we get into the very end of these things amen Paul said as I said we're to the praise of the grace Glory of his grace let's Stand Together Stand Together we grow from babies and babies are helpless we looked at little Wesley Mark Coffey over there this morning he's helpless and you know what they say A baby is amazing if it can hold its head up when it's born Selena was amazing they marveled because they held her and the the nurse's hand just moved and Selena's head stayed up even though she was horizontal she said wow she's so strong is anybody odd or amazed that brother Dale can keep his head up today no because as adults keeping your head up is no big deal but for a child a baby a newborn baby keeping your head up is a is an absolute miracle and we see the first time that that baby can grab onto something and pull themselves up we say oh growing so fast so strong so amazing and then look out when they start to walk I mean wow we're just amazed and yet every single one of us can walk all day every day we could walk for 30 kilometers today brother Joe if you and I said let's walk 30k today we do it and we wouldn't even think about it and yet that baby takes one step and we're wow amazed and the baby loves it the toddler loves it and then they move into the next thing and you know I've got my my video of Jensen over in BC and we had a little little small Nets that we put down in the garage and I've got a picture of him and he does the Alex eviction Slap Shot where he does the one time and he comes right down onto one and he fires it up like that and he's looking at the net and I'm right behind the net and the ball goes right up in the top Corner perfect shot yes amazed that's what's happening is God is growing us there are amazing moments where you say Glory I can overcome Glory I can humble myself Glory I can surrender he can use me you're just a little toddler brother John doesn't matter I'm growing in Grace I'm growing in Christ don't don't endure the journey don't just endure it see that there's a benefit in there amen the great test is not how far you can run or how fast it's will you run will you run you know we go through all the these times in school and our parents raise us and then we become 18 and we get to choose what we want to do you know and the question is what are we going to do with it all I'll tell you what you're going to do with it what you've been doing with it until God changes you but how you were when you were 17 years 364 days and and 23 minutes and and you know the last second before you turned 18 whatever you did before 18 is what you're going to do after 18. but what's going to happen is as you step into responsibility you're going to forget to do things maybe you'll get your own apartment sister Delfina and you'll forget to do your wash the first week and then you'll go to school and you realize I don't have any clean clothes guess what you won't forget to do your wash again will you it's a rough experience but then you get to enjoy the benefits of taking care of yourself of having the clean clothes of having a Sanctified life if I could put it that way we make mistakes but what we do is we learn from those and we get the benefits and we get enjoyment from it amen God works through us what happens is we start to say I need to watch out for that that's a Temptation for me that's an issue for me and God starts to pull us through those things and all of a sudden we're starting to work for the kingdom not just for ourselves everything we did for school was for school and was for self-glorification really but once we finish school now we're in it for something else and it's supposed to be for the body of Christ listen to these last two quotes brother Brian says well that's where the church needs to be tonight it needs to be to a place that God will call you off somewhere and do what throw his glory over you spread his power upon you and place you into the body where when you speak something happens that's what the church is needing tonight but if our character goes down instead of going up how's he going to do it he says we've got to continue to believe every work of God and seek after righteousness and do that which is right in the sight of God when how often daily calling on him and daily about his work getting others to come into church trying to get somebody to come serve the Lord all the people you work for the Milkman the postal man the Iceman whoever it is all you come in contact with speak to them about the Lord speak it with seasonable words sweetly don't jump onto them just speak it with sweetness that they'll say say that lady's a real lady she spoke to me about the Lord that man I've never seen such a man he's the nicest man I ever met you know I'd like to have his religion daily calling on him my wife and I were as we were walking yesterday we were talking about this idea that we need to be refreshed in the presence of God that a Sunday morning service or Wednesday night service isn't enough but what we find is as you're walking with God and you're giving God time in your day-to-day life daily daily then you'll find that the answers come more easily you'll find that leadership comes more easily and you're sacrificing your time for a far greater benefit because when you're in the word and you're in the presence of God you slide more easily into his will and there's a great there's there's a great benefit there's a great blessing to being able to find the will of God for your life personally and being able to be used and having the right response you know it's it's it's funny how you know I I speak of of my issues with bad drivers and we experienced a number of them on the way to church this morning and you know when when you're dealing with and the thing is they don't know they're bad drivers and that's the hardest part but we're dealing with people that don't know they're bad drivers and when it comes to God but you know the first thing that because I said the Lord Lord I don't like this temper I have towards these people there's too many of them I'll always be unhappy if I'm on the road I said Lord you got to take it away from me you know the first thing he did he made me have a couple bone-headed moments on the road he let me make a couple mistakes and that one got me humble to realize that they're not all stupid otherwise that makes me stupid and they're not all you know uh inexperienced because I was experienced I still made the mistakes but he humbled me down to do that so that I could put myself in their place and realize hey you needed some Grace there how about some Grace for them that's what he's saying here seasonable words can you imagine this somebody cuts me off nearly hits me and I pull up next to him and I'm gesticulating and yelling and rolling down my window because I want to have a conversation and then I run into him in that parking lot out there and I asked them to come in and hear the word of God you know what they'd say if that's your religion I don't want it right but what God has to do so many times is humble us to realize we've got to be at their level sometimes to understand where they're at to speak a seasonable word to touch them where they're at and bring them in to give them an opportunity amen not put pressure on them not to flash up sometimes the hardest thing we've got to do is give up our right for a harsh reaction for the sake of their soul for a chance to restore them back to bring them into life amen that's what we're looking for daily going about his work that's what we're going to talk about over the next few Services amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we love you Lord and we want to serve you Lord we want to be found Lord as a faithful stewards of your word Lord not just talking about it and not just fellowshipping with ourselves and Lord not just patting ourselves on the back and thanking you for your

will in our lives day in and day out Lord we know there's more for each and every one of us there is more Heavenly Father Lord there's a cry there's a deep that calls to the deep inside of us Lord and
