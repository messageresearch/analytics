[35:52] Amen. Lord Jesus,
[35:55] Lord, I'm thankful I can say I have a
[35:57] joy in my heart tonight,
[36:00] Lord. When we talk to friends and
[36:03] colleagues and people of this world, it
[36:04] seems so few have any joy, Lord. They
[36:09] don't have happiness. They don't have
[36:11] contentment, Lord. They're surrounded by
[36:13] fears and doubts and worries and
[36:15] concerns,
[36:18] Lord. But we know that as we've gathered
[36:19] unto you, Lord, Lord, there's a peace.
[36:22] There's a rest that we have, Lord. And
[36:24] even when things don't look good, Lord,
[36:27] even when things are going the way the
[36:28] Bible says they have to go, Lord, we've
[36:30] got a peace and a rest in knowing that
[36:32] we're secure with you, heavenly father.
[36:34] We've got a place to go, Lord. We have a
[36:36] shelter in a time of storm, Lord, that
[36:39] nothing can harm us or pluck us out of
[36:40] your hands, Lord. So, we're thankful we
[36:43] have an inner rest, an inner joy this
[36:45] morning, this evening, Lord, a love,
[36:47] Lord, a peace, a hope, Lord, all of
[36:49] these things that you've given us by
[36:51] your word and your spirit. Lord, I pray
[36:53] you encourage us tonight, Lord, in the
[36:56] message that's coming forward. Lord, may
[36:58] it just minister to our hearts and our
[37:00] souls, Lord. May it just lift us up,
[37:02] Lord. May it prepare us, Lord, to face
[37:04] another day, the rest of the week,
[37:06] heavenly father. Lord, may it just
[37:08] tighten the ranks a little bit, Lord.
[37:09] Draw us closer to you. We pray, heavenly
[37:11] father. Lord, many not here tonight, we
[37:14] pray your grace to them, Lord. Draw them
[37:16] back to church. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[37:18] name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless
[37:21] you. Turn to John 14 if you would. John
[37:23] chapter 14. Good to be here today. Amen.
[37:26] What a beautiful day it was. I got to go
[37:28] out and take a walk with Biscuit this
[37:30] afternoon. And uh thank you for your
[37:32] prayers for my father. He's home. He's
[37:34] resting comfortably. He said he got 10
[37:36] hours of sleep last night. So uh that's
[37:39] done him some good. And then Biscuit's
[37:41] doing very well also. So we thank the
[37:43] Lord for that. Just by way of reminder,
[37:46] I'll be preaching this Sunday and the
[37:49] Wednesday, but after that, I'm gone to
[37:50] Calgary for a week for work. So, Brother
[37:52] Mark will take the Sunday, November 2nd,
[37:55] and Brother Garfield will take the
[37:56] Wednesday, November 5th. So, just
[37:58] remember them in prayer. Come expecting,
[38:01] support them. Amen. Give them somebody
[38:03] to preach to and uh just come and enjoy
[38:05] the word as it comes with some different
[38:07] gifts. Amen. I was talking to brother
[38:09] John Andy's just before service and he's
[38:11] in New Zealand right now and uh about to
[38:14] preach a family camp. So he said to
[38:15] greet the church and so I'm passing on
[38:17] greetings for brother John Andy's all
[38:19] the way from New Zealand tonight sitting
[38:21] in the airport. Amen. God bless you.
[38:23] John chapter 14 and 12 says verily
[38:26] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[38:29] on me the works that I do shall he do
[38:31] also and greater works than these shall
[38:34] he do because I go unto my father. Amen.
[38:37] God bless You can have your seats this
[38:39] evening. Amen. We're continuing our
[38:41] thought on the mystery finished and
[38:43] we've closed out the thought on the
[38:44] preeminence that we spoke of for two or
[38:46] three services there. We can never get
[38:48] away from that because everything we
[38:49] preach, Christ has the preeminence. The
[38:51] the living word is the center of our
[38:54] lives. Amen. But now we're moving into
[38:55] what happens when Christ has the
[38:57] preeminence because he's got to have the
[38:58] preeminence so he can reveal himself in
[39:00] us. Well, the question now becomes, what
[39:02] does his revealing look like? What does
[39:04] this mystery finish look like? How does
[39:06] he do it? What does he do? How do we
[39:08] know that it's him that's doing it? And
[39:10] we open with the scripture in John 14.
[39:12] And notice that the the condition for
[39:15] this is that he that believeth.
[39:17] He that believeth. Now, that sounds
[39:19] awfully simple, doesn't it? But remember
[39:21] what Jesus said, he that believeth and
[39:23] is baptized, he's the one that's going
[39:24] to be saved. Belief always takes you
[39:26] into action. If you really believe, it
[39:29] takes you into doing something. But he
[39:31] says here, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[39:33] you." That word verily in the original
[39:35] is actually amen. And so Jesus says,
[39:37] "Amen." Amen. And that means truly by
[39:40] when it's spoken by the person that's
[39:42] that's saying something. And so when the
[39:44] person that believes it and receives it
[39:47] responds back with amen. So somebody
[39:49] says truly truly, "Amen. Amen." They say
[39:51] something and if you believe them, you
[39:53] say, "I receive it. I receive it. Amen.
[39:55] Amen. So be it." And so the actor, the
[39:57] word, amen, has to have two parts. It
[40:00] has to have somebody that gives the
[40:01] truth and it has to have somebody that
[40:02] receives the truth. Amen. Amen is not
[40:05] complete until the speaker says it and
[40:08] the hearer says it. That's the fullness
[40:10] of the word. Amen. Amen. So this is this
[40:12] is a people that believe it and they
[40:14] receive it. And he's saying this to the
[40:16] disciples if you remember. And this is
[40:18] well before the day of Pentecost. This
[40:20] is Jesus talking to them before he he's
[40:22] crucified. And they had already healed
[40:24] the sick and raised the dead and cast
[40:26] out demons. They delivered. Many people
[40:28] had many wonderful works in their life.
[40:31] But Jesus said, "He that believes on me,
[40:33] the works that I do shall he do also."
[40:35] He's pointing to something greater than
[40:37] anything they'd achieved so far. Amen.
[40:40] We preached on that. I'm not going to
[40:41] beat a dead horse tonight. But notice
[40:43] that that what's coming down is that
[40:45] they have to do the works of Christ. Not
[40:49] just works, but now it's the works of
[40:50] Christ. And remember Jesus said, "My
[40:52] works are to do the will of the father."
[40:56] not just to do anything. And when you
[40:57] look uh when you're reading through the
[40:59] scriptures, you'll see that sometimes it
[41:01] was God's will to heal everyone.
[41:04] And it says they came to Jesus and he
[41:06] healed them everyone. Sometimes he
[41:08] healed one.
[41:10] Sometimes he healed none. And what did
[41:13] he do? He rebuked the people and tried
[41:15] to snap them out of their unbelief and
[41:17] their cold formality and their religion
[41:19] and those things. Amen. There was no
[41:21] formula to God's will. There's no
[41:24] formula to it. You're not going to
[41:25] figure it out by logic. You're not going
[41:27] to say, "This is what God did here.
[41:28] Therefore, that's what God's going to do
[41:30] there." That doesn't work that way.
[41:32] Amen. I've talked about it before where
[41:33] David fights the Philistines and he goes
[41:35] down and he says, "Lord, do I fight
[41:37] them?" Jesus. And God says, "Yes, go
[41:39] back and fight them. I'll give you the
[41:40] victory." And so, he just goes down in
[41:42] the valley where they were. And he just
[41:44] goes in and he faces them head on and he
[41:45] defeats them. And the next time they
[41:47] come, the exact same place, the exact
[41:49] same people, the exact same problem.
[41:51] David says, "Lord, do I go down and
[41:53] fight them and will you give me the
[41:54] victory?" He says, "Yes, I'll give you
[41:55] the victory, but this time go around the
[41:57] back." And when you hear the sounds of
[41:59] them marching in the trees, they're not
[42:01] marching in the trees. Hear the sound of
[42:02] them marching through the trees. He
[42:04] says, "That's when you attack." Exact
[42:06] same situation, exact same problem,
[42:08] exact same people, completely different
[42:11] leadership. Church, you know what that
[42:13] tells me? Seek him in everything we do.
[42:16] Don't presume. Presumption is what kills
[42:18] believers.
[42:20] Not kills them literally, generally
[42:21] speaking, but what does it do? It puts
[42:23] us into a place where we can lose the
[42:24] battle. Amen. We've got to seek after
[42:26] him day by day. So Jesus showed that
[42:29] it's not a formula, but it's by personal
[42:32] leadership of the spirit of God
[42:34] according to the word of God. Remember
[42:36] what Jesus would say to Nicodemus. He
[42:38] said, "The wind bloweth where it
[42:39] listeth." In other words, the wind blows
[42:41] where it wants, and thou hearest the
[42:43] sound of it, but thou canst not tell
[42:45] whence it cometh and whether it goes. He
[42:47] says, "You can hear it. You can't see
[42:49] it. You don't know where it's coming
[42:50] from. You don't know where it's going."
[42:52] And he says, "So is it. So is everyone."
[42:56] Everyone that is born of the spirit of
[42:58] God. You look at the wind, especially
[43:00] here in Newfoundland. We know a lot
[43:02] about wind, don't we? And guess what?
[43:03] You can't control it.
[43:06] Even Eddie Shear can't predict it.
[43:10] You can't see it.
[43:12] You can't change it. It just is. It just
[43:16] is. And there's no rhyme or reason to
[43:18] it. And believe me, you know, we live
[43:20] down in that that that section of
[43:21] Conception Bay South, right on the
[43:23] water, and boy, you can leave the house
[43:25] and go to the post office and come back
[43:27] and the waves are going in a completely
[43:28] different direction because the wind has
[43:30] changed in that quick. That's the way
[43:31] the wind blows. And so it is. He says,
[43:34] everyone that's born of the spirit,
[43:36] there's no logic to it. There's no logic
[43:40] to it. You're not going to become a
[43:41] child of God. You're not going to
[43:43] understand the mind of God by by by by
[43:46] human reasoning or by trying to figure
[43:48] something out. Amen. That's just not the
[43:50] way it works. Amen. The the people of
[43:52] God, they'll never go against the word
[43:54] of God, but it's not predictable the way
[43:55] that believers will act. When I look at
[43:57] my own life, things I've left, places
[43:59] I've moved, when I've moved, I would
[44:01] have said, you know what, that's really
[44:03] weird. And I've made decisions that by
[44:06] most people's logic wouldn't have made a
[44:08] lot of sense when it came to employment
[44:10] and churches and ministry and all these
[44:12] different things. There's things in
[44:14] there that most people would have said
[44:15] probably not the best move. But through
[44:17] it all, there was leadership. By God's
[44:19] grace, by God's grace, there's
[44:21] leadership. And in the end, you see his
[44:23] hand and what he was doing at every step
[44:25] of the way. When you look back, he
[44:28] doesn't give us foresight.
[44:30] What does he give us? Faith.
[44:33] It's a walk of faith, not a walk of
[44:34] foresight. We're not prophets. We don't
[44:36] get to see everything. But if we can see
[44:38] what he's doing by the word and we can
[44:40] put it there, then we can say, "I've got
[44:41] faith that this is the right way to go."
[44:43] Amen. But the will of God is not the
[44:45] will of man. God's ways are higher. The
[44:47] scripture says his my ways are not your
[44:49] ways. My thoughts are higher than your
[44:50] ways. So you can't be stuck in your
[44:52] humanity with these things. Amen. To the
[44:54] to the human mind to be led of the
[44:56] spirit is off-putting. It's
[44:58] disconcerting. It's uncomfortable.
[45:01] Absolutely it is. Amen. It doesn't work
[45:03] with our human mind or logic. Brother B
[45:05] would say this. He says he said that he
[45:07] that believeth on me, the works that I
[45:08] do shall he also. He cannot change that
[45:11] decision. He said these signs shall
[45:13] follow them that believe. He says if the
[45:16] life of Christ be in you,
[45:19] if the mind of Christ, he says, then
[45:22] we're concerned and do the things of
[45:24] Christ. I want to ask you as we're
[45:26] getting into the last couple of services
[45:28] in this series, what concerns you today?
[45:31] What concerns you when you get up in the
[45:34] morning? Amen. What is your priority?
[45:36] What is it that's courarssing through
[45:37] your mind? What is it you're seeking?
[45:39] What are you pushing for? What is it
[45:41] that inspires you daily?
[45:44] Do you even have inspiration?
[45:48] That's a hard question. Do you have
[45:50] inspiration for your day? Amen. Remember
[45:52] we led read last service there scripture
[45:54] that says in him we live and move and
[45:57] have our being. That means we ought to
[45:59] have an inspiration day by day. It ought
[46:01] to be a Christ inspiration. Amen. What
[46:03] is it that concerns us daytoday? What is
[46:05] it that gets us out of bed? What is our
[46:07] purpose from God that we're trying to
[46:09] achieve on a daily basis? Church, this
[46:12] is where we're at. We're the hands and
[46:14] feet of Christ. That means we've got to
[46:17] be doing something every single day for
[46:19] him. Amen. That has nothing to do with
[46:22] age.
[46:24] We can't put that on brother Bob and
[46:26] Sister Brenda. Sister Brenda's not here
[46:28] tonight. She's homesick. God bless
[46:30] Sister Brenda. She's always faithful.
[46:33] Amen. Sister Moren, Brother Mark Bark,
[46:35] Brother Gerald, Sister B. We can't say,
[46:37] "Let's put that on them." They're the
[46:39] ones that know what they're doing. This
[46:41] is not about age. This is relationship.
[46:44] It's always about relationship. It's
[46:46] come down to relationship. Look at the
[46:48] the prophet Samuel, just the young man.
[46:51] And if he could open his heart and let
[46:53] God speak to him, what can he do today?
[46:56] We don't have to be prophets to have
[46:58] relationship with God. We don't have to
[47:00] be prophets to be placed into a purpose,
[47:02] a kingdom purpose in the things that we
[47:04] do. Amen. But a life surrendered leads
[47:06] to relationship with Christ. So whether
[47:09] it's our young people in school, whether
[47:10] it's our older people in school, whether
[47:13] it's high school, whether it's
[47:14] elementary, whether it's homeschool and
[47:16] working with the homeschool group,
[47:17] whether it's those that are in
[47:19] university or or or community college,
[47:21] whatever it might be, when you're there,
[47:23] you're not just there to get an
[47:24] education. You're there to show Christ
[47:28] when you're at work, brothers. Remember
[47:30] when we preached on adoption, he said he
[47:32] was looking for what? Adoptive mechanics
[47:36] and teachers and this one and that one.
[47:38] We are lights. We are cities on a hill
[47:40] that cannot be hid. We're the salt of
[47:42] the earth. And so when we're in these
[47:44] places, we've got to realize there's
[47:46] more to this than just me getting a a
[47:48] paycheck out of it. There's more to this
[47:50] than me having a career or putting food
[47:52] on the table. Amen. We have to have a
[47:54] kingdom purpose. is not just a money
[47:55] purpose or an education purpose. I said
[47:58] before how much I appreciated brother
[48:00] Joe's difference and his approach to
[48:02] education compared to me. And that's
[48:04] what I went in there and my goal was to
[48:07] get in and get out and have as little to
[48:08] do with people in there as possible. Now
[48:11] that guards me, but it doesn't make me
[48:13] much of a testimony generally speaking.
[48:16] But when he went in there, he held his
[48:18] standard, but he did not shy away from
[48:20] talking to people. And I believe he was
[48:22] able to be a witness that I couldn't be
[48:24] just because he wasn't scared to talk to
[48:26] people. Amen. I I mentioned last service
[48:29] how I bought a a used pair of skates for
[48:31] myself. My mine are about 25 years old
[48:33] and starting to fall apart. They used to
[48:36] know how to build skates.
[48:38] 25 years out of a pair of skates. That's
[48:40] pretty good. But I I I went there and I
[48:42] I reached out to the guy and and the ad
[48:45] said he was a he was a professional
[48:46] hockey player. And so when I got there,
[48:48] I just wanted it was later in the
[48:50] evening. My wife had gone with me. We're
[48:51] all the way out in Loi Bay. It was dark.
[48:53] It was rainy. We just wanted to get
[48:55] there and get home. But when I walked in
[48:56] and I went to put him on, he just
[48:58] started talking and he seemed to want to
[49:00] talk. So, we stayed there for about 15
[49:02] minutes just talking. But when I got
[49:04] back in the van, I I apologized to my
[49:06] wife. I said, "I didn't go in there
[49:08] meaning to stay long, but he just wanted
[49:10] to talk." And I said, when it happens
[49:12] then when those things happen, I said I
[49:14] just let it go
[49:16] because I don't know what's going to
[49:19] come out of that conversation, church.
[49:21] They may never see a Bible, but they may
[49:23] see me or you. And so that conversation
[49:26] might be the word revealed to them, and
[49:27] we don't know which direction it's going
[49:29] to take. And there's one thing I I know
[49:31] about professional uh athletes is that
[49:33] when they go out of their their
[49:35] competition, they usually have rough
[49:37] lives because they go from being a great
[49:40] person to being a nobody a lot of times.
[49:43] You know, if you're a Wayne Gretzky,
[49:44] everybody's always going to recognize
[49:46] you or or or whatever. But if you're
[49:48] just a run-of-the-mill pro, you walk
[49:50] down the street, nobody knows who you
[49:51] are 10 years later, much less 15 like
[49:53] this guy. And so I don't know where he's
[49:56] going with this. So I told her, I said,
[49:58] "I just when these days I'm I'm treating
[50:00] people differently, and I trust that
[50:02] it's the maturity that God is placing in
[50:04] my life as a pastor that I've got to be
[50:06] willing to let people talk and work with
[50:08] them and greet them and and meet them
[50:11] wherever they come to me, however it can
[50:13] come because I don't know when there's a
[50:16] I don't know who's the last seed. Let me
[50:17] put it that way. And it can be a pro
[50:19] hockey player. It can be a drunk on the
[50:21] road. It could be one of my colleagues
[50:23] or it could be one of my children. I
[50:25] don't know who it is." And so I said,
[50:27] "I'm sorry, but I just have to I I'm
[50:29] relaxing and allowing myself to just let
[50:32] God do something if he would want to do
[50:33] it." And you never know. You never know
[50:36] what you would say. So whether it's it's
[50:37] my mechanic, whether it's the guy doing
[50:39] the body work on my my car this week,
[50:41] whether it's my my my work colleagues,
[50:43] whether whoever it might be, I'm always
[50:46] putting just a little bit out there just
[50:48] to see if they respond
[50:50] because I'm trying to be about my
[50:51] kingdom purpose. Amen. We're the hands
[50:53] and feet of God, church. We're the body
[50:56] of Christ. We've got to be doing
[50:57] something for him. Remember we read that
[50:59] quote last service where brother Bam
[51:00] said, "God's got something in his mind
[51:02] that he's trying to do and it will
[51:04] behoove us to take a little time and
[51:06] pray and find out what the father is
[51:09] doing. Are we praying? Are we praying,
[51:13] Lord, would you have what would you have
[51:15] me to do today?" You know, I don't know
[51:17] what's going on in everyone's life, but
[51:18] I've appreciated my daughter. and she'll
[51:20] come back and she'll share what she
[51:22] shared at work that day with you know so
[51:25] and so who has a a family hardship or
[51:27] they have we prayed for pets
[51:31] church we're we're agnostic when it
[51:33] comes to prayer we'll pray for anybody
[51:36] you don't have to go to our church you
[51:39] just have to ask and we'll pray for you
[51:42] amen we prayed over all sorts of
[51:44] situations for things at her work and
[51:46] she lets them know they know that if she
[51:48] says she's going to pray she's going to
[51:49] pray she comes comes home and have
[51:50] family devotions. She says, "Hey, we
[51:52] need to pray about so and so or such and
[51:53] such." And we do. And we follow up on it
[51:55] until we get an answer. Amen. That's
[51:58] what we're supposed to be doing. And
[51:59] I'll say this, if I'm honest, I'm waking
[52:02] up differently these days. And I don't
[52:05] know if it's just me. Maybe maybe it is
[52:07] the Lord knows. Amen. But there's almost
[52:09] a nervousness at times because it seems
[52:11] like things are getting so tight. Things
[52:14] are winding down. And I'm saying, "Lord,
[52:16] what would you have me to do?
[52:20] Lord, why am I here today? What is the
[52:22] touch point for me, for somebody else,
[52:24] for your kingdom today?
[52:28] And that's a serious thought. That's a
[52:31] sobering thought. But what does it do?
[52:32] It sets an inspiration in my heart to do
[52:35] or say something for him that would make
[52:37] a difference in somebody's life
[52:38] eternally,
[52:40] whatever it might be. Amen.
[52:43] Remember what Jesus said? He said, "The
[52:44] harvest is ripe, but the laborers are
[52:46] few."
[52:47] Amen. Are we working for this guy or are
[52:51] we working for this guy?
[52:53] Amen. I know that's personal, but that's
[52:56] the life of a Christian when we come
[52:57] into spiritual maturity. Amen. Is that
[53:00] we're living for the kingdom purpose.
[53:02] Amen. That takes a a real commitment,
[53:04] church. That takes a heart desire to do
[53:08] something like that. Amen. It takes
[53:09] understanding the value of your
[53:11] relationship with Christ. And we're in
[53:13] the last times. And Jesus said, "You've
[53:15] got to continue what I've been doing.
[53:17] You're my hands and feet. You've got to
[53:19] continue because I'm going back to the
[53:21] father and you're going to get the same
[53:23] spirit and it's supposed to do the same
[53:25] things through you. It's the exact same
[53:27] thing that's supposed to happen. You
[53:28] say, "Brother John, what's my part? What
[53:31] do I do?" There's only one way to find
[53:33] it, and there's only one way to get it.
[53:36] He says, "I'm sure of this tonight. If
[53:38] you'd stand still long enough, don't get
[53:41] all frustrated. Stand still. God will
[53:44] reveal his design divine purpose to you.
[53:47] He says, "Get quiet and get still before
[53:51] him."
[53:52] I mean, I was talking to somebody the
[53:54] other day about our young sisters,
[53:57] not our young sisters, young sisters in
[53:59] general. Because I'll tell you what,
[54:01] these days it's tough to be a young
[54:03] person. It's tough to be a young man.
[54:04] It's tough to be a young sister. If we
[54:06] go back 30 years ago, every young sister
[54:09] was going to get married. That was
[54:10] pretty much guaranteed. That's what
[54:12] happened.
[54:13] But I'll tell you what, looking around
[54:14] today, not everybody's getting married.
[54:17] And not everyone's getting married at 21
[54:19] or 22 or 19 the way it used to be. Amen.
[54:23] And so what does it take? It takes a a a
[54:26] seeking of God to say, "Lord, what would
[54:28] you have me to do with my life until?"
[54:31] Amen. And it's like Jesus, some, you
[54:34] know, sometimes he healed them all,
[54:36] sometimes he healed one, sometimes he
[54:37] healed none. There are those that need
[54:38] to stay home, and that's God's
[54:41] leadership.
[54:42] There are those that need to go to
[54:44] school and be a witness because they
[54:48] might have something else in store for
[54:49] them. And there are those that need to
[54:50] go into the workforce
[54:53] to do something else there.
[54:56] That's between you and God. But don't
[54:58] assume it's one or the other.
[55:01] Prayerfully seek it. I wouldn't push any
[55:05] young woman into the workforce. My
[55:06] daughter works. But when we were seeking
[55:09] with her, we looked for something that
[55:12] would keep her away from everything
[55:14] brother Brandham warned us about.
[55:16] It put her in a place where she could be
[55:18] a Christian woman and not get into a
[55:21] place of authority. She shouldn't have
[55:23] responsibility. She shouldn't have
[55:25] relationships she shouldn't have and
[55:28] allow her to live a clean life without
[55:30] having to to compromise to do what she
[55:32] wants to do. Amen.
[55:36] prayerfully seek and not get frustrated.
[55:39] You know what happens when we get
[55:40] frustrated, church?
[55:42] We start using these. We take things
[55:45] into our own hands. That's exactly what
[55:47] we do. I'm I'm testifying that's what we
[55:50] do. We take things into our own hands.
[55:52] And we're not going to get into it
[55:53] tonight, but we'll get into it Sunday,
[55:55] Lord willing. That's when we fail is
[55:57] when we take things into these little
[55:58] grubby mits of ours. That's when we
[56:00] fail. That's the only thing Moses did
[56:03] wrong, church. He took things into his
[56:04] own hands.
[56:07] He took things into his own hands. God
[56:09] isn't in a hurry. We're the ones get
[56:11] frustrated. We're the ones that get
[56:12] frustrated. We're the ones get tired of
[56:14] waiting and we take things and put it
[56:16] into our own hands. I was listening to
[56:17] that service you told me about, Brother
[56:19] Mark Donnie Reagan, preaching there. And
[56:21] he was talking about Saul. And Saul lost
[56:24] his kingdom over not waiting about a
[56:27] half hour.
[56:28] That's it. A half hour. And he took
[56:32] things into his own hands and God ripped
[56:34] the kingdom out of his hands. Amen.
[56:36] Church, the scripture says Jesus said to
[56:39] the disciples, he says, "Go and wait in
[56:41] Jerusalem until you be endued with
[56:42] power." That's what the Holy Spirit is.
[56:45] It's power. Amen. And the the power over
[56:47] others wasn't what they needed. Power
[56:49] over self was what they needed. Power
[56:52] they needed was not over sickness and
[56:54] death and hell and the grave. Amen. But
[56:56] they needed to have victory over self so
[56:58] they could yield themselves so they
[57:00] could start doing the works of Christ.
[57:03] Not the signs and wonders, the works,
[57:06] which is the will of the father. I heard
[57:08] a preacher say earlier this week, he
[57:10] said, "Spiritual maturity is coming to
[57:13] the place where you rely only on God."
[57:17] And if that isn't the truth, I don't
[57:19] know what is. Spiritual maturity is when
[57:22] you come to the place where it's it's
[57:23] him or it's no one.
[57:26] because when our grubby little mitts get
[57:28] involved, it doesn't work out so well.
[57:30] It just doesn't work that way. I thought
[57:31] that was pretty good. But I want to show
[57:33] you the potential for the believer in
[57:35] this age tonight. I want to give you an
[57:37] encouraging service, and I hope it'll
[57:38] inspire you over this these last few
[57:41] services we're preaching on the Holy
[57:42] Ghost. I want you to see there's more.
[57:45] There's not more of me. There's more for
[57:47] me. Amen. And that comes by giving
[57:50] myself away, by pouring myself out. And
[57:53] when I pour myself out, then he can pour
[57:55] himself in. And that's when we can start
[57:58] to see a greater reality of God. Amen.
[58:00] We're talking about bride potential
[58:02] tonight. If I was to have a a subtitle
[58:04] or a sub subtitle, it would be bride
[58:06] potential. Amen. I want us to see a
[58:08] greater reality of God in our lives.
[58:10] Amen. I don't I don't think the rapture
[58:13] is going to take us by surprise, church.
[58:15] I believe it'll be a slow progression of
[58:17] the reality of God in our lives. And I
[58:19] want to be a part of that. Brother says,
[58:21] "The works that I do shall you do also,
[58:23] not another work." But God wants to
[58:26] bring the Holy Ghost in you to continue
[58:28] the same work that he was doing in
[58:30] Christ. He says, "The work wasn't so
[58:33] needy in the days of Luther. That was
[58:35] God's church. A little bit more needy in
[58:37] the days of Wesley because the world,
[58:39] the Bible said, would get weaker and
[58:41] wiser and more wicked all the time." The
[58:43] world is getting more wicked. We know
[58:45] that. why men do things today that a
[58:47] hundred years ago you wouldn't have
[58:48] thought there'd have been a human being
[58:49] that cruel. That's absolutely the truth.
[58:52] He says so the Holy Spirit has been
[58:55] moving. There was just a little breath
[58:57] of it with Luther, a little blow of it
[58:59] with Wesley and a deeper blow of it with
[59:01] the Pentecostals. He says now the breath
[59:04] and the spirit have become the same
[59:07] church. What he's saying is it's no
[59:09] longer a movement. It's a person.
[59:12] Do you understand what I'm saying? It's
[59:14] not winds blowing. It's the spirit
[59:16] coming itself. Amen. He says she is
[59:19] uniting together bringing forth the same
[59:23] powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he
[59:25] did back there is manifesting the same
[59:28] works that he did back there is being
[59:30] manifested right today. The exact he
[59:34] says it's the same thing. That's the
[59:35] potential for the bride of Christ in
[59:37] this age church. I say Lord let that be
[59:39] me where there's a unifying of him and
[59:42] me. There's a unifying of us together.
[59:44] Look, this is a body work, not an
[59:47] individual work. Can I say it that way?
[59:50] This is a body work. We've got to be in
[59:52] unity for God to really use us. That's
[59:56] the way that God does it. See what says
[59:58] there? He says, "She is uniting
[1:00:00] together.
[1:00:02] We've got to come together before he
[1:00:05] comes together with us because a kingdom
[1:00:08] divided against itself can't stand." So
[1:00:10] the the working of the spirit is to
[1:00:13] unify us together. We've got to be
[1:00:14] united under the same headship, Christ.
[1:00:18] We've got to be united under the word.
[1:00:20] Amen. Not just under social desires or a
[1:00:23] need for community or or a place to hang
[1:00:25] out with people. Amen. We've got to see
[1:00:28] our individual place.
[1:00:30] And we've got to be okay with that
[1:00:32] place.
[1:00:34] We've got to be content with what God
[1:00:36] has for us and be okay when somebody
[1:00:39] else has a different way, a different
[1:00:41] place, a different purpose, a different
[1:00:43] gift.
[1:00:45] Why are we okay with it? Because it's
[1:00:47] not my place. It's up to them. It's up
[1:00:49] to them and God. Amen. Church, our body
[1:00:52] works best when it's healthy, when it's
[1:00:55] connected,
[1:00:56] and working together.
[1:00:59] Anybody ever see an arm that was
[1:01:00] separated from the body that was working
[1:01:02] well?
[1:01:03] anyone?
[1:01:05] Me either.
[1:01:07] But yet, that's what we have too many
[1:01:09] times is people that'll say, "Well, I'm
[1:01:11] just going to go do this." And it's
[1:01:14] their own agenda. It's their own way.
[1:01:16] It's their own thinking. And it causes
[1:01:18] separation rather than unity. If it's
[1:01:22] the spirit of God working in us, it will
[1:01:24] unite us because there's only one way to
[1:01:25] get into the body of Christ, and that's
[1:01:27] by the Holy Ghost. So the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:29] a unifier, a joiner, not a separator of
[1:01:33] the body. That's the way that the Holy
[1:01:35] Spirit works. Amen. So when we're if our
[1:01:37] body works best when it's healthy,
[1:01:39] connected, and working together, then
[1:01:42] guess what? The body of Christ is best
[1:01:43] when it's healthy, connected, and
[1:01:46] working together as well. Listen, I can
[1:01:48] I can place this down here, and I can
[1:01:51] probably get this up somehow with my
[1:01:53] feet if I really want to, but it's a
[1:01:54] whole lot easier if I just reach down
[1:01:56] with my hand, isn't it? But the problem
[1:01:58] is some of us are hands and feet hands
[1:02:01] and we want to be feet or we're feet and
[1:02:02] we want to be hands.
[1:02:05] Brother Matt will know about this.
[1:02:07] There's sometimes when you don't have
[1:02:08] the right tool and what do you do,
[1:02:11] brother Matt?
[1:02:13] You make No, you don't. He does. You
[1:02:16] improvise. You use the wrong tool.
[1:02:21] And what you hope is the wrong tool
[1:02:23] works the one time you need it on this
[1:02:26] one thing.
[1:02:28] And when that breaks, then you go build
[1:02:30] another one. That's what brother Matt
[1:02:31] does. We're not brother Matt. Amen.
[1:02:33] We're not brother Matt.
[1:02:37] But for most of us mere mortals, when we
[1:02:40] don't have the right tool, what do we
[1:02:41] do? We go and we try and juryrig
[1:02:43] something together. And it might work,
[1:02:46] but it never works as well as the right
[1:02:48] tool. That's for sure. That's for sure.
[1:02:51] Amen. And so many times that's the
[1:02:53] problem is people want to be something
[1:02:56] other than what they are. They want to
[1:02:58] be in a position other than what God has
[1:03:00] for them. And so they're discontent in
[1:03:03] the position they're in because they're
[1:03:05] putting themselves there. And they're
[1:03:07] discontented
[1:03:09] because they're not where they ought to
[1:03:10] be. They they're not satisfied in any
[1:03:12] place. But because they want to be here,
[1:03:14] they'll keep pushing.
[1:03:18] But we got to find where he wants us and
[1:03:21] sit there and be content. And I'll tell
[1:03:24] you this, when you find your place and
[1:03:27] stay there, his yoke is easy and his
[1:03:32] burden is light. Because you're not
[1:03:35] doing it, he's doing it. You're not
[1:03:38] forcing it. He's blessing it. Amen.
[1:03:41] That's the way God works. That's the way
[1:03:43] God works. I'm not sure why I'm here.
[1:03:45] This was sort of in my notes, but but
[1:03:48] we'll just trust the Lord on it. Amen.
[1:03:50] But the problem so many times is we want
[1:03:52] to be something what we're not. And by
[1:03:54] that I mean we want to be something that
[1:03:56] God hasn't called us to be. You know, we
[1:03:59] all want to be um listen, as as a young
[1:04:02] woman,
[1:04:04] I think most most young women would love
[1:04:06] it if a if a young man came over from
[1:04:08] the other side of the room, you know, at
[1:04:10] a youth camp and said, "You know what?
[1:04:13] When I walked into this camp, you're the
[1:04:16] only one I saw. You just stood out. Your
[1:04:20] grace, your long hair, your beauty,
[1:04:25] your modesty, everything about you is
[1:04:28] perfect. And I just wanted to tell you
[1:04:29] that you above all else at this camp are
[1:04:32] the greatest young woman here.
[1:04:34] We would love that. We would love it if
[1:04:37] we had the perfect form, the perfect
[1:04:39] clothes, the perfect nose, perfect hair,
[1:04:42] perfect complexion, perfect shoes,
[1:04:45] the whole package. Amen. But remember
[1:04:48] what Paul said about the body. He said
[1:04:51] the parts that are seem that seem more
[1:04:55] feeble are the more necessary ones.
[1:04:58] You know what? You know, people walk up
[1:05:01] to brother Paul on a regular basis and
[1:05:02] say, "You know what? that physique. Wow.
[1:05:06] They do it all the time.
[1:05:10] But you know what people don't do,
[1:05:11] Sister Amber? They don't walk up and
[1:05:14] say, "My, what a beautiful heart you
[1:05:16] have." Boy, you really work that heart
[1:05:18] out, do they?
[1:05:21] But let me tell you that perfect form
[1:05:24] that brother Paul has, he can still
[1:05:26] function if he was ugly. But take away
[1:05:29] his heart and see how well he does.
[1:05:32] See, remember what Paul said? He said,
[1:05:35] "The things that are least comely, God
[1:05:39] has given greater importance."
[1:05:42] Amen. Those that are unrecognized
[1:05:45] are often the most critical.
[1:05:48] Amen.
[1:05:50] Church, we're not working for men's
[1:05:52] accolades. Can I say that? What we're
[1:05:55] working for is eternal treasure.
[1:05:59] And that comes from finding our place
[1:06:02] and staying there and say, "Lord, let
[1:06:05] you bless it because I'm doing your
[1:06:07] will, not mine." Amen.
[1:06:11] I'll tell you this. People may not come
[1:06:13] up and say, "You've got a beautiful
[1:06:14] heart pumping in there." But I'll tell
[1:06:17] you this, go without your heart a day.
[1:06:19] Go without your liver a day. You'll die
[1:06:22] real fast.
[1:06:24] It's the critical things. Listen to what
[1:06:26] Paul said. This is in the amplified. I
[1:06:27] thought it was a little better this way.
[1:06:29] He says, "But God has so adjusted. He's
[1:06:31] mingled, harmonized, and subtly
[1:06:34] proportioned the parts of the whole
[1:06:36] body, giving the greater honor and
[1:06:38] richer endowment to the inferior parts
[1:06:42] which lack apparent importance.
[1:06:45] See, we assign all of the all of the
[1:06:48] importance to the visible things."
[1:06:50] Remember brother talks about a woman and
[1:06:53] he says her prayers were the reason for
[1:06:56] the success of a set of meetings. One
[1:07:00] woman that was praying on her knees in
[1:07:02] her closet. He said she was the reason
[1:07:05] the meetings were successful.
[1:07:07] One woman.
[1:07:09] Everyone will give all the credit to
[1:07:11] brother Brandham. Brother Brham says it
[1:07:13] was this woman that had a burden on her
[1:07:14] heart that made this happen. This is
[1:07:17] what Paul's saying. See, we assign
[1:07:19] importance, but there's what we see and
[1:07:21] there's what God sees.
[1:07:24] Why does God do it this way? He says,
[1:07:25] "So that there should be no division or
[1:07:28] discord or lack of adaptation of the
[1:07:31] parts of the body to each other." See,
[1:07:34] we can say, "Well, well, brother so and
[1:07:36] so or sister so and so, they don't
[1:07:38] really do much. Let's just let them go.
[1:07:41] They can do whatever they want. They can
[1:07:43] come. They can go, you know, whatever.
[1:07:45] We'll just slot them in." No, we can't
[1:07:48] do that. We adapt to all of the parts of
[1:07:51] the body. We make them all welcome. We
[1:07:53] pull them all in. That's what we're
[1:07:55] supposed to be doing. Why? But the
[1:07:58] members are but the members all alike
[1:08:01] should have a mutual interest in and
[1:08:03] care for one another. In other words,
[1:08:06] God's not coming for a bride that's all
[1:08:08] about looks.
[1:08:10] It's not about who looks the best or or
[1:08:12] or who has the best figure or these
[1:08:13] things, but what he's coming for is a
[1:08:15] bride that's in unity and a bride that's
[1:08:17] in balance. That's what he's coming for.
[1:08:20] Amen. And so in these things, she won't
[1:08:22] be like so many today. And you have to
[1:08:25] laugh. I was speaking with my wife about
[1:08:27] the things that women do to themselves
[1:08:29] these days. And you know, I've got a
[1:08:31] niece or a cousin
[1:08:35] and her eyelashes are about yay long.
[1:08:37] When she flaps, you feel a breeze. When
[1:08:39] she blinks.
[1:08:41] Who told you that looked good?
[1:08:44] It It looks inc It looks insane.
[1:08:51] I saw I saw a video.
[1:08:54] God forgive me. I saw a video of a of a
[1:08:58] a young girl that had those same kind of
[1:09:00] lashes sitting on a speedboat and her
[1:09:04] her eyes were going
[1:09:07] cuz they were so long and the boat was
[1:09:09] going so fast. She couldn't control her
[1:09:11] own eyelashes because the lift from the
[1:09:13] speed of the boat, the wind passing over
[1:09:15] it caused her eyelids to flutter
[1:09:17] uncontrollably.
[1:09:19] Church, you've gone too far.
[1:09:22] Don't go that far.
[1:09:25] But every woman today in this world
[1:09:27] seems like they want to push out or push
[1:09:30] in every part of their body. Thin them
[1:09:34] out here, push them out there. curves
[1:09:36] here, flat there. Everything's about
[1:09:38] putting on a show. Everything's about
[1:09:40] hiding the reality of who and what they
[1:09:42] are. That's not who God's coming for in
[1:09:44] a bride. Amen. He's coming for a bride
[1:09:47] that is dressed in his clothes, his
[1:09:50] righteousness, that is pure,
[1:09:53] unreprovable, unblameable, without
[1:09:56] wrinkle, spotless,
[1:09:58] modest imbalance.
[1:10:01] He's not coming for a Dolly Parton.
[1:10:05] Okay, that's not what he's coming for.
[1:10:07] He's coming for a bride that glows with
[1:10:11] the humility of the gospel. Amen. That
[1:10:15] does not look out there to affirm or
[1:10:18] confirm her beauty.
[1:10:22] We'll be touching on this in the next
[1:10:24] series, but I want to give you this one
[1:10:26] thing. People ask, "Is it wrong to do
[1:10:28] thus and that?" I say, "That's the wrong
[1:10:31] question." I say, "What is it that's
[1:10:33] causing you to even add it in the first
[1:10:35] place?"
[1:10:37] Because there's only two influences.
[1:10:38] It's not about right or wrong. Paul
[1:10:40] said, "There's nothing wrong in and of
[1:10:42] itself unless it's strictly forbidden by
[1:10:44] the word." But what influence is it?
[1:10:46] Because he says, "I won't allow it to
[1:10:47] have power over me." That shows there's
[1:10:50] an influence. There's a power behind
[1:10:52] everything that's coming into our lives
[1:10:54] that's being offered to us to take into
[1:10:56] our lives, I should say. Amen. of this
[1:10:59] this bride that Christ is coming for is
[1:11:01] one that is focused on pleasing one
[1:11:02] person and one alone and that's him.
[1:11:04] That's him and she'll stand alone when
[1:11:06] she does that. Brother Abraham says when
[1:11:08] God made the covenant with Christ,
[1:11:10] Christ made it with the church and the
[1:11:11] same Holy Ghost was on Christ will have
[1:11:13] to be in the church or it won't go in
[1:11:15] the rapture.
[1:11:17] He says he doesn't have a freak body.
[1:11:19] There won't be one piece of it hanging
[1:11:21] this way and one hanging that way.
[1:11:23] Called Methodist, one Baptist, one
[1:11:24] Presbyterian, one Pentecostal, one
[1:11:27] message.
[1:11:31] If we're going for titles, we might as
[1:11:32] well add our own in there. It's not a
[1:11:34] message church that's going. It's a
[1:11:36] bride that's going. Not all that say
[1:11:38] Lord, Lord. Not all that say William
[1:11:40] Brandon, William Brown, not all that say
[1:11:41] message.
[1:11:43] Amen. by the souls that have received
[1:11:44] him. He says it'll be it'll all be the
[1:11:48] Holy Ghost that was in Christ Jesus will
[1:11:50] be in the church. In other words, it
[1:11:52] won't be conglomerated because he's
[1:11:54] talking about groups here. That's what
[1:11:56] he's talking about. Okay? What are our
[1:11:58] groups today? And I'm sorry to say we
[1:11:59] have it. We have groups gathered around
[1:12:01] brother so and so, around this gift,
[1:12:03] around this ministry, around this style
[1:12:05] of preaching, this style of teaching.
[1:12:09] I'm sorry to say it, but it's in the
[1:12:11] ranks, church. It's been a long time.
[1:12:13] It's been a long time, hasn't it,
[1:12:15] Brother Gerald? Absolutely, it has.
[1:12:19] But I believe God is leveling the field.
[1:12:23] I believe that God is making changes
[1:12:25] where he's taking the big eyes away. And
[1:12:28] what is the purpose? We must decrease so
[1:12:32] that he can increase. That's what he's
[1:12:35] looking to do. Amen. And as he
[1:12:37] increases, it'll be because we have
[1:12:39] humbled ourselves before him rather than
[1:12:42] raised ourselves up before the people.
[1:12:45] Amen. He says it'll rapture it and it'll
[1:12:48] go right straight to its place and God's
[1:12:50] covenant people will go in go in in the
[1:12:53] rapture. He says, "Hallelujah."
[1:12:56] Church, what needs to happen? We've got
[1:12:58] to get in position.
[1:13:00] Amen. Not what I want.
[1:13:03] Clearly not what I want, not what you
[1:13:07] want either. Amen. But what God has for
[1:13:10] ordained for us, not what you prefer,
[1:13:12] not what we prefer for ourselves. Amen.
[1:13:14] But we've got to get to the position
[1:13:15] where God has called us and remain there
[1:13:18] and be content and at peace there. And
[1:13:20] that takes prayer. That takes prayer.
[1:13:22] And once you've got your answer, that
[1:13:24] takes commitment. Because guess what?
[1:13:27] Not everybody's going to have a
[1:13:28] revelation of your position.
[1:13:31] Can't you say that? Amen to that,
[1:13:32] brother Bob. Not everyone's going to
[1:13:34] have a revelation of your position,
[1:13:37] but that doesn't change a thing. Jesus
[1:13:41] had critics. Guess what? We're going to
[1:13:42] have critics, too.
[1:13:44] Because some of us have to mature and
[1:13:46] recognize God uses other people.
[1:13:49] And he uses them in different ways than
[1:13:51] we do. That takes commitment. That takes
[1:13:53] being willing to be molded and shaped
[1:13:55] and prepared so that you can fit into
[1:13:57] the body of Christ. And that takes the
[1:13:59] Holy Spirit. I've said it before so many
[1:14:01] times. What makes us one is not that
[1:14:03] we're all on common ground,
[1:14:07] church. The the Christianity preaches
[1:14:10] out of this. This is supposed to be
[1:14:11] common ground. And do we all get along?
[1:14:14] Nope. Not at all. So, it's not about
[1:14:18] common ground that's going to hold us.
[1:14:19] Amen. But what gets us along? What keeps
[1:14:22] us together? There's only one thing,
[1:14:24] church. The Holy Ghost. The reason I get
[1:14:27] along with brother Matt is the Holy
[1:14:29] Ghost. That's it. The reason I get along
[1:14:32] brother Mark is the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:14:34] it. And everyone in between. I went to
[1:14:36] two extremes there of the church.
[1:14:40] That's the reason we get along is
[1:14:42] because they've got the same spirit and
[1:14:45] we're in the same body. And therefore,
[1:14:47] we have to get along. Amen. It's the
[1:14:50] only way to get into it is by the Holy
[1:14:51] Ghost. He's the one that makes us get
[1:14:53] along. He's the one that gets us to our
[1:14:54] place. He's the one that gives us
[1:14:56] contentment. He's the one that helps us
[1:14:57] find purpose, his purpose in our life.
[1:15:01] Brother Van puts it this way. He says,
[1:15:02] "Now today, you see, faith is designed
[1:15:04] to do this. The same faith today should
[1:15:06] see the same thing. A faith of the
[1:15:08] church today should see the same program
[1:15:12] of God."
[1:15:13] He says, "I want you to don't miss this.
[1:15:16] Now, the church today that's called of
[1:15:17] God will certainly see the program of
[1:15:20] God because the program of God is
[1:15:22] written out here." And he's pointing to
[1:15:23] his Bible. He says the blueprint and the
[1:15:25] Holy Spirit by faith is the one who
[1:15:28] reads it and sets it together. How do we
[1:15:31] know the program of God?
[1:15:34] He sends us a message. He reveals his
[1:15:36] word to us. Amen. But there's a focus in
[1:15:39] the word that God reveals to us. And
[1:15:41] when we recognize that message, what do
[1:15:43] we become?
[1:15:46] Remember Christ is revealed in the final
[1:15:48] age as the amen. Remember that when you
[1:15:51] look in Revelations 3, he says, he says
[1:15:54] he's the amen, the the beginning and the
[1:15:56] end in these different things. Amen. And
[1:15:58] so the amen is not just the speaker, but
[1:16:00] it's the receiver.
[1:16:02] It's not just the giver, but it's the
[1:16:04] manifesttor. It's Christ being revealed
[1:16:07] from what he said he do to what he is
[1:16:09] doing. Amen. And so it's a manifestation
[1:16:13] of the word of Christ and it's in his
[1:16:15] bride which is his final work. Amen. So
[1:16:18] what is it that what happens when we
[1:16:20] receive the message? We become the amen
[1:16:22] people. That's what happens. We become
[1:16:25] the so beets. We become the truly truly
[1:16:27] the verily verily. We become the proof
[1:16:30] of the word. That's what's happening in
[1:16:32] this age. Amen. There's a people that
[1:16:34] will receive what God has sent us. We'll
[1:16:36] believe it. We'll apply it and we'll
[1:16:38] have faith in it until he does exactly
[1:16:40] what he said he was going to do, which
[1:16:41] is a resurrection and a rapture. That's
[1:16:43] what we get that nobody else does. Amen.
[1:16:46] When the word of God went out, church,
[1:16:48] because it is the amen, there is
[1:16:50] automatically a people that have to
[1:16:52] receive it because God's word won't
[1:16:55] return to a void. It always goes out
[1:16:56] with purpose. Amen. And so God's word is
[1:16:59] the driver for all the things that we
[1:17:00] see happening. When the Bible says, "By
[1:17:02] his stripes, we are healed." The amen of
[1:17:04] that is there's somebody that's got to
[1:17:05] be healed.
[1:17:07] We're the amen. You see that? When he
[1:17:09] goes and he says, "He has sent me to
[1:17:11] bind up the brokenhearted." Guess what?
[1:17:12] There's a brokenhearted person here for
[1:17:14] him to bind up. worthy amen of that
[1:17:16] scripture. Amen. When he says, "We shall
[1:17:18] not all sleep, but we shall all be
[1:17:20] changed." Guess what? There's an amen.
[1:17:22] People that say, "That's me." And they
[1:17:25] don't just say it, but they become it.
[1:17:27] They are it. They go in a resurrection.
[1:17:29] They will go in a rapture. They will
[1:17:31] fulfill that scripture. We can look at
[1:17:33] God's word all through history, and we
[1:17:35] can see where he gave it. And then we
[1:17:37] can see where he fulfilled it. And who
[1:17:40] does he fulfill it in? People. It's a
[1:17:43] person. It's always a person. It's the
[1:17:46] Amen people. Amen. And God has spread
[1:17:48] the fulfillment of his word all over
[1:17:50] time. And and in these last 2,000 years,
[1:17:52] that that that group is a bride of
[1:17:54] people prepared, the true church. And
[1:17:56] they're there to receive it, to apply
[1:17:59] it, to believe it, to manifest it, to
[1:18:01] prove it, to show it to the world. Amen.
[1:18:03] We're the evidence of the word today.
[1:18:06] That's what you are. Whether you you you
[1:18:08] recognize that or not. Abraham says God
[1:18:11] allotted his word out to each age. And
[1:18:13] each one of those ages has to manifest
[1:18:15] that. He says, "And he also fore
[1:18:18] ordained men for that age to fulfill
[1:18:20] that word." Every time he allotted his
[1:18:22] word, he allotted a man for it. When he
[1:18:24] allotted Moses time, he allotted Moses
[1:18:26] to it. When he allowed the time for the
[1:18:28] son of God to be born, he allotted him
[1:18:29] to it. Every age he's allotted his man
[1:18:32] for ordained as the Bible said.
[1:18:36] Now, we can look at that and we can put
[1:18:38] that on prophets and ministry and these
[1:18:39] different things. But watch, he's
[1:18:41] preaching on the rapture here. I don't
[1:18:43] know if you noticed, but it's not only
[1:18:44] prophets go on the rapture. It's a
[1:18:47] people. It's a body that's going to go.
[1:18:49] It's the body bride of Christ. He says,
[1:18:51] "And the portion of his word that's
[1:18:53] allotted for this day, his Holy Spirit
[1:18:55] is here to manifest that portion of the
[1:18:59] word." That's why it's so important to
[1:19:01] know your day and its message because
[1:19:04] that's what you're supposed to produce.
[1:19:05] That's what you're supposed to fulfill.
[1:19:07] We preach the same gospel as Paul
[1:19:09] preached, but he was only fulfilling one
[1:19:12] portion of it. There are portions he
[1:19:14] fulfills and we fulfill, but there are
[1:19:16] portions that only he could fulfill. And
[1:19:18] there are portions that only we could
[1:19:20] fulfill. They fulfill the resurrection.
[1:19:23] Guess what we do? We fulfill the
[1:19:24] rapture. And no matter how much Paul
[1:19:27] believed, he can't fulfill the rapture.
[1:19:30] Only we can because he's dead and gone
[1:19:32] on to the other side. Amen. They
[1:19:33] overcame the air age and its challenges.
[1:19:35] And most of them paid it for it with
[1:19:37] their lives. We overcome our age. We've
[1:19:39] got a price to pay that's different than
[1:19:41] theirs. It's the same word, but they
[1:19:43] have something for them and we have
[1:19:44] something for us. We have different
[1:19:46] instructions even in this age because
[1:19:48] the challenges are different. Amen.
[1:19:51] Their problem was they'd left their
[1:19:53] first love. Not in Paul's day after Paul
[1:19:56] went on. Those people, what happened?
[1:19:58] They left their first love and their
[1:19:59] challenge was to reverse it by coming
[1:20:01] back to Christ the word and letting the
[1:20:03] Holy Spirit take over the church again.
[1:20:05] And some people heard it and received it
[1:20:08] and they did it and they were
[1:20:09] overcomers. Amen. The problem we have
[1:20:11] today is that people think they're
[1:20:13] Christians and they're not. They're just
[1:20:14] religious.
[1:20:16] And the challenge is to receive the
[1:20:19] correction of the word, of the full
[1:20:21] word, and actually receive Christ.
[1:20:24] That's the challenge. The problem is you
[1:20:25] think you've got it all. The challenge
[1:20:27] is to recognize you don't and actually
[1:20:29] come into Christ. Amen. people that are
[1:20:31] so convinced they're Christian, but
[1:20:33] they're just religious actors. That's
[1:20:35] really what people are today in this
[1:20:37] Christian world. Unfortunately, church,
[1:20:39] we live in the most deceiving age of
[1:20:40] all. Satan's had 6,000 years of practice
[1:20:44] to bring him up to here. Amen. And we're
[1:20:47] in the most subtle of ages where where
[1:20:49] Satan's got so many avenues to get into
[1:20:52] our lives, it seems. Remember what the
[1:20:53] what the scripture says that it would
[1:20:55] that that all no flesh would be saved
[1:20:58] except he cut time short.
[1:21:05] But out of this impossible age,
[1:21:08] out of this fallen age, out of the most
[1:21:10] subtle of all ages where even brother
[1:21:12] Brown would say that this this the two
[1:21:14] spirits working within the framework of
[1:21:16] the church are so close that they would
[1:21:18] deceive the very elected if it were
[1:21:20] possible. out of that comes one thing,
[1:21:22] an amen bride.
[1:21:25] That through it all, she says, "I'll
[1:21:27] believe it." And God is drawing a bride
[1:21:29] out in a supernatural way. Church,
[1:21:32] you're sitting here supernaturally this
[1:21:34] evening. It may not seem like it may
[1:21:36] seem like you're here cuz mom and dad go
[1:21:38] to church. It may seem like this is just
[1:21:40] what we do, but there's a supernatural
[1:21:43] event that's going on, and it's the
[1:21:44] preparation of a bride for a rapture
[1:21:47] tonight. That's what's going on when we
[1:21:49] come here. my that's why I don't
[1:21:51] understand when people miss church. It's
[1:21:52] because they don't understand what's
[1:21:54] happening.
[1:21:56] That's what's going on. It's not just
[1:21:57] here. It's at home in your devotions and
[1:21:59] these things. But let me tell you, it's
[1:22:01] special when you come together with
[1:22:02] believers.
[1:22:04] Amen. You're strengthened with
[1:22:05] believers. The anointing is more
[1:22:07] powerful with the believers. The
[1:22:09] encouragement you get from the
[1:22:10] believers, the fellowship, it keeps us
[1:22:12] together. It keeps us as a body. Amen.
[1:22:16] because we only get a a half a day at
[1:22:18] best every every week and the other six
[1:22:20] and a half days we're out here and we're
[1:22:21] there and we're working and and making a
[1:22:23] living and and trying to live. But we
[1:22:26] come in here and it's a time for the
[1:22:28] body to get together and help heal and
[1:22:30] and join itself together. Amen.
[1:22:34] It's the most subtle of times, but God's
[1:22:36] still doing something and he'll take us
[1:22:38] through. He says he deals with the
[1:22:39] church as individuals, each individual
[1:22:42] in the church. And now it's gotten out
[1:22:44] of time. And he says, "And it's no
[1:22:45] secret. We all see it. When a man is
[1:22:47] proven and God loves him, he takes him
[1:22:49] out somewhere to himself there in front
[1:22:51] of the angels. He does something for
[1:22:52] him. He lifts him up there in the
[1:22:54] presence of God and gifts him and fills
[1:22:56] him and sets him out." That's the age
[1:22:58] we're living in, church. I'm preaching
[1:22:59] about bride potential tonight. You say,
[1:23:01] "I don't have that yet, Brother John."
[1:23:03] I'm showing you potential.
[1:23:05] I'm showing you potential. Listen,
[1:23:08] Brother Gerald didn't get where he is
[1:23:09] overnight, as far as I know.
[1:23:13] Amen. Our elders didn't get where they
[1:23:15] were going overnight,
[1:23:18] but they got there. They got there. And
[1:23:20] that's what I want you to see. There's
[1:23:22] potential. Amen. This is it. He said,
[1:23:25] "The same Holy Spirit that saved the
[1:23:27] Lutheran, that sanctified the
[1:23:29] Methodists, that baptized the
[1:23:30] Pentecostals, is now setting in order
[1:23:32] the coming of the Lord Jesus." He says
[1:23:35] when it'll be so powerful that body will
[1:23:38] come into this group a church that'll
[1:23:41] draw the rest of them from the grave
[1:23:44] that he would draw together in crawl
[1:23:47] that are one in Christ both in heaven
[1:23:49] and in earth both above and below all of
[1:23:52] them have to join together he says
[1:23:54] there'll be a resurrection that's what
[1:23:56] the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy
[1:23:58] Ghost without us they cannot be made
[1:24:01] perfect church if they can't be made
[1:24:03] perfect without those that gone apart
[1:24:05] and have gone by way of the grave. How
[1:24:07] much more can we not be perfect unless
[1:24:09] we're together as a body?
[1:24:11] That's why Paul said, "Forsake not the
[1:24:13] assembling of yourselves together." All
[1:24:15] the more as you see the day approaching
[1:24:16] because it's a gathering time. It's a
[1:24:19] unifying time under Christ the word by
[1:24:22] the power of the Holy Spirit. You can't
[1:24:24] be gathered together and unified if
[1:24:26] you're not present. It doesn't work that
[1:24:28] way.
[1:24:30] It doesn't work that way. He says they
[1:24:32] lived in one day under that. We live in
[1:24:34] another day. He said when the enemy
[1:24:36] comes in like a flood, the spirit of God
[1:24:38] will raise up a standard against it. See
[1:24:40] now when we need it, when we need it,
[1:24:44] the spirit of God raises a standard. He
[1:24:46] says, "What is it?" He is pouring in his
[1:24:49] spirit. I say, "Lord, pour in your
[1:24:51] spirit tonight. Lord, I need more of
[1:24:53] your spirit tonight." Why? Because the
[1:24:55] enemy is raising their standards. And
[1:24:57] there's got to be somebody to meet the
[1:24:58] challenge. and not just meet the
[1:25:00] challenge, but overcome the challenge.
[1:25:02] Amen. He's looking for overcomers in
[1:25:04] this age. He says, "Then those who are
[1:25:06] resting out yonder in the grave or under
[1:25:08] the altar of God, as the scripture says,
[1:25:10] are crying, "How long, Lord? How long?
[1:25:13] How much longer?" He says, "God is
[1:25:15] waiting on me and you."
[1:25:18] The church is waiting on me and you. He
[1:25:21] says, "Adoption time." What is adoption
[1:25:25] time? How are you ready for adoption?
[1:25:27] for placing as a son or daughter of God.
[1:25:30] When the tutor comes and says, "He talks
[1:25:32] like you, she walks like you, he thinks
[1:25:35] like you, she reacts like you, she is
[1:25:38] you all over again." That's what he's
[1:25:42] looking for. Adoption time when God can
[1:25:45] pour into us his fullness, his power,
[1:25:49] his resurrection. He says that when the
[1:25:52] church and Christ become so close
[1:25:55] together till Christ becomes visible
[1:25:58] among us and raises the dead and we go
[1:26:01] into the rapture. I say Lord help me be
[1:26:03] a part of that.
[1:26:05] Oh my. We're talking about bride
[1:26:07] potential tonight church that Christ and
[1:26:10] you could be so close that he is visible
[1:26:12] in our midst and it causes the
[1:26:14] resurrection to happen. Hallelujah. What
[1:26:18] a position he's offered us. Look, this
[1:26:20] is a look at the message here. What was
[1:26:22] the Holy Ghost given for? What's it
[1:26:24] given for? It's to raise the dead and
[1:26:26] take us in a rapture. That's the
[1:26:28] ultimate goal. Get us out of here and
[1:26:30] get us back to where we came from. But
[1:26:33] it's got to be a people that wants to go
[1:26:35] and a people that's ready to go and a
[1:26:37] people that's calling to go and a people
[1:26:39] that's laying down so they can get out
[1:26:41] of here. That's who he's coming for,
[1:26:43] church. Paul said in Romans, he said,
[1:26:45] "But if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:26:48] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[1:26:50] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:26:52] shall,"
[1:26:54] that's a guarantee. He shall quicken
[1:26:58] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:27:00] spirit that dwelleth in you. That's the
[1:27:02] ultimate purpose of the Holy Spirit. Get
[1:27:04] us out of here.
[1:27:06] But to do that, church, he's got to do a
[1:27:08] work on the inside. And that's why we're
[1:27:11] here. That's why we're stuck here for a
[1:27:13] while because we can't have another Adam
[1:27:15] and Eve all over again. We can't have
[1:27:17] that. We can't have that. Amen. The Holy
[1:27:19] Spirit has to do a work in our souls to
[1:27:21] get us ready for eternity. Brother Ram
[1:27:24] says God's everlasting eternal token.
[1:27:28] It's eternal life by eternal go by the
[1:27:31] eternal God. Anything that had a
[1:27:33] beginning has an end. And everything
[1:27:35] that had a beginning and everything had
[1:27:37] a beginning besides God. He says God's
[1:27:39] the only form of eternal life there is.
[1:27:41] And when God places his Holy Spirit in
[1:27:43] you, which is God. And when God places
[1:27:47] himself within you, you're as eternal as
[1:27:50] God is because you're a part of him
[1:27:53] because you become a son or a daughter
[1:27:56] of God and you are displaying his word.
[1:27:58] He says, "Hallelujah. I feel religious."
[1:28:01] Notice how he says it. He places his
[1:28:03] spirit within you. Why? Because you're a
[1:28:06] part of him. And you become,
[1:28:12] you always are, but you have to exhibit
[1:28:15] the nature and attributes of a son and
[1:28:19] daughter of God. That's a process of
[1:28:21] time. Adoption is a process of time.
[1:28:26] The placing happens in a moment, but the
[1:28:29] process to get to the placing that takes
[1:28:31] time. It's the becoming of a son of God.
[1:28:34] It's the becoming of a daughter of God
[1:28:36] where he look where the tutor looks at
[1:28:37] you and he says you're just like your
[1:28:39] daddy. And that's when the father says
[1:28:41] all right you're ready to be placed.
[1:28:45] He says that's true. God identifies it
[1:28:47] himself. You've got eternal life and
[1:28:50] that's God in you. And this word is God
[1:28:52] and that word lives and produces one
[1:28:54] thing itself.
[1:28:59] I saw there's a man that calls himself a
[1:29:02] prophet.
[1:29:05] And he was preaching to a mostly
[1:29:08] poor group of black people. And he was
[1:29:11] saying, "If you want to, how many here
[1:29:13] rent?" And they, you know, a bunch of
[1:29:14] them raise their hands. He said, "How
[1:29:16] many of you owe payments on your car?"
[1:29:17] Raise your hands. He said, "If you'll
[1:29:19] give a a car payment to me," he says, "I
[1:29:22] guarantee your car will be paid off in
[1:29:23] the next year. I guarantee that God will
[1:29:25] give you a house in the next year."
[1:29:28] You're talking bribe potential, and all
[1:29:29] we can focus on is paying our car off or
[1:29:31] paying our house off.
[1:29:33] What a shame. And there's people just
[1:29:36] lapping it up because they're so
[1:29:38] desperate.
[1:29:40] So desperate for this world. Poor things
[1:29:44] led astray by a false prophet.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:49] But what's he wanting to give us? The
[1:29:51] word.
[1:29:53] The word. He says just exactly what God
[1:29:56] has ordained for this age. You have it.
[1:29:58] Amen. And the Holy Spirit being
[1:30:00] displayed. Yes, sir. What is it? The
[1:30:02] word has been quickened to you by the
[1:30:04] Holy Spirit to vindicate this age that
[1:30:07] you have passed from death unto life.
[1:30:09] Now, church, I don't know if you know
[1:30:11] this, but dead people don't act the same
[1:30:13] way as living people.
[1:30:15] They don't. They don't. Take my word for
[1:30:18] it. Dead people act differently than
[1:30:21] living people. Dead people just are.
[1:30:25] Living people, they have purpose. They
[1:30:28] build, they create, they share, they
[1:30:31] work with each other, they interact.
[1:30:33] Dead people just lay there.
[1:30:35] And what do they do? They decay.
[1:30:38] They fall apart. They do nothing. Amen.
[1:30:42] We can't say we pass from death unto
[1:30:45] life and do what everyone else is doing.
[1:30:49] You can't. And by everyone else, I mean
[1:30:51] this world. If our life is no different
[1:30:54] from the world's except that we go to
[1:30:56] church, we haven't passed from death
[1:30:58] unto life.
[1:31:00] We're just acting.
[1:31:02] Amen. That's straight, but it's true.
[1:31:06] Because he says the word produces
[1:31:08] itself.
[1:31:10] So when we've come into Christ, the word
[1:31:12] has to be produced.
[1:31:15] I was thinking on this, we'll get into
[1:31:16] it. This is my most favorite saying now
[1:31:19] in this next series. So many people are
[1:31:21] talking about what the Holy Ghost won't
[1:31:22] do. You know what I want to know,
[1:31:24] church? What will the Holy Ghost do?
[1:31:27] That's what I want. I want what he does,
[1:31:28] not what he doesn't do. That's what'll
[1:31:31] help our young people. That's what'll
[1:31:32] help us all is if we know what he'll do.
[1:31:34] And he says here, he'll display the
[1:31:35] word. He'll produce the word. He'll
[1:31:37] produce a life that's worthy of the
[1:31:38] gospel is what he's saying. Amen.
[1:31:44] Can we say we've been born again by the
[1:31:46] spirit if our life is no different than
[1:31:48] the world except we go to church?
[1:31:50] That's not a born again experience.
[1:31:53] We've been born again by the Holy
[1:31:54] Spirit. What's it doing for us? What is
[1:31:56] it doing for us? I'll tell you one
[1:31:59] thing. It's separating you from this
[1:32:01] world and it's drawing you closer home.
[1:32:04] That's what it does. That's what it
[1:32:06] does. That's my prayer every time I'm in
[1:32:08] that office. Lord, draw us a little bit
[1:32:10] closer to you and draw us a little
[1:32:12] further away from this world. Amen. It
[1:32:15] draws us closer to to Christ. And
[1:32:16] church, we don't always feel it.
[1:32:18] We don't always see it. We don't always
[1:32:20] know it's happening on I I look around
[1:32:23] tonight at the happy couple.
[1:32:26] Happy couples. Sister Brenda's not here.
[1:32:28] I'd hope to have two at least, brother
[1:32:29] Bob. You know, Sister Brenda, come on.
[1:32:34] We look around and you've been married
[1:32:36] over 50 years, right?
[1:32:38] How long?
[1:32:40] 43.
[1:32:43] And brother Gerald's I think over se how
[1:32:45] many years
[1:32:48] 60 55
[1:32:52] 53
[1:32:54] after 53 years and we look around and we
[1:32:56] see the joy and love on their faces.
[1:33:01] We see how brother Mark can start a
[1:33:03] sentence
[1:33:05] and sister Morin will finish it.
[1:33:09] Right?
[1:33:11] We see how brother Bob starts to say
[1:33:14] something and Sister Brenda is already
[1:33:16] rolling her eyes because she knows what
[1:33:18] he's about to say. And she finds it
[1:33:20] mildly amusing, but she can't let that
[1:33:22] go. So, she rolls her eyes instead.
[1:33:24] And we see Brother Gerald will start to
[1:33:26] say something and Sister Betty just puts
[1:33:27] her hand on his knee and says, "Come on,
[1:33:29] Gerald."
[1:33:31] Now, guess what? That didn't happen
[1:33:34] overnight, did it?
[1:33:37] It didn't happen overnight. How did it
[1:33:39] happen?
[1:33:40] constant relationship,
[1:33:45] unbroken relationship,
[1:33:48] commitment.
[1:33:50] And I'll tell you this, they can't
[1:33:52] finish each other's sentences and have
[1:33:54] those little things pass between. They
[1:33:56] don't even have to say words, church.
[1:33:57] They know what each other's thinking
[1:33:59] half the time.
[1:34:01] But let me tell you, can you tell me the
[1:34:03] day that happened?
[1:34:08] Joel says, "Definitely not.
[1:34:13] You can't tell me when it happened. All
[1:34:15] you know is at some point it happened
[1:34:18] and it's happening. And it's happening.
[1:34:21] Amen.
[1:34:23] The results showed eventually.
[1:34:26] They're showing us marriage potential.
[1:34:30] But when they started, it was just
[1:34:31] potential.
[1:34:33] But now they've got what we want in our
[1:34:36] marriages.
[1:34:38] I think
[1:34:41] whatever she wants us to do, right,
[1:34:43] brothers? That's what we want.
[1:34:47] Too brave to even nod.
[1:34:54] But I want you to take that.
[1:34:58] As far as I know, our elder married
[1:34:59] couples are happy. Help me. Yes. Nod.
[1:35:04] Amen.
[1:35:06] It's like
[1:35:08] it's like the brother that was down the
[1:35:09] states and he always drove a pickup and
[1:35:12] and his wife said, you know, how come
[1:35:15] you don't cuddle up to me in the car the
[1:35:16] way you used to? He says, I haven't
[1:35:17] moved my position.
[1:35:21] They used to have the bench seats, of
[1:35:22] course, you know, and she'd cuddle up to
[1:35:23] them. But
[1:35:25] anyways, take that. Take the happiness
[1:35:29] you see in Nan and Pop.
[1:35:32] Brother Mark and Sister Moren, the rice
[1:35:35] smiles that Sister Betty shares from
[1:35:36] time to time. Take all that and multiply
[1:35:40] it by a million.
[1:35:43] And that's the potential we have with
[1:35:44] Christ. Because guess what?
[1:35:48] Now, Sister Moren has been known for her
[1:35:50] sweetness all her life.
[1:35:56] always evente tempered,
[1:35:59] always a sweet word.
[1:36:03] I'm teasing Sister Morin right now and
[1:36:05] she knows it.
[1:36:07] But imagine the possibilities if your
[1:36:10] spouse was an actual angel
[1:36:14] rather than just a figurative angel.
[1:36:17] We say, you know, our brothers, if we
[1:36:18] have any good sense of us, we say our
[1:36:20] wife's the better of the two a lot of
[1:36:22] times because she to have a little more
[1:36:24] patience, a little more grace, a little
[1:36:26] more love, a little more endurance
[1:36:28] maybe. But take that and imagine that
[1:36:30] your spouse, no matter what complexes
[1:36:33] you offered, what pain you threw at
[1:36:36] them, what misunderstandings, what
[1:36:38] tantrums,
[1:36:39] what tiredness,
[1:36:42] whatever you threw at them, it didn't
[1:36:45] matter. They always came back with love,
[1:36:48] the right answer, the right response,
[1:36:51] the right touch
[1:36:54] every single time.
[1:36:56] That's what Christ offers because he's
[1:36:59] perfect and he's bound himself to us by
[1:37:03] grace
[1:37:05] by grace to take us through so that
[1:37:07] we're fit for him. Can you imagine? I
[1:37:11] think that make us want to be more like
[1:37:12] our spouse if our spouse has acted like
[1:37:14] that rather than abuse their good
[1:37:16] nature.
[1:37:18] You know, I've always said this. I've
[1:37:20] always said it to the wives because I've
[1:37:22] experienced it myself, but I believe it
[1:37:23] works both ways. Treat your spouse the
[1:37:25] way you want them to be and watch them
[1:37:28] grow into what you want them to be.
[1:37:33] Because we desire to meet the
[1:37:36] expectations of those we love.
[1:37:39] If my treats if my wife treats me like
[1:37:41] I'm the world's best husband, guess
[1:37:43] what? I want to be the best husband.
[1:37:47] If I've got any good in me at all, I
[1:37:49] want to be what she believes me to be,
[1:37:51] how she treats me to be. And it raises
[1:37:53] the standard up in my life. Amen. That's
[1:37:55] what Christ is doing with us is he's
[1:37:57] saying, "Listen, I picked you for a
[1:37:59] reason.
[1:38:01] I picked you because you got the right
[1:38:02] stuff. You're built from the same things
[1:38:05] I'm built from. You're going to overcome
[1:38:08] because I've made sure you're going to
[1:38:09] overcome because I'm here to take you
[1:38:11] all the way through.
[1:38:12] And it doesn't matter if you lose your
[1:38:14] tentrum, your your temper go into a
[1:38:16] tantrum. Doesn't matter if you fail.
[1:38:18] Doesn't matter if you think you're
[1:38:19] nothing. Doesn't matter if you have a
[1:38:21] big nose.
[1:38:22] It doesn't matter. I've chosen you. I've
[1:38:25] espoused myself to you. And I'm going to
[1:38:27] see it all the way through to a marriage
[1:38:28] and a marriage supper. That's what he's
[1:38:31] trying to do. He's encouraging us. Come
[1:38:33] along.
[1:38:34] Don't look at yourself. Look at me.
[1:38:37] Don't get caught up in yourself. Get
[1:38:39] caught up in me. Let yourself commit to
[1:38:42] me and watch what happens when you do.
[1:38:46] If you're tired of trying, commit to him
[1:38:50] and let him do the work in your life.
[1:38:51] Amen. You know, I always enjoy it when
[1:38:54] I'm watching kids play or even teaching
[1:38:57] my own
[1:39:00] and they're
[1:39:02] whether they're playing a sport, you
[1:39:03] know, trying to figure out how to do a
[1:39:04] slapshot or how to swim or whatever it
[1:39:06] might be and and they're saying, "I
[1:39:08] can't do it. I can't do it." You know,
[1:39:10] because usually what happens is they
[1:39:11] watch their their their older kids do it
[1:39:13] or they watch me do it or or whatever
[1:39:15] and and it looks so easy and then they
[1:39:18] go and do it and they can't do it at all
[1:39:21] right away. say they can't do it. And so
[1:39:24] what do you do? You work with them a
[1:39:25] while. You work with them a while. And
[1:39:27] then what happens is one day they do
[1:39:29] what they've been trying to do because
[1:39:31] you've told them you can do it. You can
[1:39:33] do it. And so what happens is they go
[1:39:36] out and they score that big goal in a
[1:39:37] game or or they finally get going on
[1:39:40] their bike without the training wheels
[1:39:41] and all of a sudden they're like, "Hey,
[1:39:43] I can do it." And they're unstoppable
[1:39:45] after that. They're unstoppable because
[1:39:48] you've taught them they're more than
[1:39:49] conquerors. They didn't realize it, but
[1:39:51] you've taught them they're more than
[1:39:52] conquerors. And so what do they do
[1:39:54] always? They go into delusions of
[1:39:55] competency and they go too far and next
[1:39:57] thing they're coming in with blood
[1:39:58] dripping all off their face because they
[1:39:59] went too fast on their bike. But they
[1:40:01] can ride their bike. They can ride their
[1:40:04] bike.
[1:40:06] Amen.
[1:40:09] No different with God and us when God
[1:40:12] gets us centered on him, listening to
[1:40:15] what he's saying, doing what he's
[1:40:17] telling us to do, abiding with him,
[1:40:20] reading his word, having conversation
[1:40:23] with him. What does he do? He centers us
[1:40:25] in on what we can do, what we're meant
[1:40:28] to do, what we're supposed to do. And
[1:40:30] all of a sudden, what happen is faith
[1:40:32] kicks in and we finally do it.
[1:40:35] And once we do it once, church, you
[1:40:37] never wonder if you can do it again. I
[1:40:40] mean, golf to me is the greatest example
[1:40:42] of this. You hit one good shot and
[1:40:44] you're convinced you can hit every shot
[1:40:45] good. You can't, but you're still
[1:40:48] convinced you can. And you go after it
[1:40:51] again and again and again. It's a it's a
[1:40:52] game of of futility.
[1:40:56] Absolutely it is. Well, for me, but this
[1:41:00] Christian walk is not a walk of futility
[1:41:03] because as you take one step, he gets
[1:41:05] you ready for the next step and the next
[1:41:07] step and the next step. And it's all a
[1:41:09] walk of faith that's producing the word
[1:41:12] inside of your life.
[1:41:15] I'll tell you this, God does one thing
[1:41:17] for you in your life. You'll trust him
[1:41:19] for that the rest of your life.
[1:41:23] You commit your finances to him once and
[1:41:25] he comes through. You know what? That
[1:41:27] should give you faith to commit him the
[1:41:28] rest of your life. God heals you once,
[1:41:32] give you faith for the rest of your
[1:41:34] life. Because when he's done it once,
[1:41:35] you know he can do it again and again
[1:41:37] and again and again. And all he's
[1:41:40] waiting for is a people that'll be the
[1:41:41] amen people. Be it unto me. I accept it.
[1:41:45] It's for me. Amen.
[1:41:48] What happens? as we start to develop
[1:41:49] some confidence in what he's saying
[1:41:51] about us rather than what these five
[1:41:53] senses and the inner five senses are
[1:41:54] screaming at us day by day. But it comes
[1:41:57] by focusing in on him. What's a coach
[1:42:00] trying to get us to do when you're when
[1:42:01] they're training us? Do what they want
[1:42:04] us to do. Stop trying it our way and
[1:42:07] start doing it their way. That's how
[1:42:10] you're going to win. That's how you're
[1:42:11] going to succeed. And it's no different
[1:42:12] with God. Brother says it this way. He
[1:42:15] says, "But a man has a soul." He says,
[1:42:18] "And therefore that soul is a part of
[1:42:20] God. And even in its fallen state, yet
[1:42:24] it's the greatest species of all the
[1:42:26] species of the earth is the man." He
[1:42:29] says, "And then get him in connection
[1:42:31] with his maker. He becomes a superman
[1:42:35] almost because he's a son of God. He
[1:42:40] becomes acquainted with his maker, with
[1:42:42] the creator of all things. And then when
[1:42:44] that man there acquainted with his maker
[1:42:47] becomes a part of his maker, comes back
[1:42:49] into fellowship with his maker, every
[1:42:52] divine word becomes a living reality to
[1:42:55] him and he believes it.
[1:43:00] I feel like I need to read that again.
[1:43:05] He says, "A man has a soul. Therefore,
[1:43:08] that soul is a part of God. And even in
[1:43:11] its fallen state, anybody feeling fallen
[1:43:14] this evening?
[1:43:18] Yeah, cuz I'm in the flesh. Brother
[1:43:21] Joe's back there screaming. It's
[1:43:22] obvious, Brother John. We're all in a
[1:43:23] fallen state. Just move on.
[1:43:29] Even in its fallen state, you know what
[1:43:32] he's saying? regardless of what it looks
[1:43:36] and feels like. Okay? It's the greatest
[1:43:40] species of all the species of the earth
[1:43:42] is the man. And now what do you have to
[1:43:44] do? He says, "And then get him in
[1:43:46] connection
[1:43:48] relationship
[1:43:50] abiding
[1:43:53] with his maker. He becomes a superman
[1:43:56] almost because he's a son of God." Where
[1:44:00] is the power for that child of God?
[1:44:04] connection with his maker.
[1:44:09] Connection with his maker.
[1:44:11] He said he becomes acquainted with his
[1:44:13] maker with the creator of all things.
[1:44:15] And then when that man there acquainted
[1:44:17] with his maker becomes a part of his
[1:44:19] maker. How do you become a part of your
[1:44:21] spouse?
[1:44:24] Connection.
[1:44:26] Connection.
[1:44:28] Listen. If we put brother Mark here and
[1:44:29] sister Morin over there, guess what?
[1:44:31] There's no connection there. They've got
[1:44:33] to get together. They got to spend time
[1:44:35] together. They got to talk to each
[1:44:36] other. They got to share things with
[1:44:37] each other. They got to plan things
[1:44:39] together, make decisions together,
[1:44:41] produce things together. That's all part
[1:44:43] of being in connection. Amen. He says he
[1:44:45] becomes a part of his maker. He comes
[1:44:47] back into fellowship with his maker.
[1:44:50] Every divine word becomes a living
[1:44:52] reality to him. And he believes it.
[1:44:55] We're talking about the bride potential
[1:44:57] tonight. The amen people. You know, it
[1:45:00] amazes me when we look back
[1:45:03] when God offered relationship finally to
[1:45:05] a people because remember God offered
[1:45:08] relationship to individuals from the
[1:45:10] beginning.
[1:45:12] He had an individual relationship with
[1:45:13] Noah and we see him come through and he
[1:45:15] has an individual relationship with
[1:45:16] Abraham. And then from Abraham he goes
[1:45:18] to Isaac and then Isaac to Jacob and
[1:45:21] Jacob to Joseph and Joseph on to Moses.
[1:45:24] It was always just men or or or or a
[1:45:26] family if we could put it that way. just
[1:45:28] one one person and then everyone kind of
[1:45:30] came in under that blessing and that's
[1:45:33] why they call him the God of Abraham,
[1:45:34] Isaac and Jacob. It was a a direct thing
[1:45:37] with those individuals. But now God
[1:45:38] takes Israel out of Egypt. He takes them
[1:45:41] into the promised land and he comes and
[1:45:43] he reveals himself to them. He speaks to
[1:45:45] them and what is he doing? He's offering
[1:45:47] relationship.
[1:45:50] And what do they do? They turn him down
[1:45:53] out of fear.
[1:45:55] They turn them down out of fear and they
[1:45:57] say, "Work through Moses
[1:46:00] and give us a law and we'll have
[1:46:03] relationship with you through the law.
[1:46:06] We'll have relationshipship through you
[1:46:08] with another man." And that decision
[1:46:10] became a thorn in their flesh until
[1:46:11] Christ came and took it away. Because
[1:46:14] what did they do? Remember, they chose
[1:46:16] the law of God over the relationship of
[1:46:20] God. And that brought judgment instead
[1:46:21] of grace. Remember the scripture says
[1:46:24] love coverth a multitude of sins. Love
[1:46:27] is relationship,
[1:46:29] okay? Not works, not performance.
[1:46:33] Listen, I love my wife whether or not
[1:46:35] she makes a fantastic meal every night,
[1:46:38] which she does, by the way. But if she
[1:46:41] stopped,
[1:46:42] I would still love her.
[1:46:45] I would still love her if she didn't
[1:46:47] make her hair beautiful every day
[1:46:50] because she was too busy. because
[1:46:52] there's too much going on. I would still
[1:46:54] love her. Why? Because we're in a
[1:46:56] relationship, not in a work. That's not
[1:46:59] what it is. We're not under works. Amen.
[1:47:01] Love is gracious. Works is legalism.
[1:47:04] That's really what we're getting at.
[1:47:06] Amen. And so, it's because I'm choosing
[1:47:08] relationship with her rather than what
[1:47:11] she does for me.
[1:47:13] The relationship supersedes all the
[1:47:15] works. You see that love covers a
[1:47:17] multitude of miss meals.
[1:47:20] I'm choosing that and she's chosen that
[1:47:23] with me and that works pretty well for
[1:47:25] us. Amen. But we would be most miserable
[1:47:28] if all it was was, well, you didn't do
[1:47:29] this and therefore I'm not going to do
[1:47:30] that. And it becomes a tip for tat and
[1:47:32] it destroys the marriage.
[1:47:35] Church, I mean, you look at Abraham, you
[1:47:37] talk about grace. I was talking with a
[1:47:40] with a brother about this this week.
[1:47:42] Abraham lies to Aimilec. He says that
[1:47:45] Sarah is my sister. It was a halftruth
[1:47:47] because she was a half sister. He says,
[1:47:49] "She's my sister. That man is a
[1:47:52] righteous man." But he takes her for his
[1:47:54] wife. And God comes to him at that night
[1:47:55] in a dream and says, "You're a dead man
[1:47:57] because you've taken another man's
[1:47:58] wife." He says, "God, you know me. You
[1:48:01] know my heart." He said he was she was
[1:48:04] his sister and I took him at his word.
[1:48:06] And God says, "Go to Abraham and pray
[1:48:09] for him."
[1:48:11] He says, "And then I won't kill you."
[1:48:14] You talk about grace. Abraham has lied.
[1:48:16] Abraham has put another person's life in
[1:48:18] jeopardy. And the grace of God tells
[1:48:21] that man, "Go and ask Abraham to pray
[1:48:23] for you. Humble yourself before my son,
[1:48:26] before my prophet." That's what grace
[1:48:29] looks like.
[1:48:31] That's not law. That's grace.
[1:48:34] Abraham was surrounded in grace. He was
[1:48:36] wrapped in grace. And the bride is no
[1:48:38] less wrapped in grace. Amen. Church, I
[1:48:40] say, "Lord, I want grace tonight. Wrap
[1:48:42] me in your grace." I'll say this in my
[1:48:44] prayer. I I think I inherited this from
[1:48:46] brother Gerald. I say grace so many
[1:48:49] times when I'm praying to God. Lord,
[1:48:51] grant brother so and so grace. Grant
[1:48:53] brother, sister so s grace. Lord, we
[1:48:55] need your grace in this situation
[1:48:56] because that's what we're robed in is
[1:48:58] his grace, not our works, not our
[1:49:01] righteousness, not something we've done
[1:49:02] to deserve it. I want grace above all
[1:49:05] else. I want grace. But the children of
[1:49:07] Israel said, just give us a law. We'll
[1:49:09] do the law. We'll relate to you by the
[1:49:12] lives that we live.
[1:49:14] And they never could. And they never
[1:49:17] did. What an opportunity, miss, church.
[1:49:20] What an opportunity. Amen. They figured
[1:49:22] they could do it on their own. They
[1:49:24] figured they could live a life that
[1:49:25] could satisfy God. And they gave up
[1:49:27] relationship for works. And what did
[1:49:28] that do? It put the burden on their
[1:49:31] shoulders instead of his.
[1:49:34] Because with Abraham, Abraham just had
[1:49:37] to walk.
[1:49:38] The burden was on God to produce the
[1:49:40] child. But when you take law, now the
[1:49:43] burden's on you to do what God wants.
[1:49:45] And we see what the law produced.
[1:49:47] Judgment. Judgment. Judgment. Amen.
[1:49:51] They made it about them instead of God.
[1:49:54] Now listen to this as we close this
[1:49:56] evening. He says, "Now that's where
[1:49:58] people think today of divine healing or
[1:50:01] some any other work of grace of God that
[1:50:04] there's something you have to do.
[1:50:06] There's nothing you have to do but
[1:50:08] believe. Just believe God." And they if
[1:50:11] they would have continued on, he's
[1:50:13] talking about the children of Israel
[1:50:14] walking with God. If they would have
[1:50:15] continued on, the promise wasn't given
[1:50:17] them under the law. He said the promise
[1:50:20] was given them before the law without
[1:50:22] any conditions to it. I've given you
[1:50:24] this land. Go on over into it. But
[1:50:26] before they got to that promise, they
[1:50:29] decided there was something they must do
[1:50:32] themselves.
[1:50:33] He says, "And that we still find that
[1:50:35] among human beings were prone to be that
[1:50:39] way.
[1:50:40] There's something we've got to do. We
[1:50:43] feel that that we've got to have
[1:50:45] something into it also. He says you do
[1:50:47] have something into it. That's your
[1:50:49] surrender of your own will, your own
[1:50:52] ideas to the will and idea of almighty
[1:50:55] God and it's finished. He says that's
[1:50:59] all there is. He says just take his
[1:51:02] promise. Don't think of nothing else.
[1:51:04] Walk by it and God does the rest of it.
[1:51:08] Amen. God bless you. Let's stand this
[1:51:10] evening.
[1:51:12] I say, "Lord, help me surrender my own
[1:51:14] will and my idea, my own ideas to the
[1:51:17] will and idea of almighty God." And then
[1:51:20] say, "It's finished." See, that's where
[1:51:23] we stand. Having done all stand, stand
[1:51:27] and say, "Lord, I believe. Lord, I'm
[1:51:29] trusting. Lord, I'm holding. Lord, I'm
[1:51:31] waiting."
[1:51:34] And we stay there until he does what he
[1:51:36] said he was going to do. Why? because
[1:51:38] we're the amen people. Amen, Lord. Be it
[1:51:41] unto me, Lord. I'm part of your bride.
[1:51:43] I'm part of that end time body. I'm part
[1:51:44] of that true church. And I'm trusting
[1:51:46] you to do what you said you're going to
[1:51:48] do. I'm expecting the promise of your
[1:51:50] word. Amen. And that means living like
[1:51:52] we mean it. That means talking like we
[1:51:54] mean it. That means testifying like we
[1:51:56] mean it. Amen. It's living like we're
[1:51:59] going to experience it because we are.
[1:52:01] One day it's got to happen. Amen. We're
[1:52:04] the final Amen. We're the final voice.
[1:52:06] We're the living proof of the word for
[1:52:08] this age. We're elected to vindicate
[1:52:11] God's word in this age.
[1:52:14] You will judge the earth,
[1:52:17] not by the words you say so much as the
[1:52:20] life you live. Amen. You know, I had to
[1:52:23] go to court this week. Uh a brother that
[1:52:26] borrowed my car got a bad parking ticket
[1:52:28] and I had to go to court to to try and
[1:52:30] fight for him. And I'll tell you what,
[1:52:34] it was it was a female justice that was
[1:52:35] there. And I I appreciated her attitude.
[1:52:37] She was considerate for those of us that
[1:52:40] were not lawyers. And she was looking to
[1:52:42] show grace rather than judge us all. And
[1:52:47] what a wonderful thing it is. Amen.
[1:52:50] But she's there in the end to back up
[1:52:52] the law. She's there to hold us to the
[1:52:55] law.
[1:52:57] Well, Christ comes and he's here to hold
[1:52:58] us to the word, but not to judge us, but
[1:53:01] to get us out of here. It's a different
[1:53:03] thing. He's no longer our judge. He's
[1:53:05] our advocate. He's there to encourage
[1:53:08] us. He's there to bring us up to it
[1:53:10] rather than push us down because of it.
[1:53:13] Do you see the difference? The judge has
[1:53:15] now become the advocate.
[1:53:18] It's grace, grace, grace. As brother
[1:53:21] Gerald always said, crying grace, grace,
[1:53:23] grace. And that's what he's pressuring
[1:53:26] us with, grace. He's wrapping us in
[1:53:28] grace. Keep going. Keep moving. Keep
[1:53:31] believing. Keep pressing. Keep trusting.
[1:53:34] Keep praying. Keep asking. Keep hoping.
[1:53:38] Keep the faith. Amen. That's what he's
[1:53:41] looking for. That's the bribe potential
[1:53:43] of this age. Amen. Is when we can let
[1:53:46] God's word have full control in our
[1:53:48] lives and rest on it. Rest on it until
[1:53:52] he does what he says he would do. Amen.
[1:53:56] Let's bow our heads.
[1:53:58] Heavenly Father, Lord, it's good to be a
[1:54:01] Christian today. Lord, it's good to be
[1:54:03] living under the promise of your word.
[1:54:05] Lord, it's good to be living under the
[1:54:08] presence of your spirit in our lives,
[1:54:09] each one.
[1:54:11] Lord, I pray that we take what's been
[1:54:13] said tonight,
[1:54:15] Lord. And I don't believe any of us can
[1:54:17] say we've got the full potential
[1:54:18] tonight.
[1:54:20] We have all the potential, Lord. But I
[1:54:22] don't believe it's all realized yet,
[1:54:25] Lord, because we're still here. We're
[1:54:28] still fighting. We're still believing,
[1:54:31] Lord. And we've got battles to fight,
[1:54:34] Lord. We may have battles we lost today,
[1:54:37] Lord. But we're believing we're
[1:54:38] overcomers. We're believing we're
[1:54:40] victors. We're believing that you're
[1:54:42] raising a standard in our life, Lord,
[1:54:43] that will overpower the enemy, Lord. We
[1:54:46] want to be a witness. We want to be a
[1:54:48] testimony for you, Lord. And I pray that
[1:54:50] your spirit would be on the youngest to
[1:54:52] the oldest, heavenly father. Lord, that
[1:54:54] you would help us to live a life that's
[1:54:56] worthy of this gospel, Lord. That it
[1:54:58] would reflect the vindicated word of
[1:55:00] this age, Lord. That people would see us
[1:55:02] and see a reality, Lord, of you day by
[1:55:05] day. Open their eyes, Lord. Open our
[1:55:08] eyes, Lord. Help us to see oursel in
[1:55:11] your word, Lord. Help us to trust the
[1:55:13] process, Lord. Help us to commit
[1:55:15] ourselves a new to you every single day.
[1:55:17] We pray. Strengthen your people, Lord.
[1:55:20] Strengthen us, Lord. Encourage us day by
[1:55:22] day, Lord. Lord, we see where David went
[1:55:24] to ziglag and things looked so hor just
[1:55:27] absolutely horrible. Looked like
[1:55:28] everything was lost, Lord. But the
[1:55:30] scripture says that David encouraged
[1:55:32] himself in the Lord. Lord, I pray we've
[1:55:34] got something to encourage oursel with,
[1:55:36] Lord. The testimonies you've given us,
[1:55:37] the answers you've given, the provision,
[1:55:39] Lord, the leadership, the guidance, the
[1:55:41] healing, Lord, whatever it may be. Lord,
[1:55:43] let us remind ourselves of what you've
[1:55:45] done in the past, Lord, to raise faith
[1:55:47] for what we need you to do in the
[1:55:49] present and future. Lord, let us look at
[1:55:51] our book of remembrance tonight and in
[1:55:53] the coming days, Lord, to know that you
[1:55:55] are all that you say you are. Lord,
[1:55:57] you're a God that never breaks his word.
[1:56:00] Lord, bless your people tonight. We pray
[1:56:03] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[1:56:06] Be it unto me. Uh 10:08.
[1:56:16] Be it unto
[1:56:19] me
[1:56:23] according to your word,
[1:56:30] according to your promises.
[1:56:35] is. Oh, I can stand
[1:56:40] secure
[1:56:44] right upon
[1:56:46] my heart.
[1:56:50] the truth.
[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Your word, oh Lord,
[1:57:04] be it unto
[1:57:07] me.
[1:57:11] be it unto
[1:57:15] me
[1:57:18] according to your word,
[1:57:25] according to your promises.
[1:57:32] I can stand
[1:57:35] secure
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:39] right upon
[1:57:41] my heart.
[1:57:45] The truth that sets me free
[1:57:52] according to your word. Oh Lord,
[1:57:59] be it unto
[1:58:02] me. One more time.
[1:58:06] Be it unto
[1:58:10] me.
[1:58:13] According to your word,
[1:58:20] according to your promises.
[1:58:26] Oh, I can stand
[1:58:30] secure
[1:58:33] right upon
[1:58:36] my heart.
[1:58:40] The truth that sets me free.
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:50] your word, oh Lord,
[1:58:54] be it unto
[1:58:57] me.
[1:59:00] Holy Spirit, rain down. 7:17.
[1:59:11] Holy,
[1:59:13] holy spirit reign. Rain
[1:59:19] down.

[2:00:05] Come and change our hearts as we stand
[2:00:10] on your word.
[2:00:12] Holy Spirit,

[2:02:15] down.
[2:02:18] Let your power fall. Let your voice be
[2:02:23] heard. Come and change our hearts as we
[2:02:29] stand on your word. Holy Spirit,
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:38] rain down.
[2:02:45] Amen. Draw me. Draw me, Lord. 12:15.
[2:02:49] And as we close, I'm going to ask
[2:02:50] Brother David to come and close in
[2:02:53] prayer if he would. Amen. It's good to
[2:02:54] see Sister Kimberly back and Wesley
[2:02:56] doing better, I assume, as well. Amen.
[2:02:58] Praise the Lord. Glad to see that. Amen.
[2:03:01] It's always such a hardship when the
[2:03:03] young ones are sick. You know, us
[2:03:04] adults, we kind of just suffer through
[2:03:05] it, but they tend to be so miserable and
[2:03:08] they can't do anything. But it's good to
[2:03:10] see him back and we certainly appreciate
[2:03:12] that. Amen. Remember one another.
[2:03:14] Remember the services coming up.
[2:03:17] Amen. We need more of him, that's for
[2:03:19] sure. Amen. Let's sing this as brother
[2:03:23] David would come.
[2:03:25] You alone
[2:03:27] are all I need.
[2:03:35] For you hold my destiny.
[2:03:45] You alone are all I need.
[2:03:54] You alone
[2:03:57] I am
[2:04:00] complete.
[2:04:06] Draw me,
[2:04:11] draw me, Lord,
[2:04:15] and I'll come running after you.
[2:04:25] Draw me.
[2:04:30] Draw me, Lord.
[2:04:35] I'll come running after you.
[2:04:43] You alone
[2:04:45] are all I need.
[2:04:52] For you hold my destiny.
[2:05:02] You alone
[2:05:04] are all I need.
[2:05:11] You alone
[2:05:14] I am
[2:05:16] complete.
[2:05:23] Draw me.
[2:05:28] Draw me Lord
[2:05:32] and I'll come running after you.
[2:05:42] Draw me.
[2:05:47] Draw me, Lord.
[2:05:52] And I'll come running after you. Draw
[2:05:56] me. Draw me.
[2:06:01] So draw me,
[2:06:06] draw me, Lord,
[2:06:11] and I'll come running after you.
[2:06:21] Draw me.
[2:06:26] Draw me, Lord,
[2:06:30] I'll come running after you.
