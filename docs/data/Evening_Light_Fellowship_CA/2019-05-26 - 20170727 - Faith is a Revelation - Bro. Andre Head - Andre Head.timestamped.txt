[1:01:13] and you know I'm just a little bit
[1:01:19] nervous I always get nervous when I come
[1:01:22] out but how I enjoyed the specials
[1:01:25] tonight and singing from your heart
[1:01:28] there I remember I think it's our first
[1:01:32] year here my wife and I our first year
[1:01:36] we got to meet your wonderful pastor and
[1:01:39] and also our precious brother their
[1:01:42] coffee and we didn't have time on that
[1:01:47] trip to come and visit you and then last
[1:01:49] year we thought maybe there would be
[1:01:52] time and I just want to be honest with
[1:01:54] you my wife and I kind of got under the
[1:01:55] radar and actually visited st. John's
[1:01:58] here and and had a good time we went to
[1:02:01] the different sites there and we we just
[1:02:03] had a great time and then this year well
[1:02:07] last year we talked to brother Geralyn
[1:02:09] said well Jerry we'd love to come we
[1:02:12] understand there's a lovely group there
[1:02:14] in st. John's and and I'm getting to see
[1:02:16] that group tonight and then of course
[1:02:19] after I went back home and just
[1:02:21] fellowship in with my dear beau somebody
[1:02:25] there brother Chad who I loved dearly
[1:02:27] and him telling me said brother Andre
[1:02:30] you know we've moved out to st. John and
[1:02:33] I'm just feeling just so wonderful my
[1:02:35] family we feel that we've kind of fit
[1:02:38] into the believers there and so I wanted
[1:02:43] this time to come and to be with you and
[1:02:45] so you know you always want to be in
[1:02:48] God's time
[1:02:50] I can tell you and you know these things
[1:02:54] the last thing we want to do is get
[1:02:56] ahead of the Lord and sometimes we might
[1:02:59] move slow and maybe he has to put a
[1:03:00] little fire under us but I would rather
[1:03:02] him put fire under me than to get ahead
[1:03:05] of and so we we just thank the Lord we I
[1:03:09] think it's been several weeks ago I
[1:03:12] believe it and now if I get the names
[1:03:13] mixed up y'all have mercy on me but I
[1:03:16] believe it was brother Mark and his wife
[1:03:19] they were down and and we had just a
[1:03:23] wonderful time of fellowship and and so
[1:03:26] we were trying to set up some dates to
[1:03:28] come down and be with you and we the
[1:03:31] brother said ok we'll go back and talk
[1:03:33] to the pastor and see if these days will
[1:03:35] be sufficient for us and so we we had a
[1:03:38] wonderful time there with him and his
[1:03:41] wife I tell you what she has such a
[1:03:43] lovely voice and just a just a sweet
[1:03:48] spirit and we just had a a wonderful
[1:03:50] time and I thought my maybe when I go
[1:03:53] st. John I'm just gonna listen to them
[1:03:56] all just one by one and just all those
[1:03:58] angelic voices just just singing the
[1:04:02] praise of the Lord and I understand
[1:04:04] tomorrow we'll be in fellowship so we
[1:04:06] look forward to that and then just this
[1:04:09] last past weekend and just Colombo God
[1:04:14] bless you too and your family yeah and
[1:04:16] just this last weekend we brother Paul
[1:04:21] and his wife were there and what a fine
[1:04:25] family and brother Matthew and his wife
[1:04:30] was there also and because we had some
[1:04:33] other activities we just kind of got to
[1:04:35] shake their hand and tell him God
[1:04:38] blessed them and said hey I believe
[1:04:40] we're going to be down with you so we we
[1:04:43] just we appreciate those fine families
[1:04:46] they're appreciate the little fellowship
[1:04:49] that we got then but it was good for
[1:04:51] them and and so here we are by God's
[1:04:55] grace we when we were coming down I
[1:04:58] thought well it's a good drive down to
[1:05:02] st. John's
[1:05:03] but then brother Karsan he got to
[1:05:05] talking to me say you know well we if we
[1:05:09] take off this time and I was thinking
[1:05:11] well is he gonna I'm not gonna follow
[1:05:13] him down or what and then he said no no
[1:05:16] no no brother I'm gonna drive you down
[1:05:18] so I said well praise the Lord that's
[1:05:21] gonna be fine and so my wife and I we're
[1:05:23] thankful that Bella Carlson and his wife
[1:05:26] they drove us down had a good trip
[1:05:28] coming down we stopped and visited one
[1:05:30] of the communities there and it was just
[1:05:32] very lovely there you I tell you my wife
[1:05:35] and I this is our third year to visit
[1:05:38] your Providence and it's Newfoundland is
[1:05:42] so beautiful we've we last year we were
[1:05:46] out and grouse mourn and my wife and I
[1:05:48] we hiked so we were able to hike some
[1:05:51] trails and go through the boat ride and
[1:05:54] and just everywhere you go you just you
[1:05:58] see a lovely place and the shoreline the
[1:06:01] rivers and the lakes you think well I
[1:06:04] don't believe I can see any better and
[1:06:06] then you see another part and it just
[1:06:08] and so I tell you what God he really put
[1:06:10] his finger print here on this Providence
[1:06:14] I mean all of Canada is beautiful you
[1:06:16] understand brother branham he said in
[1:06:19] his message I if you want the message I
[1:06:21] get it to you he said that the most
[1:06:23] beautiful place in the world to him was
[1:06:25] Banff and Jasper brother Brown said that
[1:06:28] was the most beautiful place in the
[1:06:30] whole earth to him and so when he said
[1:06:33] that you know as a believer you think
[1:06:35] man I got to get to Baffin Jasper then
[1:06:38] and so but I know that the Prophet he
[1:06:41] didn't have the opportunity we know that
[1:06:43] he flew into Gander flew out of there
[1:06:47] but I think the Ministerial Association
[1:06:50] of Pentecostal gentlemen who was in
[1:06:53] charge I don't even know whether to call
[1:06:55] him and gentleman or not but he would
[1:06:57] not have the prophet coming to
[1:06:59] Newfoundland but you know that did not
[1:07:01] stop the hand of the Lord
[1:07:05] because God knew that he had his seed
[1:07:08] here and nothing was going to stop that
[1:07:11] you see and so how beautiful it is to
[1:07:14] see the very purchase of his blood
[1:07:16] tonight see the great the great victory
[1:07:19] has here and new from it and so as as
[1:07:22] the pastor said we have one more service
[1:07:26] and Grand Falls we've been there for
[1:07:28] about a month just enjoying our time
[1:07:30] fellowship and the brothers there they
[1:07:32] send greetings to you all here they said
[1:07:35] well Andre please send our greetings and
[1:07:37] we do my wife and I we send our
[1:07:39] greetings from our pastor back in Irwin
[1:07:42] Tennessee brother Harvey Peterson and so
[1:07:45] they the church there since their
[1:07:47] greetings to you also and how thankful
[1:07:50] we are for that well I think I got all
[1:07:53] the announcements over but I wanted to
[1:07:56] get it right you know the first time you
[1:07:59] you you meet a part of God's body it's
[1:08:04] just a great blessing and you know you
[1:08:06] just don't want to kind of run out there
[1:08:08] and just start ministering you want to
[1:08:10] be able to enjoy the very Saints sister
[1:08:14] Betty god bless you yes god bless you I
[1:08:17] asked brother Jer I said how's your wife
[1:08:19] doing and I remember last year
[1:08:22] brother Geralyn and sister Betty they
[1:08:25] were visiting a brother jerilyn sister
[1:08:29] but there and so we we had a great time
[1:08:33] and in that time I really got to
[1:08:35] fellowship with your pastor and and I
[1:08:38] already stood understood a little bit
[1:08:41] about the website and how tremendous and
[1:08:43] how this has affected so many people all
[1:08:46] over the world the website there and the
[1:08:49] the great work that God has used your
[1:08:51] pastor in spreading the gospel and
[1:08:54] helping the Saints and I tell you what
[1:08:56] we we honor those things and we
[1:08:58] appreciate those things because they are
[1:09:02] honorable and so we we actually in that
[1:09:05] time when they were visiting brother and
[1:09:08] sister there and Grand Falls or Bishop
[1:09:14] Falls that was when I really got to
[1:09:18] meet your pastor in and his wife and
[1:09:20] really our spirits kind of just kind of
[1:09:25] metal together there I thought my the
[1:09:28] Bible says how can two walk together
[1:09:31] except they be agreed and of course we
[1:09:34] know it's the word that we're looking
[1:09:36] for we may enjoy other things in life
[1:09:38] but one thing about a believer they're
[1:09:41] going to come back to the common
[1:09:42] denomination in their lives and that is
[1:09:45] the word of the Lord and so to be able
[1:09:48] to hear and listen to your pastor I
[1:09:51] really enjoyed the fellowship and I
[1:09:53] thought well and brother Chad was
[1:09:56] praying said well if I get if the Lord
[1:09:59] brings us up to Newfoundland one more
[1:10:01] time which we did not have plans to come
[1:10:04] here we were supposed to be in the
[1:10:06] church there and and left them Guyana
[1:10:09] that the Lord is raised up and we're
[1:10:11] working with that church trying to get
[1:10:13] them established in the present day
[1:10:14] truth and and but the the leadership of
[1:10:18] the Lord brought us back here for his
[1:10:20] own good purpose so I thought well the
[1:10:23] Lord if it's your grace we'd like to get
[1:10:26] over the st. John so here we are this
[1:10:29] evening not going to keep you long but
[1:10:31] we're so thankful that we have this
[1:10:33] opportunity to sit at the Masters table
[1:10:36] to draw from that Holy Ghost and to see
[1:10:41] and see the reality of God's Word in our
[1:10:44] lives and I tell you what a blessed
[1:10:46] people you are and how the Great Holy
[1:10:50] Spirit the only revealer of the Divine
[1:10:54] Word of God has called you out in this
[1:10:57] hour because you have a part to play and
[1:11:01] as we said everyone has a part to play
[1:11:03] in this evening time the bride has a
[1:11:06] part to play the foolish virgin has a
[1:11:09] part to play the organizational world
[1:11:12] has a part to play Rome has a part to
[1:11:15] play the United States has a part to
[1:11:17] play Russia has a part to play Israel
[1:11:21] has a part to play we've all got a part
[1:11:23] to play here and
[1:11:25] Sen Tom and how thankful we are that the
[1:11:28] part that we have to play is to be the
[1:11:32] manifested victory of God for this hour
[1:11:36] and we're thankful that God has raised
[1:11:39] us up for that purpose to manifest his
[1:11:43] word
[1:11:43] that Holy Ghost manifesting that word in
[1:11:46] our lives
[1:11:47] speaking spirit and life in our lives
[1:11:50] and connecting with our heart drawing us
[1:11:54] by his word and revealing himself to us
[1:11:58] as he said the world will see me no more
[1:12:01] but you shall see me and the only way
[1:12:06] that we can see him is by the word and
[1:12:08] when the word becomes alive in our heart
[1:12:12] and that word begins to make itself
[1:12:14] manifest then we're seeing him you can't
[1:12:18] see God outside of his word because God
[1:12:21] and his word are inseparable
[1:12:24] and if a man says he knows God outside
[1:12:27] of his word he doesn't know God because
[1:12:30] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:12:32] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:12:35] in the word became flesh and we're
[1:12:38] thankful that the word is becoming flesh
[1:12:41] in our life and by the baptism of the
[1:12:44] Holy Ghost we have found out that we are
[1:12:47] a part of that word when before the
[1:12:50] foundation of the world and now our
[1:12:53] season our time has come to manifest
[1:12:57] that promised word for the hour blessed
[1:13:00] be the name of the Lord if you have your
[1:13:01] Bibles let's stand once more and we'll
[1:13:03] just go to the word now let's turn to
[1:13:06] Romans chapter 1 and we're going to read
[1:13:09] verse 16 and 17
[1:13:13] I've been ministering on faith while
[1:13:16] I've been here and how we thank the Lord
[1:13:19] as he continues to open this word
[1:13:24] spiritual faith brother Branham said in
[1:13:29] the sealed book he says now it'll take
[1:13:34] those seven unknown thunders
[1:13:37] to bring rapturing faith to the bride
[1:13:41] and how thankful we are because and I'm
[1:13:44] not going to keep you standing alone
[1:13:45] we'll read the verse but in this hour
[1:13:48] that we lived in Satan that's put so
[1:13:49] much scarecrows on the word and so when
[1:13:53] you say seven thunder then they think
[1:13:55] you may be a part of the seven thunder
[1:13:57] virtual group or this group or that
[1:13:59] group but in spite of all of that there
[1:14:03] is a people that is having a seven
[1:14:06] Thunder revival by the Word of God being
[1:14:10] restored to them and they're not worried
[1:14:13] about the Scarecrow's because the only
[1:14:16] one that can keep the bride not only
[1:14:19] save you but keep you is the Holy Ghost
[1:14:21] you see we can't keep ourselves if we
[1:14:24] can keep yourself but in this hour the
[1:14:27] two spirits would be so close according
[1:14:30] to Matthew 24:24
[1:14:31] that it would deceive even the very
[1:14:34] elected if it were possible but it's not
[1:14:36] possible but Satan because of falsehood
[1:14:42] and discrepancy he gets his perfect
[1:14:45] anointing in this endtime but God has
[1:14:49] brought a combat beast the great flying
[1:14:51] eagle the one that could discern the
[1:14:54] pale horse rider and called him and said
[1:14:56] this is death and hell falls then there
[1:14:59] is a discernment in the broad in this
[1:15:02] endtime that looks directly at the word
[1:15:05] and because she is the word in the Word
[1:15:08] of God is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:15:10] and intents of the heart then by that
[1:15:13] living word in you you will discern
[1:15:16] those two spirits and withstand that
[1:15:19] the spirit you see God said these things
[1:15:21] so you're going to do it because the C
[1:15:25] gene that he planted in your heart is
[1:15:28] growing up and he is drawing that by
[1:15:31] this great third pool the opening of the
[1:15:34] word then there has to come an opening
[1:15:37] of the word where the broad really
[1:15:39] catches the reality of the opening of
[1:15:43] those seals and then the speaking of the
[1:15:45] word follows those things and that's who
[1:15:48] you are you are that people and we're
[1:15:51] not afraid of that amen in Romans
[1:15:56] chapter 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed
[1:15:59] of the gospel of Christ for it is the
[1:16:03] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[1:16:07] that believeth to the Jew first and also
[1:16:10] to the Greek now when it says here that
[1:16:13] it is the power of God unto salvation
[1:16:16] that Brit that incorporates everything
[1:16:19] in your life salvation forgiveness faith
[1:16:24] everything Redemption everything is
[1:16:27] right there in that word salvation
[1:16:30] brother Brandon would say many times he
[1:16:33] said now he's Jehovah Jireh the Lord who
[1:16:36] provided and he says now if he is the
[1:16:39] Lord who has provided if he is Jehovah
[1:16:41] Jireh then he also has to be Jehovah
[1:16:44] Rapha I am the Lord that healeth all of
[1:16:47] thy diseases so not only is he but the
[1:16:51] seven compound redemptive names of
[1:16:55] Jehovah is in this salvation because God
[1:16:59] has connected himself to your earthly
[1:17:02] journey you see let's read verse 17 now
[1:17:06] and there will be seated he says now for
[1:17:09] therein is the righteousness of God
[1:17:11] revealed from faith to faith so if God
[1:17:15] is going to be known he's going to be
[1:17:18] known only by revelation
[1:17:22] and faith is a revelation you know these
[1:17:24] things already but a revelation is
[1:17:28] something real it's not make-believe
[1:17:30] it's not what I've educated myself up to
[1:17:33] it's not that I read enough because
[1:17:36] these men like Peter that were unlearned
[1:17:38] men and yet when God came to them and
[1:17:42] revealed to them even before pentacles
[1:17:45] came to Peter and said Peter flesh and
[1:17:49] blood did not reveal this to you but my
[1:17:51] father has revealed this to you
[1:17:54] see then this is not well Peter learned
[1:17:57] or someone gave him an advice or he felt
[1:18:00] this this was the eternal God giving a
[1:18:03] direct movement of the Holy Ghost into
[1:18:07] Peter and Jesus said on this rock of
[1:18:12] Revelation I will build my church if
[1:18:15] he's still building his church if he's
[1:18:18] been building it from faith from Paul
[1:18:20] all the way up to the broad age then it
[1:18:23] has to be by divine revelation which is
[1:18:27] an act of God through the Holy Ghost to
[1:18:30] you and he's doing that so if God is
[1:18:35] going to be known he's going to be known
[1:18:37] he's going to be revealed from faith to
[1:18:39] faith he says now for therein is the
[1:18:43] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[1:18:45] to faith and is as it is as it is
[1:18:48] written the just shall live by faith
[1:18:51] may the Lord at his blessings for the
[1:18:53] reading of his Holy Word you may be
[1:18:54] seated so if the Lord will give us
[1:18:59] strength we want to speak on faces of
[1:19:02] Revelation I want to read from the
[1:19:05] message works his faith Express brother
[1:19:07] Brown says now now faith is a revelation
[1:19:10] from God now faith is a revelation he
[1:19:15] says he has revealed it to you by His
[1:19:20] grace so to have faith it takes the
[1:19:25] grace of God you can't have faith
[1:19:28] without God giving you faith he's going
[1:19:30] to say that here he says it's nothing
[1:19:32] you did
[1:19:34] you didn't work yourself up into faith
[1:19:37] you ever have faith it's give to you by
[1:19:41] the grace of God and God reveals it to
[1:19:46] you
[1:19:46] therefore faith is a revelation and the
[1:19:50] whole Church of God is built upon
[1:19:52] revelation he said now a Baptist
[1:19:54] minister told me not long ago he said I
[1:19:57] just can't accept revelation and I said
[1:19:59] then you cannot accept the Bible you
[1:20:02] cannot accept Christ because he is the
[1:20:05] revelation of God he's God revealed in
[1:20:09] flesh therefore the whole church is
[1:20:11] built upon divine revelation able by
[1:20:15] faith no Bible written in those days by
[1:20:19] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:20:21] excellent sacrifice than that which of
[1:20:24] Cain which God testified he was
[1:20:27] righteous how by faith by faith by a
[1:20:31] revelation Abel offered unto God a more
[1:20:34] excellent sacrifice because it was
[1:20:36] revealed to him that it was wasn't fruit
[1:20:39] of the field it was blood and that's why
[1:20:42] some people can believe it and some
[1:20:46] can't believe it and some tried to make
[1:20:49] believe it he says in an audience of
[1:20:51] people where prayer line comes - you'll
[1:20:54] find they were all good people will say
[1:20:57] they there's some that's trying hard to
[1:21:00] believe it they're trying to work
[1:21:02] themselves into it some just can't do it
[1:21:05] at all and others it's just by grace
[1:21:09] that it's just given to them now there
[1:21:13] is the difference see that does it
[1:21:15] that's a revelation because faith is a
[1:21:19] revelation from God it must be revealed
[1:21:23] first he says now I want to just stick
[1:21:26] on that just a moment because we we know
[1:21:29] so many scriptures that deals with faith
[1:21:32] the Bible says in Romans 10:17 that
[1:21:36] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:21:40] the Word of God you see but not ever
[1:21:44] one that has audible can hear and have
[1:21:48] faith this is a predestinated people
[1:21:52] that can hear the word of God and
[1:21:57] something deep inside of them moves them
[1:22:00] and they said I believe this and not
[1:22:05] only that I believe that this is
[1:22:06] speaking to me personally because the
[1:22:10] faith personalized the gospel in your
[1:22:13] life it comes and it changes your life
[1:22:16] it changes your desires it makes you a
[1:22:20] new creation and all of these things
[1:22:23] come by hearing so there's something in
[1:22:30] the hearing of a believer because by
[1:22:34] this hearing the Holy Ghost begins to
[1:22:37] lead our lives maybe there was some
[1:22:40] brothers or sisters here before you got
[1:22:42] saved maybe you were out in the world
[1:22:44] and you live worldly but when the gospel
[1:22:47] came across your path things that you
[1:22:50] used to do by revelation conviction come
[1:22:55] on your heart and you said I won't do
[1:22:57] those things anymore that came by
[1:23:01] hearing but there had to be a ground
[1:23:04] that was cultivated by the Holy Ghost to
[1:23:08] receive that seed word because if not
[1:23:12] then we just got emotion or we just got
[1:23:16] caught up in the moment but we just got
[1:23:19] conviction you see but there's a people
[1:23:22] who that that they're not trying to get
[1:23:25] faith they have come to a very uh a
[1:23:30] lineage of faith and that's why I listen
[1:23:33] I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:23:34] that's why we know that when Adam failed
[1:23:39] in the garden and he went after Eve and
[1:23:43] I have to say this you know these things
[1:23:46] already but because everything that Adam
[1:23:51] was and everything that Adam
[1:23:55] it comes from God because God said let
[1:23:59] us make man in our own image Adam was a
[1:24:02] byproduct of no one
[1:24:05] he was the direct creation of the very
[1:24:08] image of God he was a son of God he
[1:24:12] could not be deceived you see everything
[1:24:15] Adam had it come directly from God God
[1:24:19] was the umbilical cord to Adam you see
[1:24:23] so Adam his experience and when God told
[1:24:29] him Adam you named the creatures here
[1:24:35] Adam by revelation having the mind of
[1:24:39] God being so one with God that you could
[1:24:45] not separate God from Adam that's
[1:24:49] exactly right that's why God didn't say
[1:24:52] look Adam that Adam that's a lion right
[1:24:55] there so on look I asked you to name
[1:24:58] then that's all right here let me give
[1:25:01] you the boo here when you see the
[1:25:03] picture you just call out the names how
[1:25:06] he didn't do that when Adam said you're
[1:25:16] the Dove you're so meek and so clean so
[1:25:22] pure
[1:25:23] you're the Dove
[1:25:28] and you're a lamb and you're a lion he
[1:25:38] was watching their character and what
[1:25:42] they were displaying but even deeper
[1:25:45] than that
[1:25:46] these creatures that he named would
[1:25:49] become part of the very gospel of Jesus
[1:25:52] Christ because he would be the lion he
[1:25:55] would be the dog he would be the lamb so
[1:25:58] Adam went deeper than just naming
[1:26:00] animals he had the very long loss of God
[1:26:03] the very intentions the very desire of
[1:26:07] God was in him this is a great thing
[1:26:11] because we are the Bride of Christ this
[1:26:15] is a great
[1:26:15] so when Eve went out because all that
[1:26:20] was in God he poured into Adam see
[1:26:25] that's just like the threefold purpose
[1:26:27] all that God was he poured into Jesus
[1:26:31] Christ and so when we saw Christ we saw
[1:26:35] the father one day Philip said Lord show
[1:26:39] us the father and it will suffice us
[1:26:42] we'll be happy
[1:26:44] if you'll show us the father and he said
[1:26:47] Philip how long have I been with you and
[1:26:51] you haven't seen me he that hath seen me
[1:26:56] have seen the father
[1:26:59] because he wasn't the second person or
[1:27:02] the third person this was God himself
[1:27:05] the word in human flesh so when Eve went
[1:27:10] out because Christ is a savior and he
[1:27:14] carries the attribute of a savior
[1:27:16] because Christ would save his bride then
[1:27:19] all that Adam had from God was God a
[1:27:22] savior sure
[1:27:24] so Adam had the
[1:27:26] attribute of a savior in him so when Eve
[1:27:30] went out he had to go and save her
[1:27:32] because the attribute of a savior was in
[1:27:36] him listen now if the attribute of a
[1:27:40] savior and the attribute of God was an
[1:27:43] atom what will happen to a people that
[1:27:46] God would pour himself into would they
[1:27:50] not expressed God sure they would would
[1:27:54] they not do the works of God sure they
[1:27:57] will how thankful we are for these
[1:28:01] things this is not the Pentecostal age
[1:28:04] this is the broad age and we and you are
[1:28:07] the bride in the bride age you are the
[1:28:10] word in the word age and nothing is
[1:28:14] going to hinder and stop the faith of
[1:28:17] Jesus Christ in your heart you say
[1:28:20] hinder not hinder faith because faith
[1:28:23] has no hindrances remember brother
[1:28:26] Branham he talked about the sulfonation
[1:28:28] woman and a message called press
[1:28:30] evarin's and he said in that message
[1:28:32] that this woman had a daughter that was
[1:28:36] vexed with a devil and the woman said
[1:28:41] once she had heard that this great one
[1:28:45] had come and he was healing the people
[1:28:48] and because faith cometh by hearing she
[1:28:51] heard these things in her heart and
[1:28:54] faith rose up in her heart and said get
[1:28:58] to where he is at and your daughter
[1:29:00] would be made well and brother Brandon
[1:29:03] when he dramatizes it and the message
[1:29:05] pressive arrance he said that the woman
[1:29:08] said to her women friends said I'm going
[1:29:12] to go down and to this revival that
[1:29:15] they're having and they said sister you
[1:29:18] better not do that if you do that then
[1:29:21] we're going to kick you out of our
[1:29:22] sewing party you're going to be kicked
[1:29:25] out because that's a bunch of Holy
[1:29:26] Roller holy rollers she said I don't
[1:29:29] care about your sewing party I'm going
[1:29:31] my daughters vexed and so brother
[1:29:36] brother said he
[1:29:37] though she had hindrances faith has no
[1:29:41] hindrances because faith honors God and
[1:29:45] God on his faith you see so the Prophet
[1:29:49] said that here she was they said to her
[1:29:53] your husband he's a businessman and you
[1:29:57] know his business it's you know he'll
[1:30:00] lose his prestige and his contracting
[1:30:04] and you better in he'll divorce you
[1:30:08] he'll leave you and brother Brown she
[1:30:10] said she said well he leaves me or not
[1:30:12] I'm going then she went to her priest
[1:30:16] and he said now and brother Brown and he
[1:30:19] calls the woman he says I'm just gonna
[1:30:21] say her name's Lydia he said I hope
[1:30:24] there's no Lydia but if it is then good
[1:30:26] because I'm speaking positive of whoever
[1:30:28] this is Lydia he said then whoever Lydia
[1:30:32] was that night I'm sure she got blessed
[1:30:34] he said then Lydia who C went to her
[1:30:37] pass her priests and said you know my
[1:30:40] daughter's vexed with the devil and I
[1:30:42] know that this man he is the Christ and
[1:30:45] they said to her you know he said you've
[1:30:48] been in this church so many years and
[1:30:51] your your parents was in this church
[1:30:54] your papa and you know he was the godly
[1:30:57] old priest he said to her you know when
[1:31:01] your husband was unemployed who do you
[1:31:03] saying went down and helped him I was
[1:31:05] the one who went downhill and his church
[1:31:07] been helping you and your
[1:31:08] great-grandfather when he when he lost
[1:31:09] the land who went and stood in before
[1:31:11] the judge for he was no kind of reason
[1:31:16] at all said now if and you don't you
[1:31:22] know I'm I'm grateful so I'm father
[1:31:24] Solon's hope you know what this would do
[1:31:27] to my relationship with you and your
[1:31:29] family and she said are you finished yet
[1:31:34] because I'm going now it was a
[1:31:40] humanistic emotion that was drawing her
[1:31:44] faith was pulling her faith was bringing
[1:31:48] her into his presence what about your
[1:31:52] faith tonight anybody can say they
[1:31:55] believe the message of the hour anyone
[1:31:57] can say that
[1:31:58] but faith brother Brandon preached
[1:32:01] messes words his faith expressed then at
[1:32:04] the faith the holy faith of God is in
[1:32:08] you you will do the holy words of God
[1:32:10] and so she went and there he was the
[1:32:15] Lord Jesus and she as I said she was
[1:32:19] studying his approach how am I gonna get
[1:32:21] there all these people they're crying
[1:32:24] son of David and here she was a Greek of
[1:32:26] Gentile she had no representation you
[1:32:28] know these things you've read these many
[1:32:30] times in the mess she had no
[1:32:31] representation but she studied how can I
[1:32:34] see the people saying that son of David
[1:32:36] and there seems like he's giving them
[1:32:38] audience so she creeps other David have
[1:32:41] mercy upon me son of David have mercy
[1:32:43] upon me and the disciple looks at know
[1:32:46] what this Gentile saying summer day that
[1:32:49] they have no representation of some of
[1:32:51] David they Jim's out dogs this is a
[1:32:55] Greek woman so they said master master
[1:33:01] master so Jesus comes to and you know
[1:33:05] the story he said woman he says now
[1:33:12] woman you are of a different race
[1:33:16] you don't belong up here maybe he would
[1:33:20] have said woman you are of the black
[1:33:23] race and you don't belong here
[1:33:27] oh you prejudiced thing I'm going home I
[1:33:30] knew I shouldn't have come here in the
[1:33:32] first place
[1:33:36] but that's what he said you have a
[1:33:39] different race but faith had no
[1:33:44] hindrances faith knew its master and
[1:33:50] brother Brandon said faith agrees with
[1:33:53] the word so so he continues to ignore
[1:34:01] now you think in your own heart you come
[1:34:04] to get what you needed from Christ and
[1:34:07] then you get just because you get to
[1:34:10] wear his hat doesn't mean that you're
[1:34:13] going to get what you desire because
[1:34:15] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:34:18] God now you may have come out tonight
[1:34:21] with a need but just being at church
[1:34:24] will not answer that need only face
[1:34:28] direct faith can bring you into the
[1:34:31] presence of God and look right at the
[1:34:34] word and no matter what the hindrances
[1:34:36] are you're gonna stand right with the
[1:34:39] Lord look right with the Lord and say
[1:34:42] Lord you have exactly what I need and
[1:34:44] faith has brought me here and so there
[1:34:49] she was and he said listen woman it's
[1:34:59] not meant to take the children's bread
[1:35:05] I'm sent to the house of Israel to take
[1:35:11] the children's bread and give it to a
[1:35:15] dog what humiliation said you're of a
[1:35:27] different race and then drew the the
[1:35:30] card that the Jews say of the Gentiles
[1:35:34] dogs heathens
[1:35:39] but because faith had no hindrance now
[1:35:45] as we've already said if this was just
[1:35:48] something worked
[1:35:49] something trumped up something built up
[1:35:53] some emotion she would've been gone a
[1:35:56] long time ago but she's looking at him
[1:36:00] everything he said she said Lord brother
[1:36:03] Ram said she said Lord he said he was
[1:36:06] her Lord
[1:36:07] she said Lord but even the dogs eat the
[1:36:11] crime that fall from the Masters tail
[1:36:15] and Jesus said what great friend five to
[1:36:22] thee according to as you believe and the
[1:36:25] Bible says that very self-same our God
[1:36:32] brings us into his presence by his word
[1:36:35] and one day but if you can break into
[1:36:53] the the immortal the invisible God
[1:36:57] if you can break into that supernatural
[1:37:00] realm then you won't even on me but you
[1:37:03] will touch Jesus Christ that's not an
[1:37:06] emotional statement that's the faith of
[1:37:09] the broad but we have been so Church
[1:37:14] eyes we have been so program that when
[1:37:18] we come to a sudden I'm not talking
[1:37:20] about you I'm saying as a hold we've
[1:37:22] been so programmed that when we come we
[1:37:26] say well okay Thursday night or
[1:37:29] Wednesday night or Sunday and yes you
[1:37:32] believe the message but it's more than
[1:37:34] that
[1:37:35] now listen now when God by your
[1:37:39] experiences has been building you up on
[1:37:44] the most holy faith when we look in the
[1:37:48] scriptures because the Scriptures they
[1:37:51] are they are a teacher to us a
[1:37:55] schoolmaster
[1:37:57] they teach us and when we look at the
[1:38:01] different ones to look at David in the
[1:38:03] script and we all know the account with
[1:38:06] David and Goliath now no one in this
[1:38:09] room can convince me that Saul did not
[1:38:14] believe in God
[1:38:16] and so when David come up to the battle
[1:38:19] there was saw there was armies of Israel
[1:38:23] they knew the books of Moses they knew
[1:38:30] that God had told Abraham thy seed shall
[1:38:34] possess the gates of the enemy they knew
[1:38:39] he was Jehovah Jireh by the experiences
[1:38:44] that God had given you see and so here
[1:38:49] they are
[1:38:50] you know David goes up to the battle and
[1:38:53] he says you know and as well what's
[1:38:57] going on up here and his brother said to
[1:38:59] him look you need to get back home boy
[1:39:02] don't you know we fighting the battle
[1:39:04] here and David said I don't see anybody
[1:39:08] probably nothing they said look you just
[1:39:11] want to come up here to see the battle
[1:39:12] he said well what am I see the only
[1:39:16] thing I'm seeing it's people still
[1:39:18] saying that brother Branham was a
[1:39:21] prophet and we believed the message and
[1:39:30] we know that this is true and no one can
[1:39:33] convince us as false but but the devil
[1:39:40] was still holding them at bay what the
[1:39:44] fullness of the revelation of Jesus
[1:39:47] Christ and the fullness of Calvary being
[1:39:50] made known the opening of the seals
[1:39:53] something has
[1:39:54] to take place because from December the
[1:39:59] 24th 1965 to July the 27th 2017 what has
[1:40:10] God been doing he's been doing great
[1:40:14] things so you know the store we're not
[1:40:18] going to get into that so we can get
[1:40:20] back to the message but David said to
[1:40:22] Saul and that whole army of believers
[1:40:25] message believers said Saul I believe in
[1:40:34] Malachi 4:2 in Luke 1730 revelation 2:10
[1:40:38] 7 and also I know that my name is in the
[1:40:44] book because it's going to take those
[1:40:48] seven thunders and the thunder is the
[1:40:52] voice of God when the seal is open it is
[1:40:55] bringing back and showing the broad that
[1:40:58] she has an abstract title deed to
[1:41:01] everything that lost that's the only
[1:41:04] reason that the mommy angel descended
[1:41:07] it's because there were names in the
[1:41:09] ball and he was going to descend with
[1:41:12] the living descendants of Abraham and
[1:41:15] show them their name in the book and by
[1:41:18] seeing the revelation of the word of God
[1:41:21] in their life not by going to a church
[1:41:23] not by some good preacher but because
[1:41:26] they would see their name written in the
[1:41:29] Lamb's Book of Life by the mystery that
[1:41:31] was being revealed in that hour they
[1:41:34] would withstand Satan and become an
[1:41:37] overcomer of the day that they lived in
[1:41:42] so all of them believed so Saul do you
[1:41:46] believe that Jehovah Jireh that that
[1:41:50] Jehovah nice Jehovah Nissi the Lord our
[1:41:55] banner do you believe that he is Jehovah
[1:41:58] of hosts is he the Lord of hosts is he
[1:42:02] the lord of the great armies
[1:42:04] so yeah yes we believe that but they did
[1:42:11] not have a divine revelation from God
[1:42:16] the only person that day that had a
[1:42:20] divine revelation from God was David
[1:42:24] because David by his experiences God had
[1:42:29] raised him up by the word and he could
[1:42:32] look back and point them to God in his
[1:42:35] life because your experiences are
[1:42:38] nothing that it's not something that's
[1:42:40] educated into you
[1:42:42] it's predestinated into you by the hand
[1:42:45] of God the Holy Ghost is not something
[1:42:48] that schooled into you
[1:42:50] it's predestinated and the Prophet said
[1:42:52] that God knew before the foundation of
[1:42:54] the world that you would want that Holy
[1:42:57] Ghost and predestinated that Holy Ghost
[1:43:00] to you so this one out of all those
[1:43:03] message believers he had a direct
[1:43:06] revelation from God
[1:43:08] now what if he would have went out there
[1:43:10] enthused if he'll do went out there when
[1:43:14] you know the story when Goliath saw
[1:43:16] David he said these people crazy they
[1:43:22] must think I'm a dog go I said I know
[1:43:27] these people have mental problems
[1:43:29] because we're gonna send a little kid to
[1:43:32] fight me these people mentally deranged
[1:43:36] they must be crazy
[1:43:40] these Jews crazy they don't know a
[1:43:44] little boy they must think I'm a dog I'm
[1:43:53] gonna have his head the lines weren't
[1:43:57] even looking at David like nothing like
[1:43:59] the devil look at you like you mean that
[1:44:01] that little teenage girl she gonna
[1:44:03] withstand me yes that's right you mean
[1:44:11] that little chow
[1:44:12] what that childlike faith he doesn't
[1:44:15] know even he can't even quote a lot of
[1:44:18] Scripture it's not that it's not quoting
[1:44:21] a lot of script it's the measure of
[1:44:25] faith the measure of the revelation that
[1:44:30] God has made himself real in your life
[1:44:33] and you operate on that not just for God
[1:44:39] so loved the world he gave it you you
[1:44:41] know that - but you operating mom and
[1:44:44] daddy you remember we prayed and God did
[1:44:46] that miracle
[1:44:47] I believe that same God with us mom and
[1:44:50] daddy so the experience is that David
[1:44:56] had these experiences by the word David
[1:44:59] said this God when I was on the backside
[1:45:01] of the desert and I had those seven
[1:45:03] sheep because seven represents the seven
[1:45:06] church ages and the greater David who
[1:45:08] was Christ would have a bride that he
[1:45:10] would protect through the seven church
[1:45:12] ages from the bear from the lion from
[1:45:15] the dragon from the Beast
[1:45:17] every creature then David would say you
[1:45:22] know the Lion King and God delivered me
[1:45:27] from the paw of the lion and he
[1:45:30] delivered me from the paw of the bear
[1:45:33] and because I have a divine revelation
[1:45:37] of what the word has made me in Christ
[1:45:43] because what Malachi for preach what
[1:45:47] brother Branham preached I am I am the
[1:45:52] manifestation of his ministry that
[1:45:55] continues own the Word made flesh what
[1:46:02] the prophet preached has become flesh in
[1:46:05] the people and so David went out with
[1:46:09] that slingshot those five stones of
[1:46:12] grace
[1:46:18] and then he took his sword and he cut
[1:46:23] the head and he went home dragging the
[1:46:29] head of Goliath victory victory why
[1:46:35] because faith is a revelation it's not
[1:46:41] just well I believe it praise God I
[1:46:43] believe if you believe and act upon it I
[1:46:46] told it and the Holy Ghost the leader of
[1:46:51] the bride the Holy Ghost that connects
[1:46:54] you to your theophany and that the often
[1:46:57] it takes you to the glorified body then
[1:47:00] that Holy Ghost has to connect you to
[1:47:03] the word that you bypassed so faith it's
[1:47:08] not something you worked up faith is
[1:47:11] coming to you from the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:14] faith is coming to you from the
[1:47:17] theophany word that you bypass because
[1:47:21] that word has come back to get you thank
[1:47:27] you Lord in that wonderful it's brother
[1:47:32] brother said when the word of God
[1:47:33] becomes eagle food to you then you have
[1:47:35] heard from your theophany you have then
[1:47:39] been formed into the living image of the
[1:47:42] Living God
[1:47:43] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:46] connects you to your theophany and your
[1:47:49] drawing from the house of God because
[1:47:53] that's the Alpha T is your word
[1:47:56] representation what you and I bypass
[1:47:58] that we could come here to be tried and
[1:48:01] tested but when trying and testing is
[1:48:04] over then he brings that word to you and
[1:48:09] forms who builds you up into the real
[1:48:13] you not the you that mommy and daddy
[1:48:16] brought but
[1:48:18] one that your spiritual father God
[1:48:20] because when the seals were open the
[1:48:23] gene of your spiritual life had been
[1:48:26] locked up in God's Word the gene of your
[1:48:29] natural life was in your natural father
[1:48:32] but the gene of your spiritual life was
[1:48:35] locked up in those seven seals but when
[1:48:37] the seals were opened then your name
[1:48:40] came into view and the gene that was in
[1:48:43] the word of you gave birth to you in
[1:48:46] this hour that's exactly right so we're
[1:48:51] not just saying well I'm gonna have this
[1:48:53] faith I'm gonna take this faith I'm
[1:48:55] gonna do this with it's the leadership
[1:48:58] of the Holy Ghost leading you god-given
[1:49:04] experiences god-given testimonies you
[1:49:09] say Lord because your word has been
[1:49:12] birth in my soul everywhere I go you're
[1:49:17] with me because that word has been
[1:49:20] birthed when I get in my car he's in my
[1:49:22] car because he's in me when I go when
[1:49:26] you go to the store sister's he's in you
[1:49:29] he's been birth in you he can never
[1:49:31] leave you the the gene of your spiritual
[1:49:34] I have given birth the real you so you
[1:49:36] can never go anywhere else without God
[1:49:39] going with you everywhere you go when
[1:49:43] you came when you came to church tonight
[1:49:44] you brought him here with you when you
[1:49:47] go home he gonna go with you brother
[1:49:50] Chad when you at work driving that truck
[1:49:52] he right there in you everywhere you go
[1:49:54] he right there in you because he has
[1:49:57] been burnt in you then how can he
[1:49:59] separate from you when he has give
[1:50:01] new life and quickened the C gene of
[1:50:05] life in your heart you see that's the
[1:50:08] rapturing faith as a prophet of God said
[1:50:12] he says it this way he says now
[1:50:16] everything that you need in your earthly
[1:50:19] journey is in you from the baptism of
[1:50:22] the Holy Ghost and he says even the
[1:50:25] rapture and the next sentence he says
[1:50:28] don't resent that because the rapture is
[1:50:32] in you that rapture is in you because
[1:50:39] the rapture is that word of God so
[1:50:44] you're not looking for something to come
[1:50:46] in the future you're just looking at the
[1:50:49] Word of God unfold itself in your life
[1:50:53] see but many times people think well the
[1:50:57] rat one day I'm gonna be walking and
[1:50:59] there something hit me on the head
[1:51:01] brother jerem
[1:51:02] that that was the rapture no don't come
[1:51:05] that way it grows up in you like the
[1:51:10] statute like the gene of God growing up
[1:51:14] into you because the only man that will
[1:51:18] go in the rapture is the stature of a
[1:51:21] perfect man a good man ain't going in
[1:51:24] the rapture a perfect man and that
[1:51:27] perfect man has been growing in you
[1:51:30] because this is the gene of God the very
[1:51:34] DNA of God growing up in you and you'll
[1:51:38] never find anywhere in the scripture
[1:51:40] that something's going to come to you
[1:51:43] from from out in space and that's why we
[1:51:48] said and the Bible says and the Prophet
[1:51:52] says that that Holy Ghost in you the
[1:51:57] Holy Ghost in you is leading you to the
[1:52:02] glorification and he's taking you from
[1:52:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:52:07] have the quote here tonight in the
[1:52:09] sealed e-book to ask brother Branham
[1:52:11] brother Brown please explain the
[1:52:12] translation of the bride
[1:52:14] he says now it's just a change and he
[1:52:16] says now I want to say that it's only to
[1:52:22] the believer and then he goes home he
[1:52:25] says now the same word that changed
[1:52:28] Abraham and Sarah that that word
[1:52:35] materialized around their born-again
[1:52:38] experience and he says around that
[1:52:41] born-again experience there is a body
[1:52:43] being formed a body being formed you
[1:52:48] mean my Christian journey is bringing a
[1:52:52] body that's being formed around my
[1:52:56] born-again experience is that the reason
[1:52:59] I hunger and thirst like a pregnant
[1:53:02] woman who wants to have that body to be
[1:53:05] a perfect body and cry to her husband
[1:53:08] husband you're going to have to go and
[1:53:12] get means some millon you're gonna have
[1:53:16] to go get me some bananas you're gonna
[1:53:18] have to go get me some potatoes
[1:53:20] sweetheart don't you know it's 3 o'clock
[1:53:23] in the morning I don't care I got to
[1:53:27] have it I'm craving for it and you
[1:53:34] craving for the word what brought the
[1:53:37] Craven because there is a lard body
[1:53:41] that's being fun around your born-again
[1:53:45] experience not what not what you trying
[1:53:48] to work up look what I worked up look
[1:53:50] what I got brother Gerald look what I am
[1:53:52] like no no all these things were
[1:53:57] predestined by the hand of God he does
[1:54:02] those things let's go to Galatians
[1:54:03] chapter 2 real quick now it's going on
[1:54:07] it's about a quarter till nine I don't
[1:54:10] want to wear yet sir long did it came in
[1:54:14] and thank you God bless I was just
[1:54:17] waiting on somebody there
[1:54:20] but-but-but I'm not gonna try to wait
[1:54:22] because I'm not that no I'm not that
[1:54:24] kind but but but you're feeding on the
[1:54:26] word and I'll see your faith as Paul
[1:54:30] says I am crucified with Christ and yet
[1:54:35] I live not live not live but Christ
[1:54:42] lives in me then I live by the faith of
[1:54:47] the Son of God every one when you read
[1:54:51] Hebrews chapter 11 and go through the he
[1:54:55] the Hall of faith starting a table by
[1:54:59] faith until the end were Paul says
[1:55:02] without us they cannot be made perfect
[1:55:04] there was only one faith that was the
[1:55:07] faith of the Son of God never did you
[1:55:12] read verse 8 never come over that faith
[1:55:14] because he could never come over that
[1:55:17] faith because this is God and the
[1:55:22] message super since brother Branham said
[1:55:25] no everyone can have that super sense it
[1:55:27] only belongs to the believers and he
[1:55:31] said that super since it's the Holy
[1:55:33] Ghost in Galatians chapter 3 and you
[1:55:39] know Paul was dealing with these
[1:55:40] Galatians who were falling back into
[1:55:43] words and legalism and we're thankful
[1:55:47] that the Holy Spirit has come in this
[1:55:51] hour crying grace grace the capstone
[1:55:54] when it come down and United and the
[1:55:56] capstone has united with the bride when
[1:56:00] it came down crying it did not crawl cry
[1:56:03] law legalism it cried grace grace unto
[1:56:09] it you see then this message that we
[1:56:14] have is a message of grace we are
[1:56:18] justified by faith we are kept by faith
[1:56:22] the whole the whole foundation of the
[1:56:26] Christian is faith
[1:56:29] you see not by the works of the law so
[1:56:32] we see here the the Galatians you know
[1:56:34] these things the Galatians had begin to
[1:56:37] fall back
[1:56:38] others have began to tell them and bring
[1:56:41] a bad report just like those 10 spies in
[1:56:47] the days of Joshua in the days of Moses
[1:56:50] went in spies 12 spies came back those
[1:56:55] 10 spies brought a bad report to the
[1:56:58] people and said we're grasshoppers we
[1:57:00] can never make it
[1:57:01] we the circumstances is too great but
[1:57:04] remember when faith finds its bedding
[1:57:09] ground no circumstance will be
[1:57:11] considered and so when they come back
[1:57:15] with a bad report say I don't know if we
[1:57:17] can make it who were grasshoppers and
[1:57:19] these are giants they brought a bad
[1:57:22] report just like these that were in the
[1:57:26] book of Galatians after Paul had
[1:57:28] established them in the present-day
[1:57:30] truth and brought the reality of the
[1:57:33] gospel to them others begin to take them
[1:57:36] back into legalism and Paul begins to
[1:57:39] deal with that you see because we're not
[1:57:42] going back into legalism our
[1:57:45] self-righteousness he is our
[1:57:48] righteousness he is our peace
[1:57:51] he is our justification and I asked you
[1:57:54] tonight would there be anyone in the
[1:57:56] house to say Andre I'm satisfied with
[1:57:59] just my own righteousness then I would
[1:58:01] have to tell you what Peter said our
[1:58:04] righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:58:07] if they're not even approached the
[1:58:09] Living God except he made provisions and
[1:58:13] he made a way for us to know God's
[1:58:16] provided place of worship see it would
[1:58:20] take God to do these things and we're
[1:58:23] standing not on our merits but we're
[1:58:26] resting on his marriage
[1:58:28] so Paul began to speak to them on the
[1:58:31] hearing of faith and how important it is
[1:58:34] that we hear these things with our
[1:58:37] spiritual ear
[1:58:39] Paul says here now I'm not even going to
[1:58:44] read verse one we're gonna reverse to
[1:58:46] this only what I learn of you received
[1:58:50] the spirit that's capitalist by the
[1:58:54] works of the law or by the hearing of
[1:58:58] faith he's saying to them did you
[1:59:01] receive the Holy Ghost by the good words
[1:59:04] was it good works that brought you the
[1:59:06] Holy Ghost or was it the hearing of
[1:59:10] faith because you have representation in
[1:59:13] God before the foundation of the world
[1:59:16] and can hear what the Spirit is saying
[1:59:18] so did you did you receive anything did
[1:59:22] you receive anything from God because
[1:59:25] you worked no you have never received
[1:59:29] anything from God because you worked in
[1:59:32] what's a good Christian forget it
[1:59:34] it's His grace and mercy so Paul says
[1:59:42] verse three are ye so foolish having
[1:59:45] begun in the spirit capital S are you
[1:59:49] now made perfect by the flesh have he
[1:59:52] suffered so many things in vain if it be
[1:59:56] yet in vain he therefore that Minister
[2:00:01] you the Spirit he says the the ministry
[2:00:04] that ministered the spirit and worketh
[2:00:07] miracles among you does he do it by
[2:00:10] words is it by his own words that he's
[2:00:14] doing this Oh
[2:00:15] or by the hearing of faith now I'm
[2:00:19] saying those things because in our first
[2:00:22] birth even though we did not come the
[2:00:25] right way we came and we got here we got
[2:00:34] here even though we bypassed our
[2:00:36] theophany we got here even though we
[2:00:39] come to essential birth we got here even
[2:00:43] though we may have come to a mixed
[2:00:44] chromosome in DNA but we got here and
[2:00:49] because we got here God would bring the
[2:00:53] correct divine order to you and I
[2:00:55] because the the perfect will of God
[2:00:58] you would have not come to a sexual
[2:01:01] desire you would have come by the word
[2:01:03] the spoken word is the original seed he
[2:01:07] would have said brother Chad come forth
[2:01:09] and you have raised up and came forth
[2:01:12] and so God who is perfect in his ways
[2:01:19] when he deals with his family now he's
[2:01:22] not dealing on the permissive room he's
[2:01:25] bringing his perfect order to his
[2:01:28] perfect blood by his perfect word
[2:01:31] through perfect faith that's right thank
[2:01:36] you Lord listen now let's go and read
[2:01:38] this a little bit more verse 6 even as
[2:01:42] abraham believed God and it was
[2:01:45] accounted to him for righteousness
[2:01:49] know ye therefore that they which are of
[2:01:52] faith the same are the children of
[2:01:57] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[2:02:00] that God would justify the heathen
[2:02:03] that's us through faith preached be
[2:02:07] preached before the gut preached the
[2:02:10] gospel unto Abraham did he preach the
[2:02:13] gospel time around
[2:02:14] surely he did when he began to unfold
[2:02:17] himself as melt
[2:02:19] patek else a di l know him he was
[2:02:23] preaching the gospel there Melchisedec
[2:02:25] came with bread and wine was he's not
[2:02:29] preaching the gospel he was pointing to
[2:02:31] the broken body of Jesus Christ sure he
[2:02:35] was he says now so then so so then they
[2:02:43] which be of faith are blessed with
[2:02:48] faithful Abraham I had to read that
[2:02:51] because my brother's sister you are
[2:02:53] blessed with Abraham because you are his
[2:02:59] seed now I hate to have you turn but
[2:03:02] let's let's turn over to Romans chapter
[2:03:04] 4 Romans chapter 4 starting at verse 1
[2:03:19] you said well brother hungry no no it's
[2:03:21] your fault you're pulling on the word
[2:03:22] I'm just your servant I'm just your
[2:03:25] service verse 1 Romans chapter 4 verse 1
[2:03:30] what shall we say then that Abraham
[2:03:33] that's Romans chapter 4 verse 1 what
[2:03:36] shall we say then that Abraham our
[2:03:38] Father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[2:03:41] found for if Abraham were justified by
[2:03:46] works he hath whereof to glory but not
[2:03:51] of God so I saying let me let me finish
[2:03:55] her in other words for what saith the
[2:03:57] scripture abraham believed god and it
[2:04:00] was counted unto him for righteousness
[2:04:02] now to him that worketh is the reward
[2:04:06] not reckoned of grace but of debt so so
[2:04:10] Paul he goes into this because he wants
[2:04:13] to show the believer through Abraham and
[2:04:17] it was important that he show us through
[2:04:20] Abraham because after the fall in the
[2:04:23] garden God and after the noetic flow
[2:04:27] God began to look for a man that he
[2:04:31] could bring his race through because
[2:04:37] Adam the book of Redemption had went
[2:04:40] from Adam and those whose names were in
[2:04:43] that Lamb's Book in the book of
[2:04:45] redemption it had went that book had
[2:04:48] went back to the original owner God
[2:04:50] himself but God was looking to find
[2:04:54] someone that he could reintroduce faith
[2:04:58] and bring his seed through that person
[2:05:04] God chose Abraham and that's why the
[2:05:08] meeting that's why Melchizedek had to
[2:05:11] come that who was priest and king and
[2:05:15] have communion with Abraham because God
[2:05:18] was reintroducing faith and a race of
[2:05:23] people that could only come by faith
[2:05:26] that's why we're not looking at
[2:05:28] Abraham's natural seed it's the faith
[2:05:31] seed of Abraham you see so from the from
[2:05:37] God introducing faith to Abraham that
[2:05:42] faith went from Abraham Isaac Jacob
[2:05:47] Joseph Moses Joshua and on down until
[2:05:56] that seed become flesh in Jesus Christ
[2:06:00] who was the faith seed of Abraham he was
[2:06:03] the beginning of a new race of faith
[2:06:06] race and through that incarnation of the
[2:06:12] word through that through the faith of
[2:06:15] Jesus Christ him being the firstborn
[2:06:18] among many brethren all those that would
[2:06:22] come to Christ in this last hour and in
[2:06:26] every hour of the church ages had to
[2:06:29] come by faith
[2:06:31] because this is a race of faith they are
[2:06:39] faith people not not like the
[2:06:43] denominator they call this a faith based
[2:06:45] are you gonna be faith based if you
[2:06:47] didn't come from Melchizedek because the
[2:06:50] priesthood of Melchisedec is not like
[2:06:54] the priesthood of Aaron the Aaron Aaron
[2:06:57] priesthood through Levite was under a
[2:07:01] carnal commandment in other words it was
[2:07:04] trying to make people born in sin live a
[2:07:09] holy word and they could not do it so
[2:07:14] Aaron of Levi officiated over that kind
[2:07:18] of priesthood or every year he had to
[2:07:21] come to the the atonement every year he
[2:07:25] had to offer the sacrifice every year
[2:07:29] and of all the millions and millions and
[2:07:32] millions of lambs and lambs and
[2:07:35] Bullock's
[2:07:35] and doves and escaped goats and oil and
[2:07:38] all in all not one drop of blood ever
[2:07:43] forgave any sin no but who came by the
[2:07:54] flesh tried to take a perfect law and
[2:07:57] apply that to people who were born under
[2:08:01] seeing could not do it could not make
[2:08:06] the worshiper perfect but Melchizedek
[2:08:10] who was a priest of the Most High God
[2:08:14] not over carnality no rifice who claim
[2:08:18] from a pinnacle the New Jerusalem he
[2:08:22] having terrible subject
[2:08:24] in himself and he would officiate over
[2:08:27] him and he would come once and once
[2:08:31] forever and bring them to him spell in
[2:08:34] the Bible says how blessed Christ is
[2:08:37] because he is after the order of
[2:08:39] Melchisedec he's he's a high priest of a
[2:08:48] race that before the world was ever made
[2:08:52] and he bring in faith civilization back
[2:08:59] to his people in this hour and the just
[2:09:02] shall live by faith walk by faith judged
[2:09:08] by faith live by faith just a little bit
[2:09:11] more now let's turn over
[2:09:13] let me just read these couple of things
[2:09:16] and then we'll close but we certainly
[2:09:17] appreciate your patience with us tonight
[2:09:19] oh my it's just wonderful when we begin
[2:09:23] to look into the Holy Word of God and to
[2:09:25] see what God has made you in Christ
[2:09:29] before the foundation of the world and
[2:09:32] that's why the opening of these things
[2:09:34] brother Branham he talked about going
[2:09:37] over beyond the curtain of time in the
[2:09:39] seals but in the seals he never began to
[2:09:42] bring the ministry of Melchizedek
[2:09:44] you see and you go back and you check me
[2:09:46] out on the Seventh Seal when brother
[2:09:48] Branham he preaches he said now he said
[2:09:52] I was waiting for someone to stand up
[2:09:54] and tell me they saw what was happening
[2:09:55] all this week he said what was it he
[2:09:59] said it was the angel of the Lord the
[2:10:02] Holy Ghost
[2:10:02] he said now it's gone from you the
[2:10:06] revelation of the seals
[2:10:07] he said it's gone from you but again you
[2:10:12] go back and read around the time of the
[2:10:15] coming of the Lord these things he
[2:10:19] called it another cycle and that would
[2:10:23] be the cycle that God would have that
[2:10:25] seed on the earth that could receive
[2:10:28] those things that he preached and that
[2:10:31] week of the seals they would receive
[2:10:34] those things by the Holy Ghost because
[2:10:36] it's not been a
[2:10:37] it's God it's God and so now in this
[2:10:44] season where the bride we are in the
[2:10:46] season of the bride's revival these
[2:10:49] things that you hear and that your press
[2:10:51] have been preaching this broad material
[2:10:54] here for the bride's revival so if
[2:10:57] somebody said well I'm looking for the
[2:10:59] bridal revival when the squeeze comes
[2:11:01] that's going to bring the no no no no no
[2:11:03] brother Brown said national force listen
[2:11:05] to me now
[2:11:06] he said national force put Israel in her
[2:11:09] homeland and national force will put the
[2:11:13] churches in the world Council but he
[2:11:16] says it takes the power of God to put
[2:11:19] the people in the rapture
[2:11:21] so it's not gonna be national for you're
[2:11:23] not gonna say well when they come in and
[2:11:25] shut the door down then I'm gonna have
[2:11:27] faith in if you didn't have faith in God
[2:11:31] before the foundation of the world
[2:11:32] you ain't go get it then because your
[2:11:34] only manifest in the faith that's in you
[2:11:36] faith lays in the bride revelation lays
[2:11:40] in the bride you see that's in you by
[2:11:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:11:44] material that God is revealing to you
[2:11:47] that's already in you just like the
[2:11:49] natural Sun controls all botany life the
[2:11:52] son of God in this third pool what was
[2:11:55] the third pool it was to go back and
[2:11:58] bring the life from the seed that was
[2:12:01] already planted so he's not going to go
[2:12:08] back and quick and denominational crease
[2:12:10] and ideas and dogma and doctrine and
[2:12:12] we're not a group that believes that
[2:12:14] brother Brown has come back right see a
[2:12:17] lot of group I dare say brother Brandon
[2:12:18] didn't finish it he got to come back but
[2:12:20] but that's not awesome
[2:12:22] we've been laid by the Holy Ghost we
[2:12:26] know who the great one is it is the Lord
[2:12:27] Jesus Christ
[2:12:30] we know he's leading the bride see and
[2:12:34] when brother Brandon was finished with
[2:12:36] his work when that faithful servant was
[2:12:37] finished with his work then God took his
[2:12:39] man but you're here though you're here
[2:12:46] because you were to catch that word and
[2:12:49] God through your new birth giving you
[2:12:54] experiences by the word and I know
[2:12:57] everyone in here you have your
[2:12:58] experiences build on those experience
[2:13:01] god-given experience testify those
[2:13:04] things said Lord Lord you're calling me
[2:13:07] in this hour I'm being drawn by your
[2:13:09] word Lord I know who I am Lord I'm
[2:13:12] taking time now to see what you say Who
[2:13:14] I am in the word Lord and your word says
[2:13:17] that on your bride Lord and your word
[2:13:19] says that the bride is the word is in
[2:13:21] the bride and the mind of Christ and she
[2:13:24] won't move until she has the say the
[2:13:25] Lord and the said the Lord is the
[2:13:27] message of the hour and your prophet
[2:13:29] said that the bride would have a seven
[2:13:31] thunder revival and the seven thunders
[2:13:32] is the message of this hour that's what
[2:13:35] it is not something to come not in some
[2:13:37] new education some new modified seminary
[2:13:41] taught no no no it's the message of the
[2:13:44] hour it's God in simplicity but it's God
[2:13:49] in reality though and so the Prophet
[2:13:53] said this and we close on this let me
[2:13:56] read a couple of places here in the
[2:13:58] scripture and the message of the hour
[2:14:01] brother Branham says in a message
[2:14:03] spiritual food in due season he says I
[2:14:07] want you to get built up now in the Holy
[2:14:10] Oracles of God in the faith the faith of
[2:14:16] this hour the faith it's going to take
[2:14:20] more faith than ever was in any age for
[2:14:24] this has to be rapturing faith be taken
[2:14:30] up he says in a message rapture I love
[2:14:34] this one here he says if you if you if
[2:14:36] you've got eternal life
[2:14:38] you were in God before there ever was a
[2:14:43] world you are a part a son of God an
[2:14:49] attribute of God he know the very age
[2:14:54] you were coming he predestinated you to
[2:14:59] this age see to that age to take that
[2:15:05] place and no one can take it no one can
[2:15:11] take your place no one that's your place
[2:15:16] that's yours no one can take that the
[2:15:23] the mister is not even finished without
[2:15:25] you taking your place because the bride
[2:15:27] is the end of the mystery she is his
[2:15:30] victory let me finish now
[2:15:33] he said now he says care how many
[2:15:37] impersonations and things you've got to
[2:15:40] be there because he knew you would be
[2:15:43] there now you are made manifest
[2:15:47] now you can fellowship with him my
[2:15:51] brother says that's what God wants the
[2:15:55] the gospel didn't come to make us just
[2:15:59] mechanical robots God wants fellowship
[2:16:06] God want to come and say how you doing
[2:16:08] today you say father Oh father I'm doing
[2:16:12] I'm doing fine with your presence with
[2:16:14] me Lord God God wants us to talk to him
[2:16:20] now
[2:16:21] oh no well I gotta get down I gotta get
[2:16:24] down and pray now see now you know there
[2:16:29] my wife there I love her
[2:16:32] and sometimes I don't spend enough time
[2:16:34] with I know that's right sometimes
[2:16:37] she'll tell you I get in my study or
[2:16:39] when I'm seeking the mind of God
[2:16:40] different things and then sometimes
[2:16:43] he'll say like you don't hardly ever
[2:16:45] spend enough time with me you'll never
[2:16:47] talk to me but when you go to the Church
[2:16:49] of your preacher people talk to them you
[2:16:51] ever talk to me I'm telling them myself
[2:16:55] but that's true brother but she knows
[2:17:00] that it's not because I don't want to
[2:17:02] ignore her it it's because sometimes I
[2:17:07] get caught up in things and then I
[2:17:09] realize and I said hold on and then i
[2:17:12] say sweet
[2:17:13] i'll call my wife sweet i said sweet
[2:17:16] then i'll start asking because my wife
[2:17:18] she does alot she so she cooks she makes
[2:17:21] things she she done told herself three
[2:17:23] or four languages she plays a good tour
[2:17:24] Quattro for all that and i'm so then
[2:17:28] when i begin to show interest in her see
[2:17:31] then I begin to tell I could begin to
[2:17:35] say this to Lord Lord I'm sorry Lord
[2:17:38] what a wonderful wife you giving me Lord
[2:17:40] I don't know what I would do without my
[2:17:43] wife Lord enough and then then that has
[2:17:47] to spill over and I go to her and I tell
[2:17:50] us we I couldn't make it without you you
[2:17:54] know God knew all of my faults failure
[2:17:58] frailties and all that so then then I
[2:18:03] kind of get lined up you know then I'm
[2:18:06] back talking to my wife but it wasn't
[2:18:08] like I didn't want to talk to it and if
[2:18:10] you don't want talk to you why
[2:18:12] then you need talk to her
[2:18:19] so so but but if it ever comes in and
[2:18:24] you know people been married different
[2:18:27] times and you go through certain seas
[2:18:28] and different things like that but don't
[2:18:31] ever be that no I'm just tired of
[2:18:35] talking to her she always want to talk
[2:18:37] all the time ain't got time to talk to
[2:18:38] her don't you see I'm busy what you
[2:18:41] doing I'm busy woman you see I'm busy
[2:18:44] don't you see yeah I'm just I'm being
[2:18:51] like that that's true through them but
[2:18:54] but see that could be sometimes we doing
[2:18:57] the lord like that to say lord let me
[2:19:01] hurry up and prayed in god I love you in
[2:19:03] Jesus name em I gotta go y'all
[2:19:10] understand where I'm coming so what if
[2:19:14] so what what mean what if you want to
[2:19:17] talk you say honey I've been working all
[2:19:21] day I've been thinking about what
[2:19:23] brother Andre said and I want to talk no
[2:19:26] I'm I'm being sitting down don't talk to
[2:19:27] my busy and you don't work it up all day
[2:19:30] you're waiting to get home tells you why
[2:19:32] she's there no I'm busy
[2:19:33] you see I'm someone ain't got time for
[2:19:35] that tell me later you'd be like well
[2:19:37] I'll tell you what I want but sometimes
[2:19:41] I'm just saying this sometimes really
[2:19:46] Christianity becomes religion and we
[2:19:50] don't want religion but this this God
[2:19:55] this great god of the love and mercy a
[2:19:59] God who is rich in mercy a god who's not
[2:20:03] going to lose you you're not gonna be
[2:20:04] lost you save your Christians your
[2:20:07] believers he loves you but that God
[2:20:10] wants fellowship you know what you say
[2:20:14] well y'all know this quote I got called
[2:20:16] this I am yeah yeah that's fine that has
[2:20:18] this place but this God wants to talk
[2:20:22] with you
[2:20:24] he wants you to talk to him he wants you
[2:20:28] to listen to him he wants you to read
[2:20:31] his word now you know a mechanical thing
[2:20:36] you can do wine it up like a robot you'd
[2:20:39] you want they wanna stop like no I gotta
[2:20:45] do it wine it up again
[2:20:46] God don't want that kind of Chris
[2:20:49] where's it man
[2:20:50] I gotta wind him up again god he's a
[2:20:54] real purse and and the message and all
[2:21:00] these things is so that he could bring
[2:21:05] fellowship you and him and then he makes
[2:21:11] us a godly jealous because he shows us
[2:21:14] with his prophet and their brother
[2:21:16] branham is and God comes down and
[2:21:18] brother Bram speaks to the storm
[2:21:19] different things God's Hill and then God
[2:21:21] says how would you like to walk with me
[2:21:23] and then we read those things and said
[2:21:26] man why God asks brother Brendan walk
[2:21:30] with him
[2:21:31] I want what we got him I want him to
[2:21:34] come down so God knows how to place
[2:21:37] certain things in the message that will
[2:21:40] raise up godly jealous in us where we
[2:21:42] say God I want you to be like that in my
[2:21:44] life too I want you to express yourself
[2:21:47] like that to me to God so that's this
[2:21:52] faith because these things are bringing
[2:21:56] us into a real divine revelation walking
[2:22:02] character building loving relationship
[2:22:07] with God and that's what we're so
[2:22:10] desired because God has placed that in
[2:22:13] our heart let me just read this one more
[2:22:15] we go let me just read this one more and
[2:22:19] we go and then Lord willing next time if
[2:22:22] we if the Lord permits we brother Gerald
[2:22:26] Lord permits maybe on the next trip we
[2:22:28] can come back here and maybe have
[2:22:29] another service
[2:22:31] you know okay let me read this to you
[2:22:34] and the message perfect faith brother
[2:22:36] Bram says and so when a man lives by
[2:22:39] faith and walks by faith
[2:22:41] I mean substance faith he is isolated
[2:22:45] from the entire world and becomes a new
[2:22:49] creature in Christ there now you're
[2:22:52] getting into broad material you see you
[2:22:55] see you're getting into rapture and
[2:22:58] condition now that means for each one of
[2:23:01] us not just for the pastor the Deacons
[2:23:04] and trustees that means for the laity
[2:23:07] for every individual walks in a world
[2:23:10] with God alone you excuse me you're
[2:23:13] baptized into the kingdom and there's
[2:23:16] nobody in there but you and God see he
[2:23:19] gives the orders and you packed him out
[2:23:21] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[2:23:24] a doubt no where you walk right on if
[2:23:26] the Lord says this there's nobody in the
[2:23:29] world can talk you out of it you just go
[2:23:32] on just the same now you're coming to
[2:23:35] perfect faith perfect perfection that
[2:23:38] cannot fail that faith never fails god
[2:23:45] bless it let us bow our head town

[2:24:27] because it will never let us go and it
[2:24:31] will never release us and Lord as you
[2:24:34] prayed and John 17 as your prophet said
[2:24:38] he said you only desired one thing of

[2:25:31] Abraham our Father and coming all the
[2:25:35] way down to the bride at this last day
[2:25:40] who through her she will call her
[2:25:43] brethren from the dead the dead in
[2:25:46] Christ shall rise we who are loved shall
[2:25:50] be changed and we together with them
[2:25:53] will go to meet you in the air Lord you
[2:25:57] have brought these things as your
[2:26:00] prophet said the same Holy Ghost that
[2:26:03] justified the Lutheran's that sanctify
[2:26:06] the Westlands that baptized the
[2:26:08] Pentecostals is setting the bride in
[2:26:11] order for the going and the rapture we
[2:26:14] see these things Lord Father we don't
[2:26:17] have to look at the world condition and
[2:26:19] the chaos that it's in because we're up
[2:26:23] here like Abraham was with Elohim he was
[2:26:27] not down in Sodom he was there where
[2:26:30] Elohim was revealing himself to Abraham
[2:26:33] and saying to him tell Sarah I will
[2:26:38] visit her according to the time of life
[2:26:41] Oh father father Lord bless your
[2:26:45] wonderful pastor here Lord how we honor
[2:26:48] him and respect him Lord the ministry in
[2:26:51] this lovely group of believers that you

[2:27:05] places in Christ Jesus and Lord we are
[2:27:09] so thankful that you have come and made
[2:27:12] yourself known to us in this hour and
[2:27:15] that we are your children and you are a
[2:27:18] heavenly father we give you glory honor
[2:27:21] praise and we thank you Father in Jesus
[2:27:24] name we pray amen
[2:27:27] God blesses we call the pastor well
[2:27:30] Gerald you come brother amen let's give
[2:27:33] the Lord a hand amen thank God for the
[2:27:47] word he may have and again he could have
[2:27:51] went on of course for another hour or so
[2:27:54] and maybe I'll have to do like I told
[2:27:58] you know what I'm going to say told our
[2:28:01] brother Brandon if he didn't preach for
[2:28:02] a hour and a half I was going to ask for
[2:28:04] a refund but but you get into the
[2:28:09] anointing and the power of the Holy
[2:28:11] Ghost on you rather you can move on and
[2:28:14] on on because why you're getting into
[2:28:16] eternity you're getting into the eternal
[2:28:18] word the eternal word is in you and
[2:28:21] brother talk about our brother mentioned
[2:28:23] patience I said well when we consider
[2:28:25] the patience that God has with us I saw
[2:28:28] how much patience knotweed I have with
[2:28:30] him hey man so we're not good not going
[2:28:35] to lose patience when it comes to the
[2:28:36] going forth of the word and at least I
[2:28:40] haven't gotten ever I don't remember
[2:28:42] very often getting tired airing airing
[2:28:45] the preaching of the word because we get
[2:28:47] into the spirit of the word with the
[2:28:49] ministry hey man so and what and God is
[2:28:52] feeding us God is increasing
[2:28:54] faith by by the revealed word a Mayan so
[2:28:59] I pray the grace of God to help us and
[2:29:02] there's a number of things that I made
[2:29:04] notes here but I said I won't be able to
[2:29:06] comment on it I said it'll it'll say
[2:29:08] it'll take maybe another hour or so
[2:29:10] and and maybe our brother and sister ed
[2:29:15] would have the leap we would be too late
[2:29:19] but the saved by the grace of God that
[2:29:23] faith comes by hearing the word faith
[2:29:26] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[2:29:28] a man so it's tremendous concerning the
[2:29:32] things that our brother brought out
[2:29:33] tonight concerning faith but you know it
[2:29:38] and it is as the finish there tonight
[2:29:40] with it the thought on God in simplicity
[2:29:43] it is God in revealing simplicity it is
[2:29:47] you believing God it is God receiving
[2:29:50] your testimony it is God acknowledging
[2:29:53] it by giving you the Holy Ghost and by
[2:29:55] the Holy Ghost giving you the faith that
[2:29:57] pleases him a man because again we have
[2:30:02] been raptured by the grace of God I'm
[2:30:04] not allowed me to repeat it for those
[2:30:06] that have not heard that most of you
[2:30:08] have heard it that when I did minister
[2:30:11] in a certain church and I did say I said
[2:30:15] I've been resurrected and I've been
[2:30:16] raptured and everybody everybody got
[2:30:18] silent they got really quiet and there
[2:30:22] was and they stopped responding to the
[2:30:24] word and I did say I said please I said
[2:30:27] don't do that
[2:30:28] I said I'll prove to you I said that I
[2:30:30] have been resurrected and I'll prove to
[2:30:33] you I said that I have been raptured and
[2:30:35] of course and I went and I read them if
[2:30:37] he's chapter 2 you Athey quicken what
[2:30:40] does quicken mean it means to make a lie
[2:30:42] you have him a hill high you have he
[2:30:45] resurrected because you were dead
[2:30:48] spiritually now you're alive spiritually
[2:30:50] a man but you've been born again by the
[2:30:54] grace of Almighty God then and so I said
[2:30:58] you had the quick answer I said are you
[2:31:00] quicken and you experienced the
[2:31:02] resurrection of Christ in your soul as
[2:31:03] what makes you a new creation I said now
[2:31:06] so go on down nice to three or four
[2:31:07] verses and now I said you're raptured
[2:31:10] it says we're caught up into heavenly
[2:31:12] places in Christ a man praise the name
[2:31:15] of the Lord so I have experienced the
[2:31:20] resurrection I experienced the rapture
[2:31:22] yeah you know spiritually now we're
[2:31:25] moving into it physically by the grace
[2:31:28] of Almighty God it is God bringing it
[2:31:30] into manifestation a man from the inside
[2:31:33] out
[2:31:33] by the grace of god and the prophet of
[2:31:36] god quoted that verse can certainly were
[2:31:38] caught up into heaven ii places in
[2:31:40] christ and he said now he said he
[2:31:43] referred to it as the rapture but he
[2:31:44] said what's going on in heavenly places
[2:31:46] he said the word is being revealed it's
[2:31:51] giving us more and more faith for the
[2:31:54] change but even it's it's it's already
[2:31:56] in progress and we're moving on by the
[2:31:59] grace of god
[2:32:00] amen so god help us is my prayer a man
[2:32:04] and God bless our brother Andre we thank
[2:32:07] the Lord for the word tonight please I
[2:32:10] beg of you in the name of the Lord don't
[2:32:12] leave it behind take it with you in your
[2:32:16] heart because because if you're only
[2:32:18] hurting it in your head that you'll
[2:32:20] leave it behind it's gone it's in it
[2:32:23] it's out but it's got to go into the oh
[2:32:25] but it got to go into the hand but it's
[2:32:27] got to go down detain it into your soul

[2:32:32] the ears in our heads but now let's go

[2:32:39] soul the Devon Bethany hear what the
[2:32:41] Spirit is saying to the to the to the
[2:32:43] world to the children of God by the
[2:32:46] grace of God amen
[2:32:48] so don't leave it behind take it with
[2:32:50] you meditate on it
[2:32:51] think about it thank God for it amen and
[2:32:54] got to come on the scene and bless you
[2:32:57] for it
[2:32:58] amen so to God be the glory that we're
[2:33:02] going to go from faith to faith not
[2:33:06] knowledge to knowledge but faith of
[2:33:08] faith the spiritual revelation of the
[2:33:11] word and they'll prove that we are in
[2:33:13] heavenly places in Christ and the word
[2:33:16] is being revealed to us
[2:33:18] by the grace of Almighty God and I
[2:33:22] thought I was blessed by what our
[2:33:23] brother brought out concerning the the
[2:33:26] Abraham and it was by faith that Abraham
[2:33:30] named the animals the creatures that was
[2:33:34] that was good
[2:33:36] now I've never heard that before brought
[2:33:39] out in that way
[2:33:40] but that was good that was the anointing
[2:33:42] and gaudy and Abraham Annie Annie
[2:33:45] he didn't just not by you know I just
[2:33:49] I'll just do this I'll just do that I'll
[2:33:51] call that one that that one that it's
[2:33:53] good he knew their nature a man it was
[2:33:57] the anointing in Helen it was certainly
[2:33:59] the anointing of God in out a manta to
[2:34:02] refer to the Dove and call it the DOE to
[2:34:05] refer to the lion and called the lion
[2:34:06] because this was the first Adam but
[2:34:08] there was coming a second Adam and God
[2:34:11] is reflected he reflects himself in
[2:34:13] nature but the the good is reflected in
[2:34:16] nature and evil is reflected in nature a
[2:34:18] man so I tried trust by the grace of God
[2:34:22] don't forget it a man that God bless you
[2:34:25] with that revelation and the first Adam
[2:34:30] put himself in sin with E that she'd be
[2:34:32] redeemed and the second Adam came down
[2:34:35] to identify with the sin that the bride
[2:34:37] was in you know all points he was
[2:34:39] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[2:34:41] but he identified with it he came and he
[2:34:44] was tested by at all
[2:34:45] what forward to redeem the bride as that
[2:34:48] of redeemed it was good to go it was
[2:34:49] dead to redeem II Christ and to redeem
[2:34:52] his right forever this is tremendous
[2:34:55] brother is God hidden and revealed in
[2:34:58] simplicity it's God in His Word Genesis
[2:35:01] to Revelation is like I say in the
[2:35:04] beginning God created the heaven and the
[2:35:05] earth and he had a plan and he had
[2:35:07] and he had a pattern a man praise the
[2:35:11] Lord
[2:35:11] a man and he just looked back and and
[2:35:14] it's got in simplicity with Luther God
[2:35:16] in simplicity with Wesley God in
[2:35:18] simplicity with the old fashioned
[2:35:20] Salvation Army got in simplicity with
[2:35:22] the Pentecostals and then God his
[2:35:24] complicity in the Ministry of William
[2:35:26] Branham a man a prophet a man that's
[2:35:29] right that's what amazes a lot of people
[2:35:31] was the simplicity of the Ministry of
[2:35:33] William Branham supposed simplicity all
[2:35:36] William Branham himself and God Agee he
[2:35:40] was God's chosen servant he made said to
[2:35:44] call out the bright in these last days
[2:35:47] praise the name of the Lord so it's
[2:35:49] tremendous praise the God so I don't
[2:35:53] don't don't try to make it bigger than
[2:35:54] what it is smaller than what it is the
[2:35:56] proud of God in the seal said leave it
[2:35:58] the way it is a million and as I've said
[2:36:02] the resurrection is a resurrection don't
[2:36:05] try to explain the mechanics believe it
[2:36:08] the rapture the rapture don't try to
[2:36:11] explain the mechanics believe it amen
[2:36:13] we're on our way by the grace of God
[2:36:16] amen
[2:36:18] praise the Lord again the thought that
[2:36:23] came out here when as our brother
[2:36:25] Minister faith honors God he said and
[2:36:29] God honors faith you can have the
[2:36:34] knowledge of the message the knowledge
[2:36:35] of the word but do you have the faith of
[2:36:38] it the revelation of it in your heart
[2:36:41] you can have it in your head but God
[2:36:44] doesn't honor that the only honours
[2:36:46] within your heart amen God sees what's
[2:36:50] in your heart by the grace of God and
[2:36:55] this thought also that really struck me
[2:37:00] too
[2:37:02] and we knew about it we wouldn't Shirley
[2:37:06] we added in our heads but a revelation
[2:37:08] our hearts when our brother mentioned
[2:37:10] concerning the woman
[2:37:15] they came for bread lord have mercy on
[2:37:20] me for this and that and they called her
[2:37:23] a dog just think Jesus referenced her as
[2:37:28] a dog was that Christian well he wanted
[2:37:37] to bring out something he said it to
[2:37:40] bring out something he said it to make
[2:37:43] to make it manifested hallelujah
[2:37:46] for what for for the Gentiles hallelujah
[2:37:50] hallelujah hallelujah brothers sister
[2:37:53] that's you and me
[2:37:54] oh we crawl up to the table and and
[2:38:00] old she call him dead the son of David
[2:38:03] and this but then when then when he
[2:38:06] struck her with the revelation of what
[2:38:09] he thought she was and he said it's not
[2:38:11] right to take the children's bread and
[2:38:12] give it to dogs
[2:38:16] Jesus you Christian to say such a thing
[2:38:22] is that well that it's God in simplicity
[2:38:25] he wanted to get her to the revelation
[2:38:27] of who she was and what she was and to
[2:38:29] bring out in her humility hallelujah to
[2:38:34] get her to what to get her to do what he
[2:38:37] wanted to uh wants us to do what must I
[2:38:40] do to be saved
[2:38:41] what was she had to be do to be saved
[2:38:43] repent be baptized in the name of the
[2:38:47] Lord Jesus Christ where she recognized
[2:38:48] him as Lord and God gave her what she
[2:38:51] asked for
[2:38:52] by the grace of God so repent and be
[2:38:56] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:38:58] you'll get the you get crumbs all right
[2:39:00] you get the the eternal bread of the
[2:39:02] revealed Word
[2:39:04] well that's tremendous do we have her
[2:39:08] attitude do we have her spirit or the
[2:39:15] humility that she manifested are we
[2:39:17] seeing the truth that she saw as she saw
[2:39:20] it that's tremendous
[2:39:24] that is tremendous one thing to read it
[2:39:27] and say oh yeah I believe it and you
[2:39:29] know it's amazing you know he called her
[2:39:30] dog look what look how she reacted but
[2:39:34] are we reacting the same way when we
[2:39:38] come into his presence you know
[2:39:41] personally in him when you go into your
[2:39:44] prayer room and you and you shut the
[2:39:46] door and you're praying to the Lord Amen
[2:39:50] she said yes Lord that's right
[2:39:53] I'm a dog but even the dogs eat from the
[2:39:59] crumbs that fall from the master's table
[2:40:02] thank God thank you Jesus thank you
[2:40:07] Jesus for saving us dogs thank you Jesus
[2:40:12] for feeding us dogs amen
[2:40:15] thank you Jesus for giving us the Garmon
[2:40:17] you're giving giving us a man clothing
[2:40:20] in the white robes of your righteousness
[2:40:22] Lord and thank you Jesus that you
[2:40:25] predestinated us as the Bride of Christ
[2:40:28] oh that ought to humble us and humble us
[2:40:32] humble us more and more by the grace of
[2:40:35] God praise the Lord so the Lord help us
[2:40:39] rather to believe the word and to walk
[2:40:46] by faith I believe it's God in
[2:40:53] simplicity here in Newfoundland God in
[2:40:57] simplicity
[2:40:58] anywhere else
[2:41:05] it's amazing that God has been using us
[2:41:09] the way that he has over the years to
[2:41:15] minister not just a Newfoundland but to
[2:41:19] the world we thank the Lord for that
[2:41:22] privilege in that honor and will give
[2:41:24] the glory to Jesus and tell of his
[2:41:27] wonderful law by the grace of God so
[2:41:33] maybe there was a reason why that
[2:41:37] brother Branham landed in Gander in the
[2:41:40] early 50s and as I said I was 25 miles
[2:41:47] east of him
[2:41:49] I might've been five years old but I was
[2:41:55] just 25 miles away from the airport
[2:41:57] where the Prophet landed and he did get
[2:42:02] off the plane he did go into the airport
[2:42:05] he did come back get on the plane and
[2:42:08] they did take the picture and the pillar
[2:42:11] of fire was in the window of the plane
[2:42:14] where the Prophet was sitting so there
[2:42:19] was a reason for that a man I believe it
[2:42:25] I've seen the picture and I'm still
[2:42:28] trying to locate the copy of it by the
[2:42:32] grace of God so I believe it was for a
[2:42:35] reason the Prophet had landed there and
[2:42:38] it was only about an hour's drive away I
[2:42:40] guess from their individual Falls that
[2:42:43] God begin the move among the Saints amen
[2:42:49] and not only that he sent that brother
[2:42:52] up from Jeffersonville and have
[2:42:56] fellowship with brother cater sister
[2:42:58] cater and brother and sister Manuel and
[2:43:00] some of the believers back then in 1963
[2:43:04] and it was the same brother that took
[2:43:08] myself and sister Betty around
[2:43:10] Jeffersonville incepted not the same
[2:43:11] brother but their brothers some that
[2:43:14] took us around Jeffersonville in
[2:43:15] September
[2:43:18] that's amazing that's absolutely amazing
[2:43:22] as the Lord I said to God be the glory
[2:43:26] for what you have done and what you're
[2:43:27] doing I said here in Newfoundland a man
[2:43:31] I trust and want to believe that there
[2:43:34] that there's a number of new for land
[2:43:36] that's going to be part of the Bride of
[2:43:37] Christ that and part of the rapture by
[2:43:41] the grace of God and of course I have a
[2:43:47] letter that brother Manuel received from
[2:43:51] brother Branham because he had invited
[2:43:54] the Prophet to come and ministered in in
[2:43:56] Newfoundland and they had sent back a
[2:44:00] report response saying thank your
[2:44:03] brother for the invitation and that we
[2:44:05] are putting you on the list and and as
[2:44:09] the Lord leads will wait on his
[2:44:11] leadership yes he was invited to
[2:44:14] minister in mr. Falls anybody and and
[2:44:20] they were put on the list for waiting on
[2:44:22] the leadership of God but by that time
[2:44:24] before that time could come God took the
[2:44:27] Prophet home a man so it's it's all all
[2:44:31] in the in the will of God the
[2:44:34] predestinated plan of God a man so we
[2:44:38] trusted that the anointing when the
[2:44:41] Prophet flew up the anointing was still
[2:44:43] here
[2:44:43] a man praise the Lord he because why and
[2:44:47] again it was a miracle a man that bottom
[2:44:53] to Gander was the plane that ran out of
[2:44:57] fuel and they were complaining and the
[2:45:02] brother said to Warner Brothers I got
[2:45:06] the cassette song that to brother the
[2:45:09] testified of it enjoy there in
[2:45:11] jeffersonville and the prophet of God
[2:45:16] said don't complain people were
[2:45:17] complaining because that the plane
[2:45:19] diverted and landed in gander instead of
[2:45:23] going on to New York somewhere and he
[2:45:27] said don't complain he said we've been
[2:45:29] going a half an hour
[2:45:31] he said on an empty tank and he said he
[2:45:34] sir wasn't for the grace of God he said
[2:45:37] we be out there in the in the ocean
[2:45:40] amen hallelujah it was a miracle but a
[2:45:44] God had got it ordained it and
[2:45:46] predestinated for a reason for that
[2:45:48] prophet to come and land in gander amen
[2:45:52] and I mentioned to brother brother Billy
[2:45:55] Paul Brennan and he does recall that
[2:45:58] he's I remember he said today he said
[2:46:01] our our landing in gander he could
[2:46:04] remember that he knew about that because
[2:46:06] the plane had ran out of fuel but edie
[2:46:08] was not aware of the picture that was
[2:46:10] taken and so we're waiting to try to get
[2:46:12] that but so we can get him a copy of it
[2:46:15] by the grace of God so you can be in
[2:46:18] prayer for that so it's all for a reason
[2:46:20] we thank God for it and it's all for a
[2:46:22] reason that God sent our brother Andre
[2:46:25] to minister to us last year and a
[2:46:28] minister again to us this this time and
[2:46:30] we're praying the grace of God that the
[2:46:32] Lord will send them back amen
[2:46:35] we we need we need that ministry again
