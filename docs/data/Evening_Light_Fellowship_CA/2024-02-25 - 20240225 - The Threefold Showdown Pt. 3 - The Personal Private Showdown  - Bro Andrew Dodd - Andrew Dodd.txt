Jesus is here Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here amen believe that this morning amen praise the Lord you can be seated again Amen brother brother Andrew is not out yet and that's okay I did tell him that uh there's over 12200 songs in our database so we run out of there we'll just start over again all right okay sorry about that brother John's got to come up first we're all tired amen okay let's just sing uh Jesus you're the sweetest name of all and brother John you come on Jesus 1139 you're the sweetest name of all Jesus you always hear me when I Jesus amen you lift me up each time I fall you're the sweetest sweetest name of all Jesus you're the sweetest of all s you always hear me when I call oh Jesus you lift me up each time I fall you're the sweetest the sweetest name of all amen we've got a baby dedication this morning so we're going to ask brother Josh and sister Michelle and sister hope and brother Caleb and sister Elise and brother Gus if they'd all come up to the platform and we'll do the baby dedication morning let's sing that song bring them in bring them in amen as they come up this morning [Music] amen just the course bring them in bring them in bring them in from the field of sin bring them in bring them in bring the wondering ones to Jesus bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the wondering ones to [Music] Jesus amen it's baptisms and deed baby dedications are always the the most wonderful times for a pastor so it's good to finally meet little anniah Elizabeth Columbo amen God bless brother Josh and sister Michelle and I had to look up the meanings of course and anah means god answers and Elizabeth means God's promise or oath of God so we've got a baby that's dedicated to the to the premise that when you ask God will answer and when God makes a promise he'll fulfill it amen and in Isaiah 65:24 it says and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear and it seems so often the greatest challenge for us is to get to the place where we can ask for the will of God and you'll find when you ask the will of God the answer is already there the way is already made there's already a preparation and he can send it even while you're asking because you've stepped into the channel of God Amen and I believe this is a daughter of God that's going to step into that channel amen that she'll seek out to the Lord and she'll find his will for her life and she'll be someone that can serve him Faithfully Amen brother brandham says that we must believe him and as we believe we must act on our confession we can't say it conscientiously unless we really believe it and then if we really believe it then we can say it with all of our hearts and know that our God answers our prayer and gives us the desire of our hearts he says let's remember while we're obeying the spirit one great lesson that we want to learn is never be Hasty see take your time and have faith if we have asked God anything remember God answers prayer he does it in his time the way it's best and makes it work just right for us that's from the adoption message number three Elizabeth means the oath of God or God's oath and in Hebrews 6:13 it says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself in other words he put himself on the line he put his reputation he put his witness he became the guarant of his own oath his own promise amen and in verse 14 it says saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise he said when God makes a promise to you he will fulfill it you don't have to be afraid that he will not keep his word for God will keep his word that's true he says You must you just must trust him amen what a what a name to give a daughter of God is that God answers and God makes a promise and that means he's going to keep it amen and we're in the season of the the greatest experience the greatest manifestation that the children of God will have and that's a resurrection and a Rapture amen and I believe that we're in the season of a Rapture and we've got a a young woman here a baby that's dedicated the idea that God's made a promise he's made an oath and it has nothing to do with us that's the beauty of this one he didn't swear by our performance or by our dedication or our commitment or our sanctification he says I'll do it because I've said I'm going to do it and I've committed myself to do it amen amen so we pray that God would use brother Josh and sister relle that because here's the thing how do you learn that God Answers by seeing God answer by seeing your parents go to God and pray and having a family Altar and and bringing needs before God and that's where they see a reality of God is Not Just in church it's in the it's around the family table it's around the family altar when they put things before God and he comes and he makes it real and he answers prayer according to the needs of the faithful amen so it's this is a dedication as much of brother Josh and sister relle as God has given them this wonderful gift amen just like brother Andrew was talking yesterday that that God gave Jesus Mary and Joseph to flawed individuals and brother Josh is wonderful as you are you're flawed sister relle you're flawed but you are made perfectly exactly For What Little anah needs to raise her in the admonition and nurture the Lord amen we're all flawed we're all failures but yet God uses those flawed and failure ones so men so is it okay if I hold her all right I'm going to hold her and we're going to have the the parents come in and then the the grandparents would you come and you lay hands on these this young couple as we would pray on them amen each one together if we would let's see if we can do this transfer there we go a there we go amen let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord how precious are these young ones Lord and we want to Lord raise them the right way and Lord so we're up here this morning Lord and we're dedicating her to you Heavenly Father and it's a commitment of brother Josh and sister relle Lord that they're going to raise her under the atmosphere and the umbrella of the Holy Spirit Lord that your word will have the preeminence in their home so Lord God we pray your presence in their home Lord we pray your presence in their lives we pray that your presence would be in their very bodies and souls Lord God that she would see the reality of a God that answers that a God that makes a promise will always fulfill it Lord God Lord bless this young family Lord may your richest blessings be in their home Lord Lord may they see you move and express yourself and manifest yourself in a wonderful way Lord according to the promise of this hour we ask it Lord bless the grandparents as they support and give wisdom and Mentor Lord may they just be able to help them Lord through the days ahead Lord and may above all Lord you be the great guide and Shepherd of their home we pray Lord bless little anniah Elizabeth Columbo we ask Lord may she serve you all the days of her life Lord may you give her a new birth by your Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ name we ask it amen amen amen amen God bless you both all right got her there we go amen God bless you God bless you then God bless you God bless you God bless you amen amen praise the Lord amen you know none of us had seen pictures nothing we didn't know if she

to invite brother Andrew to come to the pulpit this morning have you enjoyed the word amen it's just been wonderful amen God bless him amen let's not stop on yesterday's service or yesterday's experience amen let's keep pulling let's wear them out amen let's wear them out we didn't we didn't bring them here so we could sit back and relax we brought him here to work amen we brought him here to be used hey let's be honest that's what we're here for amen we're here to pull on the gift amen and if he goes home rung out like a like a a rag then I say that's the best Services we could ever have amen we'll make it worth his while I'm sure he'll be blessed in all of this but share your testimonies with them you've shared some of them with me about the things that the Lord spoke through him last night just write down the line exactly the way that you are asking and wondering and thinking and and these different things share that with with him encourage him it'll help him in his ministry to know that the Lord has hit the mark through him this weekend amen but we're going to sing that song Holy Spirit rain down and we're just going to ask the Lord to just take over now amen and you hold your knee before him you hold your life before him whatever it is that you've got amen if you haven't had your need met this service say Lord today is the day Lord I'm expecting you to meet my need and you hold that before me and you pull on the gift and watch God come down your path and come down your way into your life this morning amen let's sing it Holy Spirit rain down oh rain

Father Lord Jesus that is what we've come here this morning to do Lord that we could just close the doors around us Lord Lord I pray this morning you drop the veil around each individual Lord and just begin to whisper into our ears Lord be free in our midst Lord Jesus father God we've so enjoyed the word this weekend Lord I've enjoyed it Lord father that you've been here Lord and as you taught us through your Prophet Lord not to watch for great Miracles not to tell God how we want it but Lord just to receive it the way you give it to us Lord to take a hold of your promise and to hold on to it Lord now that's been the purpose here this weekend Lord is father that uh we could just Minister the word and allow the people to lay a hold of it but Lord Jesus you said Lord if we just come and receive it on the basis Lord that the word is here and the word is in action it's been in action this weekend for you said your word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it has done that Lord in both Services Lord it has been an action it's not me it's not a man I know nothing of what's going on and I still don't Lord but father you know all things oh God we couldn't hide from you Lord so now instead of trying to hide we just lay ourselves bear before you we receive you Lord on the basis that you're here Lord Jesus we're not waiting to the end of a service to Finly say he's here but Lord you're here right now to meet every need Lord and we want to press in Lord father you said the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force father we want to press this morning within the veil Lord we want to violently Lord whatever it takes oh God we desire Lord God is Lord there was a veil over Moses's Faith there was a veil of Jesus Christ that you hid yourself behind but today Father there's a spiritual Veil over the people Help us to press through that Lord by spiritual Revelation oh God lord we just lay ourselves at your feet now ask that you'd speak freely in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen hasn't God been good to you this weekend I've been so uh enjoying my time here with you and the fellowship and ministering the word as I told Brother Bob last night I said I fell in love last night hearing you all sing after the service you might be a few in number about 30 or 35 here last night but you sang like a thousand the Lord was here amen he's here again this morning and we just want to accept all that he has for us and I so enjoyed the the song service again God bless your heart brother Bob and amen Hebrews chapter 12 if you turn with me there Hebrews chapter 12 after the service last night one of your deacons told me I need to get rid of that timer on my phone and then your pastor indirectly rebuked me in the car I saiding you should not time a service he was telling that to one of his sons he didn't know he was talking to me so I'm not going to time myself this morning so if I go long blame them but here here we are in Hebrews chap 12 amen we're going to continue on in The three-fold Showdown this would be part three but we're going to call this as a subtitle the personal private Showdown Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 12 says wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all man and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled oh my lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright love the way the scripture gives us examples and we we look at profane people while they're out there cursing and sing and doing all these things he says no lest as Esau who just didn't honor the word of God the way he ought to have didn't honor the birthright that God had given him and for one morsel of bread sold it off and he it goes on to say for he know he know for you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he saw it carefully with tears for you are not come to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they had heard T entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart oh so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but you are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God and Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels and to the general assembly of the church and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that speaketh on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that can be shaken as of things that are made and those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefor we have received a kingdom which cannot be moved Hallelujah let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire amen may the Lord is Blessing to the word you may have the comfort of your seats amen amen I was really amazed when I got here originally at the fortuity of the the officers of the church here and how they patted the pews in the middle God bless you you don't end up with people sitting way out there and way out there because they're not patted but God bless you for sitting it makes a difference when We Gather our licks of fire together and we gather them into a place and we're able to create a larger flame and allow the Lord to work in our midst amen amen and I just want to take this scripture and and and really I'll just maybe start by reading a quote from the end time seed sign brother bam says I believe that these La these latterday signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together to show that Christ is ready to come for his bride this is in 1962 in March of 1962 he's speaking this saying all of these things are already coming together to show Christ is ready to come for his bride as God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man Jesus Christ so is God and His word coming again to make himself manifest in a bride not not not that they will do like Eve did and high bread it with anything else but the unadulterated word of God will be born into the church and she will stand like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit anointed in his word amen I believe it's an announcement right now amen that he was announcing it there in 1962 and we know what happened as you go down in 1963 the the seals were opening the the the angel of God came down and with a an open book in hand and was able to give to the the the prophet brother brandom when he said I would have come and preached the seals and I would have got it all mixed up he would have preached it all wrong but the Holy Spirit the Lord Jesus Christ came in the room we know the angel of the Lord came out of the lust and begin to speak to him and tell him exactly what each seal was the day that he was going to preach it when he was preaching the first seal he didn't know what the second seal was it was the pure P unadulterated word of God that God was opening the book to him of what it was all about and the Redemption that that was there in the book and it was John that when it was written in the Book of Revelations that John wept because no man was able to open the book and to loose the seals thereof not even anyone was able to look thereon but he said weep not John for the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed amen and he turned and he saw a lamb as though it had been slain that had prevailed and he came forth and he took the book out of the right hand of him that SATs on the throne I know this isn't anything new to you but I want to just refresh your memory as we get going this morning and as as as he took the book out of the right hand of him who sat upon the throne he took the book and he was able to loose the seals because he had overcome amen and that he he had shed his blood so that we would be able to see our names on the book of redemption amen that was what he was loosing that is what he was opening he wasn't just opening more knowledge and and more things for us to know and to understand but he was opening so you could see your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and you can realize I cannot be lost because he wrote my name on the L book of life before the foundation of the world Amen we know the scripture says that that he wrote it way back then before I ever did a sin he knew that I would come to the knowledge of the truth he knew that I would receive the blood of Jesus Christ he knew that I would repent of my sins he knew that I would be baptized in correct water baptism he knew that I would come to a place of adoption before I ever knew what adoption was oh Hallelujah because he knows all things and he's able to predestinate and he predestinated us Ephesians chapter 1 says unto the adoption of sons he predestined us to a purpose so we would come to a place of maturity as he did so that way he could be the firstborn among many Brethren amen Hallelujah this now as we look at it it says you are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God this is the final showdown as brother bam says and pick up your pen and write as we've quoted Friday and quoted on Saturday where he said there's three showdowns Mount Carmel Mount Transfiguration and he says there's a Rapture Showdown which is Mount Zion and he says this showdown is the rapture but again it is God proving who he is in this dispensation because God in each and every dispensation he proved that he was God when he was under the dispensation of fatherhood he proved that he was a son when he was under the dispensation of Jesus Christ but now he's proving who he is in our day today by the form of a showdown again and the finality of that Showdown will be a body change Hallelujah but you know that you are coming to Mount Zion and a showdown amen is proving who he is and he begins the whole process then by justif ification where he talks about in here in Hebrews chap 11 he doesn't just start in verse 22 where it says you're come under Mount Zion but he starts way back in verse 12 where he says lift up the hands which hung down and the feeble knees why would hands hang down why would you have feeble knees why would it be this way because we're Sinners we're unworthy we're not able we we were hopeless in and of ourselves but he says there's something I've given you a power to defy gravitation to worship me by lifting up your hands there's something I've given you in order to stand in the presence of God when before in the presence of God you would fall on your face and be unable but he says I've given you by my blood boldness to enter into my throne and he'd even go on beyond that and he say lift up those hands you have life within you and he says make straight the pathways that the lame be not turned out but rather that there is healing in the body of Jesus Christ amen make straight Pathways amen don't make your Doctrine all over the place that the lame can't follow you and you can't understand what we're talking about but rather lay a straight pathway lay something that leads directly to the Lord Jesus Christ something that they could be healed amen there's a healing power in the church as James chap 5:15 would say and the power of PR the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up amen I love those words it doesn't say he will or he might or he one day but he says he shall when there's the word s h l it means that there it is a definite it is a shity it will happen it must happen because it shall come to pass Hallelujah and he says the Lord shall raise him up and if they have committed sins they shall be forgiven him oh praise be to God hallelujah why the prayer of faith shall save the the sick and if they've committed any sins they shall be forgiven them it says in the next verse and confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man that word effectual fervent that means you can enter in to the sufferings of another the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth much Hallelujah in then that believe as Mark 16 would say if they would lay their hands on the sick they shall recover say well it's just for the ministry it's not just for the ministry it's not just for the deacons it's not just for the trustees but anyone that would believe if you lay your hands right on the person next to you this morning they shall recover whatever sickness they may have you say they don't look sick next to me that's why we shake hands with one another and say God bless you oh hallelujah what kind of a blessing are you given on them if you believe you're pronouncing God's healing upon them just by shaking somebody's hand this morning and saying God bless you oh praise be to God sometimes we take things too lightly we take things as just p and just well we just shook hands and well I just greeted him and if I have to no you are a projection of the love of God and then is the rising of the sun brother Brandon would say and he being the groom and the bride has to come forth cuz it's a part of him I want to go back for a minute and say that first Showdown was proving that God is God and the second Showdown is proving that Jesus Christ is God but this search Showdown it's showing who God is today in other words it's proving that she is him there's three showdowns God is God Jesus Is God and she is him as he even says it in the in the the rising of the sun he said he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride Hallelujah the bride of Christ in our day you and I we are the manifestation of every Revelation in the Bible in every age that has ever gone forth for the man would the the the the the the the the the reward for each age the reward that was given to the Ephesians age in Revelations chapter 2 the reward that was given to the next age on the way down the reward that was given to the Philadelphian age the reward that was given to Leo all of it is for you it compiles one on top of the other on top of the other it's for you amen it's not just well I'll just sit with him in his Stone no there's a stone no you're a pillar in the house of God you're all of these things you're giv white robes oh praise be to God all all of the revelation of the Bride down through seven Church ages all through the Scripture it pertains to you Hallelujah and it can only manifest if it does some if if it does something he says it can only manifest it can only manifest it doesn't sit there dormant it has to bring forth we started out in Friday he said my word will not return unto me void if it does something different than the groom then it isn't the bride it's plain and simple if it does something different than the Lord did it's not the bride Oh my he says this he says it isn't he says it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh she is bone of his bone she is life of his life she is power of his power she is him as men and wom are one and women was taken from his side she was taken a she had a she had taken a spirit a feminist Spirit from him and the flesh taken from his side both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the bride in him and the Flesh in him put it all together and made mechanics and Dynamics just like it was in the beginning when he had his first Adam you could go down and read it into Genesis chapter 2 and you'd realize that sitting there he put Adam into a deep sleep and he took the rib from his side he took his wife and he formed his wife from his very side he took the feminine Spirit out of Adam and he made Eve with that and he made her a living Soul as well and he gave her and he presented her back to Adam it's the same thing that's going on again but in a spiritual realm where we had where Jesus died on the cross and it seemed that they would when they were dying on the cross that they would take a sledgehammer and they would break the legs of the individual but when they came to Jesus because the scripture said not because the Centurion had a great idea but because the scripture said not one bone in his body would be broken so they put down the sludgehammer and instead they picked up a spear and they thrust it through his side and out of his side which came blood and water separately and out of that he had already commanded his Spirit to leave him what was going on he was taking from his side the blood of Jesus Christ showing that it would be blood that it would be water it would have to be justification by the blood it would have to be sanctification by the washing of the Water by the word and it would have to be spirit that would come in and cap it but he didn't just let that flow out he commanded that he said I lay down my life I tap power to take it up again Hallelujah he has power to give you his life Hallelujah showing we are not taken just from anywhere we're taken from the very side of Jesus Christ we are flesh of his flesh we are bone of his bone we are life of his life Hallelujah it says in Ephesians 4:8 he says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto man now that he ascended what is what is it but he that also descended first into the lower parts of hell he that descended is the same that ascended up far above the heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some in other words he says this is Jesus Christ going before the Lord and making the atonement when he come down and he we know that when he died and he was laid in the grave his Spirit went down and he went down into the lowest regions of Hell brother Bram would preach wonderful Services about that how he went and he kicked open the door and he took the keys of death Hell In The Grave amen he had such power he had such anointing even there oh the purpose of God was so much greater in the Eternal Realms than it ever was just on his his his his 33 year and a half Corporal life when he was here on Earth sometimes we get so caught up what am I doing on this Earth God has a purpose for you in the eternals that is so much greater than just these 70 years and then Grace what Christ has been doing setting on high as a our high priest making intercessions on our behalf but we find he went down there at this time and he made interess and he took and he took our sins put it back upon the Devil took the keys of death hell in the grave and he came back out of the grave and he says don't touch me for I have not ascended yet to the father but he said when all of a sudden he ascended back up to the father and came back down now all of a sudden he tells Thomas put your hands here put your hands in my side why was it okay for Thomas to touch it because he said the sacrifice had now been presented and the sacrifice had now been accepted so now it's okay you can touch me because I have been accepted before God the atonement has already already been made Hallelujah the atonement for sins was accepted before God and it says and when he came back where he might fill all things in verse 11 says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers oh praise be to God we're so thankful for the gifts that he puts in the body we're thankful that we have a prophet in our day we're thankful that we had the word of God if it wasn't for that we would be like every other denomination stumbling about probing and probing and probing but because God sent the word of the Lord to a prophet and he brought it out and revealed all the Mysteries today we have something to Rejoice about we've really got something to preach about and to pull on the word and thank God for hallelujah hallelujah but in all of that he didn't just send a prophet praise God he didn't just send a prophet and said just play tapes just get in your home and just play tapes we're just going to have have a prophet here no he said I sent a five full ministry I sent you a pastor you need a good Godly Pastor that'll there be there be a Shepherd to you lead you and take you by Still Waters and take you to Green Pastures or when you need medicine he'll preach that to you he's able to come and help you fight your battles with you God gives you a wonderful Godly Pastor for your edification and he sends evangelist by your way he gives you teachers amen he gives you preachers he gives you all of his fivefold gifts Hallelujah we could go into the gifts of the holy spirit as well and talk about how he gives you that by the Holy Ghost those are gifts of the Spirit those might fall on you once and never come again those might fall on you over and over and over and over again Gifts of speaking in tongues and interpretation Gifts of Prophecy Gifts of wisdom all of these different things that there's different spiritual gifts there and and and we could go into that but really as I want to I want to just just take it in this way because God gave us five gifts of the ministry in order so that we could do what so that it could Usher us into the atonement this is the scripture that that's given right after it talks about the Jesus Christ going and making the atonement for our sins and he says and when he came back what did he do he gave us five gifts he gave us a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of saints for the work of the ministry for the edif Ying of the body of Christ now I'm just going to be bluntly honest with you there isn't one of us that can perfect you on I can't I don't claim that I could ever perfect any one of you boy would you ever be miserable if I tried to mold you and put you into an image and just say this is what you got to be and this is what you got to be You' Say You're Just a legalist and that would be exactly right if that was the way I was trying to go about it but it ain't me it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's because he made the atonement it's not trying to get you to me or trying to get you to a pastor but we're trying to get you to Christ we're trying to get you into the atonement we're trying to get you into what he's done for you we're trying to get you to recognize and have faith in the promises of God that all of them have been given to you in the atonement and even the message for our day what did it do with the revealing of the word it brought to you and it opened it unlocked the fullness of what the atonement is hallelujah because rapturing faith lies on those tapes and the atonement was meant to bring you to a place so you could be ready for rapture it was meant to bring you to a body change that was the fullness of our adoption Hallelujah says that we be no henceforth no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and cutting craftiness whereby they laid in we to deceive but we could be speaking the truth in love that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom from the head down the whole body is fitly joined together amen and compacted by that which every joint supplieth but I'm just the weakest every joint from the littlest pinky little toe all the way up to the neck that turns the head every joint supplies you ever think the pinky toe's useless just go kick a chair one day with it it's called stubbing your toe man it reminds you it's there Hallelujah from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working of the measure of every part making increase to the body unto the edifying of itself in love oh my we have it through the opening of the word the fullness of the token and that's what we're trying as ministers to Usher you into into God's Great Variety Store hallelujah it's got a big neon sign on it f OA fullness of the atonement it's God brother God's Great Variety Store you can go in there and you can pick anything you need off the shelf what do you need this morning I need peace it's there there I need Joy it's there I need healing it's there I need my family it's there I need anything it's there I needed the manifestation of the gift of God in my life it's there just walk into that great God's Variety Store don't be disturbed by the fact there's no price tags on the shelves that's because it's all paid in full by the blood of the Lamb he doesn't not offering and he's not saying that you need to pay anything for it he says just believe it's yours you can have it Hallelujah he paid in full amen and he gave you access to all of them by Revelation amen as we prayed when we started out there's a veil upon the people today as as brother God would brother Brandon would talk about in The Mighty God on Veil before us he would talk about the spiritual Veil that's over the people it's a veil of Revelation that people can't break through that Veil because they don't have a revelation of who God is they don't have a revelation of who Jesus is they don't have a revelation of who they are so they can't break through that Veil it's not once in the in the in the in Moses when he came down from Mount Si they had to put a veil of over his face because the glory of God Shone through him that was a natural Veil but then when it came in Jesus Christ he was the fullness the attribute of the fullness of God dwelled in him bodily but it was the veil of his human flesh that veiled it up and hid it from everybody else so even the Pharisees and the Sadducees they couldn't see it that was a natural flesh Veil but over this day and age the word of God is Not only veiled in your flesh there's also a spiritual Veil over the people that they cannot see it because they can look at the same word and not understand it because it is only by Revelation that you can break within that Veil oh praise be to God I trust that'll become more and more of a reality to you Hallelujah as we read as you are come you are come because Revelation in the word brother bam says in the in in in the the the the revelation of Jesus Christ he says the the revelation of the word gives you authority over the Devil Revelation of the word as we talked about last night that that the word of God will defeat the enemy anywhere any time any place under any circumstances with or without the Holy Ghost but by revelation of the word it gives you authority over the devil Hallelujah ujah oh praise be to God so I've given all things he says you he's the you are come unto Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel we're come to a better Covenant Hallelujah your pastor was breaking into the anointing this morning when he was dedicating it's not based on us this Covenant it's based on him as he said in in Genesis 4:9 when God came to to cainan he said whatat hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crith out from me from the ground that was what the blood of Abel was speaking it was crying out how long Lord how long and thou art and he says unto Cain thou now art thou cursed from the earth so where was what was the the the the blood of Abel what did it produce prod a curse he says which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand oh my that's what Abel's blood brought that's what that brought about was a curse but he says that's not what you're come to even though we crucified the Lord Jesus Christ his own Brethren crucified him the Romans did the deed the Gentiles we were all Parton it but we brought him to that place and Spilled his blood but he said that's not what it cries out I Sanctified the Earth by my blood I I I claimed it right there I Justified it I Sanctified it I'm ready now to come to you because you are come to the blood of Jesus Christ Hebrews 10: 19 which says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and a living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled what is it the blood of sprinkling having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised Hallelujah if you've received the blood of Jesus Christ and you've received the washing of the Water by the word hold fast the confession of your faith he will send his Spirit to Quicken you he's obligated to his word oh Hallelujah this Rapture this Rapture Showdown this is not an event hope you're with me the body change is an event you will be changed in the moment in twinkling of an eye but the Rapture is a process the Rapture is the changing of you from the inside out amen it's bringing you into Rapture condition amen and he would talk about in the message the Rapture he would say these three things we know about it in first Thessalonians chapter 4 where he'd say Comfort one another with these words why don't I just read it to you real quick cuz I like that scripture a lot he said I would not have you ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him oh wow then which sleep will God bring with him oh and he says I'm sorry I just read that the first time that way so it's forgive me get a little something fresh here says for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain from the co unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep and the Lord himself tell descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the Archangel with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so we shall be with the Lord a so we shall ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen this is the process of the Rapture but he says in the message the Rapture he says these three things a shout of voice and a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears Jesus does all three of them when he's descending he does all three them as he is coming down into his many membered bride with a shout with a voice with a trumpet and that's why we're so special about that verse when he says them which are asleep in Jesus will God bring with him that as he is descending down Hallelujah that he's coming and bringing him with him because he says he does all three as he is coming he says the first thing a shout which was then he says a shout what is it it's a message that goes first the living bread of life to bring forth a bride amen we've had the message in our day it's gone forth around the world seven times to do what to bring forth a bride amen it's God's message to call out a bride the first is a shout and then a voice and then a trump and and and the shout of the messenger getting the people ready and the second is the voice of the Resurrection the voice of the Resurrection remember he does all three as he comes down the first was the shout so in the shout when the message was going forth that was part Christ coming down that was a part of his dissension in him coming down it was his word coming as brother Bram would call it but now as he's coming down not only a shout but a voice which the voice is the voice of the Archangel that will call the dead in Christ out of the Grave because it's a part of him coming down oh hallelujah it's the same voice he says that was there in in St John 11 38-34 where you find he come down to Mary and to Martha oh praise be to God as he walked in that day to Mary and Martha and as he was as they they sent out word and they said our your your friend Lazarus he's sick please come and heal him we know the story so well but we know that Jesus he turned the other direction and he walked even further he wasn't concerned why because God had showed him this was not the way it was going to be but he told them don't worry this sickness is not unto death oh Hallelujah sometimes we get so confused in ourselves we call things dead when they're not dead Jesus said they ain't dead they're just asleep amen they've just caught on I don't know about you my mother passed away about 12 years ago I'm looking forward to seeing her just any day now I was in my own office this morning on my own office I guess it was down in the guest room we were down there and I was just thinking on the Lord and I just be to weep his presence come in the room I said Lord I want to see Mama again I don't understand what that means but I want to tell you it's a reality there's a Resurrection coming some morning between 6:00 and 9 it's going to happen oh praise be to God it's God himself descending down into a many membered Pride as he come down he said this sickness is not unto death and he went away and he finally said all right we're going to go down and we're going to go to Lazarus after four days and as he finally went down there the he said he sleeps and the disciples said oh that's wonderful he sleeps that does him good when you're sick sleep does a great thing and they were right but he said let me understand in your language he's not sleeping as you would call sleeping he's dead but now as he finally comes down Mary Martha Mary's there Weeping at the grave and they told him and Martha ran to Jesus said Lord if you would have been here my Lazarus would not have died but Jesus having perfect faith in the perfect God which he was was able to look at it and say what is Divine Healing but the earnest of the Resurrection don't you know that I am the resurrection and the life don't you know that if you would believe all things are possible to them that believe oh Hallelujah and he came right on down there where they where they were at and he come right to the gravide he said roll away the stone Oh by now he stinketh Lord I don't want to roll away this in my life this is too much I've hid this for years don't make me confess it don't make me confess my sins one to another but the Bible says confess your faults one to another that you be healed amen no matter how much it stinks roll away the stone let God deal with it in your life Hallelujah as he come right on down there and he said R finally they said all right Lord at Thy word and they rolled away a stone and that voice spoke up brother said if he had not said Lazarus every grave would have opened oh what a awesome God we serve why because it's the same one today what is he going to say what is he going to say as he's descending down that the graves would open he says the same voice that spoke and said Lazarus come forth he's not going to say this name and that name and this thing it'll be M Jesus Christ all them that are deaded me come forth Hallelujah if he wasn't that specific every sinner would rais and it would be a general Resurrection because that's how powerful he is oh Hallelujah but it wasn't just the voice he says that's it getting the bride together then the resurrection of the Dead Sea caught up together with him it's the trumpet now watch these three things a trumpet he says a shout a voice a trumpet the third thing is a trumpet which always the Feast of the trumpets is calling the people to a feast there'll be the bride supper hallelujah oh praise be to God there'll be a bride supper the Lamb's supper with the bride in the sky first thing that comes forth of the message calling the bride the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the the ones that have gone on back in the other ages even caught up together all down through the sleeping bride through seven Church ages not just the ones we can Name by name and those that are we we we knew personally but it'll be John Wesley and all them under his message it'll be Martin Luther and all them under his message it it will be St Columbus and all them under his message H Columba and it'll be St Martin and all them under his message it'll be irenius and all them under his message all the bride in seven Church ages St Paul and all them oh Hallelujah St Paul will raise up again St Peter will come up again John and James and Jude and all these ones will come up again walking around in Jerusalem thinking what is all these things hallelujah what a time it'll be and then the trumpet will sound and we'll go be with the Lord forever let me just say this this is not some far out Revelation this is where the bride of Christ is living at today we are right there on the precipice of time when you'll hear you'll you'll not Hallelujah you'll not hear a literal sound of a trumpet I don't believe that for a moment because it was the voice behind the voice that was the message Hallelujah it was a shout it was a spiritual shout that went out it was Revelation that went forth you'll not hear a little voice that spoke or a little burning of fire in darkness because it says you are not come unto the mountain that can be touched with hands you are not come don't look for something in these three dimensions of of light space and time where we we dwell and we see all these things and we we even contact the fourth dimension through our cellular devices and these other things and television and whatnot and we don't he says don't don't look for those things you're not come to the mountain that can be touched that was what brother BR was talking about when they said when he preached the seals and they asked questions and answers they said should we all move to Jeffersonville should should we all move because you he talked about in the in the future home and he talked about how the the the where it would be 1500 miles by 1500 miles 1500 miles of the New Jerusalem and he said it would be like from here to here and they all got all excited said we should all go get within that that range right are you with me because I thought that that that's that's got to be it but he says it's not a natural Mountain it's not something that's natural in this realm in this sinful world it's a spiritual Mountain it's a private personal Showdown that's not your Mountain but you are come to a spiritual Mountain a spiritual meeting Place brother bam says the Revelation Jesus Christ he says the lamb the high priest holding his blood Hallelujah holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy sheat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty that is his present offit that is what he is doing now pleading his blood for our sins but one day the lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah and he will bring forth he will come forth in power and glory and take his authority to reign as king he is the coming King on this Earth of this Earth of course that does not mean that does not say that he is not a king now for he is a king he's the king of saints right now it is a spiritual Kingdom we could look at the Book of Luke where he say the kingdom of God is where within you you've come to a spiritual Kingdom you say it is not the world's systems even as you are not of the world that's the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king Hallelujah he temperates all all of our dealings we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth that is why our women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all of those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much that is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin our Dominion is a dominion over sin it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us Hallelujah that kingdom is in power right now in the spirit that indwells you amen every Kingdom on Earth is going to be tore down but ours will remain amen this is always oh my we can look over at Daniel I don't know if I put it in here but Daniel when he would talk about the the the the the the vision of Nebuchadnezzar that he said oh the head of gold and the shoulders and arms of bra of silver over and the the chest of brass and the legs and the feet and he said and all these things he saids but there was a rock you and out without hands that come down and it shattered that image we know what that is amen that's why today when when the world's going around all concerned about China I'm not worried about China at all becoming some kind of superpower I ain't worried about Russia why because the last Kingdom that was there was partly strong partly weak it's over the last kingdom is in power right now is paple and and and mixed with with the with with the with the image that with the image to the Beast that gives his power to the Beast it was all of these mixed in together United States of America and then Russia and and the papal Rome all giving their power to one but he says it's it's weak there's a there's a sorry I know I didn't study that out but there's there's a rock he out without hands comes down the mountain crushes that all wipes it all off the face of the Earth there is one Kingdom which will remain it's a spiritual Kingdom this has been the trouble with Pentecost even always looking for a physical manifestation trying to build a kingdom on this earth when Jesus said a wicked and an adulterous generation seeks after a sign if you can't believe the sign that has already been given today you said in each Showdown there's a pillar of fire and there's a cloud in the first Showdown it was the pillar of fire that came down and consumed the sacrifice there was a cloud about the size of the man hands in the next one there's a pillar of fire that was in Christ the attribute of the fullness of God and there was a cloud that overshadow him now in this showdown he's given us again a pillar of Fire fire and allowed his picture to be taken and he gave us a cloud and allowed its picture to be taken Hallelujah a cloud of Supernatural cloud of angels Wings B would say now the P now science has taken the picture you've seen it on the Associated Press they didn't know what it was a cloud hanging 26 mil high and 15 mil or 20 mi above even where where where vapor is they don't know what it is what's all going on they're trying under investigation he says he says but I was standing right on under it and he says and those seven angels roared out their voices of those Seven Seals standing there and the witness three of us as a witness of these things that was prophesied on the tape s what time is it and there now we are trying to find out it's a mystery to them some of them said go go why don't you go tell them it would it would just be like when the angel of the Lord appeared here in Houston Texas in the light and told the people all my life he says I've seen that like but the church knows it science knows this but they still won't believe it oh my your Showdown though it's private between you and God he gave you a supernatural witness that the world still won't believe but you believe amen but The Showdown is is right there in your heart then would talk about the vision he would have of the three puls especially the one of the Third PA he say now he says there is something different between the angel of the Lord and that light the Loos he says because I heard something moving he says when he when he when he got brought up into a high place and he be to look down he be to see them lining up like a prayer line and seeing this little room and he said then something come like a woo woo woo and like a fire whooping around licking blaze it left me and it went right down over the top of the audience and it went and stood over on top of that little building then it settled down on top of it and then when it did this one that was standing by me behind me the same voice the Angel's voice he said I'll meet you in there and that this is the third F poll and that nobody will know nothing about it oh praise God it's a personal private Showdown he said well I don't understand why in there why there he said it's not a public show this time I don't understand going into a closet like that and he said it's not is it not written of the Lord when thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites who like to be heard before man but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who seeth in secret and he who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly what were they do in another place he talked about one went in in a Stretcher and they brought the stretcher in they laid it there and the woman that was on the stret stretcher came out carrying the stretcher and he said what happened there she said I don't know but I walked in on it I got carried in on it and I walked out with it Hallelujah another one went in the crutches and he came out carrying the crutches he said I don't know what happened but God made me completely whole what was it the fullness of the attribute of God had gone down and had overshadowed that place saying I'll meet you in there this is the third pole this is the third poll is the same thing is saying this is the seventh seal the seventh seal is Jesus Christ himself as it says in Revelation there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour how could there possibly be silence when the presence of God is there because they were so taken back by the fact that God had so unveiled himself to a people and so come right down and left the bull works of Heaven again and come right down into a people where he would once again be standing in the midst of his church receiving all of the Glory Hallelujah oh praise be to God it's a secret place B describes the Simplicity of it he says did you ever walk out in the morning in the real fresh cool feeling God has refreshed the Earth there's a fragrance there did you ever go into the Rose Garden down place where they got the honeysuckles the honeysuckles don't smell much In the Heat of the day but it's early in the morning when all the air has been purified when that Aroma of the honeysuckle let a man he says that's out fighting and stewing never get such of Aroma if if you'll never get much of Aroma from the that from that of the Gospel but let him get alone one time in the Stillness of God oh Hallelujah he to talk about it just like the Earth gets renewed day by day his mercies are made new every morning but it begins to talk about a way of a man you ever see a man so fussing and stewing and always trying to push P push push you don't get much of the aroma of the Gospel from that but let that same man just get alone with God every man that ever comes to the pulpit ought to dwell alone first then comes the fruits yielding forth its fruits every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away will yield the fruits of righteousness peace love joy longsuffering goodness gentleness patience don't us about these other things get that in your life and you'll never get it until you hide away with God into that land of adoption Hallelujah that's hidden life in Christ that place he says he taken from him a charger of the blood oh my this is beautiful say he taken from him a charge of the blood the blood of the Lamb the blood of the atonement he was the anointed he was anointed with the rose of Sharon and running down his beard plumbed to the Hem of of his skirts he was walking into the inner Court talking of the high priest into the presence of God and when he went in behind there the veil fell behind him and he was shut out he was allowed to do that once a year the high priest would go in and take the blood of the Lamb he'd be Anointed with the rose of Sharon all the way from the head all the way down to the Hem of His robe and he'd have to walk in a certain way so that way his the bells and the pomegranates played holy holy holy unto the Lord God Almighty and as he walked in there and he opened up the veil as he closed that Veil behind him it was there didn't matter what was going on outside anymore it didn't matter what the other priests were doing anymore there was one focus it was him and God Alone he had a purpose he had something that to do and he was there with the blood of je the blood of the Lamb that he was there to present it upon the mercy seat we have the blood of sprinkling we've come to Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Mount Zion and he says if there is there is a hiding place and Abiding Place where we can walk in the presence of God and be hid from the things of the world and you don't hear them no more it's soundproof hallelujah it's soundproof oh praise be to God the world is on the elide Gasping and looking but you're on the inside in the presence of the Eternal Everlasting God eating from the Mana that will last and span for years hundreds of years it never got contaminated never did it never did it give out and a man that once walks into God and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of God eating the hidden Mana oh praise be to God he's found a secret place he's went behind the veil the door closes he don't see the world no more them doors are made of shound proof by sheep skin and goost skins and this is made soundproof by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that hides a man in Christ and now he becomes a new creature and he walks daily before him in this manner what a beautiful picture of the believer in the presence of God all things are his then all things are given to Christ all things that God was he poured into Christ and all things that Christ was he poured into the church you are come unto Mount Zion are you still with me Hallelujah un the city of the Living God it's a spiritual Kingdom but Paul gives us drops in these hints these little things of what exactly it is you are com into the city of the Living God Revelations 21: 1-3 says and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband praise be to God we can look at Galatians 4:22 says for it is written that Abra had two sons one by the bondade the other by the free woman and he who has he who was of the Bond woman was born after the Flesh and the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory that these things are two covenants one from Mount Si which gendereth to bondage which is Hagar and the other for this Hagar is of Mount Si in Arabia and anth and anth to Jerusalem which is now and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above that's the New Jerusalem that's the one that comes down from God out of Heaven he says the Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all hallelujah what was it that he took the feminist Spirit out of himself right there at Calvary he's the still the masculine but he had a bride the his feminist spirit that he brought back down onto the church that she could continually bring forth children unto the Lord oh praise be to God for it is written Rejoice thou baren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travail us for the desolate hath many more children than that than she which hath a husband if you don't know what that's talking about just look around you there ain't a lot of people here but you can drive by denominational Church there's hundreds there's thousands they which don't have a husband they are left their first love a long time ago and yet they are garnering people after people after people after people and it seems they've got a lot but they haven't birthed one of them it's illegitimate children that's what it is but now we Brethren as Isaac are children of the promise but as then as then he which was born born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman Hallelujah they don't have the same inheritance so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free oh praise be to God you are come unto mount Zion unto the city of the Living God wonder if we could just take Psalms chapter 48 real quick it's just too good to pass by I trust you're feeling good as I said last night if you need to stand and Shake Yourself you just stand and Shake Yourself lift up those weary hands straighten out those feeble knees Hallelujah let God come in you Psalms 48 said great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God in the mountain of his Holiness where's the praise that he's received in the city of our God what's that the New Jerusalem was that his bride he says in the mountain of his Holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion Oh My on the sides of the north the city of the great king praise be to God the sides of the north the place in the Tabernacle that was under the eagle anointing Hallelujah that's the anointing that we are under in this day that's the anointing the bride is under he says that bride is the joy of the whole earth praise be to God God Is Knowing in her palaces for a refuge oh praise God God Is Knowing in our palaces as our refuge and he says for Lo the king kings are assembled together they pass by together they sought and so they marveled and they were TR troubled and hasted Away fear took a hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail and thou break the ships of torches with an East Wind Hallelujah as he as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts in the city of our God God will establish it forever oh praise be to God we have thought of thy loving kindness oh God in the midst of thy Temple what is his Temple today it's you know you not that your temp your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost amen he says according to thy name oh God so is thy praise unto the ends of the Earth thy right hand is full of righteousness let Mount Zion Rejoice let the daughters of Judah be glad because of thy judgment walk about Zion go about her tell the towers thereof Mark ye all of her bullworks consider her palaces that you may tell it to the generations following for this God is our God forever and ever and he will be our guide even unto death the thoughts that God thinks of you thoughts of Peace thoughts of an expected and thoughts of Joy he loves you he's camped about you he walks around your walls he considers your Towers he considers your palaces what are those your testimonies the wonderful things that God has done for you he looks at those things he says this is what I have done this is what I have built up this is my city this is my beloved oh praise be to God you have come to the city of our God and to an innumerable company of angels Hallelujah as we know in the Bible as they looked and there was Elisha that was there in Dothan and they can passed about the city and the servant gazy come to him and he said I could pass all about it and Elijah says there's more with us than there is with them what are you talking about they we don't got nothing we got a few broken up bows and some arrows and some of this and some of that we don't really have have an army we're terrified what are we going to do he said don't worry about it Lord open his eyes all around in the Hills Chariots of Fire and the horsemen thereof says you've come to an innumerable company of angels where it talks about in Hebrews 1: 13- 14 says but to which the Ang which of the Angels said he at that time sit on my right hand until I make th thine enemies thy foot stol he says are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister to them who shall be Heirs of Salvation what are they doing you've come to an innumerable company of angels that have a one sole purpose to minister to his bride oh how blessed you are you've come to the general assembly of the Church of the firstborn Colossians 1: 13 says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the forgiv foress of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him all were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and isible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him for he is before all things and by him all things consist he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all that in all things he might have the preeminence oh praise be to God when we read that quote and say we're flesh of his flesh with bone of his bone life of his life Spirit of his Spirit she is him that doesn't mean I'm your Redeemer he's the Redeemer he's the one he's the masculine he's the one that provides he's the one that gives we are the feminine we're the ones that are in subjection to the Lord Jesus Christ that he would have the preeminence his in all things praise be to God he says you are come to the spirits of just men made perfect oh praise be to God I'm not going to have time to get into that one properly but it says you are come into the spirits of just man made perfect in other words you are a three threep part being we recognize that right you are a soul you are a spirit and you have a flesh in your flesh you have five senses you got T see taste feel smell and hear in your spirit you've still got five senses you've got conscience reasonings memory affections and what was it imagination thank you I knew I said it too fast and I got confused imagination you've still got those five senses that are there but down in your soul there's either Faith or there's doubt there either believe or you don't believe it's one way or the other that's your free moral agency that you have a right to believe and now that you are justified by the by the blood of Jesus Christ it says you've come to the spirit of just men made perfect that not only are we living in an age of justification not only are we living in an age of sanctification not not only are we living in an age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you are living in an age in which God has provided a means for you to be able to come to Perfection this Perfection I believe as your pastors are speaking is not a Perfection where you would just never make a mistake but rather it is a maturity you've come to the spirits of just men made mature that not only is it a seal of the Holy Ghost upon your soul but also it begins to work out from your soul and the Holy Spirit begins to Quicken your spirit it begins to Quicken your memory oh praise be to God I might be the only one that believes this but I'm going to say it the way I believe it and your pastor can correct me if you wants but God is able to Quicken your memory so much that just as Jesus is able to forgive and forget you are able by the Holy Ghost to forgive and Let It Go Hallelujah let the blood of Jesus Christ so bury those things down in your life that it doesn't even come into your remembrance anymore let the Holy Spirit affect your memory that the former things would not even come into mind what you want were it's not who you are anymore as brother bam would say I'm not the son of Charles and El branam I'm the son of Jesus Christ I'm not the son of till andison d i the son of Jesus Christ Hallelujah those things that I made those mistakes and those old things those things have passed away all things are made new Hallelujah I'm a new creature in Jesus Christ it can affect your memory and that Holy Ghost can even move out and begin to affect your your affections where it says set your affections on things about above the things that you once loved you don't love them anymore cuz the Holy Ghost is maturing your spirit it's bringing your spirit into maturity where you can have an affection for the things of God oh saints of God young people you've got a right to go before God you say Lord I spend time in these things I do these things I really enjoy them they're not sinful and I enjoy them and Lord I'm being asked to lay them down I'm asking you Lord to fill my life with a joy that is greater than what the things of the world ever brought me and I'm telling you by the blood of Jesus you can enter boldly into the presence of God and you have a right to ask him and say God if you want me to lay it down you fill me up with the Holy Ghost you give me a joy you give me a peace you set my affections give me something that I love in the word of God that I just can't get enough of oh Hallelujah he can affect those things the Holy Ghost that's in you the word of God wanting to bring to your spirit to Perfection to to bring you even your imagination into a perfect use Hallelujah that brother Bram would talk about the right use of imagination where he say if you are sick you just project an image before you of yourself well and then walk into that by faith that's the proper use of imagination how am I going to imagine that you got an unbelieving family you projected image of that believing family sitting with you in the Pew this morning and you walk into that by faith believing God is going to give you those children those spouses God is going to give you those loved ones those Brothers those sisters whatever it may be you've got to bring your spirit subject to the word of God and bring about the correct use of imagination the correct use of reasonings is to take the word and compare scripture with scripture compare quote with quote instead of trying to go about and reason with it with the things of the world science has no place in the scripture the things of the world they don't have any place you can't disprove God with science the further they get in science the more they prove he's real they just can't get away from it because God created the whole thing hallelujah hallelujah the spirits of just man made perfect you are come unto the church the general assembly of the Church of the firstborn you are a new creature in Christ Jesus Galatians 6:14 says but God forbid that I should Glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto him and I unto the world for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature in Christ Jesus Oh My is it okay if we dwell on this a little bit is the word okay this morning trust you're with me I just God laid something on my heart this morning just in such a fervency in such a way sitting there in the back office brother as you begin to sing only believe presence of God came back in again and God's got something for you this morning Jesus in Jesus Christ neither circumcision aileth anything that word aileth the Greek word for ath means to have power neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any power in Christ that does not move God but a new creature has power with God Matthew 5: 13 and 14 says you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its Savor wherewith shall it be salted it is henceforth good for nothing in other words it has no power what's the power of salt it's the Savor that it brings amen it increases the the taste of the food he says but it's lost it it's good for nothing and should but to be cast out and trotten underf foot of man ye are the light of the world a city that is set on the hill cannot be hit Mark 9:18 tells us of a scenario of a man that Jesus was there and and his disciples had gone and tried to heal this boy who would cast himself into the fire and foth and nashes with his teeth and pineth away and he would do all these things and the disciples could not cast out the devil and they brought the young boy to Jesus in markk chapter 9 and it it says that whatsoever in verse 18 says and what wheresoever he taketh him he teth him and he foth and nashes with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to thy disciples and they could not cast him out in other words they had no power over him they could not and Jesus answered him they and he answered him Jesus and saith oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer for you bring him unto me now I want to just take this and and maybe break down faith for a minute for you because it really brings a deeper understanding of what faith is and then faithless is as as Jesus would use this word here where he says oh faithless generation which is a Greek word there which is Epistles which is the adjective which is op opposite to substance faith in other words he's saying oh you generation that has a lack of substance faith and now he says in Mark 9:2 24 it says in straight way the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief now this is a couple more Greek words that I just you need to break it down this way so you understand what he's talking about because it seems like a contradiction I believe but help that I don't believe and he this word here believe is piso which is just simply to believe I believe but to help thou my unbelief unbelief is episa which is the noun opposite of substance Faith remember we said epist apistos is the adjective it means somebody that has no fa that that that he's saying you have no faith he's talking about an entire generation he's giving it an object but rather this now is the noun he says I the the the n episa as the opposite he says I believe you Lord but I don't have any substance faith I believe you I want to believe the word but I don't have any substance to really claim what the word is he says now Hebrews 11:1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen substance is a hypostasis that's the Greek word forgive me I don't speak Greek so if I'm saying it the wrong way forgive me I speak every language by Greek and that's Greek to me hypostasis hypostasis and he says that's the setting or the placing under a substance is Faith is a substance which in the Greek is it's the placing under or the foundation that is in actual existence the substance that all else is built upon in verse three of the same chapter it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made by things which do appear faith is the foundation on which all else is built it's why when you look at the stature of a perfect man and you look at it what's the foundation of it faith you can't build anything else upon it without that sure Foundation of faith we know what it talks about in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and in the beginning the word went forth from God in the form of AUST we know in Genesis 1:2 it says and the Earth was without form and void and darkness upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water so God went out from himself in the form of the logos begin to move upon the face of the water and that would begin to speak and it would begin to bring about Hebrews 1:3 The Same Spirit In other words that is brooding over his first creation that was his natural his first Creation in the beginning God spoke but now he says Jesus Christ is the beginning of a new creation and he says now that same spirit that was brooding over that first creation is the same spirit that now Broods over the second creation The Same Spirit that was able to bring it all to pass and did not fail is the same spirit that now is making sure this creation will be made manifest with the in other words the seed which the seed is the word of God the spoken word is the Original Seed amen the the seed is the word of God that he spoke into your life and he now Broods over that seed to make sure it brings to pass that which it was meant to bring says who being Hebrews 1:3 says who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power this is the Lord Jesus Christ when we when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high says the express image of his person who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person I don't know can you keep that scripture up there and go to a different scripture is that possible Hebrews chapter 3:14 I don't know if you can keep the two up there but says and for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end Andrew where you going with all this this is why it's important to break this down this word our confidence and the person these words are the same word as substance the person of Jesus Christ in US other words the express image of his person that that Jesus Christ is the image that the whole thing was built upon it was on Jesus he's all of it all of the word of God is the Lord Jesus Christ every scripture every verse every line I'm just maybe going about a long way to say brother says if you don't see Christ in every verse of the Bible go back and read it again it's all built upon him but then he goes on to say and our confidence is the same as our substance so then if I could put it all together for you in a statement he says the person of Jesus Christ in US is our actual confidence in the Integrity the stability and reality that every word of God is the truth the person of Jesus Christ in you is the actual substance of your faith that when the man come to him and said Lord I believe he's saying but I don't have a revelation of who you are I believe you but it ain't Revelation help my Revelation help me to get a substance of the faith that I have brother Brandon would make a statement he said in a Believer is in the message perfect Faith 1963 makes a short statement here he says and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you he is the quickening power we quoted it last night if the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal bodies and he would go on and say by by the spirit that dwelleth in you and he says verse 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh but if we live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and that ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God there's a real substance there it's a reality in the heart of every believer it's not just a hop so or a maybe so it's more real than me standing right here today that's hard to grasp because we live in this realm in our flesh but in the reality of the Eternal realm where Jesus Christ is it's more real he says and if children then heirs HS of God and Joint airs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we shall also be glorified together can we go further or I'm out of time I got one amen two amen three amen all right I didn't put a time limit to those amens so I'll say it was an hour per one two brother brand would talk about the Ascension of Jesus Christ in Acts chapter one where he say watch him as he goes about a few days later after he's gathered his disciples on the bank he's preaching to them and those last beautiful lips of his working there bringing forth words says go ye into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he's beginning he says and these signs shall follow them that believe and then in Acts one as he begins to speak unto them says go and wait and don't don't don't preach now wait till you're endued with power from on high then you go forth and preach and he says and as he begins to speak these wonderful words he begin to say that that they begin to see daylight coming under his feet he said what's the matter God showing his power raising up what is he he is defying every law of gravity he's being lifted up why is it he's the creator of gravitation and and there here he is he ascends up he ascends on up till he gets up on high and he sits down quietly at the feet of the Majesty on high glory to God he says there he is with all power in Heaven and Earth is in his hands not even one little wave can move excuse me felt that coming not even one little wave can move on the ocean without him permitting it that's a very good quote for right here in New Finland not even one Mo wave can move on that ocean out there without him permitting it that's his power Hallelujah and that power of the same thing is working in US same quote to make us new creatures in Christ Jesus Oh Brother there's where power comes as our faith brings brings down our faith which is love what's love God is love he's the substance of our faith it brings all all fear it casts away all fear that we think God wouldn't keep his word when I saw the very love and the grace of Christ then it brings him right down to us what's he doing as he's coming down the shout the voice and the trumpet it's the word coming of God coming down to catch away his bride he says the mighty power of God begins to work into the church love that conquers I tell you love is the most powerful thing there is in the world there's nothing will take its place but love if you read on in in Hebrews chapter 12 and you get right down to the end where it says we've received a kingdom which cannot be shaken that we may serve god with with reverence and with Godly fear for our God is a consuming fire praise be to God and verse one of the next one is let Brotherly Love continue love is the the most powerful force that's in the earth there's nothing that could take its place it's love and perfect Faith he says now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are why could we sing a song like Lord all I have to do is praise why because you've got faith in what you are that I'm not the one doing the work I can just praise God that he's already done it and he's already paid the price and I can walk into his great Variety Store and I can go get whatever I have need of by faith because it's him in me doing the work and I'm the one resting in him Hallelujah have faith in what the word says you are Jesus had faith in the word of God that said that he said is written of me didn't David the psalm saying the prophets and all them speak of him saying I am the bread of life that comes from God out of Heaven amen I am the tree of life that was in the Garden of Eden I am all these things he said I am that I am he knew that with perfect faith that he was anointed Messiah and that the spirit of God was upon him and now I in myself do nothing but it's my faith in God that's why he says I do nothing but what the father shows me that doeth the son likewise why because he says that's me it's not wasn't a different oh Saints I hope we can catch this it's not a different relationship that you have with God than what Jesus had with God let me scroll right down here to a scripture I've got in the bottom oh my I'm not even halfway through the notes he says sanctify them John chapter 17:17 says sanctify them through the truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me in the into the world so even so I have sent them into the world that for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for also but them also which Shall Believe on me through their word as Paul would write faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God and he says but how would they hear unless some of us went and ministered but he says all them that would come to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ by the hearing of the word of God Amen he says I pray for all of them praise the Lord Jesus Christ 2 years ago didn't only die for you he prayed for you Hallelujah though he says what did he pray that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me and the glory which thou givest me I have given them that they may be one even as as we are one the relationship that you have with God is Not different than the relationship that Jesus had with God and we know that Jesus had to pray constantly to stay in touch with the spirit the attribute of the fullness of God that was within him that we have it in portion but it is the same relationship Hallelujah that he might be the first born among many brethren in other words he was a the son and you are a son of God God hallelujah that it was we in our day was a son of man revealing the son of man I'll say it this way you are a son of God revealing the Son of God In Our Generation Hallelujah he says I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and H has loved them as thou Hast loved me oh praise be to God Jesus would be able to ride and said he that believeth on me because I go unto the father you could do the Greater Works you could do the Greater Works we know how it was that Jesus had more success in the in the ministry of the William brandom than he did in his own of brother bam than he did in his own oh my you are a new creature in Christ Jesus let me go back here to the church age book need to sing a song and come back how's be honest with you I I'm I've skipped a couple pages and I'm now at page eight out of 17 I told you I wasn't starting a timer but I'm starting to feel guilty about it says but now Church age book brother bam says now he is standing in the midst of the church remember as he comes down he does all three things but he says but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in the last days he calls himself the author of The Creation of God he says this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself that he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom creating his own bride like Mary was the human incubator and she carried the holy ghost child the holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God and he he was a new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of a new of this new race he is the head of this new race Colossians 1118 we read it he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the P preeminence and in 2 Corinthians 5:17 says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new he says there you can see that that that that through man was the older old order of creation Now in Union with Christ he has become a new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 says for ye are the workmanship of God created in Union with Christ unto good works we could go all it on it says the new creation is not the old creation made over it's a new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one amen and now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed under New Creation that he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation Hallelujah that is why we could look right he could look right down he said oh he said this this purpose took form through election this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this is why he could look right down in the last stage and he and when all would be over and he could see himself standing in the midst of the church as the new author of this new creation his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption how else could he know that he would be standing there in the midst of the church receiving the glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order to that his purpose and good pleasure would be brought to pass or aren't you glad that you belong to him it's the person of Jesus Christ in the individual that is the actual substance of our faith the same quickening power in Jesus that could stand there and say when Jesus said destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up again the same one that Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again the same one that could say of assurity I am the resurrection of the life why because he knew what the word of God said that he was and he had perfect faith in that to speak with that confidence of real substance faith that is the same quickening power in the born again son and daughter of God today he says when the Holy Ghost comes into you and convince him to concern he says he makes you a new creature yes sir he makes you a new creature he puts himself within you let's this next statement and he says and you are his Idol think of what God's got for you he says he puts himself within you and you are his Idol you he is living inside of you working and moving his own way in you what is an idol an idol is a dead substance that is the image of a God in and of itself it has no power but what he represents is an all powerful being we as Believers are nothing but a few cents worth of Earthly elements and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you we read that that's not a perfect faith brother Brown says the believer is the faith of God that moves in you other words it's not you moving your flesh is not the believer neither is your spirit but the believer is on the inside of the inside brother B says that's the real you who you are in your Soul that's the real you and it needs to push out from that in order to bring the rest of it into subjection you are written Epistles read of all men ye are our epistle written in your hearts he would say no one and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be an Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in the tables of stone but on fleshly tables of your heart the same quickening power that was in Christ dwells in you you cannot help but believe and have real confidence in the word of God substance faith is not based on your ability it's not based on your DNA it's not based on your IQ it's not based on your wellbeing it's not based on how strong you feel it's not based on your Bloodlines or your lineage it is not based on any of those things because this creation has nothing to do it is absolutely distinct from the old creation because it is a new creation by his spirit that you are born into Christ Jesus old things are passed away behold all things are made new Hallelujah it is based upon the substance faith that is the person of Jesus Christ indwelling your soul that is why you can only have faith in there and doubt cannot exist Christ in you the hope of glory because it shall Quicken your mortal body how can it fail it raised up Christ how can it fail the new birth is the then the down payment of the earnest of the body change he says in another place he says but this Plan of Salvation is an individual affair with you speaking in tongues is a gift of God I love the way he differentiates this here he says salvation is in an individual affair with you speaking in tongues is a gift of God dancing in the spirit is the presence and glory of God this is from the message identification 1963 he says but you but for you to let your character be molded into the image of God that he projects himself and you are his Idol walking on Earth the expressed image of him and the scripture talk about Jesus that way that he's the expressed image of God all that was in Christ he poured into the church that you are now the expressed image of God what's in you is Incorruptible it cannot corrupt it cannot be corrupted neither can it decay that's that's why it was say seal until the day of your Redemption it is not flexible it stands firm it has power to overcome any enemy any obstacle or any trial as brother Bram would tell us Faith knows no obstacle real substance faith it doesn't matter what comes against it it will overcome it that is the believer how could I not believe that doesn't mean we use it for anything he would say our desires is to see him glorified not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove that he's alive living in us give us the quickening power that G and give us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being bride of him and seeing his same Vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead Hallelujah that's the only thing that will convince the unbeliever when they see Christ Living in you br would talk about the the the do rehead and where he would go and talk to the Muslim and he said the Muslim made it so he had to hang his head because he realized everything I had that Muslim had but he said but I know there's one man that makes the scriptures live there's somebody that can make Jesus live I I believe it's not just one man but that was the wave sheath over us that we're to come to that maturity and I believe we're coming there that that is where it could be that we are able to make Jesus live in our day the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power oh God help us receive it help us to believe it see it just depends on what attitude you take to it whether it's going to do you any good or not you've got to believe it if you don't believe it it won't help you one bit far be it from any Christian trying to say they have power they don't have power surely we don't claim to have power we only it's only Jesus Christ in us the real believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified Christ a real believer wants one thing and that's to see you to see the glorified Christ makes any difference oh a real Mount true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ and any True Believer that's that's that's that's what's in his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's trying to get the people to see see God's word which is Christ magnified and fulfilling the promise for this day in this great hour of Resurrection notice and it gives them the joy to know that we are with him and flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone what a joy that's that's the only thing that the real believer cares about they don't care about a denomination they don't care about an organization they don't care about what other women think they don't care certainly not they won't care about those things about what these other women do and these men that do things they won't hang their baby around with some organization keep them from putting it out they're afraid they won't have a meal ticket they don't care about any of those things it's nonsense to them there's only one true heart's desire that is to see Jesus Christ glorified their conduct must be with God it must absolutely nothing else just glory to Jesus Christ say what is Jesus he is the word that's right and notice and seeing his name Vindicated same Vindicated method proving his resurrection now what is what is it seeing your life by his promised word when he said he's the same yesterday today and forever proving that he's still alive let me close with a couple quotes here if that's okay I'm bringing it to a close but Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about perfect Faith he said he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith and a perfect God which he was if he lived in perfect if we lived in the perfect faith of a Christian and what we are we would be a Mystic to the world people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do hallelujah what the spirit said do you would do what it says don't do you would not do amen that's the way a real believer walks in what the spirit says to do we ought never to be concerned when we're sharing the word with somebody and they say well they don't understand it just speak the word to them if there's a seat of God in there it will strike sometimes we do away the power of God by trying to explain it and explain it and trying to make an unbeliever understand he says you won't understand the Kingdom of Heaven except you be born again so just speak the word and let God do the increase amen that's the way it is with a real believer they're a Mystic and people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus lived where nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't even understand him when he spoke to them when he say wow you talk to us in riddles we don't understand this how can this be and there wasn't in the world that he lived in why they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting to bride of material Oh see now you're getting into rapturing condition Hallelujah that means that each one of us not just a pastor or a deacon or a trustee that means the leoty every individual walks in the world with God Alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody but you and God see he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says you're not there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you just walk right on no wonder brother Bam could stand there with perfect discernment after perfect discernment after perfect discernment he could go out and see visions and tell things and say Justus sayth the Lord this is going to come to pass write it down the fles of your Bible if it doesn't happen you could write false C Prophet across my back and walked me through the streets why because he had a perfect faith in what God said he was he believed when God said it he said it it has to be so I don't care how ridiculous it seems it has to happen and the most ridiculous thing that I personally ever heard is that this lousy stupid flesh would put on immortality that this corruption would put on incorruption but it doesn't matter how ridiculous it seems he said it would happen it will happen hallelujah we're taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us to resist is simply just to turn him down just resist him just walk away from it God said a certain thing no matter what the devil's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says he that has an ear that listens see what the spirit is saying to the churches the one that's got the listening post that catches what the spirit is saying to the churches are you catching this morning what Jesus is trying to say to the church oh Hallelujah your relationship with God is just the same way Jesus is was you've got an a direct line right to the throne room of God hallelujah ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you amen Jesus in the message that day on Calvary let me close with this will be my last quote in that day on Calvary Jesus thanked the father that he hid it from the educated the shrewd the wise The Prudent and revealed it to babes such as would come to Calvary now watch Jesus Jesus said watch how it all started the works that I do he said he's do he said he's doing them right now the works that I'm doing now Healing The Sick raising the dead Open the Eyes to the blind these works that you do that the these Works shall you do also you'll do these if you believe in me you do these works and when when the greater than this shall you do for I go to my father then he goes on and says a little while and the world will see me no more yet you'll see me I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I will not leave you comfortless I will pray the father and he'll send you the comforter which is the holy ghost from the world that the world cannot receive but you can receive him now notice he says the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick and to cast out devils in prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers says the Holy Ghost is coming and is given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took stooped degraded men and women lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers as he said in the token message it's a full obedience to the word of God that entitles you to the Token to the Holy Ghost men who are who were once unbelievers be made Bel Believers and impart spiritual eternal life now how much greater is it to say this sick woman lying in here that can say a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what's going on then but the greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise them up for a little while but to give them eternal life which will be Eternal forever oh poor blind wretched people how do we miss that don't you see what the greater thing is the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart to others can a man do that a Son of God Can can a man do that a Son of God can I'm going to ask you you answer me can a man do that can a man do that oh yes a Son of God can Hallelujah Jesus said whosoever sins you remit they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained oh blessed be the name of the Lord that he given to you the power by the Holy Ghost to do the Greater Works that you could by the word of God begin to impart eternal life unto them that would believe that's exactly what's happening here tonight all it takes is for you to stand up and to receive what God's sending to you oh Hallelujah all it takes is for you to catch the inspiration so I say to you let those feeble knees be strong lift up those weary hands which once hang down make straight Pathways that the feeble be not turned away and the lame not be turned aside but rather that they be healed and I'm saying to you church here in new land stand on your feet this morning and accept what God is giving you yeah oh Lord you don't need the Lord to help you you just need to stand up brother Bram would say all you have to do is raise your hand it defies gravity I'm giving you a direct order this morning stand up you want to receive eternal life you're here in the presence of God he's here and I preached the word for a purpose to impart eternal life unto you and I'm asking you to stay stand up and receive what God will give you Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I preach it the best I can I know I've had the people a long time I've been too long Lord and I know I've kept them Lord Jesus and they're weary oh God forgive me oh God that I couldn't get it out faster I couldn't get it out better but Lord you're here oh God to impart eternal life you're here to give us whatever we have need of you said you sought the Lord David would say and he answered me and he delivered me from all of my fears he delivered me and he said if you oh the poor man cried the Lord heard me taste and see the Lord is good he'll give you everything he'll give you the desires of your heart oh Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you this morning oh God it's now in the afternoon Lord I preached a long time Lord I think of Paul who preached all night oh God and there was a young man that fell asleep and fell from the window but there was a quickening power in Saul in Paul that he just went down there and laid his body across him and the man came back to life oh god oh Jesus you're here this morning you're the same yesterday today and forever don't let us miss it oh God but help us father to catch Lord Jesus as sometimes it takes a natural reaction in the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to catch what you're really trying to get to the church Lord God that you desire to impart eternal life Lord Jesus you had in the book of Acts chapter 8 where you had the disciples came when they believed the word of God up in Phoenicia you had them call for Peter and John and they came up there Lord and they laid their hands upon them and they received the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord it wasn't their hands that gave them the Holy Ghost but it was a natural action that caused a spiritual reaction and Lord Jesus we're asking this morning Lord that if there be anyone here here in faith that would desire the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would want more of you in their life that they'd stand on their feet and accept you as Jesus Christ and they believe and receive the word of God for this day Lord we commit it now into your hands we've preached the word Lord I pray you'd give the increase in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen the musician will come we stand on our feet this morning Father we sing that song Oh magnify the Lord with me do we know that you know it all right well we'll sing it as a special then hallelujah hallelujah I sought the Lord oh me and delivered me from every fear those who look on him are radi they'll never be ashamed they'll never be ashamed oh [Applause] magnify the Lord with me ex his name together glorify the Lord with me Oh Come exalt his name forever oh glorify the Lord with me come exalt his name together glorify the Lord with me come ex his name forever he is here he is here he is here [Music] hallelujah he is here we'll get a key amen hallelu he is [Music] here he is here holy holy oh I Will Bless here is [Music] now your name he is here you can touch him for you will never never be the same for he is hallelu he yes Lord hallelujah here holy holy oh I will bless His holy name he is here now close hear him [Music] calling out your name he is here you can touch him for you will never Hallelujah let's just bow our heads [Music] together Lord laid these thoughts on my heart about well shortly after brother Jonathan had invited me come and speak on a three-fold showdown you're in a place here in Newland where God is God has moved many times in the past I told last night there used to be five churches now there's one that has a pastor as a real body of Christ a church place to gather but God is God he's proven himself to be God question is who are you are you a part of it he desires you to be a part of this new creation he didn't just die for our sins denomination only goes so far oh Jesus died for our sins it's wonderful and we can go off in the message and we can go down into some Road of the seventh seal and all of these great mysteries of God that have been revealed but what's it all trying to get to you you it's trying to get you to a place to realize you're the vessel of honor and he wants to fill it he wants to live today but he doesn't have a Corporal body here of his own he has you you're not who you once were that he would by a New Birth has totally changed you changed your desires changed your reason for fighting changed your purpose of being made you so that you could live this word and not just live it in a legalistic way but live it by a life that comes out from the inside and God just begins to manifest it and you desire to be clean you desire to be holy I'd encourage you this afternoon if if you don't know what that's like figure it out real quick get on your knees before God stay there until he fills you I know we're hungry I know the service has been long but what's more important than the word of God what's more important Esau who for a morsel of bread sold out his Birthright and now you're sitting here in the presence of the almighty God and he's saying come unto me all ye that we are weary and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you even in the youth it's good for you to Bear the Yoke not your own yoke but the Yoke of Christ his burden is easy his yoke is light he wants you to be a partaker with him in Heavenly places would you accept that this afternoon let's bow our heads and pray together one more time and we'll invite your pastor to come Heavenly Father Lord we love you we love your appearing we love your word it's you here in our midst Lord father forgive me oh God if I have said anything of myself if I have misplaced any word Lord forgive me Father I don't mean that Lord I would certainly be horrified to mislead any one of your children but oh God I pray Lord that this weekend Lord we would have pointed Lord Jesus souls to Calvary we would have pointed them closer to you oh God to encourage them Lord to go on un Perfection Lord that by the preaching of the word Souls would be saved Lord that father ones would be Sanctified and ones would be filled with the Holy Ghost children would come into a place of maturity Lord father we need you more today than we ever have before we thank you for the service last night we thank you for Friday we thank you for today Lord I pray as the days go on oh Father may you make it more and more real to us Lord Jesus I've poured out My Heart Lord and I pray you'd give the increase we give it all to you now in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Lord I love you I love him I love him because he first loved me I love brother Jonathan oh [Music] love me and puras my Sal [Music] un tree amen he stole some of my thunder from Wednesday night service I've been studying on but a man enjoyed so much took so many notes here but I want to remind us of two things this morning he said sometimes we call things dead that aren't dead because according to our understand understanding Lazarus was dead but it's not our understanding that made him dead it's our capabilities that made him dead cuz we couldn't bring him back but when he came on the scene when he came in the house he said she's not dead she sleeps cuz in is eyes it's just as sleep in ours it's final in him it's just a it's just a a state right and so often we look at our lives we look at those around us we looked at loved ones we looked at those that are out from under the word perhaps and we say they're dead they're gone too far gone they stink their life stinks they're a mess sometimes we look at our own life and even in the presence of the preaching of the word we can say it stinks but it ain't over until he says it's over amen when he says you're dead you're dead but he says he talked about the the valley of dry bones and he said Can these bones B live again he says Thou knowest oh Lord to me it doesn't look like it maybe to you it doesn't look like it but it's not over till he says it's over you're not dead till he says you're dead and if he says you're alive then regardless of what he what it looks like there's life still there to be had and there's a life that's going to come forth from it but I love what he was talking about you know when he was speaking of those disciples and the man came and brought his son and he said I took him to the disciples and they couldn't cast him out' and I'd written this in my notes to the day before brother Andrew as you spoke it because I've been looking for that that a revelation on Jesus said this kind cometh not but by prayer and fasting and you realize that he did his prayer and fasting in the wilderness the spirit led him there and what did it do it confirmed his position as the Son of God and he faced Satan and he defeated Satan and when he defeated Satan he defeated every demon that was in that Kingdom at that point he he had defeated everything when he defeated Satan there so what happened is the disciples came and they had a power but they didn't know who they were but you'll notice they never get defeated after Pentecost cuz they've been settled as to who they are they know who they are in Christ see it's not just power you've got to recognize who you are and you've got to recognize the authority that comes with your position that's in Christ that's why he said this comes not out but by prayer and fasting you got to find your place you got to know who you are and when you know who you are you can do the Greater Works because what greater is he that's in you you recognize the one that's doing this work in the first place it's not just a power it's a person it's the Life of Christ in US amen amen I'm not going to hold you long that's all I wanted to say but I want to say thank you to brother Andrew that was absolutely tremendous this weekend amen praise the Lord I say praise the Lord but let's sing one or two songs and then we'll go I I think I WR wrote eight songs down and I'm not going to sing them I promise you one of them was Psalms 34 I sought the Lord amen magnify the Lord with me do we know that
