[1:15:08] hallelujah do god be the glory there's
[1:15:11] too many that are on my brother they're
[1:15:13] representing the church and they're
[1:15:14] representing this they're representing
[1:15:16] the uh even a doctrine even this
[1:15:18] theology that theo who's representing
[1:15:20] jesus
[1:15:21] amen who's reflecting jesus brother at
[1:15:24] all when it comes to a doctrine theology
[1:15:26] no matter what it is we know it's the
[1:15:28] whole truth nothing but the truth but if
[1:15:30] we're reflecting it we're reflecting
[1:15:31] jesus
[1:15:32] amen we're reflecting jesus we're
[1:15:34] reflecting the truth amen we're not just
[1:15:36] talking about jesus we're going to we're
[1:15:38] going to live for jesus amen and reflect
[1:15:41] the life of jesus reflect the nature of
[1:15:43] jesus reflect the thoughts of jesus
[1:15:45] by the grace of god amen so brother
[1:15:48] there's too many just put in the
[1:15:50] emphasis on all of this doctrine this
[1:15:51] doctrine that doctrine brother it's
[1:15:53] christ
[1:15:54] he's the word
[1:15:56] amen oh well we gotta we gotta re be
[1:15:59] witness for this doctrine lord if you're

[1:16:02] for the truth
[1:16:03] amen if you're witness or jesus you'll
[1:16:06] be witnessing for this doctrine that
[1:16:07] doctrine just leave it with the lord
[1:16:09] amen and let god bring it out in your
[1:16:11] everyday living amen let god bring it
[1:16:14] out when you when you when he brings you
[1:16:16] face to face with this one and you gotta
[1:16:18] you gotta be a witness well you're going
[1:16:19] to just speak the truth
[1:16:21] no not here religiously or to tell them
[1:16:23] about this doctrine tell them about that
[1:16:25] wrong just go go and live and live and
[1:16:27] tell them about jesus
[1:16:28] amen encourage them to believe jesus
[1:16:31] encourage them to stay with jesus
[1:16:32] encourage them to have an experience
[1:16:34] with jesus amen oh well and if they do
[1:16:38] those doctrines that'll come out
[1:16:40] oh yeah
[1:16:41] god will require them to believe this
[1:16:43] and believe that but there's too many
[1:16:44] behaviors whether they're just putting
[1:16:46] emphasis on this doctrine on this
[1:16:48] doctrine oh yeah we believe this
[1:16:49] doctrine oh yeah we believe that's why
[1:16:51] god sent the prophet for this for this
[1:16:53] for this brother god sent the prophet
[1:16:55] amen to get us
[1:16:57] into the word as a part of the bride
[1:16:59] oh praise the lord oh but the word is
[1:17:01] this but there's three more emphasis on
[1:17:03] the doctrine and the letter of the word
[1:17:05] than there is on the spirit
[1:17:07] amen for years we've had to fight it for
[1:17:10] years and again as i said
[1:17:12] the first
[1:17:14] sermon that i preached as as a young man
[1:17:16] of them around 19 years 8 or 18 or 19
[1:17:18] years old amen to correct believers
[1:17:21] concerning their attitude and their
[1:17:23] spirit and how they walked and how they
[1:17:25] talked and how they lived and amen as i
[1:17:27] said oh brother yes i saw it over and
[1:17:30] over again amen now that they would look
[1:17:32] down their noses at anybody that didn't

[1:17:39] at others in this church and that church
[1:17:40] and that church i said don't you do that
[1:17:42] there you go but for the grace of god
[1:17:45] amen you just pray the grace of god in
[1:17:48] their hearts and in their souls amen so

[1:27:47] spirit considering
[1:27:49] oh my you consider that i was born in
[1:27:51] sin shape that iniquity come to the
[1:27:53] world speaking life oh my and look what
[1:27:55] jesus did oh my jesus came
[1:27:58] to redeem me jesus came to give me this
[1:28:00] new new anointing
[1:28:02] oh lord thank you
[1:28:04] oh yeah it'll keep you humble
[1:28:06] by the by grace
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:11] so he said the earnest expectation of
[1:28:13] the creature waited for the
[1:28:15] manifestation
[1:28:16] of the sons of god
[1:28:21] is
[1:28:23] does god wait any longer in your life
[1:28:26] are we coming forth with the
[1:28:27] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[1:28:29] god
[1:28:31] amen not religious people
[1:28:33] oh not bible believers members
[1:28:36] oh not all are not just followers of
[1:28:38] william branham no
[1:28:41] brother it's like i said there are those
[1:28:42] that follow william branham therefore
[1:28:44] those that are following his son
[1:28:46] yeah but i'll tell you this he got us to
[1:28:48] follow jesus
[1:28:50] amen
[1:28:51] he points us to jesus
[1:28:53] by grace
[1:28:54] amen
[1:28:56] so the creature was made subject to
[1:28:58] vanity but not willingly
[1:29:01] but by reason of him who has subjected
[1:29:04] the same in hope
[1:29:06] because the creature self also shall be
[1:29:08] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:29:11] into the glorious liberty
[1:29:13] of the children of god hallelujah
[1:29:17] brother
[1:29:18] grace
[1:29:19] that we're going to be in his liberty
[1:29:21] his freedom
[1:29:22] under his anointing again not not the
[1:29:25] false anointing of the devil
[1:29:28] again be careful because again as i said
[1:29:30] the first evangelist was the devil
[1:29:34] god gave the word that the devil came
[1:29:37] and preached it to eve
[1:29:39] but he added to it
[1:29:41] he added one word but
[1:29:45] don't bother me don't don't have not one
[1:29:47] word
[1:29:48] stay with the word amen well if it's god
[1:29:51] brother is god going to reveal christ in
[1:29:54] you if it's god in the word and the
[1:29:56] message that god has given us brother is
[1:29:58] going to reflect jesus
[1:30:00] amen it's reflecting the resurrection
[1:30:02] and the rapture glorially asked in the
[1:30:04] name of jesus
[1:30:06] amen
[1:30:08] because the creature itself also shall
[1:30:10] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:30:11] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:30:15] the children of god for we know that the
[1:30:18] whole creation groaneth and travailed
[1:30:21] and pained together until now
[1:30:23] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:30:26] which have the first fruits of the
[1:30:28] spirit
[1:30:29] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:30:32] for the adoption
[1:30:34] the adoption to know
[1:30:37] the redemption of our body
[1:30:40] we got the experience in our souls but
[1:30:42] brother we're hungry and thirsting for
[1:30:43] the redemption experience in our bodies
[1:30:46] hallelujah oh hallelujah i've been
[1:30:50] redeemed
[1:30:51] yeah and i know i'm predestinated from
[1:30:53] my soul but brother we're predestined
[1:30:55] onto a glorified body
[1:30:57] by the grace of god
[1:30:59] amen let's keep pressing on amen
[1:31:03] placed as redeemed sons and daughters of
[1:31:05] god we are the sons and daughters of god
[1:31:08] and we were
[1:31:10] cut off by sin
[1:31:12] but we are re we are adopted back by
[1:31:16] redemption
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:19] praise the lord
[1:31:20] we think adoption is oh he's just
[1:31:22] adopting strangers no he's adopting he's
[1:31:24] adopting us back
[1:31:26] the problem of god said no
[1:31:28] he said we're not well oh yeah well he's
[1:31:31] going to bring us he's going to make his
[1:31:33] sons and daughters and bring us back no

[1:31:36] he said adoption he said it's to bring
[1:31:38] us back

[1:31:43] adoption is going to bring us back

[1:31:50] we are adopted back
[1:31:52] as the sons and daughters of god by the
[1:31:54] redemption of the son of god amen
[1:31:59] and we are rejoicing in spiritual
[1:32:01] adoption honoring thirsting for physical
[1:32:04] adoption

[1:32:12] going to do this god well god did it
[1:32:15] and brother why is god working on us now
[1:32:17] because we are sons and daughters

[1:32:41] i'll tell you the devil's children are
[1:32:43] not going to be saved
[1:32:45] but god's children
[1:32:47] and i tell you god knows where they are
[1:32:49] amen and all down through the ages god
[1:32:51] has given his word to bring out his seed
[1:32:55] amen he said the seed of god all the way
[1:32:58] down through have responded to the word
[1:33:01] amen by the grace of god
[1:33:03] amen
[1:33:05] turn with me to galatians chapter 4.
[1:33:13] praise the lord
[1:33:15] hallelujah
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:20] in galatians chapter 4 and verse 1.
[1:33:29] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[1:33:32] a child
[1:33:33] different nothing from a servant
[1:33:36] though he be lord of all
[1:33:39] oh yeah
[1:33:42] oh we we were we were like the rest of
[1:33:43] the sinners out there we were all born
[1:33:45] in sin that's right but brother not all
[1:33:47] not all out there are the sons and
[1:33:50] daughters of god they're not the seed of
[1:33:51] god
[1:33:52] oh no
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:55] so he said
[1:33:57] i say that the heir as long as he is a
[1:33:59] child different nothing from a servant
[1:34:03] though he be lord of all
[1:34:05] but
[1:34:06] he said
[1:34:08] is under tutors and governors until the
[1:34:11] time appointed of the father
[1:34:14] hallelujah to bring us back to the
[1:34:16] revelation of our
[1:34:18] sonship
[1:34:21] even so we when we were children we were
[1:34:23] in bondage under the elements of the
[1:34:26] world
[1:34:27] right
[1:34:29] but again
[1:34:30] not because we were the sons and
[1:34:32] daughters of the devil no no we're the
[1:34:33] seed of god
[1:34:34] born in sin
[1:34:37] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:34:39] and god sent forth this son made of a
[1:34:41] woman
[1:34:42] made under the law
[1:34:44] to redeem them that were on under the
[1:34:47] law that we might receive hallelujah the
[1:34:50] adoption of sons it's an experience
[1:34:54] amen that brings us back

[1:34:59] whereby we can cry
[1:35:02] father

[1:35:55] the lord oh yeah the bible says now we
[1:35:57] can cry father father father
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:02] wherefore he said thou art no more a
[1:36:04] servant
[1:36:06] he said but a son
[1:36:08] and if a son then an heir of god through
[1:36:11] christ
[1:36:12] prays the name of the lord hallelujah

[1:38:18] he said oh i tell you he says some
[1:38:20] people are afraid
[1:38:22] to receive the holy ghost
[1:38:25] they're afraid that they might speak
[1:38:27] with tongues
[1:38:28] they're afraid that somebody might say
[1:38:30] now he's one of them
[1:38:31] tongues guys
[1:38:34] and he said they're afraid to come to
[1:38:35] the church and be baptized in the name
[1:38:38] of the lord jesus christ because they're
[1:38:40] ashamed of it
[1:38:42] and somebody said he said i'll have he
[1:38:44] should recall this and recall that
[1:38:48] and he said listen if they don't like

[1:39:07] they oh yeah now they're just like a
[1:39:09] denomination that's right amen because
[1:39:13] it wasn't by the holy ghost in their
[1:39:14] hearts it was by the text of the word in
[1:39:17] their heads
[1:39:18] amen and there's too many believers that
[1:39:20] just got the text but they don't have
[1:39:22] the spiritual revelation
[1:39:24] in their souls amen
[1:39:27] brother it can be the preacher
[1:39:29] controlling you through your head but
[1:39:31] it's god controlling you through your
[1:39:32] heart
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:36] and he said they don't like what we did
[1:39:37] yesterday watch what we're going to do
[1:39:39] tomorrow and it should just keep going
[1:39:41] on there's no end to it because it is
[1:39:44] the lord it is god
[1:39:47] and he said you see as i said in my
[1:39:49] sermon this morning we are so much
[1:39:50] afraid that we want a saul to teach us
[1:39:55] but not paul
[1:39:56] and he said we want saul from some
[1:39:59] seminary to tell us how we must
[1:40:01] do our religion
[1:40:03] he said that is on the other side of
[1:40:06] jordan amen this side the holy spirit
[1:40:09] leads but the other side is man
[1:40:14] and he said listen god revealed more of
[1:40:16] it to me as he revealed it he said just
[1:40:19] keeps bringing it out and he said he
[1:40:21] never takes away from what has been he
[1:40:23] just keeps adding more on to
[1:40:26] it on what to the word the revelation he
[1:40:28] gives you the revelation the word it
[1:40:30] separates you and then he gives you more
[1:40:32] revelation to keep us moving on and

[1:41:01] reading yes a different book that i was
[1:41:03] in
[1:41:11] and looking for the paragraphs that i
[1:41:12] have listed here
[1:41:21] praise the lord
[1:41:41] he said listen
[1:41:44] he said you are the firstborn into the
[1:41:46] kingdom of the holy by the holy ghost
[1:41:49] and how many know that he said all right
[1:41:51] he said next you are predestinated unto
[1:41:54] what
[1:41:55] he said you're predestinated unto
[1:41:57] adoption
[1:41:59] and he said what is it you're
[1:42:01] predestinated onto the placing
[1:42:03] a man by the grace of god you're born by
[1:42:06] the holy ghost into the kingdom of god
[1:42:09] and then you're placed
[1:42:10] by adoption
[1:42:12] amen into the position where god wants
[1:42:15] you and to do so that god can is going
[1:42:17] to do this three through you and with
[1:42:19] you and in you amen
[1:42:22] oh brother
[1:42:23] but one thing to come into the message

[1:54:20] last days there's going to be two
[1:54:22] classes of people and one of them is
[1:54:24] going to have the seal of god and the
[1:54:26] other one the mark of the beast
[1:54:28] if the seal of god is the holy ghost
[1:54:31] then without the holy ghost
[1:54:33] is the mark of the
[1:54:34] beast so i trust
[1:54:37] we got the seal of god
[1:54:39] not the mark of the beast
[1:54:42] unbelief
[1:54:44] the the mark of the beast is unbelief
[1:54:45] and doubt
[1:54:47] but if you got the seal of god you
[1:54:49] believe the word of god
[1:54:51] you believe what god has done you
[1:54:52] believe what god is doing
[1:54:56] amen
[1:54:57] the bible said watch
[1:54:59] because in the last days these two
[1:55:01] classes of people again one of them is
[1:55:03] that the seal of god the other the mark
[1:55:05] of the beast and if the seal of god is
[1:55:07] the holy ghost and without the holy
[1:55:09] ghost is the mark of the beast and the
[1:55:11] bible said the two spirits would be so
[1:55:13] close together it would deceive the very
[1:55:15] elective possible god help us
[1:55:18] or you think oh it's going to be out
[1:55:19] there no no it's going to be around the
[1:55:21] message
[1:55:22] be on your guard
[1:55:26] this is bible
[1:55:28] this is thus saith the lord
[1:55:30] it is written
[1:55:32] concerning that which is to come he did
[1:55:34] he did warn us and he said
[1:55:37] that it would deceive the very elect if
[1:55:40] possible
[1:55:42] amen this is amazing
[1:55:47] but brother ought to put us on our guard
[1:55:50] put us on our toes
[1:55:52] let's make sure
[1:55:53] that it's the word
[1:55:56] amen don't just follow signs and wonders
[1:55:59] follow the word
[1:56:01] by the grace of god
[1:56:04] and the bible says as he said upon the
[1:56:06] mount of olives the disciples came unto
[1:56:08] him privately saying tell us when shall
[1:56:11] these things be and what shall be the
[1:56:13] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[1:56:16] world
[1:56:20] and jesus answered and said take heed
[1:56:22] that no man deceive you
[1:56:26] amen
[1:56:28] for many shall come in my name saying i
[1:56:31] am christ and shall deceive many
[1:56:35] i trust by the grace of god we're under
[1:56:38] the right anointing
[1:56:40] we're under the right revelation of
[1:56:42] christ
[1:56:43] amen not a false anointing but the true
[1:56:45] anointing
[1:56:47] christ in his word christ revealing his
[1:56:50] word amen
[1:56:52] to get us to look up
[1:56:54] if there's anything that christ wants to
[1:56:56] do at this hour is the resurrection and
[1:56:58] the rapture
[1:57:01] the bible said watch
[1:57:03] and he said this he said concerning the
[1:57:05] seal of god
[1:57:06] and the mark of the beast

[1:57:28] went into the marriage supper
[1:57:30] and the others were left outside where
[1:57:33] they were weeping and wailing and
[1:57:35] gnashing of teeth
