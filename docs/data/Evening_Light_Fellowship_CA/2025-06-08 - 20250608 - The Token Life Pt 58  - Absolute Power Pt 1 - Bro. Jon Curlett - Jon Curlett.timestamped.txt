[46:44] the mirror. You've owned the lies that

[46:55] It's time to own your
[47:02] belovedness. He says you're mine. I

[47:15] is fierce and
[47:17] unending. I'll come to find you.
[47:20] Whatever it takes.
[47:24] My
[47:27] beloved, you've owned the mess you see
[47:31] in the mirror. You've owned the lies
[47:35] that you're just not
[47:37] enough. You've been so blinded by all
[47:41] your
[47:42] comparing. It's time to own your
[47:46] beloved.
[47:51] He says you're mine. I smiled when I

[48:00] way. My love for you is fierce and
[48:05] unending. I'll come to find you.

[48:28] [Music]
[48:30] known. Beloved, believe he died to make
[48:37] your heart his
[48:41] [Music]

[48:47] I made you. I find you beautiful in
[48:51] every way. My love for you is fierce and
[48:57] unending. I'll come to find you.

[49:15] is fierce and
[49:17] unending. I'll come to find you.
[49:21] Whatever it
[49:23] takes, my
[49:28] beloved. It's time to own your beloved.
[49:48] Amen. Thanks for the specials. They were
[49:51] really good. Really enjoyed
[49:53] them. Amen. We're going to
[49:56] stand. Good. And
[50:00] um we're going to sing number 560.
[50:06] That is surely the presence of the Lord
[50:08] is in this place as brother John comes.
[50:11] So be in prayer for
[50:12] him and
[50:17] uh let's make sure that uh we feel the
[50:20] presence of the Lord today. Believe he's
[50:23] here. Amen. Let's just sing this as he
[50:29] comes.
[50:32] Surely the
[50:34] presence of the
[50:37] Lord is in this
[50:40] place. I can
[50:43] feel his mighty
[50:46] power and his
[50:52] grace. I can
[50:54] hear the best of angels wings. I see
[51:01] glory on each
[51:04] face.
[51:06] Surely amen. The
[51:09] presence of the
[51:12] Lord is in this
[51:15] place. Oh,
[51:23] surely is in this
[51:27] place. I can
[51:29] feel his mighty
[51:32] power and his
[51:38] grace. And I can hear the rush of angels
[51:44] wings. I sing
[51:47] gloryy on each
[51:50] face. For
[51:53] surely the
[51:55] presence of the
[51:57] Lord is in this
[52:01] place. Heavenly
[52:05] Father, Lord, what we can feel, what we
[52:08] can't feel, Lord, what we can sense,
[52:11] what we can't sense. Lord, what matters
[52:14] is that you said by your word, where two
[52:16] or three are gathered in my name, there
[52:17] will I be in the midst. And so, Lord,
[52:19] we're here by faith this morning,
[52:21] trusting that as we've come in your
[52:23] name, Lord, not in the name of a church
[52:25] or a pastor or a ministry, Lord, but
[52:28] we've gathered in your name. We are
[52:30] Christians. We are gathered in the name
[52:32] of Jesus Christ this morning, Lord,
[52:34] under the headship of your word by your
[52:36] spirit, Lord. And we know that you're
[52:38] here with us. And so, Lord, we ask once
[52:40] again that you would speak, Lord, that
[52:42] you would take your word, that it you
[52:44] would open it up to us, heavenly father,
[52:45] that it would go into our lives. it
[52:47] would discern our thoughts and our
[52:49] intentions, Lord. That it would see our
[52:51] our broken places, that it would see our
[52:53] our wounded places, Lord. That it would
[52:55] see our hidden places, Lord. That it
[52:57] would open them up, Lord, so your word
[52:59] can flow in and do a wonderful work in
[53:01] our lives, Lord. We pray, Lord. We thank
[53:03] you for your goodness, Lord. Thank you
[53:05] for your people, Lord. Thank you for
[53:07] your fellowship. Lord, thank you for
[53:09] your promises this morning. Lord, we're
[53:11] here to lay hold of them once again.
[53:13] Lord, speak now. Bless your people, we
[53:15] pray. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it.
[53:18] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you
[53:20] would to Luke 24. Amen. Luke
[53:23] 24. Amen. We've got a lot of greetings
[53:26] to give this morning. Amen. And we've
[53:29] got brother Filimon Montteros and his
[53:31] wife and three children visiting us this
[53:33] morning. Amen. They've moved here all
[53:35] the way from Qatar. And so we're so
[53:38] happy to see you here this morning. God
[53:39] bless you each one. I'll be sure to
[53:41] shake your hand, talk to you after
[53:42] service, Lord willing. Then we also have
[53:45] uh we call him Big John. Big John Neils
[53:47] from BC. He's a friend of Jonathan's.
[53:49] He's just staying with us until uh
[53:51] tonight, early tomorrow morning. Uh I'm
[53:53] not sure why they call him
[53:56] Big. He's only head and shoulders above
[53:58] us all, but it's been wonderful to have
[54:00] him with us. We welcome him. And then
[54:02] we've got my brother Nate and actually
[54:04] his wife Melissa this time instead of
[54:06] his daughter. Sorry about that last
[54:07] service. I saw from the back and he had
[54:09] his arm around her and I just assumed it
[54:11] was Melissa. And then when I came here,
[54:12] all I could see was half ahead. So
[54:14] again, that was my assumption, but it is
[54:16] Melissa here today with him and their
[54:18] their four children. So happy to have
[54:20] them here. And then pray God would bless
[54:22] them. And then Brother Gerald had his
[54:24] 77th birthday on Friday if I'm not
[54:26] mistaken. So we want to say happy
[54:28] birthday. God bless you. Amen. 77.
[54:31] Double double perfection, double
[54:33] completion. Amen, brother Gerald. So we
[54:35] we pray God bless you. Uh remember
[54:37] brother Grant, he will take the service
[54:39] on Wednesday. I asked him if he'd be
[54:41] available to take that to give me a
[54:42] break as Nate, Melissa, and the family
[54:44] are staying with us. It allowed me to
[54:45] not have to study every night. And so,
[54:47] he's graciously agreed to do that. So,
[54:49] remember him. And then on a bit of a sad
[54:52] note, my grandmother Dorothy passed away
[54:54] this morning. So, my mom's mother. So,
[54:56] that's the last grandparent on my side.
[54:59] Um, I think she was 94. Um, but she
[55:02] passed away this morning. They kind of
[55:03] had an idea. They put her into
[55:05] paliotative care. Um, they they didn't
[55:07] they just said, "Don't don't do any
[55:08] tests. just she's ready to go. We're
[55:11] ready to let her go. So, she passed away
[55:13] just uh 6 or eight hours after that. So,
[55:15] we want to remember mom and Judy. Mom
[55:17] was there for it. Uh not there for it,
[55:19] but they notified her. Of course, she's
[55:21] been staying with Judy, so she's there
[55:22] to help out. So, it kind of worked out
[55:23] beautifully. They had a birthday party
[55:25] for her, uh latest granddaughter, um
[55:30] great granddaughter, I guess. No,
[55:32] granddaughter, uh Dakota. And so, she
[55:34] was there with that. and and so she had
[55:36] a time kind of last time with the
[55:37] family, a bunch of her her her kids and
[55:40] and and grandchildren there as well. So
[55:42] we thank the Lord for that. Amen. She'd
[55:45] really been struggling in life. She was
[55:46] pretty much blind, deaf, you know, not
[55:48] much of a quality of life and that was
[55:50] frustrating for her for sure. So we want
[55:52] to but we want to remember the family as
[55:54] they just go through this time as well.
[55:56] Amen. God bless you. Luke 24 and verse
[55:59] 49, Jesus speaking. He's just about to
[56:02] ascend into heaven. And it says, "And
[56:04] behold, I send the promise of my father
[56:06] upon you, but ter ye in the city of
[56:08] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[56:11] from on high." Amen. God bless you. You
[56:13] can have your seats this morning. And
[56:15] we're we're starting a new thought.
[56:16] We've been preaching this series on the
[56:18] token life, the life of a believer that
[56:20] is filled with the Holy Spirit. And
[56:22] we're getting to the end of it. I think
[56:24] you know I was telling somebody I said I
[56:26] think you could preach on the Holy Ghost
[56:27] the rest of your life because that is
[56:28] the the life of the believer and
[56:30] everything revolves around the the the
[56:32] spirit of God the life of God within us.
[56:35] Amen. But I believe we're coming to the
[56:36] end of this series here shortly. But I
[56:38] want to take the the last portion
[56:40] certainly on this thought of absolute
[56:42] power. And I will say this even before
[56:44] we go into this sometimes we where we
[56:46] are what we think is the deepest valley
[56:49] is often the apex of where we need to
[56:51] get. Sometimes you don't realize that
[56:53] you need to get low in order for God to
[56:55] raise you up. And we'll see that as we
[56:57] go through this service. Amen. Is that
[56:59] absolute power is not what we think
[57:00] about when we think about the power that
[57:02] they received on the day of Pentecost.
[57:04] What that power was. I will say this,
[57:06] the world doesn't preach it right. The
[57:07] churches don't tend to preach it right.
[57:09] Amen. It takes a revelation of the word
[57:11] and a real understanding of what God has
[57:13] even done in this age to show us what
[57:15] real power looks like. Amen. We preached
[57:17] about perfect love. Remember when Paul,
[57:19] he would talk about and Peter even would
[57:21] talk about these things and they'd say,
[57:23] you know, where where tongues are,
[57:24] they'll cease. And where prophecies are,
[57:26] they'll cease. And all these different
[57:27] things will cease, but love won't cease.
[57:29] All those things will fail, but there's
[57:31] one thing that won't fail. Amen. And
[57:32] it's it's the love of God, which is his
[57:35] Holy Spirit inside of us. And so, I want
[57:37] to go back to our opening scripture this
[57:39] morning. And Jesus makes a very critical
[57:42] statement here. He says, "Behold, I send
[57:44] the promise of my father upon you." Now,
[57:46] he's told them to go and preach. He's
[57:47] told them to go and spread the gospel.
[57:50] He's told them to go out and heal the
[57:51] sick and cast out demons. All these
[57:52] different things. But he says, "Before
[57:54] you do that," he says, "but tarry ye in
[57:56] the city of Jerusalem until you be
[57:59] endued with power from on high." They
[58:02] had this commission to go. They'd
[58:03] experienced great things in their
[58:05] ministry so far. But they had only been
[58:08] able to go to a certain point and then
[58:10] they fell apart and then they failed, if
[58:12] we could put it that way. And Jesus
[58:14] said, "You got to go and give more power
[58:15] than you've ever had before in order for
[58:18] you to do what I've told you the way I
[58:20] want you to do it." Amen. It isn't this
[58:23] this loose cannon approach. It's not a
[58:25] shotgun approach where you just go out
[58:26] and you just apply the power of God
[58:28] anywhere you want. There's a way to do
[58:30] it and you're going to need power in
[58:32] order to do it the way that I've
[58:33] ordained for you to do it by the word of
[58:35] God. Amen. They needed a certain type of
[58:38] power. We look in the book of acts the
[58:40] first chapter gives us a little more
[58:42] clarity on what Jesus said. It says to
[58:44] whom also he showed himself alive after
[58:46] his passion by many infallible proofs
[58:48] being seen of them 40 days and speaking
[58:51] of the things pertaining to the kingdom
[58:52] of God. Christ arose and he spends his
[58:54] 40 days with the disciples and he's just
[58:56] filling them full of understanding of
[58:58] what's going to happen. All that has
[59:00] happened all that's going to happen. He
[59:02] said, "And being assembled together with
[59:04] them, commanded them that they should
[59:06] not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for
[59:08] the promise of the Father." He says,
[59:11] "Which saith he ye have heard of me? For
[59:13] John truly baptized with water, but ye
[59:16] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost,
[59:18] not many days hence." He says, "And when
[59:21] they were therefore come together, they
[59:22] asked of him, saying, Lord, what wilt
[59:25] thou at this time restore again the
[59:26] kingdom to Israel?" And he said unto
[59:28] them, "It's not for you to know the
[59:30] times or the seasons which the father
[59:32] have put in his own power." He says,
[59:34] "But you shall receive power." Now said,
[59:38] "We want to know everything that's going
[59:39] to happen, when it's going to happen,
[59:41] how it's going to happen." He says,
[59:44] "No." See, it's still a walk of faith,
[59:47] church. No matter what we get, no matter
[59:49] how much we understand, there's still an
[59:51] element of mystery. And that's where
[59:53] faith comes in.
[59:55] I liked how sister Selena is saying this
[59:57] morning that what he takes and what he
[59:58] gives away, Christ is enough for me.
[1:00:01] We've got to understand that what he's
[1:00:03] given us is sufficient for the day.
[1:00:05] Tomorrow he'll give us what we need for
[1:00:07] tomorrow, but today he gives us exactly
[1:00:09] what we need for today. He says, "No,
[1:00:11] I'm not going to tell you what's going
[1:00:12] to go in every time and every season.
[1:00:14] It's not for you to know." He says, "But
[1:00:16] what I will do is I will give you power.
[1:00:18] You shall receive power after that the
[1:00:20] Holy Ghost has come upon you." Amen. So
[1:00:23] the power is the Holy Ghost, but that is
[1:00:25] a power to do and have something. He
[1:00:28] says, "And you shall be witnesses unto
[1:00:30] me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[1:00:32] and in Samaria and unto the uttermost
[1:00:34] parts of the earth." Amen. So we see
[1:00:36] here that the power that was needed now
[1:00:38] was the
[1:00:39] indwelling, the indwelling of the Holy
[1:00:42] Spirit in their life. Amen. And that is
[1:00:44] the only power that would work. There is
[1:00:48] no other power that will work. church.
[1:00:50] What mama has, what daddy has, what mama
[1:00:52] says, what daddy says, what the preacher
[1:00:53] says. It's not enough for them to say
[1:00:55] it, but you've got to get something that
[1:00:57] belongs to you. And it's a power that
[1:00:59] drops down into your life that will do
[1:01:01] the work that God's wanting us to do.
[1:01:03] Amen. These men, they have had a
[1:01:05] commission. They've had wonderful
[1:01:07] experiences. They've had signs and
[1:01:09] wonders. They've had healings. They've
[1:01:10] cast out demons. Peter's walked on
[1:01:13] water. And he says, "That ain't
[1:01:16] enough. That's not enough." So church,
[1:01:19] don't go looking for that to anchor your
[1:01:21] soul this morning. You need a power in
[1:01:23] your life that's different, that's
[1:01:25] beyond all of those things. Amen. And so
[1:01:27] when we look at the disciples, we see
[1:01:29] that for all the power that they had, it
[1:01:32] was imperfect. It was incomplete. Amen.
[1:01:35] They had a lot of power, but that power
[1:01:37] was incomplete because they could only
[1:01:39] go so far with it. And I've spoken on
[1:01:42] this in in portions at times before, but
[1:01:44] I want to kind of bring it into one
[1:01:46] single service, one thought this morning
[1:01:48] so that we can go through this because
[1:01:50] we can know a lot. We can think we can
[1:01:53] have a lot. But church, if it doesn't do
[1:01:55] anything in us and through us, then what
[1:01:57] do we really have?
[1:01:59] It's just up here. It's just up here,
[1:02:02] church. I don't care how much you have
[1:02:04] here. I want to see what comes out of
[1:02:05] here. God, help us to have something
[1:02:07] that flows out of our life rather than
[1:02:09] comes and just stands up here. So we can
[1:02:11] tell people how wrong they are. Cuz
[1:02:13] that's usually what happens when it's
[1:02:14] head knowledge is I go around telling
[1:02:15] you what's wrong with you. We need a
[1:02:18] power that comes and starts dealing with
[1:02:19] me, not just me dealing with you. That's
[1:02:21] the power that we're talking about.
[1:02:23] Amen. We need the power that the
[1:02:25] disciples had, but we need what they had
[1:02:26] after the day of Pentecost, not
[1:02:28] before. Otherwise, we see that chaos and
[1:02:32] desire takes over and it breaks down the
[1:02:36] church and it breaks down the people. So
[1:02:38] we go to Luke 9 and we're going to spend
[1:02:39] our service mostly here this morning. It
[1:02:42] says, "When he when Jesus called his
[1:02:44] disciples together, he gave them power
[1:02:46] and authority over all devils and to
[1:02:48] cure diseases. And he sent them to
[1:02:50] preach the kingdom of God and to heal
[1:02:52] the sick. And they departed and went
[1:02:54] through the towns preaching the gospel
[1:02:56] and healing everywhere." We hear see
[1:02:58] here now they're given power and they're
[1:03:00] given authority. But their power and
[1:03:02] authority is limited to two things.
[1:03:04] They're given power over uh uh over all
[1:03:07] devils and to cure diseases. So it is a
[1:03:11] power that is externally
[1:03:14] facing. It is not a power to change
[1:03:16] them. It's a power to change others.
[1:03:19] It's a power to work in life situations.
[1:03:22] It's a power to make life easy, but it
[1:03:24] is not a changing power. It is a helping
[1:03:26] power if we could put it that way. Amen.
[1:03:29] So if we had that today, I'm not saying
[1:03:31] we don't, but people today would think,
[1:03:33] well, if I can cast out every demon and
[1:03:35] heal every disease, then I am surely a
[1:03:38] child of God. I have reached the the the
[1:03:41] pinnacle of Christian power.
[1:03:44] If we could do it, they have this in
[1:03:46] Luke 9. And Jesus comes to them in Luke
[1:03:48] 24 and says, "You've got to wait to
[1:03:50] receive power."
[1:03:53] So this is not the power they received
[1:03:54] at Pentecost.
[1:03:56] They already had this power by faith in
[1:03:59] Jesus' name. They had it. And we'll see
[1:04:02] that it was not only limited to them,
[1:04:04] church. We'll see others took that same
[1:04:06] faith and did the similar works to it.
[1:04:08] Amen. But we see that we look in this
[1:04:11] chapter in Luke 9. But if this is for
[1:04:13] the 12, remember, but we jump forward to
[1:04:15] Luke chapter 10 and now it's he Jesus
[1:04:18] goes and he commisss the 70 other
[1:04:20] disciples. Now remember, he chose the
[1:04:22] 12, but the 70 chose him. He did not
[1:04:27] choose them, they chose him. That's a
[1:04:30] huge distinction. Okay, it says and so
[1:04:33] he commissioned them and he c he told
[1:04:34] them, "Go out two by two, preach the
[1:04:36] gospel, heal the sick." And he gave them
[1:04:37] the power. And it says, "And the 70
[1:04:39] returned again with joy, saying, Lord,
[1:04:41] even the devils are subject unto us
[1:04:43] through thy name." And he said unto
[1:04:45] them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall
[1:04:48] from heaven.
[1:04:50] He says, "Behold, I give unto you power
[1:04:52] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:04:54] over all the power of the enemy, and
[1:04:56] nothing shall by any means hurt you." He
[1:04:58] says, "You're going to be in a battle."
[1:04:59] You are in a battle, "But nothing shall
[1:05:01] touch you because I've given you
[1:05:02] power." But he says,
[1:05:05] "Notwithstanding in this, rejoice not."
[1:05:09] He says, "Don't let your joy rest in
[1:05:11] what you're doing or what's happening
[1:05:13] through you this way." He says, "But
[1:05:15] rather rejoice because your names are
[1:05:18] written in heaven." See, Jesus, he he's
[1:05:21] got to we've got to have this
[1:05:22] discernment, church, that we look beyond
[1:05:24] the now, and we've got to see what's
[1:05:26] coming down the road by the word. We've
[1:05:29] got to judge everything by the word. And
[1:05:31] he says, listen, you got this power.
[1:05:33] It's great. It is of God. I have given
[1:05:36] it to you. But he says, don't let your
[1:05:38] joy rest in that. Let your joy rest in
[1:05:40] the fact that before you did this,
[1:05:43] before you received this, your names
[1:05:45] were written in the Lamb's book of life
[1:05:47] before the foundation of the world.
[1:05:50] Because that is what matters beyond all
[1:05:52] of this. This is temporary. The people
[1:05:55] you healed, they're still going to get
[1:05:57] sick. The people you raised from the
[1:05:58] dead, they're going to die again. The
[1:06:00] demons you cast out, if those people
[1:06:02] don't guard, they're going to come back
[1:06:03] in. But there's something that will hold
[1:06:05] you eternally and it's that your names
[1:06:08] were written in the lamb's book of life
[1:06:09] before the foundation of the world.
[1:06:11] Rejoice there because nothing changes
[1:06:13] with that. You can't lose that. That's
[1:06:16] what ought to hold you. Amen. Why did he
[1:06:18] say that church? Because some of these
[1:06:20] very men a few chapters later as Jesus
[1:06:23] starts to reveal the word as he sp
[1:06:26] starts to show the gospel that's coming
[1:06:28] as he starts to open up the new covenant
[1:06:30] they would say our church doesn't teach
[1:06:32] this. We can't understand it. That's too
[1:06:35] weird. And they would walk
[1:06:37] away. They had all of this power and
[1:06:40] they would walk away from the very word
[1:06:42] made flesh. Why? Because their names
[1:06:45] were not written in heaven. They could
[1:06:48] only go so far and then they walked
[1:06:52] away. Their power was
[1:06:56] incomplete. Great signs and wonders are
[1:06:58] wonderful. We love it. We are so
[1:07:00] thankful for the testimonies we have
[1:07:02] here of people that have been saved,
[1:07:03] people that have been healed, people
[1:07:05] that have been delivered, people that
[1:07:06] have been provided for. We've seen it
[1:07:08] all through this church. God is alive
[1:07:10] and well. We've seen the power of the
[1:07:12] Holy Ghost to do those things in our
[1:07:14] lives. But that will never anchor us.
[1:07:17] That is just the blessings, the benefits
[1:07:19] of being in the presence of God. And we
[1:07:22] talked last service about how Israel was
[1:07:24] in that presence, the pillar of fire,
[1:07:25] the pillar of cloud, mana every day,
[1:07:27] clothes that didn't wear out. Everything
[1:07:29] they had needed was provided and it
[1:07:31] still never held them. And only Joshua
[1:07:32] and Caleb of that original group went
[1:07:33] in. It's not going to hold you. You need
[1:07:36] a power greater than the signs and the
[1:07:37] wonders. Jesus did all those signs and
[1:07:40] wonders. You go into the scripture and
[1:07:41] you see where Jesus went somewhere and
[1:07:43] it says he healed them.
[1:07:46] Everyone. And yet on the day of
[1:07:48] Pentecost, how many people are still
[1:07:49] with him?
[1:07:50] 120. Thousands upon thousands fed from
[1:07:54] bread that was multiplied
[1:07:56] supernaturally. Didn't hold them. Didn't
[1:07:58] hold them. There's a power that's beyond
[1:08:00] this. Amen. What was the power on these
[1:08:03] 70? What was the power on the 12? It was
[1:08:06] the Holy Spirit. Of course, it was. It
[1:08:09] had to be. It's the power of God. But we
[1:08:10] notice that it is a power that is on
[1:08:13] them, not a power that is in them. It is
[1:08:16] anointing that is on them. It is
[1:08:18] temporary. It is limited. It can be here
[1:08:22] one day and gone the
[1:08:23] next. It has nothing to do with their
[1:08:26] eternal
[1:08:27] soul. But it's just something that's on
[1:08:30] the vessel. Amen. But it was limited. It
[1:08:34] was limited by their faith. It was
[1:08:36] limited by their revelation. It was
[1:08:38] limited by their
[1:08:39] understanding. It was limited by
[1:08:42] circumstances. Why? Because there was a
[1:08:44] work that had to be done on the inside
[1:08:46] before that power could be made perfect.
[1:08:48] before they could come to a position of
[1:08:50] absolute power. We see even in the so
[1:08:52] Jesus has said in Luke 9, Luke 10,
[1:08:54] listen, you can cast out all devils. And
[1:08:56] then we see a man comes in Luke 9 after
[1:08:58] Jesus has said, I've given you power
[1:09:00] over all devils and all diseases. And a
[1:09:02] man comes and he says to Jesus, he says,
[1:09:04] I brought my son to your disciples and
[1:09:06] they couldn't heal him. And Jesus said,
[1:09:09] "Bring him here to me." Asked a few
[1:09:11] questions. Cast the demon out
[1:09:14] immediately. The disciples were
[1:09:16] confused. They said, "Why couldn't we
[1:09:18] cast them out?" Matthew
[1:09:19] 17. And Jesus said unto them, "Because
[1:09:22] of your
[1:09:23] unbelief, church, was there a limit on
[1:09:26] the
[1:09:26] power?" No limit on the power. Limit in
[1:09:30] the vessel.
[1:09:32] He says, "Because you couldn't believe.
[1:09:34] You said the words, but you didn't
[1:09:36] really believe that what you said was
[1:09:38] going to happen, and therefore it didn't
[1:09:40] come out." Why? Satan knows doubt when
[1:09:42] he sees it.
[1:09:44] He says, "For verily I say unto you, if
[1:09:46] you have faith as a grain of mustard
[1:09:48] seed, you shall say unto this mountain,
[1:09:50] remove hence to yonder place, and it
[1:09:52] shall remove, and nothing shall be
[1:09:55] impossible unto you." He says, "You've
[1:09:57] got power, but you don't have faith to
[1:09:59] operate the own power that you have
[1:10:00] within you." So, that tells me, church,
[1:10:03] the the limit's not God. The limit's me.
[1:10:06] The limit's my revelation. The limit is
[1:10:08] my faith. It's not God that's limiting
[1:10:09] us this morning. It's this flesh. It's
[1:10:12] this person that gets in the way. He
[1:10:14] says, "How be it? This kind goeth not
[1:10:16] out by prayer and fasting." Amen. Jesus
[1:10:19] says, and you think, well, well, this
[1:10:20] they just didn't have time to pray pray
[1:10:22] and fast. Jesus did not go pray and fast
[1:10:25] and then come back and cast this demon
[1:10:27] out, church. Jesus had already prayed
[1:10:30] and fasted. So when the moment arose, he
[1:10:33] knew what to do and he did it and the
[1:10:35] demon
[1:10:37] left. What was Jesus talking about? When
[1:10:41] we look at when Jesus prayed and fasted
[1:10:42] the first time, what did he do? The
[1:10:45] spirit took him into the desert. It
[1:10:47] drove him into the desert. It says in
[1:10:48] one of the gospels, and for 40 days and
[1:10:50] 40 nights, Jesus
[1:10:52] fasted. And then after that, he was
[1:10:54] tempted and he was tried of Satan
[1:10:56] directly. And after that temptation,
[1:10:59] what did Jesus know beyond a shadow of a
[1:11:02] doubt? Who he was? And that every power
[1:11:06] of Satan had nothing on him. He had
[1:11:10] defeated
[1:11:11] Satan. What does it matter about a
[1:11:13] demon? A demon's lower than Satan.
[1:11:16] Satan's the prince of the demons. He's
[1:11:17] the prince of the devils. If you
[1:11:18] defeated the king, you don't have to
[1:11:20] worry about anybody else under him. In
[1:11:22] prayer and fasting, that situation had
[1:11:24] shown Jesus who he was. He knew who he
[1:11:27] was. He knew what his purpose was. He
[1:11:29] knew what the father's will was. And so,
[1:11:30] he could walk out and do it. And there
[1:11:32] was no unbelief there. It was perfect
[1:11:34] faith operating through him. He says,
[1:11:36] "The problem with you is that you don't
[1:11:38] know who you are.
[1:11:40] You haven't spent the
[1:11:42] time to figure out the father's will for
[1:11:44] you. And so when things like this pop
[1:11:47] up, you can't do anything about
[1:11:53] it. We see in the disciples later on the
[1:11:55] ninth chapter of Luke, they lacked
[1:11:58] revelation. They couldn't understand who
[1:12:00] they were. They couldn't understand even
[1:12:01] who Jesus was. They couldn't fully place
[1:12:03] him in the word. And they couldn't put
[1:12:05] it all together. And so they kept
[1:12:06] getting themselves into a bind because
[1:12:08] they couldn't place themselves in the
[1:12:10] word. Amen. It was a power that was on
[1:12:12] them, but it was not a power that had
[1:12:14] changed them yet. And so they kept
[1:12:15] limiting themselves and they kept
[1:12:17] getting themselves into trouble. Amen.
[1:12:19] Imperfect vessels get in the way so many
[1:12:21] times. It says, "And they were all
[1:12:23] amazed at the mighty power of God. But
[1:12:26] while they wondered everyone at the
[1:12:27] things which Jesus did, he said unto his
[1:12:29] disciples, "Let these sayings sink down
[1:12:32] into your ears, for the Son of Man shall
[1:12:34] be delivered into the hands of men." It
[1:12:36] says, "But they understood not this
[1:12:38] saying, and it was hid from them that
[1:12:41] they perceived it not, and they feared
[1:12:43] to ask him of that saying." And we see
[1:12:45] this time and again with the the
[1:12:47] disciples that they don't understand
[1:12:49] what he's talking about. Sometimes they
[1:12:51] ask him, sometimes they don't. Amen. And
[1:12:54] the scripture says here that it was hid
[1:12:56] from them and it's reflective of the
[1:12:58] fact that they're not born
[1:13:00] again. They're not meant to see it
[1:13:03] because they can't even handle it. Amen.
[1:13:05] The revelation that would bring faith
[1:13:07] was limited at this point. It takes a
[1:13:10] revelation for faith because revelation
[1:13:12] is is or faith is what? It's a
[1:13:14] revelation of the will of God. Faith to
[1:13:17] be healed is that you know that it is
[1:13:19] God's will for you to be healed. That's
[1:13:21] all it is. And when you know that it is
[1:13:23] his will for you to be healed, it
[1:13:24] doesn't matter how long it
[1:13:26] takes. If it's his will to deliver you,
[1:13:28] if it's his will to bless you in a
[1:13:30] certain way, if it's his will to keep
[1:13:32] you alive, nothing can take you. But you
[1:13:35] need that faith to lay hold of that and
[1:13:36] say, "It's for me. This is God's will
[1:13:39] for me." Amen. What the scripture says
[1:13:41] here, it wasn't their
[1:13:43] time. And it was hidden from their eyes.
[1:13:45] God has a time and a season for
[1:13:47] everything. And I can't preach hard to
[1:13:49] make it happen. And I can't preach hard
[1:13:51] to keep it from happening. God's got a
[1:13:53] season and a time for these things. But
[1:13:55] I love how God never leaves us
[1:13:57] wondering. He's Jesus said, "You are I
[1:14:00] don't call you my servants. I call you
[1:14:01] my friends." He says, "I show you
[1:14:03] everything that the father has showed
[1:14:04] me." But it's in a time and it's in a
[1:14:07] season. We don't just download
[1:14:09] everything on somebody. Somebody comes
[1:14:10] into our church, we don't just download
[1:14:11] everything that we know and believe on
[1:14:12] them. We let the Holy Spirit work in
[1:14:14] their lives because there's a time and a
[1:14:16] season. God will work in their life. And
[1:14:18] that's how we end up with real
[1:14:19] Christians rather than legalists.
[1:14:21] Because if I force it, then somebody
[1:14:24] else will force them a different way
[1:14:25] eventually. But if the Holy Spirit does
[1:14:27] it, then they're changed forever. But
[1:14:29] there's a time and a season. God's
[1:14:31] intention is not to keep us in the dark.
[1:14:33] His intention is to reveal all things by
[1:14:35] the spirit of truth. But he's got a time
[1:14:37] and a season for it. He would say in
[1:14:39] John 16 to the disciples, this is just
[1:14:42] before the uh the the the the trial and
[1:14:44] the crucifixion. He says, "I have yet
[1:14:46] many things to say unto you, but you
[1:14:48] cannot bear them." Now, that word bear
[1:14:51] means carry. You can't take it up. You
[1:14:53] can't endure it. You can sustain it. You
[1:14:55] can pick it up for a moment, but you
[1:14:57] can't keep carrying it. You lack the
[1:14:59] strength. You lack the power to endure
[1:15:01] the burden of what I would tell
[1:15:03] you. Look at Paul when Christ tells him,
[1:15:07] he says, "I want you to appeal to
[1:15:09] Caesar." And they said, "Don't do that."
[1:15:11] People were saying, "Why are you
[1:15:12] appealing to Caesar? That's almost a
[1:15:13] death sentence." And God said, "I'm
[1:15:15] going to take you and you will give your
[1:15:17] life." How many of us could handle that?
[1:15:19] If God said, "I want you to go and I
[1:15:21] want you to you're and you're going to
[1:15:22] lose your life for doing my will." That
[1:15:24] takes a power, church, that takes a
[1:15:27] power in your life to do it. Jesus had
[1:15:29] so many things that he wanted to tell
[1:15:30] them, but he says, "You're going to have
[1:15:32] to wait till you can endure it. And it's
[1:15:34] going to take a power in your life." He
[1:15:36] says, "How be it, when he, the Spirit of
[1:15:39] truth, is come, he'll guide you into all
[1:15:41] truth. For he shall not speak of
[1:15:43] himself, but whatsoever he shall hear,
[1:15:44] that shall he speak, and he will show
[1:15:46] you things to come. So Jesus is pointing
[1:15:48] them to a time and a season where they
[1:15:50] can receive all
[1:15:52] truth. Remember remember what he said.
[1:15:55] Jesus said that it is the spirit of
[1:15:57] truth, which means it's the spirit of
[1:15:59] the word because he said, "Thy word is
[1:16:01] truth." So this will be a spirit of the
[1:16:03] word of God. The Holy Spirit always
[1:16:05] points us back to the word, not to
[1:16:08] church doctrine, not to church
[1:16:10] tradition. It takes us back to this
[1:16:12] because this is the only thing that has
[1:16:14] power in it. That's why I preach out of
[1:16:16] a Bible is because this is what is
[1:16:18] proven. This is the thoughts of God. My
[1:16:20] commentary is not the thoughts of God.
[1:16:22] It may or may not be. This is the word
[1:16:24] of God. This is pure. This is absolute.
[1:16:26] And when we're talking absolute power,
[1:16:28] we'll get into this next service. You
[1:16:30] need to have an absolute. An absolute
[1:16:32] has everything it needs within itself.
[1:16:35] It needs nothing added and nothing can
[1:16:37] be taken away.
[1:16:38] So when we're talking absolute power, we
[1:16:41] need to have an absolute and it's the
[1:16:42] spirit of truth. It's the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:44] And that's what has quickening power to
[1:16:47] make us live what this word says. Church
[1:16:50] tradition won't do it. Mom and dad's
[1:16:52] tradition won't do it. Pressure from the
[1:16:54] church people won't do it. It takes a
[1:16:56] life inside of us. It takes a power
[1:16:58] inside of us to do that. Amen. Look at
[1:17:00] the condition of these disciples. They
[1:17:02] have the power of the Holy Spirit on
[1:17:04] their lives, healing the sick, raising
[1:17:06] the dead, casting out demons, and
[1:17:08] they're ignorant of the word of God.
[1:17:10] They can't even see themselves in it.
[1:17:12] They can't see Jesus in it. They can't
[1:17:14] place themselves where they are. And
[1:17:17] yet, they have this tremendous power
[1:17:18] inside of them. Amen. They had all this
[1:17:21] power, church, but we'll see very
[1:17:23] shortly, they don't have the character
[1:17:24] to truly operate it.
[1:17:27] They don't have the power to operate it.
[1:17:29] We've heard before many times that power
[1:17:31] without character is satanic. And we see
[1:17:34] here that they could do miracles
[1:17:35] indefinitely. But the longer they were
[1:17:37] left to their own devices, the more the
[1:17:39] power started to work in ways that were
[1:17:41] not of God. Why? Because the power that
[1:17:44] they needed had not worked on their life
[1:17:46] yet. It was just flowing through them.
[1:17:47] But they needed the character of their
[1:17:49] life to be refined. It hadn't dealt with
[1:17:52] their soul condition. Their souls were
[1:17:54] unregenerated. They they had not gone
[1:17:56] through a new birth. Now listen, these
[1:17:58] are the most these aside from Christ,
[1:18:00] these are the most powerful men on the
[1:18:03] planet at that time. And look at what
[1:18:05] happens in Luke 9, church. Luke 9 is all
[1:18:08] happening in the space of a couple
[1:18:09] weeks. Okay? This is how quickly that
[1:18:11] power
[1:18:14] corrupts. It says in Luke 9:46, "And
[1:18:17] there are roles of reasoning among them
[1:18:19] which of them should be the
[1:18:22] greatest." We laugh.
[1:18:25] But this is what happens with power
[1:18:29] given to somebody whose character has
[1:18:31] not been proven and tested. It says,
[1:18:34] "And Jesus perceiving the thought of
[1:18:35] their heart, took a child and set him by
[1:18:38] him and said unto them, whosoever shall
[1:18:40] receive this child in my name receiveth
[1:18:42] me, and whosoever shall receive me
[1:18:44] receiveth him that sent me. For he that
[1:18:47] is least among you all, the same shall
[1:18:50] be
[1:18:51] great." We see this power started going
[1:18:53] to their head. And we see pride and
[1:18:56] arrogance now start to arise in their
[1:18:58] midst. They started they were going to
[1:19:00] be thinking they were going to be
[1:19:01] someone great. They started thinking
[1:19:02] they were going to have this great
[1:19:03] ministry that as Jesus went on, as he
[1:19:05] was eventually going to do, hey, I'm
[1:19:07] going to step in and I'm going to fill
[1:19:09] Jesus
[1:19:11] shoes. I'm going to have influence. I'm
[1:19:14] going to have a church. I'm going to
[1:19:15] have a following. I'm not going to be a
[1:19:17] disciple. I'm going to have disciples.
[1:19:23] This is what
[1:19:24] happens when power is put in an
[1:19:26] unsanctified vessel, an unprepared
[1:19:29] vessel.
[1:19:30] Amen. Church, we're talking about
[1:19:33] ignorant men, most of them, that were
[1:19:35] nothing. And in the space of a few short
[1:19:37] weeks under the anointing of the Holy
[1:19:39] Ghost, without a new birth, they were
[1:19:42] turned into
[1:19:44] selfserving
[1:19:48] men. What is it now? Now the power is
[1:19:51] starting to make them focus on
[1:19:53] themselves. What can I get out of this
[1:19:56] power? What's this power going to do for
[1:19:58] me? How great is my life going to be now
[1:20:00] that I've got this power? Why? Because
[1:20:03] when you can heal all diseases and cast
[1:20:04] out all demons, people start pointing to
[1:20:07] you and you start to believe what people
[1:20:10] say about you eventually. It takes the
[1:20:12] Holy Ghost to point and say, "No, no,
[1:20:14] no. This isn't me." And we'll see this
[1:20:16] change once we get after the the the
[1:20:18] upper room experience where they're
[1:20:20] quick to deflect. But here, what is it?
[1:20:22] They're taking all of the credit and
[1:20:25] they start to think, "Hey, I'm something
[1:20:28] though." What was it, church? They
[1:20:31] started blending their
[1:20:33] commission with
[1:20:35] ambition. It never
[1:20:38] never works.
[1:20:40] The minute self-interest climbs behind
[1:20:42] this pulpit, I'm
[1:20:45] toast. And it'll it'll hurt the church.
[1:20:48] It's got to be about you and not me. In
[1:20:52] every position we're in, every servant
[1:20:54] in here, every officer, whatever we're
[1:20:57] doing, from the musicians to the
[1:20:58] trustees to the treasurer to the
[1:21:00] deacons, the ministry, whatever it might
[1:21:02] be, the minute it becomes about me and
[1:21:05] not
[1:21:06] you, there's a fall coming. It has to
[1:21:10] and we'll see that happens. Listen to
[1:21:12] this. He says the disciples even walking
[1:21:14] with Jesus, they didn't have any
[1:21:16] oneness. They didn't have any unity. No,
[1:21:18] they argued who's going to be the bishop
[1:21:19] after this? Who's the greatest among us?
[1:21:21] They couldn't even believe Jesus. They
[1:21:24] couldn't understand him. Thou speakest
[1:21:26] in riddles. Tell us plainly what you
[1:21:27] mean. There was no unity between Jesus
[1:21:29] and the disciples or the disciples to
[1:21:31] Jesus and the disciples amongst one
[1:21:33] another. The disciples who walked hand
[1:21:36] in hand with Jesus, slept with him, ate
[1:21:38] with him, watched his miracles, and
[1:21:40] associated with him, close as any
[1:21:42] brother could be. And yet, they didn't
[1:21:45] have it. He says they weren't fit to
[1:21:48] preach the gospel. He says Jesus said,
[1:21:51] "Don't you preach anymore. Don't you
[1:21:53] even try." He says, "You wait up there
[1:21:56] at the city of Jerusalem. I'm going to
[1:21:58] send the promise that's been given you
[1:22:00] upon you, and that will unify you there.
[1:22:04] I love in that that that TV series, The
[1:22:07] Chosen, you know, on the life of Jesus,
[1:22:09] where where they they they they kind of
[1:22:12] show this this in in a particular way
[1:22:14] and the disciples are all sitting around
[1:22:16] a campfire, if I remember correctly, and
[1:22:18] it's in the evening. They're all sitting
[1:22:20] around a campfire arguing who's going to
[1:22:23] be the best while doing absolutely
[1:22:26] nothing. They're sitting around taking
[1:22:28] their leisure, nice easy evening around
[1:22:31] the campfire talking about who's going
[1:22:32] to be the greatest in the kingdom. And
[1:22:34] in the middle of their conversation,
[1:22:36] Jesus stumbles out of the darkness. He's
[1:22:39] haggarded. He's worn. He can barely
[1:22:42] stand
[1:22:43] up. He's got blood on him from dealing
[1:22:46] with sick people. And he staggers
[1:22:48] through the camp through the through the
[1:22:50] camp and falls into his
[1:22:52] tent. And you know what it does? It
[1:22:55] shuts them up because he's out there
[1:22:58] serving and they're sitting there
[1:23:00] talking about how awesome I
[1:23:01] am doing absolutely nothing for the
[1:23:04] kingdom of God. And it shut them up. I
[1:23:07] thought it was a wonderful I know not
[1:23:09] necessarily scriptural, but I thought it
[1:23:11] was a great example that so often our
[1:23:13] arrogance is when we're doing nothing.
[1:23:15] And it's the ones that are serving that
[1:23:18] really are showing the power that's
[1:23:19] supposed to be exhibited in these
[1:23:21] things. Amen.
[1:23:23] I've said this many times. If the spirit
[1:23:25] of God is in this church, and by that I
[1:23:26] mean in the people, then anyone with the
[1:23:29] spirit of God ought to be able to come
[1:23:31] in here and get along with
[1:23:32] us. Because the Holy Spirit is a
[1:23:35] unifying power for the body of Christ.
[1:23:39] He says in 1 Corinthians 12, "By one
[1:23:41] spirit, you're baptized into one body."
[1:23:45] The very baptism of the Holy Ghost joins
[1:23:48] you with the body of Christ. And if
[1:23:50] you've got the spirit of God and I've
[1:23:51] got the spirit of God, we have to be
[1:23:52] able to get along together. Cuz I'll
[1:23:54] tell you one thing, we're going to spend
[1:23:55] eternity together. If we don't get along
[1:23:58] here, church, we're not going to get
[1:23:59] along there. But it's going to take a
[1:24:01] humbling to do that. Cuz we've all got
[1:24:03] rough spots. We've all got rough spots.
[1:24:06] Amen. Three of us raised our hands.
[1:24:09] Four, five, six. There we
[1:24:11] go. But I'm raising my hand. We've all
[1:24:14] got rough
[1:24:15] spots. We've all got things that need to
[1:24:17] be rubbed off. And sometimes what
[1:24:19] happens is your rough spot hits my rough
[1:24:21] spot and we both get a real enjoyable
[1:24:24] time of being humbled. That's the way it
[1:24:27] works because we've all got them. That's
[1:24:30] what this work is here for in this life.
[1:24:32] This walk through time is to get the
[1:24:34] rough spots off so that we can reflect
[1:24:36] the image of Christ more perfectly.
[1:24:38] Amen. The overarching impact of the Holy
[1:24:41] Spirit is always unity. But what drives
[1:24:44] us apart? What drives us apart is when I
[1:24:47] think I'm better than you.
[1:24:50] Now, it's mostly you thinking you're
[1:24:51] better than me if we're
[1:24:53] honest. But it is it's when I think in
[1:24:56] some way I'm better than you. That's
[1:24:58] what drives us apart. You're not as
[1:24:59] valuable. You're not as gifted. Or
[1:25:03] Brother Grant, you're more
[1:25:05] gifted. Right? Jealousy will drive us
[1:25:08] apart just as much as as
[1:25:10] arrogance. Amen. It doesn't work that
[1:25:13] way. The Holy Spirit places us into the
[1:25:16] body and we're content and satisfied
[1:25:18] with our portion and our place because
[1:25:21] it's his choosing. It's his placing, not
[1:25:24] mine. I've said it many times before.
[1:25:26] Never wanted to be a preacher. Never
[1:25:27] thought I was going to preacher.
[1:25:28] Definitely didn't want to be a pastor.
[1:25:30] And here we are. Here we
[1:25:33] are. It is what it is. It's up to God.
[1:25:38] Amen. The Holy Spirit always brings
[1:25:41] humility. Jesus said, "Whoever wants to
[1:25:44] be the greatest, let him be the servant
[1:25:46] of all." Paul said it this way. He says,
[1:25:48] "Let each esteem the other greater than
[1:25:52] himself." That's a pretty good thing to
[1:25:54] write on your fridge. Don't write on
[1:25:55] your fridge. Write on paper and put it
[1:25:56] on your
[1:25:57] fridge. Let me think the other. Think
[1:26:00] truly think. Not not a put on. But you
[1:26:03] can only do that when you see the value
[1:26:04] of the person you're looking at. Amen.
[1:26:08] That's why I love having a small church
[1:26:10] in a way is because I get to know each
[1:26:12] of you and I get to see your true value.
[1:26:14] We have 300 here. Guess what? I don't
[1:26:16] get to know everybody. I don't get to
[1:26:18] see everybody. But in a small church, we
[1:26:19] need every single person here. And each
[1:26:22] one of us adds something. And if you're
[1:26:24] not here, we lose something because it's
[1:26:26] a body that God has put together with
[1:26:29] all of the things that we have need of
[1:26:31] together. Amen. But the Holy Spirit
[1:26:33] always brings
[1:26:34] humility, not pride and not arrogance.
[1:26:38] Amen. And I found consistently that
[1:26:40] people that crave recognition or
[1:26:42] influence or authority are inherently
[1:26:45] immature in their Christian walk or they
[1:26:48] have never had a new
[1:26:49] birth. That's my experience. Take it or
[1:26:52] leave it. We can see time and time again
[1:26:54] in the scriptures, God uses people that
[1:26:56] think they're nothing, absolute
[1:26:59] nobodyies. And the ones that thought
[1:27:01] they were somebody, he takes them out on
[1:27:02] the desert and he beats the living
[1:27:04] daylights out of them until they say, "I
[1:27:06] can't even do it." And he says, "Okay,
[1:27:07] now you're ready to do it." Whether he
[1:27:09] did it with Moses, the meakest man, the
[1:27:11] the the prophet that Jesus was compared
[1:27:13] to, or Saul that he turned into Paul,
[1:27:17] takes them and he gets them to a place
[1:27:18] where they say, "I counted everything I
[1:27:21] had, but don't. It's
[1:27:23] poop compared to what I have now."
[1:27:26] That's where God's got to get us. But
[1:27:28] I'm in the the minute we start looking
[1:27:31] to benefit ourselves by the goodness of
[1:27:32] God in our life, the Holy Spirit takes a
[1:27:35] run. He has to look at look at
[1:27:38] Balum. Balam was a true prophet with a
[1:27:42] true gift. And the minute he sought God
[1:27:45] and went against God's
[1:27:47] requirement, what happened? The gift was
[1:27:50] still there, but he was a false anointed
[1:27:52] vessel. And he led himself to
[1:27:54] destruction. He led himself to
[1:27:56] destruction. And the Israelites ended up
[1:27:58] killing him. Why? Because he wanted to
[1:28:00] benefit himself with the gift that he he
[1:28:02] was given. Look at Gahesy, the serpent
[1:28:04] of Elisha. Remember non comes all the
[1:28:06] way from Syria. Elisha doesn't even see
[1:28:08] him. He just tells the Gahhesi what to
[1:28:10] tell him. Gay goes out and says, "Go and
[1:28:12] wash in the river Jordan seven times and
[1:28:14] you'll be clean." Non goes and does it.
[1:28:17] Comes back and says, "Hey, I I want to
[1:28:18] thank you. I've got all this money. I've
[1:28:20] got all this clothing. Let me give it to
[1:28:22] you." And Elisha says,
[1:28:23] "No, this is not for me. This is this is
[1:28:26] to give out. This is a gift to you. I
[1:28:29] won't take anything for that which I've
[1:28:30] had nothing to do with. It's God that
[1:28:32] did it. And so non runs away. Well,
[1:28:34] Gahes sitting there and he says, "Now I
[1:28:36] can get something out of this." And he
[1:28:37] runs after Non. And he says, "Oh, just
[1:28:39] after you left, somebody showed up." And
[1:28:42] so we need a garment to give him. We
[1:28:43] need we need to give him a gift. And Non
[1:28:45] says, "Well, take two and take this and
[1:28:47] that." And and then what did Geazy do?
[1:28:48] He took it and he hid it. Come into the
[1:28:50] house. And Elisha says, "Gazy, where you
[1:28:52] been?"
[1:28:53] Oh, it was just out of you
[1:28:55] know Gahesy says because you did it for
[1:28:58] you took glory to yourself. He says the
[1:29:00] disease that was on him is now on you.
[1:29:02] And Gahesy was a leper from the for the
[1:29:04] rest of his life. Why? He tried to
[1:29:06] inject his ambition into his commission.
[1:29:08] Gahesy saw wonderful miracles. He was a
[1:29:11] part of many wonderful deliverances. He
[1:29:13] saw prophecy happen. He saw visions
[1:29:15] happen. All of these wonderful things.
[1:29:17] But the minute he injected himself into
[1:29:18] it, it led him down a path of
[1:29:19] destruction. He died a leper.
[1:29:23] We've heard that quote many times that
[1:29:25] character is not a gift. It's a victory.
[1:29:28] What is character? A victory
[1:29:30] over self. Victory over
[1:29:34] self-will. Victory over self-love.
[1:29:37] Right, brother
[1:29:39] Joe? He sent me a text the other day
[1:29:41] that I wish I had my phone here. And he
[1:29:44] says, "Isn't this just the truth?" And
[1:29:46] it was about self- loveve. And of
[1:29:47] course, it was very tongue and cheek,
[1:29:49] but the world preaches self-love. Jesus
[1:29:52] said, "If you won't lose your
[1:29:55] life, it'll be taken from you anyways.
[1:29:58] You got to give it up." Amen. Self-will,
[1:30:02] self-preservation, self-interest, self-
[1:30:07] fulfillment. All these things, this is
[1:30:09] what character is a victory over. How do
[1:30:11] you know when somebody's got character?
[1:30:12] Is when they're put in a situation where
[1:30:14] they can benefit themselves and they
[1:30:16] choose to benefit everybody else. They
[1:30:18] do what's right in God's eyes rather
[1:30:19] than what's right for them.
[1:30:21] That's how you know you have character.
[1:30:23] And when they do it over and over and
[1:30:24] over again, that's when you know they're
[1:30:25] ready for leadership. That's when you
[1:30:26] know they're ready for authority. That's
[1:30:28] when you're, you know, they're ready for
[1:30:29] influence. And I find with those things,
[1:30:31] you don't have to give it to them. They
[1:30:32] get it because they have character. It's
[1:30:35] because they've proven themselves that
[1:30:36] they get those things in the first
[1:30:37] place. They don't have to ask for it.
[1:30:39] It's just given to them. Why? Because
[1:30:41] they take themselves out of the picture
[1:30:43] and they do what's best for everybody
[1:30:45] else. They do the right thing no matter
[1:30:47] what. No matter how hard it is, how big
[1:30:49] the impact is financially, health, hey,
[1:30:52] we've got this facade sometimes of
[1:30:54] perfect Christianity. Sometimes a good
[1:30:56] apology is what we need to humble us.
[1:30:59] Say, "Hey, I was wrong. I was wrong and
[1:31:02] I want to make it right." We need to be
[1:31:03] quick, quick to repent, quick to
[1:31:06] acknowledge our our faults. Because
[1:31:08] that's what the Holy Spirit's there to
[1:31:09] do because he's trying to develop
[1:31:11] character in our lives. The more we can
[1:31:13] take ourselves out of the picture, the
[1:31:14] more we can do what's right in the eyes
[1:31:15] of God, the more character we have. And
[1:31:17] the more you point to
[1:31:19] him, the more character that you have as
[1:31:21] well. Amen. When things go well for us
[1:31:24] in leadership, in in work, in our
[1:31:26] finances, career, whatever it is, we've
[1:31:28] got to be able to glorify God. We've got
[1:31:30] to be able to point to him. And we see
[1:31:31] here what happened to the disciples was
[1:31:33] they started taking credit to
[1:31:36] themselves. Amen. Paul said that our
[1:31:39] lives ought to be to the praise of his
[1:31:41] glory, not our own. Not our own. We'll
[1:31:45] see after the day of Pentecost. They
[1:31:46] give it where it's due, but they don't
[1:31:48] do it before that. You know, I was
[1:31:50] talking about, you know, we talk about
[1:31:52] uh being protective and and jealous. And
[1:31:56] we can get that way when somebody comes
[1:31:57] in that does something better than we
[1:31:59] do. This can be a real issue for
[1:32:02] ministry because you have a man that's
[1:32:04] behind the pulpit and somebody comes in
[1:32:05] that has a different gift, a better gift
[1:32:09] even by estimation of many people. And
[1:32:11] what happens? They get protective. They
[1:32:14] protect the pulpit. They put them away.
[1:32:17] They start talking about them. Oh, I see
[1:32:19] this. And yeah, what is it? You're
[1:32:22] trying to protect yourself. It's
[1:32:24] selfishness. It's not character. It
[1:32:27] can't be. Amen. We've got to understand
[1:32:30] God made us in a particular way. And he
[1:32:34] gave us what we could handle. Whether
[1:32:37] it's a gift, listen, I may only be able
[1:32:40] to go this high because maybe beyond
[1:32:42] this, my pride and arrogance will kick
[1:32:44] in. God had to do it to Paul. Paul had
[1:32:48] the greatest revelation of anybody
[1:32:51] beyond Christ himself. And he said,
[1:32:53] "Paul, I put a thorn in your side to
[1:32:56] keep your pride and arrogance from
[1:32:58] coming up." Because Paul, your base
[1:33:00] nature, your flesh nature will creep in
[1:33:02] if you don't have this little thing in
[1:33:03] your life. And it'll keep you a
[1:33:05] reminder. It'll give you a reminder that
[1:33:08] this is of me, not of
[1:33:09] you. Amen. Whatever we can do, how
[1:33:13] great, how little it might be, it's all
[1:33:14] for the glory and benefit of the body of
[1:33:16] Christ. Amen. Someone else can do it.
[1:33:18] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I so
[1:33:21] enjoy when we have brother Jonathan
[1:33:22] Martin in completely different gift. How
[1:33:25] wonderful was it? What kind of a of a
[1:33:28] shrew would I have to
[1:33:29] be to say, "Well, I don't want him to
[1:33:32] come in because he makes me look so bad.
[1:33:36] Seriously, he can preach the lights
[1:33:38] out. But how wonderful was it? It was a
[1:33:41] wonderful thing. That's why we bring him
[1:33:43] in. That's why Brother Grant gets to
[1:33:46] preach is because it's not about me.
[1:33:48] It's about you. It's about what will
[1:33:50] benefit the body of Christ. What will
[1:33:52] benefit him? It benefits him to be up
[1:33:55] here. I'm not saying I don't get
[1:33:56] anything out of preaching, but I'm
[1:33:58] saying I've got to be up here for your
[1:33:59] sake, not for mine. That's for sure.
[1:34:02] Look at James 4. He says, "So do you
[1:34:04] think that the scripture saith in vain
[1:34:06] that the spirit that dwelleth in us
[1:34:07] lustth to envy?" In other words, the
[1:34:09] spirit of God in you will not make you
[1:34:11] desire or be from start to finish. The
[1:34:13] problem is we never see what got the
[1:34:15] person to that place, but we still want
[1:34:17] it. He says, "But he giveth more grace.
[1:34:20] Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the
[1:34:22] proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
[1:34:25] Submit yourselves, therefore, to God.
[1:34:27] Resist the devil, and he will flee from
[1:34:29] you." I'm trying to show you a pattern
[1:34:31] here with the disciples because if you
[1:34:33] look at it, the disciples were perfect
[1:34:35] church
[1:34:38] members. Come on. They walked away from
[1:34:42] everything. Literally in some cases left
[1:34:44] their boats, left their office in the
[1:34:46] case of Matthew. Just walked away. Left
[1:34:49] everything. Dad, see you later. It's all
[1:34:51] on you. Fishing is all on you now. We're
[1:34:52] gone. What am I going to do? I got all
[1:34:54] these boats that I I've got mortgages on
[1:34:57] the boats. I've got loans on all this
[1:34:58] equipment and you're telling me I'm
[1:34:59] losing my two best hands. Sorry, Dad.
[1:35:01] We're gone. They left everything to
[1:35:03] serve Christ, to follow him, to be his
[1:35:06] disciples. But to this point, they're
[1:35:08] still just church
[1:35:10] members. That's it. They had massive
[1:35:13] power given to them as a church member,
[1:35:17] but they had no they lacked revelation.
[1:35:19] They lacked character. They lacked
[1:35:20] understanding. They lacked faith. All
[1:35:23] this is all happening in the space of a
[1:35:25] few weeks.
[1:35:27] And it's showing us that the changes we
[1:35:29] need in our life is not church
[1:35:30] attendance.
[1:35:33] It's great. Praise the Lord. I will
[1:35:35] never tell you stop coming to church.
[1:35:37] But something has to happen when you
[1:35:39] come to church. And that's that you've
[1:35:41] got to have a personal experience with
[1:35:43] Jesus Christ where he changes your life
[1:35:46] forever. Not for the service, not for
[1:35:49] the week, not for the month, but where
[1:35:51] you can say, "I am no longer who I was.
[1:35:54] I am a new creation in Christ Jesus and
[1:35:58] everything in my life has been changed.
[1:36:00] We're still a work in progress. It's not
[1:36:02] that everything was changed. It's that
[1:36:04] you were changed in a way that can never
[1:36:06] be unchanged, if I could put it that
[1:36:09] way. But these are the chosen handpicked
[1:36:12] disciples of Jesus Christ. Pick with
[1:36:14] purpose and look at the massive flaws
[1:36:16] and issues they cause. That's why I'm
[1:36:18] saying you can't just be a church
[1:36:19] member. You got to be filled with the
[1:36:20] Holy Ghost. That's the only thing
[1:36:21] that'll bring us into unity.
[1:36:24] says, ' And John answered and said,
[1:36:26] Master, we saw one casting out devils in
[1:36:29] thy name, and we forbade him because he
[1:36:32] followth not with us. And Jesus said
[1:36:34] unto him, forbid him not, for he that is
[1:36:36] not against us is for us. So we see the
[1:36:38] disciples now, Jesus had talked to them,
[1:36:41] and they had only heard him talk to
[1:36:43] them. They had been the only ones that
[1:36:44] they heard him give power to. And so
[1:36:46] when they saw somebody else doing what
[1:36:48] they thought only they were allowed to
[1:36:49] do or should do, they said, "You better
[1:36:51] stop that. Don't you do that. What is
[1:36:54] it, church? They were protecting their
[1:36:56] own ministry. They were protecting their
[1:36:59] own position. And they said, "Listen, we
[1:37:01] don't know anything about you. Jesus
[1:37:03] never mentioned you to us. You were not
[1:37:04] part of the original commission. You
[1:37:07] don't travel with us. You're not a
[1:37:08] member of our church. We've never seen
[1:37:10] you at any services. Stop
[1:37:13] it." Right? And yet, look at the
[1:37:16] results. The results was that person was
[1:37:19] casting out devils and they were
[1:37:21] leaving.
[1:37:23] So
[1:37:24] clearly God was on his side. But they
[1:37:27] said, "You stop doing the work of God
[1:37:28] because we don't know anything about
[1:37:29] you. This is just for us." What was it
[1:37:33] church? Denominational thinking. Us 12
[1:37:36] and no more. But they didn't even know
[1:37:39] that one of the 12 of them was bad. Us
[1:37:41] 12, including the bad one. But you can't
[1:37:43] do it because you're getting
[1:37:45] results. What was it? It was them
[1:37:47] exercising authority they didn't have.
[1:37:50] And Jesus had to correct them. They
[1:37:52] didn't try and correct this man because
[1:37:53] he was doing something wrong. They tried
[1:37:56] to stop him because he was doing
[1:37:57] something that they didn't want him to
[1:37:58] do because it was only for
[1:38:02] them. They were protecting their own
[1:38:04] ministry rather than focusing on their
[1:38:07] own
[1:38:09] ministry. Many times people will ask,
[1:38:12] you know, what do you think of so- and
[1:38:13] so or brother so and so or even sister
[1:38:15] so and so? you know, ministry in
[1:38:17] particular tends to be the thing.
[1:38:20] Listen, I can have an opinion all day
[1:38:21] long, and I probably do, but in the end,
[1:38:24] it really doesn't matter what brother so
[1:38:26] and so was preaching or not preaching,
[1:38:28] what sister so and so was doing or not
[1:38:30] doing. Why? Because the Holy Spirit's
[1:38:32] here to work on
[1:38:34] me. He's not here to work on you. He's
[1:38:36] here to work on me. That's what I need
[1:38:38] to be focused on is, am I doing what God
[1:38:40] wants me to do? Not is brother so and so
[1:38:42] doing it or not doing it or sister so
[1:38:44] and so doing it or not doing it. Church,
[1:38:46] we don't choose the vessels. We don't
[1:38:48] choose the gifts. We don't choose the
[1:38:50] place. We don't choose the time. It is
[1:38:51] completely of God's choosing. Amen. We
[1:38:53] don't choose the members of the body of
[1:38:56] Christ. We don't. It's of his choosing.
[1:38:59] Amen. So, we can't be protective. We
[1:39:01] can't be trying to control other people
[1:39:03] doing what they're doing. Listen, the
[1:39:05] fruits will show eventually anyways. We
[1:39:08] just have to have a bit of
[1:39:09] patience. And I find so often we're most
[1:39:12] critical when we're doing nothing. So
[1:39:14] let's get back to doing what we're
[1:39:16] supposed to be doing and we won't be so
[1:39:17] worried about what everybody else is
[1:39:19] doing. I find when I'm dry is when I get
[1:39:22] critical. I find that pretty universally
[1:39:25] right correct. You know, listen, we may
[1:39:28] not like it sometimes. We can see things
[1:39:30] and we are 100% sure that is
[1:39:33] wrong. We can think the motives are
[1:39:35] wrong. We can think the attitudes are
[1:39:36] wrong. And sometimes as time comes out,
[1:39:38] we realize we were right. And sometimes
[1:39:40] we realize we were wrong about somebody
[1:39:42] or something as well. But in the end,
[1:39:44] the fruits will show whether it was of
[1:39:46] God or whether it was not of God.
[1:39:47] Remember what Galiel said. Galia was the
[1:39:50] one that taught Saul who became Paul.
[1:39:52] But when the apostles were doing all
[1:39:53] these miracles and things, he said,
[1:39:55] "Listen, brothers." He says, "If it's of
[1:39:57] God, it'll move forward. And if it's of
[1:39:59] God, it'll come to nothing." He says,
[1:40:01] "Let's just leave it alone. Unless," he
[1:40:03] said, "we'd be fine to be fighting
[1:40:05] against God. Just let the fruits bear
[1:40:07] out. It'll show itself in the end."
[1:40:09] Amen. I've been in situations. I am in
[1:40:12] situations where you're looking at
[1:40:14] things and you're not sure. You're
[1:40:15] doubtful of gifts or callings or
[1:40:17] ministries or positions and all these
[1:40:19] different things. But the Lord knows
[1:40:20] them that are his and he'll prove it
[1:40:22] out. It's not up to me to prove it. It's
[1:40:24] up to him to prove it. I can keep my
[1:40:26] hands off it. It's not my life. I don't
[1:40:28] have to worry about
[1:40:29] it. Look what Paul would say. Paul dealt
[1:40:32] with this. He said, "Some indeed preach
[1:40:34] Christ even of envy and
[1:40:36] strife, and some also of goodwill. The
[1:40:39] one preached Christ of contention, not
[1:40:41] sincerely, supposing to add affliction
[1:40:43] to my bonds, but the other of love,
[1:40:45] knowing that I am set for the defense of
[1:40:47] the gospel." He says, "What then? What
[1:40:49] do we do with this?" He says,
[1:40:52] "Notwithstanding, every way, whether in
[1:40:55] pretense or in truth, Christ is
[1:40:57] preached." He says, "And I therein do
[1:41:00] rejoice. Yay. And will
[1:41:01] rejoice. He says, "Listen, as long as
[1:41:04] Christ is preached, that's all I care
[1:41:06] about." The motives will sort themselves
[1:41:09] out. The gifts will sort themselves out.
[1:41:11] The movements will sort themselves out.
[1:41:13] But if Christ is preached, Christ will
[1:41:15] find his own. He'll do what he needs to
[1:41:18] do. He can use a false anointed vessel
[1:41:21] and that vessel will fall away. But the
[1:41:23] people under that ministry can move on.
[1:41:25] I've experienced it. You know guy what
[1:41:28] what happened in Texas and these
[1:41:29] different things sitting under a false
[1:41:30] pastor doesn't mean I never grew under
[1:41:32] him. His failure did not impact
[1:41:36] me. False vessel, false anointed. Real
[1:41:38] anointing, false vessel. God can still
[1:41:41] use a broken
[1:41:42] vessel. But in the end, the fruits will
[1:41:44] show what was really inside there. Watch
[1:41:47] this continuation of the issues with the
[1:41:49] disciples. This is for our good church.
[1:41:52] This is so that we can look in our lives
[1:41:53] and say, "What is what is the power of
[1:41:55] God doing in my
[1:41:57] life? Am I just coming to church and am
[1:42:00] I a member or am I am I a part of the
[1:42:02] body of Christ today?" We need to be
[1:42:05] able to see our need for the Holy Spirit
[1:42:07] based on what we see in these men. says,
[1:42:09] "And it came to pass when the time was
[1:42:11] come that he should be received up, he
[1:42:13] steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:42:14] Jerusalem and sent messengers before his
[1:42:17] face, and they went and entered into the
[1:42:18] village of the Samaritans to make ready
[1:42:20] for him." So Jesus is going to
[1:42:23] Jerusalem, but he says, "I'm going to
[1:42:24] pass through this village. Go ahead and
[1:42:26] let them know I'm there. We can have a
[1:42:27] quick meeting before I before I move
[1:42:29] on." It says, "And they did not receive
[1:42:32] him because his face was as though he
[1:42:35] would go to Jerusalem." Notice their
[1:42:37] rejection of him was because they saw
[1:42:39] he's not going to stay with us. This is
[1:42:41] just a temporary visit and he's going on
[1:42:44] to Jerusalem. Their rejection of him was
[1:42:47] based on an inferiority complex that
[1:42:49] they had that the Jews in Jerusalem were
[1:42:52] better than they were. So they turned
[1:42:54] him down because he preferred the Jews
[1:42:56] in Jerusalem over them. And yet he said,
[1:42:59] "I'm coming through this town. Let's
[1:43:00] take advantage of it. I don't want to
[1:43:02] miss an opportunity to speak to these
[1:43:03] people." But they said, "Because you're
[1:43:05] not staying with us, you're going on to
[1:43:06] those Jews up there, th those elite Jews
[1:43:09] up in Jerusalem. We're not going to
[1:43:11] listen to you." Watch the response.
[1:43:14] Now, and when his disciples, James and
[1:43:17] John, saw this, they said, "Lord, wilt
[1:43:19] thou that we command fire to come down
[1:43:21] from heaven and consume them even as
[1:43:23] Elias did?" church. Did Jesus tell them
[1:43:26] I give you
[1:43:28] power for fire from
[1:43:33] heaven? But they said, "If you tell us
[1:43:35] to do it, we'll do it." Happy to do it.
[1:43:38] We would
[1:43:41] love these people. Jesus, do you know
[1:43:44] what the Samaritans did 150 years ago?
[1:43:46] Do you remember what they did to our
[1:43:47] temple, Jesus? We would love to settle
[1:43:49] the score right now. This is the perfect
[1:43:52] opportunity to get even. Just give us
[1:43:55] the word, we'll take care of it. You
[1:43:57] don't have to bismerch your name. It'll
[1:43:59] be us, not
[1:44:00] you.
[1:44:02] Right? What is it, church? Zeal without
[1:44:06] character. And zeal without character is
[1:44:08] self-righteous and
[1:44:11] judgmental. He says, "And he turned and
[1:44:13] rebuked them and said, you know not what
[1:44:15] manner of spirit ye are of." Church,
[1:44:17] these are men that have cast out devils,
[1:44:20] healed diseases, and raised the dead.
[1:44:21] And he says, "You don't know what spirit
[1:44:23] you're of. For the Son of Man has not
[1:44:25] come to destroy men's lives, but to save
[1:44:27] them." And they went to another village.
[1:44:29] They had a spirit to cast out demons, to
[1:44:31] heal the sick, to a point, but they had
[1:44:34] zero
[1:44:35] discernment. They had zero
[1:44:38] mercy. When they were affronted, they
[1:44:40] got offended for Jesus' sake. Jesus
[1:44:43] wasn't offended. They got offended for
[1:44:46] his sake. And they're ready to kill
[1:44:48] these people because they hurt Jesus.
[1:44:50] They thought cuz they rejected him.
[1:44:53] Jesus has said, "Listen, I'm going to be
[1:44:55] rejected of all men." But they were
[1:44:58] ready to kill the Samaritans. You don't
[1:45:00] hear him saying, "Hey, Jesus, say the
[1:45:01] word and we'll kill all the Jews in
[1:45:03] Jerusalem." No, cuz that's our friends
[1:45:05] and family. But these ones, these these
[1:45:07] these mixed people, the hybrids, we'll
[1:45:10] kill them all day
[1:45:12] long. Church, what spirit were they
[1:45:15] under? They were under the spirit of the
[1:45:17] law of Moses, if we were to get honest
[1:45:18] about it.
[1:45:20] Because all the prophets before were
[1:45:22] prophets of judgment. They offer grace,
[1:45:24] but the people always turn it down. And
[1:45:26] so they're under the Old Testament and
[1:45:29] Jesus is trying to get them into the New
[1:45:31] Testament. And they're under the spirit
[1:45:33] of the Old Testament, which is always
[1:45:34] death, destruction, pain,
[1:45:39] suffering. Jesus said, "You don't even
[1:45:41] realize what influence you're under." He
[1:45:44] says, "You got all this power and you
[1:45:45] don't even know how to use it. They're
[1:45:47] like kids with a gun.
[1:45:50] Kids with a gun. The boys played airsoft
[1:45:52] yesterday and my youngest, you know, he
[1:45:55] likes he's too young to play, but he
[1:45:57] likes to to hold them. So, I was giving
[1:45:58] it to him and my wife come up the stairs
[1:46:00] and he put it right on her, right? What
[1:46:02] is it? Zeal without character, right?
[1:46:05] Cuz he wants to play. He wants to go
[1:46:06] shoot people with these fake guns. But
[1:46:09] then he aims at his mother, right? all
[1:46:12] this
[1:46:13] passion, but it was like, "No, we don't
[1:46:15] we don't aim it at somebody unless we're
[1:46:17] going to shoot them, and we don't shoot
[1:46:18] mama ever." For the record,
[1:46:22] right? Jesus is saying, "If I wasn't
[1:46:25] here to control you, this power would
[1:46:28] turn into
[1:46:30] destruction." And remember, just a few
[1:46:33] weeks later or months later, Philip goes
[1:46:35] to Samaria and these people receive
[1:46:38] Christ and they receive the baptism of
[1:46:39] the Holy Ghost. So John and James would
[1:46:43] have killed children of God for the sake
[1:46:45] of the offense that they thought they
[1:46:47] caused to Jesus. Jesus wasn't
[1:46:49] offended. He said, "I'm not here to
[1:46:51] destroy. I'm here to save. And you've
[1:46:54] got a destructive nature in you. You got
[1:46:57] a destructive nature in you that would
[1:46:59] destroy these people and they're my
[1:47:01] children." What was the problem? The
[1:47:02] problem's not the power. The problem's
[1:47:04] the
[1:47:05] vessel. Amen. The power was perfect. The
[1:47:07] vessel was imperfect. And when you have
[1:47:09] an imperfect vessel and a perfect power,
[1:47:11] unfortunately, it makes the power
[1:47:12] imperfect. And if Jesus wasn't here to
[1:47:14] curb them, to hold them, they'd have
[1:47:17] been out there just blowing everything
[1:47:19] up. Why? Because the power was coming up
[1:47:22] here, and they still had a soul issue
[1:47:24] that hadn't been
[1:47:26] resolved. Amen. That that lack of
[1:47:28] character and discernment made them
[1:47:30] prone to acting selfishly, foolishly.
[1:47:34] flaws in their lives made them prone to
[1:47:37] abuse their position and
[1:47:39] authority. Why? Because that's not the
[1:47:41] power that they needed. But it was the
[1:47:43] power that they had. They started to
[1:47:45] think, "I'm elect. I'm chosen. I'm the
[1:47:47] elite. I've made it church. Those things
[1:47:50] are not
[1:47:51] wrong." But there was a walk that had to
[1:47:53] go before this. There was a time of
[1:47:56] testing and proving. And there was an
[1:47:58] inner work that had to happen before
[1:47:59] they could truly wield this power. And
[1:48:01] we see them time and time again.
[1:48:04] saying, "I will. Let me. I will never."
[1:48:08] Right? I I I the me show the me monster.
[1:48:12] And it's all about them. I can do this.
[1:48:14] I'm going to do this. I would never do
[1:48:15] that. Jesus. And what happens time and
[1:48:17] time again? They walk
[1:48:19] forward, fall. Walk forward,
[1:48:23] fall. They just keep falling and falling
[1:48:26] and
[1:48:28] falling. They couldn't get out of their
[1:48:30] own way.
[1:48:31] I'm sure we know
[1:48:33] people that keep falling and yet they're
[1:48:38] convinced. I'm
[1:48:40] good. No, you're
[1:48:43] not. You look at their life and it's a
[1:48:46] train wreck of bad decision after bad
[1:48:48] decision, bad leadership after bad
[1:48:50] leadership, and you say, "The fruits
[1:48:52] don't show. You're
[1:48:54] good. You need a new
[1:48:56] birth. You need to humble yourself." And
[1:48:59] what you'll find with those people is is
[1:49:01] always about me and I. They talk about
[1:49:04] themselves more than they talk about
[1:49:06] Christ. And humility has never entered
[1:49:09] their
[1:49:10] doorstep. And grace and mercy haven't
[1:49:12] come with it. And so all they've got is
[1:49:15] judgmental words and critical words for
[1:49:18] everybody else. Why? Because they
[1:49:20] haven't seen the need in themselves for
[1:49:21] a change in their life. They're aware of
[1:49:24] the
[1:49:24] truth, but they haven't received the
[1:49:26] spirit of truth that'll make them live
[1:49:28] what they're talking about. And until
[1:49:30] that happens, their Christianity will
[1:49:32] continue to be self- serving. Has to. I
[1:49:35] saw a video of a man that said,
[1:49:36] "Christianity is a lie." And I think I
[1:49:38] got the number right. He said, "I" He
[1:49:40] says, "I God never answered a prayer of
[1:49:43] mine for 17
[1:49:45] years." Why? Because he was in it to
[1:49:49] make God his servant rather than to
[1:49:51] serve God. He became a Christian because
[1:49:54] somebody told him God answers
[1:49:57] prayers. There was no
[1:50:00] repentance. There was no, "I'm going to
[1:50:02] give my life away." It was, "I'm going
[1:50:04] to go in and I'm going to have somebody
[1:50:06] that's going to give me everything I
[1:50:08] want." And guess what God said?
[1:50:12] Nope. Cuz God's not a sugar daddy. But
[1:50:15] this guy, somebody told him he was.
[1:50:17] Amen. He wanted a servant, but he didn't
[1:50:19] want to be a servant. He wanted to
[1:50:21] receive but not give. He wanted to win
[1:50:22] but never go through the battle. He
[1:50:25] wanted everything handed to him on a
[1:50:26] platter. Amen. He wanted to gain
[1:50:28] everything and lose nothing. Amen. He
[1:50:31] didn't come with repentance. He came
[1:50:32] with entitlement. That ain't going to
[1:50:34] work. It takes a dying out. It takes a
[1:50:37] surrender. And God never recognized a
[1:50:39] single prayer he made. Never even heard
[1:50:41] it. Didn't even come before him because
[1:50:44] he never came through Christ. He came
[1:50:47] through his own selfish needs.
[1:50:49] You look at Peter, the ignorant
[1:50:52] fisherman, the man with the keys to the
[1:50:55] kingdom, and he was a loose cannon all
[1:50:58] his
[1:50:59] life. One day he hits the mark
[1:51:01] perfectly, and the next Jesus is saying,
[1:51:03] "Get thee behind me,
[1:51:05] Satan. One minute he's standing up and
[1:51:08] the next he's denying Christ three
[1:51:11] times. Up and down, in and out." And yet
[1:51:14] he's got power to raise the dead, heal
[1:51:15] the sick, and cast out demons.
[1:51:19] He'd only go so far and then he'd get in
[1:51:22] his own way and he'd fall flat on his
[1:51:25] face.
[1:51:27] Why? Not enough
[1:51:29] power. He had power for everyone else
[1:51:31] and nothing for
[1:51:35] himself. He tried to run the church
[1:51:37] before he got a true new birth. We see
[1:51:39] him on the just before the day of
[1:51:41] Pentecost and he's up there and he's
[1:51:42] saying, "Hey, we've lost Judas and the
[1:51:44] word says that somebody else has to take
[1:51:45] Judas
[1:51:47] place. So guys, let's pick our
[1:51:50] man." What was it? He was exercising
[1:51:53] authority before he was given true power
[1:51:54] to do
[1:51:56] it. In his own
[1:51:59] capacity, all he could do was start
[1:52:01] another
[1:52:02] denomination. Men's ideas, men's
[1:52:05] leadership, men's picking.
[1:52:07] God never pic God never told Peter to go
[1:52:09] up there and pick another
[1:52:12] disciple. You know what God told Peter
[1:52:14] to do? Sit still and shut
[1:52:17] up. He said, "Don't preach. Don't open
[1:52:20] your mouth. Don't try until you've
[1:52:23] received power." And Peter said, "While
[1:52:25] we're here, while we got this time,
[1:52:26] let's do something in the church." Jesus
[1:52:28] said, "Stay and wait and don't open your
[1:52:32] mouth until you get power. And once you
[1:52:34] got power, then you can move." Peter,
[1:52:36] why? because he knew that without that
[1:52:38] power, they'd make a mistake. And guess
[1:52:40] what? Poor Matias was a mistake. A
[1:52:44] burden put on him that he was not built
[1:52:46] for, he was not called for, he was not
[1:52:49] anointed for. And Peter's mistake put
[1:52:51] him in the spotlight. And we never hear
[1:52:52] a thing about Matias after that cuz God
[1:52:55] never called him. It wasn't God's
[1:53:00] plan. What they needed, not power, but
[1:53:04] they needed to know what to do with it.
[1:53:06] They needed what? To know what God
[1:53:08] wanted done. That only comes through the
[1:53:10] spirit of
[1:53:11] truth. Comes through the spirit of
[1:53:12] truth. He says, "I'll lead you into all
[1:53:14] truth. I'll show you what I want done.
[1:53:16] I'll show you things that are to come so
[1:53:18] you can do it so you're ready for it so
[1:53:20] you know what's coming." And somebody
[1:53:22] say, "Brother John, can you can you
[1:53:23] preach on what's going on in current
[1:53:24] events?" I said, "Everyone else is doing
[1:53:26] it so glad so well. I don't know why I
[1:53:27] should do it." Just point you to them,
[1:53:29] you know, but maybe I need to do that to
[1:53:30] show us where we are in time. We've had
[1:53:33] a spirit of truth that's come and told
[1:53:35] us what's coming. I was talking to my
[1:53:37] father this week and and I said uh I
[1:53:40] said, you know, we've got an American
[1:53:41] pope now. I said, 'D did you know that
[1:53:42] that brother Brandon prophesied that? He
[1:53:44] said, no. I said, yeah, he did. And it's
[1:53:46] not good that's coming after this.
[1:53:50] Oh, why? He knows the
[1:53:53] truth. And we are this close, aren't we?
[1:53:57] We're we're we're not one minute to
[1:53:58] midnight, church. 4 seconds to midnight
[1:54:01] before the clock ticks and we're gone.
[1:54:04] It's not a time to mess
[1:54:08] around. They need the spirit of truth
[1:54:10] because up until that point as a church
[1:54:13] member, Paul said, "We're still under a
[1:54:16] spirit of
[1:54:18] disobedience." That's our natural
[1:54:20] spirit. It's a spirit of disobedience.
[1:54:23] Church, good intentions can still be
[1:54:26] disobedient.
[1:54:28] Peter had all the best intentions in the
[1:54:29] upper room, but he was still disobedient
[1:54:32] to the will and purpose of God. As much
[1:54:34] power as they had, as great as
[1:54:35] experiences they had, they were not born
[1:54:37] again by the spirit of God. And meant
[1:54:39] that meant they were subject to failure
[1:54:41] over and over
[1:54:44] again. What's the new birth do, church?
[1:54:47] Gets us out of the way. That's what it's
[1:54:49] meant to do. It's meant to get us out of
[1:54:51] the way. They wanted victory. See, we
[1:54:53] all want power over that.
[1:54:57] But they needed power over
[1:55:00] this. It would be so nice if on the road
[1:55:04] I can make everybody drive the way I
[1:55:06] want them to
[1:55:07] drive, but I can't do that. And the
[1:55:10] spirit of God is not given to me to
[1:55:12] force them to comply with my rules and
[1:55:14] regulations and expectations on the
[1:55:16] road. So, he's got to do a work in me to
[1:55:19] help me deal with the
[1:55:21] situations rather than call down fire
[1:55:24] from heaven and consume them even as
[1:55:26] Elisha did. Because that's what we feel
[1:55:28] like sometimes, isn't it, Big John? Call
[1:55:30] down fire from heaven on people on the
[1:55:33] road
[1:55:37] especially. I can't change every
[1:55:39] situation. I'm not meant to change every
[1:55:42] situation, but I'm meant to go through
[1:55:44] it with grace and the character of
[1:55:47] Christ to reflect his willingness to
[1:55:50] endure through suffering and pain hard
[1:55:53] times and not lose my Christian
[1:55:56] testimony. Uh hopefully Nate doesn't
[1:55:58] mind me talking about this. We were
[1:55:59] talking about uh playing ice hockey
[1:56:01] yesterday at Brother Marks and you know
[1:56:03] the joke was that when we go out on the
[1:56:04] ice then our testimony stay on the
[1:56:07] bench. But that's the way it is. We all
[1:56:09] have those things. We may not play ice
[1:56:11] hockey, but some of us have other areas
[1:56:14] where what our Christian testimony can
[1:56:15] sometimes get left
[1:56:18] behind. We need to hold us through all
[1:56:20] these
[1:56:23] things because we all have it. We all do
[1:56:26] it. Peter had it. And Peter's problem
[1:56:29] was that he thought he could do it.
[1:56:32] That's all. Peter couldn't do it. I
[1:56:35] can't do it. You can't do it. And some
[1:56:37] of us just take a little longer to get
[1:56:39] to realizing that. That's all. But
[1:56:42] you'll get there. You'll get there. I'll
[1:56:44] get there. We'll all get there. But you
[1:56:46] know what I
[1:56:47] love? I preached a somewhat negative
[1:56:50] sermon. I understand that here. But you
[1:56:52] know what I
[1:56:53] love? All of this didn't stop God for a
[1:56:59] second. It didn't stop Joel
[1:57:01] 2:28. Didn't stop Ezekiel 36. I'll give
[1:57:04] you a new heart and a new spirit and
[1:57:05] I'll place my spirit within you. None of
[1:57:07] the flaws and failures and trips and
[1:57:10] falls, none of the silliness, none of
[1:57:13] the immaturity stopped God. Not a single
[1:57:16] thing stopped God from coming down on
[1:57:18] the 50th day and filling them with the
[1:57:20] spirit of God. Amen.
[1:57:23] Listen, our genetics, our family
[1:57:25] traditions, our our our our church
[1:57:27] traditions, our our our our hardships,
[1:57:30] our our offenses, our hurts, our
[1:57:32] failures, our grand schemes, ideas,
[1:57:34] ambitions. None of it's going to stop
[1:57:36] God from doing what he said he was going
[1:57:37] to do. That's what I want to end on this
[1:57:40] morning. It doesn't matter where we are,
[1:57:42] what we've
[1:57:43] done, how flawed we
[1:57:46] are. Nothing's going to stop him because
[1:57:48] it's not based on me. It's based on him.
[1:57:52] But the problem is, as long as I think
[1:57:54] I'm holding him
[1:57:56] up. I keep trying to do it. I keep
[1:57:59] trying to fix it. Peter couldn't fix
[1:58:03] himself. I can't fix me, much less you.
[1:58:07] It takes the power of Almighty God to
[1:58:10] take this vessel and make it fit for his
[1:58:12] service.
[1:58:15] He's got to take the clay and he's got
[1:58:17] to smash it up and he's got to remold it
[1:58:20] in his perfect
[1:58:22] will. And that's when we can stop
[1:58:25] tripping over our own selves day by
[1:58:28] day. He said, "I love the Lord because
[1:58:30] he's so merciful when we're so
[1:58:32] undeserving and yet he is so merciful."
[1:58:35] He says, "That's been one of the marvels
[1:58:36] of my life and my experience has been to
[1:58:38] see when we were so unworthy and yet he
[1:58:41] visits us anyhow and it just rides over
[1:58:44] the top of our unworthiness and gives us
[1:58:47] his blessings anyhow."
[1:58:50] Hallelujah. How unworthy do we feel so
[1:58:53] many times, church? And what is it?
[1:58:55] Grace flows
[1:58:57] in and again and again. You say, "I'm
[1:59:00] past grace." And another wave of grace
[1:59:02] hits you and you say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:05] I'm not
[1:59:05] worthy. But we've got to realize we're
[1:59:08] not
[1:59:08] worthy. We can't turn that grace into
[1:59:12] disgrace. But when you say and you
[1:59:14] realize, Lord, I'm unworthy and yet your
[1:59:16] grace holds me. Your mercies are new
[1:59:19] every single
[1:59:23] morning. We fail every single
[1:59:27] day. We do.
[1:59:32] That's this
[1:59:34] flesh. But we've got a soul that's been
[1:59:37] perfected by Almighty God. And it's
[1:59:40] sealed to the day of our
[1:59:42] redemption. I appreciate what Sister
[1:59:44] Priscilla said before her her special
[1:59:47] because we're not looking at this
[1:59:49] flesh. This mind, it has to be brought
[1:59:52] into the mind of Christ. This body is
[1:59:54] meant to be subject to the spirit of God
[1:59:56] inside of us. That's all healing is,
[1:59:59] brothers and sisters, is when your body
[2:00:01] obeys the power of God inside of you.
[2:00:03] That's all it
[2:00:04] is. But we've got to see the
[2:00:07] imperfections of this vessel will not
[2:00:09] stop
[2:00:10] him. And if we'll just give it over to
[2:00:13] him, he'll do wonderful things with it.
[2:00:17] Amen. Peter, the the disciples, they
[2:00:20] failed and they fell all the way to
[2:00:25] Pentecost. And
[2:00:27] yet on the 50th day, God moved.
[2:00:33] Anyhow, see, if I was Peter's
[2:00:35] dad, I said, "Look at this guy. I mean,
[2:00:39] I've risen from the dead. I've told him
[2:00:40] what's coming. I've told him what to do,
[2:00:42] and he's still up there causing
[2:00:45] problems." And God says, "Doesn't matter
[2:00:47] a
[2:00:49] bit. I got Paul waiting in the wings.
[2:00:52] The fact that they chose the 12th will
[2:00:54] not stop me from choosing the true
[2:00:56] 12th. And when Peter, when I'm done with
[2:00:59] Peter, if we give him just one more
[2:01:01] day, it'll take care of
[2:01:03] everything. And you'll see that after
[2:01:05] this, Peter doesn't flip and flop. He
[2:01:08] doesn't fall and trip. He knows where to
[2:01:11] give the credit. He's humble. He's
[2:01:13] obedient. He's surrendered even to death
[2:01:17] because he finally got the power that
[2:01:18] would change him instead of changing
[2:01:20] everybody else.
[2:01:22] One quote as we close. He says, "What
[2:01:23] can you give?" God will receive what
[2:01:26] you'll give. But God wants all of you.
[2:01:29] He wants every bit of you. He wants all.
[2:01:31] He wants everything you are. He wants
[2:01:33] your life. He wants your testimony. He
[2:01:35] wants every minute you live. He wants
[2:01:36] you to live right, act right, talk
[2:01:38] right, do right, do right. He wants
[2:01:40] everything perfectly surrendered to him.
[2:01:43] Why? that he can lead you and guide you
[2:01:47] and put you into places where he wants
[2:01:50] you to go. He says you'll be led of the
[2:01:53] spirit. Amen. We'll pick that up on next
[2:01:56] Sunday, Lord willing. God bless you.
[2:01:57] Let's stand together if we
[2:01:59] would. Amen. I am so
[2:02:02] thankful. I've always said that the the
[2:02:06] day the service that I gave my heart to
[2:02:08] the Lord, it took 45 minutes for me to
[2:02:10] go through that prayer line to get up to
[2:02:12] where the ministers
[2:02:14] were and I just cried the entire time
[2:02:17] because in that presence, in that
[2:02:20] atmosphere, I saw every flaw that I
[2:02:24] had. I saw every failure. I saw every
[2:02:27] arrogance, every bit of
[2:02:31] pride so
[2:02:34] clearly and I cried because in spite of
[2:02:38] that he was calling me by
[2:02:40] name. That was mercy and grace. That was
[2:02:43] mercy and grace. And when I gave my
[2:02:46] heart to him and was baptized and filled
[2:02:48] with the
[2:02:49] spirit, everything became new.
[2:02:52] Now, it didn't mean I wasn't flawed, but
[2:02:55] it meant that he had accepted me despite
[2:02:57] those flaws. And he started working to
[2:03:00] take those flaws out. And he even uses
[2:03:02] some of them for other people's benefits
[2:03:05] now. And he takes you and he molds you
[2:03:07] and he shapes you into something that he
[2:03:10] can work
[2:03:11] with. And all he's wanting you to do is
[2:03:13] say, "I surrender. I give
[2:03:16] up. I'm going to stop trying and I'm
[2:03:19] going to start yielding." And that's
[2:03:21] when God can actually really get a hold
[2:03:22] of us and use us for his glory. Amen.
[2:03:25] That's when we can experience that
[2:03:27] absolute power that we're talking about.
[2:03:29] We'll go into that on Sunday morning,
[2:03:31] Lord willing. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[2:03:33] Heavenly
[2:03:34] Father, Lord, what a comfort it is to
[2:03:37] know that Lord, you're not relying on me
[2:03:39] or these people to be the absolute.
[2:03:42] You're not relying on us for power or
[2:03:44] wisdom or strength.
[2:03:47] Lord, you're not relying us on for
[2:03:49] experience or skill. Lord, all you're
[2:03:52] asking us to do is surrender. You're
[2:03:54] just asking us to humble ourselves to
[2:03:56] you, to your word, Lord, to let your
[2:03:59] spirit have control of our lives. So,
[2:04:02] Lord, I'm thankful. Lord, I'm thankful
[2:04:05] that you can use this flawed vessel,
[2:04:06] Lord, that you've taken these people,
[2:04:08] Lord, as broken as we are so many times,
[2:04:11] Lord, and you can use us for your glory.
[2:04:14] Lord, I pray you give us testimony day
[2:04:15] by day of your goodness. Lord, that we
[2:04:18] would look to the things of God, that we
[2:04:19] would just dwell in them, that we would
[2:04:21] bathe ourselves in them, saturate them,
[2:04:23] Lord, in the good things of God, that we
[2:04:25] could see your will and your purpose,
[2:04:27] Lord. That as we walk through our daily
[2:04:29] lives, Lord, we could look to you
[2:04:31] constantly and say, "He's with me. He
[2:04:34] knows me. He's accepted me. He's
[2:04:37] dwelling in me, and he wants to do
[2:04:39] something with my life." Lord, grant us
[2:04:41] grace to trust you more. Lord, grant us
[2:04:44] grace to surrender more. Grant us grace
[2:04:46] to give you every part of our life,
[2:04:48] heavenly father. Lord, that as we commit
[2:04:50] it to you, Lord, that you would use it
[2:04:52] for your glory and benefit of all. We
[2:04:54] pray. Grant us grace, Lord, to let go.
[2:04:56] We ask in Jesus Christ's name we're
[2:04:59] praying it.
[2:05:04] Amen. Create in me a clean heart. 150.
[2:05:13] Create in me a
[2:05:17] clean
[2:05:21] heart,
[2:05:23] oh
[2:05:27] God, and renew a right
[2:05:31] spirit
[2:05:33] within me.
[2:05:40] Oh,
[2:05:41] createth
[2:05:42] me a
[2:05:45] clean
[2:05:48] heart.
[2:05:50] Oh
[2:05:54] God, and renew a right
[2:05:59] spirit
[2:06:00] within me.
[2:06:08] and cast me not
[2:06:12] away from thy
[2:06:17] presence, oh
[2:06:21] Lord, and take not thy
[2:06:26] holy spirit from
[2:06:30] me.
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:36] Restore
[2:06:38] unto
[2:06:41] me the joy of thy
[2:06:49] salvation and renew a right
[2:06:54] spirit
