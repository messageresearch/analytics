[50:17] gospel
[50:18] john chapter 8
[50:22] amen praise the lord
[50:24] amen
[50:27] amen praise the lord
[50:30] hallelujah john chapter 8
[50:33] and we're going to read from verse 42.
[50:39] amen john chapter 8 verse 42
[50:46] and jesus said unto them
[50:50] if god were your
[50:52] father ye would have you would love me
[50:57] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[51:00] neither came i from myself
[51:04] but he
[51:05] sent me
[51:07] why
[51:08] do ye not
[51:10] understand
[51:11] my speech
[51:14] even
[51:16] because he cannot hear my word
[51:19] amen
[51:21] ye are of your father the devil
[51:24] and the lusts of your father he will do
[51:28] he was a murderer from the beginning
[51:32] and abode not in the truth
[51:35] because there is no truth in him
[51:38] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[51:41] his own
[51:43] for he is a liar
[51:46] and the father of it
[51:49] and because i tell you the truth ye
[51:52] believe me not
[51:56] which of you conceiveth me of sin
[51:59] and if i see the truth why do ye not
[52:02] believe me
[52:04] he
[52:05] that is of god heareth god's words
[52:09] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[52:12] are not
[52:13] of
[52:14] god
[52:16] lord bless the reading of his word
[52:18] we can have our seats
[52:22] amen now you're all wondering what
[52:24] brother steve what exactly are you going
[52:26] to preach today
[52:27] [Laughter]
[52:29] praise the name of the lord in matthew
[52:32] chapter 11 verse 15 it says he that hath
[52:36] an ear
[52:37] let him hear
[52:40] now friends today i know we're sitting
[52:42] together and we have uh hearing and we
[52:44] can hear god's voice
[52:47] but i want to i want to speak to you
[52:49] around the thought the king's speech
[52:52] the king speech
[52:54] now as i prayed earlier i want you to
[52:57] put on a spiritual mind this evening and
[53:00] i desire that you take the word of god
[53:02] and place it in your life personally
[53:06] i don't want it just to be words i want
[53:08] it to be words that can be applied to
[53:10] our very individual lives and and so the
[53:13] word of god it is the king's speech to
[53:16] you and i
[53:17] you know god has got a language can you
[53:20] say amen
[53:21] and the bible is written in a code it's
[53:24] written in a language
[53:26] and as you study the scriptures you
[53:27] begin to realize it has symbols
[53:30] and it has numbers and there's parables
[53:33] jesus talks many parables
[53:36] but we realize very quickly that there's
[53:39] only one way that we can understand
[53:42] the scriptures or we can have faith to
[53:44] believe the scriptures
[53:46] and that has to be by the decoding of
[53:48] the holy spirit in our lives can you say
[53:51] amen
[53:52] with all without the holy spirit in our
[53:54] lives we can study it
[53:57] many great men before us have studied
[53:59] theologians in fact
[54:01] the bible is the number one seller on
[54:04] the market this is a book to read
[54:06] there are many commentaries and and
[54:09] there's many men that are standing
[54:11] before people even this evening and
[54:13] they're declaring a gospel but it the
[54:16] word of god can only be revealed to
[54:18] those that have his own nature his own
[54:22] spirit his own likeness
[54:24] and so today in this hour we are a
[54:26] privileged people
[54:28] and i want you to look at one another
[54:29] because sometimes we get calming to one
[54:31] another i want you to notice to one
[54:33] another you are a prize you are the
[54:37] botan uh prize the one that has been
[54:39] bought by the blood of jesus christ
[54:43] so never neglect one another or treat
[54:45] not one another blindly because the life
[54:48] of jesus christ is on the inside of each
[54:51] and every one of you
[54:53] and it takes that life that is inside us
[54:55] being able to study the word of god to
[54:58] begin to read it and understand it
[55:00] you remember in the scriptures there
[55:03] there was uh you know there's peter and
[55:04] the disciples around jesus and and they
[55:07] begin to to to uh talk with jesus and
[55:10] finally jesus said to him who do men say
[55:14] that i am
[55:15] now that's a question that i believe
[55:17] that jesus is asking every single one of
[55:19] us
[55:20] who do you say that i am
[55:23] and you know many had interpretations of
[55:25] who jesus was
[55:27] some said he was elias and they begin to
[55:29] talk about other prophets and the
[55:30] different things that was declared but
[55:33] peter he begot under inspiration and
[55:36] remember it was not peter's inspiration
[55:39] it was a special anointing friends it
[55:42] was something that burnt within his
[55:43] bosom and he said these words thou art
[55:46] the christ the son of the living gods
[55:49] now those were words and the disciples
[55:51] around me and over with peter they said
[55:52] whoa that those are strong words but the
[55:55] lord jesus said flesh and blood has not
[55:57] revealed this to you but your father
[56:00] which is in heaven and this evening it
[56:02] has got to be our father who is in
[56:04] heaven we we give him that name our
[56:06] father who is in heaven who begins to
[56:09] reveal to us the scriptural truths
[56:12] begins to show us now the words that
[56:13] brother branham preached to us would be
[56:16] just letters on a page from a fellow
[56:18] from kentucky if the word of god would
[56:20] not have shown us the truth for the hour
[56:23] if the lord had not you know showed us
[56:26] that it was the very word of revelations
[56:29] chapter 1 that one that stood there and
[56:32] gave the word to us who was that christ
[56:34] jesus
[56:35] and so the symbols and and the things
[56:37] that we read in the scriptures we we
[56:39] study them not with human understanding
[56:42] we study them with supernatural
[56:45] understanding
[56:47] when you're reading the message it is as
[56:50] by supernatural understanding you begin
[56:53] to see your place in the scriptures
[56:56] brother brano brought us a message so
[56:58] that we could see our place in the
[57:00] scriptures and when we read it it's not
[57:03] a textbook it's not something we put to
[57:05] memory you know it's good to do memory
[57:07] verses but it's not just something that
[57:09] we do in memory so that we can be like
[57:11] others and spout off interesting truths
[57:13] know it's something we put to our heart
[57:16] and we begin to live by
[57:18] it's not something we just analyze
[57:20] people like to analyze but not message
[57:22] believers not those that are born by the
[57:24] spirit of god they don't sit to analyze
[57:26] they put it to work in their lives
[57:29] precept upon priests line upon line they
[57:32] begin to live this gospel
[57:35] what good is this gospel what good would
[57:37] all of god done for us if we cannot live
[57:40] out what we've been hearing what we've
[57:42] been listening to when we're in our jobs
[57:44] and we're in the markets and and we're
[57:46] in the schools what good would all of
[57:48] god ever done for us if we're not living
[57:51] out what he set forth
[57:53] and so friends today i i just want to
[57:56] catch just a a
[57:58] a a word or a thought i want to catch
[58:01] the thoughts of god behind the words
[58:06] in the message approach to god in 1955
[58:09] brother branham says this amen i i've
[58:11] enjoyed preaching tonight yesterday i
[58:13] was i was stranger today i'm a friend
[58:16] and praise the lord i've enjoyed myself
[58:19] tonight he says this so just
[58:21] polishing
[58:23] and joining church
[58:25] and reading a whole lot and knowing a
[58:27] lot of books and authors and so forth
[58:30] doesn't mean you're converted
[58:35] just because you sleep in the garage
[58:37] doesn't mean you're a car
[58:40] and just because you come to church
[58:42] and you sit here and you listen to
[58:44] brothers talk doesn't mean that you're a
[58:45] christian
[58:47] and reading again brother brahma says
[58:48] because you have an intellectual mind
[58:50] that makes you have a mental conception
[58:54] that there is a god somewhere still
[58:57] you're not a christian yet
[58:59] until actually you become
[59:02] personal in contact with christ
[59:06] do you see how important it is we need
[59:08] to have that personal contact with
[59:10] christ that changes your heart and
[59:14] nature
[59:15] then you become a child of god the all
[59:18] things has passed away and all things
[59:21] become new again
[59:25] hallelujah with that spirit the nature
[59:27] of christ inside of us we need friends
[59:30] the holy spirit
[59:32] more than ever in this hour if you don't
[59:34] got it you've got to get it
[59:36] amen we were talking this morning about
[59:39] coming you know through justification
[59:41] getting clean all up and through
[59:42] sanctification and getting all washed
[59:44] and filled you know all clean like a
[59:46] bird and a bird bath but friends you've
[59:48] got to come all the way in christ and
[59:51] receive the free gift of the holy spirit
[59:54] in your life it's because the holy
[59:56] spirit is what quickens
[59:59] if the same spirit
[1:00:01] that you dwelt in jesus christ it caused
[1:00:04] him to rise from the dead it must dwell
[1:00:06] in you the same way
[1:00:08] in order for us to have the quickening
[1:00:11] life and and have that rapture in our
[1:00:13] life
[1:00:14] in the message hear ye him
[1:00:17] brother branham says this
[1:00:19] so what we need today is an inspiration
[1:00:23] over us amen god sweeping down with a
[1:00:28] new inspiration and breathing over us
[1:00:31] his power
[1:00:32] and his love and himself
[1:00:35] that is it might inspire us to quicken
[1:00:38] us and awaken us to his word
[1:00:43] i'm praying tonight for an awakening in
[1:00:45] our hearts
[1:00:46] i don't want to stay the same from it
[1:00:48] from the pulpit to the last piercing in
[1:00:50] the pew i don't want to stay the same
[1:00:53] i want to leave here quicken i want to
[1:00:56] leave here as brother brahman says
[1:00:57] awakened by his word and then the word
[1:01:00] begins
[1:01:02] begin brought into the spirit of
[1:01:04] inspiration then you'll see miracles
[1:01:06] happen
[1:01:07] but it takes the quickening power the
[1:01:10] revelation of the word to bring about
[1:01:12] that miracle
[1:01:14] and the things take place because the
[1:01:16] two becomes together
[1:01:19] so father i pray oh god that our hearts
[1:01:22] might be inspired today quick and
[1:01:25] made anew made alive in christ jesus
[1:01:28] this very evening
[1:01:31] in our text we were reading and jesus is
[1:01:33] speaking here
[1:01:35] and i want you to notice what jesus is
[1:01:36] speaking it's bringing a lot of
[1:01:38] controversy
[1:01:40] he's standing amongst a lot of a real
[1:01:42] religious peaceful the scribes and the
[1:01:44] pharisees many are sitting together
[1:01:47] and you know in a meeting brother
[1:01:48] branham tells us there's three types of
[1:01:50] believers
[1:01:52] and you know oftentimes we look around
[1:01:54] and we're we're
[1:01:55] you know a smaller group today but but
[1:01:58] you know some there is a true believer
[1:01:59] and i want to focus on the believer
[1:02:02] i don't want to give so much time to the
[1:02:04] make believer and the underbeliever no i
[1:02:06] want to talk to you those that are
[1:02:08] believers and so we say how many
[1:02:09] believers are here tonight we all shout
[1:02:11] amen
[1:02:12] but with jesus he was speaking friends
[1:02:15] there was three types of believers there
[1:02:17] and and i want you to notice the words
[1:02:19] that he was speaking were very
[1:02:21] controversy many would say
[1:02:24] jesus
[1:02:25] you're not being very nice
[1:02:28] well he just told them if you're not
[1:02:29] hearing my words you're not of me
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:33] right he just he just told them you're
[1:02:35] of your father the devil
[1:02:38] now you know something that's a little
[1:02:39] that strikes a little hard right
[1:02:42] if the preacher get up here and say if
[1:02:43] you know an inspiration to say if you're
[1:02:45] not listening to the word that i'm
[1:02:47] speaking tonight you're of the devil
[1:02:48] we'd all say are you crazy man
[1:02:51] right well i want you to notice jesus
[1:02:53] didn't bring a very good reputation with
[1:02:55] him
[1:02:56] people didn't look at him they thought
[1:02:58] well maybe he had some you know we heard
[1:03:00] moses said there would be a prophet like
[1:03:01] unto him and but they didn't quite see
[1:03:04] him as the prophet
[1:03:05] there was 12 that walked with him and
[1:03:08] saw what he was doing and and seen the
[1:03:10] messiah signs and and they said you know
[1:03:12] like peter said well our father taught
[1:03:14] us this and we wouldn't see a messiah
[1:03:16] and there's different ones that rallied
[1:03:18] around and and jesus there was many
[1:03:20] coming to him and then he said you know
[1:03:22] accept a man eat and drink eat my flesh
[1:03:24] and drink my blood and all of a sudden
[1:03:27] they begin to leave them
[1:03:28] why because it was controversial words
[1:03:30] they misunderstood what he had to say
[1:03:34] and then in this same time in the same
[1:03:36] hour there has been many that has
[1:03:38] misunderstood
[1:03:40] and have left the word for their day on
[1:03:43] on on being offended
[1:03:45] and i say friends let's not allow the
[1:03:48] word to offend us
[1:03:51] okay
[1:03:52] you know when the word is spoken and
[1:03:54] it's especially spoken from the from the
[1:03:56] the podium
[1:03:58] if it's christ speaking through a man
[1:04:00] and you know it's the word of god let's
[1:04:03] not be offended
[1:04:04] let's take that word and eat that word
[1:04:07] oh it sometimes it puts stripes on our
[1:04:09] backs and it makes us not feel so good
[1:04:12] and we feel like saying oh woe is me but
[1:04:14] you know something in the pew bow your
[1:04:16] head and say lord be it unto me
[1:04:18] according to your word
[1:04:20] that man doesn't want to hurt me that
[1:04:22] man has no desire to put stripes upon my
[1:04:25] back i know this platform is not a
[1:04:27] whipping post but your word has come to
[1:04:29] me it is it is positive truth to me it's
[1:04:32] something to me and i want to take it
[1:04:33] lord
[1:04:34] with that attitude god can change us
[1:04:37] but these people they looked at this and
[1:04:39] this was this was this word was
[1:04:41] controversy and it wasn't very nice and
[1:04:44] they would say jesus i i don't like your
[1:04:46] tone of voice
[1:04:48] and and jesus used these words he said
[1:04:51] now i want you to notice this word this
[1:04:52] little
[1:04:53] two two letter word if
[1:04:55] he says it with rebuke he says if
[1:04:58] god was your father
[1:05:00] you would love me
[1:05:02] now now you listen to that and you think
[1:05:05] to yourself if
[1:05:06] if you would if you it's a very much of
[1:05:09] an argument of statement if
[1:05:11] you know i'm going to give you a little
[1:05:12] illustration you know
[1:05:15] uh when i when i was growing up in and
[1:05:17] my dad is a seasoned man of the gospel
[1:05:19] and we worked together and
[1:05:21] you know as i was
[1:05:22] as i was growing in in the ministry and
[1:05:26] you know you you don't you don't you
[1:05:28] don't grow in the ministry with the
[1:05:30] talents all of a sudden to preach okay
[1:05:32] hey and so you develop a thought and
[1:05:35] you're studying it and you you think you
[1:05:36] got something really good and i was
[1:05:38] smart enough to you know to run it past
[1:05:40] my dad before i got in the pulpit you
[1:05:42] know i knew that hey you know something
[1:05:45] that i better run with this but not run
[1:05:47] too far and so i get there and i get in
[1:05:49] his office and
[1:05:51] and uh he would talk with me and i would
[1:05:53] share my heart and i would preach my
[1:05:55] thought to him and tell him what i
[1:05:56] thought what it was all about and
[1:05:59] you know sometimes we didn't always
[1:06:00] agree
[1:06:01] and he used to use these words well son
[1:06:04] if you read the message
[1:06:09] you know that you'll be way off balance
[1:06:12] if you read your bible properly if those
[1:06:15] words and you know something i'm telling
[1:06:16] you as a human being when he said if it
[1:06:19] brought anger
[1:06:21] it brought that feeling was an argument
[1:06:23] of statement if what do you mean if i
[1:06:25] read the message
[1:06:26] i study the message like you do but you
[1:06:28] know something humbleness of hearts a
[1:06:30] change of attitude begins to realize
[1:06:33] that you know what if we were in the
[1:06:35] truth
[1:06:36] if we would abide in his word then the
[1:06:39] revelation of his word will come to us
[1:06:41] and jesus is saying here and i'll get to
[1:06:44] in just a moment i'm speeding ahead but
[1:06:46] he's telling them something specifically
[1:06:48] if you would understand me if you would
[1:06:51] hear my words then you would be of my
[1:06:53] father
[1:06:58] so he says his why why why don't you
[1:07:01] understand my speech
[1:07:03] and jesus then he says with answers his
[1:07:05] own question he says because
[1:07:07] you cannot hear my word
[1:07:11] now remember we read in our to one of
[1:07:12] our text readings he that hath an ear
[1:07:15] let him hear
[1:07:16] and so to be a child of god to
[1:07:18] understand the king's speech
[1:07:20] we have to be able to hear the word of
[1:07:23] god and why can some people not hear
[1:07:26] because they're not listening to a
[1:07:28] certain sound they're listening to
[1:07:29] another voice
[1:07:31] you've got to be careful what voice
[1:07:34] you're listening to amen
[1:07:37] you've got to be able to hear the word
[1:07:38] of god now if you're not hearing the
[1:07:40] word of god then you're listening to
[1:07:42] another voice and there's only two
[1:07:43] voices
[1:07:45] it's either god's voice is our satan's
[1:07:47] voice
[1:07:48] and remember this is satan's eating and
[1:07:50] he's trying to pump his voice through
[1:07:53] loudspeakers okay he's trying to get it
[1:07:55] out and we're talking about
[1:07:56] advertisement today he's trying to
[1:07:59] advertise his gospel
[1:08:02] and you know there are distractions out
[1:08:04] there for all of us
[1:08:06] what in the world are we taking in in
[1:08:09] our daily lives he's got his billboards
[1:08:12] they're distracting us with his words
[1:08:14] when god is calling and wooing us
[1:08:16] carefully
[1:08:18] come unto me amen all ye that are weak
[1:08:20] and heavy lady i'll give you rest where
[1:08:22] is the rest the rest is in the holy
[1:08:24] spirit it's not in a sabbath day it's in
[1:08:27] christ jesus who is the lord of the
[1:08:30] sabbath
[1:08:33] and so what is he saying
[1:08:35] jesus says why
[1:08:37] can you not catch my thoughts
[1:08:40] and why can't you hear my voice the
[1:08:43] reason why you cannot catch my thoughts
[1:08:46] or hear my voice is because you're not
[1:08:48] of god
[1:08:50] now that's pretty dreary it sounds
[1:08:52] pretty hopeless does it not
[1:08:54] but i want to flip the coin because
[1:08:55] every coin has got two sides
[1:08:57] and i want to speak to you today there's
[1:08:59] an opposite of this if you can hear you
[1:09:02] can hear the voice of god and i believe
[1:09:04] today we are hearing the voice of god
[1:09:07] amen we're not of our father the devil
[1:09:11] that he is not my father
[1:09:13] i've got a father that is wisdom and
[1:09:16] truth
[1:09:17] amen i don't have a father he spends his
[1:09:19] own lives and we can read it through
[1:09:21] scripture and we can look exactly what
[1:09:22] he's done satan is not my father
[1:09:26] i am born by the spirit of god
[1:09:29] we are washed by the blood and we have
[1:09:31] ears to hear sometimes though we got to
[1:09:34] pull the cauliflower out of our ears
[1:09:36] sometimes we've stuffed it with our own
[1:09:38] thoughts and our own understandings and
[1:09:40] our own feelings we go by feelings
[1:09:42] rather than going by the word of god and
[1:09:44] we go by our own interpretations and
[1:09:46] you'll hear in just a moment god
[1:09:48] interprets his own words
[1:09:50] so let's not you know let's not focus on
[1:09:52] these five senses or or
[1:09:55] our our channels within our spirit but
[1:09:56] let's listen to the one that's in the
[1:09:58] control tower
[1:10:00] and that's god our heavenly father
[1:10:03] so jesus is saying if you are seed
[1:10:07] you cannot help
[1:10:09] but hear the thoughts of god
[1:10:12] it's his thoughts they're not your
[1:10:14] thoughts it's his thoughts and so his
[1:10:16] thoughts are you
[1:10:18] his thoughts are all about you right
[1:10:21] from the start
[1:10:22] adam and eve were walking in the cool
[1:10:24] with the lord and they fell and i want
[1:10:26] you to notice when they fell our lord
[1:10:28] our god he went through the garden
[1:10:30] calling adam adam adam where are you now
[1:10:33] it wasn't that god was lost
[1:10:36] it wasn't god that god was not all seen
[1:10:38] that he couldn't find at him he knew
[1:10:39] exactly where adam was
[1:10:41] but the voice of god was speaking
[1:10:43] directly to the inward being added
[1:10:45] saying where have you gone to adam
[1:10:48] how far have you you didn't listen to my
[1:10:51] voice you didn't listen to what i
[1:10:53] speaking and you have fallen and because
[1:10:55] you have fallen that day
[1:10:57] you shall die
[1:10:59] but i know it should notice in order for
[1:11:01] god to show forth all his attributes of
[1:11:03] his word
[1:11:04] he needed to allow man to come into a
[1:11:06] permissive will
[1:11:08] through free moral agency
[1:11:10] you've got a choice what you want to
[1:11:12] hear
[1:11:13] you chose tonight to hear the word of
[1:11:15] god some years ago you know you're
[1:11:17] walking you maybe thought that you know
[1:11:19] you walked into a church or you stumbled
[1:11:21] into somebody it was you're doing it was
[1:11:23] never your doing at any of the time you
[1:11:26] just came in because god was wooing you
[1:11:30] and that's all part of election we'll
[1:11:32] get maybe into it in just a moment
[1:11:34] so his thoughts are of you
[1:11:37] okay make this personal everybody make
[1:11:39] this person personal because this is a
[1:11:41] personal god and we said yesterday god
[1:11:43] has no grandchildren so when you realize
[1:11:46] that down from his glory he came for it
[1:11:48] with the thoughts and intentions for you
[1:11:51] he died on the cross for you he paid
[1:11:53] those prices for you for your sickness
[1:11:55] for your pain for all of your struggles
[1:11:58] all your depressions anything you're
[1:11:59] going through he's already paid it all
[1:12:01] the strikes were upon his back this he
[1:12:03] did for you
[1:12:04] and he has foundational thoughts about
[1:12:08] you
[1:12:09] before the world was ever created before
[1:12:11] he said let there be light and there was
[1:12:13] light
[1:12:14] before you know there's anything that
[1:12:16] was created upon there's he had a
[1:12:18] thought about you
[1:12:20] in ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 it says
[1:12:22] he hath chosen us in him
[1:12:26] and i like to underline that and you
[1:12:27] know this very well but he has chosen us
[1:12:30] in him before the foundation of the
[1:12:33] world
[1:12:34] that we should be holy
[1:12:37] okay not just you know 16 elements or
[1:12:40] blobs walking on this earth and just you
[1:12:42] know fulfilling our earthly desires no
[1:12:45] we're chosen in him
[1:12:47] that we are holy and without blame
[1:12:49] before him in love it's his desire that
[1:12:52] we have a love relationship
[1:12:57] it's a husband-and-wife relationship
[1:12:59] it's an intimate relationship between a
[1:13:01] man and his wife the two shall become
[1:13:04] one
[1:13:05] and they shall bring forth fruit you see
[1:13:06] this is what god desires of us it's the
[1:13:10] thoughts of god that he's seen of us
[1:13:13] in colossians chapter 1 verse 27
[1:13:16] it says to whom now he's speaking
[1:13:18] directly to us
[1:13:19] make it personal to whom god
[1:13:22] would make known what is the glory and
[1:13:25] riches of
[1:13:26] the riches and glory of his mystery who
[1:13:28] is he revealing his mystery to to us
[1:13:32] now this
[1:13:33] this scripture
[1:13:35] was written a way long time ago
[1:13:38] but it took
[1:13:39] the eyes of a prophet
[1:13:42] amos 3 7 says
[1:13:44] that the word of god comes to a prophet
[1:13:46] and we need this prophet to point this
[1:13:48] out to us who he's speaking to us
[1:13:52] this is the voice of god to us it's the
[1:13:54] king's speech to us
[1:13:56] it's to you he wants to declare a
[1:13:58] mystery unto you he wants to show
[1:14:00] something to you we are gentiles we're
[1:14:03] not jews we're gentiles and he desires
[1:14:06] to show a mystery to us
[1:14:08] now remember when jesus was here on
[1:14:10] earth he came to his own
[1:14:12] there was the jewish brethren
[1:14:14] and they received him not
[1:14:16] but to as many as he would seem that he
[1:14:18] gave the power to become sons of god
[1:14:21] and we see peter after the death of our
[1:14:23] lord we see peter up there and he's he's
[1:14:26] he's sleeping and he has a v or and he
[1:14:28] comes and he has a vision and we see
[1:14:30] that basket of unclean animals and the
[1:14:32] voices kill and eat he says oh that's
[1:14:34] unclean he says don't call and clean
[1:14:37] that which is clean
[1:14:38] and it was a vision it was a a a voice
[1:14:42] spoken so that we could see as gentiles
[1:14:44] that we're going to receive truth for
[1:14:46] the hour for the day that they were
[1:14:48] living in
[1:14:49] and that truth to the gentiles is the
[1:14:51] same truth that we're receiving today
[1:14:53] it's picked up through the eyes of a
[1:14:55] prophet and brought to us to show us who
[1:14:58] we are that there's a mystery to us
[1:15:00] gentiles that we must receive in this
[1:15:04] hour
[1:15:06] paul preached the foundational truth he
[1:15:07] gave them the word for their time and
[1:15:09] they were ready for the season for
[1:15:11] rapture in their time but them without
[1:15:13] us were not perfect we needed to come
[1:15:16] so i'm speaking to you tonight that god
[1:15:19] sees you you are the people that god
[1:15:21] sees and he says you know what i want to
[1:15:22] do i want you to recognize this mystery
[1:15:25] it's christ
[1:15:27] in you
[1:15:29] you've got to recognize it's christ in
[1:15:31] you the hope of glory it's got to be
[1:15:33] more than words that's why i'm trying to
[1:15:35] express it to you don't let this three
[1:15:37] words on the page you've got to see that
[1:15:40] in your heart that you are the receiving
[1:15:43] set
[1:15:45] in this hour this day that we're you are
[1:15:48] that receiving set
[1:15:49] your heart has been cleansed by the
[1:15:51] blood of jesus christ and since that
[1:15:54] time you have become a receiving set for
[1:15:57] the sending set amen amen right now now
[1:16:01] our young people
[1:16:03] you know most of them don't know what it
[1:16:05] means to have or to see a television
[1:16:07] with rabbit ears
[1:16:09] right
[1:16:10] well there was this box let me explain
[1:16:11] to you it was a bog
[1:16:15] and on this box
[1:16:16] it had some bulbs and some things and
[1:16:18] you had it was a receiving set and there
[1:16:20] were some antennas and the signals were
[1:16:21] transferred back and forth and sometimes
[1:16:24] things were really fuzzy
[1:16:26] you you would turn the channel and you'd
[1:16:28] want to watch something and it was
[1:16:30] it was fuzzy
[1:16:32] and then
[1:16:33] somebody had to go up there and adjust
[1:16:35] adjust the antennas
[1:16:37] the rabbit ears and uh
[1:16:39] stop stop stop stop it's clear
[1:16:42] right and then you'd hold still and hope
[1:16:44] that it you know hey in this hour okay
[1:16:47] we're not talking about televisions now
[1:16:49] in this hour god
[1:16:51] has had a prophet to make all things
[1:16:53] clear for us
[1:16:55] he was pretty fuzzy
[1:16:57] oh we could see it now they went through
[1:16:59] the dark ages and those dark ages were
[1:17:01] really dim it was pretty fuzzy and all
[1:17:03] of a sudden luther came and a little bit
[1:17:06] more light came and the fuzz came out of
[1:17:08] the receiving set just a little the just
[1:17:11] shall live by faith
[1:17:13] oh my goodness that was reforming
[1:17:14] reformer now
[1:17:16] we were just a little more and wesley
[1:17:18] picked that up and he said now you know
[1:17:20] it's not just the judge shall live by
[1:17:21] faith but now you need to be cleansed
[1:17:23] you need to be washed you can't live the
[1:17:25] way you're living
[1:17:27] and they walked forward and in 1906 all
[1:17:29] of a sudden all of a sudden began to
[1:17:31] move and also the power of god began to
[1:17:32] fall
[1:17:33] i always have a start of a pentecostal
[1:17:35] age and all of some people wow the
[1:17:37] things oh god is present this is amazing
[1:17:40] what's happened but all the while god
[1:17:42] was preparing a man that was born for
[1:17:45] the season i want you to notice the
[1:17:48] prophet is born for the season
[1:17:50] amen and he's born at the time and all
[1:17:53] then all of a sudden he was that one
[1:17:55] that was able to through the mind of god
[1:17:58] to just the set
[1:17:59] so that we could see the thoughts of god
[1:18:03] so we become the receiving set you see
[1:18:05] it's christ in us and that's what the
[1:18:07] prophet did he introduced us to jesus
[1:18:10] christ he showed us christ that you
[1:18:14] could enter into the holy so holy
[1:18:16] yourself and you could speak to him
[1:18:18] you're not walking in darkness trying to
[1:18:19] get through man's ideas and no you could
[1:18:22] live and soar in the realms of an eagle
[1:18:24] anointing
[1:18:26] this is the prophet's message you're not
[1:18:28] walking in darkness no more it's
[1:18:30] amazingly clear
[1:18:32] okay brother brown talks about the god
[1:18:34] and he says you know it's like taking
[1:18:35] the binoculars the looking glasses and
[1:18:37] you know if they're out of focus and you
[1:18:38] look way up in the mountain you see that
[1:18:40] elk and if it's not just perfectly
[1:18:44] toned in what are you going to see
[1:18:46] you're going to see three alk but really
[1:18:48] up there when you tune it in and you
[1:18:50] begin to focus it prophet properly he
[1:18:52] says what is it it's back to one elk and
[1:18:55] friends that's the prize of a prophet he
[1:18:57] zoomed in
[1:18:59] hallelujah the old testament the new
[1:19:01] testament all god had for us and he
[1:19:03] brought it all together so we could see
[1:19:05] one picture and what was that picture
[1:19:08] christ in you
[1:19:10] oh friends we
[1:19:12] we've studied the church ages and we
[1:19:14] studied the seals and we've read about
[1:19:17] our future home and we've got all these
[1:19:18] things but all of it the point of it is
[1:19:21] christ wants to be in you
[1:19:24] he wants to show his glory in you and
[1:19:27] the testimony of his glory is written in
[1:19:29] the church ages the testimony of what
[1:19:32] he's done is in the seals and how he's
[1:19:34] broken for us and we ought to study it
[1:19:36] and meditate about those things but the
[1:19:38] purpose is he wants to be in fellowship
[1:19:41] he wants to recognize that you
[1:19:44] are his thoughts
[1:19:47] amen
[1:19:48] hallelujah
[1:19:51] and so what did he do he cleansed your
[1:19:53] heart by his blood
[1:19:54] and since that time you've become that
[1:19:56] receiving set from the sending set and
[1:19:58] you need to be able to find and know it
[1:20:00] from that time
[1:20:03] you see every man and every woman has to
[1:20:05] have an experience of god to know from
[1:20:06] that time amen
[1:20:09] i want you to recognize now many people
[1:20:11] say well
[1:20:12] and and i agree 100
[1:20:14] it's not by sensation
[1:20:16] it's by the word that you recognize from
[1:20:18] that time
[1:20:19] but i want you to notice in type
[1:20:22] that when abraham was circumcised he
[1:20:24] realized he was circumcised
[1:20:27] and circumcision in the scripture
[1:20:30] all right
[1:20:31] this is a is a is a symbol this is a
[1:20:34] type
[1:20:35] of receiving the holy ghost except we
[1:20:37] receive it by the circumcision of our
[1:20:39] heart
[1:20:41] so if abraham realized and understood
[1:20:44] that he had been circumcised then you
[1:20:46] and i also have to come a place in our
[1:20:48] life where we see a change of our nature
[1:20:53] now this was written in my notes friends
[1:20:55] a long time before we had breakfast this
[1:20:56] morning
[1:20:59] we got to recognize that we're children
[1:21:02] of god how
[1:21:03] by a life change
[1:21:06] our lives are up and down
[1:21:09] the staying power is the holy spirit
[1:21:12] he's the one that reveals things to us
[1:21:14] and causes us to recognize that we have
[1:21:17] a change of nature we are all beasts
[1:21:19] walking around and after our own lusts
[1:21:22] and our own desires
[1:21:24] but when god came in our lives there was
[1:21:26] a difference
[1:21:28] i don't care if you were the rank a
[1:21:30] sinner and you came in and you recognize
[1:21:31] that you're cleansed or you're the
[1:21:33] purest young person that sits on the
[1:21:35] bench you will recognize what god has
[1:21:38] done for you personally and you will not
[1:21:40] be able to really share your experience
[1:21:43] with somebody else because somebody else
[1:21:44] has their own experience
[1:21:46] you see as human beings we always want
[1:21:48] to clump our experiences together oh i
[1:21:49] was the guy that ran around the tree did
[1:21:51] you have a run around tree experience
[1:21:53] shouting hot dog well no i didn't know
[1:21:55] and we all want to be that guy that has
[1:21:58] these experiences but god sometimes
[1:21:59] supernaturally comes in your life and
[1:22:01] speaks to you quietly
[1:22:03] it's not in the wind it's not in the
[1:22:06] thunders it can be but it's not always
[1:22:08] there and he comes and he says to you
[1:22:11] i love you amen and i change your nature
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:16] and all of a sudden you say thank you
[1:22:17] lord
[1:22:18] you know what you do you confess it
[1:22:21] he came to me
[1:22:24] when i could not come he came to me and
[1:22:26] he said i love you
[1:22:28] and i take away your sin and i take all
[1:22:30] that you've ever done and i accept and i
[1:22:33] take it all and put in the sea of my
[1:22:34] forgetfulness and i want to fill you
[1:22:36] with my life and all you have to say yes
[1:22:37] lord
[1:22:39] yes lord surrender yes lord and then
[1:22:41] what you do begin you read his word
[1:22:46] you can't live unless you eat yeah
[1:22:49] how many you ate today
[1:22:51] absolutely
[1:22:52] we ate i ate dinner i ate butter chicken
[1:22:54] it was awesome
[1:22:56] okay that's giving me strength right now
[1:22:57] to preach the gospel to you
[1:22:59] friends you got to eat of the word of
[1:23:01] god to live
[1:23:03] if you don't eat you get anorexic you
[1:23:06] know the folks that are now i'm off my
[1:23:08] notes now friends
[1:23:09] there's people that are anorexic right
[1:23:12] and uh you know if you've ever been in
[1:23:14] an area in psychiatry you begin to get
[1:23:17] these lovely people who come and they're
[1:23:19] skinny like a rail you can see every
[1:23:20] bone in their body but when they look in
[1:23:22] the mirror they see themselves fat
[1:23:25] they got cloudy vision
[1:23:27] you know it didn't start there
[1:23:29] it started with a perverted thought
[1:23:32] it started somewhere in their minds
[1:23:34] somebody said something they started
[1:23:35] there it became a pervertify and what
[1:23:37] happened all of a sudden something in
[1:23:39] their selves clicked off and they begin
[1:23:42] to see unclearly
[1:23:44] but i want you to notice if you keep
[1:23:46] your mind in the word of god and look
[1:23:48] upon the mirror of the word friends it's
[1:23:50] always going to tell you the truth
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:54] it's going to make you walk in truth and
[1:23:56] abide in truth it's not going to lie to
[1:23:58] you and your senses will remain in the
[1:24:01] truth of his word and in check
[1:24:04] it's important to remain in check but
[1:24:06] it's the word of god now if you take a
[1:24:08] different looking glass
[1:24:10] and you look at yourself according to
[1:24:11] what satan sees upon you he'll lie to
[1:24:14] you
[1:24:15] he's the father of lies he's going to
[1:24:16] tell you things and before you know it
[1:24:18] you're going to end up with your face in
[1:24:20] the gutter
[1:24:21] lost your family or
[1:24:23] or in a place you don't ever want to be
[1:24:25] backslidden
[1:24:27] let's look into the mirror that god has
[1:24:29] for us
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:31] i wonder if you can say in your hearts
[1:24:33] from that time i remember from that time
[1:24:36] i remember that time when i had
[1:24:37] experience with god from that time
[1:24:40] now if you've never had an experience
[1:24:41] with god today you can meet him amen
[1:24:45] he's here with us this evening
[1:24:47] and
[1:24:48] i believe without you just have to say
[1:24:50] lord come my way that's right you got to
[1:24:52] press through the crowd
[1:24:54] you got to push in and say it's my turn
[1:24:56] remember the woman with the blood issue
[1:25:00] you know i want you to recognize that
[1:25:01] one that woman was unclean
[1:25:03] she had a blood issue and during jewish
[1:25:05] times if you had a bleeding problem like
[1:25:07] she she had you had to stay outside the
[1:25:09] camp you were
[1:25:11] filthy you were dirty nobody wanted to
[1:25:13] be around you
[1:25:14] and no doubt when she pressed in friends
[1:25:16] when she pressed in they looked in and
[1:25:17] said oh my goodness
[1:25:19] that woman's coming into the city
[1:25:22] and maybe whisper whisper but she didn't
[1:25:23] care
[1:25:24] she had to get to jesus and she pushed
[1:25:27] and she pushed and she pushed and she
[1:25:29] touched the hem of his garment and we
[1:25:31] know the end of the story where she went
[1:25:33] from jesus and he recognized who but she
[1:25:35] was but i want you to recognize her
[1:25:37] attitude she was willing beyond all
[1:25:40] costs to receive her healing for that
[1:25:43] sickness now that blood issue that she
[1:25:45] was going through was a symbol of sin
[1:25:47] and she was willing to push that her sin
[1:25:50] would be omitted and that she would
[1:25:52] receive virtue which is power
[1:25:55] due to his life power in her very being
[1:25:58] to change your situation how about your
[1:26:00] situation today are you willing to reach
[1:26:03] out
[1:26:05] and push through the crowd no matter
[1:26:07] what anybody thinks and get a hold of
[1:26:09] his garment that power from on high
[1:26:11] might cleanse you and change you into
[1:26:14] this being that god has thoughts of you
[1:26:16] on
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:19] i challenge you tonight in the name of
[1:26:20] the lord to find a statement in your
[1:26:23] heart from this time
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:26] brother branham says in 1964 he says
[1:26:29] yeah and and who do you say this is he
[1:26:31] says i got a little receiving set in
[1:26:34] here and i believe if he was preaching
[1:26:37] he'd be pointing to his heart here he
[1:26:40] says i've got a little receiving set in
[1:26:42] here a little thing that lights up in my
[1:26:44] heart
[1:26:45] i know it
[1:26:46] reflects him
[1:26:48] you see that word is a reflector
[1:26:52] and it reflects in the heart of the
[1:26:54] believer and then brother brown says in
[1:26:55] revelations chapter four number three in
[1:26:57] 1961 he says now
[1:27:00] the lamps reflecting the words
[1:27:03] the true word reflects what
[1:27:06] what would this lamp if it was getting
[1:27:08] its reflection from the shekinah glory
[1:27:11] it would reflect the shekinah glory
[1:27:15] now in our lives if we're feeding upon
[1:27:17] the word of god
[1:27:18] what would it reflect amen
[1:27:21] it would reflect the word
[1:27:23] it would perfect his life now i want to
[1:27:26] point in just a moment to the attention
[1:27:28] there to those moons that are on their
[1:27:30] through the seven church ages and i want
[1:27:32] you to remember that brother branham
[1:27:34] says that the bride is that type of that
[1:27:36] moon and the sun the s-o-n is that one
[1:27:40] that is shining upon the moon and if you
[1:27:42] look in there in the first age of
[1:27:44] ephesus there was a lot of light
[1:27:46] and a little bit of darkness the church
[1:27:48] was reflecting in its in its pureness
[1:27:51] but as time progressed what humanism
[1:27:54] progressed and they began to listen to
[1:27:56] the wrong voice and man started to take
[1:27:59] over and the things that were happening
[1:28:00] is you read the church ages and finally
[1:28:02] we get to a place of laodicea and i want
[1:28:04] you to notice that brother adam he said
[1:28:06] now the moon was darkened but but but i
[1:28:09] knew that the bride was here so i put a
[1:28:11] little bit of light in there
[1:28:13] and i want you to notice that light is
[1:28:15] you and i
[1:28:17] that's the thoughts of god that's who
[1:28:20] you are friends this whole world would
[1:28:22] be dark
[1:28:24] unless there was something lighting up
[1:28:27] in the hearts of god's children unless
[1:28:29] there was people that were reflecting
[1:28:31] the word reflecting the shining kind of
[1:28:33] glory the nature of christ for today
[1:28:37] brother brown says in harvest time he
[1:28:38] says but jesus
[1:28:41] when he was when the spirit of truth has
[1:28:43] come see he will bring these things
[1:28:46] that i have taught to your memory the
[1:28:48] word and he will also show you things to
[1:28:50] come
[1:28:52] there is the real spirit-filled church
[1:28:54] now stays with
[1:28:56] the word
[1:28:57] reflects the word god on earth i read
[1:29:02] this to you so that you know that i'm
[1:29:04] right in the word of god and i'm in the
[1:29:06] middle of the road it's god in you
[1:29:08] friends it's god here upon earth
[1:29:12] the reason that there's still blood here
[1:29:14] the still blood and i want to tell you
[1:29:16] today there's blood on the mercy seat
[1:29:18] and why is your blood on the mercy set
[1:29:20] because you're still here
[1:29:24] oh thank you lord
[1:29:26] oh praise the lord but one day when the
[1:29:28] bride is taken from this earth there
[1:29:30] will be no more mercy
[1:29:32] friends we don't want to be there on
[1:29:33] that time when there's no more mercy let
[1:29:34] me tell you if you see the prophets of
[1:29:36] revelations of moses and elijah here
[1:29:38] upon the earth it's time for you to be
[1:29:40] frightened
[1:29:41] i do not want to be here to see those
[1:29:44] prophets you say oh no brother steve no
[1:29:46] because i know the tribulation is on the
[1:29:48] bride is gone
[1:29:50] and i am not a foolish virgin and i
[1:29:52] don't want to pay attention to the
[1:29:54] foolish virgin i am that virgin that has
[1:29:56] got oil in their lamp
[1:29:58] and i'm going out to meet the bridegroom
[1:30:00] now if you've got to go buy oil that'll
[1:30:02] begin your problem but right now he said
[1:30:05] that i could have the oil and i could
[1:30:07] have that oil living through me speaking
[1:30:10] through me acting through me because i
[1:30:12] am the literal thoughts of god i am that
[1:30:15] reflection of that light hallelujah and
[1:30:18] shining upon the earth friends but
[1:30:20] friends who i'm warning us this one day
[1:30:22] if we don't have that light the bride
[1:30:25] room will call and you'll be searching
[1:30:26] for oil and you don't want to be that
[1:30:28] foolish virgin at that time
[1:30:31] it's god on earth he says reading again
[1:30:33] he says it doesn't mean any theologian
[1:30:35] causes this word is has no private
[1:30:38] interpretation
[1:30:40] he interprets his own word i'm so
[1:30:44] thankful for that
[1:30:46] i'm the word for the hour and god
[1:30:49] is speaking about who i am
[1:30:52] are you the word for the hour
[1:30:54] right the word has become part of us
[1:30:55] amen oh well i haven't written here
[1:30:58] further in my notes and i'll skip in a
[1:30:59] moment because i want to share right now
[1:31:00] we are called messiahs
[1:31:03] brother branham says we are gods with a
[1:31:05] small g
[1:31:06] oh those are strong words and many have
[1:31:08] left because of but the bride rejoices
[1:31:10] because we are sons and daughters of god
[1:31:14] born by the spirit of god our natures
[1:31:17] are changed we're no longer of this
[1:31:19] world
[1:31:20] oh that makes us gods now when i want to
[1:31:22] tell you not my notes now when you speak
[1:31:25] it's god speaking
[1:31:27] be mindful of your words
[1:31:30] what you speak whatever you speak will
[1:31:32] bind in earth and it will bind in heaven
[1:31:34] friends it's your word speak the truth
[1:31:38] speak god's word
[1:31:41] if there's any sick amongst us tonight
[1:31:43] speak the word

[1:31:47] god

[1:32:18] name you have the voice of the word
[1:32:20] inside of you you are the thoughts of
[1:32:22] god
[1:32:26] he interprets his own word by
[1:32:27] vindicating and proving it it to be the
[1:32:30] truth when you walk in the supermarket
[1:32:32] he is proving it it's the proof in the
[1:32:35] pudding
[1:32:36] when you are a child of god with a smile
[1:32:39] on your face you know that we should
[1:32:40] never walk around with a frown
[1:32:42] because the joy of the lord is our
[1:32:43] strength
[1:32:45] it makes no difference our situation
[1:32:46] does you know you can have minus 350 in
[1:32:50] the bank account makes no difference you
[1:32:52] know why because god is our provider
[1:32:55] you bring that number to zero and you
[1:32:57] still have money on your our food on
[1:32:59] your table and and some place to cover
[1:33:02] your head he didn't promise that us to
[1:33:04] drive a mercedes brother gerald with one
[1:33:06] of those seat belts that comes across
[1:33:08] like we were talking today he didn't
[1:33:09] promise that to us but he promised he
[1:33:11] would care for us
[1:33:13] that he would look after us and that we
[1:33:14] would not have to go hungry he wasn't
[1:33:16] going to see his children begging for
[1:33:19] breads
[1:33:20] that's the god we serve
[1:33:22] that's the one who wrote his name upon
[1:33:24] our heart the white stone of our heart
[1:33:26] he has put his name in there
[1:33:28] you think mrs jesus christ is going to
[1:33:30] starve you think she's going to wander
[1:33:32] her she's going to die of covet friends
[1:33:34] come on who are we oh you say brother
[1:33:36] that people have died yeah they die but
[1:33:38] it's only by god's choosing
[1:33:41] no man can die unless god calls
[1:33:45] no disease no cancers no friends
[1:33:48] man satan can't take your life look at
[1:33:50] job he had to go to god for permission
[1:33:54] just to test him
[1:33:56] and god said okay test him he's my he's
[1:33:58] my son he's gonna come up proven but he
[1:34:00] can't you can't take his life and all
[1:34:03] through the troubles he took his
[1:34:04] children's life he you know he took us
[1:34:06] all different things from him but he
[1:34:08] could not touch job because god said no
[1:34:13] we give the devil too much credit oh the
[1:34:15] devil's going to take our life with such
[1:34:17] and such no no no you might have died
[1:34:20] with sunshine your friends had died but
[1:34:21] don't friends think one moment that god
[1:34:23] has not made the decision for you
[1:34:26] he's allowed satan to afflict you and
[1:34:28] the and your faith the faith has been
[1:34:30] weak but has nothing to do with your
[1:34:32] salvation god has taken you to be at his
[1:34:35] side blessed be the name of the lord
[1:34:37] at that point it's a win-win situation
[1:34:40] if you stay here on the earth well when
[1:34:42] you get to stay with your family if you
[1:34:43] die you have a coronation day you enter

[1:34:52] right you see your loved ones
[1:34:54] and to you it's like a vacation time
[1:34:56] before your other family shows up

[1:35:02] thousand here

[1:35:15] lose somebody but our joy is the lord
[1:35:17] and we recognize that friends is just a
[1:35:19] moment a blink
[1:35:21] of time before we see
[1:35:23] our heavenly father
[1:35:25] but only if we have his life
[1:35:29] right
[1:35:30] it takes his life
[1:35:32] yeah we want to go to the right place
[1:35:37] now too are you okay
[1:35:39] all right to a non-seed there's no
[1:35:41] effect
[1:35:43] nothing is inside too quick in that
[1:35:47] they go on in life but to a believer
[1:35:49] there's effect
[1:35:50] the word has spoken to them it's
[1:35:52] quickened in their life and brother
[1:35:53] brown says in the trial he says this a
[1:35:55] grain of seed laying on the desk will
[1:35:58] never grow a harvest a grain of course
[1:36:01] uh corn on the blue stone will will do
[1:36:03] nothing a grain of corn has got to fall
[1:36:06] in the ground and be fertilized for the
[1:36:09] grain of corn or it will not grow
[1:36:12] and god said that his word is the seed
[1:36:15] and that the sower sowed and it must
[1:36:17] fall in the right kind of soil
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:22] praise the lord oh heavenly father
[1:36:24] prepare our soil
[1:36:26] make sure our soil is good ground now i
[1:36:28] want you to know sometimes a hard ground
[1:36:30] will produce some life but and it will
[1:36:32] start growing but let me tell you when
[1:36:34] the when the storms of life and and
[1:36:36] temper change changes happen and people
[1:36:38] walk along the path what happens that
[1:36:40] thing gets destroyed and it cannot live
[1:36:43] and we've seen many many people like
[1:36:44] that
[1:36:46] in the message
[1:36:47] come on
[1:36:48] as a boy growing all the way up to where
[1:36:50] i am today i've seen people that have
[1:36:52] stood in the pulpit people have sat in
[1:36:53] the pew they were great people we
[1:36:56] thought they were amazing people but
[1:36:57] they had no quickening life inside of
[1:37:00] them they had not prepared the soil for
[1:37:03] god's seed to be planted they sat year
[1:37:05] after year time after time we thought
[1:37:08] they had the holy ghost they pretended
[1:37:10] to have the holy ghost they didn't go
[1:37:12] all the way with god and what happened
[1:37:14] today we see them and they're rebuking
[1:37:16] they're spitting upon the very word that
[1:37:18] brings life what was it it was soil
[1:37:22] that was not ready for the seed
[1:37:25] they didn't soften themselves before the
[1:37:26] god amen we're all of our choice you're
[1:37:29] going to remember now predestination
[1:37:30] comes involved there but when it starts
[1:37:32] and stands here friends we all have a
[1:37:34] choice
[1:37:36] let me not have deaf ears oh god to hear
[1:37:39] your word
[1:37:40] for the time in the season
[1:37:43] hallelujah it must fall in the right
[1:37:45] kind of soil that soil is faith it's a
[1:37:48] seed and it must fall into the ground or
[1:37:50] it cannot be quickened brother brahma
[1:37:52] says quickly minks means to be made
[1:37:53] alive
[1:37:55] it's words
[1:37:56] the holy spirit defend with the
[1:37:58] defenselessness says here he can't even
[1:38:01] come to it and f until it falls into the
[1:38:03] right ground
[1:38:05] don't let it just be words to you
[1:38:06] tonight
[1:38:09] love this word that's why i keep on
[1:38:10] saying let it be personal okay
[1:38:13] let it drop into your heart amen and
[1:38:16] jesus is saying to us can
[1:38:18] you hear my thoughts
[1:38:20] now to hear means to understand what is
[1:38:23] being said
[1:38:24] and you know sometimes you can hear
[1:38:25] someone speak but you really don't
[1:38:27] understand what they're saying how many
[1:38:28] has ever come to that spawn now you know
[1:38:31] there's some very intellectual people
[1:38:32] and very people have such good
[1:38:34] understanding now you know if you sat
[1:38:36] together with you know some doctor
[1:38:38] friends of mine and and they're
[1:38:40] describing a surgery to you and they're
[1:38:42] using all kinds of medical terms and you
[1:38:44] don't know what those medical terms what
[1:38:46] happens you hear
[1:38:47] the voice
[1:38:48] but you don't understand what it's
[1:38:50] saying
[1:38:52] but you know after some time
[1:38:54] you know you work with the fellows and
[1:38:55] they begin to teach you and point and
[1:38:57] tell you and show you and you all of a
[1:38:59] sudden gain the revelation of what
[1:39:01] they're saying and all of a sudden it
[1:39:03] becomes clear and then you get involved
[1:39:05] i've been involved in some surgeries and
[1:39:07] before you know it
[1:39:08] you know the the the the things that
[1:39:10] they're telling are now become clear to
[1:39:12] me i've experienced them
[1:39:14] they come become part of who i am you
[1:39:16] can't take that away i can go through a
[1:39:18] belly surgery with you and i can tell
[1:39:19] you how it all goes and i tell you where
[1:39:21] where it all sits and how it looks it
[1:39:23] has become part of me
[1:39:25] right because it's become a revelation
[1:39:26] to me and it's the same thing with the
[1:39:28] word of god many times it sounds like
[1:39:30] greek the preacher is preaching and all
[1:39:32] of a sudden we're talking about the
[1:39:33] revelations and also in our minds go
[1:39:34] shoop
[1:39:36] they turn them off right
[1:39:38] come on now how many has ever sat am i
[1:39:41] the only guy
[1:39:43] okay
[1:39:44] lord bless brother lonnie sitting in the
[1:39:45] presence of god just now but there's
[1:39:47] many times that brother lonnie's been
[1:39:48] praying has preached in times past and
[1:39:50] he went way deep and i and i wasn't
[1:39:52] quite ready for that mystery
[1:39:54] understanding and i sat there and went
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:40:02] he didn't speak very long anyways but
[1:40:03] this is really good
[1:40:05] right
[1:40:06] right because you don't understand
[1:40:09] but you know something you get into the
[1:40:10] presence of god say lord i don't
[1:40:12] understand
[1:40:14] i don't understand the verbiage i don't
[1:40:15] understand what he's speaking but
[1:40:17] father would you show me to me you know
[1:40:19] you know i i know brother berry coffee
[1:40:22] he's just preaching the word to me he's
[1:40:23] just giving me just nuggets of real
[1:40:25] truth and i just don't get it lord could
[1:40:27] you open my eyes
[1:40:29] you hang around that long enough and all
[1:40:30] of a sudden god begins to show you
[1:40:33] and not only does he show you all of a
[1:40:34] sudden it becomes a part of you and it
[1:40:36] becomes an action of you
[1:40:38] and before you know it now it's not
[1:40:40] something that anybody can take away
[1:40:41] from you if they explained it to you and
[1:40:44] you took it intellectually what happens
[1:40:46] oh that's really cool and then you start
[1:40:47] talking to somebody else and before they
[1:40:49] you know i don't really see it the same
[1:40:50] way those brothers preach it so this is
[1:40:52] what i think and you're like oh
[1:40:54] okay and then you start adding things
[1:40:56] together and before you know you've got
[1:40:57] the cow in the tree
[1:40:59] right
[1:41:00] and everything's all upside down why
[1:41:02] because something other than the holy
[1:41:04] ghost
[1:41:05] has given you the truth has given you
[1:41:08] the word and you know so sometimes we we
[1:41:10] hear something we speak but we have to
[1:41:12] say and humble ourself before god and
[1:41:14] say lord you teach me
[1:41:16] you show me you'd let me tell you what
[1:41:19] what help me to understand what you're
[1:41:21] saying
[1:41:22] another illustration of this you know us
[1:41:23] husbands have selected hearing
[1:41:26] and i'm proud of it
[1:41:30] the only thing i respond to and always
[1:41:32] respond to is honey time for dinner
[1:41:35] but you know and she says honey i got a
[1:41:37] honeydew list you know some i got
[1:41:38] selective hearing
[1:41:40] right oh or children where are they they
[1:41:43] also have this problem you know go clean
[1:41:45] up your room for the 150th time they
[1:41:48] don't want to hear that but you know you
[1:41:49] say hey let's go shopping right
[1:41:52] everybody's in the car
[1:41:53] right selective hearing let's not have
[1:41:55] selected hearing
[1:41:57] we do that all the time the spirit of
[1:41:58] god wants us to take the whole picture
[1:42:01] you can always sit and i'm just like the
[1:42:03] rest of you you know it's times and
[1:42:04] seasons we're in places of our life
[1:42:06] preachers pray chaining or we're
[1:42:07] listening to a tape and we're like oh
[1:42:09] that's really good for no that's for
[1:42:11] that guy
[1:42:12] right and we start doing the pitchfork
[1:42:14] religion i already heard that before hey
[1:42:15] we all have done it right we're
[1:42:17] preaching real hard i even seen it this
[1:42:19] evening in someone's eye i'm preaching
[1:42:21] about something all of a sudden somebody
[1:42:22] looked at the corner of their eye to
[1:42:23] somebody else and i just said praise the
[1:42:25] lord i'm going to get on pitchforge uh
[1:42:27] religion because that's what we do
[1:42:31] right we're sitting there
[1:42:33] hey hey listen we're we're we're good
[1:42:35] people i sit there like this
[1:42:37] and all of a sudden the word's being
[1:42:38] preached to me and we know it's for
[1:42:40] somebody else and we're not taking it's
[1:42:42] somebody else's problem right look at
[1:42:44] this
[1:42:47] hoping he gets it right
[1:42:49] and when they go this year's like praise
[1:42:51] the lord
[1:42:52] hallelujah
[1:42:53] right
[1:42:54] it's a vision for somebody else god
[1:42:56] doesn't want us to do that
[1:42:59] right if you're looking at the corner of
[1:43:00] your eye to somebody else
[1:43:02] more chances than not it's for you
[1:43:05] right take it apart of your life and
[1:43:07] allow it to live
[1:43:09] and jesus says do you hear what i has
[1:43:11] been said now the word speech all right
[1:43:13] that spirit speech is it's vocalization
[1:43:17] a thought a word being expressed
[1:43:20] so i'm expressing through vocalization a
[1:43:23] thought to you and jesus is saying why
[1:43:26] do you not understand my thoughts
[1:43:28] expressed
[1:43:30] think about now the word now spiritual
[1:43:32] minds thoughts express
[1:43:34] now let's tie that back to what the
[1:43:35] prophet has to say thoughts express you
[1:43:37] know what that is he's talking about the
[1:43:40] logos
[1:43:42] look at the word logos for a moment the
[1:43:43] greek word logos means it's often
[1:43:46] translated brother branham says the
[1:43:47] english to the word the meaning word but
[1:43:49] it also means a thought speech
[1:43:52] meaning reason
[1:43:54] he says john 1 in the beginning was the
[1:43:57] word the root of which we get our
[1:43:59] translation for word is logos which
[1:44:02] means the thought or concept it has a
[1:44:04] double meaning a thought and a speech
[1:44:07] now a thought expressed is a word or
[1:44:10] words it isn't a isn't that wonderful
[1:44:12] it's beautiful so the locus of god is
[1:44:15] thoughts expressed
[1:44:17] okay i read that all to you so that you
[1:44:19] can see it again and i'm on the middle
[1:44:20] of the road
[1:44:21] brother brown says the logos of god is
[1:44:24] his thoughts
[1:44:25] expressed
[1:44:28] so how does that pertain to me all right
[1:44:30] let's read it so adam was formed
[1:44:33] of the dust of the earth and his
[1:44:34] spiritual being created by god
[1:44:37] and adam became god's thoughts
[1:44:40] expressed
[1:44:41] god had a thought
[1:44:42] there was a spiritual being and then god
[1:44:45] created an adam the thought of god took
[1:44:48] manifestation took form
[1:44:50] and those eternal thoughts were now
[1:44:52] manifested and down through the
[1:44:54] centuries we could go we find moses and
[1:44:58] jeremiah john the baptist and each one
[1:45:01] of these are god's eternal
[1:45:03] express thoughts expressed in its season
[1:45:08] okay so every season god had some
[1:45:11] thoughts that were expressed
[1:45:13] then they come to jesus the logos he was
[1:45:16] perfect and complete and the complete
[1:45:18] thought expressed and he became known as
[1:45:21] the words right in the beginning was the
[1:45:24] word and the word was with god
[1:45:26] and the word became flesh and the word
[1:45:28] dwelt upon us amongst us now that was
[1:45:30] the fullness of god
[1:45:32] upon the earth at that time
[1:45:34] god's thoughts expressed for the time of
[1:45:37] the season he wanted to dwell amongst
[1:45:39] his people to be re savior to re-redeem
[1:45:42] her to manifest his characteristics and
[1:45:45] he all of his virtues his natures he
[1:45:47] wanted to show it to the people
[1:45:50] but did it all end
[1:45:52] when he died on the cross
[1:45:55] no because he said i'm going to send the
[1:45:57] comforter to you
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:01] he said he's going to send himself he
[1:46:02] was going to come back in a different
[1:46:04] form
[1:46:05] in a different manifestation the same
[1:46:07] god in a different office he's going to
[1:46:09] dwell again amongst the people but he's
[1:46:11] going to do it in a different way when
[1:46:13] jesus was upon the earth it was the
[1:46:15] fullness of god it was all of god and
[1:46:16] jesus but now he wanted to dwell
[1:46:19] individually in you and us
[1:46:21] amen he wanted his thoughts to be
[1:46:23] expressed not just in a one but in a
[1:46:27] multi-membered bride
[1:46:29] oh in acts chapter two i love these
[1:46:31] words and
[1:46:33] you know somebody just labeled me late
[1:46:34] recently as a pentecostal and i i
[1:46:36] clicked my heels 100
[1:46:39] i'm not a denominational pentecostal by
[1:46:41] any stretch of the imagination in fact
[1:46:43] that denomination has ruined it just as
[1:46:46] in this day and this hour has ruined the
[1:46:48] rainbow
[1:46:51] come on get my thoughts
[1:46:53] i love the rainbows
[1:46:54] and it's god's promise
[1:46:56] to the people that he would never
[1:46:57] destroy it by water again
[1:46:59] but satan picked that thing up
[1:47:01] and he ruined the whole meaning behind
[1:47:03] it
[1:47:04] and satan has picked up that word
[1:47:05] pentecost and he was ruined it by
[1:47:08] denomination
[1:47:10] we are pentecostal from the top with
[1:47:12] experience not just with but the life of
[1:47:14] god what happened on the day of
[1:47:16] pentecost and the day of pentecost was
[1:47:18] fully come and they were all in one
[1:47:20] accord in one place and suddenly there
[1:47:22] came from a sound from heaven as a
[1:47:24] mighty rushing wind and it filled the
[1:47:26] house where they were sitting and they
[1:47:28] appeared unto them cloves a tongue like
[1:47:32] of a fire
[1:47:34] oh we get lost in the wind
[1:47:37] we get lost in the noise
[1:47:40] we get lost in the speaking in tongues
[1:47:42] and we get lost in the interpretation
[1:47:44] but i want you to know that fire fell
[1:47:46] upon each one of them so they could
[1:47:48] always this is where i get in here they
[1:47:50] all receive the power of god even so
[1:47:54] much to peter who was a fisherman that
[1:47:57] was unlearned couldn't hardly speak he
[1:47:59] stood up and he began to speak words
[1:48:04] of life to the people
[1:48:06] so friends let's not worry about those
[1:48:08] words pentecost
[1:48:11] we're pentecostal according to the word
[1:48:12] of god that means the life of god is
[1:48:15] living on the inside of us
[1:48:17] and will it make you act differently it
[1:48:19] will change you absolutely and how you
[1:48:22] act it's up between you and god it has
[1:48:24] nothing to do with me
[1:48:29] amen amen
[1:48:30] we have our own experience with god
[1:48:33] our own talk with god our own telling
[1:48:34] with god but people get so afraid
[1:48:37] brother branham says i speak in tongues
[1:48:40] right
[1:48:41] he talked to he said you know i have
[1:48:42] words from god
[1:48:44] all these things that we're going let's
[1:48:45] not be afraid about the the gift okay i
[1:48:48] love the gifts but i want the gift giver
[1:48:52] come on there's a balance yeah
[1:48:54] brother gerald
[1:48:55] amen we want the gift giver and if the
[1:48:57] gift giver comes amongst us and shares a
[1:49:00] gift we'll apply it and give it the word
[1:49:02] test amen amen i'm not afraid of the
[1:49:05] gift we'll give it a word test
[1:49:07] we'll prove it by the word of god and if
[1:49:09] somebody comes up here saying thus saith
[1:49:11] the lord friends and it's not the truth
[1:49:13] there's a lot of men of god here to lay
[1:49:15] their hands out and rebuke the devil
[1:49:18] right so we don't have to be afraid
[1:49:20] we're mature we're not babes anymore
[1:49:22] we're not just sitting there drinking
[1:49:24] milk and not knowing how to apply the
[1:49:25] word of god we've been down the road
[1:49:27] with the word of god teaching us a tutor
[1:49:29] teaching us showing us the way how to
[1:49:31] live how to respond and showing us what
[1:49:33] we live by and it's not by sensations
[1:49:35] but it's by the word of god so we have
[1:49:37] nothing to fear anymore
[1:49:40] but you know if you're a teenager and a
[1:49:41] teenager you get frayed you know who
[1:49:44] what's that that's happening over there
[1:49:45] no let's not be afraid we're mature
[1:49:47] believers
[1:49:49] in christ jesus
[1:49:51] so
[1:49:52] there we see what happened on the day of
[1:49:54] pentecost
[1:49:55] and out of the day of pentecost the
[1:49:56] church was birthed
[1:49:58] the feast and church age
[1:50:00] and there paul began to lay the
[1:50:01] foundation
[1:50:03] and they begin to walk and pretty soon
[1:50:04] there was samarina and pergamus and
[1:50:06] thyroid tyra
[1:50:08] and sardis in philadelphia and he came
[1:50:10] to a place god revealing himself more of
[1:50:13] the word
[1:50:14] oh you went through the dark ages let me
[1:50:16] tell you
[1:50:17] god still was revealing himself
[1:50:19] where was the life it was in the roots
[1:50:21] but let me tell you when it was the time
[1:50:24] the season for the the the bride tree to
[1:50:26] put forth
[1:50:27] a another little spigot of life it came
[1:50:29] forth according to god one how he wanted
[1:50:32] to do it was her caterpillars and oh and
[1:50:34] locusts and and and those those great
[1:50:36] that great army did it come against the
[1:50:38] church yes it did and god allowed it
[1:50:41] but he allowed his life to stay in the
[1:50:42] roots
[1:50:44] his life never changed and it was hooked
[1:50:46] into the river of water
[1:50:48] friends it was christ hooked into christ
[1:50:51] just the same one that was walking
[1:50:53] through the candlesticks and sharing
[1:50:55] with the and sharing with the seven
[1:50:57] messengers friends it's the same god
[1:51:00] throughout
[1:51:01] all of it
[1:51:02] it's the same god it's the same
[1:51:04] anointing it's the same oil that's in
[1:51:06] that candlestick
[1:51:07] it's
[1:51:08] all of god
[1:51:11] so what are we afraid of what's going on
[1:51:13] no we're not afraid we're basking in his
[1:51:15] presence
[1:51:17] right we're under his anointing the very
[1:51:20] place the spirit of god is coming out we
[1:51:22] are basking in his presence we're
[1:51:23] enjoying what god has for us and we're
[1:51:26] living in laodicea oh how does that work
[1:51:29] it's lukewarm age
[1:51:30] because we're not part of lucia
[1:51:34] the thoughts of god you manifested for
[1:51:35] this age you're not part of laissez
[1:51:38] you may be walking here but you're not
[1:51:40] part of him brother brown tells us we're
[1:51:42] not in heaven yet
[1:51:44] and we don't belong here we're somewhere
[1:51:45] in between
[1:51:47] and we're in this place where god is
[1:51:48] feeding us content and encouraging us to
[1:51:51] tell us who we are and one day
[1:51:54] friends we're going to hear the stage
[1:51:55] coach come in
[1:51:57] and it's going to pull up and what's
[1:51:59] going to happen it's going to take his

[1:52:18] once the cloud you know came and then
[1:52:20] and brother branham noticed there was
[1:52:22] somebody you know that that looked a
[1:52:23] little different than others and he
[1:52:24] recognized who that was that was that
[1:52:26] mighty angel there was others you know
[1:52:28] the other angels in the cloud but there
[1:52:29] was one that looked different than all
[1:52:31] the others friends that was the mighty
[1:52:33] angel
[1:52:34] and he didn't just disappear he's here
[1:52:36] but friends he did promise a physical
[1:52:38] coming
[1:52:39] so he has come but he is coming
[1:52:43] what is he doing right now for the bride
[1:52:45] he's establishing us telling us hey hey
[1:52:47] hey it's you that i'm looking at
[1:52:49] it's you i put all all the eggs in my
[1:52:52] basket for you you are my thoughts
[1:52:55] you are my very expression yes sir so we
[1:52:58] live in late but we're not part of it
[1:53:00] right
[1:53:01] i want nothing to do with legacy
[1:53:03] it's a lukewarm world
[1:53:06] and jesus is saying to us today can you
[1:53:08] hear my thoughts
[1:53:10] can you hear those words come out of her
[1:53:12] my people
[1:53:14] right oh that's for denomination no come
[1:53:16] out of the world man
[1:53:18] come out of the things that don't be
[1:53:19] distracted right don't let some girl out
[1:53:21] there young people or some boy out there
[1:53:23] distract you from the word of who he
[1:53:25] wants you to be
[1:53:26] don't be some fashions or some something
[1:53:29] you know that the devil's showing on on
[1:53:32] on your tablets or your phone someplace
[1:53:33] don't let that distract you
[1:53:36] the bible and the scriptures have called
[1:53:38] to us come out of here my people it's
[1:53:40] time from separate for separation
[1:53:43] from all
[1:53:44] unbelief
[1:53:46] amen i like to underline that all
[1:53:49] unbelief
[1:53:50] you know if you if you know we read in
[1:53:52] the scripture that faith right is a
[1:53:54] mustard seed
[1:53:55] it's really small
[1:53:57] and if you have faith like a mustard
[1:53:59] seed you can remove mountain or move
[1:54:00] mountains you know but on the flip side
[1:54:02] of that coin if you have doubt okay like
[1:54:05] a mustard seed what happens your entire
[1:54:07] life is failing
[1:54:09] so we can't have any doubt according to
[1:54:11] god's word
[1:54:12] if we don't understand that's one thing
[1:54:14] but doubt is another
[1:54:16] so you say it before god lord i don't
[1:54:17] doubt your word your word is the truth i
[1:54:19] just don't understand it reveal it to me
[1:54:24] amen call us out of all unbelief amen
[1:54:28] you know you got to be aware today that
[1:54:30] you are the word made flesh as i said
[1:54:32] you are the very thoughts of god and
[1:54:34] you've got to have your receiving set on
[1:54:35] to be tuned to hear what he has to say i
[1:54:37] wish you could say with me today yes
[1:54:39] lord i'll tune to your word
[1:54:42] i'll tune to your word
[1:54:44] you know
[1:54:45] i struggle many times hearing people's
[1:54:47] thoughts and their meanings but i never
[1:54:49] struggle with god's thoughts
[1:54:51] when he anoints my heart
[1:54:53] now
[1:54:54] we said last evening
[1:54:56] you've got to you've got to meditate
[1:55:00] you've got to pray
[1:55:03] prayer changes things yeah yes that's
[1:55:05] right it's an atomic power
[1:55:08] and you know something you take god's
[1:55:09] word and you read it and it and you hear
[1:55:11] it and then you go to prayer over it all
[1:55:13] of a sudden god begins to reveal the
[1:55:16] picture to you
[1:55:17] and something that had no connection all
[1:55:19] of a sudden there is a connection
[1:55:21] connections to you and so friends today
[1:55:23] i want to encourage you don't disconnect
[1:55:27] you know what's the most annoying thing
[1:55:29] is when uh you don't have wi-fi
[1:55:34] you know i i've got you know this thing
[1:55:36] called shawn go and here on the island i
[1:55:38] have no wi-fi
[1:55:39] and i'm like are you serious i got to
[1:55:40] get hold of brother jonathan i got no
[1:55:42] this connection is not working right it
[1:55:44] is so annoying when you disconnect from
[1:55:47] god
[1:55:48] you know how frustrating that is
[1:55:51] when you've heard the voice of god and
[1:55:52] you know the voice of god
[1:55:54] and there's a disconnect brother brown
[1:55:55] talks about sometimes when he displeased
[1:55:57] god
[1:55:58] and there was a small disconnect for a
[1:56:00] short term time and how frustrating it
[1:56:02] was for him
[1:56:03] and
[1:56:04] the turmoil he went through he had a
[1:56:06] connection with god that i'll never have
[1:56:09] he's the prophet of this age
[1:56:12] but in my small connection with god you
[1:56:13] know how frustrating it is
[1:56:16] and you feel you know
[1:56:18] it's not the time to pull back
[1:56:22] you know the guy you know the guy does
[1:56:24] when he has no wifi
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:56:30] you you can smile my brother i've seen
[1:56:32] i'm sure you do the same right here we
[1:56:34] go
[1:56:35] we get on top the highest mountain right
[1:56:38] looking for wifi and people think we're
[1:56:40] nuts and they look at oh no wi-fi
[1:56:43] right desperation
[1:56:46] can't we do that with our lives
[1:56:48] when you recognize you know what
[1:56:51] you know your wi-fi is not working with
[1:56:52] god can't you realize that you need to
[1:56:54] get to a higher place
[1:56:57] can't you really realize that the higher
[1:56:59] place comes from a lower place on your
[1:57:01] knees
[1:57:02] humbling yourself before god get out get
[1:57:04] in there put you know put yourself in
[1:57:06] like to say and say lord plug yourself
[1:57:07] and say lord reconnect me
[1:57:10] i need a reconnection we want a
[1:57:12] connection from god
[1:57:14] brother brown said in 1954 he says
[1:57:18] that god made with his people i'm not
[1:57:20] interested here to look at i'm not here
[1:57:22] to represent uh i i'm here to sorry he
[1:57:26] says i'm not here to be looked at i'm
[1:57:27] here to represent my blessed redeemer
[1:57:30] and can we say amen
[1:57:31] jesus christ i'm not here
[1:57:33] with swelling words i don't know any
[1:57:38] you know when guys get up and they want
[1:57:39] to you and hey you can see in the crowd
[1:57:41] they want to explain
[1:57:42] you swelling words hey that's not the
[1:57:44] spirit of christ
[1:57:46] the prophet could have done it better
[1:57:47] than anybody you know what he did he
[1:57:48] humbled himself he said i'm not here i'm
[1:57:50] here to represent christ i'm not here to
[1:57:52] do swelling words i don't know any i
[1:57:54] don't care to know any the only thing
[1:57:56] the biggest word that i know is he
[1:57:59] spells it j-e-s-u-s
[1:58:02] why could he say that because he was so
[1:58:05] connected with j-u-s-u-s
[1:58:09] he says here we can't
[1:58:11] we find we can't find him in a fine
[1:58:13] lecture because if we par if we find
[1:58:15] people who could stand up and can
[1:58:17] explain the word in such a way
[1:58:19] that it's
[1:58:20] breathtaking but when we find it it's
[1:58:23] still in when we find it it's still just
[1:58:26] a lecture see just a lecture it's
[1:58:29] mechanics
[1:58:31] and when we find the entertainer who can
[1:58:34] go all through all the actions and so
[1:58:36] forth but still isn't it it isn't what
[1:58:39] we're looking for
[1:58:40] so i take away from that we're not
[1:58:42] looking for an intellectual man
[1:58:45] we're not looking for entertainers what
[1:58:47] we're looking for is the thoughts of god
[1:58:50] expressed and how is that expressed it
[1:58:52] takes he says the mechanics and the
[1:58:54] dynamics in his word in his spirit that
[1:58:58] they're one together living on a life
[1:59:03] so
[1:59:04] i take away from all of this that you
[1:59:06] are the mechanics in dynamics
[1:59:08] well we always want to say wow the word
[1:59:10] has got to present it yes it's mechanics
[1:59:12] and dynamics yes and i got a quote for
[1:59:14] you just said we got the power of the
[1:59:15] holy ghost and as it come to feed the
[1:59:17] machine it needs to be mechanics and
[1:59:18] dynamics but hang on a sec if you are
[1:59:20] the thoughts of god
[1:59:22] if you are the word express if you're
[1:59:24] the logos for the hour
[1:59:27] okay then you are the mechanics and
[1:59:29] dynamics
[1:59:31] then you have the word
[1:59:34] in its fullness in you and out
[1:59:36] presenting to the people
[1:59:40] then you carry the king's sword amen
[1:59:42] okay then you have the adoption ring
[1:59:44] upon your finger we always want to no
[1:59:46] then you're ready for the rapture
[1:59:50] oh brother steve i don't know it's time
[1:59:51] for us to get into rapture condition
[1:59:54] and if you're skipping communion you're
[1:59:56] not ready that's right
[1:59:58] oh the churches get thin on communion
[2:00:01] now nowadays you know it's taking it it
[2:00:03] used to take a solid hour and a half to
[2:00:05] get through people and communion and
[2:00:06] foot washing
[2:00:07] now it's just so fast we just do it
[2:00:10] because people aren't sure they're ready
[2:00:11] anymore
[2:00:13] right and they don't want it more than
[2:00:14] you know every four months
[2:00:16] because there's a challenge to their
[2:00:18] life are you ready well i'm not sure i
[2:00:20] just watched that movie
[2:00:22] i just listened to that music
[2:00:24] i just read that book i just desired to
[2:00:27] have that outfit that wasn't godly and
[2:00:29] all of a sudden we begin to realize oh
[2:00:31] my goodness i'm not ready well that's
[2:00:32] not the time
[2:00:34] okay to get weak no that's the time to
[2:00:36] run before god
[2:00:37] again and say lord look i i'm just sorry
[2:00:42] that's all god wants to hear from you he
[2:00:43] loves you remember what brother branham
[2:00:45] said there's more pressure in that pipe
[2:00:46] okay he have his desire of love for you
[2:00:49] than all of the world
[2:00:51] right the all the waters of the world
[2:00:53] and that how big of a pipe did he see
[2:00:55] that small little pipe he put all the
[2:00:56] all the waters in that word i imagine
[2:00:58] the pressure he has more desire for you
[2:01:00] than all that pressure yeah amen do you
[2:01:02] think he doesn't want to forgive you
[2:01:03] absolutely he wants to forgive you
[2:01:05] that's why he gave you that desire for
[2:01:07] him okay to see where you're wrong and
[2:01:09] that you could come before him so that
[2:01:11] you can once again become that
[2:01:13] reflection that he desires you to be so
[2:01:16] don't don't the satan that confuses you
[2:01:18] satan that speaks to you satan that
[2:01:20] desires you to keep you out of
[2:01:21] fellowship don't stay out of fellowship
[2:01:24] get into fellowship when a sheep goes by
[2:01:26] itself it is singled out and then and
[2:01:29] the wolves and the lions and the bears
[2:01:32] can destroy the sheep but if the sheep
[2:01:34] stay together
[2:01:36] amen
[2:01:37] then nothing can come against them
[2:01:39] and then the great shepherd takes care
[2:01:43] if you're running today
[2:01:44] that great shepherd will leave the 99
[2:01:47] and find you and let me tell you what he
[2:01:49] does once he finds you he loves you
[2:01:52] but you know what he does in love he
[2:01:53] breaks your leg
[2:01:56] and then he mends your leg
[2:01:58] he puts you around his shoulders and
[2:02:00] carries you feeds you personally until
[2:02:02] you get such a love for that great
[2:02:04] shepherd
[2:02:05] that when he puts you down again you'll
[2:02:07] never leave the full but you know what
[2:02:08] it's pain so let me tell you right now
[2:02:10] don't you don't have to go through that
[2:02:12] process
[2:02:14] you don't have to come through this
[2:02:15] thing of broken-heartedness no

[2:05:48] we're going to stand when we leave this
[2:05:49] place we'll be one step better to
[2:05:52] showing the rest of this world wherever

[2:34:47] something
[2:34:48] some something you know just a prayer
[2:34:51] just a short prayer say lord i need this
[2:34:54] and you know i need this
[2:34:56] and i was outside the house and and i
[2:34:58] came in there she was in tears because
[2:35:00] god answered her right there on the spot
[2:35:02] right
[2:35:03] and you know you'd look at it and say
[2:35:05] well you know
[2:35:06] it wasn't a big thing but it was a big
[2:35:08] thing to god our little things sometimes
[2:35:10] are big things to god right and we'll
[2:35:13] just humble ourselves and let god
[2:35:15] just just talk to god about it and
[2:35:18] and you just be amazed at what he'll do
[2:35:20] for you

[2:35:48] of god
[2:35:49] you know he cares about the big things

[3:40:31] we're starting to think uh you know once
[3:40:33] for breakfast
[3:40:36] but you know we uh we want to thank the
[3:40:38] lord and uh for all that he's done for
[3:40:40] us and we can't thank him enough anders
[3:40:43] i can tell you that now
[3:40:45] so let's sing just a chorus and uh i'll
[3:40:48] try to close but uh this is up to the
[3:40:51] lord he's
[3:40:52] i watched him manipulate a lot of my
[3:40:54] songs around tonight i just put him
[3:40:56] right in place
[3:40:57] put him right in place right and uh
[3:41:00] i've seen them do that before to me and
[3:41:03] i said to brenda on the way home last
[3:41:04] night i said i don't even know why i
[3:41:06] write so write down
[3:41:08] songs
[3:41:09] at the end for the end of the song very
[3:41:11] i'm sorry for after the service
[3:41:13] after printing uh preaching i'll get it
[3:41:16] right
[3:41:17] begins with a p
[3:41:20] but i wonder i wonder sometimes why i do
[3:41:23] it and i guess in my own mind it's
[3:41:25] you know just some backup if i need it
[3:41:27] right but uh very seldom do i sing them
[3:41:30] because
[3:41:32] because god lays songs on my heart while
[3:41:35] the ministry is preaching
[3:41:37] and it takes me a total different
[3:41:38] direction sometimes it doesn't happen
[3:41:40] all the time but it takes me totally
[3:41:42] away from that and when i get home and i
[3:41:43] look at the songs i got written down and
[3:41:45] said well they do that for okay because
[3:41:47] god is the song leader
[3:41:49] it's got nothing to do with me i'm just
[3:41:51] up here
[3:41:52] you know somebody got to call the
[3:41:53] numbers up but that's that's you know
[3:41:56] it's this is god this whole message this
[3:41:59] whole christian life it's not about us
[3:42:01] it's about god it's god alpha god omega
[3:42:04] it's all about him and everything in
[3:42:05] between
[3:42:07] we're the
[3:42:09] the cast members in this play and he's
[3:42:11] just moving us
[3:42:12] around he knows the end from the
[3:42:14] beginning
[3:42:15] right and and you know he's just in
[3:42:17] control of this whole thing
[3:42:19] so forget it if you think you're making
[3:42:21] the decisions
[3:42:22] he's got it all made he's all got it all
[3:42:24] done
[3:42:26] bless the lord i just think it's
