Lord not only here in this assembly but to those online and praying the grace of God to each brother and each sister in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ's father that you administer to them father

Lord Jesus Christ Lord the blessing they're going for the viewer word increase our faith amen these last days for your glory for your honor for your praise in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Lord Alleluia build us up in the most holy faith in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen let's say now I believe all things are possible [Music] [Music] all things are possible now I believe [Music] the all things are possible now I aim at praise the Lord Lord bless and again determine with me to the Book of Psalms chapter 57 I've read done the last service I read Psalms 91 and a number of the believers concerning a number of believers that had that had highlighted it and I was I was surprised not just the regular believers but there was a number of pastors message ministries online and that I had heard just just touched in to hear what they were ministering on and they mentioned Psalms 91 oh yeah I believe those brother might have been brother Chad lamb Psalm 91 brother Tim Pruett Psalms 91 brother Tony brother Donnie Reagan rather sobs that he won and I said Lord and also I've received an email from her brother a million and an elderly brother and again not a not necessarily a message believer but a gentleman that I have known for many many years and just to say that he had emailed me and exec sortation concerning the word concerning the Lord and when I went down through it I said well praise the Lord he mentioned Psalms 91 a man and also I mentioned brother Karsan mentioned Psalms 91 and brother Carson's the emphasis was that the emergency number is 911 well he said we'll go to 91 1 he said Psalms and he said that's the emergency call of the Lord trust the Lord a man and the Lord would be there to deliver us a man and so and after of course when I got almond on after that service I received an email from our sister Maureen and she had referenced Psalms 57 a man and again the promise of Psalms 91 is similar to Psalm 57 a man so the faith that David had we pray that we got a man that our faith is in God praise the Lord so let's read Psalms 57 and me just before just to bring greetings to the Saints here and those online from our brother makandal he called last evening and I spoke to him for a while on the phone and he was requesting a quote that I have already shared with the Saints here and I guess he must have known about it and it was had to do with germ warfare and he said buzzy said I want I want to copy that quote and so I sent him that one from 1954 and 1960 so just bear bear in mind that the baba didn't just say it in 54 and but he also mentioned again referenced it again in 1960 concerning the germ warfare and that's what you and i are witnessing in the world today and that's why that we are we are in this situation of just four of a series of four or five of us here in the church and the others online home amen and not only here but it's the same thing in I believe in our brother Tim Pruitt's and our brother Donnie Reagan's and other churches in the United States amen now I don't know if you know about one Church there that is not not a message Church not by any means but the pastor at five hundred in the congregation but he didn't he didn't take the advice of the of the government in the United States and he just kept this congregation of 500 he still gathered them and he got arrested and and I'm not he was in jail I don't know if he's still in jail or not but they and so on so we pray the grace of God to him to give him maybe the wisdom that he needs Amen because this has nothing to do with what we're teaching and what we believe no not by any means you know but but it's just just for the safety and the health and welfare of those that go to the church or others that they would meet you know and so on so we pray the grace of to that brother and to the assembly a man then they'll have the wisdom of God a man I'm sure that that Jesus would follow the same why live render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and it's not contrary to the will of God or the Word of God not by any means especially if we got online streaming a man no the back years ago we have read that you know and many didn't have it but again brother Brown said he said God God ordained the invention of the of the recorder the tape recorder and what was it it was the big one the reel-to-reel you know because that was the first record riot and and a brother in in in no Brunswick bought my first recorder for me name and we had the reel to reels that's what we used in will be add cottage means in gamble and some in Buren was the reel-to-reel some years ago and the Provost said God he said predestinated and for Dane that the invention of that tape recorder he said for the message of the hour yeah he said that way back in the in 1940 or the early 1950s he referenced it you can check that online and so God ordained the invention of the tape recorder happenin God also wanted the invention of the online streaming they meant because he knew it was going to come to this place a man he knew that we would have to deal with these situations and these circumstances amen but where would that excuse Amen to say well I can't hear the word and I can't do this and I can't do that oh yes you can because God it got it got will point to point you to that online streaming he meant by the grace of God so we pray we thank God for that amen praise the Lord we know that the recordings have gone beyond just just the old fashioned tapes and so on can't beyond that for sure and I witnessed it and in me even in my life so god help us and God be with us as we go to the word and as the brothers and sisters online are hearing the word a man not only here but even even around the world by grace the Lord bless you in Psalms chapter 57 and again god bless our brother at Macondo amen and verse 1 be merciful unto me O God be merciful unto me praise the Lord for my soul trusts it in thee yay in the shadow of thy wings well I make my refuge until these calamities be over past well brother trust it's going to get worse does something if this passes something else that's going to come a man what's the for it's for destinated is for ordained what for to get us to look up he said when this happens when that happens and means arts are fading for fear but not the bright and all you're encouraged look up because the day of your Redemption draws nigh a man so brother sister let's not let's not God let's not have the wrong reaction to what's going on this adds a scriptural what biblical word reaction to what's going on oh the world is reacting this way reacting that way and and I don't know if you noticed it but we have words so little about God we were so little about the Lord you know when it comes to all concerning all that's going on and this one's experiencing this there's experiencing that one but I've got to say in the last couple of days or yesterday and maybe today I've heard some mentioned the Lord oh yeah and they were interviewing no just a couple there because the woman her husband was in a hospital and that he had he had contacted this the virus and so on but I believe by grace of God he was recovering and they're interviewing his wife and and after they finished the interview they were going to finish the interview and they said thank you and all she said just one moment she said I've got I want to say this and she thanked the Lord hey man I said god bless her a man she thanked the Lord she thanked God and for her husband and for touching her husband and so on and forever being with them oh yeah and then there was another young man and he was part of a young couple that was in in Ireland I believe it was and they came back and he had contacted it but God delivered him and anyone wanted to give the glory to God I said well thank the Lord Alleluia most I said 99% never mentioned God at all but only that 1% just referenced God thank God thank God praise God Oh a man so brother/sister God helpless because it's God that is delivering us is God giving us victory and it said that again let me read it be merciful unto me O God be merciful unto me for my soul trusted in thee yay in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be over past our faith is in God I will cry unto God most died unto God that performed with all things for me please let's help us that God help us to have that faith in God and he shall sin from Evan and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up that's the devil the reproach of him that was swallow me up for David and might even somebody else that he was dealing with but for us we're dealing with the god of this evil age and that is the devil a man and he said he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up Selah God shall send for these mercy and is truth my soul is among lions and I lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are Spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword be thou exalted O God above the heavens and let thy glory be above all the earth amen they have prepared a net for my steps and my soul is bow down they have digged a pit before me in the midst whereof they are fallen themselves Selah and my heart is fixed oh god my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise I pray our hearts are fixed on him a wake up my glory awake psaltery and harp I myself will awake early Alleluia I will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the nations god help us as those were praising God in the midst of all that's going on they were praising God for what he did is grace to them God Alba sir praise God for what he's revealed to us and for the hope that he has given us I will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto the among the nation's for thy mercy is great under the heavens and thy truth under the clouds neither exalted O God above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth God bless his words you may be seated amen praise the name of the Lord turn with me to the book of Galatians the Galatians chapter 1 we started this series with one of these from scriptures and the Lord willing I'm hoping to be able to conclude the thoughts on the god of this evil age that is the message itself there is another message that I want to highlight and that I want to share with you concerning as this is the one that he preached after this and it is Satan's Eden he's talking to me giving us the revelation of the god of this evil age and then giving us a further revelation that as God had put Adam and Eve in in in the Garden of Eden so the devil now is putting his that of an is Eve in a Garden of Eden a man but it is Satan see not God's Eden so god help us that were not going to be blind to the revelation of the god of this evil age and we're not going to be blind to the revelation that the world is experiencing Satan's Eden a man so God have mercy on us and brother God is allowing all of these things to come to pass he's allowing all these things to happen because why because the world has to come under the power the anointing and the control of Antichrist amen always well this is not business this is not going to bring the Antichrist it will bring the Antichrist on the scene it will cause all the nations eventually to turn everything over to the Antichrist a man because I totally if this is doing anything is putting all nations on the same level that's exactly so it's not this nation above that one that one above that one down one down there that God is bringing them all down a man this is why he's allowing that the enemy to do this he's allowing the enemy to do that it's to put them all on the same level and he'll bring them all under the control of the Antichrist and that is the absolute truth amen because I have prayed and I have been asking the Lord or why are you allowing this what's going on Lord what's this going to lead to and basically this is what it's going to lead to a man to the control of the Antichrist amen because they're not dirt again they're not giving the glory to God then I the glories of Christ then I did not call me on the Lord they're not calling you on our Lord Jesus Christ and not by any means but brother it's going to it's going to come to pass that they are they're going to be deceived by the god of this evil age a man then they're going to be deceived by the Antichrist and that will be the basically it will be the god of this evil age in flesh a man in the beginning was the word the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us well brother sister now it's coming to the place where the Antichrist is made flesh oh yeah correct Christ was made flesh now the Antichrist is made place and that's why that now he is the god of this evil age because he wanted to be like God a man I'm gonna be this I'm gonna be that I will do this I will do that I will ascend above the most sigh amen I will be like the Most High amen and then and then goddess well oh yeah but he did this no God permitted it a man God permitted it for a reason brother what God does God is God is allowing these guys allowing that on the one hand it's against akechi select on the other end it's it's tiket see that is there this serpents eat a million so I trust were the seat of God and brother I tell you that God got this and God allows that this is going to get the attention of his seat and the other is going to get to change the Serpent's eat a man oh my brother one is going to worship Almighty God and the other was going to worship the impersonation of God a man and Satan is there to impersonate God that's right brother and brother he's doing it and not only that but I tell you this he has become an object of worship they think they're worshiping Almighty God they think they're worshiping Elohim they think they're worshiping Jesus but they're worshiping the devil amen that's exactly the truth and brother is not God Almighty God that's influencing them it is the god of this evil age that is influencing their thoughts their words and their deeds a man the life they live the thoughts are thinking and what they're talking it's the influence of the god of this evil age and and oh yeah it's but it's deceiving it's not it's not going to be thinking or talking about devilish words we call it no no it's gonna be it's going to be impersonation personating God impersonating the word a man so brother sister god help us that we're not going to get caught up and caught away with the false revelation of the word a man there is a truth and there's a false revelation of the truth brother and have brother prove it in the word go right on back to Genesis and right on back to the Garden of Eden a man and there was the word and there was an impersonation of the word a man because God gave Adam the word and the devil came and interpreted to Eve and brother he didn't take away the word he added to the word a man hallelujah mother thank God for that revelation to put us on our guard that the enemy is not taking away the word taking a ray the message taking away these revelations what he's going to do is yeah yeah yes God said yes God said this is this is the truth concerning this doctrine and that doctor that doctrine but I say unto you and he'll just maybe add a word or take away a word here they're a man and brother we've got the witness of that down through the ages not only Old Testament but New Testament as we went through any when we were in the last service and in the last message we went through revelation to show you the deeds of the Nicolaitans a man it was the influence of the Antichrist spirit coming into the church a man that Christ had come into the church and after Christ came into the church Antichrist came into the church a man God Christ was there and then the devil came there to impersonate him the devil came there to say yeah as God said yes God said but I say unto you a man and they believed what the devil was saying that is the truth and brother my because they sounded to me right it's oh yeah it's the word it's the word yeah it was the word but Satan added to the word a man as same was bringing the people what was he doing he was bringing the people out from under the influence of God's leadership to the influence of Antichrist leadership that is the truth brother you go back to the first stage you can go back to Revelation chapter 2 you can go back 2,000 years to the first church age and we'll see that's exactly what the enemy did that's what he was doing that's what he did a man because God had given the word a man stay with the word thus saith the Lord a man and but then enemy came in and he began to impersonate the truth even to impersonate a man what the disciples the Apostles the prophets amen yes God said but oh yeah they did they'll tell you this but they won't tell you this but the devil's lot is lying to them amen because they're going to receive the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth but the enemy comes into a head to that truth a man and remember oh well oh brother but they're false they're false wait a wait a minute the truth is the truth but see the thing of it is as the enemy has added this and added that a man something that it to make it more fault more take the power away from it to take the anointing away from amen so they're control brother they were no longer under God's control they came more and more under Satan's control amen and under the control of main sissie it's and well the devil did don't use man yes he did it wasn't the devil just coming down to Eve no no mother sister what are you he went he used the serpent and the serpent was was that was the brook was the link between between the man and and the beast that's right this way why scientists don't understand about creation why because they can't they don't they don't recognize the missing link well they think oh well you know man started here and he went on and on and on but they don't have the missing link between man and beast it's not as now it wasn't Adam no it was the serpent and he and the prophet of God has highlighted the fact he says the serpent was an upright creature like a man hey man that's right and that's that's who the serpent as who the devil was using to deceive Eve a man and again as where we have been a lie we have been given the understanding that it was so close to man that his seed would mingle with the woman hey man that's right so brother sister what the enemy was doing there now the enemy is doing here then what the enemy was doing there the enemy was doing down in this hour and this H in the a in the last day a man he was endeavoring to deceive man then and he's endeavoring to deceive man no a man and brother not coming with oh well no it's all false all false no it'll be 99% truth or sometimes it'll be a hundred percent truth plus a little false 101 percent amen because they'll add to it or take away brother no wonder that God said in in the beginning in the end in the last oh yeah in in the in Revelation chapter 22 and concerning I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book a man they've added to the word and brother this is why we're seeing what we're seeing happening in the earth yeah and he said if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book amen so brother if we add to it if we take trouble it got God as God is going to do this is gonna do that sir brother gotcha take your part out of the book of life amen so god help us brother to stay with the truth and the whole truth not add to it not take from it a man you guys God is gonna bring what's God going to require of us he gonna require exactly what he has revealed to us a man so that what we believe God we believe what he's revealed we believe what he has given us a man and because it's exactly according to the to the word here amen and amen we're not going to let the devil add to it we're not gonna let the devil take away from it the whole truth nothing but the truth amen but Lord we're brothers sister we are living in an hour we're living in an age where in many are adding to the message and they're taking away from the message oh yes they might take away this they'll add this and the prophet of God is highlighting what the god of this evil age is doing and causing and causing even so-called believers you know they'll do this they'll do this they'll do that or they'll refuse to do this refuse to do that and still think they're believers a man when God is looking for what the word the whole truth nothing but the truth a man reflected in you a man in so that what this is what you're looking for this is what you're believing this is what your talk talk talking to witnessing about this is what your praising the Lord for it is the truth the whole truth nothing but that don't add to it don't take from it so that you we think oh well I'll believe it this way so that I don't have to worry about this I don't have to worry about that you believe it this way you you can believe it a certain way oh yeah the truth you can believe it a certain way and it will bring no conviction in your heart and your you you can go out and just live a casual life you can live a religious life and not be convicted one because you're believing it the way you want to believe it you got to believe it the way God wants you to believe it amen don't don't have a different attitude to it not by any maids you stay with the truth a man and a man you judge everything by the word you know you think it Oh that's not according to the word Lord forgive me amen and if you know it you believe it you're gonna line up with it oh yeah you're gonna line up with the truth you're gonna stay with the truth amen amen no matter what you me and my yours gonna be gonna cost cost us something oh yeah oh yeah might cost your family might cost your friends might cost your neighbors might cost you your job I don't know but it cost you something but are you willing to pay the price in really concerning the price that Jesus paid we water we really what are we willing to sacrifice oh well I don't think God wants to do this sort of what that's the devil telling you that oh yeah he's lying to you what for you because he's trying to try in a week weaken your faith he's trying to weaken your conviction oh yeah so that you're not worried about this and I worried with that oh no oh I don't think God would want me to do this I don't think I wanted God wants you to stake your stain for the truth amen whether consider whether you I wasn't in a place they paid right from Genesis right answer it a revelation the price they paid in taking their stand for the truth you taking their stand with the word amen are we willing to pay that price oh well you mean to tell me that we're going to be kidding killed no no no not necessarily physically not like like they were killed but we're going to pay a price you may lose family friends neighbors I don't know you'll be separated because of your stand for the word the truth any man but the part of God did say I thank God for what he said but there's gonna be friends of the bride amen why because the bride is gonna be so separated that God has ordained and predestinated to be friends in that generation that age amen well that they'll be there for the bride they'll be there to encourage boy just get son all right don't worry about that you know we got nothing against you and we respect you and so on only there be friends of the bride by the grace of God but brother this come under let's meet come under stay under God's influence elohim's influence but not the influence of the god of the evil age a man but yet he's influencing a lot of so-called believers a man to compromise here compromise there with the truth with the message a man oh yeah see listen God God God brought this is why God did what he did down through the church ages he brought us out of this and what what brought them out it was a greater revelation amen brother because the enemy came in and they and made a mini denomination out of it but then God came down with a greater revelation and the anointing of the Holy Ghost hello they came out oh yeah and they went on with God they made a denomination of it and and then yeah and the anointing was God so oh so God came back again in another revival in another age a man with a greater revelation and they came out again the elect a mout a man the elect the others were still religious and they stayed there oh yeah they condemned they can end the ones that that separated they can name the ones that walked out and felt though they did they had a greater revelation and God they were following God's leadership a million so brother comes right on down through the last age until finally we Christ is put out you know that in the last church age he was put out and then he was calling for his elect always said you think you're this you think you're that the church he said but you're rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and he said and you're miserable Richard blowing poor naked oh yeah they thought this he said but this is the truth and so he begin to begin the knock and call for the right a man he said to come unto me praise the name of the Lord to call us out but brother we're not going on like God called about in one age they went on to another age went on to another age but he's called the bride out and she's going on to Eternity amen we're going on to the resurrection we're going on to the rapture by the grace of Almighty God amen God Elvis to believe God Elvis to to have there AB the rebel God wants us to have so that were not deceived by the god of this evil age and there were not under the influence of the god of the sea village yeah what what is the interval as the results of that influence compromise yeah compromise he's not gonna cut sake oh you don't believe this yeah and you're gonna disbelieve the word just believe the message just believe that and you just could have wandered into the world no no some will but for the majority they'd gonna cut they're gonna eat gonna influence them to compromise on the world hey man he's gonna get him away from the from the anointing of the word just to just to the intellectual knowledge of the word and I brought that out the Prophet brought it out even in this message he said we are get your moving to your going he said with the you with the knowledge of the message the message he said you're in the message but the message is not in you amen what brought you to the message it was intellectual knowledge like you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost revelation of the word the message is in you amen and the life you live is the word the life you live is Jesus oh my this is tremendous this is a challenge to our faith mine am i living the life of Jesus amen I'm I'm I'm reflecting Jesus not talking about him but living him a man living his life so that he's living his life in you he's living his life in me and brothers your attitude in your spirit is Jesus attitude it is this is tremendous it is a challenge to the faith of the bride in the end time listen if God is looking for any faith in this hour and this age he's looking for a perfect faith amen well brother Luther had faith and the measure that he had that was perfect yeah but yet there was there was a greater revelation that would take us on to the resurrection and rapture but Luther brother it took him on to believe Alleluia that if he died he'd rise again but not the rapture and so on all down through the ages all down through the ages what God gave them gave the faith to lay down their lives knowing that they're gonna pick it up again because what they're gonna lay down their lives in Christ a man and really they're not they're not dead but it comes to say that they don't know anything if you dip they lay down their the dead in Christ rather I'll tell you this said god help us to have understanding the dead in Christ whether they're very conscious of another dimension oh yeah they are when it comes to dead or dead and what are physically as to the people of the world and those that they live with oh they're dead yeah they died in Christ yeah and and ER and they're gone on into a theophany body by the grace of God their physical bodies are gone their physical bodies are dead but I tell you that the spiritual is still much life yeah it's like I said where did Moses in there and a and a and Elijah come from those that Jesus saw and though and the Old Testament Saints they arose they come back because the power of God said they were down there in the place called Paradise and and he said Jesus wouldn't went down there and he just rebuked the others that didn't believe but then he went over he said open the door ISA for the old Saints to come out come on yeah well oh yeah I'm the one that Moses talked about I'm the one that the no one was preaching about I know I'm that that it does a not believed a man and brother they came they came up with Jesus and they went into the city it appeared on too many by the grace of Almighty God God Elba's that were under God's influence amai and the god of the word the god of glory not the god of this evil age yeah god help us brother sister a man unfortunately brother before it's all over the brightest sy the pronto God said and I and I quote a found a quote again another quote where he said if there there might be 800 there might be 500 what living Saints that'll be changed and going to rapture another time he said it might be a dozen why because he was seeing less and less and less who were staying his less and less that had become one with the word they were just religious and lucky like I said he preached into his own church even they say yes even this dis message under God of this evil age he's preaching to his own assembling he's preaching to believers yeah he when he went out there and preached he said oh yeah he just he was pretty gist but filling filling this fill in that but there's there's some things he wouldn't preach but when he got him on believers he preached the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen and he laid it in as hard as he could oh yeah and brothers anything we need is hard preaching oh yeah we only we don't need like like preaching out there we don't need like you're preaching Oh God like brother Ron would preach out there to those that were mixed up and so on in different denominations and different different ideas and so on no but when he when he got together to preach to the truth to the to the bride no no he laid it in oh yeah because he knew what the bride needed brother it says anything we need is that word lady and so hard that it's coming it's going to separate us from the foolishness of the world amen oh my god like our brother Barry pre priest here when he was here one time before but God taken the taking the rock and he said what is gonna make the house with or he make his temple with whatever and he takes it and what he got to do with it he's got a he's got it he's got a deform it he got her straightened it out he got to chop this off and chop that off why he said because it's gotta fit right in here hey they gotta fit in there hey man my brother do you fit in I'll tell you if you don't fit in he's gonna be working on you hey man if we don't fit in for the rapture he's gonna be working more and more and more and more on us what for to get away from get a get take away from us anything that the god of this evil age has influenced us maybe your thoughts how you think maybe your words how'd you talk maybe maybe you're DS how you live oh yeah oh well I live like a sinner wait a minute don't live like a sinner again you gotta you couldn't have 99% of the truth and you go and reflect to 99% of the truth you can go to live this this part of the mess that part of the message but yet depth could be one thing one attitude one spirit or one word or saw something a man that could be contrary to the word contrary to the will of God contrary to God's nature in you oh yeah this shows then that is not coming from the soul is from the outside you got the anointing outwardly but not in your soul god help us brothers my prayer amen so that we're under the influence of Almighty God hello him where words that but were not under the influence of the god of this evil age he man grace to us brother can I tell you that the world is deceived by the god of this evil age churches are deceived by the god of this evil age a man and that's why that jesus warned us that if he didn't shorten time there'd be no flesh saved a man such a deception of the god of this evil age they be so under the influence of the god of this evil age grace to us grace then we're going to be fanatics to the world we're gonna be cut off from the world hallelujah that we're going to be all mine it's a big statement god help us we're gonna be Christ in flesh what Jesus in flesh no no oh Jesus thank you for saving me Lord they give it well if I save you son I'll be in you if I say to you I'll be reflected in you I'll be me pleasuring you what I am I'm going to be in you how many I tell me how many believers have we met how many but errors do we know are reflecting Jesus Christ they had the attitude of Jesus the spirit of Jesus the life of Jesus the words of Jesus amen god help us grace sorry amen thank you brother there's not many to fall asleep and there are those that fall asleep I won't seal a man maybe they'll let it go onto the computer shuts down Galatians chapter 1 Galatians chapter 1 and reading verse 1 Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and there are believers who are of man that's right and they're by man but by the grace of God we are to be believers by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead a man so we're here not because of this the influence of man but it's the influence of the Holy Ghost a man I'd not follow a man by following Jesus yes that's right sister oh it's a trace of challenge to our faith are we following man are following Jesus who called us was it man or Jesus oh brother so-and-so's oh this one is that way yeah but losing control him or Jesus oh yes brother hey man just too many or follow up man is following man that's right I'll tell you this if your seeds of seed of God you're following Jesus ain't bad what we's what is it you saw God in that brother you saw God in in this one or that one amen and you were following not the person no you're following the word that they were testifying up by the grace of God hallelujah and he said in all the brethren which are with me on to the churches of Galatia grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins a man that he might deliver us from this present evil world praise the Lord according to the will of God and our Father a man to whom be glory for ever and ever amen and he said I marble a man he would say the same today and he said I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel just think I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there's be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ and there are many that are perverting the message of the hour that's right now I tell you what they came out of they've gone back into a denominational spirit oh yeah and again it was many years ago that I heard our brother Bisco when I was in Alberta and the Convention and our brother Bisco preached the the last message of the convention and he said it's amazing but he said we have to acknowledge the truth he said what we came out of he said now we're dealing with the same spirits again even Easter denominational spirits he said among the people denominational spirits among believers a man brother what we came out of he said we are dealing with him and those spirits again and this the enemy is the god of this evil age it's his influence please if we see the brother do this or sister do that all mine are they believers well no they profess to be but they're under Satan's influence and that's why they're not living the life of a believer but the life of an unbeliever that is the truth what do around the message like that around they'd be on our guard hey Miriam grace and he said buddies he see they were dealing with it then and that's why before Paul left the scene he warned us over and over and over again about false apostles false prophets Paul says Paul said that would come to deceive the people and that would be Satan's influence amen brother as he came in the Garden of Eden a man for the six thousand years ago so at the beginning of the church ages Satan was on the scene a man to deceive and the brother there was to reduce to spirits back back here in the beginning even in the Ephesian age and brother doors were dealing with those same spirits that's why it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller a man for years believers believers put their less unless unless unless a man why because Satan is getting more and more influence down through the ages god help us a man that we come out this day out with brother what we follow come out for the word Christ in the word the truth it was giving us faith a man for the resurrection faith for the rapture brother the fate brought us out but God continues to add to that faith a man so he can do what he wants to do through you see God gave God gave them faith so that it's a lot so that he could do what he wanted to do in that age and in this age that are not true and we know that there was a dark ages and God said I will restore saith the Lord and he got he came in gave them the faith that Luther hit and it took him on to Wesley and and the puppet of God said after Wesley it's like I did I saw that before I asked an elderly brother concerning William Booth in the Salvation Army and what part that they played in the church ages and he didn't have a clue he said I have no idea I had no idea I said haven't you heard the message yeah message I've never heard nothing but that but it did it's there because the Potter God said that he said in Luther's age and brought them a little brother Luther's age into the Westeros age and he's within weather with the revelation that God had ordained for Wesley of sanctification and he said but he said the Methodist Issa door deigned and be denominated so quickly he said that God had to raise up William Booth he said with red-hot salvation he said what for and he should be said to take it on to the Pentecostal revival a man and brother as I said I got I got the messages and sermons in writing a William Booth and even his wife I think her name was Catherine and brother I turned it is nearing the end of her their ministry they were pointing the people to Calvary took it to Pentecost near the end of their ministry they were pointing the people to the day of Pentecost and oh yeah they were preaching they said listen they said what they add on the day of Pentecost that's what we need today they were preaching that in the army they were breaching it oh yeah and what fourth is exactly if the prophecy God raised him up to take it on to the Pentecostal revival a man and brother where are we going now where are we going now Brooklyn not it's Betty Goss is over with that's done the gifts are here the prodigal sir there's just on the Shelf if you need them the baptism of the Holy Ghost I trust by the grace of God you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul hey man what's the word where's that taking us he's taking us on beyond not Pentecostal revival no was going on to the bride revival hey man and the brighter Bible is taking us on to the rapture by the grace of God amen brother oh praise the Lord John gave us this faith this faith this faith anybody the Pentecostal faith of the Pentecostal revival and now he's given us the faith of the bride revival and it's perfect date because the prophet of God preached perfect faith yeah it might have been just before you preached this or right after he preached this perfect faith amen and he also emphasized that the opening of the mystery of God the seven seals is giving us perfect faith rats repay ya oh it gave Luther the faith of justification and Wesley the faith of sanctification and again the Pentecost was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit but we got beyond it now why I witnessed that I was part of that the end of it the Pentecostal revival the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen but in 1965 late 65 early 66 God brought me to the bride revival yeah oh yeah I was praising God for the Pentecostal revival I was praising God for the gifts of the Spirit I was praising God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and as I said I can tell you right now because I can see it right now when I I felt that God filled me with the Holy Ghost he baptized him with the Holy Ghost amen it was in that house that we were living in on amyl Street a man and I and I could go if that houses would not change the inside I could go right to the room upstairs where I was praying and I was praying and I was prayed a man and I had the I was now I was kneeling down in prayer and then I got out and I I felt the power of God I felt the anointing of God the presence of God Oh hallelujah I said Lord thank you Jesus amen I felt the power they don t go right down into my soul amen and I was praising God and shouting I said thank you Jesus thank you thank you for the wrapped ism of the Holy Ghost amen to become a new creature in Christ a man a man and then that was in 1965 now and in 1966 brother Joe I got some good news what's that God has set a prophet I said what yes God has set a profit to do this to do this to do I said wonderful praise the Lord yes she said he's the messenger to the Lotus enh a man to take us on to perfection by the grace of God oh it's a wonderful praise the Lord amen that's why I'm pretty I'm ministering what I'm ministering tonight that's what I believe what I believe in the night a man as I said I was rebaptised in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in July of level was of 1966 thank God praise the name of the Lord people would wouldn't think well about 66 because well the probably God said maybe so you could make my name 666 he said but he said I'm he said I don't live on seven hills and neither do i hey man thank the Lord so brother let's stay with the word God in and God revealed it's in simplicity amen so the Lord Alba's rather that were not to be too saved by the god of this evil age because he's going to be so deceiving as the Bible says so it's gonna be so bad it would deceive the very elect impossible that is that serious deceive the elect that are still even the word believe in this believe in that yeah but he's gonna come and preach this and preach this and all y'all is it's gonna be 99% truth or a hundred percent and 101 so on percent true amen and yea and many a believers going to follow this preacher that preacher this apostle that a pasta oh yeah this evangelist that avenges well you have to be careful as I said when you go online and you listen to preachers be careful oh no he's a good preacher is he the devil is a good preacher oh yeah we mean he's good well he's so good a preacher he's influenced a lot over the ages oh yeah you go right on back to the beginning why he preaches the word and he have taken from it or he'll add to it you leave this out and put that in what yeah oh yeah we could take it we could take an hour another hour and go in and ensure you in the scriptures where he's done it down through the ages the Old Testament the New Testament oh yeah New Testament yeah as I said break from the first search age they were dealing with the devil the deeds of the Nicolaitans and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans until it become the Church of the Nicolaitans and once Nickelodeon conquered the laity conquered the laity so the Holy Ghost is not in control he's got a spirit yeah a spirit on the odd on the minister a spirit of the clergy spirit on the serpent that he'd used in the Garden of Eden oh yeah just somebody for Satan to use and it could be a clergy and beyond your guard because it could be a deacon oh yeah or it could be a brother could be a sister so be on your guard make sure you got the right anointing by the grace of God because Satan is on the move brother to deceive the end time and he's gonna he's going to have such success that as Jesus said that he would deceive the very elect if possible as serious deceived the elect that's how it's so close it's going to be to the real so let's be on our guard and I'd say I brother turn to this sisters if there's anything what is it it's humility be humble but now the prophet of God also I lighted that - he said no so you could be too humble but I was amazed I said what yes he said you could be too humble so as you've got to have a Holy Ghost humility a man not religious humility Holy Ghost humility because religious humility thinks you could you your omble yourself so you compromise with this humble yourself compromise of that no indeed but it is a Holy Ghost ability you got a compromise a man your humble yourself you're there to help you're there to be a blessing you're there to encourage a man you're there to strengthen but you're not there to compromised by the grace of God amen so brother as Paul is warning again here to Galatians concerning deception and he said they're going to remove I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel a man Satan the deeds of the Nicolaitans influencing the Galatians he said which is not another but there be some that trouble you which would pervert the gospel of Christ that's right amen but he said though though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached is it unto you let him be accursed keep your attitude right keep your spirit right if you rebuke them and rebuke what their preaching and teaching you want to do it with the right attitude and a right spirit yeah as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that way every received let him be accursed again the second time let him be accursed god help us amen sorry I've taken so long turn with me I may have to finish with this we wouldn't have time to go into it there's three scriptures that I want to read and we wouldn't get into all of them or the or the quotes of the Prophet but we will try to get a couple of quotes but turn with me to Revelation 13 revelation 13 and beginning to read at verse 1 it's serious if the god of this evil age comes down to this place of judgment I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his horse yea upon his heads the name of blasphemy oh my they would think that it was Christ seven seven heads ten horns ten crowns but upon his heads the name of blasphemy amen and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of the lion you know and the dragon gave him his power yeah and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshipped the Dragon which gave power unto the Beast oh yeah it's the devil as the prophet of God said he's being worshipped by millions and billions yeah they're worshipping the devil and don't know it they think they're worshiping Jehovah but they're not and they worship the Dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshipped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is a to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies yeah but they never recognized it as blessed for me and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months or three and a half years through the Great Tribulation yeah as I said the world's coming to a place where they're gonna turn everything over to the Antichrist it was under the control of the dragon they meant the beasts powers and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name amen we're putting the emphasis on the name but brother he was during 300 AD when the days when the Nicolaitans became organized as the denomination oh yeah controlling the laity absolutely they changed water baptism from the Lord Jesus Christ to Father Son and Holy Ghost that's when they start bap started baptizing in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost they didn't use the name that's when they started title baptism amen they thank God he brought a wreck a restoration of the revelation of the name amen praise the Lord verse 6 again he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and then that dwell in heaven praise the Lord and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints yeah the Dark Ages yeah 68 million laid down their lives they took their stand against the Beast yeah and dad and they were sacrifices one after the other laid down their lives they took their stand against that organized religion that first denomination oh yeah many find that hard to believe what sixty-eight million 68 million Christians and again to remind you of the it was a sister that they were going to they were going to kill her to her daughter and they said if you don't repent if you don't you know say I'm not alright I'll leave that I won't believe that she that's what they wanted her to do if you don't do it they says you don't recant they said we're going to kill your daughter and she said kill her she said we'll meet in glory amen how many mothers would do that I was like in France when they were when they were sacrificing people there because of their Stanford Christianity many years ago and they were just beheading them one after the other and this man was walking by and he saw them and they were going to be at a certain sister and he said no we said don't do that he said let me take her place he said do it to me not to her what how many would do that how many will be willing to lay down their lives or to make sacrifices for your brothers and sisters oh yeah you expect your brother to do this your sister do that don't go help them help them do this of them do that did you take your stand with them not many would do it today but he did it and they said they'd they were surprised they said what yes he said I'm gonna take her place and they took her up and let her go they took him and be edited he's in I without a doubt I feel he's in glory tonight amen God rest his soul amen brother god help us that as he laid down his life for us we lay down our lives for one another by the grace of God I tell you it's not many making sacrifices in their life for their brothers and sisters in the faith no they're living for themselves oh yeah that's my brother that's my sister in the message in the law yeah but are you laying down your life are you really making sacrifices so as to help them or make life maybe a little easier for them by the grace of God remember God allows things to happen to see what spirit is in you oh yeah to see if you're willing to make the sacrifice and lay down your life for one another as he lay down his life for us grace and it was given unto him to make war with the saints yeah in the Great Tribulation not the bride the bride is gonna be going into rapture date now they did she did do it down through the ages and brother sixty-eight million day down their lives that's the many that were called but out of the call there was a few chosen as the Bride of Christ amen but again the rest of them are not lost they're gonna be there yeah so that's why you got to keep your attitude right and keep your spirit right amen and he said they made war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given unto him over all Kindred's and tongues and nations that's right because the Antichrist is going to control the whole earth during the Great Tribulation but thank God for the rapture that the bride's gonna be raptured into glory we're gonna share with him the marriage supper of the lamb sit with him in his throne amen and remember when he comes back Saints come back with him praise the Lord hallelujah who are they that's the bride and she's gonna reign with him for a thousand years praise the Lord thank God for the word a million his his power was given unto him over all Kindred's and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him and again the public brought out their worshipping the devil thinking they're worshiping God thinking they're worshiping hello him Jehovah yeah although worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world If any man Evan ear let him hear a man not your ears it's your ear in your soul we don't have ears in there we got to hear we got one here yeah praise the Lord God's grace to us brother that God will give us a greater and greater revelation of the god of this evil age that will not be deceived by his influence and grace brother sister that our thoughts our words and our deeds are under the influence of the Holy Ghost not the hon Holy Ghost remembering again let me remind you that the prophet of God has warned us that Christ and Antichrist are twins in the same church and when I say the same church I'm not referring to the same assembly I'm afraid to the whole church around the world a man so they are twins in the same church Christ is in his church and the devil is there well you know why would Christ allow this allow that oh it's all for a reason he knows that his seed won't be deceived I won't be to see if you want me to see if you're the seed of God yeah God allows it to bring the separation by the grace of God the Bible says the god of this world and this is second Corinthians chapter four I believe and it says for the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers minds this is the amplified bible that they should not discern the truth preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the gospel of the glory of Christ amen the Messiah who is the image and likeness of God a man but the god of this world is blinding them to the true revelation of God amen so that they worship the devil thinking they're worshiping God grace to us brother that the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is the God we serve is the God we worship not the devil the god of this evil age taking control of the world taking control of the church grace to his brother grace oh well well brother I don't have to worry I'm not going to be to see wait a minute and I remind you again so closer to seed the very linked that's the influence the power of the influence of the Antichrist it's powerful so brother we stand by the grace of God or the grace of God that prevents us from being deceived let's stay humble a man in the presence of God probably God said in the message he said jesus said as it was in the days of Noah wherein eight souls were saved so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man in the days of lot where three were brought out of Sodom and now he said there's already a group already out remember but as it was then when the Son of Man will be manifested now Luke he said hard look where we are living now as it was so shall it be as it was then that's the spirit atmosphere that we're living in now it's that's what we're dealing with that deception let's be on our guard that will not be deceived amen I'll let believe the risk he said Satan the god of this age by his knowledge is giving the people to eat from his mixed tree of good and evil amen he is Satan by his knowledge causing the people of this evil age to eat from his tree of good and evil and he says that he is building a greater Christian civilization by his knowledge a greater Christian civilization but Christ little virgin word bride don't care for his knowledge she keeps free of him a man she's not going under the devil's knowledge she's going under the word the revealed Word of God amen of our Lord Jesus Christ he said knowledge and civilization and true Christianity he says nothing in common people go with the intellectual knowledge of the message but with the spiritual revelation he said civilization is by knowledge a man so the grace of God be with us brother that were were in the revelation of the word by the Holy Ghost brother not just the knowledge of it by the devil see he's intellectual many got intellectual revelation of the mess and electrolyte thoughts of the message and with actual knowledge of the message but the bride got spiritual revelation amen by the grace of God so don't depend on it intellectually in your head let it be in your heart amen by the grace of God revealing Christ in you by Grace will either leave that and the there's a couple other scriptures want to read in Revelation and we'll get that the Lord willing on Sunday God's gracious god bless you this Dan amen we're not under the influence of the god of this evil age we're under the influence of the God of Abraham Isaac Jacob through our Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord let's aim down at the cross where my Savior died down wherefore cleansing from sin I cried dear to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name and I'll turn it to our brother Martin amen you had the Lord said our brother glad the
