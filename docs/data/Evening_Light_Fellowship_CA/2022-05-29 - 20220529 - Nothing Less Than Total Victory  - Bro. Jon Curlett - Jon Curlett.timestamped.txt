[47:06] great price and you took us out heavenly

[48:28] where we pray your holy spirit would
[48:30] touch their lives we pray in jesus
[48:32] christ's name we ask it amen and amen
[48:35] thank you musicians that'll be it this
[48:36] morning if you turn your scriptures to
[48:38] numbers 21 numbers 21.
[48:41] i mean i was just talking to brother joe
[48:42] there before service and
[48:44] and i said who's preaching there this
[48:46] morning he said brother tim and i said
[48:47] you're probably ready to sit back and
[48:49] take a break i said my voice still
[48:50] hasn't recovered and i didn't even
[48:52] preach this weekend so uh he he had
[48:54] mentioned that his voice was going on
[48:55] wednesday and i'm pretty sure it was a
[48:57] joke but i'm not sure actually
[49:00] he he anyways he got up and he preached
[49:02] and we thanked the lord for it amen so
[49:04] certainly he was very happy to be here
[49:05] he's very complimentary of the church he
[49:07] was so thankful for the fellowship for
[49:09] the kindness of the people
[49:10] and uh i from my heart i want to say
[49:12] thank you to those all of us amen it's
[49:15] not a work of one or two it's not the
[49:16] work of the minister amen it's the work
[49:18] of a people that will unite and pull
[49:20] together and do their part so we have
[49:22] people that host it we have people that
[49:24] sang specials we have people that
[49:25] practice with different ones and we had
[49:27] people that you know asked for
[49:29] fellowship and and did all these things
[49:31] and and that's what makes a service like
[49:33] that happen it's not just the one man
[49:34] coming amen but it's each one of us
[49:36] getting in and putting our our shoulder
[49:38] to the wheel and i do apologize we had a
[49:40] lot of requests for fellowship and
[49:42] meetings with brother jones sister
[49:43] jessica and unfortunately there was only
[49:45] so much time and so i kind of did it on
[49:47] a first come first serve basis but uh i
[49:49] know that a lot of people want him to
[49:50] come back at some point and he wants to
[49:52] come back so we'll see when that is but
[49:55] certainly we would trust that he'll be
[49:56] back at some point amen but so thankful
[49:59] for that and you know it's funny because
[50:01] god has a timing for everything and i
[50:03] talked to brother joe back before
[50:05] november i guess it would have been
[50:06] september october and said you know we'd
[50:08] like to have you come up and and he said
[50:10] i want to come up and then he came back
[50:11] he said but i don't think i can come up
[50:13] my my wife doesn't have her vaccinations
[50:15] and she doesn't have an up-to-date
[50:16] passport it's just too tight it's just
[50:17] too tight maybe we could put it off so
[50:20] we put it off till the spring we gave
[50:21] him the winter off so that they wouldn't
[50:23] die of exposure up here and uh
[50:26] and we find the timing was perfect
[50:29] all that called it in september was get
[50:30] him ready and then to get him prepared
[50:32] so that when the time for when god's
[50:34] time came along then he could come and
[50:35] he could meet the need exactly when the
[50:37] need was was was was there and when
[50:39] people were ready to accept him amen
[50:41] there's a time for all of these things
[50:42] and there's a season for it and so we
[50:44] trust god that that no matter what's
[50:46] happening amen if it looks like maybe
[50:47] it's not going quite the way we want it
[50:49] or or someone's not here when we want
[50:51] them to do or the sermon wasn't just
[50:52] what we want to trust that it's coming
[50:53] in god's timing and when you have the
[50:55] need and you're ready to receive it god
[50:56] will send the answer your way amen
[50:59] amen i want to preach this morning
[51:01] on a service
[51:03] a title called nothing less than total
[51:05] victory i want to kind of pick up where
[51:06] brother joe left off and in numbers 21
[51:09] verse 1
[51:10] it says and when king arad the canaanite
[51:12] which dwelt in the south heard that
[51:13] israel came by the way of the spies then
[51:16] he fought against israel and took some
[51:17] of them prisoners and israel vowed a vow
[51:20] unto the lord and said if thou wilt
[51:21] indeed deliver this people into mine
[51:23] hand then i will utterly destroy their
[51:26] cities and the lord hearkened to the
[51:28] voice of israel and delivered up the
[51:29] canaanites and they utterly destroyed
[51:32] them and their cities and he called the
[51:33] name of the place horma amen god bless
[51:36] you you can have your seats this morning
[51:38] amen i want to perhaps take a couple
[51:39] services over the next few weeks uh
[51:42] we're leaving on vacation blanco will be
[51:43] leaving on the 11th and i'm leaving on
[51:45] the 21st for a couple of weeks but in
[51:47] those times as brother gerald would have
[51:49] me minister i kind of want to
[51:50] finish out that that last series on
[51:52] authority to believe and and kind of do
[51:54] just a clincher maybe of the services we
[51:56] had this weekend and and kind of kind of
[51:59] just
[51:59] finish them out a little bit so as i
[52:01] said i want to take a title here of
[52:03] nothing less than total victory and as i
[52:04] was just praying about this and and just
[52:07] dwelling on these things that the phrase
[52:09] that kept coming to my mind was utterly
[52:10] destroy and men utterly destroy and we
[52:13] see that in the scriptures that the
[52:15] utterly destroyed phrases used so much
[52:16] in the old testament it's when the
[52:18] israelites were going into the land of
[52:20] canaan and god said utterly destroy he
[52:22] said leave nothing in your wake don't
[52:24] leave anything alive don't leave any
[52:25] women or children or anything like that
[52:27] utterly destroy everything that's on
[52:29] your property because i've given it to
[52:31] you and anything you leave alive is
[52:33] going to cause you problems down the
[52:34] road so he was saying what have a total
[52:37] victory amen make sure that what you
[52:39] you're you're claiming is totally clean
[52:41] of everything on it that would try and
[52:42] get it back amen amen we've had a number
[52:45] of service and when we have a number of
[52:47] services and the spirit of god is moving
[52:48] so strongly the holy spirit's moving in
[52:51] lives you know it it's wonderful it's a
[52:54] wonderful thing now it's a wonderful
[52:56] thing when it's moving but you know
[52:57] what's more wonderful is when we can
[52:58] recognize what's going on and we can
[53:00] step into that channel and we can
[53:01] receive what god has for us amen it's
[53:04] nice to sit there and raise your hands
[53:06] and worship but it's even more wonderful
[53:08] when you're there to receive something
[53:09] amen when it's not just somebody else
[53:11] that raises their hands or gets the
[53:12] victory but when you get the victory
[53:14] amen when you get a blessing when you
[53:16] get an answer to prayer that's really
[53:17] where we want to be in those sorts of
[53:19] services but then the special meetings
[53:22] are over
[53:23] and some poor schmuck has to come up and
[53:25] take the first service after that amen
[53:26] it's the hardest service to preach is
[53:28] the one right after the special services
[53:30] and everything's been going so good so
[53:32] brother gerald threw me under the bus
[53:33] this morning i feel
[53:35] no not really it's okay brother jail
[53:36] amen but what happens is what the local
[53:38] ministry is left to carry on the battle
[53:40] amen and we've sometimes got to go back
[53:42] to to the old manner you know the mana
[53:44] that we normally get rather than the
[53:45] honey and the and the and the the quail
[53:48] and all these different things amen it's
[53:49] okay to smile like brother ellie's
[53:51] smiling at me and then it's nice to have
[53:53] a change isn't it
[53:54] but we still end up going back to the to
[53:56] the same old don't we we've got to just
[53:57] carry on bit by bit those services are a
[54:00] lot of times it's not just one step you
[54:01] take but it's two or three or five or
[54:03] ten and it gets you moving quickly but
[54:05] then you've got to keep stepping on and
[54:07] then you can't just stay in that one
[54:08] experience and and i love what brother
[54:10] chad said this morning he says we've got
[54:11] the same opportunity this morning don't
[54:13] we it's not it doesn't have to be a
[54:15] shouting sermon we le service we love
[54:17] those we love the worship we love the
[54:18] praise but the point is to keep moving
[54:20] on and then we god is not the limiting
[54:23] factor in these services god is never
[54:25] the limiting factor the limiting factor
[54:26] is us and our expectation and our pull
[54:29] and and whether we're going to come in
[54:30] and put our shoulder to the wheel amen
[54:32] amen whatever it is that we got we got
[54:34] to step in the right direction i believe
[54:36] this weekend you know but that doesn't
[54:38] mean the battle is over i think for many
[54:40] of us what we'll realize over the next
[54:42] week and month is is that we've really
[54:44] just joined the battle
[54:45] you know we've really just stepped into
[54:46] the battle the the first battle was to
[54:48] take courage and to step forward and ask
[54:50] something of god or accept something of
[54:52] god as the case may be to receive
[54:54] something but now the battle has just
[54:56] been joined in many ways amen if you've
[54:57] got healing guess what satan's going to
[54:59] come behind he's going to try and take
[55:00] your healing if you've gotten
[55:01] deliverance he's going to come back and
[55:03] try and put the very thing that you were
[55:04] delivered from back on you whatever it
[55:06] is that you claimed whatever it is that
[55:08] you received satan's going to come back
[55:10] he's going to try and knock holes in
[55:11] that faith isn't he he's going to come
[55:12] back he's trying he's going to try and
[55:14] get you to overthink things he's going
[55:16] to try and get you to dwell on what
[55:17] happened rather than accept it and move
[55:19] on in the will of god in the word of god
[55:21] amen
[55:22] amen satan's going to try and take back
[55:25] whatever it is that you took from him
[55:26] this weekend amen but we don't want to
[55:28] let him to do that brother branham would
[55:30] say this he'd say that that's people
[55:32] today
[55:33] if you'd only see when i tell you about
[55:35] divine healing you'd say well brother
[55:36] branham look i was prayed for last night
[55:38] and i can't move my hand anymore
[55:41] he's saying you can't move it more than
[55:42] you did the day before that don't have
[55:44] one thing to do with it not a thing it's
[55:45] yours go get it sure god give it to you
[55:48] them israelites god didn't just get up
[55:50] there and take his bush and sweep all of
[55:52] them out all the canaanites out he said
[55:54] now come in here here you are sit down
[55:56] never did god do that we see the
[55:58] sovereign work of god so many times and
[56:01] you know you look at jericho their first
[56:02] major vic their first victory when they
[56:04] crossed over it was a sovereign work of
[56:06] god but everything after that they had
[56:08] to do the hard way
[56:09] right and we see that enough times in
[56:11] special services you see a sovereign
[56:13] work of god and now you got to get into
[56:14] the battle now you got to start doing
[56:16] the work now you got to start fighting
[56:17] to take your land and this is what
[56:19] bradley brown is saying he's saying god
[56:20] never went in and swept out the
[56:21] canaanites because the promised land
[56:23] belonged to the israelites he said now
[56:25] you got to go in and do it
[56:27] you got to take me at my word you got to
[56:28] put your sword to the test you got to
[56:30] put your life on the line you got to put
[56:32] your faith on the line and when you do
[56:34] that then you'll see them move out but
[56:35] i'm done here i'll back you up but now
[56:37] you got to take my word and move forward
[56:39] with it he says you show me your faith
[56:41] without your works and i'll show you my
[56:43] faith by my works he's quoting james see
[56:46] you've got to go do it and you've got to
[56:48] fight for every inch of ground that you
[56:50] have every man in here that's born again
[56:52] of the spirit of god knows that you've
[56:54] had to fight for every inch of ground
[56:56] and toe the mark with satan
[56:58] that toe the mark we don't understand
[57:00] that these days but in the old days when
[57:02] you're having a boxy match they draw a
[57:04] line in the middle of the sand they
[57:05] didn't even fight in a ring the way we
[57:06] used to they do it on dirt and they draw
[57:08] a line in the sand right here and to
[57:11] start the match you had to come up and
[57:13] toe the line if you couldn't get your
[57:15] strength together if you couldn't get
[57:17] off off the ground if you didn't have
[57:18] the the the unction to come to that line
[57:20] and toe the line then the match was over
[57:22] and the other guy won before you could
[57:24] fight you had to toe the line and then
[57:25] when you told the line that signaled
[57:26] that you were ready to fight and the
[57:28] match would go until somebody got
[57:29] knocked down then they go back to their
[57:31] corners and then you had to come out and
[57:32] told the line again and again and again
[57:34] you had to tow the line to keep battling
[57:36] brother brown says every inch of ground
[57:38] you've got you've got to toe the line
[57:40] and say i'm in here to win
[57:42] i'm in here to fight amen i'm in here to
[57:44] take what's mine but he says you got to
[57:46] come up and toe the line you got to
[57:47] signify that you're going to be in this
[57:49] for the long haul
[57:50] he says every inch of ground you've got
[57:52] to toe the mark with satan isn't that
[57:54] right friends this is not a picnic this
[57:56] is a battleground see we never come here
[57:59] to eat cookies and so forth we're in a
[58:01] battle amen we're in a battle this is
[58:03] not a sit back at your ease and let god
[58:05] do everything but he says you're gonna
[58:07] have to fight satan for everything that
[58:10] you're going to get
[58:11] everything god's given you satan's
[58:13] camped out on it and he's just trusting
[58:15] like the land that i have below me that
[58:16] you'll ignore the signs and say well
[58:18] that doesn't belong to me you're going
[58:19] to have to fight for it now i read that
[58:22] opening scripture of the israelites on
[58:23] the way to the promised land for a
[58:24] reason because they haven't claimed the
[58:25] land here they're just going through
[58:27] they've sent the spies and the
[58:28] canaanites here they send spy so they
[58:30] attack them and what happens is they've
[58:32] been walking and they've been
[58:34] led by that cloud of uh uh uh the pillar
[58:37] of cloud by day in the fire night but uh
[58:38] cloud of fire by night is the columbus
[58:40] and the catooka song over the weekend
[58:42] and then they've been led by this and
[58:44] they get into a fight and it wasn't of
[58:45] their own choosing because they weren't
[58:46] in the land but the canaanites come out
[58:49] and they grab somebody and they take
[58:50] them in battle and they take prisoners
[58:53] now you notice they don't kill the
[58:54] prisoners
[58:56] you know what sometimes we'd be easier
[58:57] off if they just killed them because we
[58:58] wouldn't have to worry about them too
[59:00] much what's done is done we'd say but
[59:01] it's it's that lingering uh worry it's
[59:04] that lingering fear when they've got
[59:06] somebody you love and you don't know
[59:08] what they're going to do and you don't
[59:08] know if they'll kill them if you attack
[59:10] you know if you should hold back if you
[59:11] should negotiate these things these were
[59:13] hostages basically and israel's seeing
[59:15] they're saying what are we going to do
[59:17] you know what are we going to do
[59:19] but they didn't let it hold them back
[59:21] they went to god because guess what they
[59:23] had the pillar of cloud by day and they
[59:24] had the pillar fire by night they had
[59:26] the presence of the lord in the camp
[59:28] they had the shout of the king and the
[59:29] camp so they went to that king and they
[59:30] said look we need to get our people back
[59:33] they we need to get our people back they
[59:36] belong to us it doesn't matter what
[59:37] caused them to be taken over there we
[59:40] need them back
[59:41] right we got to get them back they're a
[59:42] part of us and as long as they're alive
[59:44] we're going to keep fighting amen we're
[59:46] not going to let satan take him we're
[59:47] not going to let satan have the victory
[59:48] over them we're going to go back in and
[59:50] we're going to take him and they made a
[59:51] promise to god and it said and israel
[59:54] vow to vow unto the lord and said if
[59:55] thou wilt indeed deliver this people
[59:57] into my hand then i will utterly destroy
[59:59] their cities they didn't say if you'll
[1:00:01] give us the people then we'll be very
[1:00:03] happy for it we'll give you the praise
[1:00:04] of glory the honor but they said if
[1:00:06] you'll give us the the prisoners back
[1:00:08] then we'll destroy every bit of the
[1:00:10] enemy that took them amen we will not
[1:00:12] leave anything left for them to attack
[1:00:14] us in the future we'll take care of
[1:00:15] business so that we don't have to do it
[1:00:17] in the future we're going to deal with
[1:00:19] the situation right now amen will
[1:00:21] destroy their families their homes their
[1:00:23] wealth their seat of power their
[1:00:24] fortresses everything that they've used
[1:00:26] to to uh set themselves up to attack us
[1:00:29] we'll destroy and level every single bit
[1:00:31] of it amen god only needs one man
[1:00:33] he only needs one woman that's dedicated
[1:00:35] to his purpose but when he gets a group
[1:00:37] of people that are committed to those
[1:00:39] one things that god wants done then look
[1:00:41] out because nothing can stop them
[1:00:43] remember in the the tower of babel what
[1:00:45] did they say god said look at the men
[1:00:47] they're so united that if they stay this
[1:00:49] way nobody's going to be able to stop
[1:00:51] them and so he had to stop it at the
[1:00:53] beginning he had to break them up by
[1:00:54] giving them different languages because
[1:00:56] when men are united when women are
[1:00:58] united in a common goal nothing can stop
[1:01:00] them and israel comes and they says
[1:01:01] we're united on this one thing god if
[1:01:03] you'll give it to us we'll finish the
[1:01:05] job we're not just going to get them
[1:01:06] back but we'll erase those canaanites
[1:01:08] completely out of there it says in the
[1:01:10] lord hearken to the voice of israel and
[1:01:12] delivered up the canaanites and they
[1:01:13] utterly destroyed them in their cities
[1:01:15] and he called the name of the place
[1:01:16] horma now brother braham says now you
[1:01:18] see we are not a divided people
[1:01:22] if we're divided then we got to make
[1:01:23] sure we we do what we wrap it up in
[1:01:26] bonds of love and then love overcomes
[1:01:28] that's what we're looking for is a love
[1:01:30] that overcomes every break in every
[1:01:32] every division that's amongst us he says
[1:01:34] we're not a divided people we've got to
[1:01:36] be in unity why listen to this because
[1:01:39] each one of us is holding a part of god
[1:01:42] and we must come together and then the
[1:01:45] pillar of fire is manifested in the
[1:01:47] wholeness in the fullness of it when his
[1:01:50] church sits together in heavenly places
[1:01:52] then the fullness of the power of god is
[1:01:55] in his church
[1:01:57] each one of us holding spiritual gifts
[1:02:00] and spiritual offices coming together
[1:02:02] brings that pillar of fire back again so
[1:02:05] when someone is missing from our ranks
[1:02:06] whether it's because they're sick
[1:02:08] because they're working or for whatever
[1:02:10] reason what happens is what we're
[1:02:12] missing a part of the body we're missing
[1:02:14] a part of the pillar of fire in this
[1:02:16] service
[1:02:17] you notice this weekend and i said it to
[1:02:19] a number of people this is the first set
[1:02:21] of special meetings we've had in over
[1:02:22] two years where every single one of us
[1:02:24] was able to make it
[1:02:26] do you think it made a difference
[1:02:29] absolutely it made a difference why
[1:02:30] because every lick of fire was here
[1:02:33] every lick of fire was united with the
[1:02:35] purpose of god every lick of fire was
[1:02:37] here pulling on the words so that it
[1:02:39] could have an effect in our lives amen
[1:02:41] we didn't come here for some saying or
[1:02:43] some minister to tell us beautiful words
[1:02:45] we came to see the power of god moving
[1:02:47] in our midst and changing lives and we
[1:02:48] saw it didn't we why
[1:02:50] every single one of us was unified in
[1:02:52] purpose amen amen if you're unified god
[1:02:55] can't stop us it's when we're divided
[1:02:57] that we get into trouble isn't it you
[1:02:58] look at these israelites and we don't
[1:03:00] get the ones that were captured and made
[1:03:02] prisoner we don't get any details as to
[1:03:03] what happened maybe they were rookies
[1:03:06] maybe they were rookies
[1:03:08] and they just weren't good enough and
[1:03:10] they got overpowered you know maybe they
[1:03:12] got out of line somewhere maybe they
[1:03:13] said oh we can flank them this way and
[1:03:15] they got into trouble and they got
[1:03:16] captured but israel didn't say ah look
[1:03:18] every battle we gotta lose a couple it's
[1:03:20] the end time we know that everything
[1:03:22] that's gonna be shaken will be shaken
[1:03:24] those are some that got shaken
[1:03:26] no no no they said look not a one of us
[1:03:29] has to lose a life in these battles not
[1:03:31] a one of us has to be taken prisoner and
[1:03:32] if we're taking prisoner none of one of
[1:03:34] us has to stay in prison amen it doesn't
[1:03:36] matter what caused them to be taken
[1:03:38] prisoner whether it was their fault or
[1:03:40] our fault we're going to go and we're
[1:03:41] going to bring them back and we're going
[1:03:43] to make sure that they're restored to
[1:03:44] our ranks amen and they wouldn't stop
[1:03:46] until they had the family back and the
[1:03:48] enemy totally and completely destroyed
[1:03:50] and we know that after that there was a
[1:03:51] lot of war
[1:03:52] after they went into the the land of
[1:03:54] canaan there was a lot of war and it
[1:03:55] went on for hundreds and hundreds and
[1:03:57] hundreds of years and it's only under
[1:03:58] the reign of david that we see that that
[1:04:01] is finally put to an end david was a man
[1:04:02] of blood
[1:04:04] and what he was doing was he was setting
[1:04:05] up for the millennial reign with solomon
[1:04:07] wasn't he he was doing all the work
[1:04:09] beforehand so that solomon could sit
[1:04:10] there and he could reign in peace that's
[1:04:12] right right and that was a type for us
[1:04:14] amen is that in the in the millennial
[1:04:16] reign we don't fight anymore that's
[1:04:18] right right satan is is completely
[1:04:20] thwarted he has nobody to work in and
[1:04:22] that's what thwarts me man that's what
[1:04:24] will thwart him in this church today is
[1:04:25] when he can't touch one of us amen when
[1:04:27] we turn him down at every opportunity
[1:04:29] and we say not on my watch amen not in
[1:04:31] my life not in my family not in my mind
[1:04:33] not in my emotions whatever it might be
[1:04:35] when we turn him down flat amen but
[1:04:37] under solomon brother branham talks
[1:04:39] about the people were in unity not just
[1:04:41] with one another but they were in unity
[1:04:42] with god because remember when they did
[1:04:44] the the temple then the presence of god
[1:04:47] came down so much that they couldn't
[1:04:48] even speak
[1:04:50] that's how powerful it was i was talking
[1:04:51] to brother john anders one time i said
[1:04:53] brother john i said what would you do if
[1:04:55] you're in a service i said the presence
[1:04:57] of god was so strong you couldn't speak
[1:04:58] he said that would be the perfect
[1:05:00] service
[1:05:01] he says because god's speaking not me
[1:05:03] he says that's god speaking perfectly to
[1:05:05] the people he's moving in lives if the
[1:05:06] minister is silent that means that god's
[1:05:08] speaking to hearts and individuals amen
[1:05:11] that would be a wonderful place if we
[1:05:12] could get if we could get me out of the
[1:05:14] way so much that it would be god
[1:05:15] speaking directly to you amen amen but
[1:05:18] he's still speaking he's still speaking
[1:05:20] regardless of what we think amen but
[1:05:22] brother brahms talking of solomon's
[1:05:23] reign he says all the nations feared
[1:05:25] israel and instead of trying to make war
[1:05:27] with them they brought in peace
[1:05:28] offerings it says they were not afraid
[1:05:30] so much of their men they were afraid of
[1:05:33] that god that they were all in unity
[1:05:35] with
[1:05:36] amen amen when we can put our
[1:05:38] differences aside because what we're all
[1:05:41] serving the same god i'm not talking
[1:05:43] about it we'll align with denominations
[1:05:45] in these things because we're serving
[1:05:46] the same god but i'm saying we're under
[1:05:48] the same message we're under the same
[1:05:49] umbrella we're going to the same place
[1:05:51] let's make sure we have unity amongst us
[1:05:53] amen he says if you'd only look up unity
[1:05:56] comes from god and the power of god when
[1:05:58] the believer the creation here on earth
[1:06:00] that god has created is united with god
[1:06:03] then there comes a unity and it gives
[1:06:05] faith and when a man sees that he's
[1:06:07] persistent and nobody's going to shake
[1:06:10] him
[1:06:11] i want you to just take a moment this
[1:06:12] morning to think about what it is that
[1:06:14] satan has taken from you or maybe
[1:06:16] something that he took and you got back
[1:06:18] amen where has your struggle been and
[1:06:20] what impact has it had on you over the
[1:06:21] past past few weeks or months or years
[1:06:24] i want you to look at what it was like
[1:06:26] and then look at what it what it is like
[1:06:27] this morning amen maybe you didn't get
[1:06:29] something back
[1:06:31] maybe you're still fighting for maybe
[1:06:33] you didn't get the victory this weekend
[1:06:34] that you were looking for maybe you
[1:06:36] don't have proof of proof positive of
[1:06:38] the promise in your life yet
[1:06:40] amen some of us maybe we were sleeping
[1:06:42] on duty and we got woken up a bit
[1:06:44] some of us were tired out and guess what
[1:06:46] he gave us a couple days of rest and and
[1:06:49] a couple nights of good sleep so to
[1:06:50] speak and and a couple of you know good
[1:06:52] meals to get us refreshed and then some
[1:06:55] of us we got pulled into the battle for
[1:06:56] the first time maybe we've been sitting
[1:06:58] back and letting others do it but
[1:07:00] whatever it was that happened amen all
[1:07:03] that we can say is that satan's going to
[1:07:04] be persistent to try and take it back
[1:07:06] from you amen if there's one thing we
[1:07:08] can say about him brother bram said say
[1:07:10] good things about everyone he says one
[1:07:11] good thing about satan he's a good enemy
[1:07:13] yeah he's good at doing what he does
[1:07:15] doesn't he's persistent he doesn't give
[1:07:17] up amen he's never stopped harassing you
[1:07:19] know nagging or sniping at believers in
[1:07:21] all of his life he never lets he never
[1:07:24] sits back he never sits back he never
[1:07:26] rests he never takes a break right he's
[1:07:28] always there he's always trying to get
[1:07:30] at us amen i'm not trying to quench your
[1:07:32] enthusiasm this morning i'm trying to
[1:07:34] say take what you've got and move
[1:07:36] forward with it brother brother joe
[1:07:38] preached on what what next and he says
[1:07:40] move on and i'm telling you what does
[1:07:41] that move on look like this morning
[1:07:43] we're going to go into that a little bit
[1:07:44] this morning amen i'm letting you know
[1:07:46] the battle's going to continue you've
[1:07:47] won a victory let's keep winning
[1:07:49] victories amen let's keep practicing
[1:07:51] let's keep our sword sharp let's keep
[1:07:53] our our shield of faith up let's keep
[1:07:54] that armor of the of god on us so that
[1:07:57] we know that when he comes we're going
[1:07:58] to be prepared for these things amen
[1:08:00] amen it can't just be a weekend of
[1:08:02] services for us amen that daily
[1:08:05] experience with god is what's going to
[1:08:06] keep you and sustain you as you go amen
[1:08:08] and you've got to put everything you've
[1:08:09] got on the line amen you've got to put
[1:08:11] everything you've got on the line to
[1:08:12] hold on to what he's given and to press
[1:08:14] forward and man give it your all
[1:08:16] give it your all is what we're talking
[1:08:17] about now brother brown would say this
[1:08:20] he said unless you are deeply sincere
[1:08:23] and you can't be sincere until you're
[1:08:24] positive and you understand if you're
[1:08:27] presuming or guessing or hoping so then
[1:08:29] there cannot be a depth of sincerity
[1:08:31] that god requires it faith is not a hope
[1:08:34] so or it could be right it's got to be
[1:08:36] absolutely amen it's your ultimate it's
[1:08:39] your absolute it's a thing you're tied
[1:08:41] to see you have come to your ultimate
[1:08:44] that it is the truth it's nothing but
[1:08:46] the truth and it must be thus he says
[1:08:49] and then when you realize that in your
[1:08:51] mind then you've got to approach it with
[1:08:53] your whole life soul body all that's in
[1:08:56] you just completely sell out everything
[1:08:59] to it that's how you know somebody is
[1:09:01] convinced is when they give everything
[1:09:02] they've got to it
[1:09:03] amen when you put everything you've got
[1:09:05] to it when you put everything on the
[1:09:06] line that's when you know that you
[1:09:08] really believe what you're talking about
[1:09:10] he says jesus as jesus so graciously
[1:09:12] taught us in the man buying pearls and
[1:09:14] he found that one pearl of great price
[1:09:16] and he sold all his others to get to it
[1:09:19] all the truths and everything he had
[1:09:21] though they were good pearls this one
[1:09:24] meant all to him amen you can't be
[1:09:26] casual to this he's saying you got to be
[1:09:28] committed you got to be focused you got
[1:09:30] to take it seriously and you've got to
[1:09:31] look and fight for it with all that you
[1:09:34] have
[1:09:34] he says and when you find god's ultimate
[1:09:37] his word a promise upon a certain thing
[1:09:39] you must know first that it is god's
[1:09:41] word that the thing that you're seeing
[1:09:43] being done is god amen you've got to
[1:09:46] realize that whatever happened to you in
[1:09:48] those services was god it was not
[1:09:51] brother joe adams it was not sister
[1:09:52] jessica adams it was not somebody
[1:09:54] singing specials it was not somebody
[1:09:56] leading songs it was not just an
[1:09:57] atmosphere but it was almighty god
[1:10:00] moving in your life
[1:10:02] and if you don't believe that it will
[1:10:04] not hold it will not stay and satan will
[1:10:05] snatch it right out of your grasp very
[1:10:07] easily amen
[1:10:08] he says when you find god's ultimate his
[1:10:11] word a promise upon a certain thing you
[1:10:13] must know that first that it is god's
[1:10:15] word that the thing that you're seeing
[1:10:16] being done is god there's no maybe so it
[1:10:19] could be it looks like it might be he
[1:10:20] says it is god then when you get to that
[1:10:23] spot then that's the pearl of great
[1:10:25] price what it is god
[1:10:27] that's your pearl of great price when
[1:10:29] you are convinced that it is god
[1:10:31] you must get away then from anything
[1:10:34] that anybody else tells you contrary to
[1:10:37] it you must not look to what man has
[1:10:39] achieved you must look to what god has
[1:10:42] said and what he promised and see him to
[1:10:44] do it then that's your ultimate right
[1:10:46] there then everything that you are
[1:10:50] everything that you was
[1:10:52] everything that you hope to be must be
[1:10:54] placed upon this just as though it was
[1:10:57] death and life to you at that moment
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:01] i talked to many of you after the
[1:11:02] services and
[1:11:03] and throughout the week afterwards there
[1:11:05] were many minis there were many things
[1:11:06] that were ministered to people there are
[1:11:08] many testimonies of people in many
[1:11:10] different ways that god touched amen and
[1:11:12] there was ones that had different
[1:11:14] problems different thoughts conditions
[1:11:16] situations and spirits and discernment
[1:11:18] was going forth to tell you about those
[1:11:20] things
[1:11:21] amen but what happened there is that
[1:11:23] people said what
[1:11:25] if i recognize that the spirit of the
[1:11:26] lord is here
[1:11:28] he doesn't just come for no reason
[1:11:30] because the scripture says where the
[1:11:32] spirit of the lord is there is
[1:11:34] freedom
[1:11:35] so if the spirit of the lord is here to
[1:11:37] discern what my problem is then that
[1:11:40] means the spirit of the lord is here to
[1:11:41] give me freedom from the situation that
[1:11:44] i'm in from the problem that i have from
[1:11:46] whatever it might have been that was
[1:11:48] holding you back or binding you or
[1:11:49] causing you issues the spirit of the
[1:11:51] lord is not there just to tell you about
[1:11:53] it but the spirit of the lord is there
[1:11:54] to give you a total freedom from that
[1:11:56] thing amen it is not there to just say
[1:11:58] god is here but it's there to say god
[1:12:00] wants to move and act in your life amen
[1:12:03] amen what is he saying
[1:12:04] when that spirit is moving what does he
[1:12:06] want what is what he wants you to do is
[1:12:08] jump in and say lord touch me
[1:12:10] amen i know things that are going on
[1:12:12] this church in people's lives because
[1:12:13] you've told me about them and i pray
[1:12:15] about them and you share them you say
[1:12:16] brother john pray for this or remember
[1:12:18] this or remember that so when i'm
[1:12:20] listening to what's going on there and
[1:12:21] i'm saying lord you're speaking help
[1:12:24] them to catch it
[1:12:25] amen as a minister i'm not just
[1:12:27] listening for myself but i'm listening
[1:12:29] for the needs in the congregation and
[1:12:30] when you hear it going forth i can't
[1:12:32] tell you how many times i just started
[1:12:33] to grin and that's in that seat back
[1:12:35] there because i said lord you're hitting
[1:12:37] it and he doesn't know what he's talking
[1:12:39] about
[1:12:39] doesn't have a clue
[1:12:41] and he got off his notes plenty of times
[1:12:43] if you were wondering
[1:12:44] he didn't know what was going on amen
[1:12:46] but what is it when god's getting
[1:12:48] personal with us it's a signal to get on
[1:12:50] board because he's wanting to do
[1:12:51] something in our lives
[1:12:53] and it's the hardest thing sometimes
[1:12:54] when it hurts
[1:12:56] when it hurts and you say ah really god
[1:12:59] really
[1:13:01] but what is it when he's getting
[1:13:02] personal with you it's because he wants
[1:13:03] to stay personal with you and then all
[1:13:05] he's doing is he's saying come up child
[1:13:07] come up son come up donner not
[1:13:09] necessarily come up for prayer but come
[1:13:10] up a little higher amen when i call your
[1:13:13] name come up a little higher and let's
[1:13:14] have a walk and let's move past this
[1:13:16] together amen
[1:13:18] amen he cares enough to call your name
[1:13:20] do you care enough to respond i mean
[1:13:22] that's what we're looking for in these
[1:13:23] situations brother brahm says you cannot
[1:13:25] work until you know the will of god a
[1:13:27] promise in the bible that tells you a
[1:13:29] certain thing that's god's word then he
[1:13:31] sends his spirit back into the church
[1:13:33] and gifts to manifest himself just to
[1:13:36] comb out the little differences and so
[1:13:38] forth to make himself real amongst us
[1:13:41] oh what how could we ask for anything
[1:13:44] different see than when he comes to us
[1:13:46] and makes himself so known so
[1:13:49] personalized himself god amongst his
[1:13:52] people
[1:13:54] what more could you ask for than when he
[1:13:56] gets personal with you amen that's the
[1:13:58] god we want as a personal god
[1:14:00] so if he's personal to clear out your
[1:14:02] problems and guess what he's going to
[1:14:03] add on top of that he's going to build
[1:14:04] line upon line and word upon word he
[1:14:07] doesn't just want it to be a weekend of
[1:14:08] meetings but he wants it to be a life of
[1:14:10] meetings with him that are personal
[1:14:12] between you and him amen amen as the
[1:14:14] services were progressing and i saw that
[1:14:16] word going forth i said to brother joe i
[1:14:17] said brother joe i can't tell you what's
[1:14:19] going on but i can tell you to keep
[1:14:21] speaking and then keep preaching keep
[1:14:23] going in the direction you're going take
[1:14:25] heart even if you don't know what's
[1:14:26] going on but the spirit of the lord is
[1:14:28] speaking to people in this church and
[1:14:29] into situations about which you have no
[1:14:31] knowledge amen
[1:14:33] and after it's all said done then i say
[1:14:35] as brother brahm did what more could we
[1:14:37] ask except that he came in and was
[1:14:38] personal to us amen what is it you got
[1:14:40] reset
[1:14:41] you got back to your pulse of duty you
[1:14:43] got energized you got saved you got
[1:14:45] aligned you got healed
[1:14:46] now what are you going to do with it
[1:14:48] are you just going to say i'm healed
[1:14:50] are you going to move on with your
[1:14:52] healing are you going to move on with
[1:14:53] your testimony are you going to move on
[1:14:54] into the good things that god hath has
[1:14:56] with you i mean what are you going to do
[1:14:57] with your personal god now
[1:14:59] what are you going to do with your
[1:15:00] personal god it can't just be for this
[1:15:02] time it's got to be a continuation of
[1:15:03] that amen because what satan would love
[1:15:06] nothing better than for us to stop and
[1:15:08] say that was a weekend of great meetings
[1:15:10] and leave it in the past
[1:15:13] that's exactly what he wants us he wants
[1:15:14] it to be a thing of the past amen and
[1:15:17] that we would try and praise the lord
[1:15:18] and live off that experience for three
[1:15:20] or four months that is not the way god
[1:15:22] works we do not live off of a past
[1:15:24] experience amen we don't sail by
[1:15:26] yesterday's wind amen we need a day by
[1:15:29] day experience with him a living god
[1:15:31] that's with us each and every day amen
[1:15:33] so satan would love it if we just held
[1:15:36] on to that until it peters out to
[1:15:37] nothing and then we're let left sitting
[1:15:39] there dry on the side of the road
[1:15:40] wondering where god is
[1:15:42] and then we've got to water that
[1:15:43] experience we've got to water that ex
[1:15:45] that event that was in our lives amen
[1:15:47] israel didn't stop with just getting one
[1:15:49] person back they didn't stop with
[1:15:51] getting all the prisoners back they went
[1:15:52] until they had a total and complete
[1:15:54] victory and they had utterly destroyed
[1:15:56] amen and the enemy was never going to
[1:15:58] come back amen and then once the enemy
[1:16:00] got on the run they kept him on the run
[1:16:02] they say the hardest thing to turn
[1:16:04] around is an enemy that's on their own
[1:16:05] an enemy that thinks they've been
[1:16:07] defeated and they're running is the
[1:16:08] hardest one to turn around because
[1:16:09] they've lost every bit of will to fight
[1:16:12] they don't think they can do it they
[1:16:13] don't believe they can do it they don't
[1:16:14] trust the people around them to help
[1:16:16] them do it and so if you can keep them
[1:16:18] running when they're running then you'll
[1:16:19] get the victory far more easily amen
[1:16:21] don't give them a place to set up and
[1:16:22] set it make a stand to try and hold you
[1:16:24] back and turn you back amen
[1:16:26] israel always got into trouble when they
[1:16:28] didn't go all the way
[1:16:30] that was that was that was their
[1:16:31] besetting sin was they never went all
[1:16:33] the way amen god told them over and over
[1:16:36] again he said utterly destroy
[1:16:39] whatever's in your path don't leave
[1:16:41] anything don't leave anything don't
[1:16:43] leave anything i don't care how good it
[1:16:45] looks how cute it looks
[1:16:46] i can't imagine being a soldier in that
[1:16:48] army and you're going and you're seeing
[1:16:49] a little baby maybe in the crib and
[1:16:51] guess what you got to kill it
[1:16:54] why because what satan offers you in the
[1:16:56] beginning will look cute
[1:16:57] it'll look attractive it'll look easy
[1:16:59] it'll be i can change this i can use
[1:17:01] this to my benefit i can control it yeah
[1:17:05] right what could this baby do but guess
[1:17:07] what that baby's going to grow into a
[1:17:08] big moabite one day
[1:17:10] and he's going to remember what you did
[1:17:11] to his mom and his papa
[1:17:13] and he's going to want revenge isn't he
[1:17:15] it didn't matter how nice it looked you
[1:17:17] had to kill it right then and there i
[1:17:18] can't imagine the ptsd that maybe they
[1:17:20] dwelt with over those time brutal but
[1:17:22] guess what and maybe that was their
[1:17:24] thing was they said you know what i just
[1:17:25] can't do it
[1:17:26] and they had to pay for it each and
[1:17:28] every time every time it came back and
[1:17:30] it bit them amen amen amen you better
[1:17:33] know you're up against an army and no
[1:17:34] matter how small it is today one day
[1:17:36] it's going to grow into a big demon you
[1:17:37] got to recognize it as a demon up front
[1:17:40] you got to recognize it as a satanic
[1:17:42] influence up front or it's going to
[1:17:43] destroy you bit by bit by bit and then
[1:17:46] you've got to kill it while you've got
[1:17:47] power over it
[1:17:48] brother brown says this and every man
[1:17:50] and woman could be as persistent as
[1:17:52] samson was as long as you can feel that
[1:17:55] power of promise around you of god
[1:17:58] what is that power promise
[1:18:00] here is the word the word said so
[1:18:04] he says and you can be perseverant as
[1:18:05] long as you know that you've got that
[1:18:07] promise in your heart that faith that
[1:18:08] told you while you were sitting here now
[1:18:10] that faith says i'm healed i'm healed
[1:18:12] see you feel that just keep walking on
[1:18:15] brother god will take care of the
[1:18:16] philistines don't you worry did you ever
[1:18:19] think how samson with that old jawbone
[1:18:20] of the mule you know how thick those
[1:18:22] helmets were some of them was an inch or
[1:18:24] an inch and a half of solid brass you
[1:18:26] could take a two-handed sword and hit
[1:18:28] him on the head and it wouldn't hurt him
[1:18:30] he says and samson took that old dry
[1:18:33] dry jawbone of the mule and picked it up
[1:18:35] and beat down a thousand of them why the
[1:18:37] first lick on top of one of them heads
[1:18:39] that jawbone would have went to a
[1:18:41] million pieces
[1:18:42] dried out bone doesn't hold up long
[1:18:45] especially against tempered brass
[1:18:48] he says why the first lick on top of one
[1:18:50] of them had that jawbone would have went
[1:18:51] to a million pieces but see the miracle
[1:18:54] was in the jawbone the same as in samson
[1:18:59] it doesn't matter what you're holding as
[1:19:00] long as god has blessed it amen amen
[1:19:03] you say draw your sword i don't have a
[1:19:04] sword what do you have what do you say
[1:19:06] to moses moses what do you have in your
[1:19:08] hand a staff good i'll use the staff
[1:19:10] then and then if god puts it in your
[1:19:12] hand if god makes a provision for you
[1:19:14] he's going to make sure that it lasts
[1:19:15] all the way to the full victory amen
[1:19:18] and and samson felt if i can feel that
[1:19:20] promise there where
[1:19:22] in the jawbone he said then bring them
[1:19:24] on and brother he began to knock
[1:19:25] philistines right and left why he was
[1:19:28] persistent until the last philistine was
[1:19:29] laying on the ground amen
[1:19:32] he says what did he have
[1:19:34] not very much
[1:19:37] you say brother john i don't have very
[1:19:39] much
[1:19:40] i've just started on this path
[1:19:42] i just got a single touch that doesn't
[1:19:45] seem like much
[1:19:46] all samson had was a dried-up jawbone
[1:19:49] and he went up against a thousand
[1:19:50] armored philistines and killed every
[1:19:52] single one of them
[1:19:53] he said he had a mule's jaw to fight
[1:19:55] against swords and spears and trained
[1:19:56] men but he had the power of god on him
[1:20:00] amen you got to know that you've got the
[1:20:01] power of god on you if you've got the
[1:20:02] holy spirit inside of you you notice the
[1:20:05] power of god came upon him first
[1:20:08] what was the first thing that the power
[1:20:10] of god did for him
[1:20:11] freedom
[1:20:13] freed him to what
[1:20:15] fight
[1:20:16] that's what's happened to you you've
[1:20:18] been freed to fight
[1:20:21] because when an anointed son or daughter
[1:20:22] of god picks up a weapon and their
[1:20:24] anointed that weapon becomes anointed as
[1:20:26] well
[1:20:26] that's what he's talking about here it
[1:20:27] freed him to fight and then when he
[1:20:29] started fighting the power of god kept
[1:20:31] him until he destroyed every enemy
[1:20:34] he said oh brother fight till every
[1:20:36] symptom's gone hallelujah fight till
[1:20:38] every doubt is gone say well my case is
[1:20:40] different
[1:20:41] take that jawbone and knock it out of
[1:20:44] there this one said but you know i'm
[1:20:46] just a little different i'm getting too
[1:20:48] old
[1:20:50] knock it out abraham was a hundred go on
[1:20:55] old folks no excuses
[1:20:57] young folks no excuses middle-aged
[1:21:00] married single man woman it matters not
[1:21:03] it matters not we see an evidence of
[1:21:05] faith in every single believer in the
[1:21:07] bible and we see it whether they were
[1:21:08] big or small
[1:21:10] they was a 15 year old
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:13] and then you got abraham was a hundred
[1:21:15] right pick your poison doesn't matter
[1:21:17] we've got an example for every single
[1:21:19] thing
[1:21:20] amen you don't have any excuse anymore
[1:21:22] the power of god is on you if you've got
[1:21:24] the holy spirit he says use it to defeat
[1:21:25] your enemy amen don't ignore the words
[1:21:27] of the holy spirit
[1:21:29] don't look at it as brother joe look at
[1:21:30] it as the speaking of the holy spirit
[1:21:32] into your lives personally amen don't go
[1:21:34] halfway with it don't just think about
[1:21:36] it think about it by all means meditate
[1:21:37] on it we're supposed to meditate on the
[1:21:39] things of god amen but act on it act on
[1:21:42] it step forward with it put it into your
[1:21:43] life put it on your lips put it into
[1:21:45] your testimony amen move forward don't
[1:21:47] stand on that experience but move
[1:21:49] forward with that experience and grow it
[1:21:51] into more amen i mean i believe brother
[1:21:54] paul spoke on watering your experience
[1:21:55] with the young people what feeding what
[1:21:58] god has done so it'll grow into
[1:21:59] something even bigger amen what is it as
[1:22:01] brother brahms talk about there he's
[1:22:02] saying let that power of god flow
[1:22:04] through you to burn out whatever it is
[1:22:06] that you have need of in you if it's
[1:22:08] inside of you let it burn that but let
[1:22:09] it come out of you too
[1:22:11] because guess what we don't always go
[1:22:13] around with the jawbone sometimes we got
[1:22:15] to go around with what love
[1:22:17] we got to beat it with love sometimes
[1:22:19] we're going in we're trying to beat it
[1:22:20] with strength and calling it out and
[1:22:21] this and that the other no no sometimes
[1:22:23] you just gotta love your way through it
[1:22:24] like i talked about that bull with
[1:22:26] brother branham so many of us would have
[1:22:27] said well i'm the prophet of god get out
[1:22:29] of my way i'm coming in his name and he
[1:22:30] said i'm so sorry
[1:22:32] didn't mean to disturb you i was so
[1:22:34] intent on the work that i was doing that
[1:22:35] i didn't realize you were here and i
[1:22:37] disturb you
[1:22:38] he says i'm apologize i'm sorry for that
[1:22:40] now he says go lay down because i've
[1:22:42] gone i'm on service for the king
[1:22:43] sometimes that's what we got to do i'm
[1:22:45] sorry
[1:22:46] right
[1:22:47] i didn't mean to do it i'm not going to
[1:22:48] call you out i'm not going to call you
[1:22:50] down i'm not going to pin you down i
[1:22:51] love you
[1:22:52] i gotta keep moving maybe you can come
[1:22:54] with me
[1:22:55] you know it's sometimes so simple we
[1:22:57] don't have to get up and all in arms we
[1:22:59] just have to love somebody sometimes you
[1:23:00] know restore them back amen
[1:23:03] amen let it burn up that sickness that
[1:23:05] pain that besetting sin you've got in
[1:23:06] your life amen let it keep burning and
[1:23:08] moving through you brother hebrews 3
[1:23:10] says take heed brethren lest there be in
[1:23:13] any of you an evil heart of unbelief in
[1:23:15] departing from the living god
[1:23:17] you experience a living god he says what
[1:23:19] then there be an evil heart of unbelief
[1:23:21] that would take you away from that
[1:23:23] experience and not keep you moving
[1:23:24] forward
[1:23:25] but exhort one another daily while it is
[1:23:28] called today lest any of you be hardened
[1:23:30] through the deceitfulness of sins what
[1:23:32] does he say absorb one another encourage
[1:23:34] one another that's why we have
[1:23:35] fellowship that's why we pick the people
[1:23:38] we spend time with
[1:23:39] it's because they're supposed to be
[1:23:41] people that can exhort us and encourage
[1:23:43] us and guess what exhortation is not
[1:23:44] always lovey-dovey is it
[1:23:47] sometimes you got to be a little bit
[1:23:48] what direct with somebody why because
[1:23:50] you're trying to keep them on the
[1:23:51] straight and narrow but it also says
[1:23:53] encourage
[1:23:54] don't just be an exhorter be an
[1:23:56] encourager as well and then don't always
[1:23:58] be sharp but be the one that brings what
[1:24:00] the bomb of gilead behind it to keep
[1:24:01] them going amen he says what don't get
[1:24:03] hardened through what the deceitfulness
[1:24:05] of sin the deceitfulness of unbelief
[1:24:07] amen growing grace with each other and
[1:24:09] pull each other along is what he's
[1:24:10] talking about he says for we are made
[1:24:12] partakers of christ if we hold the
[1:24:15] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:24:18] unto the end there's a beginning of our
[1:24:20] confidence in christ and that's when you
[1:24:22] first what accept him at his word and
[1:24:24] you you repent and you're baptized in
[1:24:25] the name of the lord jesus christ for
[1:24:26] remission of sins and you receive the
[1:24:28] holy ghost that's the first thing but
[1:24:30] that has to go all the way to the end
[1:24:31] and what is that a resurrection or a
[1:24:33] rapture he says don't stop with the
[1:24:35] beginning he says but hold that and be
[1:24:37] steadfast and be confident in that thing
[1:24:39] and take it all the way to fruition
[1:24:42] don't just start but finish it out amen
[1:24:44] stick with it keep going keep going amen
[1:24:46] he says what don't get hardened don't
[1:24:48] get hard into the moving of god
[1:24:50] don't get hard into the word of god
[1:24:52] don't get hearted to the moving of the
[1:24:53] holy spirit listen church is supposed to
[1:24:56] be specific and personal
[1:24:58] we are not supposed to be up here
[1:24:59] preaching generic sermons to to to make
[1:25:02] you feel good
[1:25:03] we're here to encourage you we're here
[1:25:05] to correct you we're here to strengthen
[1:25:06] you we're here to break down barriers
[1:25:08] we're here to cast out demons we're here
[1:25:10] to bring healing all of those things but
[1:25:12] guess what personal hurts a lot of times
[1:25:14] doesn't it
[1:25:15] amen but if it's the spirit of god and
[1:25:16] you could recognize the spirit of god he
[1:25:18] says don't get hardened to it don't get
[1:25:20] hardened by unbelief amen what accept it
[1:25:23] and say lord that's for me i accept your
[1:25:25] word amen sin is deceitful
[1:25:28] why because it's trying to trick you and
[1:25:31] the greatest trick that satan has is
[1:25:32] getting you to believe you've gone far
[1:25:34] enough or you don't have to go all the
[1:25:36] way
[1:25:37] that here is enough you've done enough
[1:25:40] you're good enough and you can stay here
[1:25:41] and guess what that's a denominational
[1:25:43] attitude you just only have to go this
[1:25:45] far guess what we go all the way and
[1:25:47] until you're in a rapture you haven't
[1:25:48] gone all the way
[1:25:50] that's what we're looking for isn't it a
[1:25:51] resurrection and a rapture listen to
[1:25:53] what the prophet said remember he said
[1:25:55] we read that quote where he said halfway
[1:25:56] is the most miserable place to be
[1:25:58] because you're not where you ought to be
[1:25:59] and you're not where you should be and
[1:26:00] you don't believe one of them enough to
[1:26:01] just go with it so you're sitting there
[1:26:03] and you're straddling the fence and
[1:26:04] guess what it hurts to straddle the
[1:26:05] fence if you've ever straddled a fence
[1:26:07] it's not a place to be
[1:26:09] he says now the devil is not like some
[1:26:11] people think he's mean and everything
[1:26:13] but he's deceitful now catch us he says
[1:26:15] the devil makes you think that you're
[1:26:17] right
[1:26:19] in other words you don't need to change
[1:26:21] you don't need to grow you don't need to
[1:26:23] mature you don't need to move anyplace
[1:26:24] you can stay right where you're at he
[1:26:26] says that's the deceit of satan is that
[1:26:28] he makes you think you're okay right
[1:26:29] where you are he says but when you
[1:26:31] disagree with the word that shows that
[1:26:33] it isn't the spirit of god because the
[1:26:35] holy spirit wrote the bible
[1:26:37] what is it you've got to go all the way
[1:26:38] to your end the start of your confidence
[1:26:40] is faith in the word to step out and do
[1:26:42] what acts 2 38 says but it's got to go
[1:26:44] all the way to the reality the
[1:26:45] manifestation and that's the infilling
[1:26:47] of the holy spirit to the point where
[1:26:49] it's working in your life to change you
[1:26:51] not just make you say amen but it's
[1:26:52] working to change you amen keep your
[1:26:54] confidence in him and press towards the
[1:26:56] finish line that's what paul's been
[1:26:57] saying
[1:26:58] second john 1 7 says for many deceivers
[1:27:01] are entered into the world who confess
[1:27:03] not that jesus christ has come in the
[1:27:05] flesh this is a deceiver and an
[1:27:07] antichrist
[1:27:09] now they said he didn't come back then
[1:27:11] but what do they say today
[1:27:12] he's not here anymore
[1:27:14] here's the thing they might acknowledge
[1:27:16] that he was in brother branham
[1:27:18] but how many will acknowledge he's here
[1:27:19] today
[1:27:20] amen starting with brother mark in the
[1:27:22] corner and going all the way back to
[1:27:23] brother weissel in the far corner he's
[1:27:25] here today in the flesh they say what
[1:27:27] they are antichrist
[1:27:30] if they say that christ is not here
[1:27:31] today
[1:27:32] why because he's in you and me
[1:27:34] we've got to know it we've got to
[1:27:35] believe it we've got to act like it but
[1:27:37] he is here today
[1:27:39] he is here today the same as he was then
[1:27:41] except for the corporal body that's
[1:27:42] right amen yes sir he says look to
[1:27:45] yourselves
[1:27:46] that we lose not those things which we
[1:27:48] have wrought but that we receive a full
[1:27:52] reward
[1:27:54] that which we have wrought the things
[1:27:55] we've accomplished the things we've done
[1:27:57] the progress we've made he's saying what
[1:27:59] don't lose that because if you lose that
[1:28:02] you don't get to go all the way to the
[1:28:03] full reward he says hold on to what
[1:28:05] you've got but keep going because that's
[1:28:07] a partial reward you've got to go all
[1:28:08] the way to the full reward there's
[1:28:10] something waiting for you at the end
[1:28:11] that's greater than anything you've
[1:28:12] gotten so far so he says keep going keep
[1:28:14] going keep going when you've done
[1:28:15] something build on it
[1:28:17] when you've done something build on it
[1:28:18] and then keep building building building
[1:28:20] like we say line up online word upon
[1:28:21] word experience upon experience right
[1:28:24] keep moving forward with god why
[1:28:27] otherwise you're going to lose the full
[1:28:28] reward
[1:28:29] you know what the full reward is
[1:28:31] remember if you look in scriptures in
[1:28:32] revelation it says you know that that
[1:28:34] men will come forward in that day and
[1:28:36] what's going to be tried their works
[1:28:38] he says and if their works don't hold up
[1:28:40] they'll be destroyed but that man's soul
[1:28:42] won't be lost
[1:28:43] but the full reward is if you can keep
[1:28:44] what you've worked for and your soul
[1:28:47] what is it you work for what are the
[1:28:49] jewels in your crown the souls that
[1:28:51] you've brought to christ the things
[1:28:52] you've done that did what built up the
[1:28:55] kingdom of god that's the stuff that
[1:28:56] will stand what does the song say only
[1:28:58] what's dumb for christ will stand what
[1:29:00] is it that's what we want to build not
[1:29:01] with hay and stubble and these things
[1:29:03] but we want to build something that'll
[1:29:04] take the fire of the holy spirit and
[1:29:06] it'll come out and it'll be pure and
[1:29:07] it'll stand in the day of judgment amen
[1:29:09] amen will you stop with an experience or
[1:29:12] will you move on to a perfect and
[1:29:14] complete reality amen john points out
[1:29:16] that we work and we achieve things in
[1:29:18] christ that are good but he says look
[1:29:19] out that you don't lose what you have
[1:29:21] and it keeps you from going all the way
[1:29:23] to that full reward amen don't settle
[1:29:24] for a halfway victory that's what he's
[1:29:26] saying don't settle for knowing god
[1:29:27] spoke to you don't settle for knowing
[1:29:29] god called you out keep going to the
[1:29:30] full reward keep going until god hasn't
[1:29:33] just spoken to you but he's spoken
[1:29:35] through you till god just hasn't been
[1:29:36] expressed to you but he's been expressed
[1:29:38] in you amen that's the fullness that
[1:29:40] we're looking for amen don't leave him
[1:29:42] as the god of special meetings with
[1:29:43] special ministers
[1:29:45] amen don't leave him of a god of of
[1:29:47] church
[1:29:48] right
[1:29:50] how many times do we see in scripture
[1:29:51] that where they got where they needed to
[1:29:53] go not in a church service but in what
[1:29:55] the privacy of their own prayer closet
[1:29:57] where they got into a room with god and
[1:29:59] god alone and they said lord here i am
[1:30:02] don't know what to do don't know where
[1:30:03] to go don't know how to get what i need
[1:30:05] i know i have a need
[1:30:07] but lord i i need you to come
[1:30:10] right the service is here for great
[1:30:12] victories but guess what you got little
[1:30:14] victories you're going to need all
[1:30:15] through that week and that only comes
[1:30:17] with getting personal with god in your
[1:30:18] own way you need that quiet time and
[1:30:20] that's the hardest thing to get these
[1:30:21] days is quiet time isn't it
[1:30:24] amen you might only have an earnest
[1:30:26] right now
[1:30:27] keep going and then you've got a down
[1:30:29] payment but go all the way until you get
[1:30:30] the full payment go all the way till you
[1:30:32] get the full victory amen go until he's
[1:30:34] not just an experience but he's you're
[1:30:36] all in all right
[1:30:37] that's what we're looking for amen
[1:30:39] stick with it until you have the
[1:30:40] complete purchase that christ has
[1:30:42] already paid for
[1:30:45] brother bob says this and when you come
[1:30:46] forth to be prayed for if you want
[1:30:48] salvation if you want divine healing no
[1:30:50] matter what it is if you are a believer
[1:30:52] you're an heir of every promise
[1:30:55] i don't see any exceptions there
[1:30:57] if you're a believer a true believer
[1:30:59] you've been filled with the holy spirit
[1:31:01] you are an heir of every single promise
[1:31:03] amen so lay your faith upon the promise
[1:31:06] and march forward and tell satan give it
[1:31:08] back give it back it's mine don't let
[1:31:11] him bluff you stand right there on the
[1:31:13] line he'll give it back god said he
[1:31:16] would so he has to do it that's your
[1:31:18] authority that's right you're the heir
[1:31:20] of all things if you've never received
[1:31:22] the holy ghost as yet don't know nothing
[1:31:24] about it and something in your heart's
[1:31:26] telling you you want it you stay right
[1:31:28] there
[1:31:29] that's eternal life that's what you're
[1:31:31] heir to stay right there and look satan
[1:31:33] right in the face and say you are the
[1:31:34] robber you're the one i've come to
[1:31:36] you're the one i've come to possess what
[1:31:38] jesus christ died for me to have now
[1:31:40] hand it back and get out of my way he
[1:31:42] says then the first thing you know
[1:31:45] the holy spirit will pour upon you then
[1:31:48] something happens something will happen
[1:31:50] what is it god vindicated he keeps his
[1:31:53] word
[1:31:54] that's just exactly then see after you
[1:31:57] see the word is vindicated to you that
[1:31:59] you are saved you do have the holy ghost
[1:32:02] then what
[1:32:03] amen he says abraham had won the victory
[1:32:05] and here he come marching back
[1:32:09] he was going down with his faith laying
[1:32:11] on the word that he could bring it back
[1:32:12] what he had lost and here he come back
[1:32:14] with it marching the victor's march
[1:32:16] that's the same thing you can do if you
[1:32:18] don't have eternal life ask god confess
[1:32:21] your sins believe on the son of god
[1:32:23] accept the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:32:24] say i got god i come for it i'm here to
[1:32:27] receive it
[1:32:29] then you come back the victor's march
[1:32:33] you got it amen just shining my the
[1:32:35] birds sing different and everybody
[1:32:37] you're in love with everybody then that
[1:32:40] old hatred malice strife is done gone
[1:32:42] love everybody oh you're just having a
[1:32:45] great time singing shouting praising god
[1:32:47] don't care what anybody says about you
[1:32:49] it's all right sure on the victor's
[1:32:51] march amen you know when you get the
[1:32:53] holy ghost because life changes
[1:32:56] life changes as we said before you don't
[1:32:59] even you may not even want to change
[1:33:00] it'll change you and people will know
[1:33:03] remember scripture said of the apostles
[1:33:05] that they knew that they had been with
[1:33:06] jesus you get the holy ghost people will
[1:33:08] know you've been with jesus that's for
[1:33:10] sure he says oh his word will become
[1:33:12] something new to you whenever you once
[1:33:14] get the baptism of the holy ghost oh my
[1:33:16] you say i can't see these things i don't
[1:33:18] believe in shouting i don't believe in
[1:33:20] speaking in tongues i don't believe in
[1:33:21] divine healing it just shows you've
[1:33:23] never got the victory that's right but
[1:33:25] one time you get the victory then you've
[1:33:27] got it he says then you have it yes sir
[1:33:30] then you can shout like i said satan has
[1:33:33] won if he convinced you you've gone far
[1:33:35] enough you want to know when you've gone
[1:33:36] far enough
[1:33:38] you go on a rapture
[1:33:40] you know when you've gone far enough
[1:33:42] when he has come and he's knocked on
[1:33:43] your door and he's tried to get you to
[1:33:45] do it and do it and do it and do it and
[1:33:46] do it and you turn him down so many
[1:33:48] times that he doesn't come to your door
[1:33:49] on that situation anymore
[1:33:51] when he doesn't come around that's when
[1:33:52] you know you've gone far enough
[1:33:54] amen but go until he doesn't even want
[1:33:56] to have a conversation with you go and
[1:33:58] tell he doesn't want to even talk to you
[1:33:59] about it much less throw a temptation
[1:34:01] your way go until he has disappeared
[1:34:03] from that area of your life completely
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:06] amen amen that's when you know you've
[1:34:08] won the victories when he stops trying
[1:34:10] because what he is so completely
[1:34:12] thwarted so completely powerless in your
[1:34:14] life in that area that he doesn't even
[1:34:16] want to have a chat about it anymore he
[1:34:18] says he's got me he's got me and then
[1:34:20] what does he do he goes for an easier
[1:34:21] target doesn't he and then when he stops
[1:34:23] fighting you that's when you know amen
[1:34:25] but as long as you're as you're
[1:34:27] wondering and kind of wanting and not
[1:34:28] too sure keep pressing because you don't
[1:34:30] have it remember brother brown says when
[1:34:32] you get the victory you'll know it
[1:34:34] amen you'll walk different you'll talk
[1:34:36] different
[1:34:37] he says now he ascended on high and gave
[1:34:39] gifts back to men what was it swords he
[1:34:41] put swords in their hand the words see
[1:34:43] to conquer oh my he gave them swords
[1:34:45] what for the word to conquer what
[1:34:47] sickness sins superstitions evil to
[1:34:50] bring every living creature that wants
[1:34:53] to live
[1:34:54] to bring every one of them to the
[1:34:55] realization that because i live you live
[1:34:59] also do you want to live
[1:35:01] if you want to live he says then he's
[1:35:02] here to make you live
[1:35:04] if you don't want to live then it's not
[1:35:05] for you but if you want to live he says
[1:35:07] then he's here to bring you to the
[1:35:09] realization that because i live you live
[1:35:11] also it's a new kind of living isn't it
[1:35:13] if you've gotten it it's a new kind of
[1:35:15] living if you know what you are and you
[1:35:16] know what you are you know it's a
[1:35:17] different kind of life he's saying if
[1:35:19] you want to live that kind of life
[1:35:20] there's a man here that can do it for
[1:35:22] you
[1:35:22] he says we have the fight of faith let
[1:35:24] us complete our victory for our complete
[1:35:27] victory is positive it's sure it's got
[1:35:30] to be we have the first fruits of it
[1:35:32] often that's what you get in special
[1:35:34] means is the first fruits of it
[1:35:36] by saying you got to go until you have
[1:35:37] what the full harvest
[1:35:39] we have the evidence in our heart now
[1:35:41] because we've already got the first
[1:35:42] battle behind us we have been able to
[1:35:44] conquer through the faith of jesus
[1:35:46] christ we had a v-day how many had a
[1:35:49] v-day amen he's saying keep going that's
[1:35:52] one get another get another get another
[1:35:54] get another until you have the total
[1:35:56] victory
[1:35:57] first john 5 4 says for whatsoever is
[1:35:59] born of god over cometh the world
[1:36:03] this
[1:36:04] is the victory that overcometh the world
[1:36:06] even our faith you've got to be born of
[1:36:08] god and when you're born of god it's
[1:36:09] what the holy spirit in you it's the
[1:36:11] very life and faith of jesus christ
[1:36:13] acting in you to give you the victory
[1:36:15] and overcome the world amen
[1:36:17] i've said it so many times over the last
[1:36:19] year i feel and that said you've got to
[1:36:21] receive the holy spirit you've got to
[1:36:22] receive god personally not just a
[1:36:24] message doctrine not just the idea of a
[1:36:26] prophet came to us but you need the
[1:36:28] person of the word in your life and that
[1:36:31] is the living holy spirit in your heart
[1:36:34] and soul amen and what is it you got to
[1:36:36] come on that altar and you say lord i'm
[1:36:38] dead i'm not just dying i'm dead i'm
[1:36:40] giving up i'm laying it all on the altar
[1:36:42] i'm putting it all aside so that you can
[1:36:45] take a hold of me and live through me
[1:36:47] because until you do that you're just
[1:36:48] holding them back
[1:36:51] amen you won't get closer to god by
[1:36:53] doctrines and truths pharisees and
[1:36:55] sadducees had it guess what you can go
[1:36:57] on denominations and find plenty of that
[1:36:58] stuff i can go on facebook and instagram
[1:37:00] find lots of memes and great little
[1:37:02] thoughts and ideas that's not what's
[1:37:03] going to do it you got to have god
[1:37:05] inside of you and that's the real new
[1:37:06] birth amen you've got to accept christ
[1:37:08] the word into your life brother brown
[1:37:10] says it this way he says you ain't ready
[1:37:11] to live till you get the holy ghost and
[1:37:13] then when you get the holy ghost then
[1:37:15] you're just fit to live
[1:37:17] you wasn't fit to live before that seed
[1:37:18] but now you're just fit to lift after
[1:37:20] you live after you got the holy ghost
[1:37:22] see
[1:37:22] just getting you ready see people say
[1:37:24] well i got to get ready to die my i'm
[1:37:27] getting ready to live amen the thing of
[1:37:29] it is get ready to live and live in
[1:37:31] christ victorious life over sin death
[1:37:33] hell i already have the victory he's my
[1:37:36] victory and i'm his evidence and i'm an
[1:37:40] evidence of his victory amen that's it
[1:37:42] how do you know you got it he says i got
[1:37:44] it why because i'm an evidence of
[1:37:46] victory because i know what i was and i
[1:37:48] know what i am i am what a
[1:37:51] pro token of his victory i'm the
[1:37:54] evidence of victory
[1:37:55] he says he gave it to me by his grace i
[1:37:58] feel it i know it i see it working in my
[1:38:01] life it changed me but according to this
[1:38:04] book here he said that i had eternal
[1:38:05] life and would not be able to come to
[1:38:07] the judgment but i passed from death
[1:38:09] unto life because he took my judgment
[1:38:11] for me and if he paid the price don't
[1:38:14] try and bring me to any judgment listen
[1:38:16] don't try and bring yourself to any
[1:38:17] judgment sometimes we're the hardest on
[1:38:19] ourselves i'm hard on myself
[1:38:22] when i trip up however small or however
[1:38:24] big i'm hard on myself he says don't
[1:38:26] bring me to the judgment i'm telling you
[1:38:28] today don't bring yourself to the
[1:38:29] judgment don't say i need to pay for
[1:38:31] this i need to pay for that he paid for
[1:38:33] you he paid the price so you didn't have
[1:38:35] to pay the price so don't bring yourself
[1:38:37] to the judgment lay yourself at calvary
[1:38:39] say lord i'm sorry help me not to do it
[1:38:42] again and move forward in total
[1:38:43] justification you never did it in the
[1:38:45] first place don't go to judgment go to
[1:38:48] grace at the cross amen
[1:38:50] glory he says what i've passed from
[1:38:53] death into life because he took my
[1:38:55] judgment for me and if he paid the price
[1:38:57] don't bring me to any judgment he done
[1:38:59] took it for me and i accepted it yes sir
[1:39:02] the prophet would tell us he'd say don't
[1:39:03] have a conversation with satan
[1:39:06] he knocks don't talk about it
[1:39:08] don't debate you know who had a debate
[1:39:11] eve
[1:39:12] and we're still paying for that debate
[1:39:15] we're still paying for that conversation
[1:39:17] today amen brother brown said turn him
[1:39:20] down and walk away
[1:39:22] you know who you need to have a
[1:39:23] conversation with god don't have a
[1:39:26] conversation with satan have a
[1:39:27] conversation with god amen he speaks
[1:39:29] through his word first and foremost amen
[1:39:31] have a conversation with god and see
[1:39:33] what he's saying about you and then
[1:39:34] satan doesn't have any time to get in a
[1:39:36] conversation with you if we're in such
[1:39:38] close fellowship with god satan can't
[1:39:39] even get an edge in there he can't even
[1:39:41] get a point and he can't get anything
[1:39:42] into our life because we're so tied into
[1:39:44] that thing amen what is it keep walking
[1:39:46] towards the promise amen keep your
[1:39:49] conversation with god and the things of
[1:39:50] god and the people of god
[1:39:53] brother brown put it this way he says
[1:39:54] and a man never knows what it is to live
[1:39:56] a victorious life until he's completely
[1:39:59] overcome
[1:40:01] now he's not saying until he completely
[1:40:02] overcomes he says until he personally is
[1:40:06] completely overcome
[1:40:08] what when i've laid everything down
[1:40:11] when jonathan collette is completely
[1:40:13] overcome
[1:40:14] when that is put aside and it's only
[1:40:15] christ living in me that's when he's got
[1:40:17] the victory and if we look in our lives
[1:40:19] so often that's a work of time
[1:40:22] i didn't have the victory over
[1:40:23] everything potentially i did
[1:40:25] but god's we're creatures of time and
[1:40:27] god works with us as creatures of time
[1:40:29] and so he'll work with us in aspects of
[1:40:31] our life and guess what he'll start with
[1:40:33] brother paul in a different place than
[1:40:34] he starts with me sometimes we'll look
[1:40:36] at somebody's life we'll say well how
[1:40:37] come they haven't got over that because
[1:40:38] they don't need to get over that to keep
[1:40:40] moving on it was it was a stronghold in
[1:40:42] your life it has a greater effect on you
[1:40:44] and god has to get that out of your life
[1:40:46] it's not a big deal to them
[1:40:48] remember paul says he says some can eat
[1:40:49] meats and this and that the other and
[1:40:51] someone can only eat you know the only
[1:40:52] vegetables and these different things he
[1:40:54] says the stronger ones the one that can
[1:40:55] eat those things and just keep moving on
[1:40:56] it has no effect it doesn't hinder them
[1:40:58] there's something we have hindrances and
[1:41:00] in my life that maybe would not hinder
[1:41:02] you and so god has to deal with them but
[1:41:04] you look at them and say well they're
[1:41:05] worldly or they're this they need no no
[1:41:07] it just doesn't affect them the way it
[1:41:08] affects you you've got weaknesses you've
[1:41:09] got you've got chinks in your arm
[1:41:11] remember brother branham said that that
[1:41:12] uh satan's always got one punch coming
[1:41:14] you got one area of weakness that we got
[1:41:15] to keep covered in in prayer on these
[1:41:17] different things
[1:41:18] we've got to remember that amen that he
[1:41:20] works with each one of us differently
[1:41:22] amen
[1:41:23] amen so what i've got to be overcome
[1:41:25] completely overcome and that's when we
[1:41:27] get the total victory so whether it's my
[1:41:29] finances whether it's my career whether
[1:41:30] it's my ministry whether it's my family
[1:41:32] my marriage whatever it might be he's
[1:41:34] got to get the victory he's got to
[1:41:35] completely overcome me so that he can
[1:41:38] have victory now through me
[1:41:40] he says who himself that's the biggest
[1:41:42] enemy you've got is yourself that's the
[1:41:44] reason we can't rise up in faith is
[1:41:46] because you've got intellectuality there
[1:41:48] your intellectual part says well this or
[1:41:50] that it's a reasoning he says we want to
[1:41:52] cast down reasonings the bible tells us
[1:41:54] that's what satan comes to you with his
[1:41:55] reasonings
[1:41:56] right don't have the conversation with
[1:41:58] reasonings the word has no rhyme or
[1:42:00] reason brother bram says i can't tell
[1:42:01] you how god heals i can't tell you how
[1:42:03] god delivers i can't tell you how he
[1:42:05] does it all i know is that he does it
[1:42:06] right and i believe he does it and i'll
[1:42:08] keep believing he does it and i'll keep
[1:42:09] moving moving forward with that solution
[1:42:11] amen so it is if you're healed keep
[1:42:13] walking and healing if you're delivered
[1:42:15] keep walking in freedom if you're
[1:42:16] restored flourish and grow
[1:42:19] i love what he was saying there he says
[1:42:21] if you're here it's because god wants
[1:42:22] you here
[1:42:23] so while you're here grow if he takes
[1:42:25] you away praise the lord but while
[1:42:26] you're here grow don't be stagnant where
[1:42:28] you are
[1:42:29] and then i learned that in bc where it
[1:42:31] seemed like nothing was happening yet i
[1:42:32] had to realize there was a purpose there
[1:42:34] in it and i grew in that situation three
[1:42:36] and a half years backside of the desert
[1:42:38] it felt like but yet i grew because god
[1:42:40] had a purpose and when you recognize the
[1:42:42] purpose you'll grow where you are no
[1:42:43] matter what's going on
[1:42:45] amen
[1:42:46] what is it use it as momentum use it as
[1:42:48] an impetus amen to keep moving into the
[1:42:50] word of god feed the seed otherwise it's
[1:42:52] going to wither remember you look at the
[1:42:54] parable of the sower
[1:42:55] the word fell on a lot of ground but
[1:42:57] only on good ground did it did it
[1:42:59] flourish and bring forth something amen
[1:43:01] some it started
[1:43:02] it started but then when what the heat
[1:43:04] came and the sun came or it got around
[1:43:06] the wrong people then it choked out that
[1:43:07] experience and then you got to be around
[1:43:09] the right kind of people you got to be
[1:43:10] around the right kind of atmosphere
[1:43:13] very familiar scripture matthew 12 43
[1:43:15] says when the unclean spirit has gone
[1:43:16] out of a man he walketh through dry
[1:43:18] places seeking rest and findeth none
[1:43:22] when he's gone he goes looking for some
[1:43:23] place
[1:43:24] he says then he says i'll return into my
[1:43:26] house from once i came out and when he
[1:43:28] has come he finds it empty swept and
[1:43:30] garnished catch that the house was
[1:43:32] cleaned out the person was delivered
[1:43:33] amen the person got the victory the
[1:43:35] demon was evicted but then after a while
[1:43:37] he comes back and he found they just
[1:43:38] cleaned it up it says garnish they'd
[1:43:40] actually added some nice little
[1:43:41] decorations
[1:43:43] it was prepared for occupancy
[1:43:45] but there was nobody there
[1:43:48] he says then go with he so he comes in
[1:43:50] says there's nobody here then he says he
[1:43:52] goes and takes with himself seven other
[1:43:54] spirits more wicked than himself and
[1:43:56] they enter in and dwell there and the
[1:43:58] last state of that man is worse than the
[1:43:59] first even so shall it be unto this
[1:44:02] wicked generation i'm not trying to
[1:44:05] scare you i'm trying to tell you you've
[1:44:06] got room in your life now
[1:44:08] feel it
[1:44:10] feel it you got room you've been
[1:44:12] delivered you've been healed you've been
[1:44:13] whatever it is
[1:44:15] fill that space fill that void you've
[1:44:16] got to fill it with something and i'm
[1:44:17] saying fill it with the things of god
[1:44:19] fill it with the people of god fill it
[1:44:20] with the praise of god fill it with the
[1:44:21] music of god fill it with whatever it is
[1:44:24] that you can stuff in there so that when
[1:44:25] that thing comes back
[1:44:27] guess what answers the door the things
[1:44:29] of god the spirit of god the praise of
[1:44:31] god the worship of god the testimony of
[1:44:33] god the fellowship of god all these
[1:44:35] things he's saying fill that space
[1:44:36] because otherwise you're just making it
[1:44:38] even easier for them to come back and
[1:44:40] they're even more welcome the second
[1:44:41] time around amen amen
[1:44:44] but brahm says i believe that's the
[1:44:46] reason that people don't have the
[1:44:47] victory in their heart when they should
[1:44:49] have is because their thoughts are on
[1:44:51] other things
[1:44:52] let the meditation of my mind of my
[1:44:55] heart be acceptable unto thee o lord he
[1:44:58] says i believe if we'll think on him he
[1:45:00] will drive on to us i was reading it i
[1:45:03] had so many so many things here and i i
[1:45:05] really had to cut it down but brother
[1:45:07] brown was talking about mary and he says
[1:45:08] mary went and she had fellowship with
[1:45:10] somebody that had a similar belief and a
[1:45:12] similar experience
[1:45:14] right when the angel comes to her
[1:45:16] what does she do she goes and she spends
[1:45:17] time with elizabeth because why
[1:45:19] elizabeth had an angel too and she has a
[1:45:21] supernatural birth going on in her body
[1:45:23] as well and she went and she fed that
[1:45:25] experience she fed what had happened to
[1:45:27] her with somebody that could encourage
[1:45:29] her in that exact same thing that's what
[1:45:31] we need to do spend time with people
[1:45:33] that believe the same thing you do spend
[1:45:35] time with people that will encourage you
[1:45:36] along the path that you're walking on
[1:45:37] this morning amen
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:40] i heard brother joe speak to many lives
[1:45:42] this weekend and a lot of you shared
[1:45:44] some things before and a lot of you have
[1:45:45] shared things after and many of you came
[1:45:47] up for prayer and that's between you him
[1:45:49] and god he doesn't tell me anything and
[1:45:50] that's why we have visiting ministers is
[1:45:52] so that it can be sovereign amen so that
[1:45:54] you don't have to worry about things you
[1:45:55] share coming back and these different
[1:45:57] things amen but
[1:45:59] when you uh
[1:46:00] whatever you felt to do
[1:46:02] whatever you felt to claim whatever you
[1:46:04] felt was given to you keep after it
[1:46:06] amen nobody's here talking about you
[1:46:09] badly
[1:46:10] there's a lot of victories and man when
[1:46:12] our sister jenna came up i thought the
[1:46:14] roof was going to come off this
[1:46:16] praise the lord
[1:46:17] you know that was a victory
[1:46:20] that was an amazing victory that was an
[1:46:23] out of the blue victory wasn't it sister
[1:46:24] jenna i don't think she came here
[1:46:26] thinking that was going to happen
[1:46:29] but it happened

[1:46:51] pleased with where your mind's at in the
[1:46:53] days and weeks that come ahead amen
[1:46:55] brother brahms praying over the
[1:46:56] congregation here this is god hiding
[1:46:58] himself in simplicity he says they're
[1:47:00] seeking more life after hearing that the
[1:47:02] blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses
[1:47:05] that there's no more nothing that the
[1:47:07] complete word of god rests within them
[1:47:09] and that the very command of their own
[1:47:11] voice is creative power because in them
[1:47:14] is the holy ghost do you realize that's
[1:47:16] what's inside of you this morning
[1:47:18] creative power in your voice what are
[1:47:21] you going to create

[1:47:27] it's in you to create an atmosphere
[1:47:29] and what does an atmosphere bring
[1:47:31] results

[1:47:44] pool get in the pool and stay in the
[1:47:46] pool until you're fully and completely
[1:47:48] delivered amen he says the holy ghost is
[1:47:51] a creator he makes things comes to pass
[1:47:54] because he speaks the word and the word
[1:47:56] spoken becomes god in action so what are
[1:47:59] you speaking
[1:48:01] is it putting god in action or is it
[1:48:03] giving satan a door to come into your
[1:48:05] life
[1:48:05] speak god into action he says and lord i
[1:48:08] pray that you will send the holy ghost
[1:48:10] upon every one of them just now and
[1:48:12] deliver them lord in the power of the
[1:48:14] resurrection of christ the things that
[1:48:16] they're desiring in their heart now
[1:48:18] listen to this
[1:48:19] a better life
[1:48:20] the baptism of the spirit lord may it be
[1:48:23] so that this audience will be
[1:48:24] illuminated the hearts of the people
[1:48:27] will see the vision and be filled with
[1:48:29] the power of god amen god loves it when
[1:48:32] you'll ask him for his direction for his
[1:48:35] vision for his purpose
[1:48:37] and then you can see it and you can say
[1:48:38] lord i want that and you'll hold there
[1:48:40] until it manifests itself in your life
[1:48:42] amen
[1:48:44] amen we read a scripture a while ago and
[1:48:47] it says
[1:48:50] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[1:48:52] from the west and his glory from the
[1:48:54] rising of the sun
[1:48:56] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:48:57] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[1:49:00] up a standard against him remember we
[1:49:02] read that quote where the prophet said
[1:49:03] that lifting up a standard was what
[1:49:05] pouring the holy spirit into your life
[1:49:08] what do we want we want a pouring out
[1:49:12] we want it till you're saturated
[1:49:14] until you're soaked
[1:49:16] isn't that what we want
[1:49:18] isn't that what we want is to be so
[1:49:19] saturated they they they there's that
[1:49:21] song that says saturate us with your
[1:49:23] presence
[1:49:24] devastate us
[1:49:27] devastate us with your glory what me
[1:49:30] jonathan corlett the carnality
[1:49:32] amen let it so soak in there that that's
[1:49:34] all that people see that so that when
[1:49:35] they squeeze me what do they get holy
[1:49:37] spirit response
[1:49:39] right not anger not temper not
[1:49:41] frustration but what holy ghost response
[1:49:45] each and every time so when i squeeze
[1:49:47] out it brings a refreshing to them not a
[1:49:48] rebuke amen god help us amen
[1:49:51] what is it we want to be so in tune with
[1:49:53] god that satan has no way to squeak in
[1:49:56] because we recognize him each and every
[1:49:57] time he's coming at us and he's going to
[1:49:59] come at us
[1:50:00] he's going to maybe he's already come at
[1:50:02] you amen recognize it and say we're not
[1:50:04] having this conversation i'm going to go
[1:50:06] spend some time with god i'm going to go
[1:50:08] spend some time with the people of god
[1:50:09] and i'm going to make sure that you
[1:50:10] don't have any time to get into my life
[1:50:12] amen amen if you're a true child of god
[1:50:15] once that life starts there's no coming
[1:50:16] back
[1:50:17] amen you can't do it you can't be lost
[1:50:20] there is an eternal salvation
[1:50:22] and when you get the holy ghost that's
[1:50:24] eternal because it can't die you've got
[1:50:26] a part of god in you and it seals your
[1:50:27] soul all the way to eternity
[1:50:29] brother brown says what god when god
[1:50:31] comes into a person or to persons into a
[1:50:34] congregation into a man or woman he
[1:50:36] vindicates his presence and god proves
[1:50:38] that he's there for when god comes
[1:50:40] supernatural signs begin to appear
[1:50:43] what is that supernatural sign
[1:50:46] he says this person becomes a changed
[1:50:48] person
[1:50:50] they're not no more like they used to be
[1:50:53] sin has vanished from their life fear
[1:50:54] and doubt has vanished frustration they
[1:50:57] are solid and stable live or die it's
[1:50:59] christ they don't care what comes or
[1:51:01] what goes nothing shakes them
[1:51:03] they move forward
[1:51:06] brothers i might need some more water
[1:51:08] here
[1:51:09] i said i want i've read the scripture
[1:51:10] before and i want to remind you of this
[1:51:12] word principle to keep fighting to keep
[1:51:14] striking while the iron's hot
[1:51:16] that's what you do when the iron's hot
[1:51:17] when the iron's hot it's malleable
[1:51:19] that's why they heat it up is because
[1:51:20] you can bend iron when it's when it's
[1:51:22] when it's when it's heated up to a high
[1:51:24] temperature once it's once it cools down
[1:51:26] it solidifies and you can't do anything
[1:51:27] with it
[1:51:28] right
[1:51:29] it's in second kings 13 it says now
[1:51:31] elisha was fallen sick of his sickness
[1:51:33] wherever he died and joash the king of
[1:51:35] israel came down unto him and wept over
[1:51:37] his face and said o my father my father
[1:51:39] the chariot of israel and the horsemen
[1:51:41] thereof the prophet to them was the
[1:51:43] horseman and the chariot they knew if
[1:51:45] they had the prophet there and they were
[1:51:46] in god's will that nothing was going to
[1:51:48] overcome israel he was literally the
[1:51:50] protection of israel that's why he calls
[1:51:52] him that they weren't allowed to have
[1:51:54] horses and chariots in israel did you
[1:51:55] know that they were forbidden to have it
[1:51:57] because it was what something that they
[1:51:59] put their carnal strength into and
[1:52:01] they'd start believing we're winning
[1:52:02] because we have chariots and horses he
[1:52:04] called elisha the chariot and the
[1:52:05] horsemen of israel
[1:52:07] and elisha said unto him take bow and
[1:52:09] arrows and he took unto him bow and
[1:52:10] arrows and he said to the king of israel
[1:52:12] put thine hand upon the bow and he put
[1:52:14] his hand upon it and elisha put his
[1:52:16] hands upon the king's hands and he said
[1:52:18] open the window eastward and he opened
[1:52:20] it then elisha said shoot and he shot
[1:52:22] this guy's very obedient to the prophet
[1:52:24] you notice
[1:52:26] and he said the arrow of the lord's
[1:52:28] deliverance and the arrow of deliverance
[1:52:29] from syria for thou shalt smite the
[1:52:31] syrians in affect until thou shalt thou
[1:52:35] have consumed them there's a prophecy
[1:52:37] going forth says you're going to beat
[1:52:38] them
[1:52:40] consume them that means you'll destroy
[1:52:42] them utterly
[1:52:43] and he said take the arrows and he took
[1:52:45] them and he said unto the king of israel
[1:52:46] smite upon the ground and he smote
[1:52:48] thrice and stayed in other words he he
[1:52:50] struck the arrows three times into the
[1:52:52] ground and then he stopped
[1:52:53] and the man of god was wrath with him
[1:52:55] and said thou should have smitten five
[1:52:57] or six times then thou had smitten syria
[1:53:00] until thou had consumed it whereas now
[1:53:02] thou shalt smite syria but thrice good
[1:53:05] thing i don't have a lisp
[1:53:07] he says you should have kept going
[1:53:09] he says you stopped at three why did you
[1:53:11] stop at three
[1:53:13] you shouldn't have stopped you should
[1:53:14] have went five or six he says then you
[1:53:16] should have consumed him he's already
[1:53:17] prophesied they'll consume them and then
[1:53:19] the man doesn't strike enough and he
[1:53:21] says because of it you won't consume
[1:53:22] them the prophecy was given you had the
[1:53:24] promise but he says you didn't go far
[1:53:26] enough you didn't strike and strike and
[1:53:28] strike until you knew without a shadow
[1:53:29] of a doubt that they would be completely
[1:53:31] obliterated and he was mad at him and
[1:53:33] this was a good king
[1:53:34] he says you didn't go far enough he said
[1:53:37] what these arrows represent deliverance
[1:53:39] so strike and you'll get as much
[1:53:41] deliverance as you strike what you say
[1:53:43] will happen
[1:53:44] make sure you do enough amen and he says
[1:53:46] what are you doing three three three
[1:53:48] battles isn't going to destroy these
[1:53:50] kings
[1:53:51] three battles isn't going to do enough
[1:53:52] they've got enough of an army they've
[1:53:53] got enough of a population that they'll
[1:53:55] come back after three i sometimes wonder
[1:53:57] why joash only struck three times maybe
[1:54:00] he said you know what i don't want to be
[1:54:02] battling all the time
[1:54:03] even if we're winning it's a hard time
[1:54:05] maybe i don't want to do that i'm just
[1:54:06] going to go for three that'll keep them
[1:54:08] off my back as long as i'm alive and
[1:54:09] then somebody else can take it maybe i
[1:54:11] don't know but whatever it was did not
[1:54:13] rise up in him and say yeah let's get
[1:54:14] the job done he was satisfied to go most
[1:54:17] of the way amen
[1:54:19] what is it you're not supposed to keep
[1:54:20] satan at bay you're supposed to destroy
[1:54:22] his works
[1:54:23] right now keep him at bay not hold him
[1:54:25] up but you're supposed to destroy his
[1:54:26] works first john 3 says little children
[1:54:29] let no man deceive you he that doeth
[1:54:31] righteousness is righteousness is
[1:54:33] righteous what is righteousness it's the
[1:54:34] will of god so he that does the will of
[1:54:37] god is righteous even as he is righteous
[1:54:39] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[1:54:41] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[1:54:43] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:54:45] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:54:47] works of the devil so that's our job now
[1:54:50] right christ destroyed the works of of
[1:54:52] the devil and that he got the keys to
[1:54:53] death and hell in the grave and he rose
[1:54:55] and he proved to us that he's alive and
[1:54:56] well but now he's in us to continue that
[1:54:59] work and it is to destroy not the devil
[1:55:01] because he's not destroyed till after
[1:55:02] the white throne judgment right then
[1:55:04] he's cast in and then he's finished
[1:55:06] completely but in the meantime we've got
[1:55:08] to destroy the works of the devil we've
[1:55:09] got to destroy the effects of the devil
[1:55:11] we've got to pull people back from the
[1:55:12] brink we've got to pull situations out
[1:55:14] of his hand and put him into the word of
[1:55:16] god we've got to destroy the effect of
[1:55:18] him in our life amen and you say how do
[1:55:20] i destroy the works of the devil
[1:55:22] what is it that's going to get satan out
[1:55:24] of my life what is it that's going to
[1:55:25] put satan on his heels what is it that's
[1:55:27] going to give me the victory over him
[1:55:31] should i ask for answers
[1:55:34] it's simple
[1:55:36] we heard it
[1:55:38] manifest christ remember
[1:55:41] listen the way brother brandon puts it
[1:55:42] he says oh my how we need thousands of
[1:55:45] lived
[1:55:46] voices
[1:55:47] lived voices
[1:55:49] the thunder of god thundering out in
[1:55:52] sweetness and holiness purity undefiled
[1:55:56] lives walking around in the earth today
[1:55:58] without a blemish
[1:56:00] yes sir real christians that's thunder
[1:56:02] against the enemy the devil don't care
[1:56:04] how loud you can holler don't stop
[1:56:06] hollering
[1:56:07] but that's not what gets him running
[1:56:09] the devil don't care how much you can
[1:56:10] jump or how much you can do this or
[1:56:12] shout don't stop jumping don't stop
[1:56:14] shouting that's part of worship
[1:56:16] but he says but what hurts the devil is
[1:56:19] to see that sanctified holy life
[1:56:21] consecrated to god
[1:56:23] listen to what this looks like in action
[1:56:25] say anything to him
[1:56:27] call him anything just as sweet as it
[1:56:29] can be and move right on oh my that
[1:56:31] throws him away that's the thunder that
[1:56:34] shakes the devil a holy sanctified life
[1:56:38] that doesn't
[1:56:40] react satan hates it when he can't get
[1:56:44] you to react to circumstances
[1:56:46] when you aren't looking at the
[1:56:47] circumstances but you're looking at the
[1:56:49] god of all circumstances did you know
[1:56:51] that you can't have anything come into
[1:56:53] your life
[1:56:53] except he allows it amen you can't have
[1:56:56] sickness unless he allows it you can't
[1:56:58] have loss of finances you can't have
[1:57:00] pain you can't have suffering none of
[1:57:01] these things can come to you that satan
[1:57:03] will put on you unless god gives him
[1:57:05] permission to do it in the first place
[1:57:06] amen
[1:57:07] so you know that if it's coming it's
[1:57:09] because god allowed it and all he's
[1:57:10] trying to do is get you to do what
[1:57:12] manifest christ in the situation
[1:57:14] how many times did we hear that over the
[1:57:16] weekend amen what is he looking for he's
[1:57:18] saying we want god to what put a choke
[1:57:20] hold
[1:57:22] on our carnality and let the holy spirit
[1:57:24] come through in each and every situation
[1:57:25] amen was he saying you can turn the
[1:57:27] cheek when somebody slaps you when
[1:57:29] somebody calls your name when somebody
[1:57:30] rips on your reputation when somebody
[1:57:32] dismisses you whatever it might be
[1:57:35] right when you'll keep fellowshipping
[1:57:36] when it doesn't when you don't feel like
[1:57:38] fellowshipping
[1:57:39] whatever it might be what is it satan's
[1:57:42] just trying to get you to react the holy
[1:57:44] spirit doesn't react that way
[1:57:46] right it's able to be calm
[1:57:48] he's able to sit back
[1:57:49] and say what's really going on here and
[1:57:51] react that way amen
[1:57:54] first corinthians 15 says but thanks be
[1:57:56] to god which giveth us the victory
[1:57:58] through our lord jesus christ therefore
[1:58:00] my beloved brethren
[1:58:02] be steadfast unmovable
[1:58:05] always abounding in the work of the lord
[1:58:07] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:58:10] is not in vain i want you to encourage
[1:58:11] you this morning to be steadfast
[1:58:14] right don't move from the promise of god
[1:58:16] don't move from the word of god don't
[1:58:17] move from the unction of the holy spirit
[1:58:20] healing sometimes hurts do you know that
[1:58:22] you ever been hurt bad
[1:58:24] guess what sometimes the healing works
[1:58:25] more hurts more than the injury because
[1:58:27] it's dragged out over time
[1:58:29] you ever try and pull a sliver out
[1:58:32] if it's got some little edges on there
[1:58:34] it it hurts doesn't it sometimes we'd
[1:58:36] rather leave the sliver in there
[1:58:39] but then what happens is it worms its
[1:58:40] way into your flesh and then it hurts
[1:58:42] even more to get it out later
[1:58:44] but it hurts i uh i was i was uh
[1:58:47] repairing the the do not trespass
[1:58:50] private property sign on the property
[1:58:52] that's not mine below me
[1:58:54] and when i was doing it it was a very
[1:58:55] windy cold day and my fingers were
[1:58:57] really numb and i was i was i was trying
[1:58:59] to put the screws in to repair the sign
[1:59:01] and as i went in the
[1:59:03] they're pretty long screws and the the
[1:59:04] drill
[1:59:05] tipped out of the way and it drove the
[1:59:07] head right into my thumb it went right
[1:59:09] in here and i had this this basically
[1:59:12] cross-shaped gouge right into it went
[1:59:14] deep and i bled like a stuck pig i mean
[1:59:16] it was bleeding bleeding bleeding
[1:59:18] and so i went home and i put a band-aid
[1:59:21] on it and guess what it bled for two
[1:59:22] days
[1:59:24] and so finally i said you know what
[1:59:26] covering it up is not what's going to
[1:59:27] bring the healing so i opened it up and
[1:59:30] i let the fresh air come around it and
[1:59:31] what happened was within just an hour it
[1:59:33] dried up and sealed itself
[1:59:35] what sometimes we think we got to cover
[1:59:37] it to let it heal sometimes we got to
[1:59:38] get out in the open but you know what
[1:59:40] happened it still hurts today so it's
[1:59:42] slowly closed up you know when you had
[1:59:44] you know little puss and infection and
[1:59:46] stuff in theirs it's healing and guess
[1:59:48] what it was tender to the touch for
[1:59:49] quite a while and even today this is
[1:59:51] probably a month and a half later if i
[1:59:52] press on that it hurts because it's not
[1:59:54] fully healed it looks healed but if i
[1:59:56] press on it i can still feel that scar
[1:59:57] tissue in there that's a little bit
[1:59:58] tender today
[2:00:00] but if i'd have left it it just festered
[2:00:02] over time wouldn't it the healing hurts
[2:00:04] and i've got a mark from healing there
[2:00:05] but it is healed today but it may never
[2:00:07] be the same again i don't know
[2:00:09] but it's healed today and i can use that
[2:00:11] thumb in a way that i couldn't do it
[2:00:12] before sometimes the healing hurts
[2:00:14] sometimes change hurts is what i'm
[2:00:15] saying sometimes taking that step it
[2:00:17] hurts and we've got to be willing to go
[2:00:19] through that amen so that we can get the
[2:00:21] benefit of all of that but paul's saying
[2:00:23] here he's saying abound in the work of
[2:00:24] the lord abound in it
[2:00:27] not just you know a little bit of this
[2:00:28] and a little bit of that but he says
[2:00:30] abound in it let it be a big thing the
[2:00:31] amplified puts it this way he says
[2:00:33] therefore my beloved brethren be firm
[2:00:36] steadfast immovable always abounding in
[2:00:38] the work of the lord
[2:00:40] always being superior excelling doing
[2:00:43] more doing more than enough in the
[2:00:45] service of the lord
[2:00:47] give it everything
[2:00:49] don't just give it enough
[2:00:50] remember paul exhorted the servants he
[2:00:52] says don't if you're a slave don't try
[2:00:54] not to be a slave he says but work is
[2:00:56] unto the lord do it as unto the lord
[2:00:57] don't do it as unto men don't do it for
[2:00:59] the favor of men but do it as unto god
[2:01:01] and that's where the reward is
[2:01:03] right
[2:01:03] so he says here be superior excelling
[2:01:06] doing more than enough in the service of
[2:01:07] the lord why knowing and being
[2:01:10] continually aware that your labor in the
[2:01:12] lord is not futile in other words it is
[2:01:15] never wasted
[2:01:16] or to no purpose
[2:01:20] god never brings something into your
[2:01:21] life
[2:01:22] for no purpose amen amen so he doesn't
[2:01:25] waste your tears
[2:01:26] he doesn't waste your trials he doesn't
[2:01:28] waste your pain he doesn't waste your
[2:01:30] hurt he doesn't waste your your failures
[2:01:33] or your fault none of these things god
[2:01:35] uses all of those things to what to help
[2:01:37] you abound in the work of god amen we
[2:01:39] heard it this past week romans 8 28 and
[2:01:41] that's that all things work together for
[2:01:43] the good
[2:01:44] of them who are the called not just
[2:01:47] called but thee called the specific ones
[2:01:48] that he was looking for those are the
[2:01:50] ones that all things work together for
[2:01:52] good in their lives amen
[2:01:54] i thought it was beautiful what brother
[2:01:55] joe said in that last service lord i
[2:01:57] want to know your will manifest christ
[2:02:00] lord what do i do in this situation
[2:02:02] manifest christ
[2:02:03] lord what do i do manifest christ
[2:02:06] what about this what do i do manifest
[2:02:08] christ and he'll bring everything that
[2:02:10] you need your way amen i think sometimes
[2:02:12] we're we're so influenced by a prophetic
[2:02:14] ministry that we think we have to know
[2:02:16] what's coming we don't we don't know
[2:02:18] what's going we know what's coming a
[2:02:20] resurrection and a rapture amen
[2:02:22] everything else between that's up to him
[2:02:23] whether he gives it whether he doesn't
[2:02:25] amen how many times have we sought god
[2:02:27] and i thought just that answer manifest
[2:02:29] christ would be the answer to every
[2:02:31] single situation so often we do need
[2:02:33] specifics i'm not saying you don't look
[2:02:35] for that but manifest christ in whatever
[2:02:36] you're going to do
[2:02:38] amen every single part of it if you're
[2:02:39] focused on that i believe everything
[2:02:41] else you need will be added to you
[2:02:43] as we start to close he says man or a
[2:02:45] woman that takes god's word you got a
[2:02:47] hold of something your anchor holds
[2:02:49] within the veil the storms and gales may
[2:02:51] press and shake in every way but you're
[2:02:53] anchored she's coming right up onto the
[2:02:55] place you're persevering you're going to
[2:02:58] believe it noah believed it sure and he
[2:03:00] achieved god's purpose for his life do
[2:03:02] you want to achieve god's purpose in
[2:03:03] your life
[2:03:04] he says then be perseverant when you get
[2:03:07] the word hold on to it the promise it's
[2:03:10] yours he says abraham don't have to
[2:03:12] wander no more across the city seeking a
[2:03:14] country across the country seeking a
[2:03:16] city
[2:03:17] the sinner don't have to wonder anymore
[2:03:19] whether he can be saved or not the sick
[2:03:20] man doesn't have to wonder whether he
[2:03:22] can be healed or not the opening veil on
[2:03:24] that day at calvary revealed the way to
[2:03:26] the total victory
[2:03:29] what was it
[2:03:30] restored fellowship
[2:03:32] there was a remedy there was a covering
[2:03:35] there was a price paid that signified
[2:03:37] all of those things he said god gives us
[2:03:39] the powers of his spirit to live
[2:03:41] triumphantly over all these things he
[2:03:43] asks us only to believe it
[2:03:46] that happened on that day at calvary
[2:03:48] there never was a day like it there
[2:03:50] never will be one like it it's not
[2:03:52] necessary no more the price is paid and
[2:03:54] we are redeemed thanks be to god we are
[2:03:57] redeemed you're redeemed this morning
[2:04:00] may not look like it but you're redeemed
[2:04:02] he says there's no more
[2:04:04] you have to wonder about there's no more
[2:04:06] guessing about it it's all took away the
[2:04:09] veil pulled back the curtain and we're
[2:04:11] set on a highway not to wonder anymore
[2:04:13] but to believe and just walk right on we
[2:04:16] walk right in to god's very presence
[2:04:20] amen god bless you if you'd stand this
[2:04:22] morning
[2:04:23] amen i want to encourage you again keep
[2:04:25] pressing on
[2:04:29] amen keep acting on the word of god keep
[2:04:31] feeding and watering your experience
[2:04:32] with god amen be an expectation
[2:04:35] i love what he talked about i heard the
[2:04:37] story of you know that that that sister
[2:04:40] coming up and she was praying for her
[2:04:41] brother to get saved in 15 minutes he
[2:04:44] ran into his pajamas what you didn't
[2:04:45] know was that he thought the rapture had
[2:04:47] happened
[2:04:48] and he ran in there to see if they were
[2:04:50] still there
[2:04:51] and when they were there he was so
[2:04:52] relieved that he gave his heart to god
[2:04:54] amen amen
[2:04:56] sometimes it's just going to happen
[2:04:59] there will be no warning i remember when
[2:05:01] i got saved there was no warning my mom
[2:05:03] was there many others were there and
[2:05:05] they were praying and praying and
[2:05:05] praying and i had not made a move all
[2:05:07] weekend this was down louisiana camp i
[2:05:09] was 17 years old brother donny reagan
[2:05:11] brother berry coffee there and there
[2:05:13] they they had been running a prayer line
[2:05:14] for probably an hour and a half two
[2:05:15] hours and i hadn't moved a lick i was
[2:05:17] just sitting there sitting there sitting
[2:05:19] there then all of a sudden i got up and
[2:05:20] that was it and it was done and it was a
[2:05:22] finished work from that moment forward
[2:05:23] and that's all we need sometimes is to
[2:05:25] just wait for the one moment
[2:05:27] without a warning
[2:05:29] right we have no idea what's coming and
[2:05:30] then god just steps in and in a
[2:05:32] sovereign work he says now is the time
[2:05:33] now's the day now it's the moment of
[2:05:35] deliverance of healing a provision
[2:05:37] whatever it is and all we've got to do
[2:05:38] is hold on for that one moment where god
[2:05:40] says now is my time
[2:05:42] not what you want but what i've won and
[2:05:45] what i've ordained and when he ordains
[2:05:47] it it's got to come to pass amen when we
[2:05:49] can wait for his timing he does all
[2:05:51] things he says he makes all things
[2:05:53] beautiful in his time
[2:05:55] amen can we trust that this morning
[2:05:57] let's bow our heads if we would lord god

[2:06:02] lord that you would encourage us lord
