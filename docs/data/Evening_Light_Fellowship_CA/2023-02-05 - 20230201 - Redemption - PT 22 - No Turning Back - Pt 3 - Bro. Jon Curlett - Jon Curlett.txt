Ephesians chapter 5. it means good to have sister Betty back with us God bless her and brother Barry and sister Darlene as well it's good to see them here amen we've got a full I think this is the first time we've had pretty much everybody here we've got a couple missing of course but it's what it's going to look like moving forward certainly and it's good to preach to a half full church that's what it feels like here we're half full so I need to fill the other half by God's grace but it's good to be here amen Ephesians chapter 5 very familiar scripture certainly says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself it says for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it that means he feeds it and he takes care of it he keeps it healthy even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh and he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we spoke a few Services ago on the restoration to True unity and I kind of went so far with it and then I stopped them then we jumped into this this mini series on no turning back and I want to preach on no turning back again this morning the third and last part by God's grace but I want to take these two thoughts and blend them because really they're two halves of the the same thing and I want to get into the real motive behind I believe and the real inspiration as to what started us on this little portion in the series of redemption and the last couple Services we covered the the Israelites when they came out of Egypt and how they kept turning back and every time something difficult came up they kept looking back to Egypt and they kept looking at the good things of Egypt and forgetting that they were in slavery the whole time and they forgot the supernatural presence of God and they forgot the signs and the Wonders and time and time again when the littlest thing came up they would turn away from God and they'd look longingly back with where they came out of Amen but we want to turn a corner this morning amen and we've talked about Israel's Redemption from Egypt and I'm so thankful it's a type because I don't believe that the people I'm preaching to tonight are a perfect reflection of that church that came out of Israel because they kept turning back they kept looking back their hearts were not in it when the hard times hit they turned away from God Amen but I believe that I'm talking to a bride this morning that's not going to turn back but I want you to understand that that not turning back is not something of your own choosing I want you to understand that the reason you can keep going the way you're going the reason that you're on the path you're on the reason that you're continuing maybe even when it doesn't feel like you ought to continue is because it's something that's Supernatural that's keeping us along this path amen I want to encourage you this morning you're going to make it you're going to make it he who started the work and you will be faithful to complete it amen but that starting of that work has to be the right way and it has to be with the right the right origin and it has to be through the word of God Amen it can't be something of your own making it can't be something of your own choosing it can't even be a path of your own choosing but it's something that God does and he calls you to it the scripture says that no man can come to God except God call him first so the reason that you're on this path the reason that you are where you are today is because he has called you and that's what makes you not be able to turn back because there's going to come times and maybe you've already experienced times in your life where you want to turn back you say I don't have it in me to continue on this path I don't have it in me to continue this walk I don't have it in me to continue down this pain and this training and this change and maybe the disappointments that have come through in lives and you're going to hit that point and something Supernatural is going to have to keep pushing you forward because there's nothing in you to keep going anymore when you've given all you can and not nothing has happened what are you going to do then that's when the supernatural has to come in amen so often why we're lacking the Supernatural is we're trying to continue to do it in our own strength in our own will in our own way of our own desire and that's only holding God back many times brother Bob talked about it just before prayer where he said we're talking about sometimes letting go of the wheel just letting go and saying Lord I need you to move because I've been driving too long and I'm not getting anywhere I need you to take hold of the steering wheel amen listen how you feel your strength or your weakness matters not not at all what matters is is god with you and that's the only thing that matters because when you're feeling down when you're feeling weak when you're feeling overcome when you're feeling unvictorious guess what that doesn't change God that's why you want God is because he never changes there's no variableness there's no shadow of turning there's nothing in him that changes with circumstance it changes with life that changes with time nothing changes so you've got to be bound to him amen the prophet of God I want to encourage you this morning with this he says the anointed word of God being Vindicated before any man that's born to be a Son of God With The predestinated Germ into him for this hour he'll see God's message as sure as there's a God in heaven he says Martin Luther sought for his day Wesley sought for his the Pentecostal saw for his he says now what about you they went into a denomination you know what that means that means we can go into a denomination if we're not careful because everyone before us has done it but there's a true church that doesn't go into denomination she goes into relationship she says here is the word condemning it what going into denomination telling you what we're to have today and just exactly Malachi 4 and all these other promises for the hour what do you see what are you looking at amen here we are the real genuine Eagles here my sheep know my voice and a stranger they'll not follow he says why why can you hear why do you understand why does it have an effect on you it was put in there by predestination you were foreign to a Son of God you were ordained to be a daughter of God you were in God before the foundation of the word you're only manifested in this day for his honor and His glory he says how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God he says which you are a part of that word by predestination because look the God is the word you believe it well he always was the word in the beginning was the word and if the Word was God then you were in God the word the part that you're to pray you have a part to play but it is not of your choosing it is not of your own making it's not of your own deciding but it is already predestinated by God through the word he says the part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world he's seen you he knew you he predestinated you to it so how can you turn back from something that was eternally predestined how can you change something that was in God that existed before you ever stepped into a breath of life on this Earth You can't do it what's holding you from not turning back from turning back is what the predestinated power of Christ that foresaw you before you ever came into existence amen the the role that you're playing the path that you're walking is already planned out for you and you can no more stop it than I could stop brother Chad's truck with my hand we've all seen his big truck right how much does it weigh brother Chad 12 tons 24 000 pounds do you think I could stop that with my hand and we sit here and we think my weakness my faults my lack of commitment is gonna stop the predestination of God Church you can't stop it the mack truck the international whatever it is that he's driving will run over your faults we'll run over your failures and it'll drag you all the way to Eternity Kicking and Screaming if he has to but he wants you on his side he doesn't want you trying to stop it he doesn't want you trying to protest it trying to say I can't do it but he wants you to get on the Big Mac Truck and let's go to glory amen he's wanting you on board but you can't stop at your faults and your failures cannot stand before the predestination of God he's going to overcome them and that's never going to hold you back amen you may lose a battle from time to time you may take steps back from time to time we all have faults and failures and sometimes Satan gets a hold of us and we do take a couple steps back but what eventually the Holy Spirit comes in and it raises up a standard we take back the ground we've lost and then we start moving forward and footsteps is possession and there's going to come a time where we don't step back anymore we understand or we move forward we stand or we move forward and that's going to be the progression of the church amen listen you're linked to God whether you like it or not right now whether you like it or not right now you're linked to God and he's not going to lose a one he's not going to lose the one we sit there and we put pressure on ourselves am I gonna hold on am I gonna make it am I gonna get the victory am I going to get the healing am I going to get the Holy Ghost he's going to make sure you get it it takes the pressure off because we're not holding him he's holding us he's the one that has Us in the palm of his hands and that's what guarantees us to the end it's not my commitment it's not my discipline it's not my strength it's him it's him that's holding us it's him that's going to take us across the Finish Line amen by the way I would say the seals were broke why in the last Church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride the opening of the seals is not for knowledge it's never been for knowledge Church knowledge killed the original Israelite Church knowledge kills that's not why he opened the seals he says but he did it to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride see Oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him now what is it Out of the Dust of the Earth listen look where you are today out of the bottom of the sea out of the pits out of everywhere and every place out of the regions out of the dark out of paradise wherever they may be he'll call and they'll answer the conditions for hearing the car are not to be in a message Church the conditions for healing hearing the call are to be a predestinated son and daughter of God with the sea Gene of God inside of you and no matter where you are you'll hear his call when he calls you he says he'll call and they'll answer he's come to his subjects he revealed his secrets and they saw it and time is no more at that time time has run out it's finished so he's revealing the seals he's revealing these truths and they have a purpose they have to have an effect there's supposed to be something happening because this word has been opened to us it ought to be having a greater effect than it's ever had since the day of Pentecost and it's going to have a great effect because this one's going to take us all the way off of this Earth in a Rapture and a resurrection amen but it can't just be I understand the Seven Seals no you've got to have the revelation of it living inside of you you've got to have an effect in your life from what's happening with the opening of the word but I love where he says there he says he's calling them out of where the dust of the Earth the bottom of the sea out of the pits out of everywhere every place regions of the dark out of paradise where are you at this morning you're sitting in church but that may not be where you're sitting at this morning you can be in despair you could be in weakness you could be overcome you can be worn out you could be tired you can be sick and you say that's going to hold me back I don't feel like an overcomer I don't feel like I'm a Victor I don't feel like I'm a Believer all the time he says he's calling you wherever you're at and you're going to answer and the the thing that he's looking for you to do is to answer not to say I've got it I've got it I've got it but the answer so that he can start to do something with you in your life amen he's screaming out he's saying what Christ is coming for his bride and no matter where she is she will answer she will answer whether she's in a chicken yard as an eagle whether she's in a bar or whether she's in a message Church she will answer because he won't lose one and he's not leaving until we get out of here amen listen if they're feeding pigs somewhere they'll still hear the call and they'll come back to the father's home church this is a work of his doing it's not yours and it's not mine it is his and we have to rest on the fact that he's the one that's doing it amen and our security our Assurance our faith our rest our trust our peace is in that not in ourselves not in ourselves amen he says and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed he says not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called there's a difference now it's not just calling out a people but it's calling out a people for relationship he says the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together so he says there's a message that's coming and there's a message that's come it's over with now the call is already here and what is it behold the bridegroom cometh that's what we've heard is there is a marriage there's a ceremony coming and you got to get ready for it you got to have what oil in your lamp it's the only requirement to go in oil in your lamp and then he'll come and he'll sweep you out of that amen but there's a Redemption coming and this purpose is a Unity it's a unification it's not just understanding and it's not just Revelation but it is an actual unification of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom and that's what this is all about amen I'm trying to get you to lift your eyes and see what you are what he says you are what he's ordained you to be and what power is available to you by the Holy Spirit to be what he said you were going to be the only thing holding us back is Will We believe because the scripture says if thou can'tst believe all things are possible we've got the the unfettered unlimited access of the blessings and power of God if we can't believe and put it into into a work in our lives amen God's calling out a bride without spot or wrinkle and that means you're going to be without spot a wrinkle whether you believe it or not he's going to do it but he's going to get you to the place where you start to believe it as much as he does and then it'll start to have a real effect amen this is not us choosing a road and choosing a path This Is Us coming to the path that he calls us to and then we start to willingly walk in that way he says the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together now notice we we talked in the the scripture in the opening scripture where it says that a man will leave his his mother and his father and cleave to his wife and the two shall be one flesh brother Brown I'm saying this is the same thing that's happening in this age he's using the same type of language there right he says the two shall be one flesh the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unite together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man now remember brother Bram said I am a son of man revealing the son of man I am a prophet revealing the prophet revealing the Christ right the Son of God in flesh so what we saw was not brother Branham we saw God using Brother Branham and what was it doing it was proving that he's here remember brother Brown says that's my ministry that's my message to declare him that he is here why to do signs and wonders no to unite with the bride that's what he's doing he's saying he's here he's ready so you got to get ready you got to get ready and that's what this message is doing is getting you ready brother Brown says if I can get the bride to stand still I'll put on her the Garment that she needs the wedding dress that she needs that's what he was here to do to get us ready with a call amen he says the church has to be the word because he is the word the two unite together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman not just any old preacher not just any priest it had to take a prophetic office he said see it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that's what happened in the ministry of a prophet was he made it so real that's the reason I believe that God is alive is because of the ministry of William Branham first and foremost but I've seen it now continue from William Branham into my life and into your life and into our lives and into our church to see that he's alive and well today we can't hold it just there it's got to come into US amen it will come down in human flesh Among Us make his word so real it'll unite the church in him as one the bride so our marriage is here now is the marriage time it says and then shall be shall go home to the wedding supper amen so we go to the marriage supper which always follows the marriage ceremony so it's got to happen here the marriage has to happen here the unification has to happen here he says she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage and he quotes Revelation fill your flesh self all of the Flesh of the Mighty Men because the marriage of the Lamb has come he says but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the Son of God again who's the son of man Christ so he's saying this unification will produce Christ all over again just like he did two thousand years ago not the church theologians not just great Mysteries and great doctrines and great preaching but it is the person of Christ he says the son of man the word and the church become one whatever the son of man did he was the word and the church does the same thing that's the path we're headed on The Works that I do shall you do also now what does that look like is that signs and wonders that's not the end goal here is it an amazing life it is amazing preaching it's amazing Services those are all good and great but the end goal is what unification it's Christ and you and all of us as one that's the end goal signs and wonders brother Brown says those are bait on a hook that's all it is it says you can't major on a minor but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be here but we're not here to do signs and wonders we're here to get in in one with Christ Jesus that's what we're here for so don't chase the signs and wonders because those follow those follow the unification they don't lead the unification and then you've got to get to him first amen what is it our inheritance is a unification with Christ that brings the same signs wonders life words uh motive objective everything that Christ had in my life and in your life as individuals we don't go in as a church unfortunately evening Light Fellowship isn't going in a Rapture it's going to be individuals that go in a Rapture amen listen to this there's going to be those that do turn back and we've seen it we've seen it we can't pretend that it hasn't happened we can't pretend that people haven't left the truth of this hour they have the scripture speaks of it in John it says they went out from us but they were not of us for if they have been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us listen people use this to turn feather people that leave their Church this has nothing to do with it listen as Ministry sometimes we like to think that we can feed the people better than anyone else that's not the way it works God knows where his sheep are best fed and God will lead his sheep to the to the placing of the of their need amen this is not what this is about this is not about me or brother Gerald trying to hold people here if we do that we get in God's way every single time we need to hold loosely to do it to be as careful and as considerate and as and put everything we've got into it but if God leaves you someplace else then go with our blessing because God has to feed a sheep and he'll take you where you're going to best be fed amen but everyone that left Egypt was not a True Believer we know that it was a mixed multitude and guess what in every Church there's three kinds of Believers whether we like it or not there's three kinds of believers and so there's going to be some that are straight unbelievers and they go out and they never come back then you've got to make believe that hangs around and that's just an unbeliever that's pretending and that's the hardest ones to spot many times and then you have the real believer and guess what it's not for us to say who's who the Rapture decides that the resurrection decides who's who it's up for us to treat each other as Christ would treat each and every one of us all the time no matter what no matter where we're at in our life amen but listen not everyone that starts the journey not everyone that says I believe the message of the hour not everyone that says amen during the service is going to make it in a rapture it's not true because Paul John speaks clearly that there were some that did those exact things and then they walked away so there are going to be some that don't make it amen but the bride will not be in that group obviously she's going to make it now Paul would talk about this he says if for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor now you cannot be a transgressor under the blood of Jesus Christ because all your sins are covered you can't God can't even see sin in you he can't attribute it to you so the only way you can become a transgressor is to go back to what you used to be which is under the law you can get out from Grace you can get under the out from under the blood and you can go back to the way things were and that takes you to the law and that's what makes you a transgressor is you go back to the way you were that's the only thing that makes it that way amen now people will look at that and say well look I I did something I used to do I listened to that rock and roll I used to like whatever it might be pick your poison pick your your bad habits that maybe you've tripped up and done again they say well that's me brother John that's it I'm out I'm out no Paul says if I build again he didn't say if I trip up he didn't say if I fall he didn't save Satan gets one over on me he doesn't say if you have a moment of weakness and you do something you didn't that you used to do that you're out no he says if I build it up again if I go back and I try and recreate try and rebuild try and redo all of those things and get back what I had before that's when I'm out from under grace and I'm now back under the law and that leads to death falling and tripping is not is is not what takes you back because remember a righteous man falls seven times and then he gets up again don't worry about tripping up just make sure you're continuing to go on and not going back and building what you used to what you used to do get away from those things he says for I through the law and dead to the law that I might live unto God I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me what's he say in church he's saying I have Christ Living in me and that's where I live the life I do that's how I can do the things I do I look and I make choices that lead to certain pain to lead to to certain suffering that that make life difficult for me even to my own death and yet I do it and I'm doing it why because Christ is living inside of me that's the only reason I can do it and that's the only reason you can do it is if you recognize that it's him that's doing it and him that's driving you amen something kept Paul going kept Paul going no matter what listen he went all the way to his death willingly willingly and nothing held him back from it Paul had ministers leave Paul had people turn their backs on him Paul got backstabbed Paul got thrown out of churches pug was he was whipped multiple times he was stoned and left for dead he was put in prison and nothing stopped Paul from serving Christ because there was something inside of him that kept going no matter what there was a deep calling to the deep and it was pushing him all the road to Eternity there's nothing going to hold him back amen but I want to put this in marriage terms because that's how we understand things these days we're talking about no turning back and we we talked about marriage and divorce a while ago and how Jesus said it was not so from the beginning divorce is the way to turn back divorce is a way to say I don't like where I'm at I want to go do something else and we talked about how we had to die to our first husband our first husband had to die and that was what our original nature that's what had to die and if we go back to that then something's wrong amen now we're entering into marriage with Christ as the bride of Christ and there's no turning back from that there is no divorce because why from the beginning it was not so it wasn't even an option from the beginning and what we're entering into as the bride of Christ is we're entering into a relationship from which there's no turning back now Hebrews 6 says this it says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh in other words he says you can't go back to your old husband and be in with Christ there is no back and forth with him you're either married to him or you're not you're either with him or you're not but you're not dating in the note and then dating and then no no no it's your end or you're out now people have looked at this in the prophet of God would preach on this and they would say well it sounds like you can get the Holy Ghost and lose it he says no if it were possible then but he says it's impossible for you to get the Holy Ghost and lose it because the scripture says you are sealed till the day of your Redemption seal that's it Neato done nothing can change it you get the Holy Ghost God will never pull it from you now he'll pull away the feeling of his presence you get out of here you get out of his way you get out of the word of God he'll pull that back that's no problem to say that but your soul is sealed but you'll lose Victory because of it you'll lose overcoming power in these different things because you choose willingly to get away from him but your soul is sealed there's no changing those things amen but what if you go back it means that you never entered in that's what he's saying here is you went back to your first husband and that means it didn't die when you got baptized it means that you didn't truly let go you didn't truly surrender and you're going back because you realize it's back there to go back to there's something waiting for you and that's why you can walk away is because you think it's there and what is it he says it's what it's a you're crucifying you're putting him to an open shame because you married him and you took on his name Christian but all the world sees is what cheating Christian because on one hand you say I'm married to Christ and then on the other side you live according to the world and the things of the world he says you can't do both at the same time if you do it you're re-crucifying him he says and he won't he won't allow that so if you're going back and forth guess what you're not in yet I'm not saying you can't get in don't say well I'm bad I'm always up and down I'm in and out brother John that's okay but you got to get in you got to get in so you never get out again that's what we're looking for and that's what the new birth is is you're in and that's it it's done you're sealed to the day of your Redemption amen now some people would say that this is speaking of Believers and they would say you can get the Holy Ghost and then lose it in these different things but Paul clarifies it himself as he continues now listen to this he says for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off to upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receives blessing from God so I want you to catch that he says there's herbs and plants and good things that receive rain and are blessed by that rain but I want you to notice they're intentionally planted it says for those by whom it is dressed somebody planted it and somebody's taking care of those herbs and plants and vegetables and fruits and all these different things and is taking care of it to help it produce what it's supposed to produce right and there's rain coming down and those plants are blessed by that rain listen there's rain coming down this morning and in theory all of us are blessed by it right but I want you to notice that they are good plants to start plants don't decide if they're going to be a good plant or a bad plant they are what they are and guess what the Holy Spirit Reign blesses a good plant and it causes it to bring forth the fruit that's inside of it because of the seed that's in it but listen verse 8 it says but that which bear thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned so you have plants there that are not planted they just are there because they just blew in and they're in the same atmosphere they're in the same Services they're under the same hearing of the word and guess what they produce thorns and Briars under the same anointing under the same Holy Spirit Reign under the same message under the same Ministry you can have good and bad from the exact same thing and what determines it the seed that's inside of it that's the only thing amen what is it there's nothing in a briar or a thorn to bring forth fruit all it can bring forth is thorns and Briars it can only be prickly no matter what no matter how often you get it in the presence of God it's still going to be a briar and a thorn nothing changes it and what is it it's the predestination of God he chose you and everything else that blows in it's just going to be what it's going to be he says in verse 9 but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak accompany salvation so often we're saying get get them to Christ get them saved he says there's things that accompany salvation there's more to it than salvation there's more to this than just saying I accept the finished work of Calvary there's more to happen there's more to come there's a greater walk there's a greater Revelation there's a greater power there's a greater anointing than just saying I accept the finished work of Calvary because there's a life that has to come behind it amen we're sealed to the day of the Holy Ghost amen this is not just a taste because remember it says they have tasted the good things of God they've partaken of it but they don't have it a taste isn't what makes you a believer no you got to get into it you got to become a part of it you got to take it in there and then you gotta you gotta really dig into it amen but look at the planting look at the planting here because there's clearly two different groups here and they didn't choose themselves fruit tree is a fruit tree it can't choose to be a briar or a thorn and a briar and a thorn can't choose to be a fruit tree they are what they are and it's by God's predestination it's by God's choosing that we are these things amen listen brother Brahm says the man didn't have a wife the wife and the man was the same thing he had the feminist and masculine spirit in himself so we use these terms wife but that's a modern thing because in the original it wasn't a man and his wife it wasn't a husband and wife it was just them they were one it's funny we have these you know we have all the pronouns today he she her him they them guess what they were them but they were one that was the original pronouns they need to go back to this I guess amen but he says he didn't have a wife he says the man and the wife was the same thing they were one remember he's not talking about when they had two bodies he's saying they were one in Adam he says and he who Satan had to separate and take a byproduct after the whole creation was made no female created by God in the original creation can do a thing like that she was made thus to do it and he knew she would do it if he didn't he wasn't God now we've covered this before and so I'm only going to take just a brief moment to cover it but remember Eve could not fall as long as she was in Adam literally as long as she was an atom because he says Adam had the feminish and the masculine spirit inside of him so they were all in one body and so Eve could not go her own way she could not be separated out from Adam I'm calling her Eve the woman right she couldn't get away from him so she couldn't have a separate mind she couldn't have a separate set of legs to take her away she couldn't get away from him they were Bound in the same body and so she was safe as long as she stayed there but then God says it's not good for man to be alone he said he needs to have that part taken out of him and so he takes a rib I was listening to somebody the other day and they said if you look at that word rib it actually means side so it's like God took a half of the man and put it out and built a woman out of it and that's what she is she's the other half but he took it out and he put that in a body and now Satan can get at her because it's two separate bodies the man can be here and the woman can be here and Satan can be talking to the woman over here and the man doesn't know about it before they were right here so Satan couldn't get at her but now that they're separate he can get at her but then the woman she's put into that separate body and she's capable now of stepping away from Unity she can choose to stay by Adam's side all day long and she'll never get touched if she and Adam had stayed walking side by side all the time Satan would have had a hope he couldn't have gotten to her because Adam would have been there to protect her to stop it to step in the way but because she separated from Adam and I've said because Adam let her out of his sight right let's not put it all in the womb because the man didn't cleave then she got out on her own and she was a target for Satan but the reason I'm saying this is because now we have a second Adam and that's Christ amen and we are the second Eve and he has a body prepared for him and see now we're two separates now we've got Jonathan curlette and his will and his ideas and his thing and we've got Jesus Christ over here and guess what Satan can get at me when we're like this but he's saying what he's trying to do is he's trying to bring us back like this so that him and I are one so that you and him are one so that we're all in one same body right the head above the intelligence tied to us the the body of Christ and so now there is no separation there is no getting us away from the presence of God there is no getting us away from the word because we are the presence of God we are the word of God made flesh today that's what he's trying to restore us back amen that's what brother Brown says the man didn't have a wife there was no him and her it was just them so now there is no Bride In Christ it is just him that's what he's bringing us back to is it's just him we have no head it's him and he has no body but us together we make the perfect body and that's what it's Christ the word and it's all of us together inside of that amen so it's not this push-pull game see that's where we're at today is we're in this flesh and it's so difficult because the flesh is pulling and then this Holy Spirit in US is resisting and so we've got this battle but we're coming to that perfect Unity to where what the flesh has no control over us where we have total victory in our lives amen that's why Paul would say nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ that liveth in me why because it wasn't Paul and it's not you and it's not me that's living it's Christ that's living in us this is the unification that's happening and the hardest thing for us to stand is understand is what's happening when it's not fully completed because they're sitting there we're saying brother John I'm not there yet brother John's not there yet we're not there yet nobody here is there yet because we're not gone in a Rapture but we're building up to it and so day by day we ought to be seeing a progression listen if we're sitting here and we're looking at the opening of the word and all these things and saying I'm waiting until the end for this to happen you're going to be too late because he's doing it today he's doing it right now in our midst he's doing it in your life today whether you realize it or not and if nothing's happening if nothing's changing week to week month to month year to year then I'm sorry to say you're not in you've got to come in because we're always progressing we look at you know you look at a graph of our daily lives and are we doing well or not we're up we're down we're up and down but the thing is the trend line ought to be going upwards and if we're going upwards that's what's happening is that we're dying out and Christ is gaining control inside of us more and more every day and there's more of a surrender and there's more of a dying out and as that happens then we start to grow and grow and grow in Christ and then what happens is the last little bit is the quickest step but there's got to be that growth there's got to be that maturity there's got to be that change day in and day out week in and week out as he's drawing us closer to him that's what's supposed to be happening until the end is we are him and he is us that's where we're going in all this that's why marriage can only be between a man and a woman because if you have a man and a man you have two heads and nobody if you have a woman and a woman you have two bodies and no head it has to be a man in the head and the woman the body and she's doing what his desire is and he's leading and guiding her and he's loving her and he's nourishing her because she is him that's why it has to work that way amen the Bram says this he says they want to shortcut to Heaven taking as much of the world as they can take you can't take any of it there's no shortcuts you come the way of Calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the Brazen serpent he says you die you actually die and I listen to this and he he's practically crying he says oh God why can't I say it right you die you literally die to yourselves you die to the things of the world and are born Anew amen he says no world the things of the world is dead there's no shortcut see they want to come right quick they don't want to grow they want to say I accept Jesus as my savior and then boom they're out doing signs and wonders they want all the victory they want everything there and he says they don't want to progress they don't want to grow they don't want to mature in Christ they just want to do it and then be done and then say that's it and I don't have to do anything that's not the way it works children are born men are matured you aren't born a woman you're born a baby you turn into a young lady and then you turn into a woman you're born a baby you turn into a boy and then you grow into a man and it's no different for a son or a daughter of God you grow into it to be a mature adult in the in the kingdom of God Amen what is it that we're doing why are we walking through this desert why is life so hard because it's getting us ready for Unity it's separating us out listen there's not a whole lot out in the desert to distract you is there deserts are pretty boring they're Bland they're Dusty they're dry there's not a lot of water there's certainly not a lot of entertainment there's not a lot of the world out in the desert he had to get them out there to separate them to get them ready to go in to full unity and that's what's happening amen what is it it's the power of the Holy Ghost to resurrect and Rapture a church that's what he's building us towards he says now notice at the opening of The Seven Seals in Revelation 10 the full word is being born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth amen Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever notice he says it's been born into manifestation it's not just head knowledge it's not just sitting in church saying amen but there is a birth that has to happen for this to grow for something to occur for something to become real he says it has to be born and you can't be educated into it you can't be taught into it you can't be preached into it it has to be a birth experience and a birth is an experience let me tell you when a baby's born and knows it's been born because everything changes in a moment the baby's in the womb and it's warm and it's fed it doesn't have hunger everything is just perfect and then all of a sudden the squeeze happens and things are very uncomfortable and then all of a sudden things get very bright and very cold because it's born a baby knows when it's born and you'll know when you're born too because everything changes everything's changes you come into light you start breathing on your own you start breathing in a different way you start living a different way why because there's a spirit inside you that's doing it you're not dependent on your mother now you're doing it all yourself amen and that's why the Holy Ghost is an experience it's not a Doctrine it's not saying amen it's not even understanding what's happened through this message and what's happened here it is a new birth experience and you'll know it because you'll start living a life that you've never been able to live before but things changed because in the beginning brother Brown says look he says first was just a covenant he's saying there's only one Covenant a singular Covenant he says Adam and Eve were co-equal one man and one woman it was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh same DNA everything and it was under one Covenant and that Covenant was obey don't eat the fruit that's it that was the only Covenant he says but notice now after the beginning after the beginning After Time began back in there it was eternity it's over now after the fall was made by Eve after the fall there was need to be another covenant made he says this is going to stumble you but I'm going to give you the scripture to prove it's the truth God at the beginning made one of a kind it was not a man and a woman that were different they were one of a kind they were the same thing expressed through two bodies but it was the same thing and he's saying that's how God makes it is he makes it the same thing that's what we're being restored back to One of a Kind the same person he says but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant the original Covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there's another covenant made now she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant one for the man and one for the woman he says two covenants now that closes the beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't so in the beginning so everything that's happened since they left Eden has been what fall new Covenants and the Covenant was had to do with pain and suffering and difficulty and all these things but he says we've got to come back to the original Covenant because that's where the unity is he says we've got another Covenant now it's another Covenant now there is a covenant for the product and the byproduct and we've covered this before but from the beginning it wasn't so as he's pointing here and that's what we want to look at he says you've got to come back to the truth to find out what it is see we talked about the opening of the seals we talked about the the the the revealing of the word and these different things he says it's to what it's to bring you back let it not just go to our heads but let it let it be something that has an effect in our lives he says you've got to come back to the truth to find out what it is it's always been that way that's the regular Covenant with God from the beginning first before the beginning from the beginning there was just one in one one man one woman after the sin came in there was one man and a bunch of women he says it runs that way in nature every animal and human beings and natural flesh is animal we're mammal we know that all of us see and it's all God's nature and opportunity so if we stay there in that condition a man with a bunch of women we're most miserable listen a man without the Holy Ghost is a beast that's what he's pointing to here and listen even David had 500 wives and wasn't satisfied and then Solomon doubled down on it and he had a thousand and were they satisfied no and what did it produce chaos pain and suffering split the it split the the the the country amen that's what happens under the second Covenant is that all it brings is a beast nature that has its way and that's never going to get us anywhere he says but now that the seals are opened that's why brother Branham kept pointing to 63. things change then he says after now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word the spirit of Truth that's why you got to be born into this body because the spirit of Truth is going to direct you to the word that's going to tell you what to do and how to do it today that explains why all the mistakes has been down Through the Ages because the seals was not open this was not revealed it's true what happened they left their first love in the Ephesian Church agent when Paul was the messenger and they left it they fell away and all of a sudden they started making mistakes why because the book was closed up listen Paul brother Brown says I don't bring a new message I preach what Paul preached it's not that it wasn't known it had to be restored that means it was known and then they fell away from it and now we're being brought back to it so that we can have the fullness of the same experience that they had in their lives amen he says now there is a true woman a true woman virgin that marries her husband and lives and she is a blessed thing to the man if God could have given his son any better thing than a wife he would have given that to him that's us you are a blessed thing to Christ when we're in our proper position we're not supposed to be a hindrance we're supposed to be a blessing we're supposed to be an encouragement we're supposed to be what doing things for the kingdom of God and for his benefit and for its benefit when we're in our position he says now so sisters that's where you ought to be is you ought to be what in a place where you're a blessed thing to your husband and not a cursed thing but it's up to him to let you know what he wants you to do men are poor communicators that's where we Step Up except one that raised his eyebrow to me just now most of us are poor communicators right but if we can give them the right vision then they can help us to get there and they're a blessed thing but often what happens is they're doing their own thing because we don't give them the direction they need and then we get mad because they didn't do what we thought instead of what we said amen he says now look he says in the final analysis look now he says there's one Jesus Christ one man God Emmanuel do you believe that he says but the members of his wife the members plural of his wife singular are many see thousands times thousands of thousands his wife the bride the church he says you understand now he says that's why he said to Adam before sex was ever induced or introduced multiply and replenish the earth when he was yet in the beginning when he was yet both male and female in himself he says there it shows them that the bride has got to come from the word by spiritual multiplication multiplications C replenishing the Earth Adam didn't fulfill this Adam and the woman didn't fulfill us he said multiply and replenish the Earth and they didn't do it they did it once and they did it wrong and so they couldn't do it properly and so what happens is Christ the second Adam has to do it and I want you to understand he always leads by example he leads by example so he doesn't tell you to do something he doesn't tell you have an experience he doesn't tell you to go through something that he hasn't gone through because he was tempted in every manner like we were and yet without sin but even his birth was what showing us how we're supposed to be born we weren't meant to be born by physical intimacy remember the prophet God spoke of it he said we were supposed to be what by the spoken word brother Bram didn't make that up he took it back to the word and we're going to read it right now listen Isaiah 7 14 says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel that's a prophetic word and listen the word of God is always prophetic it's always prophetic it has life it has power and it's always pointing to something that's going to happen and then it happens right because he said his my word won't return to me void that means the word is prophetic always what's going to happen is going to happen amen and what it is is he's giving a prophecy here of how the birth is supposed to happen in humanity and then so he gives it there and he gives the word but then what happens we go to Luke 1 and it says and the angel came in to Mary and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled that is saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be listen there's a call that goes forth and sometimes we don't realize why is he talking to me like this what favor have I garnered in my life and listen she was a chosen vessel and you're no different you have favor because you're chosen not because you're some awesome thing he chose you before the foundation of the world and that's why he's talking to you the way he is that's why you get to hear the message preached is because he chose you before the foundation of the world to hear it and to be blessed and highly favored under the hearing of that word says the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seen I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God that's how the new birth is supposed to happen that's how our original birth was supposed to happen was the overshadowing of what the Holy Spirit now let you let me read a quote here to put this into context and this is something that that has been used so often to put down the experience of the new birth brother Brown says that's some of the Mysteries the angel is supposed to wind up he says all the Mysteries the mysteries of God he's pointing to Revelation 10 7 that says that the sounding of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished and he says there's a bunch of mysteries in that mystery and he says one of them is the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation and that's where everybody stops that uses this quote wrong and they say see it's just accepting the word of God but then they don't continue and says but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did listen I don't know for sure but I don't imagine Mary knew when she was first pregnant the moment when conception happened was by the holy spirit so there was not necessarily A you know I don't want to be crude but when a man and a woman are together there is a sensation that comes with these things you know that something's going on you know that something's happened but because it's the holy spirit it's a supernatural birth there was no physical Sensation that would have accompanied this so Mary is pregnant and she doesn't even know it initially that's why brother Brahm says you can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation is because it's supernatural you may not feel it you may not know that you've got the Holy Ghost today but he says it's always followed by the person of Christ performing in you the same works that she did that he did so after a while guess what Mary's belly started to show that she was pregnant maybe she had morning sickness maybe she was getting really tired maybe her skin was starting to Glow everything in her was starting to change but for a little while she didn't even know if she was pregnant or not until she started to show and what brother Brian was getting at is he's saying listen you can shout and you can scream and you can dance and you can say amen and you can have all this wonderful time in the presence of God but he says that doesn't prove you've got the Holy Ghost he says the actual infilling of the Holy Ghost he says may be without sensation you can get that today he says but there's always an effect after you get the Holy Ghost and it's not just saying Amen to the word but it's the word living in you because listen after a while Mary started to show and in a while it was very obvious that Mary had the Word of Life inside of her wasn't it because she was pregnant and her belly got bigger and bigger and bigger listen I'm not saying you can't have sensation when you get the Holy Ghost I believe you will I did but that doesn't make it the proof the proof is not the sensation the proof is the life because listen there's been examples where women said I'm pregnant and guess what their belly started getting bigger and bigger and bigger but after the 10th month they had to recognize I was just chubby not pregnant because after nine months life must come forward you say you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've been filled with the holy spirit that means there has to be a life that comes forth and the proof is the life not the sensation you had at the moment you think you got it because you're going to have lots of Sensations in life you can have lots of Sensations in service you can have lots of Sensations under the preaching of the word but the proof is when what your life changes when something happens inside of you that's never happened before because you can have all the sensations of pregnancy and never get pregnant they have what's called a false pregnancy and you can literally feel like you're pregnant and show it in every way and not be pregnant there's got to be something that happens and if you have the Life of Christ in you it's going to show it's going to show what is it you'll talk a certain way that's not proof proof is not how you talk the proof is how you walk proof is how you live your life amen brother Perhaps it is and now the Christ in the church is just being made known this is 63. after the opening of the seals he says it's just being made known it's just starting to happen he says the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband he says notice God is the husband of the church and the church is his bride the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth what is the New Birth when you realize you're a part of him how do you know you're a part of him because he's given you a part of him he's given you the Holy Ghost he's quickened the sea Gene of God inside of you and something changes and you recognize I'm a part of him I'm a part of the Bride I've been called out I've been positionally placed I've been predestinated to live different than I've been living all of my life he says now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in harmony so we have to have the right revelation and and God expressing it through his word how by the same actions the same things he did making the word manifest so we can't just sit under a great revelatory ministry opening up the word and showing us the depths of the word but it has to produce a life it has to produce the works of Christ in our lives to confirm that he's with us because otherwise this is going to kill us it'll do it every time and will get dry and we'll get formal and we'll get starchy and we'll wonder where the victory went and it's because the spirit isn't quickening it in our lives he says the same things that he did making the word manifest we're in the time of the manifestation of the sons of God that's now it's here and he says it's just starting it's just being made known he says oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is so sure stop thinking that you're going to falter and fail stop thinking that you don't have what it takes that you don't have the right stuff he's already said he's given you everything you need and you've just got to mature and grow into it that's the only thing you have to do is say Lord let me grow and mature under the under the preaching the hearing of the word Lord let your Holy Spirit take effect in my life so that what I'm hearing becomes victory in my life that gives me quickening power that gives me overcoming power amen and on the other side don't you hate it when preachers do this stop thinking you'll make it because you're so good stop thinking you'll make it because you're so strong that's never going to get us across the Finish Line amen but what it is a work of Grace from start to finish and it's him that's going to carry us through all the way it's him that's going to clean us it's him that's going to make us a bride without spot or wrinkle as we close first Peter 5 8 says be sober be vigilant I'm not saying sit back I'm not saying relax he says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil has a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world in other words everybody's dealing with it maybe not the same thing you're dealing with but everybody's got a battle on their hands everybody God has a fight everybody's struggling everybody's looking for greater Victory everybody's looking for overcoming power everybody's looking to get out of here everybody don't think you're special in that sense he says but the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while you're going to suffer a while he says after that he will make you perfect he will establish he will strengthen and he will settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen amen God bless you and stand this morning listen like I said I'm not saying relax I'm saying relax about the outcome trust have faith believe be encouraged amen but that doesn't mean stop fighting because you got to keep fighting but there's a victory that's been promised amen but it's what it's through the relationship with Christ it's through the overcoming power of the holy spirit that Victory is going to come so keep fighting don't stop don't slow down amen why because you're fighting is that what's going to get us the victory no the victory is because he said we're going to be an overcoming bride amen that we're going to have overcoming power there's nothing to go back to now there's nothing to go back to there's no turning back there's nothing behind us that's better than what we have here the best days are not behind us Church the best days are not behind us the best days are ahead of us and guess what there's going to be more battles and that means there's going to be more victories and there's going to be harder battles and that means there's going to be bigger victories and there's no turning back from these things we've got to go through it we've got to go through it Israel had to go through it for 10 years in the in the land of Canaan but they always kept pressing forward and God gave them Victory after Victory after Victory and all they had to do was stay true to what his word said that's it the only Covenant that's required of us now he didn't even say if you obey he said he swore by himself that's what takes us through is he swore by himself but he knows that he's got a bribe for destiny that she's going to obey and she's going to step right into her place in the word and she'll be perfect spotless without spot and without wrinkle that's you that's me by God's grace and always want us to do believe step into it and keep moving forward amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're so
