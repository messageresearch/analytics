[35:50] with us now we ask in Jesus name amen
[35:53] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[35:55] Second Peter chapter 1
[35:57] second Peter chapter 1 just spoke
[35:59] briefly with Brother David Nash this
[36:01] afternoon so he did get in safely last
[36:03] night I knew that and and no no issues
[36:06] there so very glad for that and he asked
[36:09] me to thank the church for their
[36:10] offering and you were very generous and
[36:12] took him by surprise I think and I
[36:14] talked to him about you know the
[36:16] different needs that he had and trips he
[36:18] was making and that and I said you know
[36:20] um you know are are your your costs
[36:22] covered for your your Honduras trip and
[36:24] he said well they are now and he meant
[36:27] the offering we gave him and I said no
[36:28] Brother David that's not for your trip
[36:30] that's for you that's that's how you
[36:32] make a living is off of this and and I
[36:34] said so I'll I'll talk to to the to the
[36:37] trustees or or the treasurer and and see
[36:39] if we can't pay for your ticket as well
[36:41] so I talked to brother Mark and so we
[36:42] paid for his ticket as well so he
[36:44] thanked us for that as well but it
[36:46] really really touched his heart and he
[36:47] teared up on me there just a little just
[36:50] it took him by surprise that we'd
[36:51] support him not just his ministry but
[36:54] him and his family he's got needs he's
[36:57] 71 years old and and he has needs and
[36:59] they've got costs and these days
[37:01] everybody has them and so he was very
[37:03] thankful for that so asked me to to to
[37:05] just pass on the appreciation to the
[37:06] church and you know he was saying on the
[37:08] way of the airport he says you guys get
[37:10] the credit for what happens on those
[37:12] those trips I can't go if people can't
[37:14] support me and if people can't pay for
[37:16] it he can only cover so much himself and
[37:18] and so he said the credit goes to the
[37:20] people that support me so you get to be
[37:22] missionaries when you pay your ties and
[37:24] that's where it comes from it's ties
[37:25] ties aren't just for the Pastor it's for
[37:27] the ministry amen and that's what we do
[37:29] and we support multiple ministers around
[37:31] the globe and brother brother David Nash
[37:33] is one of them and and we do that
[37:35] because that's what's that's what it's
[37:36] meant to do so we don't need to take an
[37:38] offering up for that that comes out of
[37:40] the ties that's what you've already paid
[37:41] in so that's a we've done but thank you
[37:43] for your faithfulness in that also
[37:46] thanks for the hard work going into the
[37:47] meetings and the specials and it
[37:49] certainly was appreciative and the
[37:51] anointing that comes with those things
[37:52] it's a game Cher many times for a
[37:54] service so especially sister Moren and
[37:56] sister Priscilla doing their specials
[37:58] and I know Priscilla did it with very
[38:00] little practice kind of spur the moment
[38:02] and so we appreciate that as well we
[38:04] still got many sick out many recovering
[38:07] I'm still not there 100% I've been
[38:09] fighting through this for about a week
[38:10] but it's not got me yet and so I'm here
[38:13] amen and I'm I'm happy to be here for
[38:14] that but just keep each one in prayer
[38:16] Brother Paul's got a viral throat
[38:18] infection so remember him especially and
[38:21] the different ones so but we're thankful
[38:23] to be here amen I'm thankful to to be
[38:25] here behind the pulpit it's funny you
[38:26] get a break and then you're ready to get
[38:28] right back in the saddle and itching to
[38:29] to get up there so I'm trusting that's a
[38:31] good sign amen second Peter chapter 1 we
[38:34] ought to be able to say this almost by
[38:36] memory now amen 2 Peter 1 and verse4
[38:39] says whereby are given unto us exceeding
[38:41] great and precious promises that by
[38:44] these you might be partakers of the
[38:46] divine nature having escaped the
[38:48] corruption that is in the world through
[38:50] lust the divine nature is in your soul
[38:52] and the corruption that's in your body
[38:54] is through lust amen so you got a flesh
[38:56] thing and you've got a a divine nature
[38:58] thing and he says we've got to press to
[38:59] the divine nature even though we're
[39:01] stuck in something that's corrupted
[39:03] there's a battle that's got to be one
[39:04] here and he says let's focus on the
[39:06] divine nature he says besides this
[39:08] giving all diligence add to your faith
[39:10] virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to
[39:12] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[39:14] patience and patience godliness and to
[39:16] Godliness brotherly kindness he says and
[39:18] then to brotherly kindness at charity
[39:21] amen God bless you you can have your
[39:23] seats this evening and as you can
[39:25] imagine we're continuing on and
[39:26] manifesting time and we're going to be
[39:28] speaking on this this thought of Charity
[39:30] but I'm going to call this a Capstone
[39:32] and and brother Bram I'll read a quote
[39:34] and then just step into some things here
[39:36] but brother Brown would say this he says
[39:37] the next thing then add charity which is
[39:40] love and he says that's the capping
[39:42] Stone and we're we're going to be
[39:44] talking about what this charity really
[39:45] means and there's lots of pieces to this
[39:47] and I've got notes and notes on top of
[39:50] notes with this and it's pretty chunky
[39:51] so we're just going to take one chunk
[39:53] every service and some of them will be
[39:55] shorter services and some will be longer
[39:56] services and this one will be a little
[39:58] bit shorter maybe tonight but I just
[40:00] want to take my time with this because
[40:02] when we're talking about the Holy Ghost
[40:04] you can get all the way through these
[40:05] Christian attributes and if you don't
[40:07] get to charity then everything you've
[40:09] done up to that point is
[40:11] wasted it's the way it is you've got to
[40:13] go all the way or else it's as if you
[40:16] never went anywhere if you come up only
[40:18] to brotherly kindness you'll be judged
[40:20] on works that's what you're left with
[40:22] because you're not going to be in the
[40:23] bride you're not going to go in a
[40:24] Rapture because you got to have the same
[40:26] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[40:27] in your body for you to go on that
[40:29] Rapture so you've got to go all the way
[40:31] to the top and if you don't go there
[40:33] then you're going to go only by works
[40:34] and chances are you'll fall and slip
[40:36] away to a degree because you didn't go
[40:38] all the way with the word you didn't go
[40:39] all the way to Perfection like Paul said
[40:41] Paul said go on to Perfection and
[40:42] brother Bram says leave The Works behind
[40:45] and leave the doctrines behind and go
[40:47] into perfect love and that's what we're
[40:49] talking about in these things and you
[40:50] know what that tells me when Paul says
[40:51] go on to Perfection it means there's
[40:54] more than works it means there's more
[40:55] than doct it means there's more than how
[40:57] I dress and the things I say but there's
[40:59] a an encompassing life there's an
[41:01] indwelling that we're talking about in
[41:03] these things because those things are
[41:05] great we've got to know what we believe
[41:06] we've got to know the doctrine that we
[41:08] have and why we do the things we do and
[41:10] these these things it's structural for
[41:12] the believer but it's not life but when
[41:14] we come to charity now we're talking
[41:16] about the literal life of Jesus Christ
[41:18] brother Brown would say this he says you
[41:20] take a young Minister now this isn't
[41:22] about a minister this is this could be
[41:23] about anyone this could apply to anyone
[41:25] but he says you take a young Minister
[41:27] that feels the call of God in his heart
[41:29] he'll repent of his sins go off to
[41:31] school get his education which is fine
[41:33] he'll come back he will still smoke
[41:35] cigarettes maybe maybe he's still got a
[41:37] lustful spirit and he'll say oh I don't
[41:38] want to do that Lord take it away from
[41:41] me he says the spirit of God will come
[41:44] and sanctify his soul it'll clean his
[41:47] soul up it'll it'll take his it says and
[41:49] take that desire away from him then
[41:51] he'll be brought right up to the
[41:53] borderline set right in the meetings and
[41:55] watch the working of the Holy Spirit see
[41:58] others get healed hear them speak with
[42:00] tongues and see signs and wonders done
[42:03] he says you can have a Sanctified soul
[42:04] you can have a cleaned up soul but
[42:07] that's not all the way that's just a
[42:09] preparation for what's going to come
[42:10] next he says they'll sit around and
[42:13] watch it but they're afraid to put their
[42:17] hand on
[42:18] it they'll look and they'll see what
[42:21] other people do with it and they'll see
[42:23] the the signs and the Wonders and the
[42:24] effects on their life and they're afraid
[42:26] to put their hand on it they're afraid
[42:28] to go through the change that those
[42:29] people had to go through he says that's
[42:32] that borderline believer that's the
[42:34] fellow if he ever turns away there's no
[42:36] more remission of sins for him he says
[42:38] he'll stand right up here even look over
[42:41] into the land who's received the
[42:43] knowledge of the truth knew that that
[42:45] was right but because of prestige well
[42:48] if I do this it'll do this and if I
[42:49] accept that it'll do this he says see
[42:52] they refuse it and they walk away from
[42:54] it you'll see people that come into this
[42:56] church even from out in the community
[42:58] and whatnot and they've got to recognize
[43:00] that if they want what we've got they've
[43:03] got to get what we have they've got to
[43:06] go through the same process and it's
[43:07] going to have the same effect and it
[43:09] might be different for each one of us
[43:11] some of us have had to give up family
[43:12] more than others some of us have had to
[43:14] change relationships and careers and and
[43:16] all these sorts of things but no matter
[43:18] what when you lay hold of it there's
[43:20] going to be a change in your life and
[43:22] you've got to be willing to pay the
[43:23] price and you've got to count that cost
[43:25] ahead of time and really what he's
[43:26] saying is they've counted the cost and
[43:28] they've said it's not worth
[43:29] it he says they refuse it they walk away
[43:32] from it and he said Paul said count the
[43:35] blood of the Covenant wherewith he was
[43:36] Sanctified an Unholy thing they went
[43:39] that far to bring him on up a step to
[43:41] look over into and have a knowledge of
[43:44] it he says he was saved and Sanctified
[43:47] but comes up here to look over to
[43:49] receive the holy ghost that new birth he
[43:52] wants nothing to do with it now I can
[43:55] speak maybe to to the young people
[43:56] tonight that there's going to be a time
[43:58] and you look now and you look at Mom and
[44:00] you look at dad and you look at the the
[44:02] other people in the church and mostly
[44:03] the adults I would say and you can say
[44:05] I'm okay with dressing right and I'm
[44:07] okay with looking right and I'm okay
[44:09] with doing this and I'm okay with not
[44:10] doing that but that's not the end of it
[44:13] that's only the start of it because
[44:14] there has to come a time where you lay
[44:16] hold of eternal life the person of
[44:18] eternal life and when you do it will
[44:20] shake your life to the core everything
[44:23] changes when you get the Holy Ghost and
[44:25] you got to make a decision first that
[44:26] you want it cuz that'll take you through
[44:29] the statue of a perfect man and then
[44:31] having done that then you've got to lay
[44:32] hold and say now I want it I want it and
[44:35] I've gone through the process and I've
[44:37] I've gone through the pain and I've gone
[44:38] through the testing and the trials but I
[44:40] don't want to go there and then just sit
[44:42] there and not get it but I want this in
[44:43] my life and I want to go all the way
[44:45] with God Amen we see what happens and
[44:48] and you know everything we've talked
[44:50] about to this point is big and you go
[44:52] through those seven Christian attributes
[44:54] and it'll change your life and this
[44:55] signific ific way but there comes a
[44:58] point where You' got to make a decision
[44:59] Daniel had to make a decision Paul had
[45:01] to make a decision Peter had to make a
[45:03] decision the three Hebrew children had
[45:05] to make a decision David had to make a
[45:07] decision as to was he going to go on or
[45:09] was he going to stay back with everyone
[45:10] else and we've got to do the exact same
[45:13] thing and these things will develop our
[45:15] character then we'll see as we go into
[45:16] this tonight a little bit that all of
[45:18] this is really proving your character
[45:20] it's proving what's inside of you it's
[45:22] proving the attributes inside of you
[45:24] though but then we come to this fin one
[45:26] and brother brandham says it is the Holy
[45:28] Ghost and that's not an attribute it's a
[45:31] person and that's the big difference all
[45:33] the rest of these things were attributes
[45:35] but when we come to charity you don't
[45:37] have an attribute this isn't something
[45:39] you can put on and put off and you can
[45:41] turn on and turn off but it's a person
[45:43] and it's the person of Christ inside of
[45:45] our life amen this charity we're talking
[45:47] about it's a special thing brother BR
[45:49] would say this he says excuse this
[45:51] expression but I told my wife here not
[45:53] long ago we're both getting old and I
[45:55] said to her do you love me like you used
[45:57] to she said I certainly do and I said
[45:59] you know I love you so much till I would
[46:01] like to take you and pull you inside of
[46:03] me Co so we could be really be one more
[46:09] he wanted to be so much closer to his
[46:11] wife and of course we know brother bam
[46:12] traveled so much he was in the fields so
[46:14] much and then he would go off in the
[46:16] woods to try and decompress and but he
[46:18] said I love you so much that I just wish
[46:20] I could fold you into me so we could be
[46:22] more one than we are now he says now
[46:26] take that and multiply it by a 100
[46:28] million and you'll find out how that the
[46:30] believer Who falls in love with Christ
[46:33] wants to get into him because it's a
[46:37] love so all of these seven attributes
[46:40] that he's pulled out of your life here
[46:42] is developing a love for Christ that
[46:44] maybe you didn't even have in the first
[46:45] place it's drawing out that great
[46:48] internal desire it's the Deep calling to
[46:50] the deep and that's what's responding
[46:52] through all this and you get to the end
[46:54] and really what you're going to do is
[46:55] you're going to accept the marriage
[46:56] proposal that's what we're coming up to
[46:58] in the thing and this is a quote I've
[47:00] read many times in this series but it I
[47:02] always love to read it because I want to
[47:04] remind what's going on it says and here
[47:06] he's going to show us how that through
[47:08] these promises what we read in second
[47:10] Peter 1 we might be partakers of
[47:12] Christ's divine nature see we think all
[47:15] of those things was his divine nature no
[47:18] that's attributes the the divine nature
[47:19] is what makes all of those things live
[47:22] it's the thing that makes all of those
[47:23] things work the way they're truly
[47:24] supposed to work he says these mortal
[47:26] bodies how that we can be partakers but
[47:29] I'm going to tell you how to build your
[47:30] spiritual house where God can dwell he
[47:33] wants to dwell in you the whole goal the
[47:35] whole purpose of this message the whole
[47:37] purpose of what he's talking about is
[47:39] for you to get Christ in you that's the
[47:42] Great Commission that's what they're
[47:43] trying to get people to he says he wants
[47:46] to make you like himself himself he
[47:48] wants you to be reflecting his being
[47:51] continuously not just one moment or one
[47:54] day but a continuous shine Shining Light
[47:56] that everyone can see he says we're not
[47:58] building an organization I'm not here
[48:00] this morning to build an organization
[48:02] Christ never sent me to build
[48:03] organization but Christ sent me to build
[48:06] individuals to the statue of Jesus
[48:08] Christ that they might be the PowerHouse
[48:11] and the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[48:14] his word he says by his word see build
[48:17] up the individual to that place so we
[48:20] come up through these seven attributes
[48:21] from Faith all the way to brotherly
[48:23] kindness and now that we're at the end
[48:24] of it and brother Adam is reminding us
[48:27] this is to build you to a place for God
[48:30] to dwell in amen these attributes these
[48:32] seven attributes from Faith through
[48:34] brotherly kindness they're the house
[48:36] that God has ordained and he has
[48:38] structured to live in but there is no
[48:40] one in the house yet and the purpose of
[48:43] a house is for somebody to live in it so
[48:46] all of this is a structure it's a place
[48:48] that God would be pleased to dwell in
[48:51] amen but God is potentially coming to
[48:53] you but unless you have the house built
[48:55] he he not going to come in but once the
[48:57] house is done now somebody's got the
[48:59] opportunity to come into these things
[49:01] you know it's interesting up by Brother
[49:03] Joe's house I saw you know they've
[49:05] knocked it down now but there was a
[49:06] house there for so long that God and and
[49:09] they had it built and they had the
[49:10] outside somewhat finished but nobody
[49:13] finished the house and what happened is
[49:15] the house eventually fell into disarray
[49:17] because there was nobody in it when
[49:19] somebody's in it then they take care of
[49:21] a house don't they you'll see somebody
[49:23] that lives in a house they maintain it
[49:24] and they make sure that everything's
[49:26] working because they want it to be
[49:27] comfortable for themselves and so when
[49:29] we build this house the point is to get
[49:31] the person inside of it that it was
[49:33] built for and not just have this
[49:35] beautiful
[49:36] building it has no purpose except for
[49:38] looks and that's not what God's Building
[49:40] is a thing just for looks but when we're
[49:42] reading in in second Peter 1 here and
[49:45] Peter says to add charity that's a word
[49:48] that only appears in the new testimony
[49:50] because that word charity and you'll
[49:51] hear brother bham talk about this a lot
[49:53] of times it's Agape it's divine love and
[49:56] I find it amazing that it's only in the
[49:58] New Testament because in the New
[49:59] Testament is the only place that this
[50:01] charity ever comes out because this
[50:03] Divine love could not be shown in the
[50:06] way that it's shown in the way it's
[50:07] meant to be shown except in the New
[50:09] Testament because in the Old Testament
[50:11] we're under the blood of bulls and goats
[50:13] and our sins are covered but the price
[50:15] isn't paid yet and so that Divine love
[50:18] is really the key to the kingdom and
[50:20] it's what we need in our lives but God
[50:22] can't give it to us because our sin
[50:24] there's a sin debt that's got to paid
[50:26] but then he comes to Calvary and he pays
[50:29] the price and as soon as the price is
[50:31] paid now access is made to God and now
[50:34] Divine love can project because when
[50:36] Divine love is projected Grace takes
[50:38] over brother brandham said and what
[50:40] happens is that we're now made
[50:41] acceptable in the Beloved and he can
[50:43] release Divine love to his bride the way
[50:45] that he always wanted he can give her
[50:47] the Holy Ghost he can indwell in her now
[50:50] because she's perfect in his sight she's
[50:51] under the blood cuz he paid the price
[50:54] and so we see through the new Testament
[50:55] the New Covenant that the person of
[50:58] Christ paid the price and the person of
[51:00] Christ is the key to the kingdom that's
[51:03] that's the way to get into it and
[51:04] Brother David talked about this a little
[51:06] bit and and of course Jesus said to it
[51:08] he said the kingdom of God doesn't come
[51:10] with observation but the kingdom of God
[51:12] is within you it's within you and it's
[51:15] not something but it's someone and it's
[51:17] the person of Christ and it's the Holy
[51:19] Ghost and so when Jesus Christ paid the
[51:21] price on the on the cross paid the price
[51:24] on the cross what did he do he released
[51:26] his spirit and his Spirit was now
[51:28] available to come back on the bride and
[51:31] that is the thing that brings us into
[51:33] fullness with Christ it's the true form
[51:35] of Christianity it's eternal life it's
[51:37] resurrection power I it's Holiness it's
[51:40] love it's Joy it's all of these things
[51:42] personified in The Believer because it's
[51:44] the very nature it's the very Life of
[51:46] Christ coming back on us but that a
[51:49] eight thing that that that that Peter
[51:51] talks about that Capstone is charity and
[51:53] we see by the word of God that Char it
[51:55] is none other than God himself it's not
[51:58] an attribute but it's a person 1 John 4
[52:01] says beloved let us love one another for
[52:04] love is of God and everyone that loveth
[52:07] is born of God and knoweth God you've
[52:10] got to be born of God to have the love
[52:12] of God and you've got to know God to
[52:14] have the love of God and then and then
[52:17] John leaves no no question about what
[52:18] he's saying he says he that loveth not
[52:21] knoweth not God so if you don't love the
[52:23] with this agape love and this is the
[52:25] exact same word Agape he says you you
[52:27] can't Agape he says unless you know God
[52:30] so who who he that loveth not knows not
[52:33] God for God is love that word love is
[52:36] the same as Charity and it's agape and
[52:39] it's the attribute of God it's the very
[52:41] nature of God and you can't have love if
[52:43] you don't know God and Brother David
[52:45] talked about this a little bit it was
[52:47] already in my notes I'd already started
[52:49] studying last week but he he he he
[52:51] talked about knowing and he talked about
[52:53] Mary and John ties the idea of loving
[52:56] with this idea of knowing and this isn't
[52:58] knowing the way we would think of
[53:00] knowing we think 1+ 1 equal 2 is knowing
[53:03] or you know the square root of nine is
[53:05] three is knowing no no no that's not
[53:07] knowing and then you say well Malachi 4
[53:09] has been has come in our day no that's
[53:11] not the knowing he's talking about
[53:12] knowing what's under the seals is not
[53:14] the knowing he's talking about but this
[53:16] knowing is a different word and this
[53:18] word is also only used in the New
[53:21] Testament because this kind of knowing
[53:23] can only happen through the Holy Ghost
[53:25] and this word is is josco and it means
[53:28] to personally know by divine revelation
[53:31] in other words you know first hand
[53:33] somebody didn't tell you it you didn't
[53:36] hear a video or you didn't listen to a
[53:38] tape if I could put it that way but it's
[53:40] a personal revelation from Christ amen
[53:43] you you were a part of what happened
[53:46] that's the knowing he's talking about
[53:47] it's a personal experience and then it
[53:50] says it's so to know personally by
[53:52] divine revelation or it's to know by in
[53:55] intimate experience and that's speaking
[53:57] of the relationship the intimate
[53:58] relationship between a wife and a
[54:01] husband so there's two knowings it's a
[54:03] personal experience and it's an intimate
[54:06] experience so if we look in the
[54:08] scriptures we'll see where Jesus uses
[54:10] this word and the disciples came to him
[54:12] and they said why speakest thou to the
[54:14] people in Parables and he answered and
[54:16] said unto them because it is given to
[54:18] you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[54:20] of heaven but to them it is not given
[54:23] it's meant to you to have a person
[54:25] experience a personal divine revelation
[54:28] of what this is but it's not given to
[54:29] them and that's only for the children of
[54:32] God that's the only ones can know it
[54:35] because it's tied to love and only the
[54:37] True Believer can get love which is the
[54:39] Holy Ghost then he'd say in Matthew 7 he
[54:43] says not everyone that says unto me Lord
[54:45] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[54:46] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[54:48] Father which is in heaven many will say
[54:51] to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[54:53] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[54:55] name have cast out devils and in thy
[54:56] name done many wonderful works there's
[54:59] lots of claims to him being their Lord
[55:01] but he says in verse 23 then will I
[55:03] profess unto them I never knew you in
[55:06] other words I never gave you a personal
[55:09] divine revelation I never had an
[55:11] intimate experience with you you knew
[55:14] about me you knew me but I didn't know
[55:17] you there was no
[55:19] relationship he says I never knew you
[55:22] depart from me you that work iniquity
[55:24] there works Pro that they didn't have an
[55:26] intimate relationship because their
[55:27] Works were not what he wanted
[55:29] done my wife knows what I want done and
[55:32] she only knows that because we're in
[55:34] relationship nobody else could walk up
[55:37] and say well I'm doing this in brother
[55:38] John's name no only my wife knows that
[55:41] because she's the only one I share those
[55:43] things with so you can come up and say I
[55:45] did all these things in Jonathan
[55:46] carlette's name but if I haven't told
[55:48] you what I want then you're not going to
[55:49] get it right that's what he says you did
[55:51] lots of things and maybe there were even
[55:53] wonderful things in your eyes but it
[55:54] wasn't n what I wanted and it's because
[55:56] you didn't know me you didn't have an
[55:58] intimate relationship then we come to
[56:00] that verse and Brother David read this
[56:02] this weekend where the Angel's talking
[56:04] to Mary and then Mary said to the angel
[56:06] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[56:09] man so Mary's saying I haven't I'm not
[56:11] married I'm I I I'm just engaged I
[56:14] haven't had an intimate relationship
[56:15] with Joseph yet I I'm a virgin I haven't
[56:18] been touched and she's saying how can I
[56:20] have a baby because I've never had
[56:22] intimate relationships with a man and
[56:25] it's the same knowing that that Christ
[56:27] is talking about in this word so we're
[56:29] looking at charity and John says charity
[56:31] comes from personal experience and by
[56:34] intimacy you can't have Divine love you
[56:36] can't be divine love you can't be a
[56:38] dwelling place for it until you've had a
[56:40] personal intimate relationship with
[56:43] God not just that yes I believe or yes I
[56:47] associate with or yes I come to church
[56:49] but a personal relationship with Christ
[56:52] is the only way that gets you to this
[56:53] and let me say it this way you don't
[56:55] even know what true love is until you
[56:57] get the Holy Ghost you don't know you
[57:00] don't know and if you don't you want
[57:01] proof of it look around this world
[57:04] because they take love and they apply it
[57:06] in the way that they think is best and
[57:07] we have record divorce rates we have
[57:09] broken homes we have sensuality and we
[57:11] have perversion beyond what it's been
[57:13] since the days of Sodom and Gomorrah
[57:15] that's what happens because when you
[57:16] turn down true love you turn to the
[57:18] Beast nature and the Beast nature is
[57:20] always self-gratifying always you'll end
[57:23] up doing what's best for you in the end
[57:25] and it'll take you down a path of
[57:27] Destruction but John would say clearly
[57:29] and he's using the same word Agape that
[57:31] Peter used that word charity and John
[57:34] says we've got to divinely love one
[57:37] another that means that if you have the
[57:39] Holy Ghost and I don't I can't love you
[57:42] the way you love me and we can't have
[57:45] love for one for one for another the
[57:47] right way until we both have the Holy
[57:49] Ghost because it'll bring a commonality
[57:51] it'll bring a Unity it'll bring an
[57:53] understanding to what's going on even
[57:55] when it doesn't feel like love because
[57:57] we're playing from the Same Love Book
[58:00] we're reading from the Same Love Letter
[58:01] and so we can take it back to there and
[58:03] by the Holy Ghost we can submit
[58:05] ourselves to this and in that we can
[58:06] submit ourselves one to another in love
[58:09] and we can do what's right for one
[58:10] another by this and that's the love as
[58:12] well amen but John's saying you got to
[58:14] divinely love one another a and that
[58:17] Divine love is only by the holy spirit
[58:19] because that's the only thing that
[58:20] Divine love is is the very nature of God
[58:23] himself amen they're one and the same
[58:24] you can't have Divine love in God it is
[58:26] one and the same it's it's it's a it's a
[58:28] package that comes
[58:30] together look at what Paul would say in
[58:32] Romans 8 he would say who then shall
[58:35] separate us from the love of Christ
[58:37] shall tribulation or distress or
[58:39] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[58:41] Peril or sword he says as it is written
[58:43] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[58:45] long we are accounted as sheep for the
[58:47] slaughter but then he says nay in all
[58:50] these things we are more than conquerors
[58:53] through him that loved us
[58:55] so here's the thing but when we were
[58:57] unlovable Christ loved us and so nothing
[59:01] we go through before we get the Holy
[59:03] Ghost or after we get the Holy Ghost can
[59:06] separate us from the love of Christ
[59:07] because he says you're engraved in the
[59:09] palms of my head I won't lose one that
[59:11] the father gave to me he's saying
[59:13] nothing that's happened nothing that's
[59:15] happening and nothing that will happen
[59:17] can separate you from the love of God
[59:19] and so you can look at it especially
[59:20] when you've got the Holy Ghost and say
[59:22] through all of this we're conquerors
[59:24] listen if I die in this Pulpit tonight I
[59:27] win I go directly into a place of peace
[59:30] and rest I go directly to a place that
[59:33] I've been longing for all of my life but
[59:36] if I stay here and I go through these
[59:37] things yet I'm a conqueror as well
[59:39] because he'll never leave me he'll never
[59:41] forsake me he'll take me through to the
[59:43] End of the Age amen and Paul says for I
[59:46] am persuaded see he he lists it out and
[59:49] then he says I'm persuaded of the very
[59:51] thing I'm talking about why because he's
[59:53] been there he's done that he's been
[59:56] through hard times Paul's been stoned
[59:58] and left for dead Paul's been uh turned
[1:00:01] on he's been called out he's been
[1:00:03] whipped he's been thrown into jail he's
[1:00:05] been beaten he's been bitten he's been
[1:00:09] Shipwrecked all these things and he says
[1:00:11] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[1:00:13] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:00:16] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:00:18] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:00:20] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:00:23] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:00:25] Jesus our lord Paul's saying when you
[1:00:27] get this love when you recognize you're
[1:00:29] a part of it when you recognize that
[1:00:31] it's given to you the love that God has
[1:00:33] for you then he says you'll realize that
[1:00:35] there is nothing can beat you this this
[1:00:38] is the the the the the the unbeatable
[1:00:41] combination of what it means to be a
[1:00:43] child of God is that nothing can
[1:00:46] separate you from him he's got you he's
[1:00:49] got a hedge about you he's got a plan
[1:00:51] for you he's got a purpose and Satan
[1:00:54] can't stop it you can't stop it I can't
[1:00:57] stop it God's going to take us all the
[1:00:58] way through amen amen if we could I
[1:01:02] think sometimes we need to read that
[1:01:03] every day and just say nothing's going
[1:01:05] to stop the plan of God in my life I
[1:01:08] mean nothing's going to hold me back
[1:01:09] from fulfilling his word in this age
[1:01:12] maybe today I lose more than I win but
[1:01:14] I'm going to win in the end no matter
[1:01:15] what cuz there's going to be days where
[1:01:17] it feels like all we do is
[1:01:19] lose maybe we have a couple wins and
[1:01:21] then we just drop the ball on something
[1:01:23] and it feels like we've lost the
[1:01:25] day that has nothing to do with it wins
[1:01:29] and losses we've already run the books
[1:01:32] the book has been written we've read the
[1:01:33] back of the book He's already won the
[1:01:36] price is paid we're sinless we're
[1:01:38] spotless we're guaranteed to make it
[1:01:40] across the Finish Line amen nothing can
[1:01:42] separate us from the love of God why
[1:01:45] because when God comes to dwell in the
[1:01:47] house he never
[1:01:48] leaves God makes perfect choices and
[1:01:52] when he comes into a house it's because
[1:01:53] he knows that that house will stand that
[1:01:56] it's built on a firm foundation that
[1:01:58] it's built of the right stuff remember
[1:02:00] brother BR was saying God makes things
[1:02:01] out of real material it's built out of
[1:02:03] real material and God knows that it will
[1:02:06] not fall amen once he comes in and
[1:02:09] dwells with us he's never going to just
[1:02:11] leave us he's not going to kick us to
[1:02:12] the curb because like I was saying
[1:02:14] earlier this charity is really a
[1:02:16] marriage proposal and it's an
[1:02:18] acceptance and it's God saying I'm ready
[1:02:20] to come into your life and you've got to
[1:02:22] be able to accept that you've got to be
[1:02:23] willing to do that and it's not just
[1:02:25] understanding and emotionalism and dos
[1:02:27] and don'ts and these things but it's now
[1:02:29] you're coming into the unity with the
[1:02:31] mind of Christ to understand what he's
[1:02:33] doing and wanting to do inside of your
[1:02:34] life God doesn't put us through all this
[1:02:36] work and this effort and character
[1:02:38] building and testing and trying just to
[1:02:40] sit us or kick us out to the curb at the
[1:02:41] end it's not a game for God but it's got
[1:02:44] a real purpose behind these things amen
[1:02:46] he doesn't play with our feelings he
[1:02:47] doesn't play with our time he doesn't
[1:02:49] play with our marriages and these
[1:02:50] different things but he's doing it with
[1:02:52] purpose and that purpose is love which
[1:02:54] which means it's for our good every
[1:02:56] single
[1:02:57] time Jesus would say this remember they
[1:03:00] asked Jesus about
[1:03:01] divorce and the reasons for it he said
[1:03:04] in Mark 10 he says but from the
[1:03:05] beginning of the creation God made the
[1:03:08] male and female for this cause shall a
[1:03:10] man leave his father and mother and
[1:03:12] cleave to his wife and they twain shall
[1:03:15] be one flesh so then they are no more
[1:03:18] Twain but they are one flesh he says
[1:03:20] they come in as two they go out as one
[1:03:23] and it's a supernatural blending it's a
[1:03:25] Heavenly blending because it's a
[1:03:26] reflection of Christ in the bride he
[1:03:28] says now what therefore God had joined
[1:03:30] together let not man put a under this is
[1:03:33] why I said when God comes into the house
[1:03:35] he never
[1:03:36] leaves because the nature of God is to
[1:03:39] stay with his mate it's to stay with his
[1:03:41] bride and he said you were supposed to
[1:03:42] do it but out of the hardness of your
[1:03:44] heart Moses gave you a decree of
[1:03:46] divorcement but God's not going to
[1:03:47] divorce you God's not going to lay you
[1:03:49] aside God has picked you and he picks
[1:03:51] perfectly and he chooses you and then
[1:03:53] it's up to you you now to let him in or
[1:03:56] let him
[1:03:59] out what was he doing what was he doing
[1:04:02] through these seven attributes we've
[1:04:03] been talking about because remember God
[1:04:06] can a man can only divorce a woman if
[1:04:08] she commits adultery and what God does
[1:04:10] through that that that work of these
[1:04:11] seven attributes is he's proving you
[1:04:13] he's proving your character he's proving
[1:04:15] that when times get tough you won't run
[1:04:17] away when the money gets low that you
[1:04:19] won't go and fall back on your own self
[1:04:21] that when your health gets bad that
[1:04:22] you're not going to run away from him
[1:04:24] because he hasn't healed you or he
[1:04:25] hasn't done this or he hasn't done that
[1:04:26] he's proving you through all these
[1:04:28] things because when he gets married he
[1:04:30] wants to know what he's getting married
[1:04:32] to and this is a process he used to show
[1:04:34] what this is amen it's not about our
[1:04:37] feelings though feelings are a part of
[1:04:39] it it's not about what we say and what
[1:04:41] we do but he's looking into the very
[1:04:43] inside of our hearts amen and seeing
[1:04:45] what we'll do when the screws are
[1:04:47] applied when the pressure comes down
[1:04:48] when times get tough and when we go
[1:04:50] through those things then he's just
[1:04:51] checking off a list yep just like just
[1:04:55] like me just like me just like me wow
[1:04:58] they keep using the word they keep
[1:04:59] filtering the word look no matter what
[1:05:01] happens doesn't matter what people say
[1:05:03] they act the same doesn't matter what
[1:05:04] people do they keep doing what I tell
[1:05:06] them to do they don't go to the left
[1:05:07] they don't go to the right they're
[1:05:09] stable they're steady and what's he
[1:05:10] doing he's showing what's inside of you
[1:05:12] because it's a house that he's building
[1:05:14] and it's a house that he's certifying
[1:05:16] and it's a house that he's ordained for
[1:05:17] his Dwelling Place brother B would say
[1:05:20] this he says now you can't think with
[1:05:21] your body you think with your mind and
[1:05:24] in there is where too many of Christians
[1:05:26] stop and they can just like the corn in
[1:05:29] the field and the weed in the field be
[1:05:31] Anointed with the same holy spirit that
[1:05:33] the real Believers Anointed with if you
[1:05:36] want to get into that more go listen to
[1:05:38] anoint false anointed ones at the end
[1:05:40] time brother B would talk about someone
[1:05:42] like balum who was a prophet a genuine
[1:05:45] Prophet but he was yet an unbeliever he
[1:05:48] had a gift he had a calling he was
[1:05:51] anointed and yet he was not a True
[1:05:53] Believer because when push came to shove
[1:05:55] he went for money and he went for
[1:05:57] influence rather than to do the will of
[1:05:59] God but he was anointed he was
[1:06:02] absolutely 100% anointed but the vessel
[1:06:06] was still dirty he says but down on the
[1:06:08] inside of that next realm the Third
[1:06:10] Realm is the soul and that's
[1:06:12] predestinated by God there is where the
[1:06:15] real sea germ lay lays is in there he
[1:06:18] says today so many are confused about
[1:06:21] the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so
[1:06:22] forth Satan can impersonate any gift
[1:06:25] that God has got but he cannot bring
[1:06:28] that word word by word remember that
[1:06:31] Paul would say he said here a little
[1:06:32] there where word upon word line upon
[1:06:35] line Satan cannot build you up because
[1:06:37] he's a liar he's a thief he's a
[1:06:39] Tormentor and he's a destroyer Satan
[1:06:42] can't build you up he says he can
[1:06:43] impersonate any gift but he can't build
[1:06:46] you into the statue of a perfect son or
[1:06:48] daughter of God he can't do it because
[1:06:50] it's not in his nature to do it he only
[1:06:52] knows how to mimic and destroy but he
[1:06:54] cannot build up and he cannot redeem and
[1:06:56] he cannot give life so he says he can do
[1:06:58] any gift but he can't make you a real
[1:07:01] believer he can't change you from what
[1:07:04] you were into what you ought to be all
[1:07:06] he can do is work in your base nature he
[1:07:09] says that's where he failed in the
[1:07:10] Garden of Eden that's where he's always
[1:07:12] failed he says that's where the tape on
[1:07:14] false anointed ones or anointed ones is
[1:07:16] they can be Anointed with the spirit the
[1:07:19] Holy Spirit the literal real Holy Spirit
[1:07:22] anointed not not filled with but
[1:07:24] anointed it can be on them but not in
[1:07:26] them he says they can speak in tongues
[1:07:29] they can dance shout preach the gospel
[1:07:31] and they're still a devil
[1:07:34] that how do you even try and teach that
[1:07:37] to
[1:07:38] somebody that you can literally be
[1:07:40] anointed and be a devil you can be
[1:07:42] Anointed with the Holy Spirit and be a
[1:07:47] devil and yet we can see it in scripture
[1:07:50] we see it with balum we see it with
[1:07:53] Judas Judas was anointed the same as the
[1:07:56] other disciples did signs and wonders
[1:07:59] and yet he himself was a devil inside he
[1:08:02] was not a real
[1:08:03] believer he says it's the
[1:08:06] inside that's what we're talking about
[1:08:08] he says now remember Jesus said all the
[1:08:10] father has given me will come all
[1:08:15] will if your name was there in the
[1:08:17] beginning you're gonna make it and it's
[1:08:19] a finished work he says no man can come
[1:08:22] except my father draws him first
[1:08:23] remember Jesus said where I am you may
[1:08:25] be also this is an eternal work this is
[1:08:27] a finished work now remember the man
[1:08:29] chooses the woman accepts and so the
[1:08:32] choosing of God this is the beauty of of
[1:08:34] being in relationship with Christ is
[1:08:36] that we're Christ's choice and he makes
[1:08:38] a perfect choice the perfect one makes a
[1:08:41] perfect choice and like I've said before
[1:08:43] the question is are you going to come
[1:08:44] easy or you going to come the hard way
[1:08:46] cuz he's going to get you one way or the
[1:08:47] other because he's pulling on that word
[1:08:49] seed remember brother bam says it's that
[1:08:51] real seed Gene it's the inside of you
[1:08:53] that he's coming for he's not coming for
[1:08:55] Jonathan klette or or Amber coffee or
[1:08:58] Joshua Columbo or Betty Lush he's coming
[1:09:00] for the word inside of me my name has
[1:09:02] nothing to do with it I get a new name
[1:09:04] over there That's how little this flesh
[1:09:06] matters That's how little this this name
[1:09:08] that I have matters but he's coming for
[1:09:09] the word inside of me and that's my
[1:09:12] great rest is that he put it in there so
[1:09:14] he could come back for it he redeems
[1:09:16] what was already his he does not come
[1:09:18] for something that didn't belong for him
[1:09:20] that's the rest of the believer he chose
[1:09:22] me I didn't choose him because he came
[1:09:25] looking for me before I ever came
[1:09:26] looking for
[1:09:27] him anden he's the one that put the
[1:09:29] characteristics inside of us and he's
[1:09:31] the one that by the working of the holy
[1:09:33] spirit is drawing them out it's the seed
[1:09:35] word of God inside of us that responds
[1:09:36] to the word it's the Deep calling to the
[1:09:39] Deep it's the Deep responding to the
[1:09:41] Deep brother BR would say put it this
[1:09:44] way he says and when you have faith
[1:09:45] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[1:09:48] godliness and brotherly love he says
[1:09:50] then the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:09:53] seals you you as a unit the same as he
[1:09:56] seals the church ages as a unit the way
[1:09:58] he makes his bride is the way he makes
[1:10:00] his individual made out of the same
[1:10:02] material like Eve was made out of Adam a
[1:10:05] rib from the side he says here's the
[1:10:07] things that you have to have first you
[1:10:08] have to have those first seven
[1:10:10] attributes he says and you can't
[1:10:11] impersonate them you can't imitate them
[1:10:15] he's not saying it's not possible to
[1:10:16] imitate them he's saying you can't do it
[1:10:19] it won't work if you do he says they've
[1:10:21] got to be godsent and God born he says
[1:10:25] imitation only causes confusion remember
[1:10:27] the scripture says God is not the author
[1:10:29] of confusion amen it'll work the same
[1:10:32] for each and every one of us and it's
[1:10:33] it's if it's of God it's from God and
[1:10:36] that's the only way that it works for us
[1:10:38] the Eternal comes to the Eternal the
[1:10:40] word comes to the word you maybe I hope
[1:10:43] this doesn't sound too crude but for
[1:10:46] church especially but you know when
[1:10:48] you're walking around and this goes for
[1:10:49] brothers and sisters alike you know
[1:10:51] you're young people and and you're
[1:10:52] looking and you're you know wanting to
[1:10:54] get married and that and and we can see
[1:10:56] everything on the outside we can see the
[1:10:58] way you dress we can see the way you you
[1:11:00] do your hair we can see whether we can
[1:11:02] smell whether you smell nice whether you
[1:11:04] smell bad we can see how good or bad
[1:11:06] your skin is in these things but here's
[1:11:08] the thing this suit covers up a lot of
[1:11:10] flaws this suit covers up a lot of flaws
[1:11:13] and so if my wife hadn't married me yet
[1:11:16] she all she'd see was what I put on
[1:11:18] she'd see the outside but if we spend
[1:11:21] enough time in the courtship together
[1:11:23] then she she's going to see me in times
[1:11:24] where my hair isn't everyone in the
[1:11:26] perfect place she's going to see me when
[1:11:28] I'm tired she's going to see me when I'm
[1:11:30] worn out she's going to see me when I'm
[1:11:31] frustrated she's going to have an idea
[1:11:33] of what the real Jonathan klet is like
[1:11:35] isn't she but let me tell you when we
[1:11:38] get married she's going to see me in a
[1:11:41] way she's never seen me before and she's
[1:11:43] going to know if I've been eating Donuts
[1:11:45] she's going to know if I've been sucking
[1:11:46] in and hiding my stomach this time she's
[1:11:48] going to know if I've got to hairry back
[1:11:50] because now everything's being revealed
[1:11:53] and what Christ is doing through all of
[1:11:55] this process here is he's revealing what
[1:11:57] matters to him and it's what's on the
[1:12:00] inside but because remember he's not
[1:12:03] going to be surprised when he comes to
[1:12:04] the marriage to find what's waiting for
[1:12:06] him but you know what if if if you pred
[1:12:09] and you proded and youve you know they
[1:12:10] got clothes to make you do everything
[1:12:12] these days for men and women
[1:12:14] alike right you can make yourself look
[1:12:17] skinny with clothes and I know we don't
[1:12:19] wear makeup here necessarily but guess
[1:12:21] what you wake up next to a woman that
[1:12:23] always wears makeup and then you see
[1:12:24] what she looks like without makeup it's
[1:12:26] scary sometimes the Stark difference
[1:12:28] between those two and if you're always
[1:12:31] perfect on the outside when the marriage
[1:12:34] Night comes and the next morning comes
[1:12:36] guess what somebody's going to be in for
[1:12:37] a surprise if you've hidden your real
[1:12:39] self that whole time there's going to be
[1:12:41] a revealing that happens whether you
[1:12:43] like it or not now here's the thing if I
[1:12:45] I if you you you've been wearing clothes
[1:12:47] that make you look like you're 130 lbs
[1:12:49] and when you take them off it's obvious
[1:12:51] that you're 160 that's going to be a
[1:12:54] little bit startling going into your
[1:12:55] into your wedding night because your
[1:12:58] husband thinks you're 130 and you know
[1:12:59] you're 160 and you know he's going to
[1:13:00] find out
[1:13:02] tonight but what is it that keeps you
[1:13:04] from running away what is it that makes
[1:13:06] you still go through with it hopefully
[1:13:08] it's because you know he loves you for
[1:13:10] who you are regardless of what he finds
[1:13:14] regardless of of how you look regardless
[1:13:17] of these things what matters is is the
[1:13:19] thing that's on the inside of you he's
[1:13:20] loving you for the whole package your
[1:13:22] entire being not just whether you're
[1:13:24] perfect physically not just whether your
[1:13:26] skin is beautiful everywhere whether you
[1:13:28] wear hair extensions or not or whether
[1:13:30] you have bad breath or not that's not
[1:13:33] what he's marrying you for but he's
[1:13:34] marrying you for the core part of you
[1:13:36] and that's what he should have fallen in
[1:13:38] love with because if he marries you for
[1:13:40] your looks and your looks are false then
[1:13:42] there's going to be a there's going to
[1:13:43] be something that
[1:13:44] happens and he might he might hide his
[1:13:47] disappointment for a while but
[1:13:48] eventually that marriage will fall apart
[1:13:50] because you weren't what he thought he
[1:13:51] was marrying cuz it was was based on the
[1:13:53] external and what you presented to him
[1:13:55] was
[1:13:56] false same for guys listen I talked to
[1:14:00] ministers all over the the globe and you
[1:14:02] know they say these women come to us for
[1:14:05] and and couples come with marital
[1:14:07] counseling and they find out that their
[1:14:08] husband just wants to play games all the
[1:14:10] time and they had no idea until they
[1:14:12] married that he would play computer
[1:14:14] games or whatever for four hours a day
[1:14:17] and and that he kept that hidden or that
[1:14:19] he watches movies day in and day out or
[1:14:21] that he listens to music country music
[1:14:23] mus or maybe something else and she had
[1:14:25] no idea and then all of a sudden they're
[1:14:26] married and all of this comes out why
[1:14:29] cuz he was hiding who he was rather than
[1:14:33] revealing who he was but not that's not
[1:14:36] the way go God works God knows what's on
[1:14:38] the inside of us and he's proving it and
[1:14:40] he's testing and trying it so that when
[1:14:42] he comes to the house he knows what's
[1:14:43] there and it's been proven and it's been
[1:14:45] tested amen amen he chose us perfectly I
[1:14:49] love when it comes to David you know God
[1:14:51] never said David was perfect but David
[1:14:54] he said David's heart was perfect he
[1:14:56] said David's heart is like mine he
[1:14:57] didn't say David's like me he says he
[1:14:59] has a heart like
[1:15:00] mine it's on the inside that David is
[1:15:03] like God David made plenty of mistakes
[1:15:06] David had hot-headed moments David fell
[1:15:08] into sensuality David fell into
[1:15:11] temptation David fell into to thinking
[1:15:14] too much of himself but at the heart it
[1:15:17] was just like God and that's why God
[1:15:19] chose him to be king brother B puts it
[1:15:22] this way he says there's no Shadow at
[1:15:24] the
[1:15:25] Judgment for us to have a way of Escape
[1:15:27] at all because God in every way has
[1:15:30] combed everything to make us believe
[1:15:33] he's saying if you come to the Judgment
[1:15:35] There's No Escape saying I didn't know
[1:15:37] this or I didn't know that or I was no
[1:15:40] no there's no room for ignorance anymore
[1:15:42] he said God's taken everything away and
[1:15:45] he's given us every opportunity for us
[1:15:46] to believe but he says the first thing
[1:15:49] is his word he says seeming to me if
[1:15:51] someone wouldn't believe my word well I
[1:15:53] would wouldn't have much confidence in
[1:15:54] the person but God is different though
[1:15:56] you do not believe his word he's yet
[1:15:58] willing to come to you in some other way
[1:16:00] to manifest his love to you that's what
[1:16:03] I said when we are unlovable yet Christ
[1:16:05] loved us while we were yet sinners he
[1:16:07] died for us Paul said and he's saying
[1:16:10] God isn't like us where if somebody
[1:16:12] turns us down or somebody spurns us or
[1:16:14] somebody offends us we turn away he says
[1:16:16] no God comes around and if you won't
[1:16:18] take his word then he'll reveal himself
[1:16:19] even another way he'll do it in the
[1:16:22] heavens he'll do it the signs of the
[1:16:23] times he'll do it in a person it's the
[1:16:26] word but it's not maybe the Bible in the
[1:16:28] way that most people would expect he
[1:16:30] says isn't that wonderful how unworthy
[1:16:32] we creatures are of such love and now he
[1:16:34] brings it to us and he says brother
[1:16:36] sister that's what the world needs today
[1:16:38] is some more love of God not some more
[1:16:41] love some more love of God he says
[1:16:45] that's what the world's hungry for today
[1:16:46] is more love of God if we'd show a
[1:16:48] little more love to one another a little
[1:16:50] more love towards God how much better
[1:16:53] are our churches and individuals and how
[1:16:55] much better we'd be if we just love one
[1:16:57] another now catch this he says if we
[1:17:00] love one
[1:17:01] another then we can love God for God is
[1:17:05] love remember what John said by this
[1:17:07] shall all men know or Jesus said by this
[1:17:08] shall all men know that you're my
[1:17:10] disciples if you have love one for
[1:17:13] another you say I love God and you can't
[1:17:15] get together with the Believers you
[1:17:16] can't get along with Believers
[1:17:18] something's wrong something is wrong
[1:17:22] Church you know I've heard this said
[1:17:24] before I don't know if brother Braham
[1:17:26] said
[1:17:26] it i' I've been told he said it I
[1:17:29] haven't been able to find it he says I
[1:17:32] don't like that brother but I love that
[1:17:34] brother sometimes we have personality
[1:17:36] conflicts you know sometimes we just Rob
[1:17:39] each other the wrong way but we still
[1:17:41] ought to be able to see in the heart of
[1:17:42] that person that there is a Unity under
[1:17:45] the word amen that their intent is the
[1:17:48] same as ours their purpose is the same
[1:17:50] of our as ours they may go about it a
[1:17:52] different way way listen you compare the
[1:17:54] way Peter was to John they were two
[1:17:56] different people remember John was the
[1:17:58] one that laid on jesus' chest he was
[1:18:00] lydy he was he he was I would say he was
[1:18:03] he was maybe more emotional maybe more
[1:18:04] cuddly you know more touchy feely Peter
[1:18:08] was coarse and rough but Peter was Brash
[1:18:11] as well but Peter had
[1:18:12] courage two different approaches
[1:18:15] sometimes I wonder if maybe Peter and
[1:18:17] John didn't maybe not get along so great
[1:18:18] at all times cuz Peter was maybe a bit
[1:18:20] of a louder mouth and John was a bit of
[1:18:22] a quieter person personality but yet
[1:18:24] somehow they're both together at the
[1:18:25] gate beautiful they learn to walk
[1:18:27] together amen remember Paul Paul and
[1:18:31] Paul and Silas I think it was John Mark
[1:18:34] that they wanted to send along with them
[1:18:35] and Paul says no I can't travel with
[1:18:37] him Paul said that and so Paul ended up
[1:18:41] taking Silas rather than going with his
[1:18:42] other brother because he didn't work
[1:18:44] well with Paul he never said that
[1:18:46] brother doesn't have the Holy Ghost he
[1:18:48] didn't say he's not a Believer he just
[1:18:49] said I can't work with him he does
[1:18:51] things different than I do so we're
[1:18:52] going to go this way and we're going to
[1:18:54] do what the Holy Ghost tells us to do
[1:18:56] and he's going to go another way and the
[1:18:57] Holy Ghost is going to tell him what to
[1:18:59] do it's amazing today where we can have
[1:19:02] Ministries and we can have personalities
[1:19:04] and if you don't do it the way they want
[1:19:05] to do suddenly we don't you don't have
[1:19:07] the Holy Ghost no you do what he leads
[1:19:09] you to do and I'll do what I'll lead me
[1:19:11] he leads me to do and that's okay we
[1:19:13] don't have to be all cut from that same
[1:19:15] cloth we don't have to have the same
[1:19:16] approach in these things he says if we
[1:19:19] love one another then we can love God
[1:19:21] for God is love
[1:19:23] so the expectation is by the time you
[1:19:25] come to this place and really we're
[1:19:26] talking about marriage you move past
[1:19:28] performance and you're into relationship
[1:19:31] you move past legalism you move past
[1:19:33] Doctrine we're moving into Perfection
[1:19:34] now like Paul said and these things
[1:19:36] matter our words matter our actions
[1:19:38] matter they Define us but we're moving
[1:19:40] out past relation past performance and
[1:19:43] into relationship because we're coming
[1:19:45] into
[1:19:46] Unity my wife and I do things together
[1:19:48] for the sake of unity not because we
[1:19:50] always understand but we trust and she
[1:19:54] has to trust me and I've got to trust
[1:19:55] her and the things that I've committed
[1:19:57] to her I may not always agree but if
[1:19:59] she's done the work and I've committed
[1:20:01] it to her hands I'll let her go ahead
[1:20:03] with it and she's got to do the same
[1:20:05] thing for me because we're in it
[1:20:07] together because the two have become one
[1:20:09] and in unity now we start to work
[1:20:11] together in a way we didn't before and
[1:20:13] that's the basis that this is talking
[1:20:14] about we moved past doctrines and the
[1:20:16] dos and don'ts and we're at a place of
[1:20:18] peace and rest and Trust where we can do
[1:20:21] exactly what he wants us to do and we
[1:20:23] don't
[1:20:24] question you know brother BR we talked
[1:20:26] about brotherly kindness and that was
[1:20:28] really the peak of what you can do
[1:20:30] without the Holy Ghost and yet you if
[1:20:32] you don't trust him by the time you're
[1:20:33] getting to that you're not going to get
[1:20:35] very far because brotherly kindness
[1:20:37] requires you to do things to and with
[1:20:39] people that you wouldn't do in your
[1:20:40] flesh it's the hardest thing to do is
[1:20:43] forgive somebody when they've done
[1:20:44] something bad to you to go and extend a
[1:20:46] hand of friendship to extend a hand of
[1:20:47] help when they've slapped it down or
[1:20:49] they' rejected you but that's what
[1:20:50] brotherly kindness is about is about the
[1:20:52] other person person you've got to have
[1:20:54] that but now we're coming into
[1:20:55] relationship where whatever he asks you
[1:20:58] to do even if it's laying down your life
[1:21:00] even if it's laying down your job even
[1:21:02] if it's laying down this that and the
[1:21:03] other thing you'll be willing to do it
[1:21:05] because you trust him all through this
[1:21:07] he's you've been proving his word and
[1:21:09] he's been proving
[1:21:10] you he's been proving his word in your
[1:21:13] life and you've been showing him that
[1:21:14] you take it seriously and that you're
[1:21:15] willing to walk as he would amen and you
[1:21:17] know this why because you know that
[1:21:19] everything he does is for your good
[1:21:21] you're in love with him that's what
[1:21:22] brandom said at the beginning remember
[1:21:24] he says take what you would feel for
[1:21:25] your wife or your spouse and multiply by
[1:21:28] 100 million times he says and when you
[1:21:30] get in love with Christ you just want to
[1:21:32] be more and more in him with him amen
[1:21:35] it's a it's a union that's going on but
[1:21:38] if you think if you can Satan can ever
[1:21:40] get you to think that God's holding back
[1:21:42] on you he's got you licked because
[1:21:44] that's what he did with Eve remember in
[1:21:45] the garden he tried to make her he he
[1:21:48] successfully made her think that God was
[1:21:50] holding back on her he said God God
[1:21:52] doesn't want you to be like he is God's
[1:21:55] holding back God's up here and you're
[1:21:58] right here and he's trying to make you
[1:22:00] think you're up here he says but if
[1:22:02] you'll do what I tell you you'll be just
[1:22:03] like God and that's how he got Eve away
[1:22:05] was he made her think that where she was
[1:22:07] at wasn't good enough but she was
[1:22:09] exactly in a place of perfect peace and
[1:22:11] rest and as soon as he did she did what
[1:22:13] he said she lost it all fear came in and
[1:22:16] she didn't even want to be around Christ
[1:22:18] What a Sad Place why trying to get her
[1:22:21] to think that God's hoing back on
[1:22:23] us hey sometimes it feels like he's
[1:22:26] holding back we don't always get the
[1:22:28] answer to our prayer when we want it and
[1:22:30] we don't always get the answer we wanted
[1:22:32] in the first place do we and it's
[1:22:34] sometimes hard to think well God's
[1:22:36] holding back on us why do I have to go
[1:22:38] through this we can look around and one
[1:22:39] person gets healed immediately and
[1:22:41] somebody else is going for years and
[1:22:42] they don't get their total healing God
[1:22:44] why you holding back on me and we can
[1:22:46] get frustrated in our minds and we can
[1:22:48] get worn down and what is it Satan can
[1:22:50] commit an attack and say see he doesn't
[1:22:52] love you like he loves
[1:22:54] them and he starts playing mind
[1:22:57] games but there's got to be something in
[1:22:59] the soul that holds us amen and it's
[1:23:01] that deep calling to the Deep amen like
[1:23:03] I said before this is not a an attribute
[1:23:06] now it's a person and it's not something
[1:23:07] we flip the switch on and off but it's
[1:23:09] something that's continuously going
[1:23:11] through our lives brother Bram I was
[1:23:12] reading this quote the other day and he
[1:23:14] says he says people are looking for
[1:23:15] shine now you know they want Sparkle and
[1:23:18] they want everything to be shiny he says
[1:23:20] but he says the gospel glows with
[1:23:22] humility
[1:23:24] it's just constant a glow never goes
[1:23:27] away something that's bright you know
[1:23:29] what happens it burns out quickly you
[1:23:32] got a light bulb that's really bright it
[1:23:33] burns out quickly but you got something
[1:23:35] that's just got a you know just you know
[1:23:38] you take a 100 watt versus a 30 watt or
[1:23:40] a 40 watt you put that 40 watt on it's
[1:23:41] just a nice soft light and that'll go
[1:23:43] for a, hours you put that 100 watt on
[1:23:46] it'll burn out in 600 cuz it's just got
[1:23:49] too much going but that constant glow
[1:23:51] was what he was talking talking
[1:23:53] about but even as we're talking about
[1:23:55] this this ceiling and we're speaking on
[1:23:56] the Capstone tonight the the danger of
[1:23:59] this is that we think that this Capstone
[1:24:01] is the ceiling of this entire thing and
[1:24:04] it's not remember and we're going to
[1:24:06] we're going to be covering what the Holy
[1:24:08] Ghost is because brother Brown would say
[1:24:09] it's a comforter it's a it's a seal it's
[1:24:12] it's an approval it's all of these
[1:24:14] different things but he'd say it's a
[1:24:16] sealing of your
[1:24:18] soul because this is the Paradox of the
[1:24:20] Christian walk is that you can be sealed
[1:24:22] in the Soul by the Holy Spirit and still
[1:24:25] be fighting things all day long in your
[1:24:26] flesh and that's the the the the the
[1:24:29] difficult thing for us to grasp
[1:24:30] sometimes say how can I have the Holy
[1:24:32] Ghost and still be dealing with
[1:24:34] issues remember Paul said you know
[1:24:36] before he talked about there were there
[1:24:38] were fightings without and fears within
[1:24:41] there's always going to be things that
[1:24:42] we're we're we're going on and and
[1:24:44] things that are we're dealing with in
[1:24:45] our life but our flesh is not sealed our
[1:24:48] soul is sealed our flesh needs to be
[1:24:50] redeemed our soul doesn't get changed
[1:24:52] when we go into Rapture and Resurrection
[1:24:54] but our body does this body is the thing
[1:24:57] that needs redeeming that's why we need
[1:24:58] a glorified one and that's why we're
[1:25:00] fighting until the day of our Redemption
[1:25:02] is because this ain't Sanctified this
[1:25:05] ain't saved this ain't sealed this isn't
[1:25:07] cleaned out this is where the battle is
[1:25:09] day in and day out remember Paul would
[1:25:11] say grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:25:14] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[1:25:16] redemption so something gets sealed but
[1:25:18] there's got to be a redeeming yet the
[1:25:20] soul is eternal it does not die
[1:25:23] that's already been sealed but your body
[1:25:25] needs to be redeemed to bring you back
[1:25:27] to your original Place amen so we need a
[1:25:29] new body to be fully redeemed we need a
[1:25:32] new body to be the true manifested Sons
[1:25:34] and Daughters of God so Paul says this
[1:25:36] is only going to keep you till that time
[1:25:38] your soul is sealed if I die as soon as
[1:25:40] I get the Holy Ghost I go straight into
[1:25:42] the straight into Paradise I go straight
[1:25:45] to a better place because the soul is
[1:25:47] what's moving and the body has nothing
[1:25:49] to do with
[1:25:50] it amen Paul all saying what there's
[1:25:53] still a battle to be
[1:25:54] fought just because you're sealed
[1:25:56] doesn't mean you're perfect but what it
[1:25:59] does mean is that the intentions of your
[1:26:00] heart are right it means that on the
[1:26:02] inside of the inside you want what God
[1:26:04] wants you put his word in preeminence in
[1:26:06] your life and you'll filter your life
[1:26:08] and you'll live your life through the
[1:26:09] word but there's still a Redemption
[1:26:11] that's coming for this body and so in
[1:26:12] the meantime you're going to have a
[1:26:14] battle as long as you get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:16] remember brother Bram I read that quote
[1:26:17] where he said get the Holy Ghost once
[1:26:19] and you'll see that it's always a battle
[1:26:22] you fight from that day on that's the
[1:26:23] greatest battle because now there's a
[1:26:25] there's somebody at the controls at all
[1:26:27] times remember until your soul is sealed
[1:26:30] then Satan can come in there and God can
[1:26:32] come in
[1:26:33] there it's the control tower until you
[1:26:36] truly are receive a new birth then
[1:26:39] anybody can any Spirit can control you
[1:26:41] but as soon as your soul is sealed by
[1:26:43] the Holy Spirit nothing can get in there
[1:26:46] nothing can get in
[1:26:47] there but there's a battle now for the
[1:26:50] rest of you that isn't Sanctified that
[1:26:51] isn't sealed and that's the
[1:26:54] body Paul would say this he said but I
[1:26:57] keep under my
[1:26:58] body this is one of those ones that
[1:27:00] Brother David was talking you can flip
[1:27:01] the words and it means the correct thing
[1:27:03] really what he's saying I keep my body
[1:27:05] under and we'll explain what that means
[1:27:07] he says and I bring it unto subjection
[1:27:09] lest that by any means when I have
[1:27:11] preached to others I myself should be a
[1:27:13] Castaway in the Amplified says but like
[1:27:15] a wrestler I submit and hold down my
[1:27:18] body I handle it roughly I discipline it
[1:27:20] by hardships in other words I pin it I
[1:27:22] keep it on underneath me I make it
[1:27:25] immovable I take its power from it he
[1:27:28] says and I subdue it for fear that after
[1:27:30] proclaiming to others the gospel and
[1:27:32] things pertaining to it I myself should
[1:27:34] become unfit I would not stand the test
[1:27:37] I would be unapproved and rejected as a
[1:27:39] counterfeit now I know most of us don't
[1:27:41] don't watch wrestling I know some of our
[1:27:43] brothers have done this before but in
[1:27:45] wrestling the goal is to get on top of
[1:27:47] your opponent because the one on top is
[1:27:49] the one that generally controls the
[1:27:50] match and and back in those days that's
[1:27:53] what they did they did a lot of
[1:27:54] wrestling and so Paul says I take this
[1:27:56] flesh and I get it down on the ground
[1:27:58] and I subdue it I pin it I wrap my arms
[1:28:01] around it I pin its arms to its side I
[1:28:04] take away its power every single day
[1:28:06] Paul said I Die daily I'm working every
[1:28:09] day to kill this stinking flesh he says
[1:28:12] and I've got to do this every single day
[1:28:15] until the day of my
[1:28:16] Redemption so don't let Satan go in
[1:28:19] there and and somehow say no other
[1:28:22] believer or no believer would deal with
[1:28:24] what you're dealing with no believer
[1:28:25] would have this problem in their life
[1:28:27] listen the reason it's a problem for us
[1:28:29] is because there is someone on the
[1:28:31] inside that will refuse to allow it to
[1:28:33] have preeminence in our life the world
[1:28:35] doesn't have battles the way we have
[1:28:37] battles cuz they're okay with everything
[1:28:39] that their flesh is but we're not
[1:28:42] because we've got something we've got
[1:28:43] someone on the inside that says you
[1:28:45] can't do that with this Temple and so
[1:28:48] we've got a battle and so we battle
[1:28:50] where others do not because we've got
[1:28:52] something on the inside that's contrary
[1:28:53] to what's in our flesh and we've got
[1:28:56] things in our genetics we've got things
[1:28:57] in our emotions we've got things in in
[1:29:00] in our past and our memories and these
[1:29:01] different things and they can cause us
[1:29:03] issues but that doesn't mean we don't
[1:29:05] have the Holy Ghost what it means is
[1:29:07] that the Holy Ghost will stand up and
[1:29:08] fight in our life to bring us subject to
[1:29:10] the word and to bring those things
[1:29:12] subject to God Amen they he won't allow
[1:29:16] them to have preeminence he won't allow
[1:29:17] them to have power over us and so
[1:29:19] there's a battle every single day
[1:29:20] because the soul the nature of our of
[1:29:22] our heart is seeking after God and this
[1:29:25] flesh is seeking after
[1:29:27] itself simple fact is this sometimes the
[1:29:30] soul
[1:29:31] wins and sometimes the flesh
[1:29:34] wins listen I'm a minister I'm your
[1:29:37] pastor and sometimes my flesh
[1:29:40] wins there are days where it seems like
[1:29:43] the flesh won but I will say this the
[1:29:46] flesh wins less and less and it wins in
[1:29:49] areas it doesn't win in areas it used
[1:29:51] used to winning why cuz we're growing
[1:29:54] we're
[1:29:55] maturing I don't mind so much if I lose
[1:29:58] the battle once it's if I keep losing
[1:30:01] it if I keep losing it you know what
[1:30:03] that means there's a Tormentor in my
[1:30:06] life and I got to pray that thing out
[1:30:10] and I've got to get honest before God
[1:30:11] I've got to get humble before God and
[1:30:13] I've got to say God this is something
[1:30:15] that I can't defeat and then brother
[1:30:17] Bram says you go with prayer and you
[1:30:18] hold that token before you and you say
[1:30:20] you've got to leave and if you truly
[1:30:22] want it gone it'll go but he says as
[1:30:26] long as you want it it can stay because
[1:30:29] you're opening the door your mouth might
[1:30:31] say I don't want it but in here it's
[1:30:32] saying I want it and so you keep falling
[1:30:35] and you keep falling I've dealt with
[1:30:36] these things don't tell me I don't know
[1:30:37] what I'm talking about and here's the
[1:30:39] thing as I've learned what happens is I
[1:30:41] have discernment for my own
[1:30:43] weaknesses and so I can see where
[1:30:45] something can go and what do I do then I
[1:30:48] back away I put myself in a position
[1:30:51] where that thing can't do what it wants
[1:30:52] to
[1:30:54] do right we don't have a conversation we
[1:30:57] flee we flee we use our feet for
[1:31:00] discernment remember Jesus the scripture
[1:31:03] says you know if your eye affect you
[1:31:05] pluck it out if something's causing you
[1:31:08] problems get rid of it don't leave it in
[1:31:10] your house don't leave it on your phone
[1:31:11] don't leave it in your
[1:31:13] person no get rid of it and you can use
[1:31:16] that discernment because if you sit back
[1:31:18] and say I fell again why did I fall what
[1:31:21] you'll see is there's a pattern behind
[1:31:22] it usually that's leading you up to that
[1:31:24] point time and time again you know for
[1:31:26] young men it may be sensuality and lust
[1:31:28] and these different things for young
[1:31:29] women it could be all sorts of things
[1:31:31] but you'll see a pattern there and what
[1:31:33] you've got to understand is when you see
[1:31:34] that pattern you back away before it
[1:31:36] goes too far and that's Holy Ghost
[1:31:38] discernment that's doing that because in
[1:31:41] here doesn't want it but your flesh is
[1:31:43] craving it there's plenty of Believers
[1:31:45] dealing with addictions plenty of
[1:31:47] Believers dealing with things they can't
[1:31:48] lay down your phone can be the greatest
[1:31:50] addiction for a Believer today
[1:31:52] and you got to know that you can lay it
[1:31:53] down and if you can't lay it down
[1:31:55] there's a problem in there something to
[1:31:57] be dealt with listen brother brandham
[1:31:59] had a cross in his
[1:32:01] car hanging from the rearview mirror the
[1:32:03] prophet of God the seventh Church age
[1:32:07] messenger had a cross hanging from his
[1:32:10] window from his rearview mirror you know
[1:32:12] why he says I looked it up just before
[1:32:14] service remember he was blind for that
[1:32:16] little bit from from the the accident he
[1:32:18] had with the gun and he told God he said
[1:32:20] God if you give me back my s I'll never
[1:32:22] look at something again that I ought not
[1:32:24] to look at and he said I was driving
[1:32:26] down the road with my wife in the car in
[1:32:28] this certain town he says and I kept
[1:32:30] having to look one way to the other to
[1:32:31] keep to stop from seeing the women that
[1:32:33] were dressed inappropriately you can't
[1:32:36] go anywhere today you can't even avoid
[1:32:38] it it's everywhere but brother bradam
[1:32:41] would say what red-blooded American man
[1:32:44] he says it draws your eyes he says but
[1:32:47] you make a choice as to what you do what
[1:32:48] you look at the prophet of God had a
[1:32:51] cross there to remind him of the price
[1:32:53] that Christ paid to help him to turn his
[1:32:57] head if he needs it I need it amen if he
[1:33:01] needs it you need it for whatever it is
[1:33:03] in our lives amen there's got to be
[1:33:06] something there that says I don't want
[1:33:08] that and let me tell you when you've
[1:33:10] been free from it a while you'll you'll
[1:33:11] start to understand what it means to be
[1:33:13] free in Christ you'll say I can't
[1:33:15] believe I waited this long this is so
[1:33:16] much better than the than the the
[1:33:18] perverted or or or the the this the the
[1:33:20] fleshly gratification we got from those
[1:33:23] things when your life is clean it's a
[1:33:26] wonderful thing and you're closer to God
[1:33:28] and Satan can't use your your your your
[1:33:30] mind against you he can't use your
[1:33:31] memories he can't use your faults
[1:33:33] against you in that way again it's not
[1:33:34] about perfection but it's the things
[1:33:36] that we tend to raise up in our lives as
[1:33:38] big deals it's all the same to God it's
[1:33:40] all sin listen I tell a lie and you look
[1:33:43] at pornography it's the same in God's
[1:33:44] eyes Sin Sin it it doesn't matter to him
[1:33:47] but we we put these levels on it and
[1:33:49] sometimes that's what Satan uses against
[1:33:51] us
[1:33:52] but listen to this as I was studying
[1:33:53] through
[1:33:54] this brother Bram said
[1:33:56] this he's speaking to the ministers and
[1:34:00] really this could go for anyone but
[1:34:01] especially for ministers so I guess I'm
[1:34:02] preaching to myself he says and there
[1:34:05] are three things that I notied in the
[1:34:06] Bible that always trip up a minister he
[1:34:09] says and one of them was money the other
[1:34:10] was popularity in women so I know that
[1:34:12] Saul fell because of popularity balum
[1:34:15] because of money and Samson because of
[1:34:16] women so then I know those three things
[1:34:18] are a hindrance that we must always keep
[1:34:21] covered up he says and money of course
[1:34:23] would be the greatest but catch what he
[1:34:25] throws in at the end here doesn't throw
[1:34:27] it in he says or trying to think you're
[1:34:31] just a little bit better than somebody
[1:34:34] else I think we can all fit in that one
[1:34:38] but it can fit in with Ministries as
[1:34:39] well that burns cuz sometimes we can get
[1:34:42] a little cocky about how good we
[1:34:44] are and I'll say that as a minister and
[1:34:47] I'll say that as about a a spouse or
[1:34:50] this our jobs whatever we can get cocky
[1:34:53] and we can start thinking this is about
[1:34:55] me cuz I'm so good and we look down on
[1:34:58] that brother we look down on that sister
[1:34:59] that's just trying to do a work for the
[1:35:01] Lord and we say really how can anybody
[1:35:04] listen to him does she really think
[1:35:07] she's
[1:35:08] helping and why do we look down because
[1:35:11] we've elevated ourself in our sight and
[1:35:14] we're comparing them to us and we think
[1:35:17] I'm good we're all a sinner saved by
[1:35:20] grace' there is nothing good in this
[1:35:23] flesh nothing whatsoever but brother
[1:35:25] Bram says that one of these signs that
[1:35:27] you're getting tripped up he says you
[1:35:28] think you're better than somebody else
[1:35:30] God help us God help me God help me if
[1:35:35] we ever think that we're anything
[1:35:37] special amen we get critical we get
[1:35:38] cynical of these things we're going to
[1:35:40] dwell on this a little bit later in this
[1:35:42] series I think but let me say this when
[1:35:45] we start thinking too much of ourselves
[1:35:47] get ready for a fall remember the
[1:35:49] scripture says Pride goes before
[1:35:50] destruction and a body spirit before a
[1:35:52] fall an arrogant spirit is never ever
[1:35:55] ever ever of the Holy Spirit I I I've
[1:35:59] told this story before brother brandom
[1:36:00] and I I couldn't find it I just thought
[1:36:03] about it when I was in the in the room
[1:36:04] back there getting ready but he's
[1:36:06] preaching in a service and he's talking
[1:36:07] about a certain Minister that had got up
[1:36:09] and he had he had confused a brother and
[1:36:12] and he kind of shamed him publicly on
[1:36:14] his Doctrine and it was the same
[1:36:15] doctrine that brother Brandon preached
[1:36:17] and brother Bram said something along
[1:36:18] the lines don't quote me here but I'm
[1:36:20] just generalizing he said if I was there
[1:36:22] or if he was here today I'd rip him
[1:36:23] apart with the Bible and that's the kind
[1:36:26] of the way he phrased it and I remember
[1:36:29] the first time I heard that it's the
[1:36:30] only time I've heard it actually and I
[1:36:32] was in the car I was in my little 94
[1:36:33] Volkswagen Golf and and I was listening
[1:36:36] to that and literally the Holy Spirit I
[1:36:39] was listening to that tape and it was
[1:36:40] wonderful the Holy Spirit I felt it
[1:36:43] leave in the car where I was listening I
[1:36:45] felt it Go and it was like a chill just
[1:36:47] went over and I was
[1:36:49] like and and and I knew he shouldn't
[1:36:52] have said that and about 15 seconds
[1:36:54] later brother Braham says what happened
[1:36:56] what did I say he says oh I did some I
[1:36:58] said something and he said I said
[1:37:00] something I shouldn't he says forgive me
[1:37:03] he says he left he didn't like that
[1:37:05] because brother Bram had done what he'd
[1:37:07] elevated himself brother Bram was a
[1:37:09] sixth grade educated
[1:37:12] hillbilly he wasn't where he was because
[1:37:14] of anything in himself he was where he
[1:37:16] was because God chose and ordained him a
[1:37:19] prophet and everything he knew by
[1:37:21] Revelation was from God and he's saying
[1:37:24] I would tear that Man Apart God didn't
[1:37:26] like
[1:37:27] it cuz what it was arrogance not
[1:37:31] humility brother brah was saying I'd
[1:37:33] destroy that man the purpose of a
[1:37:35] prophet is not to destroy that comes if
[1:37:37] you don't listen to the prophet and what
[1:37:40] he' done he'd switched his
[1:37:41] ministry it wasn't what he was meant to
[1:37:43] do and he says he's gone he left I did
[1:37:46] something I said something and he
[1:37:47] humbled himself and he asked and he
[1:37:49] apologized and he asked the Forgiveness
[1:37:50] of the audience that was there shouldn't
[1:37:52] have said it cuz he elevated himself
[1:37:55] it's a scary
[1:37:56] thing but if we can understand God has
[1:37:58] all sorts of
[1:38:00] Ministries listen you look at you look
[1:38:02] at the two sisters that sang this
[1:38:04] weekend couldn't be any more
[1:38:06] different in how they
[1:38:08] sang but
[1:38:10] anointed can you imagine if we said we
[1:38:12] only like the way sister Morin sings but
[1:38:14] we don't like the way sister Priscilla
[1:38:15] does and sister Amber come on give me a
[1:38:18] break what does she think no we love
[1:38:21] what each one has and we love how you
[1:38:23] sing sister Amber we only get it once a
[1:38:26] year and I've said that before it's a
[1:38:27] shame but here's the thing she moves as
[1:38:29] the spirit moves her and I can respect
[1:38:32] that I can respect that I love that I'd
[1:38:35] Rather somebody came up and and it had
[1:38:37] an effect every time rather than
[1:38:38] somebody came up all the time and it had
[1:38:40] no effect amen amen we don't want
[1:38:43] stuffed shirts up here but can you
[1:38:45] imagine if we went by
[1:38:47] preference or perception rather than
[1:38:50] anointing
[1:38:52] or by understanding remember brother
[1:38:54] baham says God's got pennies in his
[1:38:55] kingdom he's got nickels he's got dimes
[1:38:57] and he's got silver dollars and you
[1:38:59] start thinking you're a silver dollar I
[1:39:01] start thinking I'm a silver dollar and I
[1:39:03] start looking down on the Nickels
[1:39:04] they're still in the kingdom of God they
[1:39:07] still have the Holy Ghost they still
[1:39:09] have a purpose look at what what what
[1:39:11] Paul said in Romans he said who art thou
[1:39:13] that judgest another man's servant to
[1:39:16] his own Master he standeth or fth in
[1:39:19] other words he's his boss determines if
[1:39:21] he's doing well or he's
[1:39:22] not if he stays in that position or he
[1:39:25] he gets demoted or he gets promoted he
[1:39:27] says yay he hold he shall be Holden up
[1:39:30] for God is able to make him stand listen
[1:39:34] the remember the scripture says that the
[1:39:37] this this this work is in Earth and
[1:39:38] vessels that the Excellency would be of
[1:39:40] God and not of
[1:39:41] us I'm an earth and vessel you're an
[1:39:44] earth and vessel there's nothing here
[1:39:46] that's strong and sturdy unless God's
[1:39:48] inside of us amen working through US
[1:39:50] amen we take tend to make things
[1:39:51] relative it's the human thing we like to
[1:39:53] rank right we like statistics we like to
[1:39:56] compare so we compare preachers we
[1:39:58] compare singers We compare workers We
[1:40:00] compare how people look and how they
[1:40:01] dress and better and worse and all these
[1:40:04] different things and and so we can take
[1:40:06] a you know a prince among preachers and
[1:40:08] we'll put them up here and then we'll
[1:40:10] put the guy down here that can barely
[1:40:11] string it together and he's got to read
[1:40:13] most of his sermon and do all of these
[1:40:14] things and we say well this one's worse
[1:40:16] and this one's
[1:40:17] better but that's not the way God works
[1:40:21] because remember when when you look at
[1:40:23] the parable of the talents he said what
[1:40:25] did you do with what I gave you he
[1:40:28] didn't say who got the most he says what
[1:40:30] did you do with what I gave you to one
[1:40:32] he gave five and he got another five to
[1:40:34] one he gave two he got another two to
[1:40:35] one he gave one and he did nothing with
[1:40:37] it and he was judged because he did
[1:40:39] nothing with it not because he didn't do
[1:40:40] a lot with it see we look at who's the
[1:40:43] best preacher Christ looks at what did
[1:40:46] you do with the preaching gift I gave
[1:40:48] you we look at if we look at at a a a at
[1:40:51] the appearance of it the measure of it
[1:40:53] and God looks at the effect of it listen
[1:40:56] if God makes you able to lift 100 pounds
[1:40:58] and you're walking around lifting 50 in
[1:40:59] the kingdom of God God's not happy but
[1:41:02] if you're made to build to lift 100
[1:41:03] pound and you walk around lifting 100
[1:41:05] pound in the Kingdom God's happy may
[1:41:08] maybe some of us are you know maybe
[1:41:09] we're just spiritual weaklings and so
[1:41:12] God says all I need you to do is carry a
[1:41:14] backpack in the kingdom of God as long
[1:41:17] as we carry the backpack he's happy with
[1:41:18] us he's made us for that remember God
[1:41:20] brother brah said God will train a man
[1:41:22] all his life for 15 minutes of
[1:41:25] work John had a six-month
[1:41:28] Ministry and then he's cast into prison
[1:41:31] six
[1:41:32] months Jesus was three and a half some
[1:41:35] of the Apostles look at
[1:41:37] Steven stepen Steven was killed within
[1:41:40] months of receiving the Holy Ghost but
[1:41:42] effective while he was there and about
[1:41:44] the father's business and those
[1:41:48] things but each and every one of us are
[1:41:50] human
[1:41:51] and so we look at that and what happens
[1:41:52] is we may have a lot of times what
[1:41:54] happens we've got a maybe a period of
[1:41:55] Victory or things are going really well
[1:41:57] and then we look at somebody that's
[1:41:58] struggling and we start to put them down
[1:42:01] we start to say why can't they snap out
[1:42:02] of it why can't they do this oh they
[1:42:04] just need to do more of this and do more
[1:42:06] of that as if we've never been there
[1:42:08] right come on
[1:42:10] now as if we've never been there chances
[1:42:13] are if we were really honest just about
[1:42:15] every any trial that any one one of us
[1:42:17] has had another one of us has had and
[1:42:19] some of us handled it better than
[1:42:21] others and we need to realize those
[1:42:23] things but each and every one of us has
[1:42:25] got a got an area to cover up and that
[1:42:28] weakness is not a sign of unbelief it's
[1:42:30] not a not a sign that we don't have the
[1:42:31] Holy Ghost but it's a sign that we've
[1:42:32] got a battle on our hands remember
[1:42:35] brother brother brandwood say that quote
[1:42:36] he says you know God doesn't just put
[1:42:38] you in a pipe and push you through out
[1:42:39] the other end and then you get to say
[1:42:40] you got a victory you got to fight you
[1:42:43] got to battle and that's often through
[1:42:44] the weaknesses that are in our flesh the
[1:42:46] weaknesses that come genetically
[1:42:47] whatever we want to we we've got and
[1:42:50] we've got to be able to go to God and
[1:42:51] say it is what it is I've got it I've
[1:42:54] got a fight on my hands I've got a
[1:42:55] battle on my hands I've got a struggle
[1:42:56] on my hands and we got to go to him and
[1:42:58] say I need your help because if we sit
[1:43:01] here and we say I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:43:02] therefore I have no problems that's not
[1:43:05] going to work and Satan will have a
[1:43:07] field day with us if we sit there trying
[1:43:09] to cover up what God's trying to take
[1:43:11] out of our
[1:43:13] Lives we don't get a better of flower
[1:43:16] ease we've all got to fight we've all
[1:43:18] got to battle in these things listen to
[1:43:20] this brother B said I was just talking
[1:43:22] to a young Minister and his wife in the
[1:43:23] room just a few moments ago and both of
[1:43:26] them are nervous just like the rest of
[1:43:27] the world the rest of the human beings
[1:43:29] on Earth and I said remember Satan's got
[1:43:32] a Punch coming at you don't care who you
[1:43:35] are he's got a WR for that one punch now
[1:43:38] which would you rather that punch be be
[1:43:40] blind be an arthritic sitting in a chair
[1:43:42] or be nervous see he's got somewhere he
[1:43:44] can punch you he's got to right to that
[1:43:46] open place he says now that's the spot
[1:43:49] you got to keep covered all the time you
[1:43:52] got to keep it covered covered up with
[1:43:54] what prayer cuz remember Paul went to
[1:43:57] God and he has that weakness I liked how
[1:44:00] Brother David said I didn't I didn't
[1:44:02] understand I'd never understood it that
[1:44:04] way where he said that that when Paul
[1:44:06] was healed of the blindness that was
[1:44:07] struck on him when he got knocked off
[1:44:09] his horse he says God didn't heal it
[1:44:11] completely He restored his sight but he
[1:44:13] didn't restore it all the way and he
[1:44:14] says that was the weakness in Paul's in
[1:44:16] Paul's flesh that's what he said that
[1:44:18] sounded good to me I can't it's not thus
[1:44:20] sayith the Lord anything but it would
[1:44:21] make sense he said he gave it to he gave
[1:44:23] he mostly healed him but he didn't heal
[1:44:24] him all the way and then Paul says I
[1:44:26] went to God three times and said Lord
[1:44:28] take it away and what did God come back
[1:44:30] and say he said Paul my strength is made
[1:44:32] perfect in your
[1:44:34] weakness Paul you're a bigger testimony
[1:44:37] with this weakness than you would be if
[1:44:39] you never have it in the first place and
[1:44:41] sometimes that's the big picture we've
[1:44:43] got to see is that God's giving us a
[1:44:45] testimony that others can't hope to have
[1:44:47] with the exact same condition or issue
[1:44:49] in their life he says that's the spot
[1:44:51] you got to keep covered all the
[1:44:54] time I'm talking about humility really
[1:44:57] for this and we're talking about the
[1:44:58] Capstone of Charity but I'm setting a
[1:45:00] basis this this this evening for where
[1:45:01] we're going in the next few services
[1:45:03] with that and that's one thing is when
[1:45:05] you get to the Capstone you realize this
[1:45:07] is not about
[1:45:08] you in the sense of it can't be about
[1:45:12] who I am and how I look and what people
[1:45:16] think about me and how I appear and what
[1:45:19] no no no when you come to this point you
[1:45:21] should have been broken down so that
[1:45:24] God's ready to really start using you
[1:45:26] when we come to this this is the the
[1:45:28] complete sanctification this is the
[1:45:30] complete cleaning out and it's the
[1:45:32] preparing for God to dwell in and God
[1:45:34] will share his glory with no man and so
[1:45:36] when you come to this if you don't have
[1:45:38] that humility then God won't give you
[1:45:41] the Holy Ghost I'm not saying you'll
[1:45:42] never have moments of arrogance or these
[1:45:44] different things again we're fighting
[1:45:46] the stink in flesh but if you come up to
[1:45:48] this and you're sitting there say well I
[1:45:50] just just deserve this now look what
[1:45:52] I've
[1:45:53] done look who I am passed every test
[1:45:57] with flying colors look at that poor guy
[1:45:59] over
[1:46:00] there that's not the way God's doing it
[1:46:04] God's looking for humility
[1:46:07] amen so when we come to this it's Christ
[1:46:10] Living in you and that means you have to
[1:46:11] have died out you've got to come to a
[1:46:14] place of full surrender you've got to
[1:46:15] come to a place where you've just let go
[1:46:17] and you've let God have his way and then
[1:46:18] the Holy Ghost this Capstone this ch it
[1:46:21] this love of God is what a sign or a
[1:46:23] token that God has accepted your
[1:46:26] sacrifice that he's accepted what you've
[1:46:28] laid on the altar that you've you've set
[1:46:30] yourself aside and that you're willing
[1:46:31] to let him truly have full control
[1:46:34] because that's the only way it's going
[1:46:35] to work amen like I said before that
[1:46:38] that that arrogant Spirit has no place
[1:46:39] and God will beat it out of us before
[1:46:41] he'll give us the Holy Ghost we can't be
[1:46:43] arrogant and expect him to come and
[1:46:44] dwell there Peter had to be completely
[1:46:46] humbled Peter got embarrassed remember
[1:46:48] the night of Jesus you know when he was
[1:46:51] going before the priesthood and whatnot
[1:46:53] and Peter saidou know Lord I'll never
[1:46:54] leave you I'll never forsake you and he
[1:46:56] says before the the the the rooster
[1:46:58] crows tonight three times you'll you'll
[1:47:00] uh before he crows you'll you'll deny me
[1:47:02] three times and he did and then Peter
[1:47:06] went out and he went fishing naked and
[1:47:08] he
[1:47:09] cursed Peter had to be humbled before he
[1:47:12] got the Holy
[1:47:13] Ghost but once he got it Peter was a
[1:47:15] changed man and he was confident without
[1:47:18] the
[1:47:19] arrogance Paul had to be
[1:47:21] humbled Paul had to be knocked off of
[1:47:23] his high horse and then he had to go out
[1:47:25] on the desert and God had to work with
[1:47:27] him and beat out of him all of that
[1:47:29] pheral attitude that he had brother Bram
[1:47:32] call him a high-tempered hook-nosed
[1:47:34] Jew he had to bring him to a place where
[1:47:36] he could surrender and truly let God
[1:47:38] flow through him rather than come in
[1:47:40] with now I've got now I've got the Holy
[1:47:42] Ghost and if we can just take that and
[1:47:43] take all the knowledge that I've I've
[1:47:45] got in my life and everything I've
[1:47:46] studied now we can really do good things
[1:47:48] God no no no he had to take him on the
[1:47:50] back back side of the Desert what' god
[1:47:51] do with Moses took him to the back side
[1:47:53] of the desert 40 years putting it in and
[1:47:56] 40 years beating it out and he went back
[1:47:58] in the power of God because he knew who
[1:48:00] he met and God had taken it away from
[1:48:02] him amen God will take you to the place
[1:48:05] listen if you're arrogant God can't use
[1:48:06] you yet but he'll get you to the place
[1:48:09] where he can use you that's it it's just
[1:48:12] that simple just cuz he just CU you're
[1:48:14] there now doesn't mean he can't use you
[1:48:16] but he'll use you when you've got that
[1:48:17] when he's he's got that all all the way
[1:48:19] out and you release to him brother BR
[1:48:21] says this we're starting to close he
[1:48:23] says I've always found that the man that
[1:48:26] humbles himself is the man that God
[1:48:28] exalts he said always found in other
[1:48:31] words he's never found an
[1:48:33] exception humility is power with god
[1:48:35] brother Brown would say elsewhere he
[1:48:37] says when you take a person with his
[1:48:38] chest out and knows everything you can't
[1:48:40] tell him nothing he's arrogant well
[1:48:42] that's the person that never gets
[1:48:43] anywhere but you take that person that
[1:48:45] humbles themselves and walks
[1:48:47] sweetly he says now surely after all
[1:48:50] these years on the field and around the
[1:48:51] world and seen different people I ought
[1:48:53] to know a little bit about the gate to
[1:48:54] enter and at and if you want to get
[1:48:56] somewhere with God never let an arrogant
[1:48:59] Spirit ever come around
[1:49:01] you that's one thing listen to this
[1:49:05] don't let malice come
[1:49:08] Ino now arrogant that's one thing but
[1:49:13] malice that's
[1:49:15] different that's a real battle some of
[1:49:18] us are naturally humble
[1:49:21] some of you are naturally
[1:49:26] humble
[1:49:29] amen but when it comes to
[1:49:31] malice holding things against
[1:49:34] somebody there are very few people have
[1:49:36] that naturally because we get
[1:49:39] hurt that's when the spikes come out
[1:49:42] amen that's when the swords come
[1:49:45] out he says no matter what anybody does
[1:49:49] if they are wrong don't you never build
[1:49:52] up a complex against that person God
[1:49:56] help
[1:49:57] us God help you I'm dealing with the
[1:50:00] arrogance you guys deal with the
[1:50:02] mice no God help us all see you be sweet
[1:50:07] and kind remember God loved you when you
[1:50:10] were in sin and if the spirit of God is
[1:50:12] in you you love that other person when
[1:50:14] he's in wrong see just pray for them and
[1:50:18] love one another watch now as we start
[1:50:20] to
[1:50:21] close he says a chain is strongest at
[1:50:24] its weakest link that's right he says
[1:50:27] it's no stronger than its weakest link
[1:50:30] he says no matter how strong and he
[1:50:31] starts pointing to this and I I I added
[1:50:34] it to the slide these these Seven
[1:50:35] Virtues he says no matter how strong
[1:50:37] these are built up or this is built up
[1:50:39] if it's got a weak link that's where she
[1:50:41] breaks he says now if you possess you
[1:50:43] say you got this this and this and you
[1:50:45] don't have this that's where she breaks
[1:50:47] so you say you got faith virtue
[1:50:48] knowledge but you don't have Temperance
[1:50:49] he say says that's where your Christian
[1:50:51] walk
[1:50:52] breaks it's as far as you can go you can
[1:50:55] say you've got patience godliness and
[1:50:56] brotherly kindness but if Temperance is
[1:50:58] no good then the chain breaks there and
[1:51:00] you'll never get really the opportunity
[1:51:02] to do the other the others above it he
[1:51:04] says if you got this and haven't got
[1:51:06] that shall break right there he says you
[1:51:08] can't have this without having
[1:51:10] this right so you can't just have you
[1:51:14] can't pick and choose you got to have
[1:51:16] each and every one of them in order for
[1:51:18] this whole thing to work
[1:51:20] but don't use it as an excuse if you
[1:51:22] don't got it that's the
[1:51:25] thing a family I won't say who it was
[1:51:28] but a family member said you know a
[1:51:30] minister one time said something and in
[1:51:33] just in private fellowship and they said
[1:51:36] you shouldn't say
[1:51:37] that he said well if you know what was
[1:51:40] in my head and what I really could have
[1:51:41] said you wouldn't say that and they said
[1:51:44] we all have those thoughts we all have
[1:51:46] things we think sometimes and maybe
[1:51:48] we're cutting remarks or sarcastic or
[1:51:50] these different things just cuz you
[1:51:52] think it doesn't mean you can just
[1:51:53] dilute it by 90% And still put it out
[1:51:56] some you have to hold you have to be
[1:51:58] able to hold and that was a lesson that
[1:52:00] brother had to learn was because he
[1:52:02] thought well because I'm not saying
[1:52:03] everything I want to say then it's
[1:52:04] somehow okay no sometimes we got to
[1:52:06] learn to just keep our mouth shut
[1:52:08] period right holding it's like you know
[1:52:12] punch somebody as hard as you can or
[1:52:13] punch them you know a third of what you
[1:52:15] can it's still a punch that doesn't make
[1:52:17] it right just because you didn't hit
[1:52:18] them as hard as you can you're not
[1:52:20] supposed to hit him in the first place
[1:52:22] amen it's the same thing I read in in my
[1:52:24] devotions the other morning we answer
[1:52:25] for every Idol word we
[1:52:28] say and it can be critical it can be
[1:52:30] joking it can be all these things but we
[1:52:32] answer for those things and this brother
[1:52:34] had a you know he's very very very quick
[1:52:36] to think in these things and he he was
[1:52:38] kind of spouting off but they said you
[1:52:39] can't do that you're a minister
[1:52:41] especially because you're a minister you
[1:52:42] can't say those types of things because
[1:52:44] it'll dampen your influence with the
[1:52:46] people and it'll cause a break in your
[1:52:48] testimony like that
[1:52:50] it was a weak point and he had to he had
[1:52:52] to go to God and he had to get that
[1:52:53] covered up and get that taken out of
[1:52:57] him he says so when you
[1:53:00] surrender your complete being
[1:53:03] when not if
[1:53:05] when when you surrender your complete
[1:53:08] being then the Holy Spirit just pours
[1:53:11] through you in these virtues then you're
[1:53:15] a living Tabernacle he says then people
[1:53:19] look out and say you say brother John
[1:53:22] you've been preaching we've got to have
[1:53:23] all these attributes you do but he says
[1:53:25] once you get the Holy Spirit flowing
[1:53:27] through them then people look out and
[1:53:30] say that's a man full of virtue
[1:53:32] knowledge he believes the word
[1:53:34] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:53:36] kindness full of the love of the Holy
[1:53:37] Ghost see there he is walking around
[1:53:40] what is it it's a stature that
[1:53:41] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[1:53:44] a Christian there is a man or a woman
[1:53:47] who knows what they're talking
[1:53:51] about he said you've never seen a person
[1:53:54] that knows what's under the Seven Seals
[1:53:56] like they
[1:53:57] do is that is that what he
[1:54:00] said he said you've never seen a Kinder
[1:54:03] sweeter godlier person because remember
[1:54:06] it's not knowledge knowledge is a part
[1:54:08] of it it's not Doctrine doctrine's a
[1:54:10] part of it it's not dos and don'ts but
[1:54:13] it's a part of it it's not just the
[1:54:14] clothes you wear but it's a part of it
[1:54:16] but it's a Kinder sweeter godlier person
[1:54:20] we'll close with this he says you're
[1:54:22] sealed a seal shows on both sides
[1:54:25] whether you're going or coming you see
[1:54:28] the seal just the same let me put it
[1:54:30] this
[1:54:31] way coming into the situation people see
[1:54:35] you're a Christian and going out of the
[1:54:37] situation they see you're still a
[1:54:39] Christian coming in or going out doesn't
[1:54:42] matter which way you're going people
[1:54:44] know you're a Christian by the way you
[1:54:45] act he says there you are see when a
[1:54:48] woman man or woman possess this then the
[1:54:51] Capstone comes down and seals them into
[1:54:54] the kingdom of God which is the Holy
[1:54:58] Ghost amen God bless you let's stand
[1:55:00] this evening if we
[1:55:02] would I thought I was going to be a lot
[1:55:06] shorter amen but that's
[1:55:08] okay amen like I said there's a lot to
[1:55:10] this it's pretty chunky and so we're
[1:55:12] going to just take some of these as we
[1:55:14] go through but I wanted to set this this
[1:55:16] this tone here humility
[1:55:20] sweetness kindness they know how to act
[1:55:24] they know how to respond these things
[1:55:27] because without that we're going to just
[1:55:29] be playing
[1:55:30] games if we don't know how to
[1:55:33] act then how in the world are we ever
[1:55:35] going to say that we're we're ready for
[1:55:37] God to come in and dwell if we can't do
[1:55:39] the basics how can we do the Greater
[1:55:42] Works because remember the Greater Works
[1:55:44] is is not just the signs and wonders
[1:55:47] it's being able to turn the other cheek
[1:55:50] it's being able to pray for the ones
[1:55:51] that despitefully use you it's to not
[1:55:54] rail back when they rail against you
[1:55:56] it's to Bear the burden of the one that
[1:55:58] can't bear it these are the things that
[1:56:01] define the acts of a Christian the rest
[1:56:04] is the works of the Holy Spirit but
[1:56:06] there's got to be an act in our life
[1:56:08] there's got to be a life inside of us
[1:56:10] that makes us walk the way he walks
[1:56:13] first and foremost and then what happens
[1:56:15] is he comes in and he lives in there
[1:56:17] we'll read the quote where brother brah
[1:56:18] gets into it he says then your faith
[1:56:20] becomes his faith your knowledge becomes
[1:56:23] his knowledge your Temperance becomes
[1:56:25] his Temperance your patience becomes his
[1:56:27] patience and now what he's doing is he's
[1:56:29] taking you to a whole new level and he's
[1:56:31] placing you in the body of Christ and
[1:56:32] that's where in you're in Heavenly
[1:56:34] places in Christ is you recognize your
[1:56:36] position you recognize what you're
[1:56:38] supposed to do and you recognize that
[1:56:40] he's given you all power and authority
[1:56:42] to do what he's asked you to do it's a
[1:56:44] wonderful place but like anything he's
[1:56:47] building us up into these things amen
[1:56:49] amen let's just pray together Heavenly
[1:56:53] Father Lord all I can say is make us
[1:56:56] more like
