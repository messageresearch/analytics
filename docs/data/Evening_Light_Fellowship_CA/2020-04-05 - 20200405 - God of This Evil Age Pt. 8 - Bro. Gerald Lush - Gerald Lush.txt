it's a him but it's our prayer we thank you Lord for the anointing that causes that brother that sister Lord to write it to express Lord the demons thoughts of the elect of God the deepest thoughts Lord of your seed of your bride father calling on the name of the Lord calling on your presence how to new you create praying Lord for the moving of your spirit the quickening Lord of the word of God in our hearts and in our souls so we thank you and we pray the grace of God to continue with us father in a world that is under judgment in a world that is experiencing the judgment of God the Lord that we would be able to rejoice in the grace of God to us the grace of God that has called us father to the remembrance of your word the grace of God has called us to give us father the revelation of the Blessed hope a man eternal life the resurrection the rapture hallelujah praying the grace of God to give us a greater and a greater and a greater faith father concerning the resurrection a greater faith concerning the rapture to believe Lord that we're living in that day living in that hour and we're looking for that change so your grace to be with us their grace with father the few of us that are here and the other father online in the in their homes god I've mercy and bless them Lord made their needs in the name of Jesus answer their questions to solve their doubts all for the glory of God to build us up in the most holy faith in these last days so grace I pray Lord to the sick the lonely the suffering the grace of God to family friends and neighbors oh my lord we committed all into your care today hallelujah asking your mercy as you were father in the days of Noah as you were Lord in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah father that your grace would be here Lord as it was for Abraham it was really knock it was for Noah father Grace that we were playing favor with you today amen so blessed I pray thee your sons and daughters father with your word with the faith that pleases you grace to us all Lord in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the name of the lord god bless you amen just to thank the Lord for His grace again a man it's amazing that we're having a service with only four or five that would remind me of the of the cottage means we had fifty years ago oh yes said brother burns and sister Burgess a man absolutely amazing absolutely amazing and because we did we were totally standing on the scriptures where Jesus said where two or three are gathered together by name there are my anthem it's a man what because we went to this house to that house with another house and he's just two or three maybe four or five that that was that was it and I remember ministering to college meetings preaching and college meetings but we're now we come back to that again so the grace of God be with us brother amen and the grace of God be with those that are at home and to realize to we think this is just it's going to be until this thing passes well they've got no cures for it and they're still fighting it so and and brother as long as that's going on then then we're going to be out of the church as it were most of the Saints will had to be left at home so brother or mine what an hour that God is requiring us to make our calling and our election sure a man in times like this and in days like this when these things are going on we better make sure that we're the elect of God amen and then what's going on brother it's not it's not just it's for us not for us it's for the world but for us in a sense and as I said there in the last service it is to get us to look up a man if God is that God is expecting anything of the obvious seed of the Bride of Christ it is to look up a man because a man you're gonna you're gonna recognize in a scripture be fulfilled for the last days you're gonna recognize scripture being fulfilled prior to the rapture and the resurrection look up amen so we better get closer and closer to the Lord by the grace of God and die more and more to ourselves and become more and more alive to him oh yes we gotta become more and more sensitive to his leadership and his presence well God have mercy on us is my prayer and maybe maybe the prophet saw this before the Lord took him home because he said there's things in his heart that he wouldn't be able to tell us a man the things that God revealed to him but he could not reveal it to us so he knew and no doubt for some of the things that he was preaching they were that was the reason is because of the of the Spirit that we will be dealing with because of it because of what will be going on and even in the message that we've been dealing with the god of this evil age amen the Prophet was recognizing the beginning of it then what would he see today a man he would certainly see Satan as the god of this evil age because more and more are under Satan's influence their thoughts their words their deeds is the influence of Satan oh yeah religious and yeah decay can be identified as all that's the message yeah but it is Satan's influence why just look at their thoughts and look at their words look at their deeds and see if it's the Holy Ghost or see if it's another spirit a man you go so far but not all the way hey man y'all got all God's grace to his brother and this hour why because again and again and again the Scriptures warns us that it's gonna be so deceiving it would deceive the very elect impossible jesus warned about it oh yeah I said this is going to happen that's going to happen buddy so I want to warn you he said there are things are going to happen it's going to be so deceiving if possible it would deceit the very life any man why because it's going to be so close to the truth it's going so close to what God has done and what God is doing a man that people think well that's gone no it's the devil amen because he knows as I've said before he's come down with faith he's come down with great right knowing knowing knowing this time is short what do we know a man so I pray the grace of God we know our time is short a man we're going to Eternity but at the same time we also know what the devil amen and we're not going to be deceived whether it's our thoughts or words or deeds we're not going to be influenced by the devil it's gonna be under the influence of the Holy Ghost amen the grace of God be with us turn with me to the Book of Isaiah chapter 14 and the grace of God be with sister John Whitten been many years since we have been in contact with her and her family so no doubt I've been thinking about it I said Lord I said what's going on now in the earth I said it's going to it's going to shake a lot of people that were believers a man oh yeah it is and and maybe they'll come back but maybe too late grant God's grace to us and again the power of God did say and it's in the message on I believe was the seven Church ages and as many years ago and he said listen he said we won't reach everyone with this message he said only the elect only the right of Christ the message is sent to call it the bride the message is sent to give the bride rapturing faith a man so the message is sent to give us the revelation of the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bright a man he has come down to get the right and to give her faith to go up amen by the grace of God so god help us is my prayer and also to keep in prayer concerning the Easter meetings if this thing is going on and on and on then still the church won't be able to get together for Easter meetings and also it's been on my heart concerning the communion so we'd almost have to just go from house to house to serve communion so we pray the grace of God be with us and help us see it's coming to that place where you won't be able to believe what you believe it yes what you won't be able to live what you what you're living what you're believing you don't want to be able to do this won't be able to do that because of what's going on in the world and it may man and again we're under the understanding that we're not allowed together now only for just 5 or less in a church and knowing that we just saw it on the on the internet there was a request that that we closed all buildings including including churches yeah oh yeah they want this close that close that close they want churches clothes a man well what are we going to do I guess we'd have to meet in what would others house again and they back we're back to two or three again and then they don't want you to do that no don't want you to do that so it's amazing so we pray the grace of God that will make our calling and election shore amen and if you're not able to get together with the Saints you just go and it in your Claire your prayer closet and shut the door and talk to the Lord amen the grace of God brother it's come down to that now it's you and your faith what is that's what God's looking for now God has permitted this for a reason he's permitted this you know to to to bring out the manifests the negative attitude and spirit of the world but also to bring out the positive attitude and spirit of the bright of the true seat of God by the grace of God so God help us is my prayer to make our calling and election sure to make sure you're in the word and make sure your with the word to make sure that your thoughts your words your deeds is under the influence of the Holy Ghost not the devil amen so brace brother it grace grace grace make your calling and your election sure amen stayed with the word make sure every day in thought word indeed you're lining up with the word more and more by the grace of God amen so I want to share with you I was hoping to be able to bring it to a conclusion regarding the thought on the god of this evil age will sail far the Lord will have us to go or allow us to go today Amen I'll try not to be too long but at the same time I want to get the word out the thus saith the Lord in in the word it is written and also the the spoken word by the Prophet so we'll see as the Lord leads us but I want to share these scriptures with you and there's a number of scriptures and we'll try to get through all the scriptures and then get into some thoughts to bring it to a conclusion on the god of this evil age if there's anything that any revelation that we need to know any revelation we need to understand is the god of this evil age a man oh there are those who feel well we don't need to know this we don't need to know that that's the devil yeah but we need to know it so that we're not going to be deceived by it we need to know it so that we will be there and that's we'll know whether it's God or whether it's Satan a man and yet to be on our guard because it's going to be so close to deceive the very elect if possible so brother sister let's pray the grace of God that we want me to seat well yet we'll say oh I believe the message the devil does too I believe this I believe that so does the devil brother did the devil believes the message sometimes more than a lot of believers believe it that's the absolute truth he knows this is the truth he knows this is thus saith the Lord this is written and so on brother he knew it in the Garden of Eden yes God said and he knows that today yeah if God said but a bad let's forget the buts and give as we say give him to the goats it's the goats the but not sheep or lambs so there and remember what did he use two goats for they used the goats to lead the sheep to the slaughter that's right and the goats to go up and the goats had just jumped off but they're on and the Sheep of go on into the slaughter oh yeah then they get to go to the lead some more in get the goats elites amore brother we pray the grace of God went on under the leadership of goats run to the leadership of the of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world praise the Lord that a man that our hope is Christ in us not the devil influencing us in our mine's in our spirits in our feelings but it's God is closing us through the revelation in our hearts and in our souls God remembered through your new birth he put the devil out and he took control he fought the devil it could we were born with that born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies but the new birth put Satan out and brought God's control into your soul amen by the grace of Almighty God amen so he's controlling your spirit and for your spirit is there to control your thoughts your words and your deeds grace what for it is to line it up with his word for the day in the hour you're living it is to light it up with his word so he can do what he wants to do in your age amen he can do what he wants to do in you today amen amen what is what kind of a witness is God expecting you to have them and to give to the world a man we got to realize we can understand that there there's many of there because that's gonna lay down their lives as the foolish virgins but I pray God that we are wise virgins a man and we know what to do we know what God wants we know why God is expecting of us grace to us a man so grace to us here grace to the state's online a man and those in DVD land to God be the glory so I want to share with you these scriptures and pray the grace of God give us the revelation thereof that we need to be on our guard amen I just take it for granted but to put it by word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee a may grace of God so that we'd be on our guard and not be deceived by the devil it was in your head evil to Seaview you add to it you'll take from it oh yeah but it's in your heart he want to see you a man because God has given us power in our souls over the world the flesh and the devil amen my victory is on the inside of the inside we are more than conquerors in our Lord Jesus Christ in in Isaiah chapter 14 and I've got five maybe six or seven scriptures who will see in as Isaiah chapter 14 he said in verse 1 for the Lord will have mercy on Jacob and will yet choose Israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob and the people should take them and bring them to their place and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and animates and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors a man God giving us power over the world the flesh the devil but also eyeing the devil highlighting the God of this evil age warning us concerning who he is and what he is trying to do in you and through you what did was he trying to influence us I was he in trying to influence you brother sister don't don't just take it for granted and don't assume no I'm a Christian so when the devil is not going to do this he can't do that oh yes he can no matter what God has done all the way down through the age of saints were there to challenge it st. Anna there to get the people to doubt it Saints been there to get to add to it to take from it so brother it's no different than the day we still have to be on our guard God has called us out but brother sister the devil's there amen he's watching what God is doing brother when God came in flesh himself Saint was there to tempt him a male and if he was here to tempt Jesus he's there to tempt us so brother sister let's not fall to Satan's temptation he's there to tempt us again in our thoughts he's there to tempt us in our words or our deeds and again don't think well I didn't do this so I didn't do that what did you think something God's okay's your thoughts and it's in your heart amen God Luke in the heart God deals with it with us in our souls on the inside of the inside so brother sister I trust by the grace of God that were not under under and led by Saint thoughts or Satan's words or Satan's needs and his influence in it what he wants to do with us but we're under the influence of the Holy Ghost amen so that we have given ourselves totally over to the leadership of Christ amen so it's Christ in me the hope of glory not the devil's influence Jesus influence a man let's be on our guard began because why it's going to be close close they would deceive the very elect they met and again in verse three and it shall come to pass in the in the day that the Lord will give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou was made to serve that thou shall make up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say at the the oppressor ceased the Golden City sees the Lord has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers a man and it says he who smoked the got people in raft with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none endureth it says the whole earth is at rest and is quiet and they break forth into singing but he said yea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the Cedars of Lebanon saying since thou art laid down the feller has come up against us hell from beneath is move for the to meet thee yet by coming it stirs up the dead for thee a man even though God was doing this and God was going to bring down his blessings and his anointing that we're going to be challenged by the devil amen no matter what God has done when a god is doing her will you can be rest assured you're going to deal with Satan amen because from the beginning God dealt with the devil even before he created the heaven and the earth God dealt with Satan in heaven he walked up and down in the coals of fire and until iniquity was found in him pride a man so the grace of God brothers that we're not going to have what was sake was guilty elf we're not going to be guilty of a Maya so that he's not going to he's not going to put it into into your life or into our into our lives into our souls no we're praying the grace of God the token life of the blood of Jesus is there to keep the devil out a man and the enemy comes down in our thoughts you go to your spirit oh and you rebuke him amen because God is there - were to reveal to you this is not me that's Satan amen and Jesus had to deal with it even in Peter until Peter received the Holy Ghost and a funny man Peter at what oh my oh he was taking his stand for Jesus but it wasn't according to the word well you can take your stand for Jesus it's got to be according to the word for your date ain't my it and Jesus was taking our Peter was taking his stand and Jesus said I'm going to do this I got to do this and this is going to happen that's going to happen and Peter said no no no Lord no no no Lord no no you it's good to stop it don't go to Jerusalem don't do this don't do that and what did Jesus say get thee behind me Satan why because he knew the Satan was influencing Peter salts same was imposing Peters words and deeds a man and as I said before and our brother George bottled out you know you know let me repeat it now that here was Paul and he persecuted the Christians he killed Christians and yet God met him on the road a man anyway and ordained him because he was the messenger of the age what he was absolute may a mystery to the people in that first stage Paul Young so a certain of the disciples had to go and say listen you got to listen to Paul you gotta listen this yeah because they were questioning Paul they're wondering is he of God you know is God servant after all he's did to the believers the early church and so on but he was God's choice a man and look at Peter and as I said Jesus had more problems with Peter than he did Judas he had more problems with Peter than he did the other disciples we haven't as I said we got no record of God dealing with with Judas except that does at the Last Supper yeah and he told they're gonna do what he had to do it do it quickly yeah but he had to deal with Peter this mirror this mirror this spirit a man and a funny as they get there behind me Satan what a Peter feel I don't think Peter felt bad or he's like that or you might have felt bad but he didn't question Jesus a man because Jesus but Jesus knew it was a spirit on Peter a man and brother he could and God has been dealing with that all the way down through the ages because God has moved God has called them out but Satan is there tried to influence them amen and brother again it's after three years and practically every age after three years they went from the leadership of the Holy Ghost to the leadership of the devil that's right and we wanted to do they made an organization they made denominations they organized their churches they put themselves under the control of man and not the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen so the grace of God brother to with this understanding this revelation that all the way down through God has moved but then Satan comes behind and God allows it and God permits it a man and it's to breathe where God permits the negative what for it is to get us to sea serpents eat a man and gotten to bring a what bring out the positive in the seat of God amen it's bringing out the serpent seat is bringing out the negative but at the same time it's going to bring out the true seed of God the positive a man there are those who have a negative but there those have a positive they stay with the word they stay with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen so brother sister after all these years are we still staying with the truth that brought us out and we still stay with the truth that has kept us the truth that has taught us truth that has given us revelation understanding of God a man do we have the revelation we need of the of Satan and the understanding of Satan and what God does this God does that God did this and God did that and God is going to do this and God is going to do that a man but let's to understand Satan did this Satan did that and he deceived many they meant and he's doing the same thing today brother I'm not looking for the devil over there I'm not dealing with Satan over there indeed he was Satan around the word he's there to challenge your faith he's here to challenge your revelation is there to add to it is that or take from it amen brother and as it was in the days of Luther and Wesley all the emphasis they put on the word the word the word the word any man but Satan is there to weaken that dead emphasis or not not to take it away but just just not make it as important as what what we did I trust we do we got to make it all as important as we did personally come to this word this was important concerning God bringing the Prophet concerning the revelation of the mystery of God it's important a man but the enemy is there too to make it weaker oh yes he is oh well that's important yeah but but not as important as you think you can you can take this you can do that you can do that no God is doing is separating son to him brother and it and I told you if God wants to do anything in US and through us with us it's got to be a total separation to the Lord amen so we got no influence of the devil in our thoughts no influence of the devil in our words or our deeds a man but yet I met many a believer that Satan influences their thoughts their words and their deeds oh yeah why do they say that well that wasn't the Holy Ghost that was the devil a man why did they do this amen why are they thinking this it's not God it's the devil oh yeah he's there to bring the negative a man and to get do away with our faith or to weaken our faith a man God permits it God allows it to challenge RV a man and knowing that the challenge in strengthens our feet praise the Lord hallelujah so God promised he would do this with Israel for Israel but then he was warning them against the enemy and he said el from beneath his moved for thee to meet Liette thy coming and it stirs up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations and he said again in verse 10 all they that speaketh say unto thee are they'll also become weak as we are they'll become like unto us the pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of Avoyelles and the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee now we're getting into the power the anointing that's causing it Satan amen amen and he said our the fallen from it from heaven Oh Lucifer where'd he come from heaven oh yeah he was in heaven he was a covering cherub he walked up and down in the coals of fire and he took pride in what he was doing a man he took pride in the influence that he was having on the other angels a man and just think of the thousands of angels that followed him amen and he said I had fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning now either cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation's they read it says for thou has said in thy heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God Oh amazing he's proving himself - and he's become the god of this evil age he exalted himself above the stars of God and I was set also upon the Mount of the congregation in the size of the door and I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most I a man don't let him deceive you come on grace he said I will be like the Most High and yet thou shalt be brought down to hell a man that's where he's coming they may to the size of the pit and they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms and that was but it was he also got the worship of the people oh yeah they focused on him thinking they were focusing on Jehovah that's right and again God allows us to bring out the unbelief and he saw that and he said that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities there out that opened not the house of his prisoners a man God's grace blessings word to our hearts the understanding a man that God is giving concerning the devil where he Karim what he does and where he's going grace turn with me to 2nd Peter chapter 2 second Peter chapter 2 and they start again at verse one but there are a false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction do not acknowledging the truth the whole truth about the message of the hour and really want it what it means and what God has done oh they'll believe God sent a prophet and God opened the mystery of the seven seals and we believe this we believe that what brother there's more to it than that oh yes because it has to do with the coming of the Lord it has to do with the brought with the with the bridegroom coming to unite with the right a man the father was was preaching on the invisible union of the hurt of the earthly bride and they have any bridegroom sir brother we had to be on our guard a man and we had pray God give us revelation of what he's doing a man not what he's done old God did this God did that in William Branham it's true William Branham well what was God doing a man himself what about the presence of God what about the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ do we have the revelation of him or is it just the revelation of William Branham is it the revelation of malachi for a man but we got to go beyond that because why because malachi for which they introduced jesus a man because john introduced jesus bo the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and now in this hour in this age did the malachi for for this day brother because why john was turning the fathers to the children now in this hour the Malachi 4 is turning the children back to the father's a man that's right because why the the Jewish fathers they they had to be turned to the pentecostal children now the pentecostal father says the worst their arts can be turned back to their children a man so that we're going to go back as it started in the beginning take away all that's been added to it and you'll stay with the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth ain't bad but that's what God has done in this hour in this age he has come down a man it is the coming of the Lord for the bride praise the name of the Lord so let's believe that he is here and again brother as brother Brown said I know he said he said you can't see the other angel and he said he said he said I I'm not the son of man he said I'm only a son of man revealing the son of man and he was trying to get us to see him amen brother but too many just just saw a son of man but they didn't see the son of man they would see William Brennan but we let him do this we don't rent him did that and there was there was evangelist are there oh my they they love to have William Branham in their meetings they love to have will around the area they are there and so on why because of the gift that was there but again that wasn't William Branham it was Jesus as again let me say it again because brother BAM said a number of times no he's and I can't do this he said that season's so he said I got to get myself out of the way so he can come and do it any man and brother that was a ministry beyond Oral Roberts that was a minister beyond Wyndham right or not William Branham but beyond single Osburn or Billy Graham it was beyond all the other evangelists most definitely a man this was a ministry not not of a gift of eating a man there was a ministry of the son of man the Prophet not a gift of prophecy it was a prophet a man and God was revealing himself through the Prophet Christ was revealing himself through the prophets a man and to finally he took the prophet of the way so we put our attention on him a man he took Jesus he took John the Baptist off the scene so that the emphasis will be put on Jesus a man he was the one that he was he was the one John was pointing to a man so he took me talk with him bring him out to say and now he's plenty us to the Lord Jesus Christ our bridegroom amen because that's the one that he was pointing to a man but still the people are pointing to William Branham they're still talking about winning BAM they're still talking about this mystery in that mystery but they're not acknowledging Jesus direct Naurang brother you want to go into resurrection you want to be part of the right you got to acknowledge his presence amen not the presence of William Branham but the presence of Jesus a man that he's not coming he's calm he may it he has come and again because again the probably got elated concerning day mr. neither the the pub the pillar of fire and brother the pillar of fire wasn't william branham it was Christ a man and again the cloud of angels and again in 1965 he says see he said there he is he said in the cloud he said looking down at us because the Bible says he'll come the same way he went he was received up into glory in a cloud and he came back in a cloud a man praise the name of the Lord Baldwin brother we're looking at we're looking at we're going to cut out I meet Jesus in the air yes but he's here he's here and when we meet him in the air hallelujah the time with the resurrection the time of the rapture when that goes to take place he's going to incarnate in the body called Jesus and he'll be right there then we'll go up to meet him in that body well right now we're dealing with Jesus in the cloud of angels and in the pillar of fire amen it's Christ reveal himself to his bride a man and only the bride's gonna recognize it a man only the bride was truly recognized Christ 2000 years ago others all they saw was signs and wonders oh yeah yeah again brother oh yeah because Jesus when he left and he went over on the other side of the ocean to see and so on and the people who all came over there with him and he said why did you come far as they come because they recognized the Son of Man no he said no he said because he should because of the miracle he said I I did this with the with the bread and the fish and he said I fed 5,000 and he should you come again because they wanted something natural amen and they came to win a run and they came to his ministry they came to his marriage why because they wanted healing they wanted God to do this one of God to do that and I tell you in in or Roberts ministry it was healing until Osborne's ministry was healing a many many other evangelists a man I held over them for all their names now but as I said I experienced those ministries and so on and brother they wanted this they wanted that just alright we'll pray for you and you'll be healed yelling god alone but it was this ministry was different Oh at William Branham it was absolutely different he was discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart a male he was doing what Jesus did in his first coming now I was doing it in the second coming and again it wasn't William Branham it was Jesus amen so grace of God brother that were will let but we know been stayin Laurie stay in the other dimension but we're gonna worship Jesus amen and Jesus is going to take us back there by grace God elbows a man that we're going to recognize the God there Jehovah of this age a man not the God of the evil age we're going to surge over and not the God of the evil age but as too many serving the god of this evil age they made they're under Satan's evil it's a man in their thoughts and their words and their deeds amen oh yeah I'm not saying that they're not talking word yeah but it's under Satan's influence they're saying what Satan is saying you're doing what Satan wants them to do amen they're responding the way that Satan wants them to respond oh yeah and then and again it's it's been religious but not spiritual and some are very very religious like I said I witnessed that over the years very very religious people but today no no they're just they're no more no better than the people out there in denominations you know what you know why they feel good they feel oh I'm in the message no you're not oh yeah you're in the message message is not in them and it's not there's many a believer out there and the message is not in them no I pray grace that will make our calling election sure make sure that the message is in us amen and the life we live is the message we are going to speak the message we're going to amen we're going to do we're gonna think the message amen by the grace of God you think it speak it do it by the grace of God don't let the devil be there to pervert it to add to it grace so again a second Peter he said there were false prophecies and also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you and there are false teachers as I said be careful when you go on the internet you better be careful oh this is a good preacher pastor on the internet he's good he's good he's good no be careful because most I'll tell you this most most are gonna be false teachers oh well they're gonna do gonna say this much message but then they're gonna have a little negative here oh yeah they'll take away or your headstone they shouldn't had oh yeah they'll leave this impression they'll leave that impression amen brother I pray grace be on your guard make your election sure you're calling sure so he said it buddy there shall be false teachers among you who primary shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction to deny the full revelation of Jesus Christ to deny what Christ has done but to deny what he's doing and many shall follow they're been a pernicious ways and by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of old brother god help us we're not going to leave the wrong impression regarding the message you know oh oh you're you represent that message do you yeah oh I pray grace is your life measures up with the message yours too your words your deeds your thoughts are in line with the message you're not going to read to leave the wrong impression of the message to those that you know family friends or neighbors grace and it says although covetousness shall they through covetousness they shall with with being words make merchandise of you whose judgment now the long time lingers not and their damnation slumbereth not for if God spared not the Angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of Darkness to be reserved unto judgement and spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overflow and making them examples under those that should live ungodly and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked but he delivered him oh yeah there's a name Brent but there's also a lot God had mercy on us not experience the power of God Abram experienced the power of God but God was going to do more through Abraham than he did through lot and brother and because of lot sin and because of the sin of one son God just got completely wiped that son out and his seed he knew what was in him oh yeah again God knew what was in in in Noah son and he was in his son's heart he knew what was in his children's heart and so on again it's like like someone has questioned us and questioned the Prophet - concerning the destruction of the Amalekites and so on organically demon saw a guy go in and destroy them all even the children even though even the babies and the mothers what we'd better have a revelation of God destroyed the mothers and the babies yes and they said to brother Branham they said brother Brown why would God do that he said because they were growing the mellah kites and was in their heart yeah even though they were babies God knew that when they grew up they be anti-israel they'd be against the Israel to be against the Lord God help us brother David told him they will completely be under Satan's influence that's right god help us and he said he delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing and vixx's righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under the day of judgment to be punished grace that were ordained to redemption not punishment hallelujah basically them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they self self-willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities you know where is the humility of the word they profess to believe where is the humility of the gospel they profess to believe brother serpent seat yes not afraid to speak evil of dignities be careful keep your spirit right you know be careful when you speak when you say this or say that you make sure it's the Lord Amen do it by the word stay with the word and he said we're as angels which are greater in power and might bring not rating accusation against them before the Lord amazing but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed he says speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption grace to us and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that counted pleasure to write in the daytime spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceiving z-- while they feast with you yeah Jared entered there with the believers they feast with you there they're doing this they're doing that but they're under Satan's influence yeah nuts nut seed of God is to see to the serpent serpent see my lord my lord have mercy on us and it says having eyes full of adultery and there cannot see cease from sin and be guarding unstable Souls and our day of may they have exercised with covetous nosov it just practices cursed children amazing if they're cursed children they're under the god of this evil age he's too rich I've forsaken the right way and gone astray following the way of balaam a man oh yeah that could take another hour and talk about Balaam and what he experienced oh yeah oh yeah was he was he in with the Lord oh yeah God dealt with him and he dealt with God God talked to him he talked to God but he was seeking his own will not the will of God amen he was seeking permission will not the perfect will oh yeah and there's many a believer they want to do what they want to do not what God wants them to do yeah they want they want they're at their will but not God's will they want permissive will more than they want perfect will and there's many are living by permissive will of God in their everyday living but they're gonna be left out they're not part of the right I'm not saying they're gonna be lost but again they may be oh yes good God said right here are you gonna go to hell god help us they're cursed children and he said which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam that's what he was leading Israel to do and he did yeah yeah is he was a prophet but yeah he was under more under the anointing and influence of Satan than he was God though he was he was a prophet and he what did he do he influenced the Israel the way he preached the revelation that he had he influenced Israel to quote and mingle and intermarry with those that God told him not to get mixed with a man there's many today even believers that are intermarrying and getting mixed up with those that God don't want you to get mixed up with god have mercy it's gonna get worse and worse and worse as I said as Jesus said that he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved that's how bad it's going to get a man and what deceived a very elective possible be on your guard again make your calling sure make your election sure amen so that you're you're living according to the word your thoughts your words your deeds are influenced by the Holy Ghost through the word a man God had mercy on us again they have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of mozar who loved the wages of unrighteousness Oh uh-oh he was going to get this favor he got the favor of this leader of that leader he got the favor of the Kings he got the favor of this one and that one yeah God had mercy and he compromised on the work he did they gone in the way of balaam or the error of balaam you know and there's many at going after the error of this preacher or that preacher another preacher stay it's the truth I don't care how good that person can preach and so on all this good good good yeah you better be good yeah you better be good yeah according to the word don't add to it don't take from it all I know people but under the influence of this preacher that preacher that preacher and brother they're not following the messages following the preacher and that Satan's influence my God have mercy yeah Balaam he says for say forsaken the right way and gone astray following the way of balaam who loved the wages of unrighteousness but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumbass speaking with the man's voice forbade the madness of the Prophet amazing God's got it God's got to take the least of preachers to correct us oh yeah not the Greek one this one that one he's kneeling and famous no no you take the ones at least least honored yeah afford to correct his sons and daughters what is it why because God is ministering in humility to produce humility a man not oh oh not lift you up get your lift up you're here oh oh you and make you proud no humble yourself a man I'll be yourself by the grace of God turn with me to Revelation chapter 2 not necessarily preaching but teaching and in Revelation chapter 2 and verse 12 and on to the Angel of the Church of Pergamos write these things saith he which has the sharp sword with two edges I know thy works where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is amazing and the holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth amazing but I have a few things against thee because thou as their them that old the doctrine of Balaam again yo permissive will not perfect will yet Balaam was a prophet yeah I mazing he was a prophet and as the enemy influenced the prophecy and he influences some of the fivefold ministry today make your call and election sure bring it back to the Word of God by the grace of God so again and again it is I not not going to read it but again I believe he mentions Balaam again in the book of Jude warning the people you know absolutely amazing see again and what I want to get across is that is so close it would deceive the very elect if possible that's gonna put you on your guard a man that's gonna make you to make sure that you make your calling and election sure I have a few things against thee because thou has there them that oh the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so as though also them that oh the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which I also hate what is it it's the god of this evil age forcing them down through the ages a man not not denying the word not to deny the truth not to deny the message but to add to it take from it amen he's done it right from the beginning and brother even more so now in this hour in this hour in this hour in this aged is worse because why because the god of this evil age has deceived the people so much and he influences their thoughts words indeed so much in the churches that they put Christ out they didn't want the thoughts of Christ they didn't want the words of Christ or the deeds of Christ no no oh we're just being religious and just do this just do that we believe these mysteries no there's a life that you live to reflect the message amen and deliver sorry ideas just theirs even believers that they're reflecting in a certain life showing the influence of Satan that's true as I've said I know I've met a lot of people a lot of believers over the years I mean the message I'm in the message I'm in the message but I got it I've got to confess that the message wasn't and isn't in them thank God that brother BAM highlighted that I believe in this message called this evil age he said you're in the message but the message is not in you he was seeing that over fifty years ago what are we seeing today make sure the message is in you it's a message is in you Jesus is in you God is in you amen and you're going to add the thoughts of God the words of God and the deeds of God amen lord grace that were going to be like Abraham a man but not like baleine Grise Amazing Grace there's another couple of scriptures Deuteronomy chapter 6 the book of Deuteronomy chapter 6 and beginning read in verse 4 here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children be diligent in the way you raise your child be diligent in the way that you teach their child amen and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou rises up he meant the word the word the word the word brother it was a time when when we met believers we talked about the word the word the word if we met on the street it's the word if we meant or just somewhere else in a store the word oh yeah no matter where we were admit we just couldn't get away from the word word was talking to word and we talked about the words oh yeah praise the name of the Lord but today believers are believers just like in denominations yeah so you you might talk about it when you go to church yeah you might talk about it when you do this when you do that but it's not like it used to be no Amen sister not like it used to be God have mercy on us glad to beyond a phone conversation where brother Bob yesterday I believe it was and talked about the word talk with Lord anybody talk with the revelation the revelation this the revelation that to God be the glory a man why that that's it's reflecting your faith faith comes by hearing the word Amen brother and what God has done through the opening of the word is to give a speech and you got faith where the Bible says that those in the in the early church today about are in the Pentecostal age they're the first stage oh my they went from house to house to house and that fellowship and talked about the word serve communion or did this or did that it was all the word the heard the word Amen brother they had to spirited the revival and the bride's got the spirit of the bride revival so brother you can't talk about anything else or the word you can start talking about this but it goes to the word you might go over to this and go back to the word any man because no matter what's going on we know it's the word it's prophecy being fulfilled amen amen even concern he was going on now bring us back to the word Lord you told us that when all this happens look up help us Lord yeah we're not just going to focus on the net under- we'll focus on the positive the world is focusing on the negative but the bride is focusing on the positive a man when you see this look up it didn't say to go look at that go focus on that go focus on that oh yeah you can you can study see study it and see what's going on and I was going on I've heard it is but don't get caught up with it come back and say thank you Jesus that's wonderful Lord why you can look at it you can hear it you can see it but don't just focus on the focus on it no say oh lord thank you lord although I know that's your word Lord if you're doing this you're doing this you're allowing this you're allowing that and yeah when you see this happening that happening is that oil Lord I know Lord that's more and more it's proving that the prophecy is being fulfilled yeah and as I said before that the people are not spiritual very few that are spiritual thank God for the further for those that are there's not many of all that I've heard since this has been going on I would say there's only two or three spiritual and I say thank God for oh I think he's the Prime Minister premiere of a certain province and he talks and he talks and he talks and when he moves away you say God bless you and move on he come back and talk again and after he finishes saying what he says well god bless you and move on I saw the Lord I said he must have a spiritual attitude that he doesn't forget to say god bless you and the others just talk and watch just talk go on talk and go on you know but he he'll always be still God's blessing it so brother somewhere he submitted for spiritual eyes he is and there's also again again did that young couple as I said and and the husband is sake and they were as I said they were visiting I think over there in the Asia somewhere and they came back and he was sick but they were given God the glory thank you Jesus and as I said when they were when they were bringing the conversation to a close there they're gonna said that's it thank you oh just one minute she said I just want to say this and she want to talk with the Lord yeah and give the glory to Jesus she we're praying that the Lord Jesus be with us we're paying Jesus is going to help us oh yeah I said Lord bless her amen and bless her husband who was it was it was a cocaine yes he said that's it is God he said we're putting it all in the hands of God good that's well as all that we've heard it's only as I said two or three spiritual how spiritual are you spiritually are we do we do we all do we have a spiritual mind no matter what you're going to you're experiencing no matter what you experienced this you experienced that all this might test you this might test you that might be testing you but are you spiritual grace I was going to think spiritual experi to talk spiritual no matter what you're going through are you going to talk to the Lord about it amen god help us again Deuteronomy 6 Star Wars 4 again here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might do you love the Lord with all your heart do you love the Lord with all your soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up a man you can't get away from the word and I shall bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and they're also thou shalt write them upon the posts of the house and on thy gates and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought the end of the land he said which he sware unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou build us not and the house is full of all good things which thou Phyllis not and not and Wells dig which thou dig us not vineyards and olive trees with the plan is not when thou shalt have eaten and be full he said then beware lest thou forget the Lord don't get so caught up in it did you forget the Lord that's right brother but many a ring is so good but they all they if they were serious they would consult the Lord they would really be thankful to them thank you Jesus thank you Lord no matter what the blessing is you don't just take it for granted and go on no you say Lord thank you yeah but they were blessed but they forgot the Lord that blessed them and it says beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought the body forth out of the land of Egypt and from the house of bondage and thou shalt fear the Lord thy God and serve him and shall swear by his name and ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are round about you for the Lord thy God is a jealous god among you but there under the influence of the god of this evil age they under the influence not of Jehovah but of the devil amen though God bless them they forgot God the grace of God be with us let's go to another scripture here Luke chapter 4 amen amazing new chapter for this not be ignorant of the word and verse one and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil did we consider that we're tempted by the devil brother sister we need to get the victory constantly because there's not a day that goes by but Satan is there to tempt you he was there to tempt Jesus he's there to tempt you and me a man and sometimes the way that he tempted Jesus he's there to tempt you and me yeah he was tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward a hungered amazing and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone did it be made bread Satan works on our weaknesses oh yes he does to try to get us to do this and do that o do this - no get to behind me Satan and Jesus was getting weak because he was getting hungry after 40 days if you're on a on a fast and you don't eat after 40 days after three or four days the hunger is gone after 40 days it returns you know and Jesus felt hungry and the devil was there to tempt him oh if you're this one if you're God if you're the Son of God command that this stone that be made bread what force will eat it and sometimes the devil is going to tempt us do this do this do this because you need this you need this get away Satan I'll do without it amen god help us we're gonna have the attitude Jesus in the spirit that Jesus a and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God a man shall not live by money alone no it's your faith in God hey man oh I want this and I want this I want this assurance I want this guarantee forget it serve the Lord amen that's right thank God because God has dealt with many one down through the ages for yeah oh but didn't God bless him with this blessing with that Saamy did somebody didn't that's right because no not everybody can handle it that's right some can handle it can supply but the Bible says that and others can't why some control it others it controls them yeah so let's make sure that we're in control no matter what's going on in your life you're in control amen and the control that you have over it is governed by the word and the power of the Holy Ghost it's not you lives crisis living in you he's controlling all these things amen and he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in in a moment of time what power Satan got be careful there's again why the Bible says Jesus said they'll show signs and wonders well he showed Jesus signs and wonders he took Jesus up into a mountain he took him to the top of the temple he shortened this he showed him that yeah tempting Jesus so don't don't be tempted by signs and wonders no make sure it's the word amen the devil took him up into a high mountain and showed onto him and they all the kingdoms of the world yeah I just think showed him all the kings of the world in a moment of time so be on your guard cuz Satan got power too well you can do this and he can do that make sure it's God stay with the word and the prophet of God brings out in the end a message on the seven churches they preach in 1954 just one message and he brings out about the messenger to the seventh to the third church age a brother named Saint Martin yeah he was he was he was Catholic but he came out and he went to the word stayed with the word he had signs and wonders it was absolutely amazing at the ministry that he had oh yeah and and one point there he was sitting down he was doing this to it and he turned over all what's said there he saw this man rise up but a crown on his aide and he said Martin don't you know me I'm Jesus worship me and say Martin looked at him and he says he's funny no and again the man said look please worship me bow down before me I'm the Lord Jesus Christ I redeem you all the sudden is struck st. Martin he said get thee behind me Satan he said you're not Jesus he said you got a crown on your head and he said according to the Bible he said the Saints will crown him at the end of the ages he said he doesn't have a crown yet so he said get it get out of here and he disappeared oh yeah how many will be deceived because all I had this vision I saw this and I saw that but was it scriptural because the day that the devil can give you a vision the devil can show him something supernatural that's right he was showing Jesus all and he showed Martin st. Martin that oh yeah don't be deceived praise the Lord hallelujah and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will I give it if thou wilt therefore will worship me all shall be dying worship the devil they didn't become God to Jesus that Jesus worshiped the devil no way oh yeah sometimes the devil is doing a lot of things to even believers out there and they're worshiping him thinking they're worshiping God and they're worshiping the devil that God of this evil age grace and he said that therefore they will worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve amen and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from it's for his written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus answering said unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God amen praise the Lord don't you tempt God at the same time Satan shouldn't be tempting God he was when he was tempting Jesus he was God he was trying to tempt God to do this and do this do that did we get to behind me Satan thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and when the devil ended all the temptation he departed from him not forever but for a season amen as Satan is still there tempting now grace to us brother that we not be deceived amen there's a couple other scriptures or two or three others curses I had here but let me show you with a couple of boats and then we'll we'll have to dismiss or change the order god bless you again and the god of this evil age it's amazing we think of God we only think of Jehovah thing of God we want to think of Jesus but God through the prophet of the hour through the message of the hour has warned us that Satan is also a God you know he becomes a god to the people amen and he's worship as I should shared the quote with you two or three times where the prophet of God said he's me Satan is worshipped by millions and billions of people and he is Satan has been worshiped down through the ages for thick or 5,000 years and he's been is being worshipped in this last stage jesus said as it was in the days of Noah wherein eight souls were saved so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man and in the days of lot where 3:3 was brought out of Sodom now there's already a group he said already out but as it was then when the Son of Man will be manifested look hard and look where we are living now and brother Brown did say listen he said I know what you're thinking he said that I'm covering a lot of territory we're covering a lot of Scripture yeah and more willing I'm covering a lot of territory and in the met in the Ministry of this message the godless evil age he said you say he said you're covering a lot of territory and he was he was going right back to eternity coming down through time and eventually go back to eternity to show us the god of this evil age the devil to show us the power and the influence the Satan has got on the people he's not out there trying to deceive the sinners they're already deceived their serpent seed but he's right here trying to deceive the seed of God yeah so he said look hard he should look where we are living they meant when it comes to this past week what power what anointing has influenced you in what you have done and what you're doing what power has influenced you in your thoughts your words and your deeds was it God or was it the devil did you deal with the devil are you conscious of that Saint Martin he was very conscious of Satan I'll tell you there's very few ministries like Saint Martin not many he had an absolutely powerful ministry and he stayed with the word he encouraged people stay with the word yeah so brother the grace of God be with us because the god of this evil age is influencing men women and young people to live to dress to act like the world and still think that they are Christians and many believers got his soul out to Satan not denying the message say more deny it he knows it was God but he's going to get you to compromise on certain things that the Prophet said grace of God to us amen he said notice the sons of God saw the daughters of men not the daughters of God the daughters of men that they were beautiful and it caused the sons of God to fall into this delusion and they took them kind of women and married them and it brought a haze of prostitution just like it is today he's like it was in Sullivan and he said like you predicted to be today yeah as it was in that day so it is in this day and he highlighted it in another way insane why was it then he said it is now he said there's a lot of common law relationships and there is it's getting worse you know marriages is becoming a historical thing ancient oh yeah it is more and more getting involved with common-law relationships he's that's the sign of the end and what and whose influences it is the god of this evil age Satan brother the world is under the control of a power the world's under control than anointing and it's not Almighty God it's not Jehovah it's the devil that's right and they are worshiping him all right they want to worship Him you know because why because of the compromise because they can believe this and believe that and still do this and still do that and not be convicted whereas if God is in control Joel was in control you're gonna be convicted you'll convict you if it's your thought is a word or deed no matter what it is he'll convict you that's not according to his will cause grace and he says it is predicted to me today that when man and women of this day swap wives and if they don't like this way they go over to the Nevada and get married and get a divorce that one and marry again and he said in women so pretty that they're almost irresistible and what is it the devil Satan is still in Beauty and notice the sin was never forgiven them and he said that pretty scientific age was very evil age that God destroyed off the face of the earth and he said that pretty scientific age and he said Jesus said it'll be that way again before the coming of the Son of Man and as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man when they all tried to be in - to marry watch the sons of God married the pretty daughters of man God never did forgive them God destroyed it all he meant why because they had turned themselves over to Satan's influence a man and God is going to destroy the world again he destroyed it by by water he's going to destroy it by fire and the fire is falling why because man has given themselves over to Satan's influence they made the god of this evil age God never did forgive them just the same as bailiffs teaching that he caused pretty intellectual scientific women he saw with their flirty eyes and their paints and powders their perfumes easy to entice the sons of God against their own women that worked and had calluses in their hands with no makeup entice them over let us marry one another because we're all the same people he said that was a lie it was a lie and Ana treatment of the devil to get the sons of God to marry the daughters of man yeah there's an intermingling and it's amazing believers that are caught up with those things I know there's a lot of believers caught up with with those things you know there I saw yes it's getting worse but they're not gonna listen to me definitely not they're gonna do what they want to do because they still believe they're believers they still believe they're Christians you know oh oh well I'm good good good for what as my father said you're good or good for nothing yeah so the people think they're good because I didn't do this I didn't do that I didn't do that yeah but did you do anything contrary to God's will God have mercy here with me he says Satan enticed them what let us marry one another because we're all the same people that was a lie it was the lie and an achievement of the devil to get the sons of God to marry the daughters of man it was the lie of the devil for Balaam that that false prophet to try to prophesy against Moses that tried to hold the race together and say well we believe the same God we offer the same offerings we had the same sacrifices we do everything just alike so close that they would deceive the elect if possible and come away from her people come away he said have nothing to do with her grace he said God is not foolish and he's the source of all wisdom so you see where that stuff come from it come from Satan and it's still Satan the church has believed it amen he said you women you see I'm trying my best to show you the word amen God's grace I'll finish with this quote here we still haven't finished the message he says Satan the god of this age by his knowledge giving people to eat from his mixed tree of good and evil and as I said the Internet is a tree of knowledge of good and evil and Satan is giving the people food to eat from the mixed tree of the knowledge of good and evil he's mixing it he says Satan by his knowledge causing the people of this evil age to eat from his tree and he says that he's building a greater Christian civilization by his knowledge of good and evil but Christ's little virgin Christ's word flock bride don't care for it Satan's knowledge she keeps free of him what is it she stays with the word the bride is going to stay with the word amen sort of right so as believers we're going to stay with the word by the race of Almighty God amen and not just saying I'm staying with the word we're we're not going to take the devil's revelation of it we're gonna stay with God's revelation of the word not the devil's brother Bram says our attitude towards Christ and His Word will determine our eternal destination exactly so I prayed we got a right attitude toward the word right attitude toward the message of the hour a right attitude toward God God is revealing to us in these last days brother it's not oh I want God to do this I want God to do that no brother we want God to do what he wants to do we want God to help us to do what he wants us to do what is God's will for your life amen the grace of God nism we need to get into that revelation especially in this hour because everything is changing find the will of God for your life stay in the will of God for your life amen and even if you've got to lay down your your soul lay down your life that's your soul but lay down your life for the gospel and really in a sense not we got to do it we're going to do it we've got we got to do it now we're gonna lay down our lives every day not what I want to do what God wants me to do yeah so lord I'm gonna I'm gonna
