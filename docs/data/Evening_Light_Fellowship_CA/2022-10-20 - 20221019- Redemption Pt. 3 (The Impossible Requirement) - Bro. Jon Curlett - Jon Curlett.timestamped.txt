[33:23] [Music]
[33:25] Lord we have an assurance
[33:28] Lord that no matter what tomorrow brings
[33:31] or what is even beyond that Lord
[33:34] but we're not to worry about it
[33:36] if I were to take it one day at a time
[33:39] or it's efficient to the evil is the day
[33:41] thereof
[33:43] what your scripture says that he shall
[33:44] not be afraid of evil Tidings for his
[33:47] heart is fixed trusting in the Lord
[33:50] and Lord we're trusting this evening
[33:52] Lord that Lord you'll be with us
[33:55] Lord and when we have a good day we can
[33:57] praise you
[33:58] Lord and when we have a bad day we can
[34:00] praise you because you said that you
[34:02] work all things together for the good
[34:04] for them who are thee called according
[34:06] to your purpose Lord God so we're
[34:08] resting in that tonight Heavenly Father
[34:10] Lord just praying that you have Minister
[34:12] through your word this evening Lord that
[34:14] the Deep would call to the Deep
[34:17] or that it would resonate within us or
[34:19] that it would draw us closer to you we
[34:21] pray Lord just be with us now we ask in
[34:24] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[34:27] and then God bless you this evening if
[34:28] you'll turn your Bibles to Revelation
[34:29] chapter 5.
[34:32] Revelation chapter five I feel like this
[34:35] is going to be a bit of a brother Mark
[34:36] coffee style of of service here today
[34:38] it's more of a Bible study maybe as
[34:40] we're going through Redemption and I was
[34:42] Blanca's home sick this evening she's
[34:44] been sick for a couple days so she
[34:46] stayed home with Samuel and Jensen so
[34:48] remember them and my mom's traveling
[34:50] home this week as well on Friday so I
[34:52] want to remember her but I was saying
[34:54] this is one of those Services you don't
[34:55] really want to preach because when you
[34:57] talk about Redemption uh so often we're
[34:59] caught up in what he is and the good
[35:01] things he's done but to really
[35:02] understand Redemption you've got to
[35:04] understand where you are when you start
[35:05] this process and today we're going to
[35:08] talk a bit about what we are without him
[35:10] amen and so that's maybe not the most
[35:11] beautiful thing to to preach on but
[35:13] you've got to understand that so you
[35:15] understand the need for a redeemer
[35:16] because if you think that you're good if
[35:18] you think that you're great if you think
[35:19] you're okay if you think you're
[35:20] acceptable then all these things then
[35:22] then you don't need a redeemer and then
[35:24] you don't need Christ you don't need the
[35:26] word you don't need any of these things
[35:27] so tonight we'll dig in a bit into that
[35:29] and uh so so don't don't don't worry
[35:31] we're gonna we're gonna settle on a high
[35:33] note Lord willing remember we're going
[35:35] to talk about what it means to be a
[35:36] human these days without God and what it
[35:38] looks like in the in this the standard
[35:40] that God sets and how impossible it is
[35:42] for us to meet those things amen so
[35:44] we'll start in Revelations chapter 5
[35:45] verse one and this is John talking he
[35:48] says and I saw in the right hand of him
[35:49] that sat on the throne a book written
[35:52] within and on the backside sealed with
[35:54] Seven Seals now brother Brahm says this
[35:56] is the Lamb's Book of Life he says this
[35:58] is the title deed of our Redemption amen
[36:01] so whoever can read it is the one that
[36:02] owns it
[36:04] right and the scripture says that I saw
[36:07] a strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[36:09] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[36:12] to loose the seals thereof and no man in
[36:15] Heaven Nor an earth nor under the Earth
[36:17] was able to open the book neither to
[36:19] look thereon and I wept much because no
[36:23] man was found worthy to open and to read
[36:25] the book neither to look thereon amen
[36:29] God bless his word you may be seated
[36:31] this evening as I mentioned we're going
[36:33] to continue in our series on Redemption
[36:34] and I want to take a title this evening
[36:36] of the impossible requirement Amen in
[36:39] the last couple of services we talked
[36:40] about in the beginning and we talked
[36:42] about it for the Jews and we talked
[36:43] about it for the Gentiles and we showed
[36:45] our perfect existence in Eden when we
[36:47] are in the form of Adam and he was male
[36:49] and female in the same body and it was
[36:51] under the same mind and it was
[36:53] completely unimpeachable Satan couldn't
[36:55] touch him couldn't touch her it was it
[36:57] was in a perfect State and then we saw
[36:59] how the woman by way of a creative body
[37:01] the body was a byproduct and in there it
[37:03] allowed a division vision of the
[37:05] attributes that allowed a division of
[37:06] the minds and all of a sudden Satan saw
[37:08] a in the armor and he got that
[37:10] woman away and the husband didn't cleave
[37:12] to her and she didn't cleave to her
[37:13] husband and all of a sudden Satan got in
[37:15] there and he took that and he he used
[37:18] that to his advantage and in the end he
[37:19] seduced her and he caused her to fall
[37:21] and then she went to Adam and Adam
[37:23] brother bam says taking him quickly to
[37:25] her quickly to himself he said he what
[37:27] joined himself to her because God
[37:29] couldn't wouldn't kill them both amen so
[37:31] he saved her life but in doing so he
[37:34] joined himself with his wife and sin and
[37:36] and he condemned all of us and then he
[37:38] condemned all of us when he did that and
[37:40] back in the beginning we had eternal
[37:42] life that meant we had perfect health
[37:44] The Men We had perfect rest we were
[37:46] healthy at all times we did not age we
[37:48] did not wear out we did not tire and
[37:50] then we didn't need a medicines we
[37:52] didn't need all any of these things amen
[37:54] we did not weaken with time we were
[37:56] effortlessly alive back then all we knew
[37:58] was life life and more life amen
[38:00] scripture says he he says he comes that
[38:02] we would have life and more abundantly
[38:04] late well they had life more abundantly
[38:06] back then if you're looking for life
[38:07] more abundantly this was the definition
[38:09] of more abundantly remember as soon as
[38:12] we lost eternal life what happened we
[38:13] lost we lost that that Health we
[38:16] sickness came in there and we lost that
[38:18] rest and now we have worry and we had
[38:20] stress and our muscles tired and our
[38:21] joints gave out and we got shorter as we
[38:24] got older and we lost that Speed and
[38:25] Agility and and all the things as we
[38:27] grew and we aged and so we'd started a
[38:30] small you know in a small size and we'd
[38:32] peek and we'd grow maybe into our
[38:33] mid-20s back then maybe they peaked at
[38:35] the age of three or four hundred later
[38:37] on you know but in our days you you peek
[38:39] at about 20 or 25 years old and then you
[38:41] start to drop off and there's a slow
[38:42] Decay until the day that you die they
[38:45] didn't have that in the beginning in the
[38:47] beginning they had Dominion they were
[38:49] the Apex you know today we talk about an
[38:51] apex predator in the oceans it would be
[38:53] a an orca in the on the land it would be
[38:55] a polar bear a grizzly bear you know
[38:57] nothing can touch them and in the
[38:59] original World Satan's were the apex
[39:00] predators and not that we killed but
[39:02] nothing could touch us and the thing is
[39:03] nothing wanted to touch us everything
[39:05] was in harmony everything was was in in
[39:08] unity and and everything was for each
[39:11] other's good
[39:12] so there was no conflict there was no
[39:14] need for conflict because nobody needed
[39:16] to hurt something else in order to get
[39:17] what they needed they didn't eat flash
[39:19] back then everything ate vegetation and
[39:21] whatnot so there was no predation of
[39:23] things that were alive and whatnot amen
[39:25] and amen had an intelligence that was
[39:27] used for good because the Earth was in
[39:29] chaos and and God gave him spoken word
[39:32] authority and he gave them the
[39:33] intelligence to use it so that he could
[39:35] do what bring the Earth in out of chaos
[39:37] and into order and he was there to calm
[39:40] all things because we know that the
[39:41] Earth was in a mess it was in confusion
[39:43] and he had to bring it into an order
[39:45] that would help the Earth to grow and
[39:46] mature and to benefit from man living on
[39:49] it so all of these things were in a
[39:51] perfect Unity before this and then we
[39:53] lost dominion and what happened it was
[39:55] every man every woman every animal Every
[39:57] Creature for itself and all of a sudden
[39:59] they had to start feeding on each other
[40:00] and you had to take something down in
[40:03] order to raise yourself up right and if
[40:05] you didn't do that then you died and
[40:07] then all of a sudden it took a tumble
[40:09] and you lost spoken word authority and
[40:10] what happened when that when we all set
[40:12] the world went back into chaos didn't it
[40:14] and we see it today because the Earth is
[40:16] groaning and and travailing for what the
[40:19] manifestation of the sons of God because
[40:21] it's out of kilter and then it's out of
[40:23] its order it's into chaos and so it's
[40:25] waiting for us to come back into that
[40:27] time and we're not going to have it in
[40:28] time we'll have it in the Millennium and
[40:30] then even beyond that perhaps but we
[40:32] don't get it in this time this is not
[40:33] the time for that sort of sort of spoken
[40:35] word Authority because it's going to be
[40:37] cleansed by fire amen the same thing
[40:38] more cleansed by is the same thing that
[40:40] it's going to be cleansed by brother
[40:42] Brown and put it this way he says a man
[40:43] was made to be God did you know that
[40:45] he's in the image of God he's the son of
[40:48] God he's like him he was given a domain
[40:50] domain over the whole earth he Ruled the
[40:53] Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and
[40:54] all the other kingdoms all but the
[40:56] kingdom of God above he was God he was
[40:59] an amateur God he was made in the image
[41:01] of God made like God had hands and feet
[41:04] like God he was in the image of God now
[41:06] what happened because he disbelieved
[41:08] God's word it sent him right back out to
[41:11] shift for himself
[41:13] and everything else is Shifting for
[41:14] itself as well now God's trying to bring
[41:17] him back this is what Redemption looks
[41:20] like he says and when you have faith and
[41:22] accept him my brother just let that
[41:25] little light begin to grow out taking
[41:27] all the roots of doubt and bitterness
[41:30] yielding yourself to the spirit then
[41:33] then you begin to become a son of become
[41:36] a Son of God or daughter of God begin to
[41:39] grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit
[41:42] begins to build his kingdom within you
[41:44] amen so this is what he's looking for is
[41:47] that little light to grow up and take
[41:48] out all the things that have been
[41:50] holding you back all the excuses you've
[41:52] had in your life and to rip those out
[41:54] and let the kingdom of God start to grow
[41:56] within you amen
[41:58] now what is it when he's talking about
[42:00] this he says when you're yielding
[42:01] yourself to the spirit that's fellowship
[42:03] with God and that's what we had in the
[42:05] beginning we had that beautiful
[42:06] Fellowship every day we had time with
[42:08] him and he come down in the cool of the
[42:10] evening and he'd talk to us and he'd
[42:11] fellowship with us and then brother Brad
[42:13] says he'd pull us up close and then he
[42:15] would stroke our brow and he'd lay us
[42:17] down to sleep and we'd go have a sweet
[42:19] rest and then wake up in the morning and
[42:21] do it over and over and over again we
[42:23] had that perfect fellowship with him but
[42:25] as soon as that Fellowship was broken
[42:27] what's the first thing that set in
[42:29] fear
[42:31] because all of a sudden now we were
[42:33] hiding from the presence of God rather
[42:35] than running to the presence of God it
[42:37] wasn't just fear It Was Fear of him and
[42:39] what came with that was shame because we
[42:41] knew who and what we were now and they
[42:44] knew that they were naked they knew that
[42:46] they had messed up and it caused a
[42:47] separation it caused a division in their
[42:50] fellowship and so they felt shame and
[42:51] disgrace for the first time amen they
[42:54] felt loneliness they felt incomplete
[42:56] when they left that Garden I guarantee
[42:58] you there was a longing for something
[43:00] that they used to have that they knew
[43:02] they couldn't get anymore amen they had
[43:04] been there and they lost it and that
[43:06] loss would have been so great honestly I
[43:08] don't know how Adam lived to be as old
[43:09] as he did any of you think grief would
[43:12] have just destroyed them to know the
[43:14] pain and and hurt that they had caused
[43:16] and then to have the loss of that
[43:18] Fellowship you had with almighty God
[43:20] every day right to have Christ come down
[43:23] and spend time with him day in and day
[43:25] out and now you don't have anything you
[43:27] can't hear the voice you can't you can't
[43:28] feel that sweetness that softness
[43:31] completely gone I don't know how they
[43:33] did it amen and what happened what they
[43:35] lost the true they lost the true love
[43:38] that was there and what replaced it was
[43:40] what the filth of love that is sensual
[43:43] right and that's what they had to go
[43:44] back to now now they couldn't have that
[43:47] love in its purest form but they were
[43:48] stuck with something that was at best a
[43:50] poor equivalence that had led them down
[43:52] this path in the first place
[43:54] right and they what now they were left
[43:56] the worst thing of all and that's they
[43:58] were left to the leading of their own
[43:59] minds and their bodies desires and
[44:01] that's where we stand today without the
[44:03] Holy Ghost is we're led by our own minds
[44:05] we're led by our own desires we're led
[44:06] by the things that we think are right
[44:08] and it never leads us any place good and
[44:10] all you have to do is look around us and
[44:12] you say well we have technology and and
[44:14] we we've made things better and now we
[44:16] can support we just crossed 8 billion
[44:17] people on the planet did you know that
[44:19] we can support eight billion people by
[44:21] technology today but guess what we're
[44:23] dying of more and more crazy things than
[44:25] we ever have
[44:26] right people have more and more mental
[44:28] disorders more and more stresses
[44:30] families are broken up right we're more
[44:32] beat up by the time we're 60 than I
[44:34] think we used to be because we've added
[44:36] so much that is destructive to us in all
[44:38] of the creative things that we've done
[44:40] it hasn't led us to a greater life it's
[44:42] just led us to a higher stress level
[44:44] he says in the Garden of Eden there were
[44:46] two trees one was knowledge and one was
[44:49] life and as long as men eat off the tree
[44:51] of life he had everlasting life the
[44:54] first bite he took from the Tree of
[44:56] knowledge he separated his Fellowship
[44:58] from God and every time he takes a bite
[45:01] yet he destroys himself
[45:03] he bit off gunpowder look what that does
[45:06] he bit off automobile off the tree of
[45:08] knowledge it kills more of his comrades
[45:09] than all the wars does he's got a
[45:11] hydrogen bomb bit off now I wonder what
[45:13] he's going to do with that God don't
[45:15] destroy nothing man destroys himself by
[45:19] knowledge
[45:21] that's what we're saying today they say
[45:22] it this is back in the early 2000s I
[45:24] think they said knowledge was doubling
[45:26] every six months I think we're up to
[45:28] about four months now where everything
[45:30] we know doubles can you imagine you
[45:33] can't keep up with it anymore there's no
[45:34] such thing as a subject matter expert
[45:35] anymore because there's too much to know
[45:37] you can't know it all you can only know
[45:39] the narrowest of narrowest of things
[45:40] these days and be an expert in those
[45:42] things because knowledge is increasing
[45:44] and it's supposed to
[45:46] scripture says the knowledge would
[45:47] increase and increase and increase and
[45:49] increase we're there we're there
[45:51] but I would say and when a man went off
[45:54] the tree of life to eat the tree of
[45:55] knowledge he always tried to figure
[45:57] things out from then on
[45:59] he never has got straightened out yet
[46:03] for all of that for 6 000 years of
[46:06] trying to straighten ourselves out we
[46:08] keep making the same mistakes over and
[46:10] over and over again we go around and
[46:13] around the mountain of our own leading
[46:14] and our own failures and we come to the
[46:16] same point in the same gate and we keep
[46:17] walking through it time and time again
[46:20] he says he never has got straightened
[46:22] out yet so we might as well go back to
[46:25] the tree of life and just believe is
[46:27] that right he's saying maybe you ought
[46:29] to give it something else a try Church
[46:32] now hopefully we've been doing this for
[46:34] at least the last 2000 years amen as
[46:36] Believers after the you know the day of
[46:38] Pentecost and these different things but
[46:39] he's saying leave your knowledge behind
[46:41] because it's not got man anywhere they
[46:43] just keep destroying themselves amen
[46:46] and we know that after this we were as
[46:48] lost as lost could be there was a
[46:50] flaming sword what is the sword always
[46:52] in the scripture it's the word of God
[46:54] and the word of God was a flaming sword
[46:56] it was the law of God and it was holding
[46:58] us back from his presence and it was
[47:00] holding us back from the Tree of Life
[47:02] which is Christ himself the word because
[47:04] he said the day that you eat thereof of
[47:06] the tree of knowledge the day you
[47:07] disobey is the day you die and God's
[47:10] word can well it has to hold us back
[47:12] right he can't disobey his word he can't
[47:14] say it and then say okay I understand it
[47:17] was okay no no the word had to hold us
[47:19] back because the word said the day you
[47:21] do it the day you die and what is death
[47:23] death is first and foremost separation
[47:26] from God Amen we look at death as when
[47:28] we lose the the breath of life and and
[47:30] that's true as well but the day you die
[47:32] is the day you're separated from God
[47:34] because that is the Tree of Life Christ
[47:36] is the Tree of Life the day you're
[47:37] separated from him you have no access
[47:39] you're going to die you're going to lose
[47:41] your breath but you've lost what life
[47:43] itself which is his presence amen and
[47:46] you and I never got a chance to prove
[47:47] ourselves did we Adam messed up and by
[47:50] Adam I mean the man and the woman
[47:51] combined they messed up it's their fault
[47:53] it's not our fault it's their fault if
[47:56] we get over on the other side we can go
[47:57] to them and say it's your fault we
[47:59] didn't get a chance to prove ourselves
[48:01] we're here because of Adam the scripture
[48:02] says it it says wherefore as by one man
[48:05] sin entered into the world and death by
[48:08] sin and so death passed upon all men for
[48:10] that all have sinned for until the law
[48:13] sin was in the world but sin is not
[48:15] imputed where there is no law the law is
[48:17] the only thing that can judge you and if
[48:19] there's no law then you can't sin
[48:21] but he says nevertheless death reigned
[48:23] from Adam to Moses so the law didn't
[48:25] come to Moses but he says nevertheless
[48:27] men kept dying
[48:29] why he says even over them that had not
[48:31] sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[48:33] transgression so even the ones that
[48:35] didn't do what Adam did he says they
[48:37] still died
[48:38] why who is the figure of them that were
[48:40] to come
[48:41] he's talking he says who is the fear of
[48:43] him that was to come he's foreshadowing
[48:45] a second Adam the last Adam that was
[48:47] going to come amen but why did we die
[48:49] even if Adam didn't even if we don't do
[48:50] what Adam did even if we're not guilty
[48:52] of that
[48:53] because our birth is wrong our birth is
[48:56] completely wrong and we'll get into that
[48:58] Lord willing in the next service or two
[48:59] Jesus had to come by a different birth
[49:01] and we've all got to come by the same
[49:02] birth that Jesus did which was what by
[49:04] the overshadowing of the holy spirit
[49:06] because that was the way it was supposed
[49:08] to happen in the first time it was
[49:09] supposed to be an overshadowing of the
[49:11] holy spirit that would bring a birth and
[49:13] then it wasn't supposed to be by sensual
[49:14] desire so they were in a wrong birth
[49:16] we're being born the wrong way and now
[49:18] we're not born by the spirit of God but
[49:20] we're born by the spirit of man we're
[49:22] born by the will of man and that's
[49:23] always going to be in the wrong
[49:25] so we're born in sin we we have that
[49:28] Saint says we're born in sin shaped at
[49:30] iniquity and come to the world speaking
[49:31] lies that's not a scripture but we say
[49:33] it because you can put three scriptures
[49:34] together and kind of make it that way
[49:35] but the law is what condemns us and yet
[49:38] even before that he says look we all
[49:40] died before that because our very nature
[49:42] that we're born under the very way we're
[49:44] born is sinful in and of itself
[49:46] so as soon as you're born you're a
[49:48] sinner
[49:49] you're lost you're falling you're not in
[49:52] the condition that you were supposed to
[49:53] be in the rev the original uh plan of
[49:55] God Amen
[49:57] but the simple fact is this when you're
[49:58] outside of the presence of God you can
[50:00] never be good
[50:02] because it's his righteousness it's the
[50:04] only one that's good amen our
[50:05] righteousness is his filthy rag so if
[50:07] we're looking to be good as God is good
[50:09] you've got to have God with you you've
[50:11] got to be in his presence that's the
[50:12] only thing that's going to keep you good
[50:14] so no matter who you are no matter who
[50:16] you're born to no matter what your
[50:17] family is no matter who your pastor is
[50:19] what church you're raised in the simple
[50:21] truth is you cannot please God you
[50:23] cannot meet the standard of God and you
[50:25] cannot be in the presence of God on your
[50:27] own Merit thinking or actions or
[50:29] bloodline you can't do it there's
[50:31] nothing that we can do that deserves us
[50:33] to be placed into his presence again
[50:35] the natural orders for things to decay
[50:39] that's the way it's funny how science
[50:40] will will put forward Evolution where
[50:42] things grow and increase and yet
[50:44] everything else decays but they've got
[50:46] one law one rule that goes opposite that
[50:48] and every other rule leads to decay
[50:50] but natural order is to Decay for us to
[50:53] get lower and lower and worse and worse
[50:55] as time goes on and that's what we see
[50:57] why because we're out of the presence of
[50:59] God Amen and even when we think we're
[51:01] gaining something valuable we're so
[51:03] short-sighted because we can't see the
[51:04] long-term effects of it and you look at
[51:06] everything from Electronics you look at
[51:08] everything from from media you look at
[51:10] everything from from Brother Brown says
[51:12] Automobiles and gunpowder it was a way
[51:14] to control it was a way to save and then
[51:16] it turned into a way to kill and then it
[51:18] started killing everything and hurting
[51:19] everything and all of a sudden the thing
[51:21] that you think is so great is the thing
[51:22] that's destroying you you look at the
[51:24] pollution problems we have now
[51:25] Automobiles and internal combustion
[51:27] engines and all these things they've
[51:29] revolutionized the way we live guess
[51:31] what we can have bananas in Newfoundland
[51:33] in February because of that
[51:35] but at what cost
[51:37] at what cost see we never see we never
[51:39] see the big picture and God sees it all
[51:41] and he's allowed it because it's going
[51:42] to bring destruction on the earth amen
[51:45] the ultimate effect of everything we do
[51:47] is that it destroys us that's what the
[51:48] prophet of God saying brother Paul
[51:50] afontaine said something a while ago and
[51:51] I believe it because it's backed up by
[51:53] the word he said everything Satan offers
[51:55] you has a plan behind it
[51:58] see what that means is you can't take
[52:00] what Satan offers you at face value
[52:02] amen because what he'll throw you what
[52:03] will he throw you he'll throw you a bit
[52:05] of music that you like right and you say
[52:07] well it's just a song it's just a catchy
[52:09] tune it's just pleasing to my ear what
[52:11] could be wrong with listening to one
[52:12] song then you listen to a second second
[52:14] song and then you start watching them on
[52:16] YouTube and you start to see the clothes
[52:17] that they they wear and the moves that
[52:19] they do and you start to see the the
[52:21] things that they enjoy in life and all
[52:22] of a sudden the spirit that's on them
[52:24] starts to come on you and now it's not
[52:26] just what it's not just a song anymore
[52:28] it's a lifestyle it's an addiction amen
[52:31] and it's something that that draws down
[52:33] deep inside of you and it's a demon
[52:34] possession that happens in those things
[52:36] first time maybe it wasn't but the
[52:38] second time it starts to go in a little
[52:39] bit and a little bit and a little bit
[52:41] more because what it's a seducing spirit
[52:43] it's always a seducing spirit and guess
[52:45] what behind all of that is one thing a
[52:47] thief that is there to steal to kill and
[52:50] to destroy and I guarantee you if we
[52:52] were honest with ourselves and we go
[52:54] back to times where we've been fooled
[52:56] and you look and you say he stole
[52:58] something or he tried to he killed
[53:00] something and he tried to kill something
[53:02] or he destroyed something or you destroy
[53:04] tried to destroy something didn't he
[53:05] he's always got an agenda behind that
[53:08] little Hook when you're fishing for for
[53:10] fish you don't show him the hook do you
[53:12] you show them the thing that they think
[53:14] they want and then there's a hook inside
[53:16] it and that's what they don't see is the
[53:18] hook that's buried inside Satan has a
[53:20] hook inside of everything that he's
[53:21] offering you today don't think that
[53:23] there's some innocent thing that Satan
[53:25] can offer you that doesn't have a hook
[53:27] inside of it amen
[53:29] now we're talking about the law because
[53:31] the law is the thing that condemns us
[53:33] and I'm not going to read all of this
[53:34] I'm going to I've got the scriptures
[53:35] here but this is the original Law these
[53:37] are the Ten Commandments and I'll read
[53:39] only the bolded ones and this is Moses
[53:41] up on the mountain and God comes down he
[53:43] gives them the law brother Branham said
[53:44] they chose the law
[53:47] they said God you can talk to us and
[53:49] then God comes down it scared him so bad
[53:50] he says you go through a prophet and God
[53:52] then had to send a lot to them because
[53:53] he couldn't what go one-on-one with them
[53:56] he says the worst thing they did was
[53:57] they chose the law over a direct
[53:58] relationship with God and he says Thou
[54:01] shalt have no other gods before me Thou
[54:04] shalt not make unto thee any Graven
[54:05] image thou shall not take the name of
[54:08] the Lord thy God in vain remember the
[54:10] Sabbath day to keep it holy honor thy
[54:13] father and thy mother Thou shalt not
[54:15] kill Thou shalt not commit adultery
[54:17] brother Joe
[54:22] prayed one time
[54:24] many times
[54:26] in the presence I believe of a school
[54:28] teacher and he said Lord help me not to
[54:30] commit adultery
[54:32] because he had heard that you shouldn't
[54:34] do it
[54:35] praise the Lord that it was at least
[54:37] drilled into his skull to say don't help
[54:39] me not to do the things I'm not supposed
[54:41] to do even if I don't understand what it
[54:43] is
[54:43] amen
[54:45] amen Thou shalt not steal
[54:47] Thou shalt not bearish false witness
[54:49] against thy neighbor thou shall not
[54:51] covet
[54:52] that's the 10 basic Commandments that
[54:54] God gave them and then he gave them
[54:56] eighteen hundred thousand million
[54:57] bazillion after that but these were the
[54:59] main ones
[55:01] now maybe you're superhuman
[55:03] and you could look at that and say as
[55:06] long as I can remember I've never done
[55:08] that because guess what there were
[55:10] people that made that claim and the
[55:11] scriptures weren't there
[55:14] people made that claim in the scriptures
[55:16] but yet what was it what did you do
[55:18] before you remembered
[55:21] do you remember everything that you did
[55:24] listen I'm 43 and I can't remember what
[55:26] I did last week sometime
[55:28] do you think I could sit here and say
[55:30] that I haven't done any of those well I
[55:31] definitely know I stole because I got
[55:33] caught
[55:34] so I can't say I didn't do that
[55:36] can't say I've never coveted anything
[55:37] now may not have been my neighbor's wife
[55:39] thank the Lord but guess what cars money
[55:43] vacations clothes whatever it might be
[55:46] you pick your poison
[55:47] I don't think any of us how many of us
[55:50] have always honored your father and your
[55:51] mother
[55:53] I can't raise my hand to that
[55:55] by no means
[55:56] there's been absolutely times where we
[55:58] talk back where we talked about them
[56:00] where we put them down
[56:02] where we criticize them behind their
[56:04] back come on we've all done it so
[56:06] there's nothing here that any of us
[56:08] should be able to say I've done that at
[56:10] every time in my life
[56:12] but yet there were a few people in
[56:15] Scripture that did
[56:16] including the Apostle Paul he said in
[56:19] Philippians 3 6 he says touching the
[56:21] righteousness which was in the law
[56:23] blameless
[56:24] so Paul now looking back when he was
[56:27] Saul as a Pharisee said touching the
[56:30] righteousness which was in the law so he
[56:32] said according to the law of Moses my
[56:34] life was blameless
[56:37] wow
[56:39] that takes something to say something
[56:41] like that
[56:42] I don't believe anybody with the new
[56:44] birth could say it and we know Paul
[56:45] never says it after he got the new birth
[56:47] but guess what before you get the new
[56:48] birth there's a lot of people that sit
[56:50] here
[56:51] and say listen my life is great I'm good
[56:54] I don't need anything I'm a good person
[56:57] good kid good daughter good son good boy
[57:00] good girl
[57:01] good message believer
[57:03] right
[57:04] sure
[57:06] listen Luke 18 somebody came to Jesus
[57:09] about it a certain ruler asked him
[57:10] saying good Master what shall I do to
[57:12] inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto
[57:14] him why call us thou me good not as good
[57:16] save one that is God thou knowst the
[57:19] Commandments do not commit adultery do
[57:21] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[57:23] witness honor thy father and thy mother
[57:25] and he said all these have I kept from
[57:27] my youth up
[57:29] we've got another Saul here don't we
[57:32] I've done it all Lord and guess what
[57:34] Jesus never challenges him
[57:39] now does that mean he did it
[57:41] does that mean he was perfect
[57:43] no
[57:45] because Jesus didn't have to prove it
[57:47] look at the next one
[57:48] he says now when Jesus heard these
[57:50] things he said unto him yet lack us thou
[57:52] one thing
[57:54] listen he doesn't have to point out all
[57:57] of your lies if he can point to your one
[57:59] fault
[58:00] because guess what he had more than one
[58:02] fault but he pointed to the fault
[58:05] the fault and guess what most of us have
[58:07] the fault we got an area that we don't
[58:09] like to admit that we don't like to give
[58:11] to God
[58:12] he says yeah one lack is thou one thing
[58:15] so all that thou Hast and distribute
[58:18] unto the poor and thou shalt have
[58:19] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[58:21] me I don't have there but the scripture
[58:23] says and he went away sorrowful because
[58:24] he was very wealthy
[58:27] what he couldn't give it up Jesus knew
[58:29] where his treasure was
[58:31] now listen I believe that young man was
[58:33] good
[58:34] as we would call good I believe he was
[58:37] sincere as all get out
[58:39] but he got an answer he wasn't expecting
[58:41] and that's when we know whether we're
[58:43] really sincere or not is when we get the
[58:45] answer that we don't like what are we
[58:47] going to do with it
[58:48] that's a tough that's a tough place when
[58:51] you get an answer that cuts you to the
[58:53] core that goes right to the thing that
[58:55] you value most and God says give it up
[58:58] will we do it
[58:59] will we do it
[59:01] that's the test
[59:02] he says you may have done all that not
[59:04] going to challenge you on it but here's
[59:06] what you need to do to follow me
[59:08] and he couldn't do it he walked away
[59:10] sorrowful brother Bram says the the the
[59:12] parable of the rich man remember with
[59:14] the barns that he built over and over
[59:15] again he said Soul take my ease and uh
[59:18] and then God said to him thou fool thou
[59:20] full know you not that your soul will be
[59:22] required of you this very night and he
[59:24] woke up in hell
[59:25] amen
[59:27] it's a scary thing to turn down your
[59:28] grace because what you're too close to
[59:32] it too close to something else that
[59:34] won't allow you to serve the very God
[59:36] that's trying to save you amen
[59:39] I'm not trying to take us down this
[59:40] evening but this is serious
[59:42] it's serious because you've got to
[59:43] recognize your natural place and your
[59:45] position outside of that Redemption
[59:47] process yeah
[59:49] because if you don't see this you don't
[59:50] need a Redemption process and you don't
[59:52] need a redeemer
[59:53] and where you're going to go you're
[59:54] going to head the rest of the way that
[59:55] the world is going amen but if you look
[59:58] deeper into the law of Moses we cover
[1:00:00] those Ten Commandments and I think most
[1:00:01] of us admitted I had at least three
[1:00:03] people that agree with me that we
[1:00:04] couldn't do that
[1:00:06] but then we look into the law of Moses
[1:00:08] and now God starts to set laws for your
[1:00:09] heart and your mind
[1:00:11] so now we're moving into what we call
[1:00:13] thought crimes
[1:00:14] and guess what none of us can say we've
[1:00:17] had the perfect thought life can we he
[1:00:20] says in Leviticus 19 Thou shalt not hate
[1:00:22] thy brother in thine heart guess what
[1:00:24] I've done it
[1:00:25] many many times
[1:00:28] and guess what my brother has hated me
[1:00:30] many many times in his heart absolutely
[1:00:34] scripture says the brother is given for
[1:00:35] adversity and I I think there's that's a
[1:00:37] that's a two-sided coin because he's
[1:00:39] given to you for adversity to cause make
[1:00:42] your life a living hell but then he's
[1:00:44] given to you four times adversity
[1:00:46] because when you get two brothers
[1:00:47] staying together they can take on
[1:00:48] anybody
[1:00:49] so you fight in the backyard and you and
[1:00:51] well actually you fight in the front
[1:00:52] yard too but normally if you're in the
[1:00:55] front yard you'll take on all comers
[1:00:56] right but they'll cause you adversity in
[1:00:58] the backyard won't they thou shall not
[1:01:00] hate thy brother in thine heart Thou
[1:01:03] shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor
[1:01:04] and not suffer sin about me saying if if
[1:01:07] you've got a problem with somebody
[1:01:10] you got to Grudge with somebody this is
[1:01:12] the next service he says Thou shalt not
[1:01:16] Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[1:01:19] grudge against the children of thy
[1:01:21] people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:01:22] as thyself on the Lord so he's saying if
[1:01:24] you've got a grudge against somebody you
[1:01:26] don't let it linger he says you go there
[1:01:28] and you get it out
[1:01:30] you get it out you get it out of your
[1:01:31] system whether you're right or wrong
[1:01:33] we'll find out but you get it out don't
[1:01:36] let it linger in there because it'll
[1:01:37] start a root of bitterness and that's
[1:01:39] definitely not the sign of God in your
[1:01:40] life amen but he says you can't hold
[1:01:42] that in your mind you got to get it out
[1:01:43] but he says if you're holding it in your
[1:01:45] mind you're guilty
[1:01:47] you're guilty of holding The Grudge
[1:01:49] listen if I hurt brother Matt it's not
[1:01:51] up for me to make it right if I don't
[1:01:54] know about it he's got to let me know if
[1:01:56] I've done something to offend him if
[1:01:58] he's bearing a grudge because of
[1:01:59] something I did he's got to come to me
[1:02:00] because guess what I'm pretty Clueless
[1:02:03] so he's got to come to me and make it
[1:02:04] right and that's what he's saying you
[1:02:05] got a problem with somebody you got to
[1:02:06] let them know and you got to go let that
[1:02:08] give them an opportunity to make it
[1:02:10] right but in the meantime it's a sin for
[1:02:12] you to hold it in so you're not allowed
[1:02:13] to hate your brother let's add sisters
[1:02:15] in there
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:18] let's put your neighbor next to you you
[1:02:20] can't do it to any of them you can't
[1:02:21] hold grudges if you do then you're in
[1:02:24] violation of the login
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:27] so the law was not just about how you
[1:02:29] did things on the outside and how your
[1:02:30] life looked but it was now the way you
[1:02:32] were thinking on the inside
[1:02:35] now that's a scary place to be because
[1:02:36] you know your thoughts and I know my
[1:02:38] thoughts and guess what they're not
[1:02:40] always Godly are they he says listen
[1:02:42] that's no different than thou shalt not
[1:02:43] kill
[1:02:44] it's in the scriptures right you weren't
[1:02:46] allowed to do it
[1:02:48] and then Jesus now he comes and he
[1:02:50] judges the ministry for his days by the
[1:02:53] very things that we're talking about
[1:02:54] here in Matthew 23 because what what is
[1:02:57] Jesus doing I love what Jesus did and I
[1:02:59] was talking to someone the other day and
[1:03:01] he says and we were talking about this
[1:03:03] this scripture and he says Jesus is
[1:03:04] coming here and he's letting them see
[1:03:06] the way God thinks about things
[1:03:08] it's not just law what Jesus is talking
[1:03:10] about here he's talking about the way
[1:03:12] God sees things
[1:03:14] and Jesus says woe unto you scribes and
[1:03:16] Pharisees Hypocrites for you they tithe
[1:03:19] a mint in that East and cumin and have
[1:03:21] omitted the weightier matters of the law
[1:03:23] judgment mercy and Faith these are you
[1:03:26] to have done and not to leave the other
[1:03:27] undone so he says you should still do
[1:03:29] the tithing on everything that's great
[1:03:31] that's what you're supposed to do but by
[1:03:33] all means you better be doing these
[1:03:34] other things as well he says you blind
[1:03:36] guides which strain at a net and swallow
[1:03:39] a camel woe unto you scribes and
[1:03:41] Pharisees Hypocrites for you may clean
[1:03:44] the outside of the cup and of the
[1:03:46] platter but within they are full of
[1:03:48] extortion and excess
[1:03:51] Thou blind Pharisee cleanse verse that
[1:03:54] which was is within the cup and platter
[1:03:55] that the outside of them may be clean
[1:03:58] also can you imagine the steam coming
[1:03:59] out of their ears as they are publicly
[1:04:01] being addressed this way with Jesus
[1:04:04] taking the height off of them is what
[1:04:06] he's doing
[1:04:08] you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[1:04:10] you are like
[1:04:12] occurs why did
[1:04:14] a deed appear beautiful outward but
[1:04:16] within are full of Dead Man's Bones and
[1:04:19] of all uncleanness
[1:04:21] he's calling him out
[1:04:23] even so all even so ye also outwardly
[1:04:27] appear righteous unto men but within ye
[1:04:30] are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:04:33] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[1:04:35] Hypocrites because ye build the tombs of
[1:04:37] the prophets and garnish the simplest
[1:04:39] curse of the righteous and say if we had
[1:04:41] been in the days of our fathers we would
[1:04:43] not have been partakers with them in the
[1:04:45] blood of the prophets he says wherefore
[1:04:47] ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that you
[1:04:49] are the children of them which killed
[1:04:51] the prophets
[1:04:52] fill you up then the measure of your
[1:04:54] fathers you serpents you Generation of
[1:04:56] Vipers how can you escape the damnation
[1:04:59] of hell
[1:05:00] they spent all their lives living
[1:05:03] perfect lives as far as the outside
[1:05:05] looked and in one Fell Swoop the Messiah
[1:05:08] comes and he completely shreds the life
[1:05:11] that they're living and he says what
[1:05:13] you've been living he says is a life of
[1:05:14] hypocrisy because inside is dirty while
[1:05:17] the outside looks so good
[1:05:19] right Jesus in a few minutes walks up
[1:05:21] and he diminishes their righteousness to
[1:05:24] nothing
[1:05:24] he says it's not even worth talking
[1:05:26] about it's like Graves full of dead
[1:05:29] men's bones and uncleanness that's
[1:05:31] pretty gross
[1:05:33] guess what we're no different
[1:05:35] our righteousness is his filthy rags
[1:05:39] older people look that up what that
[1:05:40] means it's disgusting
[1:05:42] disgusting okay that's where we fit in
[1:05:46] listen to what prophet of God said about
[1:05:48] this scene he says do you know all those
[1:05:49] Pharisees and Sadducees everyone was
[1:05:52] very Pious and religious people
[1:05:55] how they loved god with their hearts
[1:05:58] they thought
[1:06:00] and failed to see that innocent one the
[1:06:03] Son of God to recognize him to be the
[1:06:05] Son of God and yet they were very
[1:06:07] religious is that right very Pious very
[1:06:09] scholarly know of the Bible better than
[1:06:11] any of our Scholars today they had
[1:06:13] nothing to do but set there through
[1:06:15] their generations and serve the Lord
[1:06:17] their entire purpose was to serve God
[1:06:21] he says and yet they thought they loved
[1:06:23] God they thought it
[1:06:26] he says in this case many of the
[1:06:28] scholars of those days very culture men
[1:06:30] in the scripture that is in their own
[1:06:32] theology the Pharisees and Sadducees not
[1:06:34] men of bad reputation but men of good
[1:06:37] reputation men that must live lives
[1:06:39] above reproach to hold their office in
[1:06:41] the house of God they were men who had
[1:06:43] to be born out of a certain lineage of
[1:06:45] people before they could become a priest
[1:06:47] and their fathers had to be priests
[1:06:49] before them he says but yet it is
[1:06:51] possible for a good cultured man very
[1:06:55] scholarly in his Bible teaching yet to
[1:06:58] be an unbeliever
[1:07:00] now I'm talking to message Believers
[1:07:02] tonight and guess what we can be in this
[1:07:04] exact same boat can't we because what
[1:07:06] raised in a message home raised by
[1:07:09] message parents raised with a good
[1:07:10] pastor raised in a good church it's been
[1:07:12] here for 42 years
[1:07:15] good good good good check mark check
[1:07:17] mark check mark check mark very Pious
[1:07:19] very knowledgeable in the doctrines and
[1:07:21] scriptures of the message
[1:07:22] right we know everything we're supposed
[1:07:24] to know
[1:07:26] he says yet to be an unbeliever in all
[1:07:29] of that
[1:07:30] for I do not expect tonight that we have
[1:07:31] many men in America tonight that could
[1:07:33] compete with the scholarship of those
[1:07:34] Priests of that day for they were
[1:07:36] learning men and they had to be found
[1:07:38] blameless when it comes to morals
[1:07:42] they knew their scriptures just like
[1:07:44] they know catechism today but yet in all
[1:07:47] this it's possible that men could be
[1:07:49] ever so sincere and be ever such a Bible
[1:07:51] scholar and yet be wrong in their
[1:07:53] teachings he says for approves that they
[1:07:57] could be
[1:07:59] so it's a warning for us amen not to sit
[1:08:01] here and say because I know the truth I
[1:08:03] am a part of the body of Christ
[1:08:05] listen everybody that sat under Jesus
[1:08:07] ministry that heard him knew the truth
[1:08:09] there are many that accepted it to a
[1:08:11] certain degree but there was only 120
[1:08:13] went up on the day of Pentecost out of
[1:08:14] the thousands and thousands and
[1:08:16] thousands that he fed and that he spoke
[1:08:18] to and that he preached to and that he
[1:08:20] healed and did all these things only 120
[1:08:22] went up on the on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:24] 10 days before that's it that's it
[1:08:28] don't think it's going to be any
[1:08:29] different amongst us
[1:08:32] there's going to be lots of us sitting
[1:08:33] there listening by God's grace I hope
[1:08:35] this is the one church that doesn't have
[1:08:36] the three kinds of Believers in it you
[1:08:38] know we all want to believe it we all
[1:08:40] want to believe it but guess what every
[1:08:42] church has had people go away
[1:08:44] right every church has had people fall
[1:08:45] away
[1:08:46] and guess what we're believing that
[1:08:48] they'll come back in many cases but
[1:08:49] guess what not all are called
[1:08:51] not all are chosen it could be the way
[1:08:53] that we put it right
[1:08:55] listen now Jesus comes after all of this
[1:08:58] and after we have the law of Moses and
[1:09:01] we have the the outward acts and then we
[1:09:03] have the thought crimes and all of those
[1:09:04] things and then Jesus comes behind this
[1:09:06] and how he says I'm going to do even I'm
[1:09:08] going to make it even harder for you
[1:09:10] right
[1:09:11] Jesus comes and he shows the absolute
[1:09:13] inability for us to live a life that
[1:09:17] would ever please God you know it's
[1:09:19] interesting to me that brother Brown's
[1:09:20] talking here about these men they had to
[1:09:22] live uh lives of perfect morals and
[1:09:25] their security was in their life that
[1:09:27] they lived that's really where their
[1:09:28] security was they believed that their
[1:09:30] righteousness was enough to get them
[1:09:31] across the line right and guess what we
[1:09:35] see that in every instance in scripture
[1:09:37] we see it in the Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:09:39] we see it in Saul before he came Paul
[1:09:41] the only people that believed they were
[1:09:44] good enough were under an antichrist
[1:09:45] spirit
[1:09:47] that's hard isn't it but they were under
[1:09:49] an antichrist Spirit the ones that
[1:09:51] consider themselves blameless were the
[1:09:53] ones that crucified and crucified Christ
[1:09:55] and persecuted the church everyone else
[1:09:57] realized they weren't
[1:09:58] and they're the ones that could come in
[1:10:00] but the ones that thought that they
[1:10:02] didn't need anything else they were the
[1:10:04] ones that were under an antichrist
[1:10:05] spirit and they thought that they were
[1:10:06] righteous enough to get in and they
[1:10:07] looked down on everybody else
[1:10:10] let it be a lesson to us if we think
[1:10:11] we're living pretty good lives listen
[1:10:14] it's never going to be good enough to
[1:10:15] please God
[1:10:16] look at Matthew 5 as Jesus is talking
[1:10:18] now he says think not that I am come to
[1:10:21] destroy the law of the prophets I'm not
[1:10:23] come to destroy but to fulfill that's a
[1:10:25] Redemption scripture right there but
[1:10:27] watch what he starts to do here now he
[1:10:29] says reverely I say unto you till Heaven
[1:10:31] and Earth pass one John or one Tittle
[1:10:33] shall in no wise pass from the law till
[1:10:35] all be fulfilled whosoever therefore
[1:10:37] shall break one of these least
[1:10:39] Commandments and shall teach men so he
[1:10:41] shall be called the least in the Kingdom
[1:10:43] of Heaven so he says if you teach men to
[1:10:45] do the Commandments and you break a
[1:10:46] little commandment he says you're the
[1:10:47] least in the Kingdom but least you're in
[1:10:49] the Kingdom he says but whosoever shall
[1:10:51] do it and teach them the same Shall be
[1:10:54] Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven so
[1:10:55] the one that can live it and teach it
[1:10:57] that's the one that's going to be great
[1:10:58] in the Kingdom he's looking for a life
[1:11:00] amen not just words
[1:11:02] and he says for I say unto you that
[1:11:04] accept your righteousness shall exceed
[1:11:06] the righteousness of the scribes and
[1:11:08] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[1:11:10] into the Kingdom of Heaven listen the
[1:11:13] Pharisees were blameless Paul said
[1:11:15] blameless they believe themselves to be
[1:11:16] blameless and he says you've got to go
[1:11:18] higher than blameless
[1:11:20] how do you go higher than blameless
[1:11:23] how do you get any better than the the
[1:11:25] righteousness of the Pharisees and the
[1:11:26] Sadducees
[1:11:28] okay tell us in the next verse this is
[1:11:30] what exceeding the righteousness of the
[1:11:32] Pharisees and Sadducees looks like verse
[1:11:34] 21 you have heard it said of them in the
[1:11:37] old time Thou shalt not kill and
[1:11:39] whosoever shall kill you shall be in
[1:11:41] danger of judgment so he says you think
[1:11:42] it's simple this is how this is they say
[1:11:45] thou shalt not kill listen to this he
[1:11:46] says it's so much bigger than you think
[1:11:48] but I say unto you that whosoever is
[1:11:51] angry with his brother without a cause
[1:11:53] shall be in danger of the judgment and
[1:11:57] whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa
[1:11:59] that means empty-headed stupid
[1:12:01] dim-witted or idiot
[1:12:05] anybody ever called somebody that
[1:12:07] you're in danger
[1:12:09] both of you
[1:12:12] he says shall be in danger of the
[1:12:13] council but whosoever shall say thou
[1:12:16] full shall be in danger of Hellfire now
[1:12:18] guess what I have called people fools
[1:12:20] absolutely according to this I'm in
[1:12:23] danger of Hellfire
[1:12:25] because I don't suffer fools gladly
[1:12:28] I'm glad he suffers me though
[1:12:30] he says therefore if thou bring thy gift
[1:12:32] to The Altar and remembers that thou
[1:12:34] brother had thought against thee leave
[1:12:36] there thy gift before the Altar and go
[1:12:37] thy way first be reconciled to thy
[1:12:40] brother and then come and offer thy gift
[1:12:42] so you remember you got to make
[1:12:43] something right brother Brandon would
[1:12:44] say you don't go to communion with
[1:12:45] something again if you got something
[1:12:47] you've done wrong to somebody he says
[1:12:48] you make it right before you go to that
[1:12:49] communion table
[1:12:51] right
[1:12:52] he says first we reconciled then come
[1:12:54] off for that gift agree with thine
[1:12:56] adversary quickly whilst Thou Art in the
[1:12:58] way with him lest at any time the
[1:13:00] adversary delivered thee to the judge
[1:13:02] and the judge delivery to the officer
[1:13:04] and thou be cast into prison verily I
[1:13:07] say unto thee they Thou shalt by no
[1:13:09] means come out thence to thou has paid
[1:13:10] the uttermost farther
[1:13:12] says you have heard it was said of them
[1:13:14] of the old time Thou shalt not commit
[1:13:15] adultery brother Joe this one's for you
[1:13:19] what he says you think this one's easy
[1:13:21] because you just don't have to touch
[1:13:23] another woman
[1:13:25] but he says listen I say unto you that
[1:13:28] whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
[1:13:31] after her hath committed adultery with
[1:13:33] her already in his heart
[1:13:36] Jesus said you're so worried about the
[1:13:38] act and he says I'm looking what in the
[1:13:40] inside I'm looking at your heart I'm
[1:13:42] looking at your mind if you're thinking
[1:13:43] about doing it you've already done it
[1:13:45] and you'll be judged accordingly
[1:13:47] remember brother Branham It's Kind of a
[1:13:49] Funny Story remember he said in that he
[1:13:51] was in the presence of God and and he
[1:13:53] had thought he was doing pretty good and
[1:13:55] he says the only thing he could say in
[1:13:56] that presence was I didn't commit
[1:13:58] adultery
[1:13:59] the physical act because guess what if
[1:14:01] you're a red blooded male you've done
[1:14:02] this at some point in your life
[1:14:05] simple fact
[1:14:07] simple fact remember brother Branham had
[1:14:09] a cross in his automobile and he told
[1:14:10] the brother he said I'm a red blooded
[1:14:12] man too
[1:14:13] right it was the guard what the thoughts
[1:14:15] that could go through his mind if the
[1:14:16] wrong type of woman walked in front of
[1:14:18] him
[1:14:19] then he goes on here if you're right I
[1:14:21] have offend me in these different things
[1:14:23] then he says and it has been said
[1:14:25] whosoever shall put away his wife let
[1:14:27] him give her a writing of divorcement
[1:14:29] so Moses out of the hardness of their
[1:14:31] hearts he said to them later he allowed
[1:14:33] you to have a divorce he says but I say
[1:14:35] unto you that whosoever shall put his
[1:14:37] wife away his wife save him for the
[1:14:39] cause of fornication causes her to
[1:14:41] commit adultery and whoever whoever
[1:14:43] shall marry her that his divorce commits
[1:14:44] adultery as well
[1:14:46] so now they used to be allowed to do it
[1:14:48] and he says no no there's only one
[1:14:50] reason you're allowed to do it and if
[1:14:51] you've done it otherwise then you are
[1:14:53] also in transgression of the law
[1:14:57] he's taking them to the big picture he's
[1:14:59] taking them to the way God looks at
[1:15:00] things amen
[1:15:02] he says again you've heard that have
[1:15:03] been said of them at all time Thou shalt
[1:15:05] not forswear thyself but Thou shalt
[1:15:07] perform unto the Lord thy knows but I
[1:15:09] say unto you swear not at all either by
[1:15:11] heaven for it is God's Throne neither by
[1:15:13] the Earth for it is his footstool
[1:15:14] neither by Jerusalem for is the city of
[1:15:16] the great king he goes through all these
[1:15:18] different things let your communication
[1:15:19] be yeah yeah they says you have heard
[1:15:22] that it has been said an eye for an eye
[1:15:24] and a tooth for the tooth this is
[1:15:25] literally the law of Moses we're going
[1:15:26] to read it in a little bit and he's
[1:15:29] saying listen you think that whatever
[1:15:30] you do to somebody they have to do back
[1:15:32] and whatever they do to you you get to
[1:15:34] do back to them
[1:15:35] he's saying this is the law and this is
[1:15:37] what you you think you're supposed to do
[1:15:39] but what's he doing he's setting them up
[1:15:40] for what the gospel that's coming the
[1:15:42] law of Grace the law of Mercy the law of
[1:15:44] long-suffering all Ten Thousand Angels
[1:15:46] could have destroyed them where they
[1:15:47] were but he stood there and he let them
[1:15:49] do it over and over and over again for
[1:15:51] our sake
[1:15:52] he says if any man will sue the at the
[1:15:53] law and take away thy coat let him have
[1:15:55] that cloak also for whosoever shall
[1:15:58] compel thee to go Mel go with him Twain
[1:16:00] in those days a Roman could compel a Jew
[1:16:02] to carry his load for a mile
[1:16:05] and it was the bane of their existence
[1:16:06] because guess what you might have
[1:16:08] something to do and you're walking down
[1:16:09] the road a Roman Taps you on the
[1:16:10] shoulder hands is Big Box to you and
[1:16:12] says carry this a mile
[1:16:14] and Jesus says go too
[1:16:17] thanks Jesus
[1:16:20] didn't make their day I'm sure when they
[1:16:22] said this one
[1:16:25] give to him that asketh thee and from
[1:16:27] him that would borrow the etern not thou
[1:16:29] away you've heard that it has been said
[1:16:31] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:16:33] thine enemy
[1:16:35] but I say unto you
[1:16:37] he says you've been told but I see
[1:16:39] you've been told but I say you've been
[1:16:41] told but I say what's he doing now he's
[1:16:43] expanding he's magnifying the law
[1:16:46] again he's letting them see it the way
[1:16:48] God sees it but I say unto you love your
[1:16:50] enemies bless them the curse you do good
[1:16:52] to them that hate you and pray for them
[1:16:54] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:16:57] you
[1:16:58] wow why because this is what he's going
[1:17:01] to do for us
[1:17:02] listen he's not just giving them words
[1:17:05] to condemn them but he's showing them
[1:17:07] that he's going to do the very thing
[1:17:08] that he's telling us to do as well
[1:17:10] this is how you fulfill it as you go all
[1:17:12] the way to the very mind and intent of
[1:17:14] God that's behind the law
[1:17:16] he says that you may be the children of
[1:17:18] your father which is in heaven for he
[1:17:20] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[1:17:22] on the good and sendeth Reign on the
[1:17:24] just and on the unjust for if you love
[1:17:26] them which love you what reward have ye
[1:17:28] I love it when I when there's loving
[1:17:30] people around that's great it's easy to
[1:17:32] love people that love you
[1:17:33] he says do not even the publicans do the
[1:17:36] same
[1:17:37] Republicans were the worst of the worst
[1:17:38] back in those days
[1:17:40] it says even the publicans like people
[1:17:41] that like them so what's so big about
[1:17:43] that guys
[1:17:46] and if you salute your brethren only
[1:17:48] what do you do more than others
[1:17:50] do not even the public and so
[1:17:53] that was probably the worst insult you
[1:17:55] could tell the Sadducees and the
[1:17:56] Pharisees was that guess what the way
[1:17:58] you act Republicans even do that
[1:18:01] because they thought they were so much
[1:18:02] higher remember that one he talks about
[1:18:04] the the man the priest is standing there
[1:18:06] saying I'm so glad I'm not like that
[1:18:08] Publican over there
[1:18:09] he says the way you guys act he says
[1:18:11] just like the publicans for all of your
[1:18:13] righteousness he says you act just like
[1:18:14] them
[1:18:16] but what does he say remember he said
[1:18:18] your righteousness had to exceed the
[1:18:19] Pharisees and the Sadducees he says be
[1:18:22] therefore perfect even as your father
[1:18:25] which is in heaven is perfect
[1:18:28] what does Jesus say he raises the bar
[1:18:30] and he says be like God is
[1:18:32] and guess what I don't think any one of
[1:18:34] those Pharisees could raise their hand
[1:18:35] and say yep my life is just like gods
[1:18:39] as as high-minded as they might be none
[1:18:42] of them would ever dare say I'm as
[1:18:43] righteous as God is I don't think they
[1:18:45] had that arrogance
[1:18:47] but that's the requirement is to be as
[1:18:49] he is because that's what Adam and Eve
[1:18:51] were they were as he was they were in
[1:18:53] his presence because they were holy they
[1:18:55] were spotless they were pure they were
[1:18:57] of the same mind they were of the same
[1:18:59] nature
[1:19:00] and so without that there's no hope
[1:19:02] there's no hope I remember
[1:19:05] you know when I got saved or the I say
[1:19:07] saved the night I gave my heart to the
[1:19:09] Lord
[1:19:10] and it was it was such an amazing thing
[1:19:13] because I had a pretty high opinion of
[1:19:15] myself
[1:19:17] And yet when that presence of God came
[1:19:19] in and I knew I had to give my heart to
[1:19:21] him and that pull was so completely
[1:19:24] compelling
[1:19:26] and as I went up and it took 45 minutes
[1:19:28] if I remember correctly give or take
[1:19:31] from the moment I left my Pew to the
[1:19:32] moment that the brothers laid hands on
[1:19:34] me
[1:19:36] and in those 45 minutes I couldn't stop
[1:19:38] crying
[1:19:40] you know why
[1:19:41] because I saw myself in comparison to
[1:19:44] him rather than in comparison to the
[1:19:46] people around me
[1:19:47] and that's where we've got to end up is
[1:19:49] because if we sit here and guess what
[1:19:51] some of us like it or not are are wheat
[1:19:55] that give 30 fold some of us are 60 and
[1:19:57] some 100 and it's really easy for the
[1:19:59] hundredfold to compare themselves to the
[1:20:01] 30 and say guess what I'm good
[1:20:03] and guess what you can be kind of a
[1:20:05] 30-fold even before you give your heart
[1:20:06] to the Lord you can be a good kid you
[1:20:08] can be a good citizen you can come to
[1:20:10] church Faithfully you can be respectful
[1:20:11] to your parents you can get a good job
[1:20:13] you can stay away from the things of the
[1:20:15] world and you sit there and you say I'm
[1:20:16] pretty good
[1:20:18] but guess what I was pretty good I was
[1:20:21] still doing things I was still listening
[1:20:22] to country music and some rock and roll
[1:20:24] and this and that and the other things
[1:20:25] some little things but I was pretty good
[1:20:27] but guess what in that presence
[1:20:30] I was filthy as filthy could be and all
[1:20:33] you could say was God have mercy and I'm
[1:20:35] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:20:38] not for what I did for what I was
[1:20:42] if you think this is about what you've
[1:20:44] done you've missed the point
[1:20:46] because what you'll do is you'll go
[1:20:47] around and you'll go looking and trying
[1:20:49] to remember the things you've done that
[1:20:51] were wrong and you've not realized that
[1:20:53] you are just wrong that you are in your
[1:20:56] nature your very birth your very flesh
[1:20:58] your everything about you is wrong wrong
[1:21:03] and that's why you repent yes you repent
[1:21:06] for the things you know you've done
[1:21:08] wrong yes you need to go make them right
[1:21:09] if you have to but repentance is because
[1:21:12] of what you are not just what you've
[1:21:14] done
[1:21:15] and that's what it was it was so
[1:21:17] magnified to me and it was so
[1:21:20] so completely obvious that in his
[1:21:23] presence and by comparison to him I am
[1:21:26] as dirty as dirty could be absolute
[1:21:30] filth smut disgusting dirty nothing
[1:21:34] nothing to compare to him nothing
[1:21:38] and in that presence I could never
[1:21:40] that's why brother Brown says in that
[1:21:43] presence you can never condemn another
[1:21:44] man or woman you cannot condemn another
[1:21:46] brother or sister you can't carry a
[1:21:48] grudge you can't carry a fault in there
[1:21:50] because all it does is it magnifies your
[1:21:53] errors and faults and in that it
[1:21:55] magnifies them to such a level you can't
[1:21:57] sit there and say well sister so and so
[1:21:59] but brother so and so or I'm better than
[1:22:03] them no no no it's just you and him
[1:22:05] listen when you're in the chamber it's
[1:22:07] just you and him there's nobody else in
[1:22:09] there anymore amen and so I'm sitting in
[1:22:11] there and I just couldn't stop crying
[1:22:14] because you are unworthy
[1:22:17] remember we read the first scripture we
[1:22:19] said it looked over all the Earth above
[1:22:21] the Earth in the earth and below the
[1:22:23] Earth and guess what not a man was
[1:22:24] worthy that means Humanity that means
[1:22:27] not a sister was worthy either
[1:22:29] nothing was worthy to open the book
[1:22:31] nobody could take the title deed of
[1:22:33] redemption and open it up and say this
[1:22:35] is mine this is me couldn't even see if
[1:22:38] your name was in there nobody could do
[1:22:40] it none was found worthy
[1:22:42] I believe this is my personal opinion I
[1:22:45] believe that's why more people don't
[1:22:46] have the Holy Ghost today is that they
[1:22:48] have repented for what they've done
[1:22:49] rather than what they are
[1:22:51] because if you don't repent for what you
[1:22:53] are you don't need a new birth
[1:22:55] and if you don't get the new birth then
[1:22:56] you can't even see the kingdom of God
[1:22:58] much less be a part of it amen
[1:22:59] repentance comes because you realize how
[1:23:02] Fallen you are
[1:23:04] your very nature this flesh everything
[1:23:06] about it is Fallen it is no good it
[1:23:09] needs to die it needs to die amen that's
[1:23:12] why you repent
[1:23:16] when we look over the law and we've read
[1:23:18] all the things that God said not to do
[1:23:20] and it's harsh
[1:23:21] it's a hard law and it's impossible to
[1:23:24] follow but guess what the penalties are
[1:23:25] even worse
[1:23:26] look at the first law in Genesis 2 he
[1:23:28] says but of the tree of knowledge of
[1:23:30] Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat it for
[1:23:32] in the day that thou eatst thereof Thou
[1:23:34] shalt surely die the first penalty for
[1:23:36] the first law was death and guess what
[1:23:38] it stayed the same ever since it has
[1:23:40] been death death the first law said
[1:23:42] you'll die and after that every other
[1:23:44] law was death or some form thereof that
[1:23:46] was very very painful whatever you did
[1:23:48] to somebody they got to do back to you
[1:23:50] if you damage their horse they got to
[1:23:52] damage your horse if you hurt theirs
[1:23:54] they got to hurt yours if you took off
[1:23:56] their arm they got to take off your arm
[1:23:57] if you killed somebody then somebody got
[1:23:59] to kill you
[1:24:00] listen the scripture says in Exodus 21
[1:24:02] if any Mischief follow then Thou shalt
[1:24:04] give Life For Life eye for eye tooth for
[1:24:07] tooth hand for hand foot for foot
[1:24:10] burning for burning wound for wound and
[1:24:12] straight for strike you got what you
[1:24:14] gave
[1:24:14] you got what you gave
[1:24:16] how many times would we be dead if we
[1:24:19] were if we were in that boat not because
[1:24:20] we killed somebody but we'd be so beat
[1:24:22] up from all the things that he had a had
[1:24:24] a line on us for
[1:24:26] that we'd be wounded and beat up and
[1:24:28] everything all the time
[1:24:30] If he if we were judged based on what he
[1:24:32] saw now not just what we saw in each
[1:24:34] other
[1:24:35] brother Mark shared a story with me
[1:24:36] that's in the scripture I'd never read
[1:24:37] it before and it showed how serious the
[1:24:39] law was because we're inclined to give
[1:24:41] people a pass
[1:24:43] we're inclined to do that generally we
[1:24:45] say it's usually not that bad
[1:24:48] now you kill somebody that's pretty bad
[1:24:49] but everything else we're tending to be
[1:24:51] a little bit lenient you know
[1:24:53] give them Grace especially in the case
[1:24:55] of ignorance
[1:24:56] if you know somebody didn't mean to do
[1:24:58] it if they were innocent in their intent
[1:25:00] or they're ignorant in what they did you
[1:25:02] say oh now you know don't do it again
[1:25:04] guess what the law had no room for
[1:25:07] ignorance and the law had no no room for
[1:25:09] I didn't know about it I didn't mean it
[1:25:12] that way
[1:25:13] that's not what I intended to do it got
[1:25:15] out of control the law had no
[1:25:17] recognition for those excuses or ideas
[1:25:20] numbers 15 says while the children of
[1:25:22] Israel were in the wilderness they found
[1:25:23] a man that gathered sticks upon the
[1:25:25] Sabbath day
[1:25:27] and they found they that found him
[1:25:28] Gathering sticks brought him to Moses
[1:25:30] and Aaron and unto all the congregations
[1:25:31] so he wanted some sticks to heat up his
[1:25:33] food probably
[1:25:35] now how many of us would say he just
[1:25:37] wants a hot meal let's let him go
[1:25:40] that's what we'd say isn't it
[1:25:43] they put him in the ward because it was
[1:25:45] not declared what should be done to him
[1:25:47] and the Lord said unto Moses The man
[1:25:49] shall surely be put to death
[1:25:52] for Gathering sticks on the Sabbath
[1:25:55] all the congregations sell Stone them
[1:25:57] with stones without the camp and all the
[1:26:00] congregation brought him without the
[1:26:01] camp and stoned him with stones and he
[1:26:03] died as the Lord commanded Moses this is
[1:26:06] the law
[1:26:08] we don't want the law
[1:26:10] everything was death death maiming
[1:26:13] Stripes lose lose pain pain pain pain
[1:26:17] pain the law condemned us and none of
[1:26:20] the results were ever good for somebody
[1:26:21] that was judged under the law
[1:26:23] the two or three Witnesses you died
[1:26:25] death death death death death death
[1:26:26] death death Death
[1:26:28] that's all that followed under the law
[1:26:30] amen
[1:26:31] listen all he wants is a warm breakfast
[1:26:34] and he dies because of it that's how
[1:26:36] harsh the law was there's no Grace under
[1:26:38] that
[1:26:39] there's no reason old fella he had
[1:26:41] nobody to help him he forgot no you did
[1:26:44] it you died
[1:26:46] that's harsh
[1:26:48] I know this isn't the most fun thing to
[1:26:50] listen to but the thing I want you to
[1:26:52] recognize is under this we had no hope
[1:26:54] no hope of what fulfilling it
[1:26:58] and no Hope from getting out from under
[1:26:59] it
[1:27:01] we had no hope this was a hopeless we
[1:27:03] were a lost cause if we had to stay
[1:27:04] under this for there because what the
[1:27:07] law could only condemn the law is only
[1:27:09] there to condemn it's not to set you
[1:27:10] free it's to condemn you
[1:27:12] that's it the only reason we have laws
[1:27:14] is to what judge somebody to give them a
[1:27:17] penalty it's never to give them life is
[1:27:19] it it's always to penalize them it's
[1:27:21] always to cause them to hold them
[1:27:23] accountable for what they do then we get
[1:27:25] over in James 2 10 he says for whosoever
[1:27:27] shall keep the whole law and yet offend
[1:27:29] in one point he's guilty of all thanks
[1:27:30] James
[1:27:31] you mess up one you messed them all
[1:27:34] you're guilty of them all so guess what
[1:27:36] brother Joe you may not have committed
[1:27:37] adultery but if you lied just once it's
[1:27:40] as if you committed adultery too
[1:27:44] ouch
[1:27:45] like I said there's no Grace under the
[1:27:46] law
[1:27:47] you died under one law you didn't have
[1:27:50] to break them all to die under there you
[1:27:51] just had to break one
[1:27:53] so James says you break one you break
[1:27:55] them all it doesn't matter you're going
[1:27:56] to die under it
[1:27:58] Romans 3 23 says for all have sinned and
[1:28:01] come short of the glory of God guess
[1:28:03] what all includes us all
[1:28:05] every one of us all of humanity every
[1:28:07] man born of a woman as the scripture
[1:28:09] says amen you could maybe live a life
[1:28:11] perfectly and yet your thoughts would
[1:28:13] deny you access to the presence of God
[1:28:15] because your thoughts will get you every
[1:28:16] time your emotions will get you every
[1:28:18] time because you can't control them you
[1:28:20] can't control it
[1:28:22] you can control your actions but you
[1:28:23] can't control what's going on inside
[1:28:24] your head so often so you're going to be
[1:28:26] hooped no matter what amen listen you
[1:28:28] pay your tithes and offerings Faithfully
[1:28:30] attend church and you have one wrong
[1:28:31] thought and it will deny you access to
[1:28:33] the presence of God under the law
[1:28:35] that's how that's how sad it is amen and
[1:28:38] what is it that's death to be outside of
[1:28:40] the presence of God that's death and so
[1:28:42] the law just takes you outside the
[1:28:44] presence of God time and time and time
[1:28:46] again
[1:28:47] the church age book in the in the
[1:28:49] Ephesian Church age brother Brian says
[1:28:50] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:28:52] Eid of the tree of life which is in the
[1:28:54] midst of the paradise of God what a
[1:28:56] thrilling thought is this this is
[1:28:58] beautiful because you remember the
[1:28:59] Ephesian Church age is the first one
[1:29:01] and the first thing we have after Christ
[1:29:03] leaves is we have access back to what
[1:29:05] the Tree of Life
[1:29:07] so first thing he restores is access to
[1:29:09] the Tree of Life what is it it's Christ
[1:29:10] it's the Holy Ghost in our case that's
[1:29:12] the word made flesh
[1:29:14] right it's the spirit of God it's the
[1:29:16] life of God inside of us he says right
[1:29:17] here you get access to the Tree of Life
[1:29:19] if you overcome what a thrilling thought
[1:29:22] is this that tree of life in the Garden
[1:29:23] of Eden which could not be approached
[1:29:25] unto because of the fall of Adam is now
[1:29:27] given to the Overcomer the Flaming sword
[1:29:30] of the Guardian Cherry cherubim has been
[1:29:32] sheathed but it was not sheathed before
[1:29:34] its blade was Bloody with the blood of
[1:29:35] the Lamb he says let us meditate upon
[1:29:37] this truth a while as we consider why
[1:29:40] the tree was denied to Adam and his
[1:29:41] descendants but now allowed again
[1:29:44] he says God's intention for his creation
[1:29:46] man is to express his words in Genesis
[1:29:49] Adam was given the word to live by a
[1:29:52] life lived by the word would be the word
[1:29:53] expressed that's true is it not but did
[1:29:55] Adam live by every word no because he
[1:29:58] was to live by every word and he failed
[1:30:00] to take heed to every word then there
[1:30:02] are those Moses what a great and mighty
[1:30:03] man he was yet he also failed to live by
[1:30:06] every word and that Prophet the type of
[1:30:08] the great prophet to come failed in
[1:30:10] Anger to obey the word what got him
[1:30:13] anger
[1:30:14] something inside caused something
[1:30:16] outside to go wrong
[1:30:18] he says there was also David the great
[1:30:20] king of Israel a man after God's Own
[1:30:23] Heart and he failed by adultery when he
[1:30:26] was tempted
[1:30:27] Great Men great examples listen Moses is
[1:30:31] the greatest of the Great
[1:30:32] and David's the one that God said is a
[1:30:34] man after my own heart and yet each and
[1:30:36] every one of them failed great prophets
[1:30:38] great rulers great Kings great warriors
[1:30:40] great Believers great Overcomers
[1:30:44] I'd love to have the life of David
[1:30:47] I don't want the life of Moses but I'll
[1:30:49] take David
[1:30:51] I identify with David
[1:30:54] but yeah he failed
[1:30:56] even with a heart like God's Own Heart
[1:30:58] he still failed amen every single one of
[1:31:01] them listen if David couldn't do it what
[1:31:03] hope do we have if we're in the same
[1:31:05] condition as David's in we have no hope
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:08] look at the Apostle Paul now this is in
[1:31:10] Romans 7.
[1:31:13] Romans 8 is the great chapter Romans 7
[1:31:15] is the the realities of The Human
[1:31:17] Condition
[1:31:18] Paul says for we know that the law is
[1:31:20] spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin
[1:31:23] for that which I do I allow not
[1:31:26] for what I would that I do not that do I
[1:31:29] not but what I hate that do I so he said
[1:31:31] the things I want to do I don't do it
[1:31:32] and the things I hate I do them
[1:31:35] this is the Apostle Paul speaking
[1:31:38] if then I do that which I would not I
[1:31:40] consent unto the law that it is good now
[1:31:42] then it is no more I that do it but sin
[1:31:44] that dwelleth in me for I know that in
[1:31:46] me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[1:31:49] thing
[1:31:50] for to will is present with me but how
[1:31:53] to perform that which is good I find not
[1:31:55] he says wanting to do good isn't power
[1:31:57] not powerful enough to make you do good
[1:31:59] amen and if there's one thing you learn
[1:32:01] outside of the of the power and presence
[1:32:03] of God is that you can have all the
[1:32:04] desire to do good in your life and it'll
[1:32:06] never come to fruition until you get out
[1:32:08] of the way and let him do it for you
[1:32:09] amen it's never going to happen you
[1:32:11] don't have enough in you to make that
[1:32:13] change because your Nature has fallen
[1:32:15] and you'll keep going back to it and
[1:32:16] back to it and back to it we're
[1:32:17] destructive by Nature
[1:32:19] Paul says verse 19 for the good that I
[1:32:22] would I don't do it but the evil which I
[1:32:25] would not that I do he's saying I don't
[1:32:27] do the good but I want to but I do the
[1:32:29] evil that I don't want to and that's
[1:32:30] what I end up doing and it's frustrating
[1:32:32] me
[1:32:33] anybody ever feel like this
[1:32:36] you say I'm going to get up every
[1:32:37] morning and have devotions I'm going to
[1:32:39] start my day right
[1:32:41] and what do you do you get up the first
[1:32:42] morning and you have devotions praise
[1:32:45] the Lord get the second morning you do
[1:32:46] devotions get the third morning what you
[1:32:49] do you hit the 15-minute snooze
[1:32:50] so now you got a little less time for
[1:32:52] devotions next morning you get up you're
[1:32:53] down to a half hour for devotions
[1:32:56] next morning you don't even wake up
[1:32:58] the next morning when you wake up when
[1:33:00] you do wake up you're on your phone
[1:33:02] what is it you want to do right
[1:33:04] but there's something in you that won't
[1:33:05] do it
[1:33:06] why because you'll fall back on your own
[1:33:08] nature every single time right you need
[1:33:11] something bigger than you you need
[1:33:12] something greater than you you need
[1:33:14] something that'll draw you to him
[1:33:15] because guess what there's nothing in us
[1:33:16] to draw us to God he's got to be calling
[1:33:18] us to do these things amen listen Paul
[1:33:21] dealt with this this is not just before
[1:33:23] his conversion this is after it
[1:33:25] this is after it because before his
[1:33:27] conversion he thought he was perfect
[1:33:29] he was perfect blameless in his own eyes
[1:33:31] so this is clearly afterwards but he
[1:33:34] says listen there's a battle in my flesh
[1:33:36] he says now if I do that I would not it
[1:33:39] is no more I that do it but sin that
[1:33:40] dwelleth in me
[1:33:42] I find then a law that when I would do
[1:33:44] good evil is present with me listen
[1:33:47] everything you want to do for God
[1:33:48] there's going to be something trying to
[1:33:49] keep you from doing it that's absolutely
[1:33:51] for sure
[1:33:52] he says for I Delight in the law of good
[1:33:54] after the inward man what he's saying
[1:33:56] I'm sincere I want to do the right thing
[1:33:59] but I see another law in my members in
[1:34:01] my body warring against the law of my
[1:34:03] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:34:05] the law of sin which is in my members o
[1:34:08] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:34:11] me from the body of this death
[1:34:13] next time you're having trouble say
[1:34:16] you're the body of this death
[1:34:18] let it know what it is you're stinking
[1:34:20] for flesh
[1:34:22] no good thing in it say you're good for
[1:34:24] nothing flesh
[1:34:28] but I love
[1:34:29] the next scripture in Romans 8 1 it says
[1:34:32] there's therefore now
[1:34:35] no condom condemnation
[1:34:37] to them who are in Christ
[1:34:39] I love how he takes us up
[1:34:42] this is where we'd be outside of the
[1:34:46] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:34:48] this is where we be
[1:34:50] and this is where you are if you haven't
[1:34:51] had the new birth oh wretched man or
[1:34:53] woman that I am who can deliver me I
[1:34:56] want to do good and I keep messing up I
[1:34:59] want to keep doing good and I keep
[1:35:01] messing up I go so far and I pull back I
[1:35:04] go so far and I pull back up and down in
[1:35:07] and out why are people so tossed about
[1:35:09] the prophet we preach amen why because
[1:35:11] they haven't come into that Haven of
[1:35:13] Rest they haven't come into Christ
[1:35:14] because there's no condemnation in there
[1:35:16] it'll settle them down amen
[1:35:19] listen it was impossible for the Jews
[1:35:21] but at least they had a promise
[1:35:24] we're Gentiles we're outside of the
[1:35:26] promise we had no bloodline to pull us
[1:35:28] in we had no promise of redemption to
[1:35:31] pull us in according to the Natural line
[1:35:33] the natural lineage of Abraham we are
[1:35:35] hooped we had no hope
[1:35:37] Ephesians 2 says that at that time ye
[1:35:39] were without Christ being aliens from
[1:35:42] the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[1:35:44] from the Covenant to promise having no
[1:35:46] hope and without God in the world we are
[1:35:49] dead in our sins and trespasses is what
[1:35:50] we were
[1:35:51] but for the grace of God Amen
[1:35:54] but for the grace of God and yet here we
[1:35:57] stand today
[1:35:58] Here We Stand today
[1:36:00] heirs and Joint heirs with Christ of the
[1:36:02] royal Seed of Abraham what by faith not
[1:36:06] by law but by faith
[1:36:08] so obviously he's done something since
[1:36:10] then hasn't he
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:14] what do we need we need somebody that
[1:36:16] didn't fall in the first place
[1:36:18] that's why the scripture pointed to a
[1:36:19] second Adam coming
[1:36:21] we needed a what a restart we need
[1:36:23] another kick at the can as we would say
[1:36:25] today we need another chance to do it
[1:36:27] and it's got to start with another atom
[1:36:29] it's got to start with another atom and
[1:36:31] if that atom won't fall then maybe he
[1:36:33] can keep the E from falling as well amen
[1:36:35] we know what God rich in his Mercy by
[1:36:38] his great love by which he loved us
[1:36:39] prepare to Lamb slain before the
[1:36:41] foundation of the world and I love the
[1:36:44] scripture in Romans 5 it says for when
[1:36:46] we were yet without strength
[1:36:48] in due time Christ died for the young
[1:36:51] God
[1:36:52] and God bless you as you can stand
[1:36:54] this evening
[1:36:58] and I hope we made it through that
[1:37:00] without too many scars
[1:37:03] amen but we're lost without them
[1:37:07] and until we realize we need him we're
[1:37:09] not going to get anywhere and every time
[1:37:11] we think we can make it on our own
[1:37:14] what happens we destroy something
[1:37:17] all we're doing is giving Satan access
[1:37:18] right back into our life the very thing
[1:37:20] that we kicked out amen we let it back
[1:37:22] in when we say we can do this on our own
[1:37:25] all he's looking for is us to realize
[1:37:27] that we've got to come back to him we
[1:37:30] got to let him do the redeeming work
[1:37:32] that we got to look to that sacrifice
[1:37:33] not to our own life
[1:37:35] that's the thing that'll cleanse your
[1:37:36] conscience
[1:37:38] is when you realize that when it came to
[1:37:40] the Redemptive sacrifice when it came to
[1:37:42] the sin offering they never looked at
[1:37:44] the sinner they always looked at the
[1:37:46] sacrifice amen
[1:37:48] point to the sacrifice
[1:37:50] not a Lord I'm doing so great Lord I'm
[1:37:52] doing so good look at me look at me look
[1:37:55] at me no they didn't want anybody
[1:37:56] looking at them when you're coming up
[1:37:58] there and you knew that that atonement
[1:38:00] had to be perfect you were never saying
[1:38:02] look at me you're saying look at the
[1:38:04] lamb I looked it over it's perfect it's
[1:38:07] of a perfect line it has no blemishes it
[1:38:10] has no flaws it has no physical
[1:38:12] deformities it's perfect perfect perfect
[1:38:15] and they would examine it you'd sit
[1:38:17] there and you'd hold your breath until
[1:38:18] they said it's perfect it's an
[1:38:20] acceptable sacrifice amen that's what
[1:38:22] we've got to do is point to him say Lord
[1:38:24] let that stand in your stead for me
[1:38:27] and put everything else don't look at me
[1:38:29] Lord look at the sacrifice amen let me
[1:38:31] be under the blood of that atonement
[1:38:33] amen amen let's just bow our heads
[1:38:36] Heavenly Father
[1:38:39] Lord It's hard sometimes
[1:38:42] to realize how lowly Lord how unable we
[1:38:45] are
[1:38:46] Lord we can't even pick ourselves up by
[1:38:48] our bootstraps and get out of this mess
[1:38:51] Lord we've got to realize that we're in
[1:38:52] a pit that's so deep we can't hope to
[1:38:54] climb out
[1:38:55] Lord that we need somebody else to get
[1:38:57] us out of this one
[1:38:59] but Lord what a wonderful thing it is to
[1:39:01] look at where we used to be
[1:39:03] Lord and now to stand here in the
[1:39:05] freedom of your spirit
[1:39:07] Lord the bloodbot church
[1:39:09] Lord raised out of death raised out of
[1:39:11] darkness and sin Lord raised out of our
[1:39:14] fallen Humanity Lord and taken into
[1:39:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Lord God
[1:39:19] Lord may we never forget it
[1:39:21] Lord may we always point to that
[1:39:23] sacrifice of Calvary Lord may we never
[1:39:26] get so lifted up in our walk or our
[1:39:28] experience or our gifts Lord our Deeds
[1:39:30] are actions that we do even in Your Name
[1:39:32] Lord that we'd ever think we're worthy
[1:39:34] of anything Boba may we point to that
[1:39:36] perfect sacrifice of Christ Lord may we
[1:39:39] stay under his blood each and every day
[1:39:41] we pray
[1:39:42] Lord knowing that you'll do a redeeming
[1:39:44] work for every one Lord whose name is
[1:39:46] written on the book that you took Lord
[1:39:48] just bless us now be with us we pray in
[1:39:51] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
[1:39:53] amen
