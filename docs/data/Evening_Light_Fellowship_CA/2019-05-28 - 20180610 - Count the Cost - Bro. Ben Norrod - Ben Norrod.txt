the word of the Lord sir appreciated the service last night amen appreciate the Lord and sir appreciate the weekend and we're looking forward to what the Lord will speak to us this morning and I just want to say thank you again to brother Gerald and the church body for receiving us and for all y'all allowing us to come in here and enjoy time with you and enjoy these services together I certainly appreciate being able to come for the less we're sure praying that the Lord would just take these meetings and just run you all up into a higher level amen and just a little higher and we're looking forward to not only what the Lord would give us this morning but we're looking forward to what he's gonna do in central this coming weekend and trusting you all will be praying for those services that the Lord will help us find his mind as of yet standing right here and I've been trying to get ready for months and months and months I still to this moment I have no idea what the Lord's want me to speak out there but I'm just waiting on him because I know he'll give it to me in the hour that I need it and I'm just trust I don't want to just stick something in the microwave and reheat it and take it out there you know and I wanted to be fresh from the Lord when we go in there and I of course I handle all sermons that way but I don't like serving leftovers amen I like it to come fresh from the throne of God trust in the Lord just give us that type of Revelation that type of understanding what we need to say and I want to ask you to pray for us on the mission field coming we got Africa coming up very very quickly in just a few weeks time I'll be leaving on the 27th for a convention there in the Congo and we're gonna be there just just a weekend convention just a few days time but again the services go from 8:00 in the morning to whenever the Sun Goes Down and if they decide to stay a while they'll stay a while they men and and so they're gonna be long and strenuous and they're gonna be a lot involved and we trust you'll pray there and then in July we return to Trinidad and then Guyana and then before the years out we're trust in the Lord will send us to Mexico and we talked about that a little bit last year with you but when we went to go write about the time we went to go we got a report from some of the Brethren stay out right now the political climate is not right and gang warfare and drugs and all kinds of stuff was happening and they said it's not safe don't come in just right now so we've been waiting about a year now I guess to get back into Mexico and looks like it's gonna work out maybe around September if the Lord will help us we're going to try to get there for a weekend meeting and maybe five or six days meeting something like that and then maybe once before we finish the year out we're trusting to go to West Africa again before the years out and then I don't know but we've got some other things on the agenda coming up in the beginning of the year some brethren are calling to come back into Europe again probably around the 1st of the year so I'm not exactly certain how all that's going to work out but I like to tell the body who likes to pray I like to tell them about it so you can help us pray and last time I went to Europe they made fun of me and they said yeah going to France yeah what a mission trip well you see what happened just after we left out there with all that with all that Charlie Hebdo or whatever his name was and all that terrorists and all that stuff so I told people these things aren't vacation time they're ministry of the Lord and the devil is right there on the field trying to attack it every way you can so be sure to pray and ask the Lord to help us and so we love you god bless you and we've enjoyed the last two services and the Capstone's are coming hey man we're looking for the Lord to come bring us a wonderful time this morning enjoyed all the singing this weekend enjoyed all these songs [Music] the Holies of heaven call me to mentions right across the sea [Music] [Applause] [Music] the holy of heaven call me to mentions right across the sea we're loved ones and crowds are given and the here's at home are calling me this house of flesh its butts oppressor bars of gold pull my soul but the doors my god ah [Music] my spear [Music] I'll take my [Music] my ego [Music] and I see

I'm glad Jesus did just carry the cross but it carried me as well [Music] once upon his back he knew this was the beginning of the end with every fragile step he grew more and more determined to finish the world saw a man with the tree on his back [Music] oh but God saw his son we loved Terry more [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] costed me [Applause] [Music] so much has been said [Music] [Applause] he didn't just carry the cross [Music] merci help my broken heart clothes against his shoulders he wept love beyond one moment scarred the hands and the feet of [Music] the world saw man time harder between [Music] but God saw his son bridge the cap [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] just across [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's stand together this morning I'll praise the Lord Amen I'm so glad that he that he carried us amen Alleluia one thing's for sure we could have never carried ourselves that's for sure it took him to carry us amen I want to speak to you this morning upon those little words that we sang in that song counting the cost counting the cost Luke chapter 14 verse 28 I want to start there on verse 28 29 and 30 then the Lord helping us I want to try to drop down a few little scriptures here and just just a short moment but I've got a lot of Mon try to get through this morning the Lord helping us and I'm in a hurry now I'm just gonna take my time and preach and one of the brothers said to me they said we gonna wring you out I said well there's a lot to wring there's a lot to wring but we're looking forward to what the Lord will speak to us now alright you're reading with me Luke 14 verse 28 for which of you intending to build a tower setteth not down first and counted the cost whether he has sufficient to finish him lest happily after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it began to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish him better to start something and finish rather than to start it and not be able to complete him now the word that he uses here for counting it means in the Greek word of the way that they defined this type of counting they would count with pebbles count with pebbles pebbles to compute calculate to reckon to give one's vote by casting a pebble into an urn or decide by voting so many times when they would count they would take like a little like a steel urn like this and they would put pebbles into it and a lot of they would keep count by just counting the stones so if they want to know for example how many certain things they've done they just look in there and they could count what it was that they done we use calculators and all these different types of methods today but this is one of the methods that they use so Jesus here saying that if a man would build a tower he would actually look as it was into this urn to see if he had the ability to finish what it was that he began we call it taking inventory of ourselves it's what we call it but now notice the word that he uses here is to count by casting pebbles now I want to reach ya the message God had explained brother Brent says here on page 12 you must test your motive and objective first first find the will of God and that's exactly what all of us are searching for in our lives everyday we're looking for the will of God it isn't something that just happens once I told somebody here not long ago finding the will of God is an everyday task for us as the people of God and God expects us to find that will too and he said then find your objective your objective and then test your motive test your motive to see if your motive is right Amen that's right let's let's pray over the word this morning while your heads are bowed I just wonder how many in here would have a special need on your heart you'd like to be remembered just by the lifting of your hand my hands up as well Lord Jesus we love you this morning Father we are so happy to know that you by your grace and your mercy has made provisions for us as the people of God Lord there's so many things that is your bride we could stand here and just rejoice and glory over as it was appropriately said yesterday time would fail us of the testimonies that we have of what you've done for us in our lives and Lord Jesus we stand here once again coming now to the capstone to the benediction to the closing of these weekend meetings in Lord Jesus with a few hours that remain us in this weekend time we're asking that you will come orden up those hours with your presence and with revelation of your spirit and may your Holy Spirit come this morning pray and take me into your hands as clay Lord I might be molded to saying act and behave in the way that be most pleased with that be a blessing to your children Lord if maybe I would go this way in my thoughts but Lord you want me to go in opposite direction I yield myself to you Lord to do whatever it is you want to do this morning and lord I pray for your children out there today Lord that are setting their needs and their heart god or they're looking for your spirit to come and do great things for each thing that the Holy Ghost will not let a one leave here unsatisfied Oh God but every uplifted hand every heart every representative Lord will leave out of here full with the Spirit of God just overflowing from their cup into their saucer Oh God that Lord that others might want to drink of the glory of the Living God living out of their lives we commit ourself to you this morning father we're asking that your Holy Spirit come and take the further part of this service Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you may be seated one thing I believe that we're noticing in the message as we call it or in the ranks of the message is that as we go on in time people for the most part start out very well they go pretty good for a while and they seem to be in it for a while but then after a period of time something happens and they start trailing off we call it backsliding and get colder sometimes they get more distance they get more removed from the house of God they get in a place where they're discouraged and they don't really know how to bring themselves to the place of feeling the enthusiasm the joy the Lord like they used to and we realize that those things are a natural part of Christianity the falling back the backsliding the getting cold that's a natural part of Christianity now it's not something that we should accept as status quo it's not something we should accept as the ultimate of our lives but it is a evident fact that if you are a human being with the Holy Ghost at some point in your life you're going to get discouraged you're going to get depressed you're going to get upset you're gonna feel like things aren't working in your order and actually friends suffering is built-in to the Christian life for example you take a computer when you buy a computer it might have a certain type of program programmed into it maybe a Windows program or something from Microsoft or an Apple type setup all of that is pre-programmed into that computer so when you hit the power button and the things fires up and you see the Apple signal or the Windows or HP or whatever it is there would be all of that that was placed in and woodall way to be to be there and ready at your disposal and the same thing in a Christian life suffering is built-in to our Christian life it is built-in to our experience with God and when God as it was push the button all of this was a part of our walk with God and they asked for the brennaman questions and answers about these type of things and you know brother branham is that normal is it something we're supposed to be going through and you hear the prophets say over and over again yes of course it is he said it's as though the devil has a bull's-eye and he's aiming right at you and every gun in Haley said training on you when you received the Holy Ghost so we know that it is a natural part of the order of God for us to be in a fight because you realize that when Peter picks it up with these virtues behind us here and he takes this about the character and the nature of God in the heart of the bride you realize that the character of an individual is developed by suffering it is not developed by their study or their memory of the word that is your soul feeding on the word of course but your character is developed in the things that you suffer now in when I was preaching last night speaking about the Lord being a healer to us and a deliverer to us and many of these types of things that we seek after we expect God sometimes to take us out of these circumstances but the truth of the matter is is that many times the Holy Spirit will put you in a situation he will place you in a circumstance that many times seems impossible and it is for your good and for your benefit ultimately that he sticks you in such a condition and many times we pray old God take me out of it take me out of it take me out of it but yet if we knew from eternity scope what that battle or that circumstance or that trial would do for your Christian character we would say God double it up make it triple make it more than what it is if we could see it from eternity view but yet all of these things that we suffer we must realize is a normal part of a Christian experience now we know what Peter said about how that when a man a woman suffers and they go through hard things he tells the people of God in that first century think it not strange that you go through fiery trials in other words he's telling them the same thing I'm telling you this morning that being a Christian has all of this accompanied with it don't ever think that you're going to escape trials and tribulations and suffering in this life it is through those adversaries and adversities of life that we are developed into the man and woman that we are today and thank God for we don't like going through it when we're going through it but I sure like what I see out of my life after I go through hard things hey man don't you now we look at the way the prophet of God said this about our motive and our objective now in tying a lot of these type of thoughts together about a Christian character and about trials and tribulations you know a lot of what we go through comes down to a couple elements and one of those elements is is it a trial sin from God or is it something that you put yourself through you know there's a lot of things we bring upon ourself because we just make silly decisions and we don't do the thing we ought to do but then there are trials that come from God that are predestinated trials that God has sent to the person's life and I want to read to you now out of a message called anointing once at the end time and I want you to listen the way brother Branham answers you remember the story how that when lavell was sending there with him in the restaurant and he was talking about a certain man saying certain things to him and he begins speaking about how that habit you know that was me brother branham I wouldn't put up with that I'd handle it this way he said he's a little bit too quick on the trigger but then brother Bram says it this way he said I'm wondering brother Lee said to him how can you take it like that that involves your family I said all mine brother Lee that was a predestinated trial before the foundation of the world so you see a lot of these aspects of our walk of our journey as we spoke about last night being on this narrow way it is a rugged way it is a difficult way and brother lives that were sitting here this morning knowing that every footstep we take has been ordered by Almighty God you remember one of the messages I brought to you here when I first came to Newfoundland about the direction of our life and how David said that every footstep even our rises and our Falls are ordained of God the fall in the Garden of Eden for example last night as we looked at Eve coming in to a predestinated place where she was going to fall there was no way that Eve could escape that program it was the predestinated program for her life to listen to the devil's reasoning to fall to Satan's wisdom and to bring sin into this world God ordained it to be just that way now I know how people think sometimes in their minds they have a tendency thing well glory to God this man committed adultery that was a predestinated thing from the hand of God many times friends those are things that the Bible said we are drawn away by our own lust and that's what creates a lot of these situations but when it is a trial predestinated by god it is ordained to bring character out of your hearts all hallelujah amen it is ordained to bring things out of our hearts now watch this in Psalm 34 verse 17 watch David said the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and deliver them out of all of their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save as such as be of a contrite spirit and many are the afflictions of the righteous on the church said a man but the Lord delivereth them out of him out of them all a man now you notice here that all of these things that David speaks of he never once says that God is going to take trouble away from us that is going to take afflictions away from us that you'll never have issues you'll never have problems and many times we try to create this imagery of Christianity and the message that if a man or woman is serving God and living for God oh they'll be wealthy and everybody will like them and all their family will get saved and you'll be walking through Walmart and people will be repenting because of the glory of God coming out of your soul then when we get saved we find out people hate us we're broke as a Amen broke as we can be poor as a church house mouse our family don't want to speak to us no more and instead of repenting people are cussing at you well hallelujah somebody it's exactly the opposite of what we try to paint it up to be because we realize we are in a warfare did you know that this is not a picnic we're not here to eat cookies and so forth this is a battleground hey man look at Paul in Ephesians chapter 6 whenever he begins to take the soldier and dress him up he takes his sword puts it in his hand puts a helmet on his head put shoes on his feet puts breastplate Gerdes his loins gives him everything he needs to fight as a Christian soldier but then Peter is going to turn right around and now he's gonna put character in that soldier because you realize if you got a sword in your hand but you don't have no character you'll cut the wrong head off if you got a shield on your arm you'll use it in the wrong way if you don't have Christian character to accompany these things of God so as Jesus said in the opening text then we as the people of God must take inventory them as they would take a stone and they would drop it in okay we've got this we've got that we've got the materials we got the nails we got the wood we can build this tower as a Christian would take inventory so are we to take inventory of who we are and where we are in the economy of God we must look at where we're at because friends I find many times that there is a balance between blessed are they that are hungry and thirsty and a balance between such as that and then also being content in the state where with God has called you many times a man a woman gets saved or you sort of serving the Lord and within a month they want to be a manifested son of God the fact of the matter is it takes years it takes years to develop a proper Christian character in the hearts of the people of God and we cry of course to the Lord O God O God do things in me change things in me O God make me different and what we're really saying by that is that we want the Lord in an overnight get rich quick type scheme to be able to change us in a moment's time well let me tell you it took six thousand years to get us in the mess we're in and we ain't going to get out of it in six minutes come on somebody we're going to have to struggle we're going to have to fight come on now we're going to have to wrestle until that Christian character is developed in our life and it's important for you and I to have the patience and to have a longevity and to have a long-term vision of where we are going in the kingdom of God this is why Jesus told us count the cost count the cost remember that if you're going to be all-in as the world says and you're gonna do commit and dedicate yourself 100% to God that this is a long haul thing that this is not I'm going to serve God today and be in the rapture tomorrow no you're going to go through probably years of tribulation you're going to have years of ups years of down years of this years of that and God is going to develop your character that's what the Bible said right here every trouble he lets you go through every affliction he lets you suffer he will deliver you out of it all hallelujah but we've got to endure it in order to finish this building of God it's hard for some people to accept what I'm preaching this morning because they just don't want to work I have found that Christians on the average and I don't mean this naturally I mean it's spiritually they can be some of the laziest people you've ever seen in your life you know we've got an age where you can push a button and find 500 statements on the rapture it's easy for us to live a Christian life according to the technological mindset of things it's easy for us to sit people talk about not coming to church I've always wondered what in the world is so difficult about coming to church you sit in a Pew for two hours and do nothing I mean it ain't like I'm asking you to swing sledgehammers this morning you're sitting there listening you're not exerting most of you ain't even sweat and except for charity amen praise the Lord somebody a man and me too brother Chad that's why I got this handkerchief towel up here you don't have some Matt amen some of us do a little work some of us just come and hang out amen we're here a part of the a part of the gang a part of the service oh but I can't go to church I'm too tired they're gonna sit in the Barcalounger why not set in the pew it'll do you some good hey man that's exactly right but it's the devil you see what Satan does he puts it in the minds of the people oh it's just too much for me I've never understood how that somebody can sit down and watch a video for two and a half hours but can't read one chapter out of their Bible of a morning and one chapter of a night oh it's so difficult it's so hard no it's the devil's trying to keep you from the blessings of God that lay out yonder that's what it is amen so many are the afflictions of the righteous watch this in a message called my commission the Prophet talks about this woman a discernment here he said I see that you've never been satisfied with yourself in the way that you tried to serve God now many of us can identify with that remark I'm sure because all of us we look at our lives and we say man I just think where I need to be man I've never been satisfied with where I'm at watch the Prophet said you've always wanted a deeper walk with God now watch these next words he said because I see a shadow following your path a shadow following your path so there's always this type of mindset for a Christian especially with a Christian who has a heart that really wants to serve the Lord you always feel like that you're always short of where you need to be and you're always failing and falling and coming you know short of the glory of God and what more and you always feel like oh I'll never achieve but yet when you look at it through a turn of this view you are exactly right now in the place where God wants you this very moment even though you feel like you're not there yet you're exactly where God wants you oh you said that's crazy no it's not if you don't want to hire here to put you hi-c friends the problem is and I I'm just gonna say this this may pinch a little bit it's true the problem is is that often we want to control our own walk with God we cannot control our walk with God like you control that thermostat back there I got one of them little dials in that room Carson's got me in I reach over it's too cold I just cranked it that way too hot I cranked it that way we want to handle Christianity that way oh I want to be more of God so I just crank my little dial and I'll be more of God I'll read more I'll pray more how fast more our study more but that's not how you get character character comes with suffering God is the one that controls those elements he's the one that's got your thermostat in his hand Oh God y'all get any quieter I'm just about to preach to myself this morning huh hey man that's right but we think to our cept klore to God I'm a message believer yes but why are you a message believer because God saw in your life that he had character inside of you he had something inside of you that he could work with himself remember we are the clay he is the Potter not the other way around but here this woman this shadow following her life and why was it following her life because the devil was haunting this woman all you need to be more you need to be this you need to be that so what they do to walk around most of the time in a miserable condition oh I'm never the Christian I need to be oh I'm just not now listen there's a difference my friends in hungry for God to do something in you and then there's a difference between that and that's just whining and complaining we ain't what we want to be oh god it's gonna be hard this morning whoo help me Jesus help me Lord oh we digging taters this morning a man I'm already digging deep hey hey man that's right amen now sometimes you have to understand that when the Holy Spirit moves on you and says you ain't livin where you need to live there's something in you says god that's right I want to be better but you also realized that the devil likes to hold things over your head he's slick friends and he can make you feel like because you ain't where you need to be and make you feel like because you ain't in some certain spot but listen God is the one that grows you remember Paul watered Apollo's planted but it was God that gave the increase you cannot increase yourself you can't make yourself greater well hallelujah I I need to get some virtue and I need to get some knowledge in my life so I'm gonna read four more books imma listen to six more tapes well that's good fertilizer that's good vitamins and nutrients that's good water the Holy Spirit to put on there but you go bring the increase God someone brings the increase in friends I wonder if we just press ourself too deeply into things trying to move beyond the predestinated part that God's got us playing right now Oh preach brother been a man exactly right and remember let me just say it in a very simplified way if you're on faith you're gonna you're not gonna be on brotherly kindness tomorrow not unless God want you to be listen you know the only thing that grows fast don't you a weed a real plant grows slow because it takes time to develop everything that it needs hallelujah to become what it needs to become a weed is what grows up overnight and then you go out and weed your garden today I hate the garden I hate it I love doing the garden part I hate weeds I've got to pull the crazy things before midnight you got a whole host of them more I hate weeds in a church amen you spend all your time pulling weeds and you know what you don't have no time to deal with the real plants in the church oh god I should have said that but it's the truth anyhow hey man that's right you got all you got a real plant set in there and if you ain't careful you'll spend all your time pulling weeds up oh they they they got all kinds of potential to move and and they're movers and shakers as the world says but a real plant it takes time to invest in it the qualities that need to become what it needs to become and if you want to be a real Christian it ain't gonna come overnight and it shouldn't come overnight if it's done right it should take time it should take time to become where we need to come to and I wonder sometimes that the devil just doesn't torment us to a place to thinking oh you should be so much further you see things have come along and you'll get upset and you'll lose your temper next thing you know you've done unchristian eyes yourself well you have no control over any of that God gave you the Holy Ghost didn't it did you give it to yourself oh god you done forgot even how say a man doesn't wanna come on you didn't give yourself the Holy Ghost did you anybody hear birth himself into the kingdom of God anybody I'm gonna put my hand up because it took grace to get me where I am to grace to get you where you are well if I've got so many qualities in my life and I'm I'm ordained to be a certain type of way and God made me with a certain type of makeup then all I can do is take the word into my soul feed on that word of God and trust God the increase will come friends if I see that I still got a short temper the Prophet said sweeten it with prayer but until he gives me increase till I can raise to a level to overcome it I don't need me walking around going oh I'm in fighting temper I've been having problems I've been I've been that yes you may realize and recognize that all of these things are evident in your life but it takes God to give you the ability to overcome that thing hey man you can't make yourself grow and sometimes we say Oh God take his temper away maybe God's letting you wrestle with it for a while for a purpose oh hey man maybe that strain that God put in your life maybe it's there for a reason maybe God like Paul would say to you three times Lord I asked you to take his thing away even if we could hear God say to Paul Paul I'm the one in charge not you just to just be quiet and let me handle the business you know how doesn't reel away we look at one another we wish one another would be better you can't wish on that what Jesus say you can't even add to your stature by taking thought you can't add to one another oh I wish they'd do this I wish they'd do that sure pray for them and say God if they're in a certain condition they are there because there is a reason you put him there amen it's like I sat down here at the piano last night we had prayer and was praying and I sat down at the piano and Samantha accidentally left her book up there and and I pulled the cover over and on the front of that cover it said God makes all things beautiful in his time and I thought that's exactly right you see things going on in people's lives you see situations coming up in a certain way and you see things arise and you say to yourself oh god I wish it wasn't that way but if you could look at it through eternity as view there's a reason that person or that church or that individual is in the situation that they're in God is doing it for a purpose because God knows what kind of character he needs to get out of his people don't know that we can do is trust him and I don't mean we don't quit read and pray and studying and fighting and battling and pressing and being present like the woman of the unjust judged I don't mean we don't quit coming and we stop all of a sudden I'm not going to fight no more no that didn't they don't mean that but it means don't walk around with a cloud over you all the time and the shadow you over you all the time oh I wish I was a better Christian you know I'm convinced that some people absolutely love being miserable and if they can walk around tell everybody what a bad Christian they feel like they are I think they they feel like they get glory out of that somehow if people feel sorry for him pay attention to him or something like that well glory to God anyhow amen but it's a Christian I shouldn't be walking around and saying oh I should be much more we should I had the attitude that little black woman habit been talked about she said I ain't what I ought to be she said but I ain't what I used to be either hey man but I'm marching on I'm gonna become whatever God wants me to become by His grace by His mercy but many times we like to wallow in self-pity yeah three head nods two eye blinks and a few a man's everything doing pretty good still we hanging in there that's right we like to wallow in self-pity oh I wish I was more I wish I was this hey listen all of us feel that way as Christians we do I feel like right now here I've been serving God the majority of my life and I feel like I'm just getting started after all these years some of you all have been in this longer and I have I know you feel the same way I do even like man I'm just getting started but then if I can take confidence in God put me in a situation he put me in a spot in time where he exactly wants me at that time I've got to trust that I got to have confidence in that because I sure can't change it if I do I don't want to end up in the belly of a whale because anytime anybody tries to change the will of God you find out what happens over and over and over again so what must I do I must count the cost I must take inventory of where I am as a child of God if I look at where I come from I look at what God's done for me I may not like where I'm at right now but if I look in the past and see what is done it gives me hope he's gonna do more for me in the future amen it's just like people suffering with all kinds of illnesses and things of that nature you take a man a woman I read a thing this morning where they talked about somebody losing a fight with lung cancer I thought but for a Christian that's not losing a battle if they died and they go by the way of the grave the moment they take a breath and that's the often in body they've been healed amen they're not suffering with divine or with with lung cancer anymore they've been healed in their body is perfect for take a doctor and put it on that theophany and try to put a scope on that the often in see percent lung cancer in it in aspect of it it's a healed body and man it's a perfect body it's a word body so for us it's not losing the battle you look at these people down through the through the martyr ISM when they would stand there and they would preach while they're being burn at the state they would testify while they're being fed to lions we said what about your losers but the less the world's view the prophet of God said they were heroes of faith a man died as a hero in the faith of God imagine Paul with his head laying around Nero's chopped block you thought boy I didn't see myself here today this isn't where I thought I should be but he was exactly where God wanted him that's what we have to take confidence and that every step that we take in this life there's a reason behind why God's doing it I know it's hard for us to accept that sometimes but there's a reason why now let me keep reiterating to you that doesn't mean that we just give up and throw our hands up and say oh well you know whatever and however not only we keep fighting we keep struggling we keep pressing but we there there must be a balance there you understand I'm trying to say to you we must be able to balance between struggling and hungry and thirsting and being burdened and having all of this in our heart and another part of us needs to be resting saying okay Lord I'm burdened I want to be more but I've got confidence you're in control oh praise the Lord I hope you see in daylight that's the thing that will bring us to the fruition of a child of God is that the husband had long patience waiting for the former in the latter rain amen God ain't worried here but biting his fingernails off thinking why in the name of God aren't they doing better he knows exactly where we are today he knows exactly why we are the way we are again some things we do is that appear stubbornness just because we don't want to do right that's when our daddy whips us I've had many a spanking because I don't listen the way I should listen it has nothing to do with my predestinated plan of God that's a disobedient child and he's gonna be dealt with if he's disobedient Amen I told the little Church Wednesday night I said you know the way you deal with bratty children's a shot and sit down I thought they're gonna pass out on me I said you must not tell your kids to shut up Amen but I said God does sometimes God looks I'm gonna zip it and you better zip it boy because I'm happy if you don't oh yeah God ain't always nice to us sometimes he's rough sometimes he's hard did you know the prophet of God said that sometimes God gets some mad at us he feels like kicking us well friends I'm sorry you didn't know that was in a message but it's been in there for 60 years Amen that's right since frustrated with us not because we're not maybe a child of God not because we're not Christians but because we fall away from staying in the course that God wants us to stay and we've got to keep our steps moving forward always remember them for living creatures they were always moving forward never moving backwards amen and if I'm moving forward what did the Bible say if I've done all that I know how to do to stand if I've counted all of my pebbles and I've done everything I'm supposed to do I may not be way down the rule but where I'm at I'm gonna keep on building keep on working keep on moving forward because eventually hallelujah God it's going to help me finish this word amen I got my hammer in my hand I got my nails in my head Sam and I we went through we went through purgatory I called it amen and that is the word I used is purgatory Shore down what seven years ago six years ago I was in the house and I had a had an old little skinny looking closet thing and that had closet on one side of the wall and on this side was a little tiny little pantry thing listen friends the noron family likes to eat we can't handle little pantries they don't work it's odd made a decision I said I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna gut the thing out I'm gonna build a nice big walk-in pantry for sister Sam and so when I walked in there I pulled everything out gutted the thing kicked the walls in sledgehammer didn't I get my hands on and I pushed the floor on the floor was mushy and I look at my brother-in-law and I said that ain't good is it uh-uh about time we got done peeling it we had a hole the size of this church whether previous owners that let a water heater bust and then everything was robbed there were six layers of flooring on my kitchen floor six layers there was linoleum there was indoor/outdoor carpet in between linoleum I said welcome to the south hallelujah I mean I've never seen nothing like it we we dug and crowbarred and scraped and knife blade I mean we done everything we could and we gutted this thing and I get so frustrated because we'd be Church time and I'd be halfway down in a hole I'd be covered with mud I'd have just enough time to get in there and wrench myself off we had to support the floor we had to repair joists we had to do all kinds of things and I used to get so frustrated and I remember one morning I was in Iowa preached of her brother Isaiah Brooks and I was so frustrated with that house and I it's on my mind so bad I could think get that thing done get over with and I even got the preaching on it I guess I'm still preaching on today and I got in my mind I thought why can't I get this thing done God why don't you help me get this thing finished and while I was standing the platform the Holy Spirit spoke the words right through my mouth God makes all things beautiful in his time I didn't realize it but it was a life lesson for being nor odd I needed to learn that things aren't done overnight because I'm an impatient person I want it done yesterday amen I don't like to wait around on things you know if listen I've got it under control okay I've got victory when it comes to being impatient but they don't mean it don't bug me there are times that I get so impatient I've got to bite my lips all right boy you hold on hold on don't you don't you aren't you settle down hey I got it under control by God's grace I've got victory over the thing I thank the Lord for that but things don't happen overnight that's one of the first lessons you've got to learn as a Christian sometimes it takes time for God to do things I imagine that maybe when Abraham first heard from the Lord he was looking for a body change oh say about midnight that night if the Lord would have told him it had been 25 years before he got his body changed wonder how he too reacted to that but you know the Bible said Abraham walked with God and staggered not even though he himself in that Old Testament time he had doubts he even laughed at God when God told him he was going to do it he fell I did everything that Sarah did but when his divine commentary was wrote he said God looked on him as the father of faith he swaggered not do unbelief he believed God to the promise of God it goes to prove that many times in our mind when we think oh I'm never going to get there I'm never just keep on building keep on working count the cost put another pebble in the urn I'm one more step ahead than what I was yesterday drop one more pebble and okay now I'm moving on I'm doing a little bit better in Jesus Christ because if you're not careful the devil will become a shadow to you and it will haunt you all the days of your life and remember the devil will never let you forget yesterday he don't know what tomorrow holds the only thing he knows is yesterday so he'll never let you forget it he can't look into the future and tell you what's going to happen tomorrow oh he knows what the Bible said but he didn't tell you about your future he doesn't know what's going to happen from one day to the next the only thing he's got is yesterday and he uses it to the best of his advantage he reminds you of every time you sat mom and dad or but every time you lied or that candy bar you stole when used for tea nor ever what it was or that time such-and-such happened and you got mad and said bad word oh he reminds you of all of that kind of stuff amen but he'll never know your future God is the one that knows our future he's got it in the palms of his hands so it doesn't do me any good to get frustrated and say well I'll tell you oh I'm terrified it's a better question I am exactly where God wants me as long as I'm not moving backwards I am riding the predestinated will of God oh thank you Jesus amen you heard him singing this morning the song service I believe that a song leader led by the Holy Ghost is setting the stage many times for the message coming if you listen close to the songs you'll hear the the will of God being sang through them songs of what he's going to preach about let me read this to you out of second Corinthians 12 8 9 let's just see if the Lord was talking in the song service or not for this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it may depart from me and he's said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee from my strength is made perfect in weakness anybody remembers singing that this morning that's a Holy Ghost lead song leader right there amen these notes laying in here he don't know I don't tell him I don't tell nobody I don't even let Sam taste the sauce I'm a selfish chef when it comes to preaching amen amen I don't want you to eat until time to eat it Amen I don't even let you get a smell out of the kitchen I just bottle it all up and hold it in him Amen i don't want the devil to get ahold of it see because if he gets a hold of any starts of making all kinds of havoc and working on people this way and that way oh he's a good adversary he knows how to muddle things up and mix things up but I'll tell you when I see the Holy Ghost taking charge of the service I think Satan you ain't got a foothold on none of us amen and that's what I saw this morning when the songs are being sang all the little specials in the way the Holy Spirit was moving just listed the words and them saw how they're connecting with what I'm preaching you hear this morning and then my grace is sufficient in other words Paul don't be nothing more than you hate I am what I am by the grace of God well I want to be more yes you may want to be more but you cannot be more of yourself you have to wait till God brings you up a little bit higher the only thing you can do is make sure you're not going backwards make sure I'm in the faith make sure I'm counting the costs I'm taking inventory of where I'm at I'm not losing I'm not losing I may not be gaining but I'm not losing praise the Lord hey this goes to a lot of things weight loss I have got on that scale for a month now and that scale is from the devil did you know that Satan created a weight scale I'm convinced that was the first invention he gave to torment a man or a woman there's an old stupid scale I hate the thing I get on there and it ain't moved I mean I I'm running I'm jumping rope I'm doing all kinds of things I'm climbing mountains I'm you know I'm doing all of this and that scale ain't moved a bit and I hate the thing I hate it but then I have to talk to myself and say but I'm not gaining weight either it works on almost the opposite you know flip that over a little bit that's the way it is in Christianity I'm not backsliding I may not be moving forward so I must be in the perfect will of God where I am right now you have to look at these things friends if you don't study this you'll walk around discouraged all the time and I heard a preacher for many many years every time he got in the platform he said I just wonder about my own self I said God there ain't no hope for the rest of us then because if the leader don't know where he's at where the rest of them are gonna be a mint we must be content with where God has placed us and if there's gonna be more the Lord will reveal that to you he'll bird in your heart put something in you you need more and you start striving and when he puts the burden on you to move forward he'll take you in to that next step but you can't force yourself into it let me quote to you what brother Branham said about a chicken he said you cannot peep that chicken out of that egg he said if you do you'll kill it it has to come out on its own you can't rush the process you can't rush it you can look down there and say I wish that chicken would hatch you you may have on your mind you know Mary brown chicken you may have on your mind chicken dinner maybe Thanksgivings are coming eight you might want to slaughter that chicken and put it on the table put some thyme and some rosemary and some butter all over that thing oh god I'm hungry a man but you might want all of that but if you peep that chicken out of that egg you're gonna kill that chicken it'll never develop it'll never come to birth do you realize most of the animals today when they try to rush them to the table that's one thing is killing our bodies so much because they'll take an old chicken said let it eat grain they'll pump a bunch of steroids into it and put this thing into it feed it this type of deal that put them under lights and grow them up real super super fast and it's out of the natural process of that bird and their breasts and their legs and thighs and what more are so big they they break their legs and they fall in they can't even hardly walk in the yard because they pumping them up making them bigger that's about the way some people would like to be with Christianity Oh God make me a super Christian you better take your time you better take your time and get all of the elements that you can get get them right remember what that Indian told brother branham he said welcome welcome wants look them twice you're better - you're better to study where you're at count the cost of where you are rather than rush into something and make shipwreck that's right you know it's just like when people try to come to Christ they come to the altar and they pray nothing against then I'm not I'm not throwing off they kind of the altar and they pray and then they walk out the door and they're looking for the devil you know hey listen I appreciate that the determination you call it I appreciate the aggressive ad I've wanted to be a child of God like that but you better remember the devil they're going after has been going after man for six thousand years he ain't no it was brother Carroll you say ain't no dumb bunny he knows how to fight he's very slick he's very mean he's very selfish and he'll stop at nothing to take you to hell and to do everything he can to destroy your life so us jumping up from the otter where's that devil out in a month from now we're walking in there oh god I pray he never heard me say it because Satan will fight you to the bitter end the moment you make a confession there's going to be a battle that follows that confession we have to know what we're talking about that's why I fear that around the ranks of the message we've got to a place we hand somebody a book hand him a bunch of tapes get him to repeat a few catchphrases and glory to God there a message believer and what have we done we've pumped the chicken up so much it ain't got no legs to stand on it ain't got no foundation underneath it what the Bible say to strengthen and establish and settle you in the foundation as a child of God you must be settled before you take your next steps it's like walking a tightrope see you got one foot you better make sure that foot stable before you put the next foot in front because any step you could fall off you've got to know that your foundation is right before you can move on in spiritual things amen we save glory to God ah I was healed last night praise the Lord wonderful thank God for it but remember after you've made that testimony after you've made that confession Satan's going to be listening he's going to be coming after you and the Prophet said in divine healing you may get sicker in three days time than you'd ever been in your entire life he said that doesn't mean that God didn't heal you it just means this is a part of the programming this is what we've got to experience you must count the cost as a child of God just say yes I've made my confession and I'm willing to go through whatever it takes to be able to win God's grace in this matter amen you've got to count the cost because if you can't finish the building the Bible said they'll laugh at you they'll make fun of you oh you know how it is all sure so I read these forums sometimes not all the time but every day every now and then they come up with something you know with this on the believe the sign group and these are defectors that have come in every night and I'll try to read some of their comments when a new one shows up and it's the same old thing the same old way and they've come in a typical message person typical message person and I thought one of these days I'm gonna ask that bunch who are you getting your evidence from you're talking to the wrong people the people you're talking to are the ones that couldn't live right never went to church never paid a dollar tithe in their life they was always out doing things of the world and and and run into every prayer line in the country running to every camp meeting in the country they never had any stability and yet you're using them as your plumb line for those that believed the message let's talk to me a while I've been in 27 years I'm a better example than they are if I want to talk to some of you you're a better example than they are you've been in at 40 years some of you 50 years some of you come on now but they use their example they want to use somebody that never had the Holy Ghost they want to use them as their example of the message you got to count the cost if a man a woman is gonna live right and live for God and listen friends it's not the Baptist that about the greatest reproach upon this message it hasn't been the Methodist that had been the Pentecostals it's been message people that has brought the reproach upon this message because they don't want to live to the level they're supposed to live to because everybody wants to rush into be manifested sons of God and speaking squirrels and controlling storms and this that the other but they don't want to learn how to pray they don't want to learn how to love one of those one another they don't want to they don't want to learn these principles that make a man as firm founded Christian we've got to have the right foundation underneath us or I don't care how beautiful the building is it'll topple at one point remember of oh Jesus give the parable about the man that had his house bid on the rock and the man that built his house on the sand if you read the scripture you'll find out that the storm vehemently beat against both houses the storm is coming whether we like it or not it's programmed into Christianity amen the devil's going to fight anything that looks like God but we've got to be confident that we're standing on a firm foundation am I where I want to be absolutely not I want to be well on higher up the ladder but I'm not backsliding therefore I must be where God wants me at this present time if you ain't careful you'll have a cloud following you a dark shadow following you're trying to get you in a condition to say oh you see you know how it is this time preaching to the choir here I know that but I know how it is you want you in the middle of the night sometimes you wake up and a thought hits your mind you're discouraged with yourself you're upset with yourself why did I waste years and why did I do this what yes we have regrets we have things that we've all failed in but if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost God is faithful to you right now this very moment God is faithful to put you where you need to be you've got to have confidence you've got to trust God that where you are right now is exactly where he wants you to be because anything else he'll reveal it to you that's why we get burden in our hearts sometimes and and some things Torm innocent and work on us sometimes God is trying to tell you it's time to come up higher and then there are times that we're tormenting ourselves sometimes we're trying to beat at the air trying to make things happen that ain't never going to happen right you've got to test your motive test your objective testify to all of the things that God has done for you and testify of what he's doing in your life now but expect more tomorrow amen because God is always moving he's always expanding where you are today will not be where you are tomorrow because God's got a whole lot more out there for us tomorrow but God don't let me move until it's time for me to move right you see this little thing right here patience you know brother branham said about that guy he said when you really get Holy Ghost patience he said you learn to let God be your next crossing thing he said you don't move until you see God moving we see God move then you step right up with him we need a whole lot of that this more we need to learn to wait on him for the next cues of our life you know how it is some of you parents in here you look down you seen your kids and you wish they'd be a whole lot more and if you start drilling at them and beating at them and fussing I don't want you anymore on what you are you're not going to get him that way overnight you have to train them you have to work with them you have to teach them we take for granted sometimes we think everybody knows what we know some people just think God it yet Oh God hallelujah some people just ain't there yet you have to teach them you have to train them you have to bring them up into the things of God right and spiritual children are the same way you have to teach him what's right teach him what's true in the Bible when I watch this in 2nd chapter 13 verse 3 Paul said since she seek proof of Christ speaking in me which to you word is not weak but is mighty in you for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God for we also are weak in him amen but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves no you're not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobates so Paul is saying if you want to know where you are now count the cost look in your urn see what how many pebbles you got in there are you missing pebbles is God got a bunch more pebbles to put in there and you're just not putting them in there examine yourself well I'm not where I should be true but are you that way because your backsliding argue that way because you're not trying are you that way because you're not praying are you that way because you're not working listen I saw a whole bunch of folks at work here last night they put their coveralls on and they went down in the trenches put their mining hat on they got to work I saw a lot of people up here working last night so don't be discouraged if you're working and you don't feel like you're moving you just keep standing there and keep mining away you'll get a gold nugget after a while God will see to it he brings the increase but examine yourself am I going backwards if you are something's wrong you need to move forward then right because God doesn't want us going backwards friends he wants us pressing forward in the things of God hey this is what Paul said examine yourselves examine your cells prove yourselves whether you be in the faith now listen to this and God me misunderstood brother BAM I'm saved and I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit well my Christian brother or sister I love how brother branham identifies them as a Christian it doesn't mean there's going to call him a devil or glory to God you you use center you don't you say you've been baptized and say you haven't even got started yet he said well my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn spirits it's usually a complex that causes this they inherited it from their mother father uncle aunt grandmother grandfather someone like that and if you'll chase it back down through your life if you'll chase it down through your life I've taken my experience of discernment thousands of those that have that spirit cases on the platform first thing you know I'd chase that spirit by discernment fine there was a granddaddy or grandmother somebody else back there and you inherit that by Nature then brother ben says how do you overcome it he said you just overcome it the same way you do anything else my face he said like a snake you don't aggravate a snake you just walk away and leave it alone it said just overcome the thing by faith but here's the way that most of it goes in Christianity I've got a stubborn spirit Oh God I'm stubborn that must mean I'm not saved that must mean I'm not born again now wait a minute count your pebbles if you're praying if you're fighting if you're working if you're laboring if you're trying to keep the Spirit of God in your life if you're taking every step forward that you can stubborn spirit or not you're where you need to be in the in the presence of Dolphin it does not matter god don't look at that thing and so they've got this and they've got that I can't use them at that's the very people God looks for is the people that have got all the problems Amen God likes taking broken people and making beautiful things out of them amen his reputation was made with sinners come on somebody he doesn't look for the best and the ones that got it all together they're the ones that don't need help but the ones that need help there's the one Jesus wants somebody that can cry out to him lord I need your help I need your strength I need your wisdom that's the one God can use however God's looking for somebody he can put his hands on and use them for the glory of God but they can't be somebody's got it all figured out you take a man a woman they got certain things that's been passed down to him to nature just like we taught last night just like this court here this morning you take all the little things that have come down to you and here you stand as a Christian as a child of God and you got little things in your life that you are battling on a daily basis and if you ain't careful the dark cloud will come by you and start talking well you see something's wrong with you something's wrong with your experience something's wrong no ain't nothing wrong with my experience if I'm counting the cost and I'm counting all them pebbles in my urn I am doing everything I can to serve God I am praying I am fasting I'm doing whatever I need to do to keep myself surrendered to the Lord I'm standing as the Bible said when you do nothing else to stand I'm standing I've got my feet flat I'm not moving backwards I'm right where I'm at it doesn't matter what I'm battling I'm waiting on God to give me the increase a man our friends I hope you understand what I'm preaching you this morning this will help us if we can apply it to our lives because Satan knows Satan knows better than all of us he knows that you cannot move beyond what God has made you to be I don't care how much the man wants to be a preacher if you don't have a gift in his life he'll never preach right I don't care how much a person wants to do gifted things any kind of gift at work if there's no gift there they'll just be beating it there or they might make a few little compliments here there but you can take a gifted person amen and set them on a music instrument or whatever it may be and they can do 50 times more than somebody that that is just learning by the music and by note or something like that why because that gift gives them the ability to break into supernatural channels and you cannot help it if you're not made that way you're not made that way and I believe that's one reason the Bible said make a joyful noise unto the Lord because not everybody is built in a certain way amen they all have different gifts they all have different abilities and the things I may be gifted in you may have 50 gifts that's different than mine but we put us together we become a powerhouse team all of us put together we become an invincible army that's what were the venom said and Satan don't know what to do with this when we surrender our lives to God in such a way that all them gifts are moving and milling through the body working in the kingdom of God Satan does not know how to attack such a force like that but one of the greatest weapons he's got is the weapon of discouragement if he can discourage you while you're working he thinks he can get you down and get you depressed oh I'm not there yet yes but I'm building I want you to listen devil I'm walking sure I may be halfway through sure I may have to crawl out of a mud hole and get the rent jumping a shout and get cleaned off and run to church sure I may be aggravated that the two-by-fours and the the sheetrock and all that ain't in the right place yet but I'm working I'm working how many here like cook let me likes cook you might your sisters I know especially brothers you like it too you just know admit it because you think it's a girl thing but any good chef will tell you whenever you put something into the pan you started out scalding hot and you step it back worse steak you'll ever eat in your life is one it tastes like the bottom of your shoe you just remember I said that but you put it in there you turn the hot the pan up real nice and hot it's scalding hot you take that steak and you set it in there like that and leave it on that heat you'll kill the steak it'll taste like leather it won't be good at all but you crank that heat way on down there after you get the pan nice and hot put some butter in there put some thyme put some garlic put some rosemary and you take that pan you tilt it back you base that steak like that with that butter you just take it at low easy gradual heat you pull that babydoll off there and I mean that's a steak fit for a king come on somebody hey man hey man that's for how you want to say man you just afraid to hey man it's good but you don't throw it in the pan and cook it to death you ease it up you ease the temperature up to a place to where it will come to it what they call perfection in the way they cook it anything you ever make you can't just listen my mama I love my mama my mama greatest woman my face his plan but my mama could not cook water if her and my daddy used to getting fusses all the time because my dad was a cook my dad loved to cook and he was oh he's a great cook and my mom my poor mother she can cook corn bread and I think that's about the only thing that she's ever really all that good and I'd tell her dad would tell her all the time dad would say Wilma you're cooking the thing to death she throw a pot of beans in there but imagine I mean she crank it all the way up there and you could see the smoke billowing all over the house we'd have a cloud and how she just cook in the devil and I mean it's just on fire almost the think you know he said turn it down why are you cooking it so big he's turn it down a little bit he walked over and crank it down mama he'd walk away my mother to her that's the way it was wonder how many Christians are that way they think all to be a Christian I've got to be right out you know sometimes friends being red-hot is good but don't forget if you always go wide open 100 miles an hour in spiritual things wonder how much times it turns into you doing it and not God doing it I'm not talking about a red-hot Christian experience I know the quotes you probably think of those type things but what I'm talking about is I wonder how much is human motivation how much is spiritual motivation I I believe in prayer I know you do too but do you realize that God can hear a five-minute prayer as much as you near a three-hour one but we get into our minds to be a Christian we got to pray three hours a day what about a man working 90 hours a week what about some of these brothers that literally go into the ground and like my mom my mamma's my grandfather was a coal miner they'd start at 4:00 in the morning there was under the ground by five o'clock and they stayed there to nearly midnight and it was back for 3-4 hours sleep it was right back into the coal mines again they've done that seven days a week nearly yeah my grandfather got killed in a coal mine and he had worked a hundred hours that week the day got killed and you understand a person like that so they're supposed to have a four-hour prayer meeting every day they ain't got time for it they ain't got the ability to do it they're raised in a family hey that's just Scripture the Bible said when a man is married he cares for the his wife and how he may please his wife in other words he's got people to take care of he don't have the time for God that it used to have you take a man that has a lot of obligations or a woman that has a lot of obligations I've said sometimes a woman I know Susanna Wesley I know I know I know but Susanna Wesley didn't live in our day the pressures in this day are a lot different than the day she lived in and sometimes sisters in this age they got a kid on one hip a vacuum cleaner in the other a tape going in the background the phone ringing over there and emails turpan over there on their phone over there forgive me huh they gotta pray oh god oh god you see such and such you see so and so you see this and that God hears those prayers but if we ain't careful a cloud will come by you know you don't ever go to all-night prayer meetings you don't do this you don't do that but listen I would rather have five minutes in a genuine connection with God than five hours with nothing let me tell you brother Branham said about Moses he said Moses in 40 years didn't learn nothing he said fifteen minutes in the presence of a burning bush he knew enough to deliver an entire army you see a lot of times that cloud will tell us ah you ain't where you need to be that's true maybe I'm not but I sure ain't where I used to be a man I'm not gaining weight [Laughter] listen to that Benny I'm not backsliding I'm movin powered by God's grace well I wish things would be better you know he said if you're laying in bed paralyzed he said if you can wiggle a finger we're gettin the name of Jesus Christ well I wish you'd be better but wiggle the finger in the meantime now here's the key of it if you can wiggle a finger and you don't wiggle it then you're backsliding if you got the ability wiggle the finger wiggle because that's moving forward cuz brother Graham said tomorrow you'll be able to wiggle to amen and listen I know we got people that have the ability to pray we got prayer warriors in the church I'm convinced that's one reason God ordained some people with the ability to pray because that the rest of the body will be occupied with matters of the church let me tell you something as a minister friends I literally wake up a morning to about 40 emails and things all over the place and let me tell you if I don't shut the computer off I never find time to pray people ringing and calling and this and that all the time and you when you travel around like I do everybody in there brother wants to ask you advice and ask you this and ask you that because they got pastors that won't talk to them and if they do they'll repeat over the pulpit what they say to them so they'll pick up a telephone brother band what you think about this what do you think about that how do you feel about that I've got a man right now in Arizona that talked to me three weeks ago and I'm still praying and I'm waiting on what to say to him about how to call I know people think well my god well he is a ministry you had a land of presence of God for hours I would love to I would love to there are times I was in North Carolina a few weeks ago and I had a chance to pray a prayed to and a half hours in a room I went through every little issue that had been lagging and been waning and waiting and I had two and a half hours where I could pray after two and a half hours the phone started ringing and this started happened that started having that started happening I said thank you Lord for the two-and-a-half hours I needed it but sometimes you get up in the morning and it's as much as you can do read your Bible talk to the Lord about 10 minutes or so and you got to be off to the next thing I'm not advocating that we don't try to pray but I'm trying to put a little encouragement and a little bit of a bright shining lining around that dark cloud to let you know that just because you're busy in this life you're busy for the work of the Lord you're busy for the things of God hey sister you think raising them kids ain't to work of the Lord you're the fifth gospel that's what the Prophet said amen isn't today Father's Day today's Father's Day and then happy Father's Day I just happen to think of that happy Father's Day to your fathers next Sunday okay all right well I'm a week ahead hallelujah happy Father's Day it's a job it's a responsibility brother BAM talked about a man said all you'd see him at lunch with a sandwich in his hand reading his Bible he said he raised his kids to the glory of God done what God's purpose was in his life sometimes that's all a man can do and he may have just so much time to do this yeah but it doesn't mean because we're not having all-night prayer meetings and the Tri hear people say things like that all the time they say glory to God I remember the days when we had hot prayer meetings I just like to get people smiling in church well we'll start there let's start with getting them smiling in church and then we'll work on all-night prayer meetings later somebody's people to mess is most unhappy people that ever seen in my life or the other you can even get him to smile sometimes much less shout amen but that's what I'm trying to say to you sometimes it's baby steps financial people will tell you that when you're trying to get out of a mess of a debt it's what they call baby steps you have to take little steps to try to get yourself out of the mess it's the same thing serving the Lord now there may be people in here you may have the opportunity every morning you may have an hour with the Lord god bless you I pray the Lord gives you five by the time the thing is over with I pray God gives you all kinds of time to stay in the presence of God but brother sister what I'm trying to say to you is that you cannot allow yourself to be discouraged because you've got so many irons in the fire God understands every bit of that it's like I said about the church and central down there Oh who's gonna want to come pastor the church out there I said God knows where Grand Falls Central is he knows where that is just like he knew where Saul was hiding in the stuff Amen people I've been in so many churches vacated pastors and things over the year and I'd hear them say the same thing well who's gonna want to come here let me tell you something God knows exactly what needs to happen in these churches he knows exactly what needs to take place he has everything just said I'm just the way it needs to be settled and that's the thing we got to understand is that when circumstances come up in our life and we feel like Oh surely this this is the end oh it's over no this this is I'm never gonna get out of this God knew he was going into that thing before you went into it and if he put you in it he already had the answer out of it we just have to trust him we have to trust his wisdom in the situation's were in that's right that's right exactly oh my this is this and the key to the door but the Branham says he said somebody said to me the day I would become a Christian when I get good enough hey I'll tell you what you do Papa look around you find that place where you can get good enough and tell me where that place is because I want to go there too he says Christ never came to save the good man he came to save the bad one when you think you're good he didn't come to save you he come to say them that knows they are bad oh praise the Lord he said that's right he said it's like we're in one big building over here we're in jail he said I can't stand over in the corner of that jail cell and say hey help me get out of this jail he said we're both in the same fix every man born in the world he said born in sin shapen iniquity came to the world speaking lies he's a renegade to begin with he's a renegade to begin with but when God takes us out of the jail cell and places us on our way then we have to know that the God that took us out of prison is able to put us in the rapture and resurrection we got to know that we got to have confidence in the thing that he started what did the Bible say he will complete this good work that he began in you I've said it a thousand times let me say it again to you this morning anytime I've ever felt to myself I think I'll quit it's like something says to me how can you quit something you never started I never began this Christ is the one that began this he got me out of a jail cell and now it's up to him to take me all the way up I have to trust him I have to have confidence in what he's gonna do in my life and if I'm not backsliding I got to keep moving forward but if I can't take another step forward I can say okay God there's a reason why you're doing the things that you're doing hey man I'm getting long winded on my approach hey man watch this oh thank you Jesus don't you love the Lord oh he's wonderful litany watches the first Corinthians chapter 1 verse 26 he said see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called that ought to encourage you because everything I just said we ain't I ain't Marty I ain't noble ah oh wise neither you come on say man sure people walk by you on the street right not all that great of a thing in the eyes of the world but God have chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise God chose weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things and things which are despised hath God chosen yea he said in the things which are not to be brought the things that are and then first Corinthians 2 1 through 3 he says brethren I came you not with excellency of speech of wisdom declaring only the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything save Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness in fear and in much trembling but abandoned Auctus learning all of his human weaknesses and learning all of the things that go with his his stuttering ways and high stuttered along he said God he said how am I gonna deliver people when I can't even talk he said who made your tongue he said I'll give you a voice he said you'll be God and I'll make Aaron your prophet he said go down and tell him I said let my children go let my people go tell them to come out of that mess I want my children back I'm gonna bring them to this mountain and they're gonna worship me and I want you to go tell them you tell them through Aaron Moses oh I can't do the job God's that's what I'm counting on you see when we're applying for a job we put the best things we can find on the resume but whenever your resume looks like I can't I failed I lied I murdered I did this I did that God said you got the job he's not looking for the one who's got the best qualifications friends hey man he's looking for the ones that ain't got no qualifications now watch this in the message does God call a man to judge him that first morning but the man who says when you plead anything to God you've got to have a reason for it he said like you say to this mountain be removed don't doubt he said but believe what you said he'll come to pass now that's altogether controlled on motive and objective and there's were many of us make mistakes we go out there and say now I'm gonna show you I've got faith to do this thing he says you're wrong to begin with God don't give you gifts just to play with it hallelujah I believe the message I'm gonna speak to squirrels when I was a young Christian I mean first stages of my Christian I'm still a young man I guess a lot of people say anyhow I said we got spoken-word power I cannot tell you how many times I spoke to wind to lightning to red lights to flies you name them I tried to use creative power to make my life a flowery bed of ease best I could you know what you find out you find out that those are things that God alone gives to you when that happened with brother Branham you remember what he said he fell into that super anointing came on him well the RAM couldn't stood out there himself and said okay I think today's a good day to speak a mess of squirrels okay you go over there and you do this he said the Holy Spirit had to move on him first before he could do it even Jesus himself said the son can do nothing of himself except what he first sees the father doing there's no way in the world we can do it of ourself I cannot make things happen neither can you so what good does it do me to stand there and say oh I'm gonna get rapturing faith I'm gonna listen to every message I can I'm gonna look up every quote on rap stream faith I'm gonna get rap stream faith you know when you'll get rap string faith when God brings the increase out of you to come to rap string faith until then just keep working keep pressing and if you come this way and you can't go nowhere brother BAM said if I come up to a wall I can't get above it and I can't get under it can't get around it you know what he said he said I just stand still and wait let God make the way through it sometimes we don't have any other choice because in the great scope of eternity zuv you you don't understand that may be the thing you're battling and facing in your life that thing may be connected to 30 other things in the spear of influence and if you move this way it may throw a whole bunch of cogs out of there right place so God's holding gyro steady so there's no way that can be really thanking what he said in an adoption he said the unconfessed sins of you believers could knock somebody from getting healed up here at the platform you said and greatest battle ever fought he talked about if one star would move out of their position it would throw the whole host of God out of order so the thing that you're doing in your life and you come to that spot and so I wish I had more God may burden you for more there will be more for you to have if it's God burden you but you can't move beyond where he's got you because if you step this way there may be something back here connected to you that could be thrown completely out of order so God may be waiting he may be waiting on this one and that one and this thing and that circumstances this this and this it'll all line up in time you just have to stand still and wait on it they that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength right they'll mount up with wings like eagles right all these things have to come you said they're sacred he said then when God says so he said you can come with thus sayeth the Lord when God says so he said if you want to study anything at all he said you look at the spirit of the thing he said look at the spirit and Families look at the spirits and cities look at the spirits and churches and what more he said all of these type of atmospheres and all these type of things that people have got there's something that controls and motivates them all right if you're a Christian look and see what's motivating you if the reason you want to be a better Christian is because you just feel like you're not where you need to be and it's just you feeling that way well that's not going to mount to a hill of beans look at it the way God sees it don't look at the way you look at it it's easy for us to take the Bible and start writing down we could do pro and con : okay I obey this I obey that I'm doing this I keep the law I do this you know there's another fellow in the Bible had that idea his name was the rich young ruler Jesus said you know the commandments he said every one of them he said here's my list Jesus I've kept every one of them since I've been a kid and Jesus looked and said one thing you still lack do you understand that many times no matter how spiritual we may be no matter how spiritual we may come up into the things of God there's always gonna be something lacking somewhere so what we do about it well we're gonna have prayer meetings you could have every prayer meeting in the world and gonna make the flower grow any faster you could read the Bible every single day of your life until God gives the increase you're just waiting on him to make the moves only thing you can do is be patient so God you see in me what needs to be developed and I'm waiting on you until you develop out of my life what you want to develop out of my life what I'm doing good here doing good here doing good here doing good here doing good here I don't know that one it's a little little a little song I'm not a good Christian because these things aren't an order God ain't a bit more nervous about them things in that column than nothing in the world you're the one nervous not him it's you worrying about it because Jesus looks at your life and remember the Prophet said he sees you in a perfect condition already the blood of Christ puts us in a condition where he sees us perfected and the thing that God done in our heart he'll bring it to its completion one day he will but we've got to be patient gotta wait on him we got to count the cost okay god this is where I'm at today am I where I want to be no but if you brought me here then you can bring me here and then here and then here oh thank you lord thank you Jesus amen let me hurry watch this I just love how the how the Bible says like this right here in verse 12 of Saint John 14 there he said verily I say he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also greater works than these shouting the Prophet said there's nothing greater could have been done he said the correct translation is more God will do more through the people of God because there's more people to work through he said he said and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son then the word he uses here if he shall ask a Itoh which means to egg to call to crave the desire to require anything in my name that's the thing I will do well if that's got to be something God puts in your heart you can't just want it for once sake you have to test your motive and objective if I want to be a better Christian if I want to move beyond where I'm at today is it just me wanting to be better is it just me wanting to be higher me wanting to do this or is it because God's telling me I've got more out there for you you need to start stepping forward I know that sounds strange to some people you think well how could how could it be that way if you think of it in this way when a person desires to do something they genuinely desire to do something there's nothing wrong with the desire to want to do it but you can desire things that's not the will of God I'm gonna give you a case when we gonna go home David wanted to see the Ark of God restored by the brem said he had an honest desire he didn't desire for the wrong things he wanted the thing to be right he wanted God's ark restored back to the people but David took his own route there was a prophet in the land he should have consulted Nathan and Nathan would have told him bring the Ark over on the shoulders of the Levites but they put it on a new cart they put it on a set of wheels and the wheels rolled him all the way in there and those wheels rolled him out of the will of God and in trying to do God to serve that means remember the brem said they trumpeted they had Pentecostal meetings had great singers they had the people shouting and David even danced and his clothes fell off completely out of the will of God because the Ark was supposed to come on the shoulders of the Levites you see what I'm saying to you sometimes we can want something that's a righteous thing but make sure we're doing it in God's timing in God's ceasing in the way that God wants it to be done many things I'd like to see manifest in my life but I realize already I'm never going to come to that spot unless I'm patient I wait on him to bring those things out of my life and I may not understand it all but one trial after another after 9:00 you realize brother mem said it was trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test and that's the day in the life of a child are gone we wake up in the morning his mercies are new then it's trial trial trial test test test trial trial trial test test test time to go to sleep that's a normal day and you think why am I going through all of this when I should be a that's what you're really thinking when I should be up here why is all this happening when I I should be you know it's easy for us to get offended whenever we go through things because in our mind we think that I'm bribed I'm the elect of God yeah you are that's why you're going through that thing and the Lord Jesus is determined to make sure that the things that we are going through will bring him glory and not us because when we stand there on that day they're not a one of us gonna be able to say I brought myself here I lived right I prayed I attended all-night prayer meetings I listened to every tape and the message I listened to every book and a message you realize there's gonna be people in the rapture that's never gonna get to hear every tape they're gonna be people in the jungles out there in the foreign fields that ain't never gonna be able to read every book they may only get a hold of 200 books in their lifetime but they're gonna have somebody preached to them they're gonna have the Holy Ghost and God's gonna work with them and perfect their character and they're gonna be a part of the rapture just like you and I are because God knows what we need and how we need it amen we have to trust him ah tell you we say these remarks and I know I know what we're meaning when we say them but well all that church should be higher up the road that's true but the church st. going no higher till God brings her higher I mean I look around the situation's around Jude I get just a discouraged and fed up but just like you all do I mean why in the world can't people be different I mean human beings sometimes are the most curious things I can figure an animal out an animal makes sense it eats and sleeps and but humans they're an enigma nothing seems to satisfy me there's all the dynamic of the human mind is something that people are still studying six thousand years later they're still ain't figured it out and the best guess they got as we come from monkeys and that's probably why we're all the way we are a man that's probably about the truth of it a man what I'm trying to say to you is that we see all the different you know the the the the nuances and the and the different parts of the human mind and the aspects that you see all the funniness and the strangeness that have that exist in people yes people are so strange and so funny but we serve a God that is mindful of every single nuance every single oddity every funny thing how it all works together he just looks at it like one great picture that he understands and in all of that confusion all of those people here's the bride of Jesus Christ scattered throughout the midst of all of this humanity and he knows how on my part and your part how it all works together in the great economy of God I'm not saying we don't know hunger blessed are they the hunger and thirst I'm not saying we don't try but I'm saying we need to count the cost sometimes we need to look into our earn and say okay I may not be where I need to be but I've done everything I know how to do to be the right kind of Christian I'm living the best that I possibly know how give yourself some credit give yourself some grace friends sometimes we are our own worst enemies we're judge and jury of everything we do we don't need the devil to condemn us we do a better job of it ourselves because we look at things in our life and we say all right and we hear a preacher preach and he'll say something cut us to the quick you'd be talking to yourself say I know I was a rotten thing give yourself some grace count the cost are you praying are you studying or you reading your Bible are you doing like you should are you moving forward long as you ain't moving backward stand there flat-footed and say okay God I'm doing the best I know how and I'm asking you to help me that when the next step comes if you burden me for something greater just help me be able to step right into a flow oven and step on up amen because otherwise you can't do it of yourself there's just no way you can do it of yourself I know it's been strange to preach this way after the last couple nights but this really is what they say the icing on the cake because if you think of what I preached to you last night you think how we open this up about God wanting us to have hope you understand the theme of what I'm trying to preach to you God wants us to have a confidence in ourselves and that means if I'm not here and I feel like I should be here I just relax okay God I'm here praise the Lord I'm here I'm what I am I can't be anything different I'm just I am what I am by the grace of God it gives you a hope is this what the prophets said about that woman that dark cloud falling around I'm wondering how many sleepless nights she had oh I just wish I was you remember you remember the woman had the dream I was reading it this morning Brad was talking about how she saw herself on white sands you know the eagle come down all that she was so worried about that dream the prophet of God said she made her whole family nervous worrying about the dream brother Bream said sister you was on white sands he said that represents purity said stop worrying you're making your whole family nervous what good does it do to worry about where yet mm-hmm hey listen we see things sometimes when we think how are people gonna survive you know I go to these these countries and I see people sitting there that they don't have one good meal a week sometimes they have to beg everything they get and their Christians their Holy Ghost field people and I think how they're gonna survive but then I remember the Bible said if I can feed sparrows I can feed you never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen the seat of God beggin bread you know and I say beg but you understand what I mean they have to work and struggle and fight to get everything that gets what I mean God knows how to take care of them and you look at that and you think God why don't you do it this way how do you know if he did it that way if it wouldn't disrupt a whole lot of other things in their life sometimes God puts them in situations we're blessed aren't we three square meals a day cars heat cool when we need it we're blessed or are we or are we a lot of the things that we call blessings are actually some of our greatest hindrances that's what I'm trying to say to you God sees the whole picture through eternity scope through eternities view and I am closed and I'm not gonna say it not do it I'm closin the Eternity scope eternity is view God sees the whole picture of it so we have to learn to be contented okay God here's where I am today now I don't want to be here tomorrow but if you choose for me to be here tomorrow I'll stay put until the next step comes because that's what maturity really is you know as a minister sometimes either situations come up and I see it I could attack it right away but I've learned take a step back for a moment and pray over that thing watching watching to see how it develops watch and see what comes out of it because a lot of times if you rush in and make a quick decision you can make a wrong one and the thing you think was right is actually the wrong the think you think was wrong there's the things gonna be right it's always the opposite sometimes so you just said still okay god I want more I do with all my heart I want more but til more comes I'll stay here I won't let the devil pull me back I'll just stay put right where you put me I want this to encourage your friends I wanted to encourage you and I want you to be able to look at your life as a child of God and realize that Satan uses these very things to discourage us so many times you look at your families you look at situations at work and Satan can take all of that and make that almost like it's your own personal fault that's why I was preaching to you last night a lot of these things you struggle with you never asked for it it was given to you it was a head of hair down to you through through the natural way of natural birth and James 1 verse 5 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God he said they give it to all men liberally upbraideth not shall be given to him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waiver is like the wave of a sea driven with the wind and tossed let not a man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord but a double minded man is unstable in all of his ways then the Prophet says this one my motive is right when my objective is right and God and my heart is leading me if I can't get over the mountain if I can't get around the mountain then I might say mountain move lorry he said in that one little spoonful of mountain may drop down but it'll have to obey me eventually but you know I said I was quitting didn't I I am we can be the most impatient people in the world though we ask God to do something and we want it now that society's trained us to be that way humans are so impatient you know you go to McDonald's they got a 30-second window from the time you order the time you get your bag and run out there or Wendy's whichever place you might go to just saying amen the world is push-button put your dishes in push a button want popcorn push the button want TV dinner pop it in push a button but when it comes to the things of God it's not a push-button religion you don't get it instantly it doesn't come quickly it's just something that takes time I don't like it either I wish we could get it all right now but we have to be patient they that wait on the Lord they shall renew their strength and mount up with the wings of eagles Oh God help me be patient help me now get frustrated with myself help me not get discouraged with me help me trust that I'm where I need to be in his side let's pray together Lord Jesus father I know in my heart that the very thing that you've let me preach this morning is it really hits home with me lord I know it hits home with these others here but lord I I know as far as I'm concerned that's always been my battle always wanting to do more and go greater and be bigger as Lord I read this message I study this Bible and I see what's laying before us is the People of God and Lord I've always had such a burden and a fervent desire to get us there even in my preaching sometimes Lord I get so strong with it there's almost try to push people into it and that's part of what we got to do as preachers we've got to drive at home sometimes but Lord at the same time I realize God we have to have patience these things don't develop overnight help us Lord father help us this morning as your children they're just kind of settle into this revelation that you've give us today help us to understand what it is we need to change in our way of thinking or in our mind our mindset and help us Lord to be patient with ourselves help us to give ourselves grace and transition as we move from one thing to another lord help us to slow down a little bit and just look at ourselves and count the cost and say okay Lord where I am is where you want me and I'm gonna stay firm I'm gonna be faithful I'm gonna be loyal to the place that you've placed me god help me not be impatient it helped me to settle down and wait on you to lead me and when you place a burden in my heart for more or for greater or for bigger or for whatever it may be Lord then help me to move right into that revelation help me to step right into that imagery of what you want me to be which is more but God until then lord help me to work within the vocation help me to work in the capacity of God that you want me to work in Lord and let it be for these people this morning Lord then as they examine themselves Lord it's easy for us to push my lord we want hunger we want desire we don't want to be lazy but God help us all sort of recognize that we need to be satisfied yes we want a deeper walk with you yes we want to know you in a greater way but lord help me be satisfied with what you've chosen to show me help me be satisfied with what you've chosen to do for me and Goblin you want to do more I'm ready for it lord help us this morning I pray in Jesus name oh thank you Lord Jesus I may just believe you spoke to you this morning so please oh thank you lord thank you mighty God thank you mighty God we bless your name this morning Lord Jesus we bless your name we bless your name Lord allelujah Oh bless your name Lord Jesus bless your name my lord Oh God I believe you spoken to our hearts today lord I believe you talked to us today lord help us receive O God that which you spoke to us lord help us apply it to our lives Lord Jesus help us I pray Lord God please please help us lord help us in Jesus name sing a little song David wait upon the Lord let's sing that let me give you a tiny example of the principle I'm preaching to you brother band was said when they would seek for the Holy Ghost he said they bring him up to an altar and grab their chin try to make him say Jesus Jesus Jesus real fast he said they were trying to push himself into something rather than just yield themselves and let the Lord do the work that that's what I'm trying to tell you we don't want to force our self into something you can't force God to do anything because the whole secret of Christianity ways is just yielding just yielding just surrendering it's okay Lord Here I am I don't want to be guilty of having the same type of Spirit on me as what many of them did when they dragged people up to the altar to get saved you could drag all you want to but jesus said no man comes to me except my father draws him first it is going to take him to make the next moves Oh God this morning help me be in that kind of mindset amen let's sing it together they [Music] Sharon they shine with [Music] [Applause] Hey this hour faith teach me teach me [Music] that way upon sorry [Music] [Applause] they shall ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] when Nehemiah was building the wall Tobiah and samba lat came and tried to discourage him from doing his work they even got him a priest to tell him come into the house of the Lord come into the house of the Lord and rest yourself a little while and he says this in verse 12 chapter 6 chapter lo I perceived that God had not sent him he pronounced this prophesy against me total by and sanballat had hired him therefore was he hired I should be afraid and do so and sin that they might have matter for an evil report he knew he had no business in the temple they tried to bring him in the temple when he wasn't had no business there but he said these words my god think that upon until bye and Sam black according to their works on the prophetess note no daya and the rest of the prophets that they would have put me in fear the wall was finished 12 fifth day of the month of a loo in the fiftieth and the two days and it came to pass when all our enemies heard thereof and all the heathens round about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes and they perceive that this work was wrought of God the devil will always send a tow bionis ambolyn and even if he has to come through a religious perspective and even if he has to use a religious mindset to try to discourage you from doing the work of God Satan will use any method he can to try to discourage you from continuing your work but that's why we have to be faithful to wherever we are to be faithful at that moment in time of what God has called us to be we've got all kinds of Samba laps until buyers in our life but keep working hammer in one hand sword in the other and the will of God in your heart just keep working keep fighting keep pressing you even tried to use a prophetess to bring this man of God off that wall all by Satan has all kinds of tricks he has all kinds of little things but we have to have enough discernment about ourselves that's why Paul said examine yourself in other words discern yourself count the cost is this me is this what I'm trying why am i trying to be more what what what's the point of it to get my self glory so that I can sit back and my lazy boy and say boy I've really turned out to be a Christian if that's all it is friends it'll never come to the place it needs to come to because everything God does in us we ought to be able to sit back on a lazy boy and say Lord I'm so thankful for what you've done in me it's not of me of any works the man could boast but God that showed mercy on me amen I could go on all day but you get to point Amen I love it I love it teach me law teach me [Music] now let's pray one for another for we go Lord Jesus as we've come to the close of a third wonderful final service Lord we want to thank you
