[20:42] getting darker.
[20:45] The enemy roars, Lord, like a cunning
[20:47] lion, Father God, and sometimes he
[20:49] creeps up unaware, Lord. I just pray,
[20:51] Father, that anybody's going through any

[36:32] Hallelujah.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Each step I take

[37:06] his hand.
[37:10] [music]
[37:11] He holds the [singing] key
[37:16] that opens up the way. [singing]
[37:21] [music]
[37:22] Yes.
[37:24] that will lead
[37:27] [music]
[37:28] me to the promised land. [music]
[37:34] Yes. Amen.
[37:36] Each step I take. [music]
[37:41] I know that he will guide [music]
[37:47] me
[37:49] to higher
[37:51] ground. [music]
[37:52] Amen.
[37:54] He ever leads me [singing] on. [music]
[38:00] Praise the Lord.
[38:02] Until [singing]
[38:03] someday
[38:06] the last step will be taken. [music]
[38:14] Each step by day
[38:19] [music]
[38:19] just leads me closer.
[38:27] I trust [music and singing] in God
[38:32] no matter
[38:34] come what [music] may.
[38:39] Hallelujah. All life [music] eternal
[38:46] is in his hand.
[38:52] He [music] holds the [singing]
[38:55] key
[38:57] that opens [music]
[38:59] up the way
[39:05] [music] that will lead
[39:10] me to the prois [music]
[39:13] land.
[39:15] Amen.
[39:18] each
[39:19] by day.
[39:22] I [music and singing] know that he will
[39:26] guide me [music]
[39:30] to higher ground. Hallelujah.
[39:35] He ever leads me on.
[39:41] Amen.
[39:43] Until
[39:45] Amen.
[39:47] The last step will [singing] be taken.
[39:53] [music]
[39:55] Each step [singing]
[39:57] I take [music]
[40:00] just leads [singing] me closer [music]
[40:04] home.
[40:08] Amen.
[40:10] Amen. is the truth that each each step
[40:12] we take in the Lord in the word just
[40:15] brings us closer to that resurrection
[40:17] and rapture.
[40:20] Praise the Lord. Let's sing 1168 for
[40:22] every answered prayer.
[40:32] For every answered prayer.
[40:39] For always being there.
[40:46] For love that hears us when [music]
[40:49] we call.
[40:53] Or arms that lift [music] us when we
[40:56] fall.
[40:58] Let's stand.
[41:00] You have always been [music]
[41:04] right [singing] beside us, leading us
[41:08] all [music] along the way.
[41:12] Amen.
[41:14] And we made it through.
[41:17] Hallelujah.
[41:21] Because of you.
[41:25] And here [music]
[41:26] we [singing] are
[41:30] lifting our hands to you.
[41:35] Yes. Amen. Praise the Lord. [music]
[41:38] Here we are.
[41:43] Giving you thanks [music]
[41:46] for all [singing]
[41:47] you do.
[41:51] as we praise [music]
[41:55] and [singing] worship your holy name.
[42:03] You are here
[42:08] dwelling within
[42:10] our praise [music and singing]
[42:15] for days we cannot see.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:22] For all that's yet to [singing] be.
[42:26] [music]
[42:28] The trials we may have [music] to face
[42:33] [singing]
[42:34] when we leaning on your grace.
[42:40] [music]
[42:41] It will be your strength
[42:45] [music] that guides [singing]
[42:46] us. Your love that makes us strong.
[42:51] Hallelujah.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; And through [singing] it all [music]
[43:01] we'll sing [singing] this song. [music]
[43:03] Amen. And praise the Lord. Here
[43:06] [singing] we are [music]
[43:10] lifting our hands.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, here [singing] we are
[43:22] [music]
[43:23] giving you thanks for all you do.
[43:27] [music]
[43:30] And as we praise
[43:34] [music] and worship [singing] your holy
[43:38] name.
[43:40] [music]
[43:42] For you are here
[43:48] dwelling within
[43:50] our praise.
[43:55] [music] And here we are.
[44:00] We're lifting our [music and singing]
[44:01] hands to you.
[44:08] Oh, here [singing] we [music] are.
[44:12] We're giving you thanks [music] for all
[44:16] you do.
[44:20] And as we praise
[44:24] [music] and worship your [singing] holy
[44:28] name
[44:29] [music]
[44:32] for you are here,
[44:37] dwelling within
[44:40] our praise.
[44:45] Amen. Lord, we've got something to
[44:47] praise and worship you about this
[44:48] morning.
[44:50] Lord, that we can stand in your
[44:52] presence, Lord, under the hearing of
[44:54] your word, Lord, and that we can be
[44:57] changed, Lord. That we have been changed
[45:00] and we're being changed even in these
[45:01] moments, Lord, as we can take in this
[45:04] word and let it do a work in our life,
[45:06] heavenly father.
[45:09] Lord, the soul is [music] sealed by the
[45:11] spirit, Lord. But the spirit and the
[45:13] flesh are coming into subjection day by
[45:15] day, Lord. You're giving us the victory,
[45:18] Lord, as we yield ourselves to you,
[45:20] Lord. So, we want to thank you this
[45:22] morning, Lord, for another year you
[45:23] brought us through, Lord. We want to
[45:25] thank you for a gift that you've given
[45:26] us, Lord, not just that you came and
[45:29] died, Lord, but that you came back,
[45:31] Lord, in the form of the Holy Spirit so
[45:33] that we could live a life that we could
[45:35] never live in our own. Heavenly Father,
[45:37] Lord, we're thankful this morning for
[45:38] the work that you've done. Lord, we're
[45:40] thankful for the work you're doing,
[45:42] Lord. And we're thankful, Lord, that
[45:44] it's a completed work in eternity, Lord,
[45:46] that we're walking into something that
[45:48] you've already written. It's something
[45:50] you've already spoken, Lord. It's
[45:52] already done, and we've just got to make
[45:54] it to the finish line. Lord, I pray you
[45:56] help us to keep our faith up, Lord. Get
[45:58] our eyes on you and keep them firmly
[46:00] there, Lord. As things in this world
[46:02] change, Lord, as they often do, Lord,
[46:05] may we just keep our eyes fixed on you,
[46:06] Lord. The author and the finisher of our
[46:08] faith, we pray. Lord, bless your people.
[46:10] Each one that's gathered here, Lord.
[46:12] remembering those that are sick, Lord.
[46:14] Remembering Jeremiah and Mary Beth,
[46:16] Lord, Sister Karen Wiffin, Lord, Sister
[46:18] Nadine, Lord, praying your grace to
[46:20] them, each one. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[46:22] your merciful touch we ask in Jesus
[46:25] Christ's name we're praying it. [music]
[46:26] Amen. And amen. God bless you. Turn if
[46:29] you would to Luke chapter 2. Luke
[46:32] chapter 2. I want to bring greetings
[46:33] this morning from Brother Ed
[46:34] Hammermeister. I talked to him for maybe
[46:36] 10 or 15 minutes yesterday. At the end,
[46:38] he said, "Please greet the church. Send
[46:39] them my love." So, I'm sending that over
[46:42] the pulpit to you this morning from him.
[46:44] Amen. I sure enjoyed Brother Garfield's
[46:46] service on Wednesday night. But I did
[46:47] want to apologize or clarify when I said
[46:50] I thought we might need to pull the
[46:52] plug. That was not in any way
[46:54] insinuating that I wanted him to stop or
[46:56] he was going too long or anything like
[46:58] that. It's because I know what it's
[46:59] like. You get going and then you get
[47:00] into the good things of God. Brother
[47:02] Brandon, remember what he was talking
[47:03] about when he said uh how long a service
[47:05] should go. He says if we've got
[47:06] unbelievers here, he says 30, 45
[47:08] minutes. He says, "But if we've just got
[47:10] believers here, we could go all night."
[47:12] Amen. And sometimes the preacher thinks
[47:13] we can go all night. And I know what
[47:15] that's like. So, Brother Grant, there
[47:16] was no disrespect meant whatsoever. I
[47:18] sure appreciated it. And I thought it
[47:20] was just a wonderful job just
[47:22] masterfully done. So, uh, we're thankful
[47:24] to the Lord for that. Amen. I wanted to
[47:26] clarify that we don't have service on
[47:28] Wednesday just to remind the folks and
[47:30] then we'll come back again on Sunday.
[47:31] Also, Brother Garfield's been sharing
[47:33] some videos from the churches in Jamaica
[47:35] that we helped and the roof is, I think,
[47:37] pretty much done at this point.
[47:38] Certainly the outside a bit of flashing
[47:40] maybe on the lower edges, but it looks
[47:42] like they've more or less completed
[47:43] that. So, wanted to thank the church for
[47:45] that. It's a wonderful thing that we can
[47:46] help them and just trust the Lord to
[47:48] help them as they try and get everything
[47:50] back to normal. Amen. I wanted to thank
[47:52] the church also for your very generous
[47:54] gift to me for Christmas. It certainly
[47:56] humbled me and I just wanted to thank
[47:58] you all for that. It certainly can go to
[48:00] good use with me needing a new car now.
[48:02] So, God bless you each one. Amen. Luke
[48:05] chapter 2. [snorts] Amen. It's a
[48:07] Christmas message this morning. Maybe
[48:08] not the one we're used to though, but we
[48:10] will still read this. And it says, "And
[48:12] it came to pass in those days that there
[48:14] went out a decree from Caesar Augustus
[48:16] that all the world should be taxed. And
[48:18] this taxing was first made when Sirenius
[48:20] was governor of Syria. And all went to
[48:22] be taxed everyone into his own city. And
[48:25] Joseph also went up from Galilee out of
[48:27] the city of Nazareth into Judea into the
[48:30] city of David which is called Bethlehem
[48:32] because he was of the house and lineage
[48:34] of David to be taxed with Mary his
[48:37] espoused wife being great with child.
[48:40] And so it was that while they were there
[48:42] the days were accomplished that she
[48:44] should be delivered. And she brought
[48:46] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[48:48] in swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[48:49] manger because there was no room for
[48:52] them in the inn. And they were in the
[48:54] same country, shepherds abiding in the
[48:56] field, keeping watch over their flock by
[48:58] night. And lo, the angel of the Lord
[49:00] came upon them, and the glory of the
[49:02] Lord shone round about them. And they
[49:04] were sore afraid. And the angel said
[49:07] unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I
[49:09] bring you good tidings of great joy,
[49:12] which shall be to all people. For unto
[49:14] you is born this day in the city of
[49:16] David, a Savior, which is Christ the
[49:19] Lord." Amen. God bless you. You can have
[49:21] your seats this morning. And I want to
[49:23] take a very simple topic and thought
[49:25] this morning and I want to preach on
[49:28] good news this morning. And we look at
[49:30] this birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem.
[49:33] And we spoke of it a bit in the the
[49:34] Christmas program. How we see that
[49:36] everything that happened in that birth
[49:38] was for a purpose. Amen. He was born in
[49:41] a stable. He wasn't born in a clean
[49:42] house. He wasn't born in a hospital or
[49:45] anything like that. And he didn't have a
[49:46] cradle to to rest in. He didn't have
[49:49] special clothes for him. and they
[49:51] wrapped him up like a a newborn lamb and
[49:53] they laid him in a manger and it was
[49:55] perfectly done because he was the lamb
[49:57] of God. And they used to take those
[49:58] newborn lambs that had no blemish and
[50:00] they'd wrap them up tightly so that they
[50:02] wouldn't hurt themselves. They wouldn't
[50:03] scrape themselves and then they'd lay
[50:05] them in that stone manger to protect
[50:06] them because they could be used for
[50:08] sacrifice later. And we talked on on
[50:11] that that Christmas program how that all
[50:12] the discomfort and all the frustration
[50:15] and all the hardship and all the pain
[50:17] and all the suffering that Mary and
[50:19] Joseph went through was for purpose.
[50:22] Amen. It was because he had to be born
[50:24] in a certain place at a certain time in
[50:28] a certain way and God had to get them
[50:30] into position
[50:32] &gt;&gt; so they could fulfill the word exactly.
[50:36] And you look at how God used pain and
[50:39] suffering and an oppressive government
[50:40] and taxation and long trips and these
[50:43] things to get them into position.
[50:45] Church, if you're a child of God, God
[50:48] uses situations to get you into
[50:52] position. Amen. Hallelujah. He wants to
[50:54] get you to a particular place. I loved
[50:57] how how brother Garfield brought this
[50:58] out on on Wednesday night, how he said,
[51:00] "We are not just living life. We are not
[51:03] just making decisions. We are not just
[51:05] having things happen to us. We do not
[51:08] just have conversations. We do not just
[51:10] run into people. Amen. Good things, bad
[51:14] things, that is not what it is. God has
[51:16] a purpose. God has a script that he is
[51:19] working from. Amen. And we may not
[51:21] realize it. We were talking about this
[51:22] with our daughter uh earlier this week.
[51:24] How do you know when you're in a trial
[51:27] for yourself or for somebody else? And
[51:29] and do we go through these things with
[51:31] the realization that there's purpose in
[51:33] it? or are we just trying to get through
[51:35] it? Because so often we want to avoid
[51:38] the pain. We want to get rid of the pain
[51:39] and we forget there's purpose inside of
[51:41] it. I remember a brother in Texas said,
[51:43] he said, "I've stopped asking God to
[51:45] take away the issue and help me to learn
[51:47] what he wants me to learn.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz when I learn what he wants me to
[51:51] learn, then I can get out of the issue."
[51:53] Amen. That's when he can move it on.
[51:54] Amen. But we may not realize it. We may
[51:56] not even like it at times. Come on. We
[51:59] may not even like what he's putting us
[52:00] through, but there is a purpose behind
[52:02] it. You know, I was playing hockey a
[52:04] couple of weeks ago and we were down 7
[52:05] to2 and the guy next to me said, "We've
[52:07] got them right where we want them. We're
[52:09] losing 7-2." I said, "That's not." I
[52:11] said, "I'd rather be up 7 to2." He says,
[52:13] "No, we got them right where we want
[52:14] them." And we went back and we won 10 to
[52:16] nine.
[52:18] Now, that man was foolish.
[52:21] We shouldn't have won,
[52:23] but we had a superhero on our team that
[52:25] carried the team. Amen. But he said,
[52:27] "We've got them right where we want
[52:28] them." You know what? God does that
[52:30] sometimes. We can look at the the
[52:32] situation. We can look at the
[52:34] circumstances and we can say, "This is
[52:36] ridiculous. It hurts too much. It's it's
[52:38] too much bother. It's too much burden."
[52:40] And God says, "I've got you right where
[52:41] I want you. I've got Satan right where I
[52:44] want him, too." And what is he doing?
[52:46] He's trying to show you that he is in
[52:47] it. And when all seems hopeless, when it
[52:49] all seems too much, when you can't bear
[52:51] it anymore, then he comes through. And
[52:52] all you can say is, "Praise the Lord."
[52:54] Because it wasn't me. It wasn't me. I
[52:57] would have broke and I would have failed
[52:58] a long time ago. You know, I look back
[53:00] at my life so many times and I I I
[53:03] looked at so many decisions in the
[53:04] moment and I thought I'd made mistakes
[53:07] and I'd missed the will of God and I'd
[53:09] overstepped and these different things.
[53:10] And I would say, "How God, how can you
[53:12] be in this if it's so difficult? If it's
[53:14] it seems so broken, if it if it hurts
[53:16] too much, if the offense is too great,
[53:18] if I'm not being used, all these
[53:20] different things." And you look and you
[53:22] say, "Lord, where are you?" But you've
[53:23] got to realize God has to break you down
[53:25] so he can build you up. Amen. And he had
[53:28] a plan for me and he had a purpose for
[53:30] me. And I had to go through a lot of
[53:31] breaking before he could do a lot of
[53:33] building. Amen. And as we were going
[53:35] through those things, amen, I could come
[53:37] to a place where even today I could be a
[53:39] not just a minister, but I could be a
[53:42] pastor. And I didn't get here by my
[53:44] decisions. I didn't get here by my
[53:45] vision, by my strategy, by my foresight.
[53:48] It was the almighty hand of God that
[53:50] brought me to this place cuz I didn't
[53:52] want to be here. Didn't want to be here.
[53:54] I look at brother Garfield raising his
[53:56] hands. I get I'll tell you one thing.
[53:58] Never in his wildest dreams did he ever
[53:59] think I should move to Newfoundland.
[54:01] That's where I want to be. But here he
[54:03] is. And we trust that there's a purpose
[54:06] in those things. Amen. I look at the
[54:08] wife that I got. God had to pre-plan.
[54:11] God had to know where I was going to
[54:13] give me the right kind of wife for what
[54:14] I was going to be. I couldn't pick her.
[54:17] He had to pick her. He had to prepare.
[54:19] And I say, "Lord, praise you. I'll give
[54:21] you the glory for that today that you
[54:23] prepared a wife that could support me in
[54:26] this church in the way that's needed for
[54:27] a pastor's wife. I couldn't pick a
[54:29] pastor's wife. He had to pick a pastor's
[54:31] wife. I just thought I was marrying this
[54:34] pretty Mexican girl.
[54:37] I thought I was making the decision.
[54:39] Church, a child of God, we've got things
[54:41] we can make. Absolutely we can. I'm not
[54:43] saying we don't make our own decisions.
[54:45] But there's pivotal points where God has
[54:47] ordained for you to be somewhere, do
[54:49] something, and he makes sure you do it.
[54:52] Amen. That's what he does when he works
[54:53] with a child of God. Listen, I didn't
[54:55] like all the things that God did with
[54:56] me. I didn't enjoy it all. Can you say
[54:59] amen this morning? We don't always enjoy
[55:01] the work of a a child. No child enjoys
[55:04] chastisement. Nobody enjoys being broken
[55:06] down so that the potter can build us
[55:08] back up again. But if we're going to be
[55:10] of any use in the kingdom, we've got to
[55:12] get into position. And it takes the
[55:14] hands of Almighty God to do that. Amen.
[55:17] I was saying to somebody earlier this
[55:18] week, we'd live a more rested life if we
[55:21] could start with the faith that we
[55:23] usually finish with. When we go through
[55:26] hard times, if we could start with the
[55:28] faith we get at the end, when the
[55:29] trial's over, when we see the purpose,
[55:31] when we see what God was trying to do,
[55:33] if we could by faith say, "This is for
[55:36] my good, and God has a hand in it
[55:39] because my life is dedicated to him. I
[55:42] give him my life. I give him my mind. I
[55:44] give him my decisions. I give him my
[55:45] time. If you have given your all to him,
[55:48] then whatever happens is his handiwork.
[55:51] Amen. And if we could trust him upfront,
[55:53] how do we do that? We believe the word.
[55:55] Romans 8:28, he says, "All things work
[55:58] together for good to them who are the
[56:00] called according to his purpose." He did
[56:04] not say every individual thing is going
[56:07] to be good. He did not say every
[56:09] circumstance, every event, but he says
[56:12] collectively they work for your good,
[56:15] for your eternal good, not this temporal
[56:17] good. Amen. I'm not wanting to be a
[56:20] downer today. We're preaching on good
[56:21] news, but I want to say this. Good news
[56:23] does not always come the way we want it
[56:25] to come. It does not always say the
[56:27] things we want to say. Does not always
[56:28] do the things we want to do. But if it's
[56:30] from God, it is for our good. Amen. And
[56:33] so often we limit him because his ways
[56:35] are higher than our ways. His thoughts
[56:37] are higher than our thoughts. He knows
[56:39] what he's doing. We don't. And we limit
[56:42] him by setting our expectation of what
[56:44] and how he's going to do and when he's
[56:46] going to do it rather than letting him
[56:48] be God and us just be the little puny
[56:50] humans that we are. Amen. He's trying to
[56:53] get us into position. Amen. And he's
[56:55] brought good news to take us there. The
[56:57] angels came to the shepherds and they
[56:59] gave them this wonderful message of hope
[57:01] and love and peace and joy. I want to go
[57:03] back to that this morning because it's
[57:05] the inspiration for the service this
[57:07] morning. And it says there were in the
[57:08] same country shepherds abiding in the
[57:11] field keeping watch over their flock by
[57:13] night. And lo, the angel of the Lord
[57:15] came upon them and the glory of the Lord
[57:17] shone round about them. And they were so
[57:19] afraid. You notice when God starts
[57:20] moving, fear creeps in many times.
[57:23] Church, don't be afraid when God starts
[57:25] moving. God shakes things up a lot of
[57:28] times. Don't be scared when the shaking
[57:29] happens. Scripture says, "Everything
[57:31] that can be shaken will be shaken. But
[57:34] if you're firmly grounded on Christ, the
[57:36] word, you won't be moved." He says, "And
[57:37] the angel said unto them,"Fear not, for
[57:39] behold, I bring you good tidings of
[57:42] great joy, which shall be all people." I
[57:43] went to the Common English Bible for
[57:45] this. I didn't know who was going to be
[57:46] here, but it says this. The angel said,
[57:50] "Don't be afraid. Look, I bring good
[57:53] news to you." And here's the inspiration
[57:55] for the service this morning. wonderful,
[57:58] joyous news for all people. And he said,
[58:00] "For unto you is born this day in the
[58:03] city of David a Savior, which is Christ
[58:05] the Lord." And when you hear that a
[58:06] Savior has come, that ought to make you
[58:08] rejoice. And when you think about where
[58:10] those people were at that time, no doubt
[58:12] this would have absolutely caused their
[58:14] hearts to swell and they would think,
[58:16] "This is it. The Messiah is here. The
[58:18] Savior's here. Life is going to be
[58:19] different because life at that time was
[58:21] so difficult. They were under Roman
[58:24] rule. The Romans had conquered them 63
[58:26] years before. So they were under heavy
[58:28] taxation. They were under oppression.
[58:31] They had a rule that if a Roman asked
[58:33] you to carry something, then you had to
[58:35] carry it for a mile. Didn't matter if
[58:37] you were busy. Didn't matter if you were
[58:38] in an urgent situation. Didn't matter if
[58:40] you had better things to do. They a
[58:42] Roman citizen could walk up to a Jew and
[58:44] just say, "Carry this for me." And you
[58:46] had to carry it a mile because they were
[58:48] the conqueror and you were the
[58:50] conquered. This is what they were living
[58:52] in. They had to ask permission. They
[58:54] couldn't they couldn't have their own
[58:55] laws that they could apply. They
[58:57] couldn't worship freely. Everything was
[58:59] under a Roman's thumb. Amen. And so
[59:01] whatever this this looked like, it
[59:04] wasn't fun. This was their day-to-day
[59:06] life was constant wonder and worry and
[59:09] fear. No freedom. They're in bondage.
[59:11] And 63 years of being under somebody's
[59:13] thumb will wear anybody out. I'm sure
[59:16] they were sick and tired of being sick
[59:18] and tired of these things. Amen. And so
[59:20] they wanted out of this situation. And
[59:22] so they they were believing that this
[59:24] Messiah was going to come and he was
[59:26] going to save them from the Romans.
[59:29] That's what they were looking for. Amen.
[59:31] These were a people that had a promise.
[59:32] They had a word promise of a land that
[59:35] they could have where they could be at
[59:36] rest. A place that would belong to them
[59:39] where God would be their God and they
[59:41] would be his people. And their greatest
[59:43] desire was for that Messiah because they
[59:45] wanted that promised land. They wanted
[59:47] that promised time where they could have
[59:49] peace and rest. And the scripture said
[59:51] of them, you know, that they would build
[59:53] and another would not inhabit and they
[59:54] would plant and another would not reap
[59:56] and and the ox would eat straw and the
[59:59] wolf would lay down with the lamb and
[1:00:00] all these different things. And you
[1:00:02] know, they go back to Isaiah 65 and read
[1:00:05] these things and they were so caught up
[1:00:06] in the benefits of the Messiah that they
[1:00:09] forgot why they needed him in the first
[1:00:10] place. You look at Isaiah 65 where it
[1:00:13] talks about all those promises and it
[1:00:15] starts and it says, "You're a rebellious
[1:00:18] people."
[1:00:19] It tells them their condition. It tells
[1:00:22] them why they got to where they got in
[1:00:24] the first place. And they forgot about
[1:00:26] how they got there. And they started
[1:00:28] focusing on what they were going to get
[1:00:30] when Messiah came.
[1:00:32] And they forgot about the real reason
[1:00:34] why he had to come in the first place
[1:00:36] was that they rebelled constantly. Amen.
[1:00:39] They they worshiped false idols. They
[1:00:41] constantly provoke God to anchor. Anger,
[1:00:43] it says, and they were living by their
[1:00:44] own thoughts, by their own dreams, by
[1:00:46] their own intentions. And that was the
[1:00:48] problem that needed to be resolved. They
[1:00:51] wanted to get rid of the Romans. Amen.
[1:00:52] But the promise of Isaiah 65, if you
[1:00:55] look at it, is actually first to the
[1:00:57] Gentiles
[1:00:58] because of the rebellion of the
[1:01:00] Israelites. The promise is first to the
[1:01:02] Gentiles and then the Israelites get it
[1:01:04] in the millennial kingdom. And then you
[1:01:06] go back to Isaiah 6 and perhaps that was
[1:01:08] the greatest one that they looked to
[1:01:10] because it said that the Messiah would
[1:01:12] stand up for the poor and he would bring
[1:01:14] equity to those that were suffering and
[1:01:16] he would have a rod of authority that
[1:01:18] would strike their enemies and and those
[1:01:20] that were harming God's people. And so
[1:01:22] they were all set up for a deliverer.
[1:01:25] They were set up for a prophet like unto
[1:01:27] Moses to deliver them. And Moses
[1:01:29] delivered them out of Egypt,
[1:01:32] but he never delivered them from
[1:01:34] themselves. And so only two went into
[1:01:36] the promised land.
[1:01:38] He delivered them out of their natural
[1:01:40] condition, but it never brought them
[1:01:41] into the promised land because they
[1:01:44] didn't change. Only the circumstance
[1:01:45] changed.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Right? And so I look at at at these
[1:01:49] verses in Isaiah 65 and Isaiah 6, and we
[1:01:51] won't go there for the sake of time this
[1:01:53] morning, but I can imagine the
[1:01:54] priesthood preaching these things and
[1:01:56] say the Messiah is coming and look at
[1:01:58] the conditions we're around and he's
[1:01:59] going to deliver us from these
[1:02:01] conditions.
[1:02:02] They would have preached, "One day the
[1:02:04] Roman rule will be off of us. One day
[1:02:05] we'll be out from under the thumb of
[1:02:07] these Romans. One day we won't have to
[1:02:09] walk a mile for them. One day we're
[1:02:11] going to be set free."
[1:02:14] And they would have been preaching all
[1:02:16] those things. And it's I find honestly
[1:02:17] it's the same thing today where
[1:02:19] everybody's preaching about the freedom,
[1:02:21] but nobody's preaching about the
[1:02:22] condition.
[1:02:24] Everybody's preaching about the
[1:02:25] authority. Everybody's preaching about
[1:02:26] the power, but nobody's talking about
[1:02:29] where are you at and what's going on in
[1:02:31] your soul.
[1:02:33] Have you recognized your true condition
[1:02:35] and what needs to be changed?
[1:02:38] Because you can be healed every day of
[1:02:39] your life and still go to hell. You can
[1:02:42] be set free from your financial burdens
[1:02:44] and still go to hell. You can come to
[1:02:46] church every day and still go to hell.
[1:02:48] We're so often looking for the
[1:02:50] circumstances to change and that's not
[1:02:52] what he came to do. The problem is you
[1:02:56] can't fix the problem by changing the
[1:02:59] situation.
[1:03:01] That's what we all want. We're all
[1:03:02] praying for situ I'm not I'm not saying
[1:03:05] all of us. You know what I mean? The
[1:03:06] royal you people pray God changed the
[1:03:09] situation.
[1:03:13] Problem with that is when that situation
[1:03:14] goes away, there's just another one that
[1:03:16] comes down the road and a next one and a
[1:03:18] next one and the next one and all you're
[1:03:20] consumed with is God change the
[1:03:22] situation rather than God give me a way
[1:03:24] to go through the situation with
[1:03:26] victory. God, give me a way to go
[1:03:28] through these things where I can give
[1:03:30] you the glory, where I can have peace
[1:03:32] and rest in these times. Amen. And why
[1:03:34] is that? It because you just go from one
[1:03:36] situation to another situation because
[1:03:38] you're stuck in your own humanity. We're
[1:03:40] stuck in a broken condition. We're stuck
[1:03:42] in a broken world. And that means
[1:03:43] situations are going to come up no
[1:03:45] matter what. Jesus said, "You're going
[1:03:47] to have hard times. You're going to have
[1:03:49] persecution in this world." He never
[1:03:51] promised that would go away. You know,
[1:03:53] we're coming up to the new year and it's
[1:03:54] a time when people make New Year's
[1:03:56] resolutions where they make plans. They
[1:03:59] say, "There's going to be a new me. I'm
[1:04:01] going to uh stop doing this. I'm going
[1:04:02] to start doing that. I'm going to do
[1:04:04] better here and I'm going to do better
[1:04:05] there." And most make it less than seven
[1:04:07] weeks before they're right back to their
[1:04:09] original condition. And most go further
[1:04:11] than they were before.
[1:04:14] As you go back, you slide even deeper
[1:04:15] into the very thing you were trying to
[1:04:17] get out of. If you wanted to lose
[1:04:19] weight, you wanted to go to the gym, you
[1:04:20] go and most are out by seven weeks and
[1:04:22] they're back and they're heavier and
[1:04:23] less fit than they were when they
[1:04:24] started because the failure brings them
[1:04:27] into a a lower state of being and they
[1:04:30] just go back and they're even worse than
[1:04:31] they were. Why is it church? They tried
[1:04:34] to change their results without changing
[1:04:36] who they were. You can't do that. We can
[1:04:38] sit here all day long. We can say,
[1:04:39] "Lord, I need healing. Lord, I need a
[1:04:41] house. Lord, I need a car. Lord, I need
[1:04:43] a new job. Lord, I I need a a spouse. I
[1:04:45] need a place to live." And those things
[1:04:47] are true, but that is not our greatest
[1:04:49] need this morning. That's not our
[1:04:51] greatest need. But we think it is
[1:04:53] because that's what consumes our
[1:04:55] feelings. It's what consumes our five
[1:04:56] senses. It's what can consume our mind.
[1:04:59] But like I said, there's always going to
[1:05:00] be another burden. There's always going
[1:05:02] to be another situation. There's always
[1:05:04] going to be another problem, another
[1:05:06] issue around the corner. And we're never
[1:05:07] going to get away from it, church. Until
[1:05:09] we go into eternity, we will not get
[1:05:11] away from it. Even in the millennial
[1:05:13] reign, we'll still have problems.
[1:05:16] We've got to rule with the rod of iron
[1:05:18] in the millennial kingdom kingdom. That
[1:05:20] ain't because everything is perfect.
[1:05:23] No. Satan's bound by chains of
[1:05:25] circumstance, but you're dealing with
[1:05:27] still dealing with people that are going
[1:05:28] to have problems there. Amen.
[1:05:32] Salvation, a savior, is not about saving
[1:05:35] us from circumstances.
[1:05:37] That's just what our humanity wants.
[1:05:40] Save me from my circumstances. We want
[1:05:42] to be saved from the pain. We want to be
[1:05:43] saved from the suffering, from the
[1:05:45] worry, the difficulty. And our idea of
[1:05:47] salvation is take away the things that
[1:05:49] cause us that pain and worry or take
[1:05:52] away the circumstances of them. Amen.
[1:05:56] But church, we've got to be able to have
[1:05:58] peace in the storm.
[1:06:01] Whether the storm goes or whether the
[1:06:02] storm stays, we've got to be able to
[1:06:04] have peace in the storm. Amen. We need
[1:06:06] love not for those that are lovable, for
[1:06:10] those that are unlovable.
[1:06:13] We need to have kindness for those that
[1:06:15] don't deserve it.
[1:06:17] We need to have peace when everything
[1:06:19] around us is falling apart. And it is.
[1:06:22] It's broken. Everything's falling apart.
[1:06:24] We don't need the circumstances to
[1:06:26] change because the circumstances are
[1:06:28] there for purpose.
[1:06:31] But we're the one that needs to be
[1:06:32] changed. Amen. The freedom that Israel
[1:06:36] wanted had never lasted in the past.
[1:06:40] Once David left, once Solomon left, they
[1:06:43] never really could stick it out.
[1:06:46] They were in and out. They were up and
[1:06:49] down. They'd serve God. They they'd fall
[1:06:51] away. They'd come back to God. They'd
[1:06:52] fall away. And then eventually, they
[1:06:53] just fell away, church, and they stayed
[1:06:56] away. And it was just one person, one
[1:06:58] country after another. Amen. So God
[1:07:01] wasn't there to give them the freedom
[1:07:03] they wanted because that freedom didn't
[1:07:04] work. God had to come with a salvation
[1:07:07] that was greater than what they
[1:07:09] realized. God couldn't give them what
[1:07:10] they wanted because that wouldn't do
[1:07:11] them any good. God had to give them what
[1:07:13] they needed. And that's what God's here
[1:07:15] to do. Amen. I want you to hear what God
[1:07:18] had to say about the savior and what he
[1:07:20] would do.
[1:07:22] Says, "Then Joseph, her husband, you
[1:07:24] know, he finds out Mary's pregnant." He
[1:07:26] says, "Being a just man, not willing to
[1:07:28] make her a public example, was minded to
[1:07:29] put her away privately. So, he was
[1:07:31] engaged to her. She's pregnant, and he
[1:07:32] was just going to put her away and and
[1:07:34] not tell anybody about it. Just just let
[1:07:36] it go." But while he thought on these
[1:07:38] things, behold, the angel of the Lord
[1:07:40] appeared unto him in a dream, saying
[1:07:41] Joseph, thou son of David. Fear not to
[1:07:44] take unto thee, Mary thy wife, for that
[1:07:45] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:07:48] Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son,
[1:07:50] and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for
[1:07:52] he shall save his people from their
[1:07:56] sins.
[1:07:58] He's going to save them from their sins.
[1:07:59] The angels come and they say, "We've got
[1:08:01] good news." And everybody says, "Great.
[1:08:03] The Romans are going to go." No, that
[1:08:05] was not the good news. The good news is
[1:08:06] I'm going to fix your condition. I'm
[1:08:09] going to con fix the thing that brought
[1:08:11] the Romans here in the first place. And
[1:08:14] before them, the Persians and the
[1:08:15] Babylonians and the Egyptians and the
[1:08:17] Philistines and all these different
[1:08:18] things. Church, I'm going to fix the
[1:08:20] root of the problem.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And it's you. I'm going to fix you. I'm
[1:08:25] going to fix the condition that brought
[1:08:27] you here. Amen. The good news is not
[1:08:29] that we can cope with life, brother
[1:08:31] Garfield. Is it? The good news is that
[1:08:33] eternal life is for us. That before time
[1:08:36] began, God had a thought of us and he
[1:08:39] spoke it and he wrote it and he's
[1:08:41] calling us back to him. And so we don't
[1:08:43] have to go through this life coping. We
[1:08:45] can walk through this life with
[1:08:46] confidence and faith that God is with us
[1:08:51] that he loves us and he cares for us.
[1:08:53] The s the angel said to Joseph, he says,
[1:08:55] "This this this savior is going to save
[1:08:58] them from their sins. Not from their
[1:09:00] earthly circumstances, not from their
[1:09:02] hardships, not from their difficulties.
[1:09:05] No, he's going to save them from what
[1:09:07] keeps defeating them.
[1:09:10] What? Their sins, their unbelief, their
[1:09:12] inability to stick with the word of God.
[1:09:16] That's it. I'm going to make it so you
[1:09:19] can live a law you couldn't live before.
[1:09:22] I'm going to write it on your heart. I'm
[1:09:23] going to fill you with my spirit. I'm
[1:09:24] going to save you from your unbelief.
[1:09:26] Not the Romans, not the Philistines, not
[1:09:28] the Babylonians, the Persians, all these
[1:09:30] different ones. No. What kept defeating
[1:09:32] them was their own fallen nature. And
[1:09:36] that's what he came to save them from.
[1:09:37] Amen. Their habits, their their their
[1:09:39] ways of thinking, all these different
[1:09:41] things, their arrogance of thinking that
[1:09:43] they knew best. And worst of all, the
[1:09:45] religious cloak that covered it up that
[1:09:47] said, "I don't need to change. Everyone
[1:09:48] and everything else needs to change."
[1:09:51] Church, when all your prayers are for
[1:09:52] somebody else to be changed, you're in a
[1:09:54] backsliding condition cuz we are all in
[1:09:56] a process of being changed. We're all in
[1:09:58] a process where God is working in our
[1:10:00] life. Amen. He's got to come and save
[1:10:02] them from themselves. That's what he's
[1:10:05] trying to do. Remember what John would
[1:10:07] say. He said, "Beloved, I wish above all
[1:10:08] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[1:10:10] in health." We're praying for a lot of
[1:10:13] sick people these days. We're praying
[1:10:15] for a lot of rough situations. But he
[1:10:17] says, "I want you to prosper in health."
[1:10:22] Prosper and be in health even as your
[1:10:24] soul prospers. Amen. God is the savior
[1:10:29] of our soul.
[1:10:31] This flesh is not going anywhere.
[1:10:34] This flesh is unconverted. It's going to
[1:10:36] fight us the rest of our life. So God is
[1:10:38] saving our soul first. And the flesh,
[1:10:40] church, is a very distant second
[1:10:43] because it has to be completely changed.
[1:10:46] It has to be glorified to do anything
[1:10:48] that is of any value to us. Amen. And we
[1:10:50] see that in the scriptures. God makes
[1:10:52] let people's lives miserable. God will
[1:10:54] put them on their sick bed. He'll let
[1:10:56] people get in tough situations. He'll
[1:10:58] let people get so broken that they don't
[1:11:00] think they can be fixed.
[1:11:03] Why? Cuz this flesh has no value to him.
[1:11:06] He's here for a soul. Amen. And it's to
[1:11:08] get people to a place where they need
[1:11:10] something greater than they've got.
[1:11:13] greater than what they are. Self-help is
[1:11:16] no help, church, because self is broken
[1:11:19] and it's been broken since that faithful
[1:11:22] day in Eden. Amen. It's fallen from its
[1:11:24] original position. We need Christ to
[1:11:26] change us. Amen. To lead us and to guide
[1:11:28] us. You know, they say the definition of
[1:11:30] insanity is doing the same thing over
[1:11:32] and over and expecting different
[1:11:33] results. And Israel did the same thing
[1:11:36] over and over and somehow expected that
[1:11:39] things would work out differently. And
[1:11:41] it never did. Amen. They had the same
[1:11:43] cycle of the ups and downs and the ever
[1:11:45] ins and outs and they never could come
[1:11:47] to a stabilized place, a place of rest,
[1:11:50] a place of security. They couldn't they
[1:11:52] wouldn't stay close to God in and of
[1:11:54] themselves. They just couldn't do it.
[1:11:56] Amen. They could never get out of their
[1:11:59] own way.
[1:12:01] Anybody else ever run into that? Just
[1:12:04] can't get out of my own way. Just keep
[1:12:06] making the same mistakes.
[1:12:08] Keep falling into the same pit.
[1:12:12] keep falling down the stairs at the same
[1:12:13] place at the same time.
[1:12:17] They looked at the Romans and they said,
[1:12:19] "They're the problem." No, they were
[1:12:20] tools in the hands of God and every
[1:12:23] other one before that. God would raise
[1:12:25] them up. God would use them and then God
[1:12:27] would destroy them. You ever read that?
[1:12:29] Go back and read Isaiah and Jeremiah.
[1:12:31] God will raise up a a country to take
[1:12:33] over Israel and then he'll he'll
[1:12:35] absolutely demolish them because they
[1:12:37] touched his children Israel. [laughter]
[1:12:40] You can't tell me there aren't classes
[1:12:41] of people in this gospel. God has his
[1:12:44] children and then there's everyone else.
[1:12:47] Amen. I'm glad we've got a God that
[1:12:49] knows better than we do. Amen. That he
[1:12:52] doesn't sit there and listen to what we
[1:12:53] think about the situation cuz God knows
[1:12:55] our real situation. God knows our real
[1:12:58] condition. God knows where we're at in
[1:12:59] our heart. Amen. Everyone else doesn't
[1:13:02] know. We don't even know. Like I I keep
[1:13:05] promising, we're going to preach on
[1:13:06] blind spots here in the not too distant
[1:13:08] future. We don't even know where our
[1:13:10] problems are, but God knows
[1:13:14] and our spouse
[1:13:16] if we've got one.
[1:13:18] God knows where the problems are.
[1:13:21] I want you to see this now. I want you
[1:13:24] to see what a savior does today because
[1:13:25] the gospel has not changed. The gospel
[1:13:28] has not changed. What worked then works
[1:13:31] today. Amen. God doesn't change. His
[1:13:34] ways don't change. The first recorded
[1:13:36] sermon we have for Jesus is two chapters
[1:13:38] later in Luke chapter 4. And it was a
[1:13:40] fulfillment of the prophecy of the
[1:13:42] Messiah. And now remember Jesus has come
[1:13:44] down. He'd been baptized at Jordan by
[1:13:46] John and the Holy Spirit comes in him.
[1:13:48] The fullness of God now comes into a
[1:13:49] human body. God dwelling in flesh. He
[1:13:52] goes into the desert for 40 days. He's
[1:13:54] tempted by Satan. He completely
[1:13:56] annihilates Satan, defeats him at every
[1:13:57] turn. And then he comes back out and he
[1:13:59] starts his ministry. And I want you to
[1:14:01] hear now and see how he starts his
[1:14:03] ministry.
[1:14:04] It says, "And Jesus returned in the
[1:14:06] power of the spirit into Galilee, and
[1:14:08] there went out a fame of him throughout
[1:14:10] all the region and roundabout. And he
[1:14:12] taught in their synagogues, being
[1:14:14] glorified of all." So he was showing
[1:14:16] signs and wonders, and he was preaching
[1:14:17] in their churches. And he came to
[1:14:19] Nazareth, where he had been brought up.
[1:14:21] And as his custom was, he went into the
[1:14:23] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:14:25] up for to read. Jesus went to church
[1:14:27] habitually. You know, we've got a real
[1:14:30] push against people going to church
[1:14:31] these days. Jesus went habitually.
[1:14:35] He says, "And there was delivered unto
[1:14:37] him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And
[1:14:39] when he had opened the book, he found
[1:14:40] the place where it was written." And
[1:14:42] here we go. Now, this is from Isaiah. He
[1:14:45] says, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:14:48] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:14:50] the gospel to the
[1:14:54] poor."
[1:14:56] Who's he coming for? The poor. Who are
[1:15:00] the poor? That word means beggarly,
[1:15:04] worthless.
[1:15:06] He's anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:15:09] the beggarly and the worthless.
[1:15:14] What do they look like? He says, "He has
[1:15:15] sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
[1:15:19] those that have been battered, those
[1:15:21] that have been crushed, those that have
[1:15:24] been shattered." He says, "To preach, to
[1:15:27] proclaim, to announce deliverance to the
[1:15:29] captives." Now this word captives is
[1:15:31] very interesting because the literal
[1:15:33] translation is to preach deliverance to
[1:15:35] the spears.
[1:15:39] See in those days they didn't say how
[1:15:42] many. They they'd say how big is the
[1:15:44] army? And they'd say they've got 10,000
[1:15:46] spears.
[1:15:48] They were identified by the weapons that
[1:15:50] they carried.
[1:15:52] And what is he saying? He's saying we've
[1:15:54] got soldiers bound in prison that can't
[1:15:56] fight anymore.
[1:15:58] people that are meant to be out there
[1:16:01] destroying the works of Satan that are
[1:16:03] bound in a place that they can't get out
[1:16:05] of and they can't fight anymore. It
[1:16:07] means prisoners of war.
[1:16:10] So to preach deliverance to the
[1:16:12] prisoners of war and recovering of sight
[1:16:14] to the blind. They used to see, now they
[1:16:17] can't see. That word blind doesn't mean
[1:16:20] that they are completely blind. It means
[1:16:21] things are smoky. They're opaque.
[1:16:24] It's like you can you you know there's
[1:16:26] something there but it has no
[1:16:27] definition. You've lost the sense of
[1:16:30] what is correct of what is true.
[1:16:34] He says and to set at liberty them that
[1:16:37] are bruised. That word set at liberty
[1:16:39] actually means send out. And there's a
[1:16:42] beautiful thing here because that word
[1:16:43] the root word of bruised
[1:16:46] or that root that root of to set at
[1:16:47] liberty is the root word is apostle. He
[1:16:51] says to make apostles of those that are
[1:16:54] bruised, those that are oppressed, those
[1:16:56] that are crushed. So Jesus is saying,
[1:16:58] I'm going to take those out that are
[1:17:00] completely beat up by their humanity, by
[1:17:03] their circumstances, by their
[1:17:05] situations, by their genealogy, by their
[1:17:07] family traditions, religious traditions,
[1:17:09] whatever it might be. I'm going to take
[1:17:11] those that are so completely beat up
[1:17:13] that they can't do anything, and I'm
[1:17:15] going to send them out. And I'm going to
[1:17:17] turn them into apostles. I'm going to
[1:17:19] turn them into messengers. I'm going to
[1:17:20] turn them into people that can do
[1:17:22] something for the kingdom. And he says,
[1:17:24] I'm anointed to preach the acceptable
[1:17:27] year of the Lord, to proclaim, to
[1:17:29] announce that this is the year, this is
[1:17:31] the time of the Lord's favor and
[1:17:34] approval. Hallelujah.
[1:17:37] It says, "And he closed the book, and he
[1:17:39] gave it again to the minister and sat
[1:17:41] down. And the eyes of all them that were
[1:17:43] in the synagogue were fastened on him.
[1:17:45] And he began to say unto them, "This day
[1:17:48] is this scripture fulfilled in your
[1:17:50] ears." In other words, Jesus is saying,
[1:17:52] "It starts today." You have been waiting
[1:17:55] for hundreds and hundreds of years for
[1:17:57] this scripture to be fulfilled. And he
[1:17:59] says, "It starts today." It's here right
[1:18:02] now. It's right in front of you. Amen.
[1:18:04] And church, what did he do after he said
[1:18:06] those words? Did he go out and destroy
[1:18:09] the Roman garrison in Jerusalem? Did he
[1:18:11] go and kick Pilate out of the palace?
[1:18:14] Did he go and scatter the enemies to the
[1:18:15] four corners of the earth? No. It says,
[1:18:18] "And all bear him witness and wondered
[1:18:22] at the gracious words which proceeded
[1:18:25] out of his mouth
[1:18:27] and said, "Is not this Joseph's son?"
[1:18:33] How was he setting them free?
[1:18:36] He preached gracious words.
[1:18:39] And you know what happened, church?
[1:18:40] after he preached these gracious words.
[1:18:42] You go down just a few verses later and
[1:18:45] they tried to kill him.
[1:18:48] He's preaching liberty. He's preaching
[1:18:51] deliverance. He's preaching healing.
[1:18:53] He's preaching sight. And they went and
[1:18:56] they tried to kill him. Do you know why,
[1:18:58] church? Because he pointed to their
[1:19:02] condition.
[1:19:04] He pointed to their condition and he
[1:19:06] said, "Listen, look in the days of of
[1:19:08] Elijah and Elisha." He says, "There were
[1:19:10] many widows, but he went to a gentile
[1:19:12] widow. And there were many lepers, but
[1:19:15] there was only one gentile that was
[1:19:17] healed of leprosy." And what was he
[1:19:19] saying? He was saying, "Listen, you that
[1:19:21] call yourself the people of God have an
[1:19:24] awfully bad track record of accepting
[1:19:26] God's messengers, of recognizing the
[1:19:29] word when it comes your way." And
[1:19:31] church, he was trying to show them this
[1:19:34] can change.
[1:19:36] But instead they were offended at what
[1:19:39] he said and they tried to kill him. They
[1:19:42] were the natural seed of Abraham,
[1:19:45] but they were not the spiritual seed of
[1:19:46] Abraham because they couldn't receive
[1:19:48] the word of God. Listen to this. He
[1:19:52] says, "Now, how could those people ever
[1:19:54] to have failed to see who he was? How
[1:19:56] did they ever miss it? How could it be
[1:19:58] when it was so plainly made known and
[1:20:00] showed? How could they have ever missed
[1:20:02] seeing it? What a word." He says, "Think
[1:20:03] of it. This day is a scripture fulfilled
[1:20:06] before your ears. Who said it? God
[1:20:08] himself. Who's the interpreter of his
[1:20:10] own word? This day is a scripture
[1:20:11] fulfilled. The Messiah himself standing
[1:20:14] in the presence of the congregation and
[1:20:17] reading the word out of the Bible
[1:20:18] pertaining to himself and then saying,
[1:20:20] "Today this scriptures fulfilled and
[1:20:22] they still failed to see it." He came in
[1:20:25] power and authority and demonstration
[1:20:27] doing exactly what the word said and
[1:20:28] they missed it. He says, "What a tragedy
[1:20:31] that would be, but it's happened. It's
[1:20:33] happened many times. He says, "How could
[1:20:35] it happen?" Of course, he says, "It's
[1:20:37] like it did in other times by believing
[1:20:39] man's interpretation of the word."
[1:20:42] That's what caused it. Those believers
[1:20:44] in those days, so-called believers, were
[1:20:46] taking the interpretation of what the
[1:20:48] priest had said about the scripture.
[1:20:51] Therefore, Jesus, not belonging to any
[1:20:53] of their ranks or their societies, he
[1:20:55] was excommunicated from their company.
[1:20:57] and therefore they could not identify
[1:20:59] him with them because he was different
[1:21:02] from them.
[1:21:05] He says the person of Jesus Christ was
[1:21:08] so unique that no one should have
[1:21:10] missing that that was the son of God
[1:21:12] because he was the perfect
[1:21:14] identification of the scripture that was
[1:21:17] written of him.
[1:21:21] And then he says that's the way any
[1:21:25] Christian is known when his life
[1:21:28] identifies the very things that the
[1:21:31] Christian is supposed to do. Not words
[1:21:34] only his life.
[1:21:36] He says now how could he stand there and
[1:21:38] say this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:21:40] right before your eyes. How outstanding.
[1:21:43] How so plainly and yet those people
[1:21:45] misunderstood. He said why? It's because
[1:21:48] they took the interpretation of some
[1:21:50] order of priests that they were
[1:21:52] listening to.
[1:21:55] They missed the good news because they
[1:21:57] had a different message that had already
[1:21:58] filled their head.
[1:22:02] They were full up already.
[1:22:05] They didn't need anything else. They had
[1:22:07] already decided that they had all the
[1:22:09] truth, that they have figured it out.
[1:22:10] You know, I've said this before. I'll
[1:22:12] say it again. And I'd rather witness to
[1:22:13] somebody that doesn't know Christ than
[1:22:15] somebody that says they do. Because the
[1:22:18] one that doesn't know him can accept
[1:22:19] truth. The one that does believe they've
[1:22:21] already received him and known him.
[1:22:23] You've got to beat down a bunch of
[1:22:25] denominational walls to get to the
[1:22:27] truth. And it's so hard to do. Every
[1:22:30] single messenger of God and God himself
[1:22:33] dealt with it. People that had already
[1:22:35] decided what the word meant rather than
[1:22:38] letting God interpret it by bringing it
[1:22:40] to pass.
[1:22:42] What did it make them do, church? Made
[1:22:44] them reject their own Messiah.
[1:22:48] Made them reject the word made flesh.
[1:22:50] Reject the only one that could restore
[1:22:52] their sight, that could heal their
[1:22:54] condition, that could set them free and
[1:22:56] make them of use. Amen. Church, Jesus
[1:22:58] said, "It's the blind leading the
[1:23:00] blind." And light came and stood before
[1:23:03] them. And they rejected it. And they
[1:23:06] walked back out more blind than ever.
[1:23:08] And then wondered why nothing ever
[1:23:10] changed.
[1:23:11] How could it change? Their condition
[1:23:13] wasn't changed. You can't get different
[1:23:16] results by being the same person. And so
[1:23:19] they walked away and they lost every
[1:23:21] opportunity that they had to be set
[1:23:23] free. I'm here to tell you, church, you
[1:23:26] don't have to stay where things don't
[1:23:27] change.
[1:23:28] But the change has to start in here.
[1:23:31] That's the good news. The change has to
[1:23:33] start in here before he can start
[1:23:35] working on our circumstances. Amen. We
[1:23:38] don't have to have this mindset of
[1:23:39] always working and never finding the
[1:23:41] solution.
[1:23:42] We don't have to walk around bound by
[1:23:44] these things. Amen. This is the good
[1:23:46] news. Christ came with good news. And
[1:23:48] the good news is this. You can go free
[1:23:52] today.
[1:23:53] Today.
[1:23:55] Today is the day of salvation.
[1:23:58] Amen. Today the scripture is fulfilled
[1:24:02] in your ears. And he said, "This is
[1:24:04] what's possible.
[1:24:06] You're brokenhearted. I can heal it.
[1:24:09] You're blind. I can open your eyes.
[1:24:11] You're bound up and can't move. I can
[1:24:13] get you moving. But you got to take the
[1:24:15] light. You got to take the word when it
[1:24:17] comes your way. Amen. Church, I can't
[1:24:19] promise your situation's going to
[1:24:21] change. I can't promise your
[1:24:23] relationships are going to change. I
[1:24:24] can't promise you your finances are
[1:24:25] going to change. But I'm saying you can
[1:24:27] go free today. You can go free today.
[1:24:30] Amen. Jesus said, "I'm anointed to set
[1:24:33] people free.
[1:24:36] He didn't say, "I'm anointed to change
[1:24:38] all your situations." He said, "I'm
[1:24:40] anointed to set you free today."
[1:24:43] And that's what he offers every single
[1:24:44] time. He says, "I'm here to preach to
[1:24:46] the poor, the beggarly, the worthless."
[1:24:49] You know what we call him today, church?
[1:24:51] I'm here to preach freedom to the
[1:24:53] losers.
[1:24:57] To the losers.
[1:24:59] We say, "I'm not a loser." How's your
[1:25:02] victory track record look like?
[1:25:05] Because church, we're all losers.
[1:25:08] Oh, we build ourselves up. We say,
[1:25:09] "Well, I'm better than brother so and so
[1:25:11] or sister so and so, or I look at that
[1:25:12] person out in the world and I got way
[1:25:14] more than they do." Church, without him,
[1:25:15] we are losers. We cannot save ourselves
[1:25:18] and we're all going to the bad place. We
[1:25:20] lose and we lose and we lose. Eternally,
[1:25:24] we lose without him. Oh, some of us can
[1:25:27] make money and some of us can have good
[1:25:29] jobs and we can be No, no, no. That's
[1:25:31] not winning. That's temporal and it all
[1:25:34] fades away.
[1:25:37] Winning is the eternal side of things
[1:25:40] when we can look at that. Amen.
[1:25:42] Jesus would later say, he said, "Listen,
[1:25:45] those that are whole don't need a
[1:25:46] physician. Those that are healthy don't
[1:25:48] need a physician." He says, "It's the
[1:25:49] sick that need a physician." He says, "I
[1:25:51] came for the sick." He says, "I didn't
[1:25:53] come to call the righteous." And the
[1:25:55] word there is the self-righteous. I
[1:25:57] didn't come for them. And he says, "I
[1:25:58] came to call those that know they're a
[1:26:00] sinner, that know they're broken,
[1:26:04] those that know that they can't make
[1:26:05] it." And he didn't just preach it with
[1:26:07] words. He went out and he demonstrated
[1:26:09] what he was talking about. Not to the
[1:26:11] Romans. The Romans had nothing to fear
[1:26:14] from Jesus. He died under Roman rule,
[1:26:17] under Roman law. The Romans had nothing
[1:26:20] to fear. What had to fear? Satan.
[1:26:23] Because he went out and he started
[1:26:24] breaking change and he started opening
[1:26:26] eyes. Amen. Jesus was there for the lost
[1:26:29] sheep. He said, he said, "I've come for
[1:26:31] the lost. I've come for the sick. I've
[1:26:32] come for those that know they're a
[1:26:34] sinner." The one of the first things he
[1:26:35] did, church, was he went and he cleaned
[1:26:37] up Mary Magdalene's life. Scripture says
[1:26:40] she had seven demons. It doesn't tell us
[1:26:42] what they were. Now, if I were to guess
[1:26:44] in those days, a woman that was
[1:26:46] demonpossessed is probably the same as
[1:26:47] today. I'll bet you, this is brother
[1:26:50] John, this is not scriptural because
[1:26:51] again, it's silent. She was probably a
[1:26:54] loser.
[1:26:55] She was probably on welfare. She
[1:26:57] probably had common law relationships.
[1:26:59] She maybe she had a teenage pregnancy.
[1:27:02] Maybe she was a drug or an alcohol
[1:27:03] addict. We don't know. But I'll tell you
[1:27:06] this, Mary was not somebody you'd look
[1:27:07] at and say, "That's a child of God." She
[1:27:10] was bound completely by seven demons.
[1:27:12] And one of the first miracles he did was
[1:27:14] he set her free to do what? Serve him.
[1:27:20] And she stuck with him when nobody else
[1:27:22] would stick. She was one of the only
[1:27:24] ones that was always there.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Why? One moment in the presence of
[1:27:28] Christ. Amen. That woman at the well
[1:27:31] church, she was the worst church member
[1:27:34] of church members.
[1:27:36] She was the worst. The absolute worst.
[1:27:39] This was a woman that went with man
[1:27:41] after man, never learning her lesson,
[1:27:44] always ending up in divorce, always
[1:27:46] ending up in disgrace. five divorces,
[1:27:49] gets up with another guy now, and she's
[1:27:51] living common law because she can't even
[1:27:52] get him to marry her. She's failed time
[1:27:56] and time again. And we look at that
[1:27:58] woman, and we'd say, "Worthless, broken,
[1:28:00] loser, unworthy. Why would you waste
[1:28:03] your time, Brother John?"
[1:28:07] But Jesus said, "I have to go by
[1:28:11] Samaria."
[1:28:14] Church, we are looking for the last
[1:28:16] seat.
[1:28:17] And if we got to dig in the dirt to get
[1:28:20] it, I say, "Lord, give me a good shovel.
[1:28:23] Give me patience to keep digging. Give
[1:28:26] me patience to keep turning things over.
[1:28:28] Patience to give people their
[1:28:30] opportunity." Amen. We're not here to
[1:28:33] say who's seed and who's not. We're here
[1:28:36] to shine the light. We're here to give
[1:28:38] them the good news. Amen. This woman had
[1:28:40] a broken record of making the same
[1:28:44] stupid mistake
[1:28:48] over and over again.
[1:28:53] That was her life story.
[1:28:57] Gotchi's enjoying the service this
[1:28:58] evening, this morning. [snorts] The same
[1:29:01] broken record. Those are the ones we
[1:29:04] think are hopeless. They just can't seem
[1:29:07] to get it. and church. And we can sit in
[1:29:10] this church and be a broken record.
[1:29:14] Hey church, we've all got battles to
[1:29:15] fight. We've all got battles to fight.
[1:29:18] And just cuz somebody doesn't see mine
[1:29:20] doesn't mean I don't have a broken
[1:29:21] record in my life, too. Come on. Amen.
[1:29:24] We're going to Listen, we got to This is
[1:29:26] This is church. We got to be real. I've
[1:29:28] got to be as real as you are. I'm asking
[1:29:29] you to be. Amen. We've all got broken
[1:29:32] records, but he's here to say, "Listen,
[1:29:34] I can set you free from your broken
[1:29:35] record. We can break the record.
[1:29:38] The track record is the past. Paul said,
[1:29:40] "Forgetting those things which are
[1:29:42] behind, I press towards the prize for
[1:29:44] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[1:29:46] Jesus."
[1:29:48] That woman at the well could never
[1:29:50] realize she was the problem. And if she
[1:29:54] did, she couldn't fix it.
[1:29:57] The problem wasn't men. The problem was
[1:30:00] the woman.
[1:30:02] The problem was that she kept thinking
[1:30:04] that man's going to satisfy this desire
[1:30:06] I have in myself and it never did. Five
[1:30:11] straight marriages living with a six.
[1:30:13] But one day she meets Jesus and he has a
[1:30:15] personal conversation. And I want you to
[1:30:17] recognize something church. He has the
[1:30:20] same conversation with her that he had
[1:30:23] with those in Luke 2, Luke 4, sorry,
[1:30:26] where he goes and he points to their
[1:30:28] track record.
[1:30:30] And he comes to this woman and he
[1:30:32] exposes her track record.
[1:30:36] And where everybody else gets offended
[1:30:38] and kill wants to kill him, you know
[1:30:40] what she says?
[1:30:45] She says, "I know when Messiah comes,
[1:30:47] he'll tell us these things.
[1:30:53] He'll show us what we need to get fixed.
[1:30:57] and he'll not only tell us, but he'll
[1:31:00] give us the solution. And he said, "If
[1:31:02] you drink of the water that I have,
[1:31:04] you'll never thirst again." Cuz he knew
[1:31:07] there was a thirst that was driving her
[1:31:09] back to man after man after man. And
[1:31:13] there was something in her heart that
[1:31:14] was thirsting. And when a man came and
[1:31:17] said, "You're right. You don't have a
[1:31:18] husband. You've had five, and the one
[1:31:20] you're living with is no longer is not
[1:31:22] even your husband." She said, "I know
[1:31:24] that when Messiah comes, he'll tell us
[1:31:25] these things." Everyone else wants to
[1:31:28] kill him. [clears throat] Everyone else
[1:31:30] says, "You're of the devil." And she
[1:31:32] says, "We know Messiah when he comes,
[1:31:34] he'll tell us these things." And he
[1:31:35] says, "I am he that speaketh unto thee."
[1:31:38] Hallelujah. That woman that nobody would
[1:31:42] think had any value was worth 10,000
[1:31:46] worlds to God Almighty. To where he
[1:31:48] would go into Samaria, he would take the
[1:31:50] longer road. He would take the the the
[1:31:52] the the
[1:31:54] people scoffing at him. The rejection of
[1:31:58] going to a place of half and half
[1:32:00] believers.
[1:32:02] Why? To find that woman who had
[1:32:04] something that was more valuable than
[1:32:06] everybody else. She had a soul that was
[1:32:10] crying out for and could receive the
[1:32:12] word of God.
[1:32:15] Buried under the muck of five divorces
[1:32:17] and a common law relationship.
[1:32:20] Church, does God know how to find his
[1:32:21] children? God knows how to find his
[1:32:24] children. It doesn't matter what you've
[1:32:26] got covering you up this morning. God
[1:32:28] knows what he's doing. Amen. Remember
[1:32:33] that woman after he talks to her,
[1:32:35] remember it says, "I'm here to set
[1:32:38] uh to bring deliverance to the captives,
[1:32:41] to get the spears working again." And as
[1:32:44] soon as he's done with her, she runs in
[1:32:46] and she says, "There's a man that told
[1:32:48] me anything, everything I ever did is
[1:32:50] not this the very Messiah." And a bunch
[1:32:52] of the city comes out on the basis of
[1:32:55] her testimony. She's effective. But when
[1:32:58] they get there and they stay there for a
[1:33:00] couple days and they say, "We believe
[1:33:02] because of what you said, but now we
[1:33:04] believe because of what he said." And
[1:33:06] they receive the same message that she
[1:33:08] received. And those people not too long
[1:33:11] in the in the in the future would go
[1:33:13] back and receive the Holy Ghost
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; and they'd never ever be the same again.
[1:33:18] Amen.
[1:33:20] church. He came to preach to the broken,
[1:33:23] to the poor, to those that know I'm
[1:33:26] losing.
[1:33:29] And he came to make us not losers
[1:33:30] anymore. He came to bring victory into
[1:33:33] the camp. Amen. He came to turn beggars
[1:33:35] into witnesses or Christ. That's why
[1:33:37] we're here today, isn't it?
[1:33:40] I want the full treatment of the gospel
[1:33:43] this morning. I don't just want to say
[1:33:45] he saved my soul. I say, Lord, give me
[1:33:48] everything. Give me everything that you
[1:33:50] have. I want the full treatment because
[1:33:52] the full treatment includes a
[1:33:53] resurrection and a rapture. Amen. I
[1:33:55] don't want to have a church experience.
[1:33:57] I want to have a resurrection and
[1:33:59] rapturing experience. Amen. I want to
[1:34:00] have a life inside of me. I don't want
[1:34:02] to have to wait till the rapture to know
[1:34:03] he's alive. I don't want to have to wait
[1:34:05] till eternity to know he's a healer. I
[1:34:07] don't want to have to wait till he comes
[1:34:09] and shows his face to know that he's
[1:34:10] alive and well.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want the full treatment here
[1:34:13] today. Amen. I don't want us to sit back
[1:34:15] here and say, "Well, I'm not hurt. I'm
[1:34:17] not worthless.
[1:34:19] I'm not losing. I'm not cold and formal.
[1:34:24] I want us to say, Lord, you see my
[1:34:26] condition. You see my hurt. You see my
[1:34:29] pain. You see my sickness. You see my
[1:34:31] worry. You see my concern. You see my
[1:34:34] frustration.
[1:34:36] Lord, you see my coldness and formality.
[1:34:38] But God, I'm here for the full treatment
[1:34:40] this morning. Why? Because the spirit of
[1:34:43] the Lord is upon me to preach
[1:34:45] deliverance to the captives. blindness
[1:34:47] going away.
[1:34:52] When the Holy Ghost is in the building,
[1:34:56] I don't have to leave the way I came in.
[1:34:58] Amen. Church, I don't care if you take a
[1:35:02] big step or a small step today. Just
[1:35:04] take a step. Let him do a work in your
[1:35:07] life this morning. Amen. Lord, take one
[1:35:09] Lord, give me one step closer to
[1:35:11] victory, one step closer to home, one
[1:35:13] step closer to overcoming. Amen.
[1:35:15] Remember, we're in a redemption process.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; It's a process of time. And I don't care
[1:35:21] if it's from the pulpit to the back
[1:35:23] door. Every single one of us is in a
[1:35:25] process of being set free
[1:35:28] to do what? To serve him more
[1:35:30] completely, to express him more
[1:35:33] perfectly, to be used of him more
[1:35:35] easily. Amen. [snorts]
[1:35:40] You know, if you go through those
[1:35:42] automated car washes, they always have
[1:35:44] options, don't they? And they got the
[1:35:45] base, the base car wash, which is the
[1:35:47] base price, $9.99,
[1:35:50] but they've got the next one. And they,
[1:35:52] you know, the base wash is just you go
[1:35:54] in, they do a a quick rinse of your, you
[1:35:56] know, they they spray the car, they put
[1:35:57] soap on it, they quickly rinse it off,
[1:35:58] and then they air dry it. That's $9.99.
[1:36:01] Well, you can step up to the next level,
[1:36:03] you know, and with that one, maybe
[1:36:04] they'll throw on some liquid wax. But
[1:36:06] then you go to the the top, the premium,
[1:36:08] the luxury wash, and for only $5 more,
[1:36:11] they'll do an extra- long soap. They'll
[1:36:14] put a special uh soap on your wheels and
[1:36:16] tires to get all the brake dust off of
[1:36:18] them. They'll they'll put a a special
[1:36:20] polish. They'll they'll they'll make
[1:36:22] your car smell nice.
[1:36:25] And that's what they want you to do.
[1:36:28] They want you to go for the full
[1:36:29] treatment.
[1:36:32] Well, God wants you to go for the full
[1:36:33] treatment this morning. But the
[1:36:35] beautiful thing is that this treatment
[1:36:36] is without money and without price. He's
[1:36:39] paid the price. Now, you're going to
[1:36:41] have to lay some things down.
[1:36:43] You're going to have to lay some things
[1:36:45] down. First thing is to say, "I need
[1:36:46] it." Lay down your pride. Lay down your
[1:36:50] formality. Lay down this this stiff
[1:36:53] upper lift. Lay down this facade of
[1:36:55] being untouchable
[1:36:56] and say, "Lord, you know what's in my
[1:36:58] heart. You know what I need this
[1:37:00] morning." And then say, "Lord, I want
[1:37:02] the full treatment. Lord, let me have
[1:37:04] everything that you have to offer this
[1:37:07] morning." Church, I I know this is
[1:37:09] simple this morning, but the gospel has
[1:37:12] always been simple. The gospel is here
[1:37:15] to set us free to serve God. That's what
[1:37:18] it's always been about. To step into his
[1:37:21] word and let the word live through us.
[1:37:23] Everything Everything that God has for
[1:37:25] us is to draw us back into relationship
[1:37:27] with him. To draw us back into
[1:37:28] fellowship and bring us into a closer
[1:37:30] walk with him. And nothing can stop you
[1:37:33] when you're doing that. Nothing can stop
[1:37:35] you. [snorts] Listen to this. He says,
[1:37:37] "Jesus plainly explained it when he said
[1:37:39] to the woman that had been stooped over.
[1:37:41] He healed her. He laid her his hands
[1:37:43] upon her. She raised up and they began
[1:37:45] to find fault. The teachers did. He
[1:37:47] said, "Ought not this daughter of
[1:37:48] Abraham be loosed, set free from this
[1:37:50] bondage that she's been in of Satan." He
[1:37:52] says, "So Christ, our redeemer has come
[1:37:54] to do what? Set men and women free from
[1:37:58] sin and free from sickness."
[1:38:02] He says when he died at Calvary, he was
[1:38:04] wounded for our transgressions and with
[1:38:06] his stripes we were healed. He says now
[1:38:08] that's the good news. That's the gospel.
[1:38:10] The gospel is that Christ died and took
[1:38:13] the sinner's place. That Christ took the
[1:38:16] sick man's place. Christ took the
[1:38:18] sinner's place. Christ took the worried
[1:38:20] man's place.
[1:38:23] Christ took the maniac's place. You say,
[1:38:26] "I'm not a maniac." Some of us are
[1:38:27] running around like maniacs.
[1:38:31] He came to save us from running around
[1:38:32] like a chicken with his head cut off.
[1:38:35] I have had such a frustrating couple of
[1:38:37] weeks. And I'm saying, "Lord, help me to
[1:38:41] lay it at your feet."
[1:38:44] Not running around, not seeking this,
[1:38:46] not figuring this out, not trying to get
[1:38:48] that done. Just say, "Lord, it's in your
[1:38:50] hands."
[1:38:53] We need to slow down.
[1:38:55] [snorts]
[1:38:57] He said, "Christ took every place and
[1:39:00] freed us from every affliction and every
[1:39:02] sin that the devil put us in the prison
[1:39:05] house by." Christ came to pardon us
[1:39:09] freely. He said, "Everything goes free."
[1:39:15] Hallelujah. What a message this morning.
[1:39:17] Everything goes free. We read in Luke 4
[1:39:21] how Jesus said, "I'm here to proclaim.
[1:39:23] I'm here to announce the acceptable year
[1:39:25] of the Lord. And what was he announcing?
[1:39:26] He was announcing freedom. He was
[1:39:29] announcing liberty. Amen. That's the
[1:39:31] gospel. It's freedom. It's liberty. And
[1:39:33] remember in the Old Testament, as we're
[1:39:35] closing this morning, they had a liberty
[1:39:38] year. They had a freedom year. They had
[1:39:40] what they called the Jubilee year every
[1:39:42] 50 years. And at that particular year
[1:39:44] and a particular day, at a particular
[1:39:46] time, they would blow a trumpet. And
[1:39:48] that year was the year of Jubilee. And
[1:39:50] when that trumpet was blown, every
[1:39:52] Israelite that was in debt, that was in
[1:39:55] slavery, that was in bondage of any
[1:39:57] sort, could walk away completely free.
[1:40:01] All debts erased. Not only that, they
[1:40:04] didn't have to pay what they owed, but
[1:40:06] they could go back and take what was
[1:40:08] taken from them. They got to go back to
[1:40:10] their original family inheritance that
[1:40:13] they got under Joshua.
[1:40:16] They could get back what they lost and
[1:40:18] they didn't owe what they they didn't
[1:40:20] have to pay what they owed. What a year
[1:40:22] that must have been, church.
[1:40:25] Every 50 years, God gave them a grand
[1:40:27] reset.
[1:40:29] Sometimes we need to realize, I need a
[1:40:31] reset.
[1:40:32] God guaranteed every person if they
[1:40:34] lived a typical length of time would
[1:40:36] always have one opportunity at least to
[1:40:39] have a reset. That's the grace of God,
[1:40:42] even under law.
[1:40:44] But now Jesus comes out.
[1:40:47] He announces a different jubilee
[1:40:51] because remember we're under a new
[1:40:54] covenant now. The law has been
[1:40:56] fulfilled. You don't get one in 50. Now
[1:40:59] it's a constant jubilee. It's a constant
[1:41:02] freedom because the anointing in the
[1:41:04] word hasn't changed. So the purpose of
[1:41:07] the word is to set you free, to set you
[1:41:10] at liberty, to break those chains that
[1:41:11] are holding you. And he was announcing a
[1:41:13] jubilee. He was blowing a trumpet and
[1:41:15] saying, "If you want to go free, you can
[1:41:17] go free. If there's a desire to go free,
[1:41:20] you can go free. If you don't realize
[1:41:22] you're bound, nothing's going to happen.
[1:41:25] But if you know you're bound and you
[1:41:26] want to go free, you can have it." He
[1:41:28] was starting a great jubilee and he
[1:41:30] didn't finish it in three and a half
[1:41:31] years. What he did was he demonstrated
[1:41:33] what it could do.
[1:41:35] But that jubilee really didn't fully
[1:41:37] start until the day of Pentecost when he
[1:41:39] came back in the form of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:41] and he started to live through you and
[1:41:43] I. He started to live in human flesh all
[1:41:45] over again. And they came down and they
[1:41:47] were completely changed.
[1:41:50] They were no longer bound up in
[1:41:51] themselves. Peter was no longer worried
[1:41:54] about self-preservation.
[1:41:56] He wasn't worried about death. He wasn't
[1:41:58] worried about if people knew that he was
[1:41:59] a friend of Jesus. All he wanted to do
[1:42:02] was tell people about Jesus. Why? He was
[1:42:04] completely changed. Amen. But Jesus
[1:42:07] would say here, "It's starting and you
[1:42:09] can go free."
[1:42:12] You know, those disciples had an
[1:42:13] experience with God for three and a half
[1:42:15] years.
[1:42:17] And an experience with God didn't hold
[1:42:18] them.
[1:42:23] An experience with God is just God
[1:42:24] getting your attention.
[1:42:27] It's letting you know he's there. It's
[1:42:28] letting him know he cares about you. You
[1:42:30] know, I think about that woman at the
[1:42:32] well. Listen to this. When he told her
[1:42:36] her track record
[1:42:39] and she realized he knew this before he
[1:42:43] started the conversation
[1:42:46] and he's still talking to me.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; He knew who I was before he started
[1:42:53] talking to me and yet he's still talking
[1:42:55] to me.
[1:42:57] That's what a personal experience with
[1:42:59] Christ is like. He let you know, hey, I
[1:43:03] know your track record and I'm still
[1:43:05] talking to you. Hallelujah. Praise the
[1:43:08] Lord. I'm glad he talked to me. But that
[1:43:12] is just letting you know he's there.
[1:43:15] It's him trying to let you know who you
[1:43:17] are. But that experience will not hold
[1:43:20] you unless you come to a place where he
[1:43:22] goes from talking to you to living in
[1:43:24] you. It takes the Holy Ghost to anchor
[1:43:26] us. Amen. We want to become a vessel for
[1:43:30] God, not just say, "I met him." He's got
[1:43:33] to dwell inside of us. Amen. The
[1:43:35] disciples had a lot of wonderful
[1:43:36] ministries, a lot of wonderful things,
[1:43:38] but that didn't hold them. That
[1:43:40] experience didn't hold them. It took the
[1:43:42] inddwelling spirit. It took the true
[1:43:44] Pentecost where they went up under a
[1:43:46] promise and they stayed there and they
[1:43:49] prayed and they believed and they stuck
[1:43:51] it out until they got what he was
[1:43:53] talking about.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; That's it. Church, you say, "I'm lacking
[1:43:56] something." Stay there until you get it.
[1:44:00] Stay there until you get it. Brother Bam
[1:44:02] says, "If I don't get it, they're going
[1:44:03] to find a corpse out in the woods." He
[1:44:05] says, "Cuz I'm not moving till I get
[1:44:06] what I came for." Not what you want.
[1:44:10] What he promised, what he said, he's
[1:44:12] here to do. Amen. It changed those men
[1:44:15] from captives into true apostles, men on
[1:44:17] a mission for God. Listen to this. He
[1:44:19] says, "We can start a meeting, work
[1:44:21] signs and wonders." He says, "I notice
[1:44:23] it here. I go out and sometimes in the
[1:44:25] meeting blind see deaf hear the people
[1:44:27] come around look and say that's
[1:44:28] wonderful when the revival's gone you
[1:44:31] don't hear of them anymore
[1:44:33] they're right back out well yes I
[1:44:35] believe in that what is it they believe
[1:44:38] in the moving of God they believe in an
[1:44:40] experience with God but they don't
[1:44:41] actually have something that holds them
[1:44:44] he says what it needs tonight is not a
[1:44:46] new preacher what it needs is the Holy
[1:44:49] Spirit to get out amongst the people and
[1:44:51] go to stirring them up hungering and
[1:44:53] thirsting for righteousness sake. He
[1:44:56] said, "Blessed are they when they hunger
[1:44:57] and thirst for righteousness, for they
[1:44:59] shall be filled." He says, "Whatever it
[1:45:01] is, it takes the Holy Spirit to do it."
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take mom and dad giving you
[1:45:07] good advice.
[1:45:08] Doesn't take the preacher telling you
[1:45:10] over the pulpit what to do. It takes the
[1:45:12] Holy Spirit pulling something out that's
[1:45:14] in there in the first place. And that's
[1:45:16] what you're responding to. Amen. Amen.
[1:45:19] It's the inddwelling God that's going to
[1:45:20] make the difference here. It takes the
[1:45:23] spirit of God moving and then dwelling
[1:45:26] to produce what we're looking for.
[1:45:28] Otherwise, what do we do, church, do it
[1:45:31] on our own, and we fail on our own
[1:45:34] miserably. I speak from experience.
[1:45:36] Amen. It takes the inddwelling God to do
[1:45:39] it. Listen to what Jesus said. Again, I
[1:45:42] went with the Common English Bible
[1:45:43] because it it's just an easier thing for
[1:45:45] for many to hear. He says, "Therefore,
[1:45:48] if the Son makes you free, you really
[1:45:51] will be free."
[1:45:53] Church, you know when you've been set
[1:45:54] free.
[1:45:56] Hallelujah. You know when you've been
[1:45:57] set free. Listen, you don't know what
[1:46:00] desires I have inside of me, but I do.
[1:46:03] And I know what he's changed. And I know
[1:46:05] what used to be there. And I know what's
[1:46:06] there now.
[1:46:08] I know he has set me free. Amen. I
[1:46:12] believe we've got many testimonies of
[1:46:13] God setting us free this morning. But
[1:46:16] there are areas where we still need
[1:46:17] freedom.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Absolutely we do. And I'm
[1:46:20] here to tell you the good news. He can
[1:46:21] set you free this morning. Amen.
[1:46:25] [snorts]
[1:46:26] Listen. When he makes you free,
[1:46:29] not when I choose a new direction.
[1:46:32] We're coming into the new year, church.
[1:46:33] Don't choose a new direction.
[1:46:37] Not I'm going to make different
[1:46:38] decisions.
[1:46:40] Not I'm going to get more disciplined.
[1:46:42] You are what you are. You are what you
[1:46:45] are. Again, I speak from experience.
[1:46:47] Amen. Not a new you.
[1:46:51] You got to die. It has to be Christ in
[1:46:54] you, the hope of glory. A new birth.
[1:46:57] That'll do it. And if you got it, say,
[1:46:59] "Lord, clean out the rooms of my life.
[1:47:01] Open up the doors and let the light
[1:47:02] shine into the darkness." Amen. When he
[1:47:04] sets you free, you'll be free. How does
[1:47:06] he do it? By the Holy Spirit taking that
[1:47:09] engrafted word and making it live out of
[1:47:11] your life.
[1:47:14] You got to take the word in and the Holy
[1:47:16] Spirit will live it out inside of you.
[1:47:18] That's the only way. It's got to be an
[1:47:19] inside out. Amen, church. This isn't
[1:47:21] this isn't advice here. This is eternal
[1:47:23] life. This is eternal life. Let him do
[1:47:26] the work and it'll be a real work. And
[1:47:29] you won't have to. You can stop trying
[1:47:31] then and you can start trusting and you
[1:47:34] can start resting in those things.
[1:47:37] Listen now. He says, "Notice, every
[1:47:39] slave,
[1:47:41] every slave, when he heard that trumpet
[1:47:44] sound, he could,
[1:47:47] here's our choice. He could throw down
[1:47:49] his hoe or whatever he was working with
[1:47:51] and say, "I am a free man. I couldn't
[1:47:54] redeem myself, but God through his grace
[1:47:57] has declared a year of jubilee.
[1:47:59] Therefore, I believe God and I don't
[1:48:01] have to work anymore." He says, "And the
[1:48:04] laws of the land claimed him free." He
[1:48:06] says, "What a beautiful type of today."
[1:48:09] Hallelujah. Let's listen to it. He says,
[1:48:11] "We poor aliens. Nothing we could do."
[1:48:17] Nothing we can do
[1:48:19] if we kept every Sabbath,
[1:48:22] every new moon, quit eating meat, if we
[1:48:25] kept all kinds of days, and did all
[1:48:27] kinds of religious sacrifice. He says,
[1:48:30] "We are under a load."
[1:48:34] Parents, let me talk to you this
[1:48:35] morning. Don't put a load on your
[1:48:38] children that they can't carry. Don't
[1:48:41] ask them to be a Christian without
[1:48:44] Christ because that is a load that puts
[1:48:47] pressure. It puts worry. It puts guilt.
[1:48:52] Preach freedom.
[1:48:55] We want our children to obey. We're here
[1:48:56] to help them. Protect them from
[1:48:58] themselves. But don't try and make them
[1:49:00] a Christian until they get the Holy
[1:49:02] Ghost.
[1:49:03] Teach them, show them, live a life
[1:49:07] before them of what it looks like, but
[1:49:09] do not force them to be what they are
[1:49:11] not yet.
[1:49:13] Otherwise, you put a load on them, that
[1:49:16] they are not fit to carry.
[1:49:19] He says, "We are sold in sin. Our
[1:49:21] parents sold us out to sin in the Garden
[1:49:23] of Eden, and we are laden under the
[1:49:25] bonds of sin as a slave to the devil."
[1:49:27] He says, "We're born in sin, shaped in
[1:49:28] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[1:49:30] lies. There is nothing we can do to help
[1:49:33] us because our
[1:49:36] whole makeup, our whole nature and
[1:49:41] everything we are is sin.
[1:49:46] Amen. Hopeless, broken, crushed people,
[1:49:52] beggarly. We can't help ourselves
[1:49:53] because we don't have anything good to
[1:49:55] start with. It's all broken. He says,
[1:49:57] "But when the jubilee comes that we are
[1:49:59] free," he says, "the trumpet's the
[1:50:01] gospel, the good news." The trumpet was
[1:50:02] the gospel, then the good news. You're
[1:50:04] no longer bound. You no longer have to
[1:50:06] live in sin. You can go home and be
[1:50:08] free. You don't owe any debts at all.
[1:50:10] The whole emancipation of proclamation
[1:50:12] is signed and you are free. Notice he
[1:50:15] says, "No longer have to."
[1:50:19] Satan tries to make an absolute here.
[1:50:22] You have to, you know, you're weak. You
[1:50:25] know you're lost. You know you can't do
[1:50:27] it. You know you've tried. You don't
[1:50:30] have to. He says, "Why?" Because there's
[1:50:31] an absolute beyond Satan and it's the
[1:50:34] word and it says you can go free. You
[1:50:36] can go free.
[1:50:38] He says
[1:50:43] the whole emancipation proclamation
[1:50:45] proclamation emancipation is signed and
[1:50:47] you are free. He says and today when a
[1:50:50] man hears the good news, Christ died in
[1:50:53] yourstead. Nothing that you can do about
[1:50:54] it. Christ paid the price. He said, "The
[1:50:56] gospel sounds." You can drop every
[1:50:59] cigarette, every true tobacco, every
[1:51:01] whiskey bottle. And most of us are
[1:51:02] saying, "Well, okay, who cares? I don't
[1:51:05] do that anymore." Listen to this.
[1:51:07] Everything that's binding you and say,
[1:51:12] "I am free. This is the good news.
[1:51:14] Christ has made me free." He says,
[1:51:16] "You're a free people. You don't have to
[1:51:18] go any longer. You don't have to serve
[1:51:19] the devil any longer. You can be free if
[1:51:22] you desire to be free. Not mommy and
[1:51:25] daddy forcing you. Not the preacher
[1:51:27] forcing you, but there's a desire in
[1:51:29] your heart to say, "I want to be free."
[1:51:30] He says, "That's the one that can be
[1:51:31] free this morning." Amen.
[1:51:34] He says, "You don't have to drink.
[1:51:37] You don't have to run around. You don't
[1:51:40] have to mistreat your wife. You don't
[1:51:41] have to curse. You don't have to lie.
[1:51:42] You don't have to steal." Again,
[1:51:44] probably not really something this
[1:51:45] church needs. Catch this one. You don't
[1:51:48] have to be weary.
[1:51:52] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Anybody
[1:51:54] else feeling weary? I don't have to be
[1:51:56] weary this morning.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be weary. You don't
[1:51:59] have to be weary of planting and not
[1:52:02] seeing the harvest yet. Of giving and so
[1:52:07] rarely getting. Of working and not
[1:52:11] getting to play.
[1:52:13] Of serving
[1:52:15] rarely being served.
[1:52:18] of taking the slap on the cheek and
[1:52:20] never getting the satisfaction of coming
[1:52:22] right back with another one.
[1:52:26] You don't have to be weary. He says,
[1:52:28] "Why? You have the resources up yonder
[1:52:30] that's never been tapped of the
[1:52:32] bountiful blessings of God that the
[1:52:34] world knows nothing about." Now, catch
[1:52:36] this as we're closing. One more page. He
[1:52:39] says, "You say, I must have a little
[1:52:42] pleasure.
[1:52:44] A bag of chips and a pop.
[1:52:49] I must have a little guilty pleasure is
[1:52:51] what we usually call those things. I'm
[1:52:54] going to be a Christian, but I got to
[1:52:55] have a little taste of something I
[1:52:58] really shouldn't be tasting.
[1:53:02] We're closing. Are you with me? He says,
[1:53:06] "Why, brother, if you ever hear the good
[1:53:08] news of the trumpet, the worldly
[1:53:10] pleasure seems so little, you don't need
[1:53:12] it anymore. So much greater is this news
[1:53:15] than the old boundaries of slavery, the
[1:53:17] old marks of sin that caused you to be
[1:53:19] badeyed wretches by smoking cigarettes,
[1:53:22] alcoholics on the street trembling. He
[1:53:24] says, "You don't have to go that way.
[1:53:25] The gospel trumpet is sounding.
[1:53:28] Whosoever will, let him come and drink
[1:53:31] from the fountain of the waters of
[1:53:33] life." Hallelujah. You know, it reminds
[1:53:36] me of that testimony I shared of Selena
[1:53:38] talking to that lady at the at the
[1:53:40] stables that was saying, "Well, do you
[1:53:41] believe in alternate lifestyles and
[1:53:43] these different things?" And our answer
[1:53:44] is, "Listen, what we believe in is the
[1:53:46] is the the life-changing power of Jesus
[1:53:49] Christ.
[1:53:51] You come any way you are,
[1:53:54] but he won't let you stay that way. You
[1:53:57] won't want to stay that way if there's a
[1:54:00] child of God buried inside that soul."
[1:54:02] Amen.
[1:54:03] Let me close. I've got three short
[1:54:05] quotes here. I want us to be encouraged
[1:54:07] on this good news as we head into the
[1:54:09] holidays. He says, "For the gospel is
[1:54:12] delivered. It's good news." And this
[1:54:14] morning, the Holy Spirit through the
[1:54:16] word is bringing you the good news.
[1:54:18] Here's your good news. That from the
[1:54:20] foundation of the world, God wrote your
[1:54:24] name in the Lamb's book of life.
[1:54:29] All the devils out of hell can't erase
[1:54:33] it out of there.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:38] He says God's word has spoken it just as
[1:54:42] sure to happen as God's wrote it in
[1:54:45] there before the foundation of the
[1:54:46] world. He says how glorious our heavenly
[1:54:49] father is in his infinite love and his
[1:54:51] mercy to do that for us. Now catch this.
[1:54:56] Now he said, "Be ye therefore perfect,
[1:55:00] even as your heavenly father is
[1:55:02] perfect." How can you be? He says, "When
[1:55:06] it's not my perfection, it's not your
[1:55:08] perfection. It's his perfection."
[1:55:13] What is his perfection? Of his word.
[1:55:18] Remember, God is perfect. His word is
[1:55:20] perfect. It is not a lie.
[1:55:24] of his word that he chose you and you
[1:55:30] never chose him. Hallelujah. Can we say
[1:55:34] praise the Lord this morning that his
[1:55:37] perfect word chose you and you didn't
[1:55:41] choose him. That means I can't unchoose
[1:55:45] him.
[1:55:47] I can't erase my name by my works. I'm
[1:55:51] not giving you an excuse to sin. I'm
[1:55:53] saying he's already chosen
[1:55:56] those who he had called, he justified,
[1:56:00] he sanctified. He has already perfected.
[1:56:05] He says he brought you into Christ and
[1:56:08] you are secured with Jesus Christ and
[1:56:12] just as perfect as Christ was before
[1:56:15] God. No, he says, "For you're not
[1:56:18] standing with your own. You're standing
[1:56:20] in him with one thing. Here's your part,
[1:56:24] church. I believe God.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "On the other side
[1:56:31] of Eden, what a wonderful time it'll be
[1:56:34] someday when you look back and say, why
[1:56:37] did I fear? Look at the joy I missed."
[1:56:45] Young man, young woman this morning or
[1:56:48] you old man or woman who has never been
[1:56:50] a Christian, God has continually knocked
[1:56:52] at your heart. He says, "Oh yes, you
[1:56:54] might come in at the end of the road,
[1:56:56] but you'll have no joy.
[1:56:59] [snorts]
[1:57:00] The thief on the cross had no joy.
[1:57:04] He never got to experience what he could
[1:57:06] have experienced so much earlier."
[1:57:09] He says, "You'll have no joy. There'll
[1:57:12] be no stars around you to shine. You're
[1:57:15] not bringing anyone with you. You did no
[1:57:18] work." That's true unmmerited favor.
[1:57:20] That's grace. He says, "But you missed
[1:57:22] out on an opportunity. We're going to
[1:57:25] preach on an opportunity in the new
[1:57:27] year." He says, "I don't want to stand
[1:57:29] like that. I want to hear him say, it
[1:57:32] was well done, my good and faithful
[1:57:34] servant. I want to show him my
[1:57:37] appreciation.
[1:57:39] Amen. Let's stand together if we would.
[1:57:42] He says,"I want to show him my
[1:57:44] appreciation."
[1:57:45] That's our response, not works.
[1:57:50] Appreciation.
[1:57:52] Lord, thank you. Lord, I love you. Lord,
[1:57:56] I worship you for what you did before I
[1:58:00] could ever choose you. Before I could
[1:58:02] ever make a a right step or a wrong
[1:58:04] step. Before I could go one way or go a
[1:58:06] different way, before I could get caught
[1:58:08] up in myself, you chose me before I
[1:58:10] chose you, church. He came to save us
[1:58:13] from our sins, not our situations.
[1:58:16] Amen. He came to restore us to
[1:58:17] fellowship, not financial freedom.
[1:58:22] Amen. He came to redeem us, to restore
[1:58:24] us back to the condition we had in his
[1:58:27] mind like Adam and Eve did in the Garden
[1:58:30] of Eden. Amen. He's [snorts] the savior
[1:58:33] of our soul. first and foremost. And
[1:58:34] that's what he's here for this morning.
[1:58:36] If he can get control of the soul, and
[1:58:38] we're going to get into this as we come
[1:58:39] back to our series on a position of
[1:58:41] dominion, when that soul has been set
[1:58:44] back to its original condition, and
[1:58:46] Christ is living out, it brings the
[1:58:48] spirit and flesh into total subjection
[1:58:53] to the place where he can resurrect and
[1:58:55] rapture us.
[1:58:57] Everything flows from the inside out.
[1:58:59] And we're saying, "Lord, change the
[1:59:00] outside in." He says, "That's not the
[1:59:01] way I work. When I get the preeminence,
[1:59:05] then I'll show the preeminence. And
[1:59:07] that's when you'll get the benefit.
[1:59:08] Amen. I was speaking with someone
[1:59:10] recently, and they're saying, "It seems
[1:59:12] more and more lately
[1:59:14] that God keeps reminding me that
[1:59:16] everything we touch is temporary.
[1:59:20] It comes, it goes." You know, my wife
[1:59:22] and I were reminiscing the other night
[1:59:23] and we were talking about all the things
[1:59:25] we've gone through and the places we've
[1:59:26] been. And we've lived in tiny little
[1:59:29] apartments and having, you know, no
[1:59:31] money left at the end of the month. And
[1:59:32] we've lived in nicer homes and we've
[1:59:34] rented and we've been here and busy
[1:59:36] places and smelly places and houses that
[1:59:39] were just mostly holes and not much
[1:59:41] else. We've had good jobs. We've had bad
[1:59:44] jobs. We've had appreciative churches
[1:59:45] and not so appreciative. We've been
[1:59:47] everywhere, done everything, been in
[1:59:49] every condition, financially,
[1:59:51] spiritually,
[1:59:52] career-wise,
[1:59:55] marily, everything. We've been through
[1:59:57] all of the struggles that you can
[1:59:59] probably imagine.
[2:00:02] And you know what? Through it all,
[2:00:07] when we had him, when we were focused on
[2:00:09] him, we were content. We were happy. I
[2:00:13] was as happy having $200 at the end of
[2:00:15] the month as I was with 2,000 at the end
[2:00:17] of the month.
[2:00:19] Cuz why? If you're in his will and
[2:00:22] you're walking with him,
[2:00:24] everything else tends to fade away.
[2:00:27] Doesn't mean you don't wouldn't
[2:00:29] appreciate more. And I appreciate more.
[2:00:31] I'd rather have more money than less
[2:00:33] money. I think most of us would. But
[2:00:35] I'll tell you this,
[2:00:37] it didn't change who I was when I had
[2:00:40] less. when I didn't own a house, living
[2:00:43] in a little apartment, dealing with
[2:00:45] noise above and around us.
[2:00:48] Old cars. I remember I had an old Honda
[2:00:49] Accord. We paid $2,800 for it. Had, you
[2:00:52] know, 250,000 km on it. Had the paint
[2:00:54] all fading on it. The clear coat was
[2:00:56] gone. It didn't matter. Church, much.
[2:01:01] Amen. When we've got him, that's our
[2:01:03] satisfaction.
[2:01:04] So many people are chasing everything
[2:01:07] except the one thing that'll satisfy
[2:01:08] them. Amen. Prophet God would say
[2:01:11] there's a little place inside of you
[2:01:12] that only he can satisfy. And when
[2:01:14] that's satisfied, everything else,
[2:01:17] that's where your satisfaction comes
[2:01:18] from. Amen. [snorts] My prayer this
[2:01:20] morning is, Lord, keep setting me free.
[2:01:22] Amen. Keep opening those doors. Keep
[2:01:25] raising those bars. Help me see where
[2:01:28] I'm not so strong. Help me to see where
[2:01:30] I'm bound up. And then, Lord, give me
[2:01:32] the full treatment.
[2:01:34] Give me the full gospel wash. Paul said,
[2:01:37] "By the washing of water, by the word."
[2:01:38] That's how he does these things. Lord,
[2:01:40] let your word have full control. Amen.
[2:01:43] That's the good news. If you want it,
[2:01:45] he'll do it. Let's bow our heads.
[2:01:48] Heavenly Father,
[2:01:51] Lord, it's a pleasure and it's a joy to
[2:01:52] preach good news.
[2:01:54] Lord, it's a pleasure and a joy to know
[2:01:57] that you are a God that cannot and will
[2:01:59] not lie. Lord, there's no darkness in
[2:02:02] you. There's no shadow. Lord, there's no
[2:02:04] variableness. You don't whiffle waffle.
[2:02:06] Lord, what you say is right and it is
[2:02:09] true from the beginning. And Lord, you
[2:02:12] came down in flesh and you said, "I'm
[2:02:15] here to set you free."
[2:02:18] Lord, we need freedom this morning. We
[2:02:21] need liberty this morning. We need
[2:02:23] liberty to worship. We need liberty to
[2:02:25] live. Lord, we need liberty to trust, to
[2:02:28] rest. Lord, we need liberty to be
[2:02:30] anchored.
[2:02:32] Lord, we need liberty for healing,
[2:02:35] for direction.
[2:02:38] Lord, we need our souls to be healed.
[2:02:41] And Lord, we're coming to you this
[2:02:43] morning by your word, Lord, by the
[2:02:45] promise, Lord, that you would do it if
[2:02:49] we would receive it. So, Lord, you know
[2:02:51] each heart and soul here. Lord, you know
[2:02:54] where we're at. You know the broken
[2:02:55] records that are playing in our lives,
[2:02:57] heavenly father. Lord, you know our
[2:02:59] track records. You [snorts] know our ins
[2:03:02] and outs and ups and downs, Lord. You
[2:03:04] know our faults and failings. But Lord,
[2:03:06] we're here to confess this morning,
[2:03:07] Lord, that we want to be free. Lord, I
[2:03:10] pray you'd minister, Lord, that you
[2:03:12] would speak to our hearts and souls,
[2:03:13] Lord, as we worship you this little bit,
[2:03:16] Lord. Touch your people. We ask in Jesus
[2:03:19] Christ's name we pray it. Amen. And
[2:03:22] amen. We're going to sing that song.
