[42:03] through the 25th uh brother Jonathan
[42:05] Martin remember brother Bram says
[42:07] there's some preachers that preach like
[42:08] a house on fire and then there's the
[42:10] rest of us brother Jonathan Martin is
[42:12] one of those ones that preaches like a
[42:13] house on fire so a younger brother than
[42:15] I am and uh I first met him back in 2009
[42:18] in Texas when we lost our pastor and he
[42:21] came down with his wife and three kids
[42:22] and stayed with us and just uh preached
[42:25] an amazing weekend there and so I
[42:27] reached out to him last night and he
[42:28] came back this morning said he'd be
[42:29] honored to come up and preach for us so
[42:31] uh very much looking forward to that we
[42:33] have brother Barry coffee of course
[42:34] coming on the 29th of this month as well
[42:37] so just remember that we'll of course
[42:39] have our usual number of fellowships and
[42:41] and get togethers throughout those
[42:43] weekends um and uh I'm trusting we'll
[42:46] enjoy it it's been a long time since
[42:47] we've had special meetings it was a camp
[42:49] of last year I think where we had
[42:51] dedicated weekend of special meetings so
[42:53] uh I think we're we're well overdue it's
[42:55] been a busy time I I know at times but
[42:58] uh I think we're overdue to just have a
[43:00] weekend where we just dedicate it to the
[43:01] Lord and just come in and enjoy his
[43:03] presence amen so God bless you let's
[43:05] turn to John chapter
[43:07] 14 and verse 18 this is Jesus speaking
[43:10] he says I will not leave you comfortless
[43:13] I will come to you yet a little while
[43:15] and the world seeth me no more but ye
[43:17] see me and because I live you shall live
[43:22] also amen God bless you you can have
[43:24] your seats this morning I want to come
[43:27] back to this thought that we had been
[43:28] taking two services on on the
[43:30] condescending God and last time we
[43:32] preached on this thought we showed how
[43:34] that when God came down when he
[43:35] condescended he showed what was possible
[43:38] for the believer or what was expected in
[43:40] the life of the believer and so when he
[43:42] came down first to Moses in that Pillar
[43:44] of Fire in that burning bush he showed
[43:46] that the most that the believer could
[43:48] achieve was works by obedience that was
[43:50] all he could give him he gave him a law
[43:52] and he said you need to live by this and
[43:54] the thing is you think well law uh works
[43:56] by obedience doesn't sound like very
[43:57] much but even that we couldn't do even
[44:00] that we couldn't do with it clearly
[44:01] written down and God set a a requirement
[44:04] before us nobody could do that nobody
[44:05] could do what the law required and So
[44:08] within the requirement God made a way to
[44:10] cover for when we couldn't meet it amen
[44:13] he gave us a requirement and then he met
[44:15] the requirement under blood amen he
[44:17] provided way for us because he knew we
[44:19] couldn't do it you know that ought to
[44:21] give us some encouragement this morning
[44:22] God knows we can't do it and so he makes
[44:25] a way for us to do it when we can't do
[44:27] it this morning amen but you notice now
[44:29] that God was in the pillar of fire he
[44:32] dwelt in a holy of holies he was there
[44:34] he was only available to one person one
[44:36] day a year as we we've talked about and
[44:38] so that was God revealing himself as the
[44:40] father above us and he was unobtainable
[44:42] and he was holy and he was righteous and
[44:45] nobody could come into His presence he
[44:46] could come to ours we couldn't come into
[44:49] His but that wasn't what God wanted it
[44:51] was a revealing of God and that Holiness
[44:53] and righteousness and even that that
[44:55] Holy judgment and those things amen but
[44:57] God didn't want to be separated from us
[44:59] that way if you go listen to that
[45:01] message Christ is the mystery of God
[45:03] revealed God was trying to reveal
[45:05] himself in different ways with purpose
[45:08] and so he comes down and he condescended
[45:10] into flesh in a man called Jesus of
[45:12] Nazareth and we know that body was born
[45:15] perfect it was born sinless it came
[45:17] through Mary but there wasn't any DNA of
[45:19] Mary inside of Jesus he was Godly DNA he
[45:22] was like a he was just like Adam he was
[45:24] word born there was nothing of Humanity
[45:27] in him in the in the sinful uh elements
[45:30] amen he was a perfect being that was
[45:32] born he was a Son of God just like Adam
[45:34] was and in that perfect being he lived a
[45:37] perfect life and remember we preached
[45:39] this brother br's very clear about it he
[45:41] was not deity in flesh for the first 30
[45:44] years he was a Son of God just like Adam
[45:47] was the spirit of God was not in him he
[45:49] had the nature of God by his birth but
[45:51] he did not have the person of God inside
[45:53] of him but by his own free will he went
[45:56] through life he faced trials he TR faced
[45:59] tests he faced hard times he faced
[46:01] rejection and through it all he was
[46:02] sinless for those first 30 years he was
[46:05] sinless perfection without anything
[46:07] except his Free Will that's what got him
[46:10] to do it but then he comes down amen he
[46:12] was in the image of God but he was not
[46:14] filled with the fullness of God Amen and
[46:17] then at the River Jordan God came down
[46:19] and he said this is my beloved Son in
[46:21] whom I'm pleased to dwell and the spirit
[46:23] of God came down on in inside of Jesus
[46:26] and that's where God God and man became
[46:27] one the first time that's where there
[46:30] was a union of Heaven and Earth and it
[46:32] was God condescending in flesh to be
[46:35] with us amen it was God being able to
[46:38] stand beside now it's God revealing
[46:40] himself as the son and if you look at
[46:42] the son his nature is still the same as
[46:45] the father and that he's still holy he's
[46:47] still righteous Jesus still came and he
[46:49] declared judgment he didn't come to
[46:51] declare judgment but absolutely you see
[46:53] he judged the Pharisees and he judged
[46:55] those that that were Hypocrites and
[46:56] those different things but he's no
[46:58] longer the distant father but now he's
[47:00] the present son and he now we've got we
[47:03] call today a touch point that you can go
[47:05] up now it's not just this this person
[47:07] off in The Ether but now it's a God that
[47:09] we can touch and feel and hear and have
[47:12] a conversation
[47:14] with it's a reality to us in a way that
[47:16] he wasn't before it's not a second
[47:19] person of the Trinity it's God now
[47:21] stepping into another form to reveal
[47:24] more of himself amen it's God coming
[47:27] down condescending to show us a greater
[47:30] portion of himself that's what's
[47:32] happening inside of Christ it's God
[47:34] opening up the mystery of himself there
[47:36] was a revealing in the Old Testament and
[47:38] it was that Holiness and righteousness
[47:40] part but now he comes down you know I
[47:44] kind of wrote it in my notes here that
[47:45] God is more of and a father is more of a
[47:48] judge than a buddy many times at least
[47:50] in my
[47:51] house asked my kids but see what is Dad
[47:55] Dad is strong
[47:57] dad is Authority dad is disciplined
[48:00] dad's an
[48:01] enforcer so yes he guards against the
[48:03] outside but he also prepares what's
[48:05] inside the home and so he's the one that
[48:08] keeps the kids in line in a greater way
[48:10] than Mama usually
[48:11] usually and so we know that Dad is going
[48:14] to protect us and he's going to use his
[48:16] strength for us but there are times
[48:17] where he has to use his strength on us
[48:20] to keep us in line and to make us what
[48:22] we need to be and so as the father all
[48:26] they could see was this holy judgment
[48:28] really cuz the law only brought
[48:30] condemnation it didn't bring anything
[48:31] else but now Christ comes down and he
[48:33] says I didn't come for the righteous I
[48:36] come for the Sinners and I come to draw
[48:38] them back to God even if they don't
[48:40] think they can I come down to do
[48:42] something in their lives that they don't
[48:44] realize they need to have inside of
[48:46] their lives amen but now we comes down
[48:48] in a body of Christ and now we have
[48:51] access that we didn't have before can
[48:54] you imagine being able to go up and have
[48:56] a conversation with god next to the
[49:00] campfire to be able to go into the
[49:02] temple and God Has Come descended in
[49:05] flesh and now it's God preaching
[49:08] literally it's God preaching to sit
[49:11] there and say I have met with God I
[49:14] walked with God you know John laying
[49:17] down and leaning his head on jesus'
[49:18] chest I lay my head on the chest of God
[49:22] he laid his hands on me he gave me
[49:25] direction he told me what was going on
[49:27] in my life it was God himself that was
[49:30] doing this work hidden in a body of
[49:31] flesh called Jesus Christ and what was
[49:34] it it was God now revealing another
[49:36] element of himself revealing another
[49:39] attribute of himself another part of his
[49:41] Redemption plan to us amen you know I
[49:44] love reading through the gospels and
[49:46] I've said before in my devotions I do uh
[49:49] uh Psalms or Proverbs I do a portion in
[49:51] the Old Testament then I do a portion in
[49:53] in the gospels and then I do the rest of
[49:55] the books of the newest Testament but I
[49:58] love reading in the gospels because what
[50:00] you see there is exactly how God would
[50:03] do things there's no questions because
[50:06] when he's living through Christ you see
[50:08] how he talks you see how he walks you
[50:10] see what he does you see how he acts you
[50:13] see how he reacts you see how he's quiet
[50:16] you see how he lets people tie
[50:17] themselves in knots without saying a
[50:19] word you see him turn the other cheek
[50:22] you see him heal you see him re uh
[50:26] respond to Faith and you see unable to
[50:29] respond to fa to unbelief all these
[50:31] things we can see a perfect life because
[50:33] that's what Christ lived was he lived a
[50:35] perfect life it was the fullness of God
[50:37] in a body showing us how to live and so
[50:41] just as how God showed in Moses time
[50:43] that the works of a of a Believer were
[50:45] all that they could have now God
[50:47] condescending again shows us that we can
[50:49] have Perfection by surrender that's what
[50:52] Christ showed Perfection by surrender uh
[50:55] brother Grant you preached so many times
[50:57] in the last few bit and it's just fed
[50:58] right into these thoughts that that have
[51:00] been sitting here it's beautiful
[51:01] Perfection by surrender Christ
[51:03] perfection in the end was not just that
[51:06] he was sinless it was that he did the
[51:09] will of God that's what we're looking
[51:11] for is not just sinless perfection we
[51:13] have that under the blood but we're
[51:15] looking for a living Perfection which is
[51:17] to do only that which the father wants
[51:19] us to do amen that's what's happening
[51:22] here so Christ was the Apex the Pinnacle
[51:25] the peak of of perfection in a human
[51:28] body it was God United with man
[51:31] completely perfectly with no filters no
[51:33] hindrances of any way and that was a
[51:36] special opportunity those people had in
[51:38] that day and and you know I think we got
[51:40] a taste of it in this age between with
[51:42] the message of Malachi 4 but I think
[51:44] that they got that special opportunity
[51:46] because they needed that for what they
[51:48] were about to go into they got an
[51:50] opportunity to see what God could do in
[51:52] a body of Flesh because he was going to
[51:54] do it in them and they had to see what
[51:56] was possible they had to have that touch
[51:58] point of a living reality of God so that
[52:02] when their time came they could step
[52:04] into it no matter what was pushing
[52:05] against them no matter what was trying
[52:07] to hold them back no matter how hard the
[52:08] circumstances were they had to see it
[52:11] demonstrated before
[52:13] them and it looked like everything was
[52:15] going so
[52:16] good and then Christ goes to Calvary and
[52:20] God moves out of that body of
[52:23] Flesh that body of Flesh gets put away
[52:26] it gets put away man God stopped
[52:28] revealing himself as the son and we lost
[52:31] that touch point and since that point we
[52:33] haven't had that same availability in
[52:35] the same way very close very close but
[52:39] not exactly the same thing not that
[52:43] constancy right prophets they've got to
[52:45] wait for thus sayeth the Lord Jesus was
[52:48] thus sayeth the Lord there's a
[52:50] difference there right so you can have a
[52:52] prophet in your midst and it's very
[52:54] close but it's not the same
[52:57] and so they lost that touch Point amen
[52:59] and so those disciples could go and talk
[53:01] to him and see him and that woman at the
[53:03] well could come and he could go into her
[53:05] life but there was a reality there that
[53:07] got lost when that body of Jesus went
[53:09] away amen and we lost that touch point
[53:12] that ability to just go and get
[53:14] encouragement to have a perfect word
[53:16] given to us every time to be corrected
[53:19] in the way and it seemed like there's a
[53:21] disadvantage in US losing that and I
[53:23] think there is a disadvantage but I want
[53:25] us to realize what happen happened at
[53:27] Calvary before we move on into what
[53:29] happened after Calvary brother Brown
[53:31] would say this he says in the Old
[53:32] Testament we had laws and bylaws and
[53:35] things that people had to do by The
[53:37] Works of the law to be saved he says but
[53:39] God wound everything in the Old
[53:41] Testament right up and put it in Calvary
[53:44] that the believer now only has one thing
[53:47] to do look to Calvary and be born again
[53:51] that's it I can do that by God's grace I
[53:55] can do that
[53:57] he says that's all it is it's just so
[53:59] simple the laws and all the ceremonies
[54:01] and everything passed away with the
[54:02] shedding of the blood now catch this he
[54:05] says when my shadow was coming to me
[54:08] when my shadow and I meet my shadow is
[54:11] no more but I took the place of my
[54:15] shadow so catch that see as the light's
[54:17] coming closer and as you're moving
[54:19] closer that shadow starts to come come
[54:21] come and it gets shorter and shorter
[54:23] until as you come into Perfect Light
[54:25] directly above you the shadow disappears
[54:28] and all that's left is the
[54:31] object he's saying you when Jesus came
[54:34] remember they were worshiping the shadow
[54:37] they were worshiping the law and they
[54:38] turned the shadow of the law into a
[54:40] bondage and he says you don't realize
[54:43] I'm coming that the shadow can go away
[54:45] so that the object that you've been
[54:47] looking for can come into your
[54:49] life too many people are worshiping
[54:52] Shadows
[54:53] today rather than the object that's come
[54:56] the thing that's reflecting it he says
[54:59] and that's the way the law was the Old
[55:00] Testament was a shadow of the New
[55:02] Testament and was fulfilled Grace and
[55:05] law met at Calvary and law was fulfilled
[55:09] and Grace came into existence so we
[55:12] moved out from dead Works under the law
[55:14] they were dead not because they weren't
[55:16] what the law said but because they
[55:17] couldn't do everything the law said and
[55:19] so all that came out of it was death it
[55:21] was judgment it was condemnation
[55:23] couldn't redeem us couldn't make us
[55:24] perfect and now Christ comes in and at
[55:27] Calvary he ushers in the age of Grace
[55:29] the Covenant of Grace the law was
[55:31] swallowed up in Grace doesn't mean we
[55:33] don't have to do what God
[55:34] wants but it means that he judges us
[55:37] differently now amen I like how brother
[55:40] Garfield talked about it last service
[55:41] when he was talking about when God came
[55:43] down with the abrahamic Covenant and
[55:45] that's what we are remember we're not
[55:46] children of Moses we're children of
[55:48] Abraham there's a reason for that
[55:51] because Moses is law Abraham is Grace
[55:53] remember and God came down to Abraham
[55:55] and he says I'm going to confirm my
[55:57] Covenant to you and so he tells he tells
[56:00] Abraham he says do this stuff and
[56:02] separate the the the sacrifices and do
[56:05] this and that and Abraham's all ready
[56:06] and he does lays it all out and then God
[56:09] comes down and what does he do to
[56:10] Abraham he puts him to sleep he takes
[56:14] him completely out of the picture God
[56:16] comes down confirms the Covenant to
[56:19] himself by himself then he wakes Abraham
[56:23] up and he says Abraham it's done so
[56:25] Abraham is now the benefit or of the
[56:29] Covenant having done nothing he's been
[56:31] out cold the whole time he wakes up and
[56:34] it's
[56:35] finished that's where we stand today
[56:38] Abraham does that mean Abraham didn't
[56:39] have Works to do Abraham had works but
[56:42] the Covenant was fulfilled through
[56:43] Christ not through
[56:45] Abraham that's what he was doing for him
[56:47] amen he made Abraham the perfect
[56:49] recipient and he had nothing to do with
[56:51] it by
[56:52] works but he did works because he
[56:55] believed the Covenant
[56:57] it's Faith now rather than just works
[57:00] remember what Paul would say in
[57:01] Ephesians he says for by grace are ye
[57:04] saved through faith and that not of
[57:06] yourselves it is the gift of God it's
[57:08] the grace of God it's the faith of God
[57:10] it's a complete and total work of God
[57:13] brother Braham says it this way he says
[57:14] that's the way men are trying to do
[57:16] today is to Merit their salvation and
[57:19] there's not one thing you can do about
[57:21] it it's all Amazing Grace nothing you
[57:24] can do it's not by works but by grace
[57:27] are you saved that UNM merited Grace God
[57:30] through the righteousness of the Lord
[57:31] Jesus Christ has saved you and called
[57:34] you by his own Grace so remember we said
[57:37] before that God works in phases he's
[57:40] starting to work he's in the middle of a
[57:42] work and then he's finishing a work and
[57:45] we see here at Calvary what happened was
[57:46] he finished the work of the law he
[57:49] fulfilled the law and now there's a
[57:51] shifting phase into the into Grace God
[57:54] came down in Moses day and did a law
[57:56] phase then he comes down in Christ and
[57:58] he fulfills the law phase and he starts
[58:00] the gra Grace phase at the same time at
[58:03] Calvary at Calvary Christ fulfilled the
[58:06] law and started Grace and in that moment
[58:09] remember when God starts something he he
[58:11] has to finish it God never starts
[58:13] without finishing he started the law he
[58:15] fulfilled the law now he starts a work
[58:17] of Grace and that means the work of
[58:19] Grace has to be finished before the
[58:21] grace phase is over you know how I know
[58:24] the bride goes before tribulation
[58:26] because tribulation can't happen under
[58:28] grace so the bride has to go out before
[58:31] judgment because she's under a Grace
[58:33] Covenant amen if you look at the big
[58:35] picture of those things remember God was
[58:37] in Christ working in him to bring us
[58:40] back to him that's the great mystery
[58:42] unfolding before our very eyes is God
[58:45] trying to redeem us back to
[58:48] himself amen remember what Paul would
[58:50] say in Corinthians he says to ITT that
[58:52] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[58:55] unto him s that word reconcil means to
[58:57] restore us back to favor that means we
[59:00] were in favor at some point you can't be
[59:03] restored if you weren't there in the
[59:04] first place we were in favor we came out
[59:08] of favor and he says so God is
[59:10] reconciling the world to himself not
[59:12] imputing their trespasses unto him right
[59:15] the sin debt was paid Forever at Calvary
[59:17] were justified in his eyes through the
[59:18] blood he says and he had committed unto
[59:22] us the word of reconciliation how how
[59:26] are we going to come back into favor
[59:27] with God the word of
[59:31] reconciliation what does it mean to
[59:32] reconcile it's a word of restoration
[59:35] it's a message of restoration that's
[59:38] going to do the work it's a word of
[59:40] restoration that's going to give us full
[59:42] Redemption that's why we need Malachi 4
[59:45] it's got to turn us back to the original
[59:47] word it's got to turn us back to that
[59:49] restoring word it'll take us back to
[59:51] relationship with God Authority with God
[59:53] and our position with God like Adam had
[59:55] in the beginning
[59:57] you can preach a year on that and never
[59:58] scratch the surface of it remember but
[1:00:01] Paul's telling us here that God was in
[1:00:03] Christ doing a restoring work and then
[1:00:05] all of a sudden Christ goes off the
[1:00:07] scene it
[1:00:08] seems how can he can how can he do a
[1:00:11] reconciling work if he's not here it's a
[1:00:13] good question it's a good question amen
[1:00:16] Christ he he ascended first he descended
[1:00:19] at Birth and then he ascended after his
[1:00:22] resurrection amen and then it seems like
[1:00:24] we're left with nothing to work with God
[1:00:26] has ascended and now we're on our own
[1:00:29] God was above us to start that didn't
[1:00:31] change us God was with us that didn't
[1:00:33] change us either and now he's supposed
[1:00:36] to reconcile us back to himself and he's
[1:00:38] gone how's he going to do it Christ was
[1:00:42] here and he was perfect but he left us
[1:00:44] imperfect how are we going to be
[1:00:46] reconciled back to God Look what Jesus
[1:00:49] said of himself he says which one of you
[1:00:51] convinces me of sin and if I say the
[1:00:53] truth why do you not believe me then
[1:00:56] Corinthians Paul would say for he had
[1:00:57] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[1:01:01] sin that we might be made the
[1:01:03] righteousness of God in him Jesus
[1:01:06] declared his own sinless Perfection he
[1:01:09] had to he had to know that he was
[1:01:11] sinless he had to know that he was
[1:01:13] perfect and accepted before God
[1:01:15] otherwise he could not lay down his life
[1:01:17] he had to know who he was and he had to
[1:01:20] know that his conscience was clear of
[1:01:21] those things and yet while he stood
[1:01:23] there in his Perfection it did nothing
[1:01:26] for you and I in fact his Perfection
[1:01:28] judged us all the
[1:01:32] more so when he's done his work and he
[1:01:35] leaves we're still standing in judgment
[1:01:39] not only that but he would say to his
[1:01:40] own disciples he says be ye therefore
[1:01:42] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:01:45] heaven is
[1:01:46] perfect that's a
[1:01:48] command that's a requirement and he's
[1:01:52] telling them be perfect and then he says
[1:01:54] unless your perfection your
[1:01:56] righteousness is greater than that of
[1:01:57] the Pharisees you can't see the Kingdom
[1:01:59] of Heaven they're sitting there saying
[1:02:01] Jesus are you kidding
[1:02:03] me look at
[1:02:05] me look at me I'm not even as good as
[1:02:07] them and you're saying they're not going
[1:02:08] to get in I've got to be better than
[1:02:10] them now you're not just telling me to
[1:02:11] be better than them you're telling me to
[1:02:13] be
[1:02:14] perfect how how am I going to do this
[1:02:18] and it seems like condemnation would
[1:02:19] come all over them because they can't be
[1:02:22] those things but it's Jesus telling the
[1:02:24] Believers you've got to move beyond what
[1:02:26] you can do in
[1:02:27] yourself that's the thing it ought not
[1:02:30] to tell put us into a tail spin where we
[1:02:32] try and do things but it ought to tell
[1:02:34] us there is a different way than me
[1:02:36] trying there's a different Power that's
[1:02:38] required for this sort of thing amen
[1:02:40] we've got to get to our place where we
[1:02:42] see ourselves through his eyes not ours
[1:02:45] and that's when we'll get to see our
[1:02:46] Perfection amen that's where God's
[1:02:48] trying to get us he's given us a word of
[1:02:50] reconciliation he's given us a word of
[1:02:52] res Redemption of restoration amen and
[1:02:55] what he's asking us to do is believe it
[1:02:58] accept it and let it do a work that's
[1:03:01] all he asks of us to do is to accept the
[1:03:03] word that he's given us watch how Jesus
[1:03:05] sets up the the the disciples before
[1:03:07] he's before he goes he says then opened
[1:03:10] he their understanding that they might
[1:03:12] understand the scriptures and said unto
[1:03:14] them thus it was thus it is written and
[1:03:17] thus it beho Christ to suffer and to
[1:03:19] rise from the dead the third day so
[1:03:21] remember before this he told them what
[1:03:23] was going to happen but as far as we
[1:03:25] know the scriptures he never tied it to
[1:03:28] scripture he just said this is what is
[1:03:30] going to happen remember the Bible says
[1:03:31] the disciples didn't understand it now
[1:03:34] after his after he he resurrects he
[1:03:37] comes back to them and now he takes them
[1:03:40] into the word and he says this is where
[1:03:42] it all was you didn't see it but it was
[1:03:45] there it's already happened it's done
[1:03:47] and that's why I had to do what I had to
[1:03:49] do Peter that's why you couldn't save me
[1:03:52] on the night that they took me away
[1:03:54] that's why I had to be rejected that's
[1:03:56] why you had to leave me is because I had
[1:03:58] to go and die and fulfill the scriptures
[1:04:01] so that this Plan of Redemption could
[1:04:03] get kicked
[1:04:04] off until he tied it to the word they
[1:04:06] never saw
[1:04:08] it but as soon as he tied it to the word
[1:04:11] There Eyes came open and they
[1:04:13] understanded amen everything that David
[1:04:15] said and and Isaiah said and Zachariah
[1:04:17] said and all these things was lying
[1:04:19] there but they didn't see it until after
[1:04:21] it
[1:04:22] happened cuz if they saw it happening in
[1:04:25] real time they they might have tried to
[1:04:26] stop
[1:04:27] it but afterwards he opens their eyes
[1:04:29] and lets them see
[1:04:31] it it says and what's the reason that
[1:04:34] repentance and remission of sins should
[1:04:36] be preached in his name among all
[1:04:37] nations beginning at Jerusalem what's
[1:04:40] the purpose now why did he come and do
[1:04:42] this so that the law could be set aside
[1:04:44] and now he could preach that there's a
[1:04:45] taking away of sins and that'll restore
[1:04:48] you back to the presence of
[1:04:49] God he says and you are witnesses of
[1:04:52] these things past present and your
[1:04:55] Witnesses of what's about to
[1:04:57] come he says and behold I send the
[1:05:00] promise of my father upon you that's
[1:05:01] Ezekiel 36 Joel 2:28 but T ye in the
[1:05:05] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:05:08] with power from on high now watch this
[1:05:10] now Jesus is starting the New Covenant
[1:05:12] of Grace through faith in him but that
[1:05:15] Grace comes with
[1:05:18] power see too many times we got people
[1:05:20] claiming Grace and they turn it into a
[1:05:22] disgrace because what they do is they
[1:05:25] accept the work of the blood in terms of
[1:05:27] covering their sins but they never take
[1:05:29] the power that's offered with grace to
[1:05:31] change their lives he says listen this
[1:05:34] power this Grace it comes with power and
[1:05:37] it's going to change you and you can't
[1:05:39] move until you've been changed you can't
[1:05:42] move until you get power amen the
[1:05:45] disciples already had power they have
[1:05:47] power over demons they had power over
[1:05:49] sickness they have power over
[1:05:51] death that's not the power he's talking
[1:05:54] about he's talking talking a different
[1:05:56] kind of power he's talking a power that
[1:05:59] will do a different kind of work in
[1:06:00] their life amen listen they needed an
[1:06:03] effect in their own bodies in their own
[1:06:05] lives in their own Souls that the signs
[1:06:07] and wonders are just the effects that's
[1:06:09] the works of the spirit it's the works
[1:06:11] of the spirit but there's an inner work
[1:06:13] that had to be done amen so that can't
[1:06:15] be the power he's giving them the power
[1:06:17] he was giving them was not just power
[1:06:18] over death and hell and the grave and
[1:06:20] the demons and sickness and these things
[1:06:22] it had to be something that would do an
[1:06:23] internal work remember he told pet when
[1:06:26] thou art converted strengthen thy
[1:06:27] Brethren it had to be a converting work
[1:06:30] it had to be a redeeming work he says
[1:06:33] and then he led them out as far as to
[1:06:35] Bethany and he lifted up his hands and
[1:06:37] blessed them and it came to pass while
[1:06:39] he blessed them he was parted from them
[1:06:42] and carried up into heaven so he's
[1:06:44] called them into Perfection he's called
[1:06:46] them into service he's called them to be
[1:06:48] Witnesses he's called them to preach the
[1:06:50] gospel they're called to heal the sick
[1:06:52] they're called to cast out demons to
[1:06:53] continue the works of Jesus
[1:06:56] but they need power like they've never
[1:06:57] had
[1:06:58] before they need life-changing power
[1:07:02] they need surrendering power they need
[1:07:04] humbling power they need leading power
[1:07:07] they need guiding
[1:07:09] power they need something inside of them
[1:07:12] that can defeat
[1:07:13] themselves what do they need see God
[1:07:16] with them was
[1:07:18] wonderful we love the presence of God in
[1:07:21] a in a in a church atmosphere in
[1:07:22] particular don't we but what happens if
[1:07:25] we go out and that presence doesn't go
[1:07:27] with us same thing that happened to the
[1:07:29] disciples when he wasn't there they got
[1:07:31] fearful when he wasn't there they didn't
[1:07:33] have the victory when he wasn't there
[1:07:35] they started squabbling about who was
[1:07:37] the the greatest in the
[1:07:39] Kingdom right as soon as he left then
[1:07:42] all of the effects went with them and
[1:07:44] even while he was there sometimes they
[1:07:46] still didn't have the full effect of it
[1:07:48] because of their
[1:07:50] unbelief what they were still overcome
[1:07:53] by themselves they couldn't get past
[1:07:56] themselves let's go back to where we
[1:07:58] started in service at the beginning
[1:08:00] Jesus said I pray the father and he will
[1:08:03] give you another comforter that he may
[1:08:04] abide with you forever forever not in
[1:08:09] and out not come into church and go out
[1:08:11] and lose the victory abide that means
[1:08:14] live with live with you
[1:08:19] forever it's not from special meetings
[1:08:22] to special meetings it's not a youth
[1:08:24] camp experience erience it's a daily
[1:08:27] abiding of the personal presence of
[1:08:30] almighty God that's what he's telling
[1:08:32] them about amen now watch this
[1:08:34] description he says it's even the spirit
[1:08:37] of Truth why does it have to be a spirit
[1:08:39] of truth because what God us here was a
[1:08:41] lying Spirit a religious lying spirit so
[1:08:46] it's got to be a spirit of Truth and
[1:08:48] it's got to be a spirit of truth because
[1:08:50] it's bringing a word of
[1:08:52] reconciliation it's got to be true if
[1:08:54] it's going to do a work amen it'll take
[1:08:56] the spirit of the word which is the
[1:08:57] spirit of God to undo this work of that
[1:09:00] deceiving lying Spirit of Satan he says
[1:09:02] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:09:04] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:09:05] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[1:09:08] he dwells with you and shall be in you I
[1:09:13] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:09:16] come to you personal pronoun the same
[1:09:19] person is coming back not a third person
[1:09:21] of the Trinity it's the exact same
[1:09:24] person
[1:09:26] I will come to you
[1:09:30] period he says yet a little while and
[1:09:33] the world seeth me no more but because
[1:09:35] ye but ye see me and because I live you
[1:09:39] shall live also church if Christ didn't
[1:09:41] raised from the dead we'd be stuck in a
[1:09:43] cycle because our sins would be forgiven
[1:09:46] but we'd have no overcoming power we'd
[1:09:49] just be at a place of being able to go
[1:09:52] nowhere but because he lives we live
[1:09:55] also so if the same spirit that raised
[1:09:58] Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll
[1:10:00] Quicken your mortal body it'll make this
[1:10:02] body live that's not just a resurrection
[1:10:05] power that's a day-by-day power it'll
[1:10:07] make this life live the life that it's
[1:10:09] supposed to amen it's the living Christ
[1:10:11] that makes us who we are today not the
[1:10:13] dead
[1:10:14] Christ he says and at that day you shall
[1:10:17] know that I am in my father and you in
[1:10:20] me and I in you now we can jump ahead to
[1:10:23] Acts 2 and see what that looks like
[1:10:26] and I love that about the scripture
[1:10:28] because the scripture interprets the
[1:10:31] scripture I heard a Catholic say the
[1:10:33] other day he says we can't just stick
[1:10:36] with scripture because everybody
[1:10:38] interprets scripture differently and
[1:10:39] therefore we need other books to
[1:10:41] interpret
[1:10:44] scripture but what we have a prophet
[1:10:46] tell us he says God interprets his word
[1:10:49] only one way by bringing it to pass so
[1:10:54] Jesus tells him in John 14 what this
[1:10:56] looks like how do we know what that
[1:10:58] looks like church we look at what he did
[1:11:01] that's
[1:11:02] it if we if we believe the word a
[1:11:05] certain way how do we know it's right
[1:11:08] when it does what it says it was going
[1:11:10] to do it's very simple the problem with
[1:11:13] that is it requires patience it requires
[1:11:16] patience amen but can you imagine having
[1:11:20] the arrogance the audacity to say God
[1:11:23] needs me to do something to interpret
[1:11:25] his
[1:11:26] word church I can't even understand it
[1:11:31] unless he reveals it to
[1:11:33] me remember what he said to Peter Flesh
[1:11:36] and Blood had not revealed it to you in
[1:11:37] other words Jesus was saying it's not
[1:11:39] something that even I've said to you are
[1:11:41] done to you he says but my Father which
[1:11:43] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[1:11:45] it's a revelation from God Almighty that
[1:11:48] opens the word to us and that's it
[1:11:50] otherwise we'll twist ourselves in
[1:11:52] knots and what we what do we come up
[1:11:54] with we come up with death cuz as soon
[1:11:57] as we inject ourselves into it it loses
[1:11:59] all of its life and all we get is death
[1:12:01] and a mess and a
[1:12:03] denomination what's the problem the
[1:12:05] problem is we won't take it as it's
[1:12:07] given believe it as he said it and let
[1:12:10] it do what he said it would
[1:12:12] do I was reading habac in devotions
[1:12:14] earlier this week God said this he says
[1:12:17] the Lord answered me and said write the
[1:12:19] vision and make it plain upon tables
[1:12:21] that he may run that readeth it for the
[1:12:24] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[1:12:27] at the end it shall speak and not lie
[1:12:31] and though it t wait for it because it
[1:12:34] will surely come it will not t remember
[1:12:37] God was telling them he's saying the
[1:12:38] vision's right but there's going to come
[1:12:40] a time you think the vision's wrong
[1:12:42] because it hasn't happened yet but he
[1:12:45] says when that time comes
[1:12:48] carry wait stick with it because it's
[1:12:51] for an appointed time and when the
[1:12:53] appointed time comes the word will speak
[1:12:56] the word will do exactly what it said
[1:12:57] it's going to do and you'll see that it
[1:12:59] wasn't a lie but you've got to wait for
[1:13:01] the appointed time you've got to have
[1:13:04] patience amen that's a huge problem
[1:13:07] today when everything is so
[1:13:09] instantaneous we don't have to wait for
[1:13:11] anything except seeing a
[1:13:13] doctor we don't have to wait for
[1:13:15] anything information's at our tips
[1:13:17] access communication everything's at our
[1:13:20] tips what used to take months maybe a
[1:13:24] year to cross the country we can do in 6
[1:13:26] or8 hours we can get anywhere in the
[1:13:28] world within 36
[1:13:32] hours everything we could ever want is
[1:13:34] at our
[1:13:35] fingertips and you know what God
[1:13:38] says impatience possess you your
[1:13:42] souls stick with the word have patience
[1:13:45] with the
[1:13:46] word that was a test for the disciples
[1:13:50] because Jesus says go and wait until
[1:13:52] you're endued with power and he doesn't
[1:13:54] give them a Time
[1:13:55] like go wait how long do we wait church
[1:14:00] we wait until he does what he says he
[1:14:03] would do and by God's grace every single
[1:14:05] one of them 120 people went up in that
[1:14:07] room and they stayed there and they
[1:14:09] stayed there and they stayed there They
[1:14:11] carried as he told them to do and they
[1:14:13] stayed there until the promised word
[1:14:14] came into
[1:14:16] effect doesn't mean it was comfortable
[1:14:19] doesn't mean it was easy but they stayed
[1:14:21] there why they believed the word
[1:14:25] that's simple that's the only thing that
[1:14:27] holds us that's the nature of a Believer
[1:14:29] church is we stay with the word we
[1:14:32] believe
[1:14:33] it though it
[1:14:35] terries though it waits though it seems
[1:14:38] like it's held off we stay with the word
[1:14:42] that's what makes us a Believer we hold
[1:14:43] to it Watch What Happens now Acts
[1:14:47] 2 says and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:14:49] fully come they were all with one Accord
[1:14:52] in one place what is it it's Unity under
[1:14:54] the word
[1:14:55] that's the only place you'll find Unity
[1:14:57] is when we're under the word led by the
[1:14:59] word in obedience to the word why
[1:15:02] because we're all playing from the same
[1:15:03] Playbook we're all under the same
[1:15:05] Authority we're all under the same
[1:15:06] orders he says and suddenly there was no
[1:15:10] buildup that's the way God works so many
[1:15:13] times is it's
[1:15:15] nothing and then in a moment in a
[1:15:17] twinkling of an eye the situation
[1:15:22] changes we don't have this big warning
[1:15:26] one minute we're sick the next minute
[1:15:28] we're healed one minute we're broke the
[1:15:31] next minute our needs are met one minute
[1:15:34] the situation is completely out of hand
[1:15:36] and the next minute it's
[1:15:38] peace one minute we're lost the next
[1:15:41] minute we're
[1:15:43] saved
[1:15:45] right God when he moves he moves and
[1:15:48] nothing can stop them nothing can hold
[1:15:50] them back at the appointed time CU it
[1:15:53] had to be the day of Pentecost it had to
[1:15:55] be that Jubilee it had to be that
[1:15:57] freedom
[1:15:58] day and at the appointed time it says
[1:16:01] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:16:03] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:16:05] filled all the house where they were
[1:16:07] sitting now is the wind the Holy
[1:16:10] Spirit no the wind's just a
[1:16:13] precursor it's an
[1:16:15] announcement something's
[1:16:17] happening he says and there appeared
[1:16:19] unto them clothing tongues like as of
[1:16:22] fire and it sat upon each of them notice
[1:16:25] out this is a revelation of what Reeve
[1:16:27] of what the of what receiving the holy
[1:16:29] spirit is this is why you can't believe
[1:16:31] in a Trinity right here you'll never
[1:16:34] understand what's happening here if you
[1:16:34] put it in a trinity Doctrine because
[1:16:36] Jesus said I will come to you and here
[1:16:39] it is this is Jesus coming
[1:16:42] back scripture interprets scripture I
[1:16:46] don't interpret scripture the scripture
[1:16:48] interprets itself amen Jesus has
[1:16:51] returned back and what form is he in a
[1:16:54] pillar of
[1:16:56] fire not a third person he's gone back
[1:17:00] to light he's gone back to the form he
[1:17:03] was he said I was up I came down now I'm
[1:17:05] going back he's back in the same thing
[1:17:09] remember when he knocks Saul off of the
[1:17:10] horse Saul says who are you to the
[1:17:13] pillar of fire lord who are you and he
[1:17:15] says I am
[1:17:17] Jesus doesn't it look like
[1:17:20] Jesus now what is it that Pillar of Fire
[1:17:24] has come come down
[1:17:26] again what is it it's the continuity of
[1:17:30] God showing it's the same
[1:17:32] thing he says and they were all filled
[1:17:35] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:17:36] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:17:38] them utterance now we covered this
[1:17:39] before that what they were speaking
[1:17:40] there was not tongues that were unknown
[1:17:42] to everybody as in it sounded like
[1:17:44] gibberish these were tongues that were
[1:17:46] known
[1:17:48] languages and so they were speaking and
[1:17:50] it would be like me talking to an
[1:17:51] Italian I don't speak Italian but I
[1:17:54] would be speaking speaking to an Italian
[1:17:55] that only knows Italian and they would
[1:17:57] hear my voice as if I was speaking
[1:17:58] Italian that's what's happening
[1:18:00] everybody that was gathered there heard
[1:18:01] them in their own
[1:18:03] language regardless of what language
[1:18:05] those people were speaking amen it's a
[1:18:07] supernatural tongues not a gift of
[1:18:09] tongues but notice there catch what
[1:18:11] these tongues represent not the tongues
[1:18:12] that they were speaking but these
[1:18:14] tongues of fire because the scripture
[1:18:15] says that the tongues of fire set on
[1:18:17] each person every person in that room
[1:18:20] got a little tongue of
[1:18:22] fire there's a reason why it say they're
[1:18:25] tongues of fire remember brother Brandon
[1:18:27] was talking about that movie The Ten
[1:18:29] Commandments and he and I just read this
[1:18:30] the other day and he says I don't know
[1:18:32] where Cecil B deil the the director of
[1:18:35] it he says I don't know how he got this
[1:18:37] he says but he got the pillar fire
[1:18:38] perfect he says because it's whirling
[1:18:40] around but there's little Flames little
[1:18:42] tongues coming off of it it's made up of
[1:18:44] little tongues all around whirling so
[1:18:47] what what's he talking about
[1:18:49] here he's talking about God coming down
[1:18:52] and pieces of himself coming off and
[1:18:54] rest
[1:18:55] on
[1:18:57] people it's God showing his continuity
[1:19:01] see it wasn't God above us and then a
[1:19:04] different God With Us and now a
[1:19:05] different God in us it's the same God
[1:19:07] all the way through that's why it had to
[1:19:10] be a pillar of fire come down here it's
[1:19:13] the God that was above us now coming to
[1:19:15] be in us it's the exact same thing we
[1:19:18] know God reveals himself he revealed
[1:19:20] himself in a pillar of fire pillar of
[1:19:22] light in a burning bush he revealed rece
[1:19:24] revealed himself in a man called mzc
[1:19:27] came down in a pillar of cloud he came
[1:19:29] down in Angelic forms all other things
[1:19:30] in scripture they're just forms they're
[1:19:32] just mass that God hides behind but it's
[1:19:34] the same God time and time again so if
[1:19:38] we look here God gets broken
[1:19:41] up does that diminish
[1:19:43] God is God diminished no it's just his
[1:19:47] attributes coming off it's his life
[1:19:49] coming off you take away from from
[1:19:51] everything you take away from Infinity
[1:19:53] what's left everything
[1:19:55] it does not diminish God's not
[1:19:57] diminished in these things but he's
[1:19:58] breaking off a part of himself he's
[1:20:00] showing it's not a different person it's
[1:20:03] not a different God it's the same God
[1:20:05] and now he's become a part of you it's
[1:20:08] all one and the same thing it's all one
[1:20:10] and the same thing it was God's final
[1:20:12] condescension to man brother BR says it
[1:20:14] this way he says according to scripture
[1:20:16] in the upper room waiting suddenly a
[1:20:18] sound like a rushing wind that was upon
[1:20:20] them he says that was the Holy Spirit
[1:20:22] how many believe that that was the
[1:20:24] appearing of the Holy Spirit like a wind
[1:20:28] a supernatural wind then they noticed
[1:20:30] and out in there was a little tongue of
[1:20:32] fire 120 of them and begin to settle
[1:20:34] down and said upon each of them what was
[1:20:37] it the pillar of fire which was God
[1:20:40] himself dividing himself among his
[1:20:43] people coming into the people Jesus had
[1:20:47] the whole thing he had the spear without
[1:20:48] measure we get it by measure because
[1:20:50] we're adopted children his eternal life
[1:20:53] was coming in now what happened he says
[1:20:55] then they were all filled with the Holy
[1:20:59] Ghost what is power cuz Jesus said
[1:21:02] you're going to be ued with power that
[1:21:05] word ued it means to be robed to be
[1:21:09] clothed with power remember we preached
[1:21:12] on
[1:21:13] adoption an adoption in the old time was
[1:21:15] when the son was deemed by the father to
[1:21:18] be ready for authority and so we have
[1:21:21] this public ceremony and then he would
[1:21:22] put a robe of authority upon on
[1:21:26] him so what's he talking about with the
[1:21:29] with the disciples he's saying you need
[1:21:30] to be
[1:21:31] robed you need to be deemed
[1:21:34] worthy and given
[1:21:38] Authority we preached before that I do
[1:21:40] not necessarily believe and I believe
[1:21:42] the scripture supports me on this that
[1:21:44] when you get the Holy Spirit you're
[1:21:47] adopted but you can receive the Holy
[1:21:51] Spirit and be adopted in that same
[1:21:52] moment cuz remember adoption is a
[1:21:54] process of time it's a process of
[1:21:57] teaching training testing and proving
[1:22:01] and unfortunately that doesn't happen in
[1:22:02] a moment we're creatures of time but the
[1:22:06] disciples have been tested they have
[1:22:09] been taught they have been tried and
[1:22:11] guess what church they had even failed
[1:22:14] that didn't stop them from coming into
[1:22:15] adoption CU what had been proven was
[1:22:17] their heart
[1:22:18] intentions but you still need power good
[1:22:21] intentions won't get you there but if
[1:22:24] you have power power behind the
[1:22:25] intentions of a solid heart that's lined
[1:22:27] with the word of God now you can get
[1:22:28] somewhere
[1:22:29] amen so they had showed that they wanted
[1:22:32] to be true disciples they had showed
[1:22:35] they wanted to be faithful but they
[1:22:37] couldn't do it you know David wanted so
[1:22:39] badly you see him in the Old Testament
[1:22:41] his desires and and he got frustrated
[1:22:44] with himself David was frustrated about
[1:22:46] what he did with
[1:22:47] basba that wasn't what David wanted but
[1:22:51] the flesh wanted it and it it burned him
[1:22:54] it h heard him that he did that and it
[1:22:57] was a struggle it was a source of
[1:22:58] frustration and we see it through the
[1:22:59] Old Testament lots of people everybody
[1:23:01] really wanting to live life a certain
[1:23:04] way and then not being able to do
[1:23:07] it and they failed and they failed and
[1:23:10] they
[1:23:11] failed now Peter comes down Peter's a
[1:23:14] failure by God's grace we're going to
[1:23:16] spend Wednesday on Peter they don't want
[1:23:18] to preach too much about him but Peter
[1:23:19] goes up into that Upper Room of failure
[1:23:22] a coward weak
[1:23:27] spineless too interested in
[1:23:30] self-preservation doeses Peter come down
[1:23:31] and an adopted son of God I believe he
[1:23:34] did I believe he did he came down amen
[1:23:39] he had stuck with the word he obeyed
[1:23:40] Christ's command and that was his final
[1:23:42] test God not only filled him with the
[1:23:44] spirit God adopted Peter and now those
[1:23:47] keys to the kingdom that he gave could
[1:23:49] be put into
[1:23:50] use what did he do Peter didn't just
[1:23:53] come down with signs and wonders but now
[1:23:55] he's under the authority and the
[1:23:57] leadership of the Holy Spirit brother
[1:23:58] Braham says he came down an inspired
[1:24:01] teacher right remember Jesus had
[1:24:03] committed them the gospel of
[1:24:06] reconciliation so what did Peter come
[1:24:08] down with a message of
[1:24:11] reconciliation he tells them what
[1:24:13] they've done that they've crucified the
[1:24:14] prince of glory and they say how do we
[1:24:17] fix this how do we get reconciled and he
[1:24:21] says repent and be baptized in the name
[1:24:23] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:24:25] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:24:28] the Holy Ghost Peter comes down and
[1:24:30] preaches the word of reconciliation and
[1:24:32] in one day 3,000 Souls were added to the
[1:24:35] kingdom what's the difference church
[1:24:38] it's not just power with them it's power
[1:24:40] in him it's not just God with him it's
[1:24:43] God in him now Peter's anointed by
[1:24:45] something else it's different it's a
[1:24:46] it's a different experience to have it
[1:24:48] in him rather than with him and Peter
[1:24:51] gets results like he's never had before
[1:24:54] BR says it this way he says now his
[1:24:56] body's up there the body of Christ
[1:24:58] descended that physical body was laid
[1:25:00] aside waiting for a return back to the
[1:25:01] Jews he says his spirit's down here his
[1:25:05] Spirit God's spirit worked through that
[1:25:06] body his virgin born son in the fullness
[1:25:09] of God then he watch this face shift he
[1:25:12] says he works through you and
[1:25:14] I as portions of
[1:25:20] God could I ask all portions of God to
[1:25:23] stand up this this
[1:25:31] morning I say we're living under our
[1:25:35] privileges Church portions of
[1:25:39] God the condescending God live in this
[1:25:43] live in
[1:25:46] this brother Bob are you kidding me live
[1:25:50] in you
[1:25:55] but that's what he
[1:25:56] did that's what he
[1:25:59] did you talk about a God that humbles
[1:26:02] himself so that you and I could be
[1:26:05] called Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:07] portions of God listen my daughter here
[1:26:11] she doesn't have her daddy's looks
[1:26:13] thanks God but she's a portion of
[1:26:16] me and we are no different when it comes
[1:26:19] to him we are portions of God
[1:26:24] he says that's why the Holy Spirit when
[1:26:26] it came on the day of Pentecost it broke
[1:26:28] all up that Pillar of Fire and divided
[1:26:31] itself in licks of tongues and sat upon
[1:26:33] each one he says we have to have one
[1:26:38] another amen we need one another Paul on
[1:26:43] the road to Damascus gets knocked off he
[1:26:45] looks at that pillar fire he says Lord
[1:26:47] who are you and he says I am Jesus but
[1:26:51] then he says these three words whom thou
[1:26:54] th
[1:26:55] persecutest was Paul persecuting the
[1:26:57] pillar of
[1:26:59] fire was Paul doing bad things to the
[1:27:02] pillar of fire no who was he doing it
[1:27:05] to portions of
[1:27:09] God Jesus identified himself by name and
[1:27:14] person with those that were filled with
[1:27:17] the Holy
[1:27:21] Spirit Church this isn't theology
[1:27:24] we are so far beyond theology now we're
[1:27:27] into
[1:27:29] reality we're into the effect of a
[1:27:31] living God is to the point where he
[1:27:34] identifies you as himself by
[1:27:40] name that's where we
[1:27:43] are I didn't identify myself he
[1:27:45] identified
[1:27:49] me I'm not reading my name he's reading
[1:27:52] my name
[1:27:54] I'm not saying I'm him he's saying he's
[1:27:58] me and I'll tell you what I like what he
[1:28:01] says about me a whole lot more than what
[1:28:02] I say about
[1:28:07] me where are we at this morning
[1:28:12] church listen he says the biggest thing
[1:28:14] the devil ever got on us was when he
[1:28:16] separated us from the love of God and
[1:28:17] from one another and we love one another
[1:28:20] that's brotherly love and when we can
[1:28:22] get to one another if you've got part of
[1:28:24] the Holy Ghost and I've got part of it
[1:28:26] and the next man's part of it put us
[1:28:27] together that's three parts I'm three
[1:28:30] times as strong as I was with you two
[1:28:33] brothers see that's the way we stand
[1:28:36] together we stand and divided we'll fall
[1:28:38] he says that's right we must stand that
[1:28:41] way together what is it God has
[1:28:44] condescended and now he's dwelling in
[1:28:46] his family in the Old Testament he was
[1:28:49] in the holy of holies in the bridge
[1:28:51] between the Old and New Testament he
[1:28:52] dwelt in a body called Jesus and now in
[1:28:55] the Old Testament to finalize this
[1:28:57] mystery of redemption he's dwelling in
[1:29:00] you and I and we are identified by name
[1:29:05] by person by attribute by Nature by
[1:29:09] works by
[1:29:11] word all that he is we are identified by
[1:29:15] it but it's a little bit in each and
[1:29:18] every one of
[1:29:19] us he says oh God if the world could
[1:29:22] only
[1:29:24] if the world could only see that that
[1:29:26] God and man are one the super sign was
[1:29:30] that first man that God could come into
[1:29:32] and all that God was he poured into
[1:29:35] Christ and most of the world stops there
[1:29:38] but he says all that Christ was he
[1:29:40] poured into the church a super sign God
[1:29:44] and man together that was to be the
[1:29:46] Super sign of the last day when the
[1:29:49] entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the
[1:29:51] last
[1:29:52] days a super sign I love this a virgin
[1:29:57] shall conceive and this conception when
[1:29:59] it's brought forth will be God
[1:30:00] manifested In the Flesh a super sign he
[1:30:02] says they still don't believe it but it
[1:30:06] was
[1:30:07] anyhow he says it's still a super sign
[1:30:10] they've got Superman today they've got
[1:30:12] fictions of Superman all these other
[1:30:13] kinds of super things but the church has
[1:30:16] got a super sign God back in the church
[1:30:19] manifested in human flesh God United
[1:30:22] with man his sure sup sign I want you to
[1:30:24] think about that this morning church if
[1:30:27] you have received the true baptism of
[1:30:29] the Holy Spirit you have almighty God
[1:30:33] living inside of
[1:30:35] you I don't know if we can understand it
[1:30:38] I don't think I can
[1:30:40] frankly but he's
[1:30:42] there but he's
[1:30:45] there if you were to go tell somebody
[1:30:47] today I have God living inside of me
[1:30:50] what would they say
[1:30:54] they'll believe that a man is a woman
[1:30:55] and a woman is a man and you can have a
[1:30:57] nature of a cat or a dog but they won't
[1:31:00] believe that God could live inside of
[1:31:02] you I sometimes question if we believe
[1:31:04] it
[1:31:06] ourselves because if we did I think we'd
[1:31:08] walk a little
[1:31:16] differently but I love what he says here
[1:31:18] they still don't believe it but it was
[1:31:22] anyhow the the world not believing
[1:31:24] doesn't stop it the world not believing
[1:31:27] doesn't make it not real the world not
[1:31:30] believing doesn't stop church let me
[1:31:32] tell you my not
[1:31:34] believing you know what that's one of
[1:31:36] the only things that can hold God back
[1:31:37] is my unbelief Jesus constantly through
[1:31:40] the gospels he's abrading the disciples
[1:31:43] from their lack of unbelief but you know
[1:31:46] what even that never stopped
[1:31:49] him he'll get us to a place where we
[1:31:52] believe he'll get us to a place where
[1:31:54] we'll act he'll get us to a place where
[1:31:55] we'll stand he'll get us to the place
[1:31:57] where we'll hold fast and
[1:31:59] T until he fulfills his word inside of
[1:32:02] our life
[1:32:03] amen he says if he went to the
[1:32:07] Father the Holy Spirit would come is
[1:32:09] that right another scripture says if I
[1:32:12] go not away the comforter will not come
[1:32:13] but if I go away I'll come again and be
[1:32:15] with you even in you he says see it's
[1:32:17] God with you over you first with you in
[1:32:21] Christ he says in you in the Holy H
[1:32:24] ghost he says it's God in
[1:32:28] you listening to Christ's a mystery of
[1:32:30] God revealed this morning brother Bram
[1:32:31] says the bride needs to recognize her
[1:32:35] position her
[1:32:37] position ye are the
[1:32:40] Tabernacle of the Holy Ghost you are the
[1:32:43] bride of
[1:32:46] Christ he says and now that's why these
[1:32:48] true Miracles can be done because it's a
[1:32:50] promise of God the things that I do
[1:32:51] shall you also St John 14:12
[1:32:54] he Christ that still the winds and the
[1:32:56] waves is the creator of them he is still
[1:32:58] just as much Creator as he was then he's
[1:33:01] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:33:03] healed the sick and destroyed sin and
[1:33:06] changed it
[1:33:08] all for
[1:33:11] you and came to you that he might dwell
[1:33:15] with you he conquered all these things
[1:33:19] to come and live in
[1:33:22] us see he conquered it all out there now
[1:33:26] what does he do when he comes and lives
[1:33:27] with us he conquers it right here
[1:33:30] too see it can't be a gospel for
[1:33:33] everyone else
[1:33:35] Church can't be a gospel for everyone
[1:33:37] else it needs to be my gospel before I
[1:33:39] can make it your
[1:33:41] gospel he says he that is Con he is that
[1:33:44] conqueror that's already conquered these
[1:33:46] things proved it in the scriptures came
[1:33:49] back and conquered everything and proved
[1:33:50] to you that he is the same God and after
[1:33:53] 19 UND years here he is still doing the
[1:33:55] same thing among us that he did then
[1:33:57] that conquered death hell sickness and
[1:34:00] the grave he says this Christ this he he
[1:34:04] is he that's in
[1:34:06] you see we want to not we we don't want
[1:34:08] to but to often we make it something
[1:34:11] we've got to go
[1:34:14] to we've got to access no no no that's
[1:34:16] why he's here so we don't have to bring
[1:34:19] him down we don't have to raise him up
[1:34:22] we don't have to put on a show
[1:34:26] he that's in you as John said he that's
[1:34:28] in you is greater than he that's in the
[1:34:29] world that was Christ he's greater than
[1:34:32] all of the world because he conquered
[1:34:33] the world and is greater than all those
[1:34:35] things be conquered because he conquered
[1:34:38] it for us and we are more than
[1:34:41] conquerors see he's the mighty conqueror
[1:34:43] but now Paul comes in he says now we are
[1:34:45] more than conquerors how through him
[1:34:48] that loved us and gave himself force
[1:34:51] that he might come back and do his Works
[1:34:53] through through us to prove to us that
[1:34:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:34:58] forever when God was living in Christ
[1:35:01] Church what couldn't Christ do what was
[1:35:04] held back
[1:35:06] nothing wind waves ocean nature it all
[1:35:11] obeyed him diseases left death destroyed
[1:35:16] demons cast
[1:35:19] out the only thing that ever held him
[1:35:21] back was unbelief he went back to
[1:35:23] Galilee it says he could not do many
[1:35:25] great Miracles because of their unbelief
[1:35:28] and again he still got past that with
[1:35:30] his
[1:35:31] disciples God will get us where he needs
[1:35:33] to get us Church you stick with it you
[1:35:35] stick with it God will get us where he
[1:35:37] needs to amen but God will get us there
[1:35:40] listen Peter was a coward but when that
[1:35:42] Holy Spirit sealed his soul he got faith
[1:35:44] and courage to finally stand up like he
[1:35:46] had never stood up before he came down
[1:35:48] knowing that they wanted him dead
[1:35:50] knowing that they were looking for the
[1:35:52] followers of Jesus now that they killed
[1:35:54] Jesus and he came down willingly with a
[1:35:57] message and he preached and he saved
[1:35:58] 3,000 Souls through that inspired
[1:36:00] message God will get us where we need to
[1:36:02] be to a place of overcoming
[1:36:06] power he says now notice Jesus had
[1:36:08] commissioned them to go up to Jerusalem
[1:36:09] and wait the word Terry means to wait it
[1:36:13] doesn't mean to pray it means to wait
[1:36:16] catch this now he's speaking of the
[1:36:18] disciples they were not fit subjects yet
[1:36:21] to preach
[1:36:23] why because they only knew his
[1:36:26] resurrection by his person of seeing him
[1:36:30] outside they had seen a resurrected
[1:36:34] Christ he says he commanded them not to
[1:36:37] preach anymore not to do nothing until
[1:36:39] first they had been endued with power
[1:36:41] from on high see Peter had a Ministry of
[1:36:43] signs and wonders and yet Peter didn't
[1:36:45] have overcoming power till
[1:36:46] Pentecost Peter couldn't get over
[1:36:48] himself Peter couldn't get over that
[1:36:50] instinct of self-preservation he backed
[1:36:53] down when his life was on the
[1:36:56] line like I said by God's grace we're
[1:36:58] going to take a full service on Peter on
[1:37:00] Wednesday but I want you to see that
[1:37:02] transformation of a child of God by
[1:37:04] receiving the Holy Spirit Peter's so
[1:37:06] real Peter's just like so many of us
[1:37:10] very flawed and yet the things that God
[1:37:13] could use through that man once he got
[1:37:14] the Holy Spirit but Peter only knew
[1:37:16] about power on him and if you notice
[1:37:19] once Jesus left Peter lost his
[1:37:22] ministry pet Peter doesn't have signs
[1:37:24] and wonders after Christ died Peter's
[1:37:26] abandoned Christ Christ has moved on
[1:37:28] what does Peter do Peter goes back to
[1:37:30] fishing Peter backslides goes back to
[1:37:33] his old life Peter lays aside his
[1:37:35] ministry why because he doesn't have it
[1:37:38] anymore he's lost that anointing it's
[1:37:41] gone and so he's just like any other
[1:37:44] man what did Peter need listen in order
[1:37:48] to preach a word of reconciliation he
[1:37:50] needed to be reconciled he needed to
[1:37:52] know what Rec ilation looked like Peter
[1:37:55] needed his conscience purged Peter
[1:37:57] needed this nature changed and Peter
[1:37:59] needed power to come up and stand up for
[1:38:01] the word of God Peter needed to know
[1:38:03] Christ in the power of his resurrection
[1:38:05] not just know that he was
[1:38:07] resurrected one's a theology the others
[1:38:09] in experience
[1:38:12] amen Peter didn't need power to talk
[1:38:15] Peter needed
[1:38:18] inspiration I can't get up here and give
[1:38:20] a
[1:38:20] speech it has to be inspiration or its
[1:38:24] death it'll bring us into false
[1:38:27] religion Peter needed to be able to
[1:38:29] preach by experience the thing that he
[1:38:31] was talking about you can't get up here
[1:38:34] and preach to get the Holy Ghost if you
[1:38:35] don't have the Holy Ghost how do you
[1:38:37] know it's real I'm not saying we have to
[1:38:39] preach everything by
[1:38:40] experience listen I haven't I haven't
[1:38:43] gotten a resurrection or a Rapture yet
[1:38:44] but I still preach it Paul said not as
[1:38:47] though I had already attained or either
[1:38:50] were already perfect that doesn't didn't
[1:38:52] keep him from stopping from preaching
[1:38:54] Perfection but he says what forgetting
[1:38:57] those things which are behind and
[1:39:00] reaching forward to those things which
[1:39:01] are before I pressed toward the mark for
[1:39:03] the prize of the high gol of God in
[1:39:05] Christ
[1:39:06] Jesus right just because I don't have it
[1:39:09] doesn't mean I don't keep
[1:39:10] pushing just because I don't have it
[1:39:12] doesn't mean I stop
[1:39:13] believing but I'll preach to you what
[1:39:15] I've got that's for sure so you can get
[1:39:17] at least what I've got I think we've got
[1:39:19] to be real about what we have but that
[1:39:22] doesn't mean we don't stop pushing for
[1:39:23] what's coming ahead either amen remember
[1:39:27] the new birth is just the earnest it's
[1:39:28] the down payment of what's coming it's
[1:39:30] not the full experience of what we're
[1:39:31] going to have but remember what happened
[1:39:34] Jesus said youve got to be endued with
[1:39:36] power you've got to be clothed with
[1:39:37] power notice what the Holy Ghost does
[1:39:39] what does it clothe what does it seal
[1:39:42] what does it wrap up the soul it's the
[1:39:45] soul that does that work amen our soul
[1:39:47] is wrapped up and filled with the Holy
[1:39:49] Ghost and that satisfies the Eternal
[1:39:51] portion within us that's our satisfying
[1:39:53] portion but this flesh can never be
[1:39:55] satisfied it's
[1:39:57] insatiable you can you can put
[1:39:59] sensuality in front of it you can put
[1:40:00] entertainment in front of it you can put
[1:40:02] uh all sorts of these things in front of
[1:40:04] it and it never satisfies it look at the
[1:40:05] world around us I think they say 70% of
[1:40:07] people in in North America are
[1:40:09] overweight now we're
[1:40:13] insatiable this flesh is never satisfied
[1:40:15] but there's an eternal portion that gets
[1:40:17] satisfied when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:40:19] absolutely and that's a comfort to us
[1:40:21] amen but that power is not not just
[1:40:23] given to satisfy it's given with purpose
[1:40:27] amen it does something for us but it's
[1:40:29] meant to do something through us as well
[1:40:31] when it's done a work in me then it's
[1:40:33] going to go on and go on to the next
[1:40:34] person and try and do something in their
[1:40:36] life as well amen it's meant to bring us
[1:40:38] to a place where we can live and act and
[1:40:40] react and be used by God that's never
[1:40:42] been possible before the holy spirit is
[1:40:46] for action but first it's got to do an
[1:40:49] internal work listen we can be good
[1:40:51] church attenders we can be good citizens
[1:40:53] good Bible believing people amen but we
[1:40:55] need a power to take this word and live
[1:40:58] it through every challenge through every
[1:41:00] trial through every circumstance through
[1:41:01] every
[1:41:02] hardship sometimes I think we need the
[1:41:04] Holy Ghost more in the good times
[1:41:05] because that's when most people fall
[1:41:07] away when things get desperate we all
[1:41:09] come back to God you need a holy ghost
[1:41:12] to keep you on when things are going
[1:41:13] great as well that's when Israel always
[1:41:16] got
[1:41:17] off watch now we're almost done he says
[1:41:19] watch God was in in spirit how could God
[1:41:23] be torn apart but one day God was made
[1:41:26] flesh and dwelt Among Us the Lord Jesus
[1:41:28] Christ the Emanuel and then there at
[1:41:30] Calvary the Covenant God wrote with us
[1:41:32] he took the Christ to Calvary and to him
[1:41:35] tore him apart soul and body and he took
[1:41:40] his body up to sit at the right hand of
[1:41:42] his majesty and sent the soul back here
[1:41:45] or the spirit on Earth to make a
[1:41:48] covenant what's this Covenant Church to
[1:41:51] carry out the gospel amen God bless you
[1:41:56] let's stand if we would carry out the
[1:41:58] gospel what does that mean brother John
[1:42:00] does that mean teaching sure but Jesus
[1:42:03] said to preach it to preach it means to
[1:42:07] speak it and live what you speak that's
[1:42:10] what a preacher
[1:42:11] is we ought to judge a preacher does his
[1:42:14] life match what's coming over that
[1:42:16] Pulpit because if not he's not a
[1:42:18] preacher he's a false teacher he doesn't
[1:42:21] have what he's talking about
[1:42:23] amen but Jesus said go live it prove it
[1:42:27] be an example of what the gospel is not
[1:42:31] just by word but by deed by life lived
[1:42:34] by decisions made by the way you dress
[1:42:37] by the way you speak by the things you
[1:42:39] do by the things you don't do and by the
[1:42:41] reality of the power of God working in
[1:42:43] your day-by-day life I believe that
[1:42:46] nobody ought to live a life greater than
[1:42:47] a
[1:42:49] Christian not in terms of money not in
[1:42:52] terms of influence but that ability to
[1:42:54] just walk through
[1:42:56] life and remain
[1:42:59] unworried and broke
[1:43:02] up by what's going on around
[1:43:04] us like David said yay though I walk
[1:43:06] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:43:08] death I'll fear no evil in the hardest
[1:43:11] times we can walk with our heads up with
[1:43:13] faith because we know he's not just
[1:43:15] walking with us he's walking in US amen
[1:43:19] it's not just God With Us now it's God
[1:43:22] in us
[1:43:23] the indwelling person of God in you and
[1:43:26] I this
[1:43:28] morning we're in a wonderful place
[1:43:32] Church portions of God sitting here this
[1:43:35] morning brother Chad do you know you're
[1:43:37] a portion of God Amen a portion of God
[1:43:42] if you have received the Holy Spirit a
[1:43:44] portion of God resides inside of you I
[1:43:48] say God let that come out every day a
[1:43:49] little more amen a lot more why limit
[1:43:52] him why limit him
[1:43:54] in my life Lord be glorified we're going
[1:43:56] to sing that as just after we pray
[1:43:59] sister morber if you play that softly
[1:44:01] let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:44:06] Father Lord how can mortal mind
[1:44:10] grasp the reality of a living God inside
[1:44:13] of us Lord this mind this flesh this
[1:44:16] world fights against that thought and
[1:44:18] that idea Lord we can't even comprehend
[1:44:21] what it means but yet Lord it is the
[1:44:23] great mystery being revealed the
[1:44:26] Fulfillment of all scriptures comes down
[1:44:28] to Christ in us the hope of glory Lord
[1:44:31] and your word says that it's given in
[1:44:32] Earth and vessels that the Excellency
[1:44:34] may be of you and not of
[1:44:35] us Lord I pray you help us to focus on
[1:44:38] the you part rather than the
[1:44:40] US Lord that in our lives Lord we fail I
[1:44:44] fail every
[1:44:46] day Lord but we're looking to the
[1:44:48] Perfection that resides within us Lord
[1:44:51] we're looking to be led
[1:44:54] Lord we're looking to follow you where
[1:44:55] you would have us to go to do what you'd
[1:44:58] have us to do to say what you'd have us
[1:44:59] to say Lord to be still when you'd have
[1:45:01] us to be still and in all things Lord to
[1:45:04] wait on you with faith and
[1:45:06] patience Lord I pray you give us a
[1:45:09] greater reality every
[1:45:10] day Lord that it's God in us
[1:45:13] now Lord you didn't just come 2,000
[1:45:16] years ago and then go away Lord but you
[1:45:18] came back and you're a comfort to us day
[1:45:20] by day
[1:45:23] Lord I pray you be a comfort this
[1:45:25] morning those that are sick those that
[1:45:27] are
[1:45:28] needy Lord there's many needs before
[1:45:32] us Lord I pray that
[1:45:35] God that's in each one will move Lord to
[1:45:39] heal to deliver to save to
[1:45:42] conquer to encourage to support to love
[1:45:46] Lord you see every need we
