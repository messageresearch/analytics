that are present here and those that are online maybe those that are on the internet lured those that are around the world the grace of God Lord because we're coming down to the place of the challenge of our faith believe us now this a man that the resurrection and the rapture is in us a man Alvis sabili a man Elvis to claim the promise for the glory of God we ask it in the name of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen to God be the glory hallelujah thank you Jesus now I believe all things are possible yeah [Music] No [Music] Oh [Music] Amen praise the Lord [Music] because now I believe amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah god bless you turn with me to the Book of Daniel praise the Lord to God be the glory this go to Daniel 1 first and then I want to go to Daniel 3 in Daniel 6 as we go to into the message and trying to bring it to a conclusion today in the light of the fact that our brother Paul the fontain will be here on Friday so the grace of God be with us be in prayer amen praying the grace of God be with our brother Paul the grace of God be with us a man the minister what we have need of a man and there's not just anything not just the message when it comes to the doctrine but rather we got to focus on why God did it and and are we focusing on it the resurrection and the rapture to give us the faith that we need in this hour as God gave as I we we repeated it so often but God gave a new third the faith that he needed and the Lutheran's and the Methodists the faith that they needed for the take them through that age a man and the Pentecostals it takes him through that age but now he's thinking he's giving us a faith to go through the bright age a man by the grace of God this is tremendous let's get me on again the the ideas of loud Asiya and let's get into the bride age let's have the revelation of the bride age and brother I tell you I pray that we're going to have the bride revival and brother what is a revival how does a revival manifest itself it has a zeal and an enthusiasm for what God is doing amen that's right so it's not the past but it's the present we're caught up with what God is doing today amen what God is doing in us by the grace of God for these last song about 40 years amen so what has God accomplished in us in the last 40 years we got a comedy scene you since you were baptized you know in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ since you received acknowledge that this is God a man that is not man it is God so the grace of God brothers sister that we're going to get caught up a man in the revelation of the bride revival we're going to have the zeal and the enthusiasm of the bride revival now the Pentecostals not the others but the bride a man and brother it's the revelation that God gives us in this hour the mystery that God reveals in this hour that gives us that zeal and that enthusiasm you got you've got to have a revelation a main way what makes your zealous what what and watch the enthusiasm for a man what it what are you jealous for what are you enthused for about a man and further for the Pentecostals it was the gifts from the baptism of the Holy Ghost but for the right it's the resurrection rapture a man so buddy and brother a lot of you are still there just basically Pentecostals and and you did waiting for those waiting for that well we're into the revelation of it we're into the mystery of God revealing it a man the resurrection and the rapture to the many consoles it was up there to us it's here a man that's the truth the Pentecostals believe that the Pentecostal message was going to take them on to the resurrection rapture but they did but they never recognized what God was going to do and how God was going to do it amen the crown has that were of the Pentecostal message a man so I pray grace God help us to believe God help us to recognize what you are doing and Lord that it's going to and if we really recognize it if we really got the revelation of it and we're going to have the zeal and the enthusiasm of the bride revival a man neither zeal in the enthusiasm of Pentecost or he or even a goddess and a prophet no no now it's a it's the coming of the son of man a man is the son of man here to catch his bride away by the grace of God and that's where our zeal and enthusiasm is by the grace of God amen and all down through the word on through the scriptures all down through history the saints of God have been caught up with zeal and enthusiasm and what God was doing in their day and in their age what God had revealed to them amen that's what they were living for if that's what they died for that's what give him the faith that they needed a man so let's consider the faith that God has given us in this hour that we might truly honestly and sincerely be overcomers a man so we're going to try to bring that stat series that message to a conclusion on how can I overcome the proverb pres I said the father preached it because he knew that they needed this revelation and brother they needed it then we need it now a man by the grace of God and in the Book of Daniel this River st. and Dan but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the Kings meat you've got to determine that in your heart you gotta be led by the Holy Ghost and he said with the portion of the Kings meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the Prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself a man now he said God and brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the Prince of the eunuchs and the Prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel I fear my lord the king who has appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort and then shall he make me endanger my head to the King a man they wanted Daniel and the three but children a man to two to give up while they believed to compromise on what they believe compromise on their faith amen and that's a challenge that you and I are facing today is the compromise on our faith to compromise on what we believe compromise on what God yes has done but what God is doing by the grace of God a man is tremendous so I pray God we're gonna believe the word we're going to the message the whole truth and nothing but the truth and I just believe this doctrine that doctrine but believe all that the prophets of to get us in line for the resurrection and the rapture to get us ready for the resurrection and the rapture not just to get us out of systems but to get us into the word amen to get us into the revelation of the resurrection rapture again not like that that person has said that kneel to me beside me at that and that all four years ago all thank you Lord for bringing us out of denominations now we don't have to be serving to any man I said Lord Ashley she needs your help a man to give her a right attitude and a right spirit and to give her the revelation of what you have done and what you are doing a man to God be the glory so brother God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the princess of the eunuch and the Prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel I fear the Lord my lord the king who has appointed you meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking then the children which are of your sort a man other Jews did is they that as they were supposed to eat and drink and whatever in Babylon but Daniel in the three but children amen they maintained their stand they mean their name their faith for God and they weren't going to compromise not even for the King a man grace to us we're not going to compromise or nobody and no nothing amen we're going to stay with the Lord by the grace of God amen that's the ones that are ordained for the resurrection ordained by the rapture brother boy it takes that uncompromising attitude uncompromising spirit to get the faith for the resurrection and rapture amen if there's any compromise God cannot go all the way with you amen nor can we go all the way with God but Daniel and the three were children wanted to go all the way with God and they were not going to compromise they were going to be overcomers amen amen overcome the world overcome the flesh overcome the devil overcome the threats a man that was being given to them amen are we going to endure in this hour and in this age what they endured in Babylon a man by his tremendous well they they they were Jesus weren't Willie oh they could have went through the motions of it they could have got down and bowed down to that image read the King inmate Daniel could have do it just goes through the motions well I don't really do it but I I don't really believe it but I'll do it you know just for their sake no no one of them for God's sake God has got an preeminence in your life God have preeminence in my life amen not my will father thine be done ain't man so you got to stop thinking you got to start believing a man you got to lay inside your thoughts a man because it's the devil in your thoughts a man so let's believe the Word of God amen thus said the Lord regardless of the place we got to pay a man believe God believe the word and that's what Daniel any man that's the test why we have their testimony in this book today is because they were over commerce they overcome the world the flesh and the devil in the end up and the country they lived in in Babylon and even the even they are the rules and regulations and laws new laws that the King had laid laid out yeah you had to do this you had to do this you gotta worship this image and so on and no way they said we're gonna work for God a man they maintained their faith and he said for why should he see your face it's worse liking than the children which are of your sort those that were compromising and then showed he make me endanger my head to the king then said Daniel to melzar whom the Prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel Ananias Mishael and Azariah Azariah proved thy servants I beseech thee 10 days and let them give us pulse to eat water to drink and then that our countenance be looked upon before thee and the candidates of the children that eat of the portion of the Kings meat and as I see us deal with I servants amen praise the name of the Lord so he consented to them in this matter and he proved them ten days God is proving us a man he most definitely is proving us are we going to stay with the with the read with the written word how are we going to stay with the revealed word a man by the grace of God God is testing us God is proving us amen bringing out the resurrection and rapture in faith they made the take us off the earth and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the Kings meat amen we're going to say and eat they eat the Kings meat now we're going to be more healthy than they were than the others we're going stronger than the others we're going to have the faith that pleases God we're gonna have the greater revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen we're going to be overcomers a man and it says then mel SAR took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse and as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams amen so we're going to say with the word God's going to bless us with the revelation we need God is going to bless us with it with the encouragement that we need God is gonna bless us with the zeal and the enthusiasm that he is looking for in the bright praise the name of the Lord and it says now at the end of the days that the king of cedi should bring them in then the princess of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar and the King commune with him and among them all was found none like Daniel and Aniyah and Mishael and Azariah therefore stood they before the king and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the King inquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all Israel and Daniel continued even under the first year of King Cyrus god bless his word you may be seated and as they continued in the word they may maintain their a man their power over the world their power over the flesh and over the devil a man now in this case God did give them favor with the king but eventually they would lose that favor amen eventually God was going to bring them out and send them back to the promised land send them back to the Jerusalem the old Jerusalem a man and they would rebuild that Jerusalem they were over commerce so brother and sister God looking for that that spirit of overcoming in us in you and in me god help us amen so that we are over and then the thing you have to overcome alternative mother number one is yourself Amen man when it comes to the witness brought out here in the message how can I overcome the prophet of God also highlights the fact that you have to humble yourself it's over you know the victory overcoming it begins with humility you got a home of yourself you want to overcome then you got to humble yourself but easy but you got to humble yourself to God you're gonna owe me herself to the will of God amen not my will thine be done you're gonna home by yourself and have that same spirit and that same attitude that God had when he was in place remember he was your example and not was he is he is our example even now he was Luther's example Wesley's example the Pentecostal example other other saints of God that took their stand for him a man that they would be overcomers in their day and in their age they would overcome the world they would overcome their flesh and they would overcome the devil a man so the devil wasn't going to get victory over them that's through the influence of the world the victory wasn't going to get influence over them for the influence of their flesh a man and certainly not the devil himself be a man because like like Daniel and the three Hebrew children the they believe God they believe the Word of God they had a revelation of the word what a revelation they had to take the stand that they took brother it wasn't a knowledge in their heads but there was something that they had in their hearts or in their souls amen by the grace of Almighty God amen - for them to take the standard they took when they were faced with what the world was going to do to them what the king was going to do and what the government was in Babylon was going to do with the three bo children a man is going to throw them into a furnace of fire a man there was no hesitation a man none whatsoever why because they had the spirit of an overcomer a man and the overcomers not going to compromise the overcomers not going to do this and do that I'll do it this way I'll do that we know you've got to do it the right way a man you got to do it God's Way any man and they knew that and they had that revelation of the other of the other children of Israel that was in Babylon they never had that faith they may say I know they get straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it a man whether it's in Israel whether it's whether it's here among the Gentiles and when it comes to all those that don't believe it don't see it don't understand it Amen they're multitudes but again they're the ones that God has called and chosen Amen they're gonna be very very few in number compared to the others even as we're going to get less and less when it comes to believing God and having zeal and enthusiasm with the resurrection and rapture we're gonna be very very very few that's why there's going to be so few caught up in the rapture to meet the Lord in the air amen because why they're not nigh they turned they don't believe God sent a prophet not they don't believe that God opened the seven seals but they haven't entered into the revelation of what God has done and why God did it a man there's a reason why God did this is the reason why God did that a man and his children went forth and lived according and their lives based on why God did this why God did that what was God expecting from them amen this is what they witness from God now what is God looking for in them there we look for their God to do this God to do that and the father did he said that's not a problem he said we all want God to do this God do that God do that what are you gonna do any man for the Lord it's either my against the Bible says in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your advances a man you have to acknowledge him in all areas of your life in every every decision you got to make you're going to consult the Lord amen not my real father thine be done what is your will in this what is your will in that amen so the grace of God brother that we're going to find the will of God stay in the will of God and we're going to live out the will of God we're going to stand for the will of God a man now a when it comes to intellectual knowledge and the wisdom of man all the way I will do this you and you should do this as Satan's influence a man as Satan's influence because again brother sister or mine as the enemy to see them in the Garden of Eden and what he gave them the word but he had it or to it he's a saint he said God yeah as God said but forget the what's a man and he made them to believe that it was good he made them to believe that it was for their benefit he made him with a believe that they oh they were going to prosper they were going to be like they say they're gonna be like God or God's a man and that's the truth because the woman went in told Adam and she said yeah he said she said they it's good for food and it is pleasant to the eyes and desired to make one wise a man he was appealing to the human nature a man benign to the Holy Ghost nature nigh to their spiritual nature and the son and a daughter of Almighty God amen brother sister so we got ahead of that nature in us that nature is going to be in control that nature has gotta be our leadership a man not my wield I will Lord amen what does God feel what does God think and what would God do what would Jesus do a man a man show everybody he didn't didn't take that a man this is amazing they wouldn't believe the whole truth nothing but the truth they believe the truth but they added it but they interpreted it they they're their own ideas to it under Satan's influence a man and there are many a message believer today they're stating their own ideas to the message and to the Word of God into what God has done and what God is doing Amen it's the influence of the devil you know do this do this is good for food it's good for this is pleasant to the eyes so you go this way that's the way God wants you to go God wants you to go his way amen and to us it may not seem like good food it may not seem too pleasant to the natural man amen no not indeed and it may not it may not be with them when it because you all that now there's something wrong there but it is the wisdom of God now there is no man by the wisdom of God so what wisdom governs your life while you wisdom controls you it is your natural human wisdom or as it is the Holy Ghost wisdom a man according to the Word of God because I'm sure that they didn't think that Jesus was very wise a man but he was the King and Lord of wisdom a man but if they didn't think he was wise because of what he did and how he did and so on a man but but see again when it comes to the wisdom of God the wisdom of God is so contrary to the ways of man and so country the ways of the devil ain't man brother we've got it we got to learn to se it's faith it's revealed now God is asking you to walk in it it's revealed so God allows you to believe it God's asking you to stay with it amen the enemy is there to get us to compromise the enemy is there to get us to reason but we got a cast on reasoning amen we gotta have as I said that that perfect faith that believes and know knowing that there's no room for questions no room for doubt amen by the grace of God and as it is as where the the faith of the Jews so it was with Daniel so was with the three more children a man there's no question they had no doubt whatsoever a man the king and the others were trying to get trying to get the three Burchill under to wrestle with it and a reason and and oh you need to use some wheel you know wisdom oh you know not only goes with somebody even wisdom amen why because they when they show them the fire the fiery furnace they wound up Alamein a man and they said another well you either bow down or we will cast you down here a man there was no hesitation in their faith brother that's a dare overcomers it was so natural with them a man when it comes to that nature to believe God a man God Elvis to have that nature god help us to have that and overcome 'edit overcoming spirit a man not even listen to the flesh not listen to the devil no matter what the circumstances no matter what you're going to endure no matter what you're going to experience Lord I'll get I'll get there with your help amen you're gonna take me through you said you'd never leave me nor forsake me you'll be with me even in me to the end of the age amen so Lord it's not me that leaves us crazy I live within me amen and Lord you lay down your life you picked it up again amen so you're and you're more than a conqueror and you make us more than conquerors amen the victory that you won Lord you give it to us amen he was an overcomer and brother talk about overcoming he overcome the world all right he overcome the flesh and he overcome the devil amen and went and got the keys of death l of the grave and and brought it back amen to give it to you in me amen by the grace of Almighty God so brother I pray the grace of God we're going to be overcomers as Christ was an overcomer Annie Annie Annie came back into his elect so as to make his elect over comers that even as he overcome now we're going to overcome and again we know that it's not me it's Christ in me hey man so brother sister I trust that your life and your attitude and your spirit is going to reflect what Christ in you and it's not you this talking is not you this acting is not you that's reacting it is Christ in you a man by the grace of God showing that you are in overcomer you have overcome the world the flesh the devil and again understanding that the prophet of God preached this because he was ministering to those in his own church that were not overcomers a man and as it was with Eve so it was with a number in his own church though it was good too good for food the ice thing to be desired to make one wise and so on and they were being caught up with those things and they were getting away from the zeal and the enthusiasm of the relevant word a man see brother/sister that as long as the problem was there with the first and the second Pole they were enthusiastic oh they were zealous they were imposed a man over the ministry of the prophet of god amen amen but again it gives a reason and since get the people to believe by those signs are only their attention ain't man and once they got their attention he would go to the third Pole the word a man bring out bring out what was really in them do they believe the word amen do they really believe it brother for the angel said now brother around stop using those signs because they're leaning on a sign folks and again a lot of a lot of those that profess to believe brother Brown they were leaning on the same post and when he stopped using the signs and started to get into the word and then the word the word for the resurrection for the rapture and the emphasis on on what God was doing to get us out of here amen they were losing their zeal and their enthusiasm brother I tell you there's more zeal and enthusiasm over doctrines and today and over this idea this theology that theology than it is over the resurrection and the rapture amen oh they're still contained or we're going to believe this we believe that oh this dis doctrine is wonderful this this this doctrine is tremendous a man but what is it doing for you any man whatever what is God revealing to you through all of these things a man the very thing that God has done proves what God is doing it'll point of what God is doing a man that's why he stopped the signs and wonders so they get a bit of focus unwell well where's William Branham where's the signs and the wonders we had gone from that to the word a man even our Lord in his ministry 2000 years ago and he went from the signs and the wonders to the word a man he went to what to fulfill the scripture that he was at Ely was made flesh to fulfill and now brother and sister you and I are moving on in the world so the to fulfill the scripture that God has ordained for us to be fulfilled in a man brother and it's Mandir it's more than what Wesleyan is more than what the other said amen this is the resurrection and the rapture a man and brother just just Wesley's faith is not going to do it just the Methodist Raider the Pentecostal faith is not going to do it no way amen God had to reveal this mystery that mystery the beginning the end eternity down through time and back to eternity a man to give us the revelation of God in the beginning to give us the revelation of God in in in in time and to give us a revelation of God going back to eternity amen brother god help us said we're going to we're going to dwell and focus more and more and more on what God is doing a man in what God wants to do in your life and mine a million brother God is not it's gone beyond when it comes to doctrines and theologies for the Bride of Christ I'm talking about the bride but I'm not talking about the others are the the many of their that are called by talking about those that are chosen and that is the Bride of Christ as I mentioned I believe honestly the prophecy were not going to reach everyone with this message he said only for the bride the message is only for the bride amen that's why yeah that's why you got to have God's leadership ain't man that's why the ministry needs God's leadership they're gonna they're administered to the Bride of Christ amen Lord where do you want me to go where do you want me to go where where is the Lord and who do you want me minister to a man brother I pray there anyone that needs God's leadership it's the ministry a man - no - no we're we're guy wants from the minister to know who who he wants him to minister to a man and his men and again thank God brother he's not here yo we got to tell them the message tell them about the message tell them about the message no ask God to play the leadership nor what do you want me to do where who do you want me to do it with and what do you want me to witness - amen brother sister lugar you go live the life if you want to be a witness to them let your life be the witness a man but when it comes to getting into this doctrine this doctor of that doctrine brother it's hoarding and destinated for the bride a man-god for a dame the revelation of the mystery of God amen the only of the seven seals before day those Saints whether that's the trumpets a man is for ordained for the bride for the resurrection for the rapture for the Lord Himself said descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen amen brother as a man it's the elect it seems like when Jesus came the first time any-any when he laid down his life and he picked it up again in resurrection power amen the Bible says that not not all not all the data they are under under the Old Covenant not all of them raised amen no but it says many many of them many of the graves opened up and they came forth and went into the city and appeared unto many a man many of them but not all of them for there any gains of singing with the rapture brothers a bride has gone into rapture but not all that not all so-called Christians not all so-called believers a man because the Bible said you were a one oneness prophecy there concerning what was going to happen and the dating Christ was going to witness a man the dead are going to witness the union of the bride and the bridegroom the the early bride in the heavenly bridegroom a man but it says and the rest of the day they have not again for a thousand years a man praise the name of the Lord do not lost no way praise the name of the Lord because even in the judgment are given white robes praise the name of the Lord and says go this way go this way and brother who's there in the German is the bridegroom and the bride a man and right in the last book of the Bible says in the spirit and the bride a man will praise the Lord what a position she's in the spirit of the bride say come amen and drink of the water of life freely but he's somebody but again the warning is there don't add to don't take away a man stay with the word for the old god help us Lord to believe that was man-boy water what a position to be in brother listen ashore our loaf of the Lord let sure our thankfulness to the Lord a man for bringing us to that place a man for making us the bride happy no sir said with him in in his throat and again to highlight the promise and not on the throne but in the throne a man and as it is in the word by the grace of God amen because you're going to judge by the word amen because the Bible said the book was open and the books were opened and again the prophet Agartha what is the book it is the Word of God it is the book of life the Word of God and the books he said are the books of the life of the individuals that are being judged amen to what extent does their life let measure up and line up with what's in the book a man there there are those that didn't light up at all amen and then they're cast into the lake of fire and they should have their part or their time in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone but again there are others a man that Ana testimony that please God and they're given white robes to enter into glory amen they're going to be there ain't made by the grace of Almighty God again is a prophecy Julie surprise who made it and who did not make it ain't man let's make sure our colony election sure let's make sure that we're making it a man and that we are going before all the rest amen the Gentile bride is going before the rest a man we know the dead in Christ are going to arise first and then we're going to come up with anything to meet the Lord in the air a man just think the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive remain Amen but notice what's involved in the resurrection what's involved in the rapture amen and he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen the lord has descended with a shout and he said the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God amen brother it was to get the attention of the bride he was to give the bride the faith that she needed and the revelation she needed to know what God was doing amen to know that they are the resurrection was upon us they are their answer is upon us amen old brother sister where are we are closer we to the resurrection how close are we to the rapture how close are we to the change amen are we caught up more with that that revelation than we are with the rest of the religion the rest of the message we got to be cut out with this it when I caught up with a revelation of the resurrection the rapture then we're not going to be caught up in the resurrection rapture hey man we got to come up with that revelation amen and the dead in Christ shall rise first and there then he said we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore he said comfort one another with these words covered one another with the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen and not just the comfort one another with this doctrine or that diverter there's one of that one no with the revelation of the resurrection of rapture amen God did what he did amen to bring forth the revelation of a resurrection God did what he did to give us a read the faith of the resurrection and the rapture amen nadiak along with with is like pentecost or was what they had and was and so on but what God has done for us in this hour this age Amen brother again that's why many walked away from the Prophet because he was moving from signs and wonders he was moving to the revealed word he was moving to the sign of the Resurrection moving to the sign of the rapture Amen praise the name of the Lord so god help us brother he's my prayer that has over Commerce overcoming the world the flesh the devil overcoming the influence of all these things amen the greatest angles in our life is the resurrection rapture amen you can't you can't stop thinking about anything else only the resurrection rapture that's what God wants you to think about that's what he wants you to meditate on think on these things think on these think on these things amen brother evening he sends a revelation amen and that day you'll know this and day you'll know that amen I mean the father the father of me I in you and you and me a man that absolute oneness of the bride and the bridegroom by the grace of God amen the Gentile bride and our heavenly bridegroom our Lord Jesus Christ amen God Elvis brother it were overcomers the world is not going to influence us we have overcome the world and the flesh online and I think they had but they haven't because the flesh controls them amen the wisdom of the flesh controls them the knowledge of the blessed controls them saying is there two years the focus on the natural the natural the natural all God is going to do this God's going to do that we're brother God's going to curse that this robe of flesh all dropping right and sees the everlasting price amen don't focus on that no no you know start focusing on the spiritual amen if you got the Holy Ghost and you got a Holy Ghost revelation you will focus on the spiritual I mean you're not living for this world you're living for the world to come god help our our young people here amen that it they'll get into the word they won't be able to get away from it brother amen they won't we'll get away from the revelation because it's been preached preach preach preach preach a man and brother wasn't one for to get the people to line up lay up to get ready for the resurrection to get ready for the rapture Amen brother you got to let go let God have his way so you're not living like the rest of the people you're living like Jesus totally separated onto the will of God oh yes you may have to fight it like he did like he did and get some money you felt it but then you're you humble yourself the Bible says an angel came and ministered to them an angel came to strengthen him praise the Lord Amen all of what was going on then brother sister that Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane as I said is the same as were sleeping by the angel was in another dimension brother he was he was blending between two dimensions a man he had to be for an angel come down and the angel came to strengthen it amen knowing what he was going through who the angel was we're not told but a by the name I pray grace amen there are dangerous with us that there's ain't yester there too with us a man if there's anyone that needs the angels of God a man the Bible says the angels of God in camp around about those that fear God ain't mad night and day the angels of God are there by the grace of God a man that's why when when we have devotion we pray lord your grace of your presence with us the grace of your president and the grace of your angels around us amen to protect us amen by the grace of Almighty God a man to make a man so that we are overcomers by the grace of God amen turn with me to Daniel chapter 3 praise the name of the Lord Daniel 3 and verse 14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them it is true OSHA track this Shack and Abednego do not ye serve my God's nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if he be ready that at what time he hear the sound of the cornet we're listening for the trumpet or the flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of music ye fall down and worship the image which I have made and he said well but if he worship not he shall be cast that same hour he said into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands Amen so they were they were the king was asking them the worship the image that he had set up and he said you don't do it he said we're going to cash you into the fiery furnace a man but Shadrach Meshach Abednego answered and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so they weren't gonna compromise no way no way not even though he was look at the King a man the king of Babylon they weren't going to compromise with him they weren't going to all just have a nice conversation with the king no they're going to stay with the truth amen and he said if it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace amen brother the fire of God is falling on the earth amen so we pray the grace of God that he's here to deliver us from this fiery furnace amen into a resurrection and ramcharan glory amen the proof that we are overcomers amen brother is either the devil overcoming off so we overcome the devil that's right and it says he will deliver us out of thine hand O king but if not be it known unto thee O king that we shall we will not serve thy God's nor worship the golden image which thou has set up a man they were overcomers amen and Nebuchadnezzar challenged for them to worship though they they the image brother it was a broader I brought out their overcoming power their brother their overcoming testimony amen brother no matter what the test if you're an overcomer you're going to speak as an overcomer you're going to act as an overcomer hey babe you're going to live as an overcomer amen amen amen hallelujah Oh Lord Grace and then was nebuchadnezzar he said full of fury and the form of his message was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and therefore he speak commander that they should eat the furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated oh yeah devil's gonna make it worse for you but God allow it to bring out all hallelujah Oh hallelujah hallelujah amen but there's one thing to compromise because of what's said but brothers nothing to compromise on the reality of the furnace getting hotter and not only that they went show them the furnace and so on and of course when they do when they when they went and cast them in those that cast him indict that the first was so hot a man a man a man brother what a testimony brother what a witness of an overcomer oh brother they overcame all thoughts and all ideas and the wisdom of man they never considered it no no way could the devil get it into their mind no way could the devil get it into their feelings and their senses no they brother they were over covers they believed God a man they were going to stay with God regardless of the sense regardless of all the rest of these rule bowing down to the image a man all the other Jews were worshipping the image worshiping the items but brother Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they were no no no never had never never even considered it no way Amen yes and then that's not being an overcomer he could be coming to overcome her that is being in overcoming a man not fighting this to fighting this to be an overcomer no they were overcomers a man that's why they did what they did that's why they testified the way they testified a man because they were overcomers there was no question there was no doubt we're not even gonna consider it what you listen there's the fiery furnace yeah you should think again no they don't think twice no the thoughts of God were in their heart and in their soul in their mining man then they were considered the devil's thoughts think about that and yet there's believers they considered the devil's thoughts Satan listen to mine and uh stop them think about don't come back to the word I'll tear this brother if you got the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's just automatic very bad brother no matter what the enemy saves no matter what the enemy does right away what was the Russell reason for reflection coming out of you amen what's the response it's the response of Christ in you amen see you're dead to Christ dead to the world rather I'm gonna live on to Christ and now it's Christ that liveth in me willing to do of his good pleasure now you go out its Christ you go home in is Christ you do this it's Christ in you amen a man a man a man pray easing control and brother you step out of the way just a little bit you stood by the way you convict you I pray grace but I tell you if you got oh if you're an overcomer you got the revelation of that conviction you know it is a Mary if it was lining you up with the word you know what's gone everybody if he's gonna give you the word and he and explained this explained that no that's the devil we don't need no explaining we just need to believe oh gotta explain this explain this no just believe what do you said praise the Lord Oh God's grace that we be overcomers as Daniel and the three Hebrew children no question no doubt never considered at all they only they were completely controlled by faith amen by the grace of God and in verse 20 he said he commanded the most mighty men that were in the army to bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego into Casson into the burning fiery furnace then these men were bound in their coats their ocean and their hats and their other garments and they were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace brother closely got the hotter it was but they but they didn't get cold in their experience with God hey man they didn't Oh maybe we should maybe we should just bow for a little bit no not gonna do it con throws in if we come out fine if we don't to God be the glory amen oh this is successful fine but it is not to God be the glory amen praise the name of the Lord we think is God God's gonna bless us bless us bless us bless is enough sometimes God withholds the blessing to bring out your faith amen believe us though this amen and it says therefore because the Kings commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace what were they expecting amen what do they feel when they landed what do you feel when you Lane amen sometimes the world will throw us into a fiery furnace they'll throw us into this cross into that they're trying to make things harder for us because they are staying for the truth amen oh yeah we all we all do is we're into a lion's den like Daniel we're into a fiery furnace like the cerebral children and it's bringing it our faith I really we're just trusting God in here praise the Lord amen and it says and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down into the midst of the fire burning fiery furnace and then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in ace and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the Kings rule king he as I said lo I see four in he said a loose yeah they were about the devil I bind you God set you free to continue in his word amen and he said we're walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth man is like the Son of God Oh hallelujah amen in your testimony in your sacrifice are they going to see the reflection of Jesus in you Abe a reflection of a question a Holy Ghost filled Christian in you amen so it's not you know you got a you guys in another power in you you got another anointing in you Jesus in you he was with them in the fiery furnace oh my I'll deal with the Prophet or someone was preaching sand and God was in heaven watching it and he said okay he said get me a chariot he's on going down he said with the children I'm going down with those three eighty bruised hey man I'm going into that firing furnace hey man so he got on a chair and the angels come on brought him right down a man to Babylon probably God said yeah and he air air he jumps headed to carry it and into the fire into the furnace hey man this is why Nebuchadnezzar I didn't see three he saw four a man brother I pray the grace of God that they don't just see you they see there's another anointing there's somebody with you by the grace of Almighty God Oh hallelujah amen you never leave you nor forsake you amen he proved it to me shocked shocked and Abednego everybody I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he didn't leave him and he didn't presume amen amen no matter what you're tested without you're tested he won't need you please call on the Lord call on the Lord he said call and I'll answer your fine knock it'll be open oh the three butterman did that and they found ya they called it was open knocked it was open they were seeking they found him a man they thought they were find him maybe in death but no it was life oh that was eternal life oh yeah be in that furnace of fire where those that were thrown through the main died they didn't die in the fire they died outside where was so hot a man but Aires there's these three evil children going down into the fire and did landed stood up hmm there was the fourth one oh my brother talked about overcomers that's an overcomer hey man no matter no matter what the challenge of the devil is we are overcomers amen brother and then Nebuchadnezzar verse 26 near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace speak and said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego your servants of the Most High God come forth come in and then Shadrach Michigan the second Abednego came forth of the midst of the fire amen and the princes governors and captains and the Kings counselors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power hallelujah brother a weary we are overcomers within any of the Holy Ghost Christ a TAS the world got no power over no no matter what the devil is gonna do it they're not going to affect us it's what God has done it's got the greatest influence over us amen what God is doing got the greatest influence over me please understand yeah and our young people here understand the world was becoming a fiery furnace yeah the world oh yeah well the round said God's going to burn it from the inside out and he's gonna throw the earth into the Sun and you know I don't know if you noticed it on internet news or something what's going on concerning the climate change and concerns how people are concerned because of the climate change yeah more and more concerned and and they're they're worried over it what's going on whether the whole world is changing politics is changing governments are changing everything everything is changing as it was in the days of Noah so shall be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man and the power of God highlights it in this message the flashing red light of his coming he said what was it like in the days of Noah he said that's what it's like now maybe highlight that some time for you yeah the flashing red light of his coming June 1963 and he and he explains as it was in the days of Noah what they did now he said they're doing the same now yeah and all the respect but he highlights the influence of the women yeah he said that's what happened in the days of Noah he said the sons of God saw the daughters of man he said Cain's seed and he said they took unto themselves those women now says they took under the Sun wives but he said the original is women he said common-law relationships as it was then so it is now what would brother Brown say today there was common all relationships back then but there's most now and he's and what day and what did it what was it influence that on God it's it grieved him that the sons of God would see the daughters of man and go after them as Cates a Cain seed he said now we're living in that day now as it was in the days of no so it isn't this day and that's what he explains here in this book the flashing red light of is coming he said my it's over with it's finished now we see he said that that these signs are testifying of becoming a battle of the Lord and one of the big signs in the days of Noah again is common-law relationships amen and people are taking it so lightly oh yeah common-law relations did don't matter no more again I've took my stand on that even within my own family and so on no wait yeah and there's a time there a certain relative of mine and common law you're gonna get married married in a church I said I won't be there all due respect I said but we won't be there but he never held it against us no no so we didn't go though it was a close relative at the time he would have nothing to do with it amen so brother how many are gonna take their stand like the three will children how many gonna take their stand like Daniel take their stand like the others down through the ages say again what happened to Moses when God stopped dealing with Moses it's because he brought his father out of the land with him Todd told him to leave lead them all behind but he brought his father out and he says and he he was in the desert there outside the promised land and God never spoke to him for five years after five years his father died then the Lord came and spoke to Abraham again yeah sometimes you can do things brother and God won't talk to you God won't deal with you gotta move away from you oh yeah Lord why did why this why that why I'm waiting for you to separate under the Lord and yet as I told you before there's even even a message believer was telling me regarding common-law relationships always said that's there's nothing wrong with that he said that you're still husband and wife no no that grieves grieves God and God's water God say when when the sons of God did that he said my spirit will not always strive with man yeah poverty God brings it out he's a sea he said because they did it the Spirit of God ceased to strive and judgment came but Aaron there's too many believers brother justifying common-law relationships you know why they're more they're more caught up with this natural life than they are spiritual more cut out with themselves and the natural things than they are Christ and the spiritual amen you got to take your stand grace rather the princess and the governor saw these men upon whom the bodies of fire had no power and was an air of there is neither was there an air of their head sings neither was their coach change nor the smell of fire had passed on them hmm they were totally separated they were absolute overcomers absolute overcomers but it had that fire if I had absolutely no influence on brother just think of that they were so such overcomers no influence even like Daniel in the lion's den that the Lions would just moved away why they had no influence over Daniel Daniel had the influence over them okay Daniel was the overcomer and when they threatened Daniel and he because he was praying to God he opened the window any-any faced Jerusalem and he prayed treati three times a day and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed and and the officers from the king there oh they saw him and they wouldn't report to the king and he was told told to throw him into the fire into the lion's den but Daniel was an overcomer he was not change are we overcomers like Daniel and the three Hebrew children to the extent overcoming to the extent that we take our stand as they did faced the challenge that they face I tended not many believers taking this day they take their stand for a doctrine but not for the life of Christ no this doctrine this doctrine is doctor baptism Trinity so on but they want to inter stand for Christ in everyday living kada Alvis and it says then Nebuchadnezzar speakin say blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego who has sent His angels and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God amen therefore I make a decree that every people nation language which speak anything amiss against the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort no indeed and there's no other God that can deliver us with the resurrection in the rapture amen it's our Lord Jesus Christ let me read you one more scripture there in daniel 6 daniel 6 and verse 16 then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast them into the den of lions now the King spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou service continually he will deliver thee and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the King seal it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel then the King well probably refer to having friends of the right this one was a friend of Daniel's - as long as far as they could go as king and then the King went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of music brought before him and his sleep went from him and then the King rose early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions and when he came to the day and he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel and the King spake and said to Daniel Daniel he's a servant of the living is my god him though service continually able to deliver thee from the Lions a man then said Daniel onto the King okay and live forever hey man is that to his right and his spirit was right keep your attitude right keep your spirit right everybody if you're an overcomer you'll always have a right attitude in the right spirit my god he said as cent is angel and as shut the Lions mouths a man as God sent his angel to you to shut the devil's mouth amen and he said that they have not heard me for as much as before him innocence he was found in me and also before thee O king have I done no hurt then was the King exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the LA den so Daniel was taken up out of the den and no matter heard was found upon him because he believed in his God he was an overcomer he believed completely sincerely absolutely and the King took those that cast annua in the king went and got them and their families and cast in me god help us we need to plead the token life of the blood of Jesus for family and friends and neighbors yeah Daniel and the three would sure when we're under under the Covenant the Old Covenant of the law but they love God and they serve God and they were overcomers amen but after Daniel come out of the lion's den he may praise the Lord it wasn't like those that we saw on the film here the other night those two that went to Africa and called the lion that they raised oh yeah Daniel had no relationship with these lions but those two gentlemen there I think from America raised that lion but after a while to get back to Africa and of course they go every year and they go through the wilderness and call the name of the lion and the lion would come to them and we saw the lion jumping up on them and hugging them and maybe licking them yeah like a regular dog or a cat a man yeah cuz the the lion knew them a man they knew the lion oh brother what a relationship of course the lion is gone now so they assumed maybe he died or someone killed it because they can't they can't find it anymore hey man brother sister I pray that we have such a relationship with God amen that we are more than conquerors by the grace of God amen or there's so much more can be said concerning the lions remember the fourth beast in Revelation was like unto a lion amen by the grace of God so brother it says again verse 23 then was the King exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den so Daniel was taken up out of the den no matter no matter of hurt was found upon him because he believed in is God do we believe in our God and that brother the blessings that were experiencing that is not us it's God then if we never if we weren't overcomers and we had given ourselves to the Lord we would not experience these things grace of God that as he was with the three Hebrew children brought him out of the fiery furnace they weren't even burnt their clothes wasn't scorched nothing Daniel out of the Lions Den no problem grace and again a tremendous challenge to us through if you wanted to hear that tape sometime earlier that message the flashing red light of his right blight of the sign obvious coming June 23rd 63 in the message how can I overcome was in the church that are the influence of the world and the things of the world yeah they were still under the influence of denominations and had denominational spirits as I said this is tremendous you think if they're under the ministry of the proper for so long that they would have believed the prophets day with the prophet and humbled themselves know that like I said when he preached church order after he preached search order a number of people left that church and they went and joined brother junior Jacksons church you know left Branham Tabernacle yes they left downtown Michael why because he had laid out the rules concerning the gifts he elated the rules concerning testimonies and so on yeah and they didn't agree with it just think you think if they believe them to be a prophet they would have stayed they would have sacrificed they would have they would have prayed not my will father time be done no and I don't doubt but after he preached this message others left Ram tabernacle you can accept the doctrine what about the life that's something else Nord you can teach me this and teach me that but you don't have control of my life no I want to do this I want to do that no you've got to lay down your life for him as he lay down his life for you the problem of God I think we concluded here on this in the previous service he said overcome he said means to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks amen don't let the devil trick you oh yes that's how he gets as though he gets to deceive believers he'll trick them into thinking what he's saying is all right and that God don't mind it so overcome means to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks and a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that he said there is a real devil and he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know that he's a devil and overcome you must recognize that God the God in you is greater and mightier than the devil that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by His grace you're more than a match for the devil amen he said that these are there is real overcoming but he should remember greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he is in you and you overcome your overcome by him amen Christ in us the hope of glory amen he said in a man that's in Christ knows that he's overcome the things of the world amen it has no more ties to you at all your free walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin we have fellowship with one another forever there you are he that is in you greater Z than is it than he that is in the world and if you look back you're condemned look forward don't look back amen we got to look forward press on to the resurrection and rapture and he said I feel like a shouting Christian what was in there by God at the beginning it pressed its way through it overcome you know overcome the mud it overcome the waters and overcome everything and was over an overcomer and reflected the beauty and the glory of God amen that's the way every believer does that's the way that Noah did that's the way that lot did that look what a mess II was in that's the way Moses did that's the way Joshua did that's the way Daniel did that's the way Shadrach Meshach and Abednego did that's the way John the Baptist did Zacharias Elizabeth that's the way that Simon that's the way that Anna did every one of them they overcome the mud that was there was around them and packed into them and they stuck their head above the thing and shine forth the glory of God that's what a real Christian does you will reflect the glory of God he said look he showed us how it's done how did he do it by the word and that's how he done it was he was the word and Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you're back the word again the word of promise he said how do I overcome not me but the word that's in me the word is God and then I overcome the things of the world it's the word in me amen praise God he said in 40 days of temptation Satan made three major assaults upon Jesus in that temptation watch it's always in them trees but Jesus met those temptations with the word it is written a man but see how the devil gets the devil wants you to mine him and Satan also used what it's written and he say to Jesus he'll give the Angels Church to protect you but Jesus wasn't an attempt the father to do this or that just to please the devil no no no he said though he could have done it he never paid heed to Satan's propositions understand now we're dealing with two spirits Spirit of God spared the devil amen and as two probably won't be on your guard because the Prophet said they are twins in the same church it's amazing let's make sure you're following God's leadership not the devil Christ not the Antichrist yeah now here's a good thing see sometimes Satan can take you and when you think that you're doing the will of God and can make you a proposition and you'll fall for it yes sir he sure can now let's take for instance like our sisters and he said they're pretty and he can get you to a place that you let your hair grow out and you didn't realize it he said looks so nice on you and the first thing you know you get kind of feeling a little stuck up and a little above something else some of you main you know what I mean see you can take what that same thing and proposition it with you and so that's right you've got to overcome that just remember you're living for God and he said you had one objective and that's Jesus Christ outside of that there's nothing else counts except him he said there secondly for your family then thirdly for yourself but first God and Nick's for your family next for you you're number three that's the end of the road you put yourself last amen this is tremendous well the problem of God is instructing members of his own assembly what to do as overcomers and what they'll do if they are overcomers why because he was recognizing that many of them had not overcome self and the influence of the devil on cell he said though Jesus could have done this or that he never listened to Satan's proposition amen Satan was tempting Jesus to show off his power and he would be ashore and now the how does it hit God's servants to be show off to show what you can do no no servant of God is gonna be a shore he wants to give the glory to God he said no true servant of God ever does that you see a man show off his chest stuck out and all like that just remember there's something wrong there no servant of God is a show-off to himself and he said you remember when Moses did that and he said God give him power to do whatever he wanted to do and made him a prophet he walked down to that rock and he smote the rock the second time that was against God's will God said speak to the rock don't smite it again he said you'll break all the type ear so Moses went down and smote the rock he said come forth it didn't come forth so he smote it again and say come for they command you to come forth and the waters come and God said come up here he said you're glorified self you took my power instead of sanctifying me you sanctified yourself and not a preacher's take the glory to themselves oh yeah they're looking for that attention let's give him the attention now look for attention here for yourself give God the attention Amen I believe that they've this preacher get popular and this one is popular that one's popular that's the devil that's not God they're giving that they're taking the glory under themselves but not on to the Lord Amen if you're going to give the glory to God you're going to humble and anybody give you a good word oh that's alright there's just the grace of God in my life I've just served the Lord yeah you humble yourself to give him preeminence oh yeah Jesus said it's written don't tempt the LORD thy God amen are we willing this morning to take the route that Jesus took are we willing to die I'm willing to give up ourselves to God and forfeit all the world and the things for him to serve for him he should overcome the thing and how do you overcome he said by the word and what the word says you do it walk humble and live before Jesus brother I pray grace God give us Holy Ghost humility I led the finish again to me that the understanding that the Prophet is teaching his own people that they need to be overcomers and to be what God wants you to be you got to overcome self first so then it's not you that lives as Christ never didn't you you're not influenced by what's going on out there you're not influenced by other churches not influenced by other others other people no no you're controlled by the Lord and he said we're sometimes tempted to go back many of you just think he's talking to his own church tempted to go back to denominations he's attempted to go back to denominations go back and take up because all the world is saying what denomination you belong to what church are you affiliated with we're tempted to do that and all of us but our sisters are tempted to go back and join up some of the rest of the churches with the Assemblies or the Churches of God or some of them still be Pentecostal and let your hair cut off and dress just about any way you want to see you're tempted to do that go back and be popular with this wicked generation that we're living in yeah there's a lot of believers that are tempted and they're falling to the temptation just to be like the world again you know they want it it pleases them but doesn't please God yeah and he said let your hair cut off the dress just about any way you want to you're attempted to do that and go back and be popular with this wicked generation that we're living with see when this is the major sin of our day the major sin among our people is worldliness and I'm seeing a lot of more and more worldliness come among believers yeah they're not overcomers no no and he says the Bible said the loudest CNAs she's worldly rich need of nothing don't know that she's naked miserable Richard blind he said that's the sin of our day when you hear the word of God come out against it and call it against it then he said you take the other route he said you're unpopular with the world you are tempted to go back I know you keep saying to me he said I know you get tired of me harping on those things I get tired seeing you do it and he said this sin that I'm trying to tell you about say what are you harping on it for he said stop doing it then and he said trying to save your life by the word I get tired also so just straighten up this is a sin and you shouldn't be done yes sir if we are to overcome these things we expect to be tempted by them the world and if you love the world the things of the world the love of God is not in you a man so he said we'll just close in saying this there's a reward for the overcomer amen he was challenging his own people challenging believers a man he should look at yourself and see examine yourself in the spiritual looking-glass and see if you have overcome see if you've overcome yourself amen God's grace to us it's a challenge Lord to - to every every believer your including the ministry amen by the grace of Almighty God he said there's a reward for overcomers and he said press on he said like the lilies if it's in you lay aside the mud and everything else and pressed towards the top amen don't consider the mud around you press onto the top by the grace of God man and a man he said he overcome what the neighbors had to say he overcome what the church members Bildad and all them had to say he overcome the bishop and what he had to say he overcome the Cardinal and what he had to say he overcome the denomination and what they had to say and he stayed with the justification of the word a man yet it cost him everything he had even his children and he scraped the boils with a piece of crop setting on ashes yet job overcome and he did he overcome to the extent that God said told thee is he so called comforters he said make a sacrifice get job to offer it for you get job to pray amen praise the Lord I preached out that one time in some years ago now in improv I believe four approaches to the message yeah what are the four approaches to the message wells to three comforters that Jesus that came to Judas and one had this EEE bases his argument on this another one based it on that another one based it on that but then the other one came what was his name Eli Oh thank you sister Brenda did I she's fulfilling her calling amen that's where Eli you came and he did he didn't do it personally he punted Jesus to to God yeah he said always said Joe what have you done you've justified yourself he said what what about God a man and he was the mediator between Joel and God a man but joe by that faith I know my redeemer liveth and amen Oh God said where were you job when I laid the foundation of the earth Joe knew that he was there when the sons of God and the money stars is all Satan together we were there yeah and all and he got to the thought so humble that he he bowed himself down before the Lord and he wouldn't say anything why forgive me Lord forgive me he humbled himself you got a humble yourself we got to humble ourselves sister Rogers remember I preach that at busty funeral see how that II wear away the stone and out of these things all the way along hide me in the grave keep me in the secret place he kept on pressing and he said I wish I know I wish I know where I could go to to a man that could put his hands on me a holy God and talk to him for me a man he searched through his search he couldn't find such a person and all a once the clouds rolled back and he saw that person coming whole his heart beat with joy then something happened I know my Redeemer liveth God wants to bring out the confession of an overcomer and though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see God whom I shall see for myself and he'll stand on the earth in the last days amen grace grace he that overcomes all these worldly things of this age what will they do all will sit with him in his throne and will go in the rapture when he comes the rapture is for overcomers amen so you overcome all the worldliness you're not influenced by it we're going to sit with him in his throne and we'll go in the rapture when he comes we're gonna sit with him in it strong it is the throne of the revealed word and it is judgment God is judging the world through the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride oh yes the spirit judgment is in the bride amen grace to us brother sister that we're going to truly sincerely and honestly be overcomers overcoming ourselves first amen overcoming the influence of the devil amen God will take control of the rest Lord bless you God give you the faith of an overcomer Amen this day a man be in prayer that God will give you the spirit of the overcomer by the grace of God and being

of course and the other needs mentioned and just remind you to pray for for Daniel today as he goes through the baptism and adam said that he was really under a lot of conviction and he was really resisting but once he made the decision to give his heart to God and saying a real peace came over him and he's been like that ever since and so I just thank the Lord and I believe it's gone and I
