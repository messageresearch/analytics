we need the covering by the grace of God so the Lord bless you I bring greetings from our brother Doug and sister Berta Gayle amen amen they again in western Newfoundland of course his brother Doug's sister Beverly and also our sister and Edna gay brother clods wife in the home there and she's doing well even that even at her age and she's always been an active person amen and alerting the might so we break out there sir but in talking to sister Beverly today I was advised that a gentleman that some of us know but not all that's a brother George he HEA th and the heath family some full force from said western Newfoundland and I've ministered to them many years ago in where was it Hampton yeah in brother at the time it was brother Bruce Parsons Church of course that church is not there now but I did minister to many in the in the Heath family most of them now of course are moved to the mainland and gone but I was advised that one of the heat members has moved back or her I guess it's a late lady and her husband but she also had to bring back her brother and that was uh that was brother George brother George Heath and of course he was in a home in New Brunswick but now they've bought him back and he's in the same home that sister Edna is in in dearly and of course we understand that it's not because of his age but it's because of his problem mentally and so on so we pray the grace of God to him in the home in Deer Lake a man and also we prayed the grace of God to a Pentecostal brother that maybe won't mention his name but I understand that he's restricted now from ministry in in the seniors on there because of course he's taken such a strong stand for the Christian walk in the Christian life so I pray God bless Lester brother and I'm sure that if I mention his name you would know him because he assisted us with brother clouds funeral he sang specials there and so on and he cuz he does sing and he does play music so we appreciate his help there and he there was just a right spirit a right attitude he was there and him when we had the funeral service and he traveled with us all the way from dearly to Bishop Falls and was there a man as we committed our brother body back to the back to the earth so we pray God bless him as he continues to take his stand for the Lord a man so and I think it's because he's so strong in even what he says and how he says that this is why I think they just don't want that a man this it's the world in general that's looking for looking for the ministry to compromise looking for the ministry not not to be so hard but just just just preach basic Christianity you know and that you know and basic Christianity is just all just talk about Jesus what he did and you got to receive him and so on but you're not allowed to put the emphasis on the life a man to go and live live the life take your stand for the gospel take your stand for the truth take your stand for the Lord and so on so brother sister cousin oh yeah it's going to get to the place where we won't be allowed to preach those things and even even though it's online right now and on the internet we won't be allowed to say this won't be allowed to say that so we just have to cut cut the internet off a man so the grace of God to help us that we're going to stay with the word amen and also to bring greetings from brother Karsan and sister Sharon but the Carson called on Monday and I did inform you by email that brother Carson he informed me of the passing of brother Roy king's son of course brother Roy King died many years ago and and he has been in in in our services on tops of road there him and his wife and not long after he was here in in our services on tops of Road that that he died and on Sunday is by his son David King it was found in summer and Alberta I don't know where someone Alberta and he was dead so I would say he was in his early 50s and not not very old so we pray grace of God to the family that's mourning the loss of our brother David amen God's grace to him amen and also to express and I trust that maybe most of us have seen it and as sister Alanis testimony on the YouTube and I'm testimony of her Healy well through God be the glory a man thank the Lord brother the prophesy of you can't believe in healing for healing is you won't believe for the rapture oh yeah so we better be on our garden on our toes and claim

chapter 13 you can remember again of course brother Karsan sister Sharon in prayer because our brothers will be moving from where he is presently in Ontario and he's got work in another part of Ontario and so I've been moving from brother John Simon's Church to another church and I understand he said he was to move two and a half hours away from where he is right now so we pray the grace of God to be with him and of course he's having fellowship I think maybe in near that church he's having fellowship with sister Vera Moulton and originally she's from pure Newfoundland and of course her husband it was was died some many years ago and he was buried there in in in Buren area in Newfoundland and well of course myself sister Betty visit it is his grave you grieve a number of times and but sister Vera she was in the message and she moved to New Brunswick first with her son Marie and but now of course she's in Ontario and in a home in Ontario as far as I know so we pray God bless sister Vera and brother Carson did take a picture of her on Monday well and while he was fellowshiping with her and another sister there and and sent us so and of course she's still an active sister even in her old age so god bless sister Vera a man and God blessed a fellowship that she laughs with our brother Carson and sister Sharon amen so keep these issues in prayer by the grace of God and of course to to keep remembering our brother Alec in prayer and grace of God to him a man together we certainly miss his fellowship and he in st. our verse chronicles rather and chapter 13 and beginning to read at verse 1 and the issue the thoughts that we've been discussing as is a right motive and a right attitude a right objective rather right motive and a right objective is doing things the way that God wants us to do it where when a now God wants us to do it is having the right motive and the right objective and it's and the right mode basically and the right objective is all for the glory of God a man is so that is God in control of your life is God in control of of what what he wants you to do what he where he wants you to do it and how he wants you to do it amen so it's not my real father that I can be done that's a big statement to make because it just does not apply just to our spiritual lives in a sense it does because what God wants us to do it brother in the in the natural part it's going to affect our spiritual lives and our spiritual walk with the Lord and our spiritual you know experience with him relationship with him is again not my will then be done so that so that why so that I'm not doing what I want to do I'm doing what God wants me to do and I'm not doing it where I want to do it I want to do it when I want to do it I'm doing it exactly the way he wants you to do it where when and how a man it's a tremendous statement is a tremendous experience to have to be in the perfect will of God a man sir brother I pray the grace of God that we are that we have the desire we have that hunger that thirst to be in the perfect will of God so that I'm not out of the will of God I'm in the will of God whether it's a whether it's doing this or doing that whether it's saying this and saying that whether there's my association with this one on that one door regardless that is the of God so that it so that I'm not led by my my feelings and I live by my senses I'm led by the Holy Ghost sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God a mayor and brother were and if you're led by the Spirit of God it is a token it is a proof that you do your living in the spirit and you're walking in the spirit a man by the grace of Almighty God and brother it takes it takes that kind of a life it takes that kind of a walk to go you know in a right motive and a right objective so God help us is my prayer and brother if there's anything that the bride needs in this hour is there a motivator right objective that's the only way that we're going to we're going to go from time to eternity that's the only way that we're going to we're going to get into the resurrection and into the rapture whether we've got to have the right motive and the right objective in what we're doing and how we do it and when we do it and where we do it amen although we do and I know they're there there are those that don't believe that they feel they know God's going to God's going to forgive us of this God will ignore this and God will ignore that brother we're not in Luther's age we're not in Wesley's age we're not even in the Pentecostal age a man we are in a bright age look what God is looking for in the age of the bridegroom and in the Alpha ministry what is God looking for in the Omega ministry a man brother this is not Luther this is not Wesley all of that is in between but whether there is a beginning and there is an end God God there was a perfection that God was manifested in the beginning and there's a perfection that God is looking for in the end a man brother it takes something there brother that although the rest never had they never experienced with the bride is the brightest periences justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost a man and then in going from that into the revealed Word the mystery the revelation of the mystery of God a man and we're going from the Alpha right into the Omega a man and his truth God requires something of us when the part of God said that the fullness of the Godhead bodily he said is now in the bright brother the fullness of the Godhead bodily the bride and I claim to be the break what does God require of me what is God expecting of me what is God expecting of you a man but look what God will he got to look for and wanted to do and manifest in the Alpha ministry and brother now it is real mega ministry he started this a man he laid his life down he picked it up again and he come and he put it into the body ain't man and little by little by little even he was pouring himself into the body under the fullness of the Godhead bodily is now in the bride a man he was pouring into the profits the progress the progress two prophets tell it was the God prophet a man the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the end the god prophet even our Lord Jesus Christ now it is in the in the braid a man brother you talk about perfection I pray God we're not going to listen to the devil to give us excuse us and to give and use this for you know just to get out of our way from the responsibility I love the revealed word amen the thing oh well our God don't require this God will require that brother that's the devil amen as it was in the Garden of Eden so it is now a man he's trying to undermine that what God requires he's trained doesn't you know what to make it a little smaller to change a little little here just and again understand this he'll give you just one word a man so brother's going to take it's going to take the whole truth nothing but the truth because the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in the bride and brother even if the fullness is in the bride what is God looking for in the bride when is God requiring in the bride and again all mine no wonder the prophet of God again said and he said God is waiting on us a man what for the rapture and the dead in Christ are waiting on us from the resurrection because Jesus said I am the resurrection of life but now that same guy that same Jesus is in the bride a man and it was me that was the break room now and now it's the bride and his missus Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord and brother a he said I am the resurrection and the life and if he is in the brain now the right is the resurrection and the life and that like ah that's why God is waiting on us amen brother and that's why God in this hour he gave us the example and he manifested what resurrection amen five times the Father God spoke and the Dead was resurrected amen five times brother and brother now God maybe if God did that brother what is God expecting in you and me if we believe the word we believe the a and the probably believe that the Prophet did this the probably did that a million what a regard to him to do we did it a man I pray grace that what God is expecting of us and what God is who wants us to do and we got a right motive and a right objective for the glory of God and for the resurrection and the mother rapture and brother were ARR mode of an objective is for their sake amen not just ours but they're theirs as well and for the aim for the sake of the gospel so god help us rather than I tell you this you talk about a.m. or mine the the the the right motive and a red object to that that Martin Luther had and that Wesleyan and the Pentecostals had God God bless them God honor their faith a man because they had a right motive and a right objector they've been what God revealed they believed a man and they and brother many laid down their lives for it they lay down their life they took their stand for it did it didn't matter to them they weren't going to change ER they believed it a man it's thus sayeth the Lord a man so I am do we believe as much as they believe in the sixty-eight million down through the church agents laid down their lives amen brother are we gonna lay down our lives brother who know the father God said we won't go on to death and be killed no no but before before that happens we're going to be resurrected we're gonna be raptured will we cut out of time and into eternity by the grace of God my brother it's gonna be those they got that faith a man and brother we if we got that faith we got a right motive and a right objective it's not just as our brother George Smith was bringing out it's not just doctor and doctor and doctrine doctrine no no brother it's it's eternal life a million it goes beyond doctrine to eternal life by the grace of God and Jesus proved it in the Alpha now he's proved it in the Omega amen brother you got a tremendous responsibility God requiring it of you don't think God just Oh Lord I believe the message yeah so there's the devil but the devil can talk it and the devil can tell you this and tell you that by the letter of the word but not the mechanics not the dynamics the mechanics but not the dynamics a man there's too many in the mechanics of it but they don't have the dynamics of it grace of God amen and in first chronicles chapter story chapter 13 and David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader and David said unto all the congregation of Israel if it seemed good unto you that it be of the Lord our God let us send abroad unto our brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel and with him also to the priests and Levites which are in the cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring again the ark of our God to us for we enquire not at edit in the days of Saul and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people but was it right in the eyes of God a man and how they were going to do it and the way they were going to do it was it right in the eyes of God and the subject here is our brother party said it is doing a right thing in the wrong way a man and this is what this is what David was going to discover that he was doing he was doing the right thing but he wasn't doing it the right way a man stood brother/sister again you have a right motive and a right objective but yet if you don't do it in the right way and with the right motives and again right motors objectives in your heart then brother is not pleasing to God amen but yet we'll see why David what David did wrong was that he did wrong it was right in that he wanted to get the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem that's right but how how did God wanted him to do it he didn't do it the way God wanted him to do it Amen so he said in verse 3 let us bring again the ark of our God to us for we we inquired of our God - inquired not at all in the days of Saul and all the congregation said they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people a man and a preacher can preach and everything is right in the eyes of the people that's right but what is it right in the eyes of God a man so David gathered all Israel together from shyer of Egypt even under the entering of emeth to bring the Ark of God from cursor serum and David went up in all Israel - Bela that is - kershaw serum which belonged to Judah and he said to bring up thence the Ark of God he said the Lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it and they carried the Ark of God in a new cart out of the house of abinadab aza and Eyal drave the cart and David and all Israel played before God with all their might and with sing and with harps and with psalteries with timbrels and with symbols and with trumpets a man and when they came under the threshing floor of shaitan as a put forth his hand to hold the earth for the oxen stumbled and the anger of the Lord was kindled against aza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before God and David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon aza where for that place is called Paris aza to this day and David was afraid of God that day saying how shall I bring the Ark of God home to me and so David brought not the ark home to himself to the City of David but carried it aside into the house of a medium or better a bit Adam to get light a man and the Ark of God remained with the family will bid Adam in the is house three months and the Lord blessed the house of a bit of them and all that he had god bless his words you may be seated we'll get to more of it in in hopefully if the Lord would late leads us but again David was doing something right but he was doing it wrong and we can be doing something right but do it wrong if we're not led by the spirit if it is not the spirit in control if it is not the spirit governing us and the spirit giving us the revelation that we need to do it the way that God wants us to do it a man to do what God is requiring of us so brother sister listen is considered again more seriously concerning their the motives and the objectives that govern our lives the motive and the objections that govern my life the motive and the objections that is governing your life is it right in the eye of God a man is it God in control or in Satan in control what was the motives from the objections that govern Adam and Eve in the garden a man there was a motive and there was an objective that God had revealed but yet when and when he went outside the garden to the tree of knowledge not an outside the garden but she left her husband and what does she do she went over to the tree of knowledge of good and evil she went out from it under her husband's spirit and her husband's authority and she went under another anointing and another spirit a man and she met the serpent a man and the devil was at work we're going to take the serpent and the devil was been using the serpent a man to influence Eve through the tree of knowledge of good and evil a man and brother as it was then so it is now that Satan used the tree of knowledge of good and evil as Satan is using the tree of knowledge of good and evil now a man so we got to be on our guard to make sure that brother we're going to stay under under the control of our bridegroom amen we're not going to come out from under the control of the second Adam as he came in from under control of their first Adam a man and she come under another influence we come under another power another anointing and it was the devil in the serpent a man and it was through the tree of knowledge of good and evil and we're living in a world that is now become a becoming more and more controlled by the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen and understand this in the tree of knowledge of good and evil Gabe relation of the word and it was 99% the truth amen but he he had added that he had added another word and he had changed what God had said God said who take of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and he said you shall surely die he-man but again the devil came and said you shall not surely die a man he was putting maybe a little little doubt in her inner mind a little thought in her mind to get her to get her to think old well not surely to oh well maybe maybe everything will be all right you know and and so this this won't bother the Lord and as the devil said oh and she believed the devil the devil city so you shall be as God's knowing good and evil a man he was justifying what he had so lead he was justifying his reasoning and train getting her to take of the tree of knowledge of good and evil oh I'm not saying there can be as the devil but you're going to be as God a man Oh fine so that was that was the CBD brother and if the devil is deceiving the bride and saying oh if you if you take of this well you're still going to be the bride a man and you're gonna be you're gonna be ordained and pray for the resurrection and for the rapture brother as the devil was doing then to Eve the devil is doing now ain't man there was a first Adam there was a second Adam and there was the first even there is a second Eve hey man I trust were not the second either we're not going to be to see a man but yet there's going to be there's many that that profess we believers but there they have the same anointing they're the same spirit as he did a man and the enemy and the enemy is a man is deceiving them into taking whether other part of God said and he'll had this or do you take away that a man as I say there are people that take a message book or the Bible in the end just oh and I wondered I said Lord there are those are there that's reading the Bible every day and I said how in the world can they live the life they live and do what they're doing I said have to reading the Bible but the thing of it is just reading the the mechanics of it but they're not into the dynamics of it a main issue it's just like reading a fairy tale amen oh yeah the Bible said did the Bible say that but they don't take it serious as man think they're not thinking well you know that God requires this of us God required that of them and much more than God require of us a man but the enemy is there to say yeah but yeh and God said yes God said but God don't require that of you that's the Old Testament hey oh yeah and that's what God told them that's what God told them but that God don't require that of you because of Jesus a man and you're pointing to Jesus you put on the Calvary now he said Jesus did it all so you don't have to do anything amen because you believe what Jesus did you believe he died you believe he laid his life down you believe that he picked it up again oh yes I do well he redeemed you hey man that's where the enemy is telling the so-called Christians today they believe the devil and brother he is persuader them that's all you need to believe us all you've got to believe is that hey man you don't have to believe this you don't have to do this you don't have to do that just believe what Jesus did and leave it a man no no if you're going to believe what Jesus did it ended or wonders with Jesus amen God is going to require more of us than he did of others amen because now Christ is in me and Chryslers revealing the word to me but the enemy is there amen they get us just just to read it but not to take it serious a million neither thing they got well Lord you Oh David did that they don't take it serious just read Ian and it is history oh it's just what happened in the Old Testament that's just what happened you know in the days of David that's just what happened back back in that age and so on but they don't take it serious and consider the fact that that those spirits are around the people today those spirits are enclosing the people today hey man we're dealing with the same devil a man brother listen overly guarded the devil never never never deceived David brother he did he would he was influencing day Davis thoughts hey man he was controlling David's arts and and listen he know he recognizes it oh he knows that God is going to do this and God is going to do this and and this one got this idea that one got this idea and the enemy to go over here let's see listen see the devil is there he see God God is there and the devil is there Jesus is here and then shows the devil and some part of the gosset he's the first one in church a man yeah well what about Jesus would he come with you a man but the devil was here before you got here hey man sir brother we go we got the enemy to deal with and David had the enemy to deal with the same devil you and I are dealing with David dealt with a man and when David got this idea in his mind oh I'm going where to go get the Ark of the Covenant I want to bring it back to Jerusalem and I wants to what he wanted to do this he wanted to do that but brother he had to do it God's Way hey man when it comes to the Ark of the comment you got to do it God's Way you just can't do it your way and think well well Lord my thoughts are right my motive is right my objectives are right and so on so Lord yeah but you got to do it God's Way if your motive is right and your objective is right make sure that you're going to be led by the spirit amen and David was oh yeah I want to get the Ark of the Covenant I want to bring it back to Jerusalem and so that we're going to worship God and God is going to be in our presence God is going to be in our vets because God is between the cherubims in the Ark of the Covenant amen so brother's sister what David was was endeavoring to do a man he was doing the right thing but he was doing it the wrong way amen brother if you're going to do the right thing do it the right way a man is not your ideas not your thought don't get the devil is anointing to do it make sure you get the Holy Ghost and I need to do it ain't man sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God they're controlled by the Spirit of God amen brother because they're impersonators and they're led by the night the Spirit of God they're led by the spirit of the devil amen that's what control II would say with a satanic spirit and this is a spirit at all when the enemy saw David and David oh yeah the Bible says right here that David consulted with captains of thousands and and with every leader a man my brother whatever the priesthood whatever the profit amen did he consult the Prophet no amen so the enemy the enemy knew what David was doing because he had consulted so many and brother it wasn't a secret thing because he had consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader so brother I tell you this if anybody knew what he was doing it was the devil and God knew what he was doing but God let him go on justice just to bring out these things just to teach us make sure your motive is right your objective is right make sure it's under the anointing of God Amen so that your motive is controlled by God your your objective is controlled by God your you're led by the Spirit amen praise the name of the Lord so this for that David right here brother he was the way it was right but yet he didn't he didn't do it get the way that God wanted to do it Amen now brother he should have known better because David David I ought to have known better because he knew the way they got it ordained at Amen when he brought for the Ark of the Covenant in the first amen he knew where he knew the way that God said you got to do this you got to do that you got to do that and brother he knew call yeah he had a revelation of the word even back then a man but he thought you know I'm the king I'm the leader of Israel and so you know I want to do this and I wanted that and the enemy no doubt as I say in in his conversation with the others the enemy the enemy was influencing David amen oh listen David's going down to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to Israel amen what is it brother he's gonna bring in a revival in Israel Oh the Israel is getting back to the Lord again listen go down and tell David to do this good and influence David to do that oh yeah that's right we'll see if we can influence him we'll say if he's gonna listen to us and that he okay he won't concern you won't consult the Prophet but you consult the the leaders of the people no brother you got to consult the Prophet amen it's not consulting the even then when it comes through the this ministry or that Minister another ministry make sure you go back to the Prophet amen there's a final ministry but make sure it's according to what the Prophet said amen they got to line it up with dust saith the Lord amen but the enemy got David to consult this one and this one in this one amen and that wasn't according to the way that God had ordained it amen his motive was good and it is objective but brother if it's for the glory of God yeah but you got to do it God's Way no matter what you what you're gonna do what you feel all I want to do this and I want to do that yeah that's good but isn't you and you feel it's to the will of the Lord a man boy feels the will of the Lord wow you're gonna do it now you're gonna do it God's Way your your way brother the ministry has got to be in God's control oh yeah the prophet of God was in God's control amen brother with if he got it alone the Lord went down and brought him back in line again and he would repent oh he did probably God would repent if God God said no you're doing this you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do that he said oh I'm sorry and lo any any line up with with with the will of God amen brother the ministry ought to stay in line with the Word of God and the will of God amen brother so we're going to do it God's Way but there's many administering brother today it's not doing it God's Way there's many administering brother today is not under the influence of the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit amen there's many a ministry brother brother that's under the influence of a false spirit a man as the enemy was influencing David as the enemy influenced prophets a man oh yeah Balaam the Prophet when when they they wanted him to come and curse Israel oh yeah and they say if you do we'll give you money how hardly shall they that are rich get into the kingdom listen I tell you this if money katrinka controls you are you put too much emphasis on money then where were the ones that Jesus spoke about how hardly shall it shall the rich enter the kingdom and they said you mean to tell me that that the rich want can't be saved won't be in oh yes but he said all things are possible with God but again that that person got to humble themselves to God and will see the rich man wouldn't do it a man God challenges your love for riches God challenges your love for possessions to see if you're going to give up this and give up that he knew he knew the rich what what was in the heart of the rich man not only that Jesus loved him because he did every whether the room a number of the Saints thank you for it expressed appreciation for the thoughts we've ministered on on Sunday and brother Matthew came with with and he said yes brother that's right any any expressive thoughts there and he concerning the rich man amen and Ananias and Sapphira that's right what was the problem it was either a right motive wrong objective or a wrong objective or right matter objective in the wrong motive and yet they were professing Christians but God dealt with God dealt with David God dealt with that with Balaam God dealt deals with the prophets God dealt with Israel a man when they wanted to do what was right in their own eyes and do it their way and not God's Way a man and going god can judge david and did this and did this he said now he said David he see well I'm going to do this this or this what do you want me to do he's going to judge him and chasing him amen and brother God judges and chasing to us if our motors and objectives are not right oh yeah we bought blamed the devil it wasn't the devil it was God Oh David David cursor over that's the devil no that was God Balaam gonna say that was the devil no was God a man and an answer sapphire oh they could have said oh that's a devil no when it comes to what happened to them that was God they died just think considering what Ananias and Sapphira did why what was the problem with their motive what was the problem with their objectives that Anna that Ananias died right at the beat of Peter oh they are you because why the spirit that was on and the influence that was on not on the church back back there dad that at that time Oh everybody was all a lot of people where they were selling all they had and they would they wanted to give it to the poor and do this and do this to support the ministry and so on but Ananias and Sapphira went happened they said well you know we're going to sell this to sell this and and but they didn't give it all to the Lord they kept the part of it for themselves but they left the impression they gave it all to the Lord you lead the impression that you're giving all to God you would die spiritually oh yeah and how nice when when he came to Peter and Peter said oh he said this is what I got for the property and the Lord revealed to Peter oh yeah that he had kept some for himself amazing there are people to do that with tidings oh yeah they do brother you better have your motors right your objectives right I gotta judge you amen and that their spirit wasn't right their attitude wasn't right because they want they wanted to all that that would be Lord will keep some of that for ourselves no no you did it with the purpose of giving it to the poor you did it with the purpose of giving it to this one and give it to that one to the gospel and he died and two or three hours later of course they took him over rather and they buried him and next come his wife and Peter said you did this you saw him for this should give you this it was revealed and she died see how serious it is your motives and objectives that if you're under God's influence God's requiring it of you amen if you're gonna leave the impression for this leave the impression I'm a believer Lee the impression I'm this and I'm that your brother you better bring forth the life amen to show that who you are to show that's what you heard a man that's not you living is Jesus living in you its Christ in control it's Jesus doing this hey man her brother and the sister Violet the devil won't come under their influence or go let them go under Satan's influence you see my lord have mercy on us that we see the seriousness of it amen decisions of what God requires Amy but brother all down through the enemy's been trying to under undermine what all got God's influence in in the lives of the of the sons and daughters of God try to undermine God's influencing in Ellen's life in his life trying to undermine God's influence in David's life a man or do this this will be alright God won't mind you do this God won't mind this oh yeah he's not he's not going to say there is no God he's not gonna condemn God distantly for this and this and this please no he's gonna leave with the impression that God won't mind amen because you you know you're a Christian and you're this you're that so you can do this you can do that so the Lord the Lord be with you know you better make sure it's God's will not you're not you're not what you want what does God one conservative belong doto opinion and a after consider the scriptures brother what we are read concerning David what you have read concerning David what what's recorded here concerning Ananias and Sapphira was recorded in the Bible concerning the rich man and Lazarus brother is not just old just Bible so I can go back and read it and I know what happened back then yeah but it's a lesson for us to learn from we got to be able to be instructed and counseled by what we read in the word amen lord I pray grace Lord that we're going to stay with your word amen and we're going to keep the right attitude and the right spirit we're not going to do the right thing the wrong way amen and Lord we're not going to go out and do it with selfish motives and a selfish objective oh sure oh you know I'll prosper and I'll get all I'll have this and I'll have that and I'll have something else no way that's the devil that's the least thing we want Lord not my will died and be done like again the brother said to bid the biggest life's told her told in church oh yeah he said get up and sing that a cottage why should I care is that true where's the law or here's to as many believers sing lies they do because its head or a cottage they do care they do they're building a mansion for me over there these are they sing it but they don't believe it oh yeah and we should leave summer tonight only believe all things are possible Lord I believe was it a lie or was it the truth God knows oh yeah God looks down and guts this or that person lied don't be that person they believe yeah god bless that person brother it's just this is serious we think you know this is I just believe what Jesus did and we got no worries about just come and sing and praise the Lord hallelujah and so on no no more to it than that brother God looking is that in your heart did it come out of your heart and not only that you will God see that spirit in that anointing when you gloat out of the church well that spirit in that anointing behind you in your home with that spirit and that anointing behind you in your job yeah because you're going to live in the spirit you're going to walk in the spirit you're gonna be led by the spirit brother sure it's not it's not you that lives is Christ that liveth in me well that's that's tremendous no matter what you're doing is Jesus there and he's controlling your thoughts and he's there if the enemy comes in with with a with a country thought you know Jesus is right there to convict you Oh forgive me Lord get behind me Satan amen how many I've used that expression during the day get thee behind me Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen my brother no no no I don't have to deal with the devil I'm a Christian I believe Jesus and I believe the message I believe the word amen oh yeah but still you gotta deal with the the more you believed the more you got to deal with seen a man the more faithful you are the more Satan's on your heels oh yeah hey man brother look what he did to Jesus and though he was dealing with the devil and brother when he came down he laid down his life picked it up again to come back and put that life in you now the father of God said they the devil's on the heels of the bright Amen sure the Devils on your heels did it was on my heels don't think that because you're a question that you don't have to deal with the devil the Christian is the one that has to deal with the devil the Krisher the one that the devil is after a man the devils their brother to deceive you the devil's there to get you to compromise oh yeah that with family friends neighbors oh don't have to worry with that you got daddy got oh oh we just got a show up show them love but yeah yeah you do that love is corrective but I tell you there's not many there's not many it's going to run to manifest corrective love oh yeah because if you love that child that you have as a son or a daughter yeah if you love real love your corrective oh yeah I know it's a world that we live and they don't believe in in in in real physical correction of a child and even in school the teachers are not allowed to one time they come in did they click on the side of the head or they hitch by the shoulder or something like that now they're not allowed to anything no no and then I remember it was on the radio one time when they're discussing it and they said did this kind of a treatment and everything they said oh it did it's gonna make the child you know a violent and so on make them this make him that and one man called in and he said listen he said that's a bunch of nonsense he said I was raised in a school and I got corrected and he said one time he said the teacher he said took a seat took not that seat but took the desk he said and he said brought it down on top of me and brought it down on top of another student and he said he said they didn't make us eight to teach her and he said didn't make us eight anybody it didn't it didn't give us a wrong attitude he said he said because he said where are we today and what are we today we're lawyers were doctors were this were that he said we're right there to help people he said that he said and what does teachers need to need to do today is correct students more amen he said we need more correction and of course parents are not allowed to do it and again we're somebody reported us for correcting our our daughter one time and and and the government sent sent in an individual to our door and they and they came in and they said oh we got this report we got that report at the time it was somebody was living in the basement of a house that we were in and then I guess they heard us correcting our daughter and they reported us for for being what he called it for being uh why abusing the child yes and and so on and I said what I said who in the world told you that that would they wouldn't say I said listen I said I turned it what no you know what why we got so many problems in in in in Canada well we got so many problems in Newfoundland I said even the police have acknowledged it that he said we need more correction amen in the hole need more correction in a UNESCO and I said you know us there's a certain country up there in Asia and I said that country and I said that they encouraged I said chastisement they encouraged correction and and I said they got less problems to deal with when it comes to breaking the law and they said they don't have problems with the young people breaking the law no no I said they they're more they're done young people there are more more in line and more respective than any other country yeah and I said there's more there they got a lot lot lot less problems when it comes to legal problems with you with young people why because they encourage correction a man brother and they've got God God there's anything we see in the scripture and in the Word of God it's correction amen love is corrected brother they have natural love is corrective divine love is correcting amen because God has what God has exercised correction freak from the group from the beginning God has exercised correction right from eternity when he cast out the devil and his angels amen amen when God came down into the garden and he corrected Adam and Eve amen and he passed her chairman of our Barney Avani a man that's but pain that she was going to suffer in childbirth but he also corrected at him now he didn't touch his body physically but he said he said I'm gonna curse the ground for your sake and you're gonna have to go work he said to bring forth you're gonna sweat of your brow yeah so God is the love of God was corrected all the way down through amen whether it's God dealing with individuals with God dealing with with those are they in the days of Noah where there's God dealing with the prophets a man God is corrective a man and brother if God is correct I meant are we corrective like that amen I tell you how it's going to require oh yeah but it's getting less and less and less in the world and that's why the world's insane why because they're not not doing things the way God wants them to do it amen they don't have right motors and right objectives no no it's all it's an intellectual world's an intellectual age brother this can make sure we got the right motive and the right objective and make sure it's all for the glory of God amen it's all reflecting that we are lining up with the Word of God for the for the glory of God brothers sister don't let the devil deceive you amen into thinking you're a believer because you believe this this and this anybody don't let the devil to save you in the thinking you're all right because you know your bless and prosper financially one day God's gonna take it all from you and you approve what you're like especially those especially those that that are that are nervous about their their income draw that mercy on us oh yeah God have mercy on his brother I preached it for years one time about I said the hours coming when I said you're gonna lose you're gonna go to bed I said owning this and owning this and only that me wake up in the morning you went on nine no no no that's not gonna happen oh yes it's going to happen never one happened to the bride you know God loves it yes he do and he's gonna bring out your faith yeah put you to this test this test this test to see if you're gonna really believe him see if you're gonna really love him see if you're gonna really trust him amen brother we could go through example after example in the Bible of God doing this and God doing that and he was testing their faith amen but yet they believed and they trusted God what about the three Hebrew children just thing the rest of the rest of the Jews in Babylon they must have worshipped the item but the three butcher was a note they said if you don't fall down and worship the idol we're gonna we're gonna heat the front of seven times hotter and gassy and they said we're still not gonna do it oh oh well if things are gonna get worse there's things gonna get hard living and living everyday you know oh well maybe I should change change this and change that oh yeah the devil is there and he's heating the furnace and oh they need heat the furnace little hotter see if you compromise you lead the furnace hotter by tell you this if you're the one of the three Hebrew children amen no no no matter how hot I guess your faith remains the same I am trusting God I'm trusting the Lord amen how many are trusting God no no they trust God you know what to trust God for they trust God to bless them financially they trust God to meet this need they trust God to meet that need when God is there to take that from you to test your faith God it there to take it from you not give it to you they take it from you to bring forth your feet amen why should we go to the three Hebrew children Oh Lord surely Lord if you loved him you wouldn't have done this he did love but look what he did they through the through the three but children to the furnace and those that sue them in died but the three boot children didn't die amen praise the name of the Lord Alleluia because when they turned around there was God he was in the body walking with them for the fire they didn't feel hot brother if it's the Holy Ghost in you you don't feel the pressure oh this is hard oh I can't take this Lord no no they could have they could have went through that and say oh Lord I can't take this heat I can't take this this fire no no didn't matter to them heat it seven times hotter that's fine we'll go on praise the Lord hallelujah so brother the enemy is here to throw us into a furnace of fire they could be what we experienced in everyday living he's gonna make it hotter and hotter and hotter harder to deal with harder to deal with harder to deal with what for to manifest your faith I'll tell you this if you've got faith you'll find that Jesus was there with you to encourage you and and to give you peace and rest amen because people will look at it and they'll wonder how in the world can you be content and go through this how in the world can you be you have this attitude in this spirit and experiencing all of this this going through this is happening to your children this is happening that's happening but still you got rest and peace and joy and love oh yeah and as the three as the three books don't matter for god you're going to have it they love the Lord more than they love the idol and just think again a dad Daniel in the lion's den and oh if you you know you got they wanted to worship the king because the king was their God and then you know and they didn't want allowed to pray one love do this but I'll tell you this Daniel never had it and I didn't I'd himself when he prayed he opened it up the drape he opened it up to look towards Jerusalem he wasn't going to hide it and he prayed unto the God of Abraham and they went reported him to Daniel to the king oh yeah they threw him into the Lions Den amen he wasn't afraid of the lion the lion was afraid of him amen he wasn't afraid of the lion the lion was afraid of the pillar fire oh yeah I'll be the pillar fire the Bravo say was with Daniel a man and wherever Daniel was with the pillar of fire and wherever Daniel went the felt the lion would go go to go the other way he stayed away from Daniel ain't ma'am he was afraid of Daniel Daniel wasn't afraid of him amen so brother sister no matter what God allows us to come into your life while our lives know what we got to be tested by him tried by Hema we're not afraid of that if anybody's gonna be afraid let the devil be afraid of you a man but we are more than conquerors through our Lord Jesus Christ amen you got the victory so brother sister I pray the grace of God that we're going to manifest the right motive and the right objective we're gonna manifest the life of Christ by the grace of God let's not do the right thing the wrong way let's do it the right way regardless of the price we have the pain grace brother it was rather matter that I lighted the rich young ruler a right motive but a wrong objective Israel his objective was selfish a man because he wanted treasure on earth not in heaven exactly so brother a right motive but a wrong objective he wanted to get more treasure on earth and so on because he was seeking eternal life what must I do to inherit eternal life he's more interested in narrating money popularity oh yeah a good name and Jesus said you wonder jesus knew his art Jesus knew his spirit jesus knew his attitude Jesus said well you know the commandments he said this this and this he said all of them have I kept from my youth oh I don't mean I don't think is anybody here to say that all of those commands he said if I kept from my youth up yet Jesus said there's one thing thou lackest one thing what's that he said sell all you have and give to the poor come follow me oh it struck you so hard I couldn't take it he couldn't take it no not by any means and he turned and walked away yet now listen Jesus loved him well God loves me so I won't be lost oh yes God loves you and God reveals himself to you now he's looking for the right motive and objective in your life for for the glory of God to give preeminence to God and the Word of God and you know that you give preeminence to walk to you to your brothers and sisters in the faith because you're living you're living for them well I'm didn't forgot but if you're living for God you live for your your brothers sisters in the faith you're living for your sons and daughters of God one time they did as I thought said about that that brother in in France when they were killing the people there and he saw them be aiding that woman and he took her place the man went over said no don't do that to her he said let me take her place do it to me just said what wait a minute he wasn't home but yet his heart went out to that woman and he said I'll take her place and they took the woman up let her go they took him put him down and be edited God rest his soul how many of us are willing to lay down our lives for one another how many of us are willing to sacrifice your life for your brothers and sisters in the faith hey man they were doing it in the day in in the first church age but Ananias and Sapphira wouldn't go all the way oh they went so far but they wouldn't go all the way they wouldn't they wouldn't give all to the body of Christ no no they wanted to keep some for themselves they owe and they would go off and say where the Lord blessed me oh yea the Lord prospered me knowing you didn't he didn't if the Lord prospered them you know what they would do they would give all and take nothing that's right yeah but the thing was they gave so much but they kept the rest for themselves and they would go around and say god bless to me God did this God did that listen sometimes it's the devil oh yeah though the devil yes the devil well look what he told Jesus on the on the Mount of Transfiguration or not did not train for liberation but on the Mount of temptation he said I'll give you this and I'll give you that what oh yeah he can prosper you because the devil he controls the things of the world so he certainly can prosper you sometimes God will bless you yeah right but again got a bless those those that can leave like your fun money god bless those that are able to that able to handle it but if you're not able to handle it you won't give it to you those that are so that they control it it don't control them but we're living in a world where prosperity controls the people grace to us brother it shows that our motives and objectives are wrong so god help us that by the grace of God will have a right attitude and a right spirit now take the spear of the rich young ruler no let me just bear with me and it's in Luke 18 he said a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall I do to inherit eternal life what if you were told what to do would you do it he wouldn't do it what eternal life that's what we're going to that's what we're looking for that's what we're believing for well we got to lay everything down we got we got to come to that place and live that life that anointing in our lives where nothing controls us only God nothing controls us honey the Holy Spirit we follow his leadership amen the Antonio do you know you're crave is not me that lives against Christ liveth in me now if it's Christ living in you well look at what he lived 2,000 years ago and he lived that same kind of life now what he did then he'll do now in you and in me and I had how he did it you'll do it now oh yeah yes brother God granted we need it praise the Lord and it says what shall I do to inherit eternal life and you get an answer and walk away from it this is amazing and just said unto him why call us now me good none as good save one and that is God and thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these have I kept from my youth up we haven't but he did thank God for the grace in our lives and when Jesus heard these things he said unto Him yet lack us now one thing you only like one thing what do we like yes amen the challenge and he said sell all that thou hast and distribute on to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me well if you recognize Jesus you honored him as Lord you'd think you'd be instant to obey what he said oh okay master that's what I'll do and I trust you amen I'll sell all I got and I'll give it to the poor as I said I don't believe Jesus meant that he did he had to dead that he had to heal just to make his family poor or whatever he would allow him to have enough there to look after his family and provide for his family a man that's right but Jesus knew what his art was on what he was living for and what he what he would oh I know God has blessed me because of this we judge we judge the the grace of God by what we possess we judge the grace of God by what we have that's right sometimes it's the grace of God for what we have not his grace that took this from us took that from us why because we're putting too much emphasis on it our faith was more in that than in God amen and he said thou shalt have treasure in heaven come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich see again like one of the brother batten brought out I have every but now I see concerning the oil well then he told those those brothers about a man God was gonna bless him with it but they didn't do it God's time they didn't do it God's Way andhe finally they did they came up with brother Brown says the commercial ideas or we'll do this we'll do that what do something else God said no he just he just did this for them personally not a commercial not a business but to bless them personally that's all everyday living but no they wanted to build it big and make this and do that and do something what the world would do and so what God do God allowed those of the world to come in and get it before they got it why because their motives and their objectives in it was wrong what what they wanted to do and how they wanted to do it wasn't the way God wanted them to do it you don't do things the way the world does it you do things the way Jesus did it amen how would Jesus do this I would Jesus do that but it's in the word and when Jesus saw thee he was very sorrowful and he said Ardley show they that I riches enter into the kingdom of God for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and again again there was the family doctor many years ago that that I told you about and he also asked me all he said Jerome what is that what's the needles eye that the camel going to go through he thought was the Iver a needle that you saw with no I said that's not the eye of the needle I said a needles eye I said is the small door in the gate of the city I said they only opened the gates I said when there's a crowd going in or when the camels are going in whatever but I said the gates are closed for security and I said but in the gate I said they have a small door and I said you opened that small door to go in as an individual into the city that's the acid that's the eye of the needle and it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of the needle the hell he said then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God there's no way a camel could go through it you as an individual human being can go through it but not a camel no no but it is easier for a camel to go through that then for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God sir brother god help us to be on our guard god help us to be led by the spirit controlled by the Holy Ghost amen so that were what were heaven bound and it says and they that heard it said who then can be saved and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with God a man grace of God so brother I pray that will not have the spirit of the rich young ruler no we're not at the spirit of Ananias and Sapphira with wrong motives right objectives or right motives and wrong objectives no no let's have the right motive and right objective giving God the preeminence in what we do how we do it when we do it where we do it all the glory of God a man so brother grace that we're going to do it God's Way your life my life we're going to do it God's Way do what God wants us to do how God wants to do it when he wants it to do where he wants us to do it is not my will Father thine be done amen so brother God give us the right motive right objective the right reason for what we're doing all for the glory of God amen I had a scripture here let's see mark now we had this we'll finish with this for tonight mark chapter 7 mark 7 and verse 7 oh I didn't realize well thank God for giving me the voice in mark 7 and verse verse 1 then came together unto him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from Jerusalem and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled with defiled that is to say with on washing hands they found fault for the Pharisees and all the Jews except they wash their hands often ate not only the trajector tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brazen vessels enough table then the Pharisees and the scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but he bred with on Washington's he answered and said unto them well as Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written the people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me so I'll be it in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men in vain do many a believer worship God why because they have the mechanics of the word but not the dynamics and the prophet of God did say himself he said that's the problem he said we're putting too much emphasis on the mechanics and he said not the dynamics he said brothers and sisters what we need is the dynamics what is the dynamics it is the life of the word because you can have to have the letter of the word and no life but we need the dynamics of it amen they got the dynamics make the mechanics live amen it'll make the mechanics flesh in you manifested in your flesh not in your head and your tongue but in your everyday living amen and the message doing God a service without his will the Prophet said we are in the end time and he said I get started on that and forget about time he said we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity so he said I want to read Matthew Mark 7 and 7 in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so he said God is sovereign and we see here what David done in the scriptures and chronicles Eddie said he was and his intentions was good but he said God does not give us merits on good intentions he said there's only one way to serve God and that's by doing his will at his command and he said God being sovereign there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it he does it his way he knows the right way to do it and that makes me feel good and it ought to make us all feel good he said I'm sure it does for one would have it coming in this way one would have it going that way or not on the other way but one great thing again about God he's not left us without knowing what's the truth and how to do it amen he said he wouldn't be just to punish up for us for doing something and he said that we didn't know how it was going to be done and then let us stumble into something he's not that kind of a god he's a God that speaks a word and expects his children to believe it and therefore he knows what's best and he knows when to do it and he knows how to do it he said we have our ideas of it but God knows amen so it's doing it God's Way brother a right mode and right objective it's got to be God's Way it's got to be a motive it's got to be motivated by God by the grace of God amen to give us the right objective it says God regulates the Sun he regulates nature to meet his word he regulates the church the predestinated the bride to meet the season that they are living in amen praise the name of the Lord yes indeed by the grace of God now I say don't miss this they failed to get it because they hadn't consulted by and by doing that by going to the priest by going to theologians by going to military forces but he said not considering their God sent messenger of the hour Nathan they did it wrong what referring to the scripture that we read in Chronicles where they went to do what was right but they did it wrong why because they say they never consulted God's messenger he said they he went and he talked to these these thousands rather and these these leaders and so on but he said they never consulted the Prophet to get his thoughts he meant and just look what it cost it was a blessing to one man because where they had to leave the Ark of the Covenant they left it in his own her brother's somewhere is that it you must have been right his spirit must been right because God blessed him for three months while the Ark of the Covenant was in his own he was blessed oh yeah the power the anointing the the presence of God was there Oh mind the love of God was there and all he was richly blessed amen the peace of God but why the God dealt with David in another way God dealt with Israel in another way because they never consulted his prophet he said they went and they picked up the ark and they put it on a new cart they put it upon he said a new cart or a new denomination is going to start up and not upon the God given ordained way to pack it it was supposed to be packed on the shoulders of Levites not a cart and when you start wrong you'll keep on going wrong so come back to the word brother and let's start right there's got to be a right motive right objective not for the glory of man but for the glory of God David was wanted to do this one do that oh yes because we want want the blessings of God we want the you know the presence of God with us and so on yeah but you got to do it God's Way and it was supposed to be on the shoulders of the Levites not on a cart that's right and when the when the when the animals begin to tremble and the cart begin to shake and that brother that was there all due respect to that brother not saying that he was lost no not by any means but his heart went out because he was afraid that the ark was going to fall off the cart and he went out to hold the current and when he did he died before the Lord so he's not lost but he died before the Lord yeah and why because only the priesthood could do that he couldn't do it see you got to do it God's Way so brother there's many a man and woman around the world word and run the message today they're dead spiritually oh yeah because they're doing this and they're doing that and they're doing something else but I'm not doing it God's Way they're doing it their way what they think what they feel no no you gotta be led by the spirit always her brother listen what time we are living in what's the age what's the hour that we are living in it's not time for these things that they are talking about that's passed judgment is on end now and you can see it breaking you remember the rock upon the mountain judgment hour you remember the revelation or the vision of the bride just keep her in step don't better get a step that was the last vision that the Prophet had of the bright he saw this group and that group going down and singing onward Christian soldiers and the one group went on down and the other group began to go up and as that group began to go up he noticed that near the end they were getting out of line and they were focusing on one another but you had to focus on Christ and follow him in the rapture and they were just you know distracted and the prophet of God in the vision he screamed stay in line stay in line never getting out of line he says stay in line amen and that was his last warning to the Bride of Christ stay in line not with this brother of that brother stay in line with the Lord stay in line with the revelation of of our Lord Jesus Christ he has come for the bride a man he has come for the right a man God gave us the revelation the understanding we need a man to stay in line with the reveal word stay in line with the revelation of the Resurrection the revelation of the rapture amen look up our Redemption draws nigh this keep our edit our motives rate our objectives right brother what is the rate Motors read objectives for the bride not the natural things of life the spiritual amen if you cost you on that on the spiritual God broke down to look after your natural God look after this God look after that so just just keep focusing on the spiritual amen and then that the natural will fall in line by the grace of God you'll watch over you he'll keep us a mint by the grace of God God blushes amen the stand praise the name of the Lord the
