[20:22] dear gracious heavenly father or Lord.
[20:26] There's a lot in that one line there of
[20:28] in your time.
[20:30] Too many times, Lord, we get caught in
[20:32] looking at things through our eyes,
[20:34] judging it on humanistic time, Father.
[20:38] But Lord, may we just always look at
[20:40] each other and through your eyes,
[20:42] Father, knowing that you're still
[20:44] working on each and every one of us and
[20:47] we'll be accomplished and fulfilled and
[20:49] completed in your time. Father,
[20:53] forgive us if we try to get ahead of
[20:55] your plan. Lord,
[20:59] forgive us if we hold someone to a
[21:00] standard, Lord, that is not realistic or
[21:02] in keeping with your will, Father.
[21:07] Lord, as we come here, Lord, and I pray,
[21:10] Father, that you just help us to come
[21:11] with open hearts. Father, may we each
[21:14] and every one make footsteps of
[21:15] possession in our own lives. Father,
[21:19] help us to come open, Lord. Nothing
[21:21] standing between us.
[21:23] Maybe not worry about the person next to
[21:25] us. Father, but may we just get into
[21:27] that channel where you can flow freely
[21:29] through us, Lord.
[21:32] Forgive us, Lord, if there's anything we
[21:34] hold against someone else, Lord.
[21:38] And Lord, I pray your grace just be upon
[21:40] us all, Lord.
[21:43] Grace especially Lord to all the needs
[21:45] father.

[21:56] you just strengthen his testimony Lord.

[22:01] Grace to brother Steven
[22:04] all the different saints across the
[22:05] aisle. Lord those that couldn't make it
[22:06] here. Father
[22:08] may you just give them a double portion
[22:10] father to give them strength for the
[22:11] journey ahead.
[22:14] grace especially Lord to brother
[22:15] Jonathan as he comes to minister

[22:22] to go down the little rabbit trails that

[45:45] God.
[45:47] Hello Oh,

[45:54] great
[45:57] I am
[46:00] the riser
[46:04] [Music]
[46:12] and
[46:14] king.
[46:17] Hallelujah. Lord, we're lifting your
[46:19] name this morning, Lord. There's no
[46:21] other name that's worthy to be praised.
[46:23] It's a name that is high and lifted up.
[46:25] It's a name above all names. Lord, your
[46:28] word says that at that name, every knee
[46:30] shall bow and every tongue confess that
[46:33] Jesus Christ is Lord. And you are our
[46:35] Lord. Lord, we're claiming that this
[46:37] morning, Lord, not just a savior, but
[46:39] you are our Lord. You are our headship.
[46:41] You are our leader, our guide, our
[46:42] shepherd this morning, heavenly father.
[46:44] Lord, and I pray that it would be, Lord,
[46:46] not just a confession of our mouth,
[46:48] Lord, but a profession of our life,
[46:50] Lord, that the way we live, the things
[46:51] we do, the things we say, the things we
[46:53] don't. Lord, all of it would reflect the
[46:55] headshift and lordship of Jesus Christ
[46:57] in our lives by your spirit. Lord, we
[47:00] pray you'll take this service once
[47:01] again, that you would speak to our
[47:02] lives, our situations, Lord, that you
[47:05] would minister to your bride this
[47:06] morning. We pray, Lord, bless them now.
[47:08] We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[47:10] it. Amen. Amen. God bless you each one
[47:13] this morning. Turn to Isaiah 14,
[47:16] chapter 12. Boy, we've got a full
[47:18] building this morning as much as we
[47:20] have. Full is the two center rows, you
[47:22] know, but it's wonderful to see that.
[47:24] Want to welcome the Wam family here.
[47:25] Good to see them this morning. Amen.
[47:28] Good to see sister Nadine back with us
[47:29] as well. God bless you. I wanted to
[47:31] thank the church for all getting back to
[47:33] brother Paul on their camp attendance
[47:35] and letting him know when they're going
[47:36] to be available or if they're going to
[47:38] be available. And first priority always
[47:40] goes to people of the church. Amen. And
[47:42] so I know some of you are are waiting on
[47:44] work confirmation and we'll hold your
[47:46] spot for work confirmation. There's
[47:47] nothing you can do about that. But if
[47:49] you have other commitments, then that's
[47:51] something that you have to decide is
[47:52] where you're going to go. And if you
[47:54] can't commit, then we have to go with
[47:55] others that will commit themselves to
[47:57] the camp. So just so you understand, um
[47:59] there's not we're not trying to make
[48:01] exceptions for one and not the other,
[48:02] but if you can't help it, we'll make an
[48:04] exception. If you can help it, you just
[48:06] haven't decided yet. Unfortunately,
[48:07] we're going to have to go with those
[48:09] that can commit and decide. So, please
[48:11] understand that brother Paul has talked
[48:12] with me extensively about each of the
[48:14] situations we've had to deal with and
[48:16] his actions are with my support and it's
[48:18] my decision that I've made with him. So,
[48:20] if you have any issues, you can talk to
[48:22] me, not him, because he made them with
[48:23] my full input on those things. So, we're
[48:26] thankful for that. We're thankful we've
[48:28] got a lot of people coming to camp and
[48:29] we're trusting the Lord to just move in
[48:31] a special way. Amen. I want to give
[48:33] another praise report for my eye. As you
[48:35] know, I had surgery about two months
[48:36] ago, and I went to the opthalmologist
[48:38] for my two-month checkup, and he looked
[48:40] at the wrong eye and said, "It looks
[48:41] great."
[48:43] So, either there's well, he looked at
[48:46] the other eye, so maybe there's
[48:47] something wrong with the other eye, but
[48:48] um he said he couldn't tell which one it
[48:50] was. So, I praise the Lord for that.
[48:52] Amen. That it's healed so completely
[48:53] that the opthalmologist that did the
[48:54] work can't remember the one that he did
[48:56] the work on. Amen. That was a wonderful
[48:59] special. Sister Nikki and the whole
[49:00] group. I didn't get to see it. I could
[49:01] hear it. Sounded like we had about 40
[49:03] people up here, but that's wonderful.
[49:05] God bless you. And I know there's a lot
[49:07] of hard work and effort put into that.
[49:08] So, God bless you each one. I did want
[49:10] to bring a prayer request. Uh many of
[49:12] you would know uh Mrs. Piery from the
[49:15] 7th Day Advent School. She was the
[49:16] principal for the for the the elementary
[49:19] school and her daughter Cherylyn. So, my
[49:22] wife and I met Cherylyn a little while
[49:23] ago in the I guess around February, I
[49:25] think, when we were out walking and we
[49:27] talked with her and uh we didn't know
[49:29] too much about her situation, but my
[49:31] sister Elena's been talking to her
[49:33] through Facebook and they've kind of
[49:34] reconnected and she has a a prayer
[49:36] request. So, she has scaraderma. Now, if
[49:39] you know anything about scaraderma, you
[49:40] know it's a death sentence. So, what
[49:41] happens is it hardens the skin, it
[49:43] hardens the tissue of the organs of the
[49:45] body, and so eventually what happens is
[49:47] they harden to the point where they
[49:48] won't function. So a typical life
[49:50] expectancy from diagnosis is 5 to 10
[49:52] years. She's got a couple years left at
[49:54] best they say. So she's asked for
[49:57] prayer.
[49:58] Now she doesn't necessarily believe in
[50:01] prayer this way in divine healing
[50:03] because she hasn't been taught divine
[50:05] healing. But she's getting to a place
[50:07] where she's getting desperate.
[50:10] So we're going to pray.
[50:13] Maybe she'll come here for prayer. But
[50:16] it's got to be a prayer of faith.
[50:17] remember not a prayer just of
[50:19] desperation but a prayer of faith. So I
[50:22] want us to remember her over the coming
[50:24] days and months that the Lord would work
[50:26] in her heart that he would quicken faith
[50:28] to the word. Amen. Not just to a church
[50:31] or to a ministry, but that he'd point
[50:33] her to his word and that she'd see
[50:35] herself written in the pages of the
[50:36] Bible. What a horrible thing to have
[50:38] that sword hanging over your your life
[50:41] day in and day out, not knowing when
[50:42] that last moment's going to come and you
[50:43] can't breathe. your heart starts pumping
[50:46] and things just start to shut down.
[50:47] That's what she's dealing with. So I
[50:49] say, Lord, grant mercy.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:53] God bless you this morning. We're going
[50:54] to read from Isaiah 14. And this is an
[50:57] odd scripture if I would say it. We're
[50:58] preaching on the Holy Ghost, the token
[51:00] life, the the life of a Holy Ghost
[51:02] fililled believer. And we're going to
[51:03] read about Satan this morning. And it
[51:05] says, "How art thou fallen from heaven,
[51:07] oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[51:10] thou cut down to the ground which did
[51:12] weaken the nations? For thou hast said
[51:14] in thine heart, I will ascend into
[51:16] heaven. I will exalt my throne above the
[51:19] stars of God, and I will sit also upon
[51:22] the mount of the congregation in the
[51:24] sides of the north. If you look at that
[51:26] stars of God, if you go to Revelation 1,
[51:28] it says the stars of God are the seven
[51:30] angels to the seven church ages. He'll
[51:32] elevate his ministry. He'll try to
[51:34] elevate his ministry above the seven
[51:36] angels ministries to the gentile church
[51:38] age. He says, "For thou hast said in thy
[51:41] heart, I'll ascend to heaven. I'll exalt
[51:42] my throne above the stars of God. I will
[51:44] sit also upon the mount of the
[51:46] congregation.
[51:48] He's going to sit where churches gather.
[51:50] He says, in the sides of the north, and
[51:52] I will ascend above the heights of the
[51:54] clouds, and I will be like the most
[51:57] high. I will be like God. He says, God
[52:00] bless you. You can take your seats this
[52:01] morning. Now, before we get into our
[52:04] service this morning, I did want to make
[52:05] some quick clarifications. I've had a
[52:07] number of conversations with people over
[52:09] some of the things I've been preaching
[52:11] here and a couple services ago we
[52:12] preached on headship on the Sunday
[52:14] morning and and I wanted to follow up
[52:16] with some things because for those of
[52:18] you that have sat under this ministry
[52:19] for for years or maybe decades you may
[52:22] you you would have understood where I
[52:24] was coming from but for those that
[52:25] haven't it can be difficult at times to
[52:27] hear some of the things that I preach
[52:28] because you haven't been taught this
[52:30] way. Amen. But we talked about headship
[52:33] and we talked about how when when there
[52:34] was the fall in Eden that God had
[52:36] instituted headship where the man was
[52:37] the head and the woman was under his
[52:40] headship. Then we said that the the the
[52:42] headship there was imperfect but it was
[52:44] still God's way. Amen. God ordered it
[52:47] that way. He said that the woman would
[52:48] be subject Paul said the woman will be
[52:50] in obedience to the husband. And I
[52:51] wanted to say this because so often what
[52:53] we have is imperfect people in imperfect
[52:55] situations. And so the word works
[52:58] properly when the entire marriage is
[53:01] under the headship of the word. When
[53:03] both are believers, when both are
[53:04] serving God in sincerity. Amen. But if
[53:06] the husband's not a Christian and the
[53:08] wife is, well, now we've got a problem,
[53:10] don't we? Because that man has no
[53:11] headship of his own.
[53:14] And that woman's trying to submit to a
[53:15] husband who's not under the headship of
[53:17] the word. Now, that doesn't give the
[53:18] woman the opportunity now to just go and
[53:20] do whatever she wants. By no means. You
[53:22] serve your husband as unto the Lord, the
[53:24] scripture says. Amen. But you have to
[53:26] serve him as he serves the Lord. So if
[53:28] he would try and pull you away from what
[53:30] the word says, you're not in obedience
[53:32] there. But where he is, you've got to
[53:33] submit yourself and the decisions of the
[53:35] household still run through him. Now
[53:37] then you have vice versa where you have
[53:38] the the the husband is the is the one
[53:42] that's a believer and the wife is not.
[53:44] Well, now you've got a wife that won't
[53:45] submit to a husband because she's not
[53:47] under headship to the word. And so he's
[53:49] trying to lead the family. He's trying
[53:50] to do godly things and whatnot. But you
[53:52] have a wife now that's in rebellion
[53:54] because she's got her own way of doing
[53:56] it. Now Paul deals with this. He says,
[53:58] "Listen, if the if the believing husband
[54:00] is with the unbelieving wife and she is
[54:02] is content to stay with them," he says,
[54:04] "Then then stay in the marriage." He
[54:06] says, "But if she's going to leave, then
[54:08] let her go." He says, "You're not in
[54:09] bondage to her." Then he flips it
[54:11] around. He says, "Now if it's the
[54:12] believing wife with the unbelieving
[54:13] husband," he says, "If the unbelieving
[54:15] husband is happy to to stay with you in
[54:17] marriage, stay with him." He says, "But
[54:19] if he leaves, you're not in bondage." He
[54:21] didn't say go remarry. Remarage is only
[54:24] for is only after that man dies. But you
[54:27] aren't bound to that. But the thing is
[54:29] what happens too many times is we think
[54:31] that because someone's out of headship
[54:33] then I can step into their role. And you
[54:35] can't get word results if you step out
[54:37] of your word position. You can't become
[54:39] the head because your husband's not. You
[54:42] can't become the god of the house
[54:43] because your husband is not. Or vice
[54:45] versa. You can't force your wife to do
[54:47] something that she doesn't want to do.
[54:48] She's got to come to a place. And Paul
[54:50] says, "Per adventure, you might be the
[54:52] saving of that spouse." You've got to
[54:54] stay in your godly role. You've got to
[54:56] stay in your own place of submission.
[54:58] Amen. That's a thing to remember because
[55:00] wives, you can't get your husband to
[55:02] submit by getting out of your position.
[55:04] You can't bring him into the word by
[55:06] getting out of the word, if I put it
[55:07] that way. You got to stay in your
[55:09] position. But I've heard of instances of
[55:11] of husbands that were abusive to women
[55:14] in relationships, even within the the
[55:16] confines of of the the Christian world,
[55:18] even this message. And a woman is never
[55:20] bound to stay in an abusive
[55:22] relationship. By no means. If your
[55:24] health, if your safety, whatever it is,
[55:26] is is is in fear of that man, then you
[55:29] can move on. Not remarry, but you can
[55:31] move on for the sake of your body's
[55:32] sake, for the sake of your safety. Amen.
[55:35] And may God grant you grace because now
[55:37] you're under your own headship. That's a
[55:39] dangerous place to be. But I wanted to
[55:40] clarify that by no means do we preach a
[55:42] headship where a man is abusive. Amen.
[55:45] She is not the rug under our feet,
[55:47] brothers. If we treat her like that,
[55:48] shame on us. She is our queen. We treat
[55:51] her as a queen. We treat her with honor,
[55:53] with dignity, with respect, with love,
[55:55] and we sacrifice ourselves for that
[55:57] woman. That is our role as believing
[56:00] men. Amen. So we are not in this
[56:01] headship of my way or the highway. Meet
[56:03] Tarzan, you Jane. That's not it. We lead
[56:06] by the word as Christ did. We give
[56:08] ourselves for our families and for our
[56:10] relationships. Amen. So I wanted to to
[56:12] clarify that just this morning so
[56:14] there's no misunderstanding. But we're
[56:16] going to take another service and we've
[56:17] been preaching on this idea. We preached
[56:19] on uh uh absolute power and we've taken
[56:22] this this mis this redirection I should
[56:25] say on this thought of an echochamber
[56:27] gospel. Amen. And we're preaching on the
[56:29] life of a holy ghostfilled believer but
[56:31] we're opening with a scripture about
[56:33] Lucifer about Satan. Amen. And we're
[56:35] talking we're taking a bit of a
[56:37] circutous route. We're going to come
[56:38] back to absolute power. But what this
[56:40] little uh blip on the radar is is that
[56:42] I'm showing you what happens when you
[56:44] take things into your own hands. I'm
[56:46] trying to show you what happens when you
[56:48] make your own decisions. When we do
[56:50] things our own way, when we determine to
[56:51] do things or have things or be something
[56:54] and it takes us down a path of
[56:55] destruction. And that's what I'm
[56:56] showing. And I'm taking us back to the
[56:58] beginning. Amen. Because I want us to
[57:00] look inside and say, "Am I under this
[57:01] kind of an influence?" I'm not preaching
[57:03] to people that aren't here. I'm
[57:05] preaching to those that are here because
[57:06] Satan is subtle. Satan is subtle. And so
[57:09] I want you to see the influence. I want
[57:11] you to see the mindset. I want you to
[57:12] see the way that this spirit will make
[57:14] you think and act. Because if we see it,
[57:16] we want to root it out sooner than
[57:18] later. Because the longer it goes, the
[57:19] bigger that plant's going to grow. Amen.
[57:22] And I want us to distinguish, and again,
[57:23] we're going to take this back to the
[57:25] very beginning between the idea of being
[57:27] anointed, Amen, and being filled with
[57:30] the spirit because they are not the same
[57:32] thing. I want us to to to be able to see
[57:35] the difference where God can put his
[57:36] spirit on you and use you for something
[57:38] supernatural, something prophetic,
[57:40] something that is beyond our abilities.
[57:43] And that's an anointing. But that is not
[57:45] the same as being filled with the
[57:46] spirit. And we'll see that as we go
[57:48] through because as we get to the root of
[57:50] this concept, we can see that you can be
[57:52] anointed without righteousness
[57:55] if you can believe it. And I'll prove it
[57:57] to you by the scriptures. Like I said,
[57:58] we're going to go to the to the very
[58:00] beginning of this, but you look at
[58:01] Balum, you look at Caiaphas, you look at
[58:03] Judas, all had prophets, they had they
[58:06] had uh ministry, they had prophecy, they
[58:07] had signs and wonders, great
[58:09] demonstrations, but they were men of sin
[58:11] that turned against God and they were
[58:13] destroyed in their own gospel. But I
[58:15] want you to take I want to take you to
[58:16] the root of this this morning because
[58:18] we'll see that this is really a hard
[58:20] issue. This is a problem of what's on
[58:21] the inside. The problem is not the
[58:23] anointing. The problem is the vessel.
[58:25] Okay? And we're going to see that this
[58:26] morning. And this is something that
[58:28] happened way before you ever came into
[58:30] natural existence. This is a spirit
[58:32] that's been trying to work in our midst
[58:34] for for all of eternity, for all of
[58:36] time, I should say. And it's been the
[58:38] same spirit working all along. And so if
[58:40] we go to Ezekiel 28 this morning, it
[58:42] says, "Moreover, the word of the Lord
[58:44] came unto me, saying, Son of man, take
[58:46] up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus,
[58:49] and say unto him, thus sayeth the Lord
[58:52] God, thou sealest up the sum, full of
[58:55] wisdom, and perfect in beauty." In
[58:57] another translation, it says, "You were
[58:59] full of wisdom and beauty, the image of
[59:02] perfection." Now, we'll see as we go
[59:04] here that this is not preaching to the
[59:05] king of Tyrus. This is preaching to
[59:07] Lucifer. Amen. And and it'll be very
[59:10] clear as we go through this. So the
[59:12] description of Satan, the description of
[59:14] Lucifer in his original creation is full
[59:18] of wisdom and beauty, the image of
[59:21] perfection.
[59:24] Wow. I would love to have that
[59:26] description this morning.
[59:29] If somebody could say, "Brother John,
[59:31] you are full of wisdom and beauty and
[59:33] the image of perfection." I would say,
[59:35] "Hallelujah. Let's go in her
[59:36] resurrection and her rapture. This was
[59:39] Lucifer's original estate, church.
[59:43] But what does it teach us? What we see
[59:46] is not always what is.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. What it looks like on the outside
[59:49] is not what it looks like on the inside.
[59:51] He says, "Thou hast been in Eden, the
[59:54] garden of God." Tyrus never walked in
[59:56] Eden.
[59:58] Satan walked in Eden. Satan walked in
[1:00:01] Eden. Amen. Now watch his description,
[1:00:03] his appearance. Now he says, "Every
[1:00:05] precious stone was thy covering, the
[1:00:08] sardius, the topaz and the diamond, the
[1:00:10] barrel, the onyx and the jasper, the
[1:00:12] sapphire, the emerald, the carbuncle and
[1:00:15] gold. The workmanship of thy tabts and
[1:00:18] of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the
[1:00:20] day that thou was created." Now that
[1:00:21] makes no sense to most of us, does it?
[1:00:23] Anybody understand everything that was
[1:00:25] said there? All right, let me take you
[1:00:26] to what it says. It says, "Your fittings
[1:00:29] and your clothing and your worship
[1:00:30] instruments were prepared for you in the
[1:00:34] day that you were created." In other
[1:00:36] words, Lucifer was created with purpose
[1:00:38] and it's tied to worship and beauty.
[1:00:42] That's his original thing. He was built
[1:00:44] to worship God. He was the greatest of
[1:00:47] all the angels. But notice what covers
[1:00:49] him now. He's covered in gems. He's
[1:00:52] covered in jewels. And it's all embedded
[1:00:54] in gold. His trappings, his clothing,
[1:00:57] his entire covering is gorgeous.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And it's built just for Lucifer.
[1:01:03] And this is what makes him one of the
[1:01:06] greatest or the greatest of those angels
[1:01:08] in those times. Amen. And if you look,
[1:01:09] you'll see that most of these stones are
[1:01:11] the ones that were in the breastplate
[1:01:13] for the yerm thumb. But not all
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; because he is not the type of the yerm
[1:01:18] thumb.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; But he was meant to do a similar thing.
[1:01:23] Now, watch how we go through this. You
[1:01:26] see these gems?
[1:01:28] If you if you've ever looked in a in a
[1:01:31] uh a jewelry store, have you noticed how
[1:01:34] dark they are?
[1:01:36] No. What is a jewelry store? They've got
[1:01:39] bright light shining on everything
[1:01:41] because they want the jewels to sparkle.
[1:01:44] And so Lucifer's trappings, his clothing
[1:01:48] is all beautiful only in light. He's
[1:01:52] only going to glow and sparkle and
[1:01:55] shimmer and shine when he's in the
[1:01:57] presence of light. If he's in darkness,
[1:02:01] he has no beauty. But when he's in
[1:02:04] perfect light, when he's in the presence
[1:02:07] of God, that's where his beauty comes
[1:02:10] forth. So, he is literally built to be
[1:02:13] beautiful in the presence of God. And
[1:02:16] outside of God, he has no real beauty.
[1:02:19] Now, catch that. Amen. Without light,
[1:02:21] those gems have no beauty. They're just
[1:02:24] lifeless. You ever go out on a, you
[1:02:27] know, I've got a diamond in my ring and
[1:02:29] it's it shines pretty bright here in
[1:02:30] this light, but if I go out on a cloudy
[1:02:31] day, that just looks dull. There's
[1:02:34] nothing to it. It just likes a looks
[1:02:35] like a piece of plastic or something in
[1:02:37] there. There's no beauty to it. There's
[1:02:38] no shark. There's no sparkle. There's no
[1:02:41] shine to it. Amen. But Lucifer is
[1:02:43] designed to be in light. Everything
[1:02:46] about him is focused on this. So, we
[1:02:49] would say it this way. His beauty is
[1:02:51] conditional on the presence of God.
[1:02:54] Okay, catch this now this morning. He
[1:02:56] only lights up the room when there's a
[1:02:59] light in the room already. There's
[1:03:01] nothing in him that brings light to the
[1:03:03] room. But when there's light, he looks
[1:03:05] beautiful. Amen. His very expression of
[1:03:08] beauty is based on being in the presence
[1:03:10] of God. Now, watch this. Now, I talked
[1:03:13] about you can be anointed without
[1:03:15] righteousness. Here's my proof. This is
[1:03:18] before humanity came in church. He says,
[1:03:20] "Thou art the
[1:03:23] anointed cherub that coverereth."
[1:03:27] He says, "And I have set thee so. Thou
[1:03:30] was upon the holy mountain of God. Thou
[1:03:33] has walked up and down in the midst of
[1:03:35] the stones of fire." So Lucifer, Satan,
[1:03:37] was the anointed angel.
[1:03:41] Anointed church. The anointed angel that
[1:03:44] that that controlled access to God.
[1:03:46] That's what he means. The cherub that
[1:03:48] covers. He controlled access to God. He
[1:03:52] had the chief position. He was the
[1:03:54] right-hand angel of all of heaven was
[1:03:57] Lucifer. Amen. And his purpose was to
[1:04:00] worship God constantly. And God says, "I
[1:04:02] have set thee." So I put you there. The
[1:04:06] anointed cherub, Satan. Okay?
[1:04:10] He says, "I established you in the top
[1:04:12] position." And Satan was right there in
[1:04:14] the presence of God. and he walked in
[1:04:16] the light of God. Now watch what
[1:04:18] happens. He says, "Thou was perfect in
[1:04:21] thy ways. Everything you did was
[1:04:24] perfect." He says, "From the day that
[1:04:27] thou was created until iniquity was
[1:04:30] found in thee." See, he was perfect
[1:04:32] until he wasn't perfect. And what made
[1:04:33] him imperfect? Iniquity.
[1:04:37] When he did what God wanted him to do,
[1:04:39] he was perfect. But there was a day
[1:04:41] where he walked in self-will, where he
[1:04:44] knew what he was supposed to do and he
[1:04:46] chose not to do it. And that was the day
[1:04:48] that perfection left him. Amen. He was
[1:04:50] perfect in his actions. He did not say
[1:04:52] he was perfect in himself, but his ways
[1:04:55] were perfect. He says, "By the multitude
[1:04:59] of thy merchandise, they have filled the
[1:05:02] midst of thee with violence, and thou
[1:05:04] hast sinned."
[1:05:05] Catch what Lucifer did. Lucifer started
[1:05:08] to use his position for personal gain.
[1:05:11] He used access to God to develop a
[1:05:15] following among the sea angels. He
[1:05:18] leveraged what he had to make himself a
[1:05:21] bigger shot than he was church. He was
[1:05:23] second only to God. Second only to God.
[1:05:26] You think how much further can you go?
[1:05:29] Well, he wanted to go further. And so he
[1:05:31] started to work in there. And it says he
[1:05:34] he says the multitude of thy
[1:05:35] merchandise. It literally means trading.
[1:05:37] So Lucifer was in there wheeling and
[1:05:40] dealing and getting political,
[1:05:42] manipulating things to try and get his
[1:05:44] own way. And what it was doing was
[1:05:46] bringing a following to him rather than
[1:05:48] a following to God. And it worked on
[1:05:50] twothirds of the angels.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Church, if it worked on angelic beings,
[1:05:58] what hope do we have without the spirit
[1:05:59] of Christ this morning? Amen. He says,
[1:06:02] "Therefore, I will cast thee out, cast
[1:06:05] thee as profane out of the mountain of
[1:06:07] God, and I will destroy thee, oh
[1:06:09] covering cherub from the midst of the
[1:06:11] stones of fire." So God took him out of
[1:06:13] his presence, the stones of fire,
[1:06:15] lighting up his very being. He took him
[1:06:18] out of everything that made him what he
[1:06:19] was. And he says, "Get out. You can't be
[1:06:21] in here." Amen. Notice that he used his
[1:06:24] position for influence, for leverage, to
[1:06:27] make a following for himself. Now, watch
[1:06:29] what watch what caused this. He says,
[1:06:31] "Thine heart was lifted up because of
[1:06:34] thy beauty, and thou hast corrupted thy
[1:06:37] wisdom by reason of thy brightness."
[1:06:41] What was Lucifer's downfall? Lucifer
[1:06:43] started looking in the mirror.
[1:06:46] Instead of recognizing what made him
[1:06:48] beautiful, he started thinking, "I'm
[1:06:50] beautiful in and of myself. Everybody
[1:06:52] knows it. Everybody says it." We're
[1:06:56] talking about an echochamber gospel. He
[1:06:58] started to believe that he was beautiful
[1:07:00] without God. Amen. He forgot that those
[1:07:03] things came from God and his
[1:07:04] completeness was only in the presence of
[1:07:06] God. He says, "I will cast thee to the
[1:07:08] ground. I will lay thee before kings
[1:07:11] that they may behold thee." So, he's
[1:07:12] cast down to earth. He could no longer
[1:07:14] reside in heaven in the presence of God.
[1:07:16] He says, now catch this. Thou hast
[1:07:18] defiled thy
[1:07:22] sanctuaries.
[1:07:25] We spoke last service very briefly on
[1:07:26] the synagogue of Satan, the temple of
[1:07:28] Satan. He says, "Lucifer, you have
[1:07:31] defiled your sanctuaries." What's a
[1:07:34] sanctuary? It's where we are. It's where
[1:07:37] the word is preached. It's where people
[1:07:39] gather to worship. He says, "You have
[1:07:41] defiled your sanctuaries."
[1:07:44] Satan has churches. Satan has
[1:07:46] sanctuaries. Satan has places of
[1:07:48] worship. And he says, "You've defiled
[1:07:50] it."
[1:07:52] What? because of your beauty.
[1:07:55] He says, by the multitude of thine
[1:07:58] iniquities.
[1:07:59] What is it that has taken those
[1:08:02] sanctuaries and made them filthy?
[1:08:05] Iniquity. What is iniquity, church? To
[1:08:08] know what to do and to refuse to do it.
[1:08:11] Iniquity, simply put, is self-will.
[1:08:14] Self-will.
[1:08:15] So Lucifer's church is consumed is
[1:08:20] defiled by self-will. by self-will.
[1:08:23] Okay,
[1:08:25] he refuses the will of God and instead
[1:08:27] he installs his own church. He says by
[1:08:31] the multitude of thine iniquities,
[1:08:33] number one, self-will. And then he says
[1:08:35] by the multitude or by the iniquity of
[1:08:38] thy traffic. That word traffic means
[1:08:41] merchandise or trade. It is a church. It
[1:08:44] is churches that are focused on self-
[1:08:47] gain.
[1:08:50] Amen. refers to making money. He's now
[1:08:53] on earth and he has churches and his
[1:08:56] program, his religion is based on money
[1:08:58] and influence to draw people to himself.
[1:09:02] He says, "Therefore, therefore, I will
[1:09:04] bring forth a fire from the midst of
[1:09:07] thee. It shall devour thee, and I will
[1:09:09] bring thee to ashes upon the earth in
[1:09:12] the sight of all them that behold thee."
[1:09:14] So, there's destruction that's
[1:09:15] prophesied, isn't it? It's a city that
[1:09:16] sits on seven hills. It's destroyed by
[1:09:18] fire in an hour. That's what the book of
[1:09:21] Revelation says. Amen. But notice it is
[1:09:23] multiple sanctuaries,
[1:09:26] one church.
[1:09:29] It's one mother
[1:09:31] many daughters. But it's the same church
[1:09:34] in the end. It's the same spirit. It's
[1:09:36] the same gospel. It's the same
[1:09:37] influence. He says, "And all they that
[1:09:39] know thee among the people shall be
[1:09:41] astonished at thee. Thou shalt be a
[1:09:42] terror." That word means horror. Thou
[1:09:44] shalt be a horror. People won't be able
[1:09:46] to believe the destruction that came to
[1:09:48] you and how fast it happened. He says,
[1:09:50] "And never shalt thou be anymore." Now,
[1:09:52] it's so easy to look at this and say,
[1:09:54] "Well, Brother John, we know what that's
[1:09:55] for. We know what church, we know what
[1:09:57] churches that are. That can never happen
[1:09:58] in our church." That can never happen in
[1:10:00] a sincere Christian church.
[1:10:04] That's a lie. That's a lie straight from
[1:10:06] Satan. Amen. Because that's not what the
[1:10:08] Bible teaches. Let's look a little
[1:10:10] closer at the root cause here and we'll
[1:10:12] push through our full thought this
[1:10:13] morning. We come to our original
[1:10:15] scripture from this morning. says, "How
[1:10:16] art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer,
[1:10:18] son of the morning? How art thou cut
[1:10:20] down to the ground which did weaken the
[1:10:23] nations?" God says, "Lucifer, look what
[1:10:24] you used to be, and look at what you are
[1:10:26] now. For thou hast said in thine heart,
[1:10:30] I will ascend unto heaven. I will exalt
[1:10:34] my throne above the stars of God. I will
[1:10:37] sit also upon the mount of the
[1:10:39] congregation in the sides of the north.
[1:10:42] I will ascend above the heights of the
[1:10:44] clouds. I will be like the most high.
[1:10:47] Now, it it reminds me of my own
[1:10:49] conversion when I was there and brother
[1:10:51] Barry Coffee was preaching down in
[1:10:52] Louisiana and under the anointing of the
[1:10:55] Holy Spirit, he said, "You think you're
[1:10:57] going to do this, but you're not. You
[1:10:59] think you're going to do that, but
[1:11:01] you're not." And what was it? It was
[1:11:03] because I was a child of God. He was
[1:11:05] stopping me in my tracks from my
[1:11:07] thinking, my I wills. And he says, "But
[1:11:09] I have an I will that's greater than
[1:11:11] your will." And what happens? because
[1:11:13] there was something inside of me, I
[1:11:15] responded to that call and he corrected
[1:11:17] me and he set me on a path towards
[1:11:18] eternity. But Satan gets caught up in
[1:11:21] the I will. And today the the the modern
[1:11:24] I will is I think
[1:11:27] because I think turns into a plan and a
[1:11:30] plan turns into an action. An action
[1:11:32] turns into a life or a lifestyle and it
[1:11:34] leads us into destruction.
[1:11:37] What did the philosopher say? I think
[1:11:38] therefore I am. Not so. Not so. But this
[1:11:42] is Satan's lie. I will, I think, I
[1:11:45] believe. Therefore, it must be true. No.
[1:11:48] Let all men's word be a lie and God's
[1:11:50] word be true. That's our that's our
[1:11:52] standard this morning. Amen.
[1:11:56] God saying here, Satan, you think you're
[1:11:58] going to do this. And you said in your
[1:12:00] heart, see, the mouth was something
[1:12:03] else. In the presence of God, he was
[1:12:04] still worshiping and praising, but in
[1:12:07] his heart, he says, I'm going to go
[1:12:08] higher than him. I'm going to take his
[1:12:10] spot.
[1:12:12] He says, "Satan was the original
[1:12:14] archangel of God. He once dwelt in
[1:12:16] heaven. He once was the greatest person
[1:12:18] in the heavens outside of God. He was
[1:12:20] God's right-hand man to fellowship and
[1:12:22] he got puffed up in his heart." And
[1:12:24] isn't that just the way that people get
[1:12:26] today? Let God just bless a fellow and
[1:12:28] put a little confidence in him and he
[1:12:29] gets to be a know-it-all. He's got to
[1:12:31] start an organization or he's got to do
[1:12:33] something that's different. He says,
[1:12:35] "Why art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[1:12:37] Lucifer?"
[1:12:38] God has a hard time trying to get
[1:12:40] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[1:12:42] stay humble and meek and stay in the
[1:12:45] place until God calls him to do
[1:12:47] something. A man that God can bless and
[1:12:50] he'll still keep himself a man, not be
[1:12:52] an angel or a God. What do we see these
[1:12:56] days? Every minister wants to be the
[1:12:59] minister, the great minister. You see
[1:13:02] it, and I'm sorry for our black people.
[1:13:04] They're calling themselves apostles and
[1:13:06] chief apostles. Apostle so and so, chief
[1:13:08] apostle so and so, church. And they have
[1:13:10] none of the works of the original
[1:13:11] apostles. They have none of the doctrine
[1:13:12] of the original apostles. But what do
[1:13:14] they do? They claim a title. They want
[1:13:15] to be big because it says first
[1:13:17] apostles. So, I've got to be first.
[1:13:20] Nobody's willing to just say, "I'm an
[1:13:22] evangelist. I'm just a pastor. I'm just
[1:13:25] a teacher."
[1:13:27] Everyone wants to be a big shot. And
[1:13:28] their goal is to be the big shot.
[1:13:31] Church, there's only one big shot, and
[1:13:32] that's Christ.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's Christ.
[1:13:35] He says as soon as man gets blessed and
[1:13:37] has a little something given to him, he
[1:13:39] wants to become a god. He wants to
[1:13:41] become an angel. He wants to become some
[1:13:43] great person. What I do, me and me and
[1:13:45] mine. He says all that. He says that's
[1:13:47] the wrong attitude. God's hunting for
[1:13:49] somebody who he could bless and pour out
[1:13:52] the blessings. And the more he bless,
[1:13:54] the literal the littleler that man will
[1:13:57] become. I say, Lord, help us to humble
[1:13:59] ourselves. If we want more of God, then
[1:14:02] there's got to be less of us. Amen.
[1:14:04] We've got to humble ourselves in his
[1:14:05] presence. He says, "And you'll never get
[1:14:08] more of God until you become nothing.
[1:14:11] You've got to belittle yourself. He that
[1:14:12] will exalt himself, God will abase. He
[1:14:15] that will humble himself, God will
[1:14:17] exalt." He says, "You've got to get
[1:14:18] little before you can get big." He says,
[1:14:21] "And you'll never be big in your own
[1:14:24] self. You'll only be as big as God will
[1:14:27] be big in you." And church, that's the
[1:14:29] heart issue. That's a pride issue.
[1:14:31] That's an ambition thing. That's an
[1:14:33] arrogance thing even is that we kill
[1:14:36] where what God can do with us by this
[1:14:39] idea of how big we can become. What will
[1:14:42] this do for me? What kind of recognition
[1:14:45] could I have? What kind of ministry
[1:14:46] could I have? What kind of influence?
[1:14:48] What kind of money?
[1:14:50] What kind of popularity? How big a
[1:14:53] church could I get? Could I have the
[1:14:55] biggest congregation in Newfoundland?
[1:14:58] Who cares? Paul had 12 in Ephesus.
[1:15:03] It's not about size.
[1:15:06] It's about a reality of the living word.
[1:15:10] It's a heart issue. Satan was an
[1:15:11] anointed angel designed to be the
[1:15:14] greatest of all angels to worship God.
[1:15:16] But over time, and we don't know how
[1:15:17] long this took. It might have been
[1:15:18] thousands. It might have been millions
[1:15:19] of years, church, something in him
[1:15:21] started to turn. And he started to see,
[1:15:24] I want to be worshiped rather than be
[1:15:26] the worshipper. I want to be served
[1:15:29] rather than serve. I want to sit in the
[1:15:32] throne rather than stand before it. And
[1:15:34] he lost his first estate because he
[1:15:36] tried to become something God never
[1:15:38] built him to be. Stay in your lane.
[1:15:43] Amen. We can't all be a great minister.
[1:15:46] Can't all be a great minister.
[1:15:49] Stay in your lane. Do what God told you
[1:15:52] to do. Work with what God has given you.
[1:15:55] Don't work with it. Let him work with
[1:15:56] it. Amen. Surrender yourself to those
[1:15:58] things.
[1:16:00] Satan thought he had more potential
[1:16:03] than what he was doing. And so he said,
[1:16:05] "I'm going to be just like God."
[1:16:09] Church, you know how good a liar Satan
[1:16:11] is? He convinced his own self.
[1:16:16] That's how good a liar he is? Is he
[1:16:18] believed his own lie.
[1:16:21] If he believed his own lie, church, like
[1:16:24] I said earlier, what hope do we have
[1:16:26] except we have the spirit of God in our
[1:16:28] lives? If he can fool himself, he can
[1:16:30] sure fool an idiot like me. Absolutely
[1:16:33] he can. We cannot fight against him with
[1:16:35] our intellect, with our heart, with our
[1:16:37] sincerity. There's only one thing
[1:16:39] that'll defeat him, and it's the pure
[1:16:40] word of Jesus Christ. It's the word of
[1:16:42] God coming out of our lips. Amen.
[1:16:45] Notice, church, he is the father of
[1:16:47] lies, and his church is built on lies.
[1:16:51] He said his goal was to sit in the
[1:16:53] congregation and be worshiped as God. We
[1:16:56] read last service in 2 Thessalonians 2.
[1:16:58] I think it was where it says that he
[1:17:00] sits as God in the temple being
[1:17:03] worshiped as God. Amen, church. He's
[1:17:07] going to get there. But the thing people
[1:17:08] don't realize is he's already there.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; He's already there. You look in
[1:17:13] Revelation 3, Christ is outside the
[1:17:15] church knocking on individual lives
[1:17:17] because the nominal Christian church has
[1:17:19] cast him out when they left the word for
[1:17:21] a a denomination, for a doctrine, a
[1:17:24] creed of their own making, their own
[1:17:26] signs, their own affirmation, their own
[1:17:27] confirmation,
[1:17:29] completely outside the church, the
[1:17:31] so-called Christian church. Amen. He's
[1:17:34] already there and people don't realize
[1:17:36] it. Why? They believed his lie. Notice
[1:17:39] notice his promise. He says, "I will be
[1:17:42] like the Most High." And what was the
[1:17:44] thing that he promised Eve? You'll be
[1:17:47] like the Most High. God knows that in
[1:17:49] your day, you'll be just like him.
[1:17:52] He offered Eve his own lie. You'll be
[1:17:55] just like God. And what does it do? It
[1:17:58] elevated Eve to a place where she could
[1:18:00] make her own decision rather than do
[1:18:02] what the word of God said. That's the
[1:18:05] trap every single time. What makes Satan
[1:18:08] a god?
[1:18:09] What makes a god a god? Worship. That's
[1:18:13] right.
[1:18:14] Worship. Satan's only way of being a god
[1:18:18] is for people to worship him. And how do
[1:18:20] we worship a person? We do what they
[1:18:23] tell us. We believe them. We act on what
[1:18:26] we say. We take their gospel. We take
[1:18:28] their word. We give them authority over
[1:18:31] our lives. That's what makes them a god.
[1:18:32] And we do that by believing and acting
[1:18:34] on what they say. We worship the one
[1:18:36] true God. How do we know we worship him?
[1:18:40] We do what he says. We do what he says.
[1:18:43] Amen. But Satan's got a gospel as well.
[1:18:45] And it's a twisted word. It is the word
[1:18:47] of God twisted.
[1:18:50] Remember, it's the word of God
[1:18:51] misplaced. Satan preaches out of a
[1:18:54] Bible, church. That's what we've got to
[1:18:56] realize. He preaches out of a Bible, but
[1:18:58] it's a twisted concept. It's a twisted
[1:19:01] gospel. Amen. And what happens is when
[1:19:03] you take that, you put the full word out
[1:19:05] and Christ goes with it because he is
[1:19:06] the word. And it's that simple and that
[1:19:08] easy. They say we're worshiping Jesus,
[1:19:10] but you don't preach his word. You can't
[1:19:11] worship him without preaching his word.
[1:19:13] It's impossible.
[1:19:15] How does Satan get us there? Self-will.
[1:19:17] It's always self-will. It's our own
[1:19:19] ideas, our own preferences, what we
[1:19:21] feel, what we want, what we think.
[1:19:23] That's the way he gets in. Amen. It's
[1:19:24] our own ease of life, our own what?
[1:19:28] Trying to get away from pain. You ever
[1:19:31] notice that? One of the things we don't
[1:19:32] want is hardship. We don't want pain. We
[1:19:34] don't want suffering. And that is the
[1:19:36] very method that God uses to produce
[1:19:38] character in our life. It's antichrist
[1:19:41] to try and run away from pain, pain
[1:19:43] avoidance. Amen. We set aside the will
[1:19:45] of God, which is his word, and Satan can
[1:19:47] step in with an alternate gospel just
[1:19:49] like that. And he says, "I will. I will.
[1:19:51] I will." And what do we do? We come to
[1:19:52] church and say, "I will. I will. I will.
[1:19:54] What I want is what I'm going to have."
[1:19:56] Amen. And listen, professing Christians
[1:19:58] declaring their own plans, their own
[1:19:59] intentions, their own ideas, and God is
[1:20:02] nowhere in it. God's nowhere in it.
[1:20:04] They've got all sorts of scriptures, but
[1:20:05] they haven't found the will of God by
[1:20:07] the full word of God. They're just
[1:20:08] cherry-picking things out. I want to ask
[1:20:11] you this morning, are we saying I will,
[1:20:14] or are we saying if the Lord wills?
[1:20:17] We make decisions every day that
[1:20:19] determine where we spend our time, our
[1:20:22] resources, our energy
[1:20:25] every single day. And we're supposed to
[1:20:27] be seeking first the kingdom of God, and
[1:20:29] everything else will be added to us.
[1:20:31] Amen. But Satan's church is built upon
[1:20:33] self- worship which is based in
[1:20:35] self-will.
[1:20:36] Listen to this. James said, "Go to now,
[1:20:38] ye that say, today or tomorrow we will
[1:20:40] go into such a city and continue there a
[1:20:43] year and buy and sell and get gain.
[1:20:45] Whereas ye know not what shall be on the
[1:20:46] moral for what is your life? It's even a
[1:20:48] vapor that appearth for a little time
[1:20:50] and then vanishes away." He says, "For
[1:20:52] ye ought to say, if the Lord will, we
[1:20:55] shall live and do this or that."
[1:20:59] James is talking about we're going to
[1:21:01] make a plan and we're going to go make x
[1:21:03] amount of dollars by doing this certain
[1:21:05] thing or that certain thing or this
[1:21:06] certain place or finding this certain
[1:21:08] market or this certain opportunity and
[1:21:10] when we get that money we're going to do
[1:21:11] this and this and this and it's going to
[1:21:12] be a wonderful time. We're going to get
[1:21:15] exactly what we were looking for. He
[1:21:17] says, "What are you doing?" He says,
[1:21:18] "Jon, you don't even know if you're
[1:21:19] going to be alive tomorrow. Life is just
[1:21:21] a vapor here today, gone tomorrow, blown
[1:21:24] away in a moment." He says, ' But you
[1:21:27] ought to say if the Lord will, we shall
[1:21:31] be alive just to do it, much less do
[1:21:35] what we're going to do.
[1:21:37] Let me talk to you business owners.
[1:21:40] Is your growth strategy your will or
[1:21:42] God's will?
[1:21:45] Is how you put your resources to work
[1:21:47] your will or God's will? Is the amount
[1:21:50] of time you commit your will or God's
[1:21:53] will? Is God looking for you to grow
[1:21:55] spiritually or grow commercially?
[1:21:58] Because usually they offset each other.
[1:22:01] You can't grow without more time, more
[1:22:03] effort, more resources. Naturally
[1:22:05] speaking, you don't just grow by doing
[1:22:07] nothing. You got to put more in to get
[1:22:09] more out. Is it God's will or is it your
[1:22:12] will? Are we looking to build it bigger
[1:22:16] or are we looking to build it just the
[1:22:17] way God would have us to build it? And
[1:22:19] that's not just for our business owners.
[1:22:20] It goes for every single employee that's
[1:22:22] here. Am I trying to go all the way or
[1:22:25] am I trying to go God's way? Because
[1:22:28] every opportunity is not God's
[1:22:29] opportunity. The grass is not always
[1:22:31] greener on the other side, but it's
[1:22:33] Lord, what would you have me to do?
[1:22:35] Where would you have me to go? How big
[1:22:38] can I handle it? There are some people
[1:22:40] can't handle money. You don't want to
[1:22:43] make 200,000 bucks a year because you
[1:22:45] can't handle it. And God knows you can't
[1:22:47] handle it. Some people got to give them
[1:22:49] a million dollars and it wouldn't
[1:22:51] matter. they'll do the right thing with
[1:22:53] it. Some people can barely handle 50.
[1:22:57] It's a hard issue. God knows our
[1:22:59] weaknesses. God knows our strengths. God
[1:23:00] knows what we can handle. But the thing
[1:23:02] is when we get into I will rather than
[1:23:04] if the Lord wills, that's when we get
[1:23:05] into trouble. Amen. Much craves more.
[1:23:07] Have you ever noticed that? Used to be
[1:23:10] if you made $100,000 a year, you had it
[1:23:12] set. Now the number is 150. Pretty soon
[1:23:14] it's going to be $200,000 a year. Much
[1:23:16] craves more because everyone wants a
[1:23:18] lifestyle.
[1:23:20] Well, I'm going to get this. I'm going
[1:23:22] to get that. I'm going to be here by
[1:23:23] this time, by that time. If the Lord
[1:23:24] wills and desires, that's what we ought
[1:23:26] to be conditioning that with. Amen,
[1:23:28] church. If the almighty dollar is the
[1:23:30] head of our life, then almighty God's
[1:23:31] got to go someplace else. That's for
[1:23:33] sure. And the world is serving the
[1:23:35] almighty dollar these days. Where's our
[1:23:37] contentment?
[1:23:39] Where's our contentment? Where's our
[1:23:40] What's our motivation?
[1:23:42] What are we scrambling for day in and
[1:23:44] day out? Is it to make a resurrection
[1:23:46] and a rapture, or is it to make a
[1:23:48] dollar? Because if you make a dollar,
[1:23:50] you're going to get a dollar.
[1:23:52] But that's all you'll have when it's all
[1:23:53] said and done. He says, "But now you
[1:23:56] rejoice in your boastings." In another
[1:23:58] uh in another um
[1:24:02] Bible, it says, "You boast and brag
[1:24:04] about what you're going to achieve." He
[1:24:07] says, "God's not in it."
[1:24:10] He says, "All such rejoicing is evil."
[1:24:15] He says, "Therefore, to him that knoweth
[1:24:17] to do good and doeth it not, to him it's
[1:24:19] sin." And this is the literal uh
[1:24:21] definition of iniquity. Amen. It's
[1:24:23] Satan's church being built on self-will.
[1:24:25] To know to do good and not to do it,
[1:24:27] that's sin. That's iniquity. What
[1:24:29] replaces God's will? Our will. Satan's
[1:24:32] church is built on self-will. He says it
[1:24:35] was Satan's ambition to be worshiped
[1:24:36] like God. He took twothirds of the stars
[1:24:38] of heaven, ascended himself above those
[1:24:40] stars, and preached to them and deceived
[1:24:42] twothirds of them. Notice that's his
[1:24:44] ambition. He says, "And now he is ready
[1:24:46] with his carefully selected, educated
[1:24:49] bride by his own knowledge, all painted
[1:24:52] up in his deceit of big buildings, big
[1:24:55] denominations, and paints of knowledge
[1:24:57] and theology, and smart and intellectual
[1:24:59] and educated to deceive the whole world
[1:25:02] and become a god." Notice the phrasing
[1:25:04] he's using there, painted up. That's
[1:25:06] contrasted with anointed because when
[1:25:08] you anoint, it saturates you.
[1:25:12] It completely covers you. But painting
[1:25:14] up is a pretense.
[1:25:17] With anointing comes power. With
[1:25:18] painting up comes deceit.
[1:25:21] You're painted up to make people think
[1:25:24] you're more than you are. I don't know
[1:25:27] if you've ever seen these things where
[1:25:29] somebody has a picture with makeup and
[1:25:31] without.
[1:25:32] But I remember seeing one that was it
[1:25:34] was quite horrible.
[1:25:36] I mean, this woman looked like she she
[1:25:38] was on crack.
[1:25:40] Most of her teeth were missing. big bags
[1:25:43] under eyes, scraggly hair, all this
[1:25:44] other thing. And when she was done,
[1:25:48] she looked pretty good. She had false
[1:25:50] teeth. Her lips went from thin lin
[1:25:53] leather thin leatherly things to full.
[1:25:57] She had color. Her skin didn't sag. She
[1:26:00] had pulled her skin tight. I don't know.
[1:26:02] I didn't know you could do that, but she
[1:26:03] did it. She hid every flaw.
[1:26:07] But I tell you one thing, the man that
[1:26:09] married her and woke up the next morning
[1:26:11] without her makeup would have died and
[1:26:13] thought he had gone to hell because she
[1:26:16] was not what she pretended to be.
[1:26:19] Painted up.
[1:26:21] What is it? Trying to look like a real
[1:26:24] church.
[1:26:27] No anointing.
[1:26:29] No anointing.
[1:26:31] No presence of the Holy Spirit. He says
[1:26:33] that's what he's done. all heading up
[1:26:36] into the person of the antichrist which
[1:26:37] is already crowned the vicor of God by
[1:26:39] his worldly loving scientific bride all
[1:26:43] dressed up in pomp of intellectuality
[1:26:45] and religious education. He says she is
[1:26:48] made religious like him and by his own
[1:26:50] interpretation of the word as he did Eve
[1:26:53] and as his son Cain did. Christ has a
[1:26:57] bride. Christ has a bride. Revelation
[1:27:00] shows us she makes it all the way
[1:27:01] through. But Satan has a bride too. Now,
[1:27:05] she's not a bride. She's a
[1:27:07] Scripture clearly calls her a But
[1:27:09] his s Christ Christ has a church bride.
[1:27:12] And Satan has a church bride.
[1:27:16] And she's the mother of all harlots.
[1:27:18] Every evil thing is in her. Every
[1:27:20] filthiness,
[1:27:21] every iniquity,
[1:27:23] everything you can do wrong is in that
[1:27:25] woman, that church. Amen. Christ is the
[1:27:29] word. So, his bride will have to be a
[1:27:31] word bride. Satan is the father of lies
[1:27:34] and iniquity. So his church will have to
[1:27:36] be the church of lies and iniquity. The
[1:27:38] church of lies, twisted word, and
[1:27:41] self-will. Amen.
[1:27:44] It's always the word being used to
[1:27:46] manipulate people. We'll see later, not
[1:27:49] in this service, but in other, it's a
[1:27:50] nickelian spirit that tries to control.
[1:27:53] Satan took his position, his authority,
[1:27:55] his influence, and he used it to create
[1:27:56] his own church. And watch God's response
[1:27:58] to this now. He says, "Yet thou shalt,"
[1:28:00] He said, "I will ascend. I will be above
[1:28:03] the stars. I will be like the most
[1:28:04] high." God says, "Yet thou shalt be
[1:28:06] brought down to hell to the sides of the
[1:28:08] pit, not in the sides of the north, on
[1:28:10] the mount of the congregation. You'll be
[1:28:12] down in the pit." He says, "They that
[1:28:14] see thee shall narrowly look upon thee,
[1:28:16] and consider thee, saying, Is this the
[1:28:18] man that made the earth to tremble, that
[1:28:19] did shake kingdoms?" In the end, we're
[1:28:21] going to look at Satan. He's going to be
[1:28:22] some little pipsqueak.
[1:28:25] He's fallen from his first estate and
[1:28:27] under all of those trappings, he's
[1:28:28] turned into a miserable little shrew of
[1:28:30] a man. We're going to look at him and
[1:28:32] say, "Really? That's what I was scared
[1:28:34] of? That's what I was worried about?
[1:28:36] That's what was fighting me? If I knew
[1:28:38] that, I'd have kicked him out a long
[1:28:40] time ago.
[1:28:42] Look at them today in the way you're
[1:28:44] going to see them, church, and it'll
[1:28:45] give you courage for the battle today."
[1:28:47] If you can look on them narrowly then,
[1:28:49] you should be able to look on them
[1:28:50] narrowly today and say, "You have no
[1:28:51] power in my life. You got no right to be
[1:28:54] here. He says that made that made the
[1:28:57] earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms
[1:28:58] that made the world as a wilderness and
[1:29:00] destroyed the cities thereof that opened
[1:29:03] not the house of his prisoners. He says
[1:29:06] all of the kings of the nations even all
[1:29:07] of them lie in glory. Everyone in his
[1:29:09] own house. All the natural kings they
[1:29:11] they're lying in glory in their tombs.
[1:29:13] They're being honored. He says but thou
[1:29:15] are cast out of the grave like an
[1:29:17] abominal branch.
[1:29:19] You got something in the grave. He says,
[1:29:20] "You throw it out before you put the
[1:29:22] person in." That's what you're like.
[1:29:23] You're the thing they throw out of the
[1:29:24] grave. He says, "As the raignment of
[1:29:27] those that are slain." When somebody's
[1:29:29] killed, what happens? They're all laying
[1:29:30] in the dirt and the muck and the filth
[1:29:32] and there's blood and guts and gore all
[1:29:34] over them. He says, "That's what you
[1:29:35] are." He says, "Thrust through with a
[1:29:37] sword that go down to the stones of the
[1:29:39] pit as a carcass trotten under feet." He
[1:29:42] says, "But thou shalt not be joined with
[1:29:44] them in burial because thou hast
[1:29:45] destroyed thy land and slain thy
[1:29:48] people." Notice it's a destructive
[1:29:50] gospel. It destroys the people that
[1:29:53] believe it. Amen. His church is
[1:29:54] destructed. His gospel is destructive.
[1:29:57] He destroys his own people. You look
[1:30:00] around and you see people that have been
[1:30:01] destroyed. But see, we tend to look at
[1:30:03] those that are destroyed by drugs and
[1:30:05] alcohol and all these different things,
[1:30:07] these habits. But this is a people that
[1:30:09] are killed spiritually.
[1:30:12] He says, "Thy the seed of evildoers,
[1:30:15] evil do evildoers shall never be
[1:30:17] renowned. prepare slaughter for his
[1:30:19] children for the iniquity of their
[1:30:20] fathers that they do not rise nor
[1:30:22] possess the land nor fill the face of
[1:30:24] the world with cities. There's one that
[1:30:26] will arise and possess the land. It's
[1:30:27] not him. But he'll try and bluff you out
[1:30:30] of it. He says, "For I will rise up
[1:30:32] against them, sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[1:30:34] and cut off Babylon the name and remnant
[1:30:37] and son and nephew, sayeth the Lord."
[1:30:39] Babylon the natural is a type of Babylon
[1:30:41] the spiritual, and it's going to be
[1:30:42] destroyed in a moment. He says, "I will
[1:30:45] also make it a possession for the bitter
[1:30:47] and pools of water, and I will sleep it
[1:30:49] with the besome of destruction." You
[1:30:51] know what a besum is? It's a broom. The
[1:30:54] broom of destruction, sayeth the Lord of
[1:30:56] hosts. It's a reference. You see, I
[1:30:58] think it's a in in the book of Matthew
[1:31:00] where John's talking about Jesus, he
[1:31:01] says he's going to come and he's going
[1:31:02] to burn the chaff with fire. What does
[1:31:05] the broom do? It puts the chaff all in
[1:31:07] one place and then he lights it with
[1:31:08] holy fire. It's the destruction of those
[1:31:11] that are separated out from the real
[1:31:13] wheat. It's the false churches.
[1:31:16] He says, "The Lord of Hosts has sworn,
[1:31:18] saying, "Surely as I have thought, so
[1:31:20] shall it come to pass. And as I have
[1:31:22] purposed, so it shall stand." See, Satan
[1:31:24] thought and he purposed, and he said, "I
[1:31:25] will." And God says, "I'm sorry." But
[1:31:27] that doesn't stand. What stands is what
[1:31:29] I say. What I think becomes a word. And
[1:31:31] what my word says is what happens. You
[1:31:34] can stand here all day long, Satan, and
[1:31:35] say, "I will. I will. I will." But
[1:31:37] what's going to happen is the Lord's
[1:31:38] will. The Lord's will is going to have
[1:31:40] dominion. He says, "Then I will break
[1:31:43] the Assyrian in my land and upon my
[1:31:44] mountains, tread him underfoot. Then
[1:31:46] shall his yoke depart from off them and
[1:31:48] his burden depart from off their
[1:31:49] shoulders." This is really pointing to
[1:31:51] the millennium of perfect rest and peace
[1:31:53] where there's no war. He says, "This is
[1:31:54] the purpose that is purposed upon the
[1:31:56] whole earth." See, Satan's got a
[1:31:58] purpose, but God says, "I've got a
[1:31:59] bigger purpose. I've got a law. I've got
[1:32:01] a word that stands above it, and this is
[1:32:03] the hand that is stretched out upon all
[1:32:05] the nations. This is God's true
[1:32:07] intention. He says, "For the Lord of
[1:32:09] hosts has purpose, and who shall disanol
[1:32:11] it? And his hand is stretched out, and
[1:32:13] who shall turn it back?" We're preaching
[1:32:16] on an echochamber gospel. And it's very
[1:32:19] easy for people to say, "Yes, that's
[1:32:21] true. I believe it, but that's not my
[1:32:22] church."
[1:32:25] But we have to see what identifies the
[1:32:27] sanctuary or the synagogue of Satan.
[1:32:29] Because it's easy to look at a church
[1:32:31] and you see the sincerity of the people,
[1:32:33] you see the commitment to the people.
[1:32:35] You see the even the passion, the gifts
[1:32:38] and you say that is a true godly church.
[1:32:41] But the test of Christianity is not
[1:32:43] sincerity. It's not gifts. It's not
[1:32:47] feelings and emotions.
[1:32:49] What is the test of Christianity?
[1:32:52] Will you stay with the word? Always has
[1:32:55] been, always will be. Why? Because we
[1:32:57] can be sincerely wrong. Sincerity won't
[1:32:59] get you there. If you're sincere about
[1:33:01] following the word of God, God will lead
[1:33:03] you into truth. But if you're sincere
[1:33:06] about doing what you want the word of
[1:33:07] God to say, God has no obligation
[1:33:09] because you're led by your own whims,
[1:33:11] your own desires. The test of
[1:33:13] Christianity is always, will you stay
[1:33:14] with the word of God? Look at what Jesus
[1:33:16] said. He says, "Then said Jesus to those
[1:33:18] Jews which believed on him."
[1:33:22] He didn't say, "You got it." He said,
[1:33:24] "If you continue in my word, then are
[1:33:28] you my disciples indeed." It's an if
[1:33:29] then statement. It's used in software.
[1:33:31] If there's a certain condition meant,
[1:33:33] then something's going to happen or
[1:33:34] something is. And he says, "If you
[1:33:36] continue in my word," that word continue
[1:33:39] means abide. The literal translation is
[1:33:41] if you abide in my word. If you get in
[1:33:44] my word and you stay in my word, you
[1:33:46] stay with my word. That's when you're
[1:33:49] really my disciples. It's not when you
[1:33:50] believed, it's when you abide.
[1:33:53] Lots of people believing, not many
[1:33:55] people abiding today. Why? You got to
[1:33:57] put your very life into the living word.
[1:34:00] It's into Christ. It's a journey. It's a
[1:34:02] constancy. It's a daybyday abiding in
[1:34:05] Christ.
[1:34:07] That's what makes us his disciple. Amen.
[1:34:09] And that requires, church, the person of
[1:34:11] Christ,
[1:34:13] not just the letter. It requires the
[1:34:15] spirit. That's the life. That's the only
[1:34:17] way you can abide. To abide, you have to
[1:34:19] be alive. And 1 Corinthians 12 says
[1:34:21] there's only one way to abide in him and
[1:34:23] that's by one spirit. You are baptized
[1:34:25] into that body. It's not a creed. It's
[1:34:27] not a doctrine. It's not a message. It's
[1:34:28] not a prophet. It is the living word
[1:34:30] Jesus Christ living inside of you. Amen.
[1:34:33] I know people that have chased and I'm
[1:34:36] related to some of them that have chased
[1:34:39] every gift, every new ministry, every
[1:34:41] new movement
[1:34:44] seeking something.
[1:34:46] And you know where they are today?
[1:34:48] sitting at home doing nothing. It did
[1:34:51] nothing for them. They were in the
[1:34:53] laughing revival. They were in the
[1:34:54] rolling revival. They were in the
[1:34:56] shouting revival. They were in the
[1:34:57] tongues revival. They were in this
[1:34:58] revival and that one. Year after year,
[1:35:00] decade after decade, sincere as all get
[1:35:03] out, but seeking something that would
[1:35:05] satisfy and hold them when they left the
[1:35:08] church, when they went home. And what do
[1:35:11] they have today? They're great citizens,
[1:35:14] wonderful people.
[1:35:17] and so far outside the word of God, they
[1:35:19] don't know which way is up or down. It's
[1:35:21] a shame. It's a shame. Why? Because
[1:35:24] they're seeking something that'll make
[1:35:25] them feel good,
[1:35:28] that'll satisfy their intellectuality to
[1:35:30] make them feel the elite, special,
[1:35:32] something to hold on to rather than
[1:35:34] something that would hold them. Church,
[1:35:36] I can't hold myself. I need something
[1:35:39] holding me. And that's only Christ, the
[1:35:40] word living inside of me by the Holy
[1:35:42] Spirit. They were looking for a
[1:35:44] community. I remember in Edmonton I I
[1:35:47] was I was traveling a lot with a sales
[1:35:49] manager and we were working together. He
[1:35:51] was sales. I was technical. We were a
[1:35:53] good team. Had a lot of good talks and
[1:35:54] chats. And we were coming back from Fort
[1:35:56] McMurray one day and he says he said,
[1:35:58] "John," he says, "what, you go to
[1:35:59] church." He says, "What kind of church
[1:36:01] do you have?" He says, "My wife and I
[1:36:03] were looking for a new church." So I
[1:36:04] didn't tell him what kind of church we
[1:36:05] had. I said, "Why are you looking for a
[1:36:06] new church?" He says, "Because they had
[1:36:08] a drag show at our church last week."
[1:36:11] I said, "That's horrible. You do need a
[1:36:13] new church." I says, "What do you want
[1:36:14] in a new church?" She says, "I want a
[1:36:15] community of good people." I said,
[1:36:17] "Don't come to our church."
[1:36:21] You say, "Why did you say that, Brother
[1:36:22] John?" I said, "Because we're not a
[1:36:24] community of good people." I said,
[1:36:26] "We're a group of people that take the
[1:36:29] word of God above everything else and we
[1:36:31] live by it in our day-to-day lives." We
[1:36:33] are not a community. There are people
[1:36:35] looking for community. Church, we're not
[1:36:38] a community.
[1:36:39] It comes with it by God's grace. But if
[1:36:42] you're coming for community, all you'll
[1:36:43] get is community. But I said, what we do
[1:36:46] is we focus on the word of God as the
[1:36:48] full authority in our lives. I said, if
[1:36:51] you want that, come to our church. But I
[1:36:54] said, if you're just looking for some
[1:36:55] nice people, I said, there's better
[1:36:56] churches for you.
[1:37:00] That's what I said. He never did come.
[1:37:05] Why?
[1:37:06] He wasn't looking to abide with Christ.
[1:37:08] He was looking to hang around with good
[1:37:09] people.
[1:37:11] All that is is dead religion, church.
[1:37:13] It's death, self-will. It's self-deceit.
[1:37:16] Won't do good. Won't do a good thing for
[1:37:18] you except make you a good citizen on
[1:37:20] this fallen earth. Lots of good, sincere
[1:37:22] Christians and they're dead in their
[1:37:25] trespasses because they won't take the
[1:37:26] full word. We can't We think it can't be
[1:37:29] in our midst. We think I there's no way
[1:37:31] that church is that way or this church
[1:37:33] is that way. But look at Jesus now. He's
[1:37:35] talking to the priests of that day. He's
[1:37:37] talking to the ministry. He says, "This
[1:37:40] people drawth nigh unto me with their
[1:37:41] mouth and honorth me with their lips,
[1:37:44] but their heart is far from me. They're
[1:37:46] saying the right thing. They're doing
[1:37:47] the right thing, but on the inside,
[1:37:49] they're not really for me." He says,
[1:37:51] "But in vain they do worship me,
[1:37:54] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:37:56] of men." Notice their worship is
[1:37:58] sincere,
[1:38:00] but it is in vain. He didn't say,
[1:38:03] "You're not worshiping." He said, "Your
[1:38:04] worship is not accepted." He's not
[1:38:07] talking to atheists. He's talking to
[1:38:09] professing believers and he says their
[1:38:11] worship is in vain. The literal meaning
[1:38:13] there is serves no purpose. It is folly.
[1:38:16] It is futility. And then it says it is
[1:38:18] the hollowess that occurs when humanity
[1:38:21] supplants divine instruction. In other
[1:38:24] words, the hollowess that comes when we
[1:38:26] take away God's word and we put in our
[1:38:28] own.
[1:38:30] That's what their worship is. He didn't
[1:38:32] say it wasn't worship. He says it has no
[1:38:34] impact on God. It's not even received.
[1:38:38] Why church? He's not there. He left the
[1:38:42] building. When they left the word,
[1:38:43] Christ went with it. That's where he is.
[1:38:46] He's outside the door. Kabot is written
[1:38:48] over the door. The glory of the Lord has
[1:38:50] departed. He's no longer there. Amen. In
[1:38:53] other words, it doesn't do anything for
[1:38:55] God and it has no effect on God because
[1:38:57] they're not worshiping him. They're
[1:38:59] worshiping a God of the word that they
[1:39:01] preach, which is a twisted gospel, which
[1:39:04] is a satanic gospel.
[1:39:06] I know this is hard this morning, but
[1:39:09] it's your Bible. It's your Bible. The
[1:39:12] Bible's hard. Remember we said, "Few
[1:39:14] there be that find the way. Many go.
[1:39:18] Broad is the way that leadth to
[1:39:19] destruction." The way, listen, people
[1:39:22] think they're going to heaven and
[1:39:23] they're going to hell. And that's the
[1:39:25] majority. That's what the scripture
[1:39:28] says. That's what the scripture says.
[1:39:30] Amen. What happens? He says, "You've
[1:39:32] replaced the word with your own
[1:39:34] doctrine, your own commandments, your
[1:39:36] own idea of spirituality, your own proof
[1:39:38] of what makes you a Christian, your own
[1:39:40] signs, your own wonders, your own
[1:39:41] preferences.
[1:39:45] They've got their own god of their own
[1:39:46] making, and he's a pretended God. And
[1:39:48] there's only one pretended God, and
[1:39:49] that's Satan. God has left the building.
[1:39:52] He's outside the church. They threw him
[1:39:53] out."
[1:39:55] Jesus would continue and say this.
[1:39:58] Now he's speaking to the Pharisees.
[1:40:01] Okay? Why do you not understand my
[1:40:04] speech? He says, "Even because you
[1:40:06] cannot hear, you cannot understand my
[1:40:08] word. You are of your father, the
[1:40:13] devil."
[1:40:15] He says, "And the lust of your father ye
[1:40:18] will do." What is the lust of Satan? I
[1:40:21] will. I will. I will. It's to elevate
[1:40:25] yourself above God. Okay. Self-will and
[1:40:30] it stops at nothing to achieve what it
[1:40:32] wants and it'll destroy anything that
[1:40:33] gets in its way. He said he was a
[1:40:35] murderer from the beginning.
[1:40:38] Who's the original murderer?
[1:40:41] Cain. Was Cain a worshipper?
[1:40:44] Yeah. Cain brought his sacrifice to the
[1:40:47] altar
[1:40:48] and it was
[1:40:51] excellent.
[1:40:53] You know what? It wasn't accepted.
[1:40:57] It's not about excellence. It is about
[1:41:00] giving what God wants you to give.
[1:41:03] That's it. There's only one accepted
[1:41:06] place of worship. We've heard the
[1:41:08] message. There's only one accepted place
[1:41:10] of worship and that is under the shed
[1:41:13] blood. Amen. It's the bleeding word.
[1:41:17] It's the only place. Amen.
[1:41:20] He says he was a murderer from the
[1:41:22] beginning and abode not in the truth.
[1:41:24] Remember he says if you abide in me, if
[1:41:26] you continue in me, he says he didn't
[1:41:29] abide in me. He abodeed not in the truth
[1:41:31] because there is no truth in him.
[1:41:32] There's nothing in him to receive it. He
[1:41:34] says when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh
[1:41:36] of his own for he is a liar and the
[1:41:39] father of it. Satan's message, Satan's
[1:41:42] gospel is a lie. It's a gospel, but it's
[1:41:44] a false gospel. It's not based on the
[1:41:47] it's it's based on the word. That's the
[1:41:50] subtlety of it. That's the scariness of
[1:41:52] it. is he's preaching out of the same
[1:41:54] Bible I'm preaching out of this morning,
[1:41:56] but it's twisted. Remember, we read that
[1:41:58] quote last service. A word misplaced
[1:42:01] changes the whole picture. One word.
[1:42:04] Satan changed one word. He added one
[1:42:07] word. Thou shalt not.
[1:42:11] Satan tried, you know, Satan tried to
[1:42:13] preach the gospel to Jesus. It is
[1:42:16] written. It is written. And how did
[1:42:18] Jesus defeat him? He used the full word.
[1:42:22] It is also. It is also. And what was
[1:42:25] Jesus? What was his offer? Remember, he
[1:42:27] offered Jesus three things. He offered
[1:42:29] him self- glory. Prove yourself. Right?
[1:42:32] He offered him self-preservation. Throw
[1:42:35] yourself off and save yourself. And then
[1:42:37] he offered him pain avoidance. If you
[1:42:39] worship me, I'll give you all the
[1:42:40] kingdoms and you don't have to die.
[1:42:42] Self- glory, self-preservation, personal
[1:42:45] gain. That's the gospel of Satan.
[1:42:50] church. Look at who Christ is talking
[1:42:51] to. He's talking to church members. He's
[1:42:54] talking to ministers. He's talking to
[1:42:56] the Pharisees. Remember we preach
[1:42:57] Pharisee means set aside. They were the
[1:42:59] supposed elite church members. They were
[1:43:01] the best of the best of the church.
[1:43:05] They would be the brother Gerald's and
[1:43:07] the brother Bobs and the brother Marks,
[1:43:08] the elders of the church. The best of
[1:43:10] the best.
[1:43:12] Couldn't lay a finger on their lives.
[1:43:13] Perhaps that's who he's talking to.
[1:43:16] sincere by all appearances.
[1:43:20] By all appearances. Amen. And they
[1:43:23] they'd say, "Listen, we're Abraham's
[1:43:24] children. We are the direct descendants
[1:43:27] of the elected of God."
[1:43:31] And he says, "Sorry, you're of your
[1:43:33] father, the devil." Because you're doing
[1:43:35] the works of the devil. You're doing the
[1:43:37] works of Cain, not the works of Abraham.
[1:43:39] He says, "You are like whited sephilers,
[1:43:41] whited tombs." He says, "You're all
[1:43:43] glowing and clean on the outside and
[1:43:45] full of dead men's bones on the inside."
[1:43:47] Church members,
[1:43:50] sincere people,
[1:43:54] people that were raised right, taught
[1:43:55] right, sincere, at least on the outside,
[1:43:57] living separated lives. And yet they had
[1:43:59] believed a lie. And they were preaching
[1:44:01] their own gospel. Remember when Jesus
[1:44:03] preached, they said, "He's not like the
[1:44:06] ministers that preach without
[1:44:08] authority."
[1:44:11] They had no authority. It was all up
[1:44:13] here. It was all reasoned. It was all I
[1:44:15] will. It was all drawing people to them.
[1:44:16] It was all blinding people. It was a
[1:44:19] blind leading the blind. I don't know if
[1:44:21] you noticed this. Blind people don't
[1:44:22] have a whole lot of authority.
[1:44:24] They don't because they can't go
[1:44:25] anywhere. Can't do anything without
[1:44:27] somebody else leading them.
[1:44:30] We read this last service. Not everyone
[1:44:31] that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
[1:44:33] enter into the kingdom of heaven. But
[1:44:35] who will? He that doeth the will of my
[1:44:38] father which is in heaven. So that
[1:44:40] spirit of Satan didn't just start in the
[1:44:42] gentile church. It started right back in
[1:44:45] the Jewish church. It started with Cain.
[1:44:48] And if we had time, we won't this
[1:44:49] morning. It went from Cain to Nimrod.
[1:44:51] And it came all the way up through all
[1:44:53] those different generations. And what
[1:44:55] was it? It was a spirit of self-will.
[1:44:57] What I do, God will accept. The way I do
[1:45:01] it will preserve us, will save us, will
[1:45:03] keep us, give us influence.
[1:45:06] And every single time, what did it end
[1:45:08] up in? Destruction. Destruction.
[1:45:10] Destruction.
[1:45:12] Then it comes down. See, the thing is,
[1:45:15] Satan in his raw form is easy to
[1:45:16] discern.
[1:45:19] Nobody's sitting around saying drugs are
[1:45:20] great. Even those that use them don't
[1:45:23] say they're great. They see the raw
[1:45:26] element of Satan in drugs.
[1:45:30] less so maybe in alcohol, smoking, these
[1:45:32] different things. But in the raw form,
[1:45:34] Satan's easy to see because you can see
[1:45:35] the destruction that follows. You don't
[1:45:37] have to look very far. But it's the
[1:45:38] subtle Satan that we're wondering about
[1:45:41] because he comes in a religious form and
[1:45:43] it's always been a religious form. It's
[1:45:45] those two vines, remember, that are
[1:45:46] growing side by side and you're trying
[1:45:47] to figure out which one is which. We
[1:45:50] know the obvious. I trust nobody in here
[1:45:53] is smoking and drinking and doing drugs
[1:45:54] and cussing and doing all those things.
[1:45:56] We know we've been taught. We ought to
[1:45:59] know better. We ought not to be doing
[1:46:01] those things. But it's the subtlety that
[1:46:03] we've got to be looking out for because
[1:46:04] Satan comes, remember, as an angel of
[1:46:07] light with supposed revelation.
[1:46:10] And that's what's going to trip us up.
[1:46:12] And it's always tied to what our flesh
[1:46:14] enjoys or our natural inclinations.
[1:46:17] Catch that now. It's not always about
[1:46:19] enjoyment. Sometimes it's about what we
[1:46:20] don't enjoy. And we say, "Well, that's
[1:46:22] of God." It may or may not be. Depends
[1:46:25] what the word says. Listen, some things
[1:46:27] I just don't like because I don't like
[1:46:29] them. Has nothing to do with me being a
[1:46:31] Christian. I just don't like them. And
[1:46:32] we can take that and we can project it
[1:46:34] and that can be satanic because we turn
[1:46:36] it into a part of our belief system and
[1:46:38] we start putting people in and out or up
[1:46:40] and down based on what they think about
[1:46:41] that certain thing. Paul says this. He
[1:46:45] says, "But what I do, that will I do
[1:46:47] that I might cut off occasion from them
[1:46:49] which desire occasion that wherein they
[1:46:51] glory they may be found even as we."
[1:46:53] Makes no sense. Let me give you it. It
[1:46:56] says, "But I'm going to continue to do
[1:46:58] what I'm doing." This is Paul now. He
[1:47:00] says, "I want to contradict the claims
[1:47:02] of the people who want to be treated
[1:47:04] like they are the same as us because of
[1:47:06] what they brag about." These are
[1:47:08] self-professed apostles that said we
[1:47:11] were part of the original group.
[1:47:14] He said they want to be treated like
[1:47:16] those of us that really are apostles. He
[1:47:18] says, "And it's based on what they say,
[1:47:21] not what other people are saying about
[1:47:22] them. It's a self-affirming gospel. I'm
[1:47:27] an apostle. I'm this. I'm that. I have
[1:47:29] this ministry. I have this gift. He says
[1:47:30] it's all about what they're saying about
[1:47:32] themselves. He says, "For such are
[1:47:36] they're apostles, all right, but they're
[1:47:38] false apostles." He says they're
[1:47:40] workers, but they're deceitful workers
[1:47:42] transforming themselves into the
[1:47:45] apostles of Christ. He says, "And no
[1:47:47] marvel, for Satan himself is transformed
[1:47:51] into an angel of light." He says,
[1:47:53] "Therefore, it's no great thing. It's no
[1:47:54] big surprise if his ministers, his
[1:47:58] ministers
[1:48:01] also be transformed as the ministers of
[1:48:04] righteousness, whose end shall be
[1:48:07] according to their works." He says,
[1:48:08] "Listen, Satan can appear as an angel of
[1:48:10] light, as an angel of revelation." He
[1:48:13] says, "So, it's no wonder his ministers
[1:48:14] are going to come in behind and they're
[1:48:16] going to be preaching a gospel that
[1:48:17] seems to be light, that seems to be
[1:48:19] liberty, that seems to be good, that
[1:48:22] seems to be righteous, all of these
[1:48:23] things." He says, "But their end shall
[1:48:25] be according to their words." What do
[1:48:27] they do? They sow the wind and they reap
[1:48:28] a whirlwind. It grows into something
[1:48:31] that destroys them. But what do they do
[1:48:33] in the meantime? They're gathering
[1:48:34] people and influence and money and
[1:48:36] popularity and all these things. Three
[1:48:37] men's, three things get a minister.
[1:48:39] Money, women, popularity. And you know
[1:48:41] what happens to virtually all of these
[1:48:42] ministers? They fall to women, money,
[1:48:44] and popularity. They fall to their own
[1:48:46] gospel. It's a shame. It seems like
[1:48:49] every week now we've got one more
[1:48:51] bigname preacher falling by the wayside.
[1:48:54] Money, women, popularity. Why? Cuz
[1:48:57] that's what they've been preaching. And
[1:48:59] they're reaping what they're sowing.
[1:49:01] They're reaping the destructive nature
[1:49:02] of their false gospel. What a shame.
[1:49:05] What a slap in the face.
[1:49:09] Listen to this. Shall a trumpet be blown
[1:49:12] in the city? Satan has his ministers.
[1:49:13] Keep that in mind. Shall a trumpet be
[1:49:15] blown in the city and the people not be
[1:49:17] afraid? And shall there be evil in a
[1:49:19] city and the Lord has not done it? He
[1:49:21] says, "Surely the Lord God will do
[1:49:23] nothing, but he revealth his secret unto
[1:49:26] his servants, the prophets." And we
[1:49:28] said, "Amen."
[1:49:31] But listen to this. He says, "The lion
[1:49:33] hath roared. Who will not fear? The Lord
[1:49:36] God has spoken. Who can but prophesy? So
[1:49:39] this is the spirit of the Lord speaking
[1:49:40] through Amos. And it equates a lion
[1:49:43] roaring to a man prophesying.
[1:49:47] In other words, the preaching of the
[1:49:49] word, the prophesying of the word is a
[1:49:52] lion roaring. That's what it means.
[1:49:54] That's what it it represents. It
[1:49:56] represents these ministers, these gifted
[1:49:58] men, these called men, these anointed
[1:50:00] men. But Brown would say, "John went
[1:50:02] forth as a roaring lion. He was a
[1:50:04] preacher." But watch now how Satan comes
[1:50:07] because Peter says, "Be sober, be
[1:50:09] vigilant, because your adversary, the
[1:50:11] devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about
[1:50:14] seeking whom he may devour." So Satan
[1:50:17] comes as a roaring lion. He is not the
[1:50:19] roaring lion. Christ is the lion of
[1:50:21] Judah. He's the one that roars. He's the
[1:50:23] one that people fear. But Satan comes in
[1:50:25] mimicking a lion. He is not a lion, but
[1:50:28] he's trying to pretend he's a lion. And
[1:50:30] he does it as a roaring lion. He does it
[1:50:32] what? preaching his gospel.
[1:50:36] He comes with his ministers trying to
[1:50:39] preach a different word than what Paul
[1:50:42] preached. Amen. Christ has a five-fold
[1:50:45] ministry according to the book of
[1:50:46] Ephesians chapter 4, I believe. And
[1:50:48] guess what? Satan's got his own
[1:50:50] five-fold false ministry as well, in
[1:50:52] every one of those positions. False
[1:50:54] prophets, false pastors. Buck talk the
[1:50:57] scripture talks about false pastors,
[1:51:00] apostles. Paul just talked about them.
[1:51:02] Evangelists and false teachers.
[1:51:04] Absolutely. We see it all throughout
[1:51:06] scriptures. We see it all throughout
[1:51:08] today. Amen. They're roaring out. Thus
[1:51:10] sayeth the Lord. They're roaring out.
[1:51:11] This is what the word says, but they're
[1:51:13] not preaching a full word. They're
[1:51:15] preaching a partial word or a twisted
[1:51:17] word, a misplaced word, but they're
[1:51:19] preaching the word. That's what I want
[1:51:21] you to catch this morning. Amen. What is
[1:51:23] it? It's just like those prophets of
[1:51:24] Ahab. They sold themselves out for
[1:51:27] influence and willingly accepted a lying
[1:51:29] spirit. And they are anointed,
[1:51:33] but they're false vessels.
[1:51:35] And it produces the very thing they're
[1:51:37] talking about. They're preaching, but
[1:51:40] it's not the word of God. It's a gospel
[1:51:42] of lies. It's a misplaced word, as we
[1:51:44] read last service. And some of it is so
[1:51:46] close to the truth. It's so close, but
[1:51:49] it doesn't quite get there. And that's
[1:51:51] where the fall always happens. He says
[1:51:54] the devil's gone about like a roaring
[1:51:56] line falsely accusing and impersonations
[1:52:00] falsely accusing. You know what Paul
[1:52:02] said? He says in the way that is called
[1:52:05] heresy worship by God.
[1:52:08] People are saying Paul you're in a cult.
[1:52:14] Guess what? They say the same thing
[1:52:16] today.
[1:52:17] Why? Because they're trying to get
[1:52:19] mainstream to be the gospel. And it's
[1:52:22] not never will be, never has been. Many
[1:52:25] are called, few are chosen, few there be
[1:52:27] that find the way to eternal life. It's
[1:52:29] a small group. It's going to be called
[1:52:32] heresy. That's scriptural. It's going to
[1:52:35] be called heresy. It's not going to be
[1:52:36] what everybody's preaching, what
[1:52:37] everybody's believing. Why? Because
[1:52:39] they've had 2,000 years of the gospel
[1:52:41] being twisted and manipulated by a
[1:52:44] self-willed spirit that's produced
[1:52:46] 30,000 Christian denominations that take
[1:52:49] the name of Christ, but he's not in
[1:52:51] their midst. He doesn't provide for
[1:52:52] them. He doesn't lead them. He doesn't
[1:52:54] guide them. They've just claimed his
[1:52:55] name. Scripture says they're going to
[1:52:57] come, seven women will come in that day
[1:52:59] to a man and they're going to say,
[1:53:00] "Listen, we don't want anything from you
[1:53:02] except your name to take away our
[1:53:03] reproach." And the scripture never says
[1:53:05] he gave it. They took it. They took it.
[1:53:09] He never gave his name. He gives his
[1:53:11] name to his bride. But they take it and
[1:53:14] they say, "We are his bride as well."
[1:53:15] They're not. They've taken his name.
[1:53:17] They've stolen it. It's blasphemous
[1:53:19] names. As we've talked a little bit
[1:53:20] about last service, what's the result of
[1:53:23] all this? Religious people, sincere
[1:53:27] people deceived.
[1:53:29] That's it. Foolish virgins. Virgins, but
[1:53:34] foolish because they don't have the oil.
[1:53:36] They don't have the Holy Spirit. We'll
[1:53:38] see how we get there as we start to
[1:53:40] close this morning. Listen to this.
[1:53:43] This know also that in the last days
[1:53:46] perilous time shall come. Are we in the
[1:53:48] last days? Are we in the last days? If
[1:53:52] we're in the last days, this is our
[1:53:53] scripture. Okay, notice it says perilous
[1:53:56] times shall come. That word perilous
[1:53:58] means fierce, dangerous, difficult,
[1:54:01] violent, furious, hard to bear.
[1:54:06] That's what we're dealing with. Does it
[1:54:08] seem like life is speeding up?
[1:54:11] Things are just happening one after
[1:54:13] another. Dominoes are falling quickly.
[1:54:15] The world is falling apart.
[1:54:18] And we know it. We see it day by day.
[1:54:19] The news is filled with it. People's
[1:54:22] hearts are full of fear. I can't believe
[1:54:24] speaking with co-workers how fearful
[1:54:26] they are. And the thing is they've
[1:54:28] caught what's happening. They just don't
[1:54:30] understand the root cause. But they see
[1:54:32] it falling. They see it breaking, don't
[1:54:34] they, brother Matt? And you talk to them
[1:54:36] and you're not scared. And they're
[1:54:37] wondering why you're not scared. I ain't
[1:54:39] going to be here. This world is not my
[1:54:42] home. I'm just the passing through.
[1:54:44] Hallelujah. We're not worried about it.
[1:54:47] Brother Joe, I hope you don't mind me
[1:54:48] repeating you. He said, "Bring it on.
[1:54:51] Let's get this over with so we can get
[1:54:53] out. Let everything crash and burn. Let
[1:54:55] them take our businesses, take our
[1:54:57] employment, take our money, take our
[1:54:58] houses. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. We're
[1:55:01] ready to get out of here."
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, let that be our heart's
[1:55:04] cry. Not what can I build up for
[1:55:06] tomorrow, but my house is waiting for
[1:55:08] me."
[1:55:11] Too often we're looking for tomorrow in
[1:55:13] this world rather than tomorrow in his
[1:55:15] presence.
[1:55:17] Shake ourselves.
[1:55:19] Shake ourselves this morning, church.
[1:55:22] What's going to make this last day
[1:55:23] perilous? For men shall be lovers of
[1:55:28] thems of their own selves. They're
[1:55:31] selfish. They're led by self-will. It's
[1:55:33] the original sin, self-will.
[1:55:38] It carries on to his church. They'll be
[1:55:40] covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:55:43] disobedient to parents, unthankful,
[1:55:45] unholy, without natural affection,
[1:55:47] trucebreakers, false accusers,
[1:55:49] incontinent, fierce, despisers of those
[1:55:51] that are good, traitors, heady,
[1:55:53] high-minded, lovers of pleasure more
[1:55:56] than lovers of selves. And we'd say,
[1:55:58] "Look, Brother John, I know a bunch of
[1:55:59] people like that. I'm surrounded by
[1:56:01] neighbors that are like this. It's
[1:56:03] obvious, Brother Joe, Brother John,
[1:56:04] we're here. We're here. We're here."
[1:56:08] But watch who these people are.
[1:56:12] He says, "Having a form of godliness.
[1:56:15] These are churchgoers."
[1:56:18] That's not the world. The world's always
[1:56:19] been like that. He says, "The perilous
[1:56:21] times is because in the church, you're
[1:56:23] going to have people just like this,
[1:56:29] having a form of godliness, but denying
[1:56:32] the power thereof." He says, "From such
[1:56:35] turn away. Turn away." They're church
[1:56:37] people. professing Christians, he says,
[1:56:39] and they've got something that looks a
[1:56:41] little bit like godliness, but they
[1:56:43] don't have godliness. Why? Because
[1:56:45] they've denied the power of God.
[1:56:49] What do you do when you deny the power
[1:56:50] of God? You take his word and you
[1:56:52] explain it away.
[1:56:55] You explain it away. Amen. What is it?
[1:56:58] You tell people what they want to hear
[1:57:01] rather than what they need to hear. And
[1:57:04] you take away the power. People come in
[1:57:06] and what do we do? We pat him on the
[1:57:07] back and we say, "God loves you just the
[1:57:08] way you are." Yes, he does. That's why
[1:57:09] he wants to change you. But we say, "God
[1:57:12] loves you the way you are. Just sit in
[1:57:13] the church." Church, we're not looking
[1:57:15] for people to sit in the church. We're
[1:57:17] looking for people to go in glory with
[1:57:19] us. That we can shake hands over this
[1:57:21] word of God and let that be our
[1:57:22] fellowship, not just a community of good
[1:57:24] people. Amen. They have a portion of
[1:57:26] what looks like a Christian life, but
[1:57:28] it's only a portion. It's just a form.
[1:57:29] It's a shell. It's a hollow shell.
[1:57:32] Remember, we said that's what their
[1:57:33] worship is. It's the hollowess that that
[1:57:36] remains when humanity supplants divine
[1:57:39] instruction. It's a hollow shell.
[1:57:40] There's no life in it. But it's
[1:57:43] something.
[1:57:45] It's something.
[1:57:47] He says it's a pretense because they
[1:57:49] have no power. They can't overcome
[1:57:51] themselves. So, they can't preach an
[1:57:52] overcoming message. In other words,
[1:57:55] church, they cannot preach the true
[1:57:56] baptism of the Holy Spirit because they
[1:57:58] won't get it themselves. How can you
[1:58:01] preach what you don't have?
[1:58:03] They're preaching a gospel that lets
[1:58:04] them sit right where they stand in that
[1:58:07] moment in that day. What's a new birth?
[1:58:09] It's to die out to self. And you rise a
[1:58:12] new creation in Christ because you have
[1:58:15] his spirit living in you rather than
[1:58:17] your old spirit. That's what a new birth
[1:58:19] is. It's a dying out. But they can't die
[1:58:21] out. Therefore, they cannot have a new
[1:58:22] birth. They can preach they've got the
[1:58:25] Holy Ghost all day long because they
[1:58:26] went shabba daba daba doo. And guess
[1:58:29] what? That ain't it.
[1:58:32] because they've never been changed. They
[1:58:34] just had a tongue that's been loosed.
[1:58:36] It'll never do it. It'll never do it.
[1:58:40] Amen. It's the Holy Spirit that makes us
[1:58:42] Christlike,
[1:58:44] not some church doctrine or creed. So,
[1:58:46] what do they choose? They choose the
[1:58:47] creeds and doctrines that affirm where
[1:58:49] they're at rather than where the word's
[1:58:50] trying to get them to be. He says, "For
[1:58:53] of this sort are they which creep into
[1:58:55] houses and lead captive silly women
[1:58:59] laden with sins and led away with
[1:59:01] divers's lust." Now remember, a woman
[1:59:03] always represents a church. So these are
[1:59:05] people, ministries that come in and they
[1:59:08] find people that have the same desires
[1:59:10] as they have. And so they say, "Let's
[1:59:12] build a church. Let's start a church.
[1:59:14] Let's plant a seed." And what do they
[1:59:17] do? They build up something that's
[1:59:19] completely surrounded by self-will.
[1:59:21] God's not in it.
[1:59:24] What? Late him with sins and led away
[1:59:27] with lusts.
[1:59:29] Me, me, me. I will. I will. I want. I
[1:59:31] want. I want. I think. I think. That's
[1:59:34] what this church is built on. Amen. And
[1:59:36] it's consumed by them. I saw one guy the
[1:59:38] other day. His dad is a very well-known
[1:59:40] prosperity gospel preacher. And so he
[1:59:42] got up in front of his church. He says,
[1:59:43] "This is what I believe the Lord wants
[1:59:44] for this church." And he put up a
[1:59:45] multi-million dollar private jet.
[1:59:49] God's not looking for multi-million
[1:59:50] dollar private jets for his ministers.
[1:59:53] But what is it? He's got the spirit of
[1:59:55] his natural father who has the spirit of
[1:59:57] his spiritual father consumed by lusts.
[2:00:01] He wants to be what his daddy was.
[2:00:04] Look at what happens. He says they are
[2:00:06] ever learning. They're educated. They're
[2:00:08] intellectual. They're religious. But
[2:00:11] they are governed by self. And he says,
[2:00:12] "And because of this, they are never
[2:00:14] able to come to the knowledge of the
[2:00:17] truth." Close with this. He says, "And
[2:00:20] again, it is religious sin as at the
[2:00:23] beginning that is so deceitful." He
[2:00:25] says, "Watch it now. It's not just
[2:00:26] purely old everyday sin, committing
[2:00:28] adultery and getting drunk and using
[2:00:30] God's name in vain." He says, "That's
[2:00:31] not it. No, the harlot, she isn't going
[2:00:33] to be disappointed there." He's pointing
[2:00:34] to the end time. She knows where she's
[2:00:37] going. The drunkard isn't going to be
[2:00:38] disappointed there. The bootleger, the
[2:00:39] gambler, the liar, the thief. He's not
[2:00:41] going to be disappointed. He says, "But
[2:00:43] the man that thinks he's right." He
[2:00:46] says, "That's the disappointment."
[2:00:49] He says, "That's that fellow that will
[2:00:50] come and say,"Lord, haven't I preached
[2:00:52] the gospel? Have I not cast out devils
[2:00:54] in thy name?" And Jesus said, "Depart
[2:00:56] from me, you that work iniquity. I never
[2:00:58] knew you." He says, "There's the
[2:01:00] disappointment." See that deceitfulness?
[2:01:04] We're going to talk about that a little
[2:01:06] bit in the next service about how it
[2:01:08] comes in and how Satan weasles his way
[2:01:10] in by group think and self-affirmation.
[2:01:12] We'll see how he got into the New
[2:01:14] Testament church to the point where it
[2:01:15] drove Christ completely out of their
[2:01:18] lives and churches.
[2:01:20] Church, we need to be aware
[2:01:23] of where we're at,
[2:01:26] what we believe.
[2:01:28] that we're not just part of some message
[2:01:30] community, some Bible community, some
[2:01:32] Christian community, but that we've had
[2:01:35] our hearts changed,
[2:01:37] our lives have been reborn. Amen. That
[2:01:40] there's something on the inside that
[2:01:41] echoes this, not just something that we
[2:01:44] produced. Amen. God bless you this
[2:01:46] morning.
[2:01:48] You know, as I'm preaching this,
[2:01:51] because we identify the systems, not the
[2:01:54] people, the systems are what's wrong.
[2:01:56] Let's stand together if we would.
[2:01:58] We look at that and we think that we
[2:01:59] can't be fooled. But church, there are
[2:02:02] areas of our life where if we have
[2:02:04] self-will, Satan jumps right in there
[2:02:06] and he'll fool us time and time and time
[2:02:09] again. Amen. It's not the obvious that's
[2:02:11] going to hurt us anymore. It's the
[2:02:12] things that aren't so obvious. Amen. And
[2:02:14] it'll be a religious spirit that comes
[2:02:16] in and starts patting us on the back and
[2:02:17] saying, "Hey, you can do this. You know
[2:02:20] this. You know that. You're good enough
[2:02:22] for this. You're good enough for that.
[2:02:23] You can handle this. You can handle
[2:02:24] that. It's only one time. you know, all
[2:02:27] these different things and it comes in
[2:02:28] and what does he do? He plays on what
[2:02:30] God has done in our lives and that lets
[2:02:33] us take authority to ourselves to go
[2:02:35] contrary to what the word of God would
[2:02:36] say, what the spirit of God would say.
[2:02:39] Look at Satan's message today. It's all
[2:02:41] about self-affirmation.
[2:02:43] I listened to a guy,
[2:02:46] just a short clip, and he said, "We
[2:02:49] don't preach much of Paul anymore."
[2:02:52] He said, "Cuz Paul is my friend." You
[2:02:53] know what a friendmy is? It's a friend
[2:02:56] that's your enemy. It's like they're
[2:02:57] half friend, half enemy. And he said,
[2:03:00] "Paul is my friend because he says hard
[2:03:03] things in the worst possible way.
[2:03:07] This is a preacher,
[2:03:10] a homosexual, of course."
[2:03:14] And he says, "We don't preach Paul very
[2:03:15] much here anymore." He says, "And only
[2:03:17] in select areas where it's very clear
[2:03:20] what he's talking about." The funny
[2:03:22] thing is everything he says is clear.
[2:03:24] you just don't like it. And so what is
[2:03:26] it? Satan has come in on that man and
[2:03:28] he's patted him on the back and he says,
[2:03:30] "Hey, you're good. You desire to serve
[2:03:33] God. You're a minister of the gospel.
[2:03:35] You're getting up behind that pulpit.
[2:03:37] You're good the way you are. Don't worry
[2:03:38] about what that says,
[2:03:41] church. Every word.
[2:03:44] Every word.
[2:03:47] It's got to be every word or it ain't
[2:03:49] the word." I say, Lord, help us to apply
[2:03:52] the word in every part of our lives.
[2:03:56] Every part, not just the part the church
[2:03:58] sees, not just Sunday mornings and
[2:04:01] Wednesday nights, but let every part of
[2:04:04] our life be subject to his word. Amen.
[2:04:07] This isn't about a healthy lifestyle.
[2:04:11] There's hardship that comes with
[2:04:13] Christian living. It's not about
[2:04:15] community because it comes and goes.
[2:04:16] I've been there, done that.
[2:04:19] It's not about wealth. That's for sure.
[2:04:22] It's not about influence, not about
[2:04:24] popularity, but it's about one thing.
[2:04:26] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[2:04:29] light unto my path. The word of God has
[2:04:32] the preeminence and the spirit of God in
[2:04:33] us will make it live every time. Amen. I
[2:04:36] say, Lord, help his word to be the
[2:04:38] preeminence in our lives. Not some
[2:04:40] gospel that makes us feel good. Remember
[2:04:43] I said last service I said the antidote
[2:04:46] to this type of a spirit is to go to a
[2:04:48] church where the minister steps on your
[2:04:49] toes on a regular basis. Why? Because
[2:04:51] God chasens those he loves. He corrects.
[2:04:53] He teaches. And then he disciplines if
[2:04:55] we don't listen. Amen. If we're sitting
[2:04:57] at at home, if we're doing our own thing
[2:04:59] and preaching our own gospel to
[2:05:01] ourselves, church, that's never going to
[2:05:02] get us anywhere. We've got to go where
[2:05:04] God can correct us. He can teach us. He
[2:05:07] can help us to get where we need to go.
[2:05:09] Amen.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; God's grace to us. Let's bow our heads.
[2:05:12] Heavenly Father,
[2:05:15] Lord, you know my heart, Lord. It's not
[2:05:18] to preach hard,
[2:05:20] Lord. But your truth is a double-edged
[2:05:22] sword. It cuts going in and it cuts
[2:05:25] coming out,
[2:05:27] Lord. But if we'll take it,
[2:05:30] it'll cut us in a way, Lord, that allows
[2:05:33] us to recover easily, Lord. It's clean,
[2:05:36] Lord. It's when we fight. It's when we
[2:05:38] twist. It's when we try and get away
[2:05:39] from it, that's when things get ugly.
[2:05:41] But Lord, when we can take the
[2:05:43] simplicity of your word and just let it
[2:05:45] be applied to our life, that's where the
[2:05:46] victory is, heavenly father. Lord, we
[2:05:49] don't want to shape your word to
[2:05:50] ourselves, but we want to be shaped by
[2:05:51] your word. Lord, we don't want to have a
[2:05:53] form of godliness. Lord, we want to be
[2:05:55] the mystery of godliness. Lord, it's
[2:05:57] Christ living in us. Lord, you're our
[2:06:00] hope and you're our glory. Lord, I pray
[2:06:02] you take these simple words, a simple
[2:06:04] message this morning, Lord, that you
[2:06:06] would quicken our hearts, Lord, not to
[2:06:08] look away, not to look outside, not to
[2:06:11] point to somebody else, Lord, but to
[2:06:12] recognize that these are perilous times
[2:06:14] and Satan is trying to get in. Lord, I
[2:06:17] pray you help us to check up this
[2:06:19] morning, Lord. That our lives will be
[2:06:21] lost in you, that we would abide in you
[2:06:23] day by day, Lord, as we continue in your
[2:06:25] word. Bless your people, Lord. Bless
[2:06:27] those that have come out this morning,
[2:06:29] set aside their day, Lord, their energy,
[2:06:32] Lord, to just come out and hear this
[2:06:33] simple gospel. Lord, I pray you'd just
[2:06:35] pour out upon them a special blessing
[2:06:37] each one. In Jesus Christ's name we pray
[2:06:39] it. Amen.
[2:06:44] The potter's hand 1273.
[2:06:50] Beautiful
[2:06:53] Lord,
[2:06:55] wonderful Savior.
[2:06:58] I know for sure
[2:07:01] that all of my days are held in your
[2:07:07] hands
[2:07:09] and crafted into
[2:07:12] your perfect
[2:07:16] land.
[2:07:19] Oh, you gently call me
[2:07:23] into your presence,
[2:07:27] guiding me by
[2:07:30] your Holy Spirit.
[2:07:34] Teach me, dear Lord,
[2:07:37] to live all my life
[2:07:41] through
[2:07:42] your
[2:07:44] eyes.
[2:07:47] And I'm captured by
[2:07:51] your holy calling.
[2:07:55] Set me aart.
[2:07:58] I know you're calling
[2:08:02] me to yourself.
[2:08:05] For me, Lord, I pray.
[2:08:14] Won't you take me,
[2:08:19] hold me,
[2:08:22] use me,
[2:08:26] fill me.
[2:08:29] I give my life
[2:08:32] to the potter's
[2:08:36] hand.
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:42] So call me,
[2:08:46] guide me,
[2:08:50] lead me, walk beside
[2:08:54] me.
[2:08:56] I give my life
[2:08:59] to the father's
[2:09:03] hands.
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:08] Beautiful
[2:09:11] Lord,
[2:09:13] wonderful Savior
[2:09:17] I know for sure.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Held in your hands,
[2:09:27] crafted into
[2:09:30] your perfect
[2:09:34] plan.
[2:09:37] You gently call me into your presence,
[2:09:44] guiding me by
[2:09:47] your Holy Spirit.
[2:09:51] Teach me, dear Lord,
[2:09:54] to live up my life
[2:09:58] through
[2:09:59] your
[2:10:01] eyes.
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:04] I'm captured by
[2:10:08] holy calling
[2:10:12] me.
[2:10:14] I know you're drawing
[2:10:18] me to yourself.
[2:10:22] Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[2:10:31] Oh, take me,
[2:10:35] hold me,
[2:10:39] use me,
[2:10:42] build me.
[2:10:45] I give my life
[2:10:49] to the potter's
[2:10:52] hand.
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:58] Won't you call me?
[2:11:02] Guide me,
[2:11:05] lead me, walk beside
[2:11:10] me.
[2:11:13] My life
[2:11:15] to the potter's
[2:11:19] hands.
[2:11:23] You know, our assurance is
[2:11:26] not in our church attendance that we
[2:11:28] know the truth.
[2:11:30] We've heard the truth. Our assurance is
[2:11:32] that the scripture says that spirit
[2:11:34] would deceive the very elect if it were
[2:11:37] possible.
[2:11:38] In other words, it is impossible.
[2:11:41] But it's not because of us. It's because
[2:11:43] the word is already declared. We're
[2:11:45] going to make it. Amen. How? Because as
[2:11:48] he is the word, so are we the word.
[2:11:50] We're a word bride. We'll stay with the
[2:11:52] word no matter what. We may have our
[2:11:53] little dips.
[2:11:55] We may have our moments. Amen. But
[2:11:58] because we're his children, because
[2:11:59] we're his bride, he always brings us
[2:12:01] back to his word. That's why we can't be
[2:12:04] deceived. We're in his hands. Not in my
[2:12:06] hands. It's not my will. It's not my
[2:12:08] strength. It's not by trying or
[2:12:10] entrusting as we sing. Amen. But it's
[2:12:12] that he has elected us to make it
[2:12:14] through. That's our assurance. We're a
[2:12:17] people that resonate with the word to
[2:12:19] the point where we are the mystery of
[2:12:21] godliness revealed as Paul would say.
[2:12:23] Amen. We're going to sing that song.
[2:12:25] More of you, more of you. 759. Turn it
[2:12:28] over to brother Bob here. Amen. God
[2:12:30] bless you. Remember Cherylyn Piery?
[2:12:32] Amen. That's been weighing on my heart.
[2:12:35] And uh Atlanta talked to her a couple
[2:12:38] times and said, "Hey, we'll pray. We'll
[2:12:39] pray." But she hadn't hadn't really come
[2:12:41] back, but it's getting to a place where
[2:12:43] she needs it. Amen. So we're going to
[2:12:46] just trust the Lord. Commit it into his
[2:12:47] hands. Amen. Whoever would close
[2:12:49] service, please remember to pray for
[2:12:51] her. Amen. This condition of scaraderma,
[2:12:54] she's got it's a sentence of death.
[2:12:57] Amen. But when Jesus comes,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; every power is broken,
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; every chains unlocked,
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; disease defeated. Amen. If she could
[2:13:09] only come in where his word is preached
[2:13:10] and lay hold by faith. Amen. I believe
[2:13:13] she'd be cleansed every bit. So, let's
[2:13:15] remember her in prayer. Let's sing this.
[2:13:16] Amen. Let's sing it as a prayer.
[2:13:20] Amen. I've had a lot of things. I need
[2:13:21] more of him. Amen. Less of me, more of
[2:13:25] him, less of life, less of ambition,
[2:13:29] less of thinking about my future, and
[2:13:31] just more of him today. Amen. That'll
[2:13:34] get us through. Let's sing it.
[2:13:38] Oh, more
[2:13:40] of you.
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:46] more of you.
[2:13:53] I've had it all,
[2:13:57] but what I need is more
[2:14:02] of you.
[2:14:07] All things
[2:14:09] I
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:14] But yet
[2:14:16] I heartless
[2:14:22] empty and
[2:14:25] Lord hear my pray for
[2:14:31] you.
[2:14:36] Lord of you.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:43] Lord
[2:14:45] of you.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:52] [Music]
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; But what I need is more
[2:14:59] of you.
[2:15:02] Amen.
[2:15:04] things I have my will. Amen. But yeah,
[2:15:13] I hunger
[2:15:16] still.
[2:15:17] Hallelujah.
[2:15:19] Let me
[2:15:23] hear my prayer
[2:15:26] for Lord
[2:15:28] of you. I sing that again. One more
[2:15:32] hymn.
[2:15:33] All of you.
[2:15:37] Hallelujah.
[2:15:43] You
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; I
[2:15:51] but what I need
[2:15:55] is more of you. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[2:16:00] Granted, Lord Jesus.
[2:16:03] I've had my will.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; But yet
[2:16:11] I hunger
[2:16:13] still
[2:16:17] empty and
[2:16:20] Lord hear my prayer
[2:16:24] for all of you.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; I need you Lord. I need you right now.
[2:16:35] It's 11:29.
[2:16:40] I need you, Lord.
[2:16:43] I need you, Lord,
[2:16:47] right now.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen, Father.
[2:16:53] I need you, Lord.
[2:16:56] I need you, Lord.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:00] Yes, Lord. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:17:05] I lift my hands.
[2:17:08] I bow my knees
[2:17:11] to worship at your throne.
[2:17:20] I need you, Lord.
[2:17:24] I need you, Lord. I praise you for
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord.
[2:17:32] I need you, Lord,
[2:17:36] right now.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[2:17:53] I lift my hands and I bow my knees
[2:18:00] to worship at your throne.
[2:18:08] I need you Lord.
[2:18:12] I need you Lord right now.
[2:18:19] You know, it says in in the book of
[2:18:20] Revelation,
[2:18:22] he said that we're rich. The world is
[2:18:25] rich increased with goods and has need
[2:18:27] of nothing. But if you have everything,
[2:18:29] there's one thing you do need, and
[2:18:30] that's more of him.
[2:18:33] More of God. Praise the Lord. Let's sing
[2:18:38] 9:15.
[2:18:40] Greater is he that's in me than he
[2:18:43] that's in the world.
[2:18:46] On the day of Pentecost,
[2:18:51] a mighty rushing wave,
[2:18:56] it blew into the upper room and baptized
[2:19:02] all of them. Amen.
[2:19:06] With a power gater than
[2:19:11] any earthly form.
[2:19:15] I'm so all right. I've got it now. I'm
[2:19:20] going to let the whole world know. Amen.
[2:19:25] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:19:30] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:19:34] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:19:40] is in. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:19:43] Oh, Satan light a rolling throwing
[2:19:49] to and from
[2:19:53] seeking whom he may divine.
[2:19:57] The Bible tells me so.
[2:20:02] Many souls have been prayed to fall in
[2:20:08] some rec.
[2:20:11] What God has promised us today
[2:20:16] is overcoming
[2:20:18] power.
[2:20:21] And greater is he that is in.
[2:20:24] Hallelujah.
[2:20:26] And greater is he that is in me.
[2:20:30] And greater is he that is in me than he
[2:20:35] that is in him. Satan like a roaring
[2:20:38] lion. Oh, Satan, like a roaring line,
[2:20:44] roaming to and fro,
[2:20:49] seeking whom he may devour.
[2:20:53] The Bible tells me so.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:02] If all is so we come
[2:21:07] but God has promised us today his
[2:21:12] overcoming
[2:21:14] power.
[2:21:16] Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:21] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:21:26] Greater is he that is Hallelujah.
[2:21:30] than he that is in the world.
[2:21:34] And greater is he.
[2:21:38] Amen.
[2:21:40] Greater is he that is in me.
[2:21:44] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:21:50] is in the world. Let's sing it to Let's
[2:21:52] sing it again. Greater is he that is in
[2:21:56] me.
[2:21:58] Greater is heal.
[2:22:01] Hallelujah.
[2:22:03] Greater is he that is Hallelujah
[2:22:07] than he that is in the world.
[2:22:13] Amen. I think it's 794.
[2:22:16] It's you're all I want.
[2:22:20] Yeah, that's it. Is in times like these,
[2:22:24] it's him we should be desiring. And
[2:22:26] again, as more and more of him, we want
[2:22:29] to be drawn so close to him that that
[2:22:32] people will see Christ in us. They'll
[2:22:35] know we've been with God.
[2:22:38] Amen.
[2:22:40] Draw me close to you.
[2:22:44] Amen.
[2:22:48] Never let me.
[2:22:52] [Music]
