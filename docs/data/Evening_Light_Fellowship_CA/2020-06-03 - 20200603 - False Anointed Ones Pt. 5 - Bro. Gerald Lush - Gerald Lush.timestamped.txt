[38:52] the Lord is here with us that he with
[38:55] you is with me amen just think a man
[38:58] yeah if they made him a Trinity because
[39:02] because of father son Holy Ghost
[39:04] what would they make him if he knew that
[39:06] he was in all of us a man that that I'm
[39:11] the son yeah there did his daughters and
[39:13] so on you're his sons and so on so
[39:15] praise the name of the Lord so thank God
[39:18] for the revelation of God thank God for
[39:21] the personal experience with God amen to
[39:24] God be the glory
[39:25] so the Lord bless and go ahead to see
[39:29] our brother Chad I'm glad to see him
[39:31] we're here amen and our brother Joshua
[39:35] Lord bless your brother amen and or
[39:39] praying grace to brother Annika and
[39:41] sister Rebekah of the family and the
[39:43] Lord blessed them that maybe we'll have
[39:45] some fellowship with him for too long
[39:47] but I'm praying that his brother Bob
[39:49] mentioned praying the grace of God well
[39:52] according to the will of God to change
[39:54] the circumstances situation so we can
[39:57] get everybody back in the church again a
[39:59] man and when we know what we know the
[40:03] promise is where two or three are
[40:04] gathered together there am I in the
[40:07] midst and again in the original it is
[40:09] where I have gathered two or three is
[40:12] not where two or three decided on
[40:14] themselves but where he gathered them
[40:15] and there he is in the midst a man
[40:19] praise the Lord
[40:20] so we're trusting easier with the few of
[40:22] us that have gathered tonight a man so
[40:25] the Lord be with us and again praying
[40:28] Lord according to your will regard
[40:33] what's going on regardless of what's
[40:35] called regarding what's going on I have
[40:38] talked to the Lord about it why had the
[40:41] Lord permitted this why did the Lord
[40:43] permit that well the Lord told me I want
[40:48] explain at all but the Lord did remind
[40:51] me says son he said you were thinking on
[40:54] these things and you've taught thought
[40:57] on it before concerning well how is this
[41:00] going to happen how is that going to
[41:02] happen
[41:02] how is this prophecy going to be
[41:04] fulfilled considering that what the
[41:06] world is like considering what all the
[41:08] nations are like and considering what
[41:10] all the people are like Lord this is
[41:14] going to happen I understand wants to
[41:15] explain what it was not on maybe in
[41:18] private sometime but and the Lord said
[41:22] well son now you see now you know that
[41:25] why I'm allowing this is what for is to
[41:29] bring the people into into that into
[41:31] that attitude and so on bring them under
[41:34] that influence and not only the people
[41:36] but the nations a man so he's going to
[41:39] bring in the nations all down on the
[41:41] same level as it were so that he there's
[41:44] other things that in Scripture that II
[41:46] that he will fulfill the prophecy that
[41:49] he will bring the pass and brother for
[41:51] it to happen these things had got to be
[41:53] going on in the world oh yes this guy is
[41:56] he's got to so I said yes Lord
[41:59] thank you I said I was wondering how you
[42:01] were going to do it now I know how
[42:03] you're gonna do it by what by it's God
[42:06] permitting this exactly and again that's
[42:10] why that's why that there's a reason why
[42:14] we find that there's there's the true
[42:16] anointed ones out of what the BIOS be
[42:18] self also minded once because certainly
[42:20] in the last days and the prophet of God
[42:22] said the anointing is not false
[42:24] he said the teaching is and and again
[42:27] why would God permit that under under a
[42:30] true anointing and yet the teacher be
[42:33] false it's for a reason God permits it
[42:36] all for a reason brother God knows what
[42:39] he's doing
[42:40] again don't wonder he said in Isaiah
[42:42] ibly 55 he said my thoughts are not
[42:45] yours and he said my ways are not yours
[42:47] and he says I as the heavens are above
[42:49] the earth so are my ways and my thoughts
[42:51] above yours and that is the absolute
[42:54] truth brother we just got to believe God
[42:57] is looking for us to believe not to
[42:59] understand this understand that but to
[43:02] be
[43:02] leave it a man what God has spoken in
[43:05] his in his word and what God is doing
[43:07] how God is doing it why would God permit
[43:10] this why would God permit that is for a
[43:11] reason
[43:12] amen and again not my will that I be
[43:15] done
[43:16] a man so listen listen believe it
[43:19] brother and again Lord we would we would
[43:21] love to get the church all back again
[43:24] it's true it's frustrating for the
[43:27] ministry and no doubt it's frustrating
[43:29] for the people to have to endure these
[43:32] things and we pray the grace of God to
[43:34] the to the ministry and brethren around
[43:36] the world that's got to endure this and
[43:39] it's hard especially some that AB
[43:41] churches and used to churches of two
[43:43] three four five hundred people and now
[43:45] the only ministry to ten people in the
[43:48] church or maybe a few people in the
[43:50] church so brother I pray the grace of
[43:52] God be with those ministering brother
[43:54] amen and the grace of God be with us
[43:56] that will endure a man to endure on to
[44:01] the end and and I believe although this
[44:04] is going to happen don't worry they
[44:06] don't know don't think you know that we
[44:08] won't blame the devil God permitted it
[44:10] and when it comes to the prophesy
[44:13] concerning the false Christ and so on
[44:16] why did God for it false Christ
[44:18] a true anointing but a false teaching
[44:20] for a reason
[44:22] it's all for a reason a man so we leave
[44:25] all that with the Lord so the grace of
[44:27] God be with us brother as we go again
[44:30] into the word and we pray that the Lord
[44:32] will have his way the will of God be
[44:34] done and mother I pray God that he
[44:37] administered through the ministry if
[44:39] he's only got a few in the in the
[44:41] congregation your ministers through the
[44:43] ministry and not only that by those that
[44:45] are hearing the word will receive it the
[44:48] way God wants them to receive it a man
[44:50] then we were to receive what God has got
[44:53] there for you by the grace of God a man
[44:56] so I listen faith comes by hearing
[44:59] hearing by the word a man so you want
[45:02] faith you got to hear the word and don't
[45:04] hear it in your head it in your heart by
[45:07] the grace of God you've got to hear the
[45:09] spiritual revelation that Evan but at
[45:11] the near not ears then in that Anthony
[45:14] or hear what the Spirit is
[45:16] saying to the church by the grace of God
[45:18] so brother there's many hairiness by
[45:21] their ears but how many is going to hear
[45:23] it to hear the word by their a year in
[45:26] the heart God's grace to us a man so
[45:29] let's be in prayer for one another for
[45:31] sure and again the world is in a very
[45:35] terrible condition it's very stressful
[45:39] right now for the world for the
[45:41] government's for leaders concerning not
[45:44] only concerning the pandemic but to
[45:47] those of us who are aware of what was
[45:48] going on and what is going on in the
[45:50] states concerning racism and again
[45:56] rather it shows again oh my God have
[45:59] mercy on us
[46:00] the devil is in control of the world he
[46:04] is the god of this world we need to be
[46:08] in prayer for one another first no doubt
[46:11] there are believers around where all
[46:13] this is going on and it's not only going
[46:16] on of course in the United States or
[46:18] other parts of the world and and there
[46:20] was a certain issue that took place in
[46:21] Canada not sure was last night or this
[46:24] morning a man and and to deal with
[46:28] police and now they were treating
[46:31] somebody that they were arresting and so
[46:34] on and knowing that what happened in the
[46:36] States was found on video and what
[46:38] happened in Canada also was on video a
[46:42] man of our policemen was treating
[46:45] somebody that they were endeavoring to
[46:47] arrest

[46:55] this list being prayer for one another

[59:06] the scripture in Isaiah do we believe
[59:10] that with His stripes we were healed the
[59:12] grace of God amen
[59:14] turn with me to 2nd Corinthians chapter
[59:17] 11
[59:20] 2nd Corinthians 11 and we may have
[59:23] already read this scripture in a
[59:27] previous message but we read it again
[59:29] and there's a couple of other scriptures
[59:31] and then we want to get down to the
[59:34] scriptures that I referenced on Sunday
[59:37] concerning Isaiah and Ezekiel and in in
[59:41] 2nd Corinthians 11 and verse 12 and he
[59:46] said but what I do that I will do that I
[59:52] may cut off occasion from them which
[59:56] desire occasion yeah those are looking
[59:59] for attention
[1:00:01] he's I desire occasion some attention he
[1:00:06] said from them which desire attention or
[1:00:10] occasion he said that we're in the glory
[1:00:13] and there are those that are looking for
[1:00:16] attention again they're numbered with
[1:00:19] those that Jesus referred to that
[1:00:21] there's going to come false Christ's and
[1:00:23] false prophets in the last days and be
[1:00:27] so deceiving he said it would deceive
[1:00:29] the very elect if possible that's how
[1:00:32] bad it's going to be and that's so close
[1:00:34] to the real that's going to be a mayor
[1:00:36] but the grace of God II with us that we
[1:00:39] not be to see but Paul is highlighting
[1:00:42] it here in the first stage and warning
[1:00:44] us down through the ages concerning that
[1:00:48] spirit
[1:00:50] for such he said are false apostles
[1:00:54] looking for attention and he saw they
[1:00:57] are deceitful workers transforming
[1:01:00] themselves into the apostles of Christ
[1:01:04] this is amazing
[1:01:06] see we got to be on our guard a man it
[1:01:10] is so close again let me remind you it
[1:01:13] is so close it would deceive the very
[1:01:14] elect impossible a man but we are going
[1:01:18] to stay with the word it is written and
[1:01:22] it's cool we will leave it the way that
[1:01:24] God wants us to leave it and again as
[1:01:26] the father said don't add to it don't
[1:01:28] take from it and only that he said leave
[1:01:31] it the way that it is
[1:01:32] he said don't make it bigger than what
[1:01:34] it is don't make it smaller than what it
[1:01:36] is but again these false annoyed and
[1:01:38] once false Christ's they're going to be
[1:01:41] preaching Christ they're going to be
[1:01:42] preaching the word and saying this is
[1:01:44] saying that but to an extent they're
[1:01:46] there they're going to make it bigger
[1:01:48] than what it is smaller than what it is
[1:01:49] a man or they're going to add a word or
[1:01:52] take away a word and still leave you
[1:01:54] with the impression that it is the truth
[1:01:56] but brother we got to leave it the way
[1:01:58] that God said it a man and God doesn't
[1:02:01] want me to add to it God doesn't want
[1:02:03] you to add to it a man God wants us to
[1:02:05] believe it a man as he said to Martha so
[1:02:08] God says to us believe us now
[1:02:11] this a man the way that he said it a man
[1:02:15] the way that he meant it do we believe
[1:02:17] it that way
[1:02:18] oh yes but but no he didn't want any
[1:02:22] buts
[1:02:22] he didn't want us to hate this to it or
[1:02:24] aid that tour taking us away or that
[1:02:26] away leave it the way that he said at
[1:02:28] Martha leave her that it would the way
[1:02:30] that he said it as we as the Bride of
[1:02:32] Christ a man
[1:02:34] withers a man where's the Prophet a man
[1:02:37] whether whether some other ministry
[1:02:39] leave her the way that God has said it a
[1:02:42] man but again the false anointed ones
[1:02:45] are there sometimes who to impress you
[1:02:49] by thinking that you're going to make it
[1:02:51] bigger than what it is you're going to
[1:02:53] do this you're going to do that
[1:02:54] me and they make it make you believe
[1:02:56] that whether the problem in this or the
[1:02:58] Bible in this when it didn't no no leave
[1:03:01] it the way that God said it amen
[1:03:04] but again the false one other ones are
[1:03:06] there to impress impress the people and
[1:03:08] to get attention so the grace of God be
[1:03:11] with us brother amen and he said for
[1:03:14] such are false apostles deceitful
[1:03:18] workers a mayor and it says they're
[1:03:22] transforming themselves into the
[1:03:25] apostles of Christ amen
[1:03:27] oh yeah they want they want to lay it
[1:03:29] out in such a way minister in such a way
[1:03:31] give the word in such a way it what do
[1:03:34] you want to leave the impression that
[1:03:35] there really should seer want only the
[1:03:37] impression that what they're saying is
[1:03:38] are really really the Lord and well yeah
[1:03:41] remember again it's going to be they're
[1:03:43] going to have that true brother Brown
[1:03:44] said it's not a false when it comes to a
[1:03:47] false anointing the true ninety but he
[1:03:50] says when it comes to their true false
[1:03:52] Christ a man what is Christ is the
[1:03:56] Anointed One so they do have the
[1:03:58] anointing a man but he should go on
[1:04:00] further but he should their teaching is
[1:04:03] false a man is not exactly they don't
[1:04:06] stay with the word a man well you got if
[1:04:10] you're a true of ninety one you're gonna
[1:04:11] stay with the word a man and he said
[1:04:15] they are transforming themselves into
[1:04:17] the apostles of Christ just think that's
[1:04:21] how deceiving and no Marvel for Satan
[1:04:24] himself is transformed into an angel of
[1:04:28] light just think the devil is
[1:04:32] transformed into an angel of light and
[1:04:34] what I want to bring out we get into the
[1:04:37] scriptures again and get into some other
[1:04:38] thoughts is to let you know that this
[1:04:41] Justin is not just in the end time in
[1:04:43] the last days it's worse than the last
[1:04:46] days but it's been here all down through
[1:04:48] time and where they come from it come
[1:04:51] from eternity and we want to show you it
[1:04:54] come from eternity amen Israel is dealt
[1:04:58] with it and the Gentile church has dealt
[1:05:01] with it and now it's even more deceiving
[1:05:05] in the last days
[1:05:08] so no Marvel for Satan himself is
[1:05:11] transformed into an angel light and
[1:05:13] therefore it is no great thing if his
[1:05:16] ministers also be transformed as the
[1:05:19] ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:05:22] shall be according to their works
[1:05:26] god bless his words you may be seated
[1:05:29] and turn with me to second Peter we did
[1:05:34] read 2nd Peter chapter 1 we want to go
[1:05:36] to 2nd Peter chapter 2 thank God for the
[1:05:42] word amen no matter what the issue no
[1:05:48] matter what the problems matter what the
[1:05:49] need whether God gives us understanding
[1:05:53] in the word praise the Lord have the
[1:05:59] faith of God in 2nd Peter chapter 2 and
[1:06:02] verse 1 but they were false prophets
[1:06:07] also among the people even as there
[1:06:11] shall be false teachers among you
[1:06:14] they're false teachers then we got false
[1:06:17] teachers now a man because we're in the
[1:06:21] end the most deceiving of all ages and
[1:06:25] even as there shall be false teachers
[1:06:27] among you he said who privately shall
[1:06:31] bring in damnable heresies a man even
[1:06:36] denying the Lord that bought them and
[1:06:39] bring upon themselves Swift destruction
[1:06:43] this is a deceiving hour a man when we
[1:06:48] are facing this deception a man that's
[1:06:53] so close they would deceive the very
[1:06:55] elect if possible thank God for the
[1:06:59] grace of his elect amen the grace in
[1:07:05] your life the grace in my life to help
[1:07:07] us that will not be deceived a man no
[1:07:10] matter what comes no matter how close it
[1:07:12] is that God is going to give us the rote
[1:07:14] wisdom we need the revelation we need
[1:07:16] the understanding ready
[1:07:18] that will not be deceived a man but yet
[1:07:21] there's many today that are deceived
[1:07:23] coming soon there's gonna be such a
[1:07:25] deception a great deception to the
[1:07:28] extent that the prophet of God said
[1:07:30] there might be five hundred going living
[1:07:33] Saints they go into rapture five hundred
[1:07:36] living Saints why not all the others
[1:07:40] that are around the message if there's
[1:07:42] two or three or four million around this
[1:07:44] message I'll come only five hundred
[1:07:46] another time he said three hundred
[1:07:48] another time he said when that sister
[1:07:51] asked a Dave God asked her to pick out
[1:07:52] you know the Bride of Christ whatever he
[1:07:55] said I might find that doesn't he he was
[1:07:58] he was afraid that God would ask him to
[1:08:00] do that he said I might get a dozen a
[1:08:02] man so brother had made the brother if
[1:08:06] we've heard that quote then we know what
[1:08:08] the prophet has said brother it ought to
[1:08:10] put us on our guard it'll put us on our
[1:08:12] toes amen
[1:08:14] because certainly what we believe
[1:08:15] because running what we are hearing with
[1:08:18] not a not only behind this pulpit maybe
[1:08:20] there's other things you might be
[1:08:21] hearing online so where we need to be on
[1:08:24] our toes and on our guard and I just say
[1:08:26] well yeah I like this I like that I like
[1:08:28] this letter to make sure that it's
[1:08:31] ordained of God for this hour for this
[1:08:33] age it's ordained for the bride to give
[1:08:35] or watch this ordain to do and what is
[1:08:37] her thing to do give us right through
[1:08:39] faith a man it's not just this doctrine
[1:08:42] that doctrine that doctrine or that
[1:08:44] that's fine that's good praise the Lord
[1:08:46] but brother the overall revelation is to
[1:08:48] give us the revelation of the rapture
[1:08:51] it is the giver of the revelation of
[1:08:53] wraps repaint a man even the mystery of
[1:08:56] the Obi of the seven seals the prophet
[1:08:59] of God said well what's your day to do
[1:09:01] why did God do this why did God do that
[1:09:03] why is God to be doing this he says to
[1:09:05] give us rap free faith a man this is
[1:09:08] absolutely amazing because there's so
[1:09:11] much in the open of the word there's so
[1:09:13] much of the revelation of the seals
[1:09:14] there's so much concerning the mystery
[1:09:16] of God and revelation 10 and other
[1:09:19] scriptures a man and brother
[1:09:22] the ministry that is highlighting this
[1:09:23] and the right letting that and they're
[1:09:25] preaching this and the preaching that
[1:09:26] but brother we got to come back to what
[1:09:29] God wants us to minister on we got to
[1:09:31] come back to what God wants us to get to
[1:09:33] the people and that is resurrection and
[1:09:36] wrap through faith a man Luther focused
[1:09:39] on non justification justification just
[1:09:42] think well woody we feel like back there
[1:09:44] well we feel like in Luther's day or
[1:09:47] Wesley's day a man though there is that
[1:09:50] all you're going to breach and he
[1:09:51] preaches justification anyway when he
[1:09:54] went no doubt he went through the Old
[1:09:55] Testament and he preached justification
[1:09:58] justification and Wesley sanctification
[1:10:00] sanctification Amen brother there wasn't
[1:10:04] the gifts of the Spirit it wasn't this
[1:10:06] doctrine of that doctrine this is this
[1:10:08] and this no it was just on what God
[1:10:11] wanted them to focus on that's what
[1:10:14] that's what I they lure was hungry for
[1:10:15] that's what Wesley was hungry for a
[1:10:18] million and when they got it praise the
[1:10:21] Lord when they got it brother they they
[1:10:23] they were worshiping God they they
[1:10:25] preached it preached it preached the
[1:10:27] plates it a man a man
[1:10:30] praise the name of the Lord and again
[1:10:32] but they were they called out and got
[1:10:34] the attention of all the elect of God in
[1:10:37] their day and in their age and even who
[1:10:39] the Pentecostals amen
[1:10:41] but the thing of it is but when God
[1:10:43] wanted to go on they are made a
[1:10:45] denomination withers in Luther withers
[1:10:48] him wrestling with the Pentecostals and
[1:10:50] others oh they are they got caught up
[1:10:52] with is to the extent that a way was out
[1:10:55] of their hearts and it was in their
[1:10:57] heads amen
[1:10:59] it wasn't a revelation out of the heart
[1:11:01] after a while it what it was with
[1:11:03] Lutheran and three or four generations
[1:11:05] and Wesley and three or four generations
[1:11:07] the Pentecostals and the same thing but
[1:11:11] after the third generation they they be
[1:11:13] just it just went out of the heart and
[1:11:15] into the head amen they believed Joseph
[1:11:18] ocation in their heads they believed
[1:11:19] sanctification in their head they
[1:11:21] believed a man the the baptism of the
[1:11:24] Holy goes when the gifts but it was in
[1:11:26] their heads a man and the fewer and
[1:11:29] fewer and fewer had
[1:11:30] revelation in their hearts amen so that
[1:11:33] it was well the revelation the heart a
[1:11:35] man you're born again a man you're a new
[1:11:39] creature in Christ a man
[1:11:41] it controls your life it controls your
[1:11:43] thoughts it controls your spirit it
[1:11:45] controls your actions and reactions a
[1:11:47] man but for the most of them they got
[1:11:51] into a denomination and he just got into
[1:11:53] the letter of the word the letter of the
[1:11:55] message that they had a man but they
[1:11:58] lost the spiritual experience a man so
[1:12:02] brother/sister the grace of God in the
[1:12:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we're
[1:12:06] not going to we're not going to get out
[1:12:07] of the revelation of spiritual
[1:12:09] revelation the message and into the
[1:12:11] intellectual revelation amen there again
[1:12:15] many have gone even around the message
[1:12:17] they have gone from the spiritual
[1:12:19] revelation of Malachi 4 and what God has
[1:12:22] done what God is doing and they're
[1:12:24] getting into the end of the letter of it
[1:12:26] amen oh yeah they got the letter of the
[1:12:29] middle of the mystery of the seven seals
[1:12:30] the mystery of God and Malachi 4 it's
[1:12:34] all the letter God said God said God
[1:12:36] said you know the Bible says the boy who
[1:12:39] says but again it's out of their heads
[1:12:41] but not out of their hearts and then and
[1:12:43] the longer that time goes on the more
[1:12:46] and more of their of another generation
[1:12:48] another generation another generation
[1:12:50] and he get more and more intellectual a
[1:12:52] man unless unless a man sensitive to the
[1:12:56] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:59] they're going by the letter of the word
[1:13:01] but not the spirit of the word that
[1:13:03] remind you again of what the Prophet is
[1:13:05] saying and I believe it's in the message
[1:13:07] the anointing was at the end time and he
[1:13:09] said he said now he said you are in the
[1:13:11] message you say you're in the message
[1:13:13] but he said the message is not in you
[1:13:15] and that is the truth and that's
[1:13:18] something I witnessed for many years
[1:13:20] there's what I say even when I first
[1:13:22] came to the message a man and like I
[1:13:25] said that's why I preached it the way
[1:13:26] that I preached that first sermon amen
[1:13:29] and and I appreciate other people in a
[1:13:32] in a church but I do
[1:13:34] amen and I was just a young man but
[1:13:37] brother coming out of Pentecost and into
[1:13:39] the word at a Pentecost into the message
[1:13:41] a man for the experience that I hated
[1:13:43] Pentecost and the experience that I was
[1:13:45] occurring in the message I knew that
[1:13:48] many of those that I was meeting that so
[1:13:50] called oh yeah I'm a believer on a
[1:13:53] believer and I said Lord I said they're
[1:13:55] not believers I said they don't have no
[1:13:57] experience and why because why because
[1:14:01] they are in the message but the message
[1:14:02] he said is not a you a man and just
[1:14:06] saying what I what I was experiencing
[1:14:08] the Prophet already experienced and
[1:14:10] preached about a man I was experiencing
[1:14:14] whether alive William Branham was
[1:14:15] experiencing
[1:14:16] I was I was catching the revelation when
[1:14:19] umbrella was catching a man and it
[1:14:21] wasn't wasn't what wasn't very long
[1:14:22] after this that I came into the word
[1:14:25] that I came into the message amen and
[1:14:28] brother I began to realize the truth
[1:14:30] they were in the message but the message
[1:14:33] was not in them
[1:14:35] and not only that brother some years
[1:14:37] later when one of the Brethren a man God
[1:14:40] rest his soul and he was into a senior's
[1:14:44] old and he met a he met a senior citizen
[1:14:47] there and that person was yeah it was a
[1:14:51] retired Pentecostal pastor and they got
[1:14:55] to talking about the word and an about
[1:14:57] the message and the pastor said and he
[1:15:01] said brother he said I'm not denying
[1:15:04] what William Branham said and he said it
[1:15:06] was a tremendous word a tremendous
[1:15:08] message but he said I've got to admit he
[1:15:10] said they said that those who profess to
[1:15:13] believe it he said are just not living
[1:15:15] it you know he said those that are
[1:15:18] profession to believe it he said they're
[1:15:20] just not reflecting it he said the way
[1:15:22] that William Branham preached it amen
[1:15:25] and just saying that was a Pentecostal
[1:15:27] brother that was a former Benegal so
[1:15:29] pastor and I know though that he has
[1:15:31] gone on I pray God rest his soul because
[1:15:34] he was seeing the truth a man he was
[1:15:37] acknowledging the truth of the revealed
[1:15:40] word but acknowledging also a man
[1:15:42] that many of those that he that he admit
[1:15:45] that profess to be believers he knew
[1:15:47] that they were not reflecting the
[1:15:49] message they they added intellectually
[1:15:52] in their heads but they never had it in
[1:15:54] their hearts amen and brother sister and
[1:15:58] I have made note of this some years ago
[1:16:00] because when I came to this word this
[1:16:03] message and I contacted the voice of God
[1:16:06] and I said would you give me the names
[1:16:08] and addresses of certain individuals I
[1:16:12] said that are receiving message books I
[1:16:15] said here in Newfoundland and I didn't
[1:16:19] ask for just believers anybody everybody
[1:16:21] but just certain individuals and and
[1:16:25] well I bet I'll let you know
[1:16:27] it was Pentecostal pastors I see do our
[1:16:30] pastors on the list and they said yes
[1:16:33] brother there's the number of pastors on
[1:16:35] the list and they sent me the names and
[1:16:37] addresses of those pastors amen and oh
[1:16:42] yeah so I said old my I'm going to
[1:16:44] contact them and I'm gonna go to give
[1:16:47] them a certain booklet that I had and so
[1:16:49] on and let them know this let them know
[1:16:51] that amen and brother
[1:16:54] not many responded but if you did yeah
[1:16:58] and I'll be honest brother one thing
[1:17:02] that they came back with was the same
[1:17:04] thing that I was experiencing when I
[1:17:06] come to the others that were professing
[1:17:08] to believe this message amen because
[1:17:11] they realized too that a man that the
[1:17:14] believers who were saying we believe
[1:17:16] when Amanda was a prophet we believe
[1:17:18] that God did this we believe that God
[1:17:19] did that God said this God say that a
[1:17:22] man and they knew they felt within
[1:17:24] themselves
[1:17:25] they were talking it but they weren't
[1:17:26] living it Amen so brother sister let's
[1:17:29] not just talk the message let's live the
[1:17:31] message amen listen I just go and talk
[1:17:35] the message let's go ahead and reflect
[1:17:37] the message in there in our thoughts in
[1:17:39] our words and our deeds in our actions
[1:17:41] and in our reactions a man and brother
[1:17:45] to keep your attitude right in your
[1:17:46] spirit right a man because their
[1:17:49] attitude and their spirit was wrong
[1:17:50] years ago and many of
[1:17:52] leavers still got the wrong attitude a
[1:17:54] wrong spirit now a man looking down at
[1:17:57] those out there looking down at that one
[1:17:59] looking at less don't look down at
[1:18:00] nobody it's the grace of God to me it's
[1:18:03] the grace of God to them a man and again
[1:18:06] just singing again as there's a part of
[1:18:08] God was where when when when he was
[1:18:11] looking at that woman and he was
[1:18:12] criticizing the woman because of the way
[1:18:15] she was dressed
[1:18:16] a man and the Lord came down and the
[1:18:19] Lord rebuke Commission and told him it
[1:18:21] says don't you do that and it says who
[1:18:24] yukkin yukkin yukkin condemn and you can
[1:18:26] criticize what she's wearing and how
[1:18:28] she's dressed
[1:18:29] but don't you condemn her he said why
[1:18:32] because he says some of them are my
[1:18:33] children a man this is absolutely
[1:18:36] amazing who had we met over there that
[1:18:39] any that it's that it's the children of
[1:18:41] God who having been are there that are
[1:18:43] the feet of God not necessarily the
[1:18:45] bride
[1:18:45] no and let me remind you again the part
[1:18:48] of God said we're not going to reach
[1:18:50] everyone with this message amen but only
[1:18:53] the elect we're going to reach the brain
[1:18:56] we're going to reach all the elect with
[1:18:57] this message
[1:18:58] but brother whenever when it comes to
[1:19:00] the others the the foolish virgins
[1:19:02] brother they're not ordained to be part
[1:19:04] of the bride they're not going to be
[1:19:05] there no brothers oh they will at the a
[1:19:08] in the end as the Bible says the rest of
[1:19:11] the Dead lived not again for a thousand
[1:19:13] years but they're coming back and
[1:19:14] brother they're given white robes amen
[1:19:18] the others are put into the lid their
[1:19:20] time in the lake of fire and so on but
[1:19:23] the others are given way robes a man
[1:19:25] those that are going to live outside the
[1:19:28] city so God help us to keep our head
[1:19:30] attitude right to keep the balance when
[1:19:31] it come to the Word of God amen brother
[1:19:34] we're going to condemn the false
[1:19:36] teachings and the false doctrines and
[1:19:38] and people you're worshiping you know
[1:19:41] the churches and denominations amen but
[1:19:44] brother we're not going to condemn the
[1:19:45] people no siree no way because you and I
[1:19:50] were part of that amen brother sister
[1:19:54] ahead and of course not the younger ones
[1:19:57] here but again the older one we were we
[1:20:00] were part of it a man and when it comes
[1:20:02] to all the older ones here in the
[1:20:04] assembly you've been part of the
[1:20:06] Catholic Church where you were probably
[1:20:07] the worst of it
[1:20:08] a man you're part of the thing that all
[1:20:11] the others came out of your part you
[1:20:13] were part of what the devil started amen
[1:20:15] that's right there was the first
[1:20:17] organized religion in the world was the
[1:20:20] Roman Catholic Church amen
[1:20:22] so and think oh thank God God began to
[1:20:25] deal with that year after year after
[1:20:27] year there came Luther they came West
[1:20:28] way they came this one and that one
[1:20:30] amen to finally in the last days oh well
[1:20:33] praise the Lord we came out of all of
[1:20:34] them amen
[1:20:36] so keep her attitude raking our spirit
[1:20:38] right by the grace of Almighty God a man
[1:20:41] and brother we're not going there we're
[1:20:44] not going to condemn even those that we
[1:20:45] believe to be false prophets and false
[1:20:47] this and Paul said oh there they they
[1:20:49] got false and they're there they're
[1:20:51] false anointed once during 90 a men and
[1:20:56] that and the anointing is genuine
[1:20:57] because he promises see it's a false
[1:21:00] Christ and he said well as the false
[1:21:03] Christ at 91 and it's a true anointed
[1:21:05] one he said but he said they're teaching
[1:21:07] his false the United State and it causes
[1:21:10] them to be identified with what you and
[1:21:12] I identify with a man but when when they
[1:21:15] get into it the life and their preaching
[1:21:17] this and teaching this he said they're
[1:21:19] going to add here add a word there take
[1:21:20] away a word and so on her brother the
[1:21:23] bride is gonna stay with it not add to
[1:21:26] it not take from it but believe it in
[1:21:28] simplicity amen and again this brother
[1:21:31] that God never did it did they did this
[1:21:34] where the purpose of getting us caught
[1:21:35] up with with this doctor caught up with
[1:21:37] that doctor cut up here cut up there and
[1:21:40] it's become a crate to an auto believers
[1:21:42] this doctrine this doctor it's just a
[1:21:44] crate I believe this I believe this I
[1:21:46] believe that brothers sisters will thank
[1:21:48] God praise the Lord just let's believe
[1:21:51] it and move on to the resurrection this
[1:21:53] will even and move on to the rapture
[1:21:54] amen
[1:21:56] so brothers for their guard wherewith
[1:21:57] they will be proven that God is
[1:21:59] accomplishing in you and me what he's
[1:22:01] ordained to do through the prophet of
[1:22:03] Malachi 4 ain't bad brothers not to call
[1:22:07] us out and just give us these doctrines
[1:22:09] is to call us out so God can take us in
[1:22:12] a man brother sister again is like God
[1:22:16] bringing issue
[1:22:17] out of Asia not to go into the
[1:22:18] wilderness but to go into the promised
[1:22:20] land
[1:22:21] a man what was Joshua Seeley what was
[1:22:25] Caleb feeling what do they feel like
[1:22:27] amen and when they when they were forced
[1:22:30] and and they couldn't go into the
[1:22:31] Promised Land they couldn't go
[1:22:33] possessive because the majority didn't
[1:22:34] want anything to do with it oh no no we
[1:22:37] can't do it we can't do it we can't do
[1:22:38] it
[1:22:39] amen but still joy had never gone to us
[1:22:41] they were going to kill Joshua and Caleb
[1:22:43] they're going to kill Moses oh yeah
[1:22:46] they're going to stone them because they
[1:22:48] took their stand and it was Caleb said
[1:22:50] listen if God be for us who can be
[1:22:52] against us amen
[1:22:54] so brother sister the grace of God in
[1:22:56] this hour this agent brothers history of
[1:22:59] his God let's believe God linaria if
[1:23:02] it's God let's trust God amen let's say
[1:23:06] the faith that God wants us to have and
[1:23:08] brother brother without faith it's
[1:23:11] impossible to please God hey my brother
[1:23:15] but it's got to be the faith he's gotta
[1:23:18] be the faith he wants you to have a
[1:23:20] million brothers not just nor Luther
[1:23:23] head not just well Wesley aid the
[1:23:25] Pentecostal said amen and then it goes
[1:23:28] beyond even the obeah the seven seals
[1:23:30] the revelation of the mystery of God
[1:23:31] brother there is to be a faith in it
[1:23:35] that we are to receive of the rapture
[1:23:37] the resurrection get out of here
[1:23:39] but I'll tell you there's not many who
[1:23:41] want to get out they don't have they
[1:23:43] don't know they don't have that same
[1:23:44] anointing they don't have that same
[1:23:46] hunger and thirst that Joshua and Caleb
[1:23:48] had outside the outside the said the
[1:23:51] promised land
[1:23:51] no no but even so just content with
[1:23:54] doctrine and I'm a believer I'm a
[1:23:56] believer on believer again during the
[1:23:58] message during the message there in the
[1:24:00] message I know I died today but the
[1:24:02] message is not in them if the message
[1:24:05] was in them then God would be in them to
[1:24:07] take them up to take them in the
[1:24:10] resurrection taken in the rapture it's
[1:24:11] just not coming out of the denomination
[1:24:13] any man but and it's not just saying
[1:24:16] well I'm a believer so you know as her
[1:24:18] brother I'll act like this and dress
[1:24:20] like this as a sister I'll act like this
[1:24:22] and dress like that amen
[1:24:23] well that's good but let's go on let's
[1:24:26] go at increase our faith a man sure God
[1:24:32] gave you their faith and you acted on it
[1:24:34] and you were baptizing in his name God
[1:24:37] gave you their faith and you acted on
[1:24:38] earth says well I believe I believe I
[1:24:41] believe this doctrine there dr. surd see
[1:24:43] I I believe in the oneness of God I
[1:24:45] believe with the baptism in his name and
[1:24:48] so on yeah praise the Lord but how many
[1:24:50] are believing for the resurrection how
[1:24:53] many are believing in the rapture
[1:24:56] there's so little emphasis being put on
[1:24:58] it and there's only there's so little
[1:25:01] revelation because you go there that the
[1:25:04] people are being caught up with into a
[1:25:06] resurrection and into the rapture this
[1:25:09] is what God is doing a man and he's not
[1:25:13] just getting us a denomination and into
[1:25:16] the message to believe the doctrines a
[1:25:18] million sure it's like that's all part
[1:25:21] of it but we got to grow and mature in
[1:25:23] the faith to what till it pleases God
[1:25:26] what faith pleases God it's not just
[1:25:28] saying well I I believe that serpent
[1:25:30] seed I believe in the water baptism I
[1:25:32] believe in the oneness of the Guardian
[1:25:34] I believe this doctrine that doctrine I
[1:25:36] believe that brothers should read dress
[1:25:38] like this and act like this I believe
[1:25:40] that sister should dress like this and
[1:25:42] act like that that's just good but you
[1:25:44] gotta get ready to your faith go on go
[1:25:47] on well Lord what is it you want me to
[1:25:49] believe now I want you to get out of

[1:26:05] it for you
[1:26:06] amen that's what Joshua Taylor and
[1:26:09] especially Kennedy know if God be for us

[1:26:14] parents every place to soldier put your
[1:26:17] trade he are giving you a man brother
[1:26:21] Broly lujah God's give us a revelation
[1:26:23] of justification sanctification the

[1:26:29] of the Trinity and yeah
[1:26:32] the oneness of the Godhead not Trinity

[1:26:36] and all of these things and regional sin
[1:26:39] we know this we know that amen we
[1:26:41] believe this we believe that anybody and
[1:26:43] then then God's us what would the
[1:26:46] rapture what well I believe in the
[1:26:49] rapture yeah but I want you to good go
[1:26:51] into rapture I want you to be raptured I
[1:26:54] want you to bring forth the dead amen
[1:27:00] Jesus a sense to decide the tomb of
[1:27:02] Lazarus Lazarus come forth before Easter
[1:27:07] before he said that he said we will
[1:27:09] remove the stone remove the show hey man
[1:27:14] that was the confession of death charge
[1:27:18] they were concerned he was dead sure

[1:27:22] leave it there yeah he should take the
[1:27:25] stone away what he's dead he's been gone

[1:27:33] he's asleep amen
[1:27:36] he's doing I got to go awake him praise
[1:27:39] the Lord

[1:28:24] maybe he's he starting to decay and
[1:28:26] maybe you know his body is stinking and
[1:28:28] so on Jesus wasn't didn't might better
[1:28:30] bother Jesus that's like I said when
[1:28:33] Jesus when did the Bible says Jesus wept
[1:28:36] he wasn't crying for Lazarus he was
[1:28:38] gonna wake him no siree he wasn't crying
[1:28:41] because Lazarus dead
[1:28:44] but why would he cry for death when he
[1:28:48] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:28:51] amen he told her to save us you know and
[1:28:55] when they RT was sick and you know well
[1:28:57] and jesus knew what was going to happen
[1:28:59] if Jesus wanted to he could went back
[1:29:01] and touch them and healed him he
[1:29:03] wouldn't died but he didn't do that
[1:29:04] anybody he wanted Ellen oh yeah he
[1:29:08] wanted to reveal the revelation of who
[1:29:10] he was what we mean who he was the

[1:29:49] but now he's gonna raise him that's
[1:29:52] healing that's absolute complete evening

[1:34:42] doctrinal we believe this or private or
[1:34:44] this the Prophet SAW that he taught this

[1:35:19] revelation that will produce in us
[1:35:22] right thoughts a man the right thoughts
[1:35:27] that we're going to think as we ought to
[1:35:29] think concerning who we are concerning
[1:35:32] what God is looking for in us concerning
[1:35:35] what God is expecting out of me and out
[1:35:37] of you is God a man is God pleased with
[1:35:40] your your your experience are you in
[1:35:44] fellowship with God yeah
[1:35:49] there's a dozen I don't know if there's
[1:35:52] an hour but through the day that that I
[1:35:54] that I would go without without talking
[1:35:56] to the Lord without calling on the name
[1:36:00] the Lord of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:02] yeah as our brother Chad as mentioned
[1:36:06] concern he is driving the in his truck
[1:36:08] and so on and meditating and thinking
[1:36:12] about the Lord and praying and so on oh
[1:36:13] yeah if you're in the spirit you can't
[1:36:17] get out this it's you're in the spirit
[1:36:20] the Spirit is in you there's a oneness
[1:36:23] that day you'll know that I mean this he
[1:36:26] said I mean the father the father me I
[1:36:28] in you and you and me table oneness how
[1:36:30] can you how can you not think about the
[1:36:32] Lord how can you go you know so long and
[1:36:35] nothing about Jesus Amen that the public
[1:36:40] board brother he had that anointing to
[1:36:42] the extent that when he went on haunting
[1:36:44] all my or my hunting well he was out
[1:36:49] there in the wilderness what was he
[1:36:51] thinking about all he was thinking but I
[1:36:53] was launching this and hunting dad did
[1:36:54] looking for this animal that animal
[1:36:56] maybe looking for a fish out there and
[1:36:58] and then in water somewhere ya know he
[1:37:01] looked no matter where he look what he
[1:37:05] did is Jesus oh he looked and he said he
[1:37:09] started to scream
[1:37:10] he saw though he saw the trees he saw
[1:37:13] this and he started to scream and he
[1:37:15] said I ran around the trees I ran here
[1:37:17] screaming and praising the Lord and
[1:37:18] shouting amen and here he wasn't out
[1:37:22] there for her for a rest to get away
[1:37:25] from this and away from that but he
[1:37:26] didn't get away from the Lord anybody
[1:37:29] there are those that brother when they
[1:37:31] get away from church to get away from
[1:37:32] God that's right
[1:37:35] when they go through the door they need
[1:37:37] God behind them that's the truth
[1:37:40] but a brother but if you got the baptism
[1:37:43] of the Holy Ghost and Jesus say
[1:37:45] concerning the power in the anointing
[1:37:47] and in your experience with them he said
[1:37:50] yeah I mean I mean the father and father
[1:37:52] and me I in you and you and me there's
[1:37:54] an absolute oneness a main and if we got
[1:37:58] that wellness there brother we're going
[1:37:59] to have the faith that Jesus said amen
[1:38:03] we're gonna have the same attitude that
[1:38:05] Jesus said 'we'll had to say where did
[1:38:07] Jesus said hey bad that we're not here
[1:38:10] to do our will where to do God's will
[1:38:12] hey man hey man Jesus came and like I
[1:38:16] said he knew he knew where he come from
[1:38:18] I knew where he was going when he knew I
[1:38:19] was gonna get there a man but he was
[1:38:22] longer to get there how many many
[1:38:25] believers are longing to get out of here
[1:38:28] and into the rapture how many are
[1:38:31] longing to get out of here and into the
[1:38:33] marriage supper of the Lamb how many I
[1:38:36] tell you they're more caught up with
[1:38:38] this old world than they are with the
[1:38:40] with the world to come there are more
[1:38:42] Carlo with this world than they are with
[1:38:45] the resurrection in the rapture
[1:38:46] you're more tired with the people of
[1:38:49] this world and they got to do this
[1:38:51] they're gonna do this they got to look
[1:38:52] after this one and that one and so on
[1:38:54] wait a minute what are those that are
[1:38:57] gone on and they're waiting on us
[1:39:00] see there I believe the closer we get to
[1:39:02] it the more of more sensitive we're
[1:39:04] going to get to that other dimension of
[1:39:07] the dead in Christ they're not in the
[1:39:10] graveyard
[1:39:11] during Christ amen brother
[1:39:17] I caught helped us to be more sensitive
[1:39:21] they approved the faith that I have
[1:39:24] proved the faith that you got as I say
[1:39:26] go through the day and you in the name
[1:39:29] of the Lord God bless us god help us
[1:39:31] Lord Jesus I need you Lord give us your
[1:39:33] wisdom give us your strength your
[1:39:35] encouragement Lord we need it oh yeah
[1:39:37] I'm going through the day morning noon
[1:39:39] and night just talking to the Lord
[1:39:41] praying when I wake in the morning can't
[1:39:45] get it out of my heart mind
[1:39:47] you know lord help me a man
[1:39:52] grace you're so good brother sister I'll
[1:39:56] tell you that oh no I won't say that hey
[1:40:03] man get all the church together amen oh
[1:40:09] yes
[1:40:10] no no cuz just say oh brother Drew was
[1:40:14] condemning me no I'll leave that with
[1:40:17] the Lord to convict brother if we got
[1:40:21] the Holy Ghost she's there to convict us
[1:40:22] to do what's right here we got the Holy
[1:40:25] Ghost here to connect us to stay in line
[1:40:27] with the will of God amen
[1:40:29] what does good what me to do what does
[1:40:33] God want you to do again as I said when
[1:40:36] where and how and so on brother let let
[1:40:39] God be in control of your life
[1:40:40] amen and that you're here tonight
[1:40:43] because of the conviction of the Holy
[1:40:45] Ghost you're here tonight and those that
[1:40:47] are on line hearing the Word of God by
[1:40:50] the conviction of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:40:52] brother we we got the Holy Ghost the
[1:40:55] Holy Ghost is going to convict us to
[1:40:56] line up with the word Amen that's dress
[1:41:01] the truth
[1:41:02] praise the name of the Lord and I guess
[1:41:04] the Lord was working on using brother
[1:41:06] Matthew to work on that conviction to
[1:41:09] see if you would come tonight amen
[1:41:12] so brother see how serious it is God in
[1:41:18] control I tell you it's not just coming
[1:41:21] out of a church and into another one not
[1:41:23] coming out of one doctrine into another
[1:41:25] one it's moving on in the in the in that
[1:41:27] teaching where we know only that
[1:41:29] revelation what for to get to the faith
[1:41:32] that God wants you to have hey man amen
[1:41:36] brother
[1:41:37] and again as I said down through the
[1:41:39] ages state they moved from one age to
[1:41:40] another one revelation to another amen
[1:41:43] but there was a test of faith when
[1:41:45] brother when they were in one age and
[1:41:47] God came with a messenger and revealed
[1:41:49] something else amen
[1:41:50] oh well I know I believe this I believe
[1:41:53] that all day in Luther's day I we
[1:41:55] believe justification yeah yeah but
[1:41:57] there's more to it than that
[1:41:59] Owen II went under Saint
[1:42:02] oh yeah we lay justifications
[1:42:03] ratification any man but when God came
[1:42:06] with the gifts of the Spirit the battery
[1:42:07] of the Holy Ghost oh my I tell your
[1:42:10] brother God it was getting greater and
[1:42:12] greater and greater in any man
[1:42:14] that was one thing justification that
[1:42:17] was one doctrine st. engage another
[1:42:19] doctrine but then came the anointing a
[1:42:21] man in the Pentecostal 90 the baptism of
[1:42:25] the Holy Ghost all this was quite
[1:42:28] different from believing justification
[1:42:30] and believing sanctification well
[1:42:33] brother God was bringing them more and
[1:42:35] more into a greater and greater
[1:42:36] experience with God a man hey man God
[1:42:43] taking more and more control of their
[1:42:45] lives because brother the lives that
[1:42:48] that they lived in the in the days of
[1:42:50] Wesley and the sanctification was quite
[1:42:54] different from the life they lived in
[1:42:55] losers Luther's age yeah okay because in
[1:43:01] Luther's day my understanding is that
[1:43:03] they did drink and they did this and
[1:43:06] they did that but they still believed in
[1:43:08] justification and they had that faith oh
[1:43:11] yeah because they'd they went on
[1:43:14] according to the revelation that came
[1:43:16] with justification amen
[1:43:19] but then they went on to sanctification
[1:43:21] oh that was another revelation amen they
[1:43:25] God begin to deal with the people and to
[1:43:27] begin to live a more separated life in
[1:43:31] the Methodists yes they did
[1:43:34] but still not as separated as believers
[1:43:37] would separate or as the Pentecostals
[1:43:40] would amen and then when God moved on oh
[1:43:43] yeah eating the Salvation Army when they
[1:43:47] were when they're lapping between the
[1:43:49] Queen and Methodists and and the
[1:43:51] Pentecostal message salvation army
[1:43:53] brother cuz I've got I've got their
[1:43:54] their their some of their sermons there
[1:43:56] now in book form oh yeah they were
[1:43:59] preaching they said what we need what we
[1:44:01] need now he says what Peter had on the
[1:44:03] day of Pentecost they had trained
[1:44:08] delegation they had justification and
[1:44:10] now they recognized they needed the
[1:44:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:44:15] oh yeah and one of the one of their
[1:44:17] sermons they were laying in a delay
[1:44:19] today they say there's not numbers we
[1:44:21] are worried about we got numbers they
[1:44:23] said what we need is separation on to
[1:44:25] the Lord oh yeah that's what they're
[1:44:27] preaching near the end of their
[1:44:29] ministries amen
[1:44:30] and they were saying listen do you know
[1:44:34] where all this begins less than a son
[1:44:36] this begins in your closet and they were
[1:44:40] preaching to the sisters anyway so
[1:44:44] thirsty' said this begins in your closet
[1:44:46] you've got an experience with God you
[1:44:48] got sanctification let's let's see it
[1:44:50] reflecting you amen let it start there
[1:44:53] and let's go on to the baptism of the
[1:44:55] Holy Ghost amen so when God came in
[1:44:58] Pentecost for the baptism of the Holy
[1:45:00] Ghost amen
[1:45:02] this was quite different from Luther
[1:45:04] quite general Wesley a man this was
[1:45:07] going to be a greater and a greater
[1:45:08] experience in their in their everyday
[1:45:11] living God was going to take more
[1:45:13] control amen
[1:45:16] more control of his shade than he had
[1:45:20] under Luther more control than he had
[1:45:22] under Wesley and the Pentecostal message
[1:45:26] was a greater control and brother let me
[1:45:28] tell you this that the message of
[1:45:30] Malachi 4 is God taking more control
[1:45:33] than he did in Pentecost he doesn't have
[1:45:41] that much I'll be honest and there are
[1:45:43] people in Pentecost that guy got more
[1:45:45] control of than he does message
[1:45:46] believers and as trying to goes on it's
[1:45:50] going to get more and more worldly
[1:45:55] better be on our guard please make our
[1:45:58] calling election sure there's be area
[1:46:01] Tolls let us in the name of the Lord but
[1:46:03] let us feed on the Word of God by the
[1:46:06] grace of God a man let's not cut up with
[1:46:09] the false and false Christ or he's
[1:46:13] traveling with false and 9 and once a
[1:46:15] man Christ is the Anointed One Messiah
[1:46:20] and he said
[1:46:23] what what's what's false we thought it's
[1:46:25] a false in nineteen no he said it's the
[1:46:27] false christs he said they got the
[1:46:29] Christ anointing but he said the false
[1:46:32] is their teaching yeah it's your brother
[1:46:36] I pray the grace of God that will have
[1:46:39] the true anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:41] amen
[1:46:43] with the true teaching a man because all
[1:46:47] down true they've had this anointing and
[1:46:49] and a false teaching and a false
[1:46:51] teaching they've added to the word took
[1:46:53] a what took away from the word took even
[1:46:56] in this hour now brother brother Brown

[1:47:02] what he preached in 1965 as he was
[1:47:06] nearing the end of his own ministry he
[1:47:08] knew he was going but he also knew that
[1:47:12] they were in to end the word
[1:47:13] intellectually but not spiritually amen
[1:47:16] did they believe they believe this they
[1:47:18] believe that but they didn't believe all
[1:47:22] that he was saying concerning the living
[1:47:23] the life that's why he said you're in
[1:47:26] the message but the message is not in

[1:47:32] believers in the hearing of what I have

[1:58:12] Bible and Harry was stood up and he laid
[1:58:20] raised the Bible he didn't say anything
[1:58:26] but not long after somebody else got
[1:58:31] spoke was being interviewed yeah he said
[1:58:36] it's like him he said would it Bible he
[1:58:38] said is not having it as it is reading
[1:58:41] it he said he said he needs to read it
[1:58:43] and he said if he read it he said he
[1:58:46] would find some other things in it what
[1:58:50] things that would have controlled his
[1:58:51] actions and reactions that's what the
[1:58:55] person was it was indicating
[1:58:58] and it was it was another politician

[2:01:39] denying the Lord that bought them and
[2:01:41] bring upon themselves Swift destruction
[2:01:44] yeah and many shall follow their own
[2:01:48] their pernicious ways by reason of whom

[2:02:35] go back and do it again yeah oh my
[2:02:40] owning us as many times I preached never
[2:02:44] got paid yeah
[2:02:46] didn't matter to me it was for the glory
[2:02:49] of God I did it for the Lord I did it
[2:02:53] for the Gospels think I did it for the
[2:02:54] for the body of Christ amen
[2:02:58] to God be the glory but today oh my he
[2:03:03] warned about those false false invited
[2:03:05] ones they got in a real anointing they

[2:03:36] sincerity amen and to covetousness shall
[2:03:43] they with on thing word or with thing
[2:03:44] words rather make merchandise of you
[2:03:47] whose judgment nailed a long time
[2:03:50] lingered not and their damnation
[2:03:52] slumbereth not a man for he said if God
[2:03:57] spared not the Angels that sinned but
[2:03:59] cast them down to hell
[2:04:00] delivered them into chains of Darkness
[2:04:03] to be reserved unto judgement and he
[2:04:06] goes on top what he spared not the world
[2:04:08] and so on so also these will pay a price
[2:04:14] amen
[2:04:17] just to leave a thought maybe a quote
[2:04:21] I'm gonna have to take a service and
[2:04:24] just go through the quotes of the
[2:04:25] Prophet concerning the anointed ones at
[2:04:28] the end time and as I said before the
[2:04:32] prophet of God really felt lit up the
[2:04:33] Lord to minister in this subject why
[2:04:37] because he knew that many were caught up
[2:04:42] under the influence of an anointed ones
[2:04:45] but they were false in their teaching
[2:04:47] he said the anointing is not false no no
[2:04:52] because they're false Christ's they're
[2:04:56] 19 ones he said but the teaching is
[2:04:58] false
[2:04:59] some of the teaching god help us and he
[2:05:04] brings out an ID Bree I brought it out
[2:05:06] in the last message he brought it out
[2:05:08] concerning the rain falls on the just
[2:05:09] and the unjust yeah and he talked about
[2:05:15] in the field he said the same rain he
[2:05:19] said that brings forth the grass he's in
[2:05:21] the same rain brings forth to see the
[2:05:23] weeds yeah
[2:05:25] so he says st. that as it is in the
[2:05:27] natural shoulders in the spiritual these
[2:05:30] are the rain that'll bring forth this
[2:05:32] this this God God doing this God doing
[2:05:35] god this God teaching this and that
[2:05:37] he said that same rain will fall on
[2:05:39] other and they're anointed and he said
[2:05:43] they'll get up and they'll teach but he
[2:05:45] said they'll add a word they'll take
[2:05:47] away a word so grace to make our calling
[2:05:50] an election sure and make sure that that
[2:05:53] brother that we're not adding to it
[2:05:54] we're not taking from it whether it's
[2:05:57] the ministry or whether it's you as an
[2:06:00] individual and son and daughter of God
[2:06:03] don't add to the word to please yourself
[2:06:06] or to please your family or to please
[2:06:09] your friends don't take away from the
[2:06:11] word leave it the way it is amen and
[2:06:15] again as the Provost said don't make it
[2:06:17] any bigger than what it is nor any
[2:06:19] smaller than what it is grace of God be
[2:06:21] with us but the will of God they may not
[2:06:24] my real father time be done how many are
[2:06:28] willing to say that yeah because we got

[2:06:52] scriptures here that I want to show you

[2:06:57] and they know any ones in time and
[2:07:01] brother sister what we're dealing with
