of work goes into that and uh uh of course there's a cause to that as well and we just uh we don't normally do this but we just wanted to mention that for those that may want to make an offering to help defrate some of those costs um especially if if you're visiting as well so there's um two ways of doing it one is we've got an offering box out there on the shelf on the right hand side when you go out in the lobby it's hiding there on a shelf um and uh the other is we can uh transfer electronically if you if you wish to do that and there's no pressure believe me we just uh but we just know that what brother brandom said it is part of our worship and it's something that we uh really he said we're obligated to do is make sure that the that the the expenses are paid and that's what the offerings are for so we just wanted to mention that uh and I won't mention it again okay we got that out of the way that's the housekeeping out of the way amen 309 let's sing that brother Jerry talked

welcome a special guest tonight and he came 3700 km by Road for his personal vacation having never been here ever before his wife asked him where do you want to go for vacation he says I want to go to Conception Bay South to go to church this is Brother Cory in the back and he introduced himself and he's been listening online for months and months he's got a history with the message he actually went to Saria church back when your dad was there so he knows brother Paul so he's familiar but he just showed up yesterday and he entered right in and I had no clue who he was and he introduced himself after service so he's been listening to us for months we don't know who's listening we don't know who's being fed but he came all the way so brother Cory I want to just thank you from the bottom of my heart for spending a vacation and he he may only get two Services that's all he might get he's got his family with him and so it has to be a vacation of sorts but I just wanted to welcome him personally from the pulpit this evening and he heads back I think on Sunday or or Monday and and different things but God bless you for coming out and taking your vacation he'll do over 7,000 kilometers by the time he's done to come to some church services amen you think he's going to go home with a blessing I believe he's going to go home with a blessing he can't contain amen amen God bless you amen I just wanted to give a quick update on brother Jim I was able to go over this afternoon with brother Joe and see him and uh he's got his his kids are flying in this afternoon from out west and so he'll have some family he's got some family with him already his daughter and brother and and some other ones but uh he had a rough go of it um they lost him for 2 minutes but the Lord spared him and he's back with us and he's just sore kind of from what he's gone through apparently a heart attack's not uh not an easy thing to go through dying's not an easy thing to go through amen but he's back with us he certainly covets our prayers he wishes he was here but they're going to keep him in the in the hospital for a few more days to do some testing and confirmation of things let him recover stay under observation so remember him we won't ask anyone to go visit him just at this moment he has his family with him I'll check in with him every day but just for the sake of him and his family uh he's got the support he needs and so let's just just just let them take care of their their father and their brother and these different things amen are you ready to hear the word again tonight Amen brother Jerry gets to sit back can relax and brother Paul gets to step into the into the uh the the the Yoke and he gets to Bear a burden this evening but the Lord's given him a message for us and I'm trusting that he will speak as the Oracle of God tonight that the Holy Spirit would just flow through him and that the spirit that's going through him will be matched with the spirit that's in us to receive it and when Supernatural meets Supernatural then the supernatural happens amen so let's just go before the Lord let's sing that song be it unto me according to your word amen as brother Paul comes and I've told him to take his Liberty we came in early so we could stay as long as we need to amen so let's just pull on the word let's just relax and enjoy what God has for us

of the Lord and to just hear these specials and the singing the word worship has been a great joy to me tonight just want to thank you for the invitation from your pastor and um I just sang that song um the depth of his love because you sang that the first night and I was listening into the service Thursday night uh and uh just I thought it was just amazing how the Holy Spirit just begin to direct the service and uh the the song leader was just sang that song I was singing it with you the depth of the Lord the depth of the love of the Lord is forever and brother came and sang and open this meeting with perfect love and that's what we're reaching for can you sayen I thought it was just wonderful how the songs and everything just come together so wonderfully and last night was such a blessing to my heart especially and we appreciate how rich the word is in the times we live in and uh we need it and we're going to need it more and more the power of his word so we're just glad to be here tonight and you're in a little bit of a tat of a different building than what you were be when I was here last time just a tad different and uh so praise the Lord uh you've been blessed by the Lord in such a special way and I know we don't put a lot of emphasis on buildings but we got one four or five years ago here and it is a blessing from the Lord God knows our needs and for many years there's a need there's a need there's a need and then God when he does it he does it great and so we should enjoy that give the glory to the Lord and we know the the Temple of the Lord is the people but yet God gives us places that we can uh feel free to worship and and to be able to enjoy a place of our own this way and the space and I can only I can only say this God gives you a space for a reason and that's not so you can spread out it so that more souls can come to the kingdom of God and I'm praying for that in New Finland that if this is providing a balanced preaching of the word in the message of the last days God will give you many many souls to come and hear the word of God and look at this brother coming from so far it's about hunger and people get hungry enough they're going to come and hear the word of God so I pray he fill these pews with hungry souls for the message of the last days here in Newland and I just I I make that my prayer and before God I believe and we're glad to be a part of it my wife Rebecca and I and part of these meetings I actually had talked about when I heard about the dedication my wife and I had talked about coming even if I wasn't speaking I was going to come and join anyway cuz we have many connections here and family and also just uh just I like to make the the connection with some and friends that we've known Through The Years so we are Kindred churches and kindred spirits and I wanted to be able to enjoy this uh weekend with you so I have to preach anyway now but anyway I think I would have come anyway and just enjoyed the fellowship and and uh just the many blessings we get from coming here and seeing Kimberly sister Kimberly was is away from us now of course she's got her hands full with two kids and her hands full with her husband as well and uh so you know but we miss her she was helping me as a secretary for many years and a great young person in our church so we hated to lose her but we have connections here and then when I come sometimes you know I get free information about brother Barry coffee from his brothers and there's no charge you know I can get anything I want to get out of them about him and that's a blessing as well well praise the lord well we'll just turn brother Jerry we enjoyed the word that was preached so much and such a blessing to us it was just uh uh very rich last night and the night before and we appreciate we we were listening in between having about 50 people in our home for July 4th uh for uh a birthday of my my daughter's boyfriend and then within the Day activities that boyfriend became they became engaged the same day and we had a lot lot of people at the home and we had fireworks and we had a bunch of stuff going on and in between time though I was listening to the service and wanted to join in and see where the Lord was uh how he was blessing us up here so we're glad to be here got some rest if you wouldn't mind turning tonight we're going to go right to the word of God and uh we're going to turn to John chapter 8 and read the Blessed word of God together and we trust this will be a blessing to you tonight John chapter 8 we want to read in the eth chapter of John and then uh we're going to go to Romans chapter 8 as well John chapter 8 and verse 30 and he spake these words many believed as he spake these words many believed on him and then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so these are simple um words from Jesus that we've expressed for many years but we want to recognize the depth of them if you continue in my word then are you my disciples truly in other words this is an unfolding word all the time this is something that we keep growing with and so you can't bail out you got to continue to grow in it and then uh verse 32 is also significant statement you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free there's only true freedom in truth can you say Amen then answered him we we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free Jesus answered them verily verely I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin sin is unbelief and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed amen Romans chapter 8 and I believe it would be just one verse there verse 21 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God creation is waiting for a release relas from bondage and that release from bondage happens when the Glorious Liberty of the children of God takes place our Liberty and our true Freedom uh starts the freedom uh from bondage from the Earth from creation everything it starts with our freedom it starts with the children of God and it's not just a regular Freedom it is a glorious Freedom it is a glorious freedom and I'd like to speak about that glor glorious Freedom tonight Heavenly Father We Trust Lord that you will you seen these meetings Lord from the foundation of the world and Lord you had a word in season for it Lord you knew who would be here so Lord we trust Lord that you had a word for each one even our precious brother who's traveled so many miles Lord and some of us coming in different places and some locally but Lord you had a word in season for this weekend for us Lord to be able to enjoy to be able to catch on to it and live by it Lord and so we pray that you would just anoint us Lord help us to get out of the way and all of us Lord would just turn to you and sit at your feet tonight and say Jesus speak to me be personal to me Lord give me something for this journey Lord I need it father and I pray you'll answer back we commit the service and all the weekend to you now in this dedication of this special place we commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen God bless you you may be seated I want to speak on the Glorious freedom of the uh the children of God and I want to speak about freedom and bondage a little bit and incidentally the Lord just changed uh my heart just about an hour ago for the subject and so I just I've learned after this many years you got to obey the Lord so I don't know who this was for tonight but we just want to uh take the direction of the Lord and be able to minister and be uh just be able to give what the Lord has given us here upon our hearts so now I just want to speak about freedom and bondage and and talk about the many forms of bondage that Satan has upon people's lives because as you know there's there's not just one form of bondage there's many forms of bondage that Satan has to bind people up and and so now uh there's a there's a slavery as our brother talked about last night and I'll probably be referring quite a bit to what he said last night because I I just touched my wife in the service and I said honey if he keeps going he's not going to leave me anything to preach for the weekend because he was going right down the paths that uh some of the things that we wanted to deal with but when we talk about the many forms of bondage how many know that the Lord is able through truth to deliver from all forms of bondage all forms of bondage it doesn't matter what type it is I remember brother Bram saying one time in the prayer line he said Lord you're able to deliver from any form of disease any form of bondage anything that the devil has concocted that would be a form to bind the human being God has provided a freedom that the human being can be released from any form of bondage I remember the scripture saying that he came and he healed all manner of disease that pretty much covers it all can you say Amen it's just not physically that he's trying to heal and bring freedom but it's every form of bondage it's to set free in every area of a human being's life it's a freedom that's a glorious Freedom can you say amen and it has the power to be able to take all disease and all forms and heal and be able to set a human being free I would say safely that God sends his word in every generation for one made purpose and that's to set the people free from the bondage whether it's religious Bond bondage whether it's a bondage from your past whether it's smoking and drinking and gambling whatever it is even if it's a religious background that's got a person bound he sets free from all he sets free from all and the the unconscious slavery in bondage that a person can be in uh that's what I want to talk about as well because there are there are a there's a slavery sometimes and there's a bondage that the person can be bound by and they don't even know that they're in bondage you say brother Paul where you get that from well I I just read a scripture where Jesus said to the Pharisees and Jews you need to be set free the truth will set you free and they got offensive defensive about it and said wait a minute wait a minute we're Abraham's seed what are you talking about we need we're not in bondage to every any man and yet they were in bondage can you say Amen they were under a bondage but it was a different form of bondage oh they weren't like the world and lived like things of the world but they were under the worst bondage a religious spirit religion can you say amen and actually that religion originated in a word from a prophet Moses that they had taken it and spliced it up and changed it and added to it so much that the very message of Moses became bondage to them I didn't get as many amens on that one but they were the ones who believed the very original message of Moses and yet now after hundreds of years they were in the worst bondage that a person could be in ex but Jesus comes to set free the word comes to set free from any form of bondage and I find sometimes there's people that don't know they're bound they don't know they're under bondage to something and uh I I I I I spent quite a bit of time talking about this and talking and and researching the different forms of and there's many of these things within the message of the hour as well but sometimes it takes you to expose it and talk about it and and talk about what Satan does because Satan is the one that hides things he likes a person to hide things he doesn't like truth because truth is light truth shines light on things that people are bound by Truth uh from the prophet working in the prayer lines and how he be led to expose things that nobody knew about to expose the heart to expose the conscience the the what was what was not conscious there what was laying in the heart and truth and light came and it exposed it why would he come and expose what's laying there that's hidden because he wants to set the person free and from The Prophet's Ministry until today under this word I can tell you the end result is to take your life and many other lives and to take this word and preach truth and when truth is preached if that person will respond they can really be free EX right but it takes the word to expose it it takes Christ's presence to come through the word and expose it and so now bondage many times does not look like bondage uh there are some people you you do realize that there are some people that go to prison for doing certain things and then there are some people their bondage does not look like bonders there's some people that are not physically in prison but they are prisoners uh has anybody ever heard of house arrest uh in the states we have it maybe you don't have any here but house arrest is is a different form of somebody being a prisoner and so sometimes people they're they're walking they get to go home and they get to go to the doctor and they're walking around their house and they have pretty good freedoms but they have an ankle or monitor on or something on them and they can go to the their job sometimes or to the doctor it's restricted but you see they're still a prisoner they're still bound and and sometimes you can't tell they're in bondage by what they look like on the outside I said sometimes you can't tell if a person is under bondage by looking them at the outside sometimes you can sometimes the expression of what they're wearing and what they are and they're maybe their face and their attitude yeah that person's in bondage but sometimes you can't tell if they're in bondage and so this is where we get into is that Satan comes in Hidden form sometimes and there's some people under bondage and they don't realize it this is the the the men that we find in John 8 Jesus is telling the religious leaders you need to be set free by the truth and they said free we're Jews and we're preachers to the Jews what gives you a right to tell us that we're under bondage and the reason they said that they were in bondage to something uh that they were not aware A Ware of the reason they said that is that they did not know the type of bondage that they were under they only knew bondage in slavery as maybe someone being a slave that was a real slave that they only knew slavery to be that way but under the light of the son of man it exposed invisible bondage under the light of the son of man it exposed invisible bondage it exposed all kinds of bondage why why does God do this once again to set the human being completely free I don't know where you're at tonight but listen I can safely say that when he sends a message when he sends his presence with it and when he comes in your life even tonight if you're sitting here if he comes with his presence he's not here to just show off he's not here to just do Miracles and signs but he's here to set the human being completely free by truth and when you hear the truth truth and you respond to truth let it do its work because there's one thing the devil wants you to sit there and go out the same way that you came but God does not want that he wants you to leave different than when you came more free in your heart more free in your spirit that you can lift your hands and leave this place the burden has been lifted the chains have been broken off Hallelujah that's how he wants you to leave every church service that you come to because this is a continual work can you say Amen this is a continual work Hallelujah blessed be his name I can serve a god like that that it's not my Works can you say man but I just expose myself to his presence and to his light and he says ye shall be made free I like being free better than being under bondage so tonight I might get into some things a little bit that you may not expect to be bondages so I asked you to put your seat Bel on they didn't provide seat bels with these pews did they I would encourage you tonight to not to to listen because I may uh just list some things and talk about things that that the devil doesn't want us to talk about that causes the nervousness and causes a a person to be even amongst Believers sometimes but there's something there that's just holding them back can I get an amen there's something there that's holding them back and he wants us to be free praise the Lord so these Jews of course they were Bound By An unconverted nature they had the nature of the serpent and we knew the nature of the serpent and all of us were born with that by the way the nature of the serpent was is to have a religion and have pride with that religion because Cain the the the nature of the serpent and then coming from Cain that then we realize that he had a religion because he worshiped but he wanted to worship his own way he worshiped according to what the way he wanted to worship God has to Deliver Us From The Bondage of wanting to worship our own way and come without blood and so that was what their problem and then they had a religion on top of their serpent nature that was rebellious to the word they and reasoning with the word they had a religion that they developed off of the word of God and then a pride that went with it with that religion that caused them to not believe the truth of the hour Jesus in flesh that's bondage that they could not see what was it that was holding them back from giving their full heart to this manifestation of God before them they were Bound in Chains while they were standing there they were Bound in Chains of the the nature they were of they needed a new birth can you say amen and they needed something to change them to be able to respond to the word the Jews conception of God had them under bondage and all these points I'm bringing here about the Jews then of course would apply them to today the Jews conception of God is what had them bound it was a wrong conception of God they were not bound by worldly things the Pharisees were not bound by worldly things they were Bound by their false conception of God they were Bound by denominational ideas that taught them to be against believing this God veiled in in Christ it can't be God there that couldn't be God look at the way he was born look at all the circumstances and things that were around it their bondage was no freedom to just embrace the anointed word for that day that was standing in front of them that was their bondage and they got defensive and said we're not bound we're in the lineage of Abraham physically we came from him we are not bound to any man or Rome or anybody else and yet Jesus said I'm telling you you're bound they could say the same thing today we're Christians we tie ourselves to Jesus of Nazareth 2,000 years ago but if you're not free to believe the anointed word in flesh right now you're not fully free yet you're not completely free blessed be his name but let me speak of the depth of freedom of a human being that they can come to and they can experience in Christ I would say that we're the ones that puts limitations on the freedom and being free we only go so far and then we still hold to certain things and then I'm sure Satan would work over time to keep from many of the deeper levels of fre Freedom that you could come to that someone could enjoy that they could come into this glorious freedom and boy it was just so wonderful last night to see what were coming into and the unfulfilled part that brother Jerry spoke of that we're under expectation for a and and I believe it's coming more into that perfect love I believe it's but you see now perfect love has to cast out the fear first fear is bondage and so in order to come into something else and come into a greater free freedom and unlimited freedom in your soul in your spirit in your mind in order to come into that then we have to realize that perfect love has to cast out all things cast out that fear and then you begin to come into New Dimensions of freedom I want to be there don't you I want to grow in that so I think the freedom the sun brings is is uh unlimited we're the only ones that limited Satan is the one that limits how free you can be I just asked how free can you be how free can you be in Jesus Christ I think it's us and Satan that puts limitations on it I think there's no no no limitations I think it's to infinity and beyond I I don't think there's any limitations what we or the devil can put on it when we when he makes you free it's beyond just smoking and drinking and the things that fall all of the things of the world but it's a it's a complete freedom of worship and freedom in the heart and freedom of everything in your spirit he doesn't just stop at smoking and drinking it's beyond just habits on the outside it's free to be who you are in Christ Jesus it's free to be your identity that you find in the book of life that is our book of identity that is what's been re revealed to us and I like what the brother said that it's not the identity just of others who' have gone before or even brother bradam no that book revealed all the identities of Sons and Daughters of God and you can't help but become more free when you begin to look at who you really are it brings Freedom can you say man Hallelujah you know I was talking to my church the other day about you know how sometimes they'll have these reunions of of sons and daughters with their fathers I've been speaking about fathers a little bit and uh moving from the fathers even from the Old Testament fathers and so then we'll see somebody who they're reunited on a television show and so they haven't they did the research and they found their father and now they're going to have a big show about it and they're going to come together it reminds me even of Our Lord who uh was a young boy and he probably sometimes would look and wonder why he didn't look like Joseph he'd look in the mirror and look over to his daddy working on the uh cabinets and he looked in the mirror he says that I'm having trouble understanding here because he doesn't look I don't have the characteristics of of Joseph here and so slowly the Revelation begin to break to him and it must have really opened at 12 years old cuz he said I must be about my father's business he recognized who his father really is and finally his mom telling you that this is your birth this is your life Joseph is really not your father and he begin to come into the same Revelation that you have to come into the same one brother bradam came to he says I recognize one day I'm not the son of Charles and El branam but I'm a Son of God but when they have them on these reunions that come together there's such tears and there's such joy and they get together and the first time they seen their father who the real father is and then they get together spend the new next few days and I just wonder as they begin to watch the characteristics of their father then they say Ah that's why I act that way that's why that comes out in me that's why I got a real long nose that's why my ears look the way they do cuz they look at Daddy and they start to see the characteristics and you know what it must just bring some sort of peace to them that now I know where all this comes from are you hearing me spiritually now I'm starting to get where I come from I'm looking at the word and I can't help but think that it brings more freedom to be who you are in Jesus Christ yeah that's Freedom when you're being who you are in free from man's opinion of you freedom from religion this is a freedom that you can never find anywhere except in Christ the word how many believe that the person of the word Christ you can never find this kind of freedom in the world in religion this message is not religion it's completely separate this is a restoration back to true Christianity what is this message it's a full restoration back to true Christianity that's what this message is and it brings us back to be free from any religion any kind of veils on the word you take all the veils off the word and you're seeing it properly it just brings more freedom to your life we're looking at it with no veils praise the Lord so you know how many know that the world has a miscon misconception of Freedom you know do you think a woman that's caught up in the Fashions and styles and the makeup and looking like a phony mannequin looks do you think a woman like that is free she says she's free but no she's not she's not being who God made her as a daughter of God she's Bound by a certain image on Pinterest or wherever it is trying to keep up with all that so they're Bound by another image of what they see of what a woman is to be pretty but if you ask her she can freely she's as free as anything the world has a misconception of Freedom ex right and that's why I say the word has come to set us free I'll just say this about our fine sisters here and our young girls at serving the lord and they walk out in the world day they look a bit odd to the world sometimes quite a bit to the world and they get called names they bear a reproach I always like to say thank you Godly sisters thank you young girls God bless you for holding up the image and this message the reason you do that is not because you're trying to be like Mommy and Daddy the word has restored the Dignity of what a real woman is somebody said the message came to bind women what a lie from the enemy the message didn't come to bind women it come to set women free Hallelujah it came to set our sisters free to be the blessed wonderful image that God has called a woman to be it's restored her dignity back again God bless you sisters for holding up that True Image every day in the world Amen you don't get praised enough Brother Paul's praising you tonight God bless you you remember how much God stands behind you in the moments of persecution the women's Liberation movement claims it freed women but later on some of the original members of The Liberation woman women's Liberation some of them actually come out of it and some of of them even confessed that what they said was freedom for women was actually bondage it actually got them out of their place and put them into more bondage whenever you take the world's selling of what freedom is it's going to end up in bondage it always does can you say Amen praise be to God so now there are many forms of it let me mention one that you wouldn't think but I'm going now and refer referring to the book of Galatians and uh there was some references in the Galatians to Paul saying to the men and I don't know how he noticed this but when he brought them to the Lord into the message of the day then they were set free by that message and then when he visited again something must have happened because he wrote them and he said why will you be in bondage again and he actually uses that bondage three or four times and he says bondage again yeah right why would you be back in bondage again so they were set free by the word of the hour but they went back into bondage and you know who it was precious brothers from Jerusalem yeah in the message exactly I'm going to get in trouble here I know it there were brothers from Jerusalem that come over an influence the new converts to put some add-ons to to the things they needed to do no no no you're not a full Christian yet you haven't made it yet you've got to do some of these things in order to really be in and friends that wasn't unbelievers that wasn't Pharisees that was brothers from Jerusalem in the message and what did they do they brought those new converts right under bondage again right so there are other forms of bondage that can come through sources that you won't you won't expect sometimes and sometimes you got to realize is this truth because if it's not truth then it brings bondage again the influence from another message Church in Jerusalem got them confused in their experience and they wonder how you wonder how Paul detected it that they weren't free anymore I don't know the Bible doesn't say it but he just detected you're not free anymore you're not free something's changed did he look at their body language did he look at their faces uh they didn't have joy anymore they they didn't have the freedom to worship anymore I don't want know what Paul seen but they were under condemnation they were under guilt they were acting kind of awkward to Paul than what they acted before and Paul could recognize it and when he probed he saying what's going on here why are you withdrawn in your spirit why can't you worship freely what has happened and when he when he peeled back the layers and found out the truth he found out that it was brothers that influenced back to circumcision again right exactly right I think that we must be extremely careful how us ministers handle this message because if you add to it or you put quotes together and make something new out of it what you'll do is bind the Believers up you'll bind every time you take something that's not purely the truth from this word and tie it back to the Bible by the way every time you you'll you'll set the people under bondage again but the truth will make you free praise the Lord they say that there's there's different types of uh bondage and people say they have freedom from something while really they're in bondage to something else I'm free to do what I want young people say that I I want to be free to do whatever I want but but that may be bondage too the world's freedom is highly uh cable and and Woos us into a so-called Freedom only to bring us under bondage again one writer said when we use our Liberty as an opportunity for our flesh we stick our head through the Yoke of bondage all over again freedom from discipline is a form of bondage there's a thing called intellectual bondage somebody is bound in their thinking intellectual or mental bondage results from ignorance of spiritual things when people do not H understand the purpose purpose of life and their ultimate potential they are in bondage to ignorance and cannot be saved someone can stop being saved purely by the blood of Jesus Christ because they're bind Bound in their intellect they're Bound in their thinking never going to look at it any different than what their past religion has taught them praise the Lord I believe that we are set free when Paul talked about uh this Freedom he talked about pressing on to the mark of the High Calling of Christ but just before that he says forgetting those things which are behind I press toward the mark so there's no way to press toward the mark as our brother was preaching about into this into this place that God has called to this higher place there's no way to press on to it if we live in our past it's one of my favorite subjects to talk about and maybe it's because after pastoring pastoring 35 years I realize that people can sit there still Bound by their past the past has a power over a life that Satan uses he loves to bind people in their past and that past may not be just in the world and committing a doy that might hang with you I don't know you have to accept the Forgiveness of the Lord you have to let them to wash that away but some of our past Paul's past was not in the world Paul's past just a few scriptures before he said all that I learned as a learning Pharisee and all the religion I learned he said I had to leave it all and count it all as dung that I might come to Christ his past was not smoking and drinking it was a religious past can I get an amen it was a religious past that was a wrong form of looking at God a religious past and in that religious he said had to leave all of that and when he says later on he says forgetting those things which are behind I press toward the mark you have to for forgive accept God's forgiveness and then you have to forget Lord help me to forget Paul in the scripture gives us permission to forget our past it's under the blood I don't want to think about it ever again and when Satan brings it up you remind him it's in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered my God doesn't remember it and I don't want to remember it it's under the blood of Jesus Christ now you're talking Freedom now you're talking Freedom now you're talking pressing toward the mark but you cannot live in both worlds cuz there's a power with your past there's a power with your future look at those people coming up the prayer line of brother brandham look at them coming up and they'd come and sometimes they come up there and he saying Vision he said the doctor said a month ago to this to you and and and sometimes brother Bradon would say now he said don't you think the god that could show me what happened a year ago is the same God that can tell me what's in your future talk about a power the same God who knew your past can forgive you of your past can wash it away from you is the same God who knows your future and there's a power in your fure future in fact your future by predestination will always be more powerful than your past somebody ought to shout praise the Lord the Lord your future as a predestinated Believer will always be the Covenant over your life will always be more powerful than your mistakes it was with Abraham it's with every son of Abraham there is no no mistake that would ever be too big for the Covenant he spoke a covenant over ab's life he spoke a covenant over your life and it covant over your life even when you were in the world that God would just had to get a hold of you there's a covenant over your life as a predestinated seat of God but you see I I'd like to elaborate on this past because it's a bondage people live there and Satan keeps them right there in something in the past and sometimes it's not what you did in the world sometimes it's within the church somebody Did You Wrong a preacher Did You Wrong somebody in the church spoke something against you somebody said something really bad about you somebody tried to ruin your reputation I told brother Jerry today when he started to talk on that perfect love I was on that series on the excellent way which is perfect love I was on a STS I spent about 6 months talking about it sounds like he did too and we haven't talked at all but but God is bringing things to the bride around the world she's taking her to a higher place it's into this Inner Room can you say Amen it's in this place that no man has hardly ever went before because God's called The Bride to it but listen now God moves you in there and God's going to for you have to realize that your past it's it's a it's a predestination for you to be in there and for God to move you into that place of perfect love and I was saying saying to him that you know as as he was preaching I preached on that excellent Way series I have never been more tested in all my life on showing Divine love to people I had some things said about me that I've never you know I just kind of lay low there in the Michigan area and just do my thing and for the kingdom and and you realize you know the devil won't let it alone you know I just want to I just want to H just lay low but I tell you the devil's he's always trying to bring something up and I was so challenged and tested and it's because our our brother said he said whatever the next place is that we're moving into is where we'll be tested the most and where there'll be so tribulation around it cuz God's moving you into something else but your past may not be something now that is adultery from the past but your past may be something that happened within this message you know we got a lot of history in this message now we got 6070 years we've got a lot of history Israel had a lot of history a lot of things went on in their history some good some bad and some ugly and we might as well admit it we got a lot of the characteristics that the children of Israel had 40 years wandering around the mountain in bondage and I was going to speak a little bit about this tonight after 40 years then God come down and said to the new generation you have circled this mountain long enough you have cycled all of these immaturities long enough and he told the new generation he actually said the old ones won't go in except Caleb and Joshua but all of those will die off but I'm promising the new generation you're going to come into the land Hallelujah but you got to turn northward you got to move away from these brothers that's holding you back so I'm ready to go forward can you say Amen what was preached this week and I'm ready to move forward and I hope I'm a Caleb I know we got some brother Ivan such a joy to see him brother Gerald we got some calebs here that is held to this word and they're going in with us a lot of preachers that are older preachers have messed up went into idolatry a lot of things we're not here to talk about that but thank God we got some Joshua and calebs here tonight and they're going they're saying to the new generation let's go let's turn northward let's get to the final thing of this message oh they had miracles in their past they had good things they had signs they shouted they had all of that and I'm not against any of it I I was in my church Sunday I was jumping around going running around the church doing a victory walk myself I love to do that but I tell you it wasn't the Miracles or the shouting that got them into the Promised Land exactly right you don't shout your way into the promised land no it's going to take a faith it's going to take getting past your fear can you say Amen it's going to take freedom to say I'm free to be who I am in Christ I want to go forward can you say that I want to finish this work praise the Lord I want to go forward I don't know if I told this last time but I got a precious brother that interprets for me in Honduras when I go his brother's Bill Sanchez from Lorraine Ohio and he keeps me going because when I go on a mission trip I'm not a missionary I admit that I don't go very often and I especially don't go too far from where I can see the golden arches I am not a missionary we have been on some trips and they asked us to go out a little bit and I'm always leer say Lord are you leading me out here because I know you'll protect me so we go out but this brother is so encouraging because he says hey you know what don't worry about it I'll get sick on the food and I'm I'm hoping for the next city we'll have a decent motel and I'm doing he says we go forward that's his thinging we go forward it's the only thing he gets me through we go forward brother Paul and no matter what's happening we go forward I can hear his voice in my ear right now we go forward brother Paul and I don't feel like going forward I feel like going home close to the Golden Archers close to my wife's cooking close to my wife we go forward brother Paul and that's the only thing helped me make it through and you know we stayed in the most poorest place in Nicaragua and he's checking out a motel for us I probably told this when I was here before but it's an example of his you know anyway I I said go up and ask and he's trying to get our room at this motel and I said brother Bill ask them if they got roaches and stuff like that and the the the owner said through brother Bill I said no no no no roaches no we just we had the company come and there's no roaches no roaches whatsoever I said said all right I sat down in the lobby brother Bill's up there negotiating the price and while I'm sitting there this big roach about that big is walking across the lobby right in front of me he has no shame it's like he's strutting you know and it's like he turns back and smiles at me he walks right in front of me I said brother Bill brother Bill tell the owner look look it here's a roach right here and and and the and the owner said oh yeah yeah he leaving he leaving he leaving I said bill you know what brother Bill said we go forward brother we go forward I'm telling you friends if you don't hear anything else tonight to the Young Generation and to the calebs we go forward I want to go forward I don't want to go backwards I don't want to go to the past and I was telling somebody today sometimes when I was a kid I'd go to meetings and I'd hear the meetings and I I felt like this word was taking taking us somewhere sometimes I don't feel that as much as I used to and I want to feel it last night I felt it this word is not taking us backwards this word is not taking us back to Pentecost can I say it again this message is not to take us back to Pentecost it's to take us to something greater we want all of it we want Pentecost we want all all the restoration but it's to take us into something greater rapturing Faith Can you say Amen we go forward we don't want to dwell in the past forgetting those things Paul gives us permission to forget why because it's bondage to live in the past if you're living there tonight it's time to pray hit this altar pray in your heart say God I must forget all of those things that are behind I must forgive and forget what my brother has done to me what the preachers have said about me I must leave it alone because if I lay awake and lose sleep over that then I'm going to be bound by it I'm not useful for the kingdom when I'm sitting losing sleep over what somebody said about me forget it and move on can I have an amen toight forget it and move on it's time to move on there's such thing is financial bondage and people live in debt and people are under Financial bondage is slavery we know the scripture says that Financial bondage occurs when selfishness greed and materialism sometimes take over sometimes it's not that you just get behind and you want to do things right and you want to be able to but it can bring a bondage to you no Financial bondage can can can bring a family down and we understand that but we have a God that's able to open the doors for you to get out of that there's such a thing as emotional bondage all locked up with bitterness and fear and past abuse and past legalistic teaching legalistic atmospheres that you lived in before that bound you emotionally scared you a performance-based church is everybody listening a performance-based church maybe even in the message that are judging by the performance of how best the people are dressed and and so that brings fear upon you you never can measure up I say preach the word preach the clothes preach all of it but when you got an atmosphere that brings fear brother Jerry said it last night that law from the Old Testament that was a dispensation of fear this is a dispensation of Capstone love that doesn't mean water Dow the word can you say man it doesn't water down the word but there's something greater that we have with the word and that's his presence that's his love you can't live by the bondage of fear fear trying to live this message you can't live this message under fear has to be about Christ has to be I'm set free to serve him I'm set free to dress this way I've been set free to live this way amen so you can't have that emotional bondage from the past hanging on to you you have to come out of that you have to move from that you ha you have to come into something that is a away from the past legalistic teaching praise be to God even in Deuteronomy they took the law of Moses and they made it they made it a law brother Bram said they did the worst thing and I believe it was uh Exodus there he said that the worst mistake Israel made is to choose law instead of Grace the pure message that was come is to come with grace for you to to live it because you Delight in him you Delight in his law but when it's not a delight anymore it becomes bondage in fear the very message can become bondage in fear we need to come out of all that bondages can be in addictions there's so much that promises Freedom that is actuality brings bondage and addictions we live in addicted Society it merely transfer it into a different form rather than conquers the dependency at its core they say while they promise them Liberty they themselves are slaves of corruption it's in second Peter chapter 2 while they promis them Liberty they themselves are slaves of corruption by whom a person is overcome by him also he is brought into bondage when a behavior of use of a substance BEC com becomes compulsive despite harmful consequences it is an addiction in all of its forms addiction is ultimately bondage to yourself your flesh your Cravings addiction is a form of slavery in which millions are bound by today all kinds of addictions but we might as well give it the name that the word gives it it's slavery it's slavery rejection is a bondage Bound by the lack of faith in yourself in the word of God fear rejection complexes are bondage we could go on and on and on tonight comple is that you're never accepted you never measure up people you know uh you're always worried about what people are thinking about you you know the first 30 years of my life I worried about what people were thinking about me and then I spent the next 30 Years not caring what people are thinking about me and then they say I'm going to find out really nobody was really thinking about you what a waste of time we waste so much time in our complexes worried about what other people are thinking about us that's not Freedom what matters most is what God thinks about us come on now his you know his opinion is the one I'm most interested in am I pleasing to the Lord but you can live your life and know that about the Lord and still be bound by what people think of you you have to be set free from that amen is anybody getting anything here tonight hey the Lord told me to do this this is kind of on the Fly tonight but I'm telling you I believe this message has come to set us free from every form of addiction every form of disease glory be to God hallu Bound by unrealistic expectations of life or of people Bound by unrealistic expectations of life of people Bound by too being too busy is that a bondage no time for God that was them in Egypt Pharaoh increased their workload Same Spirit today and sometimes you don't have a choice it increases your workload working so hard but we must be careful that it doesn't C catch us in a bondage that we have no time for the Lord can you say Amen praise the Lord so we we realize that we you know God is forming us God is making us God is longing to set us free here tonight and he sent the word and I could say more about the Jews there but I think you understand and and what he said there H uh to the Jews that they didn't realize the bondage they were in these are the type of things that the Lord will show us and will grow and he'll form us and sometimes it takes many years working on us forming us can you say Amen now my my granddaughter I only have one I have two uh grand babies coming but I have just one and she's almost five and so we really love her we we think she's great and she you know she has all the things to correct Papa and set him right sometimes and uh you know the and the other day I went to make her a waffle and uh I couldn't find the syrup I said oh Ellie I can't find the syrup syrup I got your waffle but I can't find no I couldn't find the the chocolate chips she likes on it couldn't find the chocolate chips and I said Ellie I can't find I'm looking everywhere and she just goes Papa you're killing me you know she walked right in that kitchen went right up to the right cupb and got those things down and that was it she had it like that smart little cookie but she's into this slime thing you know everything's about slime I don't know why kids like slime she watch watches video of people with their fingers and all this slime and I don't understand any of it but I do it cuz she's my granddaughter and you know so then she had some slime and she wanted to make things he said Papa you make this and I'll make this over here so I didn't know anything else to do so I got real spiritual I said I'm going to form a pyramid out of this slime and I started to form that and form it and I took about 15 20 minutes she had went through a bunch of characters and done it and then she messes it up starts again but I was going to take my time in this pyramid and really build it and it really you know what I I learned something in this time with my granddaughter with slime I learned something the more that I kept forming that with my fingers and the more time I took with it the closer and closer and nicer look like a real nice pyramid and I got a spiritual thought of it that's the Lord working on this bride the more time he has the more we yield oursel and he just takes his Loving Hands and just forms and forms and forms and he and the more time I spent on it are you listening friends this is your loving Lord this is and and if there's any bondage he's going to take it out can you say amen and he's forming this statue of a perfect man and the more I got the more man this is really looking good this is really looking nice and then Ellie comes over and looks I said look look at this beautiful pyramid and she goes like that it's gone so then I got to start all over aren't you glad he doesn't Throw the Clay Away he's the Potter doesn't Throw the Clay Away he keeps molding and making and forming us now some years ago um I read this quote quite a few years ago it's always been a help to me I know some of you are familiar with it but in this subject to challenge us tonight why am I not fully free are you fully free as a Christian in the Lord this freedom in Christ is unlimited so if there's restrictions you've got to find what the Restriction is before you can really be set free you know you can pray so hard for someone and this is what we learned in this quote you can pray so hard for someone but if you don't know the cause of their bondage and expose it your prayer can only go so far and that's not me that's from the prophet now you can pray and pray and pray but if there's a form of bondage there it will limit the freedom it will limit the answer coming and he goes into this and talks about it now I'll I'll read this quote um I didn't have a chance to give it to the brothers so you just have to listen close but I'll read this some of you have heard it before but it teaches us quite a bit and the reason I'm reading it is because it uses that scripture uh he who the son is set free shall be free indeed ye shall know truth and you understand tonight it's truth it's really only truth that will really set us free and that's not just Doctrine that's right you say truth well the serpent seed revealed and the godhead and it's not just that you know that has set some people free free free from trinitarianism free from realizing that they're from the serpent but they come from God the these truths always set people free but it's not just doctrinal truths that come to people that set them free it's all truth from God so he said many times people come to the house that's been in my meetings and so forth and they failed to get healed they wonder why then when they come in maybe there's some hidden something back in their life that they haven't done or should have done and maybe they'd maybe they'd forgotten about it maybe that's the very cause that the brother laying his hands on them or anointing them with the oil at the church whatever it is they didn't get healed listen friends you've got to find the cause before you find the Cure absolutely if you went to a doctor said Doctor I'm having a headache a persistent headache he says well take this and he gives you a few aspirins he's not a doctor he's trying to get rid of you now the only thing is that doctor if he's a real doctor he would diagnose that case till he find out finds out the cause of that headache then work from there now if you pray for some a person that doesn't get well then there's something somewhere causing it because God's Sovereign to his word he's got to stay with his word Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if a man repents and is baptized he is absolutely God is Duty bound to give him the Holy Ghost if he's repented from his heart why T why wait for a long time is because there's something here that isn't right correctly you say well maybe God just don't want to give it to me me oh yes he does you take every bit of maybe the Holy Ghost is not is only for just so many God has got plenty of it for you don't worry could you imagine a little fish about that long standing out in the middle of the ocean swimming around saying say I better drink of this water kind of sparingly because I might run out someday well that's just about like thinking God has got enough Holy Spirit for you that's right could you imagine a little mouse under the Garners of Egypt there where they stacked with a billion tons and the little mouse says why better not eat about one or two grains a day because I might run out this winter my that's like trying to think that God hasn't got Grace enough to save you heal you and he's wanting to do it to you more than you are ready to receive it that's right sure he wants to do it could you imagine all the waters in the world packed into a a standpipe about that big around and it would go a thousands and thousands of miles around the air and how the pressure of that water coming down pressing down trying to find one little CP us to get out of that's the way the love of God and the healing power is trying to pour in this meeting tonight trying its best everywhere God trying to make his way into a heart with that pressure of divine love and will and everything trying to press his way into the people if you just know the right approach you could walk right up and just receive it it's amazing how he didn't take an extreme he's trying to show the love of God trying to pour on the people to what to do to set them free so then he talks about hindrances because you got all that love it's not a problem with God but a person can have something that's unresolved and it holds back all that he says because if God promised anything and you don't receive it there's something wrong people come sometime I haven't got time tonight to go into detail I will maybe this week on a testimony but how that people come from everywhere well I failed to get it brother brandom and the lady come not Longo saying that something told her that she had Seven Devils another person told her she had five and she wanted to know where the four fourth went poor woman Plum gone nearly sat in a room taking off her stockings and pulled her feet up in the chair said I haven't eaten for several days and I'm not going to eat any anything till I find out what become of those devils and said what are they I said I don't know I'd never know anything about it said well one Minister told me uh notice now ministers yeah these were ministers who said this one Minister told me I had seven devils and the other lady Minister said I had only five now there's two of them gone somewhere now see and come and stay there about two hours in my house until God began to speak two hours nervous neglecting her home and family you've read this before what is it it's it's not something in the world it's actually being in in certain environments that gave a word of the Lord that was not accurate can I say this we better be careful when we give a word of the Lord over people and make sure that it's right exactly right because you're playing with God's people and you better be careful that you don't label something a demon because some situations it's not yeah it's easy to just label everything where your demon possessed you got nervousness so your demon possess that's a demon on you you better be careful you better make sure what it is we have to follow the wisdom of the lord we have to pray because you can pronounce something on somebody that brings bondage sometimes the rest of their lives I can't I should be getting more amens this is solid teaching from the word of God and I'm saying these two ministers did not have it accurate and they ministers that gave a word of the Lord that the was were demons and she's taken this lie remember now a lie brings you under bondage too somebody tells a lie on you the the the lady that come to the prayer in deep call to the Deep you said they're saying you're a witch remember deep call to the Deep film they're saying you're a witch that's what people are saying and she believed that lie can you give me a few more minutes tonight lies if you believe a lie that's told on you it will bring you under bondage because there's only freedom in the truth Paul said it would be be delusion to believe a lie and be damned by it in other words there's a delusion that goes with a lie that you can't freely believe the truth anymore and so he prays for this woman all these people saying she's a witch and I love it as she goes off he says go in go in peace now and he says you're not a witch you're not a witch because he's telling her the truth everything you've said they've said by the preachers and the people have said about you it's not true there's no no truth to it at all but when you begin to believe the lies this woman was full of physical ailments and nervousness because of what not because she had demons because she believed some preacher's lie brother and for this lady he said God be to speak and I said lady you come from L St Louis she said how did you know that I said your husband's on the police force she said how'd you know that said you used to be a lovely housekeeper she said that's right I said recently your house looks like a hog pin said that's right I said your daughter's over there now taking care of your husband said that's right who told you that I just kept talking because I was in a vision and I said you went down to a little place first you went to a doctor he gave you shots yes yes those shots was called harmones yes I said you went down to a place and they told you you had Devils yes because you had a real funny feeling yes they sent you to California yeah and some man told you you had seven dadles yes you went to a woman she said you had five Devils yes and they told you to come to me yes that's right how did you know all that I said the holy spirit said so I said lady you haven't got any Devils to begin with notice how now the truth the truth starts to come and just because brother braham's gone doesn't mean the truth can't come to you friends the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we'd all depend and love to have that gift but let me tell you something he's still here he still knows all things he knows all the bondages in our life and he can speak peace to somebody he's still here even tonight this nervousness that she had now began to release and he said lady he said he said surely you know your mother your mother went through menopause it's the menopause it's something natural and I said what do you know what do you think the harmone shots are for she said I don't know I said for the change of life that's what it is there's no Devils at all it's just absolutely it's just your condition of life and she began to relax my wife was cooking some bacon and eggs out there and she began to look through the house I said are you a little bit hungry are kind of hungry she had refused to eat but here now she said she went out and ate three eggs a big bunch of toast two cups of coffee a lot of jelly so what he said it's a breakfast like I like like this morning's brunch but she ate a lot and she was just as happy as she could be she said brother brandom are you going to pray for me and cast it away I said cast what away she said the the the thing you imagine how much your mind has concocted all these things based upon a lie that's bondage are you going to pray for the the thing I said there's nothing to Cast Away she said well I never felt so good in my life said what am I still do I said he said go home straighten up your house cook your husband a nice big apple pie about that thick and when he comes in tonight throw both your arms around him kiss him sit down get on his lap tell him you love him and live like a lady ought to that's exactly that's all there is you see all the pouring on of oil all the Stomping all the kicking all the loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of good it's the truth that sets you free and he uses that scripture in an incident like this which is allows us to say it's not just doctrine that he sends his truth it's all truth to set the human being completely free this truth is for you tonight this truth is for every person sitting here tonight you live under our word you say well I'm in the message this not about being in the message you live under a truth of the Lord speaking that can speak life into you can speak Freedom into your life can you say Amen brothers and sisters true freedom freedom to worship freedom to dance I have been given a second chance it's a song I'm speaking a song maybe I'll sing it here in a minute freedom to worship freedom to dance I have been given a second chance I'm not going back to the enemy's Kingdom cuz I've tasted Freedom glory be to God Amen let me finish this you shall know the truth and the truth makes you free you shall know the truth it'll set you free that's right so many times sure in a group you'll find lots of people when you bring three or 400 people through the line there's many clean pure hearts in there that comes through and gets healed that's right but there's some that we have to get back and pick up the struggles the strugglings like that that fails it now we can only do that as God says do now did you know if a man that was given power or faith not power not himself to do it but faith in God to do it to cast out an evil spirit and would do it outside of God's will would get himself in trouble there's another element of Truth there that man can get in trouble with God if if if he goes to try to cast a spirit out and do something outside of the will of God God that's why we have to be so careful why is he saying that that devil has a right to stay right there until the truth exposes something hidden or unknown or confession comes you cast out the devil but the person has not been set free yet if there is a devil there you cast it out but they haven't been set free because something else is bonding them binding them as as we close tonight I want to look at Jesus statement a slave or a servant will never stay or permanently be a part of the family of the house if they stay in bondage of any kind any bondage will limit you from the full Kingdom and that's what Jesus said a slave or a servant in a house he doesn't he's not going to stay there forever CU he'll probably get traded he's going to go to another house he's never has the same privileges in the house as a son and daughter does so a slave is in the house but he says if the son if we can just maybe read it again the way he says it whosoever commit he said verse 35 in chapter 8 and we're closing the servant abideth not in his house forever but the son abideth forever all right so a servant doesn't abide in the house because he's not a son but then he says if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed so now now you may have slavery you may have come from slavery you may be in bondage as our brother preached last night that they had a slavery mentality even in the children of Israel I thought about last night 400 years of bondage that was stuck in their minds no wonder after 40 years they still got a slavery mentality because it takes a lot to burn that out of their mind until Joshua and Caleb rise to the cun can you say amen and and God's so so disappointed in the the confessions that are and and you know the Young ation I want to say don't be discouraged by all sometimes you hear all the stuff and all the drama and and that it can discourage young people don't get your eyes on all that movement and what's going on get your eyes on Christ amen because the Bible says those young people it discouraged their heart when they came back with K cadis barnea they said we can't do it these were brothers that were saying we can't go that far thankfully an older brother Rises and say wait a minute we're more than able to take the land to try to encourage the new generation we're more than able to go into this third pole we're more than able to go into this land it takes courage it takes statements of Faith confession can you say amen amen it encourages someone else I'm here to do that I'm here in Newan for no other reason but to encourage you let's go forward can you say Amen we go forward praise the lord we don't care about the roaches coming across the the lobby can you say say Amen we go forward but you see now he he said he the son who's if you're in that house you probably have to go to another house but if the son comes to you and says I'm the son but I'm going to grant you your freedom as soon as he grants that freedom you can stay in the house forever and that's the only thing that changes is when the son makes contact with you brings your out out of your slavery and says now you've been set free by the son so you can stay you're in his kingdom you'll never have to go again you can stay you can stay amen doesn't matter how old you're getting you can stay we'll keep you we're keeping brother Barry so we're keeping you a lot of the older ones were keeping he who the son is sets free you can try to get it any other way but when he the son of man sets free you have truly been set free you don't have to go back to any bondage and I think of those young people latching hold of that what Caleb said and that new generation said we're going to go forward we're going to take this thing the whole book of Deuteronomy is to the new generation I'll speak a little bit more about it in the morning you look at this transition look what's taking place the calebs that are here the Young Generation here God's doing something special in this church God's doing a special transition it's a very respectful transition I've watched it from a distance I've I've kept in contact and watched these things God has done something special among you because if God terries he's got some young people he's raising up and there's a connection holding hands with the old to the new can you say amen and say we're going to take the rest of this land we're going to go into our full promise and we're going to do it with all of us can you say amen he who the son sets free ISE free indeed can you say amen I tried to get my granddaughter out of she was sent to the corner she got in trouble the other day so she was in the corner had to be quiet I don't know if you do that but her parents do that grandparents don't like it we don't like any discipline that you parents are doing so she's in the corner and she's you know looking real sad and I I went over I said you got in trouble and I I knew I'd like to get her out of the corner but I couldn't so you know I did I went and sat in the corner with her you know she's she's in bondage so I just like Jesus I I sat with her till she could get out of bondage and I sat down there right in the corner this much as I could fit in there and I said honey you know what can we do you're so sad I can't get you out but we could do something you want to play toys or no I'm just no I don't want to do papa no I said do you want want to sing Jesus loves the little children all the oh papa don't sing that no no don't sing that she want to sing you want you want to sing I've been touched by a fire she sings all these S I tried all of them I said how about how about the song bright in the corner where you are I got a song for everything you know she didn't know that one but she didn't want to sing I thought that was a perfect song you kids that's a special song you need to learn that for when you're in the corner bright in the corner where you are brighten someone all right well hone you just got to stick with it stay here I know you're sad but you're going to get out of this you're going to get out of this I was encouraging her and actually because I was there because Mommy and Daddy were watching from the couch she got out earlier because I was there your heavenly father knows the the bondage that you're in and he doesn't want you to stay there he's here tonight to minister to you whatever that you say well I I don't even know what it is brother Paul I I and and the reason the Lord switched this tonight I just I I felt today something that just speak about nervousness speak about a bit of instability God doesn't want you to be bound by being nervous God has a bomb in Gilead to calm your nerves there's a lot going on in the world but I don't know why the Lord T me this direction but I pray it ministers to every one of you here tonight he who the son sets free he sets free indeed truly he knows about the B you say I don't even know what it is I talked to a sister the other day uh one of our ministers wies she's going through her hard time she said what is it can we talk about I said I'm not a prophet I do I don't know but God knows the core the cause of it and so we just kept talking we talked about things and she begin to settle down because if you just keep sometimes if you keep talking you keep ministering they keep being open sometimes the devil gets exposed and they starts to feel free in their heart but even if you don't know tonight you need to rest that God knows all things he's he's aware of All the nervousness he's aware of all the things that hold you back but I think that ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free there is unlimited Freedom that God gives a human being if they'll respond to him that you can be free can you say Amen can you give me two minutes to read what you can be free from free from condemnation free from addictions free from hypocrisy free from the Fashions of the world free from the movies of this world free from worry free from Fear free from the damage of another person's criticism free from comparing yourself with other people free from going back to that trash that you've

set free of that free from a message Pride that says you're better than everybody else we're not better than everybody else we're not better than denominational people can you say amen I like to say this because we get a message Pride except for the grace of God none of us are any better it's his grace that brought us in and we speak against the systems but like brother Bram it's not the people in those systems we don't have a right to put them in a category can you say Amen you need to be free from any message Pride that makes you feel like you're better we're only better through his grace can you say Amen but you got to be free of that free from depression free from lifting your critical thinking above the word of God free from free to follow the lord alone to have and and and while

your strength brother Jerry sister Debbie and all you guys remember my dad singing that and laughing the way he did my dad he wasn't different at home than he was when he was singing he was a jolly happy guy he enjoyed this word he enjoyed his family he enjoyed the Lord and he's an example to me when I get down that he was happy and the word made him happy he was a happy man I watched them as a kid we traveled the country uh and Canada United States and Canada and I travel all of our young years we traveled in a station wagon in a van and uh I watched my dad go into places and God used them in a certain way and uh I think some of those churches were so starchy they were messes churches but they were like a Catholic Church going in there they're like a Methodist church and they looked like they hadn't worshiped freely for years and my dad would go in there and start bringing that word and then he'd say a little something here say and I I'd see people laugh that hadn't laughed in 30 years they forgot how to laugh have you forgot how to laugh you're missing good medicine the Bible says it I believe if anybody can laugh and enjoy life if anybody can the believer in this hour can be the happiest people on the face of the Earth you got something to be happy about you got something to have real Joy about you got something to shout about can you say Amen he'd go in there I sitting Le next to a lady there in some in Arizona in church she hadn't laughed I know in 30 years she got to laughing and she couldn't stop my Dad tried to go on to a serious point and she wouldn't she was cackling in her seat and she couldn't stop laughing and I thought she was going to have a heart attack I appreciate my dad I miss my dad I miss him when he would come to the office after every service and say Paul that was a masterpiece I miss that cuz I know every one of those sermons was not a Masterpiece but it felt good for Dad to say it he was an encourager he was a man of joy and he sing that Laughing Song and have everybody laughing they hadn't laughed for a long time we are free to be happy even when others are drawing you into out of your out of their Circle you're free to be happy can

Deliverance of nature itself what the liberty of the children of God look how powerful it is look what the message brings us a freedom never known this way since the fall in the garden when the bride comes into this glorious Liberty and pulls all creation into it as well that tells me something it's a person's freedom and happiness in Christ that are people that people are drawn to do you know other people will be drawn to you when you're free and happy in the Lord nobody is drawn to a message believer who looks like they've been baptized in prune Jews nobody's drawn to that morbid and all depressed and debating the word and never a smile nobody's drawn to that but unbelievers come around somebody who's free by the blood of Jesus Christ they're happy in Christ they're content in Christ you don't have to preach a lot of message or that that speaks for itself and it draws people can you say Amen people are drawn to this glorious Liberty that God's called us to I don't know friends can

than anything you can do you cannot put it away you cannot undo it he said it unconditionally I will have a bride she will be spotless she will be without wrinkle she will be dressed in my righteousness she is mine nothing we can do can stop it amen you know as he was talking about that it struck me that song about he's in the house because remember what the scripture says it says that which maketh manifest is light now brother Paul I think you probably stepped on some toes at moments here tonight not because so often see Satan hides in shame he hides in Secrets he hides in the idea that I'm the only one that's dealing with this when I talk to our young people I say do you know how many people have already suffered with this that are suffering with this even today some of us as adults amen there is nothing new Under the Sun there's nothing you can say that God hasn't already delivered from Paul said such were some of ye and they had filthy dirty nasty lives and then he says you know what I was worse than all of you cuz I had a religious spirit and didn't know it he can save you from the right wing he can save you from the left wing he can deliver you from anything you're under tonight and he can bring you into the Glorious light of this word amen he said you have to find the cause before you can find the Cure that takes an honest heart before God Amen we can't listen to services like this and say oh that's for him that's for her no Lord where's my blind we where's my blindness where's my weakness where's that spot that I haven't seen yet you I was talking to brother Joe and we were talking just as we were going to him from Brother Jim's Hospital there his room and and we are talking about while Jesus was talking to the disciples the scripture says they had no understanding of what he was talking about he told them what was going to happen they didn't recognize it it went on they were in the presence of the revealed word and had no clue it was about and he asked me the question he says how much are we missing how much are we missing message Believers that's not what get that's not what takes us in is being a message believer it's having the light of the Living Word In Your Heart by the new birth which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit and then it makes that word live and then what happens is as we're going to sing this song when he comes in you know we we we have that other song when Jesus comes the tempter's power is broken amen he takes the Gloom of sin and fills the life with Glory he makes the difference the Living Word in your life personally makes the difference church I've had religious Spirits I've had demonic spirits and he has delivered me from them all you know what I may come under certain things in my faults and failures but he'll deliver me from from them all if I can only by the preaching of the word under the mirror of the word say it doesn't reflect his Perfection so Lord will you change me into his Perfection oh it takes a heart that says I need him in the house cuz somebody else has bound the strong man has bound the strong woman tonight let's sing the song he's in the house and say Lord take this house these are dedication meetings it's to thank him for the physical building but he dwells in a temple that is not made with hands it is the fleshly tables of our hearts it's in human flesh it's Christ revealed in you and I but we've got to say Lord I want you in there more than anyone else cuz only you can tell me what's wrong you can go to the root of the issue and you can take it out and I'll be free and free indeed amen and I'll have that joy unspeakable I'll have that that life I'll have that love I'll have that joy that peace that rest amen but he's got to be in the house let's sing
