[43:35] [Applause]
[43:38] is
[43:43] heavenly father
[43:44] lord as we look in the scriptures
[43:46] lord it seems like every time you sent a
[43:48] visitation
[43:49] the words that they said first were fear
[43:51] not
[43:53] lord you brought peace
[43:55] lord you brought rest to the situation
[43:56] when you appeared
[43:58] and lord we're trusting you'll bring
[43:59] peace and rest this morning to our lives
[44:01] heavenly father as we've set aside this
[44:03] time this day to just spend time in your
[44:06] presence lord to fellowship with you
[44:08] lord we're asking the grace of your
[44:10] presence lord to just be in this service
[44:11] to speak to hearts and lives heavenly
[44:14] father lord you know what each one needs
[44:16] lord i've laid myself before you and
[44:19] study but we're trusting you to lead
[44:20] this morning heavenly father lord that
[44:22] you would just have your way we ask lord
[44:24] grant me grace give me strength to
[44:26] preach this morning lord god lord and
[44:28] give the the hearers grace to hear it we
[44:30] pray lord just have your way now we ask
[44:32] in jesus christ's name we pray
[44:34] amen god bless you
[44:37] and then turn to hebrews 11 if you would
[44:39] this morning hebrews chapter 11.
[44:41] let me start reading the first verse
[44:43] amen pray for me this morning i've been
[44:45] sick
[44:46] but if ron spencer can preach with stage
[44:49] four cancer then i can preach with a
[44:51] sore throat and a cold amen so just
[44:53] trusting that my voice will make it
[44:54] through the service
[44:56] amen hebrews chapter 11
[44:59] very familiar scripture of course
[45:03] verse 1 says now faith
[45:05] is the substance of things hoped for
[45:07] the evidence of things not seen
[45:09] for by it the elders obtained a good
[45:11] report down to verse 6 it says but
[45:14] without faith it is impossible to please
[45:16] him for he that cometh to god must
[45:18] believe that he is
[45:20] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[45:23] diligently seek him i mean god bless his
[45:25] word you can be seated this morning
[45:27] i want to take a a few services on on a
[45:29] new topic this is no by no means a a big
[45:32] series we're going to do but i want to
[45:33] take a a serious title of authority to
[45:36] believe and then authority to believe
[45:37] and in studying this and
[45:40] and just uh the different things that
[45:42] have been going on in my own life in the
[45:43] lives of others it struck me how so
[45:46] often in life we are we are in a
[45:48] position we're in a place of
[45:50] responsibility and because we are there
[45:52] we're expected to have everything it
[45:54] takes to be good at doing that amen so
[45:57] as a parent perhaps you get married and
[45:59] you have a child and the expectation is
[46:01] that you're going to raise that child
[46:02] exactly right and that you're going to
[46:03] do all things well and that you're going
[46:05] to know what to do in certain situations
[46:07] and you're going to know how to do it
[46:08] and you're going to have the discernment
[46:09] to know when the baby is just trying to
[46:11] pull one over on you when it's genuinely
[46:12] in pain and when it's genuinely in need
[46:14] you know and and you come into different
[46:16] situations in life maybe as an employee
[46:18] and you're promoted to boss for the
[46:20] first time and all of a sudden everybody
[46:22] isn't it but i want to tell you today if
[46:24] you have the holy ghost you have faith
[46:26] for the rapture amen now you may not
[46:28] realize you have it but you have the
[46:29] capacity for faith for the rapture today
[46:32] brother branham says when you get the
[46:33] holy ghost he says you have the ability
[46:35] to create a world and go live on it but
[46:37] you can't because the laws of god forbid
[46:39] you from doing it it's not in his will
[46:40] or his way so if you've got enough faith
[46:42] in you if you've got enough power in you
[46:44] to go create a world and live on it then
[46:45] you've got enough faith in you to go and
[46:47] take a rapture amen to rise from the
[46:49] dead even you know as christ did this
[46:51] morning amen but i want to to read a
[46:53] quote here and i don't have it in the
[46:55] slides there for the matter brother
[46:56] vaishal so i'm going to just read it
[46:57] from my phone this morning because i i
[46:59] was listening to as the eagle stir her
[47:01] nest this morning and and it struck me
[47:03] because i had some examples and i
[47:05] thought i'll just use what the prophet
[47:06] shared this morning so i'm going to read
[47:08] it from my phone here and he's he's
[47:09] talking about the mother eagle and she's
[47:10] made her nest and and she's put the eggs
[47:12] in there and then they they
[47:15] they've hatched and they've grown into
[47:16] into little eaglets he says and she's
[47:19] sitting there and knocking off all those
[47:21] little old feathers out because if they
[47:22] don't they don't have enough feathers
[47:24] left to take the flight she won't take
[47:26] them until all them little old baby
[47:28] feathers blows out of them so
[47:30] you see little baby birds when they're
[47:31] born they just have basically little
[47:32] dustings of fur and and feathers on them
[47:34] they're not flight feathers they're just
[47:36] warmth feathers but he says that little
[47:37] mother that mother eagle is knocking out
[47:39] all those little ones so that they can
[47:41] grow in the big feathers that will help
[47:43] them to fly amen
[47:44] he says but then she comes from up there
[47:46] and she screams she is ready to give
[47:49] them some experience then she throws her
[47:51] great big 14 foot wings out like that
[47:53] and these little eagles reach over and
[47:55] climb up she's talking to them because
[47:57] they have heard her voice they know to
[47:59] trust her how to fly and she says now
[48:02] children i'm going to take you on a solo
[48:04] flight and each one goes over and gets
[48:06] his little foot and catches onto the
[48:08] wing puts his little bill against one of
[48:09] them feathers he says he can pull it out
[48:12] it'll hold 50 eagles for the power of
[48:13] that feather in his wing he holds across
[48:16] the feathers like that and the old
[48:17] mother lifts her wings like that and
[48:19] flies off of the rock so she's taking
[48:21] them out of the nest on their first solo
[48:23] flight
[48:24] he says here she goes sailing up up up
[48:26] up until she gets way up into the blue
[48:28] way high them little fellows had never
[48:31] been there before oh they're just having
[48:33] them a wonderful time
[48:35] and then the holy spirit catches you
[48:37] into this amazing experience in your
[48:39] personal life in church wherever it
[48:40] might be and he lifts you up high
[48:44] but i want you to catch what happens
[48:46] now the first thing you know
[48:48] you know what she does in the middle of
[48:49] their wonderful experience
[48:52] she turns right over and shakes them off
[48:54] every one
[48:57] they're eagles they ought to know how to
[48:59] fly you're a believer you ought to know
[49:01] how to believe
[49:03] that's what he's saying amen
[49:05] they ought to know how to fly that's
[49:06] exactly right she shakes them right off
[49:08] to their self
[49:10] now you're not latched on to me now
[49:12] you're not flying by my power but you've
[49:14] got to learn to use the same power that
[49:16] i have to do what i'm doing
[49:18] right she says all right children your
[49:20] eagles fly
[49:21] now as long as you say well i belong to
[49:23] this church i tell you i don't know
[49:24] about that you'll never fly uh-uh uh-uh
[49:27] all right you need to get shook off one
[49:29] time up in the air
[49:32] then little eagles begin to fly
[49:35] now i want you to catch what this flight
[49:37] looks like she'll holler flop your wings
[49:39] children just keep flopping your little
[49:41] faith up and down you're high enough now
[49:44] that you won't hit the earth
[49:46] takes them way high up he doesn't just
[49:48] take her she doesn't just take them to
[49:50] the top of a tree she takes them fifteen
[49:52] hundred feet up in the air two thousand
[49:53] feet up in the air and she says flop and
[49:55] fly it won't matter what happens because
[49:57] you're not going to hit the earth you
[49:58] got lots of room to fall
[50:00] amen and then what does she does
[50:03] and then what she does she darts out to
[50:05] one side and watches them she just sails
[50:09] around and here they are just exactly
[50:11] like a pentecostal revival just
[50:13] topsy-turvy one over one the other one
[50:16] just a flapping all of them acting
[50:18] they don't care they've got supreme
[50:20] confidence in their mommy that's out
[50:22] there watching them
[50:24] okay
[50:25] then he says that how ought the church
[50:27] ought to do that if one of them the
[50:29] little eagles gets out of balance then
[50:32] she swepts right down with them big
[50:34] wings picks him up and bears him into
[50:37] grace
[50:38] again amen right now that's not baptist
[50:42] teaching that's the bible so it brings
[50:43] him right back up shakes him off again
[50:46] and lets him start a new amen
[50:51] what does he say oh you're an eagle you
[50:53] failed
[50:54] no no no
[50:55] takes them up by grace and says let's do
[50:57] this again
[50:58] and again and again and again until what
[51:00] that eagle learns how to fly them eagles
[51:03] has got confidence in their mothers
[51:04] supreme confidence that that mother will
[51:06] help them bear them up again bear them
[51:09] up on wings of eagles and take them up
[51:11] there and shake them off again let him
[51:14] start again
[51:16] then he quotes a song if i fail or if i
[51:19] fail let me rise and try again oh lord
[51:22] he says go again god will lift you right
[51:24] back up take you up there and shake you
[51:26] off again try to balance yourself and
[51:29] just keep going just keep flopping till
[51:31] you learn how to fly
[51:34] he says oh my so we see the prophet of
[51:36] god he doesn't he doesn't get on us
[51:38] because we don't have everything that we
[51:41] we don't act like an eagle every time we
[51:43] act like an ego but we don't always have
[51:45] the capacity in our learning to do what
[51:48] an eagle has to do is what he's saying
[51:50] but he says it's in you so don't stop
[51:51] trying because one time it didn't work
[51:53] out perfectly your first time it didn't
[51:55] work out perfectly but he says keep
[51:57] going keep going keep going and he's
[51:58] likening it to the faith of the church
[52:01] amen that she's got to learn to fly on
[52:02] what the power of the holy spirit within
[52:04] her to bring her to an expected end amen
[52:07] amen i fee i feel like faith is like
[52:09] this and that's that you're here as a
[52:11] believer and i can't give you faith
[52:13] i can't give it to you and we'll get
[52:15] into that why in the next couple of
[52:16] services amen but what i can do is point
[52:18] you to the source
[52:19] i can inspire what you have within you
[52:21] but i can't give it to you it's
[52:23] something that you have to have yourself
[52:25] amen and it's something that's been in
[52:26] the back of my mind for many months now
[52:28] and i think we're at a crossroads in our
[52:30] lives and i say that universally not
[52:32] this church personally or just not me
[52:34] personally but i think we're at a
[52:35] crossroads in our life in across the
[52:38] world as believers that we have to know
[52:40] who we have believed
[52:41] what we have believed and what effect
[52:43] it's supposed to have in our lives amen
[52:45] it is not just enough and i know i keep
[52:47] saying in service it is not just enough
[52:48] to be identified with this message
[52:50] anymore that was a carrier it was a
[52:52] carrier for life but the life still has
[52:53] to come out of that message amen the
[52:55] life if it stays on the page will kill
[52:57] you because it will condemn you because
[52:58] you can't do it but the holy spirit
[53:00] inside of you is the life of that
[53:01] message amen
[53:03] brother brown says this he says
[53:06] i think it's time if somebody can hit
[53:08] that this doesn't seem to be working
[53:09] here i think it's come to a time that
[53:12] we've got to know how we stand
[53:14] he says how can you do anything unless
[53:16] you've got faith in what you're doing
[53:17] you've got to have faith and that's my
[53:19] purpose of doing this with the church
[53:21] here is to give the believers faith and
[53:23] confidence in what they are standing for
[53:26] because it is the word of god
[53:28] then as long as through the scripture
[53:30] it's sovereignly placed from genesis
[53:32] into revelation back and forth up and
[53:34] down not a way for the devil to move in
[53:36] there then you've got perfect confidence
[53:38] see you know where you're standing
[53:41] now i'm going to say many things in
[53:42] these services because the prophet said
[53:44] them i'm going to say many things
[53:45] because the scripture says them i'm not
[53:47] going to say them because i have all of
[53:48] it okay i want you to understand it i'm
[53:50] looking for more faith i'm looking to
[53:52] grow in faith i'm looking to grow in
[53:54] grace i'm looking to have more the
[53:55] manifestation of the faith of god in my
[53:57] life so i am by no means preaching to
[53:59] you from a position of i have all of
[54:01] this amen this is for me as much if not
[54:03] more for me
[54:05] as it is for you amen i'm expecting more
[54:07] of god amen and this is where it starts
[54:09] is that we look into the word and we say
[54:11] what does god have to say of it amen so
[54:13] we're going to take i think four
[54:14] services on this and this is really just
[54:16] a prep for the course amen i'm not going
[54:18] to get into anything deep i'm not going
[54:19] to get any real teaching but this is
[54:21] more of a preaching to get us in the
[54:22] mindset of what it's going to be like
[54:24] to to be able to to understand faith and
[54:26] to be able to take faith and have it
[54:28] move in our life amen but i want to
[54:30] share a quote that a minister shared
[54:31] with me some time ago and and it really
[54:34] it really struck me when when he when he
[54:36] sent it to me and he says there's
[54:38] another great event that i won't forget
[54:39] to call and that was when david was in
[54:41] his worst of time when he was a fugitive
[54:44] he had already been anointed he know
[54:46] what he was to be he was to be king god
[54:49] said so and yet he was hated he was
[54:51] standing in between two deep great deep
[54:53] fires here is the philistines on one
[54:55] side after him and here was saul on the
[54:57] other side and he was a man without a
[54:59] nation just as a church stands today the
[55:02] true living church of god without a
[55:04] denomination or anything else she stands
[55:06] alone but yet she's had the anointing
[55:08] poured on her she knows what she is you
[55:11] know you're an eagle this morning
[55:12] because you've heard the eagle voice and
[55:14] responded to something that was inside
[55:16] of you amen but let's see where this
[55:18] goes he says how in the world can it
[55:20] ever come to pass the devil on both
[55:22] sides driving at david he says david's
[55:25] annoying to be king but he's caught
[55:26] between two pinschers and they're trying
[55:28] to snuff his life out he had taken
[55:30] refuge in strongholds in the wilderness
[55:32] and in caves trying to hide out with a
[55:34] little band of faithful warriors just a
[55:37] few believing like him but those men
[55:39] believe god that that would be the king
[55:42] so is the believers today who is hid out
[55:44] from place to place but yet they know
[55:46] who was coming to be king
[55:49] i don't care who's going to be president
[55:52] i know he's coming
[55:54] and looks further away than it ever did
[55:56] when science is trying to overrule and
[55:58] saying they can build a man they can do
[55:59] this they can take a rabbit and take the
[56:01] pollen take another rabbit and so forth
[56:03] trying to disprove god's word he's
[56:04] saying that man is coming to the point
[56:06] where he can create
[56:08] can't create but he can manipulate the
[56:09] creation to make it look like he's
[56:11] creating
[56:12] he says they're trying to disprove god's
[56:14] word yet there is a people who believe
[56:16] god who stands just as pat as they ever
[56:19] did no matter what comes or goes they
[56:21] still believe god god is right they hold
[56:25] to god's unchanging hands in the midst
[56:27] of the battle in the midst of tears in
[56:29] the midst of sickness and death and
[56:31] everything they still hold to god's
[56:33] unchanging hand they know that he is
[56:36] coming king
[56:38] people today laugh at them and make fun
[56:40] of them and call their holy rollers call
[56:42] them everything they want to but then
[56:44] warriors of god stands faithful at the
[56:46] post of duty might call them a healing
[56:49] group you might call them a bunch of
[56:51] fanatics or whatever you wish to they
[56:53] hang to that king they know he is coming
[56:57] in power
[56:58] though they take his name in vain and
[57:00] scoff and make fun call the people who
[57:02] believe him outcast a bunch of backwash
[57:04] that doesn't bother them a bit they stay
[57:07] true at the post of duty
[57:10] those warriors who was with david stay
[57:12] right by his side if a philistine come
[57:14] up he had to fight whoever it was they
[57:17] were picked on every side poor david in
[57:19] his mind all confused and he thought how
[57:22] can it be lord
[57:25] okay look into your life and say how can
[57:27] it be lord you've anointed me to be
[57:30] something and yet all i face is trouble
[57:32] and trials and battles day in and day
[57:35] out
[57:37] he says you know
[57:39] leaders sometimes go through things that
[57:41] the congregation don't know they're
[57:42] going through when you think of promises
[57:45] god has made then why don't it come to
[57:47] pass
[57:48] they don't tell their congregation they
[57:50] don't tell the people they associate
[57:51] with but there's many flusterations in
[57:53] the heart of a real leader now the man
[57:55] that shared it with me shared it as a
[57:57] minister to a minister
[57:59] but look at this as a father
[58:01] amen look at this as a husband and
[58:03] you're looking and you're praying and
[58:04] you're seeking the will of god and the
[58:06] leadership of god and the provision of
[58:08] god and yet you're sitting there and all
[58:10] you're getting is battles and trials and
[58:12] battles and trials rather than the
[58:13] promise
[58:14] and he says you're sitting there and
[58:15] you're you're wondering why isn't coming
[58:17] to pass
[58:19] he says there's many frustrations amen i
[58:22] can speak there have been many
[58:23] frustrations there are still
[58:24] frustrations when the promise is there
[58:26] i'm walking according to the promise and
[58:28] yet there's no manifestation
[58:30] it can get frustrating at times
[58:33] he says david was sitting here there his
[58:36] throat burning it was in the middle of
[58:37] the summer the philistines was taking
[58:39] advantage of that split between david
[58:41] and saul and saul looking for david
[58:43] everywhere the philistines also and the
[58:44] philistines looking for the israelites
[58:46] talk about a time of confusion just
[58:48] about like it is now
[58:50] david had taken refuge in this little
[58:52] place in this little shelter everywhere
[58:54] he could get to the little strongholds
[58:56] that he could hold into he's just going
[58:57] from place to place
[58:59] place to place i'll hide out here for a
[59:01] while
[59:02] i'll take this scripture and i'll hide
[59:03] under that for a while then i'll go to
[59:05] the next one and i'll go the next one
[59:06] i'll go the next one lord i believe lord
[59:07] i believe lord i believe and you're just
[59:09] moving and you're just one step ahead of
[59:10] death every day
[59:13] he says then he got up on the mountain
[59:15] in that hot middle of the summer when
[59:17] the heat was tremendous
[59:18] his throat parching and the frustrations
[59:20] and fears in his hearts and wondering oh
[59:22] god how could it be you poured that oil
[59:25] upon me not because i chose myself but
[59:28] you chose me
[59:30] why did you call me from hurting the
[59:32] sheep out yonder and told me you give me
[59:34] this to serve your people and now you've
[59:36] got me between the fires everywhere he's
[59:38] saying what did i do to deserve this i
[59:40] didn't ask for this
[59:42] but you anointed me you chose me and you
[59:45] told me to serve your people and now i'm
[59:47] out here hiding out fighting for my life
[59:49] day in and day out
[59:51] what's this all about lord amen
[59:53] it's like i said last service there are
[59:54] times and i think we're in them to stay
[59:56] where we seem to be moving from trial to
[59:58] trial very quickly and there's not a lot
[1:00:00] of rest in between
[1:00:01] amen or the battle is just that long
[1:00:03] that it seems interminable
[1:00:05] and you're just going and going and
[1:00:06] going and every day you get up and
[1:00:09] you're facing a battle and you're facing
[1:00:11] a battle and you're facing a battle amen
[1:00:13] amen there's a lot going on because why
[1:00:15] we're at the end of the gentile age and
[1:00:17] god is wrapping things up and satan is
[1:00:19] unwrapping amen so the satanic power is
[1:00:22] dropping down into the earth in a way
[1:00:23] that it's never been felt before and god
[1:00:25] is wrapping up his power so it seems
[1:00:27] like the battle is stacked against us
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] but in the midst of all of this
[1:00:32] we still have psalm 23.
[1:00:36] amen david said the lord is my shepherd
[1:00:39] i shall not
[1:00:40] want in the caves in the desert heat
[1:00:43] with his his throat parched without
[1:00:45] water
[1:00:46] battle score battle scarred
[1:00:49] weary warn
[1:00:50] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:00:53] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:00:55] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[1:00:57] waters he restoreth my soul you know
[1:01:01] what restoration says it implies that we
[1:01:03] can get depleted worn out needy amen
[1:01:06] that we require something to be put back
[1:01:09] in that used to be there amen we need a
[1:01:11] refilling of the holy spirit like they
[1:01:13] did in acts 3
[1:01:15] right we need our soul restored
[1:01:18] we need god to come back again i was
[1:01:20] listening to brother branham and he said
[1:01:21] that's what we need he said we need a
[1:01:23] refilling of the holy spirit why to
[1:01:25] prepare us to keep the battle going amen
[1:01:28] to give us strength he leadeth me in the
[1:01:30] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:01:32] sake yea though i walk through the
[1:01:34] valley of the shadow of death i will
[1:01:36] fear no evil you've got to walk through
[1:01:38] the valley of the shadow of death so
[1:01:39] that you can experi you can experience
[1:01:41] the lack of fear amen
[1:01:44] thou anoi sorry thou for thou art with
[1:01:46] me thy rod and thy staff come for me
[1:01:48] thou preparest the table before me in
[1:01:50] the presence of mine enemies thou
[1:01:52] anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:01:54] runneth over amen
[1:01:56] in the caves in the battle my cup runeth
[1:01:59] over
[1:02:00] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:02:02] me all the days of my life and i will
[1:02:04] dwell in the house of the lord forever
[1:02:07] that looks a lot like caves
[1:02:10] and of the chosen few many times it's
[1:02:13] not big crowds it's not big flashy
[1:02:15] things it's not a lot of publicity it's
[1:02:17] not a not a lot of greatness it looks a
[1:02:19] lot like work
[1:02:21] amen the glory of god in you looks a lot
[1:02:22] like a work day
[1:02:24] doesn't it because the battle is real
[1:02:26] what do they say today the struggle is
[1:02:28] real
[1:02:29] the struggle is real amen believers
[1:02:32] ought to be able to say the struggle is
[1:02:34] real amen so many times our recognition
[1:02:37] needs to be not why am i in this trial
[1:02:39] or why are my finances struggling or or
[1:02:41] what's going on in my marriage or why am
[1:02:43] i constantly dealing with an issue but
[1:02:45] we want to stop and ask ourselves why am
[1:02:47] i facing these challenges in the first
[1:02:49] place
[1:02:51] and we've got to look at the big picture
[1:02:52] rather than at the situation because if
[1:02:54] you can catch the big picture it'll take
[1:02:56] you through the situation you're in amen
[1:02:58] i believe when you ask yourself that
[1:03:00] correctly what do you remember i am a
[1:03:02] child of god
[1:03:03] those that come to me must be tried they
[1:03:05] must be tested and if they're not they
[1:03:07] are no longer his children they never
[1:03:09] were his children amen they've got to
[1:03:10] come through those trials and
[1:03:11] tribulations amen in order to be an
[1:03:14] overcomer there must be something to
[1:03:16] overcome in front of me amen i can't be
[1:03:18] an overcomer without a trial this is not
[1:03:20] meant to be a life of ease amen when you
[1:03:22] look in revelation 12 where it says that
[1:03:24] they overcame by two things it says they
[1:03:26] overcame by the blood of the lamb that's
[1:03:28] what he did for us
[1:03:30] and then it says they overcame by the
[1:03:32] word of their testimony and that's what
[1:03:33] he did through us
[1:03:36] okay so if you look at that and you you
[1:03:38] see very quickly that of those two
[1:03:40] things none of those have anything to do
[1:03:42] with your power strength might intellect
[1:03:44] education whatever it might be because
[1:03:46] the blood of the lamb that gives you
[1:03:48] power amen is his work at calvary and
[1:03:51] the testimony if you ever have a real
[1:03:52] testimony you know i had absolutely
[1:03:54] nothing to do with
[1:03:56] amen nothing to do with it it's like
[1:03:58] brother branham what he talks about you
[1:04:00] know when he was he was there and he was
[1:04:01] baptizing the angel came down he says i
[1:04:03] just happened to be there right because
[1:04:05] it had nothing to do with him as a
[1:04:07] person it was the power of god moving in
[1:04:09] him that's what a testimony is for you
[1:04:10] is the overcoming power of god working
[1:04:12] through you to overcome the situation in
[1:04:15] your life amen and the first thing he's
[1:04:17] overcoming is you
[1:04:18] and then he moves to overcome your life
[1:04:20] i was talking with brother weissel and i
[1:04:21] said sometimes i feel like we're praying
[1:04:23] the things out of our life that are
[1:04:25] supposed to give us the very thing we're
[1:04:26] asking for
[1:04:28] amen what are we trying to do we're
[1:04:30] we're we're bucking the trend of trying
[1:04:31] him trying to develop our character so
[1:04:33] that we can take the trial away and he's
[1:04:34] saying no no no you've character means
[1:04:36] there's a melting pot there's a beating
[1:04:37] process goes on there and we're trying
[1:04:39] to get that out of you and the only way
[1:04:41] it comes out is if you go through a
[1:04:42] trial or a tribulation amen
[1:04:45] amen the blood was his and the power to
[1:04:46] give you a testimony by the holy spirit
[1:04:48] is also his listen to this quote brother
[1:04:50] brown says but the works of jesus christ
[1:04:53] is done by the holy ghost when he comes
[1:04:56] to anoint the people
[1:04:58] so you can't do the works of christ
[1:05:00] unless you're anointed by the holy
[1:05:01] spirit to do that work
[1:05:03] not just anointed by the holy spirit but
[1:05:05] to do that work we'll get into that in a
[1:05:07] moment do you believe that certainly we
[1:05:09] believe it what would keep us from
[1:05:10] believing because god made the promise
[1:05:13] god said so when that settles it now man
[1:05:15] cannot do that it's supernatural it's
[1:05:18] something that man can't do
[1:05:20] so stop trying to do it we'll get to a
[1:05:22] quote where brother braham says stop
[1:05:23] trying to do it and just do it
[1:05:26] it's something that man can't do he says
[1:05:28] now while i've got just a couple minutes
[1:05:30] time i want to explain that see man
[1:05:31] can't do nothing it's god in man jesus
[1:05:34] said i'm the vine you are the branch now
[1:05:36] as long as a branch is in the vine it'll
[1:05:38] bear the fruit of the vine now god has
[1:05:41] always used men for his agent that's why
[1:05:43] he used his own son to unveil himself he
[1:05:46] came down and took the form of a man in
[1:05:48] order to die the death for men he could
[1:05:50] not die in the spirit but he was put to
[1:05:52] death in the flesh
[1:05:53] he says then god was in abraham god was
[1:05:56] in isaac god was in jacob god was in
[1:05:58] joseph god was in david he was in all
[1:06:01] those people back there then prophets
[1:06:02] and so forth it was god working through
[1:06:05] men now in this new testament age the
[1:06:08] blood of jesus christ cleanses his
[1:06:10] church and sanctifies it that his holy
[1:06:12] spirit might continue the work of god on
[1:06:15] through all the ages and he's just the
[1:06:17] same today
[1:06:19] if it isn't then then we're false
[1:06:21] witnesses of this bible
[1:06:23] if that isn't true then the bible isn't
[1:06:25] true it's time that men preach the
[1:06:27] gospel it's time that the power of god
[1:06:29] was made known when heathens try to step
[1:06:32] on the word we need men like the hebrew
[1:06:34] children our god is able to deliver us
[1:06:37] from this that's right it's time god
[1:06:40] remains the same
[1:06:41] now i want you to go back to that first
[1:06:43] statement that we do the works of jesus
[1:06:45] christ when we are the when we are
[1:06:47] anointed by the holy spirit to do it
[1:06:50] we aren't all anointed to do everything
[1:06:53] okay that's easy to prove there's a five
[1:06:55] full ministry and every
[1:06:57] genuine member of the five full ministry
[1:06:59] has the holy ghost and is a man
[1:07:02] okay he's a man and he's got the holy
[1:07:04] ghost you have to be that to be a member
[1:07:06] of the five full ministry but guess what
[1:07:08] to be a member of the bride of christ a
[1:07:10] man also has to have the holy ghost
[1:07:12] okay so you have a lot of men that are
[1:07:14] in the bride of christ anointed with the
[1:07:16] holy ghost but just because they're
[1:07:17] annoying with the holy ghost doesn't
[1:07:18] mean they're anointed to preach the
[1:07:20] gospel
[1:07:21] okay they have the anointing of the holy
[1:07:22] ghost but they're only anointed to do
[1:07:24] certain things and it's only those that
[1:07:26] are ordained to preach that are allowed
[1:07:27] to preach
[1:07:28] right so it's the same thing in your
[1:07:30] life don't go around saying i should be
[1:07:32] doing this and i should be doing that
[1:07:34] and i no no no he says as you're
[1:07:37] anointed to do it you do it
[1:07:39] so don't put pressure on yourself to do
[1:07:41] it but seek the anointing
[1:07:44] to meet the need
[1:07:45] amen if you have need of something if
[1:07:47] there's a situation there then you say
[1:07:48] lord i'm available i'm available if you
[1:07:51] want to use me but if you want to use
[1:07:52] brother david instead then go ahead and
[1:07:54] do it and then if you want to use sister
[1:07:56] brenda go ahead and do if you want to
[1:07:57] use sister lily go ahead and do it if
[1:07:59] you want to use brother jeremiah back
[1:08:00] there go and do it lord i'm a willing
[1:08:02] vessel but anoint the one that you want
[1:08:04] to do this work
[1:08:05] right we can't do it all and we're not
[1:08:07] expected to do it all so don't put
[1:08:08] pressure on yourself to do it all amen
[1:08:11] what is it that what as god inspires
[1:08:13] them according to the word or let me put
[1:08:15] it this way not contrary to the word
[1:08:19] then god can use a man or woman to do
[1:08:21] the very works of god
[1:08:23] now i'll speak from my own experience
[1:08:25] and the key for myself is to recognize
[1:08:27] what i am called to do
[1:08:28] to be committed with that to that and to
[1:08:30] be satisfied with that
[1:08:32] okay that's what i have to learn to do
[1:08:34] is to stay with what god has put me into
[1:08:36] and not try and branch into anything
[1:08:38] else and put it all on my heart all of
[1:08:40] my soul all of my strength into that
[1:08:42] area okay so if god has given you a gift
[1:08:45] and he's called you to use that gift
[1:08:47] then that's where you put your strength
[1:08:48] in your might amen but i don't go around
[1:08:50] seeking a bunch of other different
[1:08:51] things either
[1:08:52] you know it's like when we needed a new
[1:08:53] deacon and i said brothers i'm willing
[1:08:55] to stand in as a deacon but i don't
[1:08:56] believe that's what i'm called to do my
[1:08:58] calling is to preach the word so let me
[1:09:00] preach the word that's the best thing to
[1:09:01] do amen so whatever it might be in your
[1:09:04] life whether you're you're you're a
[1:09:06] leader in worship you know whether it's
[1:09:07] in singing specials whether it's in
[1:09:09] teaching the sunday school whether it's
[1:09:10] in hosting whatever it might be put all
[1:09:13] your soul and strength into that be
[1:09:15] anointed for that because that's what
[1:09:16] god calls you to do and don't try and
[1:09:17] strain yourself to do a bunch of other
[1:09:19] things fit into your portion of the body
[1:09:21] and stay there and we'll be a
[1:09:23] just a a wonderful tremendous body of
[1:09:25] christ amen amen and then when i'm in
[1:09:28] there i don't have to stretch myself
[1:09:30] because guess what god's gonna stretch
[1:09:31] me
[1:09:32] god's gonna pull me god's gonna make me
[1:09:34] grow to match the task that's in front
[1:09:36] of me amen and then i don't have to
[1:09:38] worry well am i anointed for this is
[1:09:39] this my place or is this my no no
[1:09:41] because he's anointed me to do it then i
[1:09:43] just step into it and he just starts
[1:09:45] growing me in it my confidence is high
[1:09:47] because i know that i'm sure that he
[1:09:49] called me to do that very thing amen
[1:09:51] amen the beautiful thing is that when
[1:09:53] you know you're in your place you don't
[1:09:54] have to pretend
[1:09:56] right because what happens when you're
[1:09:58] pretending is you're trying to prove
[1:09:59] yourself that's what pretenses is you're
[1:10:01] trying to prove it and it's not up to me
[1:10:03] to prove it it's up to me to believe it
[1:10:05] and it's up to him to prove it and then
[1:10:07] if i'm in the position he's placed me
[1:10:08] and if i'm doing what he's asked me to
[1:10:10] do then it's up to him to prove his word
[1:10:12] and all i'm doing is believing it that's
[1:10:13] how we prove his word is we believe it
[1:10:15] but i'm not going out there to try and
[1:10:17] prove myself to anybody nor should you
[1:10:19] to anybody else amen what you do is
[1:10:21] stand in your position believe the word
[1:10:24] act on the word of god and it's up to
[1:10:25] him to come behind and prove himself
[1:10:26] through it amen
[1:10:28] brother brown says this and i've read
[1:10:29] this many times he says i'm going to say
[1:10:31] something national force put israel in
[1:10:33] her homeland national force will put the
[1:10:35] church in the world council of churches
[1:10:37] but the power of god will put the people
[1:10:40] in the bride the world forces this way
[1:10:42] and the world forces that way but god
[1:10:44] forces upward
[1:10:46] notice how i said that
[1:10:47] this way and that way left and right
[1:10:50] what are you either the you're on the
[1:10:51] left or you're on the right today aren't
[1:10:52] you
[1:10:53] if you're focused on that then what is
[1:10:55] it it's the spirit of the world he says
[1:10:58] the spirit of god pushes us up
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:01] he says the spirit of god which is the
[1:11:03] word of god my spirit my word is spirit
[1:11:05] and life will put the bride in her place
[1:11:08] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:11:10] the word then she's in christ and it
[1:11:12] will put her in her place no national
[1:11:14] force will do it but the national force
[1:11:16] did drive israel to the homeland the
[1:11:18] national forces of the council churches
[1:11:20] will drive every organization into it
[1:11:22] but the power of god will raise the
[1:11:24] bride into glory and out of it out of
[1:11:27] everything amen
[1:11:29] you can't force yourself into the
[1:11:31] rapture
[1:11:32] amen you can't make yourself an
[1:11:33] overcomer because if you can then
[1:11:34] anybody can
[1:11:36] right but that what that would eliminate
[1:11:38] the need for the holy spirit that would
[1:11:39] eliminate the need for a new birth that
[1:11:41] would eliminate the need for god to
[1:11:42] actually change your life if you can
[1:11:44] make it happen then we don't need god
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:48] but what is it it's a work of god from
[1:11:50] start to finish and it starts with grace
[1:11:52] by grace through faith and that faith is
[1:11:53] not of yourself it's a gift of god and
[1:11:55] from there everything and we'll get into
[1:11:57] this later but everything that you do by
[1:11:59] faith is based on the very fact that he
[1:12:01] called you in the first place we'll
[1:12:02] bring it back to that is if he called me
[1:12:04] and he chose me then that means he'll
[1:12:06] carry me through the rest of the way
[1:12:07] amen but we have to realize what time
[1:12:10] we're in what place we're in and our
[1:12:11] position and purpose within that time
[1:12:13] and if we can believe that we're in a
[1:12:14] scriptural time and tied to the
[1:12:16] scriptures then that allows us to look
[1:12:18] with expectation for what is to come
[1:12:21] and not to put it all into the future
[1:12:22] but put it into the present day man i
[1:12:24] was studying something else and i ran
[1:12:26] into this next quote and it jumped out
[1:12:27] and i copied it into another file and i
[1:12:29] said i'm gonna i know i'm gonna preach
[1:12:31] on that and here we are today amen but
[1:12:33] it's the prophet of god and he's
[1:12:34] speaking about the woman at the will
[1:12:36] at the well he says now look quickly
[1:12:38] that predestinated seed laying there
[1:12:40] glory my what could not have been
[1:12:42] anything else that predestinated seed
[1:12:44] and when that water began to fall on
[1:12:46] that seed it started blooming you didn't
[1:12:49] have to tell her she knew
[1:12:52] she said sir i perceive that you're a
[1:12:53] prophet we know the messiah is coming
[1:12:55] we're looking for him when he comes he
[1:12:57] will tell us these kinds of things he
[1:12:59] said i'm he she said that's good enough
[1:13:02] for me no presuming she didn't come in
[1:13:04] and say say you doctors of divinity i
[1:13:06] would like to take you all in a
[1:13:07] scriptural argument
[1:13:09] she said i'm presuming nothing come see
[1:13:12] a man that's told me the things i've
[1:13:13] done isn't this the very christ
[1:13:16] i want to stop there because i want you
[1:13:18] to catch one thing the predestinated
[1:13:20] seed of god in you will always come to
[1:13:22] life under the preaching of the word for
[1:13:25] your day
[1:13:27] now it may not start immediately as i
[1:13:28] said in the last service i said under
[1:13:30] the preaching of the word for this hour
[1:13:32] for 17 years before it started to truly
[1:13:35] blossom but i fought it for six years
[1:13:37] before i gave my life to the christ but
[1:13:39] for those first 11 years there was
[1:13:41] nothing there
[1:13:42] but as soon as it's your time then it
[1:13:44] starts to blossom and it never dies
[1:13:46] after that it cannot die once it starts
[1:13:48] because it's the life of god inside of
[1:13:50] you it is a turtle that cannot die amen
[1:13:52] and i want you to catch there that for
[1:13:54] every seed there is a time
[1:13:56] and it has nothing to do with how you
[1:13:58] look has nothing to do with how you act
[1:14:00] where you're at in life whether you know
[1:14:01] god whether you don't know god look at
[1:14:03] the samaritan woman
[1:14:05] she's essentially a prostitute that's
[1:14:06] what the prophet calls her she's married
[1:14:08] and divorced five times she's living
[1:14:10] common law
[1:14:12] okay this is a woman that has a poor
[1:14:14] reputation she's unclean she's not
[1:14:15] allowed to mingle with the rest of them
[1:14:17] we would say she was an unspiritual
[1:14:19] woman wouldn't we
[1:14:21] there was nothing looking at her at her
[1:14:23] life that would say that's the seed of
[1:14:24] god
[1:14:25] amen but yet
[1:14:27] she said
[1:14:28] we know that when messiah comes he'll do
[1:14:31] these things
[1:14:32] there was an expectation there was an
[1:14:34] understanding inside of her that was
[1:14:36] still looking for the messiah even in
[1:14:38] her fallen condition
[1:14:39] and so when it comes in front of her
[1:14:42] she's got the expectation to recognize
[1:14:44] it
[1:14:45] right she wasn't saying they're
[1:14:46] bemoaning her current condition
[1:14:48] bemoaning her fate that she had to go
[1:14:49] get water in the middle of the day when
[1:14:51] it was hot and now i got this guy
[1:14:53] talking to me and he's a little bit
[1:14:54] weird and it's weird to have a guy
[1:14:55] sitting there while i'm trying to do my
[1:14:56] work why can't he just leave me alone
[1:14:58] and now he's digging into my personal
[1:15:00] life
[1:15:01] is he trying to pick me up i don't know
[1:15:03] right but as she's jumping as she's
[1:15:06] there and she starts to converse with
[1:15:08] him and he starts to talk to her
[1:15:10] something in her clicks right
[1:15:14] and something in her says hey
[1:15:17] that sounds like something i've read
[1:15:18] before
[1:15:20] when abraham talked to elohim
[1:15:23] this very thing happened like this man's
[1:15:25] talking to me amen
[1:15:27] and what did she say that's the nature
[1:15:29] of god right there
[1:15:31] that's the nature of elohim the lord
[1:15:34] what a thing it would be if we had
[1:15:36] expectation that out of every situation
[1:15:38] out of every trial out of every door out
[1:15:40] of every window out of every bush we'd
[1:15:41] drive by then god would come out of
[1:15:44] there and step into the scene amen that
[1:15:45] there be an expectation of the promise
[1:15:47] of god coming into our situation amen
[1:15:49] that even as we're doing something as
[1:15:51] mundane as going about our daily work
[1:15:54] that god would jump out of that and into
[1:15:56] our lives and touch us in a way that we
[1:15:57] needed to touch amen
[1:16:00] what is it she's sitting there
[1:16:03] and she's understanding this is
[1:16:04] different this ain't just a man talking
[1:16:06] to me
[1:16:07] he says now she didn't have to presume
[1:16:09] to venture out without authority
[1:16:12] she had authority he says she had
[1:16:15] scriptural authority to believe it oh
[1:16:18] woman you don't know you don't belong to
[1:16:19] our school you don't belong to any of
[1:16:21] these organizations she said i don't
[1:16:23] care what you say i know what thus saith
[1:16:25] the lord is they said he will be a
[1:16:27] prophet and there he is amen she had
[1:16:30] scriptural authority she didn't presume
[1:16:32] what school did this come from it came
[1:16:34] from the bible that's right
[1:16:36] like peter on the day of pentecost she's
[1:16:38] had an experience and she's saying
[1:16:40] inside she said hey i believe we're in
[1:16:42] the time of the messiah i believe that
[1:16:44] the time is right but i look around
[1:16:46] we're under the foot of the romans we
[1:16:47] need deliverance we need this we need
[1:16:49] that and we've been without a prophet so
[1:16:51] long the timing is right and all of a
[1:16:52] sudden this man's talking to her but
[1:16:54] she's not looking at the man but she's
[1:16:56] now listening to his words
[1:16:59] when it started she was looking at him
[1:17:00] but the more he speaks she's thinking
[1:17:02] this is just like abraham at the time of
[1:17:04] his possession
[1:17:06] right this is the kind of situation he
[1:17:08] was in he was talking to a man as well
[1:17:11] and that man told him things that he
[1:17:12] wasn't supposed to know amen she wasn't
[1:17:15] looking at the vessel because the vessel
[1:17:16] always fools the people the vessel
[1:17:18] always fools the people and whether it's
[1:17:20] whether it's john the baptist with his
[1:17:22] clothes and his looks in his manner that
[1:17:24] was wrong whether it was jesus with his
[1:17:26] unassuming attitude and his quiet voice
[1:17:28] and he wasn't good looking or
[1:17:29] charismatic or any of these things or
[1:17:30] whether it's brother jail behind this
[1:17:32] pulpit or me the vessel is always going
[1:17:33] to fool you it's always going to fool
[1:17:35] you if you're looking at the vessel amen
[1:17:37] but what she was looking for in
[1:17:39] experience and when her experience
[1:17:42] matched the word experience then she
[1:17:44] said this is it
[1:17:46] and that's all she was looking for was
[1:17:47] the experience she didn't care how it
[1:17:49] came just that it came amen
[1:17:51] no matter how it looked no matter the
[1:17:52] packaging no matter the lack of visual
[1:17:54] appear she said this is it because it
[1:17:57] matches the word
[1:17:58] brother brown says that's where she had
[1:18:00] authority to believe amen so the key for
[1:18:04] any believer man or woman is to be able
[1:18:06] to say where they're at and the place in
[1:18:08] time we're at matches the word
[1:18:10] we ought to know we're at the end time
[1:18:13] listen we could go tomorrow morning
[1:18:18] i want to say that again we could go
[1:18:20] tomorrow morning
[1:18:23] are we looking for it amen because
[1:18:25] that's the time we're at brother branham
[1:18:27] said i see nothing else except the going
[1:18:30] away of the church
[1:18:32] that's it
[1:18:34] and that's 65 it's done
[1:18:37] he's gone
[1:18:38] how much closer are we today it could be
[1:18:41] tomorrow amen
[1:18:43] if you notice like i said we see satan
[1:18:45] we see the ability for satanic influence
[1:18:47] to just come in and just roll over
[1:18:48] things now it doesn't take 10 or 15 or
[1:18:50] 20 years to introduce an agenda now
[1:18:52] takes two right it's just going off the
[1:18:55] rails
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:57] so what does that tell you about the
[1:18:58] bride of christ if satan is accelerating
[1:19:00] his work then what is god doing god's
[1:19:02] got to accelerate his work to stand up
[1:19:04] against it amen
[1:19:06] amen but god's got to allow it
[1:19:09] satan can't move unless god allows him
[1:19:11] he's bound he's bound unless god allows
[1:19:12] it so as he's accelerating it's because
[1:19:14] god's pushing down on the faith
[1:19:15] accelerate god's pressing down on the
[1:19:17] word accelerator and he's bringing the
[1:19:18] people up to speed to match that
[1:19:20] standard amen
[1:19:22] so my question to you is if you
[1:19:23] recognize it's the end time then what do
[1:19:25] you what i want you to be an expectation
[1:19:27] for
[1:19:28] exactly what you to be looking for we
[1:19:30] ought to be looking for a couple
[1:19:32] different things the last seed
[1:19:34] the last seed amen and i'll take us back
[1:19:36] to acts 2 38 and it's for you and what
[1:19:40] as many as the lord your god shall call
[1:19:42] that's what we're looking for it's the
[1:19:43] last ones to come in and i've heard it
[1:19:45] time and time again in many other
[1:19:47] churches where they just have people
[1:19:48] come coming out of nothing
[1:19:50] one day they're a ranked center and
[1:19:52] maybe they know about the message maybe
[1:19:53] they don't and then the next day it's
[1:19:55] just boom something got them up and
[1:19:56] moved them into the church and they're
[1:19:58] back and they're serving god faithfully
[1:20:00] what is it it's that quickening power
[1:20:02] that quickening spirits coming in and
[1:20:03] saying you got to get in and god will
[1:20:05] not allow you to stay out of it amen
[1:20:07] remember that's that quote we read a
[1:20:08] couple of services ago where brother
[1:20:09] brahm said talked about the enemy coming
[1:20:11] in like a flood he says but now when we
[1:20:14] need it
[1:20:15] the spirit of god raises a standard what
[1:20:17] is it he is pouring in the spirit i want
[1:20:21] you to catch this thought now because
[1:20:22] it'll help you when things get tough
[1:20:24] when things get difficult and you're
[1:20:25] saying i can't do this anymore
[1:20:27] right and you're struggling to keep your
[1:20:29] head of above water what are you to be
[1:20:31] asking god to do
[1:20:32] not take the situation away
[1:20:35] pour in more of your spirit
[1:20:37] pour in more of your spirit lord fill me
[1:20:39] again fill me up shake it down let it
[1:20:42] overflow when i use it up fill it up
[1:20:44] again and fill it up again and fill it
[1:20:46] up again and fill it up again amen
[1:20:48] brother brown puts it this way he says
[1:20:50] he was deity himself made flesh here on
[1:20:52] earth to manifest his love to the people
[1:20:54] and to take away sin on the earth he
[1:20:56] came here in order that he could anchor
[1:20:58] death in his own body he could anchor
[1:21:00] sickness in his own body the curse that
[1:21:02] ought to have been on you he took it
[1:21:03] upon himself and had to die as a man in
[1:21:05] order to redeem you back to this full
[1:21:08] fellowship with the father again what a
[1:21:10] marvelous thing
[1:21:12] he says our hearts can't conceive what a
[1:21:14] thing that was what he did but we're too
[1:21:17] slow our minds are sluggish the valves
[1:21:20] have been stopped up they've been
[1:21:22] paralyzed by unbelief and fear and doubt
[1:21:26] and it can't flow free like it should do
[1:21:28] unless we let the holy spirit so
[1:21:32] dominate our lives till it pushes those
[1:21:35] vows till life begins to start to
[1:21:37] operate
[1:21:38] see
[1:21:39] then we can see then he says when what
[1:21:41] the holy spirit has cleaned it out and
[1:21:43] it's now operating then we can see
[1:21:46] sure it's the father then unconsciously
[1:21:50] your faith is there he's saying you've
[1:21:52] got faith you don't even know about
[1:21:54] and we'll get into why that is in the
[1:21:56] next service lord willing amen there's a
[1:21:58] lot more to that quote but i want to
[1:21:59] start with one thing and that's that if
[1:22:00] you could you can only have the fullness
[1:22:03] of faith if we call it that if you're
[1:22:05] letting the holy spirit have free reign
[1:22:07] in your life amen the prophet of god
[1:22:09] says that the holy spirit dominates your
[1:22:11] life
[1:22:12] dominates
[1:22:14] the question is what dominates our life
[1:22:16] then today
[1:22:17] how do you know what dominates your life
[1:22:20] what dominates your time
[1:22:22] very simple what dominates your time
[1:22:24] we've got certain responsibilities and
[1:22:26] guess what as men and certainly some of
[1:22:28] the women we don't get to shirk going to
[1:22:30] work that day
[1:22:31] so that's not what dominates our time
[1:22:33] that's a requirement right but what
[1:22:35] happens when we come home from work or
[1:22:38] how much are we working
[1:22:40] two
[1:22:40] are we working more than we need to
[1:22:43] because that can dominate our life
[1:22:45] or what happens we get so stretched out
[1:22:47] from work then what do we do brothers we
[1:22:48] come home we engage in our hobbies
[1:22:50] instead of doing the work that god told
[1:22:52] us to do as a father and as a husband
[1:22:53] amen that can dominate us it can be our
[1:22:55] passions it can be anything i mean you
[1:22:58] look at the world we covered it last
[1:22:59] time whether it's
[1:23:00] social media whether it's politics
[1:23:02] whether it's
[1:23:03] feminism whether it's
[1:23:04] social justice movements whether it's
[1:23:06] books whether it's movies whether it's
[1:23:08] music all of these things can come in
[1:23:09] and dominate your life
[1:23:11] it'll take you to a place that has
[1:23:12] nothing to do with the kingdom of god
[1:23:14] amen and what is it
[1:23:16] what dominates the scene and what you do
[1:23:17] when you don't have to do something else
[1:23:20] amen look at your free time and i'll
[1:23:21] tell you what's not what's i'd say
[1:23:23] denominating i guess it is kind of
[1:23:25] denominating but what dominates you
[1:23:28] it's a question
[1:23:30] you know you can have the holy ghost and
[1:23:32] you can still be dominated by something
[1:23:33] else for periods of time you can get a
[1:23:35] spirit on you absolutely been there done
[1:23:37] that
[1:23:38] amen why you let something in and you
[1:23:40] let it take over your life and all of a
[1:23:41] sudden you're sitting there and you're
[1:23:43] saying how come i'm overwhelmed
[1:23:45] by overwhelm meaning this is a consuming
[1:23:47] influence in my life
[1:23:49] and it can be as simple as this
[1:23:51] that can be a consuming influence
[1:23:53] whatever you do on it whatever you do on
[1:23:55] it doesn't matter
[1:23:56] right it can be what hobbies
[1:23:59] i love cars i love things with motors i
[1:24:01] could easily get caught up in that
[1:24:03] and then i know i know the brothers down
[1:24:05] south hunting's a big thing they can get
[1:24:07] caught up in hunting every week in their
[1:24:09] way setting up the tree stand and
[1:24:11] baiting and this and that and the other
[1:24:12] thing
[1:24:13] and then sisters you know what you do i
[1:24:14] maybe don't put your own little thing in
[1:24:17] there and say is it dominating me or is
[1:24:19] the holy spirit dominating
[1:24:21] how you know it's a dominating spirit is
[1:24:23] it will don it will overwhelm your life
[1:24:25] with things that have nothing to do with
[1:24:27] the kingdom of god
[1:24:28] and it will not cause you to grow
[1:24:31] at all
[1:24:32] in the word of god amen
[1:24:34] put your own thing there i don't know
[1:24:35] what it is amen
[1:24:37] but what happens when that comes in is
[1:24:39] you end up trying to live in two
[1:24:40] kingdoms at one time
[1:24:42] the scripture says you can't serve two
[1:24:44] masters at the same time so what is it
[1:24:46] is you end up trying to serve the
[1:24:48] colonel man or woman and the spiritual
[1:24:50] man or woman simultaneously and guess
[1:24:52] what it doesn't work and you know what
[1:24:53] happens when you start to go that way
[1:24:56] god will put up a flag
[1:24:57] he'll say whoa whoa leave that alone
[1:25:00] and then if you insist on going what
[1:25:02] happens that dove of the holy spirit
[1:25:03] just goes and sits there and says all
[1:25:04] right we'll let you go for a while let
[1:25:07] you see if you catch it and if not we're
[1:25:08] gonna have to go into what correction
[1:25:11] right amen
[1:25:13] but what's he saying he's going to see
[1:25:14] are you going to catch it are you going
[1:25:15] to see you're off are you going to keep
[1:25:16] pushing it amen you got to pick
[1:25:18] one or the other
[1:25:20] what's the what's the result of that but
[1:25:22] the brad says this jesus said except a
[1:25:23] corner wheat falls in the ground and
[1:25:25] dies it abides alone and the people
[1:25:27] don't want to die you want to be alive
[1:25:30] in the world and still you want to be
[1:25:32] religious
[1:25:33] so you accept an intellectual conception
[1:25:36] of it i wrote in my notes here worldly
[1:25:38] desire plus religious spirit equals
[1:25:40] intellectual gospel
[1:25:42] can i say that again worldly desire plus
[1:25:44] religious spirit equals an intellectual
[1:25:45] gospel and then when you do that you're
[1:25:48] still dead in sin and trespasses
[1:25:50] remember last service i read that quote
[1:25:51] that said the halfway christian is the
[1:25:53] most miserable place to be
[1:25:55] and that's what makes people act and do
[1:25:57] the way they do because the spirit
[1:25:58] that's in them dominates their life say
[1:26:00] well other people do this he says well
[1:26:03] you're not like the other people
[1:26:05] you're not supposed to be like the other
[1:26:07] people and don't pattern yourself after
[1:26:09] another believer pattern yourself after
[1:26:10] the word of god
[1:26:11] man don't look to another believer for
[1:26:13] permission to do something you go pull
[1:26:15] it through the through the sieve of the
[1:26:16] word of god and get your permission from
[1:26:18] that and don't go looking for holes
[1:26:20] go to look to fulfill what it says not
[1:26:22] to go through the holes where it doesn't
[1:26:23] say anything
[1:26:24] he says well other people do this well
[1:26:26] you're not like the other people you are
[1:26:29] dead and your life is hidden god through
[1:26:31] christ and was sealed by the holy spirit
[1:26:33] that's life friends that's what he's
[1:26:35] talking about is a life you are dead and
[1:26:37] something else is living in your place
[1:26:39] it's not just doctrine but it's the
[1:26:40] active life of jesus christ in you
[1:26:42] working to get you tuned up to the word
[1:26:44] of god
[1:26:45] men like a guitar here we sit there and
[1:26:47] they've got a they've got a little tuner
[1:26:48] on the end and they can sit there and if
[1:26:49] it gets out of tune all they do is turn
[1:26:51] that on it brings them right back into
[1:26:52] tune you ought to be tuning by the word
[1:26:54] of god not by what the world says not by
[1:26:56] what your friends say but tune yourself
[1:26:58] up by the word of god amen it's breaking
[1:27:00] down all those things brother brahm
[1:27:01] talked about he says unbelief and fear
[1:27:03] and doubt is breaking all of those
[1:27:04] things else that the life can begin to
[1:27:06] work through us amen
[1:27:07] but there's a cleaning that happens
[1:27:09] first
[1:27:10] amen i believe we've missed it in the
[1:27:11] message that there's still three works
[1:27:13] of grace paul still talked about
[1:27:14] justification and sanctification before
[1:27:16] he ever got to the baptism of the holy
[1:27:17] ghost and he's got to clean your life
[1:27:19] out him and he's got to pull these
[1:27:20] things out so that you can be of service
[1:27:22] and use amen and you don't go from zero
[1:27:25] to a hundred
[1:27:26] like that
[1:27:27] he grows you and he moves you and he
[1:27:29] pushes things out and he fills it in and
[1:27:31] does these different things amen but the
[1:27:32] instantaneous work is when you were
[1:27:34] quickened and then when life came forth
[1:27:36] when that word hit that eternal life of
[1:27:38] god inside of you that seed inside of
[1:27:39] you and it came forth that was the
[1:27:41] instantaneous part everything else after
[1:27:43] that is a function of time amen
[1:27:46] amen repentance means that you've got to
[1:27:48] turn around and go opposite to where
[1:27:49] you're going and that's the first work
[1:27:51] and god builds on that and guess what
[1:27:53] that's the same for a message believer
[1:27:55] as it is for a ranked sinner you aren't
[1:27:57] walking according to the word even if
[1:27:58] you've sat in a message church all your
[1:28:00] life until you get the holy ghost
[1:28:02] because you didn't have the mind of
[1:28:03] christ prior to that so how could you
[1:28:04] properly have the word applied in your
[1:28:06] life as good as you might think you are
[1:28:08] you don't have it until you have the
[1:28:09] holy ghost because that is the mind of
[1:28:10] christ in you and then you've got to do
[1:28:12] what you've got to run that through that
[1:28:14] sieve again as we talked about last last
[1:28:16] service amen
[1:28:17] this is a beautiful quote
[1:28:20] not this one the next one
[1:28:21] but did you ever see a man that has been
[1:28:23] stricken by an evil spirit like that
[1:28:25] he's several times his strength how i
[1:28:27] have noticed them in the meeting when
[1:28:29] groups of police couldn't even hold them
[1:28:31] they would tear them police to pieces
[1:28:32] throw them aside and get out and carry
[1:28:34] on because he is so fully surrendered to
[1:28:37] the evil one it took possession of him
[1:28:40] he had not his own understanding he only
[1:28:42] did what the evil spirit put in him to
[1:28:44] do
[1:28:45] and you'll run up against this in people
[1:28:46] where they're so stuck on something that
[1:28:49] they cannot be moved from it they have
[1:28:51] so much strength to stick with what
[1:28:53] they're convinced of and they don't
[1:28:54] realize it's an evil spirit that's on
[1:28:56] them
[1:28:57] so brother ram says these these men that
[1:28:58] come in and they are women perhaps but
[1:29:00] he says they have a demon on them and it
[1:29:02] gives them strength that is supernatural
[1:29:05] demon strength
[1:29:07] but catch what he says next he says then
[1:29:09] i thought
[1:29:10] with a complete surrender to the devil
[1:29:12] can give a man maybe five times his
[1:29:14] strength what would a complete surrender
[1:29:17] to god do to a man
[1:29:21] five times your strength with a demon
[1:29:22] without the holy spirit to do in our
[1:29:24] lives amen
[1:29:25] i can't do it
[1:29:27] i can't do it as not the word of god
[1:29:29] amen
[1:29:30] what would a complete surrender to god
[1:29:33] do to a man
[1:29:35] amen that's what i'm seeking what would
[1:29:37] it do to a that's weak in body
[1:29:38] and can't walk or something if we could
[1:29:41] just completely yield to the holy ghost
[1:29:43] give us super strength to rise in the
[1:29:45] name because greater is he that's in you
[1:29:47] than he that's in the world see the
[1:29:49] strength in god that's in you is greater
[1:29:52] than any affliction that can come upon
[1:29:54] you there is nothing can overtake you
[1:29:57] that can supersede you because you are
[1:30:00] full of superpower
[1:30:02] and that superpower is the holy spirit
[1:30:05] that dominates your life if you are a
[1:30:08] christian
[1:30:10] it matters what's dominating you today
[1:30:12] amen amen our goal is not to have
[1:30:14] influence
[1:30:16] when you read this does that speak of
[1:30:18] influence from me
[1:30:20] it speaks of letting go of influence our
[1:30:22] goal is to be influenced amen by one
[1:30:25] thing alone and that's the holy spirit
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:28] when we talk about dominating
[1:30:30] i'll take it to hockey easy one to
[1:30:32] relate to if a team wins 10 to nothing
[1:30:35] they dominated another team didn't they
[1:30:37] the other team might well have not even
[1:30:39] shown up 10 to nothing that's a real
[1:30:41] beating isn't it brother bob you beat a
[1:30:42] hockey team 10 nothing that is
[1:30:44] dominating them amen
[1:30:46] the question is though in my life
[1:30:48] there's a hockey game going on
[1:30:50] and it's the holy spirit versus jonathan
[1:30:52] corlett
[1:30:53] and my question is is the score holy
[1:30:56] spirit 10 and jonathan corlett zero
[1:30:59] or is the holy or is it holy spirit five
[1:31:00] jonathan curlette five or is it god
[1:31:02] forbid jonathan collette 10 and holy
[1:31:04] spirit zero
[1:31:06] like i said look at how you spend your
[1:31:07] time that'll tell you what's been
[1:31:08] dominating your life recently amen
[1:31:10] what is it i want to be dominated so
[1:31:12] completely that i have no thought i have
[1:31:14] no say no influence no intent but to
[1:31:16] follow the holy leader holy spirit's
[1:31:18] leadership in my life amen and i do that
[1:31:22] by confirming it's in alignment with the
[1:31:23] word
[1:31:24] every time otherwise you can come under
[1:31:26] an influence that's very powerful and it
[1:31:28] feels right
[1:31:29] and it feels real and it feels good
[1:31:32] but guess what it's your carnal nature
[1:31:34] that's feeding on that it's not the holy
[1:31:36] spirit inside of you amen and for the
[1:31:38] believer it is always going to start as
[1:31:40] a religious spirit
[1:31:43] when it comes to the things we're
[1:31:44] talking about now i'm not saying there
[1:31:45] can't be other things but the one that
[1:31:46] we battle and we'll get to the quote
[1:31:48] here is religious spirits in a believer
[1:31:50] amen what is it because what it's
[1:31:53] demonic but it has the appearance of god
[1:31:55] satan appears as an angel of light amen
[1:31:57] and that's what he's trying to do is
[1:31:58] he's trying to fool the believer amen
[1:32:00] look at those 400 prophets in the time
[1:32:02] of ahab
[1:32:03] okay does the scripture say they were
[1:32:05] false prophets
[1:32:06] no says they were real prophets real men
[1:32:09] anointed and gifted to speak for god
[1:32:12] for god to speak through really is the
[1:32:13] way we should put it but what is it ahab
[1:32:16] wanted to get the go-ahead to go into
[1:32:18] battle and so he went to the prophecy he
[1:32:19] said seek the lord he said by the way
[1:32:21] i'd really like a positive answer here
[1:32:24] and so those men wanting to have
[1:32:27] influence and favor with the king opened
[1:32:29] themselves up to a line spirit because
[1:32:31] they wanted to give him a prophecy that
[1:32:33] would match his desires and so their
[1:32:35] desire to get the influence and favor of
[1:32:37] the king opened them up to a lying
[1:32:40] spirit
[1:32:42] it didn't come on micaiah because he
[1:32:44] wasn't seeking his own will and way
[1:32:46] he wasn't seeking to curry favor with
[1:32:47] the king or jehoshaphat or anybody he
[1:32:49] stayed there and he says i can only say
[1:32:51] what he says
[1:32:52] but those guys those 400 prophets
[1:32:55] right out of the school of prophet said
[1:32:56] yeah we'd like to give the king his
[1:32:58] answer the answer he wants and so that
[1:33:00] opened them up to that lying spirit and
[1:33:02] what happened they got caught up in
[1:33:03] their own desires and their own will and
[1:33:05] they became the speaker instead of the
[1:33:06] microphone
[1:33:07] that's what happened amen
[1:33:10] we're not supposed to be the speakers
[1:33:12] we're supposed to be the microphones
[1:33:13] amen
[1:33:15] i haven't noted here if you're never
[1:33:16] being corrected the holy spirit isn't
[1:33:18] working in your life and you're under a
[1:33:20] religious spirit
[1:33:23] that's hard but it's true
[1:33:25] because he always corrects his children
[1:33:27] and if we're not rapture ready then he's
[1:33:28] got to keep correcting us doesn't he
[1:33:30] amen
[1:33:31] i've been talking a lot about influence
[1:33:33] and what dominates us and the reason i'm
[1:33:35] doing that is because what dominates you
[1:33:36] determines if you have faith or not
[1:33:38] brother brown says this there's two
[1:33:40] elements for control
[1:33:41] that control the entire human race in
[1:33:43] the world one of them is fear and the
[1:33:45] other is faith now it's either faith or
[1:33:48] fear controls every nation every
[1:33:49] denomination and every individual it's
[1:33:52] either fear or faith that controls you
[1:33:54] so the question is when you act is it
[1:33:56] out of faith or is it out of fear
[1:33:59] easy answer faith reacts
[1:34:01] faith rests
[1:34:03] fear reacts faith rest fear gets worked
[1:34:06] up it gets frantic it justifies its
[1:34:08] action it tries to make it happen and
[1:34:10] what does it do it starts getting your
[1:34:12] humanity involved but faith just rests
[1:34:14] on the solid word of god and stays there
[1:34:16] and doesn't move until god tells you to
[1:34:18] move
[1:34:20] faith doesn't just sit there as we said
[1:34:21] faith is for action but it's to let you
[1:34:23] to sit still and know that he is god and
[1:34:25] find his will and then he puts you into
[1:34:27] action amen
[1:34:28] so look at the effect of what your
[1:34:30] actions in your life and are you acting
[1:34:31] to try and fix something are you acting
[1:34:33] to try and make yourself feel better
[1:34:36] guess what
[1:34:37] faith rarely takes you in the place that
[1:34:39] your carnality wants to
[1:34:40] faith rarely takes you to where your
[1:34:42] five senses say this is a good idea
[1:34:45] can i get an amen on that
[1:34:46] if you've ever walked in the will of god
[1:34:48] it rarely takes you into comfort amen
[1:34:51] right look at david in psalm 23 but he's
[1:34:53] in the caves
[1:34:55] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:34:56] while i sit in a cave fighting for my
[1:34:58] life
[1:34:59] amen faith rarely takes you where
[1:35:01] carnality would ever say it say to go
[1:35:03] amen but if you look at that and you see
[1:35:05] that you're trying to make yourself feel
[1:35:06] better rather than to work through it
[1:35:08] the way god wants you to you're never
[1:35:09] going to get the supernatural effect of
[1:35:11] god in your life because you keep
[1:35:12] ducking away from the thing he's trying
[1:35:13] to do be a supernatural god in a
[1:35:15] situation that requires a supernatural
[1:35:17] god amen so what do we say god i'm
[1:35:19] giving this to you i'm letting you have
[1:35:21] control and i'm going to rest on what
[1:35:23] you say and i'm going to keep moving
[1:35:25] forward and i'm going to keep doing what
[1:35:26] i always do and i'm just going to let
[1:35:28] you work the situation out and all of a
[1:35:29] sudden it's worked out like i said the
[1:35:32] testimony i gave of that that young man
[1:35:34] or that man that lost his wife you know
[1:35:35] when she wanted to go down to voice of
[1:35:38] god recordings and all these different
[1:35:39] things and threaten to leave him and he
[1:35:40] lost his job and this that and the other
[1:35:42] thing and he's sitting there now he
[1:35:43] could have went and he could have tried
[1:35:44] to do a lot of things maybe he could
[1:35:45] have divorced her said you know what
[1:35:47] she's out from under my head ship i'm
[1:35:48] going to divorce her. but what did he do
[1:35:50] he stayed there and he prayed and he
[1:35:51] held on to the word of god and god
[1:35:52] restored his marriage god restored his
[1:35:54] job and actually forgot to mention that
[1:35:55] they're pregnant as well
[1:35:57] right so he added to their life as well
[1:35:59] all of these things because he stayed
[1:36:00] there and didn't try and react to it
[1:36:02] amen but just trusted the word of god
[1:36:04] but what is it that turns faith into
[1:36:06] fear because it's human to have fear
[1:36:08] fear is a is a survival mechanism
[1:36:11] that's right right fear is a survival
[1:36:12] mechanism but we're not looking to
[1:36:14] survive
[1:36:15] because the song says we're looking to
[1:36:16] thrive
[1:36:17] amen we're not supposed to just be
[1:36:19] surviving i made it we're supposed to be
[1:36:21] overcoming we're supposed to be putting
[1:36:23] fear into other things
[1:36:24] can i put it that way we're supposed to
[1:36:25] be the one that they fear that satan
[1:36:27] fears
[1:36:28] you know that when he says you know what
[1:36:30] i'm going to send you over to selena
[1:36:31] today you demon he says don't send me to
[1:36:33] the selena
[1:36:35] don't do it
[1:36:37] in him
[1:36:39] that's what we ought to be
[1:36:41] don't for the love of all that is evil
[1:36:43] send me to take care of selena today
[1:36:46] right
[1:36:47] i've said it before we ought to be hell
[1:36:48] for hell
[1:36:50] remember what gives what takes that fear
[1:36:52] and turns it into faith what gives us
[1:36:54] faith very familiar scripture romans 10
[1:36:56] says so then faith cometh by hearing and
[1:36:58] hearing by the word of god brother bryan
[1:37:00] would say what is it a revelation what
[1:37:03] is faith it is god by the spirit
[1:37:05] revealing to you something that he's
[1:37:06] going to do or he's promised now if you
[1:37:09] only hear faith cometh by hearing but
[1:37:11] hearing is not faith a loaf of bread is
[1:37:14] purchased for 25 cents but 25 cents is
[1:37:16] not the loaf of bread see hearing only
[1:37:18] brings the word that produces faith but
[1:37:21] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:37:23] for the evidence of things not seen
[1:37:25] then you see you hear the word god
[1:37:27] reveals it to you that it is the truth
[1:37:29] and by spirit revealed truth confirms
[1:37:31] your faith to god he says do you get it
[1:37:34] that's why i keep saying you've got to
[1:37:36] have the new birth you've got to have
[1:37:37] the holy spirit because for the believer
[1:37:39] for perfect faith for rapturing faith
[1:37:42] you've got to have the holy spirit in
[1:37:43] there to quicken the faith that lies
[1:37:44] within you amen
[1:37:46] what is it true faith only comes by
[1:37:48] understanding the word of god which is
[1:37:49] the will of god amen
[1:37:51] what is it it's impossible to even
[1:37:53] comprehend the things of god jesus said
[1:37:55] you can't even understand the kingdom of
[1:37:56] god unless you have that new birth
[1:37:58] and that's why i have to shake my head
[1:38:00] when people that aren't
[1:38:01] christians or even professing christians
[1:38:04] try and take the bible and tangle with
[1:38:05] you they have no understanding of it
[1:38:07] they have no concept of what it means
[1:38:08] they'll pick one scripture out that
[1:38:10] they've looked up on google from
[1:38:11] somebody that's an atheist and say this
[1:38:13] is proof and you're like
[1:38:15] that's nothing to do with what we're
[1:38:16] talking about right what is it because
[1:38:18] they're trying to understand or combat
[1:38:20] the battle the word of god with the word
[1:38:22] of god which makes no sense
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:26] that's why i keep talking about what is
[1:38:28] it that dominates your life listen
[1:38:30] paul the apostle used to be saul the
[1:38:32] pharisee and he spent day in and day out
[1:38:35] studying the scriptures
[1:38:37] in the word of god he had committed his
[1:38:39] very life to it and until he got the
[1:38:40] holy spirit he was
[1:38:42] literally going after the true church of
[1:38:45] god he was persecuting the true
[1:38:47] believers
[1:38:48] while being buried in the word with his
[1:38:50] nose and the scrolls day in and day out
[1:38:52] to the point where he was a pharisee
[1:38:53] among pharisees he was the best of the
[1:38:55] best when it came to a religious person
[1:38:56] and yet he was persecuting them why
[1:38:58] because he didn't have the new birth
[1:39:00] you can do the same thing today you can
[1:39:02] you can be doing things and you think
[1:39:03] that you're in the will of god and you
[1:39:05] think that you're spiritual and it has
[1:39:06] nothing to do with it because you lack
[1:39:07] the holy spirit in your life amen that's
[1:39:09] why it matters what dominates you what
[1:39:11] dominates your time if hearing comes by
[1:39:13] the word how much word are you hearing
[1:39:15] that's a that's a real easy question
[1:39:17] isn't it how much time are you spending
[1:39:18] in the message how much time are you
[1:39:19] spending reading your bible because you
[1:39:21] can't have faith unless you know what to
[1:39:22] have faith in remember brother brown
[1:39:23] says you got to have something to have
[1:39:25] faith in to have faith it's got to rest
[1:39:27] on something that's got to be based on
[1:39:28] something amen
[1:39:30] so if you have another spirit working in
[1:39:32] you you can't have faith until you move
[1:39:33] that spirit out
[1:39:35] you move that spirit out and all of a
[1:39:36] sudden you've got a place now for the
[1:39:37] holy spirit to rise up inside of you and
[1:39:39] take its place but other than that we
[1:39:40] can attend church we can read our bible
[1:39:42] we can pray till we turn blue in the
[1:39:43] face but until we get the new birth then
[1:39:45] all we're doing is looking under
[1:39:46] something but we don't actually have it
[1:39:48] amen
[1:39:49] what is it what's going to happen is
[1:39:50] it's going to
[1:39:52] turn itself into a religious spirit
[1:39:54] and that's what you end up seeing is you
[1:39:55] see people that have been around the
[1:39:56] message for 20 30 years they never got
[1:39:58] the new birth and eventually they just
[1:40:00] end up wandering away they go sit by
[1:40:02] themselves they do whatever it is
[1:40:04] because they have nothing in them that
[1:40:05] unites them with the body
[1:40:07] right they've got a religious spirit
[1:40:08] they've got the word
[1:40:10] in terms of the letter but they don't
[1:40:11] have the spirit of that word inside of
[1:40:13] them amen
[1:40:15] look at this he says now remember this
[1:40:17] christ in the true church is a
[1:40:19] continuation of the book of acts
[1:40:22] he didn't say the book of facts
[1:40:25] because you know what facts lead to
[1:40:27] factions
[1:40:29] left and right
[1:40:31] right liberal conservative democrat
[1:40:33] republican
[1:40:34] whatever you want to call catholic
[1:40:36] protestant whatever it is facts lead to
[1:40:37] factions because everybody's got facts
[1:40:40] amen
[1:40:41] they didn't say it was a book of pacs
[1:40:42] either
[1:40:43] you think the way i think so let's join
[1:40:45] up
[1:40:46] no we're brought into what unity by one
[1:40:48] spirit amen
[1:40:50] one spirit is what draws us together
[1:40:52] into a book of acts church amen but the
[1:40:54] book of revelation shows how that the
[1:40:56] antichrist spirit will come into the
[1:40:58] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:41:00] formal and powerless it exposes satan
[1:41:03] revealing his works the attempted
[1:41:05] destruction of god's people in the
[1:41:06] discrediting of god's word right down to
[1:41:08] the time he has cast in the lake of fire
[1:41:10] satan never quits
[1:41:13] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:41:15] knows that if the people get the true
[1:41:17] revelation of the true church and what
[1:41:19] she is what she stands for and that she
[1:41:21] can do the greater works she will be an
[1:41:23] invincible army
[1:41:24] now like i said don't get caught up in
[1:41:26] doing the greater works yourself
[1:41:28] because we'll get into it it's not you
[1:41:30] that does it anyways
[1:41:31] the life that i live i live by the what
[1:41:33] faith of jesus christ
[1:41:35] so it's not you doing the work it's
[1:41:36] christ in you doing the work so all
[1:41:37] you're looking to do is get yourself out
[1:41:39] of the way so that he can have more
[1:41:40] access to you
[1:41:42] but this is we're talking about
[1:41:44] influences he says if they get a true
[1:41:45] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:41:47] framework of the christian church and by
[1:41:49] god's spirit discern and withstand the
[1:41:51] antichrist spirit satan will be
[1:41:53] powerless before her she he will be as
[1:41:55] definitely thwarted today as christ when
[1:41:58] christ withstood every effort to gain
[1:41:59] power over him in the desert
[1:42:01] satan yes satan hates revelation but we
[1:42:04] love it with true revelation in our
[1:42:06] lives the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:42:08] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:42:10] because he says what faith is a
[1:42:12] revelation
[1:42:13] right so what is it you've got to have a
[1:42:15] revelation for your situation you've got
[1:42:17] to have a revelation for who you are and
[1:42:18] you've got to have a revelation for what
[1:42:20] comes with who you are amen
[1:42:22] it's like i said for most believers the
[1:42:24] spirit they will most often fight is a
[1:42:26] religious spirit becomes with because it
[1:42:28] comes with a skin of spirituality with
[1:42:30] the meat of carnality inside of it amen
[1:42:33] it puts a spiritual spin on a carnal
[1:42:35] desire that's a religious spirit
[1:42:38] puts a spiritual spin on a carnal desire
[1:42:41] and i can say this from my own life that
[1:42:43] when i've had to deal with those things
[1:42:44] it became it came with a desire to
[1:42:46] influence to make people look up to me
[1:42:49] to impress people to make more money to
[1:42:51] improve my appearance or to make people
[1:42:52] admire me
[1:42:54] or to make people think i was something
[1:42:56] i wasn't
[1:42:57] i'm speaking by experience
[1:42:59] brother jonathan you've had a religious
[1:43:01] spirit absolutely i have i guarantee
[1:43:03] most of us had at some point in our life
[1:43:05] where what you tried to put on a facade
[1:43:07] that didn't match your experience that's
[1:43:09] what a religious spirit does it makes
[1:43:11] you pretend and guess what satan loves
[1:43:13] pretenders
[1:43:15] satan loves pretenders they are his
[1:43:17] greatest soldiers
[1:43:18] look at the seven sons of siva they were
[1:43:20] pretenders weren't they they said what
[1:43:23] they tried to cast out a demon in the
[1:43:25] name of jesus whom paul preaches
[1:43:29] and the demons said
[1:43:31] jesus i know
[1:43:33] paul i know
[1:43:34] who you
[1:43:36] are
[1:43:37] i have no clue who you are and what it
[1:43:38] is scripture says he ran them out of the
[1:43:41] house beating them and stripping their
[1:43:43] clothes off naked and made them there
[1:43:44] for everyone to see that they were false
[1:43:46] believers
[1:43:47] satan loves pretenders because they have
[1:43:49] no power
[1:43:50] remember what he said what we read in
[1:43:52] the last service where he said peter
[1:43:53] stood there and he preached and three
[1:43:54] thousand souls came to christ and satan
[1:43:56] didn't move but the minute he cast him
[1:43:58] out of a blind man
[1:44:01] then what happened
[1:44:02] sorry i have a man at the gate
[1:44:04] beautiful as soon as he casts them out
[1:44:05] he says they got thrown into jail why
[1:44:07] because satan can't stand it when he is
[1:44:09] cast out of your life he doesn't care if
[1:44:11] you come to church what he cares is if
[1:44:13] coming to church has an effect on your
[1:44:14] life that causes him to be pulled out
[1:44:16] amen
[1:44:17] god's looking for the genuine believer
[1:44:19] that takes him at his word him and we're
[1:44:20] at the pinnacle of the gentile age
[1:44:23] right it started high alpha we're at the
[1:44:25] end omega it's the same thing but it
[1:44:27] takes us into a rapture and so we're at
[1:44:29] the pinnacle of all this after that he's
[1:44:31] going to the jews and the 144 thousand
[1:44:33] and the gentiles are out there's no hope
[1:44:35] for the gentile except by works and to
[1:44:36] give their life amen but what's the
[1:44:39] challenge today we've heard our pastor
[1:44:40] say it do you have faith to go in the
[1:44:42] rapture
[1:44:43] do you have faith for this do you
[1:44:44] believe for this do you do
[1:44:46] all these things what's our challenge
[1:44:49] challenges to believe that we do
[1:44:51] even though it doesn't always appear
[1:44:52] that we do it's like i said at the
[1:44:53] beginning if you have the holy spirit
[1:44:55] you have everything in you that's needed
[1:44:56] for this walk on earth to take you all
[1:44:58] the way to a rapture and a resurrection
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:01] how do i know that
[1:45:03] brother brown would he doesn't say it
[1:45:05] this way i've summarized it but the word
[1:45:06] opens the door to faith
[1:45:08] right that's what we just read in in
[1:45:10] romans there is that faith cometh by
[1:45:13] excuse me hearing and hearing by the
[1:45:14] word so the word opens the door to faith
[1:45:16] so we saw faith drop as the purity of
[1:45:19] the word dropped right we saw it
[1:45:20] preached on the day of pentecost in its
[1:45:22] full purity there was no man in there
[1:45:24] there was no ideas there was no
[1:45:25] doctrines that weren't of god on the day
[1:45:27] of pentecost three thousand souls came
[1:45:29] in and they went and signs and wonders
[1:45:30] followed them but then as they moved on
[1:45:33] and then it talks about in revelation
[1:45:35] the ephesian church what did they do
[1:45:36] they left their first love and what
[1:45:38] happened is men got involved and they
[1:45:40] started adding to it and they started
[1:45:42] wanting influence and power over the
[1:45:43] people as a rather than over this the
[1:45:45] powers of satan and they got in and they
[1:45:48] started to add in things that had
[1:45:49] nothing to do with the word of god and
[1:45:50] what happened was the faith went down as
[1:45:52] the purity of the word came down
[1:45:54] because you can only rise to the level
[1:45:56] of the word that you're hearing
[1:45:57] right so the more tainted it is the more
[1:45:59] hybrid it is then the weaker it is until
[1:46:01] the point that it comes as brother brown
[1:46:02] says cold formless and powerless
[1:46:04] lukewarm
[1:46:05] and powerless amen
[1:46:07] as it went into the dark ages they got
[1:46:09] to the place where only the priests
[1:46:11] could read the word
[1:46:12] the common man couldn't do it and by
[1:46:14] then it was so wrapped up in catholicism
[1:46:16] and all the dogmas and ideas and these
[1:46:18] different things that there was no faith
[1:46:19] to be had
[1:46:20] it was dead it was dead nothing there
[1:46:23] you had just a couple select believers
[1:46:25] that was it i'd be curious to know how
[1:46:26] many come out of these ages
[1:46:29] right here can't be many because the
[1:46:31] word wasn't being preached
[1:46:33] all right you just had a select few that
[1:46:34] would show these things amen but then we
[1:46:36] come to here and we have the restoration
[1:46:38] of the faith through what malachi 4.
[1:46:41] why did he have to come back and restore
[1:46:43] the word
[1:46:44] because the restored word can give us a
[1:46:45] restored faith that'll bring us all the
[1:46:47] way to full redemption i mean that's all
[1:46:49] he was doing so that's why he had to
[1:46:50] clear up godhead that's why he had to
[1:46:51] clear up marriage and divorce and
[1:46:53] serpent seed and all these different
[1:46:54] things is because the word had to come
[1:46:56] in purity so that the faith that follows
[1:46:58] it could come in purity as well if the
[1:46:59] word is pure then the faith that follows
[1:47:01] it will also be pure and it'll take you
[1:47:03] directly into the will of god amen so
[1:47:05] all we're asked to do is have faith in
[1:47:06] it believe
[1:47:08] obey obey means to act on it
[1:47:11] not just say it in our head but to act
[1:47:12] on it and then we wait in expectation
[1:47:15] because you can't make it happen it's
[1:47:17] god that's doing the work so all you're
[1:47:18] doing is you're waiting an expectation
[1:47:20] you're walking in expectation you're
[1:47:21] talking an expectation you're speaking
[1:47:23] an expectation but it's god that's going
[1:47:25] to do the work in you
[1:47:26] and we're at the place now where there
[1:47:28] is nothing in the word contained in the
[1:47:29] word that we can't have amen we're at
[1:47:32] the end of time at the end of the
[1:47:33] gentile dispensation there's nothing
[1:47:35] written in this book that pertains to us
[1:47:38] that isn't available to us the
[1:47:39] redemptive blessings were available all
[1:47:41] through there regardless redemptive
[1:47:43] blessings have nothing to do with the
[1:47:44] word if you preached it and believed it
[1:47:46] you could have it
[1:47:47] right but now we're at the point where
[1:47:49] it's not just redemptive blessings but
[1:47:51] it is full redemption faith for full
[1:47:53] redemption which is what our bodies
[1:47:56] coming into that perfect theophany amen
[1:48:01] amen so now in the purity of the full
[1:48:02] word the fullness of faith is available
[1:48:04] to the believer
[1:48:06] and we've had the same angel visitation
[1:48:07] that abraham had just before he got his
[1:48:09] promise
[1:48:10] right abraham had a body change
[1:48:12] sarah had a body change they weren't
[1:48:13] having intimate relations she was way
[1:48:15] past the time of a woman and his seat
[1:48:17] had dried up inside him there was
[1:48:18] nothing there but yet in a few short
[1:48:20] months
[1:48:21] they had a full body change
[1:48:23] that's an amazing thing to hear
[1:48:26] listen to this as we start to close he
[1:48:28] says but watch what kind of a miracle
[1:48:29] this angel did that stayed with abraham
[1:48:32] he had his back turned and told abraham
[1:48:33] his name had been changed abram yeah
[1:48:36] called him abraham instead of abram he
[1:48:38] could not have the baby till his name
[1:48:40] was changed and neither sarah
[1:48:42] he told them what their name was the
[1:48:44] angel told them that and he said he was
[1:48:45] going to visit sarah according to the
[1:48:46] time of life and sarah laughed about it
[1:48:49] and when sarah laughed the man with his
[1:48:51] back turned the man eating the flesh of
[1:48:53] the calf and drinking the milk from the
[1:48:54] cow and eating bread a man with dust on
[1:48:56] his clothes a traveler was god himself
[1:49:00] and abraham recognized it because he
[1:49:02] knew the thought that was in sarah's
[1:49:03] heart behind him he said why did sarah
[1:49:05] say within herself how can these things
[1:49:07] be
[1:49:08] is anything too hard for god
[1:49:10] see and sarah run out and denied it he
[1:49:13] said yes you did
[1:49:15] now here took sarah's life right there
[1:49:18] for her to disbelieve but see she is a
[1:49:21] part of abraham amen
[1:49:24] now catch this last sentence
[1:49:26] and our unbelief in his great
[1:49:28] manifestation in this hour
[1:49:31] he says we're a part of christ
[1:49:33] he just he has to keep it amen
[1:49:36] why
[1:49:37] because we don't always believe do we
[1:49:39] church
[1:49:41] i i identify i think more often with the
[1:49:43] man with the man that came with his son
[1:49:45] that had had to have the demon cast out
[1:49:47] of him of epilepsy and jesus said if
[1:49:48] thou canst believe all things are
[1:49:49] possible he said lord i believe
[1:49:52] help thou my unbelief
[1:49:55] we'll get into why he said that in a
[1:49:56] couple services but i think that's where
[1:49:58] a lot of us are these days is that we
[1:50:00] have ups and downs when it comes to our
[1:50:01] faith
[1:50:02] we have a ton of faith when the holy
[1:50:04] spirit's moving in the service but when
[1:50:05] we're standing alone and facing it at
[1:50:07] home it's a lot more difficult isn't it
[1:50:09] amen amen but what does he say that what
[1:50:12] our unbelief that god looks past is our
[1:50:14] disbelief that the great manifestation
[1:50:16] of this hour is here today
[1:50:18] now we had a great manifestation through
[1:50:20] malachi 4 didn't we
[1:50:23] but that wasn't enough
[1:50:24] because the great manifestation wasn't
[1:50:26] abraham
[1:50:27] it wasn't eliezer but it was the life
[1:50:29] that came out of sarah that was the
[1:50:31] great manifestation was out of death
[1:50:33] came life
[1:50:34] and so it's no different for us as he's
[1:50:36] sitting there and he's saying
[1:50:37] bride sometimes you don't believe what
[1:50:39] i'm telling you about yourself
[1:50:41] but he says i look past that because
[1:50:42] you're a part of me
[1:50:44] and god's word has to come true so i'm
[1:50:46] going to keep looking past it until you
[1:50:48] come to the place where we can be one
[1:50:50] together
[1:50:51] that's what he's doing is he looks past
[1:50:53] he looks past it and we can say lord i
[1:50:55] don't disbelieve and he'd say no no no
[1:50:57] you do
[1:50:58] but it's okay because i'm gonna bring
[1:51:00] you to the place it has nothing to do
[1:51:01] with you in the first place i'm just
[1:51:02] proving my word in your life
[1:51:04] and i'm going to bring you to the place
[1:51:06] where you have exactly what i'm talking
[1:51:08] about
[1:51:09] and despite her condition despite her
[1:51:11] unbelief there sarah still had a body
[1:51:13] change
[1:51:14] but i guarantee you i don't know i'd be
[1:51:16] curious to know what happened you know
[1:51:18] did it happen over three months and she
[1:51:19] just started getting less wrinkly you
[1:51:22] know
[1:51:23] and things started to appear that it
[1:51:24] long disappeared
[1:51:25] or did she just wake up one morning and
[1:51:28] she was a beautiful young woman again
[1:51:31] but i imagine they had a
[1:51:32] a hallelujah revival
[1:51:35] in the tent
[1:51:37] abraham especially
[1:51:40] when the wife of his youth had been
[1:51:41] restored to him
[1:51:43] and then sarah said you're not so bad
[1:51:44] looking yourself there sport
[1:51:47] amen i believe
[1:51:49] they woke up one morning and they just
[1:51:51] realized wow
[1:51:53] he's done it
[1:51:54] the body's been changed
[1:51:57] all that's going to come forth now is
[1:51:58] life amen
[1:51:59] that's why our faith rests in the fact
[1:52:01] that he changed our life
[1:52:03] that's why you've got to have the new
[1:52:04] birth because that's the life-changing
[1:52:06] experience amen and then you know that
[1:52:08] he changed you then you know that he's
[1:52:09] going to take you all the way through
[1:52:11] because he started the work and he'll be
[1:52:12] faithful to complete it amen let's stand
[1:52:15] together if we would
[1:52:16] and then praise the lord my voice didn't
[1:52:18] go cracked a couple times but
[1:52:20] i meant i'm glad for that amen
[1:52:23] what is the great manifestation of this
[1:52:24] hour it's not brother branham
[1:52:26] that was one man
[1:52:28] but now he's got a manifestation and a
[1:52:30] complete bride of christ amen that's
[1:52:32] walking this earth and all he's waiting
[1:52:33] for is her to step up into that realm of
[1:52:35] faith amen it's not me that's holding me
[1:52:38] it's not you that's holding you amen
[1:52:39] it's god's great grace and his word that
[1:52:42] promised a certain end to us that's
[1:52:43] holding us amen each and every day amen
[1:52:46] let's bow our heads
[1:52:48] heavenly father
[1:52:49] lord thank you for your goodness and
[1:52:51] grace

[2:05:54] and that song speaks to everything
[2:05:55] brother john was just speaking about
[2:05:57] it just points to all that that's that
[2:05:59] was on my mind right throughout what he
[2:06:01] was what he was preaching
[2:06:03] amen
[2:06:04] praise the lord let's just sing
[2:06:08] 12 19 it's
[2:06:10] no longer a slave to fear
[2:06:12] he referred to fear and that's uh
[2:06:15] we know it's one of the devil's greatest
[2:06:18] weapons and that is fear because it's
[2:06:21] the opposite of faith
[2:06:23] so let's sing that
[2:06:26] with that testimony that we're no longer
[2:06:28] a slave to that fear
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:44] [Music]

[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:40] i am
[2:10:41] [Music]
[2:11:02] amen i was just thinking as we sing as i
[2:11:04] i'm
[2:11:05] no longer a slave to fear we can sing it
[2:11:08] no problem but if we were believers over
[2:11:10] in ukraine when bombs are falling all
[2:11:12] around us
[2:11:14] what would would we be singing that
[2:11:17] you know that's that's a trial that
[2:11:18] they're going through right and who
[2:11:21] knows maybe we'll have to go through a
[2:11:22] similar trial but
[2:11:24] and there was a testimony of of
[2:11:27] uh an unexploded missile that landed in
[2:11:30] the near
[2:11:32] it wasn't in was it inside the property
[2:11:34] i think it might have been inside the
[2:11:35] building
[2:11:36] of uh of believers and it didn't explode
[2:11:40] right no longer a slave to fear after
[2:11:43] that
[2:11:44] right god's looking after his children
[2:11:47] that's that's that's the point
[2:11:49] amen let's just sing 1187 before we go
[2:11:52] it's um
[2:11:53] spread your wings little eagle
[2:11:55] and fly
[2:11:59] amen let's sing let's sing that that's
[2:12:01] probably you want to come close and pray
[2:12:03] amen let's uh let's remember to pray one
[2:12:07] for another once again we pray for
[2:12:08] brother john as he uh
[2:12:10] recovers god give him grace
[2:12:12] and strength to do so
[2:12:14] and uh come expecting on on wednesday uh
[2:12:18] next service so
[2:12:20] come expect it more and more so as we
