may father God that all Lord God will work Lord God according to your perfect will Lord God we thank you for hearing and answering tonight and we look to you and we say thanks in Jesus Christ precious name we pray and we say amen and amen praise God amen amen I just want to do a continuation of the the topic that we were on the the other day um and I spoke with brother Bob after the service and brother Bob said that brother gari there's so much more to that you know so I'm kind of under his advice to you know take it a little bit further and also I was in church um I think it was last Sunday and you know brother John was preaching and he said something there you know and I said yes yes Lord you know I um tonight I'm going to use something that he said but then as a reference or in reference to the topic that I'll be preaching tonight and that is character by Authority you know character by Authority um I will like also to turn I ask Bel visel just to go with me as we you know uh our Bibles to Ephesian 2 and we will read from verses 5 and six and it read thus even when we were dead in sins has quit us together with Christ for by grace are ye saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you may be see seated tonight amen you know while brother John was preaching the other day and he make reference to to Joseph the Journey of Joseph really and you know it must have been something you know Joseph getting the dream and you know the dream direct exactly the plan of God for him in other word he could see by God's Vision about his destination that God said at the end of it you will sit on the throne all right and but you see we said like this really that God show him the hand but he didn't show him the process and you know and so tonight I like to use uh Joseph as a reference to you know uh a way father because that process is where many of us uh fail really but we would like to see exactly our position for this end time exactly what God has in store for us and so we see for this end time just like Joseph really we saw that you know brother Bram said that God you know had shown us the ending of the display of his attribute really that's what was revealed to us that at the end of it really you know after all the trials are over over after all the suffering and all of this amen hallelujah the bride will overcome you know and and you know it's you know it it Dawn on my heart really because you know the sufferings are real the trials are real but the glory that follows is real amen praise God and so we see God if we can catch a vision exactly what God saw about us really that this journey will end you know he shows the bride or or destiny you know that on that is on the other side or on the Eternal side you know as Jesus said he that overcome you know he will grant to sit with with with me in my Throne as I overcame and I'm sitting with my father you know in his St in other words at the end of it really there's a crowning moment for the bride so it doesn't you know the trial the suffering and all of us is real but at the end of it God said we will over come praise God and so he shows us by the voice of Malaki 4 he shows us exactly what will happen after the ages are completed you know that she was caught up Amen brother bam said in Revelation chapter 4 that she was caught up amen hallelujah after the ages are over after the experience of this life is over after the Suffering The the pain and the walls and all of this Amen brother said that she was caught up Hallelujah and God show her exactly where she will go you know when all of this is over that's a beautiful thing tonight Church Hallelujah and so we saw to the voice of Malachi 4 you know that God showed us really our position that we are now in a condition that you know it is called a a sinful condition we we we're we're in this condition that you know sin Hallelujah has taken us you know into into into a state where we are separated from God but we see that said that sin is really unbelief and this unbelief but what I'm say this is unbelieving the word of God you see Church on the Eternal side before sin came into the picture really all things were perfect because the people of God were living by the word of God as Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God and so if we were living by the Eternal Word Hallelujah we would have continued in an eternal State living perfectly by the Eternal Word there would have been nothing of sin Hallelujah to disrupt the order of God but because of sin and what was that sin one word was brought in the change CH the parameter of things one word was brought in and we are here where we are and so because of that we know that for us to get back to the position there have to be a prophet or a word sent to us speaking the Eternal Word to us in other words we have to go back to the Eternal Word and so God sent a prophet Hallelujah to with a with with with a word to the bride to restore us back to eternity can I say to you tonight Paul said and tonight we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in other word we have received that Eternal Word and right now Hallelujah while we sing and we worship we create that Eternal atmosphere because Hallelujah because we have received that Eternal Word right now Hallelujah the angels are gathered Hallelujah we said the Eternal side is G why because we have heard from eternity and if we have the Eternal world then we can go back home Hall living in that Eternal position I'm trying to show you tonight church that the bride in her overcoming Hallelujah will be restored back to the Eternal world she will be restored back to that and to inner soul hallelujah hallelujah listen Church though we are living in this Mortal body though we are we we are conformed Hallelujah by by the natural phenomenons of this life Hallelujah but God has brought a word in our hearts and in our heart Hallelujah we know Hallelujah I don't know I I heard but Mark said it sometime but sometime you can feel the effect of the presence of the Lord sometime it makes you cry sometime it it makes you shout sometime it makes you dance what is happening eternity is called Hallelujah and so when it calls Hallelujah it create an atmosphere and you when you step into that atmosphere what it does to you Church it makes you feel Hallelujah like you're in Heaven Again Hallelujah we are seated together in Heavenly atmosphere Hallelujah by the Eternal presence of God we are certain Hallelujah that God has sent us a voice in this end time and so Paul in Ephesians 2 2 if I read it again it says even when we were dead in sin and trespasses has he equit us together with Christ we are made we are quitten with Christ We Are Made Alive by the grace of God and tonight church I I I I probably go a little bit slow because there's some some things I want to bring out to you tonight I want to show you our position Hallelujah that we are seated in Heavenly places tonight we are seated in Heavenly places Hallelujah We Are Made Alive and we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we see the position tonight Church Hallelujah that we have received as B said you know and I'm going to use some term that you you follow me a little bit and I'm saying this to you tonight that you understand just like Joseph huah God has shown us exactly what we will inherit and so I want to get that into your into your s tonight but after all of that there's an inheritance that awaits you H Hallelujah and so we speak of it in one sense tonight uh Hallelujah though we have hear this Mortal but but we can still speak uh Hal in the in the perspective of overcoming because we have receive th say the Lord and it cannot fail church amen and so we see for the from disos of the Eternal side we saw that God you know you know he said that the the God you know the The Throne of God which you know say it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in other word if if I can breing that down a little bit to you you see when Moses met uh met a pillar fire Hallelujah in the form of the burning bush it was God in the form of the pillar of fire all right and so when the pillar of fire came it was at the time was God H was going to take his people out of bondage and he was going to deliver them right and so the P fire church Hallelujah is the father stone is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is God H in a form but you see when they saw God in that form they didn't know who he was Moses said who must I say that set me it said tell them that I am that I am in other word it was that the Great Eternal God that condescended to them Church Hallelujah to and God was getting ready to get his people out and to elevate them are you there me Church Hallelujah and so that pillar fire Hallelujah brother John said the other day Hallelujah that there was a a person that was hiding behind it it was Christ the word you know follow me a little bit as we go as I break this down a little bit so we see bam said but pillar fire that that Moses made was Christ he was made flesh in the person of Jesus Christ he came down he condescended Hallelujah in know word at one time we we didn't know who he was no one we didn't know Hallelujah who this God was but when he came down what he was doing he was getting ready to reconcile us back to himself Hallelujah and so when we saw him Hallelujah we couldn't bring a definition for him Hallelujah but we know this one thing but said Hallelujah that pillar fire got to be made flesh first to do what to redeem and to restore us back to God and so in St John 13 and verse three the Bible said and Jesus know that he that the father has given him all things in his hands he said that he was come from God and he went to God in other word god Jesus was the manifested God how you there me Church H it was God that descended it was God that was made manifested and Jesus said unto them this St John :se 42 he said and Jesus said unto them but if God were your father he would have loved me for I proceeded forth and I came forth from God neither came I of myself but he sent me he proceeded from the bosom of the father in other word God was made flesh in the person of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so the pil fire church Hallelujah was really Hal a housing that hide the person Hallelujah and Jesus preceeded the bodily form proceeded from the pillar fire that we look upon and we say that's the Son of God that's Jesus how God in his manifested form St John 16 verse 27 the Bible said for the father himself loved you because he have love me and have belied that I came out from God and I came forth from the father and I'm come into the world again I leave the world and go to the father Hallelujah and so the pill fire came down into flesh but Jesus was telling them that I am going back Hallelujah to what I was before are you there me church but now the pillar fire is here in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost seated where in our hearts church so God the same person Jesus Hallelujah that walk the shores Hallelujah is here he has condescended and he's living in our heart by the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise God and so the Father Strong really H is here by the Holy Ghost in our heart Hallelujah so he came from God he went back to God he came from the pillar of fire Hallelujah and he was manifested in flesh Hallelujah but he he went back Hallelujah to God when Paul met him on his way to Damascus Hallelujah Paul after a question the same question that Moses asked who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus you must be wondering where I'm going with all of this normally I Don't Preach this technical but I want you to understand see what I'm I'm going with all of this that the Throne of God came to Earth and the Throne of God when we saw it Hallelujah we could not Define it because it was all fire but when the Throne of God was made flesh it was showing that God Plan of Redemption was to move out of the spiritual form into a fleshly form are you there with me Church Hallelujah why did he do that because Hallelujah of the perspective of your Redemption Hallelujah that you got to be seated hallelujah oh he has to be seated on your heart and so when he came down Hallelujah he was making the way preparing for us to go to him hallelujah praise God to the throne Church Jesus Christ is living inside of you and I St Matthew 26 and verse 6 it says that's St Matthew 26 and verse 26 sorry and as they as they were eating hallelujah oh oh let let me just go through this a little bit you see when Jesus was here before I go through the scripture here let me just elaborate a little bit on it you see when Jesus was here church he knew he knew that he had to go back to God and so that last moment that last communion moment it did something that resonated our understanding of our Redemption that every time when we go to the communion table it speak of Hallelujah the position to which we will the place communion is not just heating up eating bread and drinking wine there's a greater understanding behind it Hallelujah and so Jesus in St Matthew 26 and verse 22 he said and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to his disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it unto them saying drink ye all of it for this is the blood of the new testament which it which is shed Hallelujah for many for the remissions of sin I want to Mark verse 29 in your Bible it said but I say unto you I will not drink anyport of this fruit of of of the vine until the day when I drink it and you with you in my father's Kingdom what was he doing Church you see it was communion it was the last Hallelujah social gathered together where they had this Great Fellowship but Jesus knew this that he had to go back Hallelujah to the pillar of fire and so what in the church Hallelujah he gave them a memorial that as often as you remember this know this for sure that my Redemption plan for you it must be fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah the all that I have planned for you Hallelujah I'm going back to God but you know what you do Hallelujah Heat this bread drink this cup Hallelujah as a remembrance of what will follow after my Ascension remember what I said to you before in all of that stuff I said earlier that he went back to the pillar fire and he had to go up and when he went up he knew that in that Corporal body he will never heat it again but he said but I'm going to heat again with you when all is over in other word rest assur Church your trials Hallelujah God said Hallelujah you will overcome because you will eat it again with me hallelujah amen so after his resurrection H said after he died hallah and his body was taken up it was taken back to the father's Throne it went back to light it came off the scene Hallelujah went back to the pillar fire that's what Paul me Hallelujah that body resurrected body went back to God and what he's doing is Seated on the throne right now so when you see Jesus you're not going to see right now if he come to the building it cannot come in the Corporal body Hallelujah why because you are here hallelujah and because you are here he comes he descended in spirit form he came down in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost why did he do that because Hallelujah the works that he started wasn't completed the works got to continue Hallelujah and so when he went up he came back down and he said a little while and the world won't see me but you will see me and as I live he shall live also so to the Overcomers he said Hallelujah I will grant to sit with me in my Throne as I overcame and he's sitting Hallelujah with his father in his throne what the father's Throne he R back to the pillar of Fire but he said Hallelujah to the Overcomers in this time you will get the Hallelujah the the royalty of sitting with Christ oh my amen so bam said in the message sir we would see Jesus preached 1955 butam said now his body with n scar scar in it it said has not come back yet he said it is sitting on the right hand of God he a see is sitting on the father's Throne now but when he comes back he's going to sit on his own Throne he said the Throne of David that he inherited he said that when he comes back in physical form oh my I could say a lot right there church Hallelujah so he went up Hallelujah but he's coming back down but he's stays there in in the form of the Holy Ghost but what did he said he said I'm not going to leave your comfortless but Hallelujah but if I go Hal I'm going to send the comforter and the comforter is going to come and he going to live even in you the Bible said and he is the spirit of Truth he said that's when he comes in physical form but he's here now in spiritual form working through your body and my body that's him now he said so we see him by The Works he does they couldn't believe that he was God so he was so so he said if you can't believe me believe the works that I do for the works that I do testify that the father has sent me they couldn't believe a man being God that said just look at the works he said if I do not the works of my father what did he mean by that he said if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if you do the works of my father then believe me the father testify of me it said what was the works of the father it said what's oh accurate everything he said look exactly what he said and what he prophesied is he said perfect they know it was God God in us the hope of glory it's said oh I just love to talk about it oh my amen so listen what I'm saying to you church as we go break it down a little bit further now listen God does not have two bodies can I say that again God does not have two bodies when he took that body had a Resurrection it went off the scene are you there at the church and so the bride tonight is the body of Jesus Christ because in that body Hall of Jesus Christ God overcame everything and when he fought IR wrestle brother brother said he wrestled death IR wrestle hell IR wrestle grave he wrestled the principalities and Powers he wrestled all of them but you know what and he he overcame and when he overcame it in other words Church Hallelujah if he set the principle for himself he says that I set that same principle for you and I so he went up Hallelujah and he took that body off the seene and it stays there until so he comes back down in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to do what Hallelujah because Hallelujah just as how he overcame he said and if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwelleth in you Hallelujah he that same spirit will quitting H your mortal bodies the spirit of God is here to continue the works of God oh my I feel real religious tonight hallelujah what am I saying to you church I'm saying to you that if you're called and predestinate for the heart H just as as God cannot fail H your faith in the promised word cannot fail the bride will overcome so he took that body off the scene and he went back to the pillar of fire that's what I meant when I oh that I was mentioning earlier that pillar fire hall it had to be made flesh first Hal and when he was made flesh we know who the pillar fire is Moses didn't get a name but Paul and you and I has gotten a name we know who he is we know is he is that the is the Lord Jesus Christ so he went up but now God has but calls her the mystical body of Jesus Christ but can I tell you something that is so beautiful you see when he when he was serving that communion Hallelujah I want us the when a Time you know the communion service is being served to reflect on these things really reflect on the promise of God concerning your life that you are an overcomer and you are called to overcome amen hallelujah and what God did you see when he went up all the inheritance belongs to him but you know what he did Hallelujah he stays there and he waits Hallelujah why because he wants you and I Hal to come to the position of overcoming just like himself Hallelujah and so though he's seated but it's not it's not the the the godhead is not complete not until the Bride Comes in position oh my hallelujah praise God so what did he do Church he ties his kingship Hallelujah to you and I he will be Crown but you can't Crown spirit so he's a spirit he cannot be crowned Spirit but he went up and God said and you stay there until your enemy becomes your foot stol he not talking about himself he already overcome but the enemy Hallelujah that is challenging you and I tonight our faith has been challenged but he said but your enemy shall become your foot stol Hallelujah and so he went up Hallelujah and he stays there Hallelujah and he waits until you and I Hallelujah come to the position Hallelujah he ties his kingship Bel Us in this great Covenant h tonight we said that he's in spirit form waiting church but he said that the works of God hallelujah he said it's not by might now listen what I'm saying it's not about what you can do for yourself sir it's not by might it's him Hallelujah he says that I'm coming down and when I descend I'm coming in you to live in you to overcome through you amen hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah is him doing the works of Transformation Church Hallelujah to transform the inner man into his own Perfection the bride is his body right now the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah amen and so this coming coming a time when he will descended you see all of this is trying to show you what David what Joseph had in terms of his crowning position H that the trials are real but the glory is real are you very church and Jesus is saying that this Glory that we speak of is not a glory of of un hurly inheritance but your glory of an heavly inheritance now you there the church and soam said in the message in the message Masterpiece preached 1964 butam said now we find this perfect Masterpiece that God has had completed now we notice that it was all that it was promised to be and all the promises all of the prophecies he said everything that God had made him a a promise of said thy seed shall bruise The Serpent and now he could not bruise it with the law Hallelujah he could not abuse it with the prophet but he did did it when the woman's seed became the Masterpiece it said Christ is that he was the stone that Daniel saw heed out of the mountain he was the one that could Smite he is the one that could bruise is that br who the serpent Ed Hallelujah he said his life matches exactly the life of Moses his life matches Hallelujah David he said let's see he said if it was he said if he said he is the matching pieces Hallelujah so so butam said that Jesus H is the matching pieace now you what I'm saying to you Church you see this matching piece how the Covenant has two parts to it the two parts of the Covenant H said it had to DCT tail perfectly to become one and the Covenant mark it cannot be completed and United together Hallelujah and so we know Church Hallelujah that you have received a part of the Covenant in you right now but there's another part of the cant that is seated in Heavenly places and one day Church the two pieces got to come together Hallelujah there going to be a union of the two pieces but said the two pieces got to doct tail hallelujah what am I saying to your church Hallelujah just like Jesus he overcame Church you got to overcome because according to the prophecy God says ham said the two pieces came together oh my Hallelujah and so John said 1 John 3 he said behold what manner of love the father has restored upon us that we should be called the sons of God he said therefore the world knoweth us not because it knoweth not him it's said belov it now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that Hallelujah when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is hallelujah when he descended Hallelujah for the Rapture said that he cannot come to the Earth in his Corporal body because God can't have two bodies on the earth at the same time and so what he did he came in the in in the atmosphere and the bride will have to leave the hurt and meet him for the two pieces to come together Hal in the here to become one hallelujah praise God and so Hallelujah we know church that these things are real so our Redemption is spoken of I'm just trying to show you that it is spoken of that that that your child that we going through Hallelujah it it mean well that God will see us through Hallelujah so the Covenant of Grace brought Perfection it was God's complete work he did to bring his bride Hallelujah to get her perfected by his own blood and did exactly according to the word that was spoken by the Lord hallelujah if I might show you just one more I know I've been on this but I'm I'm emphasizing that you understand that the bride has overcome and when she overcome she will sit with him Hallelujah and the two will become one by the Covenant that we have and just one more before before I go over into other things very important before I leave tonight Revelation 4 and verse one John said and after this I look and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard Hallelujah was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up either and I will show you things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat upon the throne in know I'm going to stop a little bit and break this down as we go that's what I do I teach and preach sometimes so it's a good thing Wednesday night I can do that right so John was caught up but said after this after the ages are over something came alive di in the heart of the Bride she knows where she comes from she knows where she's going and she's caught up into the revelation of the how she knows in her heart Hallelujah that she comes from God and she knows that she's going back Hallelujah glory to God and so here the Revelation Show Jesus Hallelujah that he said behold a throne and and I'm sorry that I didn't have all this quot you know but preach of on this on Revelation chapter 4 you know it's it's it's beautiful beautiful message you know this least done completely you know but for time sake I'll just say it verb but he said the first thing John saw was a throne what was the throne the baptism of the Holy Ghost in other word this is a chair let's go it's not a throne is not a chair it's it was the pillar of fire but let's say this was the throne and when John saw it it was empty no one was sitting on it but John like he take a second look and John got a further revelation of it and John said and he that sat upon it in other word the throne becomes a person it becomes the he that is sitting on the throne in other words God unveil more of a revelation hand off himself are you there church and the Bible said and he that no it mooved from just the throne the throne to he to he that was seting on the throne and it said Hallelujah and he that was set up on the throne was to look up like a Jasper h and a sing Stone but said it was Reuben and Benjamin in other word it was a covenant that was given to to Israel and there was a rainbow run about the throne in the side like an emerald I'm giving you the symbols Hallelujah you understand that it speaks to your redemption in other word there was a rainbow that around the throne but this is how I do it I'm just like this I'm very inquisitive really you know every time when the rain because I like to see the rainbow it reminds me of the Covenant of God but you notice every time you see that rainbow is always always an arch it never complete but this time when all when the bride is taken up the Covenant Church is completed in other words Church the bride has already made it she was seen in heaven she already she she was seen as an overcomer John say she has overcome hallelujah praise God so the Holy Ghost come down in us tonight to bring us into that overcoming position Hallelujah now let's get to your I tonight quickly you see the Holy Ghost came down to do a work and that work Hallelujah is a work of Grace on the inside because this bride got to be made perfect Hallelujah but this Perfection brother Mark it had to be God himself working on the inside so when he went up he came down and he started a work Hallelujah on the inside Hallelujah said but he's here now in spirit form working through your body and my body he said that's him so we can see him by the works that he does in the message Easter seal preach 1965 but said is Messianic anointed he said once believe that what is the he said what is the Messiah he said what is the Messiah he said Messiah is the anointed one and now if he could if he were was the Messiah by being the anointed one from that day to fulfill the word of God he said to be the Redeemer of the anointed one and God raised up that body and his bride is the anointed for for this day is a it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one when he came down Church the anointing you know and when I speak like this because I know when we speak of the anointing is something that is overemphasized in this day you know it heeds to say that I am anointed by God but the anointing the work of the anointing of God it wasn't just to be poured upon your M natural flesh it didn't come to anoint your flesh it did not come just to anoint your spirit but he comes to anoint your soul how you there my church so the anointing upon your soul will break the Yoke I want to say something to you tonight you see with all of that Glory that I show you but now the real work begins because how can God take an unclean thing a clean thing out of an unclean thing oh can God get us into that perfect State Hallelujah but he promised by this Covenant Hallelujah of Grace brother bam said that this Blood Covenant Hallelujah is perfect the sacrifice is perfect and if that anointing is upon your soul Hallelujah and he he begins that work the work of transformation starts from the soul he anoints the soul in transforming it Hallelujah so the works Hallelujah begins on the inside you know as I break this thing down really he said that Hallelujah spoke up the the three poles Hallelujah you know you know the first pole was good it was good it was good anointing we saw great stuff from it brother John a lot of wonderful works and today people are anointed to do just the same works and it is presented today Hallelujah we saw under the second poll Hallelujah we see great anointing can I say this to you that the first poll was the ministry of Ministry of Christ but it did not produce Perfection What God want is not just a Perfection of an anointing upon your flesh our Perfection of an anointing upon your spirit but he wants Perfection when that anointing hit your [Music] soul so he Hallelujah it was to change that inner man when he came down he came to change that inner man hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God he was to change that inner Man From the Inside Out hallelujah praise God you see when you see these things really you know we have been to churches and we have seen you know we have seen the different platforms where you know there are so many prophets on the in the land today so many anointing in the land today you know Hallelujah but you know it wasn't you see to bring this church in other word what I'm saying to you to bring this it it's not just a work of man's and that will bring this Perfection can I say that again it's not your doing that will do it it's him can I say something to you tonight so if we are going to overcome the age into that Perfection that God is requiring Jesus Christ got to be here hallelujah and he has to be living on the inside Hallelujah to do what to do the works of God to do the works of Redemption on the inside hallelujah praise God so it wasn't meant for the body it wasn't meant for the soul for the spirit it was meant for the soul Hallelujah for God to bring the soul into a position where God can be seated and have the preeminence in the heart hallelujah praise God and I'm saying all of this now as go a little bit further the Bible said in Hebrews 9 and verse 8 the Holy Ghost this signify that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing in other word hallelujah it's going to take the Holy Ghost to break the cycle of sin you see it in our human Humanity really we in our hearts there are things that are in our hearts that nobody knows about it thoughts but about sometimes things comes in and it's evidence that sometime we react to it there are things that are hidden a way that nobody knows about it and to get that Soul into Perfection God had to transform it and to and to nurture it back in in a form where that Soul can reflect Christ in other word hallelujah all that is on the inside he's got to work on the inside to take some of those character that is hidden on the inside and bring forth a Christ character Hallelujah and so the Holy Ghost comes to do what to transform oh my no wonder he says in this H he said behold I stand at the door and knock is knocking at the Hard door because he want to get on the inside because you only can be saved when Christ comes on the inside hallelujah praise God God and when he comes there he comes to live so he want to get to that Soul Church to do what to transform it from what from dead Works to do what to serve the Living God hallelujah oh my and how is he going to transform that Soul he promised that he will Purge it this purging you see why it cannot be just an anointing the prophets were anointed the priests were anointed they were given the position and office to operate but there was a remembrance of the sin every year it means that there was something in their heart H that their hide that was there that nobody knows about it Hallelujah but God comes down the Bible said and he knows the imagination of the heart when he search he search into the heart and he sees the intent of the heart H and he's here Hall to change it to transform it by doing what by entering into it and and pfy it and bring it into its own reflection that is called Perfection hallelujah praise God hallelujah and that's why today we are seeing all this anointing really but the anointing is to go to the soul and to purge the man on the inside Hallelujah the hidden part to in and door the secrets Hallelujah you know sometime it's just just a reality church I have bad habits I have things ways that I I get upset sometimes I I get mad sometimes I I do see sometimes that it's not in my mind sometime I have to go back and apologize why is those thing coming out why why am I having to stop why is this thing Hallelujah why because deep down on the inside there are things there that need to be purged Hallelujah and he's calling to the heart that it must be surrendered to him that's why he came down he came down to do what to bring that Soul into a position where it can be crowned and God has determined that listen that we will overcome Hallelujah but overcoming it does not base on our own works it's him on the inside overcoming doing the work for us now you understand why when Joseph was placed in prison hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't it was a good thing to talk about the dream but I wonder how he felt when he was in prison how you felt when he was accused but God was working on him it was God's work that was to get him into the position that God speaks to him that he will overcome hallelujah praise God Amen praise God Amen I probably just you know are so much thing here but let me get get me just get to some of the main points that I want to get you see it has to take him on the scene you see Jesus was trying to let us know that and said that he just didn't understand why Jesus Keep On he said that you know he keep on refering that the works that I do he said I do it not of myself he said Jesus Keep on refering to that he said it was the father that dwelleth in me because Jesus want to take it completely off the humanity of himself and he want to bring it back to the supernatural God that it was God that was in him that was doing the work you think it was easy to be called be elob and standing there not saying anything you think it was easy that somebody smack you in the face and you walk away it's not easy humanly most of us would respond to it and that's just a reality but God was dwelling on the inside and what did he do he brought a different response than not than just a normal man would have responded right and so Jesus now under the first anointing first Paul Hallelujah he shows the healing and all of that and he shows Hallelujah the discernment and all of that but when it comes Hallelujah to that third pole which is where I want to hit tonight and this is what I'm saying to you you know it not being like on my heart I couldn't sleep because that this has been Regita in my heart really you see as I paraphrases the scriptures there St John 5 Hallelujah in John 5 Jesus said Hallelujah the works that I do Hallelujah let me see if I can find it I have it here somewhere yes St John 5: 19 but Jesus said then answered Jesus and said unto them ver ver I said unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he see the father doeth for what things soever he doeth these thing ought to doth the son likewise in other word he was saying that it's not me it's him it's the father that was doing the work now it is very important that we see that right before he brings in that that that turple Hallelujah that s John 6 anointing of the turple Hallelujah he first declared to them that it's not me it's him Hallelujah and brother Mark we saw that in under that turple Hallelujah there were disciples that were with him people Believers as they were St John 6 hell they follow them they have great anointing upon their life great Ministries at one time they came back with great testimony and said Master even the devil was in subjection to us but great sign it was but when Jesus begin getting to the heart when Jesus begin hitting the heart Hallelujah he said you are clean by the words that I speak unto you he was knocking on that hard door he said that except you heat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you and the same disciples anointed men of God walked away you see this age B Mark is one in pecul it's very pecul because in an in an environment of people Everyone are gathered nobody can differentiate I can't point from here and said brother Mark you will not go or sister Mar you will go brother John you I can't do that but under this anointing in this age that we're living in the god that descended under the revealing of the word is entering into the heart and what he's doing is using the very words and the word that he speak Hallelujah hit the heart and cast the supper reparation Hallelujah in other word what I'm saying hallelujah there will be people who will come will hear and they will walk away from it you know why because of the word that is spoken now what I'm saying to you is very important because I would want to be be the one that separate but go that's not it it's God that is doing the separation and so when the word is preached something Hallelujah must hit home in the heart Hallelujah so he had about 60 disciples there about that walked away Hallelujah and when Jesus look at them you can imagine how sorrowful he must have been in his heart they were with him every time that slept to them he gave them power he did all of this great thing and it was greatly appreciated but now when it comes down to crunch time when it comes down to Redemption of the soul the word must bring a separation and it will because the word will go into the heart to do what to transform it so Jesus was there and he was sing them except your heat my My Flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you in other word you will die and when they heard it they walk away and walk no more with him you can't imagine that walk No More Jesus was watching them throwing down whatsoever they had and shaking their head and said no no no we can't accept this we can what was happening Church you see when it comes to the blessing it belongs to the bride and God will bring the condition of Separation God will bring something in that when they hear it they will walk away from it they said no no no no no we can't take that and Jesus was there watching them and so Jesus turned to the 12 I mean recite all at all time as if you know Jesus was was boasting in saying it but but but I felt his sorrow when he turned to the 12 and said will you also go will you accept the word of God will you allow the word of God to go on the inside and change your life and Peter turned and said Master where shall we go for you have the word of eternal life and you know what Jesus said but have I not chosen you 12 and one of you here he said one of you among the 12 he said is a devil who could have thought that Judas was a devil Judas did everything right in the perspective of the high of man but when the word comes it discerns the heart there's no secret that is hidden from him hallelujah what what what am I saying to you I had something to read you know uh quickly before we close in the book of Jud Judges chapter 7 verse one he said then jabal who is Gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and Pitch beside the well of Abra aod so that the host of the minites were on the north side of them by the hill of Mor in the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the menites into into their hand lest Israel v thems against me saying mine own hand have I saved me hallelujah hallelujah so it's God was saying here listen that listen Hallelujah for this Victory Gideon it's not you it's not the people it's me I am the one that is going to fight your battles for you hallelujah hallelujah verse three said now therefore go go to and Proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead and their return of the people 22,000 and there remain it 10,000 and the Lord said and to Gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and I will try them for Hallelujah for for the for the sake and it shall be that of whom I say unto thee Hallelujah this shall go with thee and I want you to understand that it was God himself that was making the condition it wasn't Gideon anymore it was God and God said and I will say unto thee and whosoever I I say unto thee this shall not go with thee and the same shall not go so he brought down the people onto the water and the Lord said unto Gideon every man that lth after the water with his Tong as a dog lapet him shall thou set by himself likewise every man that bow down on his knee to drink and the number of them that lap oh my putting their hands in into their mouth were three 300 men but all the rest of the people bow down unto their need needes to drink and the Lord said unto Gideon by the by the 300 men that has laed will I save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the the other the people go every man onto his place God set the condition under this turple under this ministry under this time the Redemption that God has promised to bring the church into the perspective Hallelujah God is the one as he's doing it and he's doing it Church by his own word it's one of the most unfamiliar thing telling somebody about Jesus Christ today about the prophet that was sent to us about an anointing that is here in the land and you know what they sit there and they don't hear you you know why because the words that you speaking that's spoken to them it cannot reach the heart so to bring this church in closing tonight to bring this church into the prospective of redemption he promise that he will work on the heart the bride will hear God's voice Hallelujah and God will come and dwell on the inside and God will set the work God will stir the Fate God will bring the transformation God will bring himself out the people of God hallelujah who hear God's word will come forth and live in this end time and by the hands of God hallelujah not the hands of man not just an anointing but by the presence of God he will bring what Hallelujah by his own work the the manifestation of him his own self through the bride to bring us into that position where we can say he's on the scene again Hallelujah so he comes to bring us there Hallelujah because the only way we can overcome this age is when he comes and live on the inside other than that church we be good church goers good people good musician brother Mark we sing and we dance and all of that and church was good you know like in the Pentecostal church I said you know the Holy Spirit came down and we spoke in tongues and the pastor didn't have to preach all of that comes with a time but you know what happened but God has descended in this day to work on the heart of his people to Pune that art and to transform it unto himself God bless you tonight I hope
