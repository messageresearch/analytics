[27:18] right amen
[27:32] may the lord add his blessings to the
[27:34] reading
[27:35] of his word
[27:41] i want to take for this
[27:45] occasion this morning five
[27:49] words and around those five words
[27:53] try to express what's on my heart
[27:56] to you worshipers this morning
[28:00] i want these five words living
[28:05] dying buried
[28:08] rising coming
[28:12] and i think the poet well expressed it
[28:15] in the song
[28:17] of what i want to say when he wrote this
[28:20] song living he loved me
[28:25] dying he saved me
[28:28] buried he carried my sins far
[28:32] away rising he justified
[28:36] freely forever someday he's
[28:40] coming oh glorious
[28:44] day thank god
[28:47] there never was a life ever lived
[28:50] like his because
[28:54] he was the god
[28:58] manifested in the flesh when he was born
[29:02] he was the expression of what god the
[29:05] father is
[29:08] and god the father being loved
[29:12] then jesus was a full expression of
[29:15] love he was loved from the very
[29:19] first time that his little baby hand
[29:23] stroked the pretty cheeks of his
[29:25] mother he was loved
[29:30] and i think today that that's where
[29:34] manny is failing to recognize that he
[29:38] was love
[29:42] god is love and they that love
[29:46] are born of god
[29:50] god so loved the world
[29:54] that is the unlovable that he gave his
[29:58] only begotten son
[30:01] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[30:03] not
[30:04] perish but would have everlasting life
[30:10] he expressed his love when he was here
[30:13] on earth
[30:15] in so many different ways till it is
[30:18] undisputable that he was the most
[30:21] loving creature that ever lived
[30:26] now think in his life here he was
[30:29] expressing
[30:30] god in the only way that god can
[30:34] be expressed to the people is through
[30:37] love
[30:40] and well did he do this
[30:43] when he caught one of the most violence
[30:46] women nectar was of his days perhaps
[30:51] they found her
[30:54] just guilty
[30:58] and no way out when she was found in
[31:01] adultery
[31:02] and they drug her up before him and said
[31:06] what do you say do for her
[31:10] and when he turned to her and said
[31:14] i don't condemn thee going sin no more
[31:19] [Music]
[31:20] instead of being throwing her out to the
[31:23] streets to be
[31:25] drug out like a bunch of wolves
[31:28] or her to stone her and take her life
[31:32] his tender kind naughty heart stoop
[31:35] way down into the sin that she was in
[31:39] [Music]
[31:41] said i don't condemn me
[31:45] just go and don't sin no more
[31:51] and when he was on his way down to the
[31:54] grave
[31:54] of lazarus
[31:58] i think there's another great time
[32:02] that he expressed what god is to the
[32:06] human beings
[32:09] not only is he a god that can
[32:12] forgive the lord's sin that can be
[32:15] committed
[32:17] and take the guilty and make them
[32:21] guiltless by his party love
[32:25] but after death has laid us in silence
[32:30] he's still concerned about us
[32:35] i think he will express that on the road
[32:38] down
[32:39] with martha and mary
[32:42] when he come to the house work death and
[32:45] shut out the life of a lovely person
[32:52] and always roll down to the grave yet
[32:55] being god know that he would raise him
[32:58] from the dead
[33:01] know that it had been told him then in
[33:04] his very
[33:05] words laid the power to raise him from
[33:09] the grave amen
[33:11] yet when he seen martha and mary
[33:14] and those who loved lazarus crying
[33:17] the bible said he wept
[33:21] what was it his great
[33:24] loving heart
[33:28] when he seen that man and his
[33:32] his friends were in trouble he was
[33:35] troubled
[33:36] with them i'm so
[33:39] glad to know that he can be found
[33:42] amongst the brokenhearted
[33:44] praise god in our sorrows he's not one
[33:47] that would leave us
[33:50] he stands by us when all has failed
[33:53] and the last hopes of earthly
[33:57] reaching has come to its end he's still
[34:00] gone and loves us
[34:04] he was the expression of god
[34:09] know how i believe
[34:12] that he longs for his people to be
[34:16] so anointed with his spirit
[34:19] that we could go to each other in trials
[34:23] and in troubles
[34:26] and give the expression of his
[34:29] sympathy as it pours from our hearts
[34:33] that's been
[34:34] burned off his spirit to reflect
[34:38] in the church the love of the living god
[34:45] that will express what he said or the
[34:48] poet said
[34:49] living he loved me
[34:53] he showed what he did to the whole human
[34:57] race the way
[34:58] god represented himself in jesus christ
[35:01] amen
[35:02] he expressed his opinion
[35:07] to the human race to forgive and to
[35:12] love those who were unlovable
[35:18] and i wonder on this easter morning
[35:21] how short we fall apart
[35:25] we can love those who love us
[35:29] but he loved those who did not love him
[35:34] he was the greatest of representation
[35:39] of love that ever hit the earth and it
[35:42] was despised of those who lived on the
[35:44] earth
[35:45] to whom he loved
[35:49] no man could ever love like him
[35:52] and no man was ever hated like him they
[35:58] hated him and despised him and rejected
[36:01] him
[36:03] but it did not stop his love
[36:08] the last one he was hanging on the cross
[36:12] after that life that he had lived
[36:16] had been done nothing but good things
[36:20] forgiving the guilty
[36:23] healing the sick
[36:27] and just things that were good but it
[36:29] was
[36:30] less breaths on the cross with the
[36:34] fire mocking spit of them who stood
[36:39] by hanging from his sacred face
[36:42] he cried with a heart full of love power
[36:45] forgiveness amen
[36:49] for they know not what they do
[36:53] he could understand being
[36:56] god he understands
[37:00] that's why he can love us when we're
[37:01] unlovable because he's
[37:03] god and he understands amen
[37:07] lady he loved me
[37:10] never life lived like it because it was
[37:13] wrapped in love
[37:16] dying he saved me
[37:21] a death when in the garden of eden
[37:26] god jehovah required
[37:29] the penalty our sin is death
[37:35] and there could be no alterations
[37:38] it could not be any other way taken care
[37:42] of because
[37:43] god is supreme and he is
[37:46] infinite and the judge of all heavens
[37:50] and earth
[37:52] the penalty of sin
[37:55] is death
[37:59] and there was no one who could
[38:02] pay this penalty
[38:05] for another for every man though he
[38:09] might die for another man
[38:12] but he was guilty to begin with
[38:15] amen there was none of us that could
[38:18] help the other
[38:20] because we were all guilty
[38:23] we are born in sin shaped in iniquity
[38:27] come to the world speaking lies
[38:32] and there was not a real hope nowhere
[38:37] we were condemned to death by god
[38:41] and every creature that ever moved on
[38:44] the earth
[38:44] was under this condemnation
[38:48] there could be righteous man rise and do
[38:51] great things but
[38:52] he was a sinner to begin with
[38:56] there was only one way for it to be
[38:59] paid that was the death of
[39:02] god himself
[39:05] so god being a spirit could not die
[39:10] but he came down in a body of flesh
[39:13] and expressed himself and a life of love
[39:17] to take
[39:18] all that goodness that he wants
[39:22] amen and give it
[39:25] willingly as a supreme sacrifice
[39:29] that he might take the guilt
[39:32] of the guilty
[39:35] [Music]
[39:38] all of us being sinners
[39:42] and not a way in the world for us to
[39:44] ever be saved
[39:46] he came not only to be seen on earth
[39:50] but he came to die as a sacrifice
[39:56] abel expressed it when he offered
[39:59] unto god a more excellent sacrifice than
[40:02] cain
[40:03] when he brought the little lamb with a
[40:06] piece of
[40:07] grapevine wrapped around his neck to a
[40:10] rock
[40:11] there laid the little fella up on the
[40:13] rock pulled his little chin
[40:15] back in with a rock pounding its little
[40:18] throat
[40:20] and it bleeding and died at the blood is
[40:24] squirting out
[40:26] this little white locks become bathed
[40:29] with
[40:29] blood
[40:33] they will express calvary there
[40:37] when the lamb of god slain from the
[40:40] foundation of the world
[40:43] came to take the place of guilty sinners
[40:47] and was mashed and bruised and
[40:51] and made fun of and died of death that
[40:55] no
[40:55] creature could die except
[40:59] god himself and his bloody locks
[41:02] hanging from his shoulders dripping to
[41:04] the ground
[41:06] express what a horrible thing that sin
[41:10] is when he had to die to redeem
[41:13] man from a life of sin
[41:18] nothing could die like that
[41:21] nothing could stand that death
[41:25] it said that when they pierced his side
[41:29] that there came forth blood and water
[41:34] it's been some time ago i was speaking
[41:36] to
[41:37] someone about this and it was a
[41:41] scientist that said
[41:42] there's only one way that that could
[41:44] have happened
[41:46] and it was not because of the roman
[41:50] spear that he died and neither was it
[41:54] the loss of
[41:55] blood that he died because there was
[41:57] still blood in his body
[42:00] what he died of was not because of the
[42:03] roman spear
[42:05] or the nails that was drove in his hand
[42:09] or the foreign crown they placed on his
[42:12] head
[42:13] but because he died of grief
[42:18] because he came to his home it is
[42:22] unreceived enough
[42:25] he died of a broken heart
[42:28] when he knows the very creatures of time
[42:31] that he had done to redeem
[42:33] had spent his face and he was rejected
[42:37] of man
[42:39] david 800 years before it happened cried
[42:42] the very voice that he cried in calvary
[42:45] my
[42:45] god has now forsaken me
[42:49] what a terrible thing that sin does
[42:52] it separates man from god
[42:57] he was a sin offering that had to be
[43:00] offered for our sins
[43:03] and he was separated from the presence
[43:05] of god
[43:07] sin and separating god placed our sins
[43:10] upon him
[43:13] and he was separated from god and that's
[43:15] why he cried
[43:17] why has thou forsaken me
[43:21] and because he was forsaken and have
[43:24] taken this place
[43:25] and seen his people that he would come
[43:28] to be their
[43:29] savior and to offer them life they had
[43:32] rejected him and he
[43:34] grieved him so though he was so
[43:36] brokenhearted in terms of blood and
[43:38] water the chemicals of his body
[43:40] separated
[43:44] man will never know what that was
[43:47] that's the reason there could be no one
[43:49] else could ever die like that
[43:52] i don't care how much that you could be
[43:55] tormented how that they might put your
[43:57] feet in stocks
[43:59] or saw you by inches or burn you by
[44:01] inches
[44:02] you could not die that death because
[44:05] your makeup's not like that
[44:08] he had to be god he had to be more than
[44:12] man
[44:12] and the faith that god died
[44:17] he died of a broken heart with such
[44:20] grief for the world until
[44:22] a chemical reaction taken place in his
[44:24] body that could not take place in you
[44:27] you cannot suffer like that there's no
[44:30] way for you to have that kind of a grief
[44:33] so there's only one could do it and he
[44:36] did it
[44:37] they're hanging that precious life that
[44:41] knows nothing but love
[44:43] doing good come there between the
[44:45] heavens and the earth
[44:48] lifted up there stripped naked
[44:51] embarrassed think how you'd be stripping
[44:54] naked
[44:55] you were no embarrassment to what god
[44:58] wanted
[44:59] hanging there i know the crucifix has a
[45:01] little thing like they had something
[45:02] around him but they never did that
[45:05] that's just put on the crosser the
[45:07] artist put it there
[45:08] they stripped his clothes from him he
[45:10] had on a rope and they tore off
[45:12] of him and gambled fart
[45:15] he wasn't back to the utmost yet me and
[45:19] god had to stand and sinners spit on
[45:21] these faces
[45:23] yet being the very depths of
[45:26] modesty had to die before the public
[45:30] spit naked
[45:33] such a fact that tuck up on him until it
[45:35] separated
[45:36] the water and the blood
[45:39] no wonder i think the point well
[45:41] expressed it when he said
[45:43] mid-rendering rocks and darkening sky
[45:46] my savior bout is hidden god
[45:50] but the opening they'll reveal the way
[45:53] to heaven's joys and endless days
[45:58] sure you had to do it the veil hung
[46:01] between
[46:02] man and god and that opening veil
[46:06] revealed the way the
[46:09] heavens joyous and endless day
[46:13] cowardly means something means more than
[46:16] we can express
[46:18] sure living he loved me
[46:22] dying he saved me and
[46:25] buried he carried my sins far away
[46:31] it's been condemned now sin has no more
[46:35] hope when he screamed at the cross it's
[46:38] finished sin died
[46:44] that's dead it's
[46:47] done with it's powerless it's lifeless
[46:51] think of it people that send the enemy
[46:54] to human being says
[46:56] damn life is it has no more effect
[47:00] it can't
[47:04] one of the sun shut off its vision the
[47:07] stars will not shine
[47:09] the earth turned black
[47:12] is all being redeemed
[47:16] now it's dead it's buried
[47:20] it's lifeless it has no more life then
[47:22] it must be buried
[47:24] what was buried the body of god was
[47:28] buried
[47:29] for it was a sin offering amen it was a
[47:32] burnt lamb
[47:34] it was buried by the fires of iniquity
[47:38] that sinless lamb that know
[47:42] no sin that god who know
[47:45] no wrong his life has been given and
[47:48] down to set off for you
[47:51] buried he carried my sins far away
[47:56] he must be buried the body the sin
[47:59] offering must be buried
[48:01] that's why many after a while will walk
[48:04] one by one to this pool
[48:07] amen to be baptized in the name of jesus
[48:10] christ
[48:11] why something has taken place
[48:17] that spirit that came out of that body
[48:20] when he screamed his finish has
[48:21] condemned
[48:22] sin in our bodies and we must
[48:26] bury it to be remembered no more
[48:30] i'm so glad that it is when anything
[48:33] it's hid it's out of sight
[48:38] and very he carried my sins
[48:41] far away god can see our sins no more
[48:48] for they are buried there buried were
[48:52] in the sea of forgetfulness
[48:57] think of a sea of forgetfulness
[49:02] god cannot remember them no more because
[49:05] they are both dead and buried
[49:08] amen they cannot be remembered no more
[49:12] they're out of god's memory
[49:16] he was also in this very he represented
[49:19] in the old testament
[49:21] they had two they had a sin offering
[49:25] at the cleansing of the sanctuary and
[49:28] that sin
[49:28] offering was that they've taken two
[49:30] goats
[49:32] and one goat was killed
[49:36] and the other goat had the sins that was
[49:39] placed upon the dead goat
[49:41] put up on the live goat remember jesus
[49:44] was a sheep
[49:47] he was a lamb but in this case
[49:51] he become a goat
[49:54] he was righteousness because he was
[49:58] god the sheep but it become a goat's sin
[50:03] that he might be the sin offering for me
[50:05] in you
[50:08] from a sheep to a goat
[50:12] jesus is representing both the animals
[50:14] both goats
[50:17] for one he died he died for the
[50:20] atonement
[50:22] the second the sins from the atonement
[50:24] was put on the scapegoat
[50:26] and the scapegoat took the sins of the
[50:29] people and went far
[50:30] into the wilderness to bear the sins of
[50:33] the people
[50:34] what was it it was the death and the
[50:38] burial of our lord jesus
[50:41] dying living he loved me
[50:44] dying he saved me buried he
[50:47] carried my sins far away
[50:51] he took the sins of the people upon
[50:53] himself
[50:54] and carried them plumbed down into the
[50:58] lords of hades
[51:01] he was a sin offering he had the sins of
[51:04] the people he died for them and also the
[51:07] sins is placed upon him
[51:08] and he took our sins far away
[51:12] so far that god can never see him no
[51:14] more
[51:16] thank god that oh the church can scream
[51:19] hallelujah for such a savior amen
[51:23] not only is our sins forgiven but they
[51:25] are buried in the same forgetfulness
[51:28] to be remembered no more buried he
[51:31] carried our sins far away
[51:35] no more can they be remembered
[51:39] or they are gone they're out of the eyes
[51:41] of god
[51:42] they are past they're divorced they're
[51:46] put away
[51:47] god don't remember him no more
[51:50] but the church ought to rejoice this
[51:52] morning to
[51:54] know that our sins will no more be
[51:56] remembered
[51:57] they are put in the sea of forgiveness
[52:00] into the grave of beyond
[52:04] any resurrection they are dead forever
[52:07] and forgotten about
[52:09] they are if they had never happened amen
[52:12] dying he saved me but buried he
[52:16] carried my sins far away

[52:29] surely believed among us and they're
[52:32] most
[52:33] surely the truth they're god's truth

[1:06:24] unto
[1:06:25] the life eternal through christ hear our
[1:06:28] prayers

[1:06:37] be strangely warned
[1:06:39] and may they come by the dozens into
[1:06:41] this pool this morning
[1:06:43] this easter morning to be buried with
[1:06:46] the lord jesus accepting
[1:06:48] his sacrifice no matter what church they
[1:06:51] belong to
[1:06:52] or what religious sect they they
[1:06:55] have fellowship with that means nothing
[1:06:58] but how they accepted that sacrifice
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:02] are they confessing that they're not no
[1:07:04] good
[1:07:05] that jesus was the only good one
[1:07:08] and he died for us and they are still
[1:07:11] and he took our sins and buried him and
[1:07:13] we stand alone in him our churches
[1:07:16] cannot bury our sins
[1:07:18] our own life cannot bury our sins but
[1:07:21] christ buried our sins in the sea of
[1:07:23] forgiveness
[1:07:25] god grant them that these things will be
[1:07:27] glorious in our sight
[1:07:29] then tonight lord may you come in the
[1:07:31] power of your resurrection
[1:07:33] and shake this little place like it has
[1:07:35] never been shaken
[1:07:37] may signs and wonders appear
[1:07:41] repeat it like it was a couple sundays
[1:07:43] ago long
[1:07:44] when i'm sick and afflicted was so
[1:07:47] marvelously heated
[1:07:48] we pray that it'll be again the night
[1:07:50] for your glory
[1:07:51] forgive us of our trespasses now lord it
[1:07:54] may this be a real easter for some of
[1:07:56] us a real easter for all of us
[1:07:59] and some of those who have never known
[1:08:00] what the easter blessings was
[1:08:03] may it be today that christ rises in
[1:08:05] their heart
[1:08:06] with a new hope with a new life
[1:08:10] them to calvary for we ask that in jesus
[1:08:13] name
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:38] and then god bless you
[1:08:41] i mean that was good that's uh
[1:08:44] it's my second time going through it
[1:08:47] today
[1:08:48] i was asked to come up and just say a
[1:08:50] few words and kind of you know
[1:08:52] do a bit of a summary of what we just
[1:08:54] heard and i don't want to re-preach the
[1:08:55] sermon but just kind of
[1:08:56] hit a couple of the high points we've
[1:08:58] only been here 40 minutes and
[1:08:59] we don't like church to be short so
[1:09:01] we're going to lengthen it out a little
[1:09:02] bit tonight amen
[1:09:04] i'm just going to read a few quotes here
[1:09:05] i've got four pages 12 minutes 15
[1:09:07] minutes tops and
[1:09:08] and i'll be done so brother brown said
[1:09:11] him and well did he do this
[1:09:12] when he caught one of the most vilest
[1:09:14] women that was there his day perhaps
[1:09:16] they found her just guilty scripture
[1:09:19] says that they found her in the very act
[1:09:21] there's no denying it there was no you
[1:09:23] know he said she said they caught her in
[1:09:24] the very act
[1:09:25] there was no way out when she was found
[1:09:27] in adultery and they drug her up a form
[1:09:29] and said
[1:09:29] what do you say do for her and when he
[1:09:32] turned to her and said
[1:09:33] i don't condemn thee go and sin no more
[1:09:35] instead of throwing her out to the
[1:09:37] streets to be drug out like a bunch of
[1:09:38] wolves over her to stone her and take
[1:09:40] her life
[1:09:41] his tender kind loving heart stooped way
[1:09:43] down into the sin
[1:09:44] she was in and said i don't condemn thee
[1:09:47] just go and sin no more
[1:09:49] now people look at that and and you'll
[1:09:51] you'll get um you know nominal
[1:09:52] christians or even worldly people will
[1:09:54] go to that story and they'll say
[1:09:55] that's the way you're supposed to act
[1:09:57] when you see people caught in sin and
[1:09:59] whatnot
[1:09:59] because what they think is that jesus
[1:10:01] made an exception for that woman
[1:10:03] and he didn't he was the word and he was
[1:10:06] bound by the word
[1:10:07] and so he knew that if her accusers
[1:10:10] numbered two or three
[1:10:12] she was going to be stoned he was not a
[1:10:14] witness to what she did though i'm sure
[1:10:16] he believed
[1:10:16] that she did it and being who he was
[1:10:18] maybe he knew maybe he knew exactly what
[1:10:20] she did
[1:10:21] but the the the the the condemnation for
[1:10:24] her was conditional on there being two
[1:10:26] or three witnesses
[1:10:27] and so what did he do he didn't answer
[1:10:29] her and he didn't answer them
[1:10:31] he just said he who was is without sin
[1:10:34] cast the first stone what did he do
[1:10:35] he dispersed the witnesses and then he
[1:10:38] asked her he says
[1:10:40] where are your accusers is there no man
[1:10:42] here to condemn you
[1:10:43] and she said none he said neither do i
[1:10:46] go your way
[1:10:47] but he said sin no more right he could
[1:10:50] use the word for mercy
[1:10:52] and as long as there's mercy then god
[1:10:53] will use it for as
[1:10:55] long as it's available god will use it
[1:10:57] for that and he was there to bring mercy
[1:10:59] right
[1:10:59] he didn't come for the ones that were
[1:11:01] saved he said i came to find the lost
[1:11:03] it was a place of repentance it was a
[1:11:04] time of redemption and he wasn't there
[1:11:06] to judge at that time
[1:11:07] amen so he dispersed the witnesses and
[1:11:09] he said but don't do it again
[1:11:12] and if you listen to the world today
[1:11:13] they'll just say just say it's okay
[1:11:15] it's okay it's okay but they never catch
[1:11:17] the part where he says don't do it again
[1:11:20] right amen it's a tremendous thing he's
[1:11:22] the word he couldn't deny the word
[1:11:24] and as if they stayed there he would
[1:11:26] have had to say
[1:11:27] moses law says under two or three
[1:11:30] witnesses
[1:11:31] she has to be stoned but with those
[1:11:33] witnesses gone it gave him the freedom
[1:11:35] to say
[1:11:35] here's mercy go your way i won't condemn
[1:11:38] you there's no one else here to do it
[1:11:39] and so
[1:11:40] you're free to go amen he said oh how i
[1:11:43] believe that he longs for his people to
[1:11:45] just be so anointed with his spirit
[1:11:47] that we could go to each other in trials
[1:11:49] and in troubles
[1:11:50] and give the expression of his sympathy
[1:11:53] as it pours from our hearts that's been
[1:11:55] borne of his spirit
[1:11:56] to reflect in the church the love of the
[1:11:59] living god
[1:12:00] you know he just throws in this little
[1:12:01] bit here about what it is to be in unity
[1:12:03] in a body
[1:12:04] and what it means to be a part of a body
[1:12:05] and that's when one part is hurting
[1:12:07] when one part is struggling when one
[1:12:08] part is weak what does the body do
[1:12:10] it sends all of its available resources
[1:12:12] to help build up to help heal to help
[1:12:14] bolster
[1:12:15] that one little thing and whether it's
[1:12:16] your little pinky or whether it's you
[1:12:18] know your heart
[1:12:19] you know a big organ or just a little
[1:12:21] tiny thing if something's hurting the
[1:12:23] whole body knows about it
[1:12:24] and the whole body is sending whatever
[1:12:26] they can do to help that thing out amen
[1:12:28] and that's the way we ought to be
[1:12:29] he says is that what be the expression
[1:12:31] of god's sympathy
[1:12:33] what as it pours from our hearts it's
[1:12:35] been borne of a spirit
[1:12:36] you can't help a believer unless you've
[1:12:38] got the holy spirit yourself
[1:12:39] truly help them oh you can bring them a
[1:12:42] meal and you can pat them on the back
[1:12:43] and you can give them a hug
[1:12:44] but they may need a word in due season
[1:12:46] amen and that's what the spirit's there
[1:12:48] is to give you that unction
[1:12:49] it may be to sit there silently and
[1:12:51] listen and it may be to give a
[1:12:52] correction
[1:12:53] it may be to give a suggestion but we're
[1:12:55] looking for the junction of the holy
[1:12:56] spirit to pour out of us
[1:12:57] and not just sympathy right not just
[1:13:00] sympathy as in oh that's so bad
[1:13:02] right we don't want to keep people where
[1:13:03] they are but we want to be able to lift
[1:13:05] them out of it
[1:13:08] he's talking about about jesus and the
[1:13:09] separation he had to endure he said what
[1:13:11] a terrible thing that sin does
[1:13:13] it separates man from god and he was a
[1:13:15] sin offering that had to be offered for
[1:13:17] our sins
[1:13:18] and he was separated from the presence
[1:13:20] of god
[1:13:21] sin had separated him god placed our
[1:13:24] sins upon him and he was separated from
[1:13:26] god and that's why he cried
[1:13:27] why hast thou forsaken me and because he
[1:13:30] was forsaken and had taken this
[1:13:32] place and seen his people that they had
[1:13:34] was come to be their savior and to offer
[1:13:36] them life
[1:13:37] they rejected him and it grieved him so
[1:13:39] till he was so brokenhearted that the
[1:13:41] blood and the water and the chemicals of
[1:13:42] his body
[1:13:44] separated i don't want to drive too deep
[1:13:46] in this because it was already in my
[1:13:47] notes
[1:13:48] for the next service whenever you know
[1:13:49] the next service i take
[1:13:51] but i want you to catch there that he
[1:13:53] says
[1:13:54] he was separated from god okay
[1:13:57] when we look at jesus that was the
[1:13:59] fullness of the godhead bodily and the
[1:14:00] holy spirit dwelt in him but when he
[1:14:02] went on the cross
[1:14:04] that was no longer in him he died a man
[1:14:08] he had to face this as a man he did not
[1:14:10] have all the power
[1:14:11] and all of the understanding of god with
[1:14:13] him when he went to that cross
[1:14:15] he did that as if you or i went up there
[1:14:17] as well
[1:14:18] in the same strength and the same
[1:14:20] knowledge the same understanding the
[1:14:21] same capacity that we would have
[1:14:23] that's what he went there with he didn't
[1:14:25] have superhuman strength to do this what
[1:14:28] he did have though
[1:14:29] was he had a special body that was built
[1:14:31] just
[1:14:32] for this kind of suffering and to take
[1:14:34] the kind of pain
[1:14:35] and to endure the damage that they did
[1:14:37] to him without dying before he made it
[1:14:39] to the cross
[1:14:40] because we'd have died before we made it
[1:14:41] to the cross right
[1:14:43] he was literally built to suffer and die
[1:14:45] he had a special body made that sinless
[1:14:47] body up to that point
[1:14:49] was made so that it could endure
[1:14:51] everything that they threw at him and
[1:14:52] still make it to the cross without dying
[1:14:54] that way amen but remember
[1:14:56] he was made sin and god cannot dwell in
[1:14:59] sin
[1:15:00] so god had to separate himself from that
[1:15:02] body
[1:15:03] and he had to walk that road completely
[1:15:05] alone
[1:15:06] completely alone and this is one that up
[1:15:08] until that point knew nothing about
[1:15:10] separation from god
[1:15:12] and then he has to walk up without that
[1:15:14] anymore and he's got to go through a new
[1:15:16] experience this is a whole new way of
[1:15:17] being for jesus
[1:15:19] because he's had that spirit on him he's
[1:15:20] known who he was from from a youth
[1:15:23] and all of a sudden he knows who he is
[1:15:24] but he doesn't have anything there to
[1:15:26] confirm it inside of him
[1:15:27] and he is literally walking purely on
[1:15:29] the understanding that he's built up
[1:15:31] through 33 and a half years that's all
[1:15:33] he's got and the commitment to the cross
[1:15:35] and the and the path that's before him
[1:15:36] that's the only thing getting them
[1:15:37] through he doesn't have supernatural
[1:15:39] strength he doesn't have angels hovering
[1:15:40] over him or anything like that
[1:15:41] he's doing it as a man as you or i would
[1:15:43] amen literally he went
[1:15:46] he would have been into sensory overload
[1:15:48] because this was one that was holy
[1:15:50] and righteous and in one fell moment he
[1:15:52] went to
[1:15:53] filthy and sinful and he'd never known
[1:15:56] what that felt like and you know what
[1:15:57] it's like if you do something wrong
[1:15:59] now take that and magnify it by the
[1:16:00] billions and billions of things that
[1:16:02] have happened in this world
[1:16:03] and that was all dropped on him from a
[1:16:05] state of perfection to a state of
[1:16:07] absolute rejection sinfulness filth
[1:16:10] whatever you can think of
[1:16:12] in one moment and boom that would kill
[1:16:13] us that would kill us and yet he's
[1:16:15] walking the road to calvary and he's
[1:16:17] going through all these things
[1:16:18] why because he had to go that way that
[1:16:21] was his plan that was the purpose of god
[1:16:23] was to do that amen but the brahm says
[1:16:26] he had to be god
[1:16:27] and he had to be more more than man and
[1:16:29] to think that god
[1:16:30] died he died of a broken heart with such
[1:16:33] grief for the world until a chemical
[1:16:35] reaction took place in his body
[1:16:36] that could not take place in you you
[1:16:39] cannot suffer like that there's no way
[1:16:41] for you to have that kind of grief
[1:16:42] there's only one could do it and that's
[1:16:44] him he could do it
[1:16:46] amen we couldn't have handled that
[1:16:49] suffering that's what brother bam saying
[1:16:50] there's
[1:16:51] this is a man that handled suffering
[1:16:52] that we could never handle
[1:16:54] and it was a requirement for him to do
[1:16:56] it and he stayed with it and he stayed
[1:16:57] with it and he stayed with it
[1:16:59] he held on to life until he gave it up
[1:17:01] on that cross amen
[1:17:03] i talked before about that rabbi
[1:17:05] remember i said that he looked at isaiah
[1:17:07] 53 and he said that israel that's
[1:17:08] that's that's a description of israel
[1:17:10] paying for their own sins
[1:17:12] but you can't pay for your own sins if
[1:17:14] you're sinful
[1:17:16] it's a it's it's amazing to me that he
[1:17:18] would think that that his eyes are so
[1:17:20] blinded
[1:17:20] and it shows how blinded the jews are
[1:17:22] right now is because it's not their time
[1:17:24] to receive that messiah but they look at
[1:17:25] that scripture and think that their
[1:17:26] suffering is what is described in isaiah
[1:17:28] 53
[1:17:29] and it was an atonement for sin and
[1:17:30] their very law says that you can't do it
[1:17:32] if you're guilty
[1:17:33] that's what brother i'm saying is you
[1:17:34] can't handle this you couldn't have done
[1:17:36] this you can never justify yourself you
[1:17:38] can never redeem yourself
[1:17:39] it had to be a sinless one and this was
[1:17:41] the man that did it amen
[1:17:43] but when it's all done he said sin has
[1:17:45] no more hold when he screamed at the
[1:17:47] cross
[1:17:47] it's finished sin died i never heard him
[1:17:50] say it that way he says sin died
[1:17:52] now it's dead it's done with it's
[1:17:54] powerless it's lifeless think of it
[1:17:56] people
[1:17:56] that sin the enemy to human beings is
[1:17:58] dead and lifeless
[1:18:00] it has no more effect it can't
[1:18:03] no wonder the sun shut off its vision
[1:18:05] the stars would not shine
[1:18:06] the earth turned black it was all being
[1:18:10] redeemed
[1:18:12] that's incredible he says sin died it
[1:18:14] has no effect on you anymore
[1:18:16] that's why paul could sing what say what
[1:18:18] death where's your sting grace where's
[1:18:19] your victory
[1:18:21] because it all died right there the
[1:18:22] effect of satan was made null
[1:18:24] and void when that blood was shed and
[1:18:26] his life was given up and god accepted
[1:18:28] that as a price paid
[1:18:29] fully accepted paid him full there's
[1:18:31] nothing left to do amen
[1:18:33] and now christ is walking around he's
[1:18:35] got those two keys in his hand and
[1:18:36] there's nothing that satan can do about
[1:18:37] it he's never going to get him back
[1:18:39] and that means that he can't do it to
[1:18:40] you either that when you die
[1:18:42] you don't die you just go to another
[1:18:44] place and you have that eternal life
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:47] completely bound amen he said god can
[1:18:50] see our sins no more for they are buried
[1:18:53] they're buried where in the sea of
[1:18:54] forgetfulness think of a sea of
[1:18:56] forgetfulness god cannot remember them
[1:18:58] no more because they are both
[1:19:00] dead and buried it cannot even be
[1:19:03] remembered no more they're out
[1:19:04] of god's memory he said the church ought
[1:19:07] to rejoice this
[1:19:08] morning to know that our sins will no
[1:19:09] more be remembered they're put in the
[1:19:11] sea of forgetfulness into a grave
[1:19:13] beyond any resurrection we look for a
[1:19:16] resurrection in a rapture he says this
[1:19:18] is one thing that you cannot resurrect
[1:19:20] it is impossible to resurrect your sins
[1:19:22] your mistakes your faults your failures
[1:19:24] the things you should have done that you
[1:19:26] didn't the things you did that you
[1:19:27] shouldn't
[1:19:27] he says that can never be resurrected
[1:19:30] and when you bring them up you're the
[1:19:31] one that's fishing in the sea of god's
[1:19:32] forgetfulness amen
[1:19:34] so if he won't remember then why should
[1:19:35] we be walking around remembering them
[1:19:37] why should we be bound by our conscience
[1:19:39] amen when we have committed them to him
[1:19:41] when we've confessed our sins
[1:19:42] when we've made we've we've done the
[1:19:44] fruits right meat for repentance we've
[1:19:46] gone the other way we've stopped doing
[1:19:47] that
[1:19:48] then there's nothing that satan can hold
[1:19:49] over us anymore amen
[1:19:52] amen what do you say they're not just
[1:19:54] dead they're buried
[1:19:55] and that makes satan a liar because if
[1:19:58] god can't remember it
[1:19:59] it didn't happen right he's the great
[1:20:02] recorder he's the great filmmaker he's
[1:20:04] the one that determines what is and
[1:20:05] isn't a reality
[1:20:06] it meant so when satan comes up there's
[1:20:08] nothing to there's nothing to back him
[1:20:10] up there's no film tape left of this
[1:20:11] it's all destroyed
[1:20:12] like i said brother branham went from
[1:20:14] justification means it's as if you never
[1:20:16] did it
[1:20:16] to he said you didn't do it that's the
[1:20:19] effect of the blood it's not as if you
[1:20:21] didn't do it he says you
[1:20:22] did not do it because you are in christ
[1:20:24] you are perfect you are sinless you are
[1:20:26] spotless so you couldn't have even done
[1:20:28] it in the first place
[1:20:29] amen he says what was that raising up it
[1:20:32] was god's receipt that the bill's been
[1:20:34] paid
[1:20:35] rising he justified freely forever oh
[1:20:37] what a savior rising what had god done
[1:20:39] a man can suffer a man can die a man can
[1:20:42] be buried
[1:20:42] but easter was the greatest of them all
[1:20:44] for it was god's endorsement
[1:20:46] my laws has been met my requirements
[1:20:48] been met and that's him
[1:20:51] he says that's the requirement in front
[1:20:53] of you it's not some thing it's a person
[1:20:55] he says that's my requirement and it's
[1:20:57] jesus christ he rose up from the dead he
[1:21:00] said rising he justified freely
[1:21:02] forever blessed be his holy name amen
[1:21:05] christ rising from the dead victorious
[1:21:07] with the keys of hell and death in his
[1:21:08] hand
[1:21:09] and he is the living receipt that he
[1:21:12] was accepted and the price was paid
[1:21:14] fully amen
[1:21:16] amen brother bram said sins are pardoned
[1:21:18] all these sacrifices could have been
[1:21:20] mythical all these sacrifices could have
[1:21:22] failed but on easter morning when he
[1:21:23] rose
[1:21:24] god proved that he accepted it no wonder
[1:21:26] it brings the human heart
[1:21:28] to a hallelujah no wonder it makes men
[1:21:30] stand in the face of death
[1:21:31] you don't face death on just anything
[1:21:34] willingly
[1:21:35] you know when you put men in war in that
[1:21:37] and they'll they'll stand up and
[1:21:38] and the adrenaline will get going and
[1:21:40] they'll find a certain ability
[1:21:42] to do but when you put people up there
[1:21:43] and you put their kids in front of a
[1:21:45] of certain death and these different
[1:21:47] things like they did in the first church
[1:21:48] age
[1:21:48] you don't just do that amen without what
[1:21:52] a reality that's there in your life and
[1:21:53] that's what he's talking about is when
[1:21:55] you have christ
[1:21:56] that's what's going to make you stand in
[1:21:57] the face of death he says it makes the
[1:21:59] people call those things which were not
[1:22:01] as though they were
[1:22:03] why because the price has been paid and
[1:22:05] there's nothing to hold you back
[1:22:07] remember we talked about that store and
[1:22:08] brother brown says everything that's in
[1:22:09] it is yours
[1:22:10] just go walking around just go looking
[1:22:12] in it just go reading it because
[1:22:14] everything you see is yours and you can
[1:22:15] go up and claim it because the price has
[1:22:17] been paid for every single one of those
[1:22:18] things amen
[1:22:20] he says how do you know he has raised
[1:22:24] he says cuz he's risen in our hearts
[1:22:27] justified freely forever amen that's why
[1:22:30] we call the holy spirit our token
[1:22:32] why because it's the very token life of
[1:22:35] christ it's the very same life that rose
[1:22:37] from the dead
[1:22:38] and now we have it within us amen we
[1:22:39] carry our receipt with us every day
[1:22:41] if you have the baptism of the holy
[1:22:43] spirit in your soul if you are sealed to
[1:22:44] the day of your redemption
[1:22:45] you have the receipt with you every day
[1:22:48] every minute every hour
[1:22:49] doesn't matter what happens when satan
[1:22:51] comes in you can just pull that up and
[1:22:53] you say i've got the token
[1:22:54] i've got the proof i've got the receipt
[1:22:56] that says that i didn't do anything
[1:22:58] and no matter what you say no matter
[1:22:59] what you do no matter how hard you press
[1:23:01] i am sinless and spotless and there's
[1:23:03] nothing you can ever do to change that
[1:23:05] amen at the end he's talking about jesus
[1:23:09] rising he said go ye into all the world
[1:23:11] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:23:13] come forth the uttering of his lips go
[1:23:15] you into all the world and preach the
[1:23:16] gospel to every creature
[1:23:17] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:23:19] be saved and he that believeth not shall
[1:23:21] be damned
[1:23:22] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:23:24] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:23:25] evil spirits
[1:23:26] they shall speak with new tongues if
[1:23:28] they should take up serpents or drink
[1:23:29] deadly things it will not harm them
[1:23:31] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:23:33] shall recover
[1:23:34] because i live he says gravitation is
[1:23:37] broke away from me sin had no hold
[1:23:39] i died for you god proved it and gave
[1:23:41] the resurrection receipt
[1:23:43] and because i live you live also someday
[1:23:47] i will return he says that's not just a
[1:23:49] token that the price was paid he says
[1:23:50] that holy spirit that's in you
[1:23:52] is your resurrection and your rapture
[1:23:55] receipt
[1:23:56] right that's proof that you're going in
[1:23:58] it he says the life that you live
[1:24:00] now because of christ in you he says
[1:24:01] that's the very proof that you're going
[1:24:02] to go
[1:24:03] in that resurrection and that rapture
[1:24:05] amen he says i've got the receipt he
[1:24:07] rose how do you know
[1:24:08] he lives in my heart he lives in the
[1:24:11] heart of his believing church
[1:24:13] he said easter is a triumph it's the
[1:24:16] victory that god
[1:24:17] gave over the earth and then they sing
[1:24:19] the role was called up yonder you know
[1:24:21] that role couldn't be called until that
[1:24:24] lamb had died and rose again
[1:24:25] because when you look in revelation what
[1:24:27] what is the one that takes the book
[1:24:30] right it's a sealed book the roll
[1:24:31] couldn't be read it was sealed
[1:24:33] but then a bloody lamb came out as it
[1:24:35] had been slain and they said worthy is
[1:24:37] the lamb and he took the book out of him
[1:24:38] that held it
[1:24:39] and then we see in the next chapter the
[1:24:41] next time we see him that book is open
[1:24:43] and he starts calling
[1:24:44] out the names of that amen the role was
[1:24:45] called up yonder then how do you know it
[1:24:47] was called
[1:24:48] because i'm here and you're here right
[1:24:51] he started calling the names out of
[1:24:52] those different church ages he
[1:24:54] started calling brother mark out of what
[1:24:56] nowhere
[1:24:58] brother brother mark was just walking
[1:24:59] around and all of a sudden what happened
[1:25:01] the role called out mark coffey and all
[1:25:04] of a sudden something happened inside of
[1:25:06] him and now you see here at church
[1:25:07] because god called one man out of it out
[1:25:09] of so many people here
[1:25:11] so randomly almost you know what was it
[1:25:14] the role was being called
[1:25:15] by what the bloody lamb the slain lamb
[1:25:17] that now had the right to take that
[1:25:19] title deed to the earth
[1:25:20] and go back and claim his possession
[1:25:22] amen what a tremendous message 40
[1:25:24] minutes
[1:25:25] 40 minutes i wish i could preach like
[1:25:26] that in 40 minutes
[1:25:29] wow amen let's just stand together if we
[1:25:31] would
[1:25:35] and then he started he talked about he
[1:25:37] says there's no wonder that you can sing
