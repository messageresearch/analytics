far you've taken us Lord we've seen the the separation that you've put in our lives from these things Lord and we can see your love for us but Lord I'm trusting Lord that our lives say that we love you more and more Lord that we love you more today than we ever have Lord Lord that our lives are a reflection Lord of our appreciation Lord our thankfulness Lord for all that you've done for us Heavenly Father Lord may it not just be something we say the Lord above all may be something we do may it be something we live may it be something we show every day or by our words by our thoughts and by our actions Lord God Lord I'm worthy for it but we're so thankful for it Lord God lord and we're praying that we just be vessels Lord that that love didn't just come to Lord but that love can come through Lord that others could see you could receive you Lord that we would give them their salvation Lord by bringing them to the word to the gospel that you've given us Heavenly Father Lord make us fit for service we pray Lord bless us now this night as we hear your word in Jesus Christ's name we ask him amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Second Peter chapter one amen just for every service probably for the next month or so just start in second Peter 1 and we'll probably be there in one one form or the other amen it's good to be in service it was a beautiful day it's nice to get this so late in the season but thankful for the sunshine and the warmth amen I got a chance to go and dedicate brother Chad's new office his new building for his business this week so that was a real honor real pleasure to see God just providing for him that way also we confirm with Brother David Nash the missionary that we've been supporting he'll be here from November 3rd through 5th of this year it'll take three services and I never tell them what to preach but I'll probably ask him to at least take a portion of a service or a service to tell us what he's been doing and kind of share with the church some of the the testimonies and the things that God's been doing through him and and through his ministry there but certainly keep those things Imperial just be him coming up but uh but I'm looking forward to seeing that amen it's a part of the fivefold ministry it's why we support it it's why we appreciate it and men and we just want to to trust that God will use him to be a blessing to us you know it's uh we can't all be missionaries in the way that they are but we can definitely support one and we don't want to ever lose a heart for Souls amen we want to do it locally but we also want to do it around the world and brother Dave has been very faithful to do this he he's just given his life to doing it and we're thankful for that amen second Peter chapter 1 and verse 5 says this and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and as you might imagine we're going to be speaking on virtue tonight and I want to take a title for this service and maybe for the next one Lord willing on a lasting strength amend a lasting strength and we're pressing forward and these attributes of the characteristics of a child of God and we talked about faith for a couple services and then we're going to preach on virtue and we're going to preach on it from two angles because if you've ever listened to the Statue of a perfect man as soon as I start preaching you're going to say that's not the way brother Brandon preached it but brother Branham jumped to the Apex of virtue really and he gets to an attribute of virtue and that's the strength portion but before there comes strength there has to come a foundation from that there has to come a source for those things there has to come A Life That's behind that strength if I could put it that way so I'm going to take the the basic portion which is which is what Peter's talking about here and then we get to the higher portion which is what Paul ends up talking about in a later way as well so we start with this idea virtue if we take it back to the original Greek word it's a word called irate irate it sounds French almost and it means a moral goodness or Excellence of good moral character or uprightness so this virtue starts as a Christian Life a Christian Life by appearance if I could put it that way and they say here that an example of this word Virtue would be modesty modesty or purity so this is something that is certainly something that's going to be shown throughout their life and we hear a lot about virtue and scripture and as I said brother Branham jumps right to that other word but that's a different word for virtue but this word Virtue is only mentioned four times in the scripture and three of them are in Peter's writings one of them's in Paul's writings and I want to focus on the way that Peter brings it before we get to how Paul brings it which is really how brother Branham would talk about it in many other ways so if we go to First Peter SEC 2 9 it says this and this is the first word that mentions this word Virtue or virtues and it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people now you notice that this is very much about appearance and it's about what you do and how you spend your time when we look at priesthoods when we look at a holy nation we look at a peculiar people it's something that is obvious from the outside what you are if I could put it that way okay and he says that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light now that word Praises is an English word but the the Greek word the original word is virtue that you might show forth The Virtue or the virtues of him who has called you out of Darkness into his moderate unto His Marvelous Light so in other words what Peter's saying here is there's a difference in how you act now and how you used to act because when you were in darkness you acted one way but now you're a different way and the way you live now is reflective of a priesthood a royal a holy nation and A peculiar people it's three three things that are combined that show you the virtue that that Peter is talking about here amen so this is we're all born in darkness and whether we're born into this message whether you're born in a Christian home we're born in darkness and that darkness is of the Soul it's a darkness of the Soul you you can be surrounded by the light of this message you can be surrounded by the Light of the presence of God you have holy ghost-filled parents you're in a church with holy ghost-filled people but that's not what we're talking about but we can have the truth presented to us but until the word until that word comes to us and brother Brown says until that word flashes across our soul and we recognize it for what it is and what we res and we receive it for what it is then we're in darkness our soul is in darkness it hasn't been quickened it hasn't been brought to light it hasn't started to produce the the sea Gene of God that's inside of us so knowing what is right is not just the light but living it that's when you know you've really caught the light because you can you can hear it all day long and Nod your head but until it steps into your light it's not truly light to you brother bam says if you believe it you'll do it it's very simple if we go into that amen but the calling of God in our life and our positioning as the people of God the chosen the elect bride of God this called us out these called out ones is putting us in a position to show The Virtue or the virtue issues of God that's what Peter's talking about here and he says it they we call it Praises but he says that praise is really a virtue so let me put it this way the way you live your life is a praise to God the way you live your life is a worship to God the way you live your life is a reflection of the god that you serve that makes it real easy doesn't it because whatever's coming out is going to worship some God whatever is you you do with your life is going to show what influence you're under what you really believe and so the the fruit of your life the way that you live is the virtues of the god that you're serving if I could put it that way Peter would say this just a few verses earlier in verse 5 he says ye also as Lively Stones as living stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so in second Peter 1 he talks about how to be built up in second Peter in First Peter 2 he's saying you are a spiritual house this is what it looks like to be this sort of thing and so he's saying that the people of God are an upright people these are people that that the word flows through that live by the word and it sets them apart and it makes them a different people our choices our decisions our view of right and wrong the things that we would say are are moral absolutes for us are different than this entire world because we're built on an unwavering absolute that does not change based on society that does not change based on laws that does not change based on governments that does not change based on Ministry amen the word holds absolute through all of these things and the world hates an absolute I've said this many times before do you know there are people today that are saying that two plus two does not equal four and they're getting time on the national news and saying it as a valid thought they'll even go so far as to say two plus two equals four is racist that that's the the absurdity that we're facing today now people are smiling about that that tells you how far we've sunk from an absolute when we've made everything a negotiation then nothing's going to work there is no negotiation with God there is no negotiation with God Amen we have absolute positions in our life by the word we have an absolute position on marriage don't we till death do us part right wrong made a good decision made a bad decision until death do us part that that's what we believe amen we have an absolute position on gender it's absolute there is no changing in it I was listening to brother Brown the other day and he says when a man wants to be and a woman wants to be masculine there's a problem it's that simple God divided the literal Spirit of Adam into two portions one for the woman and one for the man physically and they're meant to stay apart because they have a purpose they have a god-chosen purpose and we'll get into this a little bit later as we go amen but we have absolute positions on what's most important in life we live our lives by an absolute and that's that the word takes preeminence in everything and it is the filter for every decision and everything that we do in our life or it ought to be amen if we're a True Believer but watch how Peter lays it out he lists these three things he says a royal priesthood a holy nation and A peculiar people and that word that phrase of royal priesthood means we live a Sanctified life we lead a focused life and we leave us live a set aside life that is in a prescribed manner when you look at the priesthood their days were defined their actions were defined you go read in the Book of Leviticus it is it tells you everything that a priest is supposed to do tells them how to dress tells them how to talk tells them how to play tells them how to sacrifice tells them how to approach God tells them who can approach God when they can approach God what it takes to make things right what it takes to make things clean what it takes to make things holy all of these things a priest is completely prescribed in what he was doing a priest didn't have to wonder about what he was going to do each day or how to handle a situation God laid it out very clearly for them amen and now Peter comes along and he says you're part of a royal priesthood that means you're serving a king not just to God but you're serving a king now and with that priesthood comes what expectations of conduct and behavior it's that simple brother Branham said that the Holy Ghost should not make you do one thing and me do another when it comes to things relating to the word amen we ought to all be living working off the same Playbook amen so with it comes expectations for conduct and behavior and with that also comes an understanding and a knowledge of how to approach God amen it says that you offer we'll get into this ability that we offer what spiritual sacrifices the bride is the only group that knows how to approach God in a way that pleases him much like Esther did we have instant access because the priesthood had access to God in a way that everybody else didn't amen remember brother Brandon would say if God ever did something for someone you can do the same thing get the same thing from God by doing the same thing he says God never changes God never changed we have this idea of an absolute and listen God does not sit back and take our thoughts into consideration God has thought it through God has already decided what's right and wrong what's good and bad what is acceptable and what is not and he trains us he teaches us what is acceptable to him and he expects us to live by those things amen but only the bride can offer a spiritual sacrifice in that day in this day because she is the one that has been appointed to serve him to be with him to be the one that approaches his throne of grace amen why because we've heard a word we've heard a message and we've responded not just with our heads not just with our mouths but we've responded with our lives to align it with what he says is right and what is wrong amen we don't just give him verbal amends amen means so be it that means it has to come into a natural fruition that means it has to step into our lives and when we do that then God knows that our main our amen is truly something that that we believe amen now Peter comes along and what he's saying is you're a royal priesthood so act like it we ought to have an expectation for how we live we ought to be a sanctified people we ought to be a set-aside people amen we ought not to be wishy-washy about how we live that's for sure the world is looking for people that will compromise listen if you want a a person that displays this attribute of virtue the best in the scripture the best I can think of is Daniel because Daniel gets taken into captivity in Babylon and everyone except three of his friends goes to the dark side they start eating the wrong food they start hanging around the wrong people they start worshiping the wrong God they start bowing down to political pressure which leads to them bowing down to an idol all of these things are putting pressure on them and Daniel in all of this does not bow one bit he does not back off he does not take their knowledge or their wisdom but he stays true to the calling and the word of God that he has learned as a young man and he applies it there and in that he is set aside and in that he is blessed and elevated above all because he refuses to compromise he refused to do it nothing would change me man you'll notice when it comes to the priesthood they never went to the people to get approval for how they were approaching God ever ever you do not seek approval for how you approach God if it is by the word then that's what you care about doesn't matter what this world says this world will say sisters you don't have to you can cut your hair you can wear any sort of closes there's no difference between a man and a woman all these different things no no no no you have a way to approach God you've got a way to dress to approach God Amen stick with the word of God Scripture says let your yea be ye and your neighbor yea man don't don't flip-flop based on who you're talking to don't flip-flop based on what the laws come in with listen they're going to bring in laws that are going to make it just about impossible to be a Christian if you want to abide by the law they're gonna do it The Squeeze is coming politically absolutely remember I believe we'll get taken out before that all happens amen but anyways the priest was never trying to get approval from the people because he had to do it the way God said Remember When Aaron's two sons came in and they brought Strange Fire they brought in a way of worship that God had not authorized and God killed them both like that and he said this was so egregious this was so bad you're not even allowed to mourn them you're not even allowed to mourn them destroy them they've been destroyed put them out forget about it and move on and learn a lesson do it God's provided way he's always got a way to to approach him do it his way that's the way that he'll accept amen but that priest worship was to God for the people you start changing it to the way that people want you to do it you have no access to God our worship is for their sake many times to keep us in the presence of God we're literally the blood of Christ to this age as long as the bride's here there's mercy here but as soon as we leave then The Mercy Seat turns into a judgment seat so as long as we are here we are the blood of Christ applied to this world and so we've got to stay right with God so that we can apply the mercy to them so they can step in by grace through our witness through our testimony through our stand and have access to a god that will change him into the same thing that we are program will put it this way he says do you ever realize that God's way is a few goes that way he says and they're despised and rejected because they're not of the world they are of God A peculiar people a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices that is the fruits of the lips giving praise unto God anybody had a person look down on them based on what they believe ever been called old-fashioned oh you know what the best one is narrow-minded you won't you won't consider it you know what happens when you consider compromise every time all they want you to do is have a conversation we're going to talk about conversations a little bit later all they want to do is have a conversation will say we won't Bend we won't bow and you can burn us we don't know what God's going to do you can do what you got to do but I've already done what I've got to do and I'm sticking with what I've got amen amen even if you haven't done it yet there's going to come a day where you speak up and you are going to completely flabbergast somebody that you believe the things that we believe absolutely I had a I had a man in Edmonton and I got to witness to him for for seven hours that day and we had a tremendous time but he said John how can you be an educated engineer and believe in God I said let me tell you and I told him about the supernatural because the supernatural supersedes science we're having a conversation today does science prove truth I said no it doesn't because God can do things that are beyond what science understands what they believe listen you look in the scriptures Philip was transported 200 miles like that yeah Enoch was translated without seeing death they threw a dead man on Elijah's bones and he came to life you tell me how that could be approved by science the word transcends all science Our Truth is not on the knowledge of man because it's constantly changing it's constantly upgrading it's constantly learning God already knows it and he controls it all and so we're not going to go by what somebody thinks today is the right thing because they thought that was the wrong thing yesterday or last year or the last decade or the last century whatever it might be they're constantly changing but God doesn't do that God is a closed-minded God if I could put it that way brother Bram says he he knows everything and it's right the first time therefore that's why he's unchanging and if as a Believer we've caught the true revelation of the word then we are close-minded as well we are close-minded to everything remember brother Bram said a wife is closed to the seed of any man but her husband and that's what it is because remember the mind is the is the what it's the womb to the soul amen that's why you block it here so it can't get down inside of here God doesn't consider Society God doesn't consider social norms these days or anything like that he's already declared what is right and he expects us to stick with it amen now people aren't going to like what we have to say and today if you say something is wrong then they say you hate us and you can't help people getting offended but let's not let our attitudes be the orphans amen we don't have to be confrontational we don't have to be rude listen we're in it for their souls we ought to be in it for their souls not to be right but we're in it so that they can receive what we've got him and that's the right approach for these things and if we make fun of people if we put them down if if we we we take away the humanity whatever it is we're not doing them any help and we're not doing our testimony any help listen as Proverbs 18 19 says this a brother offended is harder to be one than a strong City and their contentions are like the bars of a castle now you say they're not a brother how do you know they're not a brother hey Saul wasn't a brother until he was Paul and he was a brother in an instant listen God can get a hold of somebody let's not let our attitude be the thing that holds him back mother brother Branham said that your attitude could determine somebody's Eternal destination you can't determine the Eternal destination of a true son or daughter of God because they're going to be there no matter what but there are people that will make it by choice and that choice can be related to how you treat them and your attitude towards them amen we've got a responsibility and we could literally hold somebody back from eternal life just by making our attitude wrong remember Paul said this to Timothy it's a good lesson to learn as a young man or a young woman it says in the servant of the Lord must not strive you're not there to battle you're not there to fight you're not tried there to try and win the fight for yourself he says but be gentle unto whom all men that means everybody he says apt to teach and patient my wife and I we we comment about this and brother Tim was here and I was asking him so many questions and you know what he never got frustrated with me we talked hours after hours after hours and and late into the night sometimes and he was always patient with me always patient I appreciated that now can I do the same thing with somebody that is relatively as ignorant or somebody that is just pure ignorant towards me and the things that we believe can I be apt to teach can I be patient with them it says in meekness remember what meekness is meekness is what having power to destroy but having character not to there are times where people do things and you could pin them to the wall but you're in it for them not in it for you and because of that you forego the power to give them the truth amen instructing those that oppose themselves they're doing damage to themselves their thought their their the way they're handling things the way they're looking at things is damaging to themselves and they don't see it that's what you're trying to get them to see is that you're hurting yourself you're not hurting me you're hurting yourself it says what if God prayer Venture so if by some chance God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will so they're trapped and our attitude is the very thing that can determine if they get out of that trap or not our attitude not our words our attitude you'll see here he addresses our attitude not our words we got the right words how do we approach the situation how do we approach the person amen the way we handle people ought to be completely different from the way the world does because we ought to be in it for them not for us not to give them something they didn't earn not we're not we're not getting into that sort of thing but to take them to a gospel that can free them from where they are because that's what he did for us amen brother Brian would say this he said God's people is never that's an absolute never to act like the world or look like the world or be anything to do with the world never act never look never do it be anything to do with the world you are a separated people the church a called out A peculiar people a royal priesthood a holy nation all together different and set aside and all your actions and habits and ways from the things of the world they know I was I was studying this and you know something that jumped out of me and I'm going to get a little pastoral this evening but as a warning not as something I see here but I'm not seeing this in the church here but you know what I'm seeing so much around this message who's being affected by this young men used to be we focused on the women but you know what's happening now is it's it's it's twisting and it's trying to get young men into this place where they're starting to act more and more like the world and you're finding it's getting a lot harder to find a good husband because they're being drawn into the world and they're getting drawn up and and tied into the things of the world I'm seeing trendy haircuts left right and Center listen we don't all have to have our hair parted to the side we don't have to nothing said that you know brother Brown talks about a man putting his hair down the middle he says I thought that looked kind of nice but we are not to be changing our hairstyle every year based on what is trendy they're buying designer clothes they're buying 500 sneakers they're starting to wear all kinds of jewelry they've got all the latest toys and Technology they're very active on social media where is this coming from that ought not to be in the life of a true Son of God it not ought to be in a daughter's light a daughter of God's life either but you know what if the men do it the women will take it twice as far so I say God let those men get the Holy Ghost that'll take them out of that so that they're not looking for what somebody online to approve them but say what does God think about me because that's what an online life is all about is getting what the what approval of somebody that doesn't affect you day to day it's just shallow approval it means nothing it costs nothing and you'll find that they give it back and forth back and forth but there's no change that comes through those things amen I say what's driving us to make our lifestyle mimicked out of the world what's the influence it ain't a royal priesthood that's on Instagram all the time the anti-royal priesthood that's on social media all the time it's not a the royal priesthood that's posting selfies of what they're doing all the time in videos and these things that's not it because a priesthood is focused on worship not on appearance amen like I'm saying we don't have to all dress the same way we don't have to look the exact same way I'm not saying that but I'm saying if we're chart if we're if the changes we see in our appearance in life mimic those of what the world is doing then we got a different we got something else that's influencing us amen and I say that by Grace we don't see it today in our in our in our church and our young men are maybe a bit too young for some of those things but we don't see it in our young women either and I praise the Lord for that I praise the Lord for that we've got young sisters that can hold themselves apart from these things amen but let me put it this way if your inspiration to do something comes from the world throw it away because you can't get something pure from a dirty fountain you can't do it you have to start with purity not purify you can't purify this world the only thing that purifies this world is fire and you know what Holy Ghost Fire if you go back into uh and I forget if it was I think it was in numbers Maybe that that anything they took in Canaan had to pass through the fire to be usable why because if it was an idol when it went through the fire it'd go to gold it'd go to the base material it would have no value other than the material you couldn't worship something that made it through the fire that's the way it's got to be in our lives it's got to go through the Holy Ghost and guess what the Holy Ghost does not take what this world has and then massage it and and shape it up a little bit and present it as something that's holy it doesn't work that way you can't start with a with a with a polluted Fountain and come out with clean water that's not the way these things work amen that's what the world did the world went out and they saw how to speak they saw how to present they saw how to do these things and what you end up with is a Hillsong church or a Bethel Church in these different things and they saw that what if you brought a program and you brought an approach then you could get people in and you could turn them into people that sit on the bench in the pews of the church rather than convicting and converting them they got away from the original gospel and they got into programs that worked oh they worked all right to make you what twofold more a child of hell a religious spirit sitting in a Pew in a church amen you can't do it to music you can't do it to preaching you can't do it to prayer you cannot start with an influence that's outside of the word of God and then make it conform to it listen I've seen churches today and literally these are some of the better known churches in America and they're using Disney themes including costumes for their Series in their Church so we're doing one on manifesting time you know what they're doing a Disney theme where the pastors plural the man and a woman dress up in Disney themed costumes to present their messages in place that's how far they've sunk how silly is that you say how could they ever think that that's of God that's where they've gotten is they think that that works more than the original gospel let me put it this way they're satisfied with the results they get from that and that's why they don't change you can't draw a natural influence from the world and get a supernatural result that's the simple truth brother Brown says this he says why do you want to wear clothes like that he says now I'm talking to you women because I see you letting your kids on the street act like that and you yourself are so mama what happens when daddy's not away does the does the standard slip when Daddy's Gone to work when daddy's away for a few days he says what in the world do you want to wear clothes like that for I don't care how much religion you're supposed to have that shows in your heart what's coming out that shows exactly what you're made out of why he says you deafened your ear to the real Gospel of liberation you haven't been set free yet you haven't been set free there's something still has a hold on you and that's why you do it and that's why you let your kids do it is because you haven't been freed from it yourself listen the wives of the greatest reflection of the husband and you'll see that go right down through to the kids and sometimes the reflection in the wife is a husband hasn't hasn't defeated something and sometimes what's in the kids is that the mother hasn't defeated anything either you'll see it play on through because she has to allow it because she's allowing it in her own life he says you are marked by the Antichrist acting like him and the fruits of your life proves what you are now then he says and you men because you let her do it it shows who your God is brother man would always take it back to the man of the house buck stops with us men husbands fathers the buck stops with us everything that happens in her house it it's our it's our responsibility whether or not we know it it's still our responsibility because it's our responsibility to know it amen we've got to stay connected we've got to know what's going on in these things he says it shows who your God is and shows what you've done that's gospel that's the word now who has got the mark of the beast he said it's so close that it would deceive the very elective possible can't you see friends at apple trees bear apples pear trees bear pears what in the world does a woman that's supposed to be a child of God want to dress like that it's because that down in your heart he says trying to hold it over with the religious crust he says you've listened to the devil you got a reason you've got an excuse you've got something that says this is why I do it but he says it's just a religious cross that's covering up the fact that you listen to the devil somewhere he says that's right and maybe your pastor is guilty for not telling you the truth that's right God help us to speak the truth amen like I said I'm not seeing this here by God's grace by God's grace and I I had this in my notes and I struggled whether to bring it but you never know who's listening and guess what as fathers I'll speak to the fathers and husbands we got to be aware of what's going on in our house and we've got to be responsible for what's going on our house and our lives ought to be what an example of what's supposed to be happening in our lives amen amen don't ever take a worldly idea and try and spiritualize it don't ever do it it doesn't work get your inspiration from the fount of life amen that's where we want to get these things like I said churches doing Disney themes and and costumes and plays to try and bring people to Christ how the mighty have fallen amen the other thing of a priesthood is that they were the only ones that could eat the showbread in the temple and eat the Manna in the presence of God that's the only ones that had access to if they had access to a feast they had access to a bread to to the bread of life that only a priest could touch the laity never got it and yet Peter comes along and he says we're all royal priesthood it's not just brother John it's not just the the fivefold ministry that gets the taste of this bread of life but now we all have access to it and he says your access to the word proves that you're a royal priesthood because only the royal priesthood had had access to that what that bread of life that was a manner that never went bad so one of the greatest Miracles you could see is that until Christ died there was fresh Manna in there year after year for thousands of years it never went away it never rotted it never ran out every year if you were the high priest you got to go in and you got to taste of that manna is a supernatural thing and now today you get to taste of that Manna every single day because the veil has been torn and Christ the word has been revealed to us and now we've got access to that amen he says what you're chosen and elected to taste see understand and experience things that the rest of the world can't even comprehend that's where you're sitting today then he would call us a holy nation and what does that word holy mean it means dedicated to God and set aside for service to God Brother Brad would say the word holy and this this is confirmed by many others the word holy in Hebrew is the same word as Sanctified in Greek so holy and Sanctified are two things that are that are synonymous but the very definition of Holiness comes through its attachment to God in other words God determines what sanctification looks like God determines what holy looks like God determines what can be holy and what is Holy and what makes something holy it's a definition that rests in God and not in man so I I could say that this is a holy suit it's it's blue and it's I wear a white shirt and I wear a copper tie and it's a holy soup because I'm a preacher and I'm doing the things of God no I don't get to say that but if God says a preacher wears a blue suit with a white shirt and a copper tie now it's a holy soup because he said that it's a holy suit I don't get to determine it he gets to determine it so Peter says you're a holy nation you're holy because God said you're holy but we'll get into why we're holy in just a minute amen but the right thing has to be used the right way for it to be holy because you take what people are doing this word they're using a holy bible to do a lot of Unholy things like using Disney as an example in their Church the Bible's still holy but they're using it in a holy way and what do they do they pervert it with their own thoughts and ideas you can't add to it you can't take away from it you got to take it the way it is for it to be holy amen otherwise it becomes a perversion brother Brown says it this way he says we want to be so big we're some kind of a big turned around caller some kind of close you know that makes us look so holy and reverent there is no Holiness with us we can't be holy Holiness is of God see certainly it ain't a holy church it ain't a Holy Mountain it's a holy God that's right not a holy people a holy God it's God in the people Peter referred to the Mount Transfiguration as the holy Mount but it meant the holy God was on the mountain it was a holy God there the presence of God is what made it holy he said it's the presence of God in our midst now that brings Holiness brings Holiness you know not have the the nature of the characteristic of Holiness but it's the presence of God that makes you holy he says it's not my Holiness not yours but his Holiness his presence is what brings the Holiness we ought to Humble ourselves cover ourselves in reverence and humility and say Lord Jesus receive me into your kingdom he says it's his Holiness not ours now let me read this is one of the most beautiful quotes tonight he says the beauty of Holiness is where God dwells it's a different standard and it's not that you can do something but when God dwells with you when God's presence is with you that makes you holy and there's a beauty that comes with it and this is a whole different Beauty standard than what this world has you know tall skinny legs whatever whatever you want to go to this is not it the the beauty of Holiness is the presence of God in your life producing Christ that's what it is short tall fat thin ugly beautiful does not matter the beauty of a church is in the character of the people and the beauty of Holiness is shown in the character of Christ that's produced in each and every one of us amen then he says we're A peculiar people that were peculiar we say that means weird strange different you know what the word peculiar actually means it means valued property or treasure so if somebody says you're peculiar they're actually giving you a very nice compliment but we've switched it today to peculiar meaning like I said uh weird or strange or odd or different or these different things and none of us by choice would want to be known as peculiar you wouldn't want to be known as The Peculiar one in a group would you because that would set you aside that would make you different from everyone else it would make you the oddball brother Brian would preach the Oddball remember every believer is an oddball we might match in certain ways to the world because we just are what we are we're humans we dress a certain way in these different things especially for us men we can look just like it but there comes a point where that oddballness comes out and people realize he ain't what I am he doesn't think the way I think he doesn't talk the way I talk he's an oddballer she's an oddball in these different things right now we've touched a bit on this already and I don't want to beat it to death but this idea of being separated or differentiated from the world and the and the things of the world but I want to share just two quotes with you and then we'll move on brother I would say this he says they don't want to act any different than what they always act but when you become a Christian you are a peculiar person a royal priesthood a strange Nation odd people do odd things and strange things he says in their Unbecoming to the world if the world is giving us accolades all the time we're doing something wrong now I'm not talking about work ethic no no I'm not talking about dedication but there comes a point where we do things and people say you're odd I remember I was at a Christmas uh celebration of Christmas party at work there back in Edmonton and and everybody was drinking except for me and my wife of course and I was talking to one of my engineers and he said yeah you know I I don't like I never liked the taste of beer I said so why are you drinking it he said well it's an acquired taste I said why would you try and enjoy something you don't enjoy naturally he said because everybody does it you go someplace you go to an event everybody's drinking and so you stand out if you don't do it so he said I learned to drink it I learned to enjoy it he literally forced himself to take something into his body that was distasteful to him for the sake of acceptance fit in brotherbraham says no no what you're doing is you're Unbecoming to the world he says and you're when you're in the world you're Unbecoming to God one is vice versa from the other what makes you act like they do in heaven the other makes you like they do on Earth so you're going to be peculiar here you're going to be peculiar there you're going to fit in one way one time I'd rather be out of place here so I can be in place up there I want to fit in at the marriage supper of the Lamb amen I want to know who's sitting around me and why we're friends and why we're Believers and why we're all together brother John Andes was literally reading the same scripture that I I've read here about a royal priesthood yesterday and he shared this this quote with me with with a number of people he says he doesn't want us to be fashioned like the things of the world he wants us peculiar set aside he said I don't mean now to be silly as we call it you know what he means weird for the sake of being weird don't don't just stand out to try and let people know you're a believer be real be sincere but don't try and make it obvious that you're a Christian just to let people know you hang around long enough they'll know and it'll be much more natural and it'll be much much more easy to have a discussion or or to test you know give a testimony or share these things he said he says don't don't don't don't don't be silly he says I mean to be a called out people oh a blessed holy nation living lives that's above reproach he says acting behaving ourselves just like he would working in us for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works then he would say this he says we need a cleaning up all the way from the public Plum to the janitor he says no wonder that's right no wonder this laodicean church is lukewarm he says lo I stand at the door and knock lay it a scenes we can still shout we can make a little noise but what goods the noise if the life doesn't compare with it and then your praise ought not to exceed your testimony is what he's saying Peter's saying The Virtue you've got has to be something that can be shown it's your identity as a people dedicated to God and that means you can't look like anything that this world has to offer you can't conform to it you can't mimic it you can't mirror it you can't do anything it has to be a reflection of the word of God and out of this virtue comes praise and glory to God that's what it is the virtue we're here is for him it's for others not for ourselves and that's what you'll find as we're talking about the Statue of a perfect man is you really start with things that are internal and then God uses them to become external they develop you and then when you're developed then he can use you to help develop others help grow others help feed others help encourage others so uh you know all these different things he can put you into use the first thing is to make you ready so that you can be used amen but we want to see how we get this virtue we want to see brother John we're talking about virtue how do I get this kind of virtue where we're talking about moral living we're talking about uprightness we're talking about living by the word now Peter will put it this way he says according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue so it's what it's the divine power of God it's the working of God as we said before the statue of a perfect man is absolutely a working of the holy spirit with us it's the tutoring of the holy spirit it's the Willing it's the presence it's the the the the the dwelling of the Holy Spirit around us it's an anointing around us that's drawing the word out of us it's pulling out of us the attributes that are in that seed of God that are inside each and every one of us it's inside of you and it's drawing it out it's the working of God and this takes the power of God it takes the life of God takes the presence of God to pull these things out of us amen how are you going to live what kind of life that pleases God unless you're taught how to do it you've got to be taught how to do it that's why we have the preaching of the word that's why we have the reading of the word the hearing of the word is to what to draw us into these things and we'll read a quote where brother Brown would say this very thing he says that's why you come to church that's why you come to church is to learn how to live right to learn what God expects us to do and then we have to make a conscious choice for those things amen so virtue is about this moral Excellence or uprightness and we see that with job maybe above all others in the scriptures and Job 1 1 it says what there was a man in the Land of Oz whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright in other words he had virtue and one that feared God and issued evil now we don't use that word issued anymore because we've got much easier words it means departed turned away from or removed himself from evil so you'll find that virtue is evident in being applied when evil is being issued when evil has been turned away from when evil has been pushed aside when evil is being departed from that means virtue is being expressed inside of your life and this is really a portion of repentance amen and it's a conscious decision to say I'm going to do what the word says you'll find that what we're talking about because faith is something that's inside of you but you'll find that virtue starts with your mind first you have to decide I'm going to do it you have to make a conscious decision to these things amen everything we have the things we look at on our phones or computers the way we spend our time the way we spend our day the things that we dwell on all of these things are conscious decisions and Satan has five inner senses and five outer senses that try and influence our mind to do the things that he wants us to do what's he trying to do get us off the path that leads us to Christ let us out get off the path that leads us to eternal life and all we've got to do is come to the place where we recognize it and then say consciously I'm not interested I'm not interested that's the first thing the scripture says resist the devil and he will flee from you so remember the greatest battle ever fought is up here and if you're going to do right it starts here if you're going to do wrong it also starts up here remember Brandon would talk about a man that would go and commit adultery with his wife I already did it in his mind before he did it in real life the sin started here so Eve sin started here before she ever committed a fornication it starts here and so virtue starts with a conscious decision you know it has the greatest expression of virtuous decision making in the scriptures Joseph had had some of the greatest virtue we'll ever see Joseph's method for dealing with temptation was it was perfect because remember his master's wife came to him she tried to seduce him if you read the scriptures the first time Joseph says no and here's why you're allowed to have that conversation somebody wants you to do something somebody wants to introduce you to something somebody wants you to try something you get to say no and here's why he says your ma your husband my master has given me Authority in his house over everything except you how could I do that to him you're his wife I will not touch you and then after that when she tries to seduce him again he never says a word he uses his feet for discernment and he gets out of there he gets out of there he does that say I done told you once I done told you twice stopped he left the scripture says he ran she laid hold of him and he ran he didn't stop and have a conversation he got out of that room to where he would be safe struggling with something maybe it's because you keep having a conversation with it turn and walk away Paul would say this to Timothy Timothy's a great one young people you want to you want to know how to live your life read Timothy Timothy was a young man coming into Ministry Paul Was preparing him for a life of service and Paul would say this he says flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness Faith charity peace and with them with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart Paul's me speaking to Timothy he was a young man but let me say today this ain't just for a young person this is for all of us but Paul would say flee youthful us because if you don't defeat it as a youthful us it becomes an adult lust and let me tell you it's way harder to kick an adult loss than it is a youthful lust because as an adult you have time you have money you have privacy you have choices you have options that you don't have as a young person amen parents that's why we protect our kids so that they can defeat these things before they get the chance Satan gets a chance to really get his hooks into him there's things I had to defeat as an adult because I didn't flee them as a youth because I didn't defeat him as a youth and they're way harder to beat as an adult because that demon grows up into a big demon a strong demon he becomes a strong man in the house and you get addicted or you get calloused you get addicted or you get callous an addiction means you give excuses and callous means you don't even realize you got a problem you're so used to it you're so hard into it it's just an accepted part of your life and then what it takes is the word to come along and say you ought not to have that and not only that but I can free you from it if you'll just let me do it God comes along and he offers you an opportunity to be free of whatever's been holding you up that's tough as an adult it's so much harder to humble yourself it seems as an adult it's so much harder to confess I got a problem it is tough it's very tough beat it as this young person so you don't have to deal with it as an adult takes God to come along it's like a chained animal brother Brian would talk about that Crow remember that was chained to a post and it was on its foot and so that Crow could only go so far and so it wore a circle into the ground because that's as far as the chain would go and when the chain came off that Crow never flew anywhere because it was so used to its binding don't get to the place where you can't fly because you've been bound so long a man gets set free while you still have a desire to fly and you you do these some of these things you try some of these things it's amazing what we see you know living in Vancouver the drug problems they have there and people I don't know how they get it I wouldn't know where to go if I wanted to get a hard drug but people try it once and they're hooked for life and it destroys their life it destroys their marriage it destroys their family it destroys their finances destroys their career one hit of these opioids that's going around or it kills them it literally destroys their life one thing and you can't forget it once you've tried it once you've seen it once you've heard it once you've tasted it once you've tested it you can't forget it the memory is there forever it's the hardest thing to forget is something you've done or seen that you ought not to have done or seen beat it while you're young adults let us set an example Amen Let Us set an example for what not to do for what to keep clean from but also to show how to get clean how to repent how to be honest about the things that we're dealing with and let God take them out of our Lives amen I'm proud of our young sisters here we've got Selena and Justine and they go to work and they hold their standard and they they testify and they share the things of God and they're not they're not ashamed to talk about the things that we do as a church and as Believers in what God's done in their lives and and all of these different things but let me tell you there's a reward that comes with how you're being raised and how you've been raised and that's that you don't have the scars and the bruises and the lumps that come from Satan getting his hooks into you as a young person you don't have to deal with what young women are dealing with today and it's a wonderful thing and we don't always appreciate it I know that as a young man I didn't always appreciate the protection of my parent or my parents but it was for my good and I'm glad today that I can stand here and I don't have a lot of those things in me that people have had to deal with it's the grace of God that we have those things but you know as I was studying this I said you know we're talking about Temptation and we're talking about things that Satan's trying to put into your life but Satan attacks us in many other ways he doesn't just come with temptation but he comes to us with oppression he comes with us with sickness he comes with us with thoughts amen he'll come after your health he'll come after your mind he'll come after your peace he'll come after your rest he'll come after your joy your satisfaction your contentment he'll come after all these things Satan is a destroyer and a Tormentor nothing good comes out of what he does he can't help it brother Graham said this he says as I said a while ago to a young lady just drive down a post she was dealing with something he said just drive down a post right there in your mind and say on this platform tonight the prayer of faith was prayed for me it says and Satan the blood was put between you and me you've ever heard that song he can't cross the bloodline he can't cross a blood barrier you plead the blood he cannot cross it you put it under the blood he can't bring it out it's gone he can't bring it out only you can bring it out so don't you bring it out but don't let him bring it out he says you might as well go you come up to that post and say uh what's he saying he's saying you come and you rest on that experience you come rest on that promise you come rest on that prayer of faith and you say it's under the blood and I'm Healed I'm delivered I'm saved I'm filled with the Holy Ghost whatever it is you stand there and say uh-uh you can't cross past this point I've laid a stake here I've driven a post here and you can't dig it out he says here's a symptom comes you say he says don't punch at it don't punch at it don't punch a snake what's the worst thing you can do with a snake put your hand near its face because you're going to get bit you don't punch a snake he says just keep saying he says or just keep saying I rebuke you I rebuke you he says he will bite you see just ignore him walk away from him so he's defeated anyhow so there you are walk away from him because he doesn't have anything to say to you that you want to hear say Don't just punch it just don't punch it and say oh Lord rebuke him rebuke him ah don't do that see you're weakening what you really believe see tearing down your faith he's saying you do believe you really do believe so don't weaken your real Faith by having the conversation you're a Believer and you have believed so don't have the conversation because that never helps your belief having a conversation with doubt does not increase faith stand let him know he's not in he's not allowed to be there and then walk away if that happens up here you got to know who's talking to you you got to know who's talking to you I battled some things this week things kept coming up in situations and I'm about to preach on it and I had to realize this ain't God this is Satan trying to get me down trying to get me to look at circumstances trying to get me to look at people rather than what the word of God says so I had to literally stop and say I ain't thinking about this I'm going to think about the promise I'm going to think about Grace I'm going to think about Mercy I'm going to think about what the word is giving me as an option rather than what the circumstances are that you're telling me about constantly amen but this way we live there's a virtuous way to live there's a virtuous way to dress there's a virtuous way to talk there's a virtuous way to make a living there's a virtuous way to interact with people and we're supposed to live that way but if you look in the Bible that word virtuous is only mentioned four times the word Virtue is mentioned four times and the word virtuous is mentioned four times and every single time do you know who it refers to a woman every single time it mentions a woman one of them is Ruth and Naomi says everyone knows that you're a virtuous woman why she acted her life reflected virtue and then all other three times are in Proverbs and it refers to a wife you know what that tells me you sisters are the epitome of virtue God has in his word said that women are the greatest reflection of virtue that he has because why the Bride is a reflection of The Virtue and character that Christ expects he chooses her based on her character and so you Sisters You wives you mothers are the greatest attributes of virtue that God could find and he has literally placed you in the word as the epitome of the greatest expression the Apex of virtue is a virtuous woman you know what that word virtuous means wives mothers listen up a virtuous wife a virtuous woman is strong mighty able efficient wealthy a force and an army that's what God says you are I thought I'd get an amen out of that that's what God thinks about you sister Leah sister Blanca sister Amber sister Maureen sister Brenda that's sister Betty back there God thinks you are strong able Mighty efficient a force to be reckoned with an army and he thinks you're wealthy I say hallelujah I love it when God tells me what he thinks of me but this is for you sisters tonight amen I'm getting ahead of myself we're getting into the next service because we're going to talk about Sarah and these different things but it just just jumped out at me when you are producing The Virtue that Christ expects what does it do what does it produce it produces a life that can live the word in a way that benefits people around you because it would say of that wife it says you know there's women that do well your daughters do well it says but thou excellus them all you're better than every one of them there's people that do well there's people that try but you do it better than anybody else can do it you're the best of the best you are the Elite you are The Virtuous bride I was listening to brother Aaron McGeary just briefly today he was talking about this and he referenced First Corinthians 11 7-9 it says the woman is the glory of the man I'm not doing this to prop the men up but I'm putting it as a type because what the expression of the glory of God is in the bride and so you women are the literal reflection of what the bride of Christ is your reflection of the attribute one of the greatest attributes that can be in a Believer is that a virtue is the strength to what produce something that helps those around you that virtuous wife you look at in Proverbs of what that virtuous wife does she is a machine I'm glad I'm not a woman because you look at what she does she gets up before it's light and she goes to bed after it's dark and she's planning and she's arranging and she's making clothes and she's buying this and she's selling that and she's making sure everyone's clothed and fed and warm and this and that and the other thing hair comb for church good clothes on everything is set in order everything is run she knows what she's doing she's got it all in hand she's a force to be reckoned with she's like an army that's what happens when the virtue of Christ is shown through you you become something that can't be stopped you're an Unstoppable Army there's a reason why brother Brown calls a mother The Fifth Gospel you have access and to a to a people your children you get access to something that is so precious to God and he literally gives you the majority of your time to produce them and draw them into service and draw them into a life as a believer brother Ryan would talk about the three sacred trusts for a woman how you handle yourself how you yield yourself and how you express yourself and you sisters are the embodiment of what he's talking about this virtue that we're talking about I want to finish it with one one last thought on virtue this evening and this is Paul's thoughts on it and he would talk to the Philippian church about virtuously he talked come at it kind of from the way of how we think Paul understood what goes on our mind he understood what it was to fight to battle to struggle to have Satan come and bombard us with these things and he would say this to the Philippian Church he says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report he says if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things the Amplified would say this way he says for the rest Brethren whatever is true whatever is worthy of reverence and is Honorable and seemingly whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely and lovable whatever is kind and Winsome and gracious if there is any virtue and Excellence if there's anything worthy of Praise think on and weigh and take account of these things he says fix your minds on them you got to think on the right things to produce the right things amen Paul's saying be careful what you dwell on be careful where your thoughts are in any given day amen we're going to talk about how virtue of morality and character turns into strength in the next service but the decision for virtue happens first in your mind and you've got to take what's in your heart what's in your soul and apply it by your mind through your will to your life amen you've got to decide what you're going to think about it is a choice it is a choice amen Paul said dwell on good things think good thoughts if there's something right and wholesome talk about that we have a tendency to talk about the things that are going wrong rather than the things that are going right we have a tendency to talk about the problem rather than the promise amen don't let Satan lead your mind around remember a bull has a ring through its nose for one reason it's real tender sometimes he gets into our minds and our minds are tender and he just starts to tug on our emotions he starts to tug on our memories he starts to to tug on things that have caused us problems in the past and he's trying to lead us around so that we don't get around to this if he can get us caught up in head games he's got us beaten that's where the greatest battle is is in your mind amen don't let circumstances lay hold of your thoughts don't be dwelling on the problems or failures or issues brother Brown had this beautiful quote he says you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought can we read it together you cannot get anything from God with a negative thought now you say brother John I can't stop a negative thought we're going to read a quote what brother Brown talks about it you know we're receivers that's what we are we're receivers but listen we got two two kingdoms and guess what we're built to tune into a Heavenly Kingdom and so we have a choice to decide what station we're going to listen to and if I'm not saying we can't say the reality of things but how do you take a negative thought true though it may be and turn it into a good thought think about the antidote think about the word promise to resolve the issue think about what the word says rather than what the circumstance does and turn it into a testimony potential rather than into a failure or a fault or a problem or an issue amen repeat the word listen to the word rather than the problem the confession of our mouth has to be the word of God and guess what words don't start in your mouth they start in your mind so you've got to have the right thinking there amen they begin in your mind and your thoughts and then your mouth speaks them so if you spend your day thinking negative thoughts then what kind of words come out of your mouth negative words depressed words defeated words words that find fault words that speak of failure words that speak about the maybes rather than the musts if you're dwelling on negative then all that's going to come out of you is negative as well we're not in Psychology here we're in the word if you're going to dwell on the negativity that's all that God can bring out that's the only thing that's going to come out of your mouth amen an overcoming Life starts with an overcoming mind because you've got to win here before you can win out here right virtue must reside in our thoughts before it ever comes out and be produced in our life you know what I love about brother Chad you can't drag a negative confession out of that man it's annoying sometimes I know he's listening brother Chad always has a positive confession he's not saying that the reality isn't there but he's saying I believe God time and time and time again that's an amazing thing to have that doesn't mean we can ignore realities doesn't mean we can't skip out on our work and our obligations I'm not speaking about the chat I'm speaking of all of us here right you can't say I believe God's going to do something wonderful and then sit around and do nothing Amen brother Chad has had to work to get where he's at brother Joe has had to work to where he's at in his business that doesn't exclude you from doing those things but his positive testimony you can't beat him down you can't beat him down that's literally what Paul's saying think on the good things think on the good things of God brother Brian would say this we're almost done here he says just around the corner when you get to thinking about Divine Healing get to thinking about Christ keep him on your mind he says if there be any praise if there be any virtue the Bible said think on these things if anything thought comes by well maybe it couldn't be so maybe it he says get it off your mind right quick think on things that are positive never let a negative thought pass through he says don't let it stop anyhow if it starts through keep your thoughts positive and then he says Jesus he says don't think sitting here in a wheelchair you you're helpless you're hopeless church we don't have anybody in wheelchairs here but you take your situation don't sit here in whatever it is that's bugging you anything that's been bothering you anything that's looming over you holding you back today don't sit there and say well this is what it is it is what it is he's saying don't sit there thinking you're hopeless or helpless he says you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through or don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind but don't let it stop he says like the old farmer said I can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun see I can sure keep them from roosting so you do the same thing and you too see don't let them Roost let them pass right on through and brother Brown would say right after that he says and we've got a double barrel shotgun we've got the Old Testament and we've got the New Testament we've got the fully revealed word he says use that to keep them moving on they get uncomfortable when you start blasting with the Old Testament the New Testament when you bring a balanced word approach to the situation Devils don't like it they go for an easier Target amen what is it's the full word of God being applied he'd say this God lets you think on things and study about it it's what you come to church for that's why we're here tonight he says if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things what are you thinking about tonight maybe I won't get healed I'll go back home you'll get what you're thinking about have it determined in your heart that God will do it and God will do it don't pack your sin back home don't pack your unbelief don't pack your disease church is it just a Wednesday night or is it a time to catch the thoughts of God are we just coming to church or is it a place for strength and encouragement are we just performing our habit or our Christian Duty or are we coming in to see God do a work in our lives that's what he's saying don't just come in to come in come in with purpose come in with intent come in and say Lord get a hold of my life speak into my life reveal to me what needs to happen reveal to me what you want to do revealing me what's possible and then let me step into it amen brother bam says don't pack what you brought in all the way back home leave it here at the altar leave it here in your pew kick it out get it off remember in Pilgrim's Progress Christian comes to the cross and he's been carrying this burden and as he kneels at the cross the burden Falls away and it goes down the hill to where he can't ever pick it up again lay it down is what he's saying don't don't don't lay it down to pick it up at home later either don't teleport your problem to tomorrow and say well I'll deal with it tomorrow no deal with it here today this is where virtue is say I've decided the word is going to have an effect and there'll be a strength that comes behind it you'll see amen don't have a conversation with symptoms don't have a conversation with what it's been to date say from this day forward what did Moses say these Egyptians you won't see him after today you won't see him after tonight once God does a work it's done it's a finished work amen Paul gave an admonition about how we think he said this he says these things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me believe do virtue is in doing the application of the word is virtue living out the word is virtue he says and the God of Peace shall be with you what's he saying don't let it stay in your mind cleanse your mind let your mind think the right things let what's in your heart what's really in your heart come through don't let just be thoughts but put it into action now live what you've heard obey what you've heard apply it to your life what show agreement with your life and then what comes behind it he says the God of Peace there's a rest there's a settled there's a finished work that comes behind it amen I'm going to close with this quote the musicians can come if they want he says may we be upright honest and true he's praying here he says may we be the kind of a Christian that would be a credit to any community Grant it Lord may we be women and men such as you could lay your hands upon and say my servant behold this is my servant in whom I am delighted I can send them and they'll go they know how to speak and when to speak and I can be with them he says oh Father grant that blessing to every one of us amen God bless you let's stand if you would amen I love what he said he said don't pack your sin back home don't pack your unbelief don't pack your disease don't pack your problems don't pack your past leave it here he says have it determined in your heart that God will do it and God will do it and then virtue starts here virtue starts with a conscious decision a conscious acceptance of what the word has said and a belief that it'll have the same effect if you'll applied in your life amen I mean if we just close our eyes each one bow our heads I want you to reflect sometimes we're looking for victory and it seems like we can't get there brother Brown says just lay it down look into your life this night nobody's looking every head's bowed every eyes closed you got something you say Lord I've been fighting this one way too long Lord I've been dealing with this this Tormentor I've been dealing with this feeling I've been dealing with this barrier and I'm sick and tired of it Lord give me the right thoughts give me the right mental attitude well give me a word that'll give me the antidote to what Satan's been trying to do in my life hey man let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord you see your precious children Lord hands raised Lord and we're coming before you this night Lord we don't want just a church service or the mediocre sermon we've done our duty but Lord what we desire is a Living Word a living reality Lord of virtue a strength Lord that flows out of us Lord a life that is cleansed and suitable for your use Lord you said that we're supposed to be a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people Lord set aside Lord we're supposed to be a city on a Hilltop a light on a hill that cannot be hidden Lord Lord I pray you help us Lord let us lay hold of your word Lord let us Rise Up by faith each one Heavenly Father though each one battle we struggle Lord we have these little foibles and faults and isms and inferiority complexes and family issues and even our genetics Lord fighting against us Lord but you sent your word to heal our every disease Lord you've given us Victory Lord through the blood and by the power of your Holy Spirit so Lord I'm praying for each one that's raised their their hand Lord that even in their hearts Lord have said Lord touch me this night Lord may we leave every single thing here Lord may you strip us of every burden of every issue of every flower thing that Satan just throws in our face sort of every Tormentor that's here Lord may we go free tonight by the power of your Holy Ghost
