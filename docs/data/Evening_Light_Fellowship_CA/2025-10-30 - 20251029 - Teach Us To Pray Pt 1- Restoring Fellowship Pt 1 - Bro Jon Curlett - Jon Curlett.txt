Lord, it's grace, Lord, that brought us to this place. It's grace that brought us into position. Lord, it's grace that's going to take us home, heavenly father. Lord, but it's not just grace, Lord, but it's a faith, Lord, that you bring with it, Lord, that takes us into these things, into circumstances, and through life, Lord, Lord. And that faith looks beyond what we can see and hear and sense, Lord. And it looks by faith to your promise of your word, Lord. And that's our resting place tonight, Lord, is the promise of your word, Lord. We're thankful to be here once again tonight, Lord. Thankful for the people that have gathered in, Lord. thankful for an opportunity to come, Lord, that you could share yourself with us once more, Lord. That we could draw closer to you, Lord. That we could be strengthened and encouraged, Lord. That Lord, we could just go out, Lord, with a a greater strength, Lord, a greater closeness with you than we had when we came in. Lord, I pray you minister to your people that have faithfully gathered here tonight. Lord, those that couldn't make it, Lord. We pray your grace to them also, Lord Jesus. Be with us now. We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you would turn to Psalms chapter 66, Psalm chapter 66. Good to see each one here. Good to see brother Bob, Sister Brenda here today. Amen. God bless you. Good to have somebody in the front seats again. Amen. God bless you. Happy to see you doing so well. Amen. We uh want to remind the people that I'm leaving for Calgary first thing Sunday morning. Unfortunately, I tried to get flights out in the afternoon. They they didn't really exist. I wouldn't have been able to preach no matter which time I left. And uh so I I've got to leave first thing in the morning. So brother Mark will take the Sunday morning service and then brother Garfield will take the Wednesday uh evening service. So remember them in prayer that God would just make them a blessing. Just help them settle in and that he would speak to his people. Amen. We want to remember I think brother Joe mentioned it but the saints in Jamaica just uh they went through the worst storm in their history. Uh we got a an update from brother Keith Reid this morning and he said that the the electricity is out pretty much across the entire island. Um they've got some property and damage and livestock challenges. Most of the trees are down across the entire island, but everyone is safe. So we praise the Lord for that. When you uh when you hit land at 185 miles an hour, people usually die. But uh by God's grace, they've been preserved. So we thank the Lord for that. They've got a lot of work ahead of them, a lot of hard days ahead of them. and we just trust the Lord will grant them grace there. I'm not sure if they'll be a way for us to maybe help them. We'll see what happens as things kind of unfold and and kind of come back into some semblance of order. So, we want to remember them especially tonight. Amen. Psalms chapter 66, just a short scripture tonight. David says this, "Blessed be God which had not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me." Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats. And we're starting a new series tonight. You can hold the applause. Amen. But we're going to primarily do this on the Wednesday nights as far as I can tell. And on Sundays, we'll probably do the other series that the Lord has laid on my heart. And that allows those that only make it to Sundays to get every bar, every bit of that series. And and then the rest of we're going to do one series on Wednesdays and we'll do another series on Sundays. and I'm not bound by chains in those things. We'll follow the Lord's leading however he would do it. But that's my intention is to is to do this series primarily on Wednesdays. We want to do a series on prayer. And uh just a I I listed 10 or 11 questions in here that will kind of come up along the way. And some of these have been asked to me and some of them have been brought up just people don't ask them but by their actions or by their statements that they make then we know that these are questions we need to answer. Questions like what is prayer? That that seems like maybe a a silly question, but what is prayer? Why do we pray at all? How do we pray? What's the goal or purpose of prayer? Why do we pray if God has already determined what's going to happen? If that's the case, then do my prayers even matter at all? What happens if I pray contrary to God's will? Does God only do certain things if we pray? Do we have to pray to receive certain things from God? How do we know how to pray about situations? What makes God listen to my prayer? Anybody want God to listen to your prayer? I'll tell you this. We want an answer, but do we want him to listen? That's a that's something we'll get into as we go. And what makes God act on my behalf on my prayer? So, we're going to get into these different things. And you know, sometimes we just think that prayer is well, we just get down and we say something to God and then he does something or he doesn't do something. But prayer is so much more than that. There's so much more depth to it. And really, we're going to try and set a foundation tonight. And I'll tell you this, this is meant to be mostly teaching certainly, but there's going to be some preaching because I'll tell you this, if you don't have a strong prayer life, you're going to struggle as a Christian. Absolutely. Amen. We have to have a real prayer life. It's absolutely essential to a Christian. And you can read your Bible until you're blue in the face. But if you cannot talk to the author, if you do not have a personal relationship with the author, you're going to struggle in your life until you come to a place where you have a real prayer life and where it's a priority in your life. And by that, I I don't mean that you say a prayer every day. I mean that you pray every day. That you commune with God every day. And that we're honest and we're sincere when we do those things. Amen. Because if there's one person you can't fool, church, it's God. If I go in and I'm trying to tell God what I think he wants to hear, what I think I'm supposed to say, that is not what God receives. What God receives is a sincere and honest heart before him. Amen. And so we we won't get very far with him if we're trying to do it by form or by by by tradition or something like that. So I want to just take a simple series uh title called Teach Us to Pray here tonight. And I'm going to start tonight with a a subtitle of restoring fellowship. And my hope, don't hold me to this, my hope is to try and take this in little bite-sized chunks for the Wednesday night so that I don't tire you out too much. And I know sometimes I keep you late on Wednesdays and and I can honestly say it's never my intention to go long on a Wednesday. I know we're often tired and kids have school and we got to get up in the morning. But my intention is to just try and keep it tidy and concise, but sometimes a preacher's got to preach and we trust the Lord is leading in those things. Amen. So, I want to preach tonight on restoring fellowship. But I want to take us back to the beginning to set a foundation. If you've heard me preach at all, you know that when I start something, I like to take us to the beginning because if we can see what it is in the beginning, we can see what it's supposed to be when God does a restoring work in our lives. Amen. And so when we go back to the beginning, we see how it was in Genesis. And we're talking about restoring fellowship here tonight. And it says, "And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden." Now remember in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve as as perfect beings without sin had three major benefits or attributes because of their condition. Amen. They had one thing and that was primary in their life and that was fellowship with God. They had unfettered access to Christ. Amen. With no boundaries or no limits to it. The second thing they had was eternal life. They were sinless children of God, perfect in God's eyes, made in God's image, and holding his own eternal life inside of them. And then the third thing they had was dominion over the over the earth. They had total control over their environment. Okay? So they have fellowship with God. They had eternal life. and they had dominion over the earth. And remember what God said. He says, "I'm going to make man in my image." And so what we saw in the beginning was people that were perfectly reflecting God in their environment. Amen. God was a master over everything he made. And he put man into his own domain. And he was to be God within that domain. Not a God to be worshiped, but he was to be a God that had dominion and full control over the environment of the earth. And so Adam was that perfect expression of God. And so when God placed Adam on this earth, Adam was to be on the earth as God was to the entire universe. He was supposed to have full dominion, full control. He was the head. He was the apex. He was the top dog. Whatever you might want to say, we are meant to have total control over our dominion. So God placed us on earth just to be like him. It was built for our pleasure. It was built for our benefit. It was supposed to be something that that had value to us, that gave us meaning for our lives. And so God wanted us to be just like him in our lives, in our expression, in the way we spent our time. And God knew that when we sinned, we would lose that. And so God built into all of this, a redeeming work to get us back into relationship with him. Amen. To give us back relationship with him, fellowship with him, eternal life and dominion. But I want you to see something because when we look at the fall, and that's really where we're going to start tonight, we see that eternal life and dominion relied on fellowship. Remember what was the tree of life? Who was the tree of life? It was Christ. Everything flowed from Christ. When they lost access to the tree of life, they lost eternal life. And with eternal life went dominion. They were no longer gods. They were just humans. There was nothing there. Amen. Why? Because Christ was the tree of life. And when you lose Christ, everything that he offers you goes with them. And so they were left to their own means and their own ends. And I want I I read this scripture here in Genesis 3:8 to show us what God normally did and then how Adam and Eve reacted to it. Amen. Because each day, remember, in the cool of the evening, Christ would come down and he would walk in the garden and he would bring, he didn't even have to call Adam and Eve to him. They would come to him willingly of their own free will, of their own desire, and they would be so happy to see him. And it was such a peaceful and loving time. And they would walk together with him, and they would talk together with him, and he would share things with them, and they would share things with him. And brother Brown would say, "At the end of the day, then he would lay them down under the tree on his lap, and he would put them to sleep." So all was perfect rest, and it was a time of perfect and direct fellowship. But what broke down the fellowship? This is key to our service this evening. What broke down fellowship? What is it that separated them from God? It was disobedience to the word. That's the thing that pushed them apart. Remember, we see here Christ is walking in the trees of the garden in the cool of the day. And let me ask you this, who broke the fellowship? Did Christ break the fellowship, church? He was where he always was doing what he always did. Who broke the fellowship? Humanity broke the fellowship. Adam and Eve broke the fellowship. It was mankind that hid. It was mankind that refused to show up. It was mankind that was ashamed. It was mankind whose conscience was bothering them. And so they pulled back and God was there trying to draw them into fellowship, but they had separated themselves from him. Church, that ought to be a consolation for us tonight. God is always fighting for fellowship. God is always desiring fellowship, but it's us that tends to pull back, not him. Amen. It's us that tends to to to let these things go. God never stops wanting it. God never stops desiring it. God never stops trying to make a way for us to come back to fellowship. Amen. But it's us that come and go. It's us that get hot and cold. It's us that have zeal and then we go into a backsliding condition. It's us that pulls away. And he's always staying right there looking for fellowship with his children. He's always there to do it. Amen. Church, if you've stopped talking to God, it's not cuz he's left. It's because what? You've walked away or you're in disobedience and you refuse to come out of that disobedience. Today, that's the way it would be. You've walked away. He has not walked away because he's always in the same place. He's always walking with the word. We have to walk away from him to separate our fellowship away from him. Amen. So, what broke that fellowship with God? It was disobedience to the word of God. It was the actions of Adam and Eve. It was a mistake by Eve. She thought she was doing the right thing. It was intentional by Adam for the love of his wife. But what it doesn't matter really who did what. What matters is that they disobeyed the word. And that did a work inside them. Church, they broke the word. But something broke inside of them when they did that. They went from being happy to see Christ, of wanting to see Christ, of loving to seeing Christ, to drawing back because something in them had changed. And all of a sudden, they knew they were not the way they were before. They pulled back from it. Amen. They went from being so happy to being ashamed of themselves. And they didn't want to be in his presence. We know that God would draw them back in and he would he would tell them what had to happen because of this. And he would say to Adam, "Adam, because you've done this, you're going to fight the earth and it's going to push back and you're going to live by the sweat of your brow and the earth's not going to be cooperative and you're going to have to fight every day to live." And then he said to Eve, because you've done this, your desire is going to be to your husband, and you'll be under his headship, and your desire will be before him, and you'll have pain complicated, you know, uh, multiplied in your conception, these different things. And so God, they when they lost their fellowship with God, he turned them to an imperfect fellowship. He turned them to imperfect relationship because of it. And now the man was tied to the woman as a protector and as a provider. And the woman's tied to the man now for headship and preservation of life. Amen. But that's not the way it was meant to be. If that fellowship was broken and they lost it with the one that mattered most. Brother Brandham would say this and he's speaking of Adam in the garden. He says, "Now notice him in his glory back there when he had sinned. God felt so sorry for the poor fellow. See him and Eve going away, going out of the fellowship. They would have to shift for themselves." He says, "What could they do?" They had a loving father who would take care of them, but now through disobedience cut off all fellowship. He says, "No more fellowship." They had to make it for themselves. church. This is the human condition. Without fellowship with God, you're on your own. And look what he calls him. The poor fellow having to shift for themselves. He says, had to till the soil and earn the living by the sweat of their brow. They had to get sick and die in all kinds of troubles and heartaches and disappointments. Why? He says severed fellowship. He says no more fellowship with God. It couldn't be. church. If you're struggling, what's the answer? Get back into fellowship. If you're struggling with the way things are going in your life, what's the answer? Get back into fellowship. Cuz that's what caused the whole thing in the first place was severed fellowship by disobedience to the word. And so, we can see here that fellowship with God is on the basis of the word of God. It's through the word of God. Now, that might seem obvious to you and I because we're well taught by God's grace. But there are billions of people today that are claiming to have fellowship and relationship with Christ. And they can't tell you the word that has corrected them lately. They can't show you the word that's living in their life. Amen. They can't tell you how the word applies to their daily life. And yet, they'll sit there and say, "But I have fellowship with Jesus Christ all day long." But that's impossible. It's impossible to have a relationship with the God and deny the very word that he gave us. Amen. They claim the blood of Jesus, but they refuse the word of Jesus. Amen. That's a big problem because that's not how God works. God's fellowship is always through his word, not through works. It's always through his word. Amen. They've got a relationship now with a God of their own making, and they're completely fooled. And so, they're worshiping someone other than Christ. That's what the scripture says. Amen. But in the garden of Eden in Genesis 4 where we read that God slew an animal for the sins of Adam and Eve. And we see there that the word and the blood get tied together. That's what happens there. Amen. Why? Because God would always cover our sins so that he could bless us with his word. But he had to find a way to to to cover the transgression so he could give us the blessings. And the way to do it was by shed blood. God's intention was always to preserve life. God values life. God wants to save people. God wants to preserve people. Amen. But after the fall of in the garden, God moved fully into a plan of redemption to restore us back to our original condition. And how did he do it? By the blood of the lamb and the word of God. The two of them are tied together. Remember, you always had to come under the shed blood. But let's look at First John chapter 1. It says this. This then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. And if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth. So you can't say I'm in fellowship or I'm in relationship with God and then live in darkness. The two are incompatible because God is light. And if you have God in your life, then there has to be light there. Darkness has to vanish. Amen. We're talking about habitual life now. We're not talking about mistakes. We all have our moments throughout our day and our week where we do things we ought not to do. But our habitual life is in light because we're walking according to the word. Okay? We have fellowship with God and we keep coming back to that light if we happen to to step away from it momentarily. But he says, "But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. We have fellowship with Christ and we have fellowship with each other. It's all tied together. Amen. It's one big body. He says, "And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses us from all sin." Now, we take this over to Psalm 119, and it says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." Amen. In other words, th the word is with me so that I can walk right, so that I can live right, so that I can see where I'm supposed to be going. So, the word is the light of God. And so if we take that and we transpose it back into first John 1, we say if we walk in the word as he is in the word, we have fellowship one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins. So the purpose of the blood is to cover our sins so we can come back into fellowship. And that fellowship is through the word of God. Does that make sense this evening? The blood restores us to fellowship through the word. That's the requirement of it. The basis of fellowship is God's word because that's how he reveals himself. That's how he shows himself to us. You can't love God and hate his word. And you can't know God unless you know his word. You can see him in nature. You can see him in the laws of nature. You can see him in the beauty of nature and these things. But to truly understand him, you need his word. The other things reflect, but the word really reveals. Amen. and and it gives us some way for us to potentially understand with him and connect with him. Now, Burban would say this. He says, "And today, men who refuse to walk in the light of Christ, not refuse the sacrifice of Calvary, but what? Refuse the light of the word, which is Christ himself." So today, men who refuse to walk in the light of Christ, you have spurned mercy. So there's nothing left but judgment. That's what they had in Eden but for the blood of Christ. Judgment. That's all that was left. Now listen to this. He says there's something beyond the veil yonder that pulls the Christian. He can't explain it. He doesn't understand it himself. But there's something in that fellowship that he has with Christ. He says sever him from there. He becomes a wanderer. You're looking and you're looking. I'm reminded of Brother Barry Coffee going around the world looking for truth, looking for meaning. And what was it? It was here all the time. If only he was a little more like brother Mark. But some people, they are prone to wander and some people find it right away. But I'll tell you this, as a child of God, you're always searching until there's a satisfaction that comes into your soul. And that's only met through relationship, through fellowship with Jesus Christ. Now we know God made a provision right there that day for all humanity. And his provision was to take the life of an innocent and dues it to to cover the blood of that innocent would cover the sins of the guilty. It was a life for the life. And we saw that when God made made clothes for Adam and Eve, it was the clothes of the animal he had killed in theirstead. That's an extreme event. You talk about extreme. They went from perfect life and peace and joy to death just like that. But God knew what was coming and God had made a provision for it. But they went from perfection to blood covered in a day in a moment. Amen. Church, that shows how seriously God takes his word. But it also shows how seriously he takes fellowship with his bride, with his people, with his children. Amen. church. Why was God so intent on this? You think about what happened that day. Why didn't God just wipe it all away? I mean, it was only two people. Why not just wipe it all off and start it all over again? That would be my inclination. We barely just got started. Why don't we just boot them out and we'll speak a new one into existence? We'll take Satan out of the equation so that we don't have this problem in the future and let's just start it clear and perfect. Why didn't God do it? One, God knew it was going to happen. God could have stopped it from the beginning, but he chose not to. Amen. And the prophet of God would tell us that God wanted to express his own attributes. He wanted to express his attribute of a savior, of a healer, of a liberator, of a conqueror, of a deliverer, of a provider, all these different things. But I want you to see that the word had been given. And when the word had been given, he couldn't go back on it. He had put the names in the lamb's book of life, but he'd also put a sentence of judgment for those that transgressed it. And so, he had to let it play out. He was bound by his own word to do it. And so, God came down. And hidden in that entire word was a work of redemption. And that was the great thing that God was trying to do. God was going to bring us all the way back to what we had in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve. And in that, he would produce a people with character that would not fall. That's what he's been trying to do. That's what he is going to do. That's what he is doing today. Is God is producing a bride that has his full character and nature. and he will work through those people in a redemptive work to restore them back to what they had in the very beginning. Listen to this quote. It's so beautiful for us believers. He says, "In order to restore," we're asking the question, why didn't God just wipe it off? In order to restore fellowship again, God made a provision right there in the garden. If there would have been any other provision better, God would have made it. But God made the only provision and the only basis of restoration to that blessed eternal fellowship was through the blood of an innocent victim. He says God made a way back to fellowship. That's the only basis God ever had or has now or ever will have. He says it makes me feel religious knowing that there is a way that there is a God provided way. church that out to give us confidence this evening is that if he makes a way, it works. Because God doesn't give us a way that leads us to failure, that leads us to disappointment, that leads us to a dead end. You ever driving down a road and you think you know where you're going and you end up in a dead end? Husbands, don't raise your hands. We do it sometimes. We think we know where we're going. We think we know the end and we get there and the ways thereof are the ways of death. That's what the scripture says. But when we follow God's way, it leads us to a certain end. It leads us to where he says it's going to go. That ought to make us feel religious. He says, he says, "And what may God provide this way?" Hallelujah. He says, "Because God is love, and love demands fellowship." Love demands fellowship. What a thought. Fellowship is not optional with God. Fellowship is not take it or leave it. or we have it today, we don't have it tomorrow. Who cares? No, he says love demands fellowship. Fellowship is a requirement of love. Amen. It's the expression of love, if I could put it that way. And so God is insistent on having fellowship with his family. Love does not exist without fellowship. Amen. They're part and parcel of each other. And so the very nature of God's love is that there has to be fellowship with his creation, with his children, with his family. That had to happen. God couldn't leave us on our own without a way back just on without a hope or without having the love of God in our lives. It wasn't enough for God to just say, "Well, I've got children on earth. I'm a father. I have a family." And then he would stand back and watch us battle and fight and and and shift on our own for the rest of our lives. That's not fellowship. That's not fatherhood. Fathers, we are not a father because we've brought children into this earth. We're a father because we've got fellowship with our children. That we're working with them day in and day out. That there's a relationship there and a on a on a daily thing that involves us in their life that connects us that causes a communion between us. Amen. So God wouldn't stand back in his love and let us battle this whole thing out ourselves. But he had to restore fellowship because it was a requirement of love. Amen. That's what he's trying to do. Works and knowledge and effort. That's all great, but it's not love. Amen. That's not the attribute of love. That love requires fellowship. And that's what God's working to restore is a closeness with his people. And how does he do it? By the shedding of blood. He says then upon the basis of the shed blood, Adam and Eve had a road back home again to fellowship with God. That's the first thing. That's the biggest thing. That's the greatest thing we could have is a fellowship with God. He says it was used all down through the ages. all down through every age it was used. He says the book of Job's the oldest book in the Bible. But Job now the only way that he had to come to God for fellowship was through the shed blood of the lamb and a burnt offering. You know, we think about what happened after the the fall in the Garden of Eden. Did Adam and Eve have perfect fellowship with God after that? Did they have constant access to God? Could they just have a chat with God anytime they wanted? No, they couldn't. Why? Because they could not go to him. He had to come to them. It was on his sovereign will. It was on his sovereign grace, not on their own. They had to wait on him. They could not do it of their own will. So fellowship was now on the basis of him, not on us. Amen. There was a wall there that they couldn't go through. They didn't have access to the tree of life anymore. They couldn't just walk up to that. Amen. He had to come back to them. And why was that, church? Because their sins were covered, not erased. That was the barrier that was between God and man was that sin barrier. Amen. That book of remembrance was covered in right letter, red letters of all of our misdeeds, of all of our sins, of all of our unbelief, of all of our faults and failures. And they couldn't have fellowship if they tried. They couldn't have perfect fellowship. One, God couldn't come down in perfect fellowship, church. But even we wouldn't be accepting of perfect fellowship because our own conscience wouldn't allow us to come into it. We have our own holdups. We have our own our our things in our our life and our mind that hold us back, our complexes and these different things because remember what separated them from God in the first place was them, their acts, their conscience, their issues. It was a guilty conscience that held Adam and Eve back. It wasn't God judging them. It was them judging themselves. It was something internal to them that pulled them back. Amen. So, the conscience that held them back was the greatest barrier that they had. They're under condemnation. They're under that cloud of guilt, sorrowful, ashamed, worried about what he was going to say, unsure of what was going to happen. Search, let me say it this way. Until your conscience is fixed, you won't come into true fellowship. You won't because you know what you're dealing with when you come into the presence of almighty God. And you cannot stand in his presence condemned. You don't want to come into his presence condemned. And if there's something that's bothering you, you don't want to come in there because you know he knows and you're unwilling to go into his presence. Amen. God might be willing, but you won't. That's why we fight coming up for prayer and coming to the altar so many times. is we think we're unworthy. And let me tell you, church, we're unworthy. But that can't be the barrier. Amen. That can't be the barrier. Not in this day and age. Amen. But you can't approach God if you're uncertain of where you stand with him. Amen. You won't bow your head in prayer if you feel like you're unworthy. If you feel you're guilty, you're not going to go to God unless you know he'll receive you. And usually the problems are up here. The complexes are up here. They're in our hearts and in our minds, not on God's end. But that's the thing that holds us back. Remember what it says in Hebrews 10 because that conscience is what bothered people for so long. And he says, "For the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect." People would come year after year and they give the sacrifices according to the law but it never perfected them. He says for then would they have not ceased to be offered because that the per worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. So in other words, if the blood of lambs and bulls and goats was truly effective, wouldn't their consciences have been clear? Wouldn't have they walked away free men and women and able to go into the presence of God? But they weren't. Why? Because the sins were only covered. They weren't erased. and our memory and our conscience would remember them time and time again. The debt was growing, but it was covered. But it's like if I was to put a blanket over this pew, over this pulpit, and then slowly stack books on top of it. You can't see what's underneath, but you know, it's getting bigger and bigger. And that's the way our sins were. And that's the way our conscience and memory was was we knew it was under the blood, but we knew it was still there. And someday we were going to have to answer for it. If God was just, if God was going to hold himself to his word, he says, "But in those sacrifices, there's a remembrance again made of sins." Every year, every year you went and you gave your sacrifices for your sins, and it reminded you that you were sinful. The very law of God, the very requirement of God reminded you that you weren't worthy to go into the presence of God, that you were flawed, that you have made mistakes that year, some of them big, some of them black, some of them dark, some of them more ashamed than others. And so, you know, every time you went to to plead the for the grace and mercy of God, it reminded you that you needed it and it reminded you that you weren't worthy and that you didn't have anything that was redeeming in your life. And he says this, for it's not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. So, God did didn't just have to take care of sin, but he had to take care of the effect of sin. And that's what we're looking for. Amen. It had to be something that wouldn't just take away what I did, but it would take away the memory. It would take away the the burned conscience. It would take away the hurt. It would take away the complexes. It would take away the barriers that held me back from him, not just him back from us. Amen. And that was going to take more than a a precious little lamb or a precious little goat or a bull or something. And we saw that in type in the garden when he killed that animal that was there there for their sin. But it was pointing to a greater sacrifice that was going to come that would restore fellowship. And we'd see the impact immediately when he did that because when Christ came, he would settle the sin question forever. And so he came and he died on the cross of his own will of his own will. Church completely surrendered to the word purpose of his life. And that day, it wasn't a an animal dying, but it was a man dying. It was a man for a man. It was like for like. And that's the only way that the price could be paid. Was a willful one. Perfect. Give his life for the imperfect, for the sinful. It was a God man. It was a son of God dying. And then, and only then was a path opened up to that fellowship all over again. Because before that, church, it was on God's terms. God would come down. God would go up. God would talk to this one. God would talk to that one. It was on God's whims that God could have fellowship. And it was only when God lowered himself to talk to us that we'd have any sort of fellowship. But we see what happened that day on Calvary when Christ gave up the ghost and died the veil of the Holy of Holies are split from top to bottom showing that it was a work of God. And what was he doing? He was tearing open the veil that only allowed one a year, imperfect though he was for a moment into the presence of God. And he was tearing that veil wide open. And what was he saying? He's saying the door's open. Now it's not on the basis of me. Now it's on the basis of you. You can come in if you're willing to go my way. And he showed it was a work of God because it wasn't torn from the bottom up. It was the top down. Showing it was a sign from heaven that God was opening up the way back to fellowship. And anyone could come into the Holy of Holies. Anyone could come into the shikina glory if they would come his way. Amen. Look at what it says in Hebrews chapter 10. It says, "And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftenimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. Doing the same thing over and over again, church, with no lasting effect. Total waste of time in terms of effect. But what it did was it pushed it forward one more year. It pushed judgment away for one more year. And it gave God a chance to be merciful rather than judgmental. But it wasn't resolving anything, covered, not erased. He says, "But this man, Jesus Christ, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, forever sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottool." Now catch this verse 14. For by one offering, church, you don't have to make any more offerings. We're not the Catholic Church. You don't have to make any offerings. You don't have to do any penance. For by one offering he has perfected. See, we just read before it says it could never make, let me see, the comer there unto perfect is what it says if I'm not mistaken. Amen. It says that they could never do that with one. They did that with millions of animals and it never perfect perfected a person. By one offering it says he had perfected for how long? It's only good for today. It's only good for yesterday. It's only good for him but not for me. No, he has perfected forever them that are sanctified. Church, we're not clean today and tomorrow we're dirty. We're not in today and out tomorrow. We're not saved today and rejected tomorrow. We're not accepted today and kicked out tomorrow. By one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified, those that come in under the blessing of that work. He says where for whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. So the Holy Ghost is a witness to you in your soul. Your confirmation that you are perfected through Christ. That's it. That's the finishing work. That's the confirmation to you, church. Do you need the Holy Ghost? You need the Holy Ghost. That's the only thing you've got that says that he's accepted you, that he's perfected you. Amen. You're perfect in God's eyes. That's what the Holy Ghost says. You're perfect in my eyes. He says, "For after that," he had said before, "This is the covenant that I will make with them. After those days, sayeth the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Church, you look at the Old Testament, and what is God always doing? Reminding them of their sins. This is what you did. This is what you did. This is what you did. And here's what I had to do. But we come into the New Testament. What is he pointing us to? The blood. The blood. The blood. The mercy. The grace. The mercy. The gracy. the grace. And what is it? You're spotless. You're perfect. You're without wrinkle. That's for the old folks. Without wrinkle. You got a new body waiting for you. He's pointing us to the finished work of Calvary rather than to ourselves. So let me ask you if if what's keeping you out of fellowship is yourself, you need to read the scripture a few more times and say, "Lord, I'm going to take the finished work of Calvary and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to show that I'm allowed to come into your presence and fellowship with you one more time." Amen. Church, he says, "What? And their sins and and their iniquities will I remember no more." If he can't remember it, it didn't happen. He's the final say, church. If it ain't on his videos, then it doesn't exist. Satan has nothing against you if God says you didn't do it. Amen. He says, "Now where remission of these is, where forgiveness, where release, where freedom of these is, there's no more offering for sin." Church, you don't have to pay a debt that doesn't exist. If somebody were by God's great grace to just go into TD Bank tonight and pay off our church mortgage, when brother Mark goes in next week as a as a treasurer to make a payment and he says, "I'm here to pay the mortgage." You know what they're going to say? What mortgage? Are you catching what I'm saying? When you go and you put it under the blood and then you go and try and pay him back for what he's already forgiven you for, he says, "What are you talking about? You don't have to pay for that. I paid for that. The debt is already paid. There's nothing on your record except grace, grace, and more grace. Don't try and pay a debt that's already been paid. Let it go. If he can't remember it, why should you? Amen. He says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness." We're going to get into boldness later on in this series. Amen. Not ashamed, not cautious, not creeping. You know, my youngest especially, when he knows he's done something he ought not to do, and he's coming into my presence cuz mama sent him, you know what he does? He goes real slow and he's usually crying before he gets there because he is convinced that what he's going to find is not going to be a good time cuz he knows he's done wrong. He knows he's in for discipline and dad's the worst when it comes to discipline cuz dad's the one that does the spanking. Dad's the one that puts him in his bed. Dad's the one that lays down the law harder than anybody else. Do you think he has boldness when he when he's in that situation? No. But what brings him running into my presence? When he knows I want him there. When he knows there's nothing between him and I. When he knows he hasn't done anything wrong. When he knows he's in good standing. Now he's coming in with boldness. See, church, what we think is because I've done wrong, I can't come in with boldness. That's what the blood's for. Now, you still got to come in in humility. You got to come in with a with a a a heart of sincerity, repentant, but you can still come in with boldness. Why? Because like Esther, he wants her in his throne room. He wants to draw her in. And so, we can come with boldness. Why? By invitation. He's the one that tore the veil. He's the one that opened the way. That's our invitation to come boldly to his throne. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, not by your works. How many of us go a and as we go to sleep at night, we say, "Lord, I did good today. How thankful I am to you." And we're so confidence in our prayer. confident in our prayer because we've been good today. That's not why we enter with boldness. We enter in boldness by the blood of Jesus. That whether I had a good day or whether Satan beat me more times than I beat him, we still come in with boldness. Why? By the blood of Jesus Christ. by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having an high priest over the house of God, let us draw near. Church, what does that tell me? This ain't on him. He's ready. He's willing. He's waiting. And it's up to us to draw. It's up to us to come close. It's up to us to accept the invitation. It's up to us to come into fellowship. He says, "Let us draw near with a true heart, a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience." In other words, the working of the blood, the accepting of the finished work of Calvary cleanses our conscience from what we've done, and it no longer holds us back from fellowship in the presence of God. That's what the Holy Ghost does in our life. That's what the blood of Jesus does. He says, "Let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water." Oh, so this isn't just an inward work, is it? No. This is a life that's being sanctified. This is a life that's being cleaned up as well, church. The blood is not just for the conscience. The blood is for the whole thing. It's cleaning out of your entire life. He says, "Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering. For he is faithful that promised." Amen. Church, you know what can be the most disappointing thing is you get an invitation and you get turned down at the door. He's saying, "No, no, no. He promised you can come. He promised you can come in. He promised you can come in boldly and you can come in and he can clean up your life. He can erase your conscience. He can make you come into fellowship with him. Brother Brown would talk about the effect of the blood and how it turns what is so obviously sin into the very righteousness of Christ through the blood. Because through the blood he can only see us as sons and daughters of God. He says this. He says, "Well, we through wrongdoings are red. Though your sins be scarlet red, he's quoting the scripture. Though the shed blood," he says, "through the shed blood of the lamb of the Lord Jesus." God looking through there red through red looks white. He says they shall be white as snow. Though your sins be scarlet, they shall be white as snow. Why? Because he's looking through the blood. I know as kids we used to have those those tinted glasses and you could mix the different colors. And what happens if you take uh something that's red like the the the little marker in my Bible? If I looked at that through a red glass, what would it what color would it be? It would be white. And he's saying through the blood of Christ, your sins, though they are scarlet, though they are against you. Remember, you never want your your accounting books to be red. You want them to be black. Black means you're making money. Red means you owe money. He says, "So though you owe money through the blood, it looks white. It's pure. It's clean." He says, "See, not through your something else, but through the blood, the only place that he can fellowship outside of there, your own righteousness, he'll never see it." See what he's saying? He's saying through the filter of his blood. That's the only thing that'll keep you clean. It's the only thing that keeps you clean through God. I preached on this before. When we look at the faith chapter, when you read about Abraham and Sarah in the in the Old Testament, in the book of Genesis, they see we see all their faults and failures. We see all their mistakes. We see all the things they took into their own hands. And you get to Hebrews 11 and it's by faith. By faith, by faith. Where's their sin? It's white. He can't see it. It's pure. It's been erased by the blood of Jesus Christ. And all he can see now is their faith. How they stuck with the word of God. I say praise the Lord to that. That's how he's looking at you and I this evening. He says outside of that, your own righteousness, if he looks at you through your own righteousness, all it does is magnifies your own sin. He'll never see your good works. He'll never know it until you come beneath the blood. Then he sees you as his own beloved son or his daughter. He said red through red looks white. Praise the Lord. He says, "No matter what you've done, sinner friend, when God looks and sees you confess your sins as being wrong, and God looks through the blood of the Lord Jesus, he sees you snow white." He says, "No matter what you've done, he's looking through you through Christ's blood." He says, "You're redeemed, precious thing. God will never condemn you no more. He can't condemn you." That's why we have to apply the blood because when we stand before him and we say, "Lord, I've been good. Lord, I've done this. Lord, I've done that." We're saying, "Lord, judge me through my works." And guess what? That doesn't hide the sin. But when we say, "Lord, I'm pleading the blood of Jesus Christ to come into your presence." All he can see is perfection. That's what the blood of Jesus Christ does you. He says he'll never condemn you no more. He can't condemn you. Job's always interesting to me because Job is before the law. We read there earlier. We're going to get into this a little bit in the next service, Lord willing. Yet Job still sacrificed. Everything was through the blood. We look at Abel. Abel sacrificed. Noah sacrificed. Abraham sacrificed. Children of God always seemed to understand that they had to go through the blood. And you know what? everyone else tried to do works. It's not that the children of God don't have works. It's that they understood that was never going to be enough. And that's a revelation. That's a revelation. You're not the bride of Christ tonight by works. You're the bride of Christ because he chose you and he gave the blood of Christ to cover you. Amen. It's that unmmerited ring of grace that we're wearing. Amen. It's through the blood of Christ that we can be restored back to perfect fellowship. Watch this as we close tonight. This is absolutely one of the top 10 scriptures in the Bible as far as I'm concerned. Romans 8. There is therefore now, not tomorrow, not later on, not when we go in a rapture, not when we go in a resurrection. There is therefore when? Now, today. Right here. There's therefore now no present tense forever unchanging. There's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. No condemnation. In other words, there is nothing to hold you back from fellowship with God anymore. Okay? Zero. God has no condemnation towards us. So why do we let us hold it back from him? That's the human condition. We're trying to be worthy rather than thankful rather than accepting. Amen. If we are in Christ by the indwelling spirit, we have the witness that we've been perfected in our souls. Then what can separate us from the love of God? Remember what he said? Love demands fellowship. Love demands fellowship. Amen. So love tears down the barriers that Satan has placed, that our mind has built up, the complexes we have. And love tears that down to restore us back to fellowship so that we can come completely into the redemptive work of Christ. Amen. Tears down everything that we've built, church, we can't even stop the work that he's doing. That's a wonderful thing to know. He says, "For the law, this is a law for us. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. Remember, there's two laws. There's the law of life in Christ Jesus, and that's what brought us above the law of sin and death. Law requires judgment. Love requires fellowship. So that means death and fellowship are going to have to fight it out. Law and life are going to have to law and love are going to have to fight it out. And guess what wins, church? Law versus love. Love wins every time. That's what Calvary was. It was loveinning. And so it demands fellowship. Amen. Our judge has now become our advocate. The prophet of God would say, "There's no one to condemn us anymore. There's no one to place a sentence. Sin has been condemned." Amen. Why? Because love demands fellowship. He says, "For what the law could not do, and that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh." In other words, Christ Christ's sacrifice condemned sin in itself. It judged sin. It sentenced sin and it put it away. Sin was judged. Instead of you being judged, sin was judged. It meant it was locked up forever. No longer to have a hold on our life. And it's condemned in the flesh. Church, whatever sins are here, stay with the flesh when we go. This sin, this this flesh is never going to be perfect. That's why it gets left behind and we go into a glorified body because sin is condemned in the flesh. But it's the soul that God's coming after in our lives. He says, "Why? That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit." Brother Ram says this as we close. But when our body becomes in tune with God, becoming a part of him, then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Ghost to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power and omnipotence. That's a quote. When our body becomes in tune with God, that's the whole thing, church. It starts with a soul work, but he wants to get this whole thing in tune. And that's really where our our Sunday series is going to be going, becoming a part of him. He says to vindicate him in all of his power and omnipotence. He has risen from the dead. He lives among us today. He says, "And he wants fellowship back with his people again. His great majesty, his glory is now spreading forth. and he's desiring to fellowship again with his people like he did in the Garden of Eden. Amen. God bless you. You can stand this evening. Amen. We've set a record. I think I know I haven't talked much about prayer, but we're getting there. But we're setting the basis for why we have prayer in the first place. And we'll see that prayer leads us into fellowship. That is our fellowship with God. That's the personal connection. And that's the the daily connection that we have with God. And we'll see that fellowship is the basis for prayer. It's not a I need this and I need that, but it's a desire for fellowship that brings us into prayer. And that's what turns it into what it's supposed to be in our Christian walk. And so much of what we are as believers flows out from that prayer life, from that communion, from that time that we spend with God day by day. Amen. Amen. I trust this has been okay today. It's setting a foundation, like I said, and we'll get into more depths and maybe some of these these questions that we've talked about, but my goal is to try and keep it as short as I can and concise so we can just come in and we'll eat supper for 45 or 55 minutes and then we'll go out and we'll rejoice and go on our way and go back to our beds. Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's bow our heads if we would. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, sin demanded justice, Lord. Sin demanded judgment, Lord, but love demanded fellowship, Lord. And through your redemption plan, Lord, that's what we've received today as we've got full fellowship back with you, Lord, as much as it can be experienced in these sinful bodies that we live in. Lord, we're thankful that you've made a way. You've made a provision. Lord, there's an open door standing for us. Lord, there is an invitation to come into your presence and to spend time with you, heavenly father. Lord, I pray you help us to take that invitation every day, Lord. That we would find our way into your presence, Lord. Not by formality, Lord. Not by form, not by tradition, Lord, but that in our prayer time, Lord, in our prayer closet, Lord, that we would have true communion with you, each one, Lord. that it would draw us into personal connection with you, heavenly father. Lord, I pray your grace, Lord, that you would just strengthen us through this series, Lord. That you would take it and use it, Lord. That you would teach us, that you would encourage us, Lord, that when we come out on the other side, Lord, not only would we understand, Lord, what you're trying to do, Lord, but we would experience, Lord, the very things you've talked about in these things. Lord, bless your people. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Sister Priscilla, you're going to hate me. Paid in full. Can we put paid in full up there? See if we can we can put our our way through this tonight. I'm sorry that just came to my mind as I was standing here. And this is an old Curlet song as many of you know. So, we're going to sing this a little bit tonight. Justice called for a payment for sin. No one worthy could [singing and music] be found among men. But the precious son of God [music] with a cross and thorny [singing] crown paid a debt with the blood of the lamb. [music] Paid in full by the [singing] blood of the lamb. [music] Oh, free from sin, free to live now I am. [music] And it reads on the page where my sins were written down, [singing] paid [music] in full by the blood of the lamb. [music] Oh, how great was the [music and singing] debt that I owe. Oh, bound to pay for the seeds [music and singing] I had sown. [music] But in Jesus, my Lord, a great treasure [singing] I have found. [music] I'm redeemed by the [singing] blood of the lamb. [music] made it full by the blood of the lamb. [music and singing] Oh, freed from sin. [music] Free to live. [singing] Now I am. And [music] it reads on the page where my sins were written [music] down. Paid in full by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; and justice called for a payment for sin. [music] Oh, no one worthy [singing] could be found among men. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, but the precious son of God with a cross and thorny [music and singing] crown paid the debt with the blood of the lamb. Oh, [music] paid for by the blood of the lamb. [singing] free from sin, free [music and singing] to live. Now I am. And it reads [music] on the page where my [singing] sins are written down, paid [music] in full by the [singing] blood of the lamb. [music] know how great was the [singing] debt that I owe [music] bound to pay for the [singing] seeds I have sold. [music] But in Jesus my Lord, a great treasure [music and singing] I have found. I'm redeemed by the [singing] blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Paiden full by the [singing] blood of the lamb. [music] Oh, free from sin. Free to [singing] live. Now I am. [music] And it reads on the page where my sins were [music and singing] written down. paid him for by the blood of [music and singing] the lamb. He has forgiven me. Uh it's a 956 and then my chains are gone. We kind of roll into that. He has forgiven [music] me. My sins [singing] [music] have been washed from his memory by the blood [singing] of the lamb [music] of Calary. [singing] He [music] has forgiven me. [music] He has forgiven [music] [singing] me. My sins have been washed from his [music and singing] memory by the blood of the lamb [music] at Calary. He has forgiven [music] me. Oh, he [music] has [singing] forgiven me. My [singing] sins [music] have been washed from his memory. By [music] the blood of the lamb at Calary, [music and singing] he has forgiven [music] me. My chains [singing] are gone and I've been set [music] free. My savior [music] ransom me. And like a flood, his mercy [music] grace, unending [singing] love, [music] amazing grace. My [singing] chains are gone. I've [music] been set free. My God, my Savior answer [music and singing] me. And like a flood, his mercy [music and singing] brings unending love. [music] Amazing grace. One more time. [music] My chains are gone. I've been set free. [music] My [singing] God, my Savior [music] ransom me. And like [singing] a [music] blood his mercy reigns [music] unending love. Amazing [singing] grace he came to me. 570 He came to me. [music] He [singing] came to me [music] when I [singing] could not come to [music] where he was. He came to me. [music] That's why he died. [music] on Calary. [music] When I could not [singing] come [music] to where he was, he [music] came to me. He came to me. [music] He [singing] came to me. [music] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. When I [singing] could not come. Praise your name. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Praise your name. Glory. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; That's why. Hallelujah. Yes. Thank you, Lord. On [music and singing] Calary. [music] But when I [singing] could not come to where he was, he came [music] to me. Sing it one more time. For he came to [music] me. He came to me. [music] When I [singing] could not come to [music] where he [singing] was, he came to me. That's why he died [music] on Calary. [music] When [singing] I could not come up to where he was, he [music] came to me. You know, I look back at my own life and I see the arrogance and the criticism that kept me back. But, you know, through all that, there was always a pull. Bad attitude, bad ideas, wrong impressions, selfishness, intellectuality, my own sense of my own greatness. Through it all, church, he came through. I'll never forget the light, the night I gave my life to my Lord Jesus Christ. I'll tell you this. I went from thinking a lot of myself to thinking nothing of myself. Prophet of God would say, "In that presence, you can't condemn anybody else. You can only see your own faults." And I saw very clearly how much I needed him. But I also saw what he [music] would do if I would let him do something with me. Amen. When I couldn't go to him, he came down to me. And he called and he wooed and he called and he pulled until I finally answered. Amen. And the prophet of God would say, "If you got that pull, it's the greatest thing you could ever have." And he'd say, "Don't wait one more day to give [music] into it. Don't take another minute, but give it. Yield to that call. Yield to that pull. You haven't given your life to him. Yield to that. You haven't been in his presence. Say, "Lord, I'm coming back into your presence. I feel that pull. I feel that draw. I'm going to come through the blood and I'm going to trust that you'll do a work in my life. Amen. I'm so thankful he came to me. Amen. And I'll tell you this and I've said it many times. When I laid my burdens down, you've never seen a person feel lighter. Brother Be talks about feeling all scoured out. That's the most glorious feeling. Church, that's what his presence is meant to do to us day by day. Scour us out. make us feel clean. Make us be what he sees. Amen. Not to go in feeling broken and beat up and failed, but to go in and be refreshed, be cleaned out, fit for service, [music] and then to walk out and be ready to do his will one more day, one more week, one more month. Amen. I just want to encourage you, church. Don't run away from his presence. If you got something between him and you, make it right through the blood. There's nothing he can't make right, but come back into his presence and let him [music] work a new in your life. Amen. We're going to sing one more song. We're going to sing that song. Thank you, [music] Jesus, for the grace that you have given. 10:21. Who did we have open up in prayer, Brother Joe, Brother Mark, Brother Bob, welcome back. We're going to have you close in prayer if that would be okay. [music] You're good for that. Amen. Have him close in prayer. Let's remember those that aren't here. Let's remember the saints in Jamaica. Let's remember the service on Sundays. Brother Mark takes that. Amen. I I wish I could be here. I don't know if I'll be able to listen. Maybe on the plane if the Wi-Fi is good enough. I I think I'll be able to do it, brother Mark. So, if so, I'll be listening in [music] and uh enjoying it from there. Hopefully, I don't get taken down by the air marshals for saying amen. [music] Amen. But looking forward to that. Sure. Appreciate you taking that. Then remember, Brother Garfield as well, church. He's a busy busy man and he's still going to come preach for us. So, just uh be in prayer for him. Come expecting. can come and join and I know the Lord will do something special for you. Amen. Let's sing this and let's thank him with all of our hearts. Amen. If [music] you've understood what it means to to experience the blood of Christ in your life, I'll tell you this. You got something to thank him for tonight. Let's sing this. Thank you [music] Jesus for the grace that [music and singing] you have given us. though I can't [music] repay, but from my heart I'd like to say that I thank you. [music] Thank you my Jesus [music] for the grace that you have given us. Oh, I [music] can't repay. But from my heart, I'd like to say that I thank [music] you. Thank [music] you, my Jesus, [music] for the grace that you have given us. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Though I [singing] can't repay, but from my heart, I'd [music] like to say that I thank [music] you. Amen. As brother Bob comes, I just want to say thank you to the musicians. Amen. And I want to say thank you to Sister Priscilla, Brother Paul, Brother Joe, Sister Moren back there, and Brother Bob as well. You know, I come every service, but even when I don't preach, they're here every service, and we certainly appreciate that. And we haven't uh made a swap out because we're unhappy with Sister Moren. Far from it. But she is slowly backing away from this. And so, Sister Priscilla will be taking the Wednesday nights, Lord willing, moving forward. She has been for a little bit. But I want to say thank you to her for taking that up. She's got a lot on her plate. She's homeschooling three kids. She's got a husband, a home to run, and she's taking this on as well. So, especially for her, [music] I say thank you for that. But, Brother Bob's been doing this for many, many decades now. And he will probably also soon be backing away somewhat, but we'll see what the Lord's timing is on that. But, amen. I want to thank them while they're here, while they're in their right mind, while they're able to accept our thanks and appreciation for that. It's a sacrifice every single time they're here. And it's not just in service. You talk to Brother Bob. He'll spend hours in prayer looking for God's leadership for songs. Sister Moren, I've been in the house and she'll play for hours and just go through the song books over and over and over again to stay on top of it. Most churches can't play 15 songs out in the world. We've got 1,200 that we can play almost at the drop of a hat. That takes real dedication. So, I want to just show my appreciation from them. I I might be the preacher, but theirs is a ministry of its [music] own. And there's a blessing and an anointing that comes with it. And we are to the great benefit of those gifts that we have here and the sacrifices they make and their spouses that give up that time and [music] that that fellowship with them so that they can be a part of the body and do a part in the body. So, thank you to each one of you. Sure appreciate you. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, we just bow Lord once again to thank you, Father, as we just saying, Lord, to thank you for the grace that you've given us. Unworthy as we are, Lord, you still knew us before the foundation of the world, Father. We were in your thoughts then, Father. And by grace, Lord, we're in your thoughts now. And so, Lord, we just thank you for that. And we thank you, Lord, for the way you've led us over the years, Father. the grace that has lifted us up, Father, and and and helped us, Lord, through all the battles and and pressures that [music] we've had over the years, Father. But Lord, you've been the victor, Father. You've given you fought the battles, Lord, and you've given us the victory, Father. And so, Lord, as we come down to the end of all things, Lord, we just want to thank you, Father, that you've made a way for us, Lord, and that, Father, we can look back and see, Father, how you've led us over those all those years, Lord. and to know, Father, that we've come to the place where we know, Lord, that there's a a heaven to gain, Lord, there's a hell to shine, Lord, and the enemy is going around as a roaring line trying to devour us, trying to throw us off, Lord. But, Father, we know, Lord, that there's one greater than he that's in this world. So, we pray that you would be with us, Lord. Strengthen us, Father, as we continue on, Lord. And, Father, we just pray that you bless those, Lord, that are suffering tonight, Lord, because of the hurricane, Lord. And Father, those in Jamaica, Father, we thank you that you preserve life, Lord. And we pray, Father, that you continue to help them, Lord, to recover, Father. And Lord, all those that, Lord, that may be in the path of the storm as it continues on. We're just praying, Father, that your presence will be there to guide, guard, and protect each one. So bless us as we leave this place tonight, Father. We just pray, Father, that your presence would go with us [music] and that, Lord, your light would shine upon us and in us, Father. And that, Lord, you'd lift us up, Father, into heavenly places as as we continue, Father, to just trust you, to believe you, Father, with all of our hearts as we commit ourselves into your hands tonight in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
