to give him all amen whether he want or not not my real father thine be done Amen so the grace of God be with us as we go into these words and the Lord blesses and we thank the Lord for our brother la Fontaine's visit with us we thank the Lord for our brothers fellowship and also the going forth of the word a man and as all some of you have already confided in me to say that it was good because it was a confirmation of what brother Joel was already preaching a man and it and it was and we thank the Lord for the way that he brought it out through our brother LaFontaine a man we pray God's grace be with him and he had to get back because he had a missionary apparently come to his church on Monday so and he was thinking about changing his flight from Tuesday to Monday but he just left it at Tuesday so we pray the grace of God bless him and whatever they had planned a man with the missionary and also I heard a prayer request for Buzzard brother Barry okay he had some biopsy okay the grace of God be with our brother bury a man and also to remember in prayer brother Eugene young in beachside apparently his father we trust went to be with the Lord on Sunday he I believe he turned 92 years old on Saturday and any and he left his body on on Sunday at 92 years old and I understand that he's going to be buried at the Pentecostal church in Springdale so and we pray grace of God to our brother Eugene and his family a man so the it's it's a loss even though he's 92 years old it's still something that they're going to miss and apparently I believe that he did live in beachside where our brother Eugene lives and and maybe I not Norton alike and I sure be died there or in the hospital in Springdale so God's grace to the family and I pray encourage their faith a man in the resurrection a man their faith in the coming of the Lord and the dead in Christ shall rise first a man that's the scripture that's the promise so I pray God's grace to encourage us to believe with all of our hearts and got God knows and again brother sister we're wearing that hour we're in that time you know of the end and I'd be honest there's nothing else left we've got to that that that climax which I'll touch on tonight concerning the resurrection of rapture because according to the prophecy of this book there's nothing else left because this quarter the prophecy of this book when this happened and this happens that this happens then what are we looking for the coming of the Lord the resurrection the rapture and there's nothing else left to happen so we pray the grace of God that we're going to have a resurrection and rapturing faith oh brother it's a challenge to us now and no wonder when we consider how many are getting caught up with the natural things of life and they got more faith in the natural more faith in politics more faith in in what's going on in the world naturally than they do in Christ than to do in God that's the truth oh I pray Greece we're going to have faith that pleases God amen because he said when he comes will he find faith on the earth amen and again I agree with our brother that Scofield and he translated that faith he said is a belief in the whole body of revealed truth amen what God because at the end God is the whole thing is revealed that God has revealed little by little by little a many real little to it to able in outside the Garden of Eden and then he revealed so look what he revealed to Enoch and then he then he revealed some more to it to Noah and then to the prophets then Christ a man the Alpha a man the resurrection and rapture now brothers the Omega resurrection rapture he's revealed Paul all the messengers down through the church ages to finally it's all finished a man there's nothing else to do nothing else to reveal a man now he's looking for the faith a man for the resurrection and the rapture the grace of God to his brother amen brother and I pray that we are numbered with the wise virgins a man not the

name of the Lord Lord bless Chester with me to Romans chapter 8 we're going to consider some of the scriptures that our brother Paul has ministered on first when he came and he was ministering on the subject of true or false expectations let's make our calling an election sure let's make sure that we're we have a true expectation a man and that with it is vindicated in the scriptures a man it's proven in the word that what we're expecting what we're looking for we can take it back to the scriptures we can take it back to the Bible a man they want they want proof they want justification why are you believing this why are you believing that well it's written a man it does say the Lord a man not not concerning another age not concerning another another phase or what God has done but it's what God is doing a man they saved us said the Lord on what God is doing Amen so again we're not living in the past we're living in the present tense as our brother brought out and it was a tremendous quote that were going from the from the Prophet to the prophecy a man and we're going from the messenger to the message that's the absolute truth we thank the Lord for bringing those things out through our brothers ministry and a confirmation again of a number of things that you have already heard us preach here in this this assembly a man a man brother and if we're bright we're going to be pretty treat preaching the same thing if we're bright we're going to be looking for the same thing if we're bright we're going to be hungry no thirsty for the same thing by the grace of God absolutely a mayor we're not going to be living in the past we're living in the present and what our brother brought out is true and we have emphasized it there are those there that are that are still preaching God has sent a prophet God has sent a prophet no that's that's true that's past tense but that's not the faith that he's looking for now if we were going to have that faith but we got had the faith of the prophesy we got out of the the message a man so that there was a profit but what why there was a messenger but why so what what was the message that he left what was the prophecy that he put the emphasis on a man so it's not another prophecy of Malachi 4 that the old I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great dreadful day of the Lord is not just saying what I believe that I believe that yeah we did but it's past tense and we believe that God has done it and it is past tense but what about the message of the Prophet so what if what did the what did the messenger leave when God took him off the sea so what do we have now because he's not here and like when our brother brought in in Isaiah and Isaiah and Moe and you know the Moses died and so on or the prophecy there and and the Prophet died but what was the message where's there anyone with the faith that please God a man as a result of God taking Moses on the scene and there was a reason he took Moses off the seat and he said Moses because you have done this I'm gonna take you off the scene and he's Hugo you're gonna come home with it with the Lord anybody asked Moses to go and anoint and pray for Joshua a man and turn everything over to Joshua and he was going to lead them into the Promised Land by the grace of God em and Caleb a man so as I said our brother Paul might have been Joshua and I we got on Caleb so we but we're going into the Promised Land a man is not just stating under the Prophet that brought us out we got to get under the ministry as taking us in a man we got to get under Minister it's going to build us up in the most holy faith a man and it is not not just faith to say I believe God sent a prophet is the faith that is going to believe what the Prophet left us a man the message that he left us near structures and he left us to go in and possess the land a man and brother a and then Moses prayed for Joshua and Caleb and the bottom of God he was praying for the for the younger ministry in his day he was praying for the faithful ministry and is because they were ordained to take the people on to the resurrection and the rapture a man and in and he did and he did say that and as I said I I don't recall the the the message that he said it ain't right now but I do have it underlined and marked in that message and if you ever got the message it'll be on the right side at the top a man and it's just before it just before he went in and read the scripture for the message he was going to preach and he said now it's for you young young brothers he said God has ordained you to take this message on to the coming of the Lord a man on to the resurrection onto the rapture because he knew that he wasn't going to be here now he wanted to be but he left that with God not not Israel but the will of God and the Lord took him and brother it says to put our faith in what God wants us to do amen not what he has done not not signs and wonders and our brother brought that out and has the absolute truth there are those that are looking for signs and wonders or looking for a return ministry of the prophet of God no the return ministry brother we're in it we're in the tenth vision amen amen were all dead that's already been in the process and brother the Prophet is not coming back we will see him again at the time of the resurrection and the rapture we're going to see him a man and brother I tell you I pray God that we're going to be in the spirit sure we're not going to miss what God is doing but then we got to be in the sphere we got to be led by the spirit and we got to get out of our heads and into our hearts amen so what we believe is out of our hearts what we believe is in our hearts by the grace of God because what the problem of God said is going to happen how it's going to happen but we got to live in the spirit I'll tear this we got to walk in the spirit for us to recognize the Resurrection when it's taking place for us to recognize the rapture winning winning when it takes effect in our lives and in our hearts where the grace of God we got to live in the spirit walk in the spirit because of the way that the problem of God said it's going to take place and it's going to happen but we got to get out of the the natural thing you think what we're going to see with our natural eyes no no no it's not what you see with the natural eyes is what you're seeing in your heart is what you're seeing in your soul maybe what you're seeing with your spiritual eyes a man where if we're just looking at it through the natural we're going to miss the rapture we're going to miss the resurrection we got it we got to get in the spirit we got to be in the spirit we got we got all my recognize God is in his birdie or God is in his word there God is doing this God is doing that amen so I pray that we're not going to miss the resurrection I pray they will not miss the rapture because we live in the spirit and we'll walk in the spirit so that we're going to recognize what God is doing in the spirit amen or whether the resurrection is going to be real it is going to be real but again it's going to be a vindication of your faith a man we're gonna see it where I can recognize what God is doing and no one is happening by our faith Amen we're gonna identify with this identify with that oh praise the Lord Alleluia amen but then when we go the world's not the world after a while they'll miss us amen after a while there missus amen misunderstand how the rapture is going to take place when the rapture is going to take place you know we will know all about it but again the world the world that was conscious of our our physical beings they won't do it they won't know we're gone Don't Tell after a while they'll wonder where is this person where's that person a man so I pray God we're gonna be in the spirit so that we're going to be a part of that resurrection part of that rapture we even right now that we that we'd be able to identify that we're a part of the resurrection we're part of the rapture we're going at a time we're going to Eternity amen we're getting out of these old bodies of flesh into glorified bodies amen brother if we're really ordained and predestinated for the rapture we're going to be changed consequently changing us continually day in and day out not just wait all of a sudden no yeah let's go it's going to be quick all right when it when it reaches the climax a man in a moment intrigued of and I we're going to be gone hey man we're going to walk in the spirit walk in the spirit and brother we're going to be funny to the world and so on the way we're living and and the way we talk and so on but again we're going to be conscious that something is going on in another dimension yeah hey remember that they're waiting on us the daddy Christ amen amen what for to get more and more in faith and in the Holy Ghost amen and walk more and more in the spirit because where they are they're in the spirit and so we get in the spirit amen we're going to connect I mean really in the spirit and I just get the spirit in you let's get the in the spirit ourselves it's Christ in us to make sure your your in Christ everybody and I believe the end of the prayer or wonder brothers pray it said either the fullness of the Godhead bodily in Christ the fullness of the Godhead Bali in the bright amen by the grace of God amen Christ in us Austin Christ he became the word in flesh we are the word of flesh a man by the grace of God sir brother with with the experience we have what is our brother Minister on expectation what is your expectation what are you expecting de indias the grace of gods that were expecting not like Pentecost signs and wonders no no the angel told the prophet of God stop using those signs and wonders it's because the people are leaning on a signpost hey man we got to move on it's like I said you see the sign out there you're so far from st. John's you're not gonna stop at the post no you're gonna go on to the next one you got to keep on going we're getting closer we're getting closer amen so we've seen this sign this sign this sign don't stop there don't focus on it don't dwell on it amen we were by the grace of God not to me that's what God is looking for he's looking for the bride that's moving on any man in the spirit amen by the Word of God it's the old butter toe but a mystery it's Christ in us the hope of glory it is a mystery hey man so I trust you're living in the spirit and you're walking in the spirit and the more you live in it the more you walk in it the more conscious you become a of Christ of the resurrection the rapture and the dating Christ amen by the grace of God they come to us we're going to them by the grace of God but it's gonna be by faith gonna have that faith that revelation God Elvis amen grace in Chapter eight of Romans our brother read these scriptures verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God and if you're not led by the Spirit you're not a son or daughter of God for as many as are led by the Spirit of God make sure it's the Spirit of God not the spirit of the devil and it says they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear now but ye have received the spirit of adoption amen and I'm going to share with you another thought of the Prophet concerning adoption and not only adoption but adoption and the rapture so we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God amen and if children then heirs and heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together amen to suffer with him the glory be glorified together with him amen and again verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen I trust we have that faith we're looking for we're looking for the promise of God in the world that He has promised where is a lack that he has promised where is bride a man brother sister then so that is not dream world is not fairytales but it is thus saith the Lord and brother it becomes more real to us than a dream becomes more real to us than fairytales amen brother I pray that we have their faith the prophet of God say he said what your favor of the else is more real than what your sight sees a man I trust the resurrection the rapture is more than real than the seat you're standing by and all the seats that you'll sit in or it comes to the Ministry of the word that's going forth naturally I pray that the revelation is more real than the natural a man that we are catching the revelation we're catching the spiritual for a revelation that God has ordained for us to see and what God wants us to hear a man now the mechanics of the word but the dynamics of the word amen for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen for the creature was made subject of vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope amen it is the Blessed hope amen because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together under now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit amen the firstfruits and again our brother highlighted what is the first fruit it is the downpayment I got the downpayment of redemption I got the downpayment of the resurrection and the rapture amen in my heart and in my soul bear with me as let me repeated again as that is written in the word you and the quicken you have they made alive you as he resurrected who were dead in sins and trespasses so I've I got the down payment of the resurrection amen and I got the down payment of the rapture because he has quickened us and we have been raised up into heavenly places in Christ where the word is revealed a man so I've been I've been quickened into the resurrection I've been quickened into the rapture by the grace of God a man if spiritually I've been caught up spiritually I've been raptured spiritually into heavenly places in Christ amen but the naturally I'm believing for the natural resurrection and the natural strand a physical rapture of our bodies by the grace of God this is tremendous amen so I had been and I will be a man and just think J and we had been brother in this day in this hour is not believing that we're going to die and then we're going to be resurrected we're going to die then we're gonna be raptured no no we're gonna we're going to experience resurrection and rapture without dying physically I got the resurrection in me now I got the rapture in me now amen so God has raised this generation in this age amen to bridge to manifest the resurrection literally amen we're not going to go over here just wait for the Lord do this no the Lord has come a man instead and he's fleshing us to bring forth the natural and the physical resurrection and the rapture a man and that's what those dead in Christ are waiting on blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit to down payment even we ourselves he's a groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit or to know the redemption of our body god bless his words you may be seated we are in the cycle bear with me for a little I'll try not to be too long and I try not to think as long as our brother the Fontaine took a man but I know I have but I'll try we'll see but we are in the cycle of the seventh seal amen we're in the para redemption brings us to the climax of redemption Amen that's where this is where God has brought us and this is why he sent the prophet this is why he opened the seven seals because we're what was what was the need of the hour the need of the hour is resurrection and rapturing faith so why God does God God will do what he wants to do and he'll reveal what he wants to reveal but for to give us the faith that pleases him in this day and it's our goddamn through the agency revealed err what would give the people the faith that would please God in the first age right on down to the to this last stage brother even if evident of the Pentecostal eggs allowed to CH God revealed and God did what what would give the the Saints to see the seed of God the faith that would please them in their day and in their hour a man that God wasn't looking for this faith back here God wasn't looking for this faith not even back here and he wasn't looking to differ for even Luther's faith back here no no but he because the enemy we know the enemy got in and and he took at all and and he brought in this he brought in that so that people began to move away from pain and to begin into a Creed and a doctrine and denomination a man a man so it wasn't it wasn't faith that they were walking in faith or living in faith not by any means so the total darkness became into the church but God promised that he was gracious and I will restore said the Lord now understand that God permits all of this for a reason hey man it is not just God letting the devil do this letting the devil do that you know and when the devil doesn't he gets the victory over God no no he don't get no victory over God a man God permits him to do it because all power in heaven and earth is in the Lord and he's got power over the devil a man and so what it was the devil did in the first age God had allowed him to do it when he came in and began to sow the seeds of the creeds and doctrines and denominational Creed's a man so got it out of the soul the seed got it out of the water the seed a man and it was to bring out the faith of his elect it is to bring of the faith of the seed of God in those ages a man it was serpent seed and the seed of God a man brother thank God we can look back through the revelation of the word in this hour in this age concerning what God has done we look back with understanding and with revelation that God allowed this God allowed this gotta love that then brother and previous agents didn't know what God was doing it didn't know why God did it but you and I can look back and see that it was God a man a God was showing who he was God was officer showing you though the devil was and what he was doing and what guy and what the devil was doing but he permitted it all with a promise he said I ain't said the devil is going to do this what that was going to do that but he said I will restore said the Lord I'm going to do this a man God hole hallelujah brother see God why why did God permit what he permitted in the Garden of Eden why did God permit the fall a man in the Garden of Eden in that first creation in that natural creation it was so God could reveal himself as Lord and Savior because God could reveal his character and his love for his sons and his daughters hey man why so that so that he would get your love back to him amen he would love him for himself you were loving because of his character you would love it because of his nature ain't man not because all I was lost and the Lord saved me so I love him because he saved me no no your you are seeing the revelation of God as a son a daughter you're seeing revelation of your father a man and you love your father oh my that's my father and he's doing this and he's to be there I was born in sin I was shaped in iniquity I come to the world speaking lies a man and an ISA Laura and Daeng God had mercy on us God came down to help us God came though they gave us a revelation to get us back to him hey man back to Eternity again by the grace of God a man so brother who's God revealing himself that's why he'll nobody allowed in in in the Garden of Eden and so brother but why did God allow what he allowed here in the church ages it was the naturally the Garden of Eden and here is the spiritual in the in the church Jesus a man that when God left Israel and God left the Jews to call the people out of the Gentiles on to his name and is to provoke Israel to jealousy because God was forever married to backsliding Israel a man choices were provoked Israel to jealousy he would go coming as Christ a man he becoming the flesh as Christ and even call it a the Gentiles the people for his name a man and it is provoking Israel to jealousy and brother and what he allowed in the church agents you know the enemy to come in and again he warned them that this was going to happen and that was going to happen in the church ages a man Eddie should I have somewhat against thee in the first age because thou has left thy first love and it was it was God that Allah allowed the enemy to come in a lot another spirit to come in a man and they didn't did not denying the word but they moved out of the leadership of the Holy Ghost into the leadership of man under the influence of Satan a man an antichrist spirit there was the spirit of Christ but there was also the spirit of the Antichrist a man but again God allowed it and God permitted it because as God was revealing himself down through the ages as our Everly father God was going to reveal himself as our say for their church ages a man giving us power over all the power of the enemy praise the Lord he was revealing himself as our Heavenly Father now you're reveal himself as our Lord and our Savior a man praise the name of the Lord all praise the Lord not because we're Jews when I Jews movig a world were Gentiles but God said out of their will I call the people for my name amen and he said I because there has left thy first love and he told the repent but he said this thou has the ATIS a man if you're the seat of God no matter what age you're in whether you hate anything that is that is contrary to what God has said in his word a man you hate anything is contrary to the will of God for your life a man by the grace of God but this though as that the eighth is the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate a man what is the deeds of the Nicolaitans well that is a spirit that started in the first stage the enemy would came in brother yes it was in Genesis in the Garden of Eden it was God and had him and but the enemy came in and any influenced Eve a man and he got Eve to doubt the Word of God he got Eve to believe the word plus a man to head to the word hey but what for for the plea to please the flesh brother we're not here to please the flesh we're here to please our souls we're here to please Leah near the inside of the inside not the outside amen yeah we know that God has put the curse on the outside hey man hey buddy he's got a geek gave us a promise of redemption but it's going to be from the inside out by the grace of Almighty God and so brother as it was in the Garden of Eden so it is here in the first church ain't God God went down and gave His Word and but but the enemy came in a man to challenge the Word of God the enemy came in to interpret the word the deeds of the Nicolaitans a man as if the devil came into the first age a man and there were those under the anointing of Satan Satan spirit the Antichrist spirit and they begin today they interpreted the Word of God the way the way that they wanted have been made to believe in a man brother sister the deeds of the Nicolaitans it is to turn them away from the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth it is to interpret the truth it was to interpret the word amen it was the get man to do to translate the word this way to understand the word this way but God said I said this though is that the hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans the seed of God in that age did not like that spirit where desperately it led to the two denominations this is where denominationalism started the denominations that we are surrounded by the day brother we can trace it back to you know some back back a hundred years some back 300 from back 500 by brother the spirit of a denomination we can trace it right back to the first certchange amen and it is the deeds of the Nicolaitans God showed his word but the enemy came into soul is interpretation of the word a man o God said this yay but it means this you can still do this you can still do that but God didn't want us to add to it God didn't want us to take from it God wants to leave his word the way that he gave it a man and then that he would he would give us more and more understanding as the agents went on but the enemy got in and challenged him and he brought in those beats and he began to take well they're all man was under God's control but may the devil began to get into man and control the church a man not following the leadership of the Holy Ghost it was the leadership of the Holy Ghost the devil a man in the religious people who are still professing to believe the message still professor to believe the Word of God but again God allowed it because it would bring up more and more of the revelation of God amen got it out at an Eden to bring out a greater revelation of him for his sons and daughters God allowed an area in the church ages to bring out a greater revelation of him again for his sons and daughters a man and then he would leave the Jews and he would go to the Gentiles and call it a them of people for his name a man praise the name of the Lord so brother sister we look back and we see the revelation of God we're not seeing the devil were seeing that we're seeing God we do see the devil trying to interpret the word that ever trying to deceive the seed of God but we see God it's there all the time amen and you know what God knows that what he does when he does it where he doesn't have he does it he knows his seed is gonna recognize it Amen sons and daughters are not going to be to see amen brother sister but the seed of God are going to recognize it and they're going to stay with it and that's why God in the few Indian delayed the first church eh brother when they were when Paul moved from the the Jews to the Gentiles a man the few that stayed with the Word of God I believe God see right this was the darkness coming in and the darkness increased increased increased increase amen until finally the public God said until finally it was total darkness and he said I put that there and he said but the angel in the end when the prophet of God was preaching the church ages a man and he and he would preach of this and the probably God he had a draught on paper by the a but the pillar of fire come in and the angel came in and he drew it on the wall yeah it's amazing they're those that were there at the time that he was ministering this they saw that that angel come in and they saw or the pillar fire and drew it on the wall and the part of God says you noticed he said he said that when he drew and he said he didn't leave a needle or any white there and he said it was all dark a man so brother you and I know that to be the truth you and I are witnesses of that we're living in that hour that age when it is total darkness it is organized religion that controls the world it is organized religion that's controlling where weather is America whether it's United States where they're singing but any so-called Christian nation it is organized religion a man that controls it it is denomination and they're identifying where and brother the polygons that I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and what he indict he was indicted East which we thought well one time we did will say what was denominations they were crucifying Christ they crucified the Word of God what God was doing down through the ages the organized religions began they were moved against it and what God did in this last age for the Ministry of William Branham it was organized religion that's that they begin to move the gates what God had done amen that's that's the absolute truth and he even to the Pentecostals and so on they moved against it they they they were putting that ministry down they wanted to get rid of that ministry a man it was organized religion that was doing it denominationalism that was doing it that's why in this hour they are totally against the the truth and what God has done and what God is doing brother I turn it if they're still looking for it up the road but they're not recognizing what God has done and what God is doing a man they don't knowing what God has done and they're denying what God is doing a man so the only ones we're going to really recognize it as they ought to recognize it is the Bride of Christ amen brother the only one they're going to recognize and all my brothers sister again let me repair it say this they are looking for the resurrection sure you know what after you believe in the resurrection yes do you believe they're out for yes oh when it's are going to happen well we don't know it'll be down the road oh no no it's already in process Amen God is already working on it hallelujah hey man God has already done this done this done that well fortune told that he give us the right expectations that our brother Fontaine was ministering on true or false expectations amen but again our brother sister Russell we got the true expectation why because we see what God has done and we see and believe what God is doing amen brother Dan to recognize what God is doing we had to recognize what he did in the Ministry of Malachi for a man we had to recognize what he did in the Ministry of a man called William Branham but they turned it down the nominations turned it down organized religion turned it down they they wanted nothing to do with it as well as if we know there's a certain evangelist someone mentioned a name but you know a certain evangelist he went out and he spoke to brother Branham and he said brother Branham you got to stop preaching those things just think a Pentecostal evangelists known around the world brother and any signs and wonders in his old ministry but again it was only healing anyway it wasn't the sign of the prophet of Godhead it's a journey of the thoughts and the intents of the heart as one brother said he said and and I remember attending that brothers can meetings in in just outside the lowest point intersection there and there's a there's a church there on the highway and that brother came here and he AE and some special meetings and he said he said one time and he said listen and he said when it comes to William Branham he said - he said you could put bullet wound implanted in one side of the scale and he said he said the balance out he said that the ministry of William Branham he said you'd have to have 24 he said of us in the other side he said of each of the balance ISA with with her brown brother he was acknowledging that it was God he was a knowledge that it was a ministry like the ministry that Jesus ain't discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart by the grace of God and every day sign in his hand a man deserting spirits he take - and it was in his left hand he take your left hand and so on anyway and he would know what was wrong with you by that sign a man it was hard to heart a man so yeah that's right and he had the deserted sign and then the angel told him after is to start using those signs and he should because the people are leaning on a signpost and there are believers today that are leaning on a signpost and looking for God to send the proverb bearing with signs and wonders brother our trailer there's the sign days that God wants us to get our attention with it's a sign of the resurrection it is a sign of the rapture it is a sign of the change of our bodies amen it is not us they're just getting healed it is not just experiencing all wonderful experience and we're happy and we're joyful no brother the joy is gonna be more in our souls than in our flesh amen then the love is more in our souls than in the flesh as it were so brother sister so it's gone doing this God to be that in us and for us babe and brothers it's a give us it's the resurrection it is the rapture by the grace of God we're not looking for it we're experiencing it hey buddy we are moving into it by the grace of God where they were getting more and more and more aware of the Resurrection more and more aware of the rapture and brother and the more we get conscious of the rapture and the resurrection the less we get conscious of what's going on in this world that is the absolute truth you're not going to cut off with this we're going to cut off with with the anointing of the kingdom of God now the kingdoms of Maine is the kingdom of God amen Jesus there was a first a second pulled in his ministry and he was caught up with this he was caught up with that describes the Pharisees and the Romans and so on but then it came to a time in his life in a time in his ministry the third pole brother we're all mine the only thing that he that he got caught up with was was what he was ordained to do a man in the Alpha ministry what he came to do Hey even the it took fulfillment of the scroll hallelujah sod me lady Arkansas any man he will fulfill the scripture he did this he did that a man but now they came the third Pole a man are these ministry ball my brother's sister what he was ordained to do not just a sign and they he had signs of wonders a man but he had to lay those signs and wonders aside a man because he was going to manifest the great sign and the great wonder hallelujah and what is the great sign of the great wonder of the awful ministry it was the resurrection and the rapture amen amen oh yeah when it's Redemption yell but again to redeem us he had to lay his life down and he had to pick it up amen and to redeem us he had to go back up in a rapture and put and for what put that body by the throne of God and the father said he what did he do it I asked one brother one died what happened to the body of Jesus he said he went out and he said oh I believe you when I went out to the desert somewhere just sort of dropped it I said what you believe that oh yeah sadly no no I said the probably God said and he didn't know it either the puddle of God said he said Jesus he said he said he laid it down and any shed his perfect blood for the redemption of my lord thank God he said public send this world to redeem us from our sin Amen my brother sister all the the city and the Lord it had the life of that blood could come back to us neither life of the blood of a natural lamb but the lamb of God and he laid down his life in a shed perfect sinless blood for the redemption of our bodies and brother for the forgiveness and the doing away of our our sins we're all cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness the blood that was shed anymore praise the name of the Lord and no man don't make aliyah charge against God's elect hey man because the sin is in the sea about forgetfulness this is amazing amen God I believe that faith hey man don't let the devil could have you God's not going to condemn you the devil can't Khattak you sure if he did that God say what do you mean they did this dude I don't see nothing hey man why because he came as a perfect sacrifice amen and he should absolutely sinless blood hey man so the life that I'd like to come back to you and me by the grace of Almighty God but this is what Jesus did this is what God did ain't man to redeem us not just physically but not only spiritually but physically and he lay down his life he raised it up again and he raptured to go up bought to carry that body to go up with that body and he said it before the throne of God as a sign that Redemption was accomplished that it was then amen nothing else was left to do except to give that life to you and me by the grace of God and he come back of the day of Pentecost in the form of the Holy Ghost amen and he came in us the life that was in the body called Jesus is now in the body called mrs. Jesus Christ so he said I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you and then he said you'll know that you were in the father the father of me I in you you and me you talk about a one as we are one with God God is to the lead a man the absolute truth of the word of God that we are the sons and daughters of God by the way and we work for the foundation of the world sons and daughters are gone hey man brother job a that revelation I trust we got it hey man now that I became a son a daughter god I was a son a daughter of God we are sons and daughters were gone and we were before the foundation of the world because God said Joel where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth when the morning stars sang together and so anyway it was the ministry and the sons of God saying for joy and joy knew he was there he was there amen praise the name of the Lord praise the name of Anor he had that revelation hallelujah and brother we got that revelation that's where we come from but we got allow this to happen to reveal himself and we love the Lord and we accept what he has done and he's taking us back hey man we're going back to Eternity we're going back to the kingdom of God amen old brothers sister I trust my grace please said the name of the Lord that will let the Holy Ghost make the kingdom of God more real than what's going on around us but for so many today so many Christians so many believers even the this world is more real and the things of this world are more real than the kingdom of God that is true the kingdoms of man is more real and well there were more conscious I was going on here than what's going on in the kingdom of God but if we are the sons and daughters of God we're getting less and less conscious of this and more and more countries are what God is doing a made more more conscious of what God wants us to do anyway we're really where we're hearing more and more the footage of this world we're more we're hearing God we're hearing God where he the Word of God the will of God what do you want me to do Lord my will don't be done amen we're coming to that same place that Jesus came to in the third pole of his ministry a man named what he faced a man any man nobody had to endure know anybody he was going to add the supper for therefore your Redemption and for my Redemption amen hey man hold brother sister II see and he cried he said as it were great drops of blood amen sweat as the word great drops of blood just think of that brother we're gonna be under that stress oh yes because the more and more pressure is coming down on the church more of our pressures coming down on the bride oh yeah more and more pressure came down on Jesus amen now it's Christ in the bag and more and more pressures coming down that's why he indited this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus senators eviction of the world it's in the flesh of the bird and brother it wasn't just yesterday nominations he said his denominations nondenominational inter denominations amen he brought that out of the message of the indictment and we think is a trustee nominations no it's non denominations and enter denominations a million and brother there are those groups even around the the message so-called that are that are there what they're getting of the second crucifixion of the word oh no brother there's no yes it will brother Judas was now there he wasn't with the scribes and the Pharisees shooters with us was one of the disciples amen and the part of God referred to juda Starion s-- he said pretended brothers amen and they are there as well what for they're going to betray the bride oh yeah they're not going to say well I don't believe in the message I don't believe with a brenda was a prophet but they're going to betray the brownie and what the bride is preaching what the bride is teaching whether brighter sanity for whether right is looking for a man so brother I'm not worried about what's going on over there what's going on around the message it's going to be on your heels a man when Judas betrayed the Lord and kissed him it is you betrayed you betray your your friend they said with a kiss yeah Jesus knew and yet the disciples it is there were lose one who's one of Jesus and one of you she'll betrayed me just like they didn't deserve Jesus's spirit they didn't know what Judas was like they didn't what your this problem was but Jesus did a man even after the fact Jesus said he said I not chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil a man brother let's make sure we got the right spirit on us hey they got Collier action sure to make sure that we got the right anointing of the Holy Ghost amen that is Christ in me the hope of glory amen that brother I'm the one that that I'm healing myself to the Lord for the Lord to bring forth a manifest his word in me through me amen by the grace of God what is it the resurrection the rapture all the Lord I want to experience the resurrection in the rapture in my soul I want to experience it in my body when I pray the grace of God that the revelation of the resurrection rapture is coming out coming out coming out hallelujah and I'm getting more and more control over my flesh I'm getting more and more control a man over death hell and the grave amen more more controlling what is it it's the resurrection of rapture in us amen brother all down through the ages they got ready to die but now we're getting rid of them amen brother wait someone's going to add that revelation I trust this you and me got that revelation of the resurrection rapture because the Providence came the Prophet is gone the seals have been opened the revelation has been made know the mystery of God has been made known the mystery of the Resurrection the mystery of their answer as we made known brother sister it was anyone ought to have that faith now it's the Bride of Christ because God's not going to do anything else now it's in the in the hands of the right it was in the hands of Jesus and he wrestled and he wrestled and he wrestled and God sent an angel to strengthen him and God said well your theophany is there to strengthen you and to encourage you yeah probably Gossage or theophany if not 12 feet from you in any given time not more than 12 feet yeah and he says sometimes he said he draw your theophany were drawn here to encourage you or sometimes to convict you but if you're weaker need need encouragement easier theophany would draw near to encourage you you pull away to convict you you'll wonder Oh Oh Lord what have I done you repent and he comes close to you amen praise the name of the Lord I trust by the grace of God our theophany is getting closer and closer and closer - brother we come together anyway does he often ease as the saints that are gone on that our own theophanies a may come together oh yeah and then we're going to be changed instantly into glorified bodies and raptured oh yeah the prophet of God so we'll get together yeah you will get together with the Saints that are gone on and then he said we're going to be changed amen praise the name of the Lord old brother sister grace that we believe it rain so we believe it with all of our hearts we truly believe it that we believe it more than we believe what's going on in this world a man that our faith is in that not in what's going on it there we know the worlds come to an end we know it's finished we know where the world's gone insane it is when you know go there and see what's going on out there in the world it's insane as I said Oh mom look if 40 years ago my father would our or even more longer than that now 50 years ago maybe that father would look out there and he would see see see a certain ones dressed way they were dressed or activated they were acting and my father would say oh they should be in the Waterford well you know what that is the Waterford Hospital yeah oh I've heard say that because why he just didn't agree with it oh yeah oh he would speak he would speak heeding the even to his own family and he would tell him this and you tell him that and so on yeah cuts up the faith that he had they they said did other Christians used to compensate mr. lush you know how in the world do you know this how in the world do you know that he's I read my Bible every day and he said he said I believe I believe the Bible and he said well what why do you remember this remember that he said well I don't I read it I said and one of those other things and he said I read it and I said forget what I read Oh because he amazed so many people with his faith oh yeah and he would get there get up there and testify in the church and and it won't point there he got and no doubt he oh they they used to say oh there's he got something wrong with his brain that's what they used to say why because he get up and you know only and he testify about their boat boat righteousness and holiness and so on and because about back that time that the sisters started to wear their skirts a little bit shorter and and he made a remark concerning certain things like that and and they just didn't like it got to the place where they didn't want him to testify oh yeah brother get to the place where they won't want your testimony oh yes because it's going to be so far so far away from what you're standing for and what you believe they won't want your testimony No amen brothers the Bible the Bible Santos concerning the last days and our perilous it's going to become painless terms and it says not only that it says the you you're going to the daughter won't even love the mother that's what it says and it's going this is going to happen that's going to happen so are we going to still stay with the word what brother I tell you to this Jesus he stated the word amen but again as I said his disciples went to sleep naturally but now they're going to sleep spiritually oh yeah he's here in the bride now he's in the Omega ministry now anyway it is the third pole it is getting ready for the resurrection of rapture my brother for us to be ready for the resurrection rapture we got to be totally dead to ourselves amen we got to be dead to our thoughts and our minds and and our feelings and our senses so we're not living for that we're living for Jesus we're living for God we're living with the resurrection I do this well I got a do but brother when it comes to the natural things but III just go so far as God wants me to go and but I want I'm not gonna lay lay aside my spiritual responsibility amen no way brother how many of us got the anointing of the Resurrection do you know any of the rapture are expecting and looking for the resurrection rapture looking for the kingdom of God brother more and more I tell you this as time goes on more and more we're going to get so caught up with this world and the kingdoms of this world that they're not even to think about the kingdom of God I'll tell you this if you got the Holy Ghost hey man you got the anointing for this hour for this age you got if you're in you're a part of the third pole of the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ in this hour brother you're going to get more caught up and more thoughts about the resurrection about the rapture but the kingdom of God a man then about this world what is more real to us tonight is it this world or that one the more we walk in the spirit the more we live in the spirit the more real that world becomes and the less we are interested in this one in fact as I said Jesus said he was there listen Sadie was our example brother of his Christ in us will be like him and brother our real was the kingdom of God to Jesus he said no man has gone up except he that came down even the Son of man who is who is as tremendous who is than ever not many read that would regret could get a revelation they just read it go on well that's the Bible yeah but what does it mean if no man hath ascended up only he that came down even as on a man who is in heaven he is I thought you were here yeah but he said I'm up there he was in theophany was there a man we buy pastor a theophany he didn't bypass is a man because of sin we buy pastor theophany but yerba theophany is your guardian angel to bring you back any man but Jesus he said how long shall I be with you that kingdom of God was so real to Jesus that he didn't want to be here much longer how long should I be with you oh yeah he wanted to go and so finally he entered that faith that revelation that third pole What did he say he said I am no more in the world he knew he was moving from from one that that phase of the ministry right into the third phase of his ministry and he was going to go he had pay a price he was one that supper but he said I'm no more in the world because this phase was the ministry was going to take him back to the kingdom of God anyway and brother he sent the life of his blood back to us to created us to say my Ungar Fame thirst amen the same cry for the kingdom of God amen brother I turn to this so that their drama bride I'm on the earth in the AL end in the Omega ministry there'll be a brave there will say as Jesus said I've no more in the world yep any man because you'll get so far away from the world the things of the world hey man that that is the kingdom of God oh praise the Lord I'm no more in the world I'll soon behold Lord anybody I'll soon be there yeah thank God God's a man son it's like I told you when I was going through that darkness trying to reach the pillar of fire it was hard why because everything around me was black dark it was dark and and I was climbing over rocks and around rocks and I was stumbling I get up and I keep looking at the pillar of fire well one point there was so hard I looked up but the pillar fire and I said Lord I said will I make it I don't want to fail this I want to make it and he said son he says you'll make it but he said it's going to be hard press on and I came out of another vision yeah same with us when we come to the climax of the third pole the climax of the resurrection and rapture revelation brother it's going to be heard I too know this is not the world we lived in five years ago there's not the world we lived in a year ago everything is changing oh yeah everything's getting more and more and more insane amen and everything is getting less and less spiritual I'm not saying they're not religious person less spiritual amen but the wise virgin she's got the extra Hall of her land to keep her moving but the foolish virgin prophet said she's a virgin yeah but she's foolish because she's never had the extra and he said the Prophet said that foolish virgin will go through the Great Tribulation and they'll be they'll had to lay down their lives amen but they're not bright the bride is the wise virgin grace to his brother sister that we're going to have the true expectations of the revealed word for this hour the true expectations of the third pal of the ministry of Christ in this age it wasn't the Ministry of Jesus or William Branham it was the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ amen the public are told us a number of times he says this is not me this is him and he said it he said I am NOT the son of man he said I am a son of man he's revealing this on a man and he said that's your problem he says you can't see the other angel amen god help us to see the other angel amen so we say the real revelation and what is it pointing to it's not just pointing to Jesus as saying I'm the same yesterday today and forever I'm the healer I do this I do that no it's the resurrection and the rapture what was the revelation oh my lord hallelujah thank you Jesus if any revelation brother God wants us to believe is that he's the resurrection and he's the rapture amen what was the revelation that he asked Martha said I am the resurrection I am the rapture or I had the resurrection he said believest thou this oh she said first he said Lazarus arise oh I believe he'll rise in the resurrection up there but she was talking to the resurrection she was talking to the resurrection he said jesus said all but he said I am NOT I will be I am the resurrection amen he said not only resurrection he was the rapture a man he raised up but he also was cut off in the cloud of angels and so on and he said if anyone any II that liveth and believeth in me shall never die and though he were dead yet shall he live a man praise the Lord so I pray great grace that we have that revelation that not not I will be the rapture I will be the resurrection I am the resurrection anybody it's the revelation of God in this hour the revelation of Jesus in this hour in the present tense brother God has not passed he's not future he's present tense I am the Lord I change not yeah he's the East yeah on the present one not not another past tense not a future tense of present tense Amen with God he sees it all now it's done oh yeah no Lord just got after noises what it's done because why I got the names on the book of life all the names all the redeemed it's there it's there it's there yeah what God sees is one thing what we see is another but God wants us to see what he sees hey man let's see the resurrection let's see the rapture praise them all my lord APIs that we're going to get away from the thoughts of this world world caught up with this whole world come up with the foolish shoes of this all we want to do this we want to do that no right well the anointing in me is the rapture do you 90 in you is there is the rapture in the resurrection grace this is real see what your faith that the prophecy watch our faith sees declares this more read than what your site tells you so my site physically not we're seeing the foolishness of this world but it's it's causing me to be more and more conscious of the spiritual yeah and it's not me that lives it's it's the anointing in me it's Christ in me that's living and if it's Christ in me living there were conscious of what Christ is doing if Christ is very very conscious of what God is doing but conscious of what you want not what he just had done yes but what he's doing what is he doing well he did this what for to give us resurrection and rattray pay he opened the seals what was it by the said the third pool he says rapturing faith praise the name of the Lord oh praise the Lord two pages of notes but I only I haven't got to the first paragraph now we have a true expectation for the rapture for the resurrection priests bad are really much do you really want to see sister coffee how much do you want to see sister Dartford how much do we want to see our brother and sister burns again for our brother sister cater brother sister man you do we miss them Oh some don't even miss him I tell you if you're living in the spirit walking in the spirit you miss him because they're in the spirit yeah Jesus was missing those that that he associated with and he knew was back in the kingdom of God oh yeah so how much do we miss those that are going on probably God did tell did say he said I believe he said that when we're getting near our time to go he said we're gonna be we're gonna be missing those that are gone on we're gonna be hungry and thirsting for their fellowship again are you afraid of it think you know well I don't want it to want to die why well maybe maybe that hunger thirst for fellowship with them doesn't mean that you want to die it means that you're going to live you're gonna go and live where they are living in the kingdom of God you're going to the old brother-sister is the Prophet God sir they're waiting on us they are they're waiting on us to get to get into that right place we know that any Christ shall rise first and then we then we which are alive remain shall be changed and caught up with them to meet Lord in the air yeah but you got it you got to be calling then you got to be wanting to fellowship with them if you don't want to fellowship with it you won't beat you won't fellowship winner you got to want fellowship with Jesus if you don't you want to have it you got want fellowship with those that are gone on and the closer we get to the change of our bodies the closer we get to the resurrection rapture the climax of a brother we're going to hunger thirst all for those saints that were with us and that we had fellowship with Oh Lord we want to fellowship with him again we're hungry we're thirsting we're longing Lord not to go by way of the grave but to go by way of the resurrection and the rapture there's too many our people are still too conscious of the grave yeah I pray God would work up more more conscious of the rapture amen brother I told it the longer we the more we get into the word the more we get into the word the more we're going to focus on the rapture and the resurrection don't let the devil control your thoughts don't have the devil control your mind only did that will control your soul or your spirit if Christ is in you brother you're gonna be thinking on the resurrection rapture he said I am the resurrection and he is the rapture by the grace of God mazie thank god we're going where there is no time just think listen he said now it's got to a place to where Pentecostal church with the Neuse birth as been tested and tried and God doesn't deal with the church as just an organization he deals he does God doesn't deal with the church that way he doesn't deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church God is dealing with you oh well I go to this church that yeah but Jesus go with you that's the important thing and he says no secret we all see it when a man proves and God and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself and there in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up there in the presence of God and gifts him and fills him and sets him out and he said that's the age that we are living in a man what is it it's the age of adoption that God is going out to bring his sons and daughters in for the full adoption and the climax of the adoption is the rapture that's right and he said the same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutheran's that sanctified the Methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus and he said when it will be so powerful that the body will come into the group this group of a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave so powerful hallelujah the anointing will be in this assembly it'll draw the Saints you have gone on out of the grace they'll draw them from that dimension into this dimension amen and then we're going to be changed hallelujah they're waiting on us amen Lazarus waiting on Jesus yeah Jesus called his name yeah praise the Lord he must have recognized the voice of Jesus praise the name of the Lord and he said when it will be so powerful the coming of the Lord Jesus so powerful that body will come into this group of church is he in us tonight grace is he in your house in your home is it with you in your job so that it's not you it's Christ in you each that will draw the rest of them from the grave and there will be a resurrection he said that's what the Holy Ghost is for he said what is the Holy Ghost he said without us they cannot be made perfect he said they lived in one day under that we live in another day amen but now he said when we needed the Spirit of God he said raises a standard and he said what is it he is pulling in his spirit and he said then those who are resting out yonder the grave or under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying how long how long how much longer he said God is waiting on me and you amen he said the church is waiting on me and you yeah adoption time yeah the rapture is adoption time confirmation of our adoption as sons and daughters of God he said where you are me and you adoption time and he said when God can pour to us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till close becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture a man alleluia alleluia he's waiting on us to get into the spirit of rapture in faith to get into the spirit of the resurrection by the grace of God now we're going to say and show you after a while that just those who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes in the rapture the rest of the Dead lived not again for the space of a thousand years that's right the Holy Spirit filled people was all that went in the rapture you better make your call and election sure to walk in the spirit and live in the spirit you've got to be filled with the spirit and it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is Christ in me and you you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost that's right he said the Holy Spirit has spoke to you and you publicly confessed him the devil has the same thing I believe him to be the Son of God so does the devil but you're walking on towards him and when Peter had been called and justified by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus sanctified them through the word for the word was the truth amen is like on the day of Pentecost when they were preaching and the scribes and the Pharisees went out you know and just criticized the disciples that were preaching Jesus and Oh Peter yeah you Peter you're the one that ran away from Jesus when he was crucified and now you're here preaching Jesus yeah and even though they they were forbidden to preach Jesus he kept preaching Jesus they were amazed that Peter had changed yet why it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Christ revealed in Peter and through Peter praise the Lord bear with me he gave them power against unclean spirits and they went out he put their names in the Lamb's Book of Life and they come back rejoicing and said even the devils is subject to us and he said don't rejoice because the Devils are subject unto you but rejoice because your names he says in the book Judas was with them and so how close he can come right on up through justification sanctification and where did he show his light where did he show itself before Pentecost Judas showed his colors before the resurrection rapture many a professing believer going to show their colors and many are showing their colors now by looking for a return ministry or a tenth vision tenth meeting I said well I'm in the tenth meeting yeah he said what's that spirit will be just as pious and just as sanctimonious as it can be until it comes to the Holy Ghost and they'll cut it right off he said can't you see it moving up it's the Antichrist jesus said they'd be so close together in the last days it would deceive the very elect if possible so you better make your calling election short because he said these so close are deceive the very elect if possible don't worry but what's out there it's what's around the message our brother the Fontaine brought out some of those things and highlighted some of those things a man that's right so let's make sure that if we're in the message well that's good but make sure that we're not part of the group that's so close and we deceive the very elect impossible so you better be careful I know there's there's much on the internet and there's some dust good and some not so good so make sure that that one of them had don't add that spirit that it deceive you deceive the very like that possible and many are going to be deceived and many are being deceived that's right my message people preaching the message testifying of the message this the message distant message you better get God's leadership in your life you better get Holy Ghost discernment in your life in your heart and in your soul brother this is serious if it's so close it would deceive the very elect it has to be within our ranks yeah did I say it was within the ranks of the disciples in the days of Jesus oh yeah and not only that Paul the messenger that first church age he warned that there were many false prophets and apostles and everything preaching the message the first church eh he said behind their guard because they'll deceive many and in this hour it'd be so closer would deceive the very land he said God calls by election our new people here tonight knowing that something in your heart tugging I want that only spirit I want you Lord in my heart he sir that's because God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world all my dear friends from around this country and in this little city if I could only with my human voice place into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh it would be the most wonderful revelation that you ever had in your life to see what you must do it he said let us make that clear about you're not converted Peter had been saved he believed on the Lord followed him Jesus told him he was had to follow him he gave him power against unclean spirits and sanctified him and yet Jesus said the night of his betrayal lovest thou me Peter you know he followed him and followed him and followed him and yet Jesus questioned Islam it's Jesus questioning your love for him for one another Holy Ghost love grace amen I'll have to stop there he said the only way that you can say that Jesus is the Christ is when the Holy Ghost comes into you and bears record and witness itself he is the son of God that's the only way you know the resurrection is when the Holy Ghost bears record in you amen finish with this question will the bride be gathered together in one place at the rapture yeah I said the bride will be gathered together one place that is true but not until the resurrection we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are sleep universally for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and we shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air therefore the bride will be caught up together the bride will all be together when it goes to meet the Lord a man but we're going to get together here a man we're going to blend together here Jesus is going to get us together Jesus is going to unite us but then he's going to go up and get into that body and come down to receive us unto himself amen jesus said when the Son of man shall appear he said I said it be like the light that shines from east even unto the west he said the whole thing there will be a resurrection and a rapture and away it'll go he said when I say we then I mean by grace I believe by faith I believe it in the in His grace that we will be among those people that will be caught up he said the resurrection will sit in first the resurrection of those that are asleep and there will be awakening time and those which are asleep not in sin but there'll be a still sleep those in seen will sleep right on but the others he said in the first resurrection come forth and those corruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapture in grace of the Lord and then we'll all get together and when they begin to get together we which our live remain shall be changed and these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there being like a sweet go over us and you're changed he said your turn back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman and then will gather together with them and then be caught up to meet the Lord in the air it'll be a universal rapture and the church will be all be together and after the resurrection and rapture as Citian will be together a man the grace of God be with us there's one scripture you don't have to turn to it brother Alec shared a tape with me at the house - I guess two or three weeks ago and the brother ministered on Romans 8 and equally emphasized verse five five and six again I emphasize it's the same chapter I read from as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God amen but you're not led by the Spirit of God you're not the son and daughter of God a man because you can be part of the church and part of this and part of the message but still not be a son or daughter of God and our brother on the table holded Romans 8 and verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit so what are we after the flesh or the what he fell focusing on flesh or spirit for to be carnally minded as physical focusing on the physical things of life to be currently minded focusing on the physical things of life he said his death but easier to be spiritually minded focusing on the spiritual a man he said his life and peace so let's make sure that we're not currently minded we're not controlled by the carnal mind and the thoughts and senses of our flesh no no we're controlled by the Holy Ghost amen that's life and peace but the carnal mind is death and our brother was emphasizing that even many believers are currently minded and they're dead spiritually but if if you're focusing on spiritual you're spiritually minded you think the thoughts of God you think oh what is the Lord feel why does the Lord think what is the Lord telling me you know your spiritual you talk spiritual you act spiritually you make your decisions based on spiritual revelation amen it's the Holy Ghost in you as life and peace amen it doesn't mean that it's gonna make decisions all just all that's in your favor sometimes it's God testing you and trying you our brother LaFontaine brought that out as well that this is a will of God that's the will of God sometimes is it's it's a trial or a test you're going to experience this you can experience pain and whatever it is it's called testing us amen spiritually but currently minded we want to avoid this and avoid that and avoid that no no God wants you to go through to manifest your faith amen God's gonna test us to bring out what's in our hearts by the grace of God sure brother we are in the cycle of the seventh seal we're in the power of redemption brings us to the climax of redemption and what is the climax of redemption the resurrection and the rapture of our physical bodies amen the grace of God brother sister that we're going to find ourselves in the climax of redemption he meant not just redemption order started here started here started here but where's it going to finish it begins as the Bible says it begins in your spirit in your soul in your spirit but it finishes and ends in the change of your body by the grace of God so brother God God reveals it to us but it comes to our baptism of the Holy Ghost and God's revealing to us when it comes to the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the change of our vows by the grace of God please in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's be spiritually minded now not currently minded so you're not focusing on the natural you're focusing on the spiritual because the natural is passing away this too shall pass away amen the grace of God be with us nor bless you let's stay there saying wonderful words of life sing them over again to mean
