[47:31] [Music]
[47:34] lord a higher plane of
[47:37] what victory
[47:37] higher plane of surrender
[47:42] lord a plane where we become less and
[47:44] you become more in our lives heavenly
[47:46] father
[47:48] lord may that song not just be something
[47:49] we say in church lord accompanied by
[47:52] music lord but may it be something that
[47:54] comes out of our heart every single day
[47:56] heavenly father lord that we would be
[47:58] recognizing lord the unity of christ in
[48:01] us
[48:02] lord that we would be able to see lord
[48:04] the word may manifest lord the word may
[48:06] flesh once or more in our day heavenly
[48:08] father lord it didn't stop with you it
[48:10] didn't stop with your prophets lord i
[48:12] didn't stop with a prophet in this day
[48:14] but lord you come down to be tabernacled
[48:16] in flesh among sons and daughters
[48:19] lord manifested by the falling of your
[48:21] holy spirit to bring us to a place of
[48:23] perfection lord under that righteousness
[48:25] of christ so lord we pray that you
[48:27] administer to each heart and soul that's
[48:29] here lord those that are online as well
[48:31] lord may you just speak into our lives
[48:33] lord draw us closer we pray lord forgive
[48:36] us forgive me where we fall short lord
[48:39] lord help us to just rededicate and
[48:40] commit our lives to you we pray
[48:43] in jesus christ's name we ask
[48:45] amen
[48:46] amen god bless you this evening if
[48:48] you'll turn the scriptures to genesis 6
[48:49] thank you musicians
[48:52] i'm in genesis chapter 6 certainly want
[48:53] to welcome our visitors it feels a bit
[48:55] like special meetings
[48:58] amen we got a full church and we got
[49:00] people that aren't usually here and
[49:01] whatnot so it feels a little bit like
[49:03] acts too you know where they added to
[49:05] the church daily such as were needed we
[49:07] had some go out we had some come in
[49:09] so certainly thankful for that amen to
[49:10] have my sister jessica and her husband
[49:12] jonathan and silas and alexander here
[49:14] and then brother aaron and sister lydia
[49:16] oglesby and most of you know he's also a
[49:18] minister so lord willing he'll preach
[49:20] for us on sunday so we want to keep him
[49:23] and the services and prayer of course
[49:24] and then we'll also be having the
[49:26] fellowship of brother marks at four
[49:27] o'clock on sunday afternoon so just be
[49:30] in prayer for that amen i don't believe
[49:31] god sends us a gift without a purpose so
[49:33] if we got a minister coming here on
[49:35] vacation then i believe god sends him
[49:37] with a message for the people that he's
[49:38] vacationing with amen so we're trusting
[49:41] that god will be with you brother aaron
[49:42] amen genesis chapter 6 and verse 1 says
[49:45] and it came to pass when men began to
[49:47] multiply on the face of the earth and
[49:49] daughters were born unto them that the
[49:51] sons of god saw the daughters of men
[49:53] that they were fair and they took them
[49:55] wives of all which they chose and the
[49:58] lord said my spirit shall not always
[50:00] strive with man for that he also is
[50:03] flesh yet his days shall be in hundred
[50:05] and twenty years
[50:07] there were giants in the earth in those
[50:09] days and also after that when the sons
[50:11] of god came in under the daughters of
[50:12] men and they bear children to them the
[50:15] same became mighty men which were of old
[50:18] men of renown and god saw that the
[50:20] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[50:22] and that every imagination of the
[50:24] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[50:27] continually
[50:28] and have repented the lord that he had
[50:30] made men on the earth and it grieved him
[50:32] at his heart amen god bless you you can
[50:35] take your seats this evening
[50:37] and then we want to continue on this
[50:38] little series we've been preaching on
[50:40] called in his form and with his mind and
[50:42] i want to uh
[50:44] just do maybe a quick recap for those
[50:46] that are joining us like i said with
[50:47] every service i preached we've had
[50:48] somebody else come in new it seems so
[50:50] we've been preaching about the unveiling
[50:52] of god and we we started out how how god
[50:55] was it was the great spirit the great uh
[50:58] jehovah the self-existing one and and
[51:00] then he out of that he he brought out of
[51:02] himself a light and he stepped into that
[51:04] light and that light was called the son
[51:06] of god and it was the the presence of
[51:07] god dwelling in that light and it was
[51:09] visible so that his creation could see
[51:11] him and interact with him in these
[51:13] different things and and the nature and
[51:15] life of god was within that and we saw
[51:16] it in the many different forms from that
[51:18] original light which was the pillar of
[51:20] fire and then we saw it come down into
[51:21] melchizedek and the lord that spoke with
[51:23] abraham and we saw it in the the fourth
[51:25] man in the fire and we saw it again as
[51:27] the pillar of fire after knocked paul
[51:29] off of his horse and and brother brahm
[51:31] says that's the only god we're ever
[51:32] going to see is when it's manifested in
[51:34] the son of god amen it is the life of
[51:36] god inside of an outside form and we
[51:38] read the quote where brother branham
[51:39] says when that logos came out of him it
[51:41] said he took on his first form
[51:44] right what there are many forms that he
[51:46] would take on in in his purpose and in
[51:48] his plan but the first one was light and
[51:50] he says he always goes back to light
[51:52] when he comes out of one form or another
[51:54] but that form we call is the son of god
[51:56] and that's jesus christ it's the
[51:58] anointed one and that is the only god
[52:00] we'll ever see jesus said to philip he
[52:02] says philip if you've seen me you've
[52:04] seen the father right amen and then paul
[52:06] said the son declares the father i mean
[52:08] that's the only thing that we're going
[52:09] to see of god ever is in the sun and
[52:11] that's that's why we worship jesus is
[52:13] that's why we pray to him not just
[52:15] because he's the intercessor but that's
[52:16] the form that god has put himself into
[52:18] for us to to to worship in him and we
[52:21] don't believe in the trinity we know
[52:22] godhead is way different than anybody
[52:24] else believes in it and we're not going
[52:25] to go into that but we understand that
[52:27] the son is the expression of the father
[52:29] amen and that is his first and his
[52:31] original form and then then we saw the
[52:33] path how that adam as a son of god was
[52:36] created in god's image and it was first
[52:37] in spirit form and in that spirit form
[52:40] he couldn't see feel here touch in the
[52:41] way that he could naturally later on and
[52:43] nature could not see him that his the
[52:45] very creation that was made for him
[52:47] could have no interaction with him now
[52:49] brother brown says he could lead the
[52:50] animals as the holy spirit would lead in
[52:53] what invisibly that they wouldn't be
[52:55] able to see him but he could cause
[52:56] things to be influenced in the earth but
[52:58] he says then god put him into a body
[53:00] that he could interact with his creation
[53:02] with nature with as well so adam's
[53:04] following the same trajectory as the son
[53:05] of god as god himself followed and then
[53:08] he went from spirit form into a body
[53:10] visible form that could interact with
[53:12] with with his nature and with the
[53:13] creation and he did that because he had
[53:15] a purpose because god created a place
[53:17] for adam and we know that he was placed
[53:19] on the earth but he wasn't just placed
[53:20] on the earth but it says god planted a
[53:22] garden eastward for adam specifically
[53:24] and he took them and he placed them in
[53:26] that garden of eden and he was to have
[53:27] dominion over the earth and we saw that
[53:30] that didn't just mean over the animals
[53:31] but that was over the elements of the
[53:33] earth itself and in that position he was
[53:36] perfect and in that position he had the
[53:38] very same power that jesus christ had on
[53:40] this earth we see that luke records adam
[53:42] and in his lineage it says and adam was
[53:44] what the son of god
[53:46] there's only two that were ever called
[53:48] the son of god in the scripture until he
[53:50] comes up to paul talking about us and
[53:52] that is adam and that is jesus christ
[53:54] now we see here it says sons of god in
[53:56] genesis 6 but they're in a fallen
[53:58] condition but in their original
[53:59] condition the original condition adam
[54:01] was just like jesus christ was because
[54:03] why christ was the second adam adam was
[54:06] the first son of god that was put into
[54:08] flesh form and jesus was the second one
[54:10] but he was following the same trajectory
[54:12] that god did amen but we saw how adam
[54:15] had lost his position by tying himself
[54:17] to his fallen bride and he trusted that
[54:19] the nature that tied him to her was the
[54:21] same thing that was in god in the
[54:23] beginning and that god would tie himself
[54:25] to his fallen creation and find a way to
[54:27] bring them back amen he chose to
[54:30] accompany his bride into death
[54:31] separation from god so that what god
[54:34] would do the work that he he couldn't do
[54:36] in himself amen then we showed how he
[54:38] felt because she started what conversing
[54:41] as an equal with something that was
[54:42] under her dominion i mean that something
[54:44] that was beneath her that something that
[54:46] wasn't supposed to be able to to that
[54:48] wasn't even under the law that god gave
[54:50] her was sitting there and started to
[54:52] talk to her about it and fellowship with
[54:53] her and in the end he seduced her and he
[54:55] turned her mind completely opposite to
[54:57] what god said but it started when she
[55:00] had a conversation with something that
[55:01] was under her feet and then she hid it
[55:03] from her husband and she hid it from god
[55:06] because in the cool of the evening he
[55:08] come down and brother abraham says he'd
[55:09] he'd sit down under the tree and they'd
[55:11] lay their head on his lap and he'd
[55:12] stroke their head and he'd lay them to
[55:14] sleep and there would be that peace that
[55:16] passes all understanding in his presence
[55:18] and she never mentioned that she was
[55:20] having this conversation she never
[55:22] mentioned it to her husband who was
[55:23] supposed to be in unity with her and she
[55:25] never mentioned it to the god that told
[55:27] her not to do it in the first place and
[55:29] in doing so she fell because we know
[55:31] that seduction was over time it did not
[55:33] happen in one conversation did not
[55:34] happen in one moment but she kept it a
[55:36] secret from her husband and in doing so
[55:39] she allowed herself to fall out of the
[55:40] way amen
[55:42] but we started this whole scripture and
[55:43] or this whole series in philippians
[55:45] where we read that paul said let this
[55:47] mind be in you which was also in christ
[55:50] jesus who being in the form of god
[55:52] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[55:54] god but made himself of no reputation
[55:57] and took upon him the form of a servant
[56:00] and was made in the likeness of men and
[56:02] being found in fashion as a man he
[56:04] humbled himself the first thing that the
[56:07] mind of christ does for you is it
[56:08] humbles you to a purpose
[56:10] amen he humbled himself and became
[56:12] obedient unto death even the death of
[56:14] the cross but as we come back now to
[56:17] genesis 6 we see that adam had the mind
[56:20] of christ in the beginning amen he had
[56:22] the mind of christ and the prophet god
[56:24] says adam could not be turned adam could
[56:26] not be moved from that because what he
[56:28] was a part of the original creation he
[56:31] was the one that god had originally
[56:32] spoken to and he held firm to that and
[56:34] he had no time to talk to the serpent no
[56:37] doubt maybe the serpent tribe we don't
[56:38] really know but we know that it never
[56:40] had an effect on adam he stayed apart
[56:42] from it amen but eve when she started
[56:44] listening to another voice started
[56:46] getting
[56:47] pulled away man and when she fell and
[56:48] adam joined himself they lost three
[56:50] things now go through this quickly
[56:52] because we covered it four but the first
[56:53] thing they lost was eternal life and
[56:55] they lost it immediately because as soon
[56:58] as she sinned and as soon as adam joined
[57:00] her what happened they became fearful
[57:02] and they created a covering for
[57:04] something that they didn't know they had
[57:05] before which was nakedness amen the very
[57:07] first thing that came in was fear and we
[57:09] know that perfect love casts out fear we
[57:11] know that god is love and so the very
[57:14] thing that left them was love and the
[57:15] thing that replaced it was fear and it
[57:17] drove them into what
[57:19] deeper into the garden because they were
[57:21] scared of one thing and that was the
[57:23] presence of god amen they were scared of
[57:25] the presence of god they weren't just
[57:26] scared that he would find out but they
[57:28] were scared now to come into his
[57:29] presence and that's the first thing that
[57:31] having their mind take on a different a
[57:33] different tune was that it drew them
[57:34] away from the presence of god and what
[57:37] the love had to depart from out of their
[57:38] lives and now fear came in we don't know
[57:40] if we can go in his presence then they
[57:42] lost dominion in the presence of god he
[57:44] declared judgment on the man he says now
[57:46] you're going to have to sweat for it now
[57:47] you don't get to have spoken word
[57:49] authority now you don't get to speak to
[57:50] the elements now you don't get to tell
[57:52] the wind raise up here and drop down
[57:53] here in these different things but he
[57:55] says now you're gonna have to sweat just
[57:56] to live before he could just move it
[57:59] around before he could do whatever he
[58:00] wanted everything was given god said for
[58:02] him and he didn't have to strive for it
[58:04] but now he had to strive for these
[58:06] things and then the third thing he lost
[58:08] was fellowship with god because as soon
[58:10] as god pronounced judgment what happened
[58:11] was a cherubim with a flaming sword
[58:13] drove them out of the presence of god
[58:15] and he guarded that tree of life now
[58:17] with a flaming sword
[58:19] now what was that flaming sword
[58:21] the sword is always the word isn't it
[58:23] amen and it was a flaming sword and what
[58:25] did the law do the law kept them out of
[58:26] the presence of god it declared that
[58:29] they were ineligible to come into the
[58:31] presence of god except that one man once
[58:32] a year out of all the millions of
[58:34] israelites it guarded them from what the
[58:36] christ the anointed one it guarded them
[58:38] from the presence of god and so they had
[58:40] to come out now and and being creatures
[58:42] that were originally supernatural now
[58:44] they come into the natural outside of
[58:46] the presence of god and they've got to
[58:47] figure out how to make a living they've
[58:48] got to figure out how this whole thing
[58:50] works amen
[58:51] so if we're ever to get back to our
[58:52] original position then all three of
[58:54] these things have to come back we have
[58:55] to get eternal life back we have to get
[58:57] fellowship back and we have to get
[58:58] dominion otherwise we're not in our
[59:00] original condition amen
[59:02] now i believe adam and eve recognize
[59:04] this because we see when we're reading
[59:05] here in genesis 6 that the sons of god
[59:08] kept themselves pure for a while
[59:10] and when i say pure i mean they kept
[59:12] their bloodline pure because we know
[59:13] what the original sin was amen the
[59:15] serpent seed as we know and so they kept
[59:17] their bloodline pure you had the sons of
[59:19] men and you had the sons of god
[59:22] and the sons of men were what they were
[59:24] the original flesh that was blended with
[59:26] what the serpent so it was an impure
[59:29] line and they were called men there but
[59:31] they were sons of god on the other side
[59:32] that adam and eve and their lineage
[59:34] would have kept themselves pure from
[59:36] satan's line from cain's lineage and so
[59:38] they held themselves back for a while
[59:40] but as we look in genesis 6 1 it says
[59:42] and it came to pass that men when men
[59:45] began to multiply on the face of the
[59:47] earth and daughters were born unto them
[59:49] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[59:51] of men that they were fair and they took
[59:53] them wives of all that they chose now
[59:55] notice we have two different groups we
[59:57] have sons of god and daughters of men
[59:59] now before that we definitely had
[1:00:00] daughters of god
[1:00:02] and that's who the sons of god would
[1:00:03] marry they'd marry daughters of god
[1:00:04] wouldn't they and they keep the line
[1:00:06] pure but there came a time that they did
[1:00:08] for a while they wouldn't mix they
[1:00:10] wouldn't mingle i think they learned
[1:00:11] perhaps from adam and eve that we don't
[1:00:14] mingle with that they understood what
[1:00:15] the original sin was
[1:00:17] and then they understood what had
[1:00:18] happened in that garden and so they kept
[1:00:20] themselves from that but after a while
[1:00:24] what happened they started to blend in
[1:00:26] prophet of god says that god kept them
[1:00:28] separate
[1:00:29] that they had somehow tied themselves to
[1:00:31] this idea that if we can keep our line
[1:00:33] pure maybe he'll come back and redeem us
[1:00:35] but they could only keep it for so long
[1:00:37] because why they were outside of the
[1:00:39] presence of god they were in a fallen
[1:00:41] condition and though they didn't realize
[1:00:42] it yet they haven't even experienced
[1:00:44] death yet in many cases yet they were in
[1:00:46] a fallen condition and there was nothing
[1:00:48] going to keep them moving forward into
[1:00:50] the presence of god again amen there was
[1:00:52] something that was going to have to
[1:00:53] happen
[1:00:54] amen but in that separation from cain's
[1:00:56] lineage they were as pure as you could
[1:00:57] ever get on this earth since the fall
[1:01:00] we're way beyond them now
[1:01:02] and we'll see it by the scriptures why
[1:01:03] but brother brandon puts it this way he
[1:01:04] says god had to separate cain's people
[1:01:07] from cess people he sent cain away he
[1:01:10] separated them so he could deal with his
[1:01:12] church he says now watch god separated
[1:01:15] eve's evil cain from adam's holy seth
[1:01:19] oh how did he do it through oh did he do
[1:01:22] it he says through an unlawful act this
[1:01:24] woman living with somebody else and
[1:01:26] brought a child god separated that child
[1:01:28] and his generations from righteous and
[1:01:30] holy man his children then he says it's
[1:01:33] the same thing today separating
[1:01:36] separated so he takes you out and then
[1:01:39] he keeps you aside doesn't he
[1:01:41] separating separated found them they
[1:01:44] were not in unity he says they can have
[1:01:47] no unity can night have unity with day
[1:01:50] can a believer have unity with an
[1:01:51] infidel can a man who believes in all
[1:01:54] the word of god have a unity with them
[1:01:56] who just believes part of the word of
[1:01:59] god he says god wants separators he said
[1:02:02] before that what to to get the token he
[1:02:05] says god's word calls for a total
[1:02:07] separation from unbelief but what
[1:02:09] happened was they started to do what
[1:02:11] they started to mix up and what did they
[1:02:13] do they looked over the fence didn't
[1:02:14] they that's always what gets us in
[1:02:16] trouble is when we start to look over
[1:02:18] the fence and see what other people are
[1:02:20] doing and what other people have and
[1:02:21] whether that might work for me
[1:02:24] that's always the problem is we get
[1:02:26] wandering eyes the grass is always
[1:02:27] greener on the other side and it's
[1:02:29] curiosity often that pulls us to the
[1:02:31] other way right and what did it lead to
[1:02:33] it led to a greater falling away
[1:02:35] they were in sin but now it led to what
[1:02:38] them doing the very thing that eve had
[1:02:39] done with the serpent they went right
[1:02:42] back to the very thing that drove them
[1:02:43] out of the presence of god in the first
[1:02:45] place
[1:02:46] but the battle says he says now cain was
[1:02:48] eve's son she said i have gotten a son
[1:02:50] he said but seth was adam's son
[1:02:53] and god separated them because they'd
[1:02:55] corrupt one another cain's evil children
[1:02:57] would corrupt cess good children that's
[1:02:59] right he says now watch and the same old
[1:03:02] devil that caused eve to disbelieve one
[1:03:04] word of god and told them to separate
[1:03:07] themselves from one another and to live
[1:03:08] different each one that same devil has
[1:03:11] got among them and brought them together
[1:03:13] again he says did you get it he says he
[1:03:16] brought them together under a false
[1:03:18] union an act against god's plan amen
[1:03:21] what is it blending the ideas or the
[1:03:23] appearance of what man thinks is good
[1:03:25] with what god thinks is good every time
[1:03:26] amen but i want you to notice here that
[1:03:29] we don't see the daughters of god
[1:03:30] looking at the sons of men
[1:03:33] i believe eve taught them really well
[1:03:35] don't go there
[1:03:36] i went there we're not supposed to go
[1:03:38] there that's why we're in the fall this
[1:03:40] is just me speaking i don't have a quote
[1:03:41] for it or anything but we never see the
[1:03:43] daughters of god falling away here
[1:03:45] initially amen
[1:03:47] but it was the sons of god that fell
[1:03:50] adam stayed pure
[1:03:51] he joined eve to join you know to stay
[1:03:53] with her but but he didn't follow by
[1:03:55] deception but yet here we see them
[1:03:57] falling by what
[1:03:58] something else
[1:04:00] he couldn't keep them pure what is it
[1:04:02] they're falling away from their original
[1:04:04] position more and more and more it's a
[1:04:05] progressive thing but when they start to
[1:04:07] slide we see how fast they start to
[1:04:09] slide amen
[1:04:10] reminds me that if we get out of the
[1:04:12] presence of god nothing good is going to
[1:04:14] happen is it amen we can be raised in
[1:04:16] good families we can be raised in a
[1:04:17] pastor's home or preacher's home we can
[1:04:19] be raised in a wonderful message church
[1:04:20] with wonderful anointed services and
[1:04:22] ministry and songs but if you aren't in
[1:04:24] the presence of god daily then
[1:04:26] something's going to happen between
[1:04:27] wednesdays and sundays isn't it when you
[1:04:29] get out then satan's going to start to
[1:04:30] work on you and he's going to start to
[1:04:32] blend in and you're going to start to
[1:04:33] have problems now blending in at church
[1:04:35] aren't you because he's got five days to
[1:04:37] work on you and god's only got you for
[1:04:38] the two that you're committing to him
[1:04:40] right we've got to stick with him day in
[1:04:42] and day out we're looking to practice
[1:04:44] the presence of god continually day in
[1:04:46] and day out not just on wednesdays and
[1:04:47] sundays
[1:04:49] prophet of god said it grieved the heart
[1:04:51] of god when he looked upon them in the
[1:04:53] days before the end of deluvian
[1:04:54] destruction that he ever made a man he
[1:04:57] says what happened the sons of god saw
[1:04:59] the daughters of men were fair it was a
[1:05:02] perversion
[1:05:03] the perversion was say was satan in a
[1:05:06] serpent blending with humanity and they
[1:05:08] looked at that and said that looks
[1:05:09] better than what we've got
[1:05:11] that's a scary place when we say we look
[1:05:13] at something that's not of god and say
[1:05:15] that looks better than the pureness that
[1:05:16] god's given me
[1:05:18] why because it's never going to appeal
[1:05:19] to the eye what god gives you
[1:05:21] right because remember eve saw that it
[1:05:24] was good to eat
[1:05:26] and then she took of it didn't she
[1:05:28] it was the eyes it was the lust of the
[1:05:29] eyes that drew her in that's not the way
[1:05:31] god draws us amen we don't look on
[1:05:33] crisis there's nothing about him it says
[1:05:35] that we would look on him to desire him
[1:05:37] amen and if it's that for the flesh it's
[1:05:38] going to be that for the word in any
[1:05:40] other way isn't it you're not going to
[1:05:41] look at it to desire it but there's
[1:05:43] going to be something in you that's
[1:05:44] calling you towards it and saying that's
[1:05:46] for me regardless of what it looks like
[1:05:47] to the person next to me amen he says it
[1:05:50] was a perversion it was a sex mix-up it
[1:05:53] was that thing that drove the children
[1:05:55] of god from the garden of eden it was
[1:05:58] that thing that drove god's judgment to
[1:06:00] bring peace upon the earth it was that
[1:06:02] thing that caused them destroyed it was
[1:06:04] that same mixing up between women and
[1:06:06] men that caused sodom and gomorrh to
[1:06:08] sink to the bottom of the dead sea
[1:06:11] every union or marriage that they did
[1:06:13] was replaying what the very same act
[1:06:15] that caused them to fail in the very
[1:06:17] beginning they were just doing it over
[1:06:19] and over and over again right to god's
[1:06:22] face
[1:06:23] they completely turned away from what he
[1:06:25] said don't do there's one thing he said
[1:06:27] don't do and they were doing it and
[1:06:29] doing it and doing it with the very one
[1:06:30] that had caused them to leave the garden
[1:06:32] in the first place amen that's what god
[1:06:34] grieves the most is when you replicate
[1:06:35] the very sin that kicked you out of his
[1:06:38] presence in the first place amen and
[1:06:39] what is it the sin is not sexual
[1:06:42] fornication it's not what he did but it
[1:06:43] was unbelief where she and maybe they
[1:06:46] looked over there and said we need some
[1:06:47] of that and they forgot that that was
[1:06:49] the product of what sin and unbelief and
[1:06:51] separation from god that was the product
[1:06:53] of separation from god amen but we do
[1:06:56] that very same thing so often as we look
[1:06:58] over at somebody else has something that
[1:07:00] may be speaking more to the young people
[1:07:01] right now we look at what our old
[1:07:03] friends used to do or our school friends
[1:07:05] are doing or we're walking around the
[1:07:06] mall and we're seeing what they're
[1:07:07] saying is good and great and wholesome
[1:07:10] or what is going to be popular or what
[1:07:11] is trending and we start to say maybe i
[1:07:13] could take some of that
[1:07:15] maybe i could take just a little of it i
[1:07:17] know it's all wrong but maybe i could
[1:07:18] add a little bit in
[1:07:20] listen the fashions as they move through
[1:07:23] should not be messagified if i can make
[1:07:25] it that way amen we don't go there and
[1:07:26] say let's put a message spin on a world
[1:07:28] trend
[1:07:30] that's never been the purpose of god was
[1:07:31] to take those things and say let's run
[1:07:33] it through the filter of the word so we
[1:07:35] can blend in but still meet the message
[1:07:37] criteria what are we going back to
[1:07:39] legalism we're going back to legalism
[1:07:41] every time amen
[1:07:43] listen he says the same thing the last
[1:07:45] quote i read he says the same devil that
[1:07:47] was working the same demon that was
[1:07:48] working in the sons of god then are
[1:07:50] trying to work in the sons of god now
[1:07:52] and every single man in here that owns a
[1:07:54] phone that has on social media that has
[1:07:56] anything to do on the internet knows
[1:07:57] that he's trying to do that every single
[1:07:59] day you walk through a mall you can't
[1:08:01] even look at what's in those stores you
[1:08:03] can't look at what's posted for
[1:08:05] advertisements because it's sick sick
[1:08:07] sick and everything is there trying to
[1:08:09] turn your head to get you to what not
[1:08:11] want to come into the presence of god
[1:08:13] right to get you to the point where you
[1:08:15] don't recognize you've got a problem and
[1:08:16] so you're covering it with repentance
[1:08:18] rather than deliverance amen where
[1:08:20] you're covering it with what a form of
[1:08:22] godliness but without the holy ghost to
[1:08:24] give you the overcoming power you need
[1:08:25] to get past amen to cause you to turn
[1:08:27] your head like a son of god will amen
[1:08:29] listen you don't even have to do
[1:08:31] anything on your phone or computer these
[1:08:33] days they have algorithms that will
[1:08:35] throw stuff at you to see if you'll
[1:08:36] click to see if you'll look and then
[1:08:38] what do they do they take you
[1:08:39] progressively further
[1:08:41] i can't tell you how many pastors i know
[1:08:43] you know why pastors are getting into
[1:08:44] social media so they can see how it
[1:08:46] works so they can see what their young
[1:08:47] people are dealing with that's why
[1:08:49] they're doing it they don't want
[1:08:50] anything on it but i found out things
[1:08:51] from ministers on social media that i've
[1:08:53] never experienced before and he says
[1:08:54] yeah we're finding out this is what the
[1:08:56] young people are doing to get past
[1:08:57] filters and and getting past this and
[1:08:59] getting past that because we're trying
[1:09:00] to protect them you know as as parents
[1:09:02] and whatnot and they're saying we've got
[1:09:03] to learn how it's working so we can see
[1:09:05] how they're getting past it that's a
[1:09:07] scary point when we're trying to figure
[1:09:08] out how they're actively working to get
[1:09:10] around the safeguards that we've put in
[1:09:12] it's the same thing eve did isn't it god
[1:09:14] put a safeguard in she found her way
[1:09:15] around it eventually right
[1:09:17] amen what is it we didn't walk away from
[1:09:20] the conversation and he's saying sons of
[1:09:22] god you need to walk away from the
[1:09:23] conversation you need to walk away from
[1:09:25] anything that's causing you to pull away
[1:09:27] from the word of god scripture says look
[1:09:29] if your eye offends you pluck it out
[1:09:31] you know what that means that means some
[1:09:33] men need to get a dumb phone not a
[1:09:35] smartphone that they can carry anywhere
[1:09:36] right
[1:09:37] listen he says
[1:09:39] it's a sex perversion he says that's the
[1:09:40] same spirit that's here today to draw
[1:09:42] the sons of god away why because we're
[1:09:43] in a sodom and gomorrah condition
[1:09:45] it's the exact same thing as the end of
[1:09:47] times it's the end of days for the
[1:09:48] gentile dispensation that spirit is here
[1:09:51] today and i don't believe there's a
[1:09:52] single man in here that doesn't know it
[1:09:53] that's on a computer
[1:09:55] because you don't have to leave your
[1:09:56] home now to get to get tempted you don't
[1:09:58] have to leave your home to to to help
[1:10:00] with an addiction you know to feed it
[1:10:02] you don't have to it's all right there
[1:10:04] any time you want what is it satan gets
[1:10:06] a toehold and then he turns it into a
[1:10:08] stronghold why because you won't go and
[1:10:10] get that taken care of right away you
[1:10:12] won't go confess the issue you have and
[1:10:14] get it taken off of you and like i said
[1:10:15] we cover it with repentance rather than
[1:10:17] deliverance god didn't give us the holy
[1:10:19] ghost so all we did was repent he gave
[1:10:20] us the holy ghost for what overcoming
[1:10:22] power amen
[1:10:24] brother brown says another thing he did
[1:10:26] back there we noticed it during the time
[1:10:28] of this great turmoil when men's heart
[1:10:30] began to wax cold and away from god
[1:10:32] women became such an idol
[1:10:35] that's today
[1:10:36] he says when the sons of god seen the
[1:10:38] daughters of men they were fair he says
[1:10:39] it became a sexual order so what men
[1:10:42] started to be led around by what their
[1:10:44] hormones and their eyes rather than what
[1:10:46] god had told them to do and to not do
[1:10:48] amen what is it they became beasts
[1:10:51] a brother ron said over the pulpit he
[1:10:53] says
[1:10:54] a beast is a man without god
[1:10:57] because that's what we are we're in
[1:10:58] beast nature we're we're tied in our
[1:11:00] blood is no longer pure we've got beast
[1:11:02] nature all over us don't we there's
[1:11:03] nothing pure in our bodies so we are a
[1:11:05] beast without the holy ghost it's the
[1:11:07] holy ghost that makes us a new creation
[1:11:08] or a new creature amen but what we saw
[1:11:11] that men were drawn to the women and
[1:11:13] then what we've seen is a turnaround now
[1:11:14] where the women have used that to what
[1:11:17] weaponize it against men to do what gain
[1:11:19] influence and power and we see that
[1:11:21] because what is the mother church it's a
[1:11:23] woman it's a harlot
[1:11:25] it's one that has leveraged her beauty
[1:11:26] to gain position power and influence and
[1:11:29] it's the same thing that's happening
[1:11:30] today he says look at it today what
[1:11:32] we're living in now he says not speaking
[1:11:34] against honorable women no sir they're
[1:11:36] god's instruments
[1:11:38] not just the men that are god's
[1:11:39] instruments in this bride amen it's
[1:11:41] women too he says but those who cares
[1:11:43] not for themself how there is so many on
[1:11:46] the opposite side going about marrying
[1:11:48] and giving them marriage god said so in
[1:11:50] the bible jesus said before noah's time
[1:11:52] at the end they were marrying and giving
[1:11:54] in marriage
[1:11:55] he says how the great turmoil is in the
[1:11:58] world today and we realized that and one
[1:12:00] thing that caused that the bible said
[1:12:01] that the spirits
[1:12:03] great spirits come down evil spirits and
[1:12:06] got into those people and done those
[1:12:08] things and we see the same evil spirits
[1:12:11] working in our day
[1:12:13] great spirits
[1:12:15] two hundred thousand thousand out of the
[1:12:16] river euphrates now what they were
[1:12:18] turned on the jews for a short while but
[1:12:20] now they're focused on the gentile bride
[1:12:22] because as soon as they go satan's
[1:12:24] kicked out and he knows his time is
[1:12:25] short so he's trying to slow this down
[1:12:27] every way he can every gun in heaven is
[1:12:29] aimed at one group and that's the bride
[1:12:31] of jesus christ today great spirits
[1:12:34] great spirits not little tiny demons
[1:12:36] these are big ones man
[1:12:38] brothers these are big ones aren't they
[1:12:41] we don't just have little battles
[1:12:42] anymore it ain't just little magazines
[1:12:44] it ain't just little shows or this it's
[1:12:46] everywhere anytime you want
[1:12:49] or he wants
[1:12:50] amen you're assaulted today
[1:12:53] with the sensuality of this world
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:57] he says but what
[1:13:00] he starts to like you look at that and
[1:13:02] you say that's horrible
[1:13:04] and if we stop that quote right there
[1:13:06] you'd say who can stand
[1:13:08] great spirits who's going to win that
[1:13:10] every man's fallen since the beginning
[1:13:12] of time
[1:13:14] but he says
[1:13:15] now notice again then not only that
[1:13:19] he says when all hell turns loose
[1:13:22] all heaven turns loose also and when the
[1:13:25] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[1:13:27] of god raises up a standard against it
[1:13:30] he says and those two forces is always
[1:13:33] showed at the junction so if you're at
[1:13:35] the junction and you're struggling
[1:13:36] recognize there is a power you haven't
[1:13:38] tapped into yet there is something
[1:13:40] beyond what you have grasped or you have
[1:13:43] a hold of in yourself and it's available
[1:13:45] to you if you will only look to the
[1:13:47] right person at that junction amen if
[1:13:49] the enemy is coming in with a flood that
[1:13:51] means god has something that can take
[1:13:53] you past it amen
[1:13:55] amen he fell at a junction the sons of
[1:13:58] god fell at a junction brother brown
[1:13:59] says you're at the same junction again
[1:14:01] same spirit same great spirits same
[1:14:04] struggles same trials but he says we've
[1:14:06] got a different standard now
[1:14:08] they didn't have a standard back then
[1:14:10] they didn't have something to fall on
[1:14:11] but he says what when the enemy comes in
[1:14:13] like a flood the spirit of god will
[1:14:16] raise up a standard amen
[1:14:18] amen you women have a battle too
[1:14:21] don't think you're not a part of this
[1:14:22] because it all got mixed up in the end
[1:14:24] you've still got to watch your fashions
[1:14:26] you've still got to watch the middle of
[1:14:27] the road and then you still got to be
[1:14:28] sober
[1:14:29] and then you still got to have a modest
[1:14:31] attitude and spirit around you not just
[1:14:33] your dress amen
[1:14:35] why because you're the literal
[1:14:36] personification of the bride
[1:14:38] you sisters are the greatest
[1:14:39] representation of the bride of jesus
[1:14:41] christ that's on this earth right now as
[1:14:43] a woman
[1:14:44] as a woman amen but how many are
[1:14:46] crossing lines today amen and the first
[1:14:49] thing we see is what outward but outward
[1:14:51] is just a reflection of the inward amen
[1:14:53] and so we see them and what are they
[1:14:55] doing the skirts are getting higher and
[1:14:56] the clothes are getting tighter and
[1:14:58] they're getting more and more trendy and
[1:14:59] fashionable
[1:15:00] and it causes me to question because
[1:15:02] here's the thing
[1:15:03] we all start at a different place in our
[1:15:05] walk with christ we were talking about
[1:15:07] this at the house the other day
[1:15:09] one sister may start
[1:15:12] at a higher level of modesty
[1:15:14] than another one
[1:15:16] maybe one's down here
[1:15:19] but guess what we don't care where you
[1:15:20] start
[1:15:22] we care where you finish amen and so the
[1:15:25] question is when you're making a change
[1:15:27] from modesty to immodesty
[1:15:30] what is it that influenced you there
[1:15:32] i preached this when we preached on the
[1:15:33] influence of another i don't care so
[1:15:35] much about the gray areas what i look at
[1:15:38] is the changes are you going from more
[1:15:39] modest to less modest because i've never
[1:15:42] seen the holy spirit guide someone into
[1:15:43] our modesty
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:46] i've never seen the holy spirit guide
[1:15:48] somebody into taking them away from
[1:15:49] church
[1:15:51] right i've never seen the holy spirit
[1:15:53] guide someone into spending less time
[1:15:54] with believers and more with unbelievers
[1:15:56] or denominational christians so when i
[1:15:58] see the change towards something that is
[1:16:00] off the word then i say there's another
[1:16:02] influence coming in there a great spirit
[1:16:04] has come in and he's turned you or she
[1:16:06] it has torn you turned you away from the
[1:16:09] place that you're supposed to be going i
[1:16:10] don't care where you start i just care
[1:16:12] where you're headed and if you're headed
[1:16:14] towards satan then i'm going to say
[1:16:15] there's another spirit there's another
[1:16:16] anointing on you
[1:16:18] right the question is did the holy
[1:16:20] spirit tell you to change your clothing
[1:16:22] that way
[1:16:23] that we ought to be able to say that
[1:16:25] when we make a decision when we make a
[1:16:27] change we ought to be able to say the
[1:16:28] holy spirit told me to do that
[1:16:31] because why the scripture says sons of
[1:16:33] god are led by the spirit of god
[1:16:36] so when we do something then we're
[1:16:37] supposed to be able to say the spirit of
[1:16:39] god told me to do it because we're led
[1:16:40] by the spirit of god amen
[1:16:44] let me put it this far
[1:16:46] you ought to be able to testify
[1:16:48] of everything that you're doing with
[1:16:50] your life
[1:16:53] that sounds fanatical doesn't it
[1:16:55] but listen if sons of god are led by the
[1:16:57] spirit of god and what we're doing is by
[1:16:59] the spirit of god then that ought to
[1:17:00] bring a testimony in every aspect of our
[1:17:02] life and by that i mean how we spend our
[1:17:04] time how we spend our money how we spend
[1:17:05] our energy where we go who we're with
[1:17:08] what we're doing when we're with them
[1:17:09] all of that ought to be able to be
[1:17:11] testified about the next time you're
[1:17:13] with believers why because you're a
[1:17:15] spirit-filled son or daughter of god and
[1:17:16] you're being led by that spirit which
[1:17:18] means that there's potential for
[1:17:19] testimony in every single thing that you
[1:17:21] do because he's the one that's leading
[1:17:22] you amen
[1:17:24] but the question is do we have only
[1:17:26] certain people that we'll talk to about
[1:17:28] certain things we're doing
[1:17:29] and we say we let's just keep this
[1:17:31] between us right
[1:17:34] let's just keep this on the down low
[1:17:36] young people do we have a group of
[1:17:37] people that we talk to about certain
[1:17:39] things and we don't share that with the
[1:17:40] youth ministry we would never tell our
[1:17:42] parents or our pastor but there's a
[1:17:43] group of young people that we'll talk to
[1:17:45] and we'll do these things with
[1:17:47] the question is are those holy ghosts
[1:17:48] filled believers
[1:17:50] or are they backslidden believers
[1:17:52] or are they unsaved pretenders
[1:17:55] because if we can only talk about it
[1:17:57] with a certain group
[1:17:59] then it ain't the holy ghost
[1:18:01] it ain't the holy ghost if we've got to
[1:18:03] hide it and then if we've got to keep it
[1:18:05] in shadows it's not the holy ghost
[1:18:06] that's leading us to do these things
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:09] you say that's fanatical take it to the
[1:18:12] scripture colossians 3 17 says and
[1:18:14] whatsoever you do in word
[1:18:17] or indeed
[1:18:18] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[1:18:21] giving thanks to god and the father by
[1:18:23] him so let me put it this way is there
[1:18:25] thanks being given to god for the things
[1:18:27] you're doing
[1:18:29] that's the standard he says paul says
[1:18:31] everything you do and say ought to be
[1:18:32] able to tie back to give glory to god
[1:18:34] that's a standard
[1:18:36] that's a standard i want raised in my
[1:18:38] life that's for sure amen and then you
[1:18:40] do it in his name
[1:18:42] that means you're doing it with his
[1:18:43] leading with his guidance not with his
[1:18:46] just his permission but with his leading
[1:18:48] and with his god he's taking you
[1:18:49] someplace he's directing you he's
[1:18:51] telling you to do things that these
[1:18:52] things amen because what is it we'll say
[1:18:55] well it's all about a personal
[1:18:57] it's all about personal conviction
[1:19:00] listen conviction is not our standard
[1:19:03] conviction is not our standard the word
[1:19:06] is our standard amen because you can
[1:19:07] come to a place where what your
[1:19:09] conscience is seared with a hot iron and
[1:19:11] you have no conviction and you say well
[1:19:13] i'm not convicted that doesn't make it
[1:19:15] right that just means you're not
[1:19:16] convicted the word is the standard that
[1:19:18] we're raising up in our lives amen amen
[1:19:21] what is it we're looking at the sons of
[1:19:23] god getting away from the mind of god
[1:19:26] amen and after this point in genesis 6
[1:19:29] they are never called the sons of god
[1:19:30] again until we get to paul's messages
[1:19:34] there's never a son of god until christ
[1:19:35] comes and then after that it's us
[1:19:37] after this point they fall so quickly
[1:19:39] and so far away from the very mind and
[1:19:41] purpose of god that he doesn't even call
[1:19:43] them sons of god anymore
[1:19:45] it was a mixed multitude that grieved
[1:19:47] god and what did he do
[1:19:48] it says in the lord god and the lord
[1:19:50] said my spirit shall not always strive
[1:19:52] with man for that he also is flesh yet
[1:19:54] his days shall be a hundred and twenty
[1:19:56] years the early humans could live to 800
[1:19:59] 800 or 900 years we know
[1:20:01] over 900 years for methuselah and a
[1:20:03] couple of other ones right that was with
[1:20:05] that pure
[1:20:06] natural godline if we could put it that
[1:20:08] way it was still insane but not being
[1:20:11] mixed with the serpent it could live for
[1:20:12] quite a long time not quite a thousand
[1:20:14] years but god said that's too long for
[1:20:16] people that only think continually of
[1:20:17] evil so he says i'm going to cut them
[1:20:19] short
[1:20:20] he says and there were giants in the
[1:20:22] earth in those days listen if we were
[1:20:24] looking at the fruit of this from carnal
[1:20:25] eyes we'd say this was the right thing
[1:20:26] to do there were giants in the earth in
[1:20:28] these days and also after that when the
[1:20:30] sons of god came in into the daughters
[1:20:32] of men and they bear children to them
[1:20:34] the same became mighty men which were of
[1:20:36] old men of renown brother brown said
[1:20:38] that civilization took off here and this
[1:20:40] is where your scientists were and the
[1:20:42] great things that came out of that and
[1:20:44] what is it satan now has full control
[1:20:46] over the minds and hearts of men
[1:20:48] and this is what came out of it men of
[1:20:49] renown
[1:20:51] great men
[1:20:52] i'd be curious to know what history they
[1:20:54] had for those up to the up to the up to
[1:20:56] the flood that they had you know what
[1:20:58] they achieved in those times
[1:21:01] but god wiped it all off
[1:21:03] it grieved him
[1:21:04] it says and god saw that the wickedness
[1:21:06] of man was great in the earth and that
[1:21:08] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[1:21:11] heart was only evil continually no room
[1:21:14] for god
[1:21:15] god said there's nothing
[1:21:18] do you know noah's a part of this
[1:21:22] i'll prove it to you by the scriptures
[1:21:24] you say noah was a god-fearing man
[1:21:28] if he was then why did he need grace
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:32] wasn't necessarily evil continually but
[1:21:34] he was no he was no wonderful man we
[1:21:35] don't see anything of noah we see how he
[1:21:37] felt when he got up there amen
[1:21:39] what this was not a man that was perfect
[1:21:40] this was a man that found grace
[1:21:42] there's a reason for it amen but i can
[1:21:44] say it says and it repented the lord
[1:21:47] that he had made men on the earth and it
[1:21:48] grieved him at his heart and the lord
[1:21:50] said i will destroy man whom i have
[1:21:52] created from the face of the earth both
[1:21:54] man and beast and the creeping thing and
[1:21:56] the fowls of the air for it repenteth me
[1:21:58] that i have made them and we're here
[1:22:00] again because remember he says i'm not
[1:22:02] going to destroy him by by a flood i'm
[1:22:04] going to destroy them by fire the next
[1:22:05] time amen the only reason he does is
[1:22:07] because they're right back to where they
[1:22:08] started at the beginning amen and we're
[1:22:10] not to the point where they'll let us be
[1:22:11] if we just let them be but they want us
[1:22:13] to accept it they want us to believe it
[1:22:16] and then they want us to fight their
[1:22:17] battles with them that's where we're at
[1:22:19] is they won't just allow a difference of
[1:22:20] opinion they won't allow a difference of
[1:22:22] belief but they want you to accept what
[1:22:24] they have and then get on their side and
[1:22:25] fight the battle with them amen
[1:22:28] but where's the mind of christ in all of
[1:22:29] this
[1:22:31] there's always a one
[1:22:32] there's always a group there's always
[1:22:34] somebody that god's got ready to be used
[1:22:36] amen satan's pressing more and more into
[1:22:38] humanity so what does that mean for the
[1:22:40] bride
[1:22:41] christ is pressing in yes do you feel it
[1:22:44] do you feel it because if he's not
[1:22:46] pressing in then something else has been
[1:22:47] pressing him out
[1:22:49] and you don't even realize it right now
[1:22:51] amen amen
[1:22:53] the prophet always pointed us back to
[1:22:54] this and i quoted it earlier in isaiah
[1:22:56] 59 says so shall they fear the name of
[1:22:59] the lord from the west and his glory
[1:23:01] from the rising of the sun when the
[1:23:03] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:23:05] spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[1:23:06] standard against him
[1:23:09] what's god doing when satan's pressing
[1:23:11] god's pressing back isn't he
[1:23:13] what does that look like
[1:23:15] but brahm says but now
[1:23:17] when we need it
[1:23:19] the spirit of god raises a standard what
[1:23:21] is it
[1:23:22] he is pouring in
[1:23:24] his spirit
[1:23:27] that's why we need the holy spirit not
[1:23:30] just once brother brahm said one filling
[1:23:32] many refillings that's why you need to
[1:23:34] be in the presence of god is because
[1:23:36] there's a standard that needs to be
[1:23:38] raised up to keep you against these
[1:23:39] great spirits that are coming amen this
[1:23:41] is fast becoming my my favorite quote
[1:23:43] you know why because this is a time when
[1:23:45] it's being raised this is a time when we
[1:23:47] need exactly this above and beyond when
[1:23:49] it's ever been needed before amen
[1:23:51] what is it when i get into a trial when
[1:23:53] i get into an uncertainty when i get
[1:23:54] into something where i don't know what
[1:23:56] to do when i get into something where i
[1:23:57] don't feel i've got the strength that i
[1:23:59] need
[1:24:00] what do i do
[1:24:01] i go to god and i say god i need more of
[1:24:03] you
[1:24:04] listen i need more of you here because i
[1:24:06] can't deal with this i don't care if
[1:24:08] you're a minister
[1:24:09] i don't care if you've been serving the
[1:24:11] lord for 40 or 50 or 60 years it doesn't
[1:24:13] matter the standard has to be raised
[1:24:15] because the enemy is coming in like a
[1:24:17] flood god has provided something that
[1:24:19] means there's a reason for it amen and
[1:24:21] it's because the enemy is coming in
[1:24:22] stronger than he's ever come in before
[1:24:25] well you say well i already got the holy
[1:24:26] ghost
[1:24:27] look in acts chapter 4 after they've
[1:24:30] been endued with power on high after
[1:24:32] they've had the upper room experience
[1:24:34] after they've been out fully obeying the
[1:24:36] gospel commission they got hauled in
[1:24:37] front of the priests the disciples did
[1:24:39] and they said you better not do this
[1:24:41] anymore or else
[1:24:42] and what did they do they went back and
[1:24:44] they had a little meeting with the with
[1:24:46] the other believers didn't they and they
[1:24:48] said here's what they're going to do if
[1:24:49] we do what he told us to do here's what
[1:24:51] what's going to happen to us if we obey
[1:24:53] the great commission
[1:24:55] and what did they do they shared the
[1:24:56] problem and a spontaneous prayer meeting
[1:24:58] broke out that's a group of believers
[1:25:01] when we come up against the need and
[1:25:03] what do we do we bow our heads and we go
[1:25:04] to the one that can actually do what
[1:25:06] make a change in the situation listen
[1:25:09] they were maybe even a week away from
[1:25:11] receiving the infilling of the holy
[1:25:13] spirit for the very first time in a
[1:25:15] group of people
[1:25:16] and they were coming back and they said
[1:25:18] we need more
[1:25:20] we need more
[1:25:21] a week after the very first and filling
[1:25:23] they're saying god we need more of you
[1:25:26] it says in acts 4 31 and when they had
[1:25:29] prayed the place was shaken where they
[1:25:31] were assembled together and they were
[1:25:33] all filled with the holy ghost that
[1:25:35] happened back in the first and second
[1:25:36] chapter of acts
[1:25:38] but they were all filled with the holy
[1:25:39] ghost again
[1:25:41] what where they were assembled together
[1:25:43] you tell me it's not important to be
[1:25:45] around holy ghost-filled believers
[1:25:47] this is what happens around holy
[1:25:48] ghost-filled believers you get more of
[1:25:50] the holy ghost you get more of the word
[1:25:52] you get more strength you get more
[1:25:53] courage you get more of what you need to
[1:25:55] fight the battle when you walk back out
[1:25:57] that door amen it says and they were all
[1:25:59] filled with the holy ghost and they
[1:26:01] spoke the word of god with boldness they
[1:26:03] started speaking the word with boldness
[1:26:04] on the day of pentecost peter stepped
[1:26:06] out with great boldness the man that
[1:26:07] denied christ denied it got up there and
[1:26:10] spoke and 3 000 people came to him but
[1:26:12] guess what even peter had some issues
[1:26:15] here
[1:26:16] he was a little worried he's like we've
[1:26:18] just started they're already going to
[1:26:19] kill us
[1:26:21] so what lord i need more
[1:26:23] and guess what god gives you what you
[1:26:25] asked for
[1:26:26] amen what is it god's not slack
[1:26:28] concerning his promises amen we'll go
[1:26:31] and we'll ask him for money we'll ask
[1:26:32] him for grace we'll ask him for
[1:26:33] forgiveness we'll ask him for our
[1:26:35] children we're asking for this and that
[1:26:36] and the other thing but listen you can
[1:26:38] never ask too much of him
[1:26:41] right 99.9999999
[1:26:44] of the world wants nothing to do with
[1:26:45] him guess what he's got a people that he
[1:26:47] wants to be poured into and all he's
[1:26:50] the only thing that holds him back from
[1:26:52] us is how much we want him how much
[1:26:54] we're willing to let go is how much he's
[1:26:55] willing to pour in amen
[1:26:57] so don't sit there and say well we had a
[1:26:59] great service last time we had special
[1:27:01] meetings and a great minister so i can't
[1:27:03] go to god asking him for more i already
[1:27:05] got prayed for her i bel i'm holding him
[1:27:07] to his promise i'm confessing this and
[1:27:09] and that and the other thing don't stop
[1:27:11] there listen build on it build on it
[1:27:15] lord i got you i want more of you i need
[1:27:17] more of you
[1:27:19] i'm satisfied that you're answering
[1:27:20] prayer but lord don't stop there there's
[1:27:22] more that has to be fulfilled there's
[1:27:24] more deliverances i need in my life amen
[1:27:27] i need more of you
[1:27:29] and guess what he's not going to sit
[1:27:30] there remember jesus said if if you go a
[1:27:32] kid goes up to his his dad and says i
[1:27:34] want i want bread does he give him a
[1:27:36] rock or he says if he needs fish will he
[1:27:38] give him a serpent he says how much more
[1:27:40] your father in heaven
[1:27:41] brother brahm said god wants to bless
[1:27:43] you more than you want to be blessed and
[1:27:46] guess what there's no greater blessing
[1:27:48] than the personal presence of god in
[1:27:49] your life day in and day out in an over
[1:27:52] abundance that will help the person next
[1:27:54] to you as well amen
[1:27:56] amen here they got what they asked for
[1:27:59] question is what are we spending our
[1:28:00] time asking for
[1:28:02] yeah
[1:28:02] amen we have no problem asking god for
[1:28:05] the material needs
[1:28:07] how about our spiritual needs
[1:28:09] sometimes we just need the power of god
[1:28:11] to keep us and hold us there while he
[1:28:13] takes the time to work things out in our
[1:28:14] life sometimes we just need holding
[1:28:16] power don't we when things are coming in
[1:28:19] because it says what having done all the
[1:28:21] stand stand
[1:28:22] sometimes you just need strength to
[1:28:24] stand you don't have to move forward you
[1:28:25] just don't want to move back you've got
[1:28:27] to hold the ground that you've been
[1:28:28] given and that's oft times what happens
[1:28:30] at special meetings and special
[1:28:31] ministers coming in these things or you
[1:28:33] have a wonderful service and what do you
[1:28:34] do you take some ground and then satan
[1:28:36] comes in and he tries to what take back
[1:28:38] what you've taken from him and all
[1:28:40] you're trying to do is hold
[1:28:41] hold hold and then what god's gonna add
[1:28:44] line by line word by word experience by
[1:28:46] experiencing you're gonna take one foot
[1:28:47] step at a time brother brown says what
[1:28:49] footsteps is possession
[1:28:50] all he's trying to get you do is hold
[1:28:52] what you've got and then you'll take
[1:28:53] another step and another step and you
[1:28:54] see the romans what they do they block
[1:28:56] shields and then they do one step
[1:28:58] and then they'd stab stab stab and then
[1:29:00] they do one step and all they're doing
[1:29:01] was holding the line they take that
[1:29:03] initial rush and then they just start
[1:29:04] marching forward in lock step in unity
[1:29:07] not a bunch of people going helter
[1:29:08] skelter but lock together in unity what
[1:29:11] under the umbrella of the word moving
[1:29:13] forward and taking over satan
[1:29:15] amen
[1:29:17] brother brown puts it this way he says
[1:29:18] what we need is a good old-fashioned
[1:29:20] holy ghost sent revival men back to
[1:29:23] believing the word of god that god will
[1:29:25] take care of us like he did in the old
[1:29:27] days he will take care of us today
[1:29:30] he says do you believe that god will
[1:29:32] take care of us what we need today is
[1:29:34] another refilling another like the
[1:29:37] disciples amen
[1:29:39] but he can't do it for you if he's on
[1:29:40] the outside
[1:29:42] he can't do it if he's just a
[1:29:44] a happenstance in your life from time to
[1:29:46] time the occasional god is not the name
[1:29:48] he's known by by the believer amen
[1:29:51] right he's supposed to be the
[1:29:52] ever-present help in time of trouble
[1:29:54] isn't he amen he can't do anything if
[1:29:56] he's a part-time renter in your body
[1:29:59] he doesn't do that
[1:30:00] he's either in or he's out
[1:30:02] there is no half saved there is no half
[1:30:04] holy ghost half not holy ghost you're
[1:30:06] either sealed to the day of your
[1:30:07] redemption or you're lost
[1:30:09] and then you've got to come to that
[1:30:11] place where there's a peace and there's
[1:30:12] a rest inside that you have been sealed
[1:30:14] to your eternal destination and that
[1:30:16] he's going to take you all the way
[1:30:17] through and until you do you're just
[1:30:18] going to be back and forth up and down
[1:30:20] like we were talking at the house the
[1:30:21] other day why why are people so tossed
[1:30:23] about they have no anchor they have no
[1:30:25] security they the question has not been
[1:30:27] answered in their personal life where it
[1:30:29] comes to where they stand with god amen
[1:30:31] i was listening to the message you must
[1:30:33] be born again last week and at the very
[1:30:35] beginning the prophet of god is praying
[1:30:36] and he says this he says and we're
[1:30:38] grateful that we have hungry hearts to
[1:30:40] hear thy word
[1:30:42] are you grateful you're hungry
[1:30:44] he says continue to hunger our hearts
[1:30:46] for thee lord as david of old said as
[1:30:49] the heart pantheth for the water brook
[1:30:51] my soul thirsts after thee thinking of
[1:30:53] the little heart the deer as we would
[1:30:55] call him today that he's been torn by
[1:30:56] the wild dogs and he's bleeding he's
[1:30:59] losing his life and he must find water
[1:31:01] if he expects to exist but he says once
[1:31:04] he finds water his life is renewed
[1:31:07] he says may we be that thirsty lord that
[1:31:10] we must have christ if we exist we must
[1:31:13] have christ if we become the church that
[1:31:15] we're asking for
[1:31:17] we're asking for great power and great
[1:31:19] authority we want to fulfill the word we
[1:31:21] want to be the manifested sons and
[1:31:22] daughters of god he says lord may you
[1:31:24] help us to stay thirsty to bring us to
[1:31:26] that place amen
[1:31:29] if we live the lives that we are wanting
[1:31:32] to live we must have christ or we will
[1:31:36] die
[1:31:37] amen
[1:31:38] can you say that
[1:31:41] i must have
[1:31:42] jesus personally
[1:31:46] continually
[1:31:47] every single day amen why is it so
[1:31:50] necessary
[1:31:51] because if we're being drawn back to the
[1:31:53] mind of christ
[1:31:54] to the form of god
[1:31:56] to thinking not robbery to be equal with
[1:31:58] him to recognize who we are something
[1:32:00] has to draw us there and guess what it
[1:32:02] isn't our carnal nature and it's not our
[1:32:04] body's desires and it's not certainly
[1:32:06] the eyes of flesh that we have or the
[1:32:07] ears that we have or any of these things
[1:32:09] none of that will do to draw you back to
[1:32:10] eternal life amen what is it we can't
[1:32:13] make it happen on our own
[1:32:14] we can know about it we can be
[1:32:16] associated with it we can even
[1:32:18] acknowledge it
[1:32:19] verbally that we think it's true but
[1:32:21] that is not what's going to draw you all
[1:32:22] the way to eternity that is not what's
[1:32:24] going to restore you back knowing the
[1:32:25] truth has never been enough
[1:32:27] it's never been enough to know the truth
[1:32:28] judas knew the truth
[1:32:31] nicodemus knew the truth the rich young
[1:32:34] ruler knew the truth amen
[1:32:36] but where to take him
[1:32:40] didn't take him to eternal life did it
[1:32:44] it's got to be something inside of you
[1:32:45] amen that's drawing you to him amen
[1:32:48] so don't let shame or fear or
[1:32:49] disappointment keep you out of that
[1:32:52] presence
[1:32:52] that's the greatest thing that holds the
[1:32:54] believers back so many times as they're
[1:32:55] ashamed
[1:32:57] right and shame is just what an
[1:32:59] expression of fear
[1:33:02] that what you're not what you say you
[1:33:03] are
[1:33:05] you're not supposed to believe what you
[1:33:06] say you are you're supposed to believe
[1:33:07] what he says you are and then the
[1:33:09] experience in your life is supposed to
[1:33:10] reflect that the thing is don't do what
[1:33:12] adam and eve did try and make it better
[1:33:14] on your own try and cover it up try and
[1:33:16] give an excuse try and give a reason try
[1:33:18] and pass the buck to somebody else
[1:33:20] that's not what he's looking for he's
[1:33:21] looking for somebody that'll come back
[1:33:22] to him
[1:33:23] amen he's the great resolver
[1:33:26] prophet of god says it this way he says
[1:33:27] look what adam did as soon as he become
[1:33:30] a sinner he never tried to seek god it
[1:33:32] was god seeking adam
[1:33:34] he says he really represented the human
[1:33:36] race right there when he hid himself
[1:33:37] behind some fig leaves that he made
[1:33:39] himself like most people do today
[1:33:42] i belong to the church and i've got my
[1:33:44] fig leaf apron on
[1:33:46] i belong to a message church and i've
[1:33:48] got my fig leaf apron on yeah
[1:33:51] still a fig leaf
[1:33:54] he says but it was god seeking after
[1:33:55] adam and not adam seeking after god it
[1:33:58] should have been adam's streaming father
[1:34:00] father where art thou
[1:34:02] instead it was god saying adam
[1:34:04] adam
[1:34:05] where art thou
[1:34:07] and that's the same thing today he says
[1:34:09] so there's just not one bit of goodness
[1:34:11] about us that we could say we had
[1:34:13] anything to do with our salvation it was
[1:34:15] god calling us by election that's why i
[1:34:17] say noah had nothing in him that made
[1:34:19] him somehow what worthy to be saved
[1:34:23] noah was what he was a son of god
[1:34:25] and that's the only thing that was good
[1:34:27] about noah
[1:34:28] because why there's nothing good about
[1:34:29] me before he saved me there's nothing
[1:34:31] good about you before he saved you
[1:34:33] whether or not you're raised in the
[1:34:34] message there's nothing good in us
[1:34:36] brother braham says there's nothing
[1:34:37] there there's nothing there in us that
[1:34:39] has anything to do with our salvation
[1:34:40] except what the predestination of god by
[1:34:43] election that's the only thing that was
[1:34:44] in noah that brought him through
[1:34:46] we see what fell
[1:34:48] amen the sons of god turned their eyes
[1:34:50] away in their mind from the purity of
[1:34:51] god's word they got mixed up and they
[1:34:53] took the whole creation all the way down
[1:34:55] to hell
[1:34:56] amen
[1:34:57] but look at the next verse as we start
[1:34:59] to close here in genesis 6
[1:35:01] it says but noah found grace
[1:35:03] in the eyes of the lord
[1:35:05] did it say noah was a wonderful
[1:35:07] believing christian
[1:35:09] did it say noah had the victory
[1:35:12] didn't say noah was a great carpenter
[1:35:15] all it says was noah found grace and you
[1:35:17] know what grace is unmerited favor that
[1:35:19] means he didn't do enough to warrant
[1:35:21] saving
[1:35:24] he didn't
[1:35:26] we saw him he was a drunkard after
[1:35:28] that's right
[1:35:30] he wasn't necessarily the grace of
[1:35:32] believers but you know what when god
[1:35:34] came his way by faith he responded
[1:35:38] listen it doesn't matter where you are
[1:35:40] matters what you do when he comes your
[1:35:41] way
[1:35:42] listen zacchaeus
[1:35:45] zacchaeus
[1:35:47] he was the worst of the worst he was a
[1:35:49] traitor to his own people cheating them
[1:35:51] not just a tax collector for the romans
[1:35:53] but cheating them out of it and guess
[1:35:54] what when god came his way when christ
[1:35:56] came his way what did he do
[1:35:57] he says
[1:35:58] this days jesus said this day salvation
[1:36:00] has come because what do you do he says
[1:36:02] i'm going to give everything back times
[1:36:03] 4. he says i'm going to make everything
[1:36:05] right how he responded is what mattered
[1:36:07] there
[1:36:08] didn't matter that he was a cheat didn't
[1:36:10] matter that he was a traitor a turncoat
[1:36:11] what matters was what he did when god
[1:36:13] came his way
[1:36:14] man he's not looking for perfection he's
[1:36:16] looking for somebody that'll respond to
[1:36:17] his word when he comes amen
[1:36:20] amen noah was the son of god and god was
[1:36:22] never going to let that fall by the
[1:36:24] wayside amen
[1:36:25] they had great men and women come along
[1:36:27] all through the old testament amen godly
[1:36:29] people committed to the kingdom of god
[1:36:31] sincere in their beliefs taking the
[1:36:33] stand for god even doing miracles
[1:36:35] but it was never enough to bring us back
[1:36:37] was it
[1:36:38] god destroyed the earth started
[1:36:40] everything fresh and yet one is want to
[1:36:41] know his children came through and what
[1:36:43] he was the son of the serpent again
[1:36:45] and what happened was he just carried
[1:36:46] right on through and it all got as
[1:36:47] messed up as it was before that amen
[1:36:51] what not a single one could restore us
[1:36:53] back to where we needed to be
[1:36:54] there was no way we could do it why they
[1:36:56] couldn't even restore themselves much
[1:36:58] less the rest of us
[1:37:00] but brahm says god's intention for his
[1:37:02] creation man is to express his words
[1:37:05] in genesis adam was given the word to
[1:37:07] live by he says a word a life lived by
[1:37:10] the word would be the word expressed
[1:37:13] you say we want to be the manifested
[1:37:14] sons and daughters of god here you go a
[1:37:16] life lived by the word would be the word
[1:37:18] expressed
[1:37:19] he says that is true is it not but did
[1:37:21] adam live by that word no because he was
[1:37:23] to live by every word and he failed to
[1:37:25] take heed to every word then there arose
[1:37:27] moses what a great and mighty man he was
[1:37:30] yet he also failed to live by every word
[1:37:32] and that prophet the type of the great
[1:37:34] prophet to come failed in anger to obey
[1:37:37] the word then there was also david the
[1:37:39] great king of israel a man after god's
[1:37:41] own heart and he failed by adultery when
[1:37:43] he was tempted amen
[1:37:44] david was a man after god's own heart
[1:37:46] and that still wasn't enough
[1:37:49] it was enough to get him grace it was
[1:37:51] enough to get him forgiveness
[1:37:53] but that's all he got yeah he still died
[1:37:56] what looking for the promise
[1:37:59] right certainly couldn't get us back to
[1:38:00] eden moses was the great prophet he says
[1:38:02] here what it was a prophet like unto
[1:38:04] thee was what jesus was supposed to be
[1:38:05] compared to moses that's how great a man
[1:38:07] moses was was that christ was modeled
[1:38:09] after moses
[1:38:11] can you imagine
[1:38:12] can you imagine if you were the one that
[1:38:14] christ was modeled after it's the other
[1:38:16] way for us but he says moses was so
[1:38:18] close to a god and a man
[1:38:20] that christ was modeled after him and
[1:38:22] yet what great signs great wonders great
[1:38:24] victories great prophecies great
[1:38:26] discernment
[1:38:27] great moving of the presence of god in
[1:38:29] the camp under his ministry and yet what
[1:38:31] it wasn't enough to restore them back
[1:38:32] was it still in a fallen condition what
[1:38:35] was it god using you wasn't enough to
[1:38:36] restore you being used of him did not
[1:38:38] mean you were restored just means you
[1:38:40] were used
[1:38:41] nearly perfect wasn't enough is what
[1:38:42] we're getting at we have no recorded
[1:38:44] faults of samuel
[1:38:46] yet it wasn't enough joseph a near
[1:38:49] perfect type of christ yet asked his
[1:38:50] father to lie
[1:38:51] that's the only thing we know that he
[1:38:52] did wrong it excluded him amen what is
[1:38:55] it they're in a fallen condition
[1:38:57] and when you're in a fallen condition
[1:38:58] you can't raise yourself higher than
[1:38:59] what you are right it's impossible to do
[1:39:01] it amen you can't make yourself sinless
[1:39:04] a sinful creature can't make itself
[1:39:05] sinless
[1:39:06] it's born in it it's shaped in it it's
[1:39:08] come to the world speaking lies the
[1:39:09] prophet would say amen you can't redeem
[1:39:11] yourselves from it brother braham says
[1:39:13] first we reckon ourselves sinners and
[1:39:15] worthy of condemnation
[1:39:17] that's where we start
[1:39:19] that's where we start with salvation he
[1:39:20] says and we are all born and sinned and
[1:39:22] shaped in iniquity there's not a sound
[1:39:24] parcel of us our minds are bad our soul
[1:39:27] is corruptable our constant thinking is
[1:39:29] evil every imaginary thought of a man's
[1:39:31] mind is evil a sinner and also that our
[1:39:34] body is weak and our spirit is no good
[1:39:36] and we're just full of corruption
[1:39:39] that's our original position as we come
[1:39:42] into the world today every single one of
[1:39:44] us doesn't matter where you're born
[1:39:45] message not message denominational
[1:39:46] atheist
[1:39:47] buddhist jane
[1:39:50] doesn't matter
[1:39:51] roll this
[1:39:52] he says and how could one corruptable
[1:39:54] thing bring another good thing out of a
[1:39:56] corruptable he says let me say this that
[1:39:58] in job the 14th chapter he said seen
[1:40:00] that man is born of a woman full of
[1:40:02] sorrow and trouble yet he cometh forth
[1:40:04] like a flower he fadeth away and on as
[1:40:06] the prophet goes on speaking he said who
[1:40:08] can bring a clean thing out of an
[1:40:10] unclean he says not one
[1:40:12] he says you stick your bucket down into
[1:40:14] the well and pull out a bucket of water
[1:40:16] and it's stagnant it stinks you look in
[1:40:18] it and it's muddy and little worms is in
[1:40:20] that water there's no way at all to put
[1:40:22] your bucket back and get a clean bucket
[1:40:24] the whole well is contaminated and the
[1:40:26] whole soul mind and body of man is
[1:40:29] contaminated with sin he's born in sin
[1:40:31] physically shaped in iniquity and come
[1:40:33] to the world speaking lies so that his
[1:40:35] own soul is contaminated nothing good
[1:40:38] one cannot redeem the other because it's
[1:40:40] all wrong
[1:40:41] and you can't take a bucket full of
[1:40:42] water here that's contaminated and
[1:40:44] another bucketful that's contaminated
[1:40:46] and mix them together he says you've got
[1:40:48] more contamination there's no
[1:40:50] purification in it
[1:40:52] i remember brother ed hammermeister when
[1:40:53] he was here and he was preaching
[1:40:54] remember and he was speaking of jacob he
[1:40:56] says the first thing jacob had to do to
[1:40:58] get anywhere with god was do what
[1:41:00] confess who he was
[1:41:02] because he says what's your name
[1:41:05] what was jacob's well we know jacob's
[1:41:07] name was jacob but what did it mean
[1:41:10] shyster
[1:41:11] deceiver
[1:41:12] cheater
[1:41:13] manipulator
[1:41:15] what he had to stand there and say this
[1:41:17] is what i'm coming as
[1:41:19] he lived up to his name didn't he
[1:41:21] and before he became israel a prince
[1:41:24] having power with god he had to say what
[1:41:26] i'm nothing
[1:41:28] i'm worthless i have nothing to offer
[1:41:30] you but yet i'm here asking for
[1:41:31] something amen
[1:41:33] do you know what my name means
[1:41:35] gift of god
[1:41:38] and guess what unlike jacob
[1:41:40] i don't match up to my name
[1:41:43] no matter what i did nobody was ever
[1:41:45] going to call me a gift of god
[1:41:47] until what
[1:41:49] god turned me into something
[1:41:51] listen we don't all have bad names most
[1:41:53] of them have pretty good names don't we
[1:41:55] but that's not what's going to make you
[1:41:56] good right you've got to confess like
[1:41:58] date like jacob did i'm nothing i'm
[1:42:01] corrupt
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:04] that it's all contaminated
[1:42:06] everything in me it's just worms it's
[1:42:08] dead it's rotten
[1:42:10] nothing good worthless falling apart
[1:42:12] crumbling in the light of god
[1:42:16] the world may look at it and say you're
[1:42:17] very gifted
[1:42:18] well educated intelligent good luck i'm
[1:42:20] not talking about myself i'm talking
[1:42:21] about the group
[1:42:23] all of these things in the world could
[1:42:24] look and say you've got something to
[1:42:26] offer god said
[1:42:28] in the light of his glory and grace it
[1:42:30] all fades away doesn't it
[1:42:32] amen
[1:42:35] what happened through moses
[1:42:37] the law came
[1:42:38] do you ever happen to notice with
[1:42:40] abraham there was no law he had one law
[1:42:42] circumcision
[1:42:43] and everything else abraham did was by
[1:42:45] one thing
[1:42:46] faith
[1:42:48] by faith abraham did this hebrews 11
[1:42:50] records of force doesn't it by faith
[1:42:51] abraham did this by faith abraham did
[1:42:53] this by faith sarah did this it was a
[1:42:55] life by faith by what personal
[1:42:57] leadership and relationship with god
[1:43:00] that's what he walked by but what
[1:43:02] happened when he came down
[1:43:04] sorry let me interject this here another
[1:43:05] brother brother ed hammermeister thing
[1:43:07] when he was he was here and we were
[1:43:08] talking he says if you add up all of the
[1:43:10] conversations that god had with abraham
[1:43:12] and read them out it adds up to eight
[1:43:15] minutes of conversation
[1:43:16] just reading so we speak faster than we
[1:43:19] read so abraham has less than eight
[1:43:22] minutes of recorded conversation with
[1:43:23] god over 24 years
[1:43:26] that's it
[1:43:28] lots of experiences perhaps
[1:43:31] but only eight minutes of conversation
[1:43:33] all pointing to the exact same thing
[1:43:34] with not a single shred of evidence to
[1:43:37] support that it was ever going to happen
[1:43:39] all the way up to year 24.
[1:43:42] that's what abraham did by faith was he
[1:43:44] left
[1:43:44] our pastor read it the other day he left
[1:43:47] knowing whether or not whether or not he
[1:43:48] went he didn't know he didn't have a
[1:43:50] clue where he was going and he didn't
[1:43:52] have a clue when he was going to get
[1:43:53] there
[1:43:54] and he left on the basis of a little
[1:43:56] conversation from god brother brahm
[1:43:58] talks about abraham and sarah's if they
[1:43:59] were what down their packing idols they
[1:44:01] were idol worshipers he says
[1:44:04] that's why i say noah probably was along
[1:44:06] the same lines
[1:44:07] because abraham was the same way too
[1:44:09] what it wasn't where they started that
[1:44:10] matters it was what happened when the
[1:44:12] presence of god came through their life
[1:44:14] and guess what he came down he says
[1:44:15] abraham get out there's a place i'm
[1:44:17] going to show you and i'm going to turn
[1:44:18] you into a great nation abraham said
[1:44:20] okay
[1:44:21] that was a very short conversation for
[1:44:23] somebody to pick up and move and move
[1:44:25] and move and have no enduring place they
[1:44:27] dwelt in tents
[1:44:28] the entire time
[1:44:31] no proof
[1:44:32] no proof of the resurrection
[1:44:34] a wife fading that was never able to
[1:44:36] have children his body getting older and
[1:44:37] older and weaker and weaker
[1:44:39] nothing there
[1:44:41] and then somebody came their way man
[1:44:43] and it all changed yeah
[1:44:47] but the thing i love about abraham is
[1:44:48] that he wasn't perfect in his actions
[1:44:51] wasn't perfect in his responses
[1:44:53] but he was always ended up pointed in
[1:44:55] the same direction that god told him to
[1:44:57] go he always came back
[1:44:59] listen he messed it up bad he messed up
[1:45:01] with ishmael we're still dealing with
[1:45:02] that
[1:45:03] but guess what he always came back to
[1:45:05] that promise and it was accounted to him
[1:45:07] for righteousness the scripture says
[1:45:08] amen
[1:45:11] but look what happened adam feared the
[1:45:12] presence of god when he'd sinned
[1:45:14] and you remember when the children of
[1:45:15] israel were out there and god says i'm
[1:45:16] going to come down on the mountain and
[1:45:17] they're going to see me
[1:45:19] and he came down and what'd they say
[1:45:21] no no no this is no good we're scared of
[1:45:23] the presence again
[1:45:25] that's right they said moses you deal
[1:45:26] with them that's right and so god says
[1:45:28] then guess what i'm going to deal with
[1:45:29] prophets from now on that's why we
[1:45:31] believe in a prophet because he deals
[1:45:32] with prophets
[1:45:33] amen but he what the men what happened
[1:45:36] was moses goes up on a mountain and he
[1:45:37] comes down with the law
[1:45:39] and what happened was men took that law
[1:45:42] and they replied used it to replace god
[1:45:44] the law became their god and they forgot
[1:45:46] that there was a god out there that was
[1:45:47] seeking what to have an effect in their
[1:45:50] lives above and beyond that amen what
[1:45:52] did it what was it it was a means of
[1:45:53] keeping their lives clean and helping
[1:45:54] them skip many problems listen you
[1:45:56] follow what the word says and you're
[1:45:58] going to have a better life regardless
[1:45:59] of whether or not you have the holy
[1:46:00] ghost you'll be saved from so many
[1:46:02] messes in your life if you just do what
[1:46:03] the word says
[1:46:05] but that's not the answer
[1:46:07] that's not the answer that's legalism
[1:46:08] from start to finishing man but what
[1:46:10] happened was this was a the law gave
[1:46:12] them a means of approaching god if only
[1:46:13] once a year
[1:46:15] they kept them clean before god every
[1:46:17] year that man would go in that priest
[1:46:19] would go in and he'd offer a sacrifice
[1:46:20] and that kept them clean for that one
[1:46:21] year that gave them potential access to
[1:46:24] god
[1:46:26] but what they turned that now into a god
[1:46:28] for themselves is that when god came
[1:46:30] they never recognized them
[1:46:32] hebrews 10 it says for the law having a
[1:46:34] shadow of good things to come
[1:46:36] they turned the shadow into god itself
[1:46:39] they turn the shadow they turn the
[1:46:40] negative into the image
[1:46:43] it says and not the very image of the
[1:46:44] things can never with those sacrifices
[1:46:47] which they offered year by year
[1:46:48] continually make the comers their unto
[1:46:50] perfect
[1:46:52] for them would they not have ceased to
[1:46:53] be offered because that the worshippers
[1:46:55] once purged should have no more
[1:46:57] conscience of sin
[1:46:58] he says but in those sacrifices there is
[1:47:00] a remembrance again made of sins every
[1:47:02] year the law did not do away with what
[1:47:04] the conviction that they had and it did
[1:47:06] not erase the sins and merely covered
[1:47:08] them and guess what the bucket they were
[1:47:09] in was getting bigger and bigger and
[1:47:11] bigger and bigger every year and it was
[1:47:13] building up to an unbearable load
[1:47:15] nothing could answer that that humanity
[1:47:17] had to offer him it but they got so
[1:47:19] stuck on the shadow of good things to
[1:47:20] come that when the good thing came they
[1:47:22] didn't recognize it
[1:47:24] you know what our shadow is today
[1:47:26] it's a prophet
[1:47:29] because what you look at that and you
[1:47:30] see that what there's a god projected
[1:47:32] through that prophet we are not deist by
[1:47:34] any means but we saw god use a man like
[1:47:36] he's never used a man since what the
[1:47:38] days of jesus christ that's right
[1:47:40] that's what we saw happen there and
[1:47:41] people will stop there and they'll
[1:47:43] worship that shadow and they'll say
[1:47:44] that's it and god's saying whoa whoa i
[1:47:47] i'm in a multi-member bride not a
[1:47:49] one-member bride i've got a people i'm
[1:47:51] wanting to work in and we're sitting
[1:47:53] there looking back at a message and
[1:47:54] we're looking at what he did and what he
[1:47:56] said rather than what getting under the
[1:47:58] effect that it was supposed to bring
[1:48:00] into our lives amen that's the modern
[1:48:02] day law for the message believers that
[1:48:04] you look at it as what it was and what
[1:48:06] he brought rather than the effect that
[1:48:08] it's supposed to have it stays as
[1:48:09] letters in your life and there's no life
[1:48:11] of the spirit behind it
[1:48:13] amen
[1:48:15] they got so stuck on the letter of the
[1:48:16] law that when the fulfillment of the law
[1:48:18] came they said no i'm happy with the law
[1:48:20] why because they got so good at keeping
[1:48:22] the law
[1:48:23] that they got comfortable with it
[1:48:25] that became their sign of outward piety
[1:48:27] that became their sign of
[1:48:29] of how close they were to god even to
[1:48:32] the point you know they have the
[1:48:33] phylacteries that they put on their on
[1:48:34] their foreheads and i don't know if it's
[1:48:35] the same they put on their arms but
[1:48:36] they'd have the specially shaped ones in
[1:48:39] certain sizes and everything it was all
[1:48:40] a reflection of how amazing they were as
[1:48:42] a believer
[1:48:44] that's what it became
[1:48:46] and even paul said you know he said in
[1:48:49] in there he says concerning the law he
[1:48:51] says i was blameless
[1:48:53] paul said look you couldn't come to me
[1:48:55] and say that your life doesn't match up
[1:48:56] with what moses brought us he says i did
[1:48:58] it all i was blameless under the law and
[1:49:00] that was what his religion that was his
[1:49:02] covering and that was their covering so
[1:49:04] when jesus came it exposed all of that
[1:49:05] and they said yeah right we don't want
[1:49:07] to have anything to do with that amen
[1:49:11] that's what we've got in the message
[1:49:12] today amen you've got people pointing to
[1:49:15] what the doctrines and the quotes
[1:49:17] and none of them are living in their
[1:49:18] lives
[1:49:21] it's supposed to have an effect that
[1:49:22] effect is what
[1:49:24] restoration amen
[1:49:26] i will restore saith the lord
[1:49:28] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:49:29] the fathers amen
[1:49:31] why did god do it why do we have this
[1:49:32] message
[1:49:35] he's not taking us back to the faith of
[1:49:37] the pentecostal fathers brother braham
[1:49:38] says that's not enough for us we've got
[1:49:40] to go beyond that because what they had
[1:49:43] a purpose and their purpose was not to
[1:49:44] go in a rapture
[1:49:46] their purpose was not to go to rapture
[1:49:48] their purpose was to go in all the world
[1:49:50] our purpose is to go in a rapture so
[1:49:52] we've got to go beyond pentecost all the
[1:49:54] way back to what eden that's the
[1:49:56] restoration we're going in is that faith
[1:49:58] will take us all the way back past
[1:49:59] pentecost and take us all the way into
[1:50:01] the presence of god to where we stand
[1:50:03] what exactly as adam did as sons and
[1:50:05] daughters of god perfect blameless in
[1:50:07] what a new body
[1:50:08] because down here we won't have
[1:50:09] perfection
[1:50:11] the soul is sealed the soul is perfect
[1:50:13] but this body we're fighting has
[1:50:14] recovered many times amen a restoring
[1:50:16] message brings us all the way back to
[1:50:18] what they had in the upper room and then
[1:50:19] beyond that to a rapture and a
[1:50:21] resurrection it's got to that's our
[1:50:24] purpose here is to go
[1:50:26] in a rapture that's the overcomer for
[1:50:28] the age that's the proof of who is the
[1:50:29] overcomer is who goes into rapture
[1:50:31] it's not who went to church not who sang
[1:50:33] great specials preached great great
[1:50:35] sermons or attended church faithfully
[1:50:36] and paid their tithes for 40 50 or 60
[1:50:38] years if you go on the rapture that's
[1:50:40] the overcomer in this age
[1:50:41] that's what he's looking for amen
[1:50:44] this message points us back to the
[1:50:45] experience of adam in the garden of eden
[1:50:47] not just paul and er and peter and those
[1:50:50] different ones amen it takes us past
[1:50:52] that because god used brother branham in
[1:50:53] a way different way than he used paul
[1:50:54] didn't he
[1:50:55] way different way and if he's the first
[1:50:57] fruit if he's the chief offering for
[1:50:59] this age then that's what we should be
[1:51:01] looking for in our lives is what that
[1:51:03] type of what ministry amongst us all
[1:51:06] not as brother branham as individuals
[1:51:08] but that thing spread out over the body
[1:51:10] so that the effect is the same because
[1:51:11] it's what the same god it's the same
[1:51:13] holy spirit the holy spirit didn't die
[1:51:14] when brother branham left the scene did
[1:51:16] it
[1:51:17] jesus told nicodemus that you had to be
[1:51:19] born again to even understand the
[1:51:20] kingdom of god he says you had to be
[1:51:22] born again to what understand what's
[1:51:24] going on you can't even do something for
[1:51:26] god really unless you're a part of that
[1:51:28] kingdom because you have to do it not
[1:51:29] only do the right thing but you have to
[1:51:31] do it with the right motive and the
[1:51:32] right objective you've got to have the
[1:51:34] mind of god when it comes to these
[1:51:35] things amen amen so thinking that
[1:51:37] because you're drawn to the message or
[1:51:39] you're around the message is not what's
[1:51:40] going to save you it's not what's going
[1:51:42] to take you into a rapture it's good
[1:51:44] i'll take that over anything else we've
[1:51:45] got out there
[1:51:46] but you've got to move beyond that amen
[1:51:48] having the information is not what makes
[1:51:50] us safe
[1:51:51] it never has
[1:51:52] i wasn't saved and i was raised in the
[1:51:54] message as long as i can remember but it
[1:51:56] had to move to beyond that didn't it had
[1:51:58] to come to a day where i said i'm
[1:51:59] nothing
[1:52:00] and i need something
[1:52:01] and that's what really changed my life
[1:52:03] amen
[1:52:05] paul said have you received the holy
[1:52:06] ghost since you believed they listened
[1:52:08] to peter and their hearts were pricked
[1:52:09] and said now what do we do
[1:52:11] they had the information that had an
[1:52:12] effect and then they said
[1:52:13] what happens now and he says you got to
[1:52:15] get the holy ghost
[1:52:16] because that's what's going to make you
[1:52:17] a believer that's what's going to bring
[1:52:18] you into the body of christ amen
[1:52:26] the priesthood they resisted so heavily
[1:52:28] because their religion was their
[1:52:30] identity
[1:52:32] you hear about identity politics these
[1:52:34] days
[1:52:35] this is what my party believes this is
[1:52:37] what my group believes and so this is
[1:52:38] what we're going to do and we won't
[1:52:39] listen to any other thing and that to
[1:52:41] that today
[1:52:43] listen we can get into that as believers
[1:52:45] you ought to know where you believe
[1:52:47] where you are where you're standing what
[1:52:48] you believe amen but your perfection is
[1:52:50] not in that
[1:52:52] the perfection is not in what you
[1:52:53] believe it's in what he's doing
[1:52:55] amen it's got to take you off of the
[1:52:57] pages that's got to bring it into your
[1:52:59] life that's the saving power of jesus
[1:53:01] christ amen is not to keep it on there
[1:53:03] so you can nod your head and say amen
[1:53:04] but it's to take it into your life so
[1:53:06] you can be yea and amen and then we've
[1:53:08] got to be a christ to a dying world amen
[1:53:12] the very first thing that's going to
[1:53:13] come with that like i said is humility
[1:53:15] christ humbled himself to the purpose of
[1:53:17] god amen that's the very first thing
[1:53:20] we're going to see in a believer as we
[1:53:21] go in i've got one quote left and the
[1:53:23] musicians can come if they want amen but
[1:53:25] the very first thing that he did was he
[1:53:26] humbled himself to the purpose and plan
[1:53:28] of god
[1:53:29] brother braham says this but eventually
[1:53:32] in the fullness of time there came one
[1:53:34] the head even jesus
[1:53:36] who also must be tempted to see if he
[1:53:38] would live by every word that proceeded
[1:53:40] out of the mouth of god then was satan
[1:53:43] foiled
[1:53:45] if you get the holy ghost this is what
[1:53:47] he's bringing you to to live by every
[1:53:49] word
[1:53:50] he says for here was one who lived by it
[1:53:52] is written and that masterpiece of god
[1:53:55] overcame by reflecting god's word you
[1:53:58] want overcoming power
[1:54:00] reflect god's word
[1:54:02] he says then
[1:54:03] he says
[1:54:04] then was this manifested perfect one
[1:54:06] given to the cross as the perfect lamb
[1:54:09] of god for the perfect sacrifice and on
[1:54:11] the tree he received the wounds unto
[1:54:13] death that we
[1:54:15] by him and because of him might eat of
[1:54:18] the tree of life and listen to this and
[1:54:21] then that life freely given would enable
[1:54:23] us to overcome and express the word of
[1:54:26] god
[1:54:27] amen god bless you if you would stand
[1:54:29] this evening amen
[1:54:31] under the law god gave them a way to
[1:54:32] come into his presence one time a year
[1:54:36] but when this happened what did he do he
[1:54:38] gave us 24 access to him personally
[1:54:41] where you don't have to go through a man
[1:54:43] you don't have to go through a minister
[1:54:44] you don't have to turn your eyes towards
[1:54:46] the temple you don't have to say a
[1:54:48] couple special words but you can take
[1:54:50] him with you every single place that you
[1:54:52] go amen
[1:54:53] what does the scripture say pray to the
[1:54:55] god that is within you
[1:54:57] i mean that's the place where we have to
[1:54:58] recognize who and what we are is when we
[1:55:00] say listen he's with me
[1:55:02] and guess what when we come into a big
[1:55:03] group then there's more of him here and
[1:55:05] sometimes he drops down in an even more
[1:55:07] special way man but this is the time and
[1:55:09] the place where these sorts of things
[1:55:10] can happen is when we recognize who we
[1:55:13] are and we're sitting here and we say
[1:55:14] hey my brother and my sister they got
[1:55:16] the same thing i got and so when we join
[1:55:18] our hands together what happens
[1:55:21] what we ask for because what the mind of
[1:55:23] christ is now what gathered in a body
[1:55:25] and they're working in unity and god
[1:55:27] does what he steps into his bride and he
[1:55:29] says whatever you say is what i'll give
[1:55:30] you why because you're so surrendered to
[1:55:32] the spirit that he's put in you that he
[1:55:34] lets you speak as if it was him that's
[1:55:36] where we're going amen that's the next
[1:55:38] couple of services as we go but
[1:55:39] certainly we want to be in prayer for
[1:55:41] brother aaron as he comes on sunday and
[1:55:43] then lord willing i'll pick this up
[1:55:44] again on wednesday man let's just bow
[1:55:46] our heads
[1:55:48] heavenly father
[1:55:51] lord we read about a fall today
[1:55:55] lord but we didn't just read about a
[1:55:56] fall but we read about a plan and a
[1:55:58] purpose to bring us back heavenly father
[1:56:00] lord and we spoke about the power that
[1:56:02] is available to the believer and lord we
[1:56:04] don't want to just run around out there
[1:56:06] saying your name and doing things in
[1:56:08] your name lord but until you've got that
[1:56:10] same kind of authority in our lives that
[1:56:11] bring us under subjection lord that
[1:56:13] humbles ourselves to your word first and
[1:56:15] foremost lord where you can bring us
[1:56:17] into alignment with your purpose and
[1:56:19] your will and your plan lord and where
[1:56:21] we'll sit still long enough to help you
[1:56:22] show us what you want done
[1:56:24] lord we pray that you would just help us
[1:56:26] or as we look at these things lord that
[1:56:28] you would lift our minds to a higher
[1:56:29] plane lord that the holy spirit would
[1:56:31] quicken the word for each and every one
[1:56:33] of us lord lord that we be quick to
[1:56:35] repent where we're wrong lord but in
[1:56:37] that repentance lord there's always
[1:56:39] going to be a may a way made lord for us
[1:56:41] to be restored back to your will and
[1:56:42] your way lord that your word will
[1:56:44] correct us each one we pray lord just
[1:56:47] grant us grace now as we worship you
[1:56:49] lord may you just touch us lord be with
[1:56:51] us as we finish out this week we pray in
[1:56:53] jesus christ's name we ask you amen amen
