[36:47] marvelous you
[36:50] are amen God bless you welcome each one
[36:53] here tonight just want to make a couple
[36:55] of updates and announcements I went in
[36:57] to see brother Jim on Monday and he was
[36:59] looking a lot better he had some color
[37:01] back he wasn't looking as gray but still
[37:03] feeling weak and then of course he he
[37:05] gave an update today that they're hoping
[37:07] to discharge him tomorrow so we thank
[37:09] the Lord for that that he's still with
[37:11] us he said I I don't feel the Lord's
[37:12] done with me yet and so that's good
[37:15] brother Jim's always working he's
[37:16] faithful no matter where he goes so
[37:18] we're thankful to see that but just want
[37:20] to keep him in prayer he's got to stick
[37:22] around for another two weeks before
[37:24] they'll allow him to fly so uh we can
[37:26] expect to probably see see him in at
[37:28] least one service before he goes but
[37:30] keep him in the family in prayer he's
[37:31] got four of his kids here and his wife's
[37:33] here as well so he's got lots of support
[37:35] and lots of care um so I'm sure he'll
[37:38] he'll do well certainly wanted to thank
[37:40] each one of you for your help during the
[37:42] services this weekend and food and
[37:44] fellowship and help and the specials
[37:46] it's it's a group effort and uh it can't
[37:49] happen unless we all put our shoulder to
[37:50] the wheel so I know I saw everyone
[37:53] pretty much doing something at some
[37:55] point and including our visitor sister
[37:57] Roberta
[37:57] doing 9,000 meatballs for the uh for the
[38:00] visitors so we thank each one that did
[38:02] that I mean I told sister Priscilla I
[38:04] thought that was the best I'd heard the
[38:05] choir and we've had some really good
[38:07] ones and I thought it was really really
[38:09] well done and certainly the uh the
[38:11] brunch on on Saturday was uh certainly
[38:14] an overachievement if there was ever one
[38:16] uh from the vision that the brothers had
[38:18] to the execution the sisters had was
[38:20] quite a gap um and I think it was a it
[38:23] was in a good direction so thank you for
[38:25] managing that amen and then of course we
[38:27] saw our sister Becky do her debut song
[38:30] from her first album here as well so we
[38:32] appreciate that and Trust will hear many
[38:34] more of those then certainly want to
[38:36] welcome brother Barry coffee here and no
[38:39] stranger to most of us and uh certainly
[38:41] appreciate appreciate him taking a
[38:43] service while he's on his anniversary
[38:46] you know vacation and these things I was
[38:48] telling him in there I know that when I
[38:50] go on vacation I don't want to preach
[38:52] and so I know the sacrifice when
[38:54] somebody does agree to preach and uh we
[38:56] don't get many ministers is rolling
[38:57] through here so we certainly like to
[38:59] take advantage of the opportunity if
[39:01] they're willing so he's willing tonight
[39:03] so let's sing that song thank you Jesus
[39:05] for the grace that you have given us
[39:07] amen let's just thank him for what he's
[39:10] done for us and let's welcome him into
[39:11] the service let's just focus on the word
[39:13] let's pull on the word amen and see what
[39:16] God would have for us this evening
[39:22] amen
[39:24] thank you
[39:31] Jesus for the grace that you
[39:35] have given

[41:30] name of Jesus Christ and For Your Glory
[41:33] we ask these
[41:34] things amen and amen while you're
[41:37] standing let's take your Bible uh just
[41:40] because uh just
[41:42] because because it's a good thing to do
[41:45] first
[41:47] uh everything I'm going to talk about
[41:49] Lord willing uh is going to be on the
[41:52] board so you can follow me and I will
[41:54] probably go fast uh through some of this
[41:57] here because uh this is um there's just
[42:01] there's just a lot of things that we
[42:02] could talk about under this subject or
[42:04] under this Banner here tonight so
[42:07] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse
[42:10] 4 when you have it say Amen in the
[42:14] meantime say I love my
[42:18] Bible most of you said
[42:22] it how many have
[42:24] it how many have Ephesians 6 and
[42:28] four that's a good enough number and ye
[42:31] fathers provoke not your children to
[42:34] wrath but bring them up in the nurture
[42:37] and admonition of the Lord and may God
[42:41] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[42:43] word you may be
[42:51] seated uh I preached on my
[42:55] honeymoon so I might as well preach on
[42:57] my
[42:59] 40th
[43:01] um but it it it's been an honor to be up
[43:05] here uh with you to to do both things to
[43:07] celebrate our 40th and uh to have uh
[43:11] just to step back and spend time with
[43:14] sister Becky and her 40 years I've been
[43:16] extremely blessed uh over those 40 years
[43:19] I consider her every day to be an answer
[43:21] to prayer and I thank God for that uh
[43:25] but it's also an honor to be here for
[43:26] the dedication and I'd have to say it
[43:28] was a great dedication I've been to a
[43:30] lot of dedications I have uh I'm
[43:32] scheduled to do more dedications one in
[43:34] Dublin Ireland in a month or two and uh
[43:37] different places and uh I I will tell
[43:39] you that uh it was it was a wonderful uh
[43:43] wonderful time I felt like uh we got it
[43:46] done I felt like we we got it done
[43:49] that's how I felt like it we we the
[43:51] church the church is dedicated but get
[43:54] it out of your mind that that you know
[43:56] we're focused on the building you're the
[43:57] church and uh that's what God's always
[44:00] interested in dedicating and
[44:01] rededicating so uh we thank God for the
[44:04] building but you're the church and
[44:06] you're still under construction uh for
[44:09] sure uh I I'd like to say this that uh
[44:12] you know you have a great opportunity to
[44:14] make a mark on a new generation and uh
[44:17] John that's why you're here you may not
[44:18] know that but that's why you're here
[44:20] brother Gerald made a a mark on a
[44:22] previous generation and now we're 40
[44:24] years beyond that and uh you have an
[44:27] opportunity you have a new generation
[44:28] rising up God gave you this billing for
[44:30] a purpose and uh we always don't know
[44:33] that purpose you know we think we're
[44:34] making decisions about things and we
[44:36] really don't know what we're uh what
[44:37] we're agreeing to uh but we just walk by
[44:40] faith and we trust God for the outcomes
[44:42] and that's that's really all that we can
[44:44] do um and and so uh I I would I would
[44:49] just really pray and and encourage you
[44:50] to make a uh make a mark in this
[44:53] community uh in in this uh time we live
[44:56] in
[44:57] uh you are uh standing as a a church in
[45:00] newfinland that um uh that is strong and
[45:04] uh I believe centered on the word and
[45:06] that's a great compliment and uh I know
[45:09] that uh you know it's not always been
[45:11] the testimony of all the churches uh but
[45:14] I'm I'm thankful for the testimony here
[45:16] thankful for brother Gerald and his
[45:18] dedication and vision and uh the work
[45:20] that he did and the um uh it took a
[45:25] special man to deal with us in our early
[45:32] days and
[45:34] uh as I look out over my two brothers
[45:38] painfully I I I think back of those days
[45:42] you know when uh just just how far
[45:44] you've come in music alone because uh
[45:47] you know on Harvey Road when we were
[45:49] there it was our basement first it was
[45:51] Harvey Road second downtown and duck
[45:54] Street third then Plymouth Road but I
[45:57] remember in
[45:58] uh in Harvey Road uh when we were there
[46:02] it was me first it was me Mark and Mom
[46:05] and uh we we would and then Bob and
[46:08] Brenda of course came along and uh we
[46:11] didn't have a great repertoire of Music
[46:14] we didn't have any instruments we didn't
[46:16] have any musical
[46:17] sense and we'd sing Amazing Grace only
[46:20] because we heard Willie Nelson sing it a
[46:22] long time
[46:23] ago and uh then we learned songs from
[46:26] Brother tapes and uh built from there
[46:29] but you know it was sparse until sister
[46:31] Betty rolled in and and uh played the
[46:34] Oregon forest and those were meager
[46:36] beginnings and now you're singing songs
[46:38] that I've never heard of before and it's
[46:40] just uh it's just wonderful uh your
[46:43] worship is your worship is refreshing
[46:45] and and you know what if we can like the
[46:47] worship you can imagine how much he must
[46:49] like it the Bible says he Delights in
[46:52] the Praises of his people and uh I just
[46:55] say this that uh I I want to say a
[46:57] personal thank you because I know local
[47:00] folks don't always get a whole lot out
[47:01] of dedication meetings when you served
[47:03] as much food as you did and worked as
[47:05] hard as you did and nobody gets enough
[47:07] sleep kids don't get enough sleep and
[47:10] they're cranky and husbands are cranky
[47:13] anyway and local people work hard during
[47:17] uh local meetings and I know that and as
[47:19] a lot goes on behind the scenes and
[47:21] everybody's you know impressed with the
[47:23] visitors and all of that but uh local
[47:26] people need need to be thanked
[47:28] specifically for the work you do and uh
[47:31] you know sometimes you just you just
[47:33] throw your hands up in the ear and say
[47:34] hey we'll go back and listen to the
[47:36] tapes because you tend to miss out on a
[47:39] lot because you're sitting there
[47:40] thinking wow do we have enough meatballs
[47:42] right or did I buy enough paper cups and
[47:45] you know you're sitting there going
[47:46] through all that stuff and uh you know
[47:49] it it's that that's just a fact of life
[47:52] so uh I just want to say personally from
[47:54] Sister Becky and I we we thank you for
[47:56] the hospit ality we felt and uh it it
[47:59] all went it all went
[48:01] well now uh brother John asked me to
[48:04] speak tonight and I I thought I would uh
[48:06] I just I labored a little bit over this
[48:08] and I I just want to say this that I've
[48:10] been on two series back home and one is
[48:13] uh dealing with the the harvest
[48:15] principle the fact that we've come to
[48:17] the Harvest Time and at the Harvest Time
[48:20] the Bible says that the husbandman takes
[48:22] the uh the the precious fruit of the
[48:25] earth into the Garner and so that's what
[48:27] we're that's where we're at we're at
[48:29] we're at a Harvest Time Harvest time is
[48:30] not a day Harvest time is a season and
[48:33] everything changes in the harvest season
[48:35] so uh you know we we know we're moving
[48:38] from here to there right so we have this
[48:41] thing going on and whether it's here or
[48:43] there or there doesn't really matter
[48:45] it's From Here to Eternity it's from
[48:47] here to that Kingdom right and so the
[48:50] way we get there is by faith because
[48:52] that's how Enoch got there and he's our
[48:54] type right so by faith Enoch was transl
[48:56] ated and uh and yet before he was
[49:00] translated he had this testimony that he
[49:01] pleased God so the testimony of pleasing
[49:04] God was in his walk so that was
[49:07] this that's this Direction all right we
[49:10] got that but we have this too so as long
[49:12] as we're here we got to walk in a way
[49:14] that's pleasing to God so Lord help us
[49:17] to walk this way because that comes
[49:19] before that he no good to just be
[49:22] focused on that you got to have this too
[49:24] right and so uh those are two series
[49:27] that I've been working on and I thought
[49:29] uh I'd just uh dip into this one here
[49:31] tonight on on the uh the the this part
[49:36] okay which is the Practical part uh some
[49:39] of you have raised your children
[49:42] obviously I'm looking at some older
[49:43] folks here uh the assembly and you may
[49:46] think oh well this doesn't have really
[49:48] much to do with me but it you cannot
[49:51] separate the principle of family within
[49:53] the church and within your house we are
[49:56] all a family and the the body of Christ
[49:59] the local Body of Christ is only a bunch
[50:01] of families that come together and and
[50:03] become the church family right it's
[50:06] families who come together and become a
[50:08] different kind of family and we're all a
[50:10] part of a family uh connected to the
[50:13] body of Christ which is connected in
[50:14] eternity to all the ages and it's all
[50:17] family stuff so Family Matters and it
[50:20] matters to God there's an awful lot in
[50:22] scripture uh about about families and
[50:24] and about how uh the order of things and
[50:28] I I love to watch and look and see God's
[50:30] order of things
[50:32] so in the in second Timothy Paul tells
[50:35] us and this of course is the basis upon
[50:37] which we uh make decisions about our
[50:39] family and about our uh Earthly walk
[50:42] here that from a child thou H has known
[50:44] the holy scriptures which are able to
[50:47] make thee wise unto salvation through
[50:49] faith which is in Christ Jesus well the
[50:52] scripture is able to do that hearing the
[50:54] word is able to change you right it's
[50:56] able ble to make you wise on the
[50:57] salvation and all scripture by the way
[51:00] all scripture is given by the Breath of
[51:03] God the inspiration of God the Numa and
[51:06] is profitable for Doctrine for
[51:09] reproof for correction for instruction
[51:12] and
[51:13] righteousness all scripture is good for
[51:16] this so that 17 the man of God may be
[51:20] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[51:22] good works so we go from a child to a
[51:27] man perfect am that's what that's what
[51:30] it's doing here that's what Paul is
[51:31] doing he's summarizing here from a child
[51:34] God began your instruction this way with
[51:37] the scripture the scripture is able to
[51:39] transform you so that you become this
[51:43] and God is always interested in
[51:45] developing your character because a
[51:47] character is the is a thing the only
[51:49] thing you're going to take with you but
[51:52] your legacy is what you're going to
[51:53] leave
[51:54] behind right characters what you take
[51:57] Legacy is what you leave behind brother
[52:00] Gerald leaves behind a legacy right I
[52:02] leave behind a legacy I uh we we all
[52:06] have something that we leave behind and
[52:08] I trust that i' I'm going to leave it
[52:10] behind in my children first of all and
[52:12] then in in the people who I've
[52:14] ministered to over the years and so uh
[52:16] that's an important thing but let me
[52:18] assure you God has an order right and
[52:20] everybody's involved in this whether you
[52:22] want like it or not the head of Christ
[52:24] is God the head of the man is Christ
[52:27] right and in in in the on the next lower
[52:30] level uh the head of the man is Christ
[52:32] the head of the woman is the man and
[52:34] children obey your parents in the Lord
[52:36] for this is right and all the children
[52:38] said no no no all the children
[52:42] said they said we hope he goes away cuz
[52:45] he's going to bring stuff that we're not
[52:46] going to
[52:48] like hey I I know how this works so I've
[52:51] i' I developed this uh this this
[52:54] particular series called the Christian
[52:56] family
[52:57] and it outlines a lot of the principles
[52:59] that uh Christian families employ uh in
[53:02] in raising children and through wisdom
[53:04] is in house building and understanding
[53:06] it is established and and this is uh uh
[53:09] this was Solomon now talking about
[53:10] families and talking about how important
[53:12] this is because even though it may not
[53:15] have been the case in his day our world
[53:17] is falling apart and as a result of that
[53:21] all the graphs look like
[53:23] this all the graphs tend to look like
[53:25] this this is a percentage of families
[53:27] that are one parent families and they
[53:28] all kind of look like this where you
[53:30] have number of divorces number of uh
[53:32] single parent families number of uh you
[53:34] know gay families and all the rest of it
[53:36] it's all going off to charts and and
[53:39] this is a graph sorry for the small
[53:40] print starts in 1950 over on the left
[53:43] side and it goes to 2010 as you go from
[53:46] 2010 to present in the 14 years it goes
[53:49] way up okay exponentially it goes way up
[53:52] and uh this this is the world that we
[53:54] live in so I wanted to go back and I
[53:57] wanted to dig through this because no
[53:58] one ever taught me this but I wanted to
[54:00] find out uh you know what does God
[54:02] really intend for fathers and for
[54:04] families and what's in the mind of God
[54:06] here in relation to this and one number
[54:08] one first thing I want to say is that uh
[54:12] father's principal three UH
[54:15] responsibilities were number one to
[54:17] raise his uh children with a tradeit or
[54:19] a skill and he had to uh he had to teach
[54:23] a child a sense of responsibility uh
[54:26] you're the one that's got to get out of
[54:27] the cave kill something and drag it back
[54:29] for the family cuz uh the the family
[54:32] depends on you and so you've got to you
[54:35] got to learn to work you got to be
[54:36] responsible and you got to learn to be a
[54:38] good Steward over your time and your
[54:40] talents and your Fir and your crops and
[54:43] your income and you got to pay tithes
[54:44] and you got to you got to do that so you
[54:46] had to raise your child uh with a Trader
[54:49] of skills that came behind you like
[54:50] Joseph had Jesus in the carpenter shop
[54:53] second thing was he had he was an
[54:55] ambassador for marriage to his children
[54:57] he had to demonstrate what it was to be
[54:59] a real husband he had to demonstrate
[55:02] what it was to be a a family man this is
[55:05] how we deal with crisis in the family
[55:07] this is how we deal with uh money
[55:09] problems in the family this is what we
[55:11] deal when we have this is how we deal
[55:13] with things when we have spiritual
[55:14] issues that come up trouble in the
[55:16] church or something else he had to give
[55:18] a a correct interpretation or
[55:21] Preparation to his children for marriage
[55:23] and let them go into that and they would
[55:25] know
[55:26] uh they would know how to how to handle
[55:29] themselves I say it this way so follow
[55:30] me here as I use this expression my
[55:33] ceiling should be my boy's
[55:37] platform I figured out that my ceiling
[55:40] as high as I go in raising my children
[55:44] that should be their platform in other
[55:46] words when they get married they should
[55:48] not have to drop down to learn all the
[55:49] basics about life and so forth they
[55:52] should already know that because of the
[55:54] home they came out of
[55:57] okay so they don't have to drop down
[55:58] here learn everything and then grow my
[56:01] my ceiling should be their platform to
[56:03] build on I hope that makes sense third
[56:07] thing they had to instruct by word and
[56:08] practice a knowledge of the word of God
[56:10] if you don't listen to anything else
[56:12] that I tell you tonight I would say this
[56:14] that the one of the most important
[56:15] things that parents need to do is to
[56:17] instill in their children a respect for
[56:19] the Bible because when you lose respect
[56:21] for the Bible everything changes and
[56:24] everything goes down and you're not
[56:25] going to make it if your children don't
[56:27] respect the Bible and there's not much
[56:29] even and I say this respectfully I'm not
[56:31] being critical I don't have an ax to
[56:32] grind I'm not mad you might look at my
[56:35] face and think I am but I'm not but I
[56:38] will tell you this that does not preach
[56:39] very much in in in the message Community
[56:42] but I think we need to be sure that our
[56:44] children have uh and instill in them a
[56:46] respect for the Bible because if you
[56:48] just live by Bible principles alone
[56:50] paying your tithes and living in uh
[56:52] Holiness and treating your wife right
[56:54] and all the rest of it God will bless
[56:55] you
[56:56] don't tell me he doesn't right because
[56:58] you go back and look at a story like non
[57:01] he's a he's a you know a Syrian officer
[57:04] who lives to fight against Israel but he
[57:06] obeys God and you know what he gets
[57:08] healed he walks away with something and
[57:10] so if nothing else your children should
[57:13] walk away with a uh with a a decent
[57:16] respect for for the scripture and I
[57:18] think that's an important thing so
[57:20] brother brandom says it like this and
[57:21] this is a a little dramatization that he
[57:24] does he says uh one day when had uh come
[57:27] in and he set me upon the bow of the
[57:28] boat and said Simon my little boy so
[57:31] he's he's paraphrasing a conversation
[57:33] between Simon's father and Peter Peter
[57:37] is Simon and they're in the boat out one
[57:39] day waiting for the fish to come and he
[57:42] says Simon my little boy Daddy has
[57:43] always believed that someday the Messiah
[57:45] would come and all of us Jewish people
[57:47] look for that and perhaps I won't see
[57:49] him but Simon when he comes there'll be
[57:51] a lot of stuff go out before he comes
[57:53] it'll cause the whole country to be
[57:55] confused
[57:56] us but Simon I want you to be
[58:00] taught now how good it would be if we
[58:02] American people would teach our children
[58:05] such things instead of buying him a cell
[58:08] phone I'm sorry it doesn't say that
[58:10] teach him a tap dancing and rock and
[58:12] roll and stuff we do today and just let
[58:15] them join the church but tell them what
[58:17] to look
[58:18] for so in other words in other words we
[58:22] are given as parents an
[58:24] intergenerational respons responsibility
[58:27] to pass on to things of God we've
[58:30] experienced let me say it again we've
[58:32] been given an intergenerational
[58:34] responsibility to pass on to our
[58:35] children the things that we've
[58:37] experienced and the things we know
[58:39] because you know what you're the best
[58:41] person to influence your children in
[58:42] thing in the things of God and the
[58:44] things of the Kingdom you're the best
[58:45] person they not going to get it on
[58:47] social media they not going to get it in
[58:48] school right come on they're not going
[58:50] to get it on on on television or
[58:52] something like that they're not going to
[58:53] get it from their buddies they're going
[58:55] to get they're going to get knowledge of
[58:57] the kingdom and they're going to know
[58:59] more about God from you than from anyone
[59:01] else and you say well all right that
[59:04] sounds good Dr Dobson all right let's
[59:06] look in the scripture and see where it
[59:07] says it David says in Psalm 78 I will
[59:10] open my mouth I will open my mouth in a
[59:13] parable and I'll utter dark sayings of
[59:15] old which we have which we have heard
[59:17] and known David says we've heard and
[59:19] known this and our fathers have told us
[59:22] we know what we know because our fathers
[59:24] told us and we will not hide them from
[59:27] our children showing to the generation
[59:29] to come the Praises of our of the Lord
[59:31] and his strength and his wonderful works
[59:33] that he has done
[59:35] stop you should be able to have a
[59:37] testimony that you can share with your
[59:38] children hey I remember when we were
[59:41] first married we had nothing but you
[59:42] know what God saw us through and I
[59:45] remember when uh we had a little baby
[59:46] and it had a fever burning up and we
[59:48] prayed and asked God and we called a
[59:50] pastor and he prayed and God did
[59:52] something for that little child and I'll
[59:53] tell you what we believe God's A Healer
[59:55] today
[59:56] it's hey it's not way off here great
[59:58] Mysteries here it it is a stuff that we
[1:00:01] saw God
[1:00:02] do are you with me it's a stuff that God
[1:00:05] did in our
[1:00:06] household showing to the generation to
[1:00:08] come the Praises of our Lord and his
[1:00:10] strength and his wonderful works that he
[1:00:12] has done for he established a testimony
[1:00:14] in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel
[1:00:16] which he commanded our fathers he
[1:00:18] commanded our fathers that they should
[1:00:21] make them known unto their
[1:00:23] children hey I'm reading the scripture
[1:00:25] now
[1:00:27] that the generation to come might know
[1:00:31] them even the children which should be
[1:00:36] born when you raise your children right
[1:00:39] you're actually influencing your
[1:00:42] grandchildren he's he's David is
[1:00:44] including the children which should be
[1:00:46] born they're not born yet who should
[1:00:49] arise and declare them to their
[1:00:52] children that they might set their hope
[1:00:55] that they might we already have our hope
[1:00:57] in God because our fathers influenced us
[1:01:00] and now I'm telling you this cuz I want
[1:01:03] to influence you for the kingdom of God
[1:01:05] that you might influence your children
[1:01:06] for for God that they might set their
[1:01:08] hope in God and not forget the works of
[1:01:10] God but keep his Commandments you know
[1:01:11] what that is that's an intergenerational
[1:01:14] responsibility to share the exploits of
[1:01:16] our God to those that God has given you
[1:01:19] as children and
[1:01:22] grandchildren I've I I I travel the the
[1:01:26] world and I I've been blessed to be able
[1:01:27] to minister to families and married
[1:01:29] couples all over the world and I always
[1:01:31] tell people wherever I go I said I
[1:01:33] wanted to uh one of my goals in teaching
[1:01:36] this is not to make you like me and not
[1:01:37] to make your family like my family
[1:01:39] that's not my goal I'm not trying to
[1:01:40] make you like Americans CU I'm an
[1:01:43] American now but I'm not trying to do
[1:01:45] that what I'm trying to do is get you to
[1:01:47] live according to the scripture that's
[1:01:49] that's what I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:01:50] influence you by the word of God but the
[1:01:52] second thing I'm trying to do is to
[1:01:55] enjoy my
[1:01:56] grandchildren that's what I told people
[1:01:58] all over the world I want to enjoy my
[1:02:00] grandchildren well how do you enjoy your
[1:02:01] grandchildren you raise your kids
[1:02:04] right because if you raise them right
[1:02:06] they're going to tell they're going to
[1:02:07] tell their kids about the exploits of
[1:02:09] our God right they're going to tell
[1:02:11] they're going to tell their kids about
[1:02:13] the strength of God and the and the
[1:02:14] glory of God and the power of God
[1:02:16] they're going to do that so raising your
[1:02:18] children right will it give you a better
[1:02:20] assurance that you'll be able to enjoy
[1:02:21] your grandchildren and I will tell you
[1:02:23] by God's grace I enjoy your grand our
[1:02:25] grandchildren I love it okay you say
[1:02:26] well this is Old Testament here's Paul
[1:02:28] saying in 2 Timothy Chapter 2 he says
[1:02:31] Thou therefore my son be strong in the
[1:02:32] grace that is in Christ Jesus and the
[1:02:34] things that thou has heard of me among
[1:02:36] many witnesses the same commit thou to
[1:02:39] Faithful Men you got it it's not just
[1:02:42] for you it is for those that you are now
[1:02:45] an influence to does that make sense
[1:02:48] let's look at it again Titus Chapter 2
[1:02:51] and Paul writes to the church in in in U
[1:02:55] on the under Titus at the aged women
[1:02:57] likewise that they be in behavior is
[1:02:59] becometh Holiness not false accusers not
[1:03:02] much W not given to much wine sisters
[1:03:05] teachers of good things that they may
[1:03:07] teach their young women hey there you go
[1:03:11] it does not say that they that the
[1:03:13] pastors teach the young
[1:03:15] women it doesn't say that it doesn't say
[1:03:17] that the five-fold ministry does that
[1:03:19] you know who it is it's moms and
[1:03:21] grandmas who are doing this believers
[1:03:23] who by their testimony are solid in the
[1:03:25] the Lord and so therefore we should be
[1:03:27] teaching our daughters how to how to do
[1:03:29] more than just be on social media and be
[1:03:31] on Facebook all day we should be
[1:03:32] teaching them how to be sober love their
[1:03:34] own husbands love their children be
[1:03:36] discreet Chase keepers at home all the
[1:03:38] rest of it here that the word of God be
[1:03:40] not blasphemed that's a strong sentence
[1:03:42] that's a strong statement all right so
[1:03:44] here's what I'm going to try to do and I
[1:03:46] can't do it all here tonight but uh
[1:03:48] we'll just try to see how far we can get
[1:03:50] number one in my house then here's the
[1:03:52] here's the commission okay here's the
[1:03:53] Mandate in my house I want to make my
[1:03:56] house not just a
[1:03:58] house but a dwelling place for God a
[1:04:02] place where the holy spirit's always
[1:04:03] welcome now I've looked at my job
[1:04:05] description as a parent I've checked it
[1:04:07] many times I've gone through scripture
[1:04:09] gone through everything brother brandom
[1:04:10] said and I looked for my job description
[1:04:12] as a dad and on that list I have never
[1:04:14] found it where I am a
[1:04:17] savior I'm not my children's savior
[1:04:20] never have been God didn't give me the
[1:04:23] job and so therefore I can't save my
[1:04:26] children I can't force them to believe I
[1:04:27] can't force them to be born again cuz
[1:04:29] I'm not a savior
[1:04:32] right I can't forgive them of their sins
[1:04:34] and I can't change their bodies at the
[1:04:36] end I can't do that it's not on my job
[1:04:39] description but I'll tell you what I can
[1:04:41] do I can create an atmosphere in my home
[1:04:43] where the holy spirit's always welcome
[1:04:45] to come and do what he is supposed to do
[1:04:48] and that is convict the hearts of my
[1:04:50] children and we saw that in our
[1:04:52] household and we're so thankful for that
[1:04:54] so therefore you've got say you got to
[1:04:56] make a conscious decision because
[1:04:57] nobody's going to make this for you
[1:04:59] you've got to say as for me and my house
[1:05:01] we're going to serve the Lord we're
[1:05:03] going to put a door we're going to put a
[1:05:06] a barrier between ourselves and the
[1:05:07] world that's number two a place that's
[1:05:09] separate from Sodom we're going to make
[1:05:11] our home our front door dividing line
[1:05:13] between Sodom and we're going to control
[1:05:15] what comes in here we can't control what
[1:05:17] goes on out there but we're going to
[1:05:18] control what happens in here and we're
[1:05:20] going to filter all the ways that the
[1:05:22] world will try to get in because if you
[1:05:23] don't be proactive in this area the
[1:05:25] world will get in it'll get in through
[1:05:27] phones it'll get in through media it'll
[1:05:29] get in through all kinds of other things
[1:05:31] all kinds of other ways and so therefore
[1:05:34] you got to be separate from Sodom
[1:05:36] separation is a real precious thing and
[1:05:38] it's a deep thing a lot deeper than what
[1:05:40] I ever thought about when I began to
[1:05:42] research it and that's another sermon
[1:05:44] the third thing is that we want to make
[1:05:46] a our home a place where preparations
[1:05:48] are made to leave this world all right
[1:05:51] now here's the example you remember in
[1:05:52] the first Exodus uh in in in the the
[1:05:55] time of Moses there uh and Moses began
[1:05:59] to call for plagues you remember that
[1:06:01] and
[1:06:03] uh uh every day that they every Saturday
[1:06:06] because they went to church on Saturday
[1:06:07] every Saturday when they went to church
[1:06:09] uh they had uh a plague you know like uh
[1:06:13] we're going to have Darkness today Moses
[1:06:14] called for darkness and all the people
[1:06:17] man nobody fell in nobody fell asleep in
[1:06:19] church that day as they're looking out
[1:06:21] over over from Goan they're looking out
[1:06:23] over Egypt and all the darkness you know
[1:06:26] and then they're all in light and then
[1:06:28] okay let's let's have a hymn and we'll
[1:06:30] close and go home so they went home and
[1:06:33] then the next Saturday they come out and
[1:06:35] then they're looking out at the Rivers
[1:06:36] and they all turn to
[1:06:40] blood or
[1:06:42] flies or all the cattle all of a
[1:06:45] sudden I'd fall down but it take too
[1:06:47] long to get
[1:06:49] up and and and every every Saturday they
[1:06:52] went to church and then came came and at
[1:06:56] the end of church and sang a course and
[1:06:58] went home but the last one was different
[1:07:02] the last one Moses said the death angel
[1:07:05] is going to pass over Egypt all of Egypt
[1:07:08] not just there but here too so now goed
[1:07:11] wasn't exempt right just because they
[1:07:14] were in the message now they were not
[1:07:15] exempt from the last plague the last
[1:07:18] plague meant that the death angel was
[1:07:19] going to visit every home so therefore
[1:07:21] they had to go home they had to take
[1:07:24] that message home with with them and
[1:07:26] apply it in their house and they had to
[1:07:28] clean it a certain way and they had to
[1:07:30] get certain food from the market and
[1:07:32] they had to prepare it a certain way and
[1:07:34] they had to dress in their house a
[1:07:35] certain way with her staff in their hand
[1:07:37] and their shoes on their feet and they
[1:07:38] had to put blood they had to apply the
[1:07:40] token on their house because you know
[1:07:42] what it didn't matter whether you lived
[1:07:43] in Jeffersonville and it didn't matter
[1:07:45] whether you hand had a handful of dirt
[1:07:47] or a piece of wood floor from Brother
[1:07:48] bram's office it didn't matter whether
[1:07:50] he had that it mattered whether he had
[1:07:52] the token that was the only thing that
[1:07:53] mattered and the Death Angel wasn't
[1:07:55] looking at the amount of mission work
[1:07:57] you did and the size of your church and
[1:07:59] how many square feet you got he wasn't
[1:08:01] looking at that he was looking at the
[1:08:03] blood that's all he was looking at the
[1:08:06] blood and they had to take that word
[1:08:08] home and they had to apply it in their
[1:08:10] own household in their own household
[1:08:12] they had to apply it and they couldn't
[1:08:14] just leave it at church they had to go
[1:08:16] home I believe we're at that point where
[1:08:18] we got to take this message home with us
[1:08:20] and apply it in our lives in our house
[1:08:23] you got to have the token applied there
[1:08:25] not just here because everybody's acting
[1:08:27] pretty good
[1:08:28] here I mean no one's hitting anybody and
[1:08:31] no one's poking anybody or Mo she is but
[1:08:35] o other than
[1:08:38] that other than that it's generally
[1:08:41] pretty sane here right and everybody
[1:08:42] acts like christian sings like Christian
[1:08:44] looks like Christian not hard here as
[1:08:45] you're among Believers right but this is
[1:08:47] not where the this is not where the
[1:08:49] battles are fought this is not the
[1:08:50] trench folks if you haven't figured that
[1:08:52] out the trench warfare goes on in your
[1:08:55] house in your school at your work and
[1:08:57] The Temptations that's where they really
[1:08:59] come so so this is in my house we've got
[1:09:03] to think about this this a little bit
[1:09:05] differently now because it's not just a
[1:09:07] place anymore and it's not just a
[1:09:09] kitchen anymore it is a it is a
[1:09:11] household for
[1:09:12] God it is a tabernacle where God should
[1:09:15] be welcome anytime whatever whatever way
[1:09:18] whatever time that he wants to show up
[1:09:20] we want to make sure there's nothing
[1:09:21] going on that's going to grieve him we
[1:09:24] want him him to be ble to flow through
[1:09:26] anytime that he wants to do that right
[1:09:29] are we
[1:09:30] okay
[1:09:32] so again we come back to fathers here in
[1:09:35] in Ephesians 6:4 and fathers provoke not
[1:09:37] your children to wrath you know why Paul
[1:09:38] says that is
[1:09:40] because you can you can provoke your
[1:09:43] children to
[1:09:45] wrath I mean if you couldn't provoke
[1:09:47] your children to wrath he wouldn't have
[1:09:48] said this just like uh he said grieve
[1:09:50] not the Holy Spirit whereby your seal is
[1:09:52] the day of your Redemption you know why
[1:09:53] he said that because you can't grieve
[1:09:55] the h ho spirit and if you've ever
[1:09:56] grieved the Holy Spirit you know what
[1:09:57] I'm talking about you don't need anybody
[1:09:59] to explain what it's like to grieve the
[1:10:01] holy spirit because we probably all have
[1:10:03] grieve the Holy Spirit well you can
[1:10:05] provoke your children to wrath if you
[1:10:06] got two children and you show favoritism
[1:10:08] to one you can provoke the other one to
[1:10:10] wrath
[1:10:11] right and when you when you uh uh you
[1:10:15] know Discipline Your Child unfairly uh
[1:10:18] you can G grieve those children right
[1:10:22] hey come on up here you you thank you
[1:10:26] for volunteering come on up here and
[1:10:30] your name
[1:10:32] is Gabe H welcome aboard I needed a
[1:10:36] helper sit right there so let's say
[1:10:39] Gabriel Here comes home from school and
[1:10:42] uh he's uh so this is just an example of
[1:10:45] one way that you can uh you can teach
[1:10:48] your children okay there there are two
[1:10:51] but this is the example of one so he
[1:10:53] comes home and he says Ah hey hey Dad um
[1:10:57] ah I got a question for you now he's
[1:10:59] nervous just like he is now and uh
[1:11:03] because he doesn't know what's coming he
[1:11:05] doesn't know how dad's going to react
[1:11:06] right but I'm I'm a type a person I'm
[1:11:08] pretty busy and so I'm just going
[1:11:10] through he says hey Dad what
[1:11:15] um and and uh all all the guys at at
[1:11:19] school
[1:11:21] um they're gonna they're gonna wear a
[1:11:23] simple tattoo
[1:11:26] just for this year now it's not a
[1:11:27] permanent one it's just a temporary one
[1:11:30] and
[1:11:34] um like would it be all right would it
[1:11:39] be all right if I wore the T I mean if
[1:11:41] uh you wouldn't see it at church because
[1:11:43] I have long sleeves on so nobody would
[1:11:45] see it but would that be all right well
[1:11:47] there's two ways I can answer that right
[1:11:49] okay so sorry for being dramatic here
[1:11:52] but there's two ways that I can answer
[1:11:54] this and I could say number one I could
[1:11:56] say you
[1:11:59] what you what a
[1:12:03] tattoo you can't be serious that you're
[1:12:05] asking me about wearing a tattoo do you
[1:12:08] realize where people who wear tattoos
[1:12:10] go do you realize what happens to people
[1:12:13] who do that kind of thing how can you be
[1:12:16] in church how how can you be in church
[1:12:18] that long and not know nothing about
[1:12:22] tattoos you are a disgrace to this
[1:12:29] family oh now that's one way I could
[1:12:32] answer the
[1:12:33] question there is another way that I can
[1:12:36] answer the question right he says the
[1:12:38] same thing to me and I can say whoa whoa
[1:12:41] like your grandfather like grandfather
[1:12:43] says
[1:12:46] Whoa and and I I could say w no one's
[1:12:49] ever asked me that all right I'll tell
[1:12:51] you what
[1:12:56] I'll tell you what hang on till after
[1:12:59] supper and I'll get my Bible and I'll
[1:13:02] show you where this is and so after
[1:13:04] supper we sit down and say this is not
[1:13:07] my rule okay tattoos are not my
[1:13:10] deal uh but here it is in the scripture
[1:13:13] because the Bible says that we're not
[1:13:14] supposed to put any markings on on our
[1:13:15] skin and so forth and uh it's it's
[1:13:18] pretty clear it was an Old Testament
[1:13:19] principle and uh that that moral order
[1:13:23] carried over in the New Testament and
[1:13:25] Jesus had that and uh you know brother
[1:13:27] Braham doesn't say a whole lot about it
[1:13:29] because it wasn't really a big issue uh
[1:13:31] back in his day but uh you know we don't
[1:13:33] do it and we look at brother random and
[1:13:35] he didn't do it and so uh you know
[1:13:37] there's there's the the that is a sense
[1:13:39] of Separation the symbol of separation
[1:13:41] from the world and we don't do it
[1:13:42] everybody else is doing it but this is a
[1:13:45] this is an instance where you can make a
[1:13:47] stand and you can you know establish
[1:13:49] your testimony in the class and say hey
[1:13:51] guys you know what there's a line
[1:13:53] there's a line here and I'm willing to
[1:13:54] stand behind that line I know I'm going
[1:13:55] to stand out but you know what uh so you
[1:13:59] know what I'm doing I'm discipling him
[1:14:01] right a disciple is one who's
[1:14:04] taught and you know what in the first
[1:14:08] instance he really didn't hear anything
[1:14:10] hardly after I spit all over him because
[1:14:13] when your mind goes through that it's
[1:14:15] fight ORF flight and he's in defense
[1:14:18] mode and he doesn't hear a thing you
[1:14:21] could put a blood pressure cuff on him
[1:14:22] and his blood pressure go through the
[1:14:24] roof and he literally has got chemicals
[1:14:26] going through his body that will prevent
[1:14:28] him from remembering anything I said and
[1:14:31] the only thing he wants to do is get
[1:14:33] away that's the only thing he's thinking
[1:14:35] about I got to flight I got to flee I
[1:14:37] got to get out of there and I never ask
[1:14:39] Dad a question like that again cuz he's
[1:14:42] going to be like a bear and chew my head
[1:14:44] off but if he has another question now
[1:14:48] he might come back and ask me again if I
[1:14:50] do it this second way does that make
[1:14:52] sense thanks buddy
[1:14:55] so that's in a sense that's what that
[1:14:57] scripture means that we're not we're
[1:14:59] going to respond in a way that doesn't
[1:15:01] provoke him to wrath doesn't turn him
[1:15:03] away okay but now here's what I wanted
[1:15:06] to get to that's not what I wanted to
[1:15:07] tell you about but here's what I want to
[1:15:08] get to is that alternatively instead of
[1:15:12] provoking wrath bring them up this way
[1:15:16] and there's two words here that are
[1:15:17] really important nurture and admonition
[1:15:20] the word admonition is a simple one and
[1:15:22] we'll deal with that first it simply
[1:15:24] means to warn okay so you bring your
[1:15:27] children up to admonish them and and
[1:15:30] when you admonish them you're going to
[1:15:32] warn
[1:15:33] them so here's an example of the same
[1:15:36] word First Corinthians neither murmur as
[1:15:38] some of them did also murmured when they
[1:15:40] were destroyed or to destroy he's
[1:15:42] talking about children of Israel
[1:15:43] wandering in the desert now all these
[1:15:45] things happen unto them the Israelites
[1:15:48] for examples and they are written for
[1:15:51] our
[1:15:53] warning ah got to I got to warn you
[1:15:57] folks the same God that dealt with them
[1:15:59] back there that's the same God we're
[1:16:01] dealing with today and he's the same
[1:16:03] yesterday today and forever and I got to
[1:16:06] warn you that if you mess with him and
[1:16:07] murmur and you start you know
[1:16:10] criticizing Moses and his family ah God
[1:16:15] may just do the same thing again I'm
[1:16:18] just warning you I can't cause this but
[1:16:21] I'm just warning you and and they are
[1:16:24] written all those examples in the Old
[1:16:26] Testament are written that they might
[1:16:27] warn you especially you who upon the
[1:16:30] ends of the world have
[1:16:32] come so here's brother brandom now and
[1:16:35] he says now we have Fellowship one with
[1:16:37] another uh when the blood cleanses us
[1:16:39] from all unrighteousness and I I have
[1:16:41] nothing against denominations he says
[1:16:42] education song festivals joining church
[1:16:44] or whatever it's all
[1:16:46] right but it'll never
[1:16:49] produce all of that stuff will never
[1:16:52] produce until the blood's been applied
[1:16:56] and I got the next sentence in Bowl so
[1:16:58] watch it the blood applied to the human
[1:17:00] heart will always bring a result you
[1:17:02] know why because the life's in the
[1:17:04] blood and when there's a quickening that
[1:17:07] goes on and a person's underneath the
[1:17:08] blood now it's not me but it's Christ
[1:17:11] that lives in me and that's the
[1:17:13] difference so you you'll know and and
[1:17:16] this is where uh the Harvest thing comes
[1:17:18] in because I I took a a grain and I put
[1:17:21] it on the screen and blew it all up and
[1:17:23] magnified it and there's only 3% of that
[1:17:26] grain that has life in it the rest of it
[1:17:28] is all the same as all the hybrid seeds
[1:17:30] it's only this 3% that has the dunamis
[1:17:34] the energy in it and that's what'll
[1:17:36] reproduce and so the brother bram's
[1:17:39] telling us very clearly here that it's
[1:17:40] not uh programs it's not Church activity
[1:17:45] it's not song fests and it's not having
[1:17:47] the biggest church here I mean that's
[1:17:49] nice and he's saying it's nice it's all
[1:17:51] right but you'll never reproduce Christ
[1:17:54] with just that you'll never reproduce
[1:17:57] Christ by sitting in the church or
[1:18:00] having all the message books on your
[1:18:01] shelf it it's it's an encounter with God
[1:18:04] kids hear me it's an encounter with God
[1:18:07] you have to have a personal meeting with
[1:18:09] God and a and a
[1:18:12] conversion and a conversion means that
[1:18:14] there's a death burial and resurrection
[1:18:18] and you know what All Things become
[1:18:20] new and and there's nothing short of
[1:18:23] that do you we're not going to educate
[1:18:24] anybody Beyond around that it's a new
[1:18:27] birth it's an encounter with God period
[1:18:30] and that's what he's telling us so we
[1:18:32] don't we're not I'm not I'm not trying
[1:18:33] to tell you this so you learn how to be
[1:18:35] Christians here I I believe that the the
[1:18:37] the possibility of being a Christian is
[1:18:39] already in you it just needs to be
[1:18:41] quickened but remember now why are we
[1:18:43] talking about families because you want
[1:18:45] to create an atmosphere in your house
[1:18:47] that where the Holy Spirit comes in and
[1:18:48] does his job that's not on your job
[1:18:52] list are we all right so one of the
[1:18:55] things that is important to teach kids
[1:18:58] and and kids listen to this because
[1:18:59] it'll save your parents a lot of wind be
[1:19:02] not deceived God is Not mocked for whoso
[1:19:04] whatsoever a man sth that shall he also
[1:19:06] reap and if you're going to learn that
[1:19:08] principle and respect for the scripture
[1:19:11] and you know what I know a guy some of
[1:19:14] you probably know the the brother uh who
[1:19:17] was a fine he's a fine brother and uh
[1:19:21] lives in out in western Canada but in
[1:19:23] his worldly
[1:19:25] days uh he got involved with a young
[1:19:27] girl and that girl transmitted a sexual
[1:19:31] disease to him that is
[1:19:32] incurable and he still has that disease
[1:19:36] now he's converted he's in the message
[1:19:38] he's a song leader great guy great guy
[1:19:41] but he still has that disease and that
[1:19:43] marks him because he has he has labored
[1:19:47] with this thing about whether he you
[1:19:49] know getting married and all the rest of
[1:19:50] it and it's been a real trial for him
[1:19:53] it's been a real tough thing
[1:19:55] and and it is because you reap what you
[1:19:59] sow and and a a new birth doesn't always
[1:20:02] take away all of our past right cuz you
[1:20:05] know what you're still a you're still a
[1:20:07] coffee and you're still a klet you
[1:20:10] know
[1:20:11] and and and this is something that you
[1:20:14] know even if you're just if kids if
[1:20:16] you're just here you know because your
[1:20:17] mom and Paul told you to be here let me
[1:20:21] tell you God is Not mocked and if you
[1:20:23] don't remember anything else or take
[1:20:25] anything else away you're going to reput
[1:20:27] your soul so s good things because it'll
[1:20:31] make a difference now I got to tell you
[1:20:33] this that when it comes to families too
[1:20:34] and I'll just throw this in for for you
[1:20:36] for you four up here in the front that
[1:20:38] men are different than women so when it
[1:20:40] comes to dealing with uh issues men
[1:20:43] think differently than women right you
[1:20:45] know men are men men and women around
[1:20:47] different thermostats right why do you
[1:20:49] think who do you think invented the Dual
[1:20:51] thermostats in a car it was a married
[1:20:54] man right she says I'm freezing over
[1:20:56] here it's freezing absolutely freezing
[1:20:58] he says I'm I'm boiling up here over
[1:21:00] here well too bad you don't have your
[1:21:02] own thermostat over there H
[1:21:05] ding right men are different than women
[1:21:07] and it's just the way God made them so
[1:21:09] you get a you get a a balanced
[1:21:11] perspective when you're when you're uh
[1:21:14] in your home trying to make things uh
[1:21:16] work out and uh you know it adds the
[1:21:19] spice it adds the color uh in marriage
[1:21:22] it sure surely does and so
[1:21:25] uh marriage was God's idea right it was
[1:21:28] God's idea and by the way this is
[1:21:30] Brother Lonnie Jenkins
[1:21:31] graphic so the male brain is geared
[1:21:34] slightly more towards math and logic
[1:21:37] right like brother Mark over here
[1:21:41] doesn't have an emotional bone in his
[1:21:43] body the
[1:21:45] [Laughter]
[1:21:49] female Hold on Sister
[1:21:53] Marine the female brain is geared a
[1:21:56] little bit more towards
[1:21:59] language I'm just I mean this is just
[1:22:01] science right sorry maybe I should have
[1:22:04] picked another couple
[1:22:06] here
[1:22:08] so a man's brain is wired a little bit
[1:22:11] differently than he has a pretty good
[1:22:15] Central section for food for math
[1:22:19] Building
[1:22:20] Systems he has a very little dot in
[1:22:24] there for for listening skills and a
[1:22:26] very small one for house
[1:22:28] cleaning he has a large section for
[1:22:31] selective
[1:22:34] hearing and all the wives said yeah
[1:22:37] you're better believe
[1:22:39] it and uh you know he's got a car
[1:22:42] fixation section he's got a tool section
[1:22:44] he's got a little dot in there for
[1:22:46] chores but is the building supplies are
[1:22:49] pretty big and that's just the way a
[1:22:51] man's brain is wired a woman's brain is
[1:22:53] different she has a large chocolate
[1:22:55] Center she has the indecision Center is
[1:22:59] rather large
[1:23:00] too um Telephone social media it's
[1:23:05] large uh listening is it's there sense
[1:23:10] of direction neuron is a a
[1:23:13] pinpoint and uh jealousy is a commanding
[1:23:17] thing and I love the shoe and handbag
[1:23:20] coordination Center that's that's
[1:23:22] important right uh you you know the
[1:23:24] shopping Gene anyway all I'm saying is
[1:23:27] that men are different and women are
[1:23:28] wired differently and they do things
[1:23:29] differently they shop differently I
[1:23:31] don't know if you noticed
[1:23:32] that they shop quite differently now
[1:23:35] this is a a uh I I used to teach this
[1:23:38] and then I found a diagram and I thought
[1:23:39] this is great somebody else thought of
[1:23:40] it thought of it too now when I shop I'm
[1:23:43] a Hunter and I I go in the mail see the
[1:23:46] mail on the right side over there or on
[1:23:48] your on the right side and I need a pair
[1:23:50] of pants well I'll go in I'll park at
[1:23:52] the door nearest to the store store I
[1:23:54] want to go to right and I'll go in that
[1:23:57] door I'll go in the you know one turn Bo
[1:24:00] there in the store I'll find an employee
[1:24:03] first I'll say where are the pants for
[1:24:05] me uh right here sir they're on the
[1:24:07] mannequin take them off the mannequin
[1:24:09] here we go
[1:24:12] out 6 minutes $33 I'm out the door right
[1:24:16] victory is mine victory is mine now when
[1:24:19] my wife and I would go shopping she'll
[1:24:21] go in she'll go in the front door and
[1:24:22] say oh now that I meant to go here and
[1:24:25] she'll turn right and she'll
[1:24:27] go all through the mall and pick up
[1:24:30] stuff and she oh so and so's birthday's
[1:24:32] coming and we got a wedding in the
[1:24:33] church and sister such and such is
[1:24:35] having a baby and blah blah blah so we
[1:24:37] come to the end of her time and we have
[1:24:39] three hours spend 26 minutes and
[1:24:41] $876,000
[1:24:54] I'm not making a joke or anything but
[1:24:56] this is scientifically proven okay that
[1:24:59] men's uh thinking is very spatial it's
[1:25:01] segmented and and in their minds they
[1:25:03] think in boxes okay so this is the way
[1:25:07] it is so if the wife says we got to do
[1:25:10] something about these kids he goes right
[1:25:12] to the kids box and he says all right
[1:25:14] what do we need to do he's the Marines
[1:25:16] he comes in all right hit hit hit hit
[1:25:19] you
[1:25:20] know kids get out here bang in the rooms
[1:25:23] El they go all right honey what's next
[1:25:26] he's got that box ticked right that's
[1:25:28] the way men are and everything in his
[1:25:30] life is in a box women don't have
[1:25:34] separations they don't have those little
[1:25:36] lines that run between there so they
[1:25:39] tend to look like
[1:25:42] this so if I ask brother Mark a question
[1:25:45] how much money is in the bank at the
[1:25:47] church he'll go boom right to that box $
[1:25:51] 3829 bang close the door
[1:25:55] gone if I asked sister Marine over here
[1:25:58] sister
[1:25:59] Marine
[1:26:01] um how'd you enjoy church well I I I
[1:26:05] just I was just saying to the kids the
[1:26:06] other day and you know what at church we
[1:26:09] had uh a minister that was talking about
[1:26:11] things and I wasn't really sure what I
[1:26:13] was going to wear to church but uh you
[1:26:15] know here we are and we had a dinner
[1:26:16] after you know and I figured out what
[1:26:18] we're going to have for dinner
[1:26:19] afterwards but me and Mark you know we
[1:26:20] get along pretty good but on this one
[1:26:21] particular topic you know there's a
[1:26:23] little bit of a difference here and uh
[1:26:24] you know uh it's just amazing and I read
[1:26:27] this on social media same thing so you
[1:26:29] see what she's doing she's going all
[1:26:30] over the place because she doesn't have
[1:26:34] lines I'm not I'm not criticizing her or
[1:26:37] him it's just that's science that's just
[1:26:39] the way it is so all I'm saying to you
[1:26:41] is that when it comes to how uh a a wife
[1:26:44] will look at the problem in a household
[1:26:46] or a need to change she'll look at it
[1:26:48] differently than how a man will and
[1:26:50] that's just the way that it is so now
[1:26:53] let's get let's get back on track your
[1:26:55] fathers provoke not your children to
[1:26:57] wrath but bring them up in the nurture
[1:26:59] let's talk about nurture nurture is a
[1:27:01] great word and I'm going to talk all
[1:27:03] about nurture for the rest of this
[1:27:05] service here as long as we've gotten I
[1:27:06] don't know how long we've got when do we
[1:27:08] start seven oh you're just saying that
[1:27:11] because you're the pastor did you start
[1:27:13] at s y all right so nurture means the
[1:27:17] whole training and education of children
[1:27:19] related to the cultivation of minds and
[1:27:23] morals
[1:27:24] using commands admonitions reprove or
[1:27:26] punishment or whatever whatever you need
[1:27:30] to do to train your children it includes
[1:27:33] training care of the
[1:27:35] body cleaning up your
[1:27:38] room giving a mature and seeing the
[1:27:41] chore
[1:27:42] accomplished instruction aimed at
[1:27:45] increasing
[1:27:46] virtue so parents are going to use
[1:27:49] whatever it takes in order to to to
[1:27:52] begin that character development in
[1:27:54] their children that's what this word
[1:27:56] nurture means and it's not going to
[1:27:58] happen overnight it's not going to
[1:28:00] happen in one setting it's going to
[1:28:02] happen over time God gives you that time
[1:28:07] to be able to uh begin the process of
[1:28:09] doing this now God takes
[1:28:11] over right because once they get married
[1:28:13] or they feel like I hey I got the World
[1:28:15] by the tail I'm out of here I'm gone I'm
[1:28:18] married whatever else you know and they
[1:28:19] think they're they're they're ready now
[1:28:21] to handle life God knocks on the door
[1:28:23] and says
[1:28:26] ever heard of
[1:28:29] adoption but it also includes the
[1:28:31] definition also includes whatever in
[1:28:33] adults cultivates the soul especially by
[1:28:37] correcting mistakes and curving passions
[1:28:39] and if you ad adults don't make any more
[1:28:41] mistakes I'd like to talk to you after
[1:28:42] church but we still make mistakes we
[1:28:45] still say stuff we wish we never said we
[1:28:47] still do things we never want really
[1:28:50] want to do and so whatever and this is
[1:28:53] where this word is important whatever in
[1:28:55] adults and God will use whatever he's
[1:28:58] really good at using things around you
[1:29:00] that you never thought he'll uh you know
[1:29:02] he'll use your job or he'll use your
[1:29:04] children or he'll use your finances or
[1:29:07] he'll use an incident at church or
[1:29:09] whatever whatever to cultivate the
[1:29:12] Soul by correcting mistakes and curving
[1:29:15] passions God will do that now one of the
[1:29:18] first things that you have to learn
[1:29:19] about this whole process of
[1:29:21] transformation are youall still okay
[1:29:22] everybody all right watch in Deuteronomy
[1:29:25] Deuteronomy is great because Moses is
[1:29:28] teaching the people how they're going to
[1:29:30] live in a land they're not in
[1:29:33] yet he's on this side of the river
[1:29:35] Jordan and he's telling them you're
[1:29:37] going there here's how you're supposed
[1:29:38] to live there which is exactly in a
[1:29:41] sense what this message is doing and
[1:29:43] what what preaching does It prepares us
[1:29:46] for another place we're not being
[1:29:47] conditioned to live here outside of
[1:29:49] learning how to you know the Christian
[1:29:50] walk but we're being prepared for
[1:29:52] another kingdom right God is God is
[1:29:54] molding and shaping us for another
[1:29:56] kingdom how he's doing that is he's
[1:29:58] teaching us to live by the word so we
[1:30:00] live by the word here because you're
[1:30:02] going to live by the word over there
[1:30:03] right so he says this in in Deuteronomy
[1:30:07] 6:17 and by the way the book of
[1:30:10] Deuteronomy incidentally happens to be
[1:30:12] the book that Jesus quoted most of of
[1:30:15] all the Old Testament books it's a great
[1:30:18] book ye shall diligently keep the
[1:30:21] Commandments of the Lord your God and
[1:30:22] His testimonies and statutes which he
[1:30:24] commanded thee go back and read it
[1:30:27] again ye shall keep the
[1:30:30] Commandments of the Lord You're
[1:30:34] G read it again ye shall keep
[1:30:38] it because you're never going to be able
[1:30:42] to pass it onto your children until you
[1:30:45] have it in your
[1:30:47] heart 20 starts the family stuff and
[1:30:50] when thy son ask thee in time to come
[1:30:52] why don't we wear a tattoo why can't we
[1:30:54] go to a movie theater why don't we do
[1:30:56] this why don't we do that why do we have
[1:30:57] to wear our hair this way right when
[1:31:00] thaty son ask thee questions up the road
[1:31:03] uh you you're going to uh you know
[1:31:04] you're going to have the the the answer
[1:31:07] here but you know where it's got to be
[1:31:08] first it's got to be in your heart
[1:31:10] first you shall keep
[1:31:13] diligently and if you don't have it in
[1:31:15] your heart your kids will figure that
[1:31:17] out pretty quickly because listen the
[1:31:21] distance between your life and the
[1:31:25] book will influence your
[1:31:28] children if the book says this and you
[1:31:31] live here your children will respect
[1:31:33] more what you say but when the book says
[1:31:36] this and you're living over
[1:31:38] here they're looking at that saying
[1:31:41] you're not doing what this
[1:31:43] is and you know what they're going to
[1:31:44] say
[1:31:46] next I don't want to be a part of
[1:31:48] something that makes me like that
[1:31:54] can I go
[1:31:56] on all
[1:31:58] right I'm sorry there's all kinds of
[1:32:00] things here that I told you it was a
[1:32:03] series in the Book of Job it says in
[1:32:05] chapter one I I find job an incredibly
[1:32:08] intriguing book I don't understand it
[1:32:10] very much I'll be honest with you I
[1:32:11] don't understand it in all my studies
[1:32:13] I've only gotten to chapter one uh but
[1:32:16] there's some amazing things here and
[1:32:17] this is where God and Satan have a
[1:32:20] conversation about
[1:32:22] job and
[1:32:24] Satan says H that not made a hedge
[1:32:26] around about him and about his house and
[1:32:27] about all that he hath on every
[1:32:30] side so who made the Hedge God did
[1:32:33] because Hedges are
[1:32:35] good I said Hedges are good Hedges tend
[1:32:38] to keep the bad guy out and keep the
[1:32:41] good people within
[1:32:42] sight and hedges are good and they're
[1:32:45] good and God believes in Hedges cuz he
[1:32:48] put one around job and when God puts you
[1:32:50] behind the Hedge you're pretty safe I'd
[1:32:53] rather be behind the Hedge that God
[1:32:55] makes to not have a hedge at all or find
[1:32:57] a way to break through
[1:32:59] it cuz you're going to get in trouble
[1:33:01] when you break through
[1:33:02] it so Satan is saying that you know job
[1:33:06] is almost Untouchable as long as he's
[1:33:08] behind the Hedge and I you know if you
[1:33:10] brought him out from underneath that
[1:33:11] hedge or remove the Hedge you know what
[1:33:13] he'd be vulnerable now we know that job
[1:33:15] was not because he had uh he was a
[1:33:17] prophet he was a man of God and so forth
[1:33:20] but let me tell you what what it was
[1:33:21] like behind the Hedge now this is just
[1:33:23] one instance here this is verse one was
[1:33:27] a man of O whose name was job and he was
[1:33:28] perfect and upright and one that feared
[1:33:30] God and shoot evil now you have to the
[1:33:32] the Hebrew word here is he's
[1:33:35] aik meaning he was a righteous man for
[1:33:39] his day Noah was a Tek it's I I'm not a
[1:33:44] Hebrew person but he was a the Bible
[1:33:47] says that Noah was was a faithful man in
[1:33:51] his day so you might look at Noah's like
[1:33:53] and think wow you know he wasn't very
[1:33:55] righteous compared to us but in his day
[1:33:58] God considered him a righteous and
[1:34:00] perfect man and his sons went this is
[1:34:03] amazing his sons went and feasted in
[1:34:04] their houses everyone in his day and
[1:34:07] they s and called for their three
[1:34:08] sisters to eat with and drink with them
[1:34:10] and it was so when the days of their
[1:34:12] feasting were gone about and job sent
[1:34:14] and
[1:34:15] sacrificed them job sent and Sanctified
[1:34:18] them sorry big difference and Rose up
[1:34:20] early in the morning and offered burnt
[1:34:22] offerings according to the number of
[1:34:24] them all for job said it may be and my
[1:34:27] sons have sinned and curs God in their
[1:34:28] hearts now I asked myself the question
[1:34:31] why is job offering
[1:34:35] sacrifices and they haven't
[1:34:38] sinned they may
[1:34:40] have but he's offering sacrifices anyway
[1:34:43] why is he doing this why in the world is
[1:34:46] job going through this process and if
[1:34:49] you go back and follow brother brandom
[1:34:51] statements the burnt offering is the
[1:34:52] only protection they had from the wrath
[1:34:55] of God because the blood offering was
[1:34:58] was what uh stopped the Judgment in the
[1:35:00] Garden of Eden and all the other places
[1:35:02] that he had knew in the Old Testament so
[1:35:04] why is he offering sacrifices and they
[1:35:07] may not have sinned at all what's the
[1:35:09] point well I had looked a long time and
[1:35:11] I was studying the I I look in the
[1:35:13] Hebrew language very carefully and what
[1:35:14] I found was
[1:35:18] that job was
[1:35:20] afraid of a spirit of entitlement
[1:35:24] now here's where your kids are old
[1:35:25] enough need to follow me he was afraid
[1:35:28] his kids would be influenced by a spirit
[1:35:31] of
[1:35:32] entitlement we're job's
[1:35:35] sons and you know what we've been to all
[1:35:38] the
[1:35:39] camps we know all the great
[1:35:42] ministers we've been around a long time
[1:35:44] and after all my father is a
[1:35:46] prophet and if you let that Spirit go
[1:35:49] long enough you'll eventually feel
[1:35:52] pretty comfortable with venture in
[1:35:54] outside the
[1:35:56] Hedge cuz you know what I'm job's
[1:35:59] son and I we can take a little liberty
[1:36:03] here we can do a little of this and a
[1:36:07] little of that because job's my dad and
[1:36:10] if we get in trouble job will bring us
[1:36:14] back that's a dangerous
[1:36:17] place for kids who are raised in the
[1:36:19] message to get
[1:36:21] to you can feel like my dad's the pastor
[1:36:25] or my dad uh you know he's a deacon in
[1:36:28] the church and you start to feel like
[1:36:30] well we've been in the message a lot of
[1:36:32] years I've been to all the camps and so
[1:36:35] you can easily in this age get a spirit
[1:36:37] of entitlement that feels like well God
[1:36:39] owes me that's a dangerous place to
[1:36:44] be no matter who your father is or who
[1:36:46] your mother is you need to stay behind
[1:36:48] the
[1:36:49] Hedge because God puts the Hedge there
[1:36:51] for your protection and when you get an
[1:36:53] attit that I don't need to be behind
[1:36:54] this Edge I got it you know what I'm
[1:36:56] job's son it's all
[1:36:59] right dangerous place to
[1:37:02] be and that's why job offered sacrifices
[1:37:05] all the time as he was afraid if that
[1:37:07] Spirit got a hold of them they'd be
[1:37:10] exposed to the wrath of God so I'm going
[1:37:13] to offer an offering to be over them in
[1:37:16] case they get that attitude and brother
[1:37:18] ramam said that was a real
[1:37:20] father you cannot replace prayer
[1:37:24] praying for your children
[1:37:27] continually CU you know what you may be
[1:37:29] the only thing that's standing between
[1:37:32] them and the wrath of God to come and as
[1:37:34] long as they have that measure of
[1:37:36] protection God has a channel to meet
[1:37:39] with them and deal with their heart
[1:37:40] remember now you're not the Savior but
[1:37:42] you're creating an atmosphere and a
[1:37:44] channel through which God can deal with
[1:37:45] them does that make
[1:37:47] sense all right let me let me go fast
[1:37:50] here and let me skip you can have all of
[1:37:52] this it's all here
[1:37:54] we need to think about as parents I'll
[1:37:55] leave the the PowerPoint with you
[1:37:57] they've got it done the men in the sound
[1:37:58] booth down here have it what we need to
[1:38:01] ask questions especially today what do
[1:38:02] we allow our kids to participate in you
[1:38:05] know friends what kind of friends do
[1:38:06] they have what kind of dress what kind
[1:38:07] of travel and so forth and relationships
[1:38:10] do do we allow them to have do we allow
[1:38:12] sleepovers do we allow uh you know uh
[1:38:15] them to have their their own access to
[1:38:17] the internet you know or whatever and I
[1:38:20] put this graph on the right hand side
[1:38:22] because now nearly half uh of teens say
[1:38:24] they use the internet almost constantly
[1:38:26] so you look at the difference between
[1:38:28] 2014 when Al Gore invented the internet
[1:38:31] in
[1:38:32] 2022 uh it's doubled so these are kids
[1:38:35] that are getting all of their
[1:38:37] information from the internet they're
[1:38:38] getting all of their feedback they're
[1:38:40] getting all of their data from the
[1:38:42] internet and they're looking at that and
[1:38:44] the amount of friends they have the
[1:38:46] likes that they have all of that it's
[1:38:48] it's exponential here in terms of how
[1:38:51] kids are getting their feedback in other
[1:38:52] words who's where is the absolute
[1:38:56] today and that's a really good question
[1:38:59] you can tell these are not message kids
[1:39:01] but you can tell this is pure research
[1:39:03] and you can tell that kids are not
[1:39:05] getting their information from their
[1:39:07] parents they're not getting it from
[1:39:09] school or whatever they're not getting
[1:39:11] it from any Sanctified Source they're
[1:39:13] getting it online they're getting it
[1:39:14] from their
[1:39:17] peers and I learned a long time ago
[1:39:20] Proverbs 13:20 he that walketh with the
[1:39:22] wise shall be but a companion of fools
[1:39:24] shall be destroyed and if you want to
[1:39:27] you want to find destruction pretty
[1:39:28] quick you hang around with fools who are
[1:39:30] the fools in your life the people your
[1:39:33] age they they're foolish because they
[1:39:35] think they know everything right what
[1:39:37] teenager doesn't think they know
[1:39:38] everything but if you want to be wise
[1:39:40] you hang around with wise people wise
[1:39:42] people are older people who've been
[1:39:43] around been there done that got scars to
[1:39:46] prove it probably got some advice to
[1:39:47] give
[1:39:48] you am I okay all right what should we
[1:39:52] allow our kids then to participate and
[1:39:53] how do we establish boundaries when it
[1:39:55] comes to all of these areas here okay so
[1:39:58] now here's where here the problem is is
[1:40:02] this this is what I wanted to get to the
[1:40:04] four four issues of corrective
[1:40:06] discipline now I can't I can't do it all
[1:40:08] here but uh let's can we take a little
[1:40:10] run at it that' be all right or I could
[1:40:14] say just give me five more minutes and
[1:40:16] you know that that's not
[1:40:20] true I love this statement I use this
[1:40:22] statement everywhere now brother bam
[1:40:24] says we got to think about our young
[1:40:25] people he says we got children so we got
[1:40:28] to think of others as coming on behind
[1:40:30] us that's that intergenerational
[1:40:31] responsibility thing right we got to
[1:40:34] think of those things coming on behind
[1:40:35] us these young people and so forth and a
[1:40:37] place for our children our daughters we
[1:40:39] don't want them out in the world and
[1:40:41] things like that we want them girls
[1:40:43] raised like their
[1:40:47] mothers and the pastor is going to make
[1:40:50] arrangements for
[1:40:51] that does that what it
[1:40:55] says and the holy spirit's going to make
[1:40:57] arrangements for that that's not what it
[1:41:01] says it
[1:41:03] says we going to make arrangements to
[1:41:06] that we're going to make our home a
[1:41:08] place where we can where kids can come
[1:41:10] home and bring their
[1:41:11] friends we're going to make uh you know
[1:41:15] uh Fellowship in the church Friday
[1:41:16] nights have young people I don't know
[1:41:17] what you do but you know we're we're
[1:41:19] we're going to have a place the pastor's
[1:41:21] house or whatever else or brother Mark's
[1:41:22] house or
[1:41:24] uh sorry he's shaking his head no make
[1:41:27] sure you tell him
[1:41:31] no we we have as as a as an assembly you
[1:41:36] don't need to have a quota you don't
[1:41:37] need to have 75 people or 100 people or
[1:41:39] 500 people but we as an assembly we're
[1:41:42] going to we're going to say hey we're
[1:41:44] going to provide some activities for
[1:41:45] kids maybe an outing on Saturday maybe a
[1:41:47] hockey game maybe or something else you
[1:41:48] know we're going to we're going to spend
[1:41:50] some time together so they can Bond they
[1:41:52] can create friendships and they can
[1:41:54] enjoy one another's company because you
[1:41:55] know what we'd rather have a mixing with
[1:41:57] Believers
[1:41:59] than we're going to stay inside the
[1:42:01] heads rather than outside the heads
[1:42:03] right remember people outside the heads
[1:42:05] have tattoos right don't forget
[1:42:07] that and if there's a tomorrow we don't
[1:42:10] know we don't know that there's if
[1:42:11] there's no tomorrow we haven't done
[1:42:12] anything but at been at the Master's at
[1:42:14] our posted Duty that is your duty take
[1:42:18] it from me you don't have your kids long
[1:42:20] you're gone right all of a sudden
[1:42:21] they're gone look at these people over
[1:42:22] here floundering and wandering around
[1:42:25] with nothing to do now because their
[1:42:27] children are all
[1:42:32] gone I I I love that because brother
[1:42:35] Braham is making sure we understand he's
[1:42:37] not giving this responsibility to
[1:42:38] anybody else that's
[1:42:41] us now ideally number one spiritual
[1:42:44] discipline is about the heart and
[1:42:47] ideally the best way for your children
[1:42:49] to be disciplined is to hear it in
[1:42:50] church or read their Bible and God
[1:42:52] Quicken it to say I got it I got it I
[1:42:55] need to have an experience with
[1:42:57] God what's your name right there yeah
[1:43:02] what John come on up
[1:43:06] John appreciate
[1:43:09] John I need a helper John John is my son
[1:43:15] and I come on up here now you're not
[1:43:17] going to get sit down like your ugly
[1:43:18] brother John good to have you
[1:43:22] buddy now John is Young and he's uh
[1:43:25] growing up and he's at how old are you
[1:43:28] uh 10 10
[1:43:33] whoa he's he's at a point in life where
[1:43:35] he's starting to ask questions about
[1:43:38] things right God God might be dealing
[1:43:39] with him and he's thinking you know
[1:43:43] brother so and so got baptized last week
[1:43:45] and I just I'm just feeling like that
[1:43:48] might be might be time for me you know
[1:43:51] in other words he's he's thinking about
[1:43:53] it through the week and thinking about
[1:43:54] it you know and I don't know he's just
[1:43:57] hadn't told anybody but just you know
[1:43:59] thinking about it because up to now
[1:44:02] everything he believes is what his
[1:44:04] parents basically told him what they
[1:44:07] brought him to church and had him here
[1:44:09] that's what he that's what he believes
[1:44:11] but there's a difference in that in
[1:44:13] having his own experience with
[1:44:15] God and sometimes when kids had their
[1:44:19] own experience with
[1:44:21] God it could seem like they're
[1:44:25] rebelling because he's not doing things
[1:44:27] now because Dad said so or mom said so
[1:44:30] he's doing things because God's dealing
[1:44:32] with him and if you're not a wise parent
[1:44:34] you can interpret that wrongly as
[1:44:36] Rebellion because you know what up to
[1:44:41] now up to now he's got his father's
[1:44:47] mantle he's got his father's Faith he
[1:44:51] grew up with that where'd you get this
[1:44:54] jacket somebody gave it to you hey when
[1:44:58] kids are brought up that's where they
[1:44:59] get their Fai somebody gave it to him
[1:45:01] right somebody taught him somebody said
[1:45:04] believe this read this memorize this go
[1:45:07] to church and hear that right it's not
[1:45:09] coming from within it's coming from
[1:45:11] without right and so he he's in church
[1:45:16] he's got his father's
[1:45:18] faith and and that's what he's wearing
[1:45:22] but he comes to a place in life where he
[1:45:24] figures
[1:45:25] out that's my father's faith it ain't
[1:45:29] mine I need to have my own that's right
[1:45:34] so you know what he does he takes that
[1:45:36] off take it off
[1:45:38] there and all of a sudden hey hey
[1:45:41] hey what what are you leaving the church
[1:45:44] or something are
[1:45:46] you go ahead and take it
[1:45:48] off you know what he's doing he's doing
[1:45:51] the right thing he's taking off someone
[1:45:53] else's Faith so he can put on his
[1:45:57] own and that's what he needs to do this
[1:46:00] is
[1:46:02] mine and I need to put this on this is
[1:46:05] mine now you're old enough to have your
[1:46:07] own and he needs to have his own faith a
[1:46:10] wise father guides him through the
[1:46:15] fitting and putting on the putting on
[1:46:17] the faith something that he understands
[1:46:19] he
[1:46:20] believes and you know what he's going to
[1:46:22] be way more more comfortable with his
[1:46:24] faith on than my faith on when he
[1:46:26] reaches this age of accountability when
[1:46:29] he reaches this age
[1:46:30] here and if I jump on him because he's
[1:46:33] taken my faith off I'm going to provoke
[1:46:35] him to wrath and that's what I don't
[1:46:38] want to do because you want to have your
[1:46:40] own experience with God and he might
[1:46:41] step out and say you know I just got a I
[1:46:44] just I I he's he's a newborn he doesn't
[1:46:47] know anything he doesn't he kind of
[1:46:49] doesn't know how to act on his own
[1:46:51] because he's new at all of this but you
[1:46:53] know he he knows I mean it's it's the
[1:46:55] Holy Spirit actually dealing with him
[1:46:57] and he's he's he's actually doing the
[1:46:58] right thing looks awkward sounds awkward
[1:47:01] and he might flounder quite a bit in
[1:47:03] that season but you know what he's doing
[1:47:05] the right thing you weren't so
[1:47:07] surefooted when you came into the faith
[1:47:09] either and knew everything right you
[1:47:11] were kind of floundering around and
[1:47:12] thinking oh this is God and it wasn't
[1:47:14] and this is the devil and it
[1:47:18] wasn't he just needs to have his own
[1:47:20] experience with God but but with we got
[1:47:23] to be careful we don't interpret that as
[1:47:25] Rebellion now there are kids who Rebel
[1:47:28] right there are kids who Rebel and you
[1:47:30] know they they they want they want to
[1:47:31] get away and all the rest of it you know
[1:47:32] and they're they're not uh uh respectful
[1:47:36] of the the message and so forth you know
[1:47:38] and hey again that's where prayer comes
[1:47:41] in because when you recognize your kids
[1:47:43] are going through that you need to be
[1:47:44] really putting a hedge of prayer around
[1:47:47] this guy that he'll make the right
[1:47:49] decisions right time that that the devil
[1:47:51] doesn't reach in in that that time and
[1:47:54] plant things in there hey
[1:47:57] buddy right and you people in the church
[1:48:01] grandparents I'm giving you something to
[1:48:03] do grandparents here see this happening
[1:48:06] and they you know what they they should
[1:48:09] be joining in prayer over this guy too
[1:48:13] because one of the best things
[1:48:14] grandparents can do is come alongside
[1:48:15] parents that are trying to raise their
[1:48:17] children in the admonition of the Lord
[1:48:19] and pray for him
[1:48:21] too I tell my grandkids all the time I
[1:48:24] say hey you got a question you got a
[1:48:25] problem you come to me I'm not going to
[1:48:27] tell you anything different than your
[1:48:28] folks tell you but you you always have
[1:48:29] somebody to come to you always do that
[1:48:33] okay bud back to your seat thanks
[1:48:36] John so this is this ideally this is
[1:48:40] where we want to have it happen inside
[1:48:41] here in the heart and we want to have it
[1:48:43] to come from rather than have given him
[1:48:45] instruction all of his life we want to
[1:48:47] have it coming from the outside in all
[1:48:49] right so you remember Daniel Daniel goes
[1:48:51] off from Jerusalem to Babylon remember
[1:48:55] that he's only 13 or 14 or 15 years old
[1:48:58] he's hardly shaving and he's taken off
[1:49:01] into Babylon as one of the favored few
[1:49:03] and he's picked by the king and he's in
[1:49:05] there and so forth and then all of a
[1:49:06] sudden he figures out wow I can't eat
[1:49:08] this food it's offered to Idols so he
[1:49:10] says to the keeper you keep the food I'm
[1:49:12] not going to go and have that dinner you
[1:49:14] bring me vegetables and I'll have that
[1:49:16] and uh give me 10 days and watch how it
[1:49:18] turn out where did he get that
[1:49:21] from how did Daniel know that at 10 12
[1:49:24] 13 he was probably 13 or 14 or 15 by the
[1:49:27] chronology if you work out the
[1:49:28] chronology that's about how old he was
[1:49:30] just a young guy but he's got enough
[1:49:32] knowledge and enough conviction in his
[1:49:34] own heart that he's doing the right
[1:49:36] thing because I know I know that's wrong
[1:49:39] and I'm just going to trust God wow
[1:49:41] great for a young guy you know what
[1:49:43] brother brandham said brother brandham
[1:49:44] said that Daniel could do that because
[1:49:46] he communed with Jehovah before he left
[1:49:51] Jerusalem that's what he say
[1:49:54] Daniel had a relationship with God
[1:49:56] before he left Jerusalem cuz now he's in
[1:49:58] Babylon and there's no churches there's
[1:50:00] no Rabbi there's no parents there's no
[1:50:02] uh Scrolls there's no nothing now he's
[1:50:05] got to have it on the inside or he's
[1:50:07] going to be pulled aside with the
[1:50:10] calans but he communed with Jehovah and
[1:50:13] we want John down there to commune with
[1:50:15] Jehovah as a as a parent you should be
[1:50:17] praying that your child goes through
[1:50:20] that that transformation that that that
[1:50:23] process that stepping stone across the
[1:50:25] bridge from where it's just me telling
[1:50:27] him you want him to have his own
[1:50:29] experience and his own meeting with God
[1:50:31] so he can stand on his own two feet and
[1:50:34] recognize when he's out there without
[1:50:36] mom and dad and he's out there without
[1:50:37] the pastor and he's out there without a
[1:50:39] message book in his hand and he's out
[1:50:40] there among amongst of uh amongst a
[1:50:43] bunch of heathens out there and they all
[1:50:45] want to put a tattoo on he can say nope
[1:50:48] my body's a temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:51] whoa
[1:50:52] amen we don't want him to say well
[1:50:54] brother brandom said I couldn't the
[1:50:56] Bible says I couldn't my pastor says I
[1:50:58] couldn't we want him to say no I know my
[1:51:01] body is a temple of the Holy
[1:51:03] Ghost are you getting my
[1:51:06] point so the spiritual dis discipline we
[1:51:09] want to have that and allow God deal
[1:51:11] with him and brother brandom says uh the
[1:51:13] church he said all they all let down the
[1:51:15] bars and they all sing when they let
[1:51:16] down the bars and compromise with iny
[1:51:18] let down the bars and the Sheep got out
[1:51:19] how did the goats get in he says he let
[1:51:21] down the bars where does that start that
[1:51:23] does not start with children that starts
[1:51:25] with
[1:51:26] parents children don't decide in a
[1:51:28] household to let down the bars if they
[1:51:30] do I need to have a parents conference
[1:51:34] here it's the
[1:51:36] parents who are letting down the
[1:51:39] standards because there's been a mass
[1:51:42] transfer of authority in our culture
[1:51:45] whether you realize it or not a mass
[1:51:47] transfer of authority from parents to
[1:51:49] children and children are calling the
[1:51:51] shots children don't want to be told
[1:51:54] children want to run the show they want
[1:51:55] to do what feels good and they want to
[1:51:57] do what everybody else is doing and the
[1:52:01] parents crazy as it is the parents have
[1:52:03] given authority to Children they've
[1:52:06] given their Authority and their position
[1:52:08] to Children it should not be among us
[1:52:11] you let down the standards of
[1:52:12] Christianity and the devil might have
[1:52:13] went out of fashion as and got on of
[1:52:15] business and so
[1:52:16] forth now I I'm sorry I'm just I'm just
[1:52:20] going to have to go quickly here he that
[1:52:23] speth the rod hateth his son but he that
[1:52:25] loveth him chasteneth him
[1:52:30] betimes the rod and of reproof they give
[1:52:32] correction they give wisdom but a Child
[1:52:34] Left to himself bringeth his mother to
[1:52:36] shame you can't disregard the scripture
[1:52:39] and have a come out right I said you
[1:52:42] can't disregard the Bible and have a
[1:52:43] come out right you can't ignore the
[1:52:46] principles of scripture and have a come
[1:52:47] out right look around at your
[1:52:49] Society we were at the hotel uh staying
[1:52:52] and and we we came on uh Friday and when
[1:52:55] we got there it was like
[1:52:58] whoa whoa there were people dressed up
[1:53:01] in the most perverted and
[1:53:04] crazy demonic looking costumes and so
[1:53:08] forth and I thought they were all
[1:53:10] hanging around outside the door and I go
[1:53:12] inside the door and there's more of them
[1:53:14] inside the
[1:53:16] door and I'm looking around I asked the
[1:53:19] lady at the desk I said what is this
[1:53:23] she said it's a comic book
[1:53:26] convention uh you know the what do you
[1:53:29] call it the graphic novels and whatever
[1:53:32] they
[1:53:33] are and uh so the kids who are there
[1:53:36] they're all kids they're all young
[1:53:38] teenagers and stuff they're all dressing
[1:53:40] like these characters in these books and
[1:53:42] they're they're all mingling around and
[1:53:44] I
[1:53:46] thought in the words of brother Mark
[1:53:50] whoa and I thought but for the grace of
[1:53:52] God you know I
[1:53:54] mean where is this thing like what's
[1:53:57] next what's it going to be like in 5
[1:54:00] years in this
[1:54:01] world it's
[1:54:03] nuts and and and this is exactly what
[1:54:06] Solomon is trying to tell us a long time
[1:54:08] ago you leave children to themselves and
[1:54:10] this is where it goes it it doesn't work
[1:54:13] it doesn't come out
[1:54:14] right you you can take a look at all of
[1:54:17] these things here now all right the
[1:54:19] second issue is
[1:54:21] verbal verbal discipline it's the actual
[1:54:23] work of getting the heart and the soul
[1:54:25] and the mind working in the same
[1:54:28] direction Brethren Romans 1212 Brethren
[1:54:31] I beseech you by the mercies of God that
[1:54:32] you be not conformed to this world but
[1:54:36] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:54:37] mind that you may prove what is the good
[1:54:39] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:54:41] conforming means that whatever it is
[1:54:43] like in the world you're going to be
[1:54:45] like that and transforming comes from
[1:54:47] within and that's the big
[1:54:49] difference and brother brandom is you
[1:54:51] know I mean he this is a key scripture
[1:54:54] for brother Brandon he preaches major uh
[1:54:56] sermons on this issue here
[1:54:59] but to me in in terms of verbal
[1:55:02] discipline we're we're going to try to
[1:55:04] encourage our kids to resist wrong ideas
[1:55:05] and resist wrong people uh because of
[1:55:09] what they're doing not because
[1:55:10] everybody's evil and we're going to
[1:55:13] discipline ourselves to stay uh with the
[1:55:16] word and just trust the Holy Spirit Will
[1:55:18] um tap us and let me if nobody's ever
[1:55:22] told you this before you should be
[1:55:23] thankful you have a
[1:55:25] conscience because a conscience is God's
[1:55:28] Little tool to make you think about what
[1:55:29] you're doing and whether I should make
[1:55:31] the next step and and Paul says I keep
[1:55:34] under my body bringing in the subjection
[1:55:35] I'm sorry I'm having to run it through
[1:55:36] it here but the discipline of the will
[1:55:39] uh should be consequence
[1:55:41] oriented so if you do this this is going
[1:55:44] to happen like Samson you don't give
[1:55:46] away your secret of your hair he he
[1:55:49] maintained his strength he maintained
[1:55:51] his testimony the converse is also true
[1:55:53] you give away the secret you're going to
[1:55:54] lose your strength and God is Not
[1:55:57] mocked what you you're going to reap
[1:55:59] what you sow so we're we're looking at
[1:56:02] channeling and and focusing on Behavior
[1:56:06] here
[1:56:09] now brother bam said now you notice
[1:56:11] people they'll say well I accepted the
[1:56:12] Lord and you take the word for it I
[1:56:14] can't judge God does but in 10 years
[1:56:16] they haven't progressed a bit and
[1:56:17] staying in the same old
[1:56:20] place every day your heart hunger is
[1:56:23] moving on there's something growing
[1:56:24] inside of you and I will tell you this I
[1:56:27] I'll just say this from a message
[1:56:29] perspective that we we you know as nice
[1:56:33] a church as you have nice Minister as
[1:56:34] you have and all the good things that
[1:56:36] you have here I I would encourage you
[1:56:38] never get settled down to the place
[1:56:39] where we got it we're we're good there
[1:56:42] should be in every heart a longing in
[1:56:44] our heart and you know the ministry uh
[1:56:46] without even attempting to do this stirs
[1:56:49] up something inside of a Believer like
[1:56:51] we stir up within ourselves and you
[1:56:53] realize a there's got to be more I want
[1:56:55] more I don't want to no matter how good
[1:56:57] it is here I don't want to stay here I
[1:56:58] want to I want to go to where I belong I
[1:57:00] want to go to where God's calling me and
[1:57:02] that's a deep calling to deep that's a
[1:57:04] theophany here don't don't neglect that
[1:57:07] voice that voice is pulling you into
[1:57:08] another dimension and you got to allow
[1:57:11] that to happen that's what God wants to
[1:57:12] do not to be settled down here and to
[1:57:14] become uh you know mundane and in a in a
[1:57:17] rut here let me tell you a rut is only a
[1:57:19] a a coffin with the ends kicked out you
[1:57:21] don't want to stay here you want to keep
[1:57:23] moving on and keep moving on and that's
[1:57:24] what he's saying here that that when you
[1:57:26] hear people say well we don't want to we
[1:57:28] don't want to witness to anybody we
[1:57:29] don't want to you know have uh any um uh
[1:57:33] you know we just we we're we're content
[1:57:35] where we are I'm not content where we
[1:57:36] are I'll tell you what the more I see
[1:57:38] the less content I am about this world
[1:57:40] the more I look at my body aging I I'm
[1:57:42] less content with
[1:57:45] it if a birth is born a child grows it
[1:57:49] lives well the Christ in your heart
[1:57:50] ought to be growing day getting bigger
[1:57:53] more powerful understanding things
[1:57:54] better forgiving walking as God would
[1:57:56] till Christ be formed in you the hope of
[1:58:02] glory and the last I you just listen
[1:58:05] these are sermons in themselves I'm
[1:58:06] sorry sister Brenda I'm sorry uh if
[1:58:09] maybe I'll come back if the weather is
[1:58:12] good the physical discipline is if
[1:58:16] number three is working on the will
[1:58:17] number four is for the
[1:58:19] won and you spareth a
[1:58:23] rod and you hate your son but he that
[1:58:25] loveth him chasen him be
[1:58:27] times in our house coffee
[1:58:31] house my house
[1:58:34] not my house there were three ways kids
[1:58:37] got a
[1:58:40] spanking you know there's three kinds of
[1:58:42] people in the world people who can count
[1:58:45] and the people who
[1:58:47] can't there there was a way to get a
[1:58:50] spanking in our house number one if you
[1:58:53] told a lie because the Bible directly
[1:58:56] says you should put away lying so if
[1:58:59] they told a lie there there was a
[1:59:00] spanking consequence for that number two
[1:59:03] if he destroyed property so if I took my
[1:59:06] brother's toys and beat him up or hit
[1:59:09] him and and destroyed him left him out
[1:59:11] on purpose and they rusted or whatever
[1:59:13] else you destroyed property Psalms 1
[1:59:17] 1915 that's an
[1:59:19] infraction with malice of forethought
[1:59:22] there's going to be a consequence for
[1:59:24] that I will meditate in thy precepts and
[1:59:26] have respect unto thy
[1:59:28] ways and that's what David had to learn
[1:59:30] he had to learn respect for God's ways
[1:59:32] somebody else's ways and then thirdly
[1:59:36] disrespect when there was blatant
[1:59:38] disrespect and disrespect can be
[1:59:39] interpreted like this I need you to go
[1:59:41] clean up your rooms now because we're
[1:59:43] going to have
[1:59:44] company and roll the eyes rolling of the
[1:59:47] eyes is
[1:59:50] disrespect and and you know what the
[1:59:52] word whatever is
[1:59:54] disrespect because sometimes your
[1:59:57] parents can tell you uh you shouldn't do
[1:59:59] that you shouldn't do that to your
[2:00:00] brother's things you shouldn't stomp on
[2:00:02] his toys like that
[2:00:04] whatever that's
[2:00:07] disrespect or if your parents tell you
[2:00:10] something or your pastor tells you
[2:00:11] something you shouldn't be sitting there
[2:00:13] in your heart going
[2:00:15] whatever heard that
[2:00:18] before remember your heart speaks louder
[2:00:20] than your words
[2:00:23] and you're going to get in trouble in
[2:00:25] our house you got in trouble for those
[2:00:26] three things those are the three things
[2:00:27] that that were made very clear to our
[2:00:29] boys and and they were going to get in
[2:00:30] trouble with that brother B says mother
[2:00:33] daughter that's not mother yet hey I
[2:00:35] just a couple more minutes really if
[2:00:38] your child was out there in the street
[2:00:40] and them Renegades were running through
[2:00:41] the street half drunk and the kid is
[2:00:42] going to get killed you'd say well
[2:00:44] darling just go ahead and sit on the
[2:00:46] street I want you to feel good about
[2:00:47] yourself I want you to have a good self
[2:00:50] uh identity
[2:00:52] and feel confident and positive about
[2:00:55] yourself brother Bram said you wouldn't
[2:00:57] love the baby if you acted like
[2:00:59] that real love would get out there and
[2:01:01] put it on such discipline spank it till
[2:01:03] it did stay out on the street all right
[2:01:05] so let's say you got a
[2:01:07] one-year-old or a two-year-old because
[2:01:09] two-year-olds are
[2:01:11] terrible and you got to plant you got to
[2:01:15] is this being
[2:01:17] recorded two-year-olds are lovely we
[2:01:19] love two-year-olds so let's say you have
[2:01:21] a plant and you have it real nicely done
[2:01:24] brother Mark did it for you and you got
[2:01:26] it hang in a prominent place in your
[2:01:28] house and that 2-year-old comes over and
[2:01:30] you know gets up here and he's starting
[2:01:32] to pick the leaves off
[2:01:40] that what I would do is grab that
[2:01:44] two-year-old before they get to the
[2:01:46] plant hold them on by the foot and say
[2:01:49] no before they get there no
[2:01:53] you know what they're going to
[2:01:57] do and they're going to whine and cry
[2:01:59] and sit down and whine and cry it's
[2:02:01] going to sound
[2:02:02] terrible and you're going to go right
[2:02:04] back at it and they go back again and do
[2:02:07] it and you grab them by the foot and
[2:02:08] hold them restrain them no tell them no
[2:02:10] tell them no several
[2:02:14] times and they're going to whine and cry
[2:02:16] and resist and scratch and bite and kick
[2:02:18] and everything else and they're going to
[2:02:19] go back at it again you grab them by the
[2:02:21] foot and hold on to
[2:02:23] him they probably do that all day
[2:02:26] probably do that for a
[2:02:27] week until they cross the line and they
[2:02:30] come to a point where they're going
[2:02:31] going for the plant and they're looking
[2:02:33] at
[2:02:34] you and you say no and they'll stop
[2:02:38] before they reach out for it and they'll
[2:02:41] stop because you know what you do you're
[2:02:43] trying to do you're trying to make them
[2:02:45] understand that no means
[2:02:47] something they got to know that no means
[2:02:51] something
[2:02:52] and they'll eventually come to the place
[2:02:53] where they know that if they reach out
[2:02:55] for that and they grab a hold of that
[2:02:56] there's going to be a consequence for
[2:02:58] that so they'll they'll come to it and
[2:03:00] they'll look around and see what you're
[2:03:01] going to do before that and then you're
[2:03:04] then you're helping them to understand
[2:03:05] what no
[2:03:08] means oh come on now think about
[2:03:10] this you don't need to be violent you
[2:03:12] don't need to be rough or you nothing
[2:03:13] like that but you remember when brother
[2:03:15] brandham was invited to go with the
[2:03:17] Pentecostal people remember
[2:03:19] that and his mother-in-law said no not
[2:03:22] taking my daughter among
[2:03:24] that he had to learn what it meant when
[2:03:28] God said no you don't listen to her you
[2:03:30] listen to
[2:03:33] me and God wants you to understand as
[2:03:36] Believers the meaning of
[2:03:37] no there's boundaries there's limits and
[2:03:40] you want to teach your children that
[2:03:42] know means
[2:03:44] something and you know what you got to
[2:03:45] do you got to put yourself into that and
[2:03:47] you got to work at that because it
[2:03:48] doesn't happen once when you do it once
[2:03:50] you probably got to do a thousand
[2:03:52] times and even if they're spoiled brats
[2:03:55] you probably got to do a little bit more
[2:03:57] but they got to understand what no
[2:04:00] means because when you give into them
[2:04:02] all the time and they have their own
[2:04:06] way they come to the place where they're
[2:04:08] they're not even hearing you when you
[2:04:10] say
[2:04:13] no until they start to vocalize it and
[2:04:16] say no back to
[2:04:19] you brother bam said you don't love your
[2:04:22] baby unless you're out there making sure
[2:04:25] this does not
[2:04:26] happen now I wish I had more time more
[2:04:28] examples here but that that's that's
[2:04:31] what he's trying to tell us here well
[2:04:33] you say I'll mingle around a bit God
[2:04:34] give you a real oldfashioned spanking
[2:04:36] for that and I'll tell you if we had
[2:04:37] more of that in the natural today we'd
[2:04:39] have better
[2:04:42] children you will have better children
[2:04:45] because you leave them alone let them
[2:04:47] have their own way and when they learn
[2:04:49] to squall and control you through
[2:04:50] squalling and control you through crying
[2:04:53] and control you through going to the
[2:04:54] other parent and getting their opinion
[2:04:56] and playing one off the other somebody
[2:04:58] the old people are not in their head not
[2:05:00] because they're
[2:05:04] asleep and those children try to control
[2:05:06] you by tantrums and everything else
[2:05:09] you're not giving them Liberty by
[2:05:10] letting them have a
[2:05:12] tantrum they need to know what no
[2:05:16] means and if you don't teach them
[2:05:17] anything else you teach them that in
[2:05:18] other words they they learn to have
[2:05:20] boundaries here so he says God wants his
[2:05:22] household straightened out and he gives
[2:05:24] you a little whipping so you may get
[2:05:25] straightened out makes you love him
[2:05:28] more it makes you love him more let me
[2:05:30] tell you when the Holy Spirit corrects
[2:05:32] me I don't hate him at the end of it I
[2:05:34] love him more I'm thankful Lord thank
[2:05:36] you for showing me that thank you for
[2:05:39] helping me to understand that that
[2:05:42] principle and Lord I I I don't want to
[2:05:44] live that way I don't want to I don't I
[2:05:46] don't want to make that mistake again
[2:05:48] and and that's that's exactly what the
[2:05:50] holy spirit is trying to teach you and
[2:05:51] he is has a way of doing that doesn't
[2:05:53] have to be violent or anything
[2:05:55] else doesn't have to be vicious or mean
[2:05:57] or anything else like that
[2:06:02] sorry I'd like you
[2:06:10] to I'm going to end with
[2:06:16] this sometimes God has unusual ways of
[2:06:18] doing things he has unusual ways of
[2:06:20] getting our attention
[2:06:23] maybe you've never heard this story once
[2:06:25] upon a time there's a family of wward
[2:06:26] church members who had once been active
[2:06:29] and lost all interest in church and had
[2:06:31] fallen away and they were the father and
[2:06:34] three sons Jim John and Sam and the
[2:06:37] elders had talked to them about their
[2:06:38] lost condition preacher visited many
[2:06:41] Brethren talked to him about their lost
[2:06:43] condition tried to get him to come back
[2:06:45] to church but to all this didn't seem to
[2:06:48] do the least bit of good
[2:06:51] one day when all the boys were out in
[2:06:53] the field the pastor a large rattlesnake
[2:06:56] bit John and he became ill the doctor
[2:07:00] was called and after an examination he
[2:07:01] pronounced John to be in very critical
[2:07:04] condition doctor said about all we can
[2:07:06] do now is pray the father said call the
[2:07:10] preacher tell him of John's condition
[2:07:12] and he asked the preacher to pray for
[2:07:14] John's recovery and this was his
[2:07:17] prayer oh wise and righteous father we
[2:07:20] thank you for the thou and thy wisdom
[2:07:22] sent this rattlesnake to bite John in
[2:07:25] order to bring him to his
[2:07:26] senses he has not been inside the church
[2:07:29] for all these years and it's doubtful he
[2:07:31] has in that time felt the need for
[2:07:33] prayer and now we trust that this will
[2:07:35] prove a valuable lesson to him and it
[2:07:37] will lead to genuine repentance and now
[2:07:39] father wilt thou send another snake to
[2:07:41] bite Sam and another one to bite Jim and
[2:07:44] another big one to bite the old
[2:07:46] man we've been doing everything we know
[2:07:48] for years to restore them but to no
[2:07:50] avail it seems therefore that our
[2:07:52] combined efforts could not do what this
[2:07:54] snake has done we thus conclude that the
[2:07:56] only thing left that this family will do
[2:07:59] this family any good as rattlesnakes so
[2:08:00] Lord send us bigger and better
[2:08:02] rattlesnakes in Jesus name we
[2:08:08] pray don't underestimate sorry sister
[2:08:11] Betty she's laughing uncontrollably back
[2:08:19] there don't underestimate God's ability
[2:08:21] to to come out of left field and do
[2:08:22] something you're not expecting to get
[2:08:24] your
[2:08:25] attention whether you're young or old
[2:08:28] and it often happens when you get in a
[2:08:29] rut you don't you know you don't see a
[2:08:31] need to change you don't see a need to
[2:08:33] correct things and all of a sudden whoa
[2:08:35] there's a catastrophe there and all
[2:08:36] you're you're doing everything you can
[2:08:38] now that's biblical in order to make it
[2:08:43] work sorry let
[2:08:46] me you you can have all of this it's all
[2:08:49] here let me I'm just getting to a quote
[2:08:52] brother Braham said well you say I know
[2:08:55] men and women musicians if you'll come
[2:08:56] cuz that's the breaks if you'll come I
[2:08:58] know men and women that didn't didn't
[2:09:00] teach their children and wasn't
[2:09:02] Christians and here's what brother
[2:09:04] Braham said the very thing of not
[2:09:05] leading your kids to
[2:09:08] Christ was the wrongest
[2:09:11] thing they could ever
[2:09:15] do the very thing of not leading their
[2:09:17] kids to Christ was the wrongest thing
[2:09:19] that they could ever do besides the
[2:09:21] other not to lead them to
[2:09:24] Christ you can't have a correct Union
[2:09:26] he's talking about a marriage Union
[2:09:28] without Christ and the fellowship
[2:09:31] broken the most important thing you can
[2:09:33] do is lead your kids to Christ now
[2:09:35] remember now you're not a savior but
[2:09:38] your job is to create an atmosphere into
[2:09:40] which the Holy Spirit can visit whenever
[2:09:42] he
[2:09:43] wants and and the important thing is for
[2:09:46] you to prepare your children and let
[2:09:49] them know it's not because you're in
[2:09:51] this church you're born again it's not
[2:09:54] because you're uh part of the choir that
[2:09:57] you're you're born again that's like
[2:09:58] saying that if I swim in the ocean uh
[2:10:01] then I'm a whale no
[2:10:06] no if you're in a church it doesn't mean
[2:10:09] you're a born- again
[2:10:10] believer you have a meeting with God you
[2:10:12] have a born- again
[2:10:14] experience that means that you're a
[2:10:18] Believer so I will tell you that one of
[2:10:20] the most powerful things you can do and
[2:10:22] the most profitable things you can do is
[2:10:25] to lead your children to Christ and and
[2:10:27] maintain that atmosphere that the holy
[2:10:29] spirit's always welcome that's a job in
[2:10:31] our world today that's a
[2:10:33] job I pray that God will will help you
[2:10:36] to do that I I pray that without being
[2:10:39] legalistic without being dogmatic about
[2:10:42] it and without taking the attitude what
[2:10:44] we let the kids do whatever they want
[2:10:45] they're little they don't feel good
[2:10:47] right all the rest of but to have that
[2:10:49] balance that allows you to be able to
[2:10:53] keep things in the home in a way that
[2:10:55] the holy spirit is pleased with it
[2:10:57] pleased with what you're doing not
[2:10:58] perfect none of us are perfect there's
[2:10:59] no perfect homes there's no perfect
[2:11:01] parents no perfect kids ask the
[2:11:09] kids but we're going to do all we can by
[2:11:11] the grace of God we're going to do all
[2:11:12] we can with the help of the
[2:11:14] Lord to keep that atmosphere right let's
[2:11:17] stand to our feet and let's stop there
[2:11:22] that' be the most important
[2:11:26] thing you can
[2:11:29] play let's pray Heavenly
[2:11:36] Father we are so thankful Lord for this
[2:11:39] opportunity that we have Lord to be able
[2:11:41] to assemble in your house Lord and I
[2:11:42] apologize for keeping the people so long
[2:11:44] I just pray that you would maybe
[2:11:47] something might be deposited in their
[2:11:48] hearts like a good seed that will grow
[2:11:50] into a great Tree in in their lives Lord
[2:11:52] something that will become fruitful and
[2:11:54] help them Lord in their Endeavors this
[2:11:56] is not an easy age to raise children
[2:11:58] it's not an easy age to have Christian
[2:12:00] families but Lord you would never have
[2:12:02] left us here unless it is possible
[2:12:05] somehow so Lord I pray that you would
[2:12:07] help us to use wisdom and use all the
[2:12:09] resources that are available to
[2:12:11] us the Bible and the message and all the
[2:12:14] great teachings that we have Lord may we
[2:12:16] apply them not just come to church and
[2:12:18] listen to them but may we apply them in
[2:12:20] our lives time for us to take this
[2:12:22] message home and apply it from the front
[2:12:24] door all the way to the
[2:12:26] back and Lord I I pray that you'd
[2:12:28] forgive us Lord for mistakes we've made
[2:12:30] in parenting all of us have Lord and
[2:12:33] things maybe if we could only if we only
[2:12:35] could get them back if only Lord we
[2:12:38] could have another chance but time has
[2:12:40] passed by and time is not always kind to
[2:12:43] us so Lord we're just asking and praying
[2:12:46] that you
[2:12:47] would have your way in our hearts and
[2:12:49] our lives Lord bless these families
[2:12:51] bless the young people that are here
[2:12:54] Lord and may they learn deep in their
[2:12:57] hearts that God is Not mocked he's not a
[2:13:00] respector of
[2:13:02] persons but we should always maintain a
[2:13:04] respect for the things of God have your
[2:13:07] way Lord we PR pray bless brother John
[2:13:09] sister Blanca and the family Lord and
[2:13:11] all those who labor with them here that
[2:13:13] this may become truly a lighthouse a
[2:13:15] place of safety Lord where people can
[2:13:17] run to and be
[2:13:19] saved may your anointing rest rest upon
[2:13:21] this place in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:13:24] pray

[2:14:12] kman
[2:14:14] cover
[2:14:16] me
[2:14:17] Cover
[2:14:19] Me cover
[2:14:24] me amen did you enjoy that this evening
[2:14:27] amen it's good to have rubber meets the
[2:14:30] road preaching amen you know I'm my
[2:14:33] nature is I like a
[2:14:35] challenge uh you know brother
[2:14:37] Joe works with me at the gym and you
[2:14:41] know I think it's a coffee corlette
[2:14:42] thing that they're always testing and
[2:14:44] pushing each other and you know I've but
[2:14:48] the Joe has realized that he's weaker
[2:14:50] than I am and so he comes to me for
[2:14:52] guidance and strength and encouragement
[2:14:54] and these things and I found the
[2:14:56] greatest way to motivate him is tell him
[2:14:57] I don't think you can do
[2:15:00] it he likes to challenge a different way
[2:15:02] he likes to prove me wrong and he does
[2:15:04] on a regular
[2:15:05] basis but you know I love it when
[2:15:07] somebody gives you a challenge and they
[2:15:09] say here's how you can do
[2:15:10] it not just because it's one thing to to
[2:15:14] look at it and and they say well you
[2:15:15] need to get better because I I heard a
[2:15:17] lot of things I need to do better amen
[2:15:21] as he said we're always growing we're
[2:15:22] always increasing in the things of God
[2:15:24] but he didn't just tell us to go do it
[2:15:27] he showed us how to do it showed us what
[2:15:29] it looks like not just by words but by
[2:15:31] examples and even his own life and as
[2:15:33] we've seen it in our mothers and fathers
[2:15:35] that did it but I loved how he started
[2:15:36] and said my ceiling should be my
[2:15:38] children's platform where I finish ought
[2:15:40] to be their kicking off point because
[2:15:43] they ought to be learning from our
[2:15:44] mistakes and our experiences you know I
[2:15:45] was talking with some senior ministers a
[2:15:48] number of years ago when they said this
[2:15:50] they said the young PR preachers they
[2:15:52] said they're light years ahead of where
[2:15:53] we were when we were young preachers you
[2:15:55] know why because the older preachers
[2:15:58] have been teaching the younger preachers
[2:15:59] so that the younger preachers start
[2:16:01] where the old preachers are letting go
[2:16:03] and it's just a continuation of the work
[2:16:05] then rather than a a step back and then
[2:16:08] they've got to come up to that and I
[2:16:09] feel that's that was such a good word of
[2:16:11] instruction is that our children don't
[2:16:12] have to start at the level we did they
[2:16:14] can start at the level where we where we
[2:16:16] let them go amen that's the way it
[2:16:18] really ought to be and but it struck me
[2:16:20] me as he was talking that there's one
[2:16:22] thing that makes this work and that's a
[2:16:25] real relationship with Jesus Christ as
[2:16:27] parents that's the only way this is
[2:16:29] going to work hypocrisy won't work a
[2:16:31] religious spirit won't work it takes a a
[2:16:34] a mother and a father that have a
[2:16:36] testimony daily of the the realities of
[2:16:39] God in their life of healing of
[2:16:42] provision of guidance of Direction and
[2:16:45] all these different things that we we go
[2:16:47] through that that we can say God hears
[2:16:49] God's listening God cares and we can we
[2:16:52] can share a testimony with our kids
[2:16:54] Jensen came up to me before the service
[2:16:56] uh before the the the preaching started
[2:16:58] and he said Dad the the rash under my
[2:17:00] arms is already gone amen that's what
[2:17:03] we're looking for that when we pray God
[2:17:06] answers because he's God of he's a god
[2:17:09] of his word amen not not not a god of
[2:17:11] what I say but he's a god of what his
[2:17:13] word says and that's what we're pointing
[2:17:15] to that's the absolute you know what I
[2:17:17] liked how he said discipleship is the
[2:17:19] only response that we ought to have as
[2:17:20] parents is to teach our children the
[2:17:23] right thing to do by the word of God not
[2:17:25] because we feel or not because we're
[2:17:27] angry or not because we're proud these
[2:17:29] different things but because the word of
[2:17:31] God is our light and it's our Direction
[2:17:33] amen it just struck me how we need that
[2:17:36] simple humble Victorious Christian walk
[2:17:38] daily that that's the need for us as
[2:17:40] parents as as members of a family as a
[2:17:42] church body is that when we're all
[2:17:44] Walking In Christ by the word amen we
[2:17:46] can see some tremendous things that
[2:17:48] happen in our midst that poor forun it
[2:17:51] was so good he says we've got to make
[2:17:52] arrangements to raise our kids
[2:17:54] properly we can't put it on the pastor
[2:17:57] thank you for that brother
[2:17:59] Barry can't put it on the rest of the
[2:18:01] people as parents we've got to we've got
[2:18:03] to make arrangements for for taking care
[2:18:06] of our kids time and their energy and
[2:18:08] their interests and these things because
[2:18:10] if we don't Supply it the world will
[2:18:11] absolutely Supply it free of charge no
[2:18:14] strings attached
[2:18:16] amen and then are we building Hedges to
[2:18:19] protect or lowering the ours to allow
[2:18:21] things in that was a big challenge that
[2:18:24] was a big
[2:18:26] challenge cuz so often what we want to
[2:18:28] do is get closer to our kids so we allow
[2:18:31] things when we ought to get closer to
[2:18:33] them because they learn that we love
[2:18:35] them and we do what's best for them no
[2:18:37] matter what amen and every family is
[2:18:40] Sovereign God deals with us as
[2:18:42] individuals as parents as individuals as
[2:18:44] a couple as individuals and so we can't
[2:18:46] push our our way of doing things on
[2:18:48] others amen I me I appreciate that
[2:18:50] brother Barry that was very good I'm
[2:18:51] going to definitely steal those slides
[2:18:53] and roll through them and I won't say
[2:18:55] I'll preach a series on it cuz I feel
[2:18:56] like I'd be stealing your ministry and
[2:18:58] your thunder but certainly I saw Lots in
[2:19:01] there I started writing and he skipped
[2:19:02] and he skipped and he skipped so I I
[2:19:04] want to go back and and go through that
[2:19:06] so God bless you for that amen we're
[2:19:09] going to sing just a song or two and
