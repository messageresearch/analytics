Revelations chapter 3 and as your turn I would just want to make a quick announcement that uh the slides from the services are now being uploaded to YouTube so if you look in YouTube in the in just the description below the the video then he'll have a brother vaishal has put a link there to a to an online folder so if you're you know you're in service and you're writing notes and I know I go quickly and you can't remember what I said or what the quote was or the scripture was now you don't have to go and play through the entire sermon at a fast speed or scroll you can just go in the slides that are in the file there and you can get them yourself so we thought that would be helpful for those that sometimes like to go back and read or reference things and and it would just be available to you there so trusting that'll be a blessing men's small crowd Tonight I almost wish we could get everyone to move up a little closer preaching the back of the church amen but we're thankful for each one that's come out Revelation 3 verse 21 says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne amen God bless you you can have your seats and and this evening it's a it's a bit of an exciting time for me because I've been preaching so much on on the requirements of an adopted son or an adopted daughter of God and and we preached on those things and I know that as I'm preaching these things it can turn into a bit of a checklist it can feel like you know brother John's just up there and he's just writing this longer and longer and more detailed checklist of what we're supposed to be and who we're supposed to be and the characteristics we're supposed to have and the nature and the attitudes and all these things and what ends up is we end up with this scroll or the this this thick notepad of all the things we're supposed to be and we look at it and we say how in the world am I going to be all of that we look look at our lives and we say how in the world am I going to be what he's talking about up there and and of course Satan's there to point us to our failures and our our our faults and our flaws and all these different things and so tonight I'm just going to preach and I'm going to teach and I'm going to teach and I'm going to teach and I told brother vaishal and brother Matt I sent them the slides I said I said Don't Fear this is the longest slide deck I've ever brought to church but I'm going to be doing a lot of teaching so I move quickly when I'm teaching I don't tend to get hung up so unless the Lord slows me down I think we'll be okay tonight but I want to take a a a service title today called the way of adoption and we've been speaking about adoption we've been speaking about overcoming and we've been we've been talking about what it means to be a real believer in this age and we this we know this is the age of the Overcomer Amen in every age is an age of an overcomer but there is a specific Overcomer for this age and they're supposed to overcome a specific thing and every age had their their challenge their trial their difficulty their attitude that they had to overcome and we've got one as well amen and the scripture does not say to him that believeth to him that has Revelation to him that understandeth it says to him that overcometh amen so the requirement for the believer here in this age is as every other age that we must be an overcomer Above All Things amen we still have to believe we still have to have revelation we still have to have faith but we must be an overcomer in this age with what we're facing today so I want to I want to maybe build us up on this idea of of how you can be an overcomer how you can be an adopted son of God how do you pass the test how do you go through the training of God how do you sit under the leadership and the training of the Holy Spirit and come through try it as gold how do you get to that place how do you how do you develop into what it is that you're supposed to be as a son or daughter of God and and like I said I'm hoping to move quickly through this and the slides will be available to those that need them afterwards but that's because it's not rocket science the scripture is not difficult the scripture says the way is that even though a man was a fool he won't err in it amen it's not supposed to be difficult and I think sometimes what happens is we build up this big idea of what we're supposed to be and we forget the Simplicity of what it is to be a Christian because brother Brown would talk about that simple humble Victorious Christian life amen and that's where we really want to find our place so I want to start with as we're going there and I'll be preaching out of the message mostly how can I overcome and I want to tie the scriptures to the quotes here and and we'll just move through as we go and I want to start with this because it says in Ephesians 4 and he gave some Apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints the first purpose of the fivefold ministry is to bring you to Perfection not sinless Perfection but to maturity that's the first thing it says for the work of the ministry it's to bring you for the work of the ministry not just them they're already in the ministry but there is a Ministry for each and every one of us amen for the edifying of the body of Christ so the gifts that are given in the fivefold ministry are not for ourselves to use it is for your edification it's for the edification of the entire body of Christ how long until we come to the unity of the faith I believe brother Bram says that is the rapture but there's a Unity that has to happen here between all of the bride of Christ the global Body of Christ and Christ himself it says and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man Peter talks about that unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children we're talking about adoption and that's why I start here is that the effect of the true five-fold Ministries that it takes you from children to adults it takes you from children to adopted Sons and Daughters of God which will be the manifested sons of God and Daughters of God toss to and fro you can't be tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but what speaking the truth in love if the words that come over this Pulpit are not dripping with love they won't have the right effect so I've got to keep my attitude I've got to keep my spirit I've got to keep my motive my objective right otherwise there's a tainted message that's coming across this pulpit and that's what I've got to do that's up to me to take care of he says what that they may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ brother Brown would say this he says but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment Goes Forth from the house of God and here is where we come Together We Gather in love with one another as only Christians can love there are things that happen in this church as in every every other message church or true believing Church there are things that happen here that can happen anywhere else and it's because We Gather in love that's why we can take correction we can take it when God is personal with us we can take it when our toes get stepped on these different things it's because we know that God's love is here and he's manifesting it through the preaching of the word he says but in here we are under the leadership of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is among us and we're here to take Reckoning among us to see where our short places are are our shortcomings and how how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be and that's what we study ministers study those places for their people when they see the people the lack then they begin on that they begin on that that what where the lack is not with what you have but what you don't have what good is it to me to preach what you already have you need what you if you have need of something else that's what we need to bring here he says what now what a day what a time that we're living how that we should check up church now we talk about these things coming that's going to come we've been preaching about the full manifestation the adoption of the sons of God that's what's coming our way he says now today let's drop back here and see check ourselves and see if we're right in the faith so this is how he starts this whole idea on how can I overcome he says you've got to come with the right purpose you're going to overcome by recognizing why it is you're sitting under the preaching of the word why it is that you come to church amen this is after the preaching of the seals and that makes a difference to some people it doesn't make a difference to me but it's after the preaching of the seals and brother Brad I'm saying we've got to check up we have the opening of the word we have an understanding of these great Revelations but he says we've still got to check up because this is a time to check up because there's great things coming our way and we don't want to be the hindrance we don't want to be left outside the ark amen we want to be on board with these things what is it great Revelation is not a replacement for an overcoming life Revelation goes hand in hand with overcoming because a true Revelation has an effect in your life otherwise it's just head knowledge amen now we pointed to the fivefold ministry and they're they're a portion in overcoming in their place and the fivefold ministry will have an effect they've got to have an effect because they're anointed for purpose and there's got to be something that comes out of that amen there's got to be a Unity Among Us that cannot be broken and not just in a Unity as in a denomination where it's us for and no more but a Unity under the headship of the Holy Spirit under the headship of Christ in our lives but this is not the only time God's working on us relationship is not just built on Wednesday and Sundays it can't just be the one and a half hours maybe that I'll preach tonight or or the hour on Sunday mornings or something like that relationship is a day by day thing that we build up can you imagine husbands if we only spend time with our wives an hour and a half or two hours a week what would our relationship look like it'd be a mess wouldn't it so we've got to have something greater than what's just coming over this Pulpit there has to be something that's going on on a weekly basis on a daily basis that that helps us in these things brother Brown would continue he says and almost all every quote in this except for a couple is from how can I overcome he says now I want to take my subject this morning of how can I overcome now I chose this because I think that it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day and Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ could live and we must never we must never let that Revival die within us now it sounds like I'm putting pressure on us but I'm not but I'm talking about the way of adoption the way to be adopted and this is the first one and that's don't let the relationship die don't let the Revival die don't let the Love Die For Christ in your life you've got to keep that awake you've got to keep that fed you've got to keep on top of it you've got to keep feeding it you've got to keep contributing to it that's the only way it's going to work because otherwise you're going to get cold and you're going to get formal and you're going to get starchy because it's just something in your head rather than something that's being expressed in our heart amen we're being restored we're being redeemed we're being revived back to what we were we are not now what we will be Paul said but there's going to come a day where we are exactly what he said we're going to be we're being restored we're being revived back to fullness of life that's what the Resurrection The Rapture is that's the ultimate Revival is when now you have eternal life and you have a new body that won't die and won't be sick and won't cause you problems the way it does today amen but we've got to be focused on that idea of Revival not Revival in the shouting and dancing and everything because the strongest relationships aren't full of shouting and dancing all the time you might ask men we're not sweeping our wives off of their feet every day and our wives are not seducing us every night either there's a stability that comes with it but there's a constancy that comes with a relationship that's being worked on every day and that's what he's looking for is a priority in our lives amen he says now notice each Church age the same overcome when they eat Sun out of each Church age overcame the temptation of that age every age has a Temptation and everyone has to overcome that way he says the same now see I said to you at the beginning you are born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated and you're in a defeated World amongst defeated people amongst defeated Creeds defeated denominations you've got to come to Victory some way some other way he says it's just like a lily a lily I think is one of the prettiest flowers that there is how it's in Radiance now where does it come from it's what it's a little seed you say brother John I'm a little nothing this evening perfect you're just like what he's talking about where is it it's down in the bottom of a muddy monkey pond now if I was to tell that Lily that one day you're gonna be up above the muck in the pond and right now you're just a hard little seed and nothing can seem to get to you and you're surrounded by the filth and the detritus of all of the ocean or the pond that you're in but one day you're going to be up there and you're going to be this beautiful white blossomy flower with green leaves and everyone will look at you and wonder about you and how beautiful you are and admire you if I put that checklist in front of a lily while it's down in the bottom in a seed form what would it say ain't no way ain't no way look at me brother John look at me I'm just a little seed I don't look anything like that but there's something inside it that will bring it to that place if it gets in the right conditions amen that's what you've got to realize is what you have right here is just conditions but that's not you that's just how you look right now that's just how the situation looks that's just how the world works but that's not what matters he says but that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right then when it's in that mud but it has to strive daily what knowing that there is something knowing that there is something within it that is more than what it sees and feels right then there is something that is calling there's something that's pulling from the inside on these things it's black it's dirty it's Mucky it's slimy in that slime that it's living in yet it presses its way through the mud the muck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hidden it all the time he says I think that's an overcomer that once in sin did once did things that were wrong don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong then but now why look back into the pond again God by his predestination has brought the sea to life and it's pressing itself see it's coming to light and now on top of all of that it has overcome see it didn't Express itself down there it's getting up to express itself neither did you in your sin in adultery in everything that you lived in you didn't Express nothing but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into light and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight it brought out what you really was in the beginning you see what I mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily the Lily didn't even know what a lily looked like until it became what until it came into the presence of the Sun its shape was different all the way through its different stages first that had to rot the shell and break it open then it's just a little sprig and it's going up up and it's just a vine it's just a long skinny thing and it's not till it gets to the top that that bud opens up and it really realizes what it is he says we're the same thing he says you laid your heart open and now you're a Lily that's the Overcomer he overcome the mod he overcome the things of the world and now he freely gives himself out everyone can look at him his life you can't put a finger on it see he's a real Overcomer you can't say nothing about him now say well he came out of the mud but he's not in the mud now you're not in the mud now don't worry what you came out of worry about where you are now that's what matters we all come from different backgrounds we all come from different situations we all have different genetics we all have natural flaws don't worry about that where are you now are you going towards the light he's not in the mud now he's on top of it amen you can't now point back what he was what is he now he's on top like the Lily he's above the darkness the of the mud he's above the darkness of the Muddy Waters he's in the light reflecting the beauty that was put in him before he left the Mahdi man he says now I feel like a shouting Christian when you can finally express it when it's finally real when it's finally been made manifest when we can finally see what this has all been about that's when we want to shout but that's why we've been given a more sure word of Prophecy that's why we've been given an open word is so that we can Rejoice through the process understanding that the change is bringing us to the final change when we'll be exactly as he was amen amen what was in there by God at the beginning it pressed its way through it overcome it overcome the shell it overcome the shell it overcome the mud it overcome everything we surrounded our lives with it overcome the waters it overcome everything and wasn't Overcomer and reflected the Beauty and the glory of God we can look at our lives and we can say it was a mess in some areas it still is a mess and there's things that are trying to bury us and drown us and cover us up but as long as we're drawn by the Light we're going to come through eventually some of us are in shallower ponds than others some of us draw it a little better than others but don't worry as long as you're drawing you're going to get to the top and you'll you'll be able to see what it was all about amen that's the overcoming part amen getting past what's all around you so you can bloom into what God has for you what pulls it out does the Lily pull itself out no the sun pulls it out being in the presence of the Sun in the light in the warmth that is what pulls it out lilies don't bloom in the winter under the ice they bloom in the spring and in the Summers everything heats up and it pulls them out of where they were amen it responds to the Sun that's what causes overcoming responding to the Sun responding to the presence of God responding to the presence of the holy spirit in your lives amen we're talking about overcoming we're talking about passing the test and the first thing to realize is that you're built to pass the test you're made to pass the test amen you're built to come through everything that's around you to rise above it and to produce what's been inside you by what God's predestination that's what an overcomer is is somebody is built from the beginning to overcome you've been called to be an overcomer there's a prize for the Overcomer and if there's a prize it means there's somebody that's going to get it and it's got to be you and it's got to be me this evening amen Jesus would type the children of God to wheat and what makes wheat mature is this familiar brother Mark what makes wheat mature see you plant the wheat and they plant it in the in the early spring and then what happens is the rain and weed takes a lot of rain initially takes a lot of rain and brother Brandon would call it what a teaching rain he called the teaching ring we had an open word to teach us what was right and then what happens is what the Sun comes and then it rains and then the Sun and then the rain and the Sun and the rain and it needs that cycle to dry it out but to water it and keep it alive and keep it growing and give it all the nutrients but there comes a point where it's time to ripen and in the ripening time everything else of the wheat dies out the stock dies out the roots die out the leaves dry out the husk everything falls away and all that's left is what was inside that grain in the first place and it's sitting there and it's just got to ripen how in the sun no more rain no more rain we're not going to have any more opening of this word it's done there's no greater Revelation coming there's no eighth Prophet there's no eighth messenger there's no greater thing coming the bride has had her Revival in the teaching side and now it's time to do what machara's Sons and Daughters of God in the presence of Christ the word himself the person of him amen this is what the prophet of God will say he says the thing that's the matter with the message today not the Baptist not the Pentecostals not the lutherans not the no no no he says the thing that's wrong with the message today this is for us church is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened see you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making mature Christians see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christians for him to receive the wheat has got to get ripe how do you know when the weed is ripe when it looks exactly like what went into the ground when you plant that and the same thing comes out that it was that it brought forth in the first place the same thing that Christ was you are and you'll be planted and you'll bring forth the same thing that's how you know when you're right when you do what he does that's how you know and it can only come through what being in the presence of God the presence of God cannot just be a church experience we love it when there's this sweet presence here don't we brother Dale we love it when the anointing of God is here we love it when it's electric we love all of those things but if this is the only place we experience the presence of God I'm sorry there's a problem with our relationship with God it cannot only be here it cannot only be here it's got to be at home it's got to be in your devotions it's got to be when you're singing when you're driving your car it's got to be when you're listening to the messages it's got to be when you're speaking to God you've got to recognize his presence in your life otherwise you're not maturing it's got to be if there's one thing I can cry out tonight say is God real in your life personally not just in the church service amen church this is what what's he saying he's saying it's no longer just about having the word now is the time to be the word that's what a mature believer is that's what adopted son and daughter of God is is they are the word they don't just have the word we've had this word for so long we've had the opening of the word since 1963 60 years almost to the day 60 years almost to the day that the seals were opened we've had it a long time about time we matured I think amen he said in Noah's time a type of today Jesus referred to it and said as it was in Noah's Time Shows shall it be in the coming of the son of man in Noah's time so shall it be in the coming of the son of man notice there were all that anti-diluvian World perhaps of millions of people there were eight Overcomers eight people overcome that was real genuine Overcomers there was Noah's three sons and their wives and Noah and his wife eight overcome that entered the Ark at the appropriate time but how did they do it they listened to the word of God faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word real actions right actions follow the hearing of the word because it puts you into it puts your faith into action amen he says they listen to the word of God they weren't caught outside the door they were caught inside the door notice he uses the phrase cop because God they didn't open and close the door they built the door and then God closed it and they were caught on the inside because they had obeyed the word they didn't close it God caught them on the inside and he caught everybody else out God decided when that door closed he says oh my beloved friends don't let that door shut Jesus said as it was in that day so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now there's somebody going to get caught outside that door many of them might have had good intentions and say someday if such things happen we'll go in with brother Noah because he's a fine fellow but you see it caught just eight inside then think hard now if you're laying around getting Dodie get in hurry quick because the door might close at any time he says there's always been an ark in God's economy there was an ark in the days of Noah for the saving of his people there was an ark in the days of the law the Ark of testimony and the days of the law they followed the ark and there is a third dispensation now like Noah's time lot's time and now this time there is an ark now and that Ark is not a denomination neither is it a good works that you do but it's by one Spirit Romans 8 1 we are all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom one's spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by what Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome if that's the only way you overcome that means that's got to be the starting point for overcoming it's all that are under the shed blood that are Overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you you're resting what a contradiction of the way we think he says he overcome for you now you're resting in that amen Jesus told Nicodemus except the man be born again he cannot see he cannot understand the kingdom of God you've got to have the new birth and that means you've got to have the Holy Ghost to be an adopted son or daughter you've got to have the Holy Ghost to be an overcomer in this age that's it it cannot be a message religion that'll kill you just as much as Catholicism or any of these other ones will do it'll kill you just the same and that's blasphemy to some people but I say it again without the Holy Ghost you are lost I don't know any other way to say it without the Holy Ghost you are lost amen don't let the basics of coming to church and saying that we we believe God sent a prophet and he sent us an end time message keep us from the fact that we have to repent be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost to make it in a Rapture that is the absolute minimum requirement to go in a Rapture amen Church let's be Overcomers in our day-to-day lives by the Holy Spirit leading us and guiding us he says I was crossing an Old Log the other day down what is called a hollow and I jumped up on this log on the outside it looked good nothing wrong with looking good on the outside nothing wrong with looking like a Christian on the outside it said look like a big old beach log but when I jumped on it oh a great chunk of it fell off it was real rotten and Dody I said that's the way Christians are becoming looking good on the outside but rotten on the inside they've been dead and sin and trespasses so long till they become Doty they can hold no weight at all they don't know what overcoming means and I begin to think of this text then that overcome means keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition now listen to this he says see and it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was this will blow your mind what he says next he says you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him in the experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a church where such is going on living in a church where there's joy where there's peace where there's rest where there's the real life of Christ he says living in a church where that's going on he rottens twice as quick right living right under wow if you're out from under it it will cause you to rot rather than to live because what it's judgment it's judgment to refuse it as judgment he says so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour are we trying to follow the message of the hour he says or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the Life of Christ see because if you don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the Bible said he that knoweth to do good and doeth and not to him it's sin then you become Doty and rotten when you're separated from the life of God so he says so strive we're talking about the path the way of adoption how do I overcome he says so strived with all that's in you to do what to stay in the Life of Christ why that you would be fruit bearing now be careful he didn't say don't strive he didn't say strive to bear fruit he didn't say that he said strive to stay in the Life of Christ so that you'll bear fruit the striving is to stay in the presence of God not strive to bear fruit because you get it twisted around and you start trying to produce the right fruit and you'll fail every time because it's not you that bears it it's the holy spirit in you it's the life that's in you that's going to bear that fruit so you've got to stay connected to the vine you've got to stay connected to the main trunk there that's where the fruit is going to come from is the life that's connected to that so he says strive to stay connected to God how do brother Bradham said they said brother Bradham how do I how do I improve my relationship with God how do I get close to God he said two things read your Bible and pray and you know what most people won't do today read your Bible and pray because it's too simple it's too simple and it takes time and it takes dedication read your Bible and pray that'll keep you connected to Christ amen the battle is not to bear fruit the battle is to stay with the word of God to yield to the Holy Spirit to be in his presence on a daily basis amen the battle isn't fruit bearing the battle is to stay connected to life because Satan's trying to cut that off day in and day out trying to stay in the right atmosphere we have a long day at work we have a rough day with the kids at home trying to stay in the right atmosphere and you're looking for the fruits of the spirit it's hard it's a battle it's a struggle but don't worry because you're not bearing fruit worry because that means that you're not connected to the life that's where our battle is strive to be there he says this now we see these hours that we're in this stage and we see what it is we know where we're at church and the Holy Ghost is rebuking the age that put him out but he says in all of that did you notice to him that overcometh even in that worldly Wicked Church age him that overcometh what's he saying he's saying when you read the word of God and you see the age we're in and the condition that this world is in don't read it and say we can't come out of it he says read that there is an overcomer that's got to come through it and say I'm that Overcomer that's the part that's for me the parts that for me is not that they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing the part that's for me is that we have one we invited Christ into our home and he's sitting down and he's feeding us and what we have overcome that's the part he says focus on the fact that there is an overcomer that comes out of this mess this muck that we're in what is it ask God to work on the checklist of brother John's been preaching a storm on over the last few months that you're supposed to be this and you're supposed to do that that's not your checklist to do that's God's to do for you but you've got to let him in you've got to let him work on these things amen we think overcoming is all about us and there is a portion that is remember we read that quote where brother Brown says he can't push you through the pipe and then say you overcame he says you got to do something you got to do something but what do you have to do you have to fight to stay connected that's your fight is to stay connected it's not us that wins the battles against Satan it's not us that has has the great weapons that we make ourselves it's not us that has anything that can overcome but we stay connected to the overcomer the Holy Spirit and that's what's going to give us the victory in our lives amen the struggle is not to win the struggle is not to have Victory the struggle is to what let him work through us and do the work remember in Hebrews 4 11 I think it is he says that that would let us labor to enter into that rest let us labor to enter into the rest that is he has already overcome the world and I just have to get in him and I've automatically got every bit of overcoming that I need in my life first John says ye are of God Little Children You are of God what a statement you're of God you're not of of Lanny and Sandy curlette you're not of of Gus and Elise Colombo you're not of Joseph and Priscilla coffee you are of God little children and have overcome them why because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world brother Brian would say now how will I know then that I'm in there he says watch what kind of a life you're living just look around see if it's lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and policy then you're doing it but don't try to do it he says did you ever try I love this he says did you ever try he says yeah don't it's kind of a modern way of saying he says yeah don't try he says just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole you see he's just up and down and over and everything else see he can't do it put on your coat honey he can't do it little arm is up and down around it takes your Steady Hand he says oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to father and say Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put the code on me he says I quit trying just let him do it see if you're putting yourself under pressure you've got the wrong approach it's not you that's going to do it so don't put yourself under pressure to do it put yourself under pressure to get close to the one that's going to do it for you amen listen it's good to be focused we want to be seeking the scripture says seek and you'll find knock and it'll be open to you seek the things of God but don't think the things of God are going to be yours because you tried they're yours because he's going to provide and he's going to be the life that does it inside of you amen you've got to realize this is a work of God in your life not the work of you in your life that'll that'll give you rest that'll help you sleep at night when you say it ain't cause I did it it's because he did it for me and all I'm doing is I'm going to him in expectation seeking what he's already promised he says if the little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it ever tried to keep doing something in this word I have many times and sometimes you get six months before you did it again before you lost your temper before you looked at something before you did something whatever it might be but you always keep falling but you say Lord you do it that's when you'll see the results he says oh I can do it I can do it he's just everywhere he can't do it neither can you neither can I but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him here Lord here I am just let me be nothing I yield you put my hand in the right place he says that's the victory that's overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't you've got to let go of the control so he can put you where you want to be because what you want the coat on because he's told you to put the coat on but you can't put the code on because you're just a little kid compared to him so you gotta say Lord you want me to put the coat on I can't do it so you got to put the coat on Lord you want me to have peace that passes understanding Lord you want me to have joy you want me to have peace you want me to you know reduce my temper you want no no I can't do that Lord You're gonna have to do it for me I just don't know how to do it I can't do anything good in myself he says he says whatever you do who is listening now or who will listen Hereafter he says the hour is very late and you do have good intentions but be caught inside now don't struggle not him that willeth or him that runeth but God but God that showeth Mercy he says just like God just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised who is able to perform what God has promised I am able to perform no what God has promised he is able to perform God is the guarantor of his own promise I'm not God's guarantor he is so he says he is able to perform it not joining one denomination another denomination running this that or the other trying this just yield yourself to God and walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him listen to this he says that's what I told our brother that just had a breakdown see just yield to him he's here he who knew what you have done and what caused your being and doing this way and all that he knows all about you he knows all of our weaknesses church he knows all of our inclinations he knows all of our failures and now he's just told you back just what to do now I said the only thing you have to do is just go do it what God tells you to do go do it in simple obedience he says but what is it that he told him to do he didn't say go live and overcoming life he said forget all about the past walk live for the future in the glory and presence of God what's the principle what is the way of adoption just keep walking just keep trusting just keep moving forward Prophet God said when we're standing still we're backsliding footsteps is possession just keep going trust that he is able to do that he is able to perform in your life what he said was supposed to be there God never sets the requirement that he can't fulfill in you and in me he never does it he's not an unjust God in these things he says what do it walk live in the future in the glory and the presence of God catch us now you look back and you say I'm doing this and I'm doing that I've got issues brother John brother John's got issues I've got problems listen to this he says then no you're defeated don't look at what you're doing and say I'm defeated no he says but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he says then you realize that you've overcome when you're in Christ there is no condemnation he's not holding it against you it's under the blood and there's a power inside of you that's going to take you past it he says there's no condemnation he's not condemning you because it's under the blood but what he's doing is is he giving you something to overcome it in your life because you've got to be an overcomer and he's providing the path and the way for you he says and you know he's a devil you can't say I got a sickness and I don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it is a sickness you got cancer you don't believe it's a cancer it's a cancer he says but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture is written notice overcome that God that's in you is greater than the one that's in him the God of this world is not as great as the god of Heaven which is in you no more than Darkness can stand in the presence of light he says now Darkness cannot stand in the presence of light I don't care how dark it is light will put it out you go in a room that's completely sealed off no windows no gaps in the doors nothing and it is so dark that you can feel it and you all you have to do is light a tiny little match and darkness disappears he says it's the same thing with God in your life it's the same thing with the presence of the Holy Spirit you put that in the room where that darkness is and it will go and you let it come in more and more and more until what that room is filled with light and there's no more Darkness and then you just got to keep the holy spirit in there that's the light you're looking for amen he says it can't stand Glory but you take as much Darkness as you want to he says try bring the the darkest thing in your life the the worst habit the worst traits the worst past whatever it is and try and stand it against light one time and see what happens that's the one that's in you is light and the one that's in the world is Darkness so the light has proved to overcome the darkness and the man that's in Christ and knows that he's over the come the things of the world Amen it has no more ties to you at all you're free he says walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and we have Fellowship one with another there you are he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world now if you look back and you're condemned then you're still in the world but if you're living above that then he that's in you has led you above the darkness what's the way of adoption look to who is in you rather than what what is surrounding you declare him that's in you as the real and declare everything else as darkness that has to flee before that light amen denial of what we're facing doesn't make us an overcomer if I sit here and say I don't have a temper and I've got a temper that doesn't make me an overcomer that's not Faith that's not the word of faith that's not speaking the word I don't have a temper I don't have a temper he says you can't say you're not sick if you're sick but he says what focus on the fact that it has already been overcome the price has been paid and there's something inside of you and that's the very Life of Christ that is already overcome it and he says dwell on that say cancer you can't stay where the holy spirit is lust you can't say where the holy spirit is that lying spirit that cheating Spirit whatever it might be you can't say we're the holy spirit because Darkness and Light can't be in the same room together it is impossible the definition of darkness is absence of light absence of light darkness is only defined by light and where light is Darkness cannot be it can't be there he says you've got to realize the same thing what is he saying he's saying Lord saying Lord keep me close to the light keep me close to the light and that'll take care of every situation I have in my life every single one amen you want something practical let me give you an actual example an actual instruction that brother Branham had with a situation this is a question somebody said when someone gets on me or steps on my toes as the old saying is my temper Rises God forbid that somebody's temper rise when somebody steps on their toes listen to this how can I overcome this thing I know the Lord will have to do it but what can I do in my heart I don't want this thing sweeten your temper with prayer remember what we said read your Bible and pray don't just read your Bible you got to pray you got to talk to God about things he says sweeten your temper with prayer then make up your mind is this mind over matter no he says make up your mind what does he mean make up your mind that you truly don't want it and that you're expecting it to go away he says I don't guess he's going to talk about himself I don't guess there's too many people in this builder ever had any more of a temper than I did to begin with he says oh I had a mouth mashed all the time I took a lot of my meals out of a straw my mother as you know was a half Indian my father was an Irishman a Kentucky Irish at that both of them had enough temper to fight a buzz saw he says all the time my mouth was mashed it was beat up I was little to begin with and they just picked me up and knocked me down not as parents the kids at school and in his community he says I get up again they'd knock me down again until I was just got unable to get up anymore always and then when I got able to get up I got up again they knocked me down again that's just the way I had it I thought I can never be a Christian I can't be a Christian if I'm dealing with what I've got in my life now brother John listen to this he says but when the Holy Spirit came into my life that's done it he says no more what started the change prayer and a mind made up that he didn't want it in his life that's it that's what starts it but that's not what does it what did it was when the Holy Spirit came into his life and it removed that out of him you started with prayer you started with a desire you started with a confession you started by expressing your need and then you come to God and you say God I want to change I need a change I must have a change I'm desperate for a change and what does that do that loses the Holy Spirit to act on your confession of Faith by the word and that puts it into action and God will do it in your life like I talk about so many times about my mom and her makeup when she first came to the Lord she said I like my makeup and I know you don't want me to do it so you're gonna have to take it away and it took six months and then one day she realized she wasn't wearing makeup anymore but she had to say what she had to express her desire to be in line with the word of God that's the starting place the starting place is not to be perfect the starting place is to say God I want to be in alignment with your word and then say I need you to do the work and then it happens it's it just a simple honest confession of God of where you're at and where you need to be by his word that's what gets him moving another principle Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God he says well Lot's wife did the same thing you know she set out to go with lot follow her husband or children or loved ones but it wasn't in her heart she still loved the world he says so it's possible you can make a start and still be the world in you see she never overcome and even though she was well on the road it finally overthrowed her she had to take that one big long last look and that's where she got caught he says don't even look back how do I get adopted how do I overcome brother John Don't Look Back for anything don't have no desires can I put it this way don't feed your desires don't feed it put it out of your life they say that that to beat any any habit and they talk about drugs and pornography and all these different things it takes 14 weeks of nothing to overcome it you got to starve it you got to starve it so what I'm saying is don't feed it there are things in your life there are characteristics in our lives attitudes whatever it might be we can't defeat it just by depriving it it's still got to be a work of the Holy Spirit but don't give it any food don't give it any food he says keep going put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ she started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome she overcame enough to leave but not to make it all the way to the end he says oh she left the denomination she did she walked out of solemn with lot but she wanted to go back and have her hair cut you know what I mean see she had to go back she couldn't just couldn't stand the test she had to look back again to see what the rest of them were doing oh you know I had some good friends down there after all and after all this might be just a little move I don't know whether it could be right or not I've only got this man's word for it and though he's my husband but yet what she didn't trust her headship he says then if you're not perfectly satisfied you're not perfectly knowing that it's the word of God then you can't go see you got to be really sold out you've got to know not just say well I see others doing it I see a sign he's saying you don't enter this walk because you see it in somebody else that's a draw but you got to be convinced you got to be sold out you got to be committed to this process when you walk you can't you can't look back because scripture says you can't come and taste and then turn back otherwise you crucify him a second time once you go you go that doesn't mean we don't backslide Prophet God said I backslide a thousand times a day he did What About Us there's Grace to cover that that's what the blood's for but he says don't look back don't dwell on what's back there don't feed what's back there amen what is it you've got to look at this as it's this way or no way you know what makes a marriage work is when divorce isn't an option when you say I'm in it regardless when I'm in it based on what I vowed when we take those vows at the marriage Altar and we say till death do us part in sickness and in health and in Joy and Pain and all these different things we ought to mean it and so if we say there is no other way except this marriage guess what magically the marriage will work because you're committed to it you don't accept anything other than the marriage working and it's the same thing with your relationship with God if you say it's the word and nothing else the word will work but the minute you say it's the word plus this or the word plus that or sometimes it's the word or sometimes it's not the word that's never going to work that's an adulterous relationship and that's what brother Brandon Will Blast this age for is that we would add things to the word of God and we take things out he says stick with it be committed to it don't look back to anything once you're on the road then don't go looking backwards amen sometimes it's longing for what you used to have even as Believers I've moved around a lot I've had places I lived that were easier than here in some ways and harder than here in some ways but if Satan can get a hold of me he'll get me focused on what is not here that is maybe a little more difficult or a lot more difficult and he'll completely get my eyes off what God is doing in my life right here and right now and what will it do it'll distract me and it'll get me looking back and that gives him an opportunity to jump in and all of a sudden I'm dissatisfied and I'm depressed and I'm unhappy with the people around me and the problem is and the people around me the problem is me that's the problem it's exactly the problem amen I've got to be able to live where I am now and I don't just mean physically I mean where I am in the situation I am now in the place God's put me in to trust that he's got me here for a reason the scripture in First Peter it says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tribe with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ well the ram says this he says now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he that cometh to God must first be tested tested with the word that's God's test that only shows a true child then see being tested you can't overcome and then unless there's a test give to you and when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not we're talking about adoption and we're talking about the tests and the trials and the things that God puts us through he says you can't it's to see whether you can overcome or Not Jesus said to him that overcometh the test listen to this the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you said no student ever after going through exam week but when you get the diploma at the end it was a great thing it proved who you were he says I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold what's he saying he's saying we need to Value it not just endure it it's a mindset it's an attitude that he's talking about brother John how do I come to adoption do you have to understand what the trials are for and you have to Value the trials and that comes by understanding that comes by revelation of why God gives them to us in the first place listen we can't stop ourselves from feeling pain or hurt or these different things we go through that trials hurt tests exams we have sleepless nights and or lost sleep and and long days and your your brain is fried and guess what as a Believer it's no different we're beset on every side we're surrounded by a massive Army of 200 million demons that are trying to stop us from making it to the other side we're in a battle every single day and we've got to Value the battle rather than just endure it because we're going to come through it more as pure gold as as he would talk about amen we choose our attitude and we choose our atmosphere absolutely 100 that is a choice did you know we're the only creatures that can choose our attitude and our our atmosphere but you ever you ever see I think I've talked about this before and they let the little lion cubs in the zoo come out and uh and they attack the dad and if he's laying there sleeping and some kid comes and bites him on the rear end you know what he does he turns around with a big snarl and he swats him with the big paw why because he can't help it he can't help his attitude because he's a what he's an animal but we were different and we can what change our attitude based on simply a choice we can do that and what's he saying here he's saying what make a choice to Value the test he says it's testing time it's one good evidence of us that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God are tested and tried what's the principle understand and value that in order to be adopted you must first be tested the principle is to have the mindset that the testing of God is the proof of your heritage your purpose and that God has a plan for you in your life it's a completely different approach it's rather than a why me it's saying why me I know why because I'm a Child of God completely changes things but so often we stop and we're so caught up in the moment that we don't stop and say hold on a second there's a reason for this and that means God's doing something in my life as long as we've been staying with the word of God Amen it's God saying listen I've taught you Holy Spirit has taught you and now it's time to prove that you learned and if you if you can pass the test then you'll come into adoption you'll go on to the next level you'll go to to the to the next stage of your life and these different things but watch the requirement here James 4 10 says humble yourselves humble yourselves that means I do it for me and you do it for you it doesn't say I'm supposed to Humble Lydia says Lydia's supposed to Humble Lydia and John's supposed to Humble John humble your choice don't make God do it you do it willingly that's what we're looking for what in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up is that a mental thing absolutely it starts in your mind because listen you won't exhibit Pride unless you think you're proud up here unless you're proud up here it's not going to come out of your life and in Romans Paul would say this for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think that's a mental thing that means I've got something I can do and that's to keep myself down so that God doesn't have to do it for me he says think soberly in other words don't get caught up don't get puffed up but literally really sit back and check up as the prophet of God was saying really take uh inventory of where you're at in life and say hmm maybe I'm not quite as good as I thought I was maybe there's room for improvement maybe there's room for improvement he says but to think soberly according as God had dealt to every man The Measure of Faith he says Jesus gave us the example of how to do it now we want to know how to overcome who wants to know how to overcome humility girded himself took a towel washed the disciples feed and wiped them the very God Of Heaven humiliated himself we don't want to be humiliated you know what what happens when we don't want to be humiliated is we do something unintentionally that is humiliating because it's God humbling us he's saying humble yourself intentionally and it won't be nearly as bad as when you're truly humiliated you choose he says that's the reason women don't want to grow their hair out see the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should dress like men don't want to see it's the same thing they don't they get humiliated but Jesus constantly look who he was greatness he said greatness humiliates itself greatness humbles itself he said I have I've had the privilege of getting and meeting some great men and it's these guys that got a change of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket to Rattle that's the guy that thinks he's something when he's nothing but I stood by great man I mean great men with ragged sleeves and cuffs they make you think you're the great person see greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be I don't mean dirty now I mean humble in spirit but I'm talking about humility genuine humility not something that's a put on you see somebody that's trying to make themselves look good look out because in God's school that doesn't fly right bolster show-offs that does not fly in God's School he'll humble you very quickly remember the scripture talks about says when you come to a feast don't go sit at the top don't go sit in the in the premium seats go sit low he says and then you'll be honored if they call you higher but he says you'll be embarrassed if you think that you're the best and then somebody says sorry there's somebody here that's of a higher caliber than you you're going to have to move down he says start low and get let God raise you up don't start high and let God lower you down think soberly about where you're at amen listen God will take us higher than we could ever go if we let him do it his way his time on a sure Foundation it's way more stable to let him build us up rather than ourselves I've said this before praying for humility is like praying for patience you won't like the process I recommend not praying for it myself I just don't but we need it so whether we pray for it or not he's going to do it but like I said my prayer is not Lord Make Me humble my prayers Lord keep me humble I'm trying to think soberly that I've got at least a little bit of it and say Lord keep me at least there don't let it don't let it puff up on me just keep me humble Lord help me not to think more of myself than I ought to let me tell you you want to get humbled start serving sometime that'll humble you that's what he did he says Jesus constantly humiliated himself constantly humbled himself he said Jesus told us how to do it he overcome he said overcome means to stand the test that's why we're talking about the way of adoption stand the test that's right like the old Saints did like Jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was attested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated it how by surrendering himself why by the word said you destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days the word said so see and in the presence of death he defeated it he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes even in the presence of the Grave he overcome the grave why all by the word and humility oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example see he defeated everything he overcome it what's the principle he's saying he's saying take your cues from the word of God let the word put you into action not Pride not your big opinion of yourself but let the literal word of God let the Holy Spirit put you into action and do what the word says about you find your place in the word and then go and do that that's what Christ said Christ didn't walk around the the world and and doing all a bunch of things that he thought up on a whim just to prove he was the Christ what proved he was the Christ was he did what the word said he would do that's our principle to overcome that's our principle to be adopted is do what the Holy Spirit tells you to do do what the Holy Spirit quickens in the word to you that's how you're going to come to that place that that way you won't get drawn to the right and drawn to the left and got caught up in yourself and Ministries and gifts and all these things stay with what the word says about you we've had a message come to tell us what was most important for us listen we have the whole word we believe the whole word but there's things that we're supposed to be focused on and making a resurrection and the Rapture is one of them but overcoming is the thing that's going to take us there and that's going to come by focusing on what the word says about us and putting the rest of it aside not the rest of the word but putting everything else outside of that away from us we focus on those things we take our cues from what that end time messenger told us that was the spirit speaking to us scripture says the spirit says unto what the angel hear it hear it if you hear it do it stick with what he said because that's what's most important we can't go to Noah's age and know his message now we've got a message for this age and that's what we're focused on that's where we take our cues from that's why we needed a prophet was to take our cues from what he told us was most important because it was the Holy Spirit speaking to the church to the true bride he said overcome this is a very familiar quote overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people say there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe it there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him as real you must know he's a devil but then at the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is and that the one that's in you that's why you have to have the new birth is because the Holy Spirit has to be in you has already already in the past done deal he has already overcome him and by his grace you by his grace you so it's him in you that makes you more than a match for him amen that's real overcoming when you recognize when you recognize the battle has already been won and all that we're in is a period of time to prove it all right brother brother Jason Watkins was talking about this idea and he says God is not in time everything is just in the here and now so he doesn't get worried when something pops up or flares up or goes sideways why because he's in the moment there is no rush God can stretch a second out to a thousand years and he can compress a thousand years to a second it doesn't get God worried so when we're in the battle the battle is already won because God is just in the moment everything for God is the here and now he is the I am and when the I am is in you it takes you out of this time issue and you see in God's eyes in God's presence in God's plan this is a finished work and so as soon as we recognize that we don't have to worry about the Battle it doesn't mean it's not hard it doesn't mean we feel pain don't feel pain it doesn't mean we don't get under the gun because we're in a body that feels those things but in our heart and in our soul we know the battle is finished and the outcome is guaranteed because we have to be an overcomer when you recognize that he says you'll be an overcomer listen life isn't a picnic it's a battle it's a battle every single day it's a battle in our homes it's a battle outside our homes because if we're not outside then we're inside fighting the internal part of us it's Satan on the outside trying to get in but then you come into your home and you still have to deal with your own flesh with your own nature your own traits at times and whatnot so it's a battle constantly for these things but the devil is real and he's constantly trying to throw things up in front of us to see how we'll react uh there's a quote that that the prophet said he says what the devil does is he tries to get you to a place where you don't know what to do and so you do nothing but there's something you can always do you can always cry Abba Father and you can always go to the word for your cue and you start reading that like that thing with sister Burns where Satan talked to her for two hours and finally what he did was he hit bedrock and she said you talked to me for two hours and now I'm going to talk to you and she started testifying back to the devil and pretty soon he was gone sometimes all we need to do is testify it'll do us good Moses had a book of remembrance for the children of Israel sometimes we need to go back in our what I do in my devotion book and I have my prayer list in there is I have a list a book of remembrance of the things God has done for me for my family and for the people in this church and the people outside of it that I prayed for that many others are praying for as well go read that for a while when you're feeling depressed when you think that things aren't going well and nothing's moving start reading from your testimony Book for a while and it'll perk you up and you'll say greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world because he did it last time and he'll do it again if he did it for them he'll do it for me amen he said he showed us how it's done how did he do it by the word that's how he done it for he was the word and Jesus said if you abide in me and my words in you you're back to the word again the Word of Promise what is the Word of Promise to every Christian greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world then how do I overcome he says not me but the word that's in me catch what he's saying you overcome by what you are so if you are the word you'll overcome by the word but if you're intellectual you'll try and overcome by your intellectuality and guess what it won't work and if you're emotional you're trying and overcome by getting yourself worked up and by giving yourself a pep talk and that won't work either you've got to come to the word because the word is what has the overcoming power the life of the word is what's going to take us through on these things he says what the word is God he says then I overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me if you abide in me my words in you then just ask what you will just keep pressing up like The Lily you're coming up to the top as sure as anything see you've got to come to the top what does that mean Church it means we've got to be reading what the word says about us we've got to be reading what the word says about our day about the Overcomer for this day about the True Believer all of it and say that's for me and I'm going to keep pressing I'm going to keep believing I'm going to keep holding to that we've got to feed an overcoming spirit brother Brown would say the Holy Spirit feeds on one thing only one thing only the word of God if you're not feeding on the word of God personally and privately you're going to starve and you're not going to overcome you've got to have it in your life daily constantly amen the scripture says in Revelation it says they overcame what or how by the blood of the Lamb we read the quote earlier where he says they're all under the shed blood but they get overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony that means you've got a testimony and it's got to be word based and you got to be talking about it and you got to know it and you got to know that it's for you we ought to know our bibles inside and out up and down so that the first thing that comes to our mind in a situation is thus saith the Lord it is written it is written it is written and you can put the right Spirit behind it you can put the right attitude behind it you can cut through every situation and come to Clarity by simply saying it is written it is written it is written it is written amen that's overcoming revelation overcoming Revelation is when you can place yourself in the word and say that's for me not just for me that is me that is me and it becomes a part of you and that's what's going to overcome in our lives amen getting down to some brass taxes we start to close he says but seek ye first the kingdom of God he didn't say you can't seek anything else he says seek ye first but you know he never says seeks anything second because you don't need to seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all of these things shall be added to you everything you need will be added to you if you put God first that you have need of Paul said I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread never every need supplied we sing that song every needs supplied seek the kingdom of God first and he'll add everything else to you but Graham says just remember you're living for God you have one objective and that's Jesus Christ what is it we are his written epistle seen and right of all men that's our one objective there's that song do they see Jesus in me do they recognize his face do people see Christ in US he says outside of that there's nothing else counts that's him so first it's Christ then he says secondly for your family then thirdly for yourself but first for God next for your family next for you you're number three he says that's the end of the road put yourself last he did first John says love not the world nor the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him but I would say that this is the major sin of our days it's the major sin among our people worldliness as the Bible said the laodicea age was she's worldly Rich have need of nothing don't know that she's naked miserable wretched and blind that's the sin of our day when you hear the word of God call out against it then you take the other root he says you're unpopular with this world anybody been unpopular in what they believe lately they don't like it at work most of them they don't like it at work what we believe they don't like that testimony but some do there's some that are interested but most of them will say you're crazy you're this phobic you're that phobic you're this you know and they'll call you nut they'll call you crazy they'll call you uh hate mongering whatever it might be he says that's the sin of our day he says you take that other route with the word you're unpopular with the world you're tempted to go back I know prophet of God is saying this church this is 1963 after the seals you keep saying to me I know you're saying this is all the time I know you get tired of me harping on these things are you tired of Brother John harping on these things yet he says I get tired of seeing you do it too that's right this sin that I'm trying to tell you about say what are you harping on it for stop doing it then I'm trying to save your life by the word I get tired also so just straighten up this is a sin it shouldn't be done yes sir what is worldliness it could be anything that is outside the word of God anything that would get between you and your relationship with Christ is going to be of the world because if it comes through comes through the love of Christ then it means that the love of Christ can't be there something's gotten in there's a wedge that's been driven in amen I was talking to my wife about this last night and I pointed out that the prophet of God he'd go through and he preached some of the most amazing deep revelatory fantastic sermons and he'd tell us who we are and he'd tell us where the bride of Christ and he'd tell us what we're in for and all these good things and then you know what he'd finish with where are you at in your life every single time it seems like he'd bring it back to ladies what are you doing with your dress what are you doing with your hair Brothers what kind of music are you listening to are you still smoking your cigars are you still going to car parties are you doing this and that and the other he'd bring it down to where we lived because what he was saying you live where you truly believe you'd say elsewhere if you really believed it you'd live it and what was he saying he's saying you're sitting here and you're listening to the preaching of the word and you're nodding your head and you're saying yes okay I believe it I understand in all these things and then he'd say but where's your life at remember the quote we read earlier he says how do I know when I'm in it he says look at your life didn't say look at your revelation he said look at your life that's where the that's where the proof is because the fruit is how we're known by these things what was he saying and he'd say it he says you can't keep you can't preach you can't teach algebra to somebody that doesn't understand their ABCs can't do it he says if your life isn't where it needs to be then why am I going to go any further you can't go any further until your life catches up you can't walk in Supernatural for power for others if it's not first manifested in your life the first Victory God's looking for is right here in me not me for you me for me this is the first thing self has to die first self has to be conquered first in these things if we want signs and wonders surrender our life we want great Revelation and the mysteries of the word surrender our life we want tongues and Gifts operating surrender our life that's it all we are are vessels and all he's looking for is a clean willing vessel that he can use at any time in any way we don't earn it but we can sanctify Our Lives to be ready for it and that's a choice we make every single day amen like I said relationships not built twice a week at church it's not going to do it I want to finish with three tests brother Brown talks about and we don't all face these some of us face it because of the positions we're in or even our gender in many cases but God is allowing us to to deal with these Satan will bring them our way but God allows them and it's part of our adoption test to see what we're going to do remember you've got to recognize the test is a test otherwise you won't pass it you've got to recognize that the test is a test and it's there for a purpose and you're in the hot seat now and your answer is going to determine whether you move forward or whether you stay and go another round in that course he said the first thing that Satan did was he made his attack upon us his attack upon was to use his great power he's talked about Satan tempting Jesus which he knew he was the word he knew his position this is Christ you believe he did he says I the son of man he knew his position and Satan come and wanted him to use his own power on himself to feed him and to want to feed himself he was hungry a man gets hungry he can do almost anything he'll steal Rob beg borrow anything see he had that appetite and Satan uses used his first great major assault upon him to take his power that he had been given to overcome with and use it on himself maybe I could say it and use it for himself he said he didn't use it on himself no he used it on others that's right he used it on others not himself it wasn't for him though he could have done it he certainly could have done it but see how the devil gets the devil wants you to mind him but he minded only what the father said to do a minister is a servant and we're not talking just five full ministry but each and every one of us has a position in the body and we are ministering servants that's what we do so whether it's brother Josh up here song leading or brother Bob or sister Maureen and brother Joe and brother Dave brother Paul rather playing the the instruments or whether it's the gift of helps that we have here or trustees and deacons or the minister itself all of those things the idea is that this is not for them it's for those that are in the body of Christ so guess what I get a benefit from being a pastor I get a benefit from being in the presence of God I get a benefit from being used of God it's gratifying when it works when it's good it's gratifying it's not that I don't get a benefit but I can't be up here for that I can't be up here for its gratification to me I have to be up here for your sake otherwise it taints the ministry that's coming over and it'll get me proud and it'll take the humility right out of my life and that'll take the power of God completely out of my life when I do that our first benefit is always to others like I said the first victory that you'll see for an adopted son of God is over himself that's the first thing God does is he brings you to a place of full surrender how do you overcome brother Brown said living for others you're looking heaven in the face something along those lines eternal life is living for others you want to be adopted start living for others don't just live for yourself he said the next great assault that he made upon him was that he would be a show-off and how that does hit God's servants to be a show-off to show what you can do glory to God hallelujah I'm a deliverer I'm so he's talking like Moses see come up here on top of the temple and sit down here he tempted him to do it now repent remember he was tempted to do it hard said now if you'll want to be something before the people stand up here on this Temple and jump off fulfill the word see I'll give you a scripture for for it because it's written he give the Angels charge over thee lest any time you dash a foot against the stone he barely up what was his temptation you produce the word the word says this come on produce it come on produce it come on produce it Jesus never did it on command remember the Jews wanted to sign or the Greeks wanted to sign in these different things and they said do this and do that they tried to tell them what to do he said no I can only do what the father tells me to do that's what the True Believer is the holy spirit is our lead our guide and our unction and we do not perform like trained monkeys because somebody says I believe you're a Christian if you will they tell that to brother Branham go heal this one go do that and I'll heal it he wouldn't do it because that wasn't in the proof that's not the proof the proof is what he obeyed the spirit of God and God would back him up every single time as long as he was led that way and he had to learn that he had to learn that if you remember if you read read his life story he talks about he says I started using that and I started using it as a as a as a challenge to the people rather than following the leadership of God and the angel rebuked him and rebuked him and then finally he couldn't get an answer to prayer and he had to go back and realize what it was about he had to ask forgiveness for those things he says to make him a show-off to show his authority no true servant of God ever does that you see a man showing off his chest out and all like that just remember there is something wrong there if all we do is talk about ourselves we ain't a child of God scripture says in me dwelleth no good thing everything I have is by grace God don't want that Jesus set the example he could have done it he certainly could have done it but he didn't do it no servant of God is a show-off of himself to try to take God's power and show himself above somebody else no true servant ever tries to show himself off with God's power if he does he loses right then I was talking about this and I'll share this it's maybe personal but I was talking to a brother this week and I said you know when I when I came to the ministry and I started looking around and you start to see the gifts that are that are among the ministers and and whether it's the gift of how they deliver and the Dynamics of those sorts of things whether you see it's a gift of Visions or dreams or discernment or all of these things uh altar calls and Gifts of Faith and Healing and all that and I looked at so many of those things and I looked at that and I I wanted to be like them if you're going to be a minister you want to be like the best right but I had to come to a place where I said Lord I'm not them I had to come to a revelation I'm not them brother vaishal I'm not you and you're not me you can't be me and I can't be you and you can't take me a place and I can't take yours and you can't try and be like me because it won't work because you're you and I said to the Lord I said Lord I am what I am and I'm not what I'm not and so all I can do is be what I am so whether I have a stilted delivery whether I'm dry whether I'm funny whether I'm Dynamic whether I'm shouting whether I'm crying whether I'm just talking normally it doesn't matter Lord I'm gonna be what you've made me and you add to me as you want to and you take away as you want to you grow as you want to but all I can do is be who I am right now right here that's the only way it'll work because otherwise what I'm trying to show off I'm trying to put something on that doesn't belong to me it's like a a crow putting on the the feathers of a peacock oh it's so pretty yeah it looks so beautiful maybe but it doesn't work doesn't work you can't do anything with them you can't flare them the way a peacock does and all it does is keep them from flying and being a crow that's for me and that's for you we've got to be who we are we've got to be who God made us and when we stay there and we stop trying to be what everybody else is that's when we can come into adoption because now we're stepping into his plan his purpose his way his thoughts His image and we find our place and all of a sudden it just starts to work beautifully and we can relax because it becomes natural to us a crow can't naturally be a peacock and guess what I can't be brother Ron Spencer as much as I would like to be I can't be a Shelton preacher like Joe Adams I can't be that I can have a gift of discernment like some of these brothers at least not knowingly why because God hasn't given that to me yet maybe who knows but I've got to preach where I'm at and I said Lord I'll preach where I'm at and if you can use that then I'm all yours but I can't try and do a put on I can't do a put on that's not going to work what is it if we get to trying to prove ourselves by somebody else's metric we fail right then God's got our checklist God's got our image and we're supposed to grow into that and leave everyone else behind let them grow let God work with them he says Satan offered this is the third assault Satan offered to Forfeit this Kingdom to him Satan said see these kingdoms of the world they're mine I do with them whatever I want to I'll forfeit them to you but you remember he was trying to get him to Forfeit it without the cross if he did we'd be lost he could have took the kingdom listen to this he was tempted to take his Liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died Satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind me Satan he didn't do it he come and suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death are we this morning willing to do and take that same route that he took are we willing to die not physically necessarily but are we willing to die to our choice to our Liberty are we willing to give ourselves up to God and forfeit all the world and the things to serve him see though Jesus was tempted he overcome for us he endured all Temptations for me and for you see he could have took it right then but what did he take the other route for so that we could come and be with him and if he paid such a price as that then how little will we be not to take it when remember there's nothing here anyhow if you live a hundred years what are you going to come to mental your mind gone all crippled up and old and shaky that's where you're going and that's the end of it he says you come now overcome the thing how do you do it by the word what the word says you do it walk humble live before Jesus what's the principle here how do I come to adoption dismiss your personal Liberty Paul said use not your what use not Grace for an occasion to sin sin is not always well doing something that you're not supposed to do sin is often not doing what you're supposed to do to know to do it and not do it is Iniquity amen you've got a liberty that Liberty is your personal choice and you can choose to do what God wants you to do or you can choose not to and all that does is it makes you a hindrance if you choose not to doesn't change your sonship doesn't make you a not a daughter of God but it makes you a hindrance rather than a help in these things he says how do you do it stay with what the word says and guess what there's no parades for people that stay with what the word says down here they don't like us down here there's no Fanfare there's no trumpets there's no there's no you know big big news events for for those of us that follow the word of God except to dismiss us and make fun of us and no doubt put us down because they do it but he says if you'll choose that route you'll take your Liberty your choice and put it aside and say I'll take the way with the Lord's righteous View that's how you overcome you got to pick the Hard Road you have to pick the Hard Road that's how you overcome tell you what there is though there's a crown waiting for us and there's a place in his throne just for you and just for me if we overcome last two quotes he says as he caught them who looked for that so will he come to each New Testament Saint that's overcome every denominational critic who has ever overcome all the popular sins of this day of this age that we live in now like he did in all the other Church ages those who overcome in that church age those who overcome what I am rich I have need of nothing oh I'm all this and all this and I'm the bride what's he saying he's saying saying it doesn't make it saying on the bride there's lots of people saying we're the bride of Christ why because it's written in the scriptures he's saying they're saying I'm the bride I'm the bride what is it that's making them say it they're saying it because of what they have he says the true bride says it because of who they have it's a person it's not stuff it's not ideas it's not gifts it's the person of Christ that makes her the bride what is it she's saying I have someone not something and I have become that someone and that's what makes me the bride I'm this I have need of nothing and don't know that you are naked and blind see that deceiving age that I said it's not like them that had their heads cut off back Yonder to get the white stone not like those who died under martyrdoms and burnt with stakes and things like that who won the crown so he said back in those days it was easy easy to know because they died they died they had their heads chopped off Mothers had their children torn away they were fed to lions and all these different things it was easy to know who had the real deal he says no it's very deceptive in this age because everybody's saying I've got it I've got it he says but it's this deceiving age now that they that think that they're everything well I'm a church member I'm a good man I'm a good woman I do this I don't have to do this he says I do this their own thing but I don't have to do capital T this I don't have to do what the full word says but he that overcometh he that overcomes all those worldly things of this age what will they do all will sit with him in his throne and will go in the Rapture when he comes oh my what do I care then what should we care what the world says what should we care about what anybody else says the great holy spirit is Among Us his Pillar of Fire leads us and guides us his word is Vindicated before us his love is in our heart the world is in the back we pass from Death unto life the world thinks you're crazy amen God bless you let's stand amen hopefully that was a help you know we we can preach the higher things and we can preach the lofty things and we we preach about what's coming but there's a path to get us there and God has always provided a way God Is Not An unjust God If he if he has that requirement we said he gives us a way to get there amen and that's what I've just shown you tonight is the way to get there it's a way of humility it's a way of surrender it's a way of trust it's a way of a constant relationship with God it's a feeding on the word it's a prayer life it's a humbling yourself it's a crying out to God it's a seeking it's an expectation it's a confession it's a testimony all these things are what are going to get you to a place of adoption it's not just going to be any one of them they all work together they're all built on that concept of what hearing and believing and accepting the word of God and letting it come out of your life but it comes out in so many different ways and sometimes all that's missing is that one little piece sometimes we just need to Humble ourselves like he said there this is the age that think they're everything I believe I'm everything he said I am by faith but I also know I'm not there yet and that's what keeps me humble and that's what keeps us seeking and that's what keeps me praying and that's what keeps me working and that's what keeps me pushing and that's what keeps me fighting is I know there's more for me amen but he's going to get me there he's already promised there's an overcomer and I believe I'm an overcomer I believe you're an overcomer tonight but don't don't don't don't seek the lofty things and Miss just the Simplicity of what we talked about here tonight there's nothing here that you can make a decision to do Deliverance is not a view it's of him provision is not a view it's of him faith is not a view of it's of him but what you do have is you have a decision that's yours by free moral agency you have a decision and you have a mouth to speak and you've got a word to read and those three things will take you through if you'll do them the way he told you to use them it's that simple it's that simple you know brother Mark and I were talking about the the the the series brother Jason Watkins did on the token and after months and months of preaching and study he came back to one thing Acts 2 38 repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and if you get the Holy Ghost you're going in a rapture that's it you young people if you don't have the holy ghost seek the Holy Ghost that's what's going to make the difference baptism is great confessing your sins repenting that's wonderful that's what the word says but you now have to seek the Holy Ghost because that's what's going to give you overcoming power that's what's going to make the world have no effect that's what's going to take us adults into the workplace and into school and into these different things and we can walk in there and be untainted by the world and be a true Witness A True Light for this gospel amen but it's only by the new birth it's the only way it comes come to church we want you to be in the right atmosphere we want you to be in the right things but get the Holy Ghost that is the greatest thing that we've got to seek in all of this amen that's overcoming power is the Holy Ghost In You the very life of God Amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord help us not to complicate things Lord help us to just be simple Lord help us to just trust Lord to just walk in the things that you've shown us here tonight Lord we want the Deep things we want the high things we want the lofty things of of God in this word heavenly father but Lord we want boots on the ground overcoming power as well Lord for with all of that if we can't overcome in this life Lord then what is the purpose so Lord we're asking you to keep us humble Lord we're asking you to help us be faithful Lord help us to seek after the things that would or bring you tightly into our life Lord that will keep us Close to You Lord and help us to fight to push away those things that would separate us Lord grant us Grace to seek after you day in and day out Lord not just under the hearing of a Ministry of the word Lord but in our personal time and in our devotions Lord God Lord let us see how
