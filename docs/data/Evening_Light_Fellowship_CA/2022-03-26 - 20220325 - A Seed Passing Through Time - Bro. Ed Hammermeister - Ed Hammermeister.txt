gonna have to keep this thing close um when i heard this song uh this scripture came to me it's a song that's um it's a it's a scripture rather that's uh it's in second peter one and it's kind of in between all the the traits of the statue of a perfect man and then just below it is to make your calling and election sure and the scripture is second peter 1 9 and it says but he that lacks these things is blind and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins the song has called me we never forget i just got to say when i read the scripture every time i read the scripture you know like in psalms where it says is it sila or how are you saying you know it always stops me every time i every time i read it i always stop it just stops me all the time anyways call me we never forget [Music] the story's so familiar we've heard it all before some days it seems like nothing's sacred anymore [Music] despite the best intentions [Music] somewhere along the road we sometimes take for granted this truth that we know may we never forget the cross and the blood the price that was paid so that we might live may we never forget the cost of this love you'll never forsake [Music] so let us decide right here right now to refresh our memories of how it felt to be lost how it feels to be free may we never forget the cross and the blood the price that was paid so that we might live may we never forget the cost of this love you'll never forsake us you'll forgive me we never forget [Music] may we never forget the grace of our god [Music] if we ever forget the cross and the blood the price that was paid so that we might live may we never forget the cost of this love he'll never forsake us he'll always forgive may we never forget and so help us lord right here right now [Music] to [Music] to refresh lost [Music] may we never forget the cost of this love he'll never forsake us he'll always forgive may we never forget mercy rewrote my life [Music] mercy rewrote my [Music] mercy we [Music] my life [Music] mercy rerun may we never forget the grace [Music] forgive us lord forgive us if we ever forget [Music] [Applause] he'll never forsake us he'll always forgive may we never never ever forget [Music] our brother adam meister and his wife sister sandy amen and also our brother dale uh watchlighter so we say it right it's not it's not a normal newfinay not by any means but we pray the lord bless him amen and bless our brothers and sister emma meister amen for their during their ministry here so and also to thank everybody for coming and ask you to remember of course sister betty in prayer that she wasn't feeling well she wasn't able to come tonight and also to give greetings to the saints from brother ed cater he called maybe just before suppertime from grand falls and greetings to brother ed and we just keep our brother in prayer amen because of course there's uh issues out there when it comes to trying to get believers together and uh to maintain ministries and right now of course i don't think there's any pastor there right now uh not sure but uh and then there's only one church and there are very few in the church right now i understand so we pray the grace of god to the saints in central and western newfoundland amen and we know of course that there's a number of believers out there across the island that do support here so god's god's grace to us all that we'll stay with the word please in the name of jesus stay with the message please and and that we'll stay with the faith that's been given being given to us and brother all that god has done all that god's doing and will do is to keep our our our thoughts focused on the end to keep our thoughts focus on the resurrection focus on the rapture because that's brother that's what god's got got in store for us right now what what else is god going to do are god going to do this god no no no for the elect for the seed of god for the bride of christ it's resurrection it's rapture after all these years brothers they've been pointing to it pointing to it amen we've we referred back to it for 2 000 years concerning what jesus did praise the lord brother sister now in the revelation of christ in this hour is to show you what he's doing amen what he did he laid down his life picked it up again resurrection he was raptured amen and he come back to give the faith that faith to the bride of christ amen praise the lord encourage you for 2000 years encouraging us to look up and especially when you see this to see this see this look up because your redemption draweth nigh amen praise the lord oh i pray oh i pray that it's real to us oh yeah that is that that that is more real to us than what the world is witnessing out there what's going on out in the world and the foolishness they're dealing with brother we gotta we gotta hope they don't have a hope but we got one amen oh yeah they're worried about this worried about that this is happening this is going on well forget it amen it's a sign of the end amen well what about us look up that's right what god's gonna do he's done it the resurrection the rapture amen and in this hour sending the message they sent to give us or to give us faith amen resurrection and rapturing faith oh if there's anything we should have faith for is the resurrection and the rapture amen because all dogs from the angels they believe they believe this and god gave them this and they believed god gave them that they believed it so now in this hour he's given us the revelation of the rapture and the resurrection so are we believing what god has given us and what god is doing as they did in previous ages as luther did wesley did as the pentecostals did amen praise the lord brother pentecost believed that oh yeah what god was doing was going to take that they would lead everything on to the resurrection rapture not knowing that there would come a messenger with a message amen praise the lord they didn't recognize the messenger they didn't recognize the message amen but god has got a bride to hear the message to hear the messenger amen and it's predestinated it's ordained to give us resurrection and rapturing faith hallelujah what jesus did mrs jesus is going to do amen he laid down his life picked it up again amen and now the bride she's moving on to the resurrection hallelujah so god be with us and god help us and just to say i welcome our our brother and sisters amen from uh alberta so god god bless them and uh of course again when it comes to alberta that's uh to me that's a part newfoundland you know because there's so many new flanders there so i and so we pray thank the lord for bringing back our our brother and sister emma meister amen and our brother here tonight amen and any other visitors god bless us amen i'm going to turn it over to our brother jonathan and he's going to introduce our brother hammermeister amen and he's a hammer meister he's a minister and he can hammer so he's he's got that liberty he's got that freedom to hammer us tonight amen by the grace of god amen so we pray the lord bring him bring him forth reflecting his true nature in his name amen so god bless us i'm going to turn to brother jonathan amen be in prayer for the ministry amen and then we're at the end time it should be light touches on the image by this point amen we shouldn't have to have any big things knocked off so if we do god will do it tonight amen we're gonna invite brother ed to come out this evening just want to of course welcome each one here brother ed is a pastor in in alberta he's got many decades of experience he's got a a wide-ranging gift he may be evangelical tonight he may be pastoral he may be teaching but one thing i know and i've seen it in action is that god will meet your need if you'll believe amen so let's just stand together if we would and uh when my brother had to come out and you pull on the gift he's got a sermon he's got an idea he's got a an inspiration that he has but we know that the holy spirit can take him right to your chair right to your seat tonight and just touch your life in the way that you need it so let's sing that song fill my cup lord i lift it up as we invite him to come minister tonight amen i told him brother gerald always has told me when i visited have your liberty so i told him i said we've been preached at for a long time we've had short sermons do whatever you would have to be inspired tonight take your liberty and just and just be comfortable behind the pulpit so we want to make the holy spirit welcome and if he's welcome then the minister will be welcome as well amen so let's sing it and lift our needs to him this evening [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] here's [Applause] [Music] let's sing it again [Music] is [Music] fill it up and make me we had a brother at our church just spoke a service and it was such a good in india indication of that song but he said that the size of your cup is he'll fill whatever size you bring and he illustrated a little cup a medium-sized cup and a big cup so whatever cup you bring he'll fill it god bless you you may have your seats for just for a moment if you musicians just just hang hang tough for a minute i might i might need it just give me a minute or two i just want to say it's good to be here and uh it's uh been many years i think it's uh 1986 so by my calculations about 30 30 35 almost 36 years and i want to greet brother gerald and i'm sorry your wife isn't here but brother harold hildebrand is our senior pastor at our church and he wanted to greet you brother gerald and he also want to greet the church and the assembly so we want to thank god for him he's 80 he'll be 80 next about a week and a half from now and we're having a celebration for him next weekend and he's been in decline he's had parkinson's for 12 years and he's been limited by that along with his age so he hasn't ministered for a number of years but we're thankful for the grace that he's given to to pass on i i was one of those that was with him in his original house meetings and i i joke i was a 12 year old kid i wasn't saved and i looked for the corner of the room in the living room that i could lean my head against the wall during the service so i said i wasn't a lot of inspiration to him back then but thank god that god got a hold of me and and uh and when we do that so we we do thank god for you brother gerald for men like brother harold for those pioneers that have labored and brought us to where we are we didn't get where we were on our own but it took rugged men and so we're thankful for that i'm also thankful for my my good friend brother jonathan curlette and his family they've been a blessing to me and i only wish i could have been at my age where jonathan is right now because i'd be a lot further ahead right now but uh he's he's um he's very knowledgeable he's sharp he's quick and he's also gone through a few knocks and it's developed some maturity but we appreciate his family it's been uh the only place i'm not envious of is is uh the four kids that he's got so um we've been through that stage but we woke up and and there's a little pitter-patter of feet running back and forth and and no it wasn't uh sister selena it was the boys so just to clarify that anyway yesterday we we met up with brother bob and sister brenda it was nice to be together and uh and many people know brother berry coffee but i always turned that on brother berry coffee and i said brother barry aren't you the brother of bob and mark [Laughter] they all they'll go the other way so anyway it was uh it was good to be with them and then to see brother mark and sister maureen i mean i don't know if you remember i had a tough time remembering you you both had darker hair back then and i was a little a little lighter back then a little skinnier too but you know i like to think all these people are changing and i just stay the same right in my eyes it's that way but i had come here some 35 years ago on a red-eye flight it was a tuesday and i arrived here early in the morning took a cab with three other locals and i realized this is not a part of canada i've ever heard like this before as they started talking and and um i walked around town for the day and then in the evening when my brother mark got off work we went over there and we went directly to church that night so i had a tough time staying with it after all of that but uh any rate it was it was a blessing and and we had some wonderful time and and one of the greatest things i took with me from that trip was um a little cassette tape that sister maureen had made i think brother mark you were playing the guitar and sister marine was just playing and i think i wore that thing out that was a blessing that that soothed my soul many a time and and just listening to you play again that was just a blessing and so it's good to see you again and as i said i maybe you've changed a little maybe i've changed a little bit too and and uh put on a few extra pounds i the beginning of the year i had a you know i had lost some weight and then i gained a little bit back and so i determined i'm gonna lose 20 pounds this year and somebody asked me other day how are you doing with that i said really good i've only got 25 more to go so any rate that's that's just the way it is it's part of the blame for that goes to my wife she's i i can't say she's the best cook east of the rockies because newfoundland is here so i'd put it overshadow some of you but she sure surely is on the prairies and she's been a blessing to me and we have three children i have a daughter anna she's 26 and two boys at home caleb and ethan 23 and 19. so pray for us those two boys at home have really been very judged but they love the lord and they're serving god and we're thankful so many greetings to all of you i mentioned brother harold but also brother alan dole and sister shelly they wanted to greet you all and we also have a young man who was in our church from kenya he had made a stop over here brother bernard and he wanted to make sure greet them all and and he he you must have had a memorable impression he said brother ed remember one thing winter doesn't start or winter doesn't stop till the end of may in newfoundland i said okay we'll we'll do that but he said that and then also brother jim dooley i was just talking to him the other day and i told him hey i'm going to newfoundland so he said oh make sure you greet the people and if you know that but when i was a young man as the age of 20 at just 23 and i was in 1983 84 when god was dealing with me but brother jim dooley was the one that baptized me so there's a lot of connections to newfoundland so any rate and then i don't know where's where's brother joe is he here somewhere am i there he is oh my brother joe uh we we co-emceed a wedding together and we actually i can't say we co-emceed i i laid the platform for him is what i did so and then he's he's a hard act to follow and and and so i'm glad he came after me because it just is that but good to see you again brother joe and many many years so we've had we've had all of this but we also have our good friend brother dale i have a greatest respect for brother dale as a single father he raised two wonderful girls i think he's going to have a great testimony in heaven and his girls one is a wife of a deacon one's the wife of a one of our song leaders and but uh he's a blessing too about to us and he's kind of had his eyes on newfoundland so i say bro hey brother dale why don't you just come along don't don't look at the pamphlets come and see you know when when when the when the voice came and said come and see so that's we said come and see so he's he's here i'm glad you're here for the dale god bless you i'm glad the lord gave us a wonderful day well we could visit a little bit i just wanted to say hello and and greet you all and and just do that why don't we just stand together let's just maybe sing another chorus if we can i i saw it on your list but um god still moves do you do that here god still moves now i'm not a singer that'll become very apparent very quickly so some of you raise your voices a little bit and you'll help me along but i believe god still moves we're we're living as much as we identify with the natural we're living in a tremendous time so we want we want god to move in our midst and not just on our flesh realm and our spirit realm but but in a deep deep way we want him to move let's sing this god still moves god still moves [Music] us [Music] let's sing it again [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as he just keep playing softly let's just bow our heads one more time heavenly father now as we just stop and place our attention our focus upon you lord you're the one who's in our midst lord one thing we see more and more as the days go on it's not about us it's not about what we can do but lord it's what you can do through us and lord we desire one thing we want to see jesus lord when all these meetings are said and done lord greater than the remembrance of brother ed or those that are visiting may it be said that jesus came by our way lord so father now i give my vessel to you i ask also for all of these that is we just surrender ourselves we we desire that your spirit would have free course lord would you come we invite you now bless us as we open your word as we begin to go into it may you move into the speaker into the hearer lord may it bring forth life in us may we begin to see more clearly who we are may we see our place in this world lord father we pray from the youngest to the oldest that you would minister to us father we commit ourselves to you now and we invite you ask your blessing in jesus name amen amen amen if you can turn to your bibles thank you to the musicians i sure enjoyed the singing back in the office there and uh that was a blessing and and so we we thank god for that colossians chapter 1 colossians chapter 1 we we often use the phrase we should all be familiar with this scripture in the bible this every scripture we'd be familiar with so the other day i opened to the book of philemon i said we should all be familiar with this and people kind of looked at me and said yeah well it's part of the bible too but there's certain scriptures we refer to more this is one of them colossians 1 verse 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body and the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and i'll just invite you to go back to first corinthians first corinthians chapter 15. and i'll just take two verses there verse 27 for he hath put all things under his feet and when he has said all things are put under him it is manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all god bless his word you may have your seats i'm going to um i have to be myself wherever i go i i don't i'm at home and i sometimes have been comfortable preaching at home lately what you don't pick up in one service you go to the next when you come somewhere then there's all of these thoughts that come to you and you try to condense them and i don't think i always do a good job but you know i'm not i'm not going to be the fiery evangelist i'm not going to be the stoic teacher i'm not going to try to be a missionary even though i told people i was going overseas i i'm not going to do that and so i i and i'm not going to try and be the pastor you've got pastor here and and brothers that do that so i'm just going to try to add to it and and uh we had a brother at home and they they referred to him as the helicopter preacher like he just got in open the scripture and just started blasting and and then they they referred to me as the 747 preacher because they said i needed a bit of a runway to to get going so i'll i'll get to where i want to get to slowly but we will do it i as a subject or a theme maybe this this weekend i want to speak on the all in all but for tonight i'd like to just take a subject of a seed passing through time and i'm going to just address a little bit on our natural man and then our spirit man and and that that refers to it but and a lot of this is on our outlook or our vision on what we see and how the the book that we believe is opened it's not necessarily a book somewhere in a certain place that's open but it's open to our eyes and we are walking in the unfolding of it and we're seeing more clearly than we've ever seen before so we are living in a tremendous hour and those of us who have been in the path for a long time we're we're seeing the unfolding of the events and it seems that there's a quickening and they're happening faster and faster and it seems that that as as they're happening and i'll refer to worldwide events around us but as they're happening it just seems like the dominoes are beginning to fall and what looked like quotations that we looked like and they looked like they were a long ways off all of a sudden they're at our doorstep they're they're here they're not not way way off so we're seeing things that that maybe we heard with our natural ears things which we believe yeah and but yet we couldn't understand how but we just stayed with them but now we're seeing them clearly and unfolding and more manifest in a greater manifestation and and i i use it this way and i i just shared this actually a church at home last week but in 19 uh i the lord did called me in 1983 and i think it was in 1989 i i took a trip to europe and i was still a single man at that time and and i as i traveled to europe and it was prior to the the uh fall of east germany and so as as i was there and and i was there in may of 1989 i i traveled and i actually went from west germany to east germany and as i'm i'm crossing i remember all of these visions that we had okay that's the iron curtain and and germany was part of that iron curtain and you're you're cultured into believing it so you know i remember i had to get my visa right i'm gonna go see people over there and i made sure my visa was right it wasn't easy to get a visa at that time and i remember in the middle of the train and and and russian soldiers just woke us up in the middle of the night i'm in the train and they demanded to see it they're not kind and you know so they intimidate you and there's all this thing and i'm crossing this line and that's a part that i could see and feel i'd been inbred into me to see it and as i crossed the line i went across this place they called checkpoint charlie and i went across to see believers and and it was you know what what i saw in may but by november of that year there began to be the fall of the eastern bloc hungary allowed russian immigrants into it they kind of went to europe and and in november i woke up one morning to hear that the berlin wall was coming down and that was amazing to me because i just remember how it was but there was this little thing in the message of the hour that we have and and and and i'll refer to it and it's in the message the end times see sign seed or end time seed sign and it's right after brother branham speaks spoken word is the original seed and he goes right into this and he said there's been a national teaching reign and then there's been a communism sold amongst the people there's been a roman revival and he drops these words and he said do you know if they ever give back the eastern part of berlin that means that puts the roman empire exactly like it was on the old circle of jesus so the world was conditioned to thinking this is a good thing communism is breaking down but a prophet with eyesight can see and he says no this is actually opening the doors for romanism to take a greater foothold and all of a sudden that became like like if you had been feeding on the message that became like something that you know be just began to alarm you and it began to open you but your conditioned by what you feed on and as you're feeding down the message and different things happen you know we can we can hear events in israel and and we can see current events in russia and we can hear about an earthquake in in in los angeles and different things and immediately gets our attention because we're conditioned to look and see for different things than the world's looking at and when we see the the the control of governments and and we begin to see because we really believe you know and i'm i'm i'm just gonna allow the lord to just just take it the way he wants but you know as we begin to see because we know we're living in the manifestation of the pale horse rider and it's the coming together of three powers it's the coming together of demon powers it's the coming together of political powers it it's the coming together of religious powers and we see even political powers in the last two years how every nation whether they were of an eastern bloc and whether they were aligned with china or russia all were put into the same boat because of covet and and it and it and it forced the whole world into a unified state and then we see it and then again it goes further and now you see all of these things happening and it's it's not the pale horse ride yet but it's the coming together of all these powers and here we are in the middle of things watching them unfold so it's it's a tremendous hour to be living in and i'm i'm not going to dwell on on the whole world view of things because we can easily get caught up in that but there's another part that's unfolding and it's happening amongst us because while that's happening god's got his eye on a people god's got his eye on a people the wheel in the middle of the wheel that which ezekiel saw you know here's the big wheel that's turning but in the middle of it there's a little hub a little wheel in the middle that's where god's eye is and just like it was in the time of jesus and as this quotation i read where it was at the time of jesus the roman empire just like it was in that time here had to be a king named herod here had to be a ruler named pilate here had to come a taxation that forced the whole world and yet it was right in the plan of god it was working right into the way that god had said so here is god's god sees all those things and i don't think joseph and mary were very happy that they had to go all the way to jerusalem right at the time when she was expecting but it would had to be the fulfillment of scripture and that's exactly where we are and we're living in a time of the fulfillment of scripture and we all of these things have to be so so we we see these things unfolding this way now i'm going to just just read i want you just to go with me to this for a moment second second corinthians chapter six and uh the this is really a paradigm or a paradox of of uh where the believer is at and i i want to read this because sometimes we can make these statements way out there and say well how does that affect me when i go to work tomorrow how does that affect me when i got to go to school and raise children and do things so i don't want to make it just the way out there but everything's working together so let's just read second corinthians chapter 6 verse 4. now paul is really talking about the ministry but i think this is applicable to all of us he says in verse 4 but in all things approving ourselves as ministers of god and and you minister in your home you do many things in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labor in labors in watchings in fasting so if i just stop there you go wow brother ed that's not very encouraging wow thanks a lot thanks for coming you know and so you know but it's a reality it's where we live right so and then he says in verse 6 by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeign so in the middle of these conditions this is expected yet it's not expected of ourselves it's going to be god that brings that out and then we could take it how you know a diamond is formed in the blackness of coal with pressure and with all of these things and you get what's called a diamond out of that but here we are in our in our humanity i i don't know about you but i i if i know it's island life and it's a little slower but i'll tell you what i've watched people literally you don't know what's cooking inside of them under the pressure of this age they'll be just fine and then they'll just go off just on one little thing will will get them off that's the pressure of the age we're living in and so in the middle of that you've got to have a place to let off the pressure so it's got to be by god so here he says in verse 7 by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things now i could stop at every one of these but i'm just laying a groundwork a little bit for where we're at so as we look in the world and and the influences that are around us and and i love the way that the prophet would sometimes make things so so real in the way he would discuss it this is in a message the guide or a guide in 1962 he makes the statement this way they see the hour is closing in a fog is coming over the earth great creeds and things are uniting together churches are confederating coming together and then he uh miss a a sentence or two and all things that they're threatening it's not new to us the gate great guide has showed us that in the path of the word and he makes this statement we're just passing through that part of it now so the important thing is not to see ourselves i i was as i made mention i came out in 1983 and when i came out the call of god to me it was like i i i'd grown up in a message home it was a broken home my mom believed one thing my dad another i i'd come out of all of these things but when god began to deal with me and as a young man and and and i began it was like it became i couldn't understand it but it was like there wasn't much time left this this was the call this was my moment this was my time and and god knows he has a time for every one of us you know i i thought well god had to call me back then because i'm slow and i can't you know it takes me a long time to get going and i thought well you know what god probably had to call the snail into the ark earlier than he had to call the gazelle and i thought so i'm the snail but once i heard the call i had to go once the gazelle heard it they had to go so whatever way whatever time season you've been called we're all going to make it just in time so that's why i said brother jonathan god bless you i wish i had what you had at your age when i was there but you know what i'm here and it's part of the age as part of the quickening it's part of where we're at so and when i came in my view was oh thank god i'm saved and yet really what i wasn't seeing the reality was that somewhere in the book somewhere in the mind of god my name was written and nothing could happen until my name came there i couldn't see that part then and all i could see is how am i ever lucky i'm out of this and and you know i i grew up in the era of of you know i don't want you to look at the pictures of when i was out in the world and i was young because you you'd look at it and think wow you came out of that era brotherhood yes i came out of that era plaid suits and then and i wouldn't want to show you the things i wore in my casual attire because that would even be worse but i just say man i came out of that and that was the culture that was all i knew but if i look at it now here i am all these years that's faded that's nothing the part that i always really was was never there that was just what i came into but when god called that seed that there had to be something quick and there had to be something arise and and and and i i always grew up as a young child and i thought oh man why did i was i born in this family they go to church you know and it's twice on sunday and it's on wednesday that's what happens to the unregenerate mind and i think why was i in this family now i look back and say oh god thank you that i was born in this family thank you for for for you know as a teenager you know teenagers they you know when kids kids are like seven eight nine they love to be with mom and dad when they're like like uh you know start 12 13 and they're out driving in their friends and then they duck in the back seat and there's this you know i don't know oh my friends are gone yeah so it changes that's to the unregenerate but thank god like i was born in this family and and and i remember my friends used to ask me oh you your family does that no that's kind of strange and you grow up through these complexes but you you look at how god calls and wherever you're at and i'm i'm going to use a little bit of identification here um let's just go to hebrews chapter 11. i could use different ones i could use abraham i could use i'm going to use moses here for just a little bit hebrews chapter 11. and so this is this is dealing with with moses but you know it's like abraham i i we had a a brother that passed away and uh and uh and i remarked on his life because he may not have walked in the fullness of the unfolding in this last age but somewhere in his life god dealt with him and i said think about abraham he lived 175 years the first 75 years was nothing to write home about there was nothing no inkling that there was a seed of god there much less the father of the faith then at age 75 he calls him and abraham starts a walk abraham has no idea what's in front of him god knew what was in abraham but he also wanted abraham to know what was in him and that's why he allowed them to go through all the schooling and everything that he did so from from the age of 75 to 99 until the time of the fulfillment of the promise then there's a little interval where isaac comes into play and abraham's still there in the death of sarah and and abraham then marries katira and and that was it at the age of i think 137 you don't hear much of abraham now until 175. so in that little span god saw this little piece of time out of abraham's whole life and he said that's what matters that's the part i'm going to focus on and if we can recognize there's a part of our lives that's written the same as it was with abraham and you're walking through time just the same way and if you could recognize you were born for this time you were born for this hour you were born to live at this time and express god to this generation somebody's got to declare him somewhere there's got to be a young person that's going to be raised up for a testimony and raised up and say this is a young person that stood in a school system this is a young child that was obedient to his parents this is this is a mother in her in her home in her environment and and everywhere god's gonna have a witness he's never left the world without a witness so let's let's just look at abre let's look at moses for a moment exit or sorry hebrews 11 23 by faith moses when he was born he was hid three months of his parents now by faith moses when he was born his parents hid him by faith because they saw he was a proper child and this next verse and they were not afraid of the king's commandment so by faith they they knew the the law was to kill all the children under the age of two but they were not afraid and and furthermore they defied the king and by faith they they threw him out on the river and and yet you know it's one of the greatest story god always pulls the wool over the devil's eyes you know here's the god the devil anoints pharaoh just kill all the babies in the meantime there's a little ark that goes out lands right in pharaoh's backyard and and you know talk about the greatest government funding program ever there was he raises up moses in his own court he says i'm going to train him up i'm going to give him all all that we can't just to protect them all these years and and and and just pull the wool over their eyes now that wasn't enough that was his parents acting it was god's plan but now in verse 24 here it says by faith moses when he was come to year so the first 40 years of moses life was was something but now he comes to years you could take this phrase and you can go into the book of genesis where god comes and visits abraham and and it's elohim in in genesis chapter 2 in chapters 18 and he says i will return to you according to the time of life there was a life cycle that abraham had and it wasn't just the cyclical nature of the human human anatomy and sarah and all of that things but it was according to god season now all that i've invested is going to come to fruition there's there's something i've got there's a seed i've planted in the earth there's an abraham i i've i've not worked under the adam covenant i'm working under under the the grace covenant and i'm going to take a man that's a heathen and i'm going to pick him and it's my righteousness that's going to pick him and it's he's going to receive my righteousness and when those two come together it will produce exactly what i wanted to produce and even when he in his own nature and his own in his own natural being he makes mistakes and he stumbles and he falls you know i love i love the vision of the bible that it gives the old testament there's no no book like it it tells all the the faults you see all the faults of abraham you see all of those things but then paul looking now through the atonement looking through the eyes of god in the old testament he sees abraham and he says there was no fault in him he was perfect god looking and seeing him so it was god they what man sees but what god sees is a different thing so we want to be found under that so here he is now he says and and and and uh brother bannerman says in the message why christ speak i think it's wonderful i'm going to touch on this later in the week but he says now in our own way of looking it seems very hard but the all-wise god knows what he's doing he knows how to do things how to deal with man he knows what's in man he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side but he knows what's really in man amen as i think on my life and i remember different steps i used to take and i was a i was out i had a friend of mine a very close friend of mine and and you know the years that i was running in the world we'd gone out to a nightclub and we wouldn't stay and drink because it was too costly we go out to the car and drink in the car and it was we're sitting out there we're looking in the darkness and and he says to me one night he was an orthodox catholic and he says ed do you ever wonder what's out there so what do you mean out where it's just like out there i said dark out there he says no no like beyond that like you ever think there's a being somewhere and i'm going why now you know because and and he's he's going yeah like and in his own world he says you know do you ever think about the pope like do you think he ever hears a voice i'm sure he does hear a voice i don't know which one but you know i'm just and i'm there and i'm just being convicted i'm getting agitated why are you spoiling my good time and and and he's like he's he's going on this path and i'm going just have another drink you know and and i so here it is now seven years later this was my best friend he wants me to be the best man at his wedding god has spoke to me i've separated from all my friends i couldn't figure it out i couldn't understand it and he invites me to the best man and i said and i'm trying to explain to him i said do you remember that night you know when you spoke about this and this and this i knew exactly what you were talking about he said i don't remember that it wasn't for him it was for me it was the grace of god extended to me and i knew it was there all the time it wasn't that i was i suddenly became seed how do we become a son of god is it is it do we come we become seed no because we were seed therefore we can be reborn again it's always there it's always been in us but we're just a seed passing through time and now i look back and i see it i thought oh thank god that was there and then you could look at other things you all could have similar testimonies i remember here i was a young man and i'm wanting to do the right thing before god i i'm i'm going to go buy this car and you know i to start to pay ties to start to do things and and and you know it wasn't easy but i knew this is god's word i'm going to subject myself to it i remember going to buy a car and i thought i looked at the car and i prayed about it and i said i believe this is what it just felt right it felt like this is my car so i just prayed and i said lord if this is really the car let let me buy it for so much okay i went in there and i i wasn't uh you know some of you might be sharper in this kind of stuff but i wasn't i really should have come in with a lowball offer but i came in right with the amount i prayed and i said let me have the car for this he said well we'll talk to our manager you know the usual sales thing we'll let you have it for uh 300 more i said no it has to be for this price and then he went back out of the room they called the manager and says listen we will give it to you for a hundred dollars more than than what you're asking for and i could see it i knew it was it felt right it was my car and just in that moment i just thought okay it's mine i'll do it and then my heart got condemned and i was supposed to go and just arrange the little bit of financing i had to do and and i i went back and i just prayed i couldn't pray i couldn't do it right i couldn't and finally after three days i went back in there i went to the sales guy and i said listen i made a mistake and i if i lose the car i lose the car but what was more important to me was the peace of god in my heart and i said if i lose the car i lose the car and the guy goes i mean i said i'm a christian i made a mistake and the guy's like roland's oh my goodness i've heard them all now you know just and he goes i'll get the manager the manager comes out and he goes what he stomps out of the room and he comes back in and he brings the bible down and flops on the desk if you're a christian you've got to keep your word i said that's the problem i didn't he said well christian doesn't renege on his deals and i said i'm sorry i made a mistake i'm i'm wrong i made the mistake he stomps out of the room at that moment the peace i had with that little decision i wouldn't trade it for nothing because i knew i'd surrender to god that was a baby step but i surrendered to god it wasn't my flesh i was a young man this was a nice car like i mean this this had some noise to it this had different things going on that would you know that would juice up the male testosterone a little bit like it it it did something so i'm there and i'm good but the peace i had you know that manager comes back in and he says well i believe god wants you to have that car because i'm going to give it to you for this price thank you lord but it was a lesson and i'm glad i went through it because it taught me that there's something inside of me that's greater than the outer man and i want to give place to that i want to allow that half the preeminence in my life i want that more than i want anything else it helped me many years down the road when i met my wife and i know that was god's choice for me and i know it was and i'll tell you many times i've come back and i've said lord and she can testify the same thing it was you that brought us together i know what i had surrendered to god i know what i had given him and to this day i've been blessed because of it so i thank god so i'm just using little steps back to moses moses he was we only know the intellectual side god knows what's in man moses was born in this world a gifted boy he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with the equipment in him every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment and i firmly believe in the foreknowledge of god the predestination so brother madam now goes and says it this way he says these great qualities he was born for a certain thing god has a purpose of you being here see if you can only get to that place how much trouble you save god and yourself to but sometimes we take the road of jacob you know just no this is what i want and i'll i'll get it and i'll cheat a little along this way and i'll cheat this way and you know god let jacob go on a long road you know jacob means shyster who did who did god allow jacob to hook up with laban equally probably 10 times the shyster because that's how many times he changed his wages but he allowed all those things to happen and and and finally you know jacob sneaks away in the dead of night and he does all of these things but inside of jacob you know though the outward was not right and though esau was the better man and esau took care of his mom and esau did all of these things but inside of jacob was something that god saw and he desired and he loved it and when it came out in moments of crisis it was jacob that came out and he finally came to the river and he heard esau was coming and you know like any man that real man he sends his wives before him and and so he's he's just bringing him out there into two caps and then he stays back at the river but here he's now face to face with god and as he's face to face with god the key the angel keeps asking himself as he's wrestling what's your name what's your name you finally have to confess it jacob i'm a shyster and when that's all god wants to hear confess friends we we can't we can't work ourselves up to religion i'm no good we are no good in our flesh but the god that has called us that god what is it revelations 12 he says we overcome by the blood of the lamb that that that that's step one number two by the word of our testimony so it's never our righteousness and our testimony is testimony it's it's a test of i moani so it's it's i've got to be a part of it i've got to confess it by our testimony and then the last thing is and they love not their lives to death so our desires to the world become dead they they die out and we get to this place so he says now you had a purpose moses was born he said and i'm going to try and miss some of this you can read in the message why christ speak he said the seed was laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver the people yet it never came to light until the light from the burning bush flashed across it he's seen it not something he read about not something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh how that brings life he says any woman any boy or girl with an intellectual conception of what the word is can never have a full foundation until they've met that light that brings the word to reality oh how we need to meet that oh we need to know him and meet him i believe we're living in our friends where it's not so much our lateral relationships who it is but it's our it's our relationship vertically with god that matters and and that daily connection with him that's the important thing no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental can thrive until the supernatural is made known among the people and they see it something they can talk to that talks back to them and and he says that's and that vindicates this written word i i love to see that you know we all have our orderly fashion we we all have these things but i'll tell you what just to to let go and let god we we have prayer meetings on a bi-weekly bi-weekly basis and we just had one the other just a few weeks ago brother dale you'd remember and we're there and we we just had situation sister laura one of them and other situations were praying about and and we're there and we just closed the service and you know hearts had expressed what it was and we just began to sing a song and you know you know the greatest thing you can do is you can turn your eyes on jesus sometimes we try to manufacture just an experience we we try to make it happen but all you need to do is focus on jesus and and i just got to this place and i said lord you're the one and i just began to raise my hands and and all of a sudden i don't even know how it happened but just something overtook me and just words of praise and glory and honor it was it was yielded to god when he's first friends then everything takes care of itself you if there's if there's anybody who who suffers depression the biggest thing you need to do is get yourself off of i and look to him if you ever want to overcome if there's ever a suicide spirit just look to him make him the center of your attention make him the center of everything and stop worrying about yourself that's what the world tells you to take care of yourself and do things but when it's on him that's when everything turns right that's when your movement is right that's when your words are right that's when your love is correct when your attention's on him oh he's everything he is all in all that's that's where we're going here and i believe i'll come to some scriptures in in the next services but i'm i he's all in all he extends far further than we think so here's moses and as as he's moving along and and he's he's passing through you know just heard that testimony of sister laura we had a sister in our church sister vera her last name was her husband lauren had passed away probably 10 years earlier she was in her 80s healthy just just wonderful but you'd looked in her eyes you could see she was tired and we had a few covet creases cases break out in our church and during that time we lost three people two to covert one as an elderly brother but all were elderly actually and all if i actually look at it they didn't want to stay anymore they'd lost their will they wanted to go home and you know when that desire goes and they go home she was just doing fine and and she was there at the meetings she went to the store she dropped in the middle of the store next thing she woke up in the hospital she has a daughter in the united states and and she's in the hospital seemingly doing okay not not a lot of issues and her daughter is just communicating with her regular and she says to her daughter she says ma she says to charlene i i'm gonna go home and charlene says no you can't go home she's you gotta wait till they discharge you and connect you she says i don't wanna go to the house i wanna go home and be with lauren and he says well mom yeah that's nice mom so that was the next day so the next day she calls and she says um charlene they're coming for me really soon now within three hours she was gone she had her heart's desire she she wasn't looking here anymore and and i and you can say you know i've watched the lifespan of of believers you know when they get to a certain time and it's almost like their theophany is calling and and just begin to you know i my mother is 89 i wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for my mother she prayed for me she's done things for me you know lately i just just she seems to she said to me the other day she said ed i don't know what it is i keep hearing the singing in the house and she says and i know i don't have the cassette player but it's really nice singing and i thought okay and then she's now said that a few times you know at the age my mom hit 70 and and she she she by the grace of god watched god changed me from a renegade to where i was at and i would say i remember all the times i was out till two in the morning and then i all of a sudden this wherever the function i was it was going strong and also and it just disbanded it all disappeared and i well there's nowhere to go i just better go home i go home and here's my mom on her knees praying she said i woke up half an hour ago and you weren't home and i started praying and now i knew what broke up the party you think that there's not power in prayer there is power in prayer she she could tell you my brother was in a serious accident and she said and she woke up with a start she says where were you last night the next morning she said to my brother i saw the wheel hanging off of a cliff where were you and he said it was close mom it was really close you don't think that god's in the there's a world there's a dimension that is so real and if we could just tap into it and live in it i believe it's happening around us you know i don't know how many of you remember brother dan williams it was a minister out of louisiana brother dan williams he passed on many years ago well brother homer longoria his wife had passed away or she was passing away the children come in the room and you know we all think you know as we read these scriptures about the natural man and the spiritual man god knows our nature he knows who we are he he gave us these characters you want to be yourself brother dan was always kind of like you know he was a fun guy to be around like he he he was just he relatable to everybody and and so here he here he comes here she comes and she's just at her time of passing and her children are in the room and she can she's talking now she's talking and she's going oh and and and it says mom what are you seeing i just saw brother dan do you know that he still got the sense of humor and i thought god knows these things god knows where we're at you know here's here's my mom you know she's she says it's age of 70. i'm ready to give my life to the lord if he wants to take me i'm ready to go and here here you know but yet we still live here and here she is in the middle we had a there's a flood in her basement you know and she came out of the war years and she had to do canning and all these things there was a flood she's got like memorabilia i call it but she thinks she can use it sometime of canning goods and and different things and hasn't been touched in 20 years or whatever and there's a flood and i'm starting to take things out she's going no no no don't take that don't just careful we might need that and here on one hand she's i'm ready to go here on the other hand watch out we're still in this flesh we're still here like we still have our humanity and and so we we got to recognize and begin to separate and say okay here's my natural man but there's a spiritual man inside there's a seed inside that's longing to go home you know i i love to go out and get on the water and get kayaking or solitude or or you know travel we used to love to travel and you know and and do different things and and as much as i enjoy those things i would say they don't have the the level of satisfaction they did anymore why we're in a season where it's time to come a little higher you know i i i don't want to go just to a lake and hear somebody park next to somebody or camp somebody and they turn the music on what good is that i want to go home and i think that that that that's rising up in us more and more so i think we need to just keep our eyes and focus let me keep going hebrews 11 verse 25 he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season so he began to choose he began to look and as brother branham would say pharaoh looked out of the window and he saw these people and he said they're slaves they're mud daubers now moses was raised up in that court trained in all the ways but he began to look out of that court and when god the same window and he began to look and said no they're not slaves these are the people of god they're esteemed of god and i i there was times i wouldn't want to be seen with believers in the company my friends but i'll tell you what i'm proud to be with believers i'm proud to walk with my wife down the mall or or in the shopping we don't often go shopping together because as brother barry would say men go shopping women go shopping but but you know just it's it's like when we're on holidays or somewhere then we go together right and you know men are there for the quick strike approach you know which ex which entrance how do i get the store click and how would i go and you know and then my wife would spend two hours at the mall and say well what do you they didn't have anything you mean all the shelves were empty no no that's not what i meant but they didn't have what i what i was shopping for and so anyway i just say all of that you know my wife is to me the epitome of what i believe you know we we go somewhere and and and and this is this is the glory of what i believe i they might not believe my doctrine but watch my wife and and the woman is a reflection the bride is a reflection of who christ is so we begin to see we begin to look at things differently we don't we don't look with natural eyes we begin to look and and our vision has to change and so brother branham would talk about this with moses he said moses looked on this people and said they're god's blessed people and he says oh if christians today if you rely on their senses of what they can see what they understand instead of their faith then you look with your eye and the glamour you women he said you must let your hair grow you mustn't and you know you have to remember we're an unredeemed flesh so you you begin to look at these things and it begins to pull you to those things so we we need to always stay in the channel and allow our soul to be fed now i don't mean being super spiritual but just stay away from things that cause you trouble don't don't go down that road and and you know and brother ram says you i don't want to read everything for the sake of time but when you start looking at those things it paralyzes your faith you don't give your faith a chance to grow we find moses's faith led him to watch what would be not what was i was coming into a situation where i had to to deal with a certain individual and and it was even in a in a church realm and and i thought well what would this individual think if i did this and this and and i was just under great agony and stress and as i as i came to it the thought just started coming to me i'm not going to stand before this individual at the day of judgment i'm going to stand before god it says therefore lord i'm going to look to you and see what you want me to see not what this individual thinks i should be not what i think i should be in the eyes of that individual but we want to look through the eyes of god you know i always marvel about the spies that went across the the in into the ten the twelve spies that went into the into the promised land to search out the land you know 10 of them came back and i imagine if they had a powerpoint presentation i was i was imagining what would it be like you know and and so 10 of them you know they would focus and they'd have the powerpoint up there and and and in their in there and you actually read the bible it says in the eyes of them we looked like grasshoppers so they're not even looking through their own eyes they're looking through what they think them those giants are looking at well they look at us like grasshoppers so if that was their perspective that's what the powerpoint showed so no doubt as as you looked at the powerpoint they were looking up at the knees in the knobby knees they were looking up at these these giants that was that was the focus and maybe in the background out of focus there were some grapes there were some of the promises but they began to look by what their eyesight saw so faith gets you to see what god wants you to see so i'm not you know and so then i imagine here's joshua and kill hold and hold it that's the wrong power point let me show you the one look at this valley look at these things ah there's a few giants down there but they began to look at the right thing so so we need to i i believe we really need to bring this into play i i believe we don't just come to church you know slip into a routine and then say okay i got to think good thoughts i'm in church no i think we need to put it into practice the minute we step out the door the minute i walk out the door i'm a christian i'm going to think good thoughts i'm going to allow my mind this is a battleground but i'm not giving it to the devil i'm giving it to god i'm going to allow good things to to come into my mind and so it affects our vision it affects our our seeing so here's moses he said he began to see either your faith will paralyze the glamour or the glamour will terrorize your paralyze your faith now brother branham brings this down to now it's easy to look back at historical things but he brings it right to us he said now that's a hard thing for a man with a position that's a hard thing for the teenage girl that's pretty that's a hard thing for the teenage boy that's popular in school a star in basketball oh young fellow how god could use you young girl you and your fine pretty little queenish looks why don't you use that influence to the kingdom of god what god gave it to you for the virtue of womanhood use it that way you're bound to come out the right way but anyway other way you've got to fail you'll be a total total failure god made you nobody else can take your place nobody can feel that you must be that way let me finish in hebrews and i'm going to move on to something else here he says in verse 26 esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt he had respect unto the recompense of the reward in other words he didn't look at the future he looked down the road and he says this by faith he forsake egypt not fearing the wrath of the king but he endured as seeing him who is invisible i think we need to begin to see the one thing i i marvel on you know i i watched the videos of luther and and what he fought and how catholicism brought in you know catholicism began to rule i'm just speaking a series at home on organized religion and taking it back to genesis and taking out how even we can slip into the same things right in the message we can bring our children up and and fear if you don't do this if you don't do that but god doesn't operate by fear the the catholic church was the one who put pictures of hell and stuff up and they began to bring purgatory and you know and we begin to get that way even around the message somebody's out in the world and they come in okay well just sit there you've got to pay your dues you no the minute they're saved and they actually repent they're on par with every one of us the blood of the lamb is that powerful and and so we we got to be careful that we don't allow these things to just slip in we want to we want to bring in the freedom and the liberty of god in into into into where we're going and and so it's important that we we we keep this vision before us the right way and we see we see christ now i i want to just let me let me finish this he says uh no i've read this already okay so so we have a place and god has a place for us and and we need to begin to see it that way and i i'm using this in my own testimony but when i first came out i never thought i thought oh if i could only scrape in when i never realized the heart of god was beating for me and he wanted me to come to a place and and he wanted me to be there more than i wanted it myself and it was the devil that was beating me down it was the devil that was bringing all of these things but but what was unfolding as we come in as we begin to see more and more of god and i i'm going to just only use like an example because we we often view you know i gotta escape as we're the little pee-wee but really things as i see them are beginning to rotate more and more around the bride i i was looking at a couple of the testimonies that brother berry had put up and uh about a sister who was riding the bus and she somehow on the bus in ukraine she got off a stop too early and as she got off a stop if this was brother barry or another brother i don't know she got off a stop too early and she she got out and she says what am i doing here how come i got off here and the bus went on another block and a bomb hit it and here she was that was luck no that was the ordination of god and and and god's program i i'm beginning to see more and more is it all revolves around us the bride my wife and i we just traveled you know even the circumstances of not having our trip right and everything we have a layover in toronto and we stop and we meet a young man who was uh in my my middle son's school from and was a friend of us for many years he's not a message believer he's a he's a good young man he's he's a big big kid and and we just saw him and we just met him and i remember my boy was in junior high he was going through he's he's he's a smaller smaller boy and and and something was changing in his behavior and i he left some books at school one night and i went after there and i i just felt so grieved something's wrong and i stopped and i prayed over his locker and i said lord i take charge of this school and all the influences for the sake of my son who is your son and i just prayed that prayer my son i didn't know it was the victim of bullying and he was walking with this man named thomas is the guy we saw at the airport he was walking with him down school and this bully had come and see my son and my son kind of went off the side and then this bigger he's a big farm kid thomas and and he must have been 12 13 or something at the time but he was like six foot and he noticed he's a gentle gentle man you know and you notice caleb is just there and he says is that guy bothering you yeah he's bothering me and as that man comes he stops he pushes him up against the locker you don't touch him and he never bothered my son again and god had that boy there for a reason so if if we if we view oh i gotta safeguard my child no we've gotta we've gotta empower one thing that is the god in us over every situation and i we've seen it a number of times in in in things in our family and in our home different things that we've gone through and i remember our daughter we went to the to the school and it was a logos program was a christian based program but it was in the public system and our daughter he was very good academically and and we went and we brought her into the first day of junior high and we went there and we we met the principal and we just said listen our daughter will not be participating in physical education activities she won't be doing this and this and and she won't be doing halloween or there was no halloween but it was these are these things and their principles looking okay she's looking at us like we got three eyes or something right and and he said let me call the the phys ed teacher he called the phys ed teacher and he called him in and and and he he said okay yeah we'll do that we'll you know and so i wasn't dominating him i was just telling him this is what we stand for after three years my daughter had honors every year she volunteered my wife was there every day after three years we come to the final thing and the principal comes up to us and he's got tears in his eyes and he says i want to thank you your family has been a blessing in this school and your daughter and he had literally had tears in his eyes friends these things are ours they're our inheritance we don't have to to to just knuckle down no we we say we are the children of god and i think we can employ them with our families and with our children and wherever they go god's eyes are upon us and and we need to just be able to walk with those things all right let's return to the book of mark chapter eight for a well in a few moments that was a long time in hebrews just a quick scripture but i'm i i'm just i'm just sharing tonight i want to make this just pertinent and real i've got some other thoughts that i actually meant to do tonight but i as i was studying this afternoon i just said no just just push that off a little bit so i'm doing that and i'm doing this so mark chapter 8. we're going to read from verse 22. now and he came to bethsaida and they they were bringing a blind man unto him and they besought him to touch him and he took the blind man by the hand and he took him out of his town and when he had spit on his eyes man i'm sure there was glad there's no health inspectors there at that moment and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought and he looked up and he said i see men as trees walking now i i haven't gone into this and i probably should you know i won't do this to you sweetheart but my wife worked for an optometrist and i could get her come up here and explain but she'd be horrified if i did that so i'm not going to do that but they claim that most optometrists and and and surgeons that work with the eye are christians because they say there is no organism in the human body like the eye and they say there's no way a big bang theory created this they they say it's it's so complex and so so far-reaching so here we see jesus and and you know i'm not going to get into the retina and all of these things but there's a portion of the eye that that can see and so here jesus he he can see things but to bring a recognition or an understanding and the brain signals back so here he sees things and jesus says what do you see i see men as trees walking and after that he put his hands upon his again on his eyes and he made him look up and he was restored and he saw every man clearly so i i want to bring this just as an analogy any and you can look at something but you can't always understand it you can look and say yeah i see that but you can't see the intent of what that is to bring to your heart to your mind to your brain that that that takes a work of god and and to really make it real as i shared this little little quotation about brother branham speaking about the berlin wall my eyes saw the berlin wall the world saw that but when when my heart saw its place in the scripture i said yes lord that's you and and so there's there's things that god controls in our seeing that have to be made real to us that we ourselves don't see naturally it's a work of god it's not a work of of any physician or any eye but it's something god is doing and i i've just i've just marveled on on how god does things i i i may be going all over the place here if you look as god leads us up to something he points us to something he points us to something he points us to something but as we step into the vision or we walk in the vision now we're we're seeing it in real life and and i'll use these examples if you take the word atonement it's it's in the bible 70 times 69 times in the old testament so the old testament is projecting the atonement but the new testament is the atonement so now you're you're you're looking for an atonement not the blood of bulls and ghosts but now it's christ our atonement and you're walking in the atonement so you're not looking to the atonement anywhere but you're walking in it and you see clearly all the benefits around you you can go in the bible and you can take other places and and you can look at all the gospels and you'll find the word faith in matthew in mark and in luke but you will not find the word faith in the book of john so matthew and mark they're they're saying you've got to have faith you've got to do these things but john because the bible says faith worketh by love not not by by do's and don'ts and fear and forcing but by love now john was walking in faith he was living something out that the others never saw and we in this age are are walking out and living things that past ages never saw and even within the framework of the message we we would see things that you know we'd seen them afar off but now they're here and and i i just i just i can't help it and i wish i can explain this better but you know i used to look at a certain brother a certain way and i always thought he's always got that limp and he always claps his hands that way and he has this mannerism where he does this but over time over time you you kind of see that's just the outside this is the inside i actually have to do that right in my own home with my wife because she's got her ways about her i you know you she might find a couple of things about me but i don't know what they might be but if you go in our home and the male arrives and you you look at you know who opened the mail by the way it's open because i go over to the drawer i pull out a knife cut it off pull it out ah okay when she gets the mail rips the letter to shreds the envelope to shreds pulls it out ha ha i've got it that coupon for that fabric or whatever it is but but but you know so so she has her ways about her right but there was a way in the book of genesis that was hid to man and the bible says the cherubims blocked in the book of genesis they blocked the way of the tree of life so who that tree of life was that was christ that way began to be dark and obscure to man and and for for two thousand or four thousand years of history they they never could come to see what that way is because there's an anointing that wouldn't allow them to see it but now when christ came our atonement when he came he was the tree of life there was there was a covering they had a veil over the temple he was veiled in his flesh but but those with the seed gene and god of god in him they could see behind the veil they could see the nature of god the heart of god they weren't just looking at the peripheral yes that was him but behind the veil there was christ there was the nature of god that's why i think it's so important to listen to tapes when you listen to tapes you're not just picking quotes and this is this and this and this is but you begin to catch the nature of the spirit of god as it's working through the prophet and as you catch that nature you're actually becoming a partaker of that nature you're catching and seeing things that your intellect isn't seeing you're you're seeing a part of god no this is not how god works this is not what he desires we so often take our own nature and we want to apply it to the word that way but god wants us to take his nature and his spirit and he wants us to be an embodiment he wants to express himself and his nature through us i i i i try to bring the human part not that it's bad because like i said we all have our ways there's parts of myself that if i really consider i don't like parts of myself and how they are when i really examine it in the light of god but god allowed that to be there but i say lord you made me this way channel it and use it but let that inner man be governed by you and and when we begin to now walk in those things and you know i gave an example in the bible let me give you one in the message brother branham if you type in boaz you'll find it 73 times in the message 67 of those times are prior to 1963. during the seals he mentions boaz just a few times and then only once in 64 and once in 65 and i'm just taking the type so there's a part of our seeing that even the prophet as he's walking in he's pointing to boaz he's our redeemer you know i i won't get into the whole story of ruth but you know there was ruth she had four different stages there was a time when she identified herself as just a moabite then there was a time when she identified herself as a gleaner then there was a time when she identified herself as a kinswoman and she began and then she took the final step where she says i i'm the one that's here for you i'm a part of you and and so these were steps she had to come to she had to leave behind the moabite she had to leave the gleaner behind to take on the next step and so the message itself you know it's bringing us to our boaz which is christ the all in all he's the one in us among us he's through every gift he's through every ministry it's him through the body that's the one we want to see and it's boaz he's our all in all now we're not just walking and pointing to boaz but boaz is here boaz ought to govern us he ought to be a part of us so we're not just looking at something far off anymore but it's among us [Music] that's the one that we look to i believe there's a part where the message not to be a partial realization but a full realization amen and and god is such a gentleman he's not gonna you know there's a part in the seals brotherhood says if satan could get a hold of this he would do great damage god only unfolds it to his bride he only whispers his love secrets to her so what do we want to see we're looking and seeing ourselves now how are we doing for time there's no clock oh my my clock here says 5 30 and the service started at at 7. that's strange my what have you [Laughter] your pull is pushing the clock back [Laughter] no we won't do that we're gonna we're gonna do this brother branham would talk about the book and he would call it the book of life and then the lamb's book of life and i'm i won't go into detail on this but let me just say this there's a book now what you and i never saw when we had the call we didn't know the depth of the call we didn't know what god had purposed with the call but god has a a reason and a purpose now in in questions and answers on the seals he said only those whose names are on the lam's book of life will be saved the book holds the mystery the book is unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names so it doesn't say lee vale will be saved in this church age or arm and neville no it doesn't it just shows the mystery or unfolds the mystery and there's something in our receiving set yeah this is this is this is what i've always longed for this is what i've looked for this is who i am and then it's not just i remember as god was calling me and we had this large pentecostal church in in the city and and just it was like it was coming on christmas time and they have christmas carols and you'd come around and they had this what they called the singing christmas tree and it was made up of singers like 20 rows deep up into this tree and i go this is kind of nice but you know the seed in me wouldn't stop there the seed went a little bit further the seed had to go to its fullness and and and i i'm just saying right now we're coming to a time where even even god has it so orchestrated that he'll stop world events for one seed now you i won't have time but you go to revelations chapter 7 and it says here's the angels and he told them hold back the winds hold back the winds he says you can't bring that persecution until all my elect are sealed now now brother branham he goes a little further and he talks it and he says we don't know right now where this revival is going on or it's not going on we don't see enthusiasm but maybe it's like this he says maybe there's a little boy or a little girl born in seattle washington the book holds their name he came to redeem those whose name was on the book and then the human race she fell she can't accept it now she's too young now one seed and he says so the church uses these words we'll slug right along play right along or play along have meetings and so forth until the last person is brought in then the book is closed there's no more added it's all over then now we don't know what that time what that hour is so look at the principle of god he's interested in his seed there there is so much going on right now in in the time we live in and i i came to this quotation and i hope i put it in i hear this and you know it's amazing how we went from all the attention being on kovid to being on the trucking industry in ottawa to being on a war with russia ukraine and russia and people you know you go into a coffee shop russia and russia and it's like it's it's written and so we ourselves look you know there's quotations when russia comes down for the oil and all of these things and and i came across this and will the church go through the tribulation and he says before one speck of fire could fall from heaven lot had to go out of sodom now if you read that story it was abraham who was interceding for lot in sodom and he negotiated from 50 to 45 to 30 down down to 25 to 10 and he negotiated if there's five and the angel left off now you'd think did abraham get his negotiation you don't know but the next thing is the angels are literally pulling lot out of sodom and saying we can't do anything until you come out why because there's a prayer of a seed of god called abraham interceding for that man now we're no different today our prayers i believe our prayers we've seen our prayer meetings at home we've seen them change situations we've seen them change things in our own families we've seen things happen and we know it's just god but it's not not us in it but it's god using these vessels and he's changing things so it's not the way the wheels around us the great movements that we're just being tossed to and fro no we're in the center of this whole thing so he says this before the atom bomb can strike this nation the church will go in the rapture to meet the lord jesus i'll tell you what i rest in that there's not going to be one thing happen until i'm gone and i stand on that no matter how wild the dictators look and no matter what they do and brother branham would he listen to this picture he paints two sides to it he says there he says if the sputniks now that's not part of the american space program just you know that if the sputniks and the missiles are set and the hammers are pulled back he says now that's on earth but he says the angels are standing in order hallelujah the great quarters of heaven is crowded full the harps are in tune the great bands are practiced up there's a homecoming time pretty soon for the church of the living god that's been waiting for his coming he said everything's in order oh i'm so glad i'm so tired oh for that great hour and to think we have a part in this junction time he says remember so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is revealed from heaven before the rain fell noah was in the ark before the fire fell lot was out of sodom for the angel said you i can't do nothing until you come hither and now listen the same angel says i g to think he says i've got my hand on a lever in my hand to pull and make fires fall from heaven and i think that's it exactly he says the angel of destruction is holding the hand of russia with the atomic bombs until the church comes together as one great body of christ i can't do nothing till you come hither who's holding it back the church that is here the seed of god that is here we've got to come together in one mind in one body in one heart it's christ the all in all yes sir he said here's that same angel oh if that isn't a blessed assurance we see everything set in order the going of the home the church of going home of the church is in order you know if we were to come in this church before we were saved i'll tell you what we wouldn't have hardly sat through the song service there would have been swearing or cussing there would have been all kinds of thoughts and things but what what what's brought us together to sit still all this time there's a common spirit it's growing it's coming together you know if we could see if we could see that the christ in us you know i i just see things happening that even even coming here brother jonathan the airlines are going to charge me like 500 bucks more ticket i go lord you can't do this like we had to change our ticket and i just said how am i and i went back later that night waiting on on hold i said i'll just try the computer one more time i go in it's all like zeroes it's all cleared off oh thank the lord and i thought oh i'm sorry it had to be that way if it wasn't that way i had little things at home that all of a sudden came up we had a brother pass away at the last minute if we wouldn't have been home i wouldn't have been there for that our church is having the funeral for sister laura collins tomorrow i i has helped the brothers arrange and do things and i think god you've got it so in order it's just so designed you know like everything's connected let me just share another testimony you've got just a few more minutes i'm not going to be much longer my wife and my daughter many years ago went to book tickets to go to the louisiana camp meetings and uh so you know we we were just busy i was going to stay home with the boys the boys were going to stay at grandma's house because dad doesn't cook very good breakfast so so they were going to do that but my wife was going with my daughter so she's flying from edmonton to calgary all the way to houston they're going to rent a car drive to louisiana it's another three hours or whatever three and a half hours and be part of the spring camp so anyway i dropped her off at the airport always leaving at 5 a.m in the morning or something like that so brother jonathan that's why these things happen but it would anyway left dropped her off we're going they landed in calgary and everything's good we're doing fine okay great good good good get a call a few hours later we're in houston everything is wrong so what's wrong do you lose your vanity or something or you know is it what's wrong and she says i went to go and rent the car and i don't have my credit card we'd pre-paid it before we left but they will not allow you to take the car to take the vehicle without the card and so oh my goodness i said well let me talk to them you know and i said can we pay here and you can accept it there no you can't do that we i was on the phone negotiating this is on a wednesday you know i've got to prepare for church that night and you know we're going my daughter's in tears because she wanted to stop shopping somewhere and she couldn't do it now and all kinds of things happening and you know how traumatic these things are anyway we're just like and i'm going there's got to be a way and then she she said okay we're going to try that we have a sears card so sure enough they took sears okay great they ran through and said oh this is sears canada no we don't take that here oh great i thought well maybe i'll i'll i'll fly a card down or you know we'll do something he says sir if it's if it's a legitimate card you can't fly it down you you you can't you can't have an active credit card in the mail system like oh my goodness i didn't know these rules we're just sitting there i'm thinking who do we know that would be there and we knew some believers but they were in other areas it was too far away and then i said well maybe you can ask someone or something and so my wife is there and my daughter's in tears and they they're everything they can't get the car rental and and and she sees a lady coming so she hangs up you know i says i gotta so she talked to this lady and this lady goes i'm not helping you out no way and and then another person walked by and then this guy comes by and he explains the predicament and he says i'll help you just wait a minute and uh so he he goes away and he comes back and sandy calls me this man's gonna help me he's he's such and such and and and okay so they went he came over my wife had cash with her says i'll pay you the cash for the car card and he's just gonna put his credit card down now hey she could have taken that car and gone across north america with it but he had to trust her so he comes up and she'd been to all the car agents and they all knew and they and so this man put his car down the car the lady at this desk says sir do you know what you're doing he says yeah i know what i'm doing this is a stranger in houston american city and my wife is there and he puts it down she gives him the cash it's on his card now the caveat is he has to go with her to the car drive it out and then she can take it so she goes down they're in the lot my wife and my daughter and all of a sudden my wife realizes this guy is six foot four 220 pounds and and he's in the car and i'm in the car with this guy oh no so my wife says do you mind if i just pray he says sure she prays and she says thank you for this man thank you for all these things and and he he bowed he was they drove out he gave her the car there's a whole part to this story i'm not going to tell you you can ask my wife about but there was like it was it was a thing anyway i talked to this guy and i said sir thank you for what you're doing if there's anything and he says no i'll take your number etc etc my wife gets in the car they drive they make it to louisiana with some incidents along the way but they made it there and then as as my wife is driving she's talking to me says that was like an angel like how big was the angel of the lord and i'm thinking about it so now it's like 5 30. i got to get ready for service and leave for church in an hour i didn't have anything ready i i just went to church and i i preached on stepping out in faith so out of this little incident i preach on stepping out in faith there was three brothers one had lost his job that way one had a marital situation one had another god so moved in the service they all said i'm stepping out in faith and they went home and situations changed in the meantime my wife gets there and and and then i get a call the next day it's coming up to easter and i get a voice message from this man did your wife make it okay is everything all right and and i said yeah she made it i can't thank you enough for what you did he says well when you get the final receipt let me know and if i owe you money i'll pay you and he says no and he said have a blessed day this is not a message believer this is not we don't know this guy from anybody the meetings were over my wife came back we got the bill she had overpaid him thirty dollars we sent him a note back and said listen we overpaid you thirty dollars but you keep it we don't need it thank you for all your help we can't thank you enough he says no i'll have none of it ten days later i get a letter in the mail with 30 dollars and he says i wouldn't have given this to you but i want you to know my story i'm a single parent i have three daughters one day they might need help i was able to help your wife maybe god will look down and help my children in their need friends that doesn't happen that doesn't happen but god is greater than all things we've prayed many times for that man said lord wherever he is and wherever his daughters are you watch over them maybe he's never a message believer maybe he's never but maybe on the day of judgment when everybody is down here and and and christ is up here and his bride is behind them maybe that man comes up one day and as he comes up one day and he says i'm so and so and he says what did you do and i did this i don't know if he's denominational i don't know if he's a trinitarian or whatever it is but he says okay and i'm going to pronounce judgment and he turns to his bride do you have anything to say my wife and i will stand up and say this man helped us in a time that we had need and jesus will turn to him and say you come on in friends that's how big our god is it's not us it's him in us he is all in all he's greater than everything [Music] i believe that if we can see it you know we preach a god we make him so narrow-minded we put him in a box he's a god of judgment if they don't see the message we've narrowed it down if they don't see it my way well they're not even in listen god is bigger than all of that god is a good god he's on your side he doesn't want anybody to perish he wants you to live blessed he wants you to be an overcomer we're passing through time but we make decisions that are eternal that have lasting implications for eternity they're not just to hear a little thing oh can i get a better job and can i have this and this that's part of it yes but i think we ought to live for more listen i'm i'm going to leave it with that today i've got more i'm going to take this a little further do you want to serve them more love them more do you want to be able to see as he sees let's have the musicians come i i believe we're living in a tremendous time when there's things that are happening i i i don't know about you friends but i can't see the message even the same anymore i i i i i look at people like if you're feeding on the word you know we talk about the gift of discernment the greatest discernment you'll have is by staying in the word it'll allow you to see things and and and understand and see situations friends we know him he he's the master of the wind he's our god he's with us everywhere and and i think if we can say even the people you meet in the world god brings them across our path sometimes if he brought a possum across the prophet's path you know are are we in the flesh do we suffer things do we all do we see these glories no i i marvel at how paul paul is the messenger the first messenger to the age and he's being sent to rome and as he goes to rome he's in the court of festus and festus is holding him there and as festus is holding him he holds him and he says no paul you just wait in prison you know how long he waited in prison the bible says two years the messenger to the age two years and then agrippa comes and paul comes out and he's released was that fun was that easy no it wasn't paul was in a prison we're in situations we think i don't like this i don't want this but that saint paul when he was on a journey an angel said you've got to come to rome he could look a storm in this face of his eye in the face of his face and say god promised i'm going to get to rome that's how you and i can look at russia and say the church has got to come together before that bomb will ever be released paul could a viper come on his hand he shook it off why i've got a purpose i got a destination i've got to fulfill it i'm called for a purpose you look at all the men in the bible i look at joseph joseph here's joseph he he interprets the dream surely i'll be in pharaoh's courthill they'll let me go they'll do this and he sits for two more years waiting joseph a type of christ here we sit waiting waiting the hour's coming the hour's coming you know i i marvel at brother branham you know the things he's sitting in in meetings and he's sitting he's sitting there and there's men behind him could you imagine the spiritual things they're hating what he's saying and yet he's just standing there one of the greatest messages the rapture and then things that are to be the rapture is held in a conference room and you hear him in the last 25 30 minutes oh the lady at the back is cleaning i know she's telling us to get out here he's preaching the rapture and yet he's dealing with this a cleaning lady cleaning dishes in the middle of his service friends this is the world you and i live in we got we got this is happening oh this is happening this happened but there's a seed inside of us there's a god that's that's here no matter what we're faced with and i say we let's focus and let's keep our eyes on the right thing amen let's just stand together tonight oh my there's this i'm going to get you brothers to help me sing but let's just sing turn your eyes upon jesus turn your eyes upon jesus do you know

[Music] let's just say this world is not my home i'm just a passing through yes i'm just a sea gene passing through and brother branham in the message of god he said this part of the word as he said about jesus jesus who in the days of his flesh so there was a part of jesus ministry that was in the flesh there was a part that was going to come through a bride and there's a part that's going to take us through eternity amen let's just sing this and then as we go into it brother bob will come up and he'll conclude for us here this this world is [Music] me [Music] [Music] one thing i know

tonight and to remember to pray for the needs that were mentioned earlier and we just continue to pray for sister darlene god's grace to her at this time and continue to pray for brother ed that god would give him rest tonight and and strength for tomorrow amen because and it is incumbent on us to pray for the service brother branham said in god in simplicity he said when a minister walks into a congregation of people praying and the anointing of the spirit is about them you're bound to hear from heaven that's part of a quote thank god and simplicity so that's there's the benefit of praying again you know we want to hear from god right we don't hear from brother red all due respect we want to hear from god through you right so we pray for brother ed to heal himself to let god use him to put us up on a higher plane in faith amen let's just sing that tonight god bless each one and just remember no matter how difficult things may be god's got it all in control and there's a purpose amen
