[42:29] we've switched the slide deck up so I
[42:31] got some feedback from the deacons that

[42:39] with black lettering so by all means let

[43:03] in my name he will give it to you
[43:05] hitherto have ye asked nothing in my
[43:07] name ask and you shall receive that your
[43:11] joy may be full these things have I
[43:13] spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time
[43:15] cometh when I shall no more speak unto
[43:17] you in Proverbs but I shall show you
[43:19] plainly of the father at that day ye
[43:22] shall ask in my name and I say not unto
[43:26] you that I will pray the father for you
[43:28] amen God bless his word you may be
[43:30] seated this evening and we are of course
[43:32] continuing on our series on Redemption
[43:34] and I I want to take a title this
[43:36] evening of the placing of the name and
[43:38] we've spoken about this adoption
[43:40] ceremony for quite some time about the
[43:42] son that approved himself and he had
[43:44] gone through the tests and the trials
[43:45] and he was ready to to step into the
[43:48] responsibilities and the expectations
[43:49] that were about to be laid on his
[43:51] shoulders and I want to focus on on one
[43:54] part of the ceremony money that was very
[43:55] special because when the child was born
[43:57] they were given a name and that name was
[43:59] their identity and so you know today
[44:02] like like my son I would have a Jonathan
[44:04] or a Jensen or a Samuel when that child
[44:06] was born he was given a name and often
[44:08] his name was that of the father or if
[44:10] not of the father then of the
[44:11] grandfather it was often a name that was
[44:13] matched up with with the family lineage
[44:15] and even if you think about John the
[44:17] Baptist when he was born and and they
[44:19] they asked what's his name going to be
[44:20] and Elizabeth said it's going to be John
[44:22] and they said but no one in your family
[44:24] is named John why are you naming him
[44:26] John and so they said to Zacharias is
[44:28] this right is she right and you remember
[44:29] he had to get the tablet he had to write
[44:31] his name as John and they were all
[44:32] amazed and they thought what is this all
[44:34] about and as soon as he said his name is
[44:36] John then he could talk again because it
[44:38] had been fulfilled what the angel had
[44:40] said to him and and then he shouted and
[44:42] he praised and because what the promise
[44:44] had come into effect but he had to give
[44:46] the right name to that child so when the
[44:48] child was born they would have a name so
[44:50] my son would be named Jonathan but that
[44:52] the ending of the ceremony then what
[44:54] happened was the father would attach his
[44:56] name to the son's name and until the son
[44:58] was ready for adoption he was just
[45:00] Jonathan or Jensen or Samuel as we would
[45:03] say today but my name would not be
[45:05] attached to his so what we would have
[45:07] today is is we'd have our name and then
[45:10] the father's name was really the surname
[45:12] if I could put it that way so today
[45:14] Jonathan's name or Jensen's name is
[45:16] Jensen but at his adoption ceremony he
[45:18] would become Jensen curlette because
[45:21] everyone knows who the curlets are and
[45:23] they know it by my name and they know it
[45:24] by my father's name I took my father's
[45:26] name and so then my sons take my name
[45:29] and the father's name is passed from
[45:30] generation to generation but only only
[45:33] if you're an adopted son
[45:35] so if you don't come to adoption they
[45:37] don't want you to have their name
[45:38] because you're going to disgrace the
[45:40] family name you're not worthy of the
[45:41] family name you didn't prove yourself
[45:42] you didn't go through and pass the
[45:45] training and stick it out the way that
[45:46] they expected and so you could be a son
[45:48] all your life but you couldn't get the
[45:50] father's name until that adoption
[45:52] ceremony
[45:54] so anybody the the beauty of the
[45:56] father's name is this that if anyone you
[45:59] know knows Jensen then he could walk up
[46:01] and they would say well what's your name
[46:02] and he would say Jensen well that
[46:04] doesn't mean anything but as soon as he
[46:05] says Jensen curlette then they're going
[46:07] to say you're a part of the curlette
[46:10] family do you know Jonathan curlette do
[46:12] you know Lanny curlette do you know
[46:14] Corgi curlette and these different ones
[46:16] if we look back through our generations
[46:17] and so as soon as the curlette name is
[46:19] attached then they know who to associate
[46:21] them with and in those days they would
[46:23] say that you would be uh you know if you
[46:25] look at Simon Peter it was Simon barjona
[46:27] and that word bar means son of so it was
[46:30] Simon son of Jonah and so all they would
[46:32] say is what's your name and he would say
[46:33] Simon and if he was adopted barjona and
[46:37] then they would say well where are you
[46:38] from well I'm from uh Capernaum or
[46:40] Galilee or this one's and they'd say oh
[46:42] so you must be so-and-so Center and
[46:44] they'd know everything about you and
[46:45] your family and your heritage and your
[46:46] history and everything just based on who
[46:49] your or what your last name was who your
[46:51] father's name was and so we look at
[46:53] these things and so you had to have the
[46:55] right character to have the name you had
[46:57] to be you had to be worthy of being
[47:00] associated with what your father had
[47:01] developed now he set the criteria not
[47:04] you and when he believed that you were
[47:05] ready to carry his name then at the
[47:07] ending of that ceremony he would say
[47:09] this is my son and he would attach his
[47:12] name to the son and now the Son and the
[47:14] father would have essentially the same
[47:16] name
[47:17] and now the Father Like I said wouldn't
[47:19] identify that boy as his son until he
[47:21] was adopted because he didn't want a
[47:23] good for nothing associated with his
[47:25] name now if he was a good for nothing
[47:26] himself he didn't care that would work
[47:28] out okay but for a real father for a man
[47:30] that have real Integrity in these things
[47:32] it was it was critical that that son
[47:35] would have a the sort of character that
[47:37] would reflect what the father has and
[47:39] even if you look I was I was doing some
[47:40] reading on the birthright last week and
[47:42] there was even a provision in the
[47:44] scriptures in the Old Testament before
[47:46] Grace that if your son wasn't good then
[47:49] you could take him you could take him to
[47:50] the gate you could take him out to and
[47:52] in front of the elders and you'd say my
[47:54] son is slothful he's a drunkard he's no
[47:56] good he's all of these things and then
[47:58] you could take him outside the city and
[48:00] stone him
[48:03] young men beware
[48:05] we don't want to go back to the law do
[48:07] we but literally why because you didn't
[48:09] want an Associated person with your name
[48:12] that didn't have the character of the
[48:13] family traits and so you could actually
[48:15] get rid of that son but the thought I'm
[48:17] coming to is that there's a lot of
[48:19] character that has to go with that name
[48:21] because there's power in the name
[48:23] there's Authority that comes with that
[48:25] names there's a responsibility that
[48:27] comes with it and you think about famous
[48:29] people good or bad and you understand
[48:30] the power of a name so today if your
[48:33] last name is Hitler
[48:35] it doesn't matter how good you are it
[48:37] doesn't matter how educated you are it
[48:39] doesn't matter how much you've tried to
[48:41] prove yourself doesn't matter how much
[48:43] money you give yourself to charity you
[48:45] know and these different things you're
[48:46] going to struggle to make friends and
[48:48] influence people
[48:49] why because your daddy or your
[48:51] granddaddy or your great-granddaddy
[48:53] killed millions of people out of racial
[48:55] prejudice
[48:56] so I guarantee you if your last name's
[48:58] Hitler you're not going to be the CEO of
[49:00] a multinational corporation you're
[49:02] probably never going to work in Human
[49:03] Resources either why because there's
[49:06] something associated with the name
[49:08] there's power with the name and in this
[49:10] name it's a limiting power it closes
[49:12] doors to you but if your last name is
[49:15] Gates on the other hand it doesn't
[49:17] matter what you look like it doesn't
[49:19] matter whether or not you give to
[49:20] charity it doesn't matter how educated
[49:21] you are how intelligent you are if they
[49:24] know or they believe that you're
[49:25] associated with Bill Gates then that's
[49:27] going to open doors to business
[49:28] opportunities to school opportunities to
[49:30] Friendship opportunities to all sorts of
[49:33] things primarily on the basis of the
[49:35] name of your father
[49:37] why because he's counted as one of the
[49:39] richest men in the world he's counted as
[49:41] intelligent he's counted as having
[49:43] influence worldwide and so if you have
[49:46] his name then they believe that you have
[49:48] an opportunity to tap into what that
[49:50] name brings because of who your father
[49:52] is amen you could do the exact same
[49:54] things as the person that's last name is
[49:56] Hitler and get a completely different
[49:58] response
[50:00] now let me make a point there because
[50:02] you can do the exact same things that a
[50:04] Christian is doing and get a completely
[50:06] different response because you're of a
[50:08] different nature because you're under a
[50:10] different name
[50:11] somebody that's Hitler does one thing
[50:13] maybe they give a million dollars to
[50:14] charity and it still won't do Malika
[50:16] good and then you do it under the name
[50:18] of gates and every door is opened and
[50:19] they're throwing parties and you're in
[50:20] the news and all of these things why
[50:22] because there's power in that name a
[50:24] name opens doors it gives you
[50:26] connections it gives you opportunities
[50:27] and it can even bring you benefits you
[50:29] haven't earned and you don't deserve
[50:32] now that's what Grace is for us that's
[50:34] what Grace is for us is we get so many
[50:36] things we don't deserve but if you look
[50:37] around the world and you look at
[50:38] especially rich kids and these different
[50:40] things they get all these benefits and
[50:42] they attribute it to themselves somehow
[50:44] and it makes them worse not better but
[50:46] they get all sorts of benefits because
[50:47] of who their father is or who their
[50:49] mother's side on the flip side again it
[50:51] can it can lead you down bad paths for
[50:53] one person a name is great and for
[50:55] another it's not the name Trudeau today
[50:57] in some circles it'll make you a
[50:58] celebrity and in other circles it'll
[51:00] make you a Target the last name Trump in
[51:02] some circles it'll give you business
[51:03] opportunities and others it closes doors
[51:06] and and people look on you with this
[51:07] stain it depends on who it is that's
[51:09] looking at you and what their personal
[51:11] beliefs are in these different things it
[51:13] doesn't matter what you've done the name
[51:14] often determines what sort of a
[51:16] reception you're going to get but let's
[51:18] take this back to the scriptures I just
[51:20] that was just kind of my preamble to set
[51:22] us up for this this morning so let's go
[51:23] back to the scriptures in John 5 43
[51:26] Jesus said I am come in my father's name
[51:29] he's talking to the priesthood he says
[51:32] ye receive me not now there was a group
[51:34] that received him and there's a group
[51:36] that didn't just receive him they
[51:37] received all of him because there's a
[51:39] distinction because remember when
[51:41] Nicodemus came they said we know that a
[51:43] man can only do these things if God is
[51:44] with them they received a portion of
[51:46] what Jesus brought but they couldn't
[51:48] receive it all and that's no good
[51:50] because if you receive only a portion it
[51:52] makes you one thing and that's lukewarm
[51:53] it makes you compromised it makes you
[51:55] half miserable
[51:57] and never happy but there was a group
[51:59] that came and they accepted everything
[52:00] and remember after he preached and he
[52:03] said unless you eat the the Flesh of the
[52:04] body of the son of man and drink his
[52:06] blood
[52:07] and afterwards they said this is a hard
[52:09] saying how can anybody understand it and
[52:12] they they were sorrowful but they left
[52:13] and then he went to the 12 and he says
[52:15] will ye also go and Peter said to whom
[52:17] else can we go Lord thou Hast the words
[52:20] of eternal life Peter didn't understand
[52:22] it Peter didn't understand it but he
[52:25] said you have the words of eternal life
[52:27] we'll stick with you until we understand
[52:28] these things but there was a group that
[52:31] couldn't understand it but look at this
[52:32] brother Braham says I wanted you to be
[52:35] sure to see that it's the anchor we have
[52:38] he's talking about Peter we are not
[52:41] anchored by a church we're Anchored In
[52:43] Christ you see he is that only way he's
[52:47] the only place of safety the only place
[52:49] that God ever put his name and God said
[52:51] he would meet the people in the place
[52:53] that he chose to put his name not in any
[52:56] gate but in the gate that he chose and
[52:59] in that place he would meet the people
[53:00] and there only
[53:03] Peter says Thou alone has the words of
[53:05] Life The Word of Life is with you so
[53:08] we've got to stay with you no matter
[53:09] what
[53:10] he says and we find out that God never
[53:12] put his name anywhere but in his son
[53:15] Jesus Christ as the son always always
[53:19] always always always takes the name of
[53:21] the father and we'll get into this much
[53:23] much later but we know the bride also
[53:25] always takes the name of the husband
[53:26] there's two types going on there but
[53:28] there's a deeper Revelation here because
[53:30] they were all looking for the Messiah
[53:32] they were groaning they were crying out
[53:34] for it they were under the oppression of
[53:35] the Romans life was miserable and they
[53:38] were all calling for it they were
[53:39] expecting it they were looking for it
[53:41] they were all good Believers in that
[53:43] sense they had a common desire and that
[53:45] was for the Messiah to calm amen but
[53:48] when it stood in front of them the vast
[53:50] majority of them missed it
[53:53] only 120 made it into the Upper Room
[53:55] everybody else missed it why because
[53:58] they put their own interpretation to it
[54:01] they believe the word but they believe
[54:03] the word by their own interpretation and
[54:06] so when God came with his interpretation
[54:07] of what the Messiah was they completely
[54:10] missed it and they couldn't see all the
[54:12] way to the truth and the life that was
[54:13] in their midst
[54:14] listen to this Jesus said I come in my
[54:17] father's name and you receive me not
[54:19] then the father put his own name which
[54:21] is Jesus in the son and he's the way
[54:24] he's the door he's the house he's where
[54:26] God chose to put his name listen he says
[54:29] God never put his name in me he never
[54:31] put it in the church he never put it in
[54:34] the Methodist Baptists or Catholic but
[54:36] he put it in Christ the anointed
[54:38] Emmanuel Emmanuel God With Us that was
[54:42] God's intention was to be with us not to
[54:45] just be God the Father above us but God
[54:47] with us so that he could transition from
[54:49] with us to in US but they had to
[54:51] recognize the with us before they could
[54:53] get to the in us if you miss the with us
[54:55] then you weren't going to have very much
[54:57] luck getting to the in us for that day
[54:59] he says and the name is in the word
[55:01] because he is the word amen what is he
[55:04] then now catch this he says the word
[55:07] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[55:10] name of God this is the key to this
[55:12] entire service the man the word
[55:14] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[55:18] name of God he says no wonder Flesh and
[55:21] Blood had not revealed this to you but
[55:23] who I am and Upon This Rock I'll build
[55:25] my place of worship and the gates of
[55:27] hell can't shake it down he says amen
[55:30] old Living Church of God Living Church
[55:33] of God stand in the Firm Foundation on
[55:35] Jesus Christ alone you can sing the song
[55:38] but if you're not on Christ the word
[55:40] you're a teetering faltering sin but
[55:43] Upon This Rock Christ he said my word
[55:47] so there was a group that accepted it
[55:49] and that's the one that was able to go
[55:51] all the way and then from there they
[55:53] could take it and they can pass it on to
[55:54] somebody else but they had to recognize
[55:56] the interpretation of the word of God
[55:58] for their day before it could come into
[56:01] something that was in them they had to
[56:03] catch it externally before it could come
[56:05] internally
[56:06] because the message always comes through
[56:07] what a prophet it always comes through a
[56:09] messenger it always comes as a first
[56:11] fruit it always comes as a wave offering
[56:15] but there was a group that couldn't
[56:17] receive it all and Jesus talks about why
[56:19] in John chapter 8 and he says Jesus said
[56:22] unto them if God were your father you
[56:25] would love me
[56:26] for I proceeded forth and come from God
[56:28] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[56:31] why do you not understand my speech even
[56:34] because you cannot hear my word
[56:37] listen to this church he says you are of
[56:40] your father the devil and the lusts of
[56:43] your father ye will do he was a murderer
[56:46] from the beginning and Abode not in the
[56:48] truth because there is no truth in him
[56:51] none
[56:53] no truth
[56:55] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[56:57] his own for he is a liar and the father
[57:01] of it I went to the Amplified for that
[57:03] portion that says he's a liar and the
[57:04] father of it and it says when he speaks
[57:06] of falsehood he speaks what is natural
[57:10] to him
[57:13] sinning is not a sin to a sinner it's
[57:17] natural
[57:18] brother Brown would even say it so far
[57:19] as a sinner does not sin
[57:21] why because he is sin it is his nature
[57:25] he says a pig doesn't do piggish things
[57:28] a pig is just a pig he says but a
[57:31] Believer is the one that has the the
[57:33] potential to sin because they are not
[57:35] sin and so it can be something that's
[57:36] out of them but he says a sinner isn't
[57:38] sinning they're just doing what's
[57:39] natural to them to us it's a sin to them
[57:41] it's completely natural
[57:43] but he says what he's when he speaks of
[57:45] falsehood he speaks what is natural to
[57:47] him for he is a liar himself and the
[57:50] father of lies and of all that is false
[57:53] and you're going to run into people and
[57:55] perhaps you already have that profess
[57:57] that they're a Christian maybe even
[57:59] within this message and they'll say that
[58:00] they're a Christian but when push comes
[58:03] to shove they'll live something
[58:04] different than what the word says
[58:07] they'll say what the word says because
[58:09] the priesthood said the word back to
[58:11] Christ day in and day out they always
[58:13] came with the word the word the word but
[58:15] when it came time to live it their life
[58:17] was different than his and he was the
[58:19] word interpreted he was the word
[58:21] manifested and they weren't so saying it
[58:24] is not enough but how you live it has to
[58:26] match up to the pattern amen that's what
[58:28] we're looking for so whatever it is
[58:30] remember their words what happens is if
[58:33] you look closely that the life doesn't
[58:35] match and if you listen closely the
[58:37] words they say don't quite match either
[58:39] and it's just a little twist here and
[58:42] it's a little twist there but if you've
[58:43] got discernment you'll catch there's
[58:45] something else going on in this person's
[58:47] life they don't have a word absolute
[58:49] something is blending something is
[58:51] compromising it and whether it's an
[58:53] external influence maybe it's a spirit
[58:55] whatever it might be maybe they're
[58:57] reading something maybe they're watching
[58:59] something it's something different and
[59:00] it's twisting it just that little bit
[59:02] and you say aha there's something wrong
[59:04] here
[59:05] because that's the word but it's not the
[59:07] full word it's not the balance of the
[59:09] word
[59:10] sometimes they're just unconverted and
[59:12] they need the new Earth and it's that
[59:13] simple listen we're raised in the
[59:15] message most of us that doesn't make you
[59:17] right until you get the Holy Ghost
[59:19] you're unconverted and so you're going
[59:21] to be a little bit twisted
[59:22] because you're not in Christ yet
[59:25] you got to get in Christ to get it so
[59:27] I've said this myself over the pope of
[59:29] many times use me as an example I sat
[59:31] and I listened and I understood and and
[59:33] with with the teaching that brother
[59:35] Gerald gave us and brother Mark gave us
[59:36] in Sunday school I felt I was very well
[59:39] qualified to discuss Doctrine
[59:41] but my perception of the life of a
[59:44] Christian was completely skewed because
[59:46] I was not a Christian
[59:47] I didn't have a new birth I didn't have
[59:49] the Holy Ghost I had all of the letter
[59:52] and none of the life and so that Twisted
[59:54] the way I looked at things and that's
[59:56] the same thing you'll see with people if
[59:57] they're unconverted There's Hope for
[59:59] them but that doesn't mean they're there
[1:00:01] yet
[1:00:02] and then some people are just like the
[1:00:03] priesthood they're just religious like
[1:00:05] the word in Jesus day and they can speak
[1:00:07] the literal words but they can't live
[1:00:09] the interpretation of the word for their
[1:00:11] day and that makes them a liar
[1:00:14] they don't even realize they're lying
[1:00:17] because what it's natural to them
[1:00:19] they're under a religious spirit just as
[1:00:22] the priesthood was Jesus said you are of
[1:00:24] your father the devil and they're
[1:00:26] priests
[1:00:28] they're they're the the arguably the
[1:00:30] most holy people the best according to
[1:00:32] the law but he says you've completely
[1:00:34] missed it and you can't even accept the
[1:00:36] word for your day
[1:00:38] and he says that makes you a liar
[1:00:39] because you say one thing but you do
[1:00:40] another
[1:00:41] that's what makes you a liar in Mark 13
[1:00:45] it says for many shall come in my name
[1:00:48] he says I come in my father's name he
[1:00:49] says there's going to be many coming in
[1:00:51] my name saying I am Christ and shall
[1:00:55] deceive many and I don't have this in my
[1:00:57] slides but I wrote it down here in
[1:00:59] Matthew 7 22. remember Jesus said many
[1:01:01] will say in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:01:04] not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[1:01:08] name cast out devils and in thy name
[1:01:10] done many wonderful works and he says
[1:01:12] and I will say unto them I never knew
[1:01:15] you'd depart from me ye that work
[1:01:16] iniquity you knew what to do and you
[1:01:18] didn't do it but you did a bunch of
[1:01:20] other things in my name and you went
[1:01:22] around and you said I am Christ I am a
[1:01:25] Christian I'm coming in Jesus name and
[1:01:28] he says and I was never a part of it
[1:01:30] he didn't say they didn't do the works
[1:01:31] he said I wasn't a part of it
[1:01:35] they couldn't have been of him and that
[1:01:37] means there's only one other father that
[1:01:38] they can have and that's Satan that's a
[1:01:40] hard line that's a hard line to draw on
[1:01:42] the sand but he says because I wasn't a
[1:01:44] part of it there's only one other
[1:01:45] influence that can be and that is
[1:01:47] satanic it's not up to us to judge a
[1:01:49] person's Eternal destination listen if
[1:01:52] it was up to us and we looked at where
[1:01:53] people are at here today then Paul the
[1:01:56] Apostle would have been he would have
[1:01:58] been in the burning fires of hell as
[1:01:59] Saul wouldn't he he'd have never made it
[1:02:02] Peter after he denied Christ we'd have
[1:02:04] said that said Peter you had three
[1:02:05] opportunities and you you messed it up
[1:02:07] you're just not a real believer look at
[1:02:10] Jacob the shyster the deceiver the
[1:02:12] cheater the liar all these different
[1:02:13] things we'd have put him out and yet he
[1:02:15] was a son he was a child of God so it's
[1:02:17] not for us to put him out amen but we
[1:02:19] are supposed to be able to judge whether
[1:02:21] somebody is speaking the truth
[1:02:22] because we've been given a word we've
[1:02:24] been given a message that tells us what
[1:02:25] that truth is not just in word but in
[1:02:28] life as well
[1:02:29] because the life has to follow the word
[1:02:32] the life has to follow the word every
[1:02:34] single time may not all that say Christ
[1:02:36] Our Christ and not all that say
[1:02:38] Christian or Christian not all that say
[1:02:39] message believer our message believer
[1:02:41] right we've got to have discernment in
[1:02:43] these things Hebrews 5 14 says but
[1:02:45] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[1:02:47] of full age even those who by what
[1:02:50] reason of use have their senses
[1:02:53] exercised to discern both good and evil
[1:02:55] you can't have discernment up front it's
[1:02:58] got to be exercised in other words what
[1:03:00] you've got to do is you've got to say
[1:03:02] this is what I believe is correct in
[1:03:03] this situation this is what I believe is
[1:03:05] correct about this person this is what I
[1:03:07] believe is correct about what's going on
[1:03:09] and then you've got to go and you've got
[1:03:11] to check it later and say was I right
[1:03:14] don't just Breeze over it I was wrong no
[1:03:17] God will find out why you were wrong
[1:03:19] listen I work with the deacons and we
[1:03:21] deal with situations and what happens
[1:03:23] afterwards we sit down we have a
[1:03:25] discussion we say did we get it right or
[1:03:26] did we not get it right and if we didn't
[1:03:28] get it right why didn't we get it right
[1:03:30] what did we do what did we mess up so
[1:03:32] that we don't do it the next time why
[1:03:33] we're exercising our discernment to
[1:03:37] learn and grow as we go
[1:03:39] because you don't start at the top you
[1:03:41] don't start with muscular discernment
[1:03:43] you got to build your way into it and
[1:03:45] the Holy Spirit has to be working and
[1:03:46] you've got to learn what's the Holy
[1:03:47] Spirit and what's my opinion and what's
[1:03:50] my memory and these different things
[1:03:53] so he's saying what you can't just say
[1:03:55] because somebody says I am this that
[1:03:57] they are that you've got to judge them
[1:03:58] according to the word and you've got to
[1:04:00] have discernment that's been exercised
[1:04:02] and proven
[1:04:03] ever been caught out by surprise by a
[1:04:05] professing Christian or professing
[1:04:07] message believer
[1:04:08] I remember when I was back in a
[1:04:10] different church and and when believe
[1:04:13] the sign came we had just a bunch of
[1:04:15] them walk out we lost half the deacons
[1:04:17] we lost the associate pastor we lost one
[1:04:19] of the song leaders and just in a moment
[1:04:21] they just walked away and some of them
[1:04:23] been serving the lord for 20 30 35 years
[1:04:26] and just in a moment they walked away
[1:04:28] and what we realized then was that it
[1:04:30] was not life it was a lifestyle
[1:04:33] it's easy to live a lifestyle that is
[1:04:35] Christian
[1:04:36] because there are benefits to a
[1:04:38] Christian lifestyle
[1:04:39] it's wonderful to live by the word of
[1:04:41] God even if it's not life to you because
[1:04:43] there are so many benefits to this
[1:04:45] you'll have a better life if you live by
[1:04:47] this regardless of whether or not you
[1:04:48] have the Holy Ghost
[1:04:49] it's a better way of life but it's not
[1:04:51] life
[1:04:52] you need the life to make it live and so
[1:04:55] what you realize very quickly is that
[1:04:57] those people did not have life and
[1:04:58] that's when they then later on you know
[1:05:00] a year out and they say you know I
[1:05:02] always wanted a tattoo
[1:05:04] even while they're in the message I
[1:05:05] always wanted a tattoo I always wanted
[1:05:07] to do this I always wanted to do that
[1:05:08] and you realize well that really wasn't
[1:05:10] the holy spirit in them then and you
[1:05:13] realize it was just a lifestyle they
[1:05:14] were raised in it but they did not have
[1:05:16] it amen
[1:05:18] but here's the thing some of them
[1:05:20] weren't a surprise
[1:05:21] and as a deacon I've learned to to
[1:05:23] follow people and and in this case I've
[1:05:26] said this many times over the pulpit and
[1:05:27] this goes back decades now social media
[1:05:29] gives us deacons and Ministry great
[1:05:32] insight into what's going on in people's
[1:05:33] lives and I would tell my wife I'd say
[1:05:35] this person's on the way out this
[1:05:37] person's on the way out and this
[1:05:38] person's on the way why because of what
[1:05:40] they liked what they repeated what they
[1:05:42] shared and what they commented on it
[1:05:43] showed me what they were feeding on
[1:05:45] and they didn't have to say a word to me
[1:05:47] in church because I could see what the
[1:05:48] pattern was there but then when you talk
[1:05:50] to them in church and you go to their
[1:05:52] home for fellowship and they'd say these
[1:05:54] little things and you'd catch something
[1:05:55] you'd say that's a bit odd
[1:05:57] or you'd say and this is going to sound
[1:05:59] self-righteous but
[1:06:00] I wouldn't even think to go down that
[1:06:02] road
[1:06:03] or I wouldn't even think to bring that
[1:06:04] into my home and they'd start saying
[1:06:06] well I like this or I like that and no
[1:06:07] it's no harm this and you start say whoa
[1:06:09] there's something bigger going on here
[1:06:11] and pretty soon what happened is they
[1:06:13] walked away and and and literally within
[1:06:15] the next year or two of those people
[1:06:16] that left they went into atheism they
[1:06:19] went into divorce they went into
[1:06:20] becoming a drunk they went into single
[1:06:22] pregnancy and they went into being alone
[1:06:24] with marriages destroyed
[1:06:26] virtually everyone I know had their
[1:06:29] lives destroyed within three years
[1:06:31] why because they were living a lifestyle
[1:06:33] without the life
[1:06:36] sometimes we get caught in the middle of
[1:06:37] things and we've got to have discernment
[1:06:39] and we've got to try and make a decision
[1:06:40] who's right and who's wrong
[1:06:42] you know how you do it
[1:06:44] first you pray
[1:06:46] you pray
[1:06:48] second you go to the word
[1:06:50] the full word
[1:06:52] all the word and number three look at
[1:06:55] the long-term fruits that you can see
[1:06:57] because the fruits of the past will be
[1:06:59] the fruits of the future
[1:07:00] what they've had before they'll have in
[1:07:02] the future and if you look at what has
[1:07:03] been the pattern along you'll usually
[1:07:05] see that someone is usually right and
[1:07:07] somebody's usually wrong
[1:07:09] it's very simple to do it that way right
[1:07:11] we don't have to go in and try and
[1:07:13] discern this situation sometimes you
[1:07:15] just have to discern the people and
[1:07:16] that'll usually tell you who's right and
[1:07:18] who's wrong in these things
[1:07:20] but there's always been two groups and
[1:07:22] we're at a Harvest Time and this is the
[1:07:24] this is the heart this is where the
[1:07:25] fruits are known
[1:07:26] good or bad this is where it's coming
[1:07:28] out amen then this is where we're going
[1:07:29] to find out remember brother Brown says
[1:07:31] you're going to be surprised who made it
[1:07:33] and you're also going to be surprised
[1:07:34] who didn't make it
[1:07:36] but this is a shaking time but it's a
[1:07:38] proving time and it's a time where
[1:07:40] everybody gets to see him we're going to
[1:07:41] be surprised if we haven't already by
[1:07:43] the fruits that come out of some of our
[1:07:44] lives I trust we're going to be
[1:07:46] surprised in a good way amen Lord help
[1:07:49] us to produce the good fruit amen as
[1:07:51] Paul said not as if I have attained
[1:07:53] already amen but trusting that that what
[1:07:55] he's done already he'll continue amen
[1:07:57] he'll be faithful to complete it
[1:07:59] Jesus would say or this is again Jesus
[1:08:02] continuing then said the Jews unto him
[1:08:04] he says now we know that thou Hast the
[1:08:07] devil because after this you know he
[1:08:08] said you're of your father the devil and
[1:08:09] they went back and Abraham's our father
[1:08:11] and all these different things
[1:08:13] and he said before Abraham was I am and
[1:08:15] he comes into this but he says now we
[1:08:17] know that thou Hast the devil Abraham is
[1:08:19] dead and the prophets and thou says if a
[1:08:22] man keep my saying he shall never taste
[1:08:24] of death are thou greater than our
[1:08:26] Father Abraham which is dead and the
[1:08:28] prophets are dead who make us thou
[1:08:29] thyself Jesus answered if I honor myself
[1:08:33] my honor is nothing
[1:08:36] the biggest sign of somebody that needs
[1:08:38] a new birth is that they can tell you
[1:08:39] everything great about them and nobody
[1:08:41] else can
[1:08:43] the priesthood had their lineage they
[1:08:45] had the proof of their lineage they have
[1:08:47] proof of their faithfulness to the law
[1:08:48] they have proof of this they have proof
[1:08:50] of that and Jesus said you're everyone
[1:08:51] dead just like the prophets the fathers
[1:08:53] are every one of them he says you're
[1:08:54] dead you're white and sepulchers
[1:08:56] but he says if I honor myself my honor
[1:08:58] is nothing
[1:09:00] my reputation can't come for me it has
[1:09:02] to come from you
[1:09:03] your reputation has to come from the
[1:09:05] people next to you not of yourself
[1:09:07] he says it is my father that honoreth me
[1:09:11] so we don't pat ourselves on the back
[1:09:12] it's got to come from the father he says
[1:09:14] of whom you say that he is your god yet
[1:09:16] ye have not known him
[1:09:19] but I know him and if I should say I
[1:09:21] know him not I shall be a liar like unto
[1:09:23] you
[1:09:24] Jesus was a hard preacher at times he
[1:09:27] says if I said I didn't know God I'd be
[1:09:29] a liar just like you are
[1:09:32] but I know him and I keep his saying
[1:09:34] he's just twisting the knife
[1:09:36] he's just calling them out and you'll
[1:09:38] find in scriptures in different portions
[1:09:39] they walk away and they are so angry
[1:09:42] this is when they want to kill him
[1:09:43] because he has laid bare who they are
[1:09:46] he's made completely obvious who they
[1:09:48] are and that's when they wanted to kill
[1:09:50] him not with the signs and wonders when
[1:09:52] he showed them who they really were
[1:09:53] that's when they started to try and kill
[1:09:55] him and they started with his reputation
[1:09:57] and then they finished with his body
[1:09:59] he says your father Abraham rejoiced to
[1:10:02] see my day and he saw it and was glad
[1:10:05] then said the Jews unto him thou are not
[1:10:07] yet 50 years old and hast thou seen
[1:10:09] Abraham and Jesus said unto them verily
[1:10:12] verily I say unto you before Abraham was
[1:10:15] I am now if we look at what Jesus is
[1:10:17] talking about in scripture and really
[1:10:19] we're giving the big picture view of who
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ is Jesus said Abraham was
[1:10:23] glad to see me in his in my day in his
[1:10:28] life
[1:10:29] do you know there's a day of the Lord
[1:10:30] for each one of us
[1:10:32] there's a day of the Lord where he comes
[1:10:34] to each one of us personally and
[1:10:35] directly in our lives and he says
[1:10:37] Abraham was glad for it not everyone's
[1:10:39] glad before because if they don't
[1:10:41] recognize her they turn it down it's
[1:10:42] judgment but Abraham was glad because it
[1:10:44] meant something to him but when did
[1:10:46] Abraham see him Abraham saw him in
[1:10:48] Melchizedek
[1:10:50] but the the day that he's talking about
[1:10:52] in my day when Abraham was glad was when
[1:10:54] Elohim stepped down and it was Elohim
[1:10:57] because remember Abraham called him Lord
[1:10:59] he stepped down into a body and he
[1:11:02] brought two Messengers with him and he
[1:11:03] sat down under a tree and he ate a steak
[1:11:05] and he and he and he drank and and he
[1:11:07] had a meal with Abraham and then he told
[1:11:09] Abraham he says I'm about I personal
[1:11:12] pronoun pronoun am about to bring the
[1:11:15] promise to pass in your life and about
[1:11:17] the time is it supposed to happen in the
[1:11:18] cycle of a woman Sarah's going to have a
[1:11:21] baby Abraham was glad why because God
[1:11:23] came down and said the promise is about
[1:11:25] to be fulfilled that's why Abraham was
[1:11:27] glad there was something going on in his
[1:11:29] life but God didn't have a reveal name
[1:11:31] back then he had titles and he had
[1:11:32] expressions and these different things
[1:11:34] but he didn't have a revealed name and
[1:11:36] if we go back to the time of Moses
[1:11:38] and I'm just teaching here tonight it
[1:11:40] says that Moses said unto God behold
[1:11:42] when I came under when I come unto the
[1:11:44] children of Israel and shall say unto
[1:11:46] them this is his burning bush experience
[1:11:47] the god of your fathers has sent me unto
[1:11:50] you and they shall say to me what is his
[1:11:52] name what shall I say unto them and God
[1:11:54] said unto Moses I am that I am and he
[1:11:58] said thus shalt thou say unto the
[1:12:00] children of Israel I am has sent me unto
[1:12:03] you and God said moreover under Moses
[1:12:06] Thou shalt thus say unto the children of
[1:12:07] Israel the Lord God of your fathers the
[1:12:09] god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god
[1:12:11] of Jacob has sent me unto you this is my
[1:12:15] name forever what I am and this is my
[1:12:19] Memorial unto all generations what a
[1:12:21] name church I am the ever-present ever
[1:12:24] living God not just I was and not just I
[1:12:28] will be but I'm here right now that's
[1:12:30] how God wants to be identified is here
[1:12:32] and now
[1:12:33] that's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] that's the mystery of the revealing of
[1:12:37] Christ is that it is not just yesterday
[1:12:39] and it's not just forever but it is
[1:12:41] today right now and this is the name he
[1:12:44] said is forever is the I am the I am you
[1:12:48] can count on this name amen if I could
[1:12:50] put it that way but where was God in
[1:12:52] this situation God was in a Celestial
[1:12:54] body he was in a a pillar of fire and he
[1:12:56] was hiding in a bush and he was speaking
[1:12:58] and he was seen but he wasn't being
[1:13:00] manifested
[1:13:03] he was in existence but he wasn't in
[1:13:05] manifestation and God was wanting to
[1:13:08] drop down now into manifestation and he
[1:13:10] had to get a prophet to do this thing
[1:13:12] God was talking to Moses why because God
[1:13:15] was trying to come into the physical
[1:13:16] world
[1:13:17] God was trying to step down from the
[1:13:19] heavenlies into react into a a a a a a
[1:13:22] an action into a situation with the with
[1:13:26] his family
[1:13:27] and he continues he said and the Lord
[1:13:29] said I have surely seen the Affliction
[1:13:31] of my people which are in Egypt and have
[1:13:34] heard their Cry by reason of their task
[1:13:35] Masters for I know their sorrows for I
[1:13:38] am come down personal pronoun I am come
[1:13:41] down to deliver them out of the hand of
[1:13:44] the Egyptians so God's saying I've come
[1:13:46] down now and I'm here and it's been 400
[1:13:48] plus years but I'm down now to bring the
[1:13:51] promise to pass which I said unto them
[1:13:53] and where did that I am reside for the
[1:13:56] next 40 odd years
[1:13:58] with Moses
[1:13:59] he was with Moses the entire time
[1:14:01] remember the people put him out and the
[1:14:03] people put him away but he was always
[1:14:05] right there with my with Moses so
[1:14:07] remember where we read that brother
[1:14:09] Brahm said the word interpreted is the
[1:14:12] manifestation of the name of God
[1:14:14] so when God interprets his word when God
[1:14:17] vindicates his word when God brings his
[1:14:19] word to pass that is the manifestation
[1:14:21] of his word for that day that is the
[1:14:24] manifestation of his name for that day
[1:14:27] so what was Moses going down as he was
[1:14:30] walking into Egypt he was the
[1:14:31] manifestation of I am for that day what
[1:14:35] was it what was the name that he was
[1:14:37] manifesting I am come down to deliver
[1:14:39] thee that was the name that Moses was
[1:14:42] coming in he was coming in the name of I
[1:14:45] am come down to deliver and how do we
[1:14:46] know because he came down and he
[1:14:47] delivered them that was Christ the word
[1:14:50] right there
[1:14:51] Moses was literally the word for his day
[1:14:53] that was Jesus Christ being revealed
[1:14:56] that was God being revealed amen but it
[1:14:58] was only for a season but for That
[1:15:00] season Moses was the word made flesh
[1:15:03] brother Branham says this he says Noah
[1:15:05] was the Vindicated word for his day
[1:15:09] do you believe that and then he says
[1:15:11] well his message won't work today
[1:15:14] Moses was the Vindicated word of his day
[1:15:16] do you believe that it won't work for
[1:15:18] now John was the Vindicated word you
[1:15:20] believe that it wouldn't work in the
[1:15:22] days of Jesus certainly not he said the
[1:15:24] law and the prophets were until John and
[1:15:26] since then the Kingdom of Heaven the
[1:15:28] apostles them who set forth the Bible
[1:15:30] here come Luther out in Reformation his
[1:15:32] words and his church won't work today
[1:15:34] Wesley's won't Pentecost won't but it
[1:15:37] worked in their day why because it was
[1:15:39] the word for their day and that made it
[1:15:42] effective
[1:15:44] but today what is it they caught the
[1:15:46] inspiration of the word for their day
[1:15:48] God came down and Vindicated it in them
[1:15:51] personally and they lived it out and
[1:15:54] that was the revealing of God for that
[1:15:55] age and they didn't just capture it and
[1:15:57] they didn't just hear it and they
[1:15:58] weren't just inspired but they became
[1:16:00] the word for their day brother Bradham
[1:16:03] said that's why you can't separate the
[1:16:04] messenger from his message because then
[1:16:06] we'll get into this he's got to receive
[1:16:09] it and then he's got to become it to
[1:16:11] deliver to the people so that they'll
[1:16:12] have something to believe not just words
[1:16:14] but they'll see a life change they'll
[1:16:16] see a life manifested that's why they're
[1:16:18] the first fruit that's why they're the
[1:16:19] wave offering amen they didn't just have
[1:16:21] it but they became it it wasn't just
[1:16:23] something they could carry but it was
[1:16:24] the ungrafted word that was in their
[1:16:26] hearts and in their lives amen we have
[1:16:29] to come to the same place where we don't
[1:16:30] just say Amen but we say let it be so be
[1:16:34] it let it be in my life Lord let this
[1:16:36] word live in me don't let me just
[1:16:38] acknowledge it with intellect in mind
[1:16:39] but let me capture it inside of me and
[1:16:42] let it come out
[1:16:43] that's what we're looking for is the
[1:16:44] what the manifested word for our day
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:48] what is it the manifestation of the name
[1:16:50] is God of God is in the doing not just
[1:16:53] the receiving
[1:16:54] don't stop at receiving because if you
[1:16:56] truly receive you'll do
[1:16:58] because if you truly hear you'll be a
[1:17:00] doer of the word and not a hearer only
[1:17:01] if someone were to ask you and Moses day
[1:17:04] and say where is God they'd say he's
[1:17:06] right there
[1:17:07] they point to Moses remember we talked
[1:17:09] about he had the The Shining face and
[1:17:11] these different things he'd been in the
[1:17:12] presence of God so much and when Moses
[1:17:14] said something it happened remember
[1:17:16] brother Brown talked about him we've
[1:17:17] shared the courts where he says when you
[1:17:19] say something something happens when
[1:17:21] Moses said something it happened
[1:17:23] why because he was the manifested word
[1:17:25] for his day and they'd point to Moses
[1:17:27] and then when it was Joshua's day they
[1:17:29] point to Joshua and they'd say that's
[1:17:30] where God is right now God is in that
[1:17:33] man God is manifested in that one why
[1:17:36] because God was working in them to
[1:17:38] produce the promised word for their day
[1:17:41] that's how they knew that God was with
[1:17:43] them was they could see the word coming
[1:17:44] to life in that person's life
[1:17:47] we've got to see the same thing
[1:17:48] happening today it can't just be God
[1:17:49] With Us it's got to be God in us very
[1:17:52] familiar scripture in first John he says
[1:17:54] ye are of God
[1:17:56] do you realize where you come from this
[1:17:58] more this evening church you are of God
[1:18:00] you come from God he says and little
[1:18:03] children and have overcome them because
[1:18:05] greater is he that is in you in you than
[1:18:09] he that is in the world what is it it's
[1:18:10] God in us it's Christ in us the hope of
[1:18:13] glory as we read last service God has to
[1:18:15] be in us not just by us not just with us
[1:18:17] but in us because that's the victory
[1:18:19] that we need more than anything is
[1:18:21] victory over self and that means he's
[1:18:23] got to be king and he's got to be Lord
[1:18:24] not just savior he's got to be in us
[1:18:26] working from the inside out where we can
[1:18:28] say he is me and I am him we are the
[1:18:30] same thing that's the invisible Union of
[1:18:32] the Bride In Christ we're talking about
[1:18:34] names today and I want to tie in this
[1:18:37] thought
[1:18:38] of the promise being tied to a name
[1:18:40] change of the word of God being tied to
[1:18:43] a name change and we're looking to build
[1:18:44] a big picture before we really start to
[1:18:46] dig into to our portion on this and I'm
[1:18:48] going to go straight to the end of the
[1:18:49] Bible in Revelation it says he that hath
[1:18:52] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:18:53] saith unto the churches to him that
[1:18:56] overcometh will I give to Eid of the
[1:18:58] Hidden Manna and will give him a white
[1:19:00] stone and in the stone a new name
[1:19:02] written which no man knoweth saving he
[1:19:05] that receiveth it
[1:19:09] brother Braham says this he says it was
[1:19:11] a white stone meaning not his own
[1:19:13] righteousness but God's Own
[1:19:15] righteousness and in this Stone was a
[1:19:17] name a name that no one knew but the one
[1:19:19] who received it himself he says he knew
[1:19:22] it but no one else could know it but him
[1:19:26] Now watch how he tells us what this
[1:19:27] means he says so when you hear these
[1:19:29] guys flatter you telling theirs they're
[1:19:31] John their Paul their Mary they're this
[1:19:33] that or the other don't you believe it
[1:19:35] because if it was he'd never say nothing
[1:19:37] about it in other words if you're a big
[1:19:40] shot in God's kingdom if you're one of
[1:19:41] the the called Messengers or if you're
[1:19:43] this or that or you have a great gift he
[1:19:45] says you won't go around talking about
[1:19:47] it because it's not you in the first
[1:19:49] place
[1:19:50] he says it's a name it's a recognition
[1:19:52] that is for you and you alone and you
[1:19:54] don't go around spreading it around he
[1:19:57] says don't you believe it because if
[1:19:58] they were he never say nothing about it
[1:20:00] see that's right he has to keep it to
[1:20:02] himself he knew no one knew but he
[1:20:04] himself but he knew why because every
[1:20:08] perfect Overcomer receives a new name in
[1:20:11] that way
[1:20:13] everyone so what's he saying he's saying
[1:20:15] the messenger because he's talking in
[1:20:17] the church ages there's a messenger at
[1:20:18] each one and he says in this church age
[1:20:20] he says that man is going to realize who
[1:20:23] he is
[1:20:24] but he can't go tell everyone what he is
[1:20:28] why because they've got to receive it by
[1:20:30] revelation
[1:20:31] they've got to understand what's going
[1:20:32] on
[1:20:33] they've got to place them in the
[1:20:35] scripture and figure out what's going on
[1:20:36] so they can receive the word for their
[1:20:38] day he says he can't just go around and
[1:20:40] tell everyone who he is and you'll see
[1:20:41] Jesus didn't do it only in a very few
[1:20:43] instances was he obvious about what he
[1:20:45] said and it was usually to his disciples
[1:20:47] and it was only at the very end where
[1:20:49] they said art thou the Christ and he
[1:20:51] said thou Hast said it you said it he
[1:20:53] said didn't say I'm not saying he's
[1:20:54] saying you're right but I'm not going to
[1:20:56] say it but you said it and I'll confirm
[1:20:57] that what you said was right
[1:20:59] because they're not going around making
[1:21:00] a name for themselves because it isn't
[1:21:02] about them
[1:21:04] it's about the name that they're
[1:21:05] revealing which is Christ the word
[1:21:07] now righteousness he says here it's
[1:21:09] God's Own righteousness righteousness is
[1:21:10] the works of God
[1:21:12] and the works of God is the will of God
[1:21:14] and the will of God is the word of God
[1:21:16] for you in your day
[1:21:18] can you follow that through the works of
[1:21:19] God is the will of God which is the word
[1:21:21] of you so if you do the will of God you
[1:21:23] receive righteousness because
[1:21:24] righteousness means to do good
[1:21:26] and we do lots of good we've read the
[1:21:28] scripture there in in Matthew 7 where it
[1:21:30] says that they'll come in that day and
[1:21:31] say do we not do many wonderful Works in
[1:21:32] their name and all these thy name and
[1:21:34] all these things and they did what they
[1:21:35] thought were good works but it wasn't
[1:21:37] the will of God so therefore it wasn't
[1:21:39] good
[1:21:40] and that's where the world gets messed
[1:21:42] up today is because they say well and I
[1:21:44] talked about I think about the the car
[1:21:46] dealer I spoke with a little while ago
[1:21:48] and he says well I think I've done good
[1:21:50] doesn't matter what you think
[1:21:52] good is determined by that which is good
[1:21:54] and there's only one good Jesus said and
[1:21:55] that's God
[1:21:56] so if God says it's good it's good and
[1:21:58] otherwise it's not good it's not even
[1:21:59] acceptable it's it's filthy rags it's
[1:22:02] vomit it's lukewarm it's it's tainted by
[1:22:05] your preference by your desire for
[1:22:07] something yourself you've got yourself
[1:22:09] injected into it so God doesn't do it
[1:22:10] but our idea of good is never correct
[1:22:12] and that's why we have to go to the word
[1:22:14] and that's why we have to find the will
[1:22:15] of God for our age we said before Noah
[1:22:18] was righteous because he did what God
[1:22:19] Said remember Noah was not a
[1:22:21] particularly righteous man afterwards
[1:22:23] was he
[1:22:24] no I had all sorts of Hang-Ups Abraham
[1:22:27] all had all sorts of Hang-Ups lots of
[1:22:29] these Great Men David had Hang-Ups but
[1:22:31] they did the will of God and it was
[1:22:33] accounted to them for righteousness
[1:22:34] because they did what he said and God
[1:22:36] didn't look at the rest that was under
[1:22:38] the blood of the Lambs and Bulls and
[1:22:40] these different things but he looked at
[1:22:41] what they did was right and he says and
[1:22:42] the scripture says that it was what it
[1:22:44] was accredited to them for righteousness
[1:22:47] why because they did what God told them
[1:22:48] to do
[1:22:49] so to be righteous today I can't go and
[1:22:52] do Noah's work
[1:22:53] it's the word what Noah did is in the
[1:22:56] word it's the word of God but it's not
[1:22:57] the word of God for today so if I go out
[1:22:59] and I build an ark and I try and bring
[1:23:01] in a bunch of animals I'm doing the word
[1:23:03] but it's not righteousness because it's
[1:23:04] not the word for my day
[1:23:06] that's why we needed a prophet Messenger
[1:23:07] to come and tell us here's the word for
[1:23:09] your day here's what you're supposed to
[1:23:10] be focused on here's what you're
[1:23:12] supposed to be doing so to be righteous
[1:23:13] today I have to do the will of God which
[1:23:16] is the word of God for today and that's
[1:23:18] where righteousness is and that's why
[1:23:20] he's given us it says he's given us his
[1:23:21] righteousness what did he do he came and
[1:23:23] gave us our his word he gave us his word
[1:23:25] for our day and said this is what's
[1:23:27] going to get you over the line this is
[1:23:28] what's going to clothe you this is
[1:23:30] what's going to cover you is my word and
[1:23:32] as long as you've got that then that's
[1:23:33] going to be okay
[1:23:35] but brother Branham says every perfect
[1:23:37] Overcomer receives a new name in that
[1:23:40] way so the question is how do we get a
[1:23:41] new name
[1:23:43] where do we find it what's the name
[1:23:45] how's it given to you
[1:23:47] the clue is in the scripture we just
[1:23:48] read back here in Revelation 2 it says a
[1:23:51] new state a stone with a new name was
[1:23:52] written and we look in that
[1:23:55] and God is identifying here the man for
[1:23:58] that church age just like he did Moses
[1:24:00] and Samuel and all these great prophets
[1:24:01] and remember brother Brown says you get
[1:24:03] all through the church ages you get all
[1:24:05] the benefits of everyone before you
[1:24:07] you get all of it
[1:24:09] he says that's available as you move
[1:24:11] past it each one gets what's behind them
[1:24:13] plus what is allocated for their age as
[1:24:15] well but he's identifying that man and
[1:24:17] that that angel messenger just like he
[1:24:19] did Moses and Samuel and all those great
[1:24:21] prophets and he's putting that name in
[1:24:23] that man and what is his name his name
[1:24:25] is the word it's his first identified
[1:24:27] name is the word in the beginning was
[1:24:29] the word the word was with God and the
[1:24:30] Word was God remember that's his first
[1:24:32] name but that man is not God but he
[1:24:35] speaks as God because he's catching what
[1:24:36] the holy spirit says and he's bringing
[1:24:38] What God Says to the people
[1:24:41] and that's where God's name is is in the
[1:24:43] man that brings his word he's a
[1:24:45] messenger not an author
[1:24:47] catch that he's a messenger not an
[1:24:49] author he's a microphone not a speaker
[1:24:51] it's the Holy Spirit speaking he's just
[1:24:53] the microphone amen he comes under
[1:24:55] Authority with authority
[1:24:58] he comes under Authority with authority
[1:25:00] now God knows who that man is and then
[1:25:02] he lets him know who he is he lets them
[1:25:04] know his day he lets him know his
[1:25:06] message and then he sends him out there
[1:25:07] amen we read in the Book of Revelation
[1:25:09] for each Church age where it says to him
[1:25:11] that overcometh
[1:25:13] doesn't say to them
[1:25:14] it says to him singular to one person
[1:25:18] that overcomes he says I'm going to go
[1:25:20] and I'm going to give him all these
[1:25:21] overcoming rewards but yet you'll hear
[1:25:24] me preach and every other preacher that
[1:25:25] knows his Bible and they'll say but we
[1:25:27] get all the same thing and brother
[1:25:29] Branham would say this and I don't have
[1:25:30] the quote here but it was in my notes
[1:25:32] and when he read this this the scripture
[1:25:34] we just read he said he says he noticed
[1:25:36] he says him singular he says this reward
[1:25:40] is only to the messenger for that age
[1:25:44] and yet I'm up here like I said in every
[1:25:46] other minister we know is sitting there
[1:25:48] and saying that we all get the reward
[1:25:51] but the scripture says it's only to him
[1:25:53] it's only to the angel messenger
[1:25:56] what is it
[1:25:57] see he has to overcome first
[1:26:01] that's the beauty of what we saw in the
[1:26:02] in the in the life of the of our Prophet
[1:26:05] William Branham is that we saw God
[1:26:07] moving and creating that vessel
[1:26:11] for adoption
[1:26:13] we literally saw the development of a
[1:26:15] prophet in a way that we've never been
[1:26:17] able to see through time
[1:26:19] we saw insights he told us all sorts of
[1:26:21] personal things he showed us where he
[1:26:23] messed up he showed us where he did
[1:26:24] right he showed us how not to make
[1:26:26] mistakes he did all these things and he
[1:26:28] had to literally remember he fought for
[1:26:30] so long he had these visions and these
[1:26:31] different things and he fought for so
[1:26:33] long and he tried to get away from it
[1:26:34] and he tried to push it away and he had
[1:26:36] all these preachers saying get away from
[1:26:38] it it's not of God it's satanic and he
[1:26:40] had to fight his way through it until he
[1:26:42] could come to the place in the scripture
[1:26:44] where he recognized what that gift was
[1:26:46] and then he moved with that gift and
[1:26:48] then as he moved with that gift and he
[1:26:50] went from first pull to Second pole and
[1:26:52] then the angel comes down he tells him
[1:26:53] as Moses had the different signs you're
[1:26:55] going to have the two signs and I send
[1:26:56] you as a messenger and he had to
[1:26:58] literally believe that message he had to
[1:27:01] believe what the Holy Spirit was saying
[1:27:02] to him and then he had to let it take
[1:27:04] effect in his life so that when he went
[1:27:06] and he preached it he was living it not
[1:27:08] just talking it
[1:27:10] and that was literally God revealed in
[1:27:12] this age that's why brother Brown would
[1:27:14] say those that say I'm God are closer to
[1:27:16] the truth than those that say I'm not
[1:27:18] but he would say I am a son of man which
[1:27:21] is a Ministry
[1:27:22] revealing the son of man which is Christ
[1:27:25] the word
[1:27:27] but it was Christ revealing himself
[1:27:29] through that man amen and that what they
[1:27:31] were trying to do was get the holy the
[1:27:33] people to hear what the Holy Spirit was
[1:27:34] saying to the church age
[1:27:37] that's why we believe in a prophet today
[1:27:38] amen
[1:27:40] we're Gentiles we're not Jews and yet we
[1:27:42] believe in a prophet because we're in a
[1:27:44] gentile dispensation of seven Church
[1:27:45] ages and he said I'm going to send
[1:27:47] Messengers to every Church age and
[1:27:49] that's the only one one
[1:27:52] that's our only opportunity to overcome
[1:27:54] is to hear what the holy spirit said to
[1:27:56] that man otherwise you are lost
[1:28:00] why because you've got to catch the word
[1:28:01] for your day you've got to understand
[1:28:03] what the revealing of the word is you've
[1:28:05] got to understand what the
[1:28:06] interpretation is the revealing of God
[1:28:08] for your day and it was in a man named
[1:28:10] William Branham not just for him but for
[1:28:12] the rest of us because it's got to go
[1:28:14] from him to us
[1:28:15] remember what was he doing we had to
[1:28:17] have a prophet see in the first church
[1:28:19] age message or the church age First
[1:28:21] Church age messenger had to be a prophet
[1:28:23] because he was what he was revealing the
[1:28:26] Grace Covenant
[1:28:27] that was we needed a prophet for that to
[1:28:29] bring the word and afterwards it was
[1:28:31] falling away from it and then as we come
[1:28:33] back we need a prophet to restore the
[1:28:35] word
[1:28:36] in between you just have reformers
[1:28:37] brother Brandon would say that's it just
[1:28:39] reformers trying to get us back to it
[1:28:41] but we got to the point we were so far
[1:28:43] away from the truth that we needed a
[1:28:44] prophet to come and restore us back to
[1:28:47] what it actually meant to be truth
[1:28:48] because they that worship Him must
[1:28:49] worship Him in spirit Azusa Street
[1:28:52] and in truth that's what we needed was
[1:28:55] the truth after it we needed the spirit
[1:28:56] to Quicken that to bring us to true life
[1:28:58] and you can't have true life unless you
[1:29:00] have the truth itself
[1:29:01] Amos 3 7 has never gone out of style God
[1:29:04] never removed this from his Bible it
[1:29:06] says surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:29:07] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[1:29:10] servants the prophets that's it
[1:29:13] that's it there's always got to be a
[1:29:15] prophet when God's going to do something
[1:29:16] he sends it to a prophet
[1:29:18] no it doesn't always have to come to a
[1:29:20] prophet Prophet like we would say
[1:29:21] brother Bradham because we've got five
[1:29:22] full ministry prophets as well brother
[1:29:24] Brown would say that the the the uh the
[1:29:27] New Testament Prophet is a preacher
[1:29:29] and you'll see that in God's using men
[1:29:31] with gifts and he'll bring something to
[1:29:32] them and some of them is through dreams
[1:29:34] and visions and and tongues and these
[1:29:36] different things and then sometimes it's
[1:29:37] just as simple as the preaching of the
[1:29:38] word over the pulpit
[1:29:40] but they are literally prophesying and
[1:29:42] they're speaking the words of God into
[1:29:43] your life and it's up to you to catch
[1:29:45] whether that's God or not and it's life
[1:29:47] to you if you receive it and it's death
[1:29:49] if you don't
[1:29:51] but we come to that question how to
[1:29:52] receive the same reward that the
[1:29:54] messenger does
[1:29:56] scripture says only he gets it but yet
[1:29:59] I'm sitting here saying we all get it I
[1:30:00] get it you get it we're all in this
[1:30:02] together but for one the word has the
[1:30:04] same effect if you receive the word it
[1:30:06] has the same effect that it does on him
[1:30:07] so you receive the word that the prophet
[1:30:09] brings then you'll get what the prophet
[1:30:10] had
[1:30:11] not the gifts necessarily but you'll get
[1:30:15] the you'll get the effect of the word in
[1:30:16] your life because if you receive the
[1:30:18] same word it's got to have the same
[1:30:19] effect the life has the life the life
[1:30:21] will produce the life every single time
[1:30:23] right we said he's a first fruit
[1:30:25] offering and it's proof that the message
[1:30:26] he brings works
[1:30:28] that's what you know my wife and I have
[1:30:30] talked about this many times and and
[1:30:31] kind of her statement has been there's a
[1:30:33] reason why we believe brother Branham
[1:30:35] and it's because he lived a life that
[1:30:37] we've never seen anybody else live since
[1:30:38] the days of Christ
[1:30:40] since the days of the Apostles nobody
[1:30:42] did it nobody did it the way he did it
[1:30:44] with such with such transparency I think
[1:30:47] as well
[1:30:48] Brian will put it this way he says God
[1:30:50] needs no one to interpret the word to
[1:30:53] him
[1:30:54] I was reading in Isaiah the other day
[1:30:55] where he says show me who's ever taught
[1:30:57] God show me who's ever counseled him no
[1:31:00] one we got nothing to offer God he
[1:31:02] interprets it himself by vindicating it
[1:31:04] he says by making it real
[1:31:08] not just preaching making it real and
[1:31:11] When God says he'll do a certain thing
[1:31:12] then he does it and there's no more
[1:31:14] question to it that's the way he does it
[1:31:16] so God has made a way for us God loves
[1:31:18] his children he loves his people he
[1:31:21] wants to help them he wants to help you
[1:31:23] more than you want help
[1:31:25] if you can just get that in your heart
[1:31:28] that God is more willing to help you
[1:31:30] than you are to help yourself that's
[1:31:32] love
[1:31:34] he says but he has a way and that's the
[1:31:37] only way that he'll work is through his
[1:31:39] way you must come to his terms not your
[1:31:42] terms
[1:31:44] his terms he says you want it a certain
[1:31:46] way but he gives it to you his way
[1:31:50] in Moses day no doubt they said I don't
[1:31:52] want to go on a big boat full of stinky
[1:31:55] animals that are just going to make
[1:31:56] noise noise the rest of the time you
[1:31:58] know what I want a luxury cruise I want
[1:32:00] a big yacht I want a big 15-story Cruise
[1:32:03] liner where we got food the whole time
[1:32:05] and entertainment and everything and
[1:32:07] maybe they went and built a different
[1:32:09] kind of boat
[1:32:10] but it wasn't God's design
[1:32:12] and they didn't have a cruise
[1:32:14] right
[1:32:15] you might want the right thing but you
[1:32:18] got to receive it the way that he gives
[1:32:19] it and that's always been the problem
[1:32:21] hasn't it
[1:32:22] the problem is to receive it the way God
[1:32:24] brings it rather than bring your own
[1:32:26] interpretation or this is the way God's
[1:32:27] got to do something in my life
[1:32:30] but there's a second promise we're
[1:32:31] talking about why do we get it when it
[1:32:32] says only the prophet gets it or the
[1:32:34] messenger for that age remember Matthew
[1:32:36] 10 41 it says he that receives a prophet
[1:32:39] in the name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:32:42] prophet's reward
[1:32:44] and he that receiveth the righteous man
[1:32:46] in the name of a righteous man shall
[1:32:48] receive a righteous man's reward now how
[1:32:50] does a Prophet come does he come in his
[1:32:52] name did Elijah come in the name of
[1:32:54] Elijah did Samuel come in the name of
[1:32:55] Samuel did Moses come in the name of
[1:32:57] Moses no when a prophet comes he comes
[1:33:00] in what the name of the Lord because
[1:33:03] they would say thus saith the Lord they
[1:33:06] wouldn't say thus saith Samuel
[1:33:08] because it wasn't their message
[1:33:10] they weren't coming in their name they
[1:33:11] were coming in the name of the Lord so
[1:33:13] whoever truly receives that Prophet with
[1:33:16] a real Revelation understands and
[1:33:18] receives that that is coming from God
[1:33:20] himself
[1:33:21] that's what we're recognizing when we
[1:33:23] read a message book we believe that is
[1:33:25] the holy spirit speaking to this church
[1:33:27] it points us back to here
[1:33:30] this is our absolute but that message
[1:33:32] points us back to this time and time
[1:33:34] again I love how brother Jason Watkins
[1:33:36] says he says I have tried
[1:33:39] and I haven't found anywhere where that
[1:33:40] message doesn't line up with this word
[1:33:43] why because the Holy Spirit can't
[1:33:45] disagree with his word
[1:33:47] in leadership in preaching in Doctrine
[1:33:50] in life it doesn't matter it's got to
[1:33:52] line up with the word amen so we receive
[1:33:55] that prophet in the name of the Lord and
[1:33:57] so when that Prophet speaks we say that
[1:33:59] is not a man speaking that's God
[1:34:00] speaking and you've received him in the
[1:34:03] name of what the prophet you don't
[1:34:05] receive it we don't receive this message
[1:34:06] in the name of William Branham
[1:34:08] William Branham would never want it in
[1:34:10] fact he said I have to leave the I'd
[1:34:12] have to leave the field because they're
[1:34:13] putting me in a place where I'm not
[1:34:14] supposed to be but we receive it as from
[1:34:18] God because he came in the name of the
[1:34:20] Lord and brother Brown would say that's
[1:34:21] thus saith the Lord that's thus saith
[1:34:23] the Lord that's thus saith the Lord
[1:34:24] that's thus saith the Lord
[1:34:27] nothing else I was sharing with one of
[1:34:29] the brothers the other day where brother
[1:34:31] Graham said he said I could sit here
[1:34:32] maybe and God would show me who the next
[1:34:34] president is going to be and so I tell
[1:34:35] you his name and I'll tell you when it's
[1:34:36] going to be he says and what would that
[1:34:38] do he says it'd just make me a big name
[1:34:41] it would have nothing to do with the
[1:34:43] kingdom of God and nothing for the
[1:34:44] kingdom of God but it would make me a
[1:34:46] big name and you know what most of the
[1:34:47] so-called prophets out there trying to
[1:34:49] do predict presidents
[1:34:51] and when the last election came and
[1:34:52] Trump got put out almost every single
[1:34:54] one of them had prophesied that he was
[1:34:55] going to be in
[1:34:57] why because they were trying to build a
[1:34:59] name they were trying to build a
[1:35:00] following remember brother Brandon he
[1:35:02] saw the big university and he saw the
[1:35:03] big headquarters for those different
[1:35:06] um those different evangelists and
[1:35:08] different ones and and he said wow the
[1:35:10] Lord must just not trust me
[1:35:13] you know what it was God kept him
[1:35:16] from that
[1:35:18] because he was building for the kingdom
[1:35:19] of God and look at every one of those
[1:35:21] men and what do they do they go and they
[1:35:22] build a kingdom for themselves and they
[1:35:24] fall in the end
[1:35:25] why because they got off the road of
[1:35:29] coming in somebody else's name they
[1:35:31] didn't come in the name of the Lord they
[1:35:32] came in the name of Oral Roberts or
[1:35:34] these different ones and these different
[1:35:35] things amen
[1:35:37] Moses why did he say who do I say sent
[1:35:40] me because Moses said I can't come in my
[1:35:42] name
[1:35:42] my name's mud
[1:35:45] they knew I was a deliverer I knew I was
[1:35:47] delivered and I messed up so I can't
[1:35:48] come in the name of a deliverer
[1:35:50] because I already tried that and it
[1:35:52] didn't work so he says you got to give
[1:35:53] me a different name to come in
[1:35:56] he says you got to give me your name
[1:35:57] because my name's no good for this
[1:35:59] Church our name's no good for what we're
[1:36:01] about to do
[1:36:02] it's not going to work
[1:36:04] he says when he met Moses he had not a
[1:36:07] name yet
[1:36:08] he didn't have a revealed name yet if I
[1:36:10] could put it that way he wasn't at that
[1:36:11] stage of his Plan of Redemption and he
[1:36:13] told Moses I am that I am then when we
[1:36:15] see Jesus on Earth speaking in Saint
[1:36:17] John the sixth chapter he said I am that
[1:36:18] I am they said why you're a man not over
[1:36:21] 50 years old and you say you've seen
[1:36:22] Abraham he said before Abraham was I am
[1:36:25] and I am was the one The Burning Bush
[1:36:27] the pillar of fire that was in the
[1:36:29] burning bush in the days of Moses the I
[1:36:32] am the I am so Moses had a new name now
[1:36:35] and it was what I am
[1:36:37] what was it manifesting Deliverance
[1:36:40] like I said he came in the name of I am
[1:36:43] come down to deliver thee that was the I
[1:36:45] am for that day we've got a different I
[1:36:47] am today
[1:36:48] we've got a different I am what is it
[1:36:50] our I am is Jesus Christ the same
[1:36:52] yesterday today and forever our I am is
[1:36:54] the bride of Christ Mrs Jesus Christ and
[1:36:57] we'll get into this probably in the next
[1:36:59] service or two amen but he came down as
[1:37:01] I am come down to deliver that was the I
[1:37:03] am that he was coming for in that day
[1:37:05] and his purpose was revealed in his name
[1:37:08] catch that his purpose was revealed in
[1:37:10] his name he came down as I am come down
[1:37:12] to deliver and so Deliverance was what
[1:37:15] must follow and he was the word revealed
[1:37:17] and manifested in his day remember
[1:37:18] brother Brahm said the word interpreted
[1:37:21] is the manifestation of the name of God
[1:37:22] and Moses came and he did what he
[1:37:25] manifested the name of God I am come
[1:37:27] down to deliver and he delivered them
[1:37:28] out of the hand of the Egyptians
[1:37:31] brother man puts it this way he says so
[1:37:32] much word is allotted to each generation
[1:37:35] basically saying so much only a little
[1:37:37] bit or only a portion is allotted to
[1:37:39] each generation watch now he says God
[1:37:42] sends someone in there
[1:37:45] and identifies that word
[1:37:47] by his interpretation of himself
[1:37:51] someone to what interpret God
[1:37:56] not just say it
[1:37:58] but interpret it by what
[1:38:00] identified manifestation
[1:38:03] remember what brother Brown would say I
[1:38:04] literally read this just in in the the
[1:38:06] office there he said the new birth is
[1:38:09] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:38:11] personally
[1:38:13] to you
[1:38:14] that means you are an interpretation of
[1:38:18] Christ
[1:38:19] that means I am an interpretation of
[1:38:21] Christ not the fullness
[1:38:23] that's already happened in Christ but
[1:38:26] there's a portion that's allotted to you
[1:38:28] for this time and this season and it's
[1:38:31] up to you to manifest it
[1:38:33] Moses didn't get a name change
[1:38:34] personally my name's going to stay is
[1:38:36] Jonathan curlette as long as I'm on this
[1:38:37] Earth Moses name stayed the same
[1:38:40] but he came in the name of I am and when
[1:38:44] they asked him who sent you he says I am
[1:38:46] and he said I am come down to deliver
[1:38:47] and I'm here to deliver and they had to
[1:38:49] believe it and receive it in order for
[1:38:51] it to go right and Moses didn't have to
[1:38:53] do all this hype and dancing and
[1:38:54] shouting and everything he had one
[1:38:56] experience church one experience with
[1:38:58] the burning bush with the pillar fire
[1:39:00] and he was sealed for life
[1:39:02] we never see Moses backing off we never
[1:39:05] say Moses saying I don't believe it
[1:39:06] Moses was go go go go go and he believed
[1:39:09] God absolutely from then on takes one
[1:39:11] real experience
[1:39:13] one real experience to give you your
[1:39:14] revelation of who you are in Christ and
[1:39:17] you'll never walk back that's why Jesus
[1:39:18] said no man having put his hand to the
[1:39:20] plow and looking back is fit for the
[1:39:22] kingdom means you haven't got your name
[1:39:24] changed yet means you haven't got your
[1:39:26] identification yet of the word for your
[1:39:27] day
[1:39:29] but let's come back to that phrase
[1:39:30] brother Branham said he said every
[1:39:32] perfect Overcomer receives a new name in
[1:39:35] that way so he says there's a name
[1:39:37] change that's associated with over
[1:39:38] company there's a there's a name change
[1:39:40] that's associated with the word becoming
[1:39:42] flesh there's a name change associated
[1:39:43] with the promise of the word coming into
[1:39:45] your life and it's God's doing not ours
[1:39:48] we don't change our name God changes our
[1:39:51] name the father changes the name of the
[1:39:52] son the husband changes the name of the
[1:39:54] wife at the marriage amen
[1:39:56] why God controls the timing the father
[1:39:59] controls the timing for the adoption he
[1:40:01] says did you notice Abraham was called
[1:40:03] Abram
[1:40:04] but when God went to use him
[1:40:07] he changed his name to Abraham when
[1:40:10] God's ready to use him he changes his
[1:40:12] name he says Sarai was s-a-r-a-i was
[1:40:15] Sarai but when God was going to use her
[1:40:18] he changed her name to Sarah Sarah the
[1:40:21] princess he says did you know that Jacob
[1:40:23] was supplanter and a supplanter is a
[1:40:25] deceiver but when he wrestled with the
[1:40:27] Lord all night long and overcome and was
[1:40:30] blessed God changed his name Jacob to
[1:40:33] Israel a prince with God and it's
[1:40:35] actually a prince having power with God
[1:40:37] Paul was called Saul until he met the
[1:40:40] holy spirit in the form of a light that
[1:40:41] shined down upon him and his name was
[1:40:43] changed from Saul to Paul Simon when he
[1:40:46] met Jesus he changed his name to Peter
[1:40:49] listen he says and when Jesus overcome
[1:40:51] his name was changed and he will reveal
[1:40:54] that name he that will be with him
[1:40:56] overcome as he has received a new name
[1:40:58] and I'll reveal my new name to him see
[1:41:02] I look that up
[1:41:04] I'd never heard it before
[1:41:06] and it's a new name that's going to be
[1:41:08] revealed later
[1:41:09] because down here we'll see that there's
[1:41:11] only one name given here but there's
[1:41:13] another name over there that he'll be
[1:41:15] known by he says and every Overcomer I
[1:41:18] mean among them such as that them
[1:41:20] leaders and so forth now all the
[1:41:21] children of Israel didn't get their name
[1:41:23] changed of course that's right but those
[1:41:25] High leaders when they overcome they
[1:41:27] have received a new name he says see how
[1:41:29] it dovetails in just perfectly now don't
[1:41:31] get caught up on this idea of high
[1:41:32] leaders meaning well only the ministry
[1:41:34] or only the elders no no what he's
[1:41:36] saying is only the elect
[1:41:38] only the elect got those name changed
[1:41:41] right Abraham was special he was a
[1:41:43] father but he was the elect Sarah was
[1:41:46] mostly in doubt half of her life and yet
[1:41:48] she was what she was the elect she was
[1:41:50] elected to overcome she was elected to
[1:41:51] have the child she was elected to go
[1:41:53] through things and get a body change in
[1:41:55] these different things you've got a name
[1:41:56] change if you're a part of the elect
[1:41:57] group remember not all that art say
[1:42:00] Christ Our Christ not all that say
[1:42:01] Christian or Christian not all that say
[1:42:02] message believer message believer but
[1:42:04] the true sons of God and the true
[1:42:05] Daughters of God they'll be identified
[1:42:07] because there's a name change that's
[1:42:08] given to them
[1:42:10] he says and to show him what he was
[1:42:12] going to do he's talking about Abraham
[1:42:14] he changed his name in the 17th chapter
[1:42:16] and he changed Sarah's name that's right
[1:42:18] watch those names they mean something
[1:42:20] why did he change Jacob's name to Israel
[1:42:22] why did he change Saul's name to Paul
[1:42:24] why did he do all those things he says
[1:42:26] after he overcome and entered into his
[1:42:28] glory he said that his name was changed
[1:42:30] in Revelation it's given a promise to
[1:42:32] those that overcome he would make known
[1:42:34] his new name that's right every time
[1:42:36] they overcome they were given a new name
[1:42:40] so there's a name change associated with
[1:42:42] overcoming Abraham when he finally
[1:42:44] overcome he was taken from the name of
[1:42:46] Abraham and said You shall not be called
[1:42:48] Abram anymore but shall be called
[1:42:50] Abraham
[1:42:52] notice he says Abraham has overcome had
[1:42:55] overcome and then he gets the name
[1:42:56] change
[1:42:57] but where was he overcoming in Abraham's
[1:42:59] life
[1:43:01] he didn't have Isaac yet
[1:43:03] but he had a name change before he had
[1:43:04] Isaac and brother Brown says he had
[1:43:06] overcome by then
[1:43:07] he says give him part of his name tacked
[1:43:12] it onto him Elohim h-i-m and H.A.M
[1:43:14] Elohim in other words he says I am the
[1:43:16] father of all things what was he doing
[1:43:18] he was saying I am doing this
[1:43:21] he says it's me it's God that's doing it
[1:43:23] you're getting my name added to yours
[1:43:25] because I'm the one that's working in
[1:43:27] you and with you but notice it was only
[1:43:29] a part of his name
[1:43:30] why because it was a type
[1:43:32] it was a type it wasn't perfect it was a
[1:43:34] type
[1:43:35] it was partial he said see and I'm
[1:43:37] making you a father of Nations so I've
[1:43:39] changed and I give you part of my name
[1:43:41] father of Nations ham see Elohim Abraham
[1:43:45] he says and he was the father of nations
[1:43:48] in other words the name change took
[1:43:51] effect
[1:43:53] that's what he was saying God changed
[1:43:54] his name and then he made him what the
[1:43:56] name was
[1:43:58] now it didn't look like it did it he
[1:44:00] gave him one son
[1:44:02] one son and that was the Fulfillment of
[1:44:05] father of many nations
[1:44:07] that's why I said most people are going
[1:44:09] to miss it it's going to be so simple
[1:44:12] that they'll think that it has to be
[1:44:13] some Grand thing
[1:44:15] the father of many nations was one son
[1:44:18] and that was the Fulfillment of the
[1:44:20] Overcomer in that age he says oh isn't
[1:44:22] that beautiful to that old man an old
[1:44:24] woman a hundred years old now he says
[1:44:26] the promise is fixing to be fulfilled
[1:44:30] he gives them the name change and the
[1:44:32] name change means something's about to
[1:44:34] happen something's about to change the
[1:44:36] promise is about to occur the word is
[1:44:38] about to be manifested God is stepping
[1:44:40] on the scene and he's going to do it
[1:44:42] because it's his timing now let's look
[1:44:44] at this as we start to close
[1:44:46] just one last thing to nail it down in
[1:44:49] Matthew it says and Jesus answered and
[1:44:50] said unto him he's talking to Simon
[1:44:52] Peter he says blessed art thou Simon
[1:44:54] barjona Simon son of Jonah that's his
[1:44:57] natural heritage that's his natural
[1:44:58] family Simon have been adopted he had a
[1:45:02] daddy and his dad's name was Jonah he
[1:45:04] said for flesh and blood is not revealed
[1:45:06] it unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:45:07] heaven and I say also unto thee that
[1:45:10] thou art Peter here's your new name
[1:45:12] Simon barjona your new name is Peter
[1:45:16] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:45:18] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:45:20] Prevail against it he didn't build the
[1:45:22] church on Peter
[1:45:24] Peter in the Greek is Petra and it means
[1:45:27] rocker Little Rock Peter was not
[1:45:29] immovable Peter still needed a new birth
[1:45:32] Peter was still carnal Peter was still
[1:45:34] sinful amen but once he got the new
[1:45:37] birth he was solid and Peter never went
[1:45:39] back after he got the new birth after
[1:45:41] the upper room experience he went from a
[1:45:43] man that could not identify himself with
[1:45:45] the ministry of Christ to a man that
[1:45:47] could go out and preach to everybody
[1:45:48] that was there
[1:45:49] that's what a name change does for us
[1:45:51] Church
[1:45:52] but it's got to go through a new birth
[1:45:55] in this age amen but what is it on
[1:45:57] Christ the solid rock I stand all other
[1:46:00] ground is sinking sand that's where the
[1:46:02] Revelation is amen but he gave him a new
[1:46:04] name because it was pointing to what he
[1:46:06] was going to do in Peter's life that's
[1:46:08] what's going on here he's saying Peter
[1:46:09] there's something good coming for you
[1:46:11] down the road and he's changing his name
[1:46:13] and he's saying I've got a purpose
[1:46:14] personal purpose for you and you'll
[1:46:17] stand when you've got to stand you're
[1:46:19] going to fail before then and Peter did
[1:46:21] fail
[1:46:21] but you're going to stand when it
[1:46:23] matters and when you stand it's going to
[1:46:25] have an effect because the name that
[1:46:26] I've given you is representative of the
[1:46:28] work that I'm going to do in your life
[1:46:29] and how I'm going to use you for the
[1:46:31] kingdom of God it might be a fight
[1:46:33] don't think it's not a fight don't think
[1:46:34] Peter didn't have to fight but he'll
[1:46:36] stand when God needs him to stand
[1:46:37] because he's been given a name that
[1:46:39] represents the word for him
[1:46:41] amen he said and I will give unto thee
[1:46:44] the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[1:46:46] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:46:48] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:46:49] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[1:46:51] loosed in heaven what was the name
[1:46:54] signifying what was the name change
[1:46:55] signifying something's about to happen
[1:46:57] Peter
[1:46:58] Peter you got a great revelation
[1:47:01] but you got a ways to go but I'm letting
[1:47:03] you know you got a different name
[1:47:04] because there's a purpose for the word
[1:47:05] to be manifested in your life and it's
[1:47:07] about to come get ready Peter there's
[1:47:10] something coming for your life amen
[1:47:12] let's stand together if we would
[1:47:14] you know Peter went through a lot over
[1:47:16] those next few months
[1:47:19] the name change means something's about
[1:47:20] to happen
[1:47:22] you know what that means there's often a
[1:47:24] gap
[1:47:24] Abraham and Sarah at most had at least
[1:47:27] nine months to wait before they had that
[1:47:28] baby
[1:47:29] who knows how long it was before she
[1:47:31] started to show that she was pregnant
[1:47:33] but we we know a body change happened
[1:47:34] very quickly
[1:47:36] and that was a sign that there was more
[1:47:37] to come and we look at Peter and he had
[1:47:39] to go through a lot before he got to the
[1:47:41] promise being fulfilled
[1:47:44] he slept he fell he failed he backslid
[1:47:46] he denied Christ
[1:47:48] and then he went back and he fished
[1:47:50] naked on his boat
[1:47:52] but that didn't stop the promise of God
[1:47:54] why because when he gives you his name
[1:47:57] it means his word has to be fulfilled
[1:47:59] because his name is his word and his
[1:48:01] word will not return unto him void amen
[1:48:04] he turned him into a fisher of man from
[1:48:07] a man that couldn't even admit that he
[1:48:09] knew Christ
[1:48:11] that's a 180. that's a big
[1:48:13] transformation
[1:48:14] he was our Bluster and and and and
[1:48:18] bragging and and this sat and the other
[1:48:20] and then when the time came he couldn't
[1:48:21] stand
[1:48:23] but Jesus said don't worry Peter I
[1:48:25] prayed for you
[1:48:26] I prayed for you I gave you a new name I
[1:48:29] revealed myself to you and when you're
[1:48:30] converted he says go strengthen
[1:48:32] everybody else with the strength that
[1:48:33] I've given you
[1:48:35] brother Brian would say this is our last
[1:48:36] quote he says he met a man one time
[1:48:39] and his name was Simon and he changed
[1:48:41] his name to rock Peter why he had the
[1:48:44] keys is that right he changed his name
[1:48:46] and made him a rock
[1:48:47] Peter had the keys because he was the
[1:48:49] one who had the keys to the kingdom
[1:48:51] a new name a new name written in this
[1:48:53] rock that no one knows but he himself
[1:48:55] he knows who he is but he can't tell
[1:48:57] others see no one knows but himself see
[1:49:00] Peter knows he had the keys but you
[1:49:02] didn't hear him bragging about it see
[1:49:04] these guys who brag about what they are
[1:49:06] is usually nothing uh-huh he says a
[1:49:09] White Rock and ended a new name not his
[1:49:11] own name but he's somebody else
[1:49:14] that only he himself knows
[1:49:18] he that's got the rock the name he said
[1:49:21] see special Manna to feed the church
[1:49:23] remember
[1:49:25] that's why this third poll that's why
[1:49:27] this end time bride of Christ is not
[1:49:28] going to be a public show
[1:49:30] I was talking to somebody a while ago
[1:49:32] and they said well why don't you go tell
[1:49:33] people all about this why don't you go
[1:49:35] tell people who you are in this sentence
[1:49:37] the other thing I said because that's
[1:49:38] not what we're called to do
[1:49:40] we're not supposed to go and make a show
[1:49:41] we're not here to cater to the whims of
[1:49:43] this world
[1:49:45] but we give eternal life by giving them
[1:49:47] the word
[1:49:48] that's the only way we can do it
[1:49:51] when Peter opened the the the the the
[1:49:53] kingdoms and he opened up to the
[1:49:55] Gentiles what did he do he didn't go
[1:49:57] with a lock
[1:49:59] he went with the word
[1:50:01] and he went and he opened it up and then
[1:50:02] as he went there then it was opened up
[1:50:04] and all of a sudden everybody started
[1:50:05] coming in and these different things and
[1:50:07] it's no different today we go and we
[1:50:09] express what the word
[1:50:11] but don't go around and say I'm this and
[1:50:13] you're not I'm better than you I've got
[1:50:15] power to do so I've got power to do that
[1:50:16] and no no no
[1:50:18] why because we're led by the spirit of
[1:50:20] God but we give the word everywhere we
[1:50:22] go we live it above all other things and
[1:50:25] then we share it as well amen it's not
[1:50:27] going to be a public show
[1:50:29] we're not here to tell everybody what we
[1:50:30] are but we're here to tell him I come in
[1:50:32] the name of the Lord
[1:50:34] when we speak people ought to realize
[1:50:35] there's somebody else's speaking
[1:50:38] you know when we have Roy come here and
[1:50:40] he doesn't understand what's going on
[1:50:43] but he knows it's something different
[1:50:46] he knows it's something different he's
[1:50:47] not sure where to place it yet that's
[1:50:49] what it ought to be when people look at
[1:50:50] us they say you know our speech ought to
[1:50:53] betray us
[1:50:54] you know our speech out of betrayed so
[1:50:55] people ought to look at what we do and
[1:50:57] how we do it and why we do it they ought
[1:50:58] to say there's something different about
[1:51:00] those people
[1:51:01] and we ought to be say yeah I used to be
[1:51:04] just like you
[1:51:05] maybe not just like you some of us
[1:51:08] because we've been raised in Christian
[1:51:09] homes but I used to think like you do
[1:51:13] and guess what I got changed
[1:51:16] I got a new name I'm a New Creation in
[1:51:18] Christ my wife shared something with me
[1:51:20] the other day and it it was a person
[1:51:21] saying you know what but I was born like
[1:51:23] this
[1:51:25] and Christ said back that's why you need
[1:51:26] a new birth
[1:51:28] amen we were all born different than
[1:51:30] where we are right now
[1:51:31] remember we needed a new birth and when
[1:51:33] we did that we took on a new name
[1:51:36] what Christ Christian
[1:51:38] Mrs Jesus Christ is what brother Brandon
[1:51:40] would say the Bride of the Living God
[1:51:41] Amen there's a name change that's given
[1:51:44] to us we've got a different name now
[1:51:47] and it means what that there's a word
[1:51:49] that's going to be manifested that is
[1:51:50] being manifested in our lives today amen
[1:51:53] that's all we're trying to do live the
[1:51:55] word for our day Not Another Day and not
[1:51:58] what somebody tells us to do I think
[1:52:00] that's the greatest danger is that we
[1:52:02] get in and we try and give a message in
[1:52:04] a way that the person wants it
[1:52:06] and it never works
[1:52:08] it never works but we've got to give it
[1:52:10] as he gives it to us and then they can
[1:52:12] take it or they can turn it down
[1:52:14] and all we've got to try and do is be
[1:52:16] salty in it all amen just be salty amen
[1:52:19] let's bow our heads each one Heavenly
[1:52:21] Father
[1:52:23] Lord you've called us
[1:52:25] Lord are you predestinating us you
[1:52:27] Justified us you Sanctified us you've
[1:52:29] placed Us in Heavenly places in Christ

[1:52:33] you've given us your name Lord You've
[1:52:36] entrusted us with your word
[1:52:38] not just to speak it Lord but to live it
[1:52:40] and Lord we're asking Lord that like
[1:52:42] Moses did and like Samuel did and like
[1:52:45] David did and the apostles did Lord that
[1:52:47] we'd not just be hearers Lord but we be
[1:52:49] doers as well heavenly father that each
[1:52:51] one of us Lord would take that portion
[1:52:53] of the word that's allotted to us Lord
[1:52:55] and that we'd live it out
[1:52:57] nor not look at what each one is doing
[1:52:59] Lord but look to ourselves in the word
[1:53:01] and say let your word live in me
[1:53:03] Lord would you grant us Grace each one
[1:53:05] Lord let our days be Lord season with
[1:53:08] salt Lord that people will be thirsty
[1:53:09] around us Lord that they desire the life
[1:53:11] that we have Lord and that we point them
[1:53:13] to you always Lord May our witness May
[1:53:16] Our Testimony be that we've got a
[1:53:17] life-changing God that's living inside
[1:53:19] of us and then he's got Open Arms of
[1:53:22] Grace for each and every one

[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:17] amen
[2:06:18] amen praise the Lord if you want to just
[2:06:20] have a seat for a minute or two um
[2:06:23] I need to
[2:06:25] just update everybody on what's
[2:06:27] happening with the next phase and that
[2:06:30] is the carpeting that's uh I guess
[2:06:32] everybody figured that one out by now so
[2:06:34] carpeting is is next to be done and uh
[2:06:39] it looks like now Monday is the time
[2:06:42] when it will start it's a three-day job
[2:06:45] and uh and I guess maybe at least three
[2:06:48] days so it'll start sometime Monday and
[2:06:49] I don't know exactly the time but so
[2:06:52] it'll go into certainly into Wednesday
[2:06:53] uh maybe even into Thursdays for all I
[2:06:56] know so it's likely
[2:06:59] um it's likely that we won't be having
[2:07:01] service I don't think maybe the deacons
[2:07:03] can they have no service right okay so
[2:07:06] it won't be a service on Wednesday night
[2:07:08] that's right protocol is going to be
[2:07:09] available as well so
[2:07:12] uh
[2:07:14] so there won't there won't be a service
[2:07:15] and as well before I forget we won't
[2:07:19] um
[2:07:20] we won't be eating out there on Sunday
[2:07:22] either in the fellowship hall because
[2:07:24] that's going to be full of all these
[2:07:26] pews and everything else that we can and
[2:07:28] we can stuff in there so what what this
[2:07:32] is is kind of is a call for volunteers
[2:07:34] okay from the brothers in particular
[2:07:37] we we're going to need some help was
[2:07:39] what we have to do is as you can see now
[2:07:43] we've moved out to pews from boat Wings
[2:07:45] here and put them in the
[2:07:48] in the fellowship hall uh next thing we
[2:07:52] have to do is we have to take up all
[2:07:55] this carpet and all all the borders that
[2:07:57] are around as well so a little bit of
[2:08:00] work to that then when you get those up
[2:08:02] then we got the brackets to take out of
[2:08:03] the concrete floor
[2:08:05] so
[2:08:07] and I I'll probably be at that a little
[2:08:10] bit uh myself and uh Brother David
[2:08:12] during the day in polymeric maybe
[2:08:15] uh to try and get up some some of the
[2:08:17] carpet to make it easier we will leave
[2:08:21] a few pews uh here for Sunday
[2:08:25] okay so we're all spread apart here now
[2:08:28] but we won't be spread apart too much on
[2:08:30] Sunday because we're going to take some
[2:08:31] of those
[2:08:32] as many as we can dare take out
[2:08:35] uh and and get them into the fellowship
[2:08:39] hall and then what that means is that
[2:08:42] just like we did the last time we were
[2:08:44] getting ready for the painting uh after
[2:08:46] after church on Sunday we're going to
[2:08:49] need the brothers again to be able to
[2:08:51] take uh take the rest of the pews out
[2:08:53] and take the pulpit out
[2:08:55] and take the organ over the next of
[2:08:58] those next few days so what I'm asking
[2:09:00] for sun Saturday if uh is for some
[2:09:05] brothers to come and give us a hand to
[2:09:07] take out those big pews there
[2:09:10] and to help rip up the carpet
[2:09:13] whatever is not done everything is going
[2:09:16] to be careful like from back here right
[2:09:19] to the door
[2:09:20] so you can see there's a bit of work
[2:09:23] that has to be done we don't have to
[2:09:25] move the piano I don't think
[2:09:27] that's the only thing that won't come
[2:09:29] out and I can't come off the floor out
[2:09:31] of this out of this particular room so
[2:09:33] what the installers have told us is that
[2:09:35] we had a few bodies here lifted they'll
[2:09:38] Slide the carpet out air in okay we'll
[2:09:41] slide it out ourselves but we will um
[2:09:45] we might just need a couple of us and
[2:09:47] they they volunteered to give us a hand
[2:09:49] to uh to put in the new
[2:09:52] carpet underneath drop the panel down
[2:09:55] and we're back in business okay on that
[2:09:57] point
[2:09:58] so
[2:10:00] um that's what will happen there
[2:10:02] uh
[2:10:04] I would ask that even starting tonight
[2:10:06] if you have anything at all in your Pew
[2:10:08] take it out take it home with you
[2:10:10] uh like your you know your books or
[2:10:14] Bibles ending for the kids and that
[2:10:15] please take it out
[2:10:17] because
[2:10:19] as you know it could get mislaid
[2:10:23] and when you can do it a Sunday as well
[2:10:26] you can start tonight but at least by
[2:10:29] Sunday get get everything out of the pew
[2:10:31] take it home and then when we have
[2:10:33] service again you can you know bring
[2:10:36] back what you got to bring back so
[2:10:38] uh and uh
[2:10:41] please keep the pews after every service
[2:10:43] of course keep them keep them tidy as
[2:10:45] you have been so we I'm sure the
[2:10:47] cleaners appreciate that
[2:10:50] um so um
[2:10:54] yeah so I know that Matthew and thanks
[2:10:58] especially to brother Isaac here he's
[2:11:00] been working hand in hand with Matt past
[2:11:02] couple of nights uh to do to do the work
[2:11:05] over there in the booth there are
[2:11:07] pulling wires and they're soldering and
[2:11:08] they're doing all kinds of stuff
[2:11:10] and under guidance of brother Levi so uh
[2:11:15] that that's uh that's work that is
[2:11:19] ongoing and they may end up able to put
[2:11:21] I mean about a day on brother Isaac
[2:11:23] going out of town for a day or two it'll
[2:11:25] be back Friday evening
[2:11:26] and they'll be here is over here on
[2:11:28] Saturday to help as well so uh when we
[2:11:32] we appreciate that for sure
[2:11:35] so uh anybody that's not here
[2:11:38] um
[2:11:38] I will say I'll send an email out anyway
[2:11:41] just confirming that whoever could be
[2:11:43] here on Saturday morning it may not take
[2:11:45] all day I don't know what I really don't
[2:11:47] know how long it's going to take because
[2:11:48] I don't know how
[2:11:49] how difficult it's going to be to rip up
[2:11:52] that carpet I know the border is a
[2:11:54] little tricky but uh
[2:11:56] I know here it's not going to be too bad
[2:11:59] it's
[2:12:00] but hopefully within a few hours we
[2:12:03] might have we might have it done but uh
[2:12:05] if you could just spare
[2:12:07] as much time as possible that would be a
[2:12:10] great help
[2:12:11] to this to this whole trustee and the
[2:12:14] other old trustees
[2:12:16] any help any helps appreciate it so I
[2:12:20] that's about all I wanted to say I just
[2:12:22] I just felt it was time for me to update
[2:12:24] everybody uh on behalf of the trustees
[2:12:27] just to uh just so that you knew
[2:12:30] what's what's going to happen so things
[2:12:32] are going to get a little bit hectic a
[2:12:34] little bit busy but and I think Matt
[2:12:36] Smith said it's for even setting up the
[2:12:39] the technical aspects here to video the
[2:12:41] audio and all that stuff they still got
[2:12:44] more work to do and it's going to be
[2:12:45] just like that that happened there you
[2:12:48] know a little Fade Out there's going to
[2:12:50] be some technical difficulties
[2:12:52] periodically so patience
[2:12:56] my mother always said patience is a
[2:12:58] virtue of possess it if you can right so
[2:13:00] let's um
[2:13:02] that's just being for one for another
[2:13:04] God has brought us this far
[2:13:06] and I believe it'll bring us right
[2:13:07] through to the end and this is
[2:13:10] apparently be a between the next uh
[2:13:13] between this and the next couple of
[2:13:15] projects that we got to finish up the
[2:13:16] roof and uh repair to the pavement
[2:13:21] outside those will be the biggest things
[2:13:23] left to do
[2:13:25] and what what better man and them are
[2:13:28] doing once that's done
[2:13:30] we should be able to just
[2:13:32] I I shouldn't say it too loud but
[2:13:36] have a kind of a
[2:13:38] easier summer you know like where we can
[2:13:41] just catch up back home me for one
[2:13:45] so that's uh
[2:13:47] that's all I wanted to say that uh
[2:13:50] we can sure appreciate your help and
[2:13:52] cooperation and
[2:13:55] at least your prayers
[2:13:56] Okay so
[2:13:58] let's work together as as one body so
[2:14:02] thanks for for that and uh
[2:14:05] I will send an update to especially to
[2:14:07] those that we're not here would need to
