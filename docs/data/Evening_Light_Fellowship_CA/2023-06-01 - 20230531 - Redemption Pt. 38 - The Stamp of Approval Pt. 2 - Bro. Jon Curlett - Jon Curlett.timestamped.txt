[41:34] it and that's what makes us a body
[41:36] and then coming in here and sitting
[41:38] under the preaching the word that's the
[41:39] easy part it's when people have needs
[41:41] when people have issues in their life
[41:43] and we get together and we we group
[41:45] around them and we take them before the
[41:47] throne of grace in our prayers yes but
[41:49] then we take our bodies and we take our
[41:50] time and our energy and we put that on
[41:52] the line as well and say that's the
[41:54] Lord's as well amen it's not just our
[41:56] time in here but it's when we go out and
[41:58] help those around us amen God bless you
[42:00] Romans chapter 8 verse 14 says for as
[42:03] many as are led by the spirit of God
[42:06] they are the sons of God
[42:08] for ye have not received the spirit of
[42:10] bondage again to fear but ye have
[42:12] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[42:14] we cry Abba Father
[42:16] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[42:19] our spirit that we are the children of
[42:21] God and if children then heirs Heirs of
[42:24] God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be
[42:27] that we suffer with him that we may be
[42:30] also glorified together for I reckon
[42:33] that the sufferings of this present time
[42:34] are not worthy to be compared with the
[42:36] glory which shall be revealed in us now
[42:39] don't have verse 19 up there but let's
[42:40] read it he says for the earnest
[42:42] expectation of the creature wadeth for
[42:45] the manifestation of the sons of God
[42:48] Amen you can have your seats this
[42:49] evening God bless you and
[42:51] we're going to be continuing Right Along
[42:53] on that that thought of a the stamp of
[42:56] approval that we spoke on last service
[42:57] and we we covered what Christ had to go
[42:59] through and we look at him and last time
[43:01] and we spoke of how he was born the Son
[43:03] of God and yet he had to go through and
[43:05] he had to prove himself and he had to
[43:07] stand up with the word and he didn't
[43:09] have the Holy Ghost at first and then
[43:10] when he pleased God then he got the Holy
[43:13] Ghost by obedience and then after that
[43:15] he had to spend three years and he had
[43:16] to be proved and tested and tried and he
[43:19] had wonderful victories he had wonderful
[43:21] times and and saw God moving through him
[43:24] of course he was the expression of God
[43:25] but yet in all of that he had headaches
[43:27] and he had he had sickness and he had
[43:29] difficulties and he had rejection and he
[43:31] he faced many trials but he had many
[43:33] victories in that as well and we saw
[43:35] that at the end of it he had a mount
[43:37] Transfiguration experience and that's
[43:39] where God said this is my beloved Son
[43:41] and I'm not just pleased with him now
[43:42] but now you can hear him he speaks for
[43:44] me and I'll be silent and and now he's
[43:46] the voice from Heaven to you today and
[43:49] so today we want to kind of move on with
[43:51] that thought and take it from from
[43:52] Christ to us because we read last
[43:53] service the scripture that says that he
[43:55] was the firstborn of among many Brethren
[43:57] so he was the first of all of us and
[43:59] there's more of us to come and so we
[44:01] want to talk about our part and we want
[44:03] to talk about what it looks like to get
[44:05] the stamp of approval if we were going
[44:06] to do it and you know we're preaching on
[44:09] this thought of adoption and and we're
[44:11] going to be talking a bit about the end
[44:12] result today and we're going to talk
[44:14] about what it looks like to be an
[44:15] adopted son or an adopted daughter of
[44:17] God and and kind of the witness that's
[44:19] given of us and you know Sister Delfina
[44:21] graduated uh from from University I
[44:24] believe it was on on Monday maybe it was
[44:26] Tuesday and so she's finished she's done
[44:29] she's she's received her degree and it's
[44:31] a wonderful day and you know she walked
[44:33] across the stage and I'm sure her mother
[44:34] was standing up and giving a big Ovation
[44:37] and people were shouting and hooping and
[44:38] hollering and having a wonderful time
[44:40] but before she got to that place
[44:43] everything that she did in University
[44:44] had to be reviewed and anybody that
[44:47] knows the story with sister delfina's
[44:48] University experience knows that she was
[44:50] supposed to graduate she thought last
[44:52] year
[44:53] because according to her she had done
[44:55] everything that they required to get her
[44:57] degree and she had passy marks and she'd
[44:59] done all the courses but what happened
[45:01] was that they realized that she hadn't
[45:02] done everything that they thought she
[45:04] had done and that it was their mistake
[45:06] but she hadn't done everything and so
[45:08] she had to go back and take just a few
[45:09] more courses to pass amen so they had to
[45:12] review her grades they had to go through
[45:13] and make sure her work and her
[45:14] performance qualified and though she
[45:16] felt she had done it all that she had
[45:18] done all the time she had done all the
[45:20] work she had received the grades she had
[45:21] paid her money she thought she was ready
[45:23] to graduate and yet she couldn't
[45:25] graduate why because she isn't the one
[45:28] that evaluates herself in this
[45:29] graduation she's not the one that
[45:31] determines if she's ready to graduate
[45:32] but rather there's somebody else that's
[45:34] involved with the university that had to
[45:36] go through her entire transcript and say
[45:39] does this meet the requirements does
[45:40] this meet the qualifications to receive
[45:43] the degree that she wants to receive and
[45:45] like I said last year they came back and
[45:47] they said sorry we made a mistake we LED
[45:49] you wrong and you're not ready to
[45:51] graduate and you have to do these couple
[45:52] extra courses that is of course a trial
[45:55] for her because you're expecting you're
[45:56] done and all of a sudden they say you're
[45:57] not done so she's had to deal with those
[45:59] things but my point in all this is that
[46:01] no matter how worthy she was
[46:05] she wasn't ready to graduate because she
[46:07] doesn't the one that chooses how it how
[46:09] she's going to graduate somebody else
[46:11] has to say you have done everything that
[46:13] is required to qualify for this degree
[46:15] and so when we come to this idea of
[46:17] adoption and and we speak about these
[46:19] things it's not us that says when we're
[46:21] ready
[46:22] we put in the work and there's no doubt
[46:24] we're putting in the work and we put in
[46:25] the time and we're obedient to the word
[46:27] and we're growing and we're maturing in
[46:29] all of these things but it's not us that
[46:31] says you're ready for adoption it's got
[46:32] to be somebody else that says it because
[46:34] our analysis of ourselves if we look in
[46:37] the scripture we'll find is usually
[46:38] sorely lacking we tend to think of
[46:40] ourselves higher than we ought to and we
[46:41] rarely see ourselves in the True Light
[46:43] of the word of God unless we've really
[46:45] got the Holy Spirit working in our lives
[46:46] but we look at what brings us even even
[46:49] to church and what causes us to live the
[46:51] life that we do and we know that acts 2
[46:53] 38 is our qualification list
[46:56] Acts 2 38 is the only way you're going
[46:58] to get into heaven you're not going to
[46:59] get into heaven because you identify
[47:01] with this message you're not going to
[47:02] get in because you go to church you're
[47:03] not going to go into it because of who
[47:05] your mother and father are but we have a
[47:07] formula to graduate we have a formula to
[47:09] give us eternal life and that is what
[47:11] you repent
[47:12] now repentance is not what brings us
[47:14] Unity
[47:15] repentance is not what makes us a body
[47:17] yet every one of us must repent
[47:20] and then it says we have to be baptized
[47:22] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[47:23] remission of sins but baptism is not our
[47:25] Unity there are people out there that
[47:27] are baptized in the name of the Lord
[47:28] Jesus Christ that are not a part of the
[47:30] mystical body of Jesus Christ
[47:33] but there is one thing that makes us a
[47:35] unified body and that is the baptism of
[47:37] the holy spirit that has given us by
[47:39] promise in Acts 2 38 if we sincerely
[47:41] repent and if we're baptized the proper
[47:44] way so our Unity is in the spirit our
[47:46] Unity is not in our baptism our Unity is
[47:48] not just in our Doctrine but it is the
[47:50] holy spirit of God personally in each
[47:52] one of us that makes us a part of the
[47:54] body of Christ and that's what makes us
[47:56] unified even when we don't want to be
[47:58] unified when issues come in between
[48:00] brothers and sisters and relationships
[48:02] and even within the church itself what
[48:04] keeps us a body is the holy spirit it's
[48:06] not because I want to be here all the
[48:08] time or because you want to be here all
[48:09] the time but there's something inside of
[48:11] us that pulls us to that brother and
[48:13] sister regardless of our differences
[48:15] because you can't separate from
[48:16] something that's a part of you
[48:18] there's a Unity that comes by the Holy
[48:20] Spirit and I think the most common thing
[48:22] that brother Branham would quote
[48:24] certainly in the last five years of his
[48:25] ministry is this scripture in First
[48:27] Corinthians 12 13. because this is what
[48:30] levels the playing field
[48:31] this is what levels the playing field
[48:33] whether we're black whether we're white
[48:35] whether we're rich whether we're poor
[48:37] whether we have an education whether we
[48:39] don't whether we're White Collar Blue
[48:40] Collar man or woman it doesn't matter
[48:42] the holy spirit is the thing that
[48:44] equalizes the playing field
[48:46] and First Corinthians 12 13 says for but
[48:49] why what one Spirit we are all baptized
[48:52] into one body whether we be Jews or
[48:55] Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and
[48:57] we have been all made to drink into one
[49:01] spirit
[49:03] that is the thing that unites us as the
[49:05] Holy Spirit that's the thing that keeps
[49:07] us coming back here is because we
[49:08] believe the holy spirit is present in
[49:11] this Collective body not just in the
[49:13] ministry and not just in mom and dad but
[49:15] in each and every one of us and that's
[49:17] what keeps me coming back here to preach
[49:19] and to be a part of this is because I
[49:21] believe that you are the same as I am
[49:22] and I'm the same as you are I remember
[49:25] one of the first things I said when I
[49:27] moved here as I said this church has
[49:28] more power in it than it knows
[49:31] why because the holy spirit is present
[49:34] in the lives of the Believers here and
[49:36] when you get the Holy Spirit like we
[49:38] said last time in the service before
[49:39] it's like the seed inside of that Lily
[49:41] everything you have need of is quickened
[49:45] by the Holy Spirit and everything you're
[49:47] supposed to be as quick and by the Holy
[49:48] Spirit and once you come to life and
[49:51] because you had it ordained for you in
[49:52] the first place nothing will stop it
[49:54] that is the power of this church and
[49:57] every Church where there are real
[49:58] children of God is that the holy
[50:00] spirit's there to Quicken them into what
[50:02] they are supposed to be and nothing can
[50:04] stop but I was listening just before
[50:05] service where brother Branham says you
[50:07] you you lay down concrete and he says
[50:10] where is the grass thickest he says it's
[50:12] on the edge of the concrete because
[50:13] though the seed is underneath it will
[50:16] follow the path of warmth and sunlight
[50:18] and it'll come out and then it'll go
[50:20] straight up next to that concrete he
[50:21] said even concrete won't stop the life
[50:24] of that grass and he says it doesn't
[50:25] matter what Satan piles on top of us
[50:27] whether it's difficulty whether it's
[50:29] genetics whether it's family issues
[50:30] whether it's Ministry issues nothing is
[50:33] going to stop the life of God from
[50:34] coming out in your life if you have this
[50:36] see Gene of God inside of you that's the
[50:38] promise that we have amen but we spend
[50:41] weeks on on this idea of what it means
[50:43] to be a son and a daughter of God and
[50:44] this side of adoption but the thing we
[50:46] want to hammer down this service is that
[50:48] your teacher is always the one that
[50:50] evaluates you
[50:51] we submit self self-assessments I think
[50:54] at times when I do my my personal
[50:56] reviews at work for my work I have to
[50:58] say how I thought I did but in the end
[50:59] what I think doesn't matter it's what my
[51:01] boss thinks and it's the same thing in
[51:03] the class and it's the same thing when
[51:05] we're talking about this adoption is
[51:07] that the tutor is the one that gives the
[51:08] report
[51:10] now I don't know what your kids are like
[51:12] but sometimes our kids come home from
[51:13] school and they give us a different
[51:15] report than what their report card says
[51:16] amen
[51:18] we don't listen to the child now
[51:20] sometimes they have some concerns that
[51:22] maybe we want to talk to the teacher
[51:23] about but in the end we're going to go
[51:25] by what the teacher says not by what
[51:27] that child says
[51:28] because our assessment of ourself is
[51:30] usually flawed
[51:32] when it comes to being a child of God
[51:34] listen the pastor doesn't evaluate you
[51:36] the deacons don't evaluate you Mom and
[51:38] Dad don't evaluate you we have opinions
[51:40] and we have input but in the end it's
[51:42] going to be the holy spirit that
[51:43] qualifies you as a child of God or not a
[51:45] child of God and where you're at in your
[51:47] walk with God and these things amen
[51:49] we read that that quote a couple weeks
[51:52] ago where where brother Brahm says
[51:53] people say they have the truth and the
[51:55] reason they believe it is because they
[51:57] said it of themselves
[51:58] that can't be where we're at as children
[52:00] of God it's because I say I am a child
[52:03] of God that's what makes me a child of
[52:04] God
[52:05] now there's something that we face in
[52:07] this age and and it's an attitude of of
[52:10] self-reflection and self uh approval if
[52:12] you we will and it's called narcissism
[52:15] and it is literally the the defining
[52:18] characteristic of this layout to see an
[52:20] age and I looked it up and it says that
[52:22] it's a mental health condition
[52:24] this isn't just an attitude this isn't
[52:27] just an idea now they say it's a mental
[52:28] health condition in which people have an
[52:30] unreasonably high sense of their own
[52:33] importance they need and seek too much
[52:35] attention and want people to admire them
[52:39] and you'll see that today in that and
[52:42] certainly in this thing with social
[52:43] media where social media is a place
[52:45] where you can create a Persona you can
[52:47] create a lifestyle you can create an
[52:50] impression of who and what you are and
[52:51] what you have and there is no
[52:53] accountability there and it feeds
[52:55] narcissism now uh these big words always
[52:59] come from the Greeks don't they and
[53:01] narcissus was a a Greek character from
[53:04] mythology and he fell deeply in love
[53:06] with who
[53:07] himself
[53:10] he resisted the advances of everybody
[53:12] because he did not feel that they were
[53:14] what he was looking for and then one day
[53:16] he was going by a still pool of water
[53:18] and said who's that handsome fellow and
[53:22] he fell in love with himself
[53:24] and he would stay there and he would
[53:26] stare at himself he was so appreciative
[53:28] of his fine looks and his wonderful
[53:30] figure and his big muscles and his
[53:32] glowing eyes and he fell in love with
[53:34] himself and he rejected all other love
[53:37] and then when he finally found out that
[53:39] he was staring at himself he ended up
[53:42] dying because he could not have the love
[53:43] which he craved
[53:46] and this is what we're talking about
[53:48] today is this idea of people who are
[53:50] satisfied with who and what they are
[53:52] based on their own reflection of
[53:54] themselves
[53:55] they're looking not in a mirror of the
[53:57] word they're not even looking in a real
[53:59] mirror but they're looking in a mirror
[54:01] of their own assessment and they're
[54:03] saying you my friend are awesome
[54:06] all day every day you are awesome
[54:09] and you know what you tell yourself
[54:11] something long enough you'll start to
[54:12] believe it
[54:13] it's absolutely true you keep telling
[54:15] yourself what you think you are or what
[54:17] you think you ought to be it'll have an
[54:19] effect now there's a place for that in
[54:20] the believer's life
[54:22] but what you're supposed to be saying is
[54:24] this is what I am now Lord make the
[54:26] mirror reflected but what we have today
[54:28] is we look in the mirror and we say the
[54:30] mirror is wrong and what I say is right
[54:33] no the word of God is what we're
[54:34] supposed to say is right and Lord bring
[54:36] me into subjection make me be what the
[54:39] word says that I am amen
[54:41] and we've spoken many times about this
[54:43] it always makes brother vichel giggle
[54:45] because he's got I think a lot of
[54:46] experience with it and we run into
[54:48] people at work that will tell you how
[54:49] good they are at their job
[54:51] and every work has them every workplace
[54:54] has them they'll tell you how good they
[54:55] are at their job but what you'll realize
[54:58] very quickly is the people that are
[54:59] really good at their job are too busy
[55:01] doing their job to tell you how good
[55:03] they are at their job because they have
[55:05] to do their work and the work of the
[55:07] person that's busy telling you how good
[55:08] they are at their job
[55:09] what is it it's narcissism they're so
[55:12] self-admiring that they can't actually
[55:14] do anything practically good in their
[55:16] life
[55:16] we call it delusions of competency
[55:19] and it's rampant in the world today and
[55:22] we're getting to the place where people
[55:23] want to be paid a hundred thousand
[55:25] dollars to do twenty thousand dollars of
[55:26] work because their opinion of themselves
[55:28] is that I'm worth a hundred thousand
[55:29] dollars
[55:30] and they don't realize the work and
[55:32] effort that it goes it that goes into
[55:34] making that kind of money in the world
[55:35] today
[55:37] look at what the scripture says about
[55:39] this this church age around us in
[55:41] Revelation 3. it says unto the angel of
[55:43] the Church of the laodiceans right these
[55:45] things say at the amen the faithful and
[55:48] true witness the beginning of the
[55:49] creation of God this is the one we have
[55:51] to worry about
[55:52] this is this is the witness I want to
[55:54] say something good about me the one that
[55:57] is the faithful and true witness that
[55:59] doesn't have a bias that isn't swayed by
[56:02] things but they're going to tell you the
[56:04] way it is
[56:05] and it says I Know Thy Works you're
[56:07] neither hot or cold he says I would Thou
[56:10] Art how cold or hot I want you to be one
[56:13] or the other don't be in the middle
[56:16] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[56:19] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[56:21] out of my mouth because thou sayest your
[56:25] self-assessment what you say is in the
[56:27] mirror you say I am rich I am increased
[56:30] with goods and have need of nothing but
[56:33] watch what the faithful and true witness
[56:35] says the faithful and true witness says
[56:38] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[56:40] and miserable and poor and blind and
[56:43] naked notice how the attitude for this
[56:46] age is self-congratulatory you've made
[56:48] it you're what you think you ought to be
[56:50] you're you've arrived you don't have to
[56:53] do anything else you can sit back and
[56:55] relax remember the parable of the rich
[56:57] man and and he built the bigger Burns
[57:00] and bigger Burns and he said my soul
[57:02] take thies and and then God says Thou
[57:05] full you don't know that tonight it'll
[57:07] be your life will be required of you
[57:09] it's the same thing here we're sitting
[57:11] there and we're saying we've got it all
[57:12] we've got it all we've got it all I
[57:14] believe we have it all today we have
[57:16] what we is required to make us into the
[57:18] bride of Christ inside of us and it has
[57:21] been given to us by a seven Church age
[57:23] messenger we have a voice a message
[57:25] that's telling us how to get ready but
[57:27] we can't go into this message thinking
[57:30] we have it all
[57:31] we can't do it and it's the greatest
[57:33] danger I think as being born into a
[57:36] message believing home is that you think
[57:38] you have it because you have it
[57:40] but the idea is not to have it the idea
[57:42] is to be it
[57:46] they say I am rich
[57:48] I am increased with Goods I've got
[57:50] everything but are you what you have
[57:53] because that's what we're looking for in
[57:55] this age amen we're looking to be the
[57:57] faithful and true witness of what he's
[57:59] doing in this age not just what he's
[58:01] brought but we want to be it we don't
[58:02] just want to hear it we read that quote
[58:04] a couple Services ago where brother
[58:06] Brown says that that this idea that they
[58:08] they're they're they think they're rich
[58:10] and increase with goods and have need of
[58:11] nothing that I need of nothing he says
[58:13] means that they either think they have
[58:14] it all or they have enough to be
[58:17] satisfied
[58:18] I'm not satisfied until I'm gone into
[58:20] Rapture church I'm not satisfied until
[58:23] the fullness of the work of God is done
[58:25] in my life and until then I'm going to
[58:27] keep pressing I'm going to keep pushing
[58:28] amen I don't care if I'm going to be 70
[58:30] years old or if I may have 43 I'm going
[58:33] to keep pressing because I know there's
[58:35] more work to be done and that means
[58:36] there's more of God to be expressed in
[58:38] my life amen
[58:40] but what do they believe here in this
[58:41] laodicean church age they believe that
[58:44] what they have is more than sufficient
[58:45] to meet God's standard
[58:49] they believe that they've got what it
[58:51] takes to go in a rapture
[58:53] and yet they're nowhere close
[58:56] it's like the the story of the emperor
[58:58] with no clothes they literally have
[59:00] nothing and they think they have
[59:01] everything
[59:02] and it's because they believed a lie and
[59:04] they've been damned by it and so their
[59:06] eyes are completely blinded and so they
[59:07] only see what's in their imagination it
[59:10] shows that the the way that God measures
[59:13] things is different than the way we do
[59:15] remember the way brother Brown would say
[59:17] the Way Up Is Down and the way down is
[59:19] up
[59:21] and he would say that things like what
[59:23] is what is simple in Man's eyes is great
[59:25] in God's eyes and what's great in God's
[59:27] eyes is simply Man's eyes
[59:29] that we're not going to see it and I
[59:31] believe that the revealing of the Bride
[59:33] in this last age will be it'll deceive
[59:35] everyone because it'll be so simple
[59:37] you know how I get that because Christ
[59:39] was as simple as it comes
[59:41] there was nothing flashy there was
[59:43] nothing outward but though so the the
[59:45] the the signs and the and the works of
[59:47] God followed him but the word was in his
[59:49] mouth as well it was the whole package
[59:50] and the thing is that was in one man but
[59:52] now we've got to spread over hundreds
[59:54] and thousands and maybe hundreds of
[59:56] thousands of people in this world it'll
[59:58] be so small because brother Mark will
[1:00:00] just be a little portion of God
[1:00:03] and brother Bob will be another one and
[1:00:05] sister lydia'll be another one and
[1:00:06] sister Rochelle will be another one and
[1:00:08] people just have to see that little bit
[1:00:10] of light and they'll miss it because
[1:00:12] they'll say how can that be God and yet
[1:00:14] it is literally God in flesh the
[1:00:16] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[1:00:17] of God I've said this before and this is
[1:00:19] just me I believe that full adoption
[1:00:21] will be at the very very end
[1:00:23] because if the world is seen a bunch of
[1:00:26] Believers walking around is fully
[1:00:27] adopted it'd shake the world
[1:00:30] did it shake the world
[1:00:31] and with the way the the the that
[1:00:33] information flows these days it come out
[1:00:36] very quickly who and what we are and
[1:00:38] they'd figure it out
[1:00:39] and all of a sudden they'd be flocking
[1:00:41] in and they'd be accepting it because
[1:00:43] they'd see the proof but the problem is
[1:00:44] the proof always comes after the door's
[1:00:46] shut
[1:00:47] so the door is going to shut and they'll
[1:00:49] say how did we miss it how did we miss
[1:00:51] it you missed it because you were
[1:00:52] looking for the signs and wonders
[1:00:54] instead of the life the hidden life in
[1:00:55] Christ that's the first thing the
[1:00:57] bride's going to have the second thing
[1:00:59] will be second wonders it'll be a hidden
[1:01:00] life first it'll be signs in one or
[1:01:02] second because it always follows these
[1:01:04] signs shall follow them that believe I
[1:01:06] believe in signs and wonders I believe
[1:01:07] it and we've seen it
[1:01:09] but it is a minor not a major and what
[1:01:11] he's looking for is a bride that has his
[1:01:13] life in her first and foremost amen
[1:01:17] look at this story it's a very familiar
[1:01:18] one of the Rich Young Ruler and says
[1:01:20] that when he was gone forth into the way
[1:01:21] there came one running and kneeled to
[1:01:23] him and asked him good Master what shall
[1:01:25] I do that I may inherit eternal life and
[1:01:28] Jesus said unto him why call us thou me
[1:01:30] good there's none good but one and that
[1:01:32] is God thou knowest the Commandments do
[1:01:34] not commit adultery do not kill do not
[1:01:36] steal do not bear false witness defraud
[1:01:38] not honor thy father and thy mother
[1:01:41] and he answered and said unto him master
[1:01:43] all these have I observed from my youth
[1:01:46] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[1:01:48] said unto him one thing thou lackest
[1:01:51] church I would love it if God would come
[1:01:53] to me and say there's only one thing
[1:01:54] you're lacking today John I I would die
[1:01:57] for the day where God came to me and
[1:01:59] said there's only one thing left for you
[1:02:01] to do
[1:02:02] but you know what it is it'll be the
[1:02:04] hardest thing we ever had to do
[1:02:07] it'll be the hardest thing and Watch
[1:02:08] What Happens he says go thy way sell
[1:02:12] whatever thou Hast give it to the poor
[1:02:15] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[1:02:16] and come take up the cross and follow me
[1:02:20] he said everything you've gained
[1:02:22] everything you've earned everything you
[1:02:23] count is good give it away and you get
[1:02:26] no benefit
[1:02:28] you don't get to put money in your
[1:02:30] pocket you don't get to go buy a second
[1:02:31] pair of shoes you don't get to buy a
[1:02:32] winter coat sell it all and come to me
[1:02:35] and you'll have Treasures in Heaven
[1:02:38] no benefit from everything you've done
[1:02:39] Paul said I counted as dung everything I
[1:02:42] brought to him
[1:02:43] worthless unless you're a farmer
[1:02:46] and that young man was sad at that
[1:02:48] saying and went away grieved for he had
[1:02:51] great possessions Jesus said you'll have
[1:02:53] treasure in heaven
[1:02:56] but he valued what he had here his
[1:02:58] treasure he had here more than that you
[1:03:00] see what this was church because
[1:03:02] remember what happened then happens
[1:03:03] today
[1:03:04] he didn't come truly wanting
[1:03:07] eternal life
[1:03:08] what he came wanting was affirmation
[1:03:10] that what he had done was going to do
[1:03:13] the job
[1:03:15] laodicea comes and they say I've done
[1:03:18] what is required and God says no you
[1:03:21] haven't
[1:03:22] he wants affirmation he wanted
[1:03:24] affirmation we want affirmation one of
[1:03:26] the wonderful things we can do with our
[1:03:28] kids is give them affirmation but
[1:03:29] affirmation without correction turns
[1:03:31] them into spoiled brats
[1:03:33] God affirms us all the time he does he
[1:03:36] gives you a pat on the back gives you a
[1:03:38] thumbs up he gives you an amen
[1:03:40] he does that but he also corrects us as
[1:03:42] well and this young man he loved him
[1:03:45] enough to correct him
[1:03:47] he loved him enough to correct him
[1:03:49] to give him the opportunity to show him
[1:03:51] the path to eternal life and that young
[1:03:53] man turned away because he didn't get
[1:03:55] the affirmation and he didn't get the
[1:03:56] answer he wanted
[1:03:58] yet he came with an idea that he was
[1:04:01] still missing something
[1:04:02] and when that something was too big for
[1:04:04] him to give up he walked away sadly and
[1:04:06] brother Brandon would say he's the Rich
[1:04:07] Young he's the rich man who built the
[1:04:09] barns later
[1:04:11] and then he went over and he's on the
[1:04:13] other side and he's in hell and he's
[1:04:14] looking over saying can you send Lazarus
[1:04:16] over with a cup of cold water or just
[1:04:17] dip his finger in because my tongue is
[1:04:19] so hot
[1:04:21] that young man went to hell
[1:04:23] and yet he spoke to the word made flesh
[1:04:26] who told him what to do and he turned it
[1:04:28] down why his assessment of himself was I
[1:04:30] don't need what he told me to do
[1:04:32] that's the latest seeing thing
[1:04:35] he didn't want Direction and he didn't
[1:04:37] want revelation
[1:04:38] he wanted affirmation of where he was at
[1:04:40] as being good enough
[1:04:42] children of God can't be that way
[1:04:43] scripture says so let a man examine
[1:04:46] himself
[1:04:47] not admire himself
[1:04:50] examine himself
[1:04:52] take a look through the word
[1:04:55] take a look through what's coming over
[1:04:57] the pulpit and say am I lining up with
[1:04:59] that does my life genuinely reflect that
[1:05:02] or am I straining to even hold on to
[1:05:04] where I am
[1:05:05] but or is there something that's coming
[1:05:07] out of me that affirms that the word is
[1:05:10] right and I've got to step into it that
[1:05:12] self-affirming nature will take you to
[1:05:14] hell
[1:05:16] it's got to come from the Holy Spirit it
[1:05:17] can't be you that says I'm ready to go
[1:05:19] in a Rapture amen we need to know who we
[1:05:22] are and what we are but we need to know
[1:05:23] it by the revelation of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:24] of this not because we think it of
[1:05:27] ourselves but we have to see what this
[1:05:29] says coming out of our Lives each one
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:33] I read this quote a couple of of
[1:05:35] services ago and and we'll maybe read it
[1:05:37] again in another service because it has
[1:05:39] so many facets to it and there's so many
[1:05:41] angles you can take off it but brother
[1:05:42] Branham says you can never be satisfied
[1:05:45] with the world's Goods in other words
[1:05:47] you'll never be able to say I'm rich and
[1:05:48] increase with goods and that be enough
[1:05:51] you can never be satisfied with
[1:05:54] belonging to a church
[1:05:56] you'll never be satisfied until you've
[1:05:59] found satisfaction in Jesus Christ the
[1:06:02] son of God
[1:06:03] I I I I heard another quote where
[1:06:06] brother Brown said once you receive him
[1:06:09] you can't be satisfied with anything
[1:06:10] else and you can't go back to anything
[1:06:13] else because it has nothing there for
[1:06:15] you
[1:06:17] that has died and now you found new life
[1:06:19] you've found new purpose and so there's
[1:06:21] nothing to go back to it doesn't even
[1:06:23] have an effect on you anymore
[1:06:25] he says the only way you can ever be
[1:06:28] satisfied and then he says now he came
[1:06:30] to bring Perfection now we look at
[1:06:33] Perfection we talked about it as
[1:06:34] maturity
[1:06:36] but he came to bring Perfection we're
[1:06:38] going to talk about what that is in
[1:06:39] future Services because he would say
[1:06:41] perfection is love
[1:06:44] he didn't just come to create it but he
[1:06:47] brought it to bring it he brought it to
[1:06:49] produce it there's a bringing it and
[1:06:51] then there's a producing it and you have
[1:06:53] to see both sides of those things but my
[1:06:55] point here is that if he said he was
[1:06:57] going to do it he's going to do it if
[1:06:59] God said Perfection if God said maturity
[1:07:01] if God said adopted Sons and Daughters
[1:07:03] of God are required then God's going to
[1:07:05] do it he doesn't say it and not do it
[1:07:08] amen the scripture says he's not the son
[1:07:09] of man that he should repent that he
[1:07:11] should take back what he said and he's
[1:07:13] not God he's not like a man that he
[1:07:15] should lie when he says that he's going
[1:07:16] to do it and he's going to give whatever
[1:07:18] is required to bring that to pass in our
[1:07:20] lives
[1:07:22] like I said we're going to miss it so
[1:07:24] often because he does it so simply he
[1:07:26] does it in such a small and humble way
[1:07:28] and it's up to the believer to see that
[1:07:30] the word says this
[1:07:33] not this person says it's going to be
[1:07:35] this way and this one says it's going to
[1:07:36] be that way because they miss it time
[1:07:38] and time again and the prophet of God
[1:07:40] comes and he sells us don't miss it
[1:07:42] don't miss it don't miss it it's so
[1:07:44] humble it's just a a a little Kentucky
[1:07:47] hillbilly with a sixth grade education
[1:07:50] and it's not all great doctrines but
[1:07:52] it's a simple humble Victorious
[1:07:54] Christian Life it's not it's not uh
[1:07:57] Creeds and dogmas and these things are
[1:07:59] going to take it but it's Christ himself
[1:08:01] that's going to get you across the
[1:08:02] finish line
[1:08:04] we have two sets of people in this
[1:08:06] layout to see an agent one of them talks
[1:08:07] about how good they are and then the
[1:08:09] other one says Lord you said
[1:08:11] I'm supposed to be this and now I'm
[1:08:13] looking to you to make me into it
[1:08:15] because we see in our flesh can dwell no
[1:08:17] good thing it's going to take a work
[1:08:19] greater than our our discernment it's
[1:08:21] going to take a work greater than our
[1:08:22] discipline it's going to take something
[1:08:23] that's bigger than we are
[1:08:25] to bring us over the finish line and get
[1:08:27] us into this position of adopted Sons
[1:08:29] and Daughters of God and that approval
[1:08:31] has to be by God himself through the
[1:08:32] Holy Spirit
[1:08:34] we opened up in Romans 8 and it says for
[1:08:36] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:08:38] they are the sons of God
[1:08:41] you've got to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:08:45] now there is a leadership of the Holy
[1:08:46] Spirit through the ministry
[1:08:48] there's a leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:50] through the parents
[1:08:52] but in the end each and every one of us
[1:08:55] has to have our own personal leadership
[1:08:57] for our life now you're going to be
[1:08:59] under headship my sons don't get to say
[1:09:02] I've got the leadership of the Holy
[1:09:03] Spirit to do something without me saying
[1:09:05] yes you're right
[1:09:06] there's headship along those ways but in
[1:09:09] the end each and every one of us is
[1:09:11] supposed to be led by the spirit of God
[1:09:13] Amen that's the starting point of your
[1:09:15] real walk and if you're going to get to
[1:09:17] adoption it's not going to be because
[1:09:18] your pastor did it it's not going to be
[1:09:20] because Mom and Daddy did it it's going
[1:09:22] to be because the Holy Spirit stepped in
[1:09:24] and he quickened what Mommy and Daddy
[1:09:26] have been telling you what the pastor's
[1:09:27] been telling you what the fivefold
[1:09:29] ministry has been telling you and that's
[1:09:30] what brings you to adoption it's not my
[1:09:33] job to bring you to adoption it's not
[1:09:34] mommy and daddy's
[1:09:35] it's the holy spirit's job in your life
[1:09:37] personally to do that and he'll use
[1:09:39] people around you and he'll work with
[1:09:41] you individually where nobody else can
[1:09:42] see it but it's a working of the holy
[1:09:44] spirit that gets us to these those
[1:09:46] points amen
[1:09:48] he says here for you have not received
[1:09:51] the spirit of bondage he didn't say the
[1:09:53] spirit of bondage to fear he said the
[1:09:55] spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:10:00] so that means before you come into the
[1:10:02] spirit there is a bondage of fear
[1:10:04] and I I've told this story many times
[1:10:07] well I'll get to it in a little bit we
[1:10:08] can spend days on just this this little
[1:10:10] scripture here but I want to hit this
[1:10:12] idea of fear really hard and then move
[1:10:14] on because John would say there is no
[1:10:16] fear in love none
[1:10:19] there is zero fear there is no fear not
[1:10:22] a fear does not exist in the love that
[1:10:24] John is talking about he says why but
[1:10:27] perfect love
[1:10:28] perfect love not mommy and daddy's love
[1:10:31] not a spousal love but perfect love
[1:10:34] casteth out fear why because fear had
[1:10:37] torment
[1:10:39] but he that feareth is not made perfect
[1:10:41] in love we're talking about this idea of
[1:10:43] the stamp of approval and when we look
[1:10:45] at the adoption process it has an effect
[1:10:48] you cannot go through the tutoring the
[1:10:50] the training of the Holy Spirit and come
[1:10:52] out the way you went in
[1:10:54] you've got to come out different
[1:10:55] otherwise you're not ready for adoption
[1:10:58] and it's something that's real it's
[1:10:59] something that's tangible you know in
[1:11:01] your heart of hearts and in your mind of
[1:11:02] Minds what you desire and what you don't
[1:11:04] desire you know what you think and what
[1:11:06] you don't think we only get to see the
[1:11:08] facial expressions and see the things
[1:11:10] you do with your hands and feet and the
[1:11:11] words that come out of your mouth but
[1:11:12] we're looking for something that's
[1:11:14] changed in here not just outward
[1:11:16] conformity
[1:11:17] that's what the Holy Spirit does is he
[1:11:19] changes the inward man to produce
[1:11:21] something on the outside that is
[1:11:22] supposed to look like a Christian but we
[1:11:24] can put on an outward man that has
[1:11:27] nothing to do with the Holy Spirit and
[1:11:28] say I'm a Child of God that's when you
[1:11:30] say I'm rich and increase with goods and
[1:11:31] have need of nothing because you put it
[1:11:32] on but it's not coming out of you
[1:11:35] but this this process of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:37] working in our lives has tangible
[1:11:38] benefits and Paul says one of the or
[1:11:41] John says one of the benefits here is
[1:11:43] that you come out and you don't fear a
[1:11:45] thing
[1:11:46] there is nothing that holds you back and
[1:11:48] and Paul would say you know neither
[1:11:50] neither uh you know fears or famines or
[1:11:53] powers or principalities or all these
[1:11:55] things none of them will hold us back
[1:11:56] from the from the love that is in God
[1:11:58] and so we look at situations and it
[1:12:01] doesn't cause us to fear because why we
[1:12:03] are in the perfect love that is Christ
[1:12:05] and that's saying it doesn't matter what
[1:12:07] this looks like it doesn't matter what's
[1:12:08] going on perfect love is going to take
[1:12:10] us through and it's going to be for our
[1:12:12] good he says you don't walk in with a
[1:12:14] spirit of fear you walk in with a spirit
[1:12:16] of love and that's what carries you
[1:12:17] through these things
[1:12:19] but if we look at even the very work of
[1:12:21] God we have filial love we have human
[1:12:23] love and that's dependent on what we do
[1:12:25] but the scripture says that while we
[1:12:27] were yet sinners God loved us and he
[1:12:29] gave his life for us and we see that
[1:12:31] God's love is independent of our actions
[1:12:33] it's independent of what we think of
[1:12:35] what we don't think about how we feel
[1:12:37] his love cannot be stopped it cannot be
[1:12:40] exhausted and it cannot be outgrown it
[1:12:42] cannot be outrun his love is there and
[1:12:44] it's constantly working regardless of
[1:12:46] what we think
[1:12:47] it's a love that we can't understand
[1:12:49] until we get to this place
[1:12:52] and when you come into Christ you start
[1:12:54] to experience it but remember brother
[1:12:55] Brandon would say having gone over to
[1:12:57] the other side and he said only perfect
[1:12:58] love can enter there he says it's but a
[1:13:01] shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:13:04] shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:13:07] shadow of what you have here today
[1:13:10] he says what you have there when you are
[1:13:12] fully in that place in a perfect body he
[1:13:16] says everything here is eight times
[1:13:18] removed from it it's a bit of a bit of a
[1:13:21] bit of a bit of a bit of a bit we've got
[1:13:22] just a drop of this ocean of what it
[1:13:24] means to be in perfect love that's how
[1:13:26] big he says that's how perfect it is
[1:13:28] it's it's something that completely
[1:13:29] overwhelms he says it's so overwhelming
[1:13:31] that a woman could hug me and I wouldn't
[1:13:33] feel a thing
[1:13:36] he says there's none of that is there
[1:13:38] it's so completely encompasses you and
[1:13:41] erases every bit of Filth or sensuality
[1:13:43] or this physical thing that we call love
[1:13:46] he says and it's perfect and you just
[1:13:48] don't he says don't miss it don't miss
[1:13:51] it what I experience he says don't miss
[1:13:53] it that was the greatest thing that he
[1:13:55] could say don't miss it
[1:13:57] what was over there you don't want to
[1:13:58] miss it because it's so far greater than
[1:14:00] every experience in the Holy Ghost you
[1:14:02] have every wonderful service every
[1:14:04] moment on your knees in prayer he says
[1:14:06] it's bigger than all that it is perfect
[1:14:08] and that's what we're coming into that's
[1:14:10] the Perfection that we're looking for
[1:14:12] amen but it's independent of us that's
[1:14:14] the beauty of it because if it was
[1:14:16] dependent on me it ain't going to be
[1:14:17] perfect
[1:14:18] and it ain't going to be whole
[1:14:21] I'll hold it back but this is something
[1:14:23] that overwhelms us completely
[1:14:26] Romans 8 5 8 this is what I was talking
[1:14:28] about but God commendeth his love toward
[1:14:30] us in that while we were yet sinners
[1:14:32] Christ died for us that word commendeth
[1:14:34] means to prove or exhibit to establish
[1:14:38] and confirm so Paul's saying that God
[1:14:40] exhibited is love he proved his love by
[1:14:42] showing that love when we were Unworthy
[1:14:45] of it when we weren't looking for it
[1:14:46] when we didn't deserve it
[1:14:48] this love is not dependent on our
[1:14:50] deserving it
[1:14:52] it's dependent on his predestinated will
[1:14:54] is is dependent on him saying you're a
[1:14:58] part of me therefore I love you
[1:15:00] not on what we're doing at that
[1:15:01] particular day or that moment when we
[1:15:03] can't stop it like I said we can't
[1:15:05] exhaust it we can't outrun it we can't
[1:15:07] outwork it we can't do anything that
[1:15:09] would stop the love of God from having
[1:15:11] its effect in our lives that's how
[1:15:12] perfect it is
[1:15:14] and really Perfection comes when we
[1:15:15] accept it
[1:15:17] and we let it do in us what he's been
[1:15:20] trying to do all along
[1:15:21] and we understand that whether it's a
[1:15:23] spanking he's giving us or whether it's
[1:15:25] a beautiful steak and a nice sit down
[1:15:28] it's all for our good
[1:15:30] and we start to accept that this love is
[1:15:32] in it for us not just for him
[1:15:35] but Paul John would say that that
[1:15:37] perfect love casts out that fear and
[1:15:40] that's the first thing you'll notice if
[1:15:42] you think back to to when you first got
[1:15:43] the Holy Ghost is the first thing it
[1:15:46] does is it takes fear out I've said many
[1:15:48] times because I find it funny that I was
[1:15:50] always scared that I wouldn't like being
[1:15:51] a Christian
[1:15:53] what's a reasonable question to a German
[1:15:56] I don't want to spend all this effort
[1:15:58] and go into it if I'm not going to like
[1:15:59] it and I don't want to go in if I'm
[1:16:01] going to back out and I didn't know if I
[1:16:02] was going to like it but the secret was
[1:16:04] if I wanted it it's because I was going
[1:16:06] to like it and I was miserable where I
[1:16:08] was at so what's the harm
[1:16:10] you know but I I've spoken many times
[1:16:12] about the the fear that God works on and
[1:16:15] the first thing that that he took from
[1:16:16] me and this is my testimony is that I
[1:16:19] had that recurring fear and it was in a
[1:16:21] nightmare every night almost and I would
[1:16:24] be falling falling falling and it was in
[1:16:26] a place of great Blackness and I was
[1:16:28] completely alone and there was nobody
[1:16:30] around and as I was falling and falling
[1:16:32] never going to hit anything never going
[1:16:34] to end there was it was so quiet that it
[1:16:37] was loud and that's the only way I can
[1:16:39] say it and there was a loudness building
[1:16:41] in the silence and it was an
[1:16:43] overwhelming sense of impending doom
[1:16:46] and it wasn't until I read in the
[1:16:48] scripture or in the message where
[1:16:49] brother Branham said hell he says you
[1:16:51] are alone with your thoughts and you're
[1:16:53] alone with the the knowledge of
[1:16:55] everything you've done wrong
[1:16:56] and he says you're falling and falling
[1:16:58] and falling and there's nothing to catch
[1:17:00] you and what I realized was that it went
[1:17:01] after I got baptized and received the
[1:17:03] Holy Spirit that dream went away forever
[1:17:05] and I have never ever ever ever ever
[1:17:07] ever had it again God is my witness
[1:17:10] why he took fear out of my eternal
[1:17:13] destination out of me when I didn't even
[1:17:15] know what that fear was
[1:17:17] sometimes they say the greatest way to
[1:17:18] beat your fears to is to face it I
[1:17:20] didn't even know what it was and yet he
[1:17:22] took it away because what my eternal
[1:17:24] destination was settled from that moment
[1:17:26] in my heart and so fear can't rest there
[1:17:29] anymore
[1:17:30] but it was a horrible thing to wake up
[1:17:32] in the middle of the night with the
[1:17:33] sweats because you didn't realize you
[1:17:35] were so scared and you didn't know why
[1:17:37] and you didn't know what was causing
[1:17:38] these things
[1:17:40] but Paul or John is talking about
[1:17:42] something else because Satan's a tricky
[1:17:44] one if he can't get you there he'll get
[1:17:45] you someplace else and you lose one fear
[1:17:47] and he adds a new fear on
[1:17:49] and the greatest fear he does is he he
[1:17:51] puts us in a place where we think that
[1:17:53] our Salvation is dependent on our
[1:17:55] actions
[1:17:56] where we think that our position in
[1:17:59] Christ is dependent on what we do day to
[1:18:00] day
[1:18:02] that's a reflection of who we are
[1:18:04] but that's not what gets us in
[1:18:07] How I Live my day every day is a
[1:18:09] reflection of where my walk is in Christ
[1:18:12] but remember he said you can be a Son of
[1:18:14] God and never come to adoption
[1:18:16] and you'll be a son all the rest of your
[1:18:17] days but you'll never be adopted into
[1:18:19] the family but you'll still make it and
[1:18:21] he would talk about those that that
[1:18:23] preacher that gave up he got hurt he got
[1:18:25] offended somehow and he says that's it
[1:18:27] I'm done with it and he says I'm I'm not
[1:18:29] going back to it and three weeks later
[1:18:31] he got run over by a truck why because
[1:18:33] God won't let his son stay there in that
[1:18:35] condition he takes them home
[1:18:39] and you'll see that many times as
[1:18:40] somebody will come to the Lord and boom
[1:18:42] God takes them
[1:18:43] because he just had to get them in and
[1:18:45] then that son was never going to make it
[1:18:47] that daughter was never going to be
[1:18:48] where they needed to be or where they
[1:18:50] ought to be as a Believer and so he gets
[1:18:52] them in he seals them and then he takes
[1:18:53] them away
[1:18:57] but this ideas of Satan is he'll take
[1:18:59] away that old fear that old fear is gone
[1:19:01] he can't have that anymore and so he'll
[1:19:02] replace it with a new fear and Paul's
[1:19:04] saying listen
[1:19:06] this this spirit that you have
[1:19:08] it takes away fears
[1:19:10] it's a fear taking spirit
[1:19:12] Satan is a fair giving spirit
[1:19:15] the Holy Spirit takes it away that's its
[1:19:17] job is to take away fears out of our
[1:19:19] Lives amen
[1:19:20] brother Brown would say this he's
[1:19:21] speaking of this fear
[1:19:22] what's this fear oh I wonder if I can
[1:19:25] just hold out oh if I can just hold out
[1:19:28] now
[1:19:29] he said hold on nothing
[1:19:32] it isn't whether I held out it's whether
[1:19:35] he held out he says I'm in him now see
[1:19:39] because Satan replaces it with you've
[1:19:41] got to work your way into this now
[1:19:43] you're a Son of God you're a daughter of
[1:19:45] God you've got to do this and you got to
[1:19:46] do that and you got to do this and you
[1:19:47] got to do that and he puts pressure on
[1:19:49] you to do it and when you don't do it he
[1:19:51] says now you better get back on that
[1:19:53] because if you don't you're not a done
[1:19:54] of Son of God you're not a daughter of
[1:19:56] God and he puts a fear that you've got
[1:19:58] to do all of this to make it across
[1:20:00] brother says no no it's not about
[1:20:02] whether I hold on to him he held on to
[1:20:04] me he wants you to put your hand out he
[1:20:06] wants you to grab but even if I let go
[1:20:08] he's still got my wrist he's going to
[1:20:10] hold on to me he's not going to let me
[1:20:11] slip back into Hellfire
[1:20:13] he's not going to do that
[1:20:17] if we look at Romans 15 it takes us to
[1:20:19] the conclusion of this and it says for
[1:20:20] you have not received the spirit of
[1:20:22] bondage again to fear but you have the
[1:20:25] spirit of adoption have received the
[1:20:27] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[1:20:30] father so one is a spirit that binds you
[1:20:33] it enslaves you to fear over and over
[1:20:36] and over again and this world is filled
[1:20:38] with fears it is filled with fears
[1:20:40] Everybody's scared of everything they're
[1:20:43] scared about climate change they're
[1:20:44] scared about economies they're scared
[1:20:46] about politics they're scared about
[1:20:47] health they're scared about viruses
[1:20:49] they're scared about what their kids
[1:20:50] going to be like what their kids not
[1:20:51] going to be like they're scared about
[1:20:53] their marriages because most of them
[1:20:54] fail these days
[1:20:56] they're failed about whether they're
[1:20:57] going to have a job tomorrow
[1:20:59] they're worried about whether they can
[1:21:01] pay their mortgage tomorrow if they can
[1:21:02] afford groceries
[1:21:03] everything is fear fear fear fear fear
[1:21:06] and he and Paul comes back to us he says
[1:21:08] no your spirit says
[1:21:11] dad
[1:21:12] father
[1:21:14] you called me to this
[1:21:16] the path I'm walking on the place I'm in
[1:21:18] the people I'm with the things I'm doing
[1:21:20] they are of your doing they are of your
[1:21:23] placing they're in your training program
[1:21:25] and so I'm coming to you and I'm saying
[1:21:27] you started it I'm trusting you to
[1:21:29] finish it
[1:21:30] no not in this like no no you better do
[1:21:33] it no it's I'm trusting I'm believing
[1:21:36] I'm expecting I'm confessing amen
[1:21:39] this is your work not my work I'll do
[1:21:42] everything I can but in the end it's you
[1:21:44] that's going to do the finishing it's
[1:21:45] not me I'm just trying to surrender
[1:21:47] myself and get me across the line you're
[1:21:49] the father I'm in your kingdom I came
[1:21:52] out of my kingdom I came out of Satan's
[1:21:53] kingdom and I came into yours that makes
[1:21:55] you responsible for me and I'm here to
[1:21:58] claim that responsibility
[1:22:00] the worst thing you can do is say I'm
[1:22:02] going to do it
[1:22:03] you go to him and say Lord I'm trusting
[1:22:05] you to do it I'll do everything I can
[1:22:07] but my life is in your hands the effect
[1:22:10] is in your hands the result is in your
[1:22:12] hands because it's a supernatural work
[1:22:13] that we're looking for in our lives
[1:22:16] program says someone said not long ago
[1:22:18] when I was in Phoenix the prayer lines
[1:22:20] were way down the streets they couldn't
[1:22:21] even get into the auditorium going in
[1:22:23] the line someone said are you aren't you
[1:22:25] afraid brother Branham to stand there
[1:22:27] before all those things and realize that
[1:22:29] critics are standing there and newspaper
[1:22:31] report reporters and so forth to
[1:22:33] criticize
[1:22:35] I said I'm Not Afraid as long as I feel
[1:22:39] that he's near
[1:22:40] but if I can't feel him I will get off
[1:22:43] the platform and go home
[1:22:45] he's a prophet of God to the age he's
[1:22:48] the seventh Church age messenger and he
[1:22:50] says if he's not there I'll go
[1:22:53] but if he's there I'll stay there as
[1:22:55] long as he's there and I won't worry
[1:22:57] about a thing
[1:22:59] church if he's in your life you don't
[1:23:01] have to worry about a thing now he says
[1:23:03] feel him now remember brother I'm
[1:23:05] speaking of a different thing because
[1:23:06] he'd say I know him he says he's here
[1:23:08] now and this is not just a general
[1:23:11] concept but this is the personal
[1:23:12] presence of the Angel of the Lord he
[1:23:15] says that's what's required to make this
[1:23:16] gift work
[1:23:18] and he says as long as he's here then we
[1:23:20] can do it all it'll happen because it's
[1:23:22] not me doing it it's him that's doing it
[1:23:23] but if he goes away so he's not talking
[1:23:25] about do you feel like the holy spirit's
[1:23:27] here we're not going by feelings we're
[1:23:29] not going by what we see or or by
[1:23:30] whether we get the tinglies or the hairs
[1:23:32] on our arms or the back of our neck go
[1:23:33] up that's not what he's talking about he
[1:23:35] was saying I need to know that the angel
[1:23:37] of the Lord is present because he's the
[1:23:38] one that's doing everything that happens
[1:23:40] in these meetings he can preach that's
[1:23:42] not a problem he's anointed to preach
[1:23:44] but to do those Works he says that takes
[1:23:46] the personal presence to be here he says
[1:23:48] as long as he's there I don't have any
[1:23:49] fear it drives it away
[1:23:52] what was it
[1:23:54] what are we looking at here Church we're
[1:23:55] talking about what the indwelling
[1:23:57] presence of the Holy Spirit confirming
[1:23:59] to you you don't have to be afraid
[1:24:01] you don't have to be afraid
[1:24:03] but you've got to know that you've got
[1:24:05] it
[1:24:06] and Satan will challenge you on that
[1:24:07] point day in and day out do you have the
[1:24:09] Holy Ghost do you have the Holy Ghost do
[1:24:12] you have the Holy Ghost you don't have
[1:24:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:24:16] he wouldn't do that and he wouldn't do
[1:24:18] that and he wouldn't do that and you
[1:24:19] know what he's right he wouldn't do that
[1:24:22] but he's still working on me
[1:24:24] he's still working on me and you say yes
[1:24:27] he wouldn't do that that's why I'm
[1:24:28] repenting of it and that's why I'm
[1:24:30] trying not to do it anymore and there's
[1:24:32] a desire in me that is wanting to get
[1:24:34] right with the word of God and that's
[1:24:36] what confirms the holy spirit in my life
[1:24:38] not that I am perfect but that is taking
[1:24:40] me into that which is perfect bit by bit
[1:24:43] footsteps his possession I've said it
[1:24:45] many times in the last months take one
[1:24:47] step a day towards God
[1:24:49] just one step
[1:24:51] don't hold still don't go back take one
[1:24:54] step and if you get two or three praise
[1:24:56] the Lord but take one step a day towards
[1:24:58] God and step into his word and you'll
[1:24:59] start to see that those results
[1:25:01] it's um you know I used to to play a lot
[1:25:04] of games
[1:25:06] on the computer and these different
[1:25:08] things and and in a lot of games you had
[1:25:10] to pay to get anywhere if you wanted to
[1:25:12] get there quickly but what I realized is
[1:25:14] they'll give you little dribs and drabs
[1:25:15] all along for free
[1:25:17] and so being an engineer I did the math
[1:25:19] and I said if I play this game for 120
[1:25:21] days I can do that rather than pay the
[1:25:23] 20 bucks right now so I just go in and
[1:25:25] get the free thing every day and 120
[1:25:26] days later I could buy whatever it is I
[1:25:28] wanted or do whatever I wanted it sounds
[1:25:29] silly I know but that's the point is is
[1:25:32] that bit by bit gets you there
[1:25:35] that that consistency that one footstep
[1:25:38] a day will get you there I was I was
[1:25:40] down in a conference I'm in conference
[1:25:41] three days this week for work and we
[1:25:43] finished early yesterday and I I said
[1:25:45] you know I didn't get to go to the gym
[1:25:47] I've been sitting all day I've been
[1:25:48] eating all day I've been listening all
[1:25:50] day I need to get some exercise so I
[1:25:52] looked up on my phone because I said
[1:25:53] maybe I can walk up and meet Selena
[1:25:55] where she works rather than have her
[1:25:56] drive down to pick me up looked it up
[1:25:58] and it says sure you can do that in 34
[1:26:00] 35 minutes I said I'm going for a walk
[1:26:03] then and I walked all the way up
[1:26:04] barter's hill all the way up to the old
[1:26:07] stadium where we used to play with the
[1:26:08] seven day Venice all the way up to the
[1:26:10] old Dublin Bakery and down by the old
[1:26:12] schools and I walked all the way to work
[1:26:15] but somebody had to stop I had to stop
[1:26:16] and say it really isn't that far
[1:26:19] and I'm walking up the uh barter's Hill
[1:26:21] the steepest hill in St John's as far as
[1:26:23] I know and I'm wearing my bluntstone
[1:26:25] boots now contrary to the song those
[1:26:27] boots are not made for walking
[1:26:30] they are meant to go two and a half
[1:26:32] kilometers up with half of it uphill
[1:26:34] almost
[1:26:35] but guess what I had started
[1:26:38] and I wasn't going back
[1:26:40] so it was just one foot in front of the
[1:26:42] other my calves are aching my thighs are
[1:26:45] aching I'm sweating
[1:26:47] but I'm like I'm gonna get there I
[1:26:51] started on this journey and I'm gonna go
[1:26:52] there's just one foot in front of the
[1:26:54] other when I went sheep hunting with
[1:26:55] brother Jethro Steven way back in
[1:26:57] Alberta we'd climb up mountains I think
[1:26:59] we we climbed seven thousand feet in a
[1:27:01] day something like that seven thousand
[1:27:03] feet
[1:27:04] you know how you climb a mountain church
[1:27:06] one step at a time
[1:27:10] because if you stop there and said it's
[1:27:12] going to take me 13
[1:27:13] 326 steps to get to the top of that
[1:27:16] mountain in the next four hours you'd
[1:27:18] quit because thirteen thousand is too
[1:27:20] many steps but when you just do one step
[1:27:22] at a time
[1:27:25] four hours later you're there
[1:27:27] but if you're counting thirteen thousand
[1:27:29] three hundred twenty eight thirteen
[1:27:30] thousand three hundred twenty seven
[1:27:31] thirteen thousand three hundred twenty
[1:27:33] six you get pretty tired out in a hurry
[1:27:35] because you're so focused on how long
[1:27:36] it's going to take rather than just
[1:27:38] trying to put one foot in front of the
[1:27:39] other
[1:27:40] your walk is one foot in front of the
[1:27:42] other getting to the finish line is just
[1:27:44] one foot in front of the other
[1:27:46] it's not a race
[1:27:47] it's who finishes
[1:27:49] that's what this is all about amen I'm
[1:27:51] not sure how I got off there I'll be
[1:27:52] honest
[1:27:53] One Foot In Front of the other
[1:27:56] if you know he's with you if you know he
[1:27:58] started you on the work just one foot in
[1:28:01] front of the other and when you don't
[1:28:03] feel like you can do it
[1:28:04] what do you say take my hand
[1:28:07] precious Lord
[1:28:09] and lead me home
[1:28:10] that's it
[1:28:12] sometimes that's all you need this
[1:28:13] brother Jethro I was hunting with he had
[1:28:15] he had an accident and he cracked his
[1:28:17] pelvis
[1:28:19] and he was hiking with a cracked pelvis
[1:28:21] and every step I was near him because
[1:28:25] I'm I didn't have a cracked pelvis
[1:28:27] so I was this is me this is my first
[1:28:30] Mountain hunt so I'd walk fairly quickly
[1:28:32] and then I'd stop
[1:28:35] and then he'd catch up and then as soon
[1:28:36] as he caught up I go again so it was
[1:28:38] just back and forth back and forth like
[1:28:39] an accordion but I'd hear him coming up
[1:28:41] and go
[1:28:43] and he was in excruciating pain from his
[1:28:46] pelvis and he climbed seven thousand
[1:28:49] feet with a cracked pelvis because he
[1:28:51] wanted to go hunting
[1:28:53] if he can do that about hunting
[1:28:56] what can we do
[1:28:58] when it comes to our Christian walk
[1:29:00] every step was Agony for him
[1:29:03] but he wanted to go hunting bad enough
[1:29:05] that he put up with it
[1:29:08] and he couldn't he couldn't even
[1:29:10] suppress it that's how painful it was
[1:29:11] and if anybody knows Jethro Jethro can
[1:29:14] take a beating
[1:29:15] this this guy is tough he's lean he's
[1:29:18] he's a he's just a a country boy that
[1:29:21] knows the Wilderness he's a hard worker
[1:29:24] fastest worker best worker I've ever
[1:29:25] been around he's a tough guy and if he's
[1:29:28] laying out that little moan of pain it's
[1:29:30] because he's hurting bad because he'd
[1:29:32] never let it out of his own will and
[1:29:34] he's up there and he's climbing up 7 000
[1:29:36] feet because he wants to go hunting
[1:29:40] like Paul said we haven't resisted under
[1:29:42] blood yet
[1:29:44] I think we can toughen up sometimes
[1:29:47] but Paul would say God is love
[1:29:49] when we ain't Tough Enough
[1:29:51] when we get sick and tired
[1:29:54] God is love
[1:29:55] and he grabs a hold of us he says I'm
[1:29:57] going to drag you sometimes we'll get
[1:29:59] through the mud together
[1:30:00] we'll get through the hard times
[1:30:01] together we'll get over the hill
[1:30:02] together
[1:30:04] that's how you know you pass from Death
[1:30:06] onto life
[1:30:07] when that fear goes away you say I can't
[1:30:09] make it Lord I Need You Now
[1:30:11] that's really when you start to grow is
[1:30:13] when you say Lord I need you to get over
[1:30:14] this
[1:30:15] that I really can't do it on my own
[1:30:18] but in Romans 8 it says the spirit
[1:30:20] itself beareth Witness
[1:30:24] not me
[1:30:25] it says the Holy Spirit Bears witness
[1:30:28] with our spirit that we are a child of
[1:30:32] God
[1:30:33] it's not my self-assessment it's the
[1:30:35] Holy Spirit confirming to me that I'm a
[1:30:37] child of God and I've got to have that
[1:30:40] as Germanic as I am and as disciplined
[1:30:42] as I am I've got to have that
[1:30:43] encouragement I've got to have that
[1:30:45] constancy saying you're doing okay
[1:30:48] you could do better but you're doing
[1:30:50] okay you move forward today you didn't
[1:30:52] go backward and you didn't stand still
[1:30:54] and that's what it does and we look into
[1:30:55] the word and these things and we look at
[1:30:58] the witness of the holy spirit in our
[1:30:59] life and we ought to be seeing some
[1:31:01] affirmation because we're supposed to be
[1:31:03] changing from Glory unto Glory
[1:31:05] so we should see those affirmations but
[1:31:07] it's not going to be constant
[1:31:09] it's not going to be constant
[1:31:11] but if the holy spirit is there to Bear
[1:31:13] witness to us
[1:31:15] and we see the drama that brother
[1:31:16] Brandon would talk about of of the of
[1:31:18] the the tutor coming to the father and
[1:31:21] these different things and he has a
[1:31:22] quota where he says now what because we
[1:31:24] talked about what happens if the kid was
[1:31:25] no good
[1:31:26] but what if the kid was good
[1:31:28] let's talk about that he says now what
[1:31:30] if the child had done good
[1:31:32] oh how the Holy Spirit likes to bring
[1:31:34] their character how the teacher would
[1:31:37] like to come to the father and say are
[1:31:38] you the father of this child I am all
[1:31:41] right well I want to tell you that
[1:31:43] little fellow is one of the smartest
[1:31:44] little chaps I've ever seen oh even
[1:31:47] though he's youthful
[1:31:49] he's just a chip off the old block
[1:31:52] that's all he loves you
[1:31:56] he's just exactly like you he's about
[1:31:59] your business he stands just exactly
[1:32:01] firm on what you say why he says he's
[1:32:04] just like you let's just stop for a
[1:32:06] second looking that we're talking about
[1:32:08] being a children of God and the witness
[1:32:10] of the holy spirit is supposed to be
[1:32:12] you're just like Christ
[1:32:15] the way we talked about in the in the
[1:32:16] past recently how this word Christian
[1:32:18] has become something that has no meaning
[1:32:20] anymore because you call yourself a
[1:32:22] Christian but there's a witness of the
[1:32:24] holy spirit that says you're just like
[1:32:26] here you're just like your daddy you're
[1:32:28] just like Christ you're a Christian
[1:32:31] you're christ-like your life is a
[1:32:33] reflection of his life you're just like
[1:32:36] him you're a chip off the old block
[1:32:38] what'd he say yes he's Young
[1:32:41] yes she's young yes she's still in
[1:32:44] school
[1:32:45] but she's just like you she's just like
[1:32:48] you when you were little too
[1:32:50] and what is it it's a sign that the seed
[1:32:52] of the father is in you that you came
[1:32:54] from him and you're going back to him
[1:32:57] the pattern of our life ought to reflect
[1:32:59] what's in the word
[1:33:00] it's that simple not a pattern of our
[1:33:02] own choosing but a pattern that's in the
[1:33:04] word and then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:33:06] behind that and confirms it to us he
[1:33:08] says how that teacher likes to say that
[1:33:10] what do you think that father thinks
[1:33:12] swells out his chest and says That's my
[1:33:14] boy
[1:33:15] oh God he says how I hope I can be
[1:33:18] obedient enough till the father will be
[1:33:21] pleased with what I did
[1:33:23] he says I hope that you're obedient
[1:33:25] enough that it'll please God we're
[1:33:27] looking at the witness we're looking at
[1:33:28] the stamp of approval we're looking at
[1:33:30] what is the holy spirit going to be
[1:33:32] saying about our lives as we come up to
[1:33:33] adoption
[1:33:34] what was the first witness he had here
[1:33:36] if we look at this last quote the first
[1:33:39] thing he says is he loves you
[1:33:43] you love God
[1:33:45] and you can't love God and not love his
[1:33:47] word
[1:33:47] and you can't love God and not love the
[1:33:49] people of God it's the two things that
[1:33:52] are impossible to be a Christian you
[1:33:54] cannot love the Saints and you cannot
[1:33:55] love the word you can't not love those
[1:33:57] things and be a Christian it is
[1:33:59] impossible it is impossible to do those
[1:34:02] things
[1:34:03] John said this is how they'll know
[1:34:05] you're my disciples by your love one for
[1:34:07] another
[1:34:08] that's the way it's supposed to look but
[1:34:10] it can't be me saying that it's got to
[1:34:11] be him saying it and what is it
[1:34:14] it's us saying We Love You by Our Lives
[1:34:17] not just our mouth mouth is easy I can
[1:34:20] say I love Blanca but I've got to act it
[1:34:22] for her to believe it
[1:34:24] she took my word on it initially but now
[1:34:27] I've got to live it through our marriage
[1:34:28] to say I truly love you regardless of
[1:34:30] what you do regardless of what you say
[1:34:32] regardless of how you change good or bad
[1:34:33] it doesn't matter I've got to love her
[1:34:35] I've got to back up those words and it's
[1:34:37] the same thing for god notice he said he
[1:34:39] loves you and then he said he's just
[1:34:41] like you he likes the things you like
[1:34:42] he's just like you were he's a chip off
[1:34:44] the old block that proves your love is
[1:34:46] what follows
[1:34:48] that love
[1:34:49] that expression of love
[1:34:53] I remember brother Ron Spencer he talks
[1:34:56] to a lot of young men and you know young
[1:34:58] ministers to help them get started and
[1:35:01] encourage them along the way and the
[1:35:03] most common thing he'll say young men
[1:35:04] come to him they say brother Ron how do
[1:35:06] I grow in my Ministry how do I really be
[1:35:09] a minister you know what he says
[1:35:11] simplest thing in the world fall in love
[1:35:14] with Jesus
[1:35:16] fall in love with Jesus
[1:35:18] and then when you do that he says get
[1:35:20] into the word
[1:35:23] because what happens is we get into the
[1:35:24] word and we don't have a personal
[1:35:25] relationship and all of a sudden what's
[1:35:27] coming over this is intellect and pride
[1:35:29] gets attached to it and influence gets
[1:35:31] attached to it and all of a sudden it's
[1:35:32] about me me me and there's no love there
[1:35:34] because remember this is all about
[1:35:36] Redemption it's about restoration of
[1:35:38] relationship and what's he saying he's
[1:35:40] saying ministers fall in love with
[1:35:41] Christ
[1:35:43] get personal in your relationship fall
[1:35:45] in love with his presence fall in love
[1:35:48] with his leadership fall in love with
[1:35:49] his word to the point where you'll value
[1:35:51] that above everything else because
[1:35:53] that's what it's going to take each one
[1:35:55] of us has to have that it's not
[1:35:56] exclusive to the ministry by any means
[1:35:58] but the problem is is that the ministry
[1:35:59] could get pulled so easily by money by
[1:36:02] popularity and by women what loves of
[1:36:05] other things he's saying Get Your Love
[1:36:07] settled and everything else will fall
[1:36:08] into place
[1:36:10] it's that simple it's that simple fall
[1:36:12] in love with Jesus I think that's a
[1:36:13] great thing to say to our young people
[1:36:14] to all of us are you in love with Christ
[1:36:18] not are you in love with the message and
[1:36:21] the doctrines of the message because
[1:36:22] guess what we can fall in love with
[1:36:24] those things we can fall in love with
[1:36:26] learning we can fall in love with heady
[1:36:28] revelation we can fall in love with the
[1:36:29] other side of things we can fall in love
[1:36:31] with emotional services and shouting and
[1:36:33] hollering and dancing none of them wrong
[1:36:35] but we can fall in love with those
[1:36:38] things we can fall in love with the
[1:36:40] emotion of love
[1:36:42] and we can't stand to do what love is
[1:36:44] which is sacrifice
[1:36:47] it's to put selfishness down under your
[1:36:49] foot and kill it that's what love is
[1:36:51] selfishness goes out the window
[1:36:54] so with love we can fall in love with
[1:36:56] the feeling of it or the thought of it
[1:36:58] or the belief of it or the anticipation
[1:37:01] of it but when it comes to our door true
[1:37:03] love is found in how we act not in what
[1:37:05] we say and do
[1:37:07] and so those Temptations for ministers
[1:37:09] those three things that's what they've
[1:37:11] got to guard against and so they've got
[1:37:12] to be in love with something else that
[1:37:13] never lets that come in between them and
[1:37:15] God
[1:37:17] he would say in first John 2 he says
[1:37:19] love not the world neither the things
[1:37:21] that are in the world if any man love
[1:37:22] the world the love of the father is not
[1:37:24] in him for all that is in the world the
[1:37:27] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:37:29] and the pride of life is not of the
[1:37:31] father but is of the world and the world
[1:37:33] passeth away in the lust thereof but he
[1:37:35] that doeth the will of God abideth
[1:37:39] forever
[1:37:41] there's a wonderful quote here
[1:37:44] because we're we we talked about sister
[1:37:46] Delfina and they had to do a transcript
[1:37:47] review for her to graduate
[1:37:50] and there's a transcript review that
[1:37:52] goes on by the Holy Spirit if I could
[1:37:53] put that this way brother Bradham speaks
[1:37:56] of this in the in adoption number two
[1:37:59] and the father says oh that's my son
[1:38:01] that's my boy well you think he's well
[1:38:03] matured yup shirt who said the Holy
[1:38:05] Spirit I give him tests boy I tried them
[1:38:08] this way tried them that way now listen
[1:38:10] to the transcript I throw him down Sick
[1:38:13] I put him under
[1:38:16] I stomped him
[1:38:20] stomping 101. one of the classes that
[1:38:23] Sons and Daughters of God go through I
[1:38:25] let the devil do everything to him he
[1:38:28] could do
[1:38:29] also wasn't the Holy Spirit doing it was
[1:38:31] the devil doing it
[1:38:33] but the holy spirit let it
[1:38:36] the holy spirit let it he says that's
[1:38:38] the class you got to go through stomping
[1:38:39] 101. he says he came right back up
[1:38:46] it's okay to get knocked down
[1:38:49] listen we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:38:51] blood but against principalities and
[1:38:52] powers and wickedness and dark things
[1:38:54] and these different things we're going
[1:38:55] to get knocked down we are gonna get
[1:38:57] knocked down
[1:38:59] but he says what he came right back up
[1:39:02] again he came just the same
[1:39:05] also it didn't take away from him it
[1:39:07] didn't diminish him no he came back just
[1:39:09] the same I threw him in the hospital
[1:39:13] I turned his wife against them
[1:39:16] I turned his neighbors against him I
[1:39:19] turned everything and he says that
[1:39:21] didn't make a bit of difference
[1:39:26] said though he slay me yet I'll trust
[1:39:29] him listen to this I killed his family
[1:39:34] I took this I did this I done all this I
[1:39:37] did this that other still he stood right
[1:39:40] up though he slay me yet I'll serve him
[1:39:43] he's mine
[1:39:45] now Church some of us have faced these
[1:39:47] more than others in here
[1:39:48] but some of us are still in these exams
[1:39:51] right now
[1:39:53] some of us are still here I look at
[1:39:55] sister Brenda sitting there
[1:39:57] and none of her family is here
[1:40:00] it's an exam isn't it
[1:40:02] sister Maureen walked away from family
[1:40:07] brother Chad sitting here none of his
[1:40:09] family
[1:40:12] sister Betty sitting in the hospital
[1:40:14] this very night
[1:40:16] what's our testimony
[1:40:18] though he slay me
[1:40:21] it didn't make a bit of difference what
[1:40:25] a testimony sisters what a testimony
[1:40:28] Brothers
[1:40:29] no matter what he did it didn't make a
[1:40:32] difference now here's the thing you say
[1:40:34] brother John I'm not there yet you're
[1:40:36] not adopted yet either
[1:40:38] don't put the pressure on and say well I
[1:40:40] actually
[1:40:41] you know it's tough on me when I'm in
[1:40:43] the hospital yeah of course it's tough
[1:40:44] he didn't say it doesn't tough he says
[1:40:46] it didn't make a bit of difference in
[1:40:47] his relationship with me in her
[1:40:49] relationship with me he didn't go back
[1:40:51] he didn't change to the negative but he
[1:40:54] held still and he got back up and then
[1:40:55] he just kept moving forward it didn't
[1:40:57] keep him from pressing on in the word it
[1:40:59] didn't keep him from pressing on in the
[1:41:01] promise it didn't keep him from pressing
[1:41:03] on in the land he kept going and going
[1:41:05] and going whatever knocked him down he
[1:41:07] got back up and he kept going and going
[1:41:08] and going that's what he means by
[1:41:10] doesn't make a difference doesn't mean
[1:41:12] we don't get hurt doesn't mean we don't
[1:41:13] get scars doesn't mean we don't get
[1:41:15] disappointed we're in a human body we're
[1:41:18] going to feel those things but he's
[1:41:19] saying what did it do to your
[1:41:20] relationship did you walk away did you
[1:41:22] say I've had enough if God really loved
[1:41:25] me he wouldn't do it he says no it
[1:41:26] didn't make a bit of difference this is
[1:41:30] the witness of people that have the fire
[1:41:32] of the holy spirit in their lives that
[1:41:34] they've got to see Gene of God that's
[1:41:35] coming up and it's starting to Blossom
[1:41:37] and it's flowering now and God is saying
[1:41:40] is he ready is she ready yes just like
[1:41:44] you and nothing changes that being just
[1:41:46] like you
[1:41:47] what a witness
[1:41:49] what a testimony that we ought to be
[1:41:51] looking for
[1:41:52] he'd say well I believe we ought to call
[1:41:54] him out somewhere to a little special
[1:41:55] place and have an adoption he said now
[1:41:58] when the father in the Old Testament
[1:42:00] understood that his son was come of age
[1:42:02] and had been seasoned out had been
[1:42:04] seasoned out into adoption unto he says
[1:42:08] they're born a child but then when
[1:42:10] they're a son right then but they'll
[1:42:12] never be no more than just a child just
[1:42:15] an ordinary son until they mature and do
[1:42:18] what show what they are not just say it
[1:42:21] show it be it express it manifest it he
[1:42:25] says then he calls them out then notice
[1:42:28] how he says he's been seasoned out we've
[1:42:31] been seasoned out into adoption not
[1:42:33] swayed by circumstances not swayed by
[1:42:35] emotions not put into action by mere
[1:42:37] need but seasoned what able to stand
[1:42:41] still and wait on God and able to move
[1:42:43] into action when the holy spirit moves
[1:42:46] us to do it we tend to think experience
[1:42:48] puts us into action no experience puts
[1:42:51] us into right action
[1:42:53] if you've ever been around trauma
[1:42:55] doctors and and a good friend of my
[1:42:57] father's is a trauma doctor they know
[1:42:59] what to do the right way the right time
[1:43:02] in the right order and you disobey a
[1:43:05] trauma doctor
[1:43:06] at your peril because if you disobey
[1:43:09] somebody dies why because they've been
[1:43:12] trained to do exactly what is right in
[1:43:14] the moment with very little information
[1:43:17] they've got to be able to look assess
[1:43:19] triage and say we're going to do this
[1:43:20] this and then this
[1:43:22] and you say well this is horrible this
[1:43:23] is no no that's not what matters we've
[1:43:25] got to make sure the blood's flowing
[1:43:26] we've got to make sure they've got
[1:43:27] enough in there we've got to stabilize
[1:43:28] the head you know whatever it is you
[1:43:31] don't ignore a trauma doctor why because
[1:43:33] they're seasoned you don't put rookies
[1:43:35] in as trauma doctors you always have one
[1:43:37] that is very experienced and then you
[1:43:39] have the rest beneath him learning and
[1:43:40] growing and understanding how to do
[1:43:42] these things and it's the same way with
[1:43:43] the children of God
[1:43:45] we're supposed to be seasoned we're
[1:43:47] supposed to be doing the right thing at
[1:43:49] the right time with the right motive and
[1:43:50] the right objective and it has the right
[1:43:52] effect it has the right effect
[1:43:55] and that takes leadership that takes
[1:43:58] maturity that takes patience that takes
[1:44:01] up prayer life
[1:44:02] and that takes knowing the word of God
[1:44:05] all those things and there's probably
[1:44:06] more that I'm forgetting
[1:44:08] but we often you know I talk about
[1:44:11] trauma doctors
[1:44:13] and we get into situations in life and
[1:44:16] you know what sometimes we can do the
[1:44:18] wrong thing trying to fix something
[1:44:20] not realizing that something else is the
[1:44:22] real problem
[1:44:23] and they'll spiral down down because
[1:44:24] we're so busy trying to fix a different
[1:44:26] symptom and the root of the issue we
[1:44:28] haven't recognized it
[1:44:30] we hold life and death in our hands did
[1:44:31] you know that
[1:44:32] prophet of God says I'm going to read a
[1:44:34] quote
[1:44:35] but we literally hold eternal life in
[1:44:36] our hands we hold people's souls in our
[1:44:38] hands now you say brother John you can't
[1:44:41] stop a true child of God from getting an
[1:44:42] eternal life and that's right
[1:44:44] Jesus said he wouldn't lose any of them
[1:44:46] everyone that's been given to him that's
[1:44:47] in his hands he's going to have but what
[1:44:49] about everyone else
[1:44:51] I can't stop brother Mark from getting
[1:44:54] eternal life because he's a Son of God
[1:44:55] but what about somebody that walks
[1:44:57] through that door
[1:44:58] they may not be a true son and daughter
[1:45:01] of God but we hold salvation in our
[1:45:03] hands
[1:45:04] our witness Our Testimony our actions
[1:45:06] our words all of these things play in
[1:45:09] brother random would say this he says
[1:45:11] you know there's so many of us and most
[1:45:13] all of us influence Somebody by the
[1:45:15] things that we do the way we live and
[1:45:17] the things we say we influence somebody
[1:45:19] somebody is watching your life
[1:45:24] and then when we profess to be
[1:45:25] Christians what type of life should we
[1:45:28] live if somebody is watching us and your
[1:45:31] life that you live will reflect an
[1:45:33] influence on somebody
[1:45:35] their Eternal destination will rest upon
[1:45:39] the way that you live and the things
[1:45:41] that you do for they've watched you
[1:45:44] wow
[1:45:47] we'll talk about this a little bit later
[1:45:49] remember brother Branham says that
[1:45:50] you're what you did before you came to
[1:45:53] service or your attitude in the service
[1:45:55] could keep somebody from getting their
[1:45:56] healing
[1:45:58] we hold things in our hands there's
[1:46:00] power in our hands there's an effect
[1:46:02] there's an influence that we have and it
[1:46:04] behooves us to look at our life and say
[1:46:06] is this truly reflective of what a son
[1:46:08] and a daughter of God did I spoke last
[1:46:10] service about bad drivers and I ever
[1:46:12] since I've spoken about that they have
[1:46:15] come out in droves to test me
[1:46:17] but remember I said last night that I
[1:46:19] said I said to the Lord I said I've got
[1:46:21] to get better at handling bad drivers
[1:46:23] because they're everywhere and they
[1:46:24] don't know it and and I'm just I'm going
[1:46:27] to blow a gasket at some point
[1:46:30] and and so I remember what I said last
[1:46:32] time I said the first thing God does
[1:46:33] when you ask him to do it is he lets you
[1:46:35] do it a couple times to Humble you he
[1:46:37] lets you make a bone-headed move he lets
[1:46:38] you almost run somebody over or pull out
[1:46:41] into traffic in a way that almost gets
[1:46:43] you hit or something
[1:46:44] but as I mentioned after that
[1:46:47] you know you're in the ministry and
[1:46:48] you're witnessing to people and you're
[1:46:50] trying to get people to come to church
[1:46:51] and imagine if I was gesticulating and
[1:46:53] yelling and throwing a fit on the road
[1:46:55] and then that person would walk through
[1:46:57] that door or drive by and I'd say hey
[1:46:58] how about you coming into church and
[1:46:59] they said you're that guy that was
[1:47:01] yelling at me on the road the other day
[1:47:02] right if I if that's what you've got in
[1:47:04] there I don't want it
[1:47:07] and we need sometimes
[1:47:09] so that's one thing you say well you're
[1:47:12] justified in it they took your space but
[1:47:13] listen people are going to take our
[1:47:15] space constantly they're going to step
[1:47:17] on our toes they're going to offend us
[1:47:18] they're going to hurt us they're going
[1:47:19] to say unkind things on true things and
[1:47:21] we're going to have to be able to give
[1:47:22] up our right
[1:47:25] to a response
[1:47:27] to set the record straight
[1:47:29] to claim our space for the sake of their
[1:47:31] soul
[1:47:33] that's what season to mature Sons and
[1:47:35] Daughters of God do is they'll let
[1:47:37] somebody hurt them wrong them say
[1:47:39] something wrong and they'll move on for
[1:47:42] the sake of that person to try and be a
[1:47:43] witness to get them to God rather than
[1:47:46] stand up for themselves and say I have a
[1:47:48] right to this because we got lots of
[1:47:50] Rights Church
[1:47:51] this is an age of Rights laodicea means
[1:47:54] people's rights and what you'll find in
[1:47:56] this age is that everybody's standing up
[1:47:58] for their own rights
[1:48:00] but nobody's willing to lay it down for
[1:48:01] the sake of bringing somebody else into
[1:48:03] something good for them
[1:48:06] God help us to lay down that right to a
[1:48:08] harsh reaction
[1:48:10] our righteous indignation doesn't always
[1:48:12] have to be expressed
[1:48:14] sometimes it has to be expressed through
[1:48:15] prayer Lord you know
[1:48:18] and I'm tired of it and I'm sick of it
[1:48:20] and I'm hurt and I'm this and that and
[1:48:22] the other thing but Lord for their sake
[1:48:24] help me to look them in the eye and
[1:48:26] treat them like a brother treat them
[1:48:27] like a sister in Christ regardless of
[1:48:29] what they do maybe it's somebody out in
[1:48:31] the world but it's even harder when it's
[1:48:32] somebody in the church isn't it and
[1:48:34] we've got to be able to lay down our
[1:48:36] rights that's what a lamb does it lays
[1:48:39] down itself
[1:48:40] and that's the that's the dove nature
[1:48:42] that's the lamb nature
[1:48:44] second Timothy two this is for me and
[1:48:47] the servant of the Lord must not strive
[1:48:51] must not argue must not fight not must
[1:48:54] must not claim his rights he says but
[1:48:57] must be gentle unto all men apt to teach
[1:48:59] patient in meekness instructing those
[1:49:02] that oppose themselves if God per
[1:49:05] Adventure will give them repentance to
[1:49:07] the acknowledging of the truth he's
[1:49:09] talking here about people that are
[1:49:11] hurting themselves and don't know it
[1:49:12] people that are on the wrong path people
[1:49:15] that are headed in the wrong way making
[1:49:16] wrong decisions and he says the servant
[1:49:18] of the Lord he must not fight
[1:49:22] but he must meekly approach and try and
[1:49:25] convince them otherwise
[1:49:26] because if you go in with my rights my
[1:49:28] rights and my position and I'm this and
[1:49:29] I'm that and you're not you're never
[1:49:31] going to get anywhere with them
[1:49:32] you've got to go in meekly and he says
[1:49:34] what you're trying to save people from
[1:49:36] themselves and he says that word prayer
[1:49:38] Venture means just in case on the mere
[1:49:41] possibility that you might make a
[1:49:43] difference going meekly
[1:49:45] God help us God help me
[1:49:47] God help me to do it this way if we can
[1:49:50] keep our attitude right and go in and
[1:49:51] say I'm in this for you and I'm willing
[1:49:53] to swallow whatever pill you shove at me
[1:49:55] to try and help you out of it it says
[1:49:57] that they may recover themselves out of
[1:49:59] the snare of the devil who are taken
[1:50:01] captive by him at his will
[1:50:04] the prophet God would say this that's
[1:50:06] what a real Christian does you pray and
[1:50:09] humble yourself and keep before God day
[1:50:12] and night why in order that you might
[1:50:14] give yourself to somebody else
[1:50:17] we're talking about the stamp of
[1:50:18] approval we're talking about a review of
[1:50:20] the transcript of our Christian Life
[1:50:22] it's not what you keep it's what you
[1:50:25] give that counts you must give yourself
[1:50:27] out to others that's the way Jesus did
[1:50:30] he gave himself to others so what is the
[1:50:34] witness of the holy spirit for the
[1:50:35] transcript of the son or daughter that's
[1:50:37] about to be adopted there's been a shift
[1:50:39] in motive there's been a shift in
[1:50:40] objective self has been moved out of the
[1:50:43] way and now they're ready to serve
[1:50:45] now they're ready to serve now they're
[1:50:47] ready to put other needs ahead of them
[1:50:49] they are what the mature children of God
[1:50:51] are not self-seeking they are giving
[1:50:53] more than they are receiving
[1:50:55] and if you look around as you look at
[1:50:57] people that come into uh you know of age
[1:50:59] and as children become adults and and as
[1:51:01] you know young young couples marry and
[1:51:04] and they have children what do they do
[1:51:06] they become more and more giving and
[1:51:07] very much less receiving
[1:51:10] as they step into maturity as they step
[1:51:12] into greater responsibility they're
[1:51:13] giving more and they're receiving less
[1:51:15] and that's what gives us gray hairs
[1:51:17] that's what wears our bodies out is
[1:51:19] giving rather than receiving life's
[1:51:21] great when you're receiving
[1:51:22] but life has purpose when you're giving
[1:51:24] and you'll find more satisfaction when
[1:51:26] you're giving than when you're receiving
[1:51:27] there's a reason that it says it's more
[1:51:29] blessed to give than to receive it'll
[1:51:31] satisfy something in your heart that
[1:51:33] you're wondering about when you start
[1:51:34] giving
[1:51:35] it does Miracles it does Miracles inside
[1:51:38] of us
[1:51:40] what is it that combined with that love
[1:51:42] it allows us to do things
[1:51:44] regardless of what people think about us
[1:51:47] you'll help somebody you'll do something
[1:51:49] for them regardless of what they think
[1:51:50] about you know the scripture talks about
[1:51:52] heaping coals of fire on their head when
[1:51:54] you do replace uh you you respond to to
[1:51:56] harshness or or these things with with
[1:51:59] kindness
[1:52:01] that takes real maturity that takes a
[1:52:03] real season believer to do those things
[1:52:05] and will do what's right regardless of
[1:52:07] whether or not that person appreciates
[1:52:08] it or or recognizes it that's what
[1:52:11] seasoned believers do
[1:52:16] well the brand would say this
[1:52:18] we should be so on fire for God we
[1:52:21] should be going day and night
[1:52:24] nothing should be able to stop us
[1:52:29] I ain't here I'm not here yet but I'm
[1:52:31] going to read it and we should be so
[1:52:34] sweet and so pleasant and so kind and so
[1:52:37] christ-like in our lives you get me
[1:52:39] going day and night I'm busier than I've
[1:52:40] ever been in my life
[1:52:42] but he's saying go day and night and
[1:52:45] then on top of that be sweet so sweet
[1:52:48] not just sweet so sweet sickly sweet
[1:52:51] so pleasant so kind so christ-like in
[1:52:55] our lives
[1:52:56] he says it takes Every Day's life
[1:53:01] every day
[1:53:03] every day you got to be focused on this
[1:53:06] every day you've got to be dwelling on
[1:53:08] it every day you've got to be pressing
[1:53:09] into this
[1:53:11] day in and day out to be on fire for God
[1:53:14] to be doing what he wants you to do
[1:53:17] Jesus said consider the lily of the
[1:53:19] field how it grows toil and spinning yet
[1:53:22] I say unto you that Solomon and all of
[1:53:23] his glory is not arrayed like one
[1:53:25] Solomon have robes that were arrayed
[1:53:27] with glorious silk and needlework and
[1:53:28] things but that wasn't what he was
[1:53:30] talking about he said in order for a
[1:53:33] lily to grow it has to toil both night
[1:53:36] and day
[1:53:39] you know it's this is something maybe
[1:53:41] brother Matt and brother Joe and I will
[1:53:44] more experience more than others but
[1:53:45] there's a special time when you take
[1:53:47] your son on a hunt and for the first
[1:53:50] time he doesn't say are We Done Yet
[1:53:53] when are we stopping when are we eating
[1:53:56] or I'm too tired
[1:54:00] and maybe it's that way for shoveling
[1:54:01] snow maybe it's that way for cleaning up
[1:54:03] the yard whatever it is but it's a
[1:54:04] special day when they do everything that
[1:54:06] a man does
[1:54:08] and you say that was so good that was so
[1:54:11] refreshing he's really stepping into
[1:54:14] adulthood now
[1:54:16] you know it's it's a wonderful time when
[1:54:19] when the the sun sees that the lawn
[1:54:21] needs mowing and he's been trained how
[1:54:23] to use the mower and he knows how to
[1:54:24] start and he knows how to gas it up he
[1:54:26] knows all the spots to watch out so you
[1:54:27] don't hit a rock and bend the blade and
[1:54:29] he sees the lawn needs mowing and he
[1:54:31] goes and does it without anybody asking
[1:54:33] him
[1:54:34] that's a wonderful day for us
[1:54:36] it's a wonderful day when the young
[1:54:38] sisters and you have people over and and
[1:54:41] they immediately get up and they help
[1:54:43] without you having to ask them and all
[1:54:45] the mama said amen
[1:54:47] but it's a wonderful thing because
[1:54:48] you've taught them and you've trained
[1:54:50] them and all of a sudden they it's like
[1:54:51] something clicks and they're like oh I'm
[1:54:54] supposed to put that into action now and
[1:54:56] they do it without you asking them
[1:54:58] remember we talked about last time that
[1:55:00] what God trains you into he can use
[1:55:02] immediately and I spoke about how when I
[1:55:05] was a a kid and we do it of course with
[1:55:07] our boys and even Selena for a while is
[1:55:09] that we go out to start the car and once
[1:55:10] we taught them how to start the car and
[1:55:12] warm it up then we'd send them out to do
[1:55:13] it and we loved it for a while and then
[1:55:15] we started realizing this is just really
[1:55:16] cold and not a lot of fun and we
[1:55:18] realized they were using us
[1:55:20] but we weren't using them what were we
[1:55:22] doing we were training them to take our
[1:55:24] place
[1:55:26] so it started with starting the car
[1:55:29] and then as they got bigger it was
[1:55:31] clearing the windshield off
[1:55:33] and it was making sure that the tires
[1:55:34] were free of snow so they didn't go on
[1:55:36] the highway
[1:55:38] and we start to do what we're training
[1:55:40] them to do what we do
[1:55:42] yes we're using them in a way we
[1:55:44] appreciate that we don't have to go out
[1:55:46] in the wind in the snow and the rain and
[1:55:47] start a vehicle to warm it up but we're
[1:55:49] not doing it just for our sake we're
[1:55:51] doing it so that when they become an
[1:55:53] adult they can do the things that we do
[1:55:55] we're training them to step into mama
[1:55:57] and dada's position as they come of age
[1:56:00] and so we can look at these things as oh
[1:56:02] we're just being used of course and I
[1:56:04] didn't mean to give that impression
[1:56:05] because we do get a benefit as parents
[1:56:07] from training our children it reduces
[1:56:09] our workload but that's of necessity
[1:56:11] because our workload has to reduce as we
[1:56:13] get older we can't run as long as we
[1:56:15] could before we can't do the tele10k
[1:56:17] anymore can we do brother Bob at the
[1:56:19] drop of a hat
[1:56:20] can't do it and so you've got your kids
[1:56:22] coming up and as you reduce they build
[1:56:25] up and you can maintain everything that
[1:56:27] you've been doing all along
[1:56:29] but what is it they're showing they're
[1:56:30] mature and that's when you start to
[1:56:32] realize
[1:56:33] it's clicked
[1:56:35] when they start using everything you've
[1:56:37] taught them and realizing not just that
[1:56:39] they're capable of doing it but applying
[1:56:41] it at the time of the need then you
[1:56:43] start to say they're becoming an adult
[1:56:46] kids this is your key to getting
[1:56:49] everything you ever wanted in the home
[1:56:51] recognize the need and do what Mommy and
[1:56:53] Daddy have taught you to do
[1:56:54] because when they trust that you have
[1:56:57] learned it and you're applying it
[1:56:58] correctly all of a sudden what happens
[1:57:00] they're an adult now and you get to sit
[1:57:02] at the adults table and when the adults
[1:57:04] are talking about adult things you get
[1:57:06] to sit and you even get to talk after a
[1:57:08] while
[1:57:09] and you're in church and you're in your
[1:57:12] jobs and you're paying ties and guess
[1:57:13] what you get to decide who the minister
[1:57:15] is going to be you get to vote on things
[1:57:18] you get to have a voice in these things
[1:57:19] why because you prove by your life
[1:57:21] you've proved by your actions you've
[1:57:23] proved by your application I am an adult
[1:57:26] and we start to look at that and we
[1:57:27] rejoice in it
[1:57:28] you know talking to brother Bob and
[1:57:30] brother Mark about when Joe and Matt and
[1:57:32] these different ones became deacons they
[1:57:33] loved it because it reduced the load on
[1:57:36] them but it was also an appreciation for
[1:57:37] the fact that they were men
[1:57:39] they were sons of God that were willing
[1:57:41] to step into position and take
[1:57:42] responsibility in the kingdom of God for
[1:57:44] the saints of God it's a wonderful thing
[1:57:46] to see and this is what adoption looks
[1:57:48] like as God says the holy spirit says
[1:57:51] they're stepping into the needs without
[1:57:53] somebody having to tell them
[1:57:55] the most wonderful thing a pastor can
[1:57:57] have is people that see the need and do
[1:57:58] it without him having to ask them and we
[1:58:00] got a church full of people that do it
[1:58:01] and it's a wonderful thing but when you
[1:58:03] see people saying I've been trained to
[1:58:05] do it I've been taught how to do it I've
[1:58:07] passed the test I can do it and you just
[1:58:09] go and do it it's a beautiful thing
[1:58:11] it's a beautiful thing and that's what
[1:58:13] the holy spirit is saying is it's saying
[1:58:14] they do what I've taught them now they
[1:58:16] don't just know it but they do it in
[1:58:18] everyday life regardless of what people
[1:58:20] think or say about them
[1:58:23] look at this final Final witness as we
[1:58:25] start to close
[1:58:27] brother says now he's talking to Israel
[1:58:29] the spiritual Israel who has possessed
[1:58:30] the land he says oh aren't you glad you
[1:58:33] come out of Egypt's garlic aren't you
[1:58:35] glad you're out of the Wilderness and
[1:58:37] remember they had to eat Mana Angel's
[1:58:39] food out of Heaven until they crossed
[1:58:41] over into the land and when they crossed
[1:58:43] over into the land the Manna ceased to
[1:58:46] fall they were fully matured then and
[1:58:49] they eat the old corn of the land
[1:58:52] he says now now that you're not babies
[1:58:55] anymore now that you're not Desiring the
[1:58:57] sincere milk of the Gospel that you
[1:58:59] don't have to be babied and padded and
[1:59:02] persuaded to come to church now that
[1:59:04] you're real fully mature Christians
[1:59:06] you're ready to eat strong Meats now
[1:59:09] you're ready to come into something
[1:59:12] he said you're ready to understand
[1:59:14] something that's deep and Rich he says
[1:59:17] oh we'll get into it directly and we
[1:59:18] will he says and oh it's been hidden
[1:59:21] since the foundation of the world
[1:59:24] what is it you can handle real food now
[1:59:26] I was listening to brother Ron Spencer
[1:59:28] earlier today and he was preaching at
[1:59:32] the people and he was preaching at the
[1:59:34] people and he was preaching other people
[1:59:35] not in the hard way
[1:59:37] and you know what they were saying
[1:59:39] amen praise the Lord preach it brother
[1:59:42] when God gets personal we say do it
[1:59:44] again
[1:59:46] when God comes he starts putting fingers
[1:59:48] in her life we say do it again do it
[1:59:50] some more Lord that's right now I know
[1:59:51] you're here now I know you're talking to
[1:59:53] me
[1:59:54] what is it you can handle strong meat
[1:59:56] you can handle a personal impact on your
[1:59:59] life and it's not just general anymore
[2:00:01] it's not we now it's you and you and you
[2:00:05] and you and me
[2:00:07] that's what they can handle and then
[2:00:08] they can start to get into the depths
[2:00:10] because God can take away the little
[2:00:12] stuff
[2:00:13] I say little stuff
[2:00:15] that's what it is in God's eyes little
[2:00:16] stuff
[2:00:17] it's big in our eyes it's little to him
[2:00:19] and then he can start to get in and
[2:00:21] really start molding and shaping you and
[2:00:22] working you into that image that he was
[2:00:24] looking for
[2:00:25] you're ready for something now
[2:00:27] you'll respond the right way you don't
[2:00:30] get hurt you don't get offended easily
[2:00:31] you're matured you're seasoned you're a
[2:00:34] warrior now you've got an adult
[2:00:35] Christian body if I can put it that way
[2:00:37] and you need real meat
[2:00:39] remember Paul said forgetting that the
[2:00:41] doctrines and the this and that the
[2:00:42] other let us go on to Perfection what is
[2:00:44] it you need solid meat now and it's not
[2:00:46] just doctrinal meat it's work
[2:00:48] it's kingdom of God work it's positional
[2:00:51] placing it's stepping into something
[2:00:52] that you're built for exactly it's not
[2:00:54] that you don't have milk from time to
[2:00:56] time we all drink milk milk's good for
[2:00:58] cereal and for brownies and cookies it's
[2:01:00] not that we don't use milk from time to
[2:01:01] time
[2:01:02] but now you need steak
[2:01:04] you need chicken you need tofu
[2:01:08] you need something that really can
[2:01:09] satisfy you and it's not just going to
[2:01:11] be these little things anymore and
[2:01:13] you'll see it in in in Believers that
[2:01:15] are growing quickly and what happens is
[2:01:17] they're okay to sit and listen
[2:01:19] they're okay to sit there and have
[2:01:21] something brought to them but after a
[2:01:22] while they start to say okay now I'm
[2:01:24] ready to do something with it that's how
[2:01:26] you know your kids are growing up is
[2:01:27] they want to start doing they want to
[2:01:28] start helping they want to start being
[2:01:29] apart and as they grow and they gain
[2:01:31] these these skills and they learn these
[2:01:33] lessons then they're ready for that
[2:01:34] strong meat and all of a sudden they're
[2:01:35] strong enough and they're they're
[2:01:37] they've got the training and they've
[2:01:38] proved themselves and you start saying
[2:01:40] okay now you can do something now you
[2:01:42] can mow the lawn if I'm not at the house
[2:01:44] now you can start it and gas it up now
[2:01:46] you can drive to the drive Mama to the
[2:01:48] store to get groceries or you can go get
[2:01:49] them yourself now I don't have to be
[2:01:51] along anymore why you've you're ready
[2:01:53] for something that is a real impact in
[2:01:56] your family real impact in the kingdom
[2:01:58] of God
[2:02:00] brother Brian would finish with this he
[2:02:02] says now that you've come into this I'm
[2:02:05] addressing this to you not to those who
[2:02:07] have just left Egypt not to those who
[2:02:09] are still in the journey but to those
[2:02:11] who are in the promised land that have
[2:02:14] received the promised he said how many's
[2:02:17] received the promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:20] if you can't raise your hand and say
[2:02:21] that tonight
[2:02:23] go back
[2:02:25] don't move forward because you'll fall
[2:02:28] flat on your face because Brian brother
[2:02:30] Brown would say in that land he says it
[2:02:32] would prove one thing that it must be a
[2:02:33] perfect walk you must be led by the
[2:02:36] spirit of God that's the only way you
[2:02:37] can have a perfect walk is we're going
[2:02:39] to talk about later
[2:02:40] so you've got to have the Holy Spirit
[2:02:42] you've got to know you've got the holy
[2:02:43] spirit it's got to be settled it's got
[2:02:45] to be anchored it has to be in a place
[2:02:47] where you can't be touched
[2:02:49] nothing can be removed you've got to
[2:02:51] know you've got the Holy Ghost Church
[2:02:53] he says oh aren't you glad you're in the
[2:02:55] land over here now eating the old corn
[2:02:57] eating the strong things of God and God
[2:03:00] a clear understanding he says your
[2:03:02] spiritual mind is all unmuddled up you
[2:03:04] know exactly who he is
[2:03:06] you know exactly what he is you know
[2:03:09] exactly where you're going you know
[2:03:11] exactly all about it you know in whom
[2:03:14] you have believed and you're persuaded
[2:03:16] that he's able to keep that which you've
[2:03:18] committed to him against that day
[2:03:22] I mean God bless you let's Stand
[2:03:23] Together
[2:03:26] I was talking to some of the brothers
[2:03:28] earlier
[2:03:29] they said you know are you going to keep
[2:03:30] going on Redemption and I said well
[2:03:32] everything's Redemption you can tie it
[2:03:34] back but I said once you get into the
[2:03:36] promised land then it just starts to go
[2:03:37] because you've got adoption
[2:03:39] you also have the marriage of the Lamb
[2:03:42] you've got the invisible Union you've
[2:03:44] got positional placing you've got the
[2:03:46] title deed you've got all these
[2:03:47] different thoughts that are encompassed
[2:03:49] in this idea of going into Canaan of
[2:03:51] being in the Holy Ghost and these
[2:03:52] different things so I'm not actually
[2:03:54] sure where we'll go for Sunday and you
[2:03:56] pray for me to see which direction it
[2:03:58] takes but there's so much there
[2:04:00] they're saying that there's a brother
[2:04:01] that that told Brother Gerald one time
[2:04:03] he says I don't have anything left to
[2:04:05] preach on that's not a problem the
[2:04:08] problem is not what do I it's what do I
[2:04:10] preach on not and where do I start
[2:04:12] because it's so much that it's so rich
[2:04:14] there's so much depth there's so much
[2:04:15] breadth to it and like I said just on
[2:04:18] this this series of notes I've got 20
[2:04:20] odd Pages still left that I I'm just
[2:04:22] going to have to kind of put away and
[2:04:23] just move on by God's grace but just
[2:04:26] trusting him to lead us amen that we've
[2:04:28] got young people here we've got seasoned
[2:04:31] people we've got middle-aged people
[2:04:32] we've got young couples we've got older
[2:04:34] couples we've got people at work we've
[2:04:36] got people in the home and everybody
[2:04:37] needs something different not everybody
[2:04:40] can eat steak
[2:04:42] and not everybody can drink milk but
[2:04:44] that doesn't mean we don't have milk in
[2:04:46] the services and we don't have steak in
[2:04:47] the services and everything in between
[2:04:48] so I need God to leave me in that amen I
[2:04:51] don't want to preach so high that we get
[2:04:52] depressed or dismayed or despondent
[2:04:55] because we don't we're not matching up
[2:04:57] to what brother John preaches about well
[2:04:58] listen I don't either half the time
[2:05:01] but I don't want to drag people down but
[2:05:02] I also don't want to give us a bunch of
[2:05:04] a bunch of soft food either
[2:05:06] but we've got young people in our midst
[2:05:07] we've got young people that have just
[2:05:09] been baptized a year too maybe three and
[2:05:11] they need that stuff and so it's a full
[2:05:13] body and we've got to feed all of them
[2:05:14] Jesus said to Peter he says do you love
[2:05:16] me he said yes feed my sheep feed my
[2:05:18] sheep and they says feed my Lambs so
[2:05:21] there's a feeding that has to go on for
[2:05:22] the whole bride amen so you pray for me
[2:05:24] and trust that the Lord will lead me
[2:05:25] that these will be a blessing to each
[2:05:27] one that's here that each one of us will
[2:05:28] get the revelation we need to move
[2:05:30] forward because it's going to take God
[2:05:32] it can't just be me up here just
[2:05:34] reciting quotes and scriptures and these
[2:05:35] things but it's going to take the Holy
[2:05:36] Spirit to Quicken it into our young
[2:05:38] people's lives that's that's the
[2:05:40] greatest thing is get the Holy Ghost
[2:05:41] let's if there's one thing that I ever
[2:05:43] achieve as a pastor is to bring somebody
[2:05:44] to a true New Birth that it makes it all
[2:05:47] worth it it makes it all worth it what
[2:05:49] happens after that doesn't matter so
[2:05:50] much but get our young people to a new
[2:05:52] birth get out get our older people to a
[2:05:53] new birth
[2:05:55] brother Bradham had people that had
[2:05:56] served the the good old Christian way
[2:05:58] for 30 and 40 years and they never got
[2:05:59] the Holy Ghost until then
[2:06:02] we can't presume on these things but
[2:06:03] we've got to know we've got to have an
[2:06:04] anchor we've got a tie post brother
[2:06:06] Brandon would say that holds Us in these
[2:06:08] times that I am sealed into the day of
[2:06:10] my full Redemption amen amen but I want
[2:06:13] to come to a place and I believe we're
[2:06:15] each one going to come to a place true
[2:06:16] Sons and Daughters of God where we're so
[2:06:18] surrendered brother Brown has a quote he
[2:06:20] says where the devil doesn't know what
[2:06:22] to do with us
[2:06:23] doesn't know what to do with us I'd like
[2:06:25] to have a testimony this week the devil
[2:06:27] didn't know what to do with me
[2:06:29] he came and he tried and he walked away
[2:06:31] and he was the most frustrated devil
[2:06:33] that we've ever seen in a while because
[2:06:34] he tried something and it didn't work
[2:06:36] and he tried another thing and it didn't
[2:06:38] work and he tried another thing that
[2:06:39] didn't work why because greater is he
[2:06:41] that's in me than he that's in the world
[2:06:43] Amen let's bow our heads each one
[2:06:45] Heavenly Father
[2:06:47] Lord we want to press on
[2:06:50] Lord we want to keep fighting the good
[2:06:51] fight Lord we want to surrender Lord we
[2:06:54] want to Humble ourselves to your word
[2:06:57] but Lord that's what we can do
[2:06:59] Lord but it takes a work of you in our
[2:07:01] lives Lord it takes a lord a baptism and
[2:07:05] then a re-baptism and a refilling and a
[2:07:07] refilling Lord it takes a constant
[2:07:09] washing of Water by the word
[2:07:12] Lord help us to lay our focus on that
[2:07:14] Lord let us lay aside every weight and
[2:07:16] sin that does so easily beset us Lord
[2:07:19] let us lay before you Lord let us stay
[2:07:21] in your presence let us seek it Lord let
[2:07:23] us fight for that
[2:07:25] Lord to get away from all these things
[2:07:27] that would hold us back
[2:07:28] Lord would you lift us up higher we pray
[2:07:30] Lord let our testimony by the Holy
[2:07:33] Spirit Lord be one that pleases you we
[2:07:35] ask
[2:07:37] Lord each day a little higher each day a
[2:07:39] little further
[2:07:40] or may you grant it to us each one we
[2:07:42] pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[2:07:45] amen
[2:07:52] let's sing that song I Love You Lord and
