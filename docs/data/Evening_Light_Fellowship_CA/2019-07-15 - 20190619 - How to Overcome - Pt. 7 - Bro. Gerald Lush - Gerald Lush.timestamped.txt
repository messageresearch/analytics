[42:45] wonderful words it is wonderful words of
[42:48] love eternal life night and by the grace
[42:52] of God the revelation of the little God
[42:54] the revelation of the people that Latian
[42:57] thought where he's got us to come from
[43:00] where where he's taking his back a man
[43:02] for thank God brothers not just that
[43:04] we're sinners saved by grace were the
[43:06] sons and daughters of God that we're
[43:08] fallen from fallen from grace as it were
[43:11] but being brought back to grace a man so
[43:14] we come from eternity and Uighur going
[43:16] back to eternity by the grace of
[43:19] Almighty God and as I've said before
[43:21] that most of the saints are down through
[43:24] the ages down through the years they
[43:26] weren't taught that revelation all they
[43:28] all the only revelation they knew was
[43:30] we're sinners and we need to be saved
[43:31] and Jesus came to save us he met but
[43:35] thank God for the greater revelation the
[43:37] higher revelation the deeper revelation
[43:39] a man of why we are redeemed why we are
[43:43] saved a man these guys why all the
[43:46] father's given me will come to me and I
[43:49] will lose none and amen by the grace of
[43:52] God because amen everyone that God
[43:55] foreknew every seat of God every Son of
[43:57] God amen every daughter of God amen
[44:00] they'll respond to God a man they're
[44:03] gonna respond to our Evan Lee father a
[44:05] man so we're going back where we come
[44:08] from thank God for that for that
[44:10] revelation thank God for that role
[44:12] praising a man I just not just getting
[44:14] saved than going to heaven we're going
[44:16] home a man so I trust you you you'll get
[44:19] that revelation and like I said I got it
[44:22] printed here in my Bible I typed it and
[44:24] taped it in in a certain scripture there
[44:27] and it says some call it heaven I call
[44:29] it home a man and that's the truth
[44:32] a lot of a lot of a lot of people feel
[44:34] they're going to heaven and I'll be
[44:36] honest well you know there there are
[44:38] those that are going to have him that's
[44:39] right because many are called few are
[44:42] chosen so he has chosen the elect he has
[44:45] chosen his family he has chosen his sons
[44:47] and daughters and they're separated from
[44:49] all the
[44:50] arrest a man and we're going to we're
[44:52] going to live with him in the city a man
[44:54] by the grace of Almighty God and a
[44:57] proverb brings it out in the message on
[44:59] how can I overcome Ebro I lighted this
[45:02] he brings it out that that as it is with
[45:04] the Gentiles many called few chosen so
[45:07] it also is with the Jews and he said
[45:10] there's many called a few chosen
[45:12] but again the call are not lost they're
[45:15] going to be there but again the chosen
[45:17] are the elect of God a man a man those
[45:20] that God is God has known as they were
[45:23] from the beginning eternity a man is
[45:26] forever married to backsliding Israel
[45:28] amen and he called you and me to provoke
[45:32] them to jealousy a man
[45:34] so they're going to come back and
[45:36] brother we know we know that's going on
[45:38] in Israel right now it is absolutely
[45:40] tremendous when we realize what's going
[45:43] on in Israel oh brother I tell you this
[45:47] is God is on the move and I tell you if
[45:50] that's going on there
[45:52] what's going on with the bright ear Amen
[45:55] brother if God God is forgetting getting
[45:57] them ready to receive the two messengers
[45:59] of Moses and Elijah or two men with
[46:02] their their anointing on them was God
[46:06] doing with you and me he's getting us
[46:07] ready for the rapture he's getting us
[46:09] ready for the resurrection he's getting
[46:11] us ready to get out of time and into

[1:01:37] Lord hallelujah Amen Lord bless you
[1:01:42] before ever seated turn with me to the
[1:01:44] book of Romans chapter 8 the book of
[1:01:48] Romans chapter 8 and the grace of God be
[1:01:51] with us some things just want to share
[1:01:53] with you hopefully eventually that we
[1:01:58] would get to conclude the message on how
[1:02:00] can I overcome some quotes there as well
[1:02:05] as some other things right now that that
[1:02:07] the Lord sort of laid on my heart and in
[1:02:11] Romans chapter 8 and this was awfully a
[1:02:16] message that we will hear eventually by
[1:02:19] our brother Chad lamb and it was the
[1:02:23] message that brother Ali came to the
[1:02:25] house on Friday and played for us and it
[1:02:28] was is tremendous and so I I was going
[1:02:33] to remind our brother keep keep the
[1:02:35] message
[1:02:36] don't don't don't let it go away amen
[1:02:40] because I want to share it with the
[1:02:42] Saints and the things that our brother
[1:02:44] is highlighting the things that our
[1:02:45] brother is ministering on and of course
[1:02:48] shows that know brother Chad lamb he's
[1:02:50] in the East the pastor now understand of
[1:02:52] the church that our brother Lonnie
[1:02:54] Jenkins used to pastor many years ago of
[1:02:56] course our brother Lonnie has gone on
[1:02:59] and I thank the Lord for the fellowship
[1:03:02] I've had with our brother over the years
[1:03:04] a man and I just feel that he was a
[1:03:08] wonderful brother with a wonderful
[1:03:10] spirit and I that he had wonderful
[1:03:12] revelation a man he had a great spirit
[1:03:15] and a right attitude
[1:03:16] a man so God rest his soul and so he's
[1:03:20] there waiting for us a man by the grace
[1:03:23] of God and so the Lord willing it'll be
[1:03:27] I guess after our brother LaFontaine is
[1:03:31] gone that we'll try to get to play that
[1:03:33] tape for the church and I don't know if
[1:03:36] it's on the Internet
[1:03:38] okay and also again the message I did
[1:03:42] mention the last service that I have
[1:03:45] been
[1:03:46] - bye brother Ron Spencer and again this
[1:03:50] was a 2011 message and it is tremendous
[1:03:54] absolutely tremendous and III assume
[1:03:59] that he's still ministering it the same
[1:04:01] way if he is he's going to have fewer
[1:04:04] and fewer in the church for sure because
[1:04:06] it is really laying in the word amen and
[1:04:10] challenging the Saints - personally you
[1:04:14] know to identify with the word a man and
[1:04:17] it comes down brother to a personal
[1:04:19] relationship a main issue in Christ and
[1:04:22] by the grace of Almighty God it's not
[1:04:24] you in a message or not you an
[1:04:25] adulterant issue in Christ a man when we
[1:04:29] and we were were getting more acquainted
[1:04:31] with Christ through the revelation of
[1:04:32] the word amen
[1:04:33] until until Christ is they were to
[1:04:36] manifest that word in you amen you gonna
[1:04:40] even make that word flesh in you by the
[1:04:42] grace of God amen not in your head but
[1:04:45] in your heart
[1:04:46] a man so be in prayer and as the Lord
[1:04:49] will lead we'll we'll air our brother
[1:04:51] Ron Spencer and also our brother Chad
[1:04:53] lamb in Romans chapter eight was Chad
[1:04:56] lambs tax will begin at verse one it
[1:05:01] says there is therefore now no
[1:05:02] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:05:05] Jesus and it says who walk not after the
[1:05:09] flesh but after the spirit amen
[1:05:13] and it says for the law of the spirit of
[1:05:16] life in Christ Jesus has made me free
[1:05:20] from the law of sin and death a man in
[1:05:24] Christ I live in my flesh I die amen but
[1:05:28] in the spirit in the Holy Ghost in our
[1:05:31] hearts we have eternal life a man for
[1:05:34] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:05:37] Jesus and made me free from the law of
[1:05:41] sin and death
[1:05:43] amen he paid the price I couldn't pay it
[1:05:47] for what the law could not do in that it
[1:05:51] was weak through the flesh God sending
[1:05:54] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[1:05:58] flesh
[1:05:59] for sin condemned sin in the flesh a man
[1:06:05] in the flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ a
[1:06:08] man because there was no sin in his
[1:06:12] flesh it was perfect sinless blood that
[1:06:16] He shed a man and he brought the life of
[1:06:19] the blood back to you and me the Holy
[1:06:22] Ghost and he said verse 4 that the
[1:06:25] righteousness of the law may be
[1:06:28] fulfilled in us amen hallelujah
[1:06:32] hallelujah is not me brother it's Christ
[1:06:35] in me amen it's the label Trace as the
[1:06:38] labor of his blood in me manifesting the
[1:06:41] righteousness of God it has been imputed
[1:06:44] to you and to me thank God and it says
[1:06:48] that the righteousness of the flesh of
[1:06:50] the law rather might be fulfilled in us
[1:06:53] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:06:57] the spirit is the Holy Ghost amen
[1:07:02] not your human spirit but it's the Holy
[1:07:04] Ghost verse five and this is what our
[1:07:08] brother emphasized for they that are
[1:07:11] after the flesh do mind the things of
[1:07:15] the flesh amen
[1:07:17] your life will reflect what it what you
[1:07:23] are under control of what is controlling
[1:07:26] you is it your flesh is it your human
[1:07:30] spirit or is it the Holy Ghost amen
[1:07:33] for they that are after the flesh do
[1:07:36] mind the things of the flesh they're
[1:07:37] living for the flesh they're living to
[1:07:39] please sell amen the living do to do
[1:07:43] this to gain this to gain that in the
[1:07:45] natural realm amen but they that are
[1:07:49] after the spirit the things of the
[1:07:52] Spirit a man so we we we give
[1:07:55] preeminence to spiritual things we give
[1:07:58] pre evidence to the revelation of the
[1:07:59] word we get pre evidence to our Lord
[1:08:02] Jesus Christ a man we get preeminence to
[1:08:05] the Word of God for these are they that
[1:08:07] are after the spirit it's just to remind
[1:08:10] the things of the Spirit and what are
[1:08:12] the things
[1:08:13] spirit it's the word hey babe man shall
[1:08:16] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:08:18] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:08:19] God and again
[1:08:22] our brother highlights verse 6 for to be
[1:08:25] carnally minded is death to put the
[1:08:29] emphasis on the carnal things of life it
[1:08:31] is dead putting the emphasis on the
[1:08:34] natural things of life is dead
[1:08:37] amen but he said to be spiritually
[1:08:40] minded is life and peace and it's
[1:08:44] eternal amen not natural it's eternal
[1:08:47] through our Lord Jesus Christ so he said
[1:08:50] what are you carnally minded he said
[1:08:53] there and he said there our message
[1:08:54] believers that are currently minded yea
[1:08:56] this is what he was ministering on and
[1:08:58] it was it was it was he was
[1:09:00] straightforward so he said I want I want
[1:09:04] to get lay this and as a warning he says
[1:09:06] so that you're not walking in the flesh
[1:09:07] not walking after the flesh but after
[1:09:09] the spirit the Holy Spirit so he say if
[1:09:12] you're walking after the flesh you're
[1:09:14] currently minded you mind the things of
[1:09:16] the flesh you're caught up with the
[1:09:18] things of this world and the things of
[1:09:20] this life he said Amen that's what
[1:09:23] you're that's what you're focusing on
[1:09:24] but they said to be spiritually minded
[1:09:27] is life and peace and it's eternal Holy
[1:09:31] Ghost like only goes peace god bless
[1:09:34] this word you may be seated
[1:09:36] amen we're going to another scripture
[1:09:39] shortly but just to share something with
[1:09:46] you that the Lord should have brought to
[1:09:48] our attention in a devotional today and
[1:09:58] this was for today on May the 1st or no
[1:10:02] this is May the 1st not not today and it
[1:10:05] says the night cometh when no man can
[1:10:08] work
[1:10:10] and it says our Creator as designed men
[1:10:14] to work both mentally and physically
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:19] God wants you to work mentally and
[1:10:21] physically in order to enjoy a healthy
[1:10:23] life he said but
[1:10:26] there is also another vital dimension to
[1:10:29] our Labor's it's just not the natural
[1:10:32] life he said it's just not what we were
[1:10:35] enjoying in this world a man but he said
[1:10:39] there's something greater there's
[1:10:41] something more important and he said
[1:10:43] many years ago he said I put the
[1:10:46] following excerpt in my Bible as a
[1:10:49] reminder and as a challenge to be
[1:10:52] diligent in the most important labor of
[1:10:55] all now the natural labor that we're
[1:10:58] we're doing he said to earn this money
[1:11:00] or to earn that money to earn somebody's
[1:11:02] favor but he said the labor that we got
[1:11:05] to do and then we will do to earn God's
[1:11:08] favor a man because it is by grace God
[1:11:11] reveals that it is by grace that were
[1:11:13] able to light up with it a man and he
[1:11:16] highlighted one of the messengers of the
[1:11:18] age and he spoke concerning John Wesley
[1:11:22] a man and he said John Wesley are we
[1:11:28] going to do a John Wesley did is the
[1:11:31] Ministry of this hour going to do what
[1:11:33] John Wesley did are the believers of
[1:11:35] this hour are going to take John Wesley
[1:11:37] as an example of what God is requiring
[1:11:41] of us amen
[1:11:43] that a we have the Holy Ghost so we're
[1:11:45] going to reflect the attitude than a
[1:11:47] spirit that our that our brother John
[1:11:49] Wesley had many years ago and he said
[1:11:52] John Wesley traveled 250 thousand miles
[1:11:58] a man on horseback not 250 miles 200 a
[1:12:08] 50,000 miles on a horseback he never had
[1:12:12] the car or the vehicle than you and I am
[1:12:14] he never had a bicycle than they have a
[1:12:18] again in this stage he had a horse and
[1:12:21] there was a time when John Wesley was
[1:12:24] right he on his horse and he was going
[1:12:26] somewhere to preach the gospel and the
[1:12:28] horse going and stumbled into into a
[1:12:31] hole in the ground and the horse had
[1:12:36] broken his leg and what
[1:12:39] happen did John Wesley you know field
[1:12:41] just say absolutely discouraged and
[1:12:43] maybe go looking for another horse no he
[1:12:45] got off the horse he got down he laid
[1:12:48] his hands on the horse's leg and he
[1:12:50] prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:51] Christ and the leg was healed a man
[1:12:54] raised the name of the Lord the broken
[1:12:57] leg was put back to normal again and he
[1:13:00] got why because there was for the glory
[1:13:02] of God and it was for the purpose of God
[1:13:05] that he was doing what he was doing that
[1:13:07] he was going where he was going
[1:13:09] amen and I have I elated to the fact
[1:13:12] that that our that the government in
[1:13:14] England they went to John Wesley's house
[1:13:17] because they couldn't understand his
[1:13:19] text that he would file with the
[1:13:22] government at the end of a year because
[1:13:24] they thought that he was a rich man and
[1:13:27] why was he reporting just so small a
[1:13:30] salary he said concerning that all the
[1:13:33] money that he was collecting all the
[1:13:35] money that he was getting and so they
[1:13:37] came and they looked well they were even
[1:13:40] more shocked when they cut in his house
[1:13:41] a van because why because they only
[1:13:44] found maybe a glass
[1:13:46] they didn't find two or three or four no
[1:13:49] no they just found one glass they found
[1:13:51] once that one cup one plate and one for
[1:13:54] one knife one spoon and so that's what's
[1:13:56] going on here you know I knew a you
[1:13:58] don't have much here when it comes to
[1:14:00] furniture you only got this you only got
[1:14:01] that well it says all I need is I don't
[1:14:04] need anything else he said and they said
[1:14:07] well what have you done he said what all
[1:14:09] the money you got he said well I give
[1:14:10] that he said to others a man I give that
[1:14:13] to this one I give that to that way so
[1:14:15] for the glory of God amen praise the
[1:14:18] name of the Lord and brother it's her
[1:14:20] day it's shock there but again they
[1:14:22] couldn't they couldn't try to get any
[1:14:24] more taxes out of him why because he
[1:14:27] didn't keep the money a man for the
[1:14:30] grace of God to us mother a man God's
[1:14:33] grace to you God's grace to me then we
[1:14:36] not put the emphasis on Mary as I told
[1:14:38] you they will you did one of these days
[1:14:40] you're going to who you're going to
[1:14:41] write get up in the morning and hold
[1:14:42] nothing if you've got money in the bank
[1:14:44] you'll get up in the morning and you
[1:14:45] would own it a man because the day is
[1:14:48] coming when there's coming a government
[1:14:49] that's going to take it all oh yeah
[1:14:52] they'll take it all eventually they're
[1:14:54] going to take your money don't they take
[1:14:56] the money for the church everything why
[1:14:58] because that would that anti-crisis you
[1:15:00] it's got to paint take take the control
[1:15:02] of all the bills of all all the
[1:15:04] countries why because the one that got
[1:15:07] most gold is wrong
[1:15:09] yeah they got the most gold a man god
[1:15:13] Elvis brother to be on our guard got
[1:15:16] Elvis when I could have bought
[1:15:17] everything on natural things but I'm
[1:15:18] spiritual
[1:15:19] amen knowing that all these things are
[1:15:22] passing away
[1:15:23] amen and brother it's going to become a
[1:15:26] reality I believe we're going to be here
[1:15:28] for that oh yeah probably God sees our
[1:15:30] going to stay a little while and he said
[1:15:32] guys what for God's going to test you
[1:15:34] and try you definitely bring out the
[1:15:37] faith of the bride a man that our faith
[1:15:39] is in the breakroom our faith is not in
[1:15:41] ourselves a man god help us brother that
[1:15:45] we're going to put the emphasis on the
[1:15:47] Holy Ghost the evidence on the
[1:15:48] resurrection the emphasis on the rapture
[1:15:51] and give God the glory amen
[1:15:53] brother that's that's what that's what
[1:15:55] Wesley did that's why the other
[1:15:56] messengers did down through the ages
[1:15:58] amen and that's what even William
[1:16:02] Brennan did he received a lot of money
[1:16:03] but he give a lot of money oh yeah
[1:16:05] oh yeah he did and if somebody one of
[1:16:10] the brother Columbus brothers that came
[1:16:14] to me kaor came here for a weekend they
[1:16:17] told me I don't know I don't know what I
[1:16:19] don't know what brought it up or about
[1:16:21] it was they said oh yeah I should they
[1:16:23] condemned brother Branham he said we're
[1:16:25] doing this with the money and doing that
[1:16:27] with the money and doing that with the
[1:16:28] money yeah and a finally brother had to
[1:16:31] change at all a van because the
[1:16:33] government was taxing him on all of it
[1:16:35] but he was taking it and he was giving
[1:16:37] it to others yeah oh yeah so they were
[1:16:41] everything changed but I pray God help
[1:16:43] us brother give God the preeminence amen
[1:16:47] give God the pre evidence as John Wesley
[1:16:50] gave God the preeminence and that's why
[1:16:53] the government couldn't find anything in
[1:16:54] the bank in his name couldn't find
[1:16:56] anything in his house amen and when he
[1:16:59] died what did he find all he found was a
[1:17:01] few pennies in his pocket now for that
[1:17:03] that's was it there was as Richard
[1:17:06] he was a man so he says he traveled
[1:17:10] 250,000 miles on horseback an average of
[1:17:13] 20 miles a day for 40 years what are we
[1:17:18] doing for God most believers - they're
[1:17:22] just living for themselves that is the
[1:17:24] absolute truth brother don't I love
[1:17:26] regard they're not living for the body
[1:17:28] not live with a break delivering for
[1:17:30] themselves oh yeah
[1:17:32] doing what they want to do today I got
[1:17:34] to do this today I got to do that today
[1:17:35] knowing you got to serve God today do
[1:17:38] when it comes to the natural thing to do
[1:17:40] wasn't got to do and leave it yeah go on
[1:17:43] to the natural spiritual think on the
[1:17:45] Lord meditate on the Lord amen by the
[1:17:48] grace of Almighty God it's a challenge
[1:17:50] I'll tell you brother challenge to your
[1:17:52] faith do you have Holy Ghost faith or
[1:17:55] intellectual faith you do have it do you
[1:17:58] have a carnal fee fleshly faith
[1:18:01] do you have Holy Ghost faith my brother
[1:18:04] Chad is challenging that what faith do
[1:18:07] you have any merit many have a fleshly
[1:18:10] faith then they have an intellectual
[1:18:13] faith he says in your head but he says
[1:18:15] not in your heart because in your heart
[1:18:18] he said you live it in your life amen
[1:18:21] so get in let's get it out of the head
[1:18:24] let's get into the heart it's good a man
[1:18:26] the devil wants us to stop in our heads
[1:18:28] then the one who stopped in our marriage
[1:18:30] and think on the word think on this
[1:18:31] revelation that revelation or this
[1:18:33] doctrine a doctrine oh yeah oh yeah yeah
[1:18:35] yeah I believe it I believe it and then
[1:18:37] again one of those brothers to bring out
[1:18:39] oh the devil does too and I've brought
[1:18:43] that out here the devil does to a man
[1:18:45] brother but God is looking for a looking
[1:18:48] for a faith in our hearts go and be on
[1:18:50] Satan giving us victory over the devil
[1:18:52] by the grace of God and it says that
[1:18:55] John Wesley preached
[1:18:57] mazie John Wesley preached forty
[1:19:01] thousand servants well forty thousand in
[1:19:10] 40 years 40 thousand sermons may
[1:19:16] he was considered a fool it's like yeah
[1:19:20] maybe you know that he was walking one
[1:19:23] time they're going somewhere and and
[1:19:24] then the path was narrow and there was a
[1:19:27] man there and he says excuse me sir he
[1:19:28] said to would you move so I can go and
[1:19:31] he said I don't get it of the way for a
[1:19:33] fool that's what he said to John Wester
[1:19:36] John was I said I always do so he went
[1:19:39] he went around him and went on he read
[1:19:43] brother he wasn't a fool he was a fool
[1:19:46] in the eyes of man but not in the eyes
[1:19:48] of God a man it says he preached
[1:19:51] fourteen thousand sermons and produced
[1:19:55] four hundred books why he lived for God
[1:20:00] morning noon and night it was God God
[1:20:04] God amen
[1:20:06] morning noon and night it was preaching
[1:20:08] preaching sometimes he preached five
[1:20:09] times a day I told you and it's the
[1:20:12] truth that he would get up and he would
[1:20:14] go to the mines were they were mining
[1:20:17] the different things and he would preach
[1:20:20] to those that was ever going into the
[1:20:21] mine and then he would wait for those
[1:20:24] that came out of the mine and he would
[1:20:25] preach to them ain't man and then he
[1:20:28] would go on and he would preach
[1:20:29] somewhere else
[1:20:30] and he would go out and preach somewhere
[1:20:31] else then he would gather it in in in a
[1:20:33] cemetery and he would stand up on a upon
[1:20:36] a tombstone and preach why because he
[1:20:38] couldn't there wasn't enough room in the
[1:20:40] church for everybody
[1:20:41] amen so he because back then
[1:20:44] the graveyard was all around the church
[1:20:47] and so he would go out there in the yard
[1:20:49] and just stand on a tombstone and preach
[1:20:52] yeah my oh my oh my we got to have this
[1:20:55] over oh we can't go to church we got to
[1:20:57] have this so we can't preach we got to
[1:20:59] got to do it this way
[1:21:00] amen brother just preach amen by the
[1:21:04] grace of God and it says over light like
[1:21:08] I said I've seen Saints even in this
[1:21:11] hour believers even in this hour brother
[1:21:14] than in the wintertime because they're
[1:21:15] not allowed religion in their country I
[1:21:18] said I've seen the pictures of crew
[1:21:20] believes going out into the wilderness
[1:21:22] with amaryllis amen and raining and
[1:21:26] snowing oh yeah radiation
[1:21:29] and in this day in this hour sometimes
[1:21:32] in history in America in Canada we got
[1:21:34] to have everything this way everything's
[1:21:35] got to be perfect everything gotta be
[1:21:36] quiet everything got to be comfortable
[1:21:38] brother was it comfortable for Jesus
[1:21:44] tempted in all points like as we are yet
[1:21:46] without seeing a man in any supper this
[1:21:49] none of us would suffer that's right
[1:21:52] that's why he says identify with him in
[1:21:54] the power of his resurrection but go on
[1:21:57] the Fellowship of his suffering most are
[1:22:02] not identifying with the Fellowship of
[1:22:03] his suffering amen
[1:22:06] oh they think to identify with the power
[1:22:07] of his resurrection but where's the
[1:22:10] Fellowship of his suffering yeah because
[1:22:14] he did it for you so what are you gonna
[1:22:16] do for him he laid down his life for you
[1:22:19] now you lay down your life for him by
[1:22:21] the grace of God John Wesley did Martin
[1:22:24] Luther did a million other messengers
[1:22:28] did and I believe the Bible of God in
[1:22:31] this age he did oh yeah he was attacked
[1:22:35] by many he was challenged to stop
[1:22:39] preaching what he preached oh yeah
[1:22:42] and if ministering brethren today that
[1:22:44] our challenge to stop reaching that
[1:22:46] because only wanted to focus on is the
[1:22:48] doctrine or they want to focus on our
[1:22:50] honesty or this message or that message
[1:22:52] or this message brother but they don't
[1:22:54] want to focus on personal line up with
[1:22:58] the word amen see Jake Joshua and Caleb
[1:23:02] to go into the promised land God
[1:23:06] required something and because they
[1:23:09] wouldn't do it God killed him in the
[1:23:11] wilderness not Joshua and Caleb but
[1:23:15] those that didn't believe those just see
[1:23:18] God brought them out God did this guy do
[1:23:22] there and there are the signs of the
[1:23:23] winners and the power and the miracles
[1:23:26] that God did in Egypt amen and even
[1:23:30] coming out of Egypt and going to cross
[1:23:33] the river dry land
[1:23:35] oh my amazing
[1:23:38] and and when the Egyptians followed them
[1:23:40] God God God let the waters come down and
[1:23:43] drown them amen
[1:23:45] and they went here and all the pillar of
[1:23:48] fire was in front of them and the pillar
[1:23:49] of fire will go behind them
[1:23:50] - what for to stop the enemy to blame
[1:23:53] the enemy amen and God destroyed them oh
[1:23:57] and he still wouldn't believe God to
[1:23:59] entrust kheh and in the wilderness God
[1:24:01] provided meat and men and God provided
[1:24:04] two bread for him out of heaven and so
[1:24:06] on oh my
[1:24:08] one more what much how much more must
[1:24:10] God do to get to get our faith to get us
[1:24:14] to really really belly and and walk in
[1:24:17] the will of God as Joshua and Caleb ate
[1:24:20] me no they wouldn't do it
[1:24:23] this is absolutely there shows brother
[1:24:25] that they never had the seed of God in
[1:24:27] their heart

[1:27:11] thoughts and the intellect no that's
[1:27:13] what the cat's the kernel person and if
[1:27:16] he kindly minded is dead yeah but to be
[1:27:20] spiritually minded is life and peace and
[1:27:23] that's the Holy Ghost in control so what
[1:27:26] you do you don't do because you figure
[1:27:28] it out in your head forget that got to
[1:27:31] come out of your art amen and brother
[1:27:36] that's what that's what's caused a lot
[1:27:39] of problems with with the church all the
[1:27:40] way down through the ages why it's the
[1:27:43] spiritual mind and the carnal mind hey
[1:27:46] may they dealt with it right here
[1:27:48] in the first stage and we know it's the
[1:27:52] deeds of the Nicolaitans yeah and it
[1:27:56] comes on down and this spirit gets him
[1:27:57] and that spirit gets in another spirit
[1:27:59] hey Mary right the devil bringing
[1:28:03] confusion
[1:28:04] amen brother you still doing it even
[1:28:07] around the message of the hour so
[1:28:10] brother sister our brother our brother
[1:28:12] John Wesley preached all those sermons
[1:28:13] forty thousand servants and he produced
[1:28:18] four hundred books and he knew ten
[1:28:22] languages well I know English and I knew
[1:28:34] fenice but I wonder how many of us ear
[1:28:39] have spoken in attending our other
[1:28:41] tongues not many the prophet of God say
[1:28:45] if you're a believer you'll speak in
[1:28:47] tongues yeah someone said there's a
[1:28:53] brother Branham one time he said I was
[1:28:55] in a meeting and he said I heard this
[1:28:57] and he said like they were speaking in
[1:28:59] tongues they believed that and he was
[1:29:02] trying to impersonate it too brother
[1:29:03] Branham and he said brother Brent was
[1:29:05] that God and the Prophet said brother
[1:29:07] I'm still not able to judge God and yet
[1:29:13] like I told you that I that I had a
[1:29:16] supper table and then it's your brother
[1:29:20] that was sitting next to me he was was
[1:29:22] making fun of speaking in tongues and he
[1:29:25] even tried to impersonate it by using a
[1:29:29] certain regular English word and we
[1:29:35] understood the word he was saying but he
[1:29:36] made it trying to say oh yeah that's
[1:29:38] like speaking in tongues
[1:29:40] that's the Lord forgive him I said
[1:29:43] please don't let him do that the prophet
[1:29:47] of God said he wasn't even a judge God
[1:29:50] what would make him able to judge God
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:55] as I said I remember when I was baptized
[1:29:58] in Pentecost and I was looking for the
[1:30:00] Holy Ghost now praying for the Holy
[1:30:02] Ghost i lord i want your life in me a
[1:30:04] man and and I went up to the altar in
[1:30:07] the Pentecostal church it was Elam and
[1:30:10] and I another time I there's a number of
[1:30:13] people that come and pray for me
[1:30:14] ministers come and pray for me and other
[1:30:16] brothers because the dollars were
[1:30:17] usually
[1:30:18] filled and this will lay danced over the
[1:30:20] laid hands on you and prayed for you
[1:30:22] another time I went I got up and the
[1:30:24] altar was filled so I went I went to a
[1:30:26] seat a man I went to not the front seat
[1:30:28] but the next seat and and I knelt down
[1:30:30] and I started to pray amen and there's
[1:30:32] others in other seats praying and again

[1:30:44] grace of God in my life and so on and I

[1:44:24] and that's truth where are the believers
[1:44:26] that are serving one another
[1:44:27] where are the believers then living from
[1:44:29] one another yeah that are that are

[1:45:52] concerning the eagle my brother Hank
[1:45:54] Bobby Thompson yeah and we would
[1:45:58] consider it Baptists yeah but I did some
[1:46:02] research and I found that he's his link
[1:46:05] he's on message believers a number of
[1:46:10] message believers pages they got this
[1:46:13] link this link this link and I was
[1:46:16] surprised when it kind of oh here's the
[1:46:18] one we heard Bobby Thompson concerning
[1:46:22] Eagles yeah it's amazing he sound like a
[1:46:28] message believer way he was preaching
[1:46:30] I understand there's ruther Matthew said
[1:46:33] he would've met a 40 years ago that he
[1:46:34] then he breached it oh yeah he wouldn't
[1:46:38] he wouldn't last long in the Baptist
[1:46:39] Church today preaching that no no no and
[1:46:44] of course it's getting to the place
[1:46:45] where wouldn't last long in a message
[1:46:47] church that's right because the people
[1:46:49] we just want just we just preach a
[1:46:51] doctrine don't get personal
[1:46:54] well God's gonna get personal a man he
[1:46:58] got personal with Peter thank God for
[1:47:01] Peter a man he's the example for you and
[1:47:04] me brother Amen Jesus got personal with
[1:47:07] him when he was here and after Jesus
[1:47:09] laid down his life picked it up again
[1:47:11] and came back he still got personal with
[1:47:13] Peter and he challenged Peters faith a
[1:47:15] man but he knew Peter was gonna was
[1:47:19] going to get what he was lacking on the
[1:47:21] day of Pentecost he got the baptism of
[1:47:24] divine love cuz Jesus kept saying lover
[1:47:27] stuff me lover semi-lattice thought me a
[1:47:30] man Peter was going from filial to agape
[1:47:35] love human love divine love and so on so
[1:47:39] but he needed the baptism of divine love
[1:47:42] to know what it was all about I don't
[1:47:44] know what Christ did amen
[1:47:47] a brother of the day of Pentecost the
[1:47:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism
[1:47:51] of divine law because God is not you
[1:47:57] know as their only definition of God in
[1:48:00] the Bible it says God is a spirit but
[1:48:02] when it comes to his nature is character
[1:48:04] God is love
[1:48:05] amen is that the only death is that the
[1:48:09] explanation of your nature oh brother
[1:48:12] Shawn's own sister zones or their love
[1:48:14] what oh yes their love you know them can
[1:48:21] they say your listen I met someone the
[1:48:27] other day and I'm sure their Christian
[1:48:31] how'd you know that their spirit and
[1:48:34] their attitude I know that they they
[1:48:38] have a Christian spirit and a Christian
[1:48:40] attitude and a Christian action and so
[1:48:42] on let me say it for the glory of God
[1:48:47] that when I worked for the American
[1:48:53] military I was a cookie and I was a also
[1:49:02] cooking where they call it where they
[1:49:05] would taken it out they would call and
[1:49:08] pick it up no did they would call in an
[1:49:15] order and I would make the order and get
[1:49:17] it ready for them they pick it up it was
[1:49:19] the American military soldiers and so on
[1:49:22] and and I was also helping the cooks in
[1:49:25] the kitchen
[1:49:26] and one of the cooks I never heard it
[1:49:29] too many years a number of years later
[1:49:35] they said you know the cook that you he
[1:49:39] was the chef that you work with said yes
[1:49:41] I know
[1:49:45] well they said I was advised the other
[1:49:51] day that he told somebody that he only
[1:49:59] met one Christian star Xenu
[1:50:04] he said I don't I've only met one
[1:50:05] Christian he said in the world that I
[1:50:08] know of and he said that was he said a
[1:50:12] young man that I work with in Goose Bay
[1:50:16] and he said it was Jarrell lush they
[1:50:20] said y-yeah I said sir they said
[1:50:24] everybody just considered him a
[1:50:27] Christian in in in the kitchen in the
[1:50:29] dining area everywhere nice at all
[1:50:33] I swore to God be the glory I said it's
[1:50:37] certainly not me I said it's the Laurie
[1:50:39] oh yeah and I thank God further for the
[1:50:43] respect that they had for me
[1:50:46] so to God be the glory and I also worked
[1:50:50] with Pentecostals I work with different
[1:50:52] religious people but he said could
[1:50:56] relate his attitude and his spirit he
[1:50:58] said I felt was Christian he said I
[1:51:01] won't forget it
[1:51:02] or to God be the glory so brother sister
[1:51:06] if you got a testimony give God the
[1:51:07] glory because there's not me that lives
[1:51:10] this Christ that liveth in me a man if I
[1:51:13] do anything right it's got to be Christ
[1:51:14] if I say anything right it's got to be
[1:51:17] Jesus anybody it's not me it's Jesus so
[1:51:20] brother I pray grace oh my lord what a
[1:51:24] testimony not a witness amen
[1:51:27] for the grace of God and he said again
[1:51:30] regardless of where we live we are
[1:51:32] surrounded by lonely earning fearful
[1:51:34] people our Lord is not willing that any
[1:51:36] of these should perish are they
[1:51:38] important enough for us to take time out
[1:51:41] of our busy schedules and reach out to
[1:51:44] minister to their needs and is one of
[1:51:47] the frequently neglected areas of
[1:51:49] overreach may even lie in our own
[1:51:51] congregations where struggles and trials
[1:51:54] are often concealed from the casual
[1:51:57] observer amen and
[1:51:59] again this was the beside still waters
[1:52:04] devotional they first amazing and the
[1:52:11] prophet of God had respect for them for
[1:52:13] that particular church oh yeah he did
[1:52:16] and he said I'm not sure the religion
[1:52:19] now but he did say if he did this did
[1:52:22] that EBE be a good believer in that
[1:52:25] church he'd be considered a good
[1:52:27] believer a man grace of God no mind
[1:52:31] didn't mean to take that much time but
[1:52:34] the will of God be done it's giving the
[1:52:37] people what they need it's what our
[1:52:39] brother preached amen that we give it
[1:52:42] and then you receive it but and brother
[1:52:46] I think God's ministry in it because of
[1:52:48] the lateness of the hour and brother if
[1:52:51] God's looking for anything to rapture
[1:52:53] that's what he's looking for that right
[1:52:55] spirit and that right attitude brother
[1:52:57] the anointing that Luther had been
[1:52:59] knowing that Wesley had plus denying
[1:53:01] that the Pentecostals had plus a man oh
[1:53:04] yeah we don't do away with Luther and
[1:53:06] Wesley and Penny and Pentecost amen
[1:53:09] God's requiring that plus he guys and I
[1:53:12] just were just pushing them aside and
[1:53:14] giving us this then push off the side
[1:53:16] give them that no no no he gave Luther
[1:53:18] that and then he added Wesley then he
[1:53:20] added the Pentecostals and now it's too
[1:53:23] bright amen
[1:53:24] God is adding to the revelation hey man
[1:53:27] so the fullness of the of the word is
[1:53:30] revealed amen bear with me Oh
[1:53:38] hard to believe in over an hour well
[1:53:42] John Wesley wouldn't worry about it he
[1:53:47] meant and again I'll be honest I wish I
[1:53:51] had I wish I could have preached another
[1:53:53] three or four servings a week oh yeah
[1:53:57] you do oh yes most definitely
[1:54:01] why because I recognize the lateness of
[1:54:04] the hour
[1:54:07] and I recognize the need for more and
[1:54:10] more of that revelation of that word
[1:54:12] amen recognize the need to die more and
[1:54:15] more to ourselves and become more more
[1:54:17] alive sensitive to the word Amen faith
[1:54:21] comes by hearing the word and if you're
[1:54:25] going to have resurrection rupturing
[1:54:26] faith it's by hearing the word very man
[1:54:30] not intellectually but in your heart in
[1:54:32] your soul and you're dead and the word
[1:54:35] is alive in you
[1:54:36] amen so that you're giving the
[1:54:39] preeminence you can't get away from it
[1:54:40] the resurrection you can't get away from
[1:54:42] the revelation of the rapture I don't
[1:54:44] know
[1:54:45] morning no Luther couldn't get away from
[1:54:47] justification and if and if Wesley
[1:54:50] preached as much as he did he couldn't
[1:54:52] get away from the revelation of
[1:54:53] sanctification what God had done a man
[1:54:56] in Christ for them now he's getting the
[1:54:58] people to rejoice in it it's done we're
[1:55:00] sanctified we're sanctified come on
[1:55:02] praise the Lord we're sanctified Jesus
[1:55:03] sanctified us Jesus justified us a man
[1:55:06] now Jesus give us the baptism of the
[1:55:09] Holy Ghost and the resurrection and the
[1:55:11] rapture now he's asking us to believe
[1:55:14] that they they went and declared the
[1:55:18] revelation God gave them now let's
[1:55:20] declare the revelation that God has
[1:55:21] given us now just think that he ought me
[1:55:24] of the word and again going back to what
[1:55:26] we preach willed me of the word and the
[1:55:28] revelation of the seven seals it's a
[1:55:30] third pole for rapturing faith now
[1:55:34] that's what the Prophet told us youth he
[1:55:40] wanted to stay for the rapture but he
[1:55:42] said he got he felt God had ordained for
[1:55:44] him to go on but he said again why cry
[1:55:50] speak he said if one child one boy one
[1:55:54] girl one man one woman would raised her
[1:55:56] hands their Lord or coming home and he
[1:55:58] said that will treat her the rapture
[1:56:01] this one's gonna be caught up that one's
[1:56:03] gonna be cut off that one but it begins
[1:56:05] he's not going to be many not living
[1:56:07] Saints
[1:56:09] when we're going to go as a thief in the
[1:56:13] night as a thief in the night and not
[1:56:19] many know when the thief comes and goes
[1:56:22] yeah and it's in the night but he said
[1:56:25] you're not children of night your
[1:56:26] children on the day turn of the light
[1:56:29] you're late
[1:56:30] walking the light amen the revelation of
[1:56:32] the Resurrection revelations rapture you
[1:56:34] let's be among the missing ones by the
[1:56:37] grace of God amen this was a quote that
[1:56:44] our brother Carson had given me so quite
[1:56:46] some time ago and it says never before
[1:56:52] as the Church of the Living God endure
[1:56:57] such attacks from the devil and that's
[1:57:00] true
[1:57:02] we need one another's love and when we
[1:57:06] do this we fulfill the law of Christ
[1:57:10] this is something that we can do our
[1:57:13] absolute best at knowing that it is the
[1:57:16] right thing to do it is the essence of
[1:57:19] the law to do our utmost for one another
[1:57:22] hmm amazing encouraging our brothers and
[1:57:27] sisters in the faith so what are we
[1:57:31] waiting for reach out to someone today
[1:57:35] and let them know there is a Living God
[1:57:41] he said a person who lives their life
[1:57:44] for their self lives a selfish life and
[1:57:47] most believers today are living selfish
[1:57:50] lives yeah he's
[1:57:55] we must live for others this was in 1950
[1:57:59] and the message was entitled at thy word
[1:58:03] we must live our lives for others and
[1:58:06] burying one another's burdens
[1:58:08] oh don't just push it off in their lap
[1:58:13] take it on your shoulder
[1:58:16] bear one another's burdens pray for one
[1:58:19] another be there to help one another
[1:58:23] amen by the grace of God sure you're
[1:58:29] praying grace Lord to help this brother
[1:58:30] bless this sister or they need your help
[1:58:33] Lord
[1:58:34] bear ye one another's burdens and so
[1:58:37] fulfill the law of Christ and we got to
[1:58:43] have a feeling for one another and
[1:58:45] therefore when we do when you do all you
[1:58:48] know - how to do then when you do lay
[1:58:50] down at night well you have the
[1:58:54] consolation knowing that you tried your
[1:58:57] best and I mean that knowing that you
[1:59:02] did your best for the Lord and for the
[1:59:06] body of Christ amen brother then it
[1:59:11] proves that you're an overcomer by the
[1:59:14] grace of Almighty God amen
[1:59:18] turn with me for the next few moments
[1:59:21] here to Hebrews the book of Hebrews
[1:59:27] chapter c2
[1:59:36] the book of Hebrews chapter 2 beginning
[1:59:41] to read at verse 1 and it was either not
[1:59:48] sure and either brother Spencer or
[1:59:52] brother lamb that quoted this descriptor
[1:59:57] therefore we ought to give the more
[1:59:59] earnest heed to the things which we have
[2:00:03] heard lest at any time we should let
[2:00:07] them slip or that we should slip away
[2:00:12] from them and our brother one of their
[2:00:16] brothers there was bringing out that
[2:00:17] revelation that many a believer is
[2:00:20] slipping away from the revelation of the
[2:00:22] word many a believers slipping away from
[2:00:25] the revelation of the message this
[2:00:26] revelation that revelation why because
[2:00:29] they are currently minded and not
[2:00:31] spiritually minded so he said give the
[2:00:37] more earnest heed to the things which we
[2:00:40] have heard and how many believers are
[2:00:41] really putting the emphasis on there
[2:00:43] were on the message morning noon and
[2:00:46] night thanking God for it experiencing
[2:00:51] the revelation the rapturing faith
[2:00:54] resurrection faith amen
[2:00:56] this is the faith that God is looking
[2:00:57] for beyond the faith that he was looking
[2:01:02] for in Luther and Wesley and the
[2:01:04] Pentecostals he's looking for a
[2:01:05] resurrection rapturing faith amen and
[2:01:09] brother for overcomers were experiencing
[2:01:13] resurrection in rap for anything that's
[2:01:17] right you had he resurrected and we had
[2:01:20] been caught up into heavenly places in
[2:01:23] Christ Jesus and the father God said
[2:01:25] what's going on there the words been
[2:01:27] revealed and what's it for so we can
[2:01:31] rapture our bodies and be changed in a
[2:01:33] moment in the twenty of and I a man
[2:01:38] we ought to give them more earnest heed
[2:01:41] while people are giving earnest heed to
[2:01:44] the natural things of life but what
[2:01:45] about the spiritual to the things which
[2:01:48] we have heard and give the more earnest
[2:01:51] heed to what you've heard tonight lest
[2:01:53] at any time we should let them slip or
[2:01:56] that we should slip away from them don't
[2:02:01] slip away from the word don't step away
[2:02:03] from the message don't step away from
[2:02:05] what God has done and God is doing no if
[2:02:09] we do we're gonna miss the resurrection
[2:02:12] and the rapture and we'll be numbered
[2:02:15] with those who are going to be looking
[2:02:16] for it and reminded that it's past and
[2:02:18] didn't know it for if the word spoken by
[2:02:23] angels were steadfast and every
[2:02:25] transgression and disobedience received
[2:02:28] a just recompense of reward
[2:02:31] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[2:02:34] great salvation which had the first
[2:02:37] began to be spoken by the Lord and was
[2:02:41] confirmed unto us by them that heard him
[2:02:44] hallelujah God also bearing them witness
[2:02:47] both with signs and wonders and with
[2:02:52] divers miracles and gifts of the Holy
[2:02:55] Ghost according to his own will not your
[2:03:00] will is will for your life so let's give
[2:03:04] the more earnest heed lest at any time
[2:03:07] we find that we are slipping away from
[2:03:11] the revelation of the rapture slipping
[2:03:15] away from the revelation of the
[2:03:16] resurrection why because we're more
[2:03:19] caught up with the natural things of
[2:03:20] life than the spiritual we're given
[2:03:23] earnest heed to doing this doing this
[2:03:25] the natural the natural I got to do this
[2:03:27] I got to do this yeah what about the
[2:03:28] Lord
[2:03:29] oh well Lord I'll see you Wednesday Lord
[2:03:32] I'll see you Sunday Lord I'll talk to
[2:03:35] you tomorrow in the morning or maybe
[2:03:38] before I go to bed no you got to talk to
[2:03:43] him morning noon and night 24 hours a
[2:03:45] day even when you sleep your heart is
[2:03:48] community
[2:03:50] he's in your heart by the power of the
[2:03:54] Holy Ghost unfortunately many make sure
[2:04:03] you got the Holy Ghost in your heart if
[2:04:09] not you'll be found slipping away from
[2:04:12] the word slipping away
[2:04:14] not necessarily intellectually but
[2:04:17] spiritually well if you know it
[2:04:20] spiritually if he experienced the
[2:04:21] message spiritually then it controls
[2:04:23] your life but if you got it
[2:04:25] intellectually no it just controls your
[2:04:27] thoughts and you can be religious and
[2:04:30] you can talk this and say this and say
[2:04:32] that yeah but don't don't say it show it
[2:04:38] by the grace of God so that they can see
[2:04:42] it in your spirit and in your attitude
[2:04:44] yeah and again that time in Goose Bay
[2:04:53] there was an elderly man that was
[2:04:59] working there and basically I was the I
[2:05:03] was the head over the over the those
[2:05:06] employees back then and I remember just

[2:05:38] spirit and your attitude I said well

[2:05:44] the Lord bless you yeah he was he was an
[2:05:46] elderly man I was very young then I

[2:05:52] that 20 years old and I said well I said
[2:05:55] to God be the glory I see interested and
[2:05:57] God bless you
[2:05:59] and again I don't let it go on and pop
[2:06:03] me up I want it to puff up the Lord I
[2:06:06] wanted to give God the glory any man you
[2:06:10] want to give God the glory let him see
[2:06:12] Christ in you
[2:06:13] amen and give the glory to him you're
[2:06:16] not going to boast no accepted the Lord
[2:06:19] by the grace of God a man I have to
[2:06:27] finish with this it's naughty that
[2:06:30] starts is he that finishes man he
[2:06:35] started the race but there's one
[2:06:38] finishing it there will be many churches
[2:06:41] start many groups of people there will
[2:06:44] be one group finish that's the
[2:06:46] overcomers a man now he said we want to
[2:06:53] know how to overcome Jesus told us how
[2:06:57] to do it
[2:06:58] he said it's humility he said gird
[2:07:04] yourself or you gonna girded of Jesus
[2:07:07] girded himself took a towel wash the
[2:07:11] disciples feet and wake them and the
[2:07:14] very God of heaven humiliated himself
[2:07:20] amazing that God got down and washed the
[2:07:25] disciples feet amen grace brother your
[2:07:33] table of grace I merited favor grace
[2:07:39] Jesus magnified it that's right he said
[2:07:44] we don't want to be humiliated he said
[2:07:49] but greatness he said humiliates itself
[2:07:52] grace almost itself
[2:07:56] he said I've had the privilege of
[2:07:58] getting he said meaning some great man
[2:08:01] and it's these guys has got a change of
[2:08:04] clothing and fifty cents in their pocket
[2:08:07] to rattle and he said that's the guy
[2:08:10] that thinks he's something that he wants
[2:08:11] when he's
[2:08:12] nothing but he said I stood with a great
[2:08:14] man I mean great man with ragged sleeves
[2:08:18] cuffs and he said they make you think
[2:08:21] you're the great person and he says see
[2:08:25] greatness is humility don't forget that
[2:08:27] church greatness is expressed in
[2:08:30] humility and he said I don't mean dirty
[2:08:33] I mean humble in spirit I'm talking
[2:08:37] about humility genuine humility not some
[2:08:39] of us put on something that is real
[2:08:42] humility he said and overcome means to
[2:08:47] stand the test a man and every day that
[2:08:52] were were tested God tests us oh yeah
[2:08:55] sometimes he allows the enemy to come by
[2:08:57] and test you to bring out what spirit
[2:08:59] you're off to bring up the to prove to
[2:09:03] the enemy that it's your it's his spirit
[2:09:05] in you it's not you the lives as Christ
[2:09:08] liveth in you amen brother god help us
[2:09:12] that we're going to humble ourselves and
[2:09:16] brother if you humble yourself to anyone
[2:09:19] is to one another yeah brother Brown
[2:09:24] says you don't consider yourself any
[2:09:26] better or even bigger than somebody else
[2:09:29] you should you put yourself on the same
[2:09:31] level
[2:09:31] oh yeah we're all whether it's you or me
[2:09:37] we're sinners saved by grace Lord thank
[2:09:44] you for saving my brother and sister and
[2:09:46] thank you for saving me amen
[2:09:51] so we overcome means to stand the test
[2:09:57] by the grace of God Jesus overcome the
[2:10:02] grave all the word and humility a man he
[2:10:08] said overcome means to recognize the
[2:10:10] devil at every one of his tricks so
[2:10:16] don't let the devil trick you with your
[2:10:20] thoughts well I'm going to do this I
[2:10:22] think we should do this I think we
[2:10:24] should do that do what God wants you to
[2:10:26] do
[2:10:26] the leadership of the Holy Ghost is not
[2:10:29] Satan Oh No
[2:10:31] if a Satan is controlling your thoughts
[2:10:33] you get you to do in everything that's
[2:10:35] contrary to the will of God
[2:10:37] hey man you'll get you eating there
[2:10:41] might be just a little bit here a little
[2:10:42] bit there yet but if it's contrary to
[2:10:44] the will of God brother one word in the
[2:10:49] eyes of God it's the whole truth amen
[2:10:53] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:10:54] every word that proceeds out the mouth
[2:10:56] of God and to disbelieve one word in the
[2:11:01] eyes of God you just believe it all so
[2:11:07] overcome means to recognize the devil at
[2:11:09] every one of his tricks
[2:11:10] and a lot of people say there is no
[2:11:12] devil it's just a thought don't you
[2:11:14] believe that he said there is a real
[2:11:17] devil and he's just as real as you are
[2:11:19] anybody a real devil he said and you
[2:11:22] must recognize him real you must know
[2:11:25] he's a devil please don't go out there
[2:11:28] and live the life and think that think
[2:11:30] that oh no no the devil is always over
[2:11:32] there somewhere he's out there doing
[2:11:33] that he said they're doing that no he's
[2:11:34] right there on your heels
[2:11:37] father God said he's been on the heels
[2:11:39] of the bride ever since Calvary he was
[2:11:43] on the heels of the bridegroom and he
[2:11:45] and he put him on the on the cross and
[2:11:47] he got the people to a turn against him
[2:11:49] to crucify you and Jesus willingly
[2:11:52] willingly let them do it because he
[2:11:55] could have called the Father twelve
[2:11:57] legions of angels to destroy the world
[2:11:59] set him free but he didn't do it and the
[2:12:02] devil was their brother and brother and
[2:12:05] now he's on the heels of the bride
[2:12:07] that's right he said all the way down
[2:12:09] through the search ages he's been on the
[2:12:11] heels of the bride how much more is he
[2:12:13] on the use of the bride to sort of deign
[2:12:14] to the resurrection rapture Satan has
[2:12:17] seen things that the believers don't see
[2:12:20] yeah
[2:12:22] now the true believers see it but the
[2:12:24] make believers don't see it as they
[2:12:27] should please don't let the devil
[2:12:29] deceive you
[2:12:33] so either there's a real devil and you
[2:12:35] must recognize him real you must know
[2:12:38] he's a devil and to overcome you must
[2:12:41] recognize that God in you is greater and
[2:12:44] mightier than II and he said the one
[2:12:47] that's in you as already ready overcome
[2:12:50] him the devil and by His grace you're
[2:12:54] more than a match for him amen
[2:12:56] there's real there he said is real
[2:12:59] overcoming a man but remember a greater
[2:13:03] is He that is in you than he that is in
[2:13:05] the world he said you must realize that
[2:13:09] the Holy Spirit is in you has already
[2:13:11] overcome this thing and he's in you and
[2:13:14] you can overcome by him by the Holy
[2:13:18] Ghost amen
[2:13:20] I had to stop there but I want you to
[2:13:22] understand again why did brother Brown
[2:13:25] preach this I hope you haven't forgotten
[2:13:30] it it's because it's amazing but he
[2:13:36] explained that air in the air did the
[2:13:38] Indus message he preaches it because he
[2:13:43] was recognizing that many in Brenham
[2:13:45] Tabernacle were not overcomers 1963 in
[2:13:50] August and we'll get to it eventually
[2:13:54] where he he highlights that there's many
[2:13:59] I'll tell you this is like I've said it
[2:14:01] so often before then if the Prophet were
[2:14:03] to come back he wouldn't he wouldn't say
[2:14:05] nothing both denominations and those
[2:14:06] churches are there he would just focus
[2:14:09] on the message churches why God what are
[2:14:12] you recognizing about him tabernacle
[2:14:14] he's recognizing in-seok among among
[2:14:16] so-called believers around the world a
[2:14:19] lack of Resurrection and rapturing faith
[2:14:22] a man he would recognize that they were
[2:14:25] not overcomers they had not gone on to
[2:14:28] perfection they had not gone on to the
[2:14:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and
[2:14:32] become overcomers overcoming the world
[2:14:36] the flesh and the devil because the
[2:14:39] Prophet was recognizing that even in
[2:14:41] Brenham tabernacle in 1963 many we're
[2:14:44] starting to take
[2:14:45] the ways of the world and the things of
[2:14:47] the world they wanted more and more and
[2:14:49] more he said you want to be like the
[2:14:51] world you ought to be like he said those
[2:14:54] are there in denominations yeah he said
[2:14:58] I'll keep preaching it to you stop doing
[2:14:59] it yeah yeah so he kept emphasizing that
[2:15:06] he kept laying in that Lane in the the
[2:15:08] hints here and there so I pray the grace
[2:15:10] of God help us brother yeah we're good
[2:15:14] that we're going to become overcomers of
[2:15:16] the world the flesh and the devil
[2:15:18] amen so if the prophet Cohn he wouldn't
[2:15:21] have to preach how can I overcome to
[2:15:24] this church because we are overcomers
[2:15:27] you are an overcomer the life you live
[2:15:30] proves you're an overcomer Amen by the
[2:15:33] grace of God your attitude your spirit
[2:15:35] toward one another proves you're an
[2:15:37] overcomer amen as he overcame we
[2:15:42] overcome because it's Christ in me amen
[2:15:46] I'll tell you this I pray God that you
[2:15:49] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost not
[2:15:52] the Holy Ghost because again as the
[2:15:56] Prophet said I wanted to know we said
[2:15:58] that Christ that Antichrist our twins in
[2:16:00] the same church so make sure you're
[2:16:04] worshiping the right one anyway
[2:16:07] you're worshiping Christ not Antichrist
[2:16:09] and then brother in the in the last days
[2:16:12] they're gonna be worshipping the devil
[2:16:14] thinking they're worshiping God so god
[2:16:17] help us brother there were gonna be
[2:16:19] overcomers of that deception in our
[2:16:22] lives by the grace of God so to give
[2:16:26] them more earnest heed to the things we
[2:16:28] have heard lest at any time that we
[2:16:31] would let them slip or slip away from
[2:16:33] them they meant grace to us if I pray
[2:16:37] amen
[2:16:38] nor bless you let's stand
[2:16:46] praise the Lord
[2:16:53] amen this thing we shall see the king
