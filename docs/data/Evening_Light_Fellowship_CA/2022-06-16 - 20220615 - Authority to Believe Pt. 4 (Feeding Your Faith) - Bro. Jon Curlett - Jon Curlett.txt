able to be here lord we pray your ministry and grace to each one in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen amen thank you musicians man if you'll turn the scriptures to romans chapter 10 romans chapter 10 and then certainly good to have i believe it's sister amber is that is that her name did i hear that right sister amber back amen and i thought i saw matt crack a smile earlier as well so i think he's i think he's happy happy to have his wife back i think we're happy to have his wife back and then so it's good to have her back and not an easy trip sister amber i know but it's good to have you back here and trusting god's grace and comfort to be with you and then blanc and the kids had a a good trip down it was a long day for them almost 20 hours from start to finish but no complications they sailed through customs and no no issues whatsoever so we praise god for that and then i believe sister rebecca katuka is leaving this week to go back to labrador they're not here tonight i'm not sure but i believe they're leaving to go back they may be here sunday but if not we certainly wish her and the family well as they go home for the summer to be with uh her husband and their father and whatnot so god's grace to them remember romans 10 and and start at verse 8 says the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession has made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen god bless you you can have your seats this evening amen i want to continue on this the series we touched on and left off i think over a month ago since we last spoke on it on the authority to believe and i want to just take a a little topic here tonight of feeding your faith and then feeding your faith and i want to just do a very quick recap here if if that's okay just for a moment to to touch on some of the key elements as we go to this because it's with a series you always want to kind of go sequentially and everyone's fresh and it's in their mind and whatnot but we've had a bit of a break here um so i want you to remember about how we talked about faith and we showed that the faith you have for salvation the faith that makes you step out into water baptism to accept jesus christ as your lord and savior is no different than the faith that you have for healing for deliverance for provision and all these different things amen it's one faith for all of them now it may be applied differently you may be something that you approach a little differently but it's all the same faith for all of those things in our lives in ephesians 4 it says there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism so don't go looking for a different faith don't say well i don't have the faith i need for healing i don't have the faith i need to trust god no you have the faith it's all one faith if you had it once you'll have it forever and then he doesn't give it and take it away god's not in you know the the proverbial indian giver i don't know if we're allowed to say that anymore but he doesn't give you something to steal it back later to take it back once god gives you a gift he doesn't take it away from you if he gives it then he gives it to you for for all time and and for as long as you might need it amen but this this word faith here is is very special because we've been taught and brother branham teaches it very clearly that faith is a revelation of the will of god and it is and i'm not going to try and change that definition this evening by any means but but when you go to the root of that word it it kind of it expands on that a little bit and and the the root word is pistus and it it means if anyone this or anybody that's owned a car will recognize this it means it's a guarantee or a warranty so faith is a warranty is what the root word means it's a guarantee and if you have a guarantee it means you have a guarantor and if you have a warranty it means you have a warrantor it means that there's something behind it it's not just something that's written on a piece of paper it's not just an idea it's not just an empty promise but it means that there's some substance behind it and if you go and you buy a vehicle and there's a warranty behind it if something goes wrong then you get to go to the war and tour which is usually the manufacturing you say my car is wrong it's broken fix it and they fix it free of charge why because that's part of their guarantee it's part of their warranty and what this word means is that when god gives you faith he's giving you a guarantee that whatever he's given you faith for is going to come to pass in your life if you can find it in the word that's the key thing there is that if he's given it to you by the word and he gives you faith to step out and believe it he gives you faith to act on he gives you faith to confess it then that is the guarantee that it's going to happen in your life but it's got to be inspired by the holy spirit we have these word of faith movements we have the you know the prosperity doctrine and all these different things that's not what we're talking about what we're talking about is the one faith which is the original faith which god gives you and you can have human faith for the promises of god all day long but you won't get them right it's not your faith that does it it's the faith of god inside of you that brings those words to that word to to reality in your life amen so the faith is a proof of a guarantee from god that he would do what he said he would do right that's his warranty faith is his warranty that's something that you hold on to that you can go to him and say i've got faith to believe it that means that you're going to give it to me because i can only have faith as you give it to me amen the scripture confirms that this is all his work because it says by grace through faith we're saved and not that not of ourselves it is a gift of god so this is a gift to us and the thing about a guarantee or a warranty is that it is something that is given to you you don't res it's not something that you can generate it's not something that you can create it's not anything that has to do with you but it has to do with somebody else and so faith is something that only comes from one side it comes from him and we receive it and then as we receive it then we act on it and that's the way it works it is his guarantee and we are the receiver for that right it's something that he does and we are the benefactor for it it's not of ours to get it's ours to use once it's given to us it's ours to rely on once it's given into our lives amen now i want to draw a distinction a bit as we move into into kind of the main portion of the service tonight i talked about it a little bit before but i want to say that we have faith for two main purposes in life and the first thing is faith to receive and the second is faith to do you have faith to get something and we have faith that puts us into action to do something for the kingdom of god so you have promises that are given to you and you have faith to receive those promises but then you have commission and you have an unction to go do something and you do that thing by faith because it's often going to be supernatural it's going to be spiritual in nature and so you've got to have faith to do it otherwise you're going to fall flat on your face when you do it but i want to focus on faith to receive because that's what we generally are talking about for most of us is we're looking for faith to receive the promises and then we'll focus a little bit later lord willing not this service but maybe a couple down the road on that that faith of commission that faith to put us into action amen now if you'll remember we talked about faith and we said faith is not something where we go in and god gives us more faith and more faith and more faith but faith is more like a seed right and it's something that you get a portion of it at the beginning and then it grows right brother brandon would talk about raising the level of your faith he didn't say give you more faith he said raise the level of your faith he's trying to get what you have to grow to expand and you'll find your body's only got two things inside of it it's faith and doubt and so if he's getting you to increase your faith if he's getting you to expand your faith that means he's pushing more and more doubt out and so what's happening a lot of times we're getting faith in certain areas of our life because this is something that goes on over time it's not an immediate thing and it's one and done and you have faith for everything you have the potential for everything but god's slowly working in our lives because we're creatures of time to push out unbelief to push out doubt in our lives and as he does that then we get more and more of the supernatural in our lives in those areas because faith comes in it kicks out satan and his works and in comes the word and all of a sudden the room's cleaned out and god's got a place that he can work in our lives amen but what we see and certainly the older ones amongst us are the ones that have been serving the lord for a while can say that when you have moments of great faith it rarely just happened like this now the appearance of the faith may be sudden but what you realize is that so often there's been something that's going on underneath in your life for quite some time and then it builds to a moment and in that moment you step out in faith and that thing appears or that thing happens but usually god's working in your life and it's just like a seed you plant it and you plant that seed and it's under the ground and you don't see anything for quite some time but in one moment it breaks through and you say ah it's alive but that doesn't mean nothing was happening before that just means that your faith has been made sight all of a sudden and you think well that's the moment i got faith no that's the moment your faith became sight but the faith was working all along to bring it to fruition they meant to bring it up out of the ground and god's promises are very much the same way is that they act like a seed you take a word seed you take a word promise and you plant it in a in good ground which is a faithful willing heart and you put it in there a receiving heart and you plant it in there and then you say well what's going to happen now right should i see life right away and the thing is we want to think that life has to happen right away well something's coming but that doesn't mean that you can see it necessarily because it's in the ground right it's got to bring out in time brother braham says it this way he says now when you bury a seed you farmers you take and go out here and plant your corn you don't go out every morning and scratch it up and say let's see now is it growing anything happen to it no then you put it back down later the next day you say i want to see if it's getting along all right scratch it up again it'll never grow like that well the thing you do with the seed you commit it to the ground you cover it up that's all you can do about it it's up to god to do the rest of it amen he says well that's the way it is with the word of god that's the same way it is with the word of god if you'll take any divine promise god made in his bible put it in your heart and water it every day with the praises of god that's going to come to pass he says it'll grow if you don't quit fooling with it if you'll just leave it alone you say don't say let me see can i move my finger any better today do i feel any better is my headache a little better oh no it'll never be that just committed to god and walk away and leave it alone that's god's seed it'll grow so he's talking about he says if you take that seed and you plant it in good ground and you water it with praises and you confess it daily and you walk away and don't try digging it up you see how he says here let me see what's he saying is he's saying this is your way of digging it up as you say can i move my finger you broke your hand maybe you broke your finger or your whatever and he says you see can i move my finger a little bit maybe you're paralyzed well can i move my finger today no i can't oh i guess that means nothing's gone nothing's happening then you put that back in the next day can i move my finger again better he says that's not that's digging up the promise of god every single day and it'll never grow that way if you keep doing that sort of thing right but he says if we water it if we read our bibles we pray we go to church we have the right kind of fellowship we have the right kind of atmosphere in our home then it's going to bring forth the seed that you promised that's been promised to you right but if you want to have faith the prophet says don't keep testing it testing your faith is not the way to prove your faith he says leave it alone if you've got faith to believe it plant it water it and then walk away and don't keep digging up that promise that you keep claiming or that you say you claim what he's saying is if you've got a broken arm don't try and do a push-up every day guess what if you have a broken arm you say well well god has healed me and you go to try and do a push-up with a broken arm what's going to happen you're going to fall down on the side that that is trying to support itself with a broken arm and you're going to hurt your broken arm even more and you're going to say eventually god didn't heal me you don't have to go and do a push-up every day to prove that god healed your broken arm right he can do it in the moment but more often it's not that way it's a process of time so don't start doing trying to do a push-up every day since you claimed that he healed you that's not that's what he's saying he's saying you're tempting god you're tempting yourself you're digging up the promise by trying to prove him right he's saying don't pretend that's what he's saying don't pretend he says when it's there you'll know and we'll know so you don't have to pretend about it so don't do push-ups with a broken arm let it heal praise god for it how long say god has healed my arm my arm's gonna get fully better i'm gonna have full functionality and then when you can do a push-up then you say he's healed me but don't try doing a push-up when you know your arm's still broken it doesn't make any sense right we think that we think that that we have to walk around pretending we have what we believe but we're never told to pretend to have what we believe we're told to confess we're told to confess that's what we read in our first scripture our confession is what he's looking for amen and then it's up to him to do the work that doesn't mean nothing's changing it just means that your confession is that he's healed me your confession is that he's delivered me your confessions that he's providing for me that he's made the change in my life that i need and all these different things right we don't pretend to have something we profess that we have been given something amen and that in his time it's going to come to pass in our lives amen our obligations not to pretend what we have in our bodies when we clearly don't have it okay that's that's something we've got to be very careful of is that we look at it we look at the word and say well if i say that i've got it then that's what he's looking for and then you go and you you change that this is not the way he does it i'll read you a story we remember the story of john ryan the the blind man remember that well i'll read it to you rather than tell you i'll read it he says and this is john ryan he's come up he was prayed for and brother brahm says you're healed and he said well and he walked off on a little piece and he come back he said say you told me i was going to receive my sight i said that's right he said you said i was healed i said you are he said well you told me i was healed and i can't see i said that doesn't have anything to do with you seeing the man by the way was a catholic by faith and i said look sir you told me that you believe me he said well those other people are talking out there that they're healed them well so he's saying they went up and they got healed immediately and i went up and you said i was healed and i'm not healed immediately what gives what he's doing is he's painting the prop to the wall he's saying you said i was healed and i clearly am not the way they are i can i still can't see you said i was healed but i can't see so something's wrong here brother brown says well i thought you said you believed he says i did but but everybody else is different than me in my healing brother brown says you are too sir give the angel of the lord a chance to and he said what must i do. i said do you believe what i told you he said yes sir then i said well then why don't you act like it now you would say well how would he act like it would he go out and start a career as a photographer would he go out and drive a car would he go out and play in traffic is that the way he would act like it that's what we would say sometimes is that's how you act like it as you go in and you say well i've got it and you act like you've got it but watch what brother branham says here he says see i said go on off of here testifying saying praise the lord he healed me that's how you act it out he says he said all right and they let him off and he hollered praise the lord for healing me the next night the old fellow interrupted the meeting four or five times he was sitting up in the balcony and say everybody be quiet a minute he'd raise up and holler praise the lord for healing me and set down and i was speaking you know and he'd say just a minute brother branham he'd holler praise the lord for healing me the ushers went over there and i shook my head let him alone see he was having a good time with it he's a catholic he doesn't know anything better hopefully hopefully we have no catholics online here tonight he said just let him go he's doing what i told him to do maybe out of order but he's doing what he what i told him to do he says well afterwards he went out on the street he sold papers and he said praise the lord for healing me he'd holler extra praise the lord for healing me and the people laughed at him and made fun of him they thought that old man's gone crazy and went crazy over religion see so they had thought he was ready for the institution so we went on like that for several days guess up to two or three weeks and one day a little newsboy sold papers near him led him over to a barber shop to get a shave and the barber a little smart alec had more sense than he had gumption to know how to take care of it and he was wetting his razor and he had mr ryan shaved about halfway down on his face he said say dad i heard that you went to see that divine healer not long ago he said yep i went up to see him said i heard you got healed he said yup praise the lord he healed me and his eyes come open in the chair he looked around he said i am healed now so he was his confession was i am healed and then he said i am healed now the healing i've confessed is here now he says and he jumped out of that chair with the towel around his neck and out the door he went the barber behind him with the razor down the street now listen to this now he couldn't see perfect he could see objects and everything screaming to the top of his voice and that man john ryan's in dowagiac michigan as far as i know tonight preaching divine healing by faith that's right what was it he expected god to heal him now i want you to notice he jumps out of there saying i'm healed now and he comes out and he can't even see clearly but he can see and we'll get to this a little bit later in the next service lord willing about how this works but he could see a little bit remember the scripture talks and i think was brother ed talked about it where he said the the blind man jesus touched him and he says can you see and he says i see men walking around as trees this is what happened this is literally a recreation of what happened with christ in that blind man and then he touches him again and he can see clearly remember there was a double touch this is the same thing happened with john ryan he wasn't perfectly healed at that moment but his eyes came open he could finally see a little bit and then over the next little while he got to full sight because of that but what was it brother brown says what was it he expected god to heal him and all he had to do was confess he didn't have to pretend he didn't have to say the symptoms aren't aren't there he said all he had to do was confess his healing that's how you act on faith is confess what you believe you confess the promise and that is it we don't have to pretend amen amen now why did god wait why did god wait for john ryan why did so many others get immediate healing and he had to wait his two or three weeks and then only partially and then it was and then he had to wait even more after that i don't know i don't know the mind of god this is the sovereignty of god that we're seeing here okay so god sometimes does things sovereignly and that he does them immediately and sometimes god does things sovereignly and that he waits a while and it's god that god that chooses that it's not us to do it listen he made abraham wait 24 years before he saw a sign of his baby and that was his wife's belly starting to get round and her body changed back to a 20 year old amen okay joseph gets the gets the vision and the prophecy that he's going to be a ruler and his brothers are going to bow out to him and he goes through 22 years of misery before he ever sees that happen david waits 15 years to become a king and 22 years beca before he's the full king of israel and judah together and listen all of these promises were brought to them god came and he called them he told them something he showed them something they didn't come to god abraham didn't come to god and say oh god i want a son i want a son god called him out of earth abraham was not a child of god in the sense that he was running around like a christian back then he called him out of idolatry and he separated him and he gave him a promise and abraham didn't ask for it god came and sovereignly did it god called joseph and was going to use him as a savior god called david to align the kingdoms and bring them back under godly rule they didn't ask for any of this god came and told him that it was going to happen god gave them the promise and then god waited between 22 and 24 years for every single one of them why well in some cases he had to develop the character so what do we think we're going to get away with no character that's usually what it is he's developing character but i like what brother joe said and i talked to him about it later he said that came to me just then and and he said god will start a fire and put you in it to have a conversation with you and get you closer to him i thought that was absolutely phenomenal god will put you into a trial to get you talking to him right guess what when we're in trials when we're in needs that's when we tend to talk about the most because we're human right times are good we tend to pull away and when times are bad we tend to pull close so guess what there's a lot of trials and tribulations for christians because we're still in these these two-thirds cursed bodies that are unredeemable right so god's working in our lives amen we're talking about promises and prophecies that god gave we didn't go to god and say god i need a promise for healing god i need a promise for deliverance he came and said i'm giving you healing i'm giving you deliverance i'm giving you provision i'm giving you all of these things and then we sit there and say well then how come i don't get it right away and like we said before there's a much bigger picture here than just giving us everything that we want and then there's a process that we go through now listen to this this is a bit of a lengthy quote and he's talking about noah but he says then after that he's talking about the stature of a perfect man after that fourthly he says you want to add patience to your faith if you've got faith and work with patience the bible said see so this is patience now that's the next thing is going to build the stature you know god has got real material in his building guess what the bride that he's building is not some soft you know uh hot hot house plant that just falls down the minute a bit of frost comes or the weather gets bad or something like that he says he's building a bride out of real material and this is the real material that he's talking about and this is not human faith and virtue and knowledge in this this is godly this is this is the the holy spirit working in a believer's life he says god's got real material in his building see how short we are brother and sister we have glory we have shouts and things because we got faith but when we come down to these things here god can't build us up to the statue he says we got all of this down here but he says it doesn't build into this which shows there's something wrong in the beginning he says he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we've got all these other things we fall and slide off with it see he can't build his church patience with what what kind of patience the first thing is have patience with god he says if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because faith worketh patience when god says anything you believe it that's all you've got patience say well i asked him last night to heal me and i'm just as sick this morning oh my what patience god told abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with god he said put him always before you let him be the next crossing thing you can't cross them you'll just keep them before you he said so and it's going to happen see keep him before you that's right noah have real godly patience god said i'm going to destroy this world with rain and noah preached 120 years yet plenty of patience not even dew fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever was for 120 years he was still just as uh sorry for 120 years but he was patient he says then god tries your patience that's right after he told noah now he said noah i want you to go ahead and get in the ark i'm going to run the animals in there and i want you to get in climb way upstairs now so you can look out at the top window now i want you to get in there i want you to tell these people tomorrow what i've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down there and tell them what was the first sign noah got in the air there wasn't no rain noah got ready got the raincoat on and everything so he could look out once in a while he got ready but the next day instead of a black cloud here come the sun coming up just like it always did it's going to rain god what's this sunny this sunny sky we're dealing with california suns right not newfoundland rains lord you said it was going to rain no looked out and said hey there ain't no cloud this guy come up said i known you was one of them you see you're hanging around up here well part of me sir ha ha maybe you know i was just you know enthused you know kind of see do we back down sometimes maybe i just got enthusiastic he said but noah's he had patience said if it don't come to date it'll be here tomorrow why god said so when he did when do you tell you that noah 120 years ago i've come this far so i'm just waiting here now he said see that now after a while noah waited the fourth day passed no rain it's all right it's gonna happen i can hear mrs noah come around say dad are you sure don't talk like that he had patience because he had faith yes sir he had virtue he had knowledge that god was right he had temperance he didn't fly loose didn't get impatient we see that with job you know believe i tend to think if i was job i'd have reacted way differently than job job didn't even have the holy ghost and i feel like sometimes i react differently job lost everything and he didn't fly loose his life told him fly loose let go tell god off and die this ain't worth it but he says no i didn't let loose he said what well i don't know what it's all about i've lost all my popularity out there no no people don't care for me no more i'll go out there and start all over again new again no no he had patience god promised god will do it god will do it because god said so noah had to be convinced that god came down and started this whole thing didn't he he says his daughter-in-law said father you know it will rain but we've been all these years waiting we've been preparing and you told us it's going to rain a week ago and we're in here the doors are all shut and here we are walking around in here and the sun just scorching right down like it was but it will rain how do you know god said so he says now when you get that way at it he says add that kind of patience he says you ain't got it that way don't try and add it it won't work it won't work on healing it won't work on nothing else see it's got to blend in with the same material it's vulcanized too that's right got to add it patience with god's promise yes sir noah believed it and he had patience with god 120 years listen if you've got godly faith then it's going to be godly virtue that goes in there it's going to be strength to take you through and it'll convert itself to that knowledge where faith becomes sight and then it'll be temperance where you what you don't let loose you don't get mad at god you don't get upset at god you don't get petulant with god because he didn't do it the way you thought he did and that brings you into patience that'll take you into all these other things he says don't add something that's not godly to something that is it won't blend it won't work when you vulcanize rubber it's got to be rubber on rubber you can't put anything else together with rubber it doesn't work that way but a vulcanizing process will join rubber together right what's he saying he's saying your confession is what matters and stay there and confess god said it i believe it and i'll stay here we won't ever have to wait 120 years i don't believe but guess what he can make us wait a year he can make us wait two years he can make his way five years or he can do it today or he can do it tomorrow it's up to him we've got to have patience to hold on to these things amen remember noah didn't make it rain noah's message was it's gonna rain but noah didn't make it rain we got a message that says you're gonna go on a rapture guess what it's not you that's going to go in the rapture it's god that's going to take you in a rapture you've got a holy ghost inside of you that's going to take you out of this pest ridden body and it's going to put you into a new one amen it's going to be a working of god that does it it's not us to do we read even those scriptures that said they'll cast out devils they'll take up serpents and and we think we're going to do that well we are going to do it but it's not us that does it it's going to be christ in us that's going to be doing it how are you going to cast out a demon you can't even see what are you going to do reach in and grab them by the throat and shake them and say get out everything we do is in the name of jesus by the word of god everything we do so it's not us that's doing it it's us that's speaking it it's us that's confessing it it's us that's speaking with authority but it's him that's making it go it's him that's making it happen amen it's not us making it happen we're just speaking according to the word and according to the unction of the holy spirit in our life amen we don't try and be anything you can't be it you just got to have it and god will work through you that's all he's doing he's just asking you to get out of the way i've been listening to that sermon perfect strength and perfect weakness all week and not all week it's only halfway through i guess but and the the the thing there's brother brown says listen anything you've got anything you've got whether you think it's godly good whatever throw it away completely and let god come in and then he can do something with you he had to take saul out on the back side of the desert for three years or three and a half years in saudi arabia he had to take moses out for 40. but yet he could take john the baptist out of out of there at an early age running around in the desert and bring him out and he was more than a prophet right and what did he do he looked horrible he was hairy he had on a camel skin he ate locusts and honey not exactly high society not exactly you know from a great theological seminar seminary or anything like that but that's the kind of men that god's looking for was he could take out he had to take out everything that they tried to put in there to the point where moses was a stammering man couldn't even speak properly but yet he'd go out and he would finally take up a stick and he'd go down and deliver israel with it because god had finally got everything out of him and brought him to a place where god could use him amen it's god that makes us what we are it's not us it's not us it's a work of grace we talked about that last time remember it's a work of grace and so it's all him and all we're doing is trying to set ourselves aside so that he can do something in us amen now listen some confessions require us to do actions then you can't say that i believe that god is going to financially support me and then go out and take a second job that keeps you out of church that's not a confession that god's looking for that's not an action to a confession that god's looking for because if you go out and you get a job that takes you out of the word then that's not going to be that that's not the the moving of god that's not the provision of god god didn't open that door for you did he if all of a sudden brother john starts to miss church because he took on a second job because he needs to build a garage next to his house that's not the that's not the provision of god that's not my faith in god doing that amen my fa my actions have to line up with the word amen amen amen so if you're looking for financial improvements then you need to be faithfully in church don't you right you don't go and take a second job you don't take on extra hours in these things you you stick true to the kingdom of god first and everything else will be added to you brett brown says as a minister i've seen just as many quack ministers as i have doctors too anything that don't believe in god's word to me is a quack that's right you're willing to stand out and take the word the way it is and and say it's right or wrong true now believe god have faith in god and when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember god will make your body come into your confession watch this now if you say you're a drunkard and want to drink don't worry you'll soon be one listen your faith can go both ways you can speak yourself into an unsafe condition in your head or you can speak yourself into a safe condition he says if you say you're a sinner and want a sin you'll be right into it if that's your confession if that's your thought process if that's where your attitude and mind are that's where you're going to end up amen that's the way you'll act doesn't mean you're going to lose your salvation if you're truly a son or daughter of god but he says that's your your thoughts and your attitudes and your confessions gonna take you right where you're confessing but he says if you say you're a christian and believe it all along your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing and believe that god has healed you confess it and god will make your body obey your confession for he's the high priest of your confession amen sitting at the right hand of the father now with his own blood to make intercessions for any confession upon anything that he died for faith has the right confession that's what he's looking for the right confession amen your confession points to what the warranty and the guarantor doesn't point to me it points to there and says that's what tells me that i've got a a a place i've got a a means of restoration of restitution for whatever it is that i need him and we're resting on the great warranty amen we're resting on the great warranty which is the word of god and we're going back to that and saying you gave me the warranty and i'm just asking you to obey i'm asking you to honor the warranty that you've given me and brother bram says god loves to have his word repeated back to him he loves it when you read from the warranty booklet right but you ever notice with warranties if you don't maintain your vehicle you can null and void the warranty do you know you can do that with the promises of god too guess what children don't children of god sons of god they don't just walk around claiming warranty work all the time they've been abusing it guess what they get a spanking don't they right you don't get a free fix you're going to pay for this repair aren't you because you didn't water it you didn't do anything you abused your walk and now you're asking for him to repair and he says okay there's grace there's a lot of grace more grace than we deserve but guess what we're going to pay a price when we abuse it that's for sure amen but yet it's backed by what his own blood right you're not looking to yourself you're claiming the blood every time every time you make a mistake maybe you put a ding in your christian reputation you're saying i claim the blood he says we'll do a warranty repair on that then do you know some dealerships will do a grace warranty well let's say you've been a good customer you've maintained it you've done all your maintenance here and we see you every couple of months and we know you take care of your vehicles we'll take care of this one free of charge even though it's outside of the warranty god's gracious to us he's gracious to us amen above and beyond what we could ever ask or think now listen paul speaking here of the law being a shadow of good things to come could never make the worshiper perfect then he goes on to show what the perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of with people they say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian he says that's just what the devil wants you to say you're talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i'm saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart they says do you believe in divine healing with all of my heart then let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it remember remember he talked about he'd say you can you can't stop birds from flying over your head but you can stop them from building the nest right he says when it starts like that don't entertain it well you say i can't oh it's right here i can't help the thoughts from coming sometimes i get ahead of myself see he says will that be like the farmer said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting so that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir jesus christ is my savior all things are mine by god and i'm going to keep them and i'm going to testify of them he says and god can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right hebrews 3 he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it believe it and confess it so i read that to say this don't fret about time don't fret about how long things are taking if you expected it to be short and it's taking a long time don't worry about it if you're not seeing any movement if you're not seeing any changes don't worry about it right he's saying you just confess except believe and confess that's all the believers required to do amen like we read before don't dig up your experience with god don't dig up the promises of god don't dig up your healing and compare it with your old condition and your new condition and these different things don't dig up your deliverance don't go to where you used to be tempted and say well i'm gonna see if i'm still tempted don't do that that's tempting god and it's tempting yourself and it'll destroy your faith don't do it second timothy one says for god had not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind be thou thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor me of his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who has saved us and called us with a holy calling where are you there on the receiving end not according to our works where are you no part in it he says but according to his own purpose and grace which was given in us in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who had abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel in you in you that's where it's made it's made light in you it's not just christ christ has gone on in the sense that he was here but now it's made light in you he says where am where unto i'm appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and have persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day that's the believer's confession so what have you committed to him you've committed your finances you've committed your relationships you've committed your career you've committed your education you've committed your ministry you've committed your weight whatever it might be when you commit it to him then you have to believe like paul says and says i've committed that to him against the day that he brings it to pass and i leave it in his hands and i don't have to worry about it anymore because why i've committed it when you commit something to someone else you don't have it in your hands anymore that's right right when a father comes and he gives his daughter away in marriage he doesn't put his hands on her anymore does he he's committed her to another man's caretaking and so when we do what when we cast our cares upon him make sure they're cast on him make sure you let go of it make sure you give it to him don't say help me with it give it to him cast your care on him that means pick it up and heave it over let it go don't try and do it yourself just say lord i'm committing it to you and believing that you'll take care of the need because your word says that you would do it amen what is it perfect strength and perfect weakness when you give it over to him the results are completely up to him amen and i want to talk a bit about this faith to receive that we were speaking of earlier in matthew 17 20 says verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence the yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible to you now remember we we spoke last time and then brother joe had some of the exact same quotes i did on that mustard seed and it's brother brown says it's the smallest seed there is that's right for for you know the type of a plant that is right it's not a big c it's not like an acorn or a walnut you know these big things real hefty chunky things but we we read the quote and it was amazing that you can't hybrid you can't crossbreed a mustard seed with anything else you can't blend it and that's what makes it perfect for faith is that it only has one component right you don't add to it you don't take away from it it's only going to be mustard seed no matter what and that's why brothers that's why why jesus uses it that way it's small but it can't pure it can't compromise its purity even if it wants to it can't a mustard seed can't say well i'd like to crossbreed with something so i'll do it no no it cannot do it it is forbidden to do it it is incapable of being crossbred and brother and jesus said that's what your faith is supposed to be like you have to have faith that isn't hybrid with something else amen you don't take it and blend it with your humanity and god's sovereignty you can't do it with your human elements and and gifts and power and these different strengths in these different things and then try and blend god in with it it's going to be god or it's going to be you and that's it amen if it's you then god's not in there and if it's god then you can't be in there either he says now i haven't got much faith brother branham did you hear him say if you got faith the size of a mustard seed a mustard seed faith won't perform a miracle but if you hold to it it'll bring you out just anchor to it that's it see it's not about how big you start out that's kind of what we're thinking so many times and and i i don't think i'll ever get to the quotes but brother brown says we we think we've got to have supernatural faith and we go looking for supernatural faith and he says faith is common faith is like he says the hyssop remember it was like the hyssop and that's just a weed he says it's a common weed and faith is the same for big things and small things it's common you just take it and go do it right and that's what we're looking for here is it's not about the size it's whether or not you can believe and you'll move forward with it he says the mustard seed faith the tiny little start he says it'll take you through if you don't blend it with anything else if you've got something that won't blend it'll take you all the way to where you need to go amen what is it but it takes faith to say lord i'm not going to try and stick my oar in the water i'm not going to try and steer the ship i'm not going to try and drive the car lord i'm going to trust you to do this the way that you said the way that you want to do it and i'm just holding to the promise that i'll get to where you said we were going to go if i'm going to go to clarenville and god's driving then guess what my trust is we're getting to clarenville doesn't matter which route we take it's up to him to determine the route but i'll get to clarenville eventually if i let him drive me right it's like we said before you put that word promise and that word promised seed in the right environment you just wait guess what there's some seeds that take months to sprout and there's some that come up almost overnight and that's the way it is in our in our lives and guess what that's the sovereignty of god that sometimes it's immediate and then sometimes it's it's not immediate that's the easiest way to put it isn't it but in the right environment in the right atmosphere a sea will come up if it's a good seed every single time but the brown puts it this way he says and so the so is the word of god if a person can take that word and place it in their heart give it the right sunshine the right temperature not s-u-n but capital s-o-n and right temperature of faith in there that seed and promise will live to you just like it did at the beginning to the one it was given to because it's god's word and he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail now the thing is with the people is the way god appears many times listen to this many times we want to make an idol out of god we ask god to do something and then he must do it just the way we ask it or we'll say he never answered because that's the way they used to go with idols was they go to the island they say this is what i want this is the way i want it but he says that's not that's not the god's not an idol like that we don't go and tell him how to do it he says when we do that we weaken our faith in god because we're telling them how to do it he says you tell him what your need is and let him sort it out he says we weaken our testimony when we do not take him at his word because we're looking for it to happen a certain way and it doesn't happen that way or it isn't going that way and all of a sudden our face starts to weaken because we had a an expectation in our lives and an expectation in our hearts of how this was going to go and then it didn't go that way and then our face starts to drop and we say well i guess i was wrong or i guess i don't believe or i guess i don't have faith or you start to doubt your walk with god and he's never thinks he says no no you've turned god into an idol when you do that he says tell him the need confess your faith that he will deliver the need and then you go on and let him do it however he wants to i like how he says here that seed and promise because many times we we say well i believe and that means it's over with but that's not the way it looks amen here and matthew 13 verse 18 says hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catches the way that which was sown in his heart this is he which receives seed by the wayside so he's saying listen this is the word this is the the word promises whatever it might be anything in the word in this kind of a life it didn't even germinate it just laid on the ground and nothing happened and then the the birds came and took it away right there was no revelation there was no understanding it didn't even start and so it died right there he says in verse 20 but he that received the seed he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and a numb with joy receive it now watch this yet because he had no root in himself but matter can't get that next one yet when he had not rooted himself but endureth for a while then for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended so he went from ground where nothing happened to background where it goes in and it starts something but because it's so stony it can't take a root and so what happens is eventually this is a heart that's unsoftened by the presence of god is what it is it's unsoftened it's hard ground there's nothing prepared amen it's resistant to change it's unwelcome to life he says he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful he's casual and unsanctified but he that receives seed into the ground good ground is he that hears the word and understands it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some a hundredfold some 60 and some 30. now i want you to catch something here the only thing that mattered was the ground the seed was the same in every situation the seed was good seed the seed could bring forth life it could bring forth fruit but the only difference was the kind of ground it was planted in and you're the one that determines that as in it's your life that determines what kind of life is going to come out it's your heart that's going to determine it's the ground that you've got prepared inside of you that's going to determine how this goes in your life amen amen because there's a word there's a place prepared for the word right there's a place prepared a body has to prepare for me that's what he's got here is he's got a place prepared for the word but guess what you do have an influence on this you do have an effect because guess what the same seed brought forth a hundredfold and some 60 and others and 30 and others they all brought forth fruit but some brought forth more why well look at what the effects look at what it is that that that that has an effect on this because it's speaking about the word and it's affecting our lives and that first one says that what it can't just be surface what is surface word it's a covering it's religion right it has to be in you it can't just be on you it can't just be something that you put on when you go to church or when you're around believers it's got to be something in you coming out amen the sir the word seed has to be planted inside of your life because otherwise one little temptation one little issue and satan will come and pluck that word right out of your life why because it's on you it's not in you you've got to get it buried deep where that a bird can't get to it but he says what then you have the one that what is is is surrounded by the the cares of this world and and sorry surrounded by the thorns and that's what that's the people you hang around with right it's the friends you have it's the acquaintances you have it's it's where you spend your time and how you spend your time that matters that matters it matters who your friends are it matters how you spend your time amen and guess what it's always a one-way street of influence and guess what if you're not influencing them they're influencing you whether you recognize it or not if you're around worldly people if you're around denominational believers if you're around people that don't believe the truth of this hour there's only one way that influence goes and it's one way you are then and if they're not changing and if they're not seeing anything then guess what you're the one that's being changed even if you don't realize it that's why the scripture says how can two walk together unless they agree somebody's got to be agreeing for you to be walking together make sure they're agreeing with you because if they're not then you better get out of that quick quick quick amen and then the third thing is that your life needs to be christ-centered because it talks about the cares of this world the deceitfulness of riches what is it you've gotten caught up in this lao to see in age haven't you and you've gotten caught up in in in the cares of life and you're getting caught up in your houses and your vehicles and your jobs and your careers and your education and all these different things and what does it do chokes out the word takes out you know what it does it takes away the joy of your salvation and it takes away the same mind that christ has given you forget your place in christ that's what happens when you do this amen listen what he's saying is let your let your work be for the kingdom of god because guess what riches have nothing to do with the kingdom of god if we're seeking riches then we're lost right the love of money is the root of all evil and if you're living your life for money that means your love you're loving the money that's that's the thing that you're focused on amen but what's he saying is he's saying get focused on the kingdom of god amen when when i'm tired out i ought to be tired out because i did something for the king of god when i stay up late it ought to be because i'm doing something for the king of god when i'm spent and can't give any more it ought to be because i've done something for the kingdom of god amen not because i'm doing something for myself or or or for for you know riches in this world or for for prestige or these different things it should be something for the kingdom of god amen your experience will get choked out you may not lose your salvation though because this can happen in a believer's life no matter what that's why you only bring forth 30-fold it's because you haven't been rooting the weeds out as they've been coming up it was to do it takes away some of the richness of the soil it takes the nutrients out it takes that away and so all of a sudden you can only produce 30-fold because something else is getting some of the life that was supposed to be going into you prophet of god puts it this way now remember we're talking about faith to receive he says see it just goes to show give the best you have give your life give your time give everything to christ and that same spirit that lived in christ lives in you and your influence in your neighborhood and upon the people you deal with will be so much like christ till it'll work the same things that christ did he says finally it'll come to pass that the people laid in the shadows and was healed he said that's right just so much power of love around them and they said that when saint martin was preaching after he come out of this lesser robe that entire congregation noticed a glow of light all around him uh-huh see because he had done the right thing now listen to this always do right that's your duty to god what is right obey the word amen that's very simple obey the word that's your duty to god then he says think right that's your duty to yourself and you've got to come out right he says that's right you just have to he says if you'd do right and think right he says you've got to come out right amen no sir he says do right that's your duty to god live by the word speak the word confess the word don't be a talker only but be a doer also amen we don't want to be talkers only that's religion we want to be doers because that's the life of a believer right but then he says think right that's your duty to yourself in other words choose how you spend your thinking time and we talked about that earlier right choose what you dwell on choose what sticks around in your head you know i found that if i'm thinking the wrong kind of things i'm getting caught up in a situation i'm getting caught up in drama i'm getting caught up in people's actions and reactions you know what i do i sing a song in my head or if i'm in the car i sing it out loud that's the best way i know how to do it because guess what you can't dwell on thoughts while you're singing a song so if you want a tip from brother john sing a song you're not where you're supposed to be in your head sing a song praise and worship you can sit there and read your bible and get distracted you sing a song it's very hard to think the wrong thoughts and guess what you'll start to praise and it'll start to turn into another song and another song and all of a sudden that thought's gone away because what you put yourself back into the praise and presence of god amen amen very simple very simple that's not high and spiritual but it works for me maybe it'll work for you and i sing in the shower every morning in my head often why because it gets me in the right attitude gets me in the right atmosphere what is singing half the time it's a confession half the time we're singing praises to god we're thanking him for things we're we're talking about the word we're talking about the good things of god amen and it gets you into a place where your attitude's set right for the day and what all of a sudden you're expecting things to be a little better than maybe you went into that shower with before you start walked out that door to eat your breakfast your mind has changed because you're in a different mood now you've got a different atmosphere because you're not letting those thoughts get in there and and roost as brother braham says or build a nest amen and then you want to get to the place where you're expecting the result that god promised rather than thinking about the situations and the failures and the people that are going to cause you problems in it because what there's always going to be an internal work that nobody sees before there's an external work that everyone sees that's the principle here is that god doesn't work on the inside before he ever does a work on the outside listen you don't have people that go get delivered you know they they they don't they don't get delivered from drugs and then come to the lord do they they come to the lord and then he delivers them from drugs and it'll often be like that but it's because there was an internal work before there was an external work and god always deals with the heart of men before he deals with the exterior because otherwise what we've got a facade we've got a false front we've got a religion if all we're concerned about is what's on the outside and there's nothing changing on the inside and nobody knows more about the inside of jonathan than jonathan i know my thoughts i know my attitudes i know my cynicism i know my failures and guess what each one of us does and so we ought to be looking for that inward change that inward life that can now come out and we talked about that overflow last time amen listen people that make it through extreme circumstances very difficult trials that show great moments of faith they aren't hopping and skipping through life and all of a sudden they just do these things or go through these things this is built by day in and day out being in the presence of god setting the right atmosphere feeding on the right things having the right fellowships having the right relationships feeding on the word of god going to god with their problems rather than going to people right it's something that's built up over time and then god puts them through a test i talk about the gym a lot i go to the gym guess what if i got to lift 300 pounds you know how i get to 300 pounds i lift 100 pounds then 120 then the next week 140 and then the next week 150 and i build there by 10 pounds a week until i get to 300. i don't go 100 to 300 and i don't just walk into the gym and lift 300 pounds that's how you hurt your back and not make it to church right you go too far too fast and you don't do it and you hurt yourself while you're doing it god builds us up to these things don't expect great faith if you're not having him build you up day by day if you're not putting your time into your relationship with him don't expect great faith to receive great results because why it's building up it's raising the level of your faith and it's based on your relationship and your revelation of him and your life not just the word on a piece of paper it's got to be personal to you amen now it might start all of a sudden but i remember i mean i've said it many times over the pulpit i was under conviction from the age of 10 but i didn't give my life to christ until 17. and for all external you know viewings of my life and brother gerald's testified to this i sat there and i watched but i didn't blink and i didn't show any response to the word for seven years but yet inside there was a roiling going on there was a building up there was a conviction that was there and then in one moment boom jonathan collette gave his life to the lord but it was seven years of agony and what god working under the surface to bring out that life at the age of 17 right there's something that's going on in these situations right something built slowly is something that's common irregular in your life that's why it builds up is because every single day you're adding a brick listen it's way better to add a brick every day than to try and put 30 every couple months you know you try and do a bunch and guess what you don't do a very good job of it because you're not used to laying bricks but you do it every day just do one or two a day pretty soon you got a house built and it's built perfectly it doesn't just go up in a rush right you can't go from a foundation to a fully built house in three days you build it up over time and god's the same way with us now i want to talk a bit just as we start to go towards closing about being in that right channel and attitude for this for holding on and building this faith to receive brother brahm's speaking of abraham and he says you know sons of god are led by the spirit of god you believe that do you believe that do you believe you're led by this by the spirit of god if you don't you're going to have some real struggles amen lead you into things and you got to know he led you in there you didn't walk into it of your own will you didn't walk into it of your own desires but he brought you into these things he says then while he was sitting there thinking of the time that god appeared to him in the name of the almighty the el shaddai the bosom the breasts of the woman the strength giver he says now you notice the word is a compound word which means shadai not a breast but breasted too he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed he says oh i'm so glad of that either promise of god's breast he's the strong one the strength giver if you're abraham an old man 99 years old he said abraham i'm the breasted god just lay a hold of my promise and nurse your strength from me he says that's what it is to every believer that'll take god's word and don't doubt it but just hold on to it and nurse your strength it's like the baby laying on the mother's bosom and the time it's nursing it's satisfied anybody that's had a baby knows that you can get a baby to nurse it doesn't matter how much pain it's been how how difficult life has been how cranky it's been if you can get it to nurse and it realizes that it's starting to feed it'll settle right down and as soon as it gets off it'll go right back to being cranky and horrible and you want to put it up for adoption but as long as it's latched to that mother it's satisfied it says be the same way be satisfied with god i'm seeing some of the sisters smile be satisfied stay latched to god amen he says nurse your strength he says what that's what it is to every believer that'll take god's word and don't doubt it but just hold on to it and nurse your strength it's like the baby laying on the mother's bosom all the time it's nursing it's satisfied and when a real christian can get a hold of a promise of god and believe it's for them you've got to believe it's for you not for your brother not for your sister you got to believe it's for you amen he says then he's satisfied while he's nursing the strength and coming he won't complain a bit he's just satisfied he says oh i love that satisfaction of knowing that god said so said so to what to me not just to brother mark not just a sister rebecca not just his sister lydia not just his sister brenda he said it to brother john as well right that's the satisfaction is it wasn't just for them but it's for me as well so what's he saying he's saying what you're feeding on is going to determine your attitude what you're latched on to is going to determine the result the the breast milk from a mother is that the best thing that you can give a baby they don't have a formula today can touch it they don't have a formula today can touch it it's the best thing you can give for at least the first six months of a baby's life it's the only thing they need it's the only thing they need you don't have to give them a single thing if they can just latch a nurse it's the same thing for us we can say latch to god you don't need anything else you don't need psychology you don't need to go out and do this and do that and everything you'll be satisfied with what he's offering amen but i want you to look cause we're gonna talk about attitude for a moment because attitude matters brother braham said the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass in your life he says well i see he's still talking about abraham this is in the message i believe is anything too hard for the lord he says well i see the angel takes his chair maybe remember so abraham's sitting and the three men came and they're sitting down and he leans his back towards the tent and sarah's listening through the tent you know kind of ear dropping you know listening through the tent and she was kind of in an awful mood that morning you don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood you just no need of trying it you just might as well have stayed home you won't get nothing out of it what's he saying attitude matters when you come to church come prayed up come in the atmosphere come expecting abraham knew that the time of the promise was coming close he was expecting it or he was a hundred years old he was expecting at any time he watched every minute every minute when he ran in he told sarah this i believe is our day of visitation she kind of looked at him with him big eyes and thought well abraham you've said that a long time but you know there will come a time when it'll be so if god said so amen let the day be the day and if it's not today let tomorrow be the day and if tomorrow's not the day then let the next be be the day that's what you say every day say lord i'm expecting it today she had herself all out of condition to receive it when god brought it amen he says oh my don't ever get that in your heart be open be ready she missed it she failed to see it and if we don't watch friends the church is going to fail to see it let's not look for church hairdos and new dresses let's look for the holy spirit to come in the supernatural and raise some things he says the church doesn't need a facelift it needs a birth the holy ghost to come into the church and bring back people that believes the supernatural and holds on and waiting for the coming of the lord as if it might be any hour and living in them conditions living in them conditions of what expectancy that it's going to happen he says here she was in that shape say now how could that happen in our modern time how could it happen to me in my condition but it happened just the same abraham out there was waiting with anticipation you see it wasn't made known to her it was made no to them who was looking for it that's the way it comes yet to those who are looking so he was watching abraham was he said yes my lord yes that's right the promise was and i believed it all along he said now abraham just about the time of life it will be each month well i'm going to visit you and you're going to have that baby and sarah you know herself when ha kind of laughed kind of to herself he says now watch abraham gets a sign now sarah was too frustrated too concerned about the new hairdo she'd seen or something else sometimes they're too much frustrated about the other fellow that's got the biggest denomination or his congregation dresses better than mine or they've got a bigger church down on the corner than we got he says what difference does that make that's probably not our issue here we got a small church but we're not looking at other churches probably but pick your poison what is it that gets you frustrated that gets your eyes off the promise he says what difference does that make i want god i don't care if i have to worship him on the street corner in a coal shed wherever it might be i want god let me have my heart and condition that if i wear overalls so i can watch god and see his move and recognize him not pass it by he recognized him he said my lord sarah never recognized him as my lord and i i i'll read this next one but i want to put a preface in here because for the sake of time i pulled out a section he says when sarah expressed her unbelief he said he should have killed her right then but he said he couldn't because she was a part of abraham that's why he didn't do it that's why he didn't because she was a part of abraham he says and lots of times our belief would destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of jesus christ god can't destroy us now because the blood of jesus christ keeps god off of us we're part of christ just as sarah was part of abraham for we are the bride of christ and we people who's born to the spirit of god ought to wake up get out of our stools and watch for the supernatural sign of the coming of the lord jesus his signs that he promised we're talking about an attitude and brother brahm says who's the one that has faith the one that's watching the one that has faith is the one that's watching the one that has faith is the one that's what in an attitude of expectation amen those that have a receiving attitude when it comes they're ready for it they're looking for it they're expecting it and so when it comes then they're right in the channel to accept it and move right on right if you're really expecting something you're going to be ready for it we had a if we had a football here this this evening and i knew that at some point in the service somebody was going to throw it at me you can guarantee that my hands are probably up here most of the service because what i'm in expectation that somebody's going to throw the football at me and i'm going to want to catch it i don't want to get hit upside the head on a live stream do i i'm going to be ready for it amen you ever been to a sporting event where somebody wanted something why do people go to a sporting event because they want to watch their team win and guess what they let it be known what they expect don't they when you go to a sporting event what are they doing they're yelling they're shouting when their team does something good when it's something they get close to scoring or whatever what do they do they jump up and they shout and they yell the other team comes close what do they do they boo right the other team scores they boo they let it be known what side they're on don't they and they're giving an expectation of what they want to happen in that cert in that in that event you ever see and if you ever go to a hockey game a professional hockey game i've been to a couple and you'll see people hold up signs and a lot of times it's kids and what are they the goo they go there and they want their favorite player to give them a stick or they want to puck so what do they do they hold up a sign and what do they say it's my birthday can i get a puck and a lot of times a player will read that and they'll go and they'll toss a puck over over the the boards to them over the glass to them or they'll say sydney crosby best player ever can i have a stick because why they want to catch his attention and let him know what their expectation is they're not afraid to make their expectation known and guess what if sydney crosby doesn't give him a stick does that mean they won't go the next time and hold the same sign up no because they expect a stick they want a stick so they go there with their sign up and they're letting it be known i want a stick from sidney crosby what do we do what do we do when we come to church what do we come to do when we go into our prayer closet are we holding up a sign that says this is my expectation are we kind of going in with a downturn mouth and you know what's going to be is going to be what is it you if you say you're expecting then act like it if you say you believe then start acting like it amen you're going to come to church come to church to hear what's for you and here's the thing where we fail is we say this is what god's going to say to me no no no you come to church ready to hear what's supposed to be for you and you let god say it the way he wants to say it so many times we want an affirmation we want an approval we want a check mark and you say well it's going to come like this and sometimes it does if you're in the right but guess what this is a house of correction as well so you got to be able to say when that word comes forth and it's different than what i expected i'm going to take the word instead of my way of thinking because guess what his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts we get into that idol thing where we're telling him what to do tell him the need tell him the question tell them the situation and then say god i'm expecting you to answer that's why we worship that's why we praise amen it's because what we're in expectation we have an experience that he's god but we're worshiping and praising him not just for what he's done but for what he's going to do right we're not worshiping a dead god he didn't just live yesterday and he's dead today and he's not going to do anything tomorrow but our worship and our praise is what it's expectation it's showing that we're in a receiving attitude we're in a receiving channel and we're telling him how much we love and appreciate him for what he's done and what he's doing and what he's going to do even if we can't see it right that's why we worship him is because he's god not because of what i see but because he's god and then we'll see later our faith is going to come side amen we praise him because he's let us read the back of the book and we see our name in there and we see that we make it and we see that we overcome and we sit in his throne with him and we come back with ten thousand times thousands of his saints on white horses and we rule and reign with him that's why we praise him if we believe it that's our praise we've got a reason for it it's not blind praise this is not to the unknown god that does the unknown things this is a god that we know that's personal to us and we're praising him for what he's done and what he's doing amen we praise him because he said you're mine and you're going to make it brother man puts it this way he says expectations if you're expecting it you will receive it you usually get what you expect to get if you come to the meeting tonight expecting to find something to criticize the meeting the devil will show you he says you'll see you he will see that you get satisfied you get what you expect and if you come to get a blessing god will see that you get it if you come to get saved god will see you get it if you come to get healed be expecting to get healed god will see that you do it it's whatever you're expecting amen listen you go to a sports game and they're nuts they are crazy you see fans for a team and they're nuts the things they do the way they they paint up their faces and they put on uh you know they dress themselves up and do crazy hairstyles and wigs and it's insane what they'll do at a hockey game or a football game football game you go out on stage with a college football game 120 000 screaming fans in a building drinking alcohol and yelling for their team right the things that they're doing are crazy brother brahms says you're going to be crazy you're going to be considered crazy for the things you say and do if you're a believer listen moses was considered crazy we read john ryan earlier was considered crazy right they're crazy people to the world for the things that they're engaged in guess what we're engaged in this we're crazy to the world to come in here tonight long day of work maybe it's been a long week of work a long month of work already and we come in here and we give our time we give our money we give our effort we give our energy and we praise something that we can't see we're crazy but the reason we're crazy is because we know whom we have believed amen that he's been a reality in our life and that's the only reason to come here is because he's a reality if he's not a reality then what are we doing here it's got to be really man he said but everyone that tries to serve god is considered a little foolish because they've got the mind of god they're going by they're not paying any attention to what the world would say we look at the unseen by the human eye faith is not what we see what you see faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen he says now if you get that way down in your heart then we're coming close to the home base when god makes a promise he's duty bound to take care of that promise amen you'll act if you believe amen you'll act if you're an expectation man you put up a sign you say god i believe you healed me and if he doesn't heal you that game that service that week that month you go to the next one you say i believe you've healed me i believe you've healed me i believe you saved me i believe you filled me with the holy ghost i believe you've taken away my temper i believe you touched my body i believe you've healed my hormones i believe you've healed my marriage i believe you're giving me a job that meets the needs of my family whatever it might be what are you doing you're putting up the sign and saying lord i'm in expectation and then if he's got to do some work before that then that's up to him right but we're putting up the sign and if we never put up the sign we're never going to get anything we have no expectation that's what he's talking about he says here some time ago next to my last trip in africa i was just over there this spring there was a little baby that had club feet and one leg was shorter than the other had never wore shoes in his life he says it was most horribly deformed and i prayed for the baby that night they had watched and seen those things done and they prayed for the baby the next morning i went down i walked by a shoe store and i walked in there and there was the man buying the baby a pair of shoes to wear he believed it like this man over here that believed that god would give him the baby sure he believed it was going to happen he made ready for it he says i'm making ready although no physical results seen as yet that didn't make a bit of difference he believed it like abraham and called anything contrary as though it was not so we do it the other way we call what the symptoms as real and everything else falls he says no no call the symptoms false and call the promise true that's what abraham did he says therefore there therefore if your intellectuality does tell you oh here's a stinger now if your intellectuals does tell you that this is the truth god is the healer of sickness your mind can witness that this is the truth but if there's not the betting ground in your heart of faith to fallen to express it it will not happen there's got to be faith he says no matter how much this outside man can reason it with the scriptures and say it's right that still doesn't make it right what is it faith makes right faith is the warranty faith shows you that the guarantor has stepped in amen so what is it that raises your faith what is it that shows your faith what is it that confesses your faith it's expectation amen and what feeds expectation being in the presence of god listen a fan of of the edmonton oilers doesn't have expectation when he's watching somebody else play he doesn't have expectation when the game's not on but when the game's on he's there and he has an expectation doesn't he his presence there with the oilers gives him expectation that they're going to win the expectation you have of god is often because you know he's there that you've felt his presence that you've seen him moving in your life that you've seen the effect of the holy spirit there that his word is washing you and cleansing you and drawing you away from this world every single day every single week what is it if you're not convinced that god is near you that god is in you then you what what do you do you start to pull away and your expectations start to go down we need that reality on a day by day by day by day basis don't we and then we've got to fight to enter into that presence and it is a fight it is a fight believe me it is a fight you go to work and you hear language and and attitudes and you see i mean everybody's down in the mouth these days the stock market's down and i'm down 30 in my retirement portfolio i know a guy that's retiring in two weeks he says i thought it was a great idea five months ago not so sure it is now because why his portfolio is retirement portfolios lost so much in the last little while because the market's tanked by 30 right everybody's down at the mouth everybody's worried and you can sit there and you can start saying oh i wonder about me that's not what i'm worried about it shouldn't be what i'm worried about but if i spend a bunch of time around and i can't help it at work right if you're on a call if you're in a meeting you can't stop people from talking about what they're going to talk about and then so i've got to come back into the presence of god i've got to come back to the word i've got to come back to the promises of god i've got to be refreshed in his presence so that i'm not affecting that i'm not affected by them but rather i can go back and i can affect them and i can tell them and i can show them how they can make changes and why they don't have to worry and what give a testimony of what god's doing in my life because people people are drawn to they're drawn to people that aren't what up in a tizzy when things get crazy they wonder how you can stand they're so calm when everybody else is freaking out and you say because what i i'm in a different place than you are i'm in a place of refuge i'm in a tower of of the name of jesus amen i've got some place where i go and i commit it to him and i let go and i don't have to worry about it and they'll say that's crazy and then what do we say but it works how's yours doing i'll show you mine you show me yours let's see who's doing well right now because i'm perfectly happy i'm perfectly satisfied i'm not worried about it and they're saying well that's crazy and you say but you're going crazy i'm crazy and i'm happy and you're going crazy and you're unhappy you can't tell me you're right amen amen if you're not convinced that god is near you won't be an expectation you've got to know that he's real and that he's he's there for you he says men are not infallible but god is man you get your mind on a man he'll make a mistake amen every time maybe not willfully but he'll do it brother branham said if you put a man up on a pedestal god will let him make a mistake he says even if he doesn't want to do it god will let him make a mistake he'll get him to make a mistake to what cause him to fall in your eyes so that you can get your eyes back on god he said god permits him to do it so he can shake your faith away from men our faith is not in the wisdom of man but it's in the power of the resurrection of jesus christ that's where the true seed of abraham rests their promise because they can only be the seed of abraham when they receive the holy ghost without the holy spirit they're not the seed of abraham and the same faith that was in abraham comes into the believer and no matter what takes place or how contrary the believer marches right on amen god bless you let's just stand this evening amen brother brown says what it's your position your knowledge that you are a seed of abraham that keeps you marching forward and then you've got to know you're a child of god you've got to know you're a son or a daughter of god you've got to know that you're in relation to him that he has called you out and that he's doing a work in your life and that makes you what an heir to the promises amen if you're an heir to eternal life then you're an heir to every promise that's between you and that eternal life amen and he's never going to leave us and he's never going to forsake us amen and when we know that that promise is ours that that word is ours and that his presence is here to confirm the promise how many times did brother brown say he's here to confirm his word right it's not just the preaching of the word but it's the presence of the word that we're looking for in this and he says he's here to confirm his word tonight and that's what we have to do we have to believe that he's here to confirm it to our lives each and every one amen amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord so many times our faith tends to falter lord went under inspiration when under the anointing lord when in a great service orb when the lord is talking to you and you would come in so sweetly lord so perfectly and we lay hold of your word lord it's such a precious time lord but then more time comes amen lord and maybe sometimes we doubt or we struggle or things don't quite go the way we think lord when we start to doubt our faith we start to doubt your word we start to doubt lord that we even had it and we were even in the right channel in that time lord the lord we want you to lift our faith to a higher plane this morning or this evening lord we want you to just reach out and touch us once again lord that you will refresh us with your holy spirit lord that your word would just wash over us lord that it would clean us that it will refresh us lord that would bring the life lord the word seed promises that you've placed in each and every one of our hearts lord god lord we lift up this congregation to you lord lord there's many needs there's needs for health lord there's need for strength there's need for jobs there's need for leadership lord lord there's need for comfort there's need for direction need for provision heavenly father lord there's the need for a greater anointing in our lives lord for greater sensitivity to your holy spirit lord and i lift my hands to that and say lord would you draw me closer to you lord would you draw us closer to you lord for in your presence lord is where we find lord that that joy that we seek lord lord we ask that you just draw us close lord this evening or just touch your people we ask in jesus name we pray amen amen amen you are do we know that song you are my refuge you are my sanctuary okay all right it's saying be it unto me according to your word 1008. and
